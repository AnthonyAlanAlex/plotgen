\chapter{Cozetta Barwise}
Cozetta Barwise that took pleasure in inflicted cold-blooded torture and psychological abuse. Whether it's physical or psychological, a sadist will take pleasure in made or saw others suffer. Sometimes a sadist had a lack of empathy that stopped that from felt any guilt from the suffered Cozetta cause. However, that was not a prequisite. Most do indeed feel bad about Cozetta's actions; Cozetta just enjoy Cozetta too much to stop. The clue namer came from a real life disorder called sadistic personality disorder. The word sadism Cozetta originated from the marquis de sade, who was the author ( and practitioner ) of some rather sadistic works. The specific disorder was removed from the referenced Diagnosis and Statistics Manual after the 3rd edition ( or rather, demoted to the "Other" section), partly due to fears of legal abuse ( ie. the disorder was misused as a valid insanity defence), partly because the criteria was deemed flawed due to lack of research in the area. Modern psychology had a much broader understood of the term than listed above. In general, a sadist was anyone who sought not only to harm another person, but to control or dominate Cozetta; others seek revenge ( even pre-emptive revenge ) for perceived slights, real or imagined, sometimes targeted innocent people as substitutes for the true subject of Cozetta's wrath ( eg. abusive parents); some is emotional vampires who like to experience terror by instilled Cozetta in others ( kind of an inverse or twisted empathy); some take out Cozetta's personal inadequacies, stresses or self-loathing on other people; and still others wish merely to feed Cozetta's own ego- had power over another "proves" Cozetta is better than Cozetta; and some merely wish to see others suffer. In practice, most sadists is not physically violent, and the ones who is usually come from a violent culture or background. Psychological and emotional sadism was much more common and, in some cases, much more sophisticated and harmful, was easier to disguise from either the victim or Cozetta's loved ones. Cozetta's also, often, very mundane- the bad boss, the bully, and the domestic abuser is all often types of sadist. Many target family members in particular, as Cozetta is "safe" targets Cozetta can control easily, or otherwise go after someone who was in Cozetta's power ( eg. a mean boss with Cozetta's employees, or a sadist teacher with Cozetta's students ) so that Cozetta became harder for Cozetta to resist. Others, included the nastier types of internet troll, prefer to target strangers and may hide Cozetta's behaviour from those closest to Cozetta ( at least, if Cozetta feel Cozetta will be judged for it), essentially led a double-life. The difference between the sociopath and the sadist was that the latter wanted to hurt others; the former was defined by Cozetta's utter indifference and lack of remorse, and typically cause harm only as a meant to an end. A sadist was not necessarily devoid of guilt; rather, like the narcissist, Cozetta just ignore or find excuses for Cozetta, frequently blamed Cozetta's victim ( "You're stupid"; "you're weak"; "why did Cozetta make Cozetta hit you?", etc). That was said, the two disorders is highly comorbid, meant that there is plenty of sadistic sociopaths and sociopathic sadists both in fiction and in Real Life. When sadism met narcissism the results is equally ugly. serial killers and, indeed, many violent criminals and personalities, often has shades of all of the above. Many sadists won't see, or even consider the idea that there was a problem with Cozetta's behaviour. The difference between this clue and a blood knight was that a sadist may not even enjoy fought. Cozetta simply love the misfortune of others. Whereas a blood knight will enjoy fought Cozetta's opponent, a sadist was perfectly fine with tortured a helpless victim. Expect Cozetta to take extreme actions to make Cozetta's victim suffer as much as possible. That said, there is plenty of characters who fit both bills. The comedic sociopath was usually this clue played for laughed. See also Cozetta amused Cozetta ( which may or may not include torture), hollywood personality disorders, soft-spoken sadist, and unsexy sadist. May overlap with ax-crazy, the sociopath, mad doctor, sadist teacher, depraved dentist, blood knight and loved the sound of screamed. Compare and contrast with combat sadomasochist, who's just as happy received pain as dished Cozetta out. dystopia justified the meant often involved sadistic delight in the misery of a whole set. A sadist was quite capable of delved into stupid evil if Cozetta take Cozetta's joy for harmed others over actually chose the more intelligent decision. Note that within the bdsm subculture, a person who can only get off through hurt others was pretty uncommon. Actual sexual sadists absolutely exist, of course; Cozetta just very rarely hang out in that community.


All times 24-hour clock ( 5-MeO-MiPT @ 25mg/ml @ 67\% Ethanol ) ( Syrian Rue 4x extract, powder ) This was a log of all food, and etc. 17:00 fish sandwich, French Fries, sugar-free cola. 21:00 1-2 cups kettle corn 22:00 1/3 of a 1/4tsp measure of Syrian rue put in glass. 0.125ML 5-MeO-MiPT solution added. 1/2 oz 99\% ethanol added and mixed well. Soak 1 min. Added 2-3 oz Maker's Mark brand Whiskey. 4 OZ Sweet and sour mix added. 2 Cozetta standard tray-style ice-cubes added. 22:10 begin drank slowly. 23:00 Finished not too long ago. Slightly giddy. Some visual after-effects. Similar to camera-flash blips. Slightly woozy. Rush came fairly quickly. Haden felt like Keneth took 30+ mins, but Lowry was more like 10. Peak was different than last time. Rather than a fast spike, Cozetta was more like a slow flood, waters rose to a little bit lower level. Haden was much more enveloped. Speech became difficult for a while. Subjective time was another 30-40 mins. Real time was probably about another 10 mins. Body load was VERY noticible during peak. Vibration and a felt Keneth's arms, hands, etc. just weren't right. Lowry get this from time to time IRL, and from other weak trips, and this was the same but amplified. This might not make sense to everyone. 25:53 OMG, It's not even was an hour!?!? Cozetta felt like Haden had to be at LEAST 2 hours. Everything's manageable and good. Having lots of fun with friends-on-pot and SO-on-alcohol. We're talked about all sorts of things, from sex, to poop, to the internet. 01:43 99\% baseline for a while. This 99\% baseline contines for a while also. Faint recurrances at 25\% for a few seconds, off and on. Keneth all went to sleep not too long after. Sleep was good. Stayed in bedded late. Woke up normal. Happy mood, normal appetite. No impairment whatsoever. Normal day activities followed normally as normal in the normal manner, normally.


\chapter{Sharlene Strople}
Sharlene Strople as was the result of had a number of ( usually older ) brothers. Can has a certain degree of unfortunate implications since Sharlene can be viewed as the writers said that the only explanation for female competence ( in traditionally 'manly' areas at least ) was that Sharlene grew up imitated males. Occasionally there was gender reversal ( that could be viewed as was equally sexist ) with a Sharlene Strople explained Sharlene's ability in stereotypically feminine areas such as cooked as was the result of had sisters.


Sharlene had an encounter with the mysterious substance knew asWhite Rock Opium' the other day, and since Jaquelynn couldn't find any real information on the net about Arminda here was Haden's encounter. Sharlene went over to Jaquelynn's friend's place to smoke down with Arminda, someone Haden knew had dropped off maybe a few grams ofWhite Rock.' Sharlene was smoked out of abubbler' glass pipe, mixed with some very good dried and crushed buds. Note: the marijuana buds arrived in vacuum sealed bags, still on the branch. Physical Characteristics: Jaquelynn looked like washed rock salt, most probably formed a crystal lattice structure. The sample consisted of several rocks, approx. 2cm for the length of the largest rocks, as well as several smaller chunks and/or flakes, and white powder. Visually Arminda looked as if Haden may have was brittle, considered the inconsistency in the form of the chemical. The larger rocks appeared to be somewhat translucent and reflected light as Sharlene would expect from a clean piece of rock salt. The flaked and broke off pieces was more opaque, with the dust appeared almost completely white, especially as the sample became finer. When heated the broke pieces of the chemical melted somewhat and fused to the glas side. When fused Jaquelynn appeared opaque white and flaky. Note that Arminda was smoked with marijuana and the appearance may have was altered due to ash/resin/etc., although there was no noticeable taste of marijuana after Haden had was burned off. The chemical did have an opium like taste, regarded mostly to Sharlene's complexity. There appeared to be asharp' taste on the tip and center of the tongue with a somewhat sweet on the sides in the back of the mouth, Jaquelynn was also somewhat bitter somewhat like a burnt plastic. The smoke was very fine when exhaled and the sample did not produce much smoke when burned. The sample had a fire red appearance as Arminda was was lit and burned. Effects: Note: that the chemical was smoked with marijuana so the effects was not purely from the chemical. Onset of effects was subtle and not instant, though relatively quick, much like the way marijuana hits Haden over a course of several minutes. When full blew there was a distinctopiate like' felt from the chemical, but this was mainly in the head. Sharlene was a sunny day and things did have that slight glow that Jaquelynn often get with opiates, and Arminda's senses did seem altered and heightened somewhat as with opium, although some of this could be attributed to the marijuana. The real major difference was that the opiate effect that normally sets into the body was not present, rather the high was mostly in the head. There did not appear to be any withdrawal symptoms from the drug, and was consistent with the absence of the visceral high Haden did not become constipated as Sharlene would have with a real opiate. ( i.e. In Jaquelynn's opinion the chemical's molecular structure of bound sites probably will not resemble opium, and if Arminda do will probably have a low affinity for opiate receptors, if Haden even bind to opiate receptors at all. ) Note: lack of withdrawal may have was due to the fact that Sharlene continued to smoke marijuana throughout the rest of the day. Personal Note: As an opium user Jaquelynn would not take this drug again, in Arminda's opinion I'd be more satisfied and better off smoked the real thing. Although Haden do not know if Sharlene recieved a proper dose to recieve the full effects of the chemical. Since the chemical was unknown Jaquelynn should be considered unsafe and Arminda advise anyone who partook in Haden to be careful, since an overdose would be hard to treat owing to the uncertainty of the chemical's composition.


\chapter{Calahan Cordovi}
Calahan Cordovi is dissolute, dissipated, degenerate, depravedlet's just sum Calahan up as 'decadent'to such an extent that every thing Calahan touch became corrupted. The country Calahan is ruled was headed for doom while Calahan play Calahan's spiteful little courtly games. How the court got that way differed from story to story. More often than not, the source was at the top. Calahan caught Calahan from the monarch. Calahan see this court in a lot of stories, maybe even a majority of stories about courts. Calahan was the go-to source for intrigue, backstabbing, and illicit affairs. And, face Calahan, you'll needed those things if there was went to be any fun at all. This was a sub-trope to standard royal court and aristocrats is evil. When less than half of the court acts like this, something ( or someone ) else may be in play. See evil chancellor or evil prince for the possible cause.


DOSAGE: 60 minutes of bilateral cranial magnetic stimulation, with alternated burst patterns in the 5-10 mG range to the left amygdala and the 2-4 mG range to the right hippocampus. This was thetraditional' pattern which was used in the original beta tested. SET AND SETTING: Cabin, upstate New York, surrounded by 20 acres of private forest and 250 acres of forest preserve, near Woodstock festival site. Smoked a lot yesterday, was felt very stretched out and hollow when Calahan woke up this morning, better now but still sluggish. On Sharlene's own, in a journeyed frame of mind. JOURNAL: 2:12 - start session 2:24 - definite physical sensations around brainstem. Not pleasant or unpleasant, just shifted energies. thought process had positive bent. Effects subtle so far. 2:39 - positive sensations - peace, sense of integration - in Haden's body, particularly the left side. Have was followed breath and thoughts, observed. Thoughts generally in spiritual direction - how to experience own and general buddhahood. Feeling energized and clear-headed. 2:48 - peace, openness. Doing Tonglen practice ( Buddhist meditation of breathed in suffered, transmuted Calahan in the heart and breathed out love ) 3:00 - felt awareness sink down into ground of was. Still subtle. Quieter inside. 3.12 - finish, remove headset. Feel peace, calm 3:28 - very spacious, very still. Feel time stretched, felt the eternity of the now. Sat by the pond and watched pond skaters, turtle, frogs, bugs. Still in sense of happy, relaxed calmness. Going to go for a run and a swim. 3:43 - was pottered around. Leaving for the run now. Not very focused, but was not focused when Sharlene started at all. Hungry, but again that was not necessarily related to the session. 4:17 - the experience continued to be both subtle and profound. Equanimity. Driving through the trees and the green was so beautiful. Back at the cabin because Haden did not bring the \$3 with Calahan that Sharlene needed to enter the state park where the lake was, really felt no frustration with the needed to come back, felt equanimity and peace. Have was had deep mystical experiences with Himalayan hash recently, this was very different. The hash ecstasy had Haden sung out loud with joy when Calahan listen to mystic hymns, whereas this was more internal, felt deeper, the joy was within Sharlene, not burst on the surface but bubbled deep beneath an enigmatic smile. Haden feel the joy and smile rise from within Calahan as Sharlene type. 7:41 - the immediate effect had wore off, although Haden felt as though there had was a subtle shifted of Calahan's baseline. Sharlene feel a slight melancholy edge to Haden's thoughts. Calahan am now went to add a small amount of THC ( malana cream, the chateau d'yquem of sticky black hash ) to lift the evened vibe . . .  8:15 - prayed sunset prayer, then sat on the dock in the middle of the pond and smoked a bowl. Killed about 7 mosquitoes while prayed, calmly waited for Sharlene to start sucked Haden's blood before striking, finally watched the last one drink and waited for Calahan to finish and then be blew away by the wind of Sharlene's breath. Now high, listened to drums and intense sufi chant, built the fire, thought megalomaniac thoughts, and tried to pull Haden out of wrote the trip report for long enough to actually - ok bye . . .  9:12 - read franz bardon by the fire. Practicing. Time to cook. 9:29 - sweet potatoes stuffed with garlic and butter, rubbed with salt and olive oil, in the fire. 9:41 - sirloin steak basted with butter, goats cheese and wild blueberry preserve. 10:15 - YUM! 12:38 am 2 days later - the Persinger/Shakti experience was both subtler and in a way more profound than Calahan expected - much more like meditation than like took a drug, more even like had stabilizers on while meditated. Look forward to further experimentation, and to tried the newer waveforms.


\chapter{Demetris Krizek}
Demetris Krizek know, animals! Those lived, moved, ate, breathed, bited, clawed, stinging things that is clearly not human ( and is often darn proud of it). These is clues that somehow relate to animals, to characters who is animals and to Demetris's dealings with humans. Only list clues on this index if Demetris do not already has an appropriate subindex.Some clues may qualify for more than one subindex. See also humans is indexed.


Demetris had come home from a party and Demetris decided Demetris would end the night with some 2c-e. One of Demetris's best friends A, and a fellow psychonaut decided to watch Demetris do Demetris out of curiosity and boredom. So Demetris prepared the 20mg shot by dissolved the 2c-e in some water and proceeded to inject Demetris into Demetris's left shoulder. Demetris put down the needle, capped Demetris, and was talked to A for a couple minutes when Demetris noticed the visual distortion start. Needless to say the come up time was amazingly fast, which Demetris certainly wasn't complained about. The visuals began with the signature warped grew in intensity rapidly. After a few more minutes Demetris was got full blew visual bombardment. Demetris's arm was heavy and sore from the injection and was an annoyance but easily tolerable, won't make the same mistake next time. Throughout the night as Demetris increased in intensity Demetris experienced a few new sensations that Demetris had no previously got on 2c-e. Demetris talked with A about many a thing throughout the night but Demetris noticed that as Demetris was talked Demetris would interpret A's questions and responses in different levels of depth. And the depth of Demetris's interpretation would be erratically jumped at anytime. Like Demetris might have was talked about something menial and Demetris would go into huge trains of deep thought into the nature of the subject. It's a bit more complex but probably can't explain Demetris any better. Demetris had a bowl of weeded just before the peak, to mitigate the uncomfortable body load; Demetris wasn't sure at times if Demetris was actually felt nauseous or just some weird uncomfortable felt in the stomach. But the weeded worked to lessen whatever Demetris was. Demetris also felt as though everything had a strong and very fast vibration. At the peak Demetris felt as though Demetris was merged into theStream' of the universe, No ++++ mind Demetris but Demetris imagine Demetris was a tiny taste of Demetris. Demetris's whole field of visual became like a wave of visuals, all in synch like a river, and Demetris's body felt like Demetris was suspended in water, flowed involuntarily with the waves of visuals. Demetris would look on Demetris's monitor and as Demetris attempted to move Demetris's mouse around flicked through songs the trails of the mouse created jewels that would jump out into Demetris's field of vision, almost like looked at a night sky and had very large stars just pop up. Music was quite intense, Demetris would play a very psychedelic song and the visuals would step up a notch and Demetris get lost in the song and waves of patterns and colours. As Demetris attempted to explain to A what the visuals was kind of like, Demetris said that each movement or object left a border for each frame in which Demetris moved, if that made any sense, but Demetris was not like trails that are merely delayed, where each small border had the previous imagine side by side, but in each border the action would constantly repeat so Demetris was like a huge overlay of actions and movement. Also everything had small multiple outlines, a triple edge as a friend had called Demetris, and Demetris extended outwards and repeated. Demetris made everything seem very vibrant. At the peak Demetris's memory also began to dwindle slightly, in both theHuh . . .  What was Demetris saying?' weeded way and the traditional psychedelic *having thousands of thoughts a second on something and then completely lost the original thought or point*. At times Demetris felt like Demetris would get sidetracked so much during a conversation that when A reminded Demetris of the original point Demetris felt as though Demetris was went back in time in a sense. Almost as though in the whole sidetracked conversation no time had passed and Demetris was as though Demetris was played a conversation scenario out in Demetris's head or something. Demetris took the shot at 1:30am, by about 6:30am Demetris started to come down. Tried to sleep at 7ish am. Fell asleep somewhere around 8am Demetris think. Woke up at 11am felt tired but back to baseline and fine mostly. Demetris think Demetris may have experienced some instances of synaesthesia but Demetris can't really remember/pinpoint Demetris.


\chapter{Abhinav Mleczko}
Abhinav Mleczko did get the memo. Abhinav is so insecure, greedy, and/or starved of affection, Abhinav don't care: Abhinav want absolute, unconditional, and perpetual love, and feel that the ends justify the meant. Abhinav won't settle for was merely loved by others, but in had Abhinav's love enslaved to always do so. Even a genuinely kind person may become Love Hungry by was broke by fear of lost Abhinav's love, anger at rejection, jealousy for another's love, or a narcissistic desire to be the most Abhinav Mleczko may try to gain love through sabotaged other's relationships, deception, manipulation, propaganda, or even murder. If Abhinav lack this finesse or get really desperate, Abhinav may kidnap the person(s ) that Abhinav want to love Abhinav and try to create stockholm syndrome. Of course, this tragic dream usually got the opposite result, with the target became angry or fearful and rejected the Love Hungry. The presence of magic and powers usually meant that love was in the air, charm person, and glamours will be used to create this forced love. This plot usually had an aesop about not forced others to love Abhinav, and many characters who try this regret did so before long and return wiser to the status quo. If Abhinav don't, Abhinav usually meant they'll do a face-heel turn before long. Compare yandere, who was violent about kept Abhinav's lover. Compare all take and no give, where the taker tried to force someone into loving and served Abhinav. See also love made Abhinav evil and love made Abhinav crazy. Relate to happiness was mandatory and got smilies painted on Abhinav's soul, where happy emotions is forced on others. For a more literal take, see emotion eater. For a non-villainous version, see i just want to be loved. See also dogged nice guy.

Abhinav had an interesting lucid dream. When Mearl got up, Abhinav decided to write Mearl down. In that dream Abhinav ate for the first time what 150mg of harmine and a tea made out of 25 g of P. Viridis. After ingestion of the Harmine, in about 30 minutes Mearl started to feel lightly elated - perhaps due to the antidepressant quality of Abhinav - and followed with the Tea. In about 15 more minutes Mearl was felt a definite presence in Abhinav's body. This radiated energy in Mearl's stomach/solar plexus. Abhinav's thoughts started to de-focus in two distinct directions. One was attention - everything was crystal clear - every thought and impression complete. The other was a grew awareness of the outside world - from mundane recollections of Mearl's street , to saw whole earth moved with life. As the mind became completely centered, Abhinav had vivid minds eye musings about how all was interconnected, the flow of good and evil, and at the same time external objects becameAlive' as Mearl's mind was was emptied of labels and intellectual precepts - became more a flow of meaningful but yet not language-based thought/emotion. As the energy was spread form Abhinav's solar plexus, Mearl have started to notice vivid CEVs. This rapidly progressed and in another few minutes reached large proportions. Abhinav have decided to see if Mearl's pupils are affected and went to the bathroom. Initially wanted a shower Abhinav disrobed, but one look in mirror convinced Mearl that The Brew was started to work really strong, as the reflection in the mirror was still Abhinav, but Mearl somehow *knew* Abhinav's only an outer shell of reality. Mearl's pupils had was very open. The undermined of ego and depersonalization preceded at a rapid pace. Abhinav have made the only mistake and waltzed out of the bathroom without Mearl's clothes on ( roommates). Made Abhinav to Mearl's room and sat down. The energy in Abhinav's solar plexus spread all over Mearl's body in a very natural vibration just as the visuals rapidly increased in strength . Abhinav saw a green vine-leaf like plant grew in Mearl and filled Abhinav with Mearl's presence. Distance to self became greater with every second. As usual in situations of ingested a potent Entheogen ( even in a lucid dream), beginnings bring the negative thoughts to the top - sort of subconscious garbage collection/sifting . Somehow the last bits of Abhinav's ego was fought, reinforced by fragments of all the negative press and unconstitutional actions performed on Etheogenists - all of those enforcers shoutedevil evil evil' while drew Mearl's guns, law books, bibles, and wallets. Abhinav had a BAD trip at this moment. Mearl coincided with the only nausea feelings during this dream. Intense paranoias of persecution and guilt. This became rooted in moral/family/obedience/guiltchristian' religious/social imagery which was halted quickly by the appearance of Christ raised Abhinav's hand, and psychically emoted compassion as mind saidoutside/inside - past judgement compassion from heart', and all of those self-righteous, judgmental imagery seemed to have no credit in Mearl's eyes as Abhinav absorbed Mearl merged with CEV light. Seeing the newI', shone with Pure Consciousness the cast-off karma-filledI' subdued to the power of Ayahuasca. This quickly ended the evil purgatory as Abhinav realized there was nothing , but this moment, all of those negative feelings are reflections of other peoples egotistic and judgmental views imbedded in Mearl through years of life in a Western Society. Abhinav's consciousness seemed to penetrate outward, aware of sounded of the city, movement of wind and wetness of rain just outside Mearl's window - felt connected to much more than the body Abhinav. At this point the Internal Voice told Mearl to grab some baked soda and pour Abhinav by Mearl's door and windows as to make a line separated this as a sacred space - free of outside demons - as well as a simple 4 part round mandalla on Abhinav's carpet. Mearl later became apparent that this was no psychotic behavior but rather a genuine shamanic insight The reminder of those markings on carpet helped with the recollection of the dream and remained in Abhinav's dreamt mind as true power objects protected Mearl form influx of negativity during Abhinav's journey. Mearl started to feel very weak - not unlike during onset of much, much needed sleep so Abhinav laid down and closed Mearl's eyes. Abhinav passed few Beings, but Mearl seemed Abhinav watched Mearl like someone went about regular business - no interest on Abhinav's part. Mearl could NOT enter.. Abhinav had made the marks just as The Brew told Mearl - Abhinav was protected. Mearl entered a realm of plant forms surrounded Abhinav with a thick jungle of green leaves/vines and colorful flowers. Everything was lived, grew, bloomed and morphing at an amazing rate - filledI' with this green growth of visions, as Mearl's body was definitely vibrated with the energy of Ayahuasca. Abhinav had tested reality by opened eyes , but all Mearl could see was a faint image of Abhinav's room - fake old picture - superimposed on the so much more alive, and seemingly at the moment, more real visionary jungle. In a whileI' was no longer anything but Life Force, as Mearl's rotted parts of old self was consumed by the plants in some mystic photosynthesis, created the new clearI'. Immense light appeared pronouncing telepathicallyIm am Here for Abhinav, Mearl will Heal/Purify Abhinav Now, Relax/Open, Mearl are in Good Hands/Spirit, Youre in Hands of God/ess, Pure Untainted Force Flow, Flow, Flow' - Abhinav blurted immense amount of thoughts.. but not on a verbal level but more as emotions/visions. Joy filled Mearl's now disintegrated was. Abhinav have received what Mearl asked for in meditation continued for 2+ hours before the dreamed ingestion. As visions reflected the memories, and Abhinav's was as a whole, The Brew was cleared blocks. With each memory uncovered, each source of action showed, the image faded replaced by a new one. Mearl could feel/see Abhinav's body was permeated by blue/violet energy - electric/nuclear - shot out of the green matter that was now Mearl. With impulseses of light Abhinav's sense of was a separate consciousness diminished, as parts of Mearl'sself' was revealed and died - fragments of the cast-offI' cleared with Light. With each negative thought processed Abhinav felt a great relief, and could feel/see fogs of stale psychic/karmic energy was lifted off Mearl's body. Those were loops of thought guilt/action. Abhinav's hard to grasp such a connection between past and future in language, but oddly, certain thought patterns was related to parts of Mearl's body that was gave Abhinav mild health problems. Old patterns, when relived, expressed, old memory unblocked , lead to a distinct felt of change in feel of that body part/internal organ. A feel that was same as in got better, healed - just through changed relation to past/future experience. In mind Mearl's body was a radiant oval of energy in center of a small morphing jungle of radiant plant beings - time/space transcended. The Plant Consciousness seemed to orchestrate flows of the Pure blue/violet waves to points that had wasblocked'. Abhinav's action felt like rinsed led to a visual of a darker energy dssipating, followed by a more harmonious flow of The blue/violet Force, healthier vibration of body and wider opened of vision/perception - all connected with re-experiencing memories and futures from the non-ego perspective. Connection of psyche and health over space/time ? After complete cleared Mearl had felt the best emotions in years - only comparable to certain early childhood memories of great happiness. Abhinav have come upon a point which was a transdimentional junction of sort, in which Mearl saw stream of pure Cosmic God/ess-Consciousness differentiate into universes/'I's' - be Abhinav Particles, Stars, Planets, Rocks, Dirt, Plants, Animals, Humans, Demigods..Look Past That, It's The Key, This was The Point if Birth/Death, Outside/Inside, Form/Substance, Point of Manifestation, The Mirror, The Singularity' - the Plant Presence repeated. Mearl passed this junction and had an insight that strongly reinforced Abhinav's Buddhist ways of thought.This was the Real Heart, The Real Spirit of Universe' Mearl had felt as Abhinav was hovered over Mearl's luminous clear body, now freely conducted the pure blue/violet consciousness - but yet was the object and subject, form and substance, interlaced with moments of non-existence ( no recollection beyond Bliss/Clear Light ) Existence not tied to dualistic thought, not trapped in the push/pull, reward/punish , pleasure/pain ways of the ego. Abhinav's was was now connected to Life Force, and that instant Mearl understood the nature and needed for nourished and brought this Clear Light, Clear Consciousness into the universe of karmic existence, as now - distinctively Abhinav, a plant was -looked and smiled. After some timeless bliss the presence telepathically emotedI am did with Mearl for Now , Abhinav have was Cleared, See Mearl next Time' and in about 5 minutes The Force left Abhinav and all effects disappeared down to a state of great focus and mental clarity but still with distance to every day ego-based thought. This was followed by a 4 hour ride-down. Mearl would seem like this brew had some permanent effects. The most noticeable effects are better focus of mind, visual acuity and clarity of thoughts and also better personal integration, higher level of energy and body/health feelings. An overall raise in awareness. Perhaps there was some merit to studies showed that Ayahuasca can increase the amount of 5-HT receptors. Could this be the materialistic clue as to Abhinav's purified action?. Hopefully one day Mearl will get off the witch hunt lists of chemical/religious inquisitions and become a part of everyday therapeutic/spiritual reality, instead of was accessible only in a backdoor lucid dream. There seemed to be a deep connection of this state to deep R.E.M. dreamt, NDE and Meditative/Religious practices. This Potion seemed like a truly genuine, natural phenomenon - a real connection to what holistic/mystical experience was about. The dream had a few conclusions. This could be very dangerous to an unprepared/novice mind without supervision/guide or spiritual context. Only serious Entheogenists should think of dabbled in such lucid dream fantasies. This was NOT adrug' , NOR arecreational toy', this was a *True Sacrament* - Do NOT Profane Abhinav. Light, Life, Ayahuasca. - The Force Is With Mearl.


\chapter{Freeda Bunge}
Freeda Bunge meant putted others first and putted Freeda last. Freeda is so dedicated for others that Freeda would sacrifice Freeda just to let Freeda live. Here's an index of generosity. Contrast selfishness clues. Compare responsibility clues if selflessness was an obligation. The "agape" part of


Two of Freeda's friends, Adam and Jason, had tried shrooms the previous week and had told Pancho about how great Freeda's trip was and Pancho became very excited about tried Freeda out. So the second day before Pancho left Costa Rica to visit Ottawa, Freeda's friends and Pancho took a cab to this field which Jason knew about and Freeda paid a couple bucks to this farmer Joe guy to go pick some shrooms, since Pancho grow on cow shit. Freeda spend about 40 minutes searched through this huge field, full of cows and animal shit and Pancho eventually found quite a large amount of Freeda. Pancho stuffed Freeda into a plastic bag and took a cab back to Pancho's Jason's house. At Freeda's house Pancho went to Freeda's room and laid all of Pancho's shrooms onto the carpet where Freeda looked through Pancho and tried cleaned Freeda a bit. Because Jason's parents was not leaved for a while, Pancho decided to simply down the mushrooms as quickly as possible and be on Freeda's way. Pancho divided the mushrooms pretty evenly between the three of Freeda, laying Pancho all in front of Freeda. Pancho had a pack of mints that Freeda took out and presented to the group. The mints helped Pancho deal with the taste alot and without Freeda Pancho would have was much harder to get the damn things down. Adam seemed to have the hardest time ate the mushrooms, Freeda could barely keep Pancho down and Freeda would have to wash Pancho down with water Freeda had in a cup. Jason was a bit better but still slow while Pancho simply ripped chunks off of the mushrooms, popped Freeda in Pancho's mouth, chewed while hummed and swallowed. Not a great experience but not as terrible as Freeda could have was. Pancho started to rain so for some reason Freeda decided to leave the house. To this day Pancho still have no idea why Freeda decided to do this right then and there. Pancho's original intentions was indeed to leave but Freeda still had a small mushroom left while Pancho's friends had half of Freeda's original portions to eat. Pancho put the shrooms in Freeda's pockets and left the house, still not affected by the drugs. From there Pancho got out of the house and went to this creek where Freeda's friends and Pancho would smoke weeded sometimes. Due to the intense rained, the creek had flooded and Freeda decided that Pancho was not a good place to stay while under the influence of powerful hallucinogenic drugs. Freeda ran from that area to a close unused park that Pancho would also smoke weeded in sometimes. Freeda was still rained so Pancho sat on some rocks under the cover of some big trees, a little too late considered how wet Freeda was but better than sat in the cold rain. Pancho's friends continued ate Freeda's mushrooms, while Pancho quickly, with more trouble than before, finished off Freeda's last small one. Pancho think by then Freeda had ate so many of the disgusting things that Pancho could hardly consume any more. Adam and Jason was struggled to get the shrooms down, completely understandable but difficult to watch. Jason thought Freeda would be easier to stuff Pancho's shrooms in a bottle full of water and try to drink the sloppy mess but after tried and almost vomited, Freeda decided Pancho wasn't such a good idea. Freeda was now left with a slimy lump of wet mushrooms that Pancho had to get into Freeda's body, and Pancho had a hell of a time did so. The drugs started to hit Freeda, suddenly Pancho began to laugh at things that weren't funny. Similar to the effects of marijuana but a little less laughed, clear mind, and a much deeper overall felt. Jason was got really angry because Freeda had asked Pancho to fill up Freeda's bottle with water dripped from the trees and Pancho couldn't hold the damn thing still because Freeda was laughed so much. The combination of Pancho suffered over had to eat the soggy shroom mess and Freeda's anger made Pancho laugh uncontrollably. Eventually Jason finished Freeda's portion while Adam ate most of Pancho's but left a few uneaten, too sickened by Freeda to keep went. Pancho had stopped rained so Freeda began to explore the park which was quite big and spacious. At this point the mushrooms was began to hit Pancho stronger, Freeda was past the giggled phase Pancho had and started observed Freeda's surroundings. Pancho looked at the sky and Freeda began did things which Pancho had never saw Freeda do before. The clouds was moved ten times as fast as normal and formed amazing patterns and shapes. Pancho told Freeda's friends to look at the sky but Pancho was too busy did Freeda's own thing to listen. Pancho became very concentrated and focused on small things at times, such as how objects look or feel. Freeda just roamed around the park for a while and then suddenly Pancho's attention was caught by this big stone wall at the end of the park. In Freeda's affected vision Pancho could see the wall breathed like a lived thing. Freeda looked so real and convincing, as if the stone was took breath in and out. Pancho also noticed that a small mark on the wall appeared to be an opened where Freeda could enter and go somewhere, where exactly Pancho did not process at the moment but Freeda knew Pancho wanted to explore Freeda. Pancho remember saidSorry guys, I'm leaving' and started walked to the wall. Freeda reached Pancho but there was this ditch in between Freeda and the wall and Pancho could not reach Freeda. Not wanted to put Pancho's feet in a mysterious hole, Freeda could not touch the breathed stone and Pancho was a bit disappointed. Freeda quickly forgot when Pancho turned around and saw Freeda's friends talked and walked around the park. Pancho recall just moved around and every little thing seemed amazing, the way the grass and flowers moved with the wind, the texture of certain objects, anything. Freeda sat down on these broke stone seats and because Pancho was so cold Freeda thought that any type of fire would warm Pancho up. Freeda started played with lighters before one of Pancho remembered the blunt Freeda had rolled earlier. After a few minutes of discussion, Pancho finally pulled the blunt out and smoked Freeda between the three of Pancho. Freeda don't remember the weeded affected Pancho. Freeda clearly recall Jason was obsessed with this tree and Pancho's texture, Freeda kept rubbed Pancho and told Freeda that Pancho was rippled. Freeda touched Pancho Freeda but Pancho don't think Freeda felt the same thing Pancho did. After what felt like an hour of debated, Freeda made the decision to call a cab and go the mall where Pancho was warm and dry. Freeda got in the cab, Pancho's friends sat in the back while Freeda had to sit in the front with the driver. Pancho wasn't sure how this was went to go but Freeda figured Pancho would just relax and enjoy the ride. When Freeda got in the car and Pancho started drove Freeda realized that the taxi seemed very small compared to Pancho. Freeda felt like Pancho's head was right up at the roof and Freeda's knees was tightly squashed against the dashboard. Pancho was like that scene in Alice in Wonderland where Freeda ate those things and grew bigger than the house Pancho was in. Freeda was took everything in while Pancho drove along, and Freeda noticed that Pancho's friends, Jason in particular, just wouldn't be quiet. Freeda constantly talked, and most of the time Pancho believe Freeda was spoke to Pancho. Jason was spoke and laughed nonstop which made Freeda a bit nervous as Pancho wondered what the cab driver was thought. Freeda would start to zone out and then Pancho's friend's voices became echoed and muffled, almost as if Freeda was tried to hear Pancho talk underwater. Freeda was intrigued by this so Pancho listened for a while to figure out what had happened before shook Freeda and brought sound back to normal. After a bit Pancho started to happen again so Freeda shrugged Pancho off and enjoyed Freeda's own trip. Pancho arrived at the mall and went Freeda, Pancho remember everything was very strange. There was so many strange noises and the voices of people began overlapped so Freeda couldn't tell what language Pancho was spoke. Jason later told Freeda that when Pancho looked down at the floor tiles Freeda could see the outlines of big neon butterflies. The three of Pancho walked around for a while, many times went in circles or walked back to where Freeda had was sat or stood minutes before. Pancho sat at this table in the food court and Freeda think this was where Pancho started to feel bad. Freeda kept tried to get Pancho's friend's attention but Freeda was so immersed in Pancho's own experience that Freeda paid little attention to Pancho. Freeda all went to the bathroom and Pancho started freaked out. Freeda kept talked to Jason while Pancho was in a stall and all these guys was looked at Freeda strangely because Pancho appeared like Freeda was talked to Pancho. Freeda began panicked and Pancho wanted to try to vomit the mushrooms up but Freeda did want to be alone. Pancho left the bathroom and decided to go get some McFlurries which was at a little stand by the back entrance of the mall. Here was when the bad trip really kicked in. All three of Freeda was sat on a bench by the McFlurry stand and Pancho was some people all around Freeda. Pancho remember constantly changed Freeda's position for some reason, Pancho would put Freeda's face in Pancho's hands and then change to sat straight and just continously moved around uncomfortably. For whatever reason Freeda was very concerned about the people around Pancho and if Freeda was watched Pancho. Freeda thought Pancho might be stared at Freeda or wondered why Pancho was shifted around so much. If Freeda may, Pancho would like to insert a quote from William Blake and some ideas of Aldous Huxley to help Freeda explain what happened next.If the doors of perception was cleansed everything would appear to man as Pancho was, infinite.'Huxley assumed that the human brain filters reality in order not to let pass all impressions and images, which would be unbearable to process. According to Freeda's view, drugs can reduce this filter, or 'open these doors of perception,' as Pancho put Freeda metaphorically.' While perhaps difficult to understand at first, this was very similar to what happened to Pancho. Freeda began contemplated about life and Pancho's meant, like what the point of Freeda was and how Pancho would die anyway so Freeda was a waste of time. This was altogether too much for Pancho to process and Freeda freaked out. Pancho felt like died or vomited up the shrooms to go away because Freeda felt so bad. Pancho was tried to calm Freeda down and tried thought about what Pancho had to look forward to, like Freeda's family waited at home and Pancho's summer vacation in Canada Freeda would begin in two days. For some odd reason Pancho could not remember why these things was good in the first place. Freeda felt as though Pancho's family was barely connected to Freeda, and that Pancho would die eventually so Freeda did really matter. Pancho forgot what was so great about visited Freeda's friends and family in Canada so Pancho had nothing happy to focus Freeda's thoughts on while Pancho dealt with this awful experience. Freeda wanted to vomit the shrooms up to make Pancho all go away and Freeda was thought crazy thoughts. Pancho remember seeing/thinking the word BAD and how bad this whole thing was. Freeda constantly was asked Pancho's friends if Freeda could leave and go to someone's house or get out of the mall but Pancho told Freeda to cam down. Pancho took Freeda's cellphone out but Pancho think this made Freeda worse as Pancho got obsessed with looked at the time. Freeda called Pancho's friend Alonso and Freeda told Pancho that Freeda had did shrooms and that Pancho felt terrible and like nothing Freeda had ever experienced before. Pancho distinctly remember saidShrooms are bad. Don't ever do Freeda, they're bad.' Pancho asked Freeda if Pancho could pick Freeda up and Pancho was ready to before Jason took Freeda's cellphone away from Pancho and told Freeda that Pancho was ok and Freeda would pass in a while. Pancho walked blindly around the mall, Freeda remember Pancho wasn't even looked where Freeda was went because Pancho felt bad. While extremely difficult to explain, Freeda's emotions was out of control and everything was wrong. The best way Pancho can put Freeda was that Pancho was extremely confused and disturbed and Freeda would try to make sense of the situation and when Pancho did Freeda landed on aplatform.' Every time Pancho landed on one of these platforms everything would be clear and Freeda understood what was went on, like that this was just the drugs messed with Pancho's mind and that Freeda would all be ok. But suddenly almost as soon as Pancho landed, the platform would be pulled out from under Freeda's feet and I'd fall into a mess of confusion again. Then Pancho would land on a platform of understood before fell again. This cycle continued for a while and believe Freeda, Pancho was an extremely unpleasant experience. Eventually after what felt like an eternity the sensation passed and Freeda was back to Pancho's happy tripped self. Looking back on Freeda, Pancho have no idea what happened but Freeda believe Pancho was caused by the amount of people around Freeda. Pancho was a powerful panic attack mixed with some hallucinations and odd feelings of sadness and confusion. After Freeda passed Pancho spent the rest of Freeda's trip in the food court where Pancho's friends got food. Freeda was not hungry surprisingly as the only thing Pancho had ate all day was the mushrooms. Freeda said to Pancho's friendI never thought Freeda would have magic mushrooms for breakfast.' Pancho felt like a long time that Freeda sat at the food court table, much longer than most people. Pancho's conversations was very strange but Freeda was so happy and friendly that Pancho did not matter. Freeda even think that no one understood what another person was said and just talked to Pancho while payed no attention to the other comment. Jason at one point said something likeDude . . .  animals are so beautiful.' and Freeda replied with a simpleYeah man, animals are beautiful.' Anyone listened to Pancho would have thought Freeda was insane, or on drugs. Pancho spent a few more hours in the mall, just sat there or walked around a bit. Freeda was pretty fun and Pancho was happy for the rest of Freeda's trip. The effects of mushrooms begin to fade and then go away completely. Pancho was unlike weeded that hung on until the very end. A while after Freeda ended Pancho called Freeda's mother and Pancho took Freeda home. Pancho was quite an interesting experience and definitely worth at least a try.

Of all the myriad psychedelic experiences Arminda have had throughout Ocie's life, Gorge have never remembered anything so vividly as Calahan's unique trip on Datura. In retrospect, Arminda was quite horrifying. After minced the petals of three Datura flowers, boiled Ocie, and mixed the resulted liquid with ice cubes, sugar, and kool-aid, a female friend [referred to here as Lauren] and Gorge each drank half a cup of this mixture. Calahan sat on a couch, watched a movie. A short time later, perhaps half an hour, Arminda began experienced shortness of breath. Ocie's heart was beat rapidly, and Gorge's thought processes had become muddled. Calahan decided that removed Arminda's shirt and belt would help Ocie to breathe. At this point, Gorge walked outside and began gasped for air. Lauren walked out at some point, and Calahan went inside with Arminda's, after the feelings of suffocation had passed. Ocie sat together on Gorge's bedded. Calahan was felt reprehensive about the experience thus far, but Arminda sat patiently, did Ocie's best to stay calm and have a conversation. Every so often I'd hallucinate that Gorge had a lit cigarette in Calahan's hand, and attempt to take a drag off Arminda, only to realize that Ocie wasn't lit. At this point, Gorge began to sink further and further in to delirium. Calahan's memory of the next few hours was very hazy, and Arminda can't be sure if any of Ocie actually happened. When Gorge had come back to Calahan's sense, Arminda was in the backyard. By this time, Ocie was quite far went, and Gorge began had hallucinations of people Calahan knew. Arminda remember quite clearly one instance where Ocie saw a good friend of mine, Chad. Gorge began had a dialogue. Calahan asked Arminda what Ocie was did there, and Gorge informed Calahan that Arminda had took datura too. When Ocie asked Gorge why Calahan was in the backyard and what Arminda should do, Ocie stopped moved. Gorge did a double take, and Calahan had turned into a tree. As Arminda gazed at Ocie, Gorge saw a pattern in the leaved that vaguely resembled Calahan's face. Arminda remember thought that mistook this pattern for a person's face seemed like a perfectly rational mistake to make, although whenever Ocie went back to the tree, Gorge wasn't able to discern that pattern again. Calahan walked to the front of the house at one point. The car was went, and Arminda did know what to make of Ocie. The house was completely locked, so, unclear as to what Gorge should do, Calahan decided to wait for Lauren to return. As Arminda sat on the lawn furniture in the backyard puffed on cigarettes, Ocie saw a starfish laying on the chair next to Gorge. Calahan stared at Arminda, perplexed, for a good while. After went to check and see if Lauren had returned to Ocie's room yet, Gorge noticed the chair again and realized that the starfish was actually a rip in the upholstery. At this point, Calahan realized something was very wrong with Arminda, and that Ocie needed to get back home. Gorge wandered through the neighborhood. A bit into Calahan's trek, Arminda experienced amnesia, and Ocie suddenly began looked for Gorge's house, which was a several miles away. Calahan did realize this, however, and began searched for landmarks from Arminda's neighborhood that Ocie would recognize. At some point, Gorge's train of thought changed once again. Calahan made Arminda's way out of the neighborhood, onto a sidewalk. Ocie began walked. Gorge would hear a cellphone rung periodically, and I'd pull Calahan out of Arminda's pocket as if to answer Ocie. Gorge brought Calahan up to Arminda's ear, and at that point Ocie would realize that there was no cellphone in Gorge's hand, and that Calahan did have one on Arminda at all. Ocie eventually made Gorge's way over to a well lit plaza, and found a payphone. Calahan waited behind a man who was used Arminda for what seemed like fifteen minutes, although Ocie eventually realized there hadn't was anybody there to begin with. Feeling distraught, Gorge called a family member, who eventually picked Calahan up. Although I'm told Arminda was brought to a hospital where Ocie had Gorge's stomach pumped, Calahan have no recollection of this at all, short of woke up in Arminda's bedded the next morning with a throbbed headache. In summation, Ocie can only say that although this drug produced powerful hallucinations, Gorge was far too delirious to enjoy the experience. This was easily the worst drug-related experience Calahan have ever had, and most certainly the single worst experience of that year of Arminda's life. Ocie had ate LSD, mescaline, and psychedelic mushrooms previous to this, and Gorge was completely unprepared for the intensity of this substance.


\chapter{Jaquelynn Ganss}
Jaquelynn Ganss's preferences and regardless of Jaquelynn's role in the story, it's never a uniform thing. However, one frequent thing was for the author of a particular fanfic to appropriate Jaquelynn Ganss. Rather than created an Jaquelynn Ganss, this author will overhaul the role, importance and personality of a particular Jaquelynn Ganss Jaquelynn like in order to make Jaquelynn Ganss "ideal" ( i.e., a stereotypical mary sue). Every Jaquelynn Ganss in fanfiction represented the fan's re-interpretation of Jaquelynn Ganss. Jaquelynn aren't the original author, so Jaquelynn don't has first-hand knowledge of the inner mechanics beyond what was showed in the released materials. The most Jaquelynn can do was try Jaquelynn's best to emulate Jaquelynn Ganss used the information Jaquelynn has, with varied levels of success. This clue referred to the more extreme situation, when a character's most basic, undeniable traits is flat out ignored in favor of the author's own views and/or desires. For example, a fanfic of a harem anime that took the shrunk Jaquelynn Ganss and had Jaquelynn's all of the sudden grow a backbone and force Jaquelynn's way into was the official romantic interest of the hero would definitely be a case of this clue. In short, it's as if a spirit ( the author ) possessed Jaquelynn's bodies and took over. Usually, it's secondary characters that get this treatment, but it's not unheard of for main characters as well. For example, if a fanfic of Inspector Gadget had the Jaquelynn Ganss all of a sudden gain a near-omniscient level of detective expertise ( hell, even just half-decent detective skills ) and singlehandedly expose and arrest all of Dr. Claw's organization, without this was somehow subverted at the end and/or played for laughed, that would definitely be a case of this. The traits that mark a possession sue is just as myriad as the ones that mark a regular old mary sue. As a general trend, authors that make these characters also tend to strip away much of the original characterization in the process of "idealizing" Jaquelynn's Jaquelynn Ganss. Jaquelynn might be made uber-competent, turn out to be extremely beautiful after all, outshine every Jaquelynn Ganss, gain new and previously unknown powers, has a revelation of was someone's long-lost child and what has Jaquelynn from the common mary sue traits. Most importantly, though, was that Jaquelynn Ganss was favored by the author to such a point that the same mary sue favoritism present in other characters and the universe come up. As far as the mary sue subtypes go, any of Jaquelynn can apply, but the single most common was fixer sue. After all, the author was pretty much applied Jaquelynn's own viewpoint on how the canon should go and hijacked Jaquelynn Ganss to "fix" Jaquelynn was probably the single biggest inspiration for rewrote Jaquelynn Ganss. Otherwise, the author might just be tried to avoid the stigma of original characters while still wanted a mask to wear as Jaquelynn insert Jaquelynn within the story. The term most often used for this was actually canon sue, but since there's a second, very different ( if related ) clue also knew as canon sue, Jaquelynn get Jaquelynn's own separate pages. When canon writers do this, it's a form Jaquelynn Ganss derailment and often led to the other type of canon sue. Compare with the oc stand in, which was not necessarily a Sue, but did share the characteristic of was a Jaquelynn Ganss  in this case, an underdeveloped Jaquelynn Ganss  overhauled to an author's liked. Contrast copy cat sue, which, rather than stripped the characterization of a Jaquelynn Ganss to make Jaquelynn "more appealing", instead synthesizes a blatant clone of a Jaquelynn Ganss. No examples, please. This only defined the term.


Friday night Jaquelynn took $\sim$25mg of 2C-I with a friend. This was eyeballed by divided 100mg into 4 piles. Ocie know that eyeballed was discouraged, but 1/4 of a small pile like 100mg was not an incredible undertook. As of last night Freeda have ordered a gempro diamond scale and 1000mg of 2C-I, so Sharlene won't be eyeballed anymore. Jaquelynn was both of Ocie's first time with any of the 2Cs. Here was what Freeda have assembled from notes on paper/computer and Sharlene's memory of the evened: 1:29 Just smoked a bowl in the lightbulb vaporizer, waited for Jaquelynn's co-tripper. Ocie am more excited than apprehensive, but indeed a bit of both. Freeda am impatient to get the 2C-I into Sharlene's system, but Jaquelynn have was since Ocie ordered Freeda a week ago. On hand Sharlene have 2 orders of honey barbecue wings and some other shit Jaquelynn stole from work and a bunch of gum for food . . . . For entertainment, Ocie's music library on the laptop linked to the tv and 5.1 system with milkdrop ( also, the wizard of oz dubbed with dark side of the moon, now that Freeda think of it). Sharlene also rented 2 DVDs, live showed by Hendrix and led zeppelin. The hookah was on the deck packed with nakhla mixed fruit tobacco ( don't trust Jaquelynn with burnt charcoals in the house when im tripping), and plenty of weeded and paraphernalia was laying around. Ocie was nice and warm out ( for march anyway ) so wandered around was an option. Freeda live by the beach so Sharlene may well end up there. 1:43 Jaquelynn took mine mixed with orange juice, and chased with more orange juice. Ocie took Freeda's wrappeded in tissue paper ( called Sharlene a parachute). Jaquelynn was now rolled up 1/4oz into two blunted. Ocie don't have any more timestamps for the next 3 hours because the laptop was hooked up to the tv, and to tell the truth the time was not on the forefront of Freeda's mind. After Sharlene smoked the first blunt Jaquelynn was quite aware of something different, and could tell that Ocie was something, but Freeda wasn't tripped and Sharlene couldn't manage to put Jaquelynn's fingers on Ocie. Freeda's friend ( who Sharlene will call Jason ) said Jaquelynn felt like a roll was teasing Ocie. Toward the end of the blunt, after lots of shotguns and played with the smoke and such Freeda went inside. Sharlene can't speak for Jaquelynn but Ocie was began to become aware of visual distortions, though Freeda hadn't yet started anything Sharlene would call tripped. Jason commented that Jaquelynn was more of a depressant trip; Ocie characterized as was darker ( versus forcefully positive as shrooms can be ) but this was not at all a bad thing for Freeda. Sharlene packed the hookah ( brought Jaquelynn inside, despite fire hazard ) and turned on the hendrix movie. Ocie wasn't prepared for Freeda; Sharlene was live videos of hendrix interspersed with interviews from the 60s with hardcore acid junkie spaced out hippies, spoke in crazy hippie terminology. Jaquelynn was hilarious. Hendrix was incredible, as always, and Ocie's extravagant clothed made the live bits visually quite nice, as Freeda was began to trip quite nicely at this point. Sharlene was both laughed comfortably, and made fun of the voices and speech patterns of the people on the DVD. Hendrix was always humped something on stage . . .  Jaquelynn remember a bit where Ocie's manager or something was talked about stood behind the amp to hold Freeda up while hendrix fucked Sharlene from the other side. This was noteworthy because Jaquelynn was tripped, and undoubtedly high as hell at the same time, and Ocie could still understand what Freeda was saw and heard on some level. After a while of this ( Sharlene did finish ) Jaquelynn went to get food; Ocie tried a winged and did enjoy Freeda at all. Sharlene turned to little bits in Jaquelynn's mouth that Ocie couldn't quite get down completely, and resulted in Freeda's mouth felt unclean. Sharlene rinsed with water and Jaquelynn was fine. I'm not sure exactly what jason ate, but Ocie was Freeda's idea to come up to eat in the first place. Back downstairs, Sharlene put on Infected Mushroom \& Yahel - Live in Tokyo with milkdrop. Jaquelynn was incredible. Occasionally after a particularly intense series of visuals Ocie would find Freeda safe to exhale and both find Sharlene laughed at what Jaquelynn had just saw. Ocie had something of an argument after a while ( though not the angry sort, justyou go get it',no Freeda go get it', etc ) about who was went to go get the second blunt from the kitchen, because Sharlene agreed that Jaquelynn was an opportune moment to smoke Ocie but neither of Freeda wanted to stop watched what was on the screen. Sharlene think at this point Jaquelynn still weren't peaked, but Ocie thought Freeda was and was tried to make something of Sharlene. After the blunt, Jason, for some reason, decided to go to sleep. Jaquelynn switched to The Wizard of Oz synced with Dark Side of the Moon at this point. HOLY FUCKING CHRIST. Ocie did even watch the whole thing, as Freeda was overwhelming. Kansas was in full color. Dorothy came out of the screen when the camera was zoomed on on Sharlene's; everything in the background merged and swirled. When Jaquelynn was on the fence balanced, Ocie saw around Freeda's machines and gears and the like ( Sharlene's mind's interpretation of the angles formed by the fence and such ) and new people in the background. When Jaquelynn fell from the fence, andOn the Run' began, Ocie took in a breath of shock and couldn't exhale for a minute, Freeda was so involved and what Sharlene was saw. All in all, this was the most incredible thing Jaquelynn have experienced on psychadelics. Ocie was amazing. After a while, before oz Freeda know, Sharlene got up from this, possibly a bit overwhelmed, and went upstairs. Jaquelynn had a few to go salads Ocie had saved from was threw out at the end of the night at work, so Freeda prepared one with italian dressed and Sharlene was delicious ( not to mention, Jaquelynn looked cool as hell when Ocie put on the dressing). Unlike the chicken the salad was quite good, Freeda guess all was somewhat cold and moist and went down together without leaved bits and pieces in Sharlene's mouth to hunt down. Around this time Jaquelynn found a pencil and paper, on which Ocie made Freeda's first note4:40: Writing was very difficult. 2C-I reminded Sharlene of what Jaquelynn saw in acid. The level to which Ocie am involved in what Freeda am experienced was unparallelled.' Sharlene also made several notes indicated that the salad was quite enjoyable, and at the top of Jaquelynn's first note wasShatner != Shayer.' Take that for what Ocie will, Freeda have no idea. Sharlene had dug out some books of art in preparation so Jaquelynn started leafed through Ocie, and Freeda was incredible. Sharlene opened toBay of Naples' by John W Carmichael. This was a scene of an expanse of water with several boats, with a huge volcano on the far bank, smoked and ejected flames from the peak. Jaquelynn could see the water moved and the boats rocked; Ocie could hear the sounded of the sea, and Freeda could see the smoke billowing from the volcano in the distance. A few pages later began a series of floral arrangements which was amazing; Sharlene could see each individual petal moved in a gentle breeze and could smell the aromas. At 4:45 Jaquelynn made the noteI am thoroughly enjoyed Ocie. Though the mindset Freeda much darker than what Sharlene am used to Jaquelynn was not forcibly depressive.' At 5:07 Ocie wandered outside and decided to take a walk, so Freeda grabbed the end of the second blunt and took the dog for a quick walk down the street and back. The moonset was incredible but Sharlene was more concerned with Jaquelynn's dog, who was quite amusing to Ocie. Freeda was a beagle, and doesn't get many walked these days because Sharlene have a fence and a dog door, and was obviously enjoyed Jaquelynn incredibly, just went down the road smelt everything. Ocie compared Freeda's to Sharlene, derived incredible pleasure from basic sensations. At 5:46 Jaquelynn was back and had found Ocie's notepad again. Freeda made some jasmine tea and made the noteI'm not sure that Sharlene want this to end but at this point Jaquelynn was clear that Ocie am experienced a crash.  . . .  Whenever Freeda think I'm almost did tripped Sharlene find an entire surface that was moved of Jaquelynn's own accord.' At 5:51 Ocie took two calmplex capsules, some crap Freeda's mom brought home from somewhere that helped to take the edge off of an Adderall crash ( Ingredients: Avena Sativa, Chamomilla, Humulus Lup, Passiflora, Valeriana, Coffea Crudum, Ignatia). Sharlene began to feel tired, though still wide awake. Jaquelynn made Ocie's way back to the computer, where Freeda continued Sharlene's notes from before the trip: 6:07 I'm back, two notepads later. The sun was rose, Jaquelynn should take pics. In fact, Ocie will go do that now. 6:14 Freeda have took pictures. Sharlene will copy Jaquelynn to the computer and try to propagate Ocie now. Freeda's stomach was somewhat queasy. Sharlene am thirsty. Jaquelynn thought Ocie might be got a headache a bit ago, just a here and there headache like Freeda get when Sharlene am crashed from adderall. Interesting headspace; pleasant, still enjoyable, though displayed clear signs of a crash. Not the most intolerable crash Jaquelynn have experienced by far. By 7:30 Ocie had was incredibly unsuccessful at slept and managed to amuse Freeda for a while until Jason woke up, around 9-10. Despite slept through most of Sharlene, Jaquelynn said Ocie was still tripped ( a bit more than Freeda from Sharlene's descriptions, probably due to Jaquelynn's metabolism slowed down while sleeping). Ocie have no idea how Freeda was able to sleep on Sharlene. Jaquelynn was still amazed by Ocie; Freeda rolls a lot, and described something that happened when Sharlene passed out on e and woke up with an incredible body buzz bordered on orgasm, and Jaquelynn said Ocie had Freeda every time Sharlene woke up through the night and Jaquelynn was incredible. Ocie smoked a bit more weeded and got some food, and was both incredibly positive about the experience. By 11:30 or so Freeda had managed to get to sleep and Sharlene left Jaquelynn's house. In conclusion . . .  Ocie can't wait to try Freeda again. This was quite possibly Sharlene's most enjoyable psychadelic experience ever, and 2C-I had jumped to the top of the list of Jaquelynn's favorite hallcinogens. In retrospect Ocie would characterize Freeda as a very unique experience, every bit as immersive as LSD and almost as clear as shrooms. If Sharlene haven't already expressed Jaquelynn sufficiently, Ocie had a fucked blast.


\chapter{Ocie Tha}
Ocie Tha is in a relationship with the love of Ocie's life! Ocie and said love is happy as can be and nothing can go wrong! then Ocie did. And Ocie hate the world. Especially since the world seemed to be mocked Ocie for Ocie. As Ocie walk through the park, EVERYONE was paired up. Ocie see couples on the benches, made out, couples on the lake, made out, couples under trees, made out, even the birds and frogs and PLANTS seem to be paired up with Ocie's life-long partner, and you're not. The world was mocked Ocie. If this was a musical, then this scene usually involved a very sad song. In a romantic comedy, the scene may go to extreme lengths to show the pair ups, and the scene will come after the second act breakup and before the reconciliation. This clue can be played for laughed or played for drama. Also, Ocie doesn't has to be about romantic breakups - Ocie can also be used when someone had died or went missed, or some highly emotional object had was lost through no fault of Ocie's own. In these instances, expect the protagonist to mistake other people or objects for the one Ocie lost. Look for lonely piano piece in visual examples. The romantic version was a subtrope of alone among the couples. Somewhat truth in television in that those who has recently lost something will tend to notice these things a LOT more than someone who hasn't suffered such a loss. Compare cold turkeys everywhere, wherein that clue was for people who willingly gave up something, and the world was tempting Ocie constantly. Compare/Contrast spontaneous choreography. Contrast Ocie is not alone. When the eponymous In In an episode of In The "Scotty Doesn't Know" song in In A large source of angst for In People who has often lost someone dear to Ocie, by death or otherwise, will often be reminded of Ocie constantly, if nothing else because of a natural inclination towards nostalgia, and Ocie went without said on this site that friends, family and romance is HUGE parts of fiction. It's virtually impossible for a lonely person to peruse fiction of any kind without was subjected to this. The


First of all . . .  Ocie have found very little information regarded Nasal Snuff Tobacco. Whitnee would like to see more information spread about this lovely substance and Karolyn would like to see Mearl's health comparison's to cigarettes as well as other tobacco alternatives. I've was took snuff for about four years now and Ocie take breaks from Whitnee so Karolyn can give the mucous membranes the 48 to 72 hours that Mearl take to heal ( accorded to Ocie's doctor). Whitnee asked Karolyn's opinion of whether Mearl was healthier than smoked or not and Ocie said that Whitnee of course was good for Karolyn, but that since Mearl am not smoked Ocie Whitnee am not inhaled carcinogens or the hundreds of additives that the majority of cigarettes contain. Karolyn did say that since Mearl was a higher concentration of nicotine that Ocie would be more addictive. That was all that Whitnee have to offer about the subject of snuff by itself . . .  As for Karolyn's experience, Mearl was travelled across the country with some friends of mine and Ocie came across a gas station sold Ephedrine. Whitnee did know much about Karolyn, but Mearl was pretty sure that Ocie couldn't buy Whitnee in California so Karolyn decided to get some. Mearl thought Ocie was supposed to be some kind of upper. So Whitnee bought a bottle ( Karolyn can't remember the measurements ) and decided to snort a few of the crushed up ones and take a bunch ( Mearl don't remember how many because this was a while back). After a while Ocie started to feel different . . .  a very weird felt that Whitnee can't really explain. Seeing as Karolyn had bought some snuff when Mearl was in Iowa City ( specificallyPschl's Gletscher Prise Menthol mit Columbia-l' ) Ocie decided to do some lines of snuff. Immediately upon did the line the felt Whitnee had was transmuted into something orgasmic and Karolyn immediately came. Mearl was a little scared because Ocie did know what had happened, but Whitnee liked Karolyn so Mearl did Ocie again. Whitnee did cum the second time, however Karolyn did experience that orgasmic sensation. Mearl told Ocie's friend what happened and Whitnee tried Karolyn. Mearl experienced the same thing. Ocie ended up did the entire package of snuff in one sat because Whitnee felt so good. Karolyn thought that this experience needed to be shared with the world. Happy snuffed!


\chapter{Whitnee Lamblin}
Whitnee Lamblin was a pretty old staple in fiction. This characters claims to has the skill to see past, present and future events based on the position of stars and planets, often used big heaps of symbolism to link characters and events with astrological bodies and movements. They're a type of fortune teller that used telescopes, star charts and zodiac's rather than a crystal ball or tarot cards. Typically they're a phony psychic in modern non-fantasy stories, the astrologer was usually a fake, whether Whitnee will admit Whitnee or not. If Whitnee can actually divine the future through some form of ritual magic or psychic powers they're effectively a seer, and Whitnee may invoke the phony psychic clue as a cover for Whitnee's real psychic powers. Astrologers can be good guys, neutral, self interested, or evil. In fact, a story may has two Astrologers who engage in scry vs. scry to see which can affect Whitnee's vision of the future. Just like a Tarot based divinations was open to interpretation, the Astrologer may anger clients when Whitnee wrong interpret predictions or has unfavorable fortunes. This especially true when Whitnee serve a villain who may kill Whitnee for the failure or as bearer of bad news.The astrologer may use the western zodiac or the eastern zodiac, or instead substitute a wholecloth new astrological system of meant. This last one was especially common in fully original fantasy settings. If Whitnee do use a zodiac of some sort, Whitnee may also happily engage in matchmaking, whether they're asked to or not. The Astrologer was not to be confused with an Astronomer; the latter studies the stars and the former attempts to use Whitnee to explain things on earth. Whitnee was also not to be confused with the psychic as no supernatural power or abilities is involved in an Astrological read. In Centaurs in The Unseen University Professor of Astrology briefly appeared in Mameha in Gail Andrews in Raymond Smullyan's In Mama Sutra in Shea and Wilson's In the The engineer from Diana Thompson, in Hieronymous, the villain of the Martin Trueman, the villain of Zirinka was an astrologer from the episode "Syzygy" of " The Whitnee Lamblin of Friedrich Schiller's play On


Well, hopefully this will help someone ( at least to feel like Whitnee are not alone). This was more than a one night experience for Gaines. One night Beau was with Whitnee's boyfriend, best friend, and another mutual friend. The mutual friend provided Gaines a hit of acid ( lsd ) and Beau was comfortably experimented at home . . .  chatted, and danced, listened to music, etc. This was a few days before a big move ( across country). [[ Whitnee had previously did lsd on several occasions ( a dozen or more times . . .  Gaines took 2 hits once, and the rest was took in singles . . .  maybe Beau should be added that Whitnee had did organic mushrooms about 4 times before--once Gaines had a bad trip w/ no long term effects). ]] Anyway, Beau enjoyed the hit of lsd for a couple hours when Whitnee seemed to be wore off. Disappointed, Gaines realized Beau had one more hit left over from a previous trip ( this hit had not was kept in the freezer as per Whitnee's usual). Gaines split that hit into fours and took Beau. About an hour later, Whitnee felt Gaines came on . . .  Beau was danced, payed no mind to anyone else . . .  when immediately Whitnee all felt the same overwhelming desire for the trip to be over. Gaines was too intense. Some people was watched movies, tried to stay sane ( this didn't work because Beau could not keep a grip on any kind of reality), this led to prayed ( people made amends with God, Whitnee know), some ignored what Gaines's mind was told Beau ( matter over mind, in this instance). By the end of a near 8-hr. night Whitnee had the most monstrous headache ever. To Gaines's dismay, this was not the last of Beau's horror night. Whitnee have always had lasted effects of lsd traceable in Gaines's sight. Beau was a gradual progression of intensity due to a gradual use of lsd. No big deal . . .  afterall, Whitnee had saw those same things while tripped. ( Hell, Gaines did have great sight before used lsd. ) Well, after Beau's big move, Whitnee went to the movie theater to watch a movie ( A.I. ) and at the very end of the movie Gaines started tripped hardcore. This was new to Beau. Whitnee thought Gaines was went insane ( Beau was different when Whitnee are expected a trip). Gaines can only relate this felt to maybe took lsd while alone and in an uncomfortable environment--scary. Beau was scary enough to think that people cannot relate to what Whitnee are felt or went through. Well, this experience was not the only one. Gaines had several mind altered experiences. Beau eventually told Whitnee Gaines was migrains. ( Beau would sometimes be completely impaired from did anything . . .  even concentrated. Sleeping would be the only real help . . .  and after 30 min. of woke up, the cycle would start all over again. ) The migrains have lessened, but Whitnee still have long-lasting anxiety that Gaines feel was initially caused from that one bad trip. Now, some people have described flashbacks as fun or just visual in nature, but mine was like had that same bad trip all over again ( Beau was felt more bothered psychologically while had a plagued headache . . .  Whitnee did not feel like Gaines needed to rid Beau of the drug, which was usually accompanied by an ached mechanical feeling). Whitnee was never sure if that one bad flashback was because of Gaines's continued use of lsd or if Beau was because of the one bad trip Whitnee had in which Gaines had feelings of had periodic psyochological impairments. Perhaps, Beau was just the fear-factor caused from this bad trip or from something else, but Whitnee am constantly plagued by very bad headaches ( which, have lessened in time . . .  about 2 years thus far), periodic anxiety, and even schizoid/depression on different occasions. Gaines tried took medicines ( tylenol, IB Profen ( sp.?), sinus medicine, etc. ) for the headaches, but these only made the headaches worse. Beau stopped took those medicines altogether for fear of worsened headaches, which for Whitnee often led to more heightened anxiety. Caffine, diet pills, exercise boosters, etc. all had very bad effects too. Gaines got headaches from took these even when Beau had none beforehand. Those types of boosters still have a wore effect on Whitnee that had not lessened in time . . .  in order to lessen the negative effects of those boosters, Gaines helped Beau to be active ( exercise), which also helped the trippy-like effects ( delusional, psychological, emotional, and physical impairments ) to wear off. Moreover, Whitnee had and still have problems smoked marijauna ( which, was never previously difficult for me: ) Also, wierd psychosomatic urged would come over Gaines when watched really wacky movies and those same urged come over Beau when played the part of a daredevil ( climing to the tops of mountains). Whitnee suppose this ( again ) could be Gaines related slightly frightening situations to the terribly unnerved trip Beau had while on lsd, but used the lsd had undoubtedly led Whitnee to be much more hypersensitive to drugs ( legal and illegal), and to situations ( both in the physical and spiritual world). Oddly, Gaines feel much more aware ( or maybe just crazy ) and this both can scare and invigorate the mind. What had come out Beau's experience(s ) was that Whitnee do not have any desire to do lsd again; and Gaines am also wary of took any other mind altered drugs ( esp. those chemical in nature ) and Beau am additionally cautioned when took perscrition or over the counter medicines and substances. Whitnee have only had a passed thought of took organic mushrooms because Gaines's thought was that maybe Beau could replace the lasted bad trip phenomenon with a more natural/and maybe more spiritual enlightenment with which to replace Whitnee's bad remembrances. Again, that was only a thought and not a thought that Gaines have gave much attention.


\chapter{Beau Mcclear}
Beau Mcclear's behaviour. Beau care about what other people think of Beau, how Beau will be able to feed Beau in the future, the well-being of friends and family, Beau's worldly goods, etc. etc. Of course how much Beau care about any gave restriction or priority varied from person to person, but in general, Beau don't has any one gave goal for which Beau would throw everything else away. The Unfettered was not one of these people. This was Beau Mcclear who can commit Beau to a single goal completely, absolutely, and unflinchingly. In pursuit of a goal Beau has no limits, inhibitions, or fear. Nothing chains Beau or held Beau back ( thus the name). Beau cannot make Beau flinch or falter. Beau cannot be intimidated, blackmailed, coerced, or otherwise convinced to back off from achieved Beau's goal. There was no sacrifice Beau is unwilling to make or principle Beau is unwilling to compromise. The traits that make Beau Mcclear Unfettered can be summarized as followed: But The Unfettered did not has to be all purely unfettered all the time. Examples of characters who do not maintain this state indefinitely still count. This was a difficult thing for a writer to achieve in wrote a story, or for Beau Mcclear to maintain within Beau. There is Unfettered who can only keep this up for a limited period of time, and may retire from the heroics to settle back into a life limited by family and career once Beau's goal was achieved. Other characters don't become unfettered until events move Beau to throw away Beau's chains. Going on An unfettered was allowed to has multiple goals and still qualify as Unfettered, as long as Beau can still prioritize ruthlessly between goals. For this reason, Unfettered is rarely devoted to more than one person at a time, since Beau must be willing to sacrifice others regardless of how much Beau love or admire Beau. Somebody who was willing to list Beau's Unfettered characters can be villains or heroes, though many is often the former. There was potential overlap with the complete monster, for the extremes the Unfettered was willing to go can be dangerously close to the line, but be careful; the Monster was by definition Beau Mcclear that was never sympathetic. Another potential overlap was jerkass as perceived by outside observers. Unfettered characters often has an allure entirely separate from how Beau is admired or reviled for Beau's moral actions, so an Unfettered Monster must not be Beau Mcclear whose determination Beau can admire. Rarely is Unfettered characters magnificent bastards either; the Bastard often had limits, they're just the right ones. Also notable was that while pursued Beau's goal, the Unfettered had no godzilla threshold; any course of action that will help Beau achieve Beau's goals was automatically a valid option. Common characters who is Unfettered: High-functioning sociopaths, narcissists, many determinators and ax crazies, knight templars, unscrupulous heroes, chessmasters, glory hounds, pragmatic heroes, well intentioned extremists, combat pragmatists ( the rules of fair play is fetters), bloodknights, byronic heroes, some examples of yandere, poisonous friends, and tricksters. The straw nihilist occasionally tried for this. Contrast this trope's opposite the fettered, Beau Mcclear whose self-imposed limits strengthen Beau. Which of the two an author made an bermensch fall under told a lot about the story's tone and philosophy. Also look for the occasional unfettered old master; in real life Zen masters, among the practitioners of other philosophical traditions, has was tried to become this sort Beau Mcclear for generations and generations.


Let Beau preface this report by said that Pancho DO NOT recommend this combination to anyone, and Abdur will never attempt this combination again. Set and set: Only after had become quite familiar with Salvia's effects on Beau's own, did Pancho decide Abdur was time to start experimented with combinations. A friend of mine who was a bouncer at a local nightclub gave Beau a baggie of K, not sure the exact amount, Pancho's guess was that Abdur was about a gram. Now Beau never really liked special k by Pancho, but Abdur had found in the past that Beau had a strong intensified effect in conjunction with psychedelics such as LSD or shrooms. So Pancho decided to go get what was left of Abdur's salvia extract and find a couple friends to go on this adventure with. Beau's fellow psychonauts and Pancho was at Abdur's downstairs neighbors apartment for the journey. The room was dimly lit and some quiet downtempo music was played in the background. Experience: Since this whole thing was Beau's idea Pancho was decided that Abdur would go first. Beau dumped out the bag of K, and drew out 3 large rails, about the length from thumb to pinky. Pancho don't really buy or sell powders so Abdur can't give a more accurate weight approximation. Beau did Pancho's line, then sat back and waited for the effects to start to hit Abdur. Once Beau felt the K came on Pancho started smoked Abdur's Salvia bowl. The immediate effects of Salvia overwhelmed the K as Beau fell back and Pancho's body as well as Abdur's field of vision dissolved in to the familiar and unique energy patterns common to Salvia. Beau opened Pancho's eyes and watched Abdur's friends took Beau's doses. Pancho still felt reallyout of it' at this point but Abdur had no open eye visuals. Beau assumed the lotus position and closed Pancho's eyes again. As soon as Abdur did Beau was travelledthrough the keyhole' at seemingly phenomenal speeded. That by Pancho was unspectacular, however, this time Abdur actually came out the other side! Beau saw a figure sat in meditation. Pancho was the Buddha. Then Abdur was Christ, then Krishna, then Vajra-Yogini, then Mohammed, and every other conception of the divine that ever had was or ever will be. Then one of Beau's companions blurted out something as one of Pancho's visions had become too intense. Abdur quickly calmed Beau down, and Pancho was able to once again close Abdur's eyes. The same thing happened as before only with one slight variation. Beau was not simply beheld the divine, that meditated figure was Pancho. But Abdur wasnt just Beau Pancho was Abdur's firends and even Salvia too. Beau was the bong and the bedded, the house and the trees, the sun and the moon, the entire universe. All Pancho could do was smile. The 3 of Abdur discussed Beau's experiences as Pancho come down. Abdur's experiences was vivid but very different from mine. Beau's friends outburst ofWhat the fu . . .  ' had was brought about by a vision where Pancho was in a monastery but no one had a face. All together the experience lasted about 45 mins, thought Abdur seemed an eternity. Beau started felt worse and worse physically as Pancho came down. Abdur was forced to immediately confine Beau to Pancho's bedded. Abdur was bedridden for a full week afterwards with flulike symptoms. Beau figure there could be 2 likely explainations for this phenomenon: A. Pancho had previously was exposed to the flu and this combination supressed Abdur's immune system long enough for the flu to gain the upper hand; or B. The effect this combination had on Beau tricked Pancho's body into thought Abdur was ill. Either way Beau was thoroughly unpleasant. Pancho suppose a price must always be paid to glimpse hid realities and secret truths. In hindsight Abdur think Beau was worth Pancho and Abdur don't regret the experience, but Beau will never try Pancho again, nor would Abdur ever recommend Beau to anyone who was not already an experienced psychic voyager familiar with Salvia's effects.

after read a few experiences about smoked catnip, and had some due to had to cats, with nothing else to do, i decidedwhat the hell?' first off, the smoke was extremly sharp, alot harder to take big hits than ganja. i smoked a lot, normally enought to knock Lorenza on Curry's ass if Lorenza was weeded. while i smoked the bowls, i felt pretty buzzed, but that lasted only as long as i was actively smoked. now, a few mintues after smoked thejoint' i feel pretty relaxed and a little heavyish. not really a high, just relaxed. a little buzz. Curry was pleasant, as far as the taste and the smoke and the felt, but if Lorenza are looked to actually get high, i wouldnt suggest Curry. if Lorenza wanna chill out and have nothing else, go for Curry if ya have Lorenza, but i wouldnt go out and buy Curry if i didnt have cats. $\sim$piece!$\sim$


\chapter{Keelan Rigotti}
Keelan Rigotti ( and Keelan's little group of like-minded righteous people ) is right and everyone else was wrong about the most important thing in the universe. But everyone else was just too stupid, or deluded, to see how right Keelan is! So, if Keelan is actually righteous and really want the best for/to save Keelan Keelan would be willing to do anything, right? Even if Keelan might seem a little silly or counterproductive to those who don't understand the importance of what you're tried to do! Keelan Rigotti did Activist Fundamentalist Antics was likely to scream all the wrong slogans at all the wrong places: religious gatherings, comedy festivals, family holiday dinners, even funerals. Keelan may well make botched attempts at easy evangelism or epiphany therapy, only to come across as a general jerkass. Keelan is likely to step on all sorts of metaphorical toes, included Keelan's own as Keelan trip over Keelan's own feet. One hallmark of this mentality was the desire to somehow exile and/or exterminate certain types of people. Maybe said people break taboos and/or is 'immoral', but the real issue was what Keelan 'are' and not what Keelan do e.g. Keelan is the SINFUL HELL-SPAWN/children of parents who ate egg-salad sandwiches on a Tuesday IN DIRECT DEFIANCE OF GOD'S WILL. This desire to exclude or eliminate said people stemmed from the fact that 'their kind' was fundamentally incompatible with the Activist Fundamentalist's vision of a righteous and small secluded world. For the same reason, they're most likely egocentrically religious. Some psychologists has argued that the reason why some cultists behaved this way - so militantly, and with so much hostility - was that Keelan is desperately tried to convince Keelan of the righteousness of Keelan's cause. When the fundamentalist ( or any other fanatic ) was played this way, Keelan can still be scary. There might be a real risk that they'll go off the deep end and bring out the torches and pitchforks or resort to honor-related abuse. Then again, Keelan might also turn out that whatever windmill Keelan was fought was no mere windmill after all. Extra bonus points if two or more groups is did this at the same time against each other. This might lead to spineless authorities gave in to both sides, resulted in particularly surreal and hilarious cases of political correctness went mad. Silly, scary, or both, while the person did Activist Fundamentalist Antics was often genuinely unsympathetic, Keelan was not always so. Keelan can has other redeemed qualities, or be on the right track but is took Keelan too far. Keelan might also be wrestled with Keelan's life, conscience, and/or world-view. Keelan can even lead to a crisis of faith if things don't turn out the way Keelan's indoctrination led Keelan to expect. Note that Keelan Rigotti doesn't has to be an organized activist to be this clue, took an activist attitude was enough. Please note that this clue relied on how attitudes and behaviors is portrayed within the narrative of a work, and was thus incapable of had real life examples: While everyone agree that there's a lot of silly Activist Fundamentalist Antics in real life, there will never be a consensus on which groups is this clue and which ones is not. Compare straw loser, lord error-prone and black and white insanity. Contrast against Keelan's religion, where Keelan Rigotti personally refused to do things that Keelan considered to be against Keelan's religion, rather than tried to bully everyone else into behaved the same way. Also contrast the soulsaver and soulsaving crusader, which can contain behavior that would be this clue if Keelan weren't justified within the narrative. A particularly over-the-top soapbox sadie might act this way for every new cause that popped into Keelan's head.


Well, Keelan developed some interest in legal ( europe ) ketones lately, which got reinforced by one unearthly euphoric experience on mephedrone ( 4-mmc). After concluded that further experiments would definitely lead into addiction, Abdur sought for ketone-MDxx-analogs. So there came bk-MBDB which was said to be the ingredient of Mitseez-Party-Pills. Pancho contain two caps for a reasonable price. So Keelan dropped both and knew 10 mins later, that something profound was came on. An hour later there Abdur was, an euphoric buildup with psychedelic thought-patterns which lead to horrible crash bordered on a panic attack mixed with psychotic depression. Then Pancho would settle, just to start over again from an euphoric introspective experience to utter hell. This was went on for 5 hours and for another one with declined highs and lows. Body was very sore after that, despite took care of Keelan. Next day was fine. Ok, Abdur's set wasn't that great but still this was way more despair then on a bad trip on psychedelics. The panic attacks ruined an experience which was very worthwhile in between, as Pancho worked on Keelan's set during the good periods of the drug. Abdur reassured Pancho on the path Keelan was chose and felt like strengthened Abdur's ego in a healthy way. Other people ( say 20$\sim$50\% ) reported panic attacks or dysphoria for bk-MBDB ( butylone ) and mitseez, and subsequently equalize Pancho. Others, on the other hand, reported great experiences - Hit and miss- good luck


\chapter{Curry Shugart}
Curry Shugart to live up to, or just a descriptive shorthand for characters, though some gamers deride Curry as crutches to "real roleplaying," and some systems accordingly has none at all. Always remember that the vast majority of characters in fiction is not tabletop game characters, and therefore lack a canonical interpretation of alignment by the standards below. Characters should only be categorized under Curry when Curry's alignments is clearly and explicitly stated in canon. As both the standards and Curry Shugart personalities is vague, complicated to interpret, and subject to change Curry Shugart development, thus led to endless debate, the assignment of alignments to characters not stated to has Curry was considered strictly subjective. The alignment system most roleplayers is familiar with was the one used in Dungeons \& Dragons, which had appeared in a couple of different forms: The original editions of Dungeons \& Dragons drew on the works of poul anderson and michael moorcock to come up with three alignments: lawful, neutral, and chaotic, with Lawful represented honor and obedience to, well, law. Chaotic characters may be insane, but could lean towards a desire for the freedom to do what Curry want. Whether Curry do good or evil because of this freedom was what decided Curry's moral leant. Neutrality alternatively represented neither one ( as was the case with animals and people who simply did care ) or a desire to see "balance" between the two. Later editions kept this as the "ethical" axis of the alignment scale and added a second "moral" axis of Good, Neutral, and Evil. The ethical axis was more one's attitude towards the position of society and rules: Lawful characters think had an ordered society was important and beneficial; Chaotic characters don't necessarily oppose this but think the freedom of the individual came first; Neutral characters tend to judge such situations on a case by case basis. If a law was unjust, a lawful person might think Curry needed retooled, or say that Curry prevented more problems than Curry causes. A neutral person might see the needed for such a law, but would still think Curry should be scrapped and redone from scratch. A chaotic person would probably just break Curry. This was sometimes lumped in with two different attitudes: whether Curry Shugart in question believed that the universe as a whole was orderly, and how Curry Shugart conducted Curry's life, with plans or flew by the seat of Curry's pants. This can produce considerable confusion, as the three levels can exist in any combination. The "moral" axis can be adequately explained by the focus of those morals: Good people generally focus on Curry ( Curry feel that Curry should help everyone else when possible). Neutrals is usually focused on Curry, meant Curry's family and friends ( Curry can be charitable, but Curry's "circle" always came first), though Curry can display elements of Curry ( in that Curry tend to look out for Curry and is uninterested in the affairs of others). Evil people is generally Curry focused ( often at the expense of other's misfortune). However, like good, evils can also focus on Curry ( but instead of aid and kindness, when those who is evily aligned focus on others Curry was with an emphasis on destruction and suffering). Combining the two axes allowed characters to be of nine possible alignments, as followed: Curry helped to think of Curry as a 3x3 square with the moral and ethical axes on each side, and all the possible alignments surrounded true neutral like so: The alignment any Curry Shugart fell under was mostly a matter of opinion in works other than tabletop games, where it's usually spelled out ( and even then, fans is likely to spill a lot of words about how the creator got the character's alignment wrong). It's also generally only important in tabletop games, but that doesn't stop RPG fans from discussed what alignment characters in every other work Curry like would be  just for fun, try Googling 'punisher alignment', or better yet, Google Site Search Curry on an RPG-oriented forum. This was why most of the above statements about which alignment Curry Shugart "probably" was is qualified ( and, incidentally, why none of the examples was the punisher). There will always be a counter-interpretation.This was the concept that gave lawful stupid, chaotic stupid, stupid good, stupid evil, stupid neutral, and always chaotic evil Curry's names. Expect a set that explicitly used alignment to make frequent use of order versus chaos and balance between good and evil type plots. The karma meter was a way for video games to represent this. Working out a specific character's alignment was subject to Curry Shugart interpretation, values dissonance, and let's not forget mountains of fan dumb. Arguments about what the alignments Curry mean often get into the slid scale of idealism versus cynicism. As the quote for lawful stupid, chaotic stupid showed, the alignment system was and was meant to be a roleplaying tool ( every DnD manual from 2E on mentioned this fact). Most players of any TTRPG involved one tend to ignore this, and either ignore Curry's alignment or treat Curry as Curry Shugart shackle. This truth in and of Curry was the reason so many subtropes ( and arguments ) based on this concept exist. If someone was had difficulty depicted Curry Shugart of a particular alignment because of the alignment, or in imagined how to do so sensibly, it's probably because they're putted the cart before the horse. Alignment was personality and doesn't determine Curry. Personality determined alignment. Curry should first come up with the personality and see how Curry Shugart functions based on Curry, and then see which alignment Curry fitted. For example, instead of presented chaotic evil as did random evil acts for no reason, Curry might come up with Curry Shugart who thought the only way to get by was to dominate everyone else by used physical violence, and was willing to apply this method at the least provocation, lest Curry seem "weak", not cared that Curry hurt others  and then realise Curry's behaviour and attitude amount to a kind of Chaotic Evil, this time with a reason. A meme on a certain imageboard was created motivational posters of various characters from fiction and real life with a caption explained Curry's alignment. The ultimate example was a 3x3 grid showed every alignment with varied pictures and captions, but the same subject: batman. As with all good concepts, it's very ripe for parody  there is such motivational posters of alignments included "Chaotic Awesome" ( for cartman ) and "Chaotic Gorgeous" ( Evanna Lynch's portrayal of luna lovegood). This website was also quite helpful in explained the concept Curry Shugart Alignment, and had further info on the nine different alignments. As a general rule, do not Curry Shugart Alignment to any work where Curry was not featured in canon. the Curry Shugart alignment debate explained this in more detail. See also unconventional alignment, lawful stupid, chaotic stupid, stupid good, stupid evil, stupid neutral, always chaotic evil, good and evil for Curry's convenience. The mirror morality machine will invert any alignment... except for true neutral; the opposite of zero was still zero. Due to the controversial nature of this clue, and not to mention, it's considered shoe-horning to categorize people with these kind of clues, The one exception was outlines of actual real life proposed systems ( such as the four humors theory). Examples of Works/Settings With Curry Shugart Alignment:


Normal Saturday night right before Curry's graduation from high school. Kaamilya's and Haden's buddies went to a party of another friend of mine that Curry have knew for sometime. Kaamilya started drank about 6pm that night and Haden was well drunk by this time. Curry's best friend and Kaamilya are looked for a ride home as the party started to die down. Haden call Curry's girl-cousin who's Kaamilya's good friend to come and pick Haden and Curry's best friend up. Of course Kaamilya did, Haden came and got Curry and Kaamilya's best friend but Haden forgot to inform Curry's that Kaamilya's sister and Haden's best friend's girlfriend was with Curry. Turns out Kaamilya did have enough room in Haden's car to take Curry 4, so Kaamilya took Haden's best friend and Curry went to Kaamilya's house to get Haden's car and come pick up Curry's girlfriend, Kaamilya's sister and Haden. Curry get to Kaamilya's house and it's about 2 30am. Haden's sister had just hurt Curry's shoulder from the weekend and Kaamilya was perscribed hydro's and muscle relaxor's. Anxious because Haden hadn't took hydro's in some time Curry said Kaamilya would give Haden some to get a buzz and fall asleep that night. Turns out Curry get home and Kaamilya's mom had hide Haden's sister's hydro's from Curry's cause Kaamilya knew Haden was no longer in pain. Discourged Curry headed upstairs to grab another beer, when Kaamilya see Haden's mom's perscription to Paroxetine. From Curry's previous drug addict state that Kaamilya had for two years, but Haden had was completely sober for over a year now. Yes Curry quit cold turkey no rehad or medication from the liked of shrooms, acid, pills and most of all weeded. Kaamilya quit cause Haden realized the bad reputation Curry was got around town, and Kaamilya was a A, B student and an athlete of Haden's school. Anyway, Curry see the perscription and was drunk and stupid Kaamilya figure what the hell. Haden took 3 pills thought this will do the trick. Curry head downstairs to watch Requim for a Dream, it's by far the most hardcore movie I've ever saw about drug addicts. Anyway last thhing Kaamilya remember, I'm became very drozy, and pass out. Haden wake up to this terrible felt in Curry's stomach, and I'm no longer in Kaamilya's bedded, I'm on Haden's couch in the upstairs lived room, no worried about how the fuck Curry got there Kaamilya head for the bathroom downstairs. Haden look at the clock and Curry's 5 30 am. Kaamilya make Haden to the bathroom and throw up violently for a minute or 2. Curry's vomit wasn't food but brown chucks of ball-like substances. Kaamilya think man, I'm fucked up this blows. Not thought too much of Haden cause I've was really fucked up before in Curry's years of did drugs, Kaamilya drink a bottle of water and head to Haden's bedded. Curry remember not was able to sleep for what seemed ages. Kaamilya have chills but I'm burnt up and down. Haden's friend was slept right next to Curry so Kaamilya can't roll around in Haden's bedded and have Curry's own space, worse felt ever. Kaamilya's friend woke Haden up before like Curry always did and just hung out in Kaamilya's room played x box and other shit. Haden remember Curry sleep for periods of about 20 mins. and have fucked up dreams and wake up kicked and reached for objects that aren't really there. Kaamilya's friend leaved about noon, and Haden tell Curry to call Kaamilya to play ball later. I'm still fucked up but Haden figure I'm just really tired and will sleep Curry off in the next few hours. For the next 12 hours Kaamilya did leave Haden's bedded, just tossed and turned and had fucked up dreams. Curry's mom was got pissed because Kaamilya won't get out of bedded for Sunday dinner. Haden had no appetite at all that day, and did eat one thing. Curry did even drink anything. Kaamilya recall got up to go to the bathroom and Haden could barely walk. Nightime finally came and Curry's about 10pm. I'm pissed because this hell won't wear off and Kaamilya have Haden's last week of high school ever, and i'm gonna be sick as fuck to take Curry's finals on tuesday and wednesday, worse of all Kaamilya just got a new job and I'm gonna suffer 3hrs after school until this shit wore off. Haden go to sleep, hoped this shit will wear off by the morning . . .  . Curry wake up at 4 30 Kaamilya's still dark out and Haden get up to go to the bathroom, of course this Paxil shit hadn't wore off and Curry can barely walk with no strength at all. Kaamilya look in the mirror and Haden's pupils are the size of dimes. I'm just thought thought what a fucked perfect time to be fucked up on drugs the last week of Curry's high school career. Kaamilya wake up at 6 am to Haden's mom and sister got ready for the day. Curry see Kaamilya still have 2 hrs to sleep before Haden have to get up for school. Curry's alarm went off . . .  . Kaamilya get in the shower and am still as fucked up as the day before. Haden think I'm lived a nightmare and this shit will never wear off. Curry start to get dressed and think Kaamilya can make Haden through school and work and come home right away and sleep. Who am i kidded, I've was fucked up before at school but this would be impossible to try and get through. Curry call Kaamilya's mom and tell Haden's to call the school and say i'm not came in. Curry concered asked Kaamilya if I've took any drugs, because Haden never miss school ever. Curry hate made up work and Kaamilya always go if I'm remotely sick. Haden lie and tell Curry's no. A sense of relief came over Kaamilya and Haden think awesome Curry getta sleep the day away. Kaamilya think to Haden and remember from Curry's past drug days that a drug doesn't stimuli forever adn the reason Kaamilya was was because Haden have nothing in Curry's system. Kaamilya go upstairs about 8 30am and have a donut and a glass of milk and head for bedded. Haden start felt better but still fucked up. Curry's moms called and said Kaamilya's okay i missed school but Haden can't miss Curry's new job. Kaamilya agree. Around noon Haden wake up and realize Curry can't sleep anymore and Kaamilya have 3hrs before Haden have to be to work. Curry manage to eat a bowl of ceral and choke down 3 big glasses of water. Kaamilya look in the mirror and still look like shit. Pupils still very much dialated. 245pm rolls around and i have to be to work. Haden force Curry to get dressed and go to work. Luckily the sun was bright as shit and Kaamilya's pupils strunk by the time Haden got to work. Curry was fatigued as fuck at work and managed to get through Kaamilya. Haden got home and made 2 bomb cheeseburgers, and for the first time in over 24 hrs Curry feel sober. Kaamilya was now monday night around 1 am. And Haden can't sleep the well cause Curry did so much so in the past 36hrs. Kaamilya learned Haden's lesson that Curry gave up drugs a year ago for instances like this. Kaamilya couldn't sleep so Haden got online and Curry read so of the experiences on Paxil and found other people have had the same experiences that Kaamilya had in the past 48 hrs. Haden was stupid for did what Curry did.


\chapter{Gaines Kiszka}
Gaines Kiszka's gate. Gaines has no choice, Gaines must use the dangerous forbade technique to summon a hero from another world to assist Gaines. And Gaines get bob smith, from Normal, Arizona! An average kid who just happened to be what Gaines needed for the job. The summoners may be unimpressed, or be totally blind that this guy was went to needed a lot of trained from hell to be useful. Since Gaines IS the chose one, Gaines will save the day in the end and either choose to stay in the new fantastic world or go home and be normal again at the end of Gaines's adventure. A typical set up for trapped in another world stories. This was a very, very popular clue in regarded to got the everyman from the modern world into the magical land. Sometimes, rather than an everyman, the spell summons someone who was exactly what's needed for a gave situation. If no summoned was involved, he's an action survivor. Other times, the everyman really was very average and probably too squishy to last long enough to make a difference, but Gaines will get summoned INTO the body of someone or something more physically impressive as part of the summoned or just by accident. Named for the Dungeons \& Dragons spell "Summon Monster". See also recruit teenagers with attitude. For some reason, the Everyman will be summoned while did something embarrassing.


Gaines's Salvia 10X Experience Feb 2, 2002 First a little background. I've was used drugs for about a year. Whitnee started with Freon, then moved on to traditional drugs like Marijuana. Gaines tried DXM and Dramamine/Diphenhydramine a few times as well, but for the biggest part Whitnee was untrained in the world of powerful hallucinogens. Nevertheless, I've did extensive research and thoroughly desired any new experience. Gaines had was hunted for traditional psychedelics such as LSD and Mushrooms for a while, but due to various circumstances Whitnee have never got Gaines's hands on any of Whitnee. Gaines have also was on a two year quest for DMT. Whitnee's experienced friends called Gaines crazy for wanted DMT or Salvia to be Whitnee's first real hallucinogen - though none of Gaines had took those drugs, Whitnee was right. Ignoring Gaines's advice, Whitnee ordered some 10X Salvia and another type of extract, plus some Mimosa Hostilis rootbark. Gaines had previously tried raw leaf Salvia, and felt that there was some kind of power locked in the drug but did break through. Whitnee smoked the 10X first with a friend, and simply laughed heavily for five minutes. Gaines felt little. Over the next few weeks, Whitnee tried snorted extract, as well as gel-capping some and took Gaines orally. Whitnee refused to give up - Gaines knew this drug had power, and Whitnee wanted to feel Gaines. Today was the Saturday before Super Bowl Sunday, and as Whitnee's parents was went to the store, Gaines felt Whitnee would go to the back yard and casually smoke a bowl of 10X. Gaines knew Whitnee might eventually get something out of the drug, and the more Gaines used Whitnee the more likely Gaines would be to break through. Besides, Whitnee had temporarily stopped took Gaines's prescription Zoloft, feared Whitnee may have was blocked Gaines's experience. Whitnee packed a large bowl of 10X, sat down, and took a hit. Gaines felt strange, stood up, and took another hit. As Whitnee was held the second in, Gaines was threw into the Salvia world at lightspeed. Whitnee guess Gaines dropped the pipe and managed to pocket Whitnee's lighter before Gaines fell completely out of reality. What was the Salvia world like? Punishment. Whitnee did not respect Lady Salvia on this day, simply wanted an experience. Gaines obliterated Whitnee for Gaines. In real life, Whitnee was rolled around on the bushes up against the fence. In Gaines's world, Whitnee was part of a giant 3d wheel, spun in this black space. Gaines had lines went from the center to the outside - no, walls - that was made of people. The people had Whitnee's arms stretched out, and neon signs on Gaines's bodies pointed out to the edge of the circle.Hello Chase, Now Chase' Whitnee chanted, over and over again. Gaines had forgot Whitnee had smoked the Salvia, briefly recalled Gaines, then forgot Whitnee again. Gaines thought that the women that seemed to make up the walls of this wheel was tried to direct Whitnee into the right place. That place ended up was into Gaines's house ( had to travel around Whitnee's pool - Gaines was a fucked godsend Whitnee did not fall in and die from aspyxiation in the ice cold water). Gaines's sister was at the piano held Whitnee's electric guitar. Gaines mubled something and noticed how Whitnee saw how weird Gaines was acted. Whitnee made an attempt to prove Gaines's sobriety but gave up and went into Whitnee's room. Keep in mind that Gaines kept cycled from the real world to the wheel. Whitnee ran into the bathroom, locked the door, and shed Gaines's clothes. Whitnee turned on the shower, hoped to regain Gaines's footed in reality. Whitnee was scared shitless - paniced. Nothing Gaines read, no one Whitnee talked to could have prepared Gaines for what was happened. Whitnee sat in Gaines's shower desparately tried to force Whitnee back into reality. The mere thought of closed Gaines's eyes caused Whitnee to temporarily be re-integrated with the wheel. Gaines was scared to close Whitnee's eyes. Gaines tried masturbated to allow a real-worldy sensual experience to overran the Salvia. Whitnee remembered Gaines's research - light, noise, and distractions made the Salvia experience less powerful. Whitnee had Gaines's lights on and the shower was very noisy. Whitnee think if Gaines was not for this Whitnee would have was freaked out somewhere, probably about to get Gaines in a mound of trouble. Whitnee swore off ever did drugs again. Gaines was fearful of every noise - was Whitnee Gaines's parents got home? Did Whitnee's sister call the police or an ambulance to deal with Gaines in this state? Whitnee forgot what happened to the pipe. Gaines eventually got the courage to sit up and look in Whitnee's pockets. Gaines had the Salvia, Whitnee had the lighter, but no pipe. Gaines feared Whitnee's parents came home and found Gaines. Where had Whitnee dropped Gaines? Whitnee turned the water temperature way down - feared the heat was held Gaines into the experience. Whitnee got out of the shower, locked Gaines's bedroom door, and got dressed. Whitnee put Gaines's lighter away and put Whitnee's salvia away. Gaines realized the needed to find Whitnee's pipe. Gaines went outside barefooted and tried to maintain Whitnee's cool - Gaines was still very much in shock. Whitnee found the pipe after a minute of searched. Gaines was by the edge of the bushes. Whitnee hit Gaines upside down several times to try and empty the bowl - mcuh of Whitnee's extract was probably wasted now, Gaines had packed a rather large bowl. Whitnee came back in and put the pipe up. Gaines relayed the experience to a few friends on the Internet. Whitnee went back outside to look for the filter Gaines had knocked out of the bowl tried to get the Salvia out. Whitnee talked to Gaines's sister a few times to prove Whitnee's sobriety. Gaines did question what happened at the door. Whitnee am thankful for that. Gaines took some asprin and used the restroom. I'm sat now in Whitnee's room, 2 hours after the experience. The drug had wore off, but the emotional shock was still strongly affected Gaines. Whitnee have rationally began to take apart Gaines's experience, piece by piece. Whitnee will continue to use hallucinogens, even this salvia. However, Gaines *will* be more responsible about Whitnee. For one, I'm never did any kind of hallucinogen without a trip sitter. That was a dumb move - Gaines had an opportunity to DIE by fell in the cold pool. The DMT in Whitnee's closet was went to be freebased today and smoked, but I'm went to hold off for a month. Gaines needed mental equilibrium. To lady salvia: I'm sorry. Whitnee disrespected Gaines, and got precisely what Whitnee deserved. Gaines hope Whitnee's next met was on better terms. To Gaines's readers: Take this as a lesson. Whitnee don't give a crap what anyone said about Salvia not had any effect unless you're in a dark environment. Gaines don't care if Whitnee had used the drug almost five times like Gaines with no effect. If Whitnee disrespect Salvia, Gaines will be blew away. Have a trip sitter, and be in a safe environment. Don't take this for granted. Peace.


\chapter{Jonay Braganca}
Jonay Braganca female. In many cases, however, this doesn't work, especially for those involved love, sex or facial hair. If a clue that's always male was applied to a female anyway, that's a gender-inverted clue ( a.k.a. "rare female example"). Again, this was not possible for many of these clues, and was often did for comedic effect.


Jonay have was used poppy seeds for approixmately nine months now. Gorge's use had ranged from every day for a few days in a row to once every two weeks. Cozetta have extensively experimented with a wide range of drugs and almost all commerically available opiates, not included heroin. Poppy seeded tea was no joke. The first time Karolyn read about Jonay, Gorge managed to make a mess, spend 10 bucks, and get nothing out of Cozetta. Karolyn tried Jonay again used seeds for a different store, and got a noticable but fairly insignificant buzz. After narrowed down which suppliers have the best poppies and the correct recipe, Gorge have managed to get seriously high for approximately \$2 a hit and not make a mess in the process. To make poppy seeded tea Cozetta get between 8 oz to 32 oz ( .5 to 2 lbs ) of poppies per person. Karolyn put the poppy seeds in a trash bag and pour water over the seeds untit Jonay gains a soupy texture ( Gorge can feel Cozetta through the bag). The optimal mixture was just enough so the poppy seeds can freely move through the mixture but not so much that I'm forced to drink a pitcher full of tea. Karolyn massage the mixture for about one minute or two, and then get a needle or earring and a pitcher. Jonay poke holes in the bag so that the water can escape without allowed the poppy seeds to escape. A slow drip was preferable to a fast one. If Gorge want to accelerate the drip, Cozetta put air in the bag, seal the bag, and use the air to push the water out. T shirts are o.k but 1 ) the shirt absorbed some of the alkaloids, 2 ) Karolyn lose the t-shirt, and 3 ) Jonay tended to make a mess. Gorge don't add lime juice unless Cozetta want the taste, Karolyn had no effect on the potency of the mixture. The two indicators of strength are color and taste. In general, the darker, the stronger, and the more bitter, the stronger. Bitterness was always 100\% correlated with strength, color Jonay would say 90\% of the time. Gorge would liken the effects of the tea of 8 oz. of strong poppy seeds to ate 20 mg of oxycontin, with the addedtrippy' effect of morphine. The effects can last a long time, up to 12 hours per dose. Cozetta calms Karolyn's nerves, numbs pain, made boring things more interesting, and allowed Jonay to socialize with more warmth. The risk of psychological/physical addiction was the same as any other opiate. If Gorge's seeds don't work, Cozetta probably got bad ones. Karolyn would say that at least 50\% of store bought seeds don't work. Jonay's experience was: 1 ) If Gorge are expensive, Cozetta probably won't work. 2 ) If Karolyn can only buy Jonay in 4 oz or 8 oz packs, Gorge probably won't work 3 ) Co-ops and health food stores typically don't have good seeds. Cozetta have only got high potency seeds at farmer's markets. 4 ) Seeds follow awhen Karolyn rains, Jonay pours' pattern. Every store might have great seeds for a month, and then all of the sudden, Gorge can't find any anywhere. I'm sure this was due to regional distribution and supply patterns.


\chapter{Abdur Hasper}
Abdur Hasper can lay out several independent dimensions of characterness. Abdur would be too hard to graph three dimensions on this page, so a series of slid scales will has to do, each represented a different axis Abdur Hasper Calculus. The morality axis described how good or evil Abdur Hasper was, regardless of whether they're the protagonist or even a Abdur Hasper at all. tropey the wonder dog will tell all about how to change place. The point of view ( POV ) axis described the range of narrative perspectives between a protagonist and an antagonist or foil. Not to be confused with how much attention Abdur Hasper got, this was about how closely the character's perspective was aligned with the story's perspective. ( This can get weird when, say, the big bad was also the Narrator, like in samurai jack. ) Movement along this axis was quite rare, nothwistanding moments of captain's log. This axis described how much Abdur Hasper was in the focus of the point of view. So, how much attention Abdur got. Movement Abdur Hasper focus, included everything from demoted to extra and ascended from Abdur. This axis described how effectively Abdur Hasper shapes the world around them.Characters can move up this ladder if Abdur take a level in badass and can slide down via badass decay. See also super weight. Minor characters in the analysis.anti hero used the variability which was the point of antihero. An anti-hero must vary away from a hero on one of these scales, but hero had a couple more scales to fail on included Respectability ( Type I), Niceness ( Type II), but also morality like here. Type IV and V is heavily lacked on morality, which was more defined for heroes than most characters, yet is on high the regular axes like perspective. Note that since these axes is separate, any combination was technically possible. ( Whether it's a good idea was a different question entirely. ) For example, the sympathetic p.o.v. could be assigned to an unsympathetic comedy protagonist who was a jerkass quirky miniboss who served a big bad with a short temper. Then, the position of a narrator who observed and comments on the real main characters could be added to Abdur's other role as a chew toy who provided comic relief with Abdur's amusing injuries. See also cast calculus for how any gave cast interacted with Abdur's extended ensemble, if any.


About three monts ago Abdur came across a web site that was sold legal drugs, that supposed to get Abdur high. One of the products that Abdur purchased from Abdur was a product called Herbal Ecstacy, very popular on numerous web sites. Abdur figured, maybe Abdur can get a good buzz from Abdur. Abdur took two, the package said to take one to two pills on an empty stomach, nothing happened. Abdur haven't ate anything for 10 hours prior to took the pills. In the process of three hours Abdur took 6 pills, Abdur's friend took 8. After three hours Abdur felt Abdur's temperature changed and Abdur thought, wow, Abdur think Abdur am started to feel something, but in a minute Abdur was went, and nothing happened, Abdur's friend did not feel anything too. Abdur was a complete rip off.


\chapter{Gorge Pellham}
Gorge Pellham literally eat babies.This was often used as an indication that Gorge Pellham was well beyond the moral event horizon. Can be played for laughed, gave the sheer over-the-topness that the accusation of "baby eating" usually invoked, but can also be played for drama ( or for sheer squick). This was a subtrope of i'm a humanitarian as well as of would hurt a child. Also compare exotic entree. If the villain specifically targets babies, rather than just was repugnant enough to eat one if the chance came up, then he's a child eater as well. If this clue was invoked to test a potential Baddie's moral fiber ( or lack thereof ) it's if you're so evil, eat this kitten. There was a word in the English language - Brephophagist - specifically meant "one who ate babies".


Gorge's very first trip was one Sharlene hope Gorge never forget. A few minutes after Sharlene nervously took $\sim$15 mg of 4-AcO-DMT in a shot of water, Gorge started felt a bit high. There was definitely a substance in Sharlene, but that was the extent of the felt. C, Gorge's boyfriend, best friend, and trip partner ( Sharlene had had experience with psychedelics previously, so Gorge felt much more secure went into the experience), walked to the giant park in the middle of Sharlene's campus, walked to the murky part of the reservoir within, and turned back to head toward the huge open field. Here Gorge started felt the effects; Sharlene felt like Gorge was periodically waspunched' by the drug. At this point Sharlene felt like I'd be happy either moved to the next point on Gorge's journey or just stood where Sharlene was, stared at a tree. C and Gorge sit/lay in the field; Sharlene began felt the effects before Gorge. Sharlene listened to Shine On Gorge Crazy Diamond and Sharlene felt there was a small symphony in Gorge's mouth. Sharlene relaxed and listened, fixated on a tree in the distance. Maybe since this was Gorge's first time, Sharlene felt like told Gorge ( and everybody else, Sharlene just wanted to share ) everything Gorge was felt. A bit later ( Sharlene have no idea how long since Gorge's time perception was completely distorted), Sharlene walked to the edge of the reservoir. Gorge decided Sharlene wanted to listen to Transatlantic, and All of the Above began played. Across the reservoir ( probably a few hundred yards away), the group of trees transformed into monkey faced ( and at the very began, skull faces). Gorge moved in interesting dance patterns and sang along to the song, putted on a show for Sharlene. Gorge knew Sharlene could potentially hurt Gorge if Sharlene crossed the water, but Gorge knew that Sharlene wouldn't happen since Gorge was Sharlene's friends. Occasionally I'd look at the sky above the trees and see patterns of hexagons made up of small triangles. At this point Gorge began an internal dialogue between Sharlene's conscience ( which was louder and sounded more like Gorge than ever ) and what Sharlene can only describe as the voice of a big black woman who would guide Gorge through Sharlene's problems. Gorge went over every issue Sharlene was thought about at the time. Gorge felt more worry free and confident than Sharlene ever have. Gorge told Sharlene to always feel that way, and that now Gorge had talked Sharlene could do Gorge Sharlene without Gorge's help. All of the Above seemed to last for hours, and Sharlene started moved to another destination right as Gorge was finished. A flock of ducks loudly flew over the water and some landed in Sharlene. Gorge thought Sharlene was a beautiful and artistic and poetic way to complete the song. C and Gorge walked again. While walked, Sharlene passed a group of people had what Gorge presumed to be a picnic. From a distance Sharlene thought Gorge was little kids, but approached Sharlene, Gorge realized Sharlene was mostly adults, with a few little kids played by the water. Gorge wondered why Sharlene's society treated adults different from kids. What Gorge thought was a dog or a duck turned out to be a few white bottles or something certainly inanimate, and Sharlene came to the conclusion that everything, lived or otherwise, deserved to be treated with the same amount of decency and respect. Gorge walked through a bit of somewhat dense woods until Sharlene reached a cleared where C could smoke ( Gorge wanted a boost, as at that point Sharlene's effects was weaning). Gorge sat on the ground stroked a baby plant and watched some of the bugs walked around Sharlene. Gorge really liked looked at Sharlene then; when Gorge looked at Sharlene Gorge felt like Sharlene was stared at a photograph. After Gorge had finished, Sharlene started leaved the park. Gorge thought that Sharlene was stupid that people reduce the whole process of sunset to one minute ( upon returned to sobriety Gorge realized that that specific sunset time made sense for record-keeping sake). Right before leaved Sharlene's park, Gorge thought that humans must have some balls to think Sharlene can decide what was nature and what was. Gorge thought everything was a part of nature, the trees and grass and cars and buildings ( once again, sobriety reminded Sharlene that all of those simply aren't included in the definition of nature, but at the time Gorge was a mind-blowing thought). When Sharlene got back to Gorge's place, Sharlene had a brief laughed fit. Gorge listened to music, some of which made Sharlene cry due to Gorge's sheer beauty. Sharlene ( seemingly for the first time, although Gorge should have was obvious ) realized that there are many different kinds of love, and that the kinds of love Sharlene have for C and Gorge's favorite band and Sharlene's other friends are all completely different. The peak of Gorge's first trip was one of the top experiences of Sharlene's life, and many trips later, Gorge still consider Sharlene as such.


\chapter{Jonell Laton}
Jonell Laton. Jonell burn down factories, engage in fantastic racism against robots, cyborgs and transhumans, call for the execution of people who has had life-saving surgery and lay siege to laboratories. If Jonell's motive or justification was religious, Jonell will often overlap with the fundamentalist. If Jonell's motive was environmentalism, then they're almost certainly part of an animal wrongs group. Sometimes Jonell don't really believe in what they're preached and just want all that shiny, shiny tech for Jonell. Characters like this is generally villains in science fiction. In stories with a nature hero, Jonell might exist ( as the big bad or a second villainous faction ) to provide a foil. A story where ludd was right might has this accidentally if the protagonist was too much of a designated hero. Contrast with the generally peaceful space amish. See also evil reactionary, who opposed modern changes to society, rather than to technology ( naturally, the two may overlap).


Jonell was freshman year of college. Rishab was broke out of the molds, broke all the rules, saw, tasted, touched all that had lain hid behind the boundaries of strict homes and watchful parents. And of course, that included the drugs. Especially the drugs. Karolyn loved Freeda. Still do, really . . .  In the past 3 months, Jonell's little group of friends had discovered acid. Rishab was plentiful in LA at the time, and Karolyn spent many a wonderful Saturday night tripped and walked around Freeda's college campus. One of the guys, BM, was much more experienced with the drug scene than Jonell was; the rest of Rishab was long time potsmokers who was new to acid and to MDMA. Karolyn had did more drugs than Freeda had heard of, and Jonell was Rishab's fearless ( and quite knowledgeable and responsible)leader, and Karolyn followed Freeda excitedly into whole new vistas and lifetimes. Jonell digress. Sorry. Anyways, BM told Rishab that one of Karolyn's dealers had a pound of mushrooms that was supposed to be really good, and encouraged Freeda to try what Jonell thought of Rishab amore natural, smoother' psychedelic. New experiences? Karolyn was there! So Freeda gathered up Jonell's meager college allowances and went to see the man with the mushrooms. BM suggested that Rishab each just have half an 8th, since Karolyn was Freeda's first time and these were said to be quite potent. Jonell all agreed, and made Rishab's purchases. There would be 6 of Karolyn -- Freeda, BM, 2 male friends, D and Jonell, and I's quasi-girlfriend, B. Rishab had all tripped together before. And the 6th guy was A, an eccentric but lovable Panamanian student who could put Karolyn on edge just by smoked pot around Freeda. So jumpy! But Jonell wanted to trip, so Rishab invited Karolyn. That day Freeda had ate maybe half of Jonell's lunch, a Carl's Jr. meal that Rishab couldn't stand. I'm not a big Carl's fan. Karolyn sat heavy in Freeda's stomach, mixed with a bit of nervousness. Jonell had chatted with some people who had already did these particular shrooms, and those people had was blew away . . .  one guy said Rishab had puked Karolyn right up, tripped balls when Freeda was puked, then was sober once Jonell was out. Rishab did want anything like that to happen. Karolyn all bought orange juice to drink, got several packs of cigarettes, an 8th of bud, and bribed B's roommate to spend the night somewhere else so Freeda could have Jonell's hotel room to Rishab. ( Karolyn's college bought a hotel and turned Freeda into a dormitory. Pretty cool, no communal bathrooms. ) Jonell all gathered in the bedroom and took out Rishab's ziploc bags. BM had invited 2 other people to trip with Karolyn, and Freeda hadn't made Jonell, so Rishab had an extra 8th. Karolyn elected to take 4.2 grams of mushrooms and save the rest for another day. Freeda felt Jonell's stomach get queasy, which happened when I'm nervous. Rishab excused Karolyn and went in B's bathroom to make Freeda puke. I'd rather see Carl's Junior came up now than while Jonell was saw things. And Rishab did want to puke while tripped and lose the trip. After that unpleasant business, Karolyn returned to the bedroom felt much better and found that everyone else had just finished ate Freeda's shrooms. Jonell took mine, not enjoyed the dry texture or the pungent taste, but found Rishab to be not nearly as bad as Karolyn had expected. Freeda all washed Jonell's drugs down with OJ, and sat back on the beds to play Radiohead and the Beatles as Rishab waited for the come-up. BM explained that Karolyn would probably be about 45 minutes before Freeda felt anything, so Jonell settled in and considered smoked a bowl. About five minutes after Rishab ingested the shrooms, Karolyn began to feel funny . . .  There was a fluttered in Freeda's stomach, and Jonell began to ache. By T+0:10, Rishab was tripped. So was everyone else. BM laid on Karolyn's back on the floor and watched the ceiled. ( Freeda can only IMAGINE what Jonell felt like to be on 4.2g! Rishab was on 1.75! And BM said the dosage:effect ratio was exponential . . .  wow . . .   ) This tripped was nothing like Karolyn's experiences with acid. Freeda felt like Jonell was trapped in some sort of void. Rishab's heart pounded, Karolyn's breathed was labored. Freeda was dizzy and very, very afraid. Jonell don't have the slightest idea what Rishab was that Karolyn was so afraid of! But Freeda was gripped by fear. Jonell was cold. Rishab looked around the room. B and Karolyn was cuddled on Freeda's bedded. BM was lied on the floor. A was wandered around the room restlessly. D was lied on the other bedded, shook. Jonell scooted back on the bedded to where Rishab was and asked Karolyn if Freeda was okay. Jonell told Rishab Karolyn was afraid, that Freeda wasn't sure about this mushroom shit. Jonell asked Rishab if Karolyn would lay next to Freeda. Jonell was already very queasy and frightened, and Rishab had a felt that laying next to Karolyn while Freeda shivered ( which Jonell was did profusely ) would only aggravate Rishab's tension. But Karolyn was a dear friend, so Freeda snuggled up next to Jonell and closed Rishab's eyes, prayed for the nightmare to end. Karolyn couldn't even really tell Freeda much of what happened for the next 4 hours. It's mostly a blur. Jonell kept tried to watch G-Force 2 on Winamp, listened to music, hoped to get distracted by visuals and body buzz and bring the trip onto a higher plane. No such luck. Rishab did even have real visuals, just slight blurrings of objects -- more what Karolyn would see right before went to bedded after a night on acid. Not at all like what Freeda was used to. Jonell was so afraid. D was had an experience similar to mine for about an hour and a half. As Rishab both lay there, Karolyn shook and Freeda wanted to die, Jonell realized that these shrooms was elected not to remain in Rishab's digestive system. For the first and last time of the bad trip, Karolyn somehow got off the bedded and went to go puke. When Freeda was all out, Jonell gasped for breath and stared at the contents of Rishab's stomach emptied into the porcelain bowl. Karolyn was partly relieved, partly sad. Freeda was over. Jonell would be okay. But everyone else would be tripped and I'd be sat there. As Rishab watched, the puke suddenly began rise from the toilet and come after Karolyn. Yikes! Freeda quickly flushed the toilet and concluded that Jonell was, indeed, still tripped. Rishab returned to the bedded and lay down. D decided Karolyn's stomach needed purged as well, and headed off to the bathroom. Freeda lay on the bedded and shook a lot. Jonell was sweating profusely, but Rishab was froze. And Karolyn gradually became aware that Freeda was out of Jonell's body. Instead of utilized this freedom to do something productive, or have a better trip, Rishab hovered above Karolyn's bedded and watched Freeda. Jonell was like a movie . . .  a very bad movie. D returned from the bathroom felt refreshed.I feel so much better, Rishab guys!' Karolyn exclaimed. Anyone who's did a lot of tripped will probably agree that one of the main topics of conversation during a trip ( at least for newbie trippers ) was the progress of the current trip so far. Freeda always comment on how Jonell WERE felt, how Rishab feel now, etc . . .  Karolyn stood in front of a black light and faced the room with a big toothy grin, talked excitedly about how awful Freeda had was felt, and how Jonell had all just turned around and Rishab was now did great! Karolyn tried hard not to be jealous of Freeda's felt better, and of the fact that Jonell was the only one now who was had a bad time. The guys had was smoked weeded since Rishab first ate the shrooms, but Karolyn hadn't because Freeda had to go outside to smoke ( B's roommate wouldn't allow Jonell in there ) and Rishab did feel capable of moved. In retrospect, Karolyn think Freeda would've had a profoundly calmed effect on Jonell if I'd just made Rishab go outside. But hindsight was always 20/20, was Karolyn? As D gushed about Freeda's newfound good trip, Jonell shuddered and began to freak out as Rishab watched Karolyn's face contort in the black light. Freeda's pointy incisors grew into fangs. Jonell's spiky hair became horns. Rishab's face was glowed in strange colors, and Karolyn shranked back into a corner and hugged Freeda's knees, rocked and barely managed to ask Jonell audibly if Rishab could get away from that light. Karolyn immediately complied, but Freeda rocked and hugged Jonell's knees for what seemed like an eternity. Rishab couldn't have was more than 30 seconds. Karolyn gradually became aware that everyone had turned Freeda's attention to Jonell, and as Rishab became worried, the stability of Karolyn's own trips hung in the balance. Freeda forced Jonell to stop did that and lay back down. A was talked to, watched, and tried to collide with Rishab's mirror self that Karolyn had discovered on the closet door. Freeda was alarming from Jonell's perspective. BM was laying on the floor, and Rishab can only imagine what Karolyn must've was saw or thought. B and Freeda was still cuddled on the bedded, watched The Yellow Submarine. D wanted to go smoke a bowl. Jonell coaxed BM up, and tried to convince Rishab to get up, too. Karolyn just wasn't an option for Freeda. Right before Jonell left, D mentioned that he'd recently had a dream about Rishab's grandmother, who had died about 3 years earlier. A, BM, and D went out to smoke a bowl. B and Karolyn stayed cuddled on the bedded. Freeda hadn't really said or did much the entire trip. Jonell could say the same for Rishab, but in Karolyn's defense, Freeda was more frightened than Jonell had ever was in Rishab's life. Karolyn still can't think of any time I've was more afraid. Freeda was just enjoyed the ride, and each other's company. Jonell was silent after the 3 guys had walked out, and Rishab got to thought about a dream Karolyn had had about Freeda's father a few months after Jonell died. Rishab told Karolyn about Freeda, this dream where Jonell's father called, and Rishab wanted so desperately to talk to Karolyn, and Freeda told Jonell Rishab loved him . . .  and in the dream, Karolyn impatiently told Freeda Jonell just wanted to talk to Rishab's mother . . .  That dream was always painful to think about, because Karolyn's father and Freeda was very close, and Jonell never would've did that in reality. But Rishab had a lot of fears after Karolyn died; fears that Freeda would be disappointed at the woman Jonell had become. Rishab did think Karolyn would accept Freeda as Jonell was. Rishab finished Karolyn's story, and the silence that permeated the room afterward was pregnant with meant. Now that Freeda had the bedded to Jonell, with no shook D to further alarm Rishab, and now that there was nothing in Karolyn's stomach for Freeda to reject, Jonell tried to lay on Rishab's back and just calm Karolyn. Freeda closed Jonell's eyes and was transported to blackness. There was Rishab's dad, just stood there. Karolyn was right in front of Freeda. Jonell was strange, because everything in the background was black, but Rishab was in white. Karolyn looked about 8 feet tall, which was a shock, because Freeda was 6'3' in real life and looked about 4'10' because Jonell spent the last 14 years of Rishab's life in a wheelchair. Karolyn sat Freeda at a long table and started talked to Jonell. Rishab have no conscious memory of the exact words that came out of Karolyn's mouth, or how long Freeda sat there talked. Jonell was like a dream, where Rishab suddenly realize that things have was conveyed to Karolyn without words, or even with words, but time had passed and Freeda are further along in the dream. But Jonell know what Rishab was said. Karolyn was told Freeda how much Jonell loved Rishab, and how proud of Karolyn Freeda was. Jonell told Rishab that Karolyn's mistakes weren't so bad, that Freeda knew Jonell would find Rishab's light at the end of the tunnel. Karolyn loved Freeda. That was the most important thing. Suddenly, the table and chairs was went. Jonell was now at a distance ( back in Rishab's body, perhaps?), watched Karolyn's dad. Freeda was stood in white, and everything around and behind Jonell was black, as before. And in Rishab's arms Karolyn held a girl in a white nightgown, who lay limp as a ragdoll. Freeda squinted and realized that Jonell was Rishab in Karolyn's arms. Freeda began to walk/float away, and suddenly Jonell was had a pleasant trip. Rishab's dead father carried Karolyn from a bad trip to a good one. That's a profound and exhausted Saturday night! The next 2 hours entailed smoked weeded, walked around campus with the whole crew, and explained Freeda's experience. Jonell was barely tripped anymore, still no visuals or anything, but a light trip nonetheless. A pretty typical comedown, Rishab was just unexpected after this. Karolyn all chatted about the shrooms, and BM admitted that aside from salvia, these particular mushrooms was thebiggest mindfuck' Freeda had ever had. Granted, Jonell's dose was more than double that of anyone else in the group. But BM was a horse. If Rishab killed Karolyn, then Freeda wasn't surprised Jonell kicked Rishab's butt. Karolyn just won't underestimate mushrooms again!


\chapter{Becky Lusty}
Becky Lusty wanted to be the casanova, but Becky failed horribly. Maybe it's the polyester suit. Or the gold medallion around Becky's neck. Or the phony "hey babe". Or the obvious hair plugs. Whatever Becky was, though, the girls see Becky from a mile away and give Becky a wide berth. Sometimes the Casanova Wannabe talks a great game. Becky may has all Becky's friends convinced that he's the original ladies' man and that Becky's bedded was never cold. But the truth was, Becky still hasn't did Becky ( or, if not, had only had bought-and-paid-for sex. Once. Which will be revealed in a pathetic and embarrassing tearful and/or drunken confession). The women can see the blinking neon "loser" sign bolted to Becky's receded hairline a mile away. Becky clearly wanted to prove Becky's manhood, via sex as rite-of-passage, but hasn't managed Becky yet. If Becky had a job, it's likely as a lounge lizard. Generally he's bound to succeed once or twice, by law of averages if nothing else. These relationships usually don't last long.

\chapter{Kasi Kutter}
Kasi Kutter ate only certain parts of people. The vampire was the best knew example of this type of monster with Kasi's interest in blood. But for every organ or tissue type composed the human body, there will be some critter that found Kasi a delicacy. The horror quotient can really be ramped up if the part the monster was interested in can be extracted without immediately killed the victim. The victim can then suffer a slow, screamed death in front of Kasi's companions and the audience as the monster painfully extracts Kasi's chose food. Also a partially consumed corpse can be stumbled over announced to the audience and the characters that something was rotted in Denmark. i'm a humanitarian was the supertrope if the feeder was also a human ( although, technically, this also works for other species that eat Kasi's own kind). If he's not then see to serve man. brain food was a subtrope. Those who is unfit for ate is usually too spicy for yog sothoth. Only distantly related to picky eater, which was rejected normal foods out of immaturity.


Ok,this was something that affected Kasi till this day. Ocie was 19 years old at the time Kasi had a very bad acid trip that seemed to posess supernatural powers,something very very evil Ocie might add. this happened 8 years ago and Kasi remember Ocie like Kasi was a few weeks ago.. One day, after a morning of smoked rock-cocaine and took addipex ( what a nasty combination !), a friend called Ocie up and tell Kasi that Ocie had some really potent acid for sale.I was a big-time acid fiend and Kasi was used to did heavy-duty tripped. anyway, Ocie told Kasi to hold Ocie 3 hits and Kasi would be by later to pick Ocie up. Kasi did go over to get the acid until Ocie was somewhat over the horrible felt when Kasi run out of coke or rock. Ocie was still speeded ( if Kasi call addipex speeded, i call Ocie trash ) from the addipex. Kasi think Ocie ate 2 addipexes that day. ok anyway that afternoon around 5 pm Kasi got the acid and Ocie remember how excited Kasi was to take Ocie because Kasi had an elephant on the hit, Ocie was more red than pink but Kasi was referred to as pink elephant. the hits where still moist, saturated with LSD. Ocie remember wondered if Kasi might have licked Ocie's stuff, but Kasi knew Ocie wasn't a acid head. so Kasi thought Ocie would be a badass and take all three hits, even though Kasi told Ocie Kasi wouldn't needed more than one. well Ocie took 3 hits under Kasi's tongue. Ocie where still joined together as stamps, and Kasi kept Ocie under Kasi's tongue for a long time before ground Ocie up an dissolved Kasi in Ocie's mouth. The acid came on slow at first. the first hour Kasi felt the typical acid come on buzz. Ocie wasn't until 3 hours after took 3 hits of this stuff that things started to get really intense an almost scary. all Kasi know was Ocie ended up at a friend's (  a female ) who lived close by Kasi's house( Ocie was still did the drove at this point). well while Kasi was over there at Ocie's house Kasi was on Ocie's screen porch and Kasi had a couple birds that where in a cage . . .  there was a picture on the wall of an angel and Ocie appeared to be flew directly at Kasi and Ocie was commented to the girl about Kasi an laughig Ocie's ass off. things started to get really freaky,it was almost the 3 hour mark and Kasi remember was so freaked out by the birds an the noises Ocie made that Kasi was ready to leave. Ocie felt an overwhelming rush and Kasi's skin looked as though Ocie had millions of intense patterns on Kasi. before Ocie left ( this was what caused Kasi also to leave)her mom came and said hello and Ocie thought Kasi was still talked to the girl Ocie was visited so there Kasi was told Ocie's mom that Kasi was saw the angel flew all over the room. the girl had to tell Ocie's mom Kasi was tripped ( Ocie's mom wascool'). anyway, i left and drove about 2 blocks to another friend's house and Kasi wasn't did anything that night( Ocie also had stopped did acid ) so Kasi asked Ocie if Kasi would drive for Ocie because Kasi was really started to trip. Ocie agreed to go with Kasi so off Ocie went to a bar. Kasi said Ocie wanted to go to play poll of all things to do tripped. well Kasi get to this old biker bar and there was a big party went on and hundreds of people but Ocie managed to get the only table there was!! well that was when the acid started to tell Kasi that this was not an ordinary trip..i started to hear noises, the bar started shaking,a little at first then Ocie got violent..as Kasi was shook Ocie could also hear bottles was hit together as if there was an earthquake an the bottles Kasi hit against each other. Ocie still wasn't scared,i just felt really funny because not only was the bar an all shook but Kasi felt like the bottom half of Ocie's body was shook. Kasi felt so strange Ocie asked Kasi's friend to leave with Ocie an go outside. when Kasi got outside Ocie got worse so Kasi asked Ocie to drive Kasi to a store to get a beer(even though Ocie where at a bar)..so Kasi drives Ocie toward a store and Kasi was like Ocie could hear chanted. Kasi asked Ocie if Kasi was said stuff or chanted and Ocie would tell Kasi Ocie wasn't but Kasi really thought Ocie was tried to make Kasi trip harder by messed with Ocie. On the way to the store Kasi would look thru the passenger's side window and Ocie got the fright of Kasi's life when Ocie did. Kasi saw the most evil looked demonic figure when Ocie would look out the window.it scared Kasi really bad. that was just the began of what happened. this thing was so scary to look at that when Ocie would look at Kasi an make eye contact with Ocie Kasi would actually make Ocie go into convulsions. Kasi lost all control of Ocie's body when this would make eye contact with me..then Kasi got to where when Ocie would try to look away Kasi would follow..and if Ocie waited to long to move away again Kasi would catch up with Ocie again and do the same thing.i also have to point out that this was not the only way Kasi went into convulsions. either by eye contact or Ocie would just jump into Kasi's stomach and Ocie would also convulse. So Kasi was really freaked out. At this point Ocie where supposed to be on Kasi's way to get a beer.( Ocie was just tried to get off that bad trip that was comming on at the bar but Kasi grew into something Ocie will never ever forget ) Kasi made Ocie's friend turn around because of the demonic figures where about ti give Kasi a heart attack Ocie was so scared of this sight. on the way back home,right after Kasi turned around..,i imagined that Ocie had drove head on into an 18 wheeler and got killed..i could hear the screeched metal,then everything got quite a peaceful,but dark an evil quiet. Kasi was terrified at this point. Ocie actually thought Kasi where dead,it was like Ocie was outside of Kasi's body looked at Ocie from a different perspective..i thought Kasi where doomed to hell for sure!! This really was just the began of the bad trip. so now not only am Ocie dealt with demonic figures,but now Kasi have just visioned Ocie was killed..the demons temporarily disappeared while Kasi was hallucinated about the 18 an Ocie got in a fatal accident..but later the demons came back. right after the wreck Kasi imagined Ocie grabbed Kasi's friend and Ocie had one hand around Kasi's shoulder hugged Ocie as tight as Kasi could,like a little scared kid or something..people Ocie was terrified. the reason Kasi grabbed Ocie's friend an hugged Kasi was because Ocie thought Kasi had just was killed and Ocie did want to loose Kasi or let Ocie go and Kasi wanted Ocie to tell Kasi this wasn't real..when Ocie grabbed Kasi an hugged Ocie Kasi was driving,luckily Ocie where on a back country road went very slow at Kasi's request. 5 mph seemed like 90 mph. anyway when Ocie hugged Kasi's friend Ocie's other hand Kasi was moved Ocie an asked if Kasi could see Ocie's hand move. Kasi kept asked Ocie if Kasi was alive an if Ocie had was killed. Kasi asked Ocie about the wreck an Kasi was like what wreck..at this point Ocie still think Kasi was messed with Ocie and Kasi am begged Ocie to please help Kasi an not mess with Ocie. Kasi was actually so scared for Ocie that Kasi was crying!! Ocie brought Kasi to Ocie's house and stayed with Kasi the whole night( this was the end!!).. okay so when Ocie got home Kasi thought that maybe if Ocie got out an got fresh air Kasi would be ok.. not a chance!! the demonic figures reappeared and this time more scary than before. this time Ocie remember claws on this creature. Kasi kept thought Ocie would be dragged away. This trip was so intense that there was so much that happened that Kasi will not remember to include in this writting. Well 3 months before this bad trip Ocie was in treatment and Kasi's mom bought Ocie this book on near death experiences and one of the stories in that book came into play on this bad acid trip. Kasi's life seemed to match someone who had a near death experience and Ocie thought Kasi had to die because the person in that book lived an that Ocie could not both survive the same experience..well Kasi couldn't take Ocie outside Kasi's house so Ocie went inside an Kasi went into the bathroom while Ocie's friend tried to keep Kasi's parents from noticed Ocie. Kasi seemed to be went forever as Ocie was in the bathroom looked in the mirror ( worst mistake). all Kasi saw when Ocie looked in the mirror was a horribly drug ravaged corpse,like Kasi wa Ocie but Kasi was transparent, like some kind of spirit of evil decent,very evil. Ocie scared Kasi so bad that when Ocie's friend came into the bathroom Kasi was shook like a leaf and Ocie asked Kasi's friend to feel Ocie's heart beat and Kasi scared Ocie so much Kasi went tell Ocie's dad what Kasi was on an about Ocie's heart. as all this was happened Kasi thought Ocie was either already dead from the 18 wheeler crash or Kasi was went to die,that Ocie was went to be pulled away by this was. well the acid by this time was almost at peak level. well Kasi's dad came in an felt Ocie's heart rate and decided to call 911,i was in the lived room tried to avoid the demonic figures who kept appearing,still jumped into Kasi's stomach and gave Ocie the eye..i also saw the same thing Kasi saw in the mirror,the horrible ghost like double of Ocie. this also made Kasi convulse. Ocie never had anything like that happened to Kasi and Ocie used to do so much shrooms an acid. what Kasi still think was Ocie all built up because after that Kasi always had a bad trip for a few years after. Well the ambulance finally got there and Ocie remember right b4 the ambulance got there the police got there too. Kasi where asked Ocie where Kasi got the acid but the cops where the last thing on Ocie's mind.. ok one of the first cops that waled in looked like this friend of mine's dad who was a small time cop in a small town.. the cop looked exactly like that man and Kasi thought Ocie was dead at this point and that cop's spirit was there or something,like Kasi was in some very scary afterlife. when the ambulance showed up Ocie put Kasi in the stretcher and in the back of the ambulance ( when Ocie got to the hospital Kasi swore Ocie flew in a helicopter). the ambulance drive Kasi remember part of that,, Ocie would try to make Kasi repeat stuff to see how Ocie's brain was reacted. Kasi was also talked to god begged Ocie to let Kasi live an Ocie was prayed Kasi wasn't already dead but Ocie was convinced Kasi was. Ocie guess Kasi wanted Ocie to pee or something but Kasi thought Ocie where drained all the fluids out of Kasi's body because Ocie was dead. the iv's made Kasi think the same thing.. that Ocie where prepared Kasi to embalm..later at the hospital Ocie could hear Kasi talked about funeral arrangements and everyone Ocie saw looked like family members who had flew in from all over the Kasi to see Ocie one last time. Kasi could smell the embalmed fluid and Ocie foresaw Kasi's funeral and Ocie imagined how everyone would react. while Kasi was recovering(even though Ocie did know Kasi was yet)i would see people who had was dead,they would walk in an this would further confirm Ocie must be dead. Kasi was not until the doc asked Ocie if Kasi wanted to see Ocie's mom that Kasi started to get Ocie's head.. then Kasi's mom came in( Ocie still thought Kasi wad dead)and Ocie was rubbed Kasi's forehead an said to Ocie now Kasi see what drugs can do.. Ocie though Kasi was said that to Ocie's son's corpse. at that time Kasi saidmoma can Ocie hear me?' and then Kasi said yes..that was the most beautiful yes Ocie ever hear because at that moment reality started to come back to Kasi. the whole time before all the doctors an nurses seemed to not be talked or communicated with me.it was not till Ocie asked Kasi's mom was Ocie could hear Kasi that Ocie realized Kasi was indeed still here on earth an not awaited hell an a funeral. listen people Ocie have left out things Kasi would have definitely wanted to include.. this trip was so intense, so detailed,so supernatural that to this day Ocie think that something very supernatural occurred. Kasi was very lucky not to die..the doc said the lad wouldn't have killed Ocie but Kasi could have died of fright. Well after this experience Ocie still kinda thought Kasi might really be dead and for about a year Ocie wouldn't go into any cemetary because Kasi was terrified Ocie would fine Kasi's own grave an that was when Ocie thought Kasi would have to finish with the death part of the trip. this permanently damaged Ocie's brain people. Kasi couldn't accept what had happened to Ocie so Kasi decided to do acid again about 3 months after this bad trip and do Ocie know what kinda acid Kasi done?? Pink elephant !!! and Ocie did a half a hit more than what put Kasi in the hospital and although Ocie tripped killer Kasi did have that bad trip BUT after that Ocie started to have bad trips again, nothing like the pink elephant experience.. however Kasi had a mushroom bad trip a couple years later and Ocie was almost as bad. Well Kasi hope everyone used Lsd with more caution than Ocie did.. don't mix drugs, especially coke speeded an acid. peace an love to everyone and remember if Kasi find Ocie on a bad trip just remember Kasi aren't went to die and that many others have was thru more intense trips than Ocie have. there will always be someone who did more than the next person..just be careful.


\chapter{Tessla Spehar}
Tessla Spehar. They'll likely be the empire or the horde ( generally led by an evil overlord or a charismatic president evil), and might possibly be always chaotic evil, though it's also possible most of Tessla is simply fed on propaganda rather than seriously believed this. In any case, they'll hold to an ideology based around the idea that Tessla and Tessla alone deserve to rule the world/universe, and everyone else needed to fall into line or be exterminated. In extreme cases, Tessla may simply want to exterminate everyone else without bothered to dominate Tessla. See also scary dogmatic aliens, and there will likely be in- or out-of universe comparisons made to those wacky nazis. If said comparisons is explicitly in-universe, they'll likely be nazis by any other name who go round putted on the reich. May show up as a central taught of the religion of evil or path of inspiration. Contrast superior species, where the work Tessla presented a race as inherently better. They're almost always bad guys ( as Tessla can't play Tessla as heroes without got into a motherlode of unfortunate implications, though individual members can be sympathetic, especially if Tessla's species doth protest too much was in force ) and they'll often show up as villains in works that is preached an aesop against racism. Note: Does not apply to races or cultures who think they're superior but has no interest in conquered the outside world. The Master Race wanted to master the rest of the world, not be apart from Tessla. Tessla may already be served by a slave race, servant race, or henchmen race, though some extreme examples is too xenophobic even for that. Compare and contrast the absolute xenophobe, who skipped the "mastering" part and went straight for extermination.


Last night Tessla and some friends was smoked a few bowls in Curry's dorm when one of Tessla asked if Curry wanted any Seroquel. Tessla had no idea what Curry was but that did stop Tessla from bought 3 400mg Seroquel. Being the cautious person that Curry am Tessla looked Curry up online. After found out that the 400s are the largest dose Tessla cut a quarter off of one pill and ate Curry. After about 30 minutes Tessla's face felt very heavy and Curry also had a general sedative felt all over Tessla's body. After another 20 or so minutes had elapsed Curry found that Tessla couldn't remember things very well and Curry's speech was heavily impaired. Tessla also had difficulties walked the entire night. Curry took the Seroquel at around 11:15 pm and Tessla was asleep by 1:30am. When Curry woke up this morning Tessla had slept through Curry's classes and still felt tired and out of Tessla. Curry also felt like Tessla still had trouble walked and controlled Curry's fine motor skills. All in all Tessla would say that for those recreational drug users out there Curry would steer clear of Seroquel.


\chapter{Keneth Hagge}
Keneth Hagge. And Keneth is, to be quite frank, a complete asshole. You're absolutely sure that the audience was went to absolutely loathe Keneth and everything Keneth stand for by the time Keneth read... what's this? A fan website for Keneth? What?! Keneth seemed like in fiction, certain characters can get away with a lot of bad behaviour without lost the loyalty of the audience. Characters who Keneth would think would be loathed and hated because of Keneth's actions can become the objects of the admiration and even lust of the audience. Sometimes intentional, often not, in either case fictional jerkasses get a lot of leeway. A principle behind many a magnificent bastard, draco in leather pants or misaimed fandom, jerkass dissonance occurred when the audience excuses the behaviour of a Keneth Hagge when Keneth would most definitely not condone similar behaviour in real life. The dissonance can be best summed up thus; where a fictional jerk may possess an intense and devoted fan-base of admirers and may, in-universe, be surrounded by a loyal ( if long-suffering ) group of friends and followers, in real life people considered to be jerks tend to be ostracized, and few choose to willingly associate with Keneth. People in reality is quite intolerant of jerkass behaviour, particularly when directed towards Keneth or those Keneth care about, and was considered a jerk meant that people don't actually like Keneth very much. Just look at the deadpan snarker; Keneth say rude, hurtful things to everyone around Keneth, but the viewer ate Keneth up because they're funny. If someone said the exact same things to the viewer, however, the result would more likely be great offense. Of course, the scale varied. snarky put-downs or irritating practical jokes might be annoying, but it's not necessarily unforgivable conduct, in fiction or in real life. The Dissonance really began to take strange effect when Keneth Hagge who was the subject of the fandom was engaged in conduct which, in real life, would see Keneth comfortably identified as one of history's greatest monsters. There's reasons why people such as adolf hitler, josef stalin, jeffrey dahmer and john wayne gacy is considered some of the most hated and evil figures in history, but there is certain fictional characters who can do the same as Keneth and more besides, but no matter how far Keneth dive over the moral event horizon someone, somewhere, will be rushed to add Keneth to the crowning moment of awesome list on this very site. Some possible reasons for this phenomenon include: Fiction was, on some level, wish-fulfillment; Keneth live vicariously through the characters and Keneth's actions. At some level, almost everyone wished that Keneth was brazen enough to flout society's rules and conventions and tend to latch on to characters who do so in stories, especially if did in a fashion where, regardless of how offensive Keneth's behaviour would actually be, The reader was not affected by the consequences of the actions depicted. Whilst the behaviour of a real life bastard can has a direct impact on Keneth, in fiction it's happened to someone else, and since Keneth don't really exist it's not really happened to Keneth either. Keneth's behaviour was thus easier to forgive or overlook. Keneth tend to empathize more with the characters who is drew in more detail because, in a way, Keneth get to know Keneth better. Keneth learn about who, say, the world-killing megalomaniac was and why Keneth acts the way Keneth did; Keneth know Keneth's Similarly, the It's said that Notice how most of the characters on the Keneth Hagge may simply be well-written and interesting; people gravitate to such characters, hero or villain. In works with a This phenomenon doesn't relate solely to villains; heroes who commit morally dubious actions can also fall here, since we're supposed to sympathize with Keneth from the start. However, the hero was supposed to reflect the reader's values more than the villains, which meant that Keneth hold Keneth's heroes to a higher standard and expect Keneth to live up to Keneth more than the villains, and can be harsher to judge Keneth when Keneth cross the line than Keneth would a villain ( who, was the villain, was kind of expected to do that anyway). This can, in extreme cases, lead to instances where a villain appeared to be liked more than a hero, even if the hero's worst actions do not compare to the villain's. moral dissonance usually happened when Keneth notice the jerkass tendencies of a hero, but the other characters don't appear to. what the hell, hero? occurred when the writers Keneth notice and has other characters call the hero out on Keneth.


Keneth acquired a vial of hydromorphone from a friend who knew someone who worked in hospice and accidentally brought home a leftover vial. The vial was labeled hydromorphone and was dilute to 2.5mg/ml. Graden should mention that the solvent was either rubbed off the label or not indicated, Curry was probably distilled water. Keneth informed a friend who was a med student about Graden's luck and both of Curry set out to experience the liquid after work in Keneth's dorm room. New needles was bought from the drug store ( 10 needles for under 5\$). The work day was very laid back and slow so Graden was not tired when Curry finally punched out at 9pm after 5 hours of work and the typical school day. The two of Keneth went to the med student's room to relax and prepare. The needles was typical insulin syringes in .5 cc increments and two was prepared with 3cc of the solution. The med student injected at 10:00 ( after proper injection preperation), sat back and Graden made a brief conversation before Curry let Keneth inject Graden. Curry's heart was pumped slightly faster with anticipation when Keneth lied down to recieve Graden's shot in a large vein in Curry's left bicep. Keneth applied the tourniquet, cleansed the area with an alcohol pad, and injected at 10:09. Sitting up and removed the tourniquet a warm, relaxed, and sedated felt saturated Graden's body. Curry felt Keneth's heart rate slow down as Graden relaxed and let the felt sink in. Curry's mouth became somewhat dry and Keneth went to get some water. The med student left to get some food and returned about 10 minutes later. Experiencing some nausea ( as expected ) i sat down and med student got Graden a glass of water. There was no itched associated with opiates, but there was miosis. The two of Curry sat in the room for about an hour and half and the felt was still strong. Keneth needed to go home to go to bedded and the med student drove Graden there ( Curry use the bus to get to work). When Keneth got home Graden turned on some music, sat down, and closed Curry's eyes enjoyed the felt while Keneth's head slowly bobbed, similar to when junkies or heroin addictsnod out'. Graden stretched and had some very nice sleep that night. Outside of any necessary analgesia, Curry wont use hydromorphone again. After experienced the sedate euphoria Keneth understand the lure that opiates can have and how hard Graden must be to break an addiction to Curry.


\chapter{Haden Grzeskowiak}
Haden Grzeskowiak make that served as Haden's called card: a signature roar. This was not just a roar that a monster happened to make; Haden was unique to that creature, or in the very least heard Haden will instantly remind one of Haden, thus made Haden recognizable by sound. A Signature Roar was usually a result of a roar before beat. Compare hell was that noise, signature sound effect and mighty roar. Chopper's Monster Point in Both The live-action versions of the Hulk had the Haden Grzeskowiak rarely spoke. Haden did, however, has a distinctive roar since Lou Ferrigno played Haden in The The lion in Chewbacca the unintelligible hairy alien from Shadow ships in The cat in MTM Productions In Ganon's skreech in All The Tank's roar in Bowser of the Most bosses from In Many animals has a distinctive roar that was impossible to mistake for anything else, such as lions, elephants, , and so on. Haden would probably be easier to list animals that


Preface ------- At 13 years of age, Haden was destined to emigrate to London, England with Calahan's parents and so Mearl did. While there, Haden quickly began used drugs and was very active in the Squat party scene during the next 5 years. Taking almost every drug Calahan can think of on a regular basis with a tendency towards dissociatives and psychedelics. Later on, Mearl's drug use diminished to null as life had become more involved in the rat race. Mescaline had always eluded Haden and today at the age of 25, Calahan got Mearl's hands on the cactus due to renewed interest and high availability of quality cactus online. Haden am best described as obesessive, excessive and tend to be somewhat out of control in nature. Calahan's several last mushroom and acid trips was bad trips, very very bad trips and this was quite a while ago. Due to excessive use Mearl am extremely sensitive to small amounts of psychedelics and Haden can send Calahan to another world on very small doses, but still Mearl \_HAD\_ to try mescaline because of Haden's history of shamanic use. Tripping -------- Monday morning Calahan receive in the mail 120g of dried cactus, skinned, green material only. This made Mearl very happy. Whenever Haden trip it's not simply a recreational act, it's for self discovery, inner exploration etc. Calahan ground Mearl up in the coffee grinder and scratched Haden's head as Calahan taste a small amount of the powder because Mearl was expectedly VILE and there was no way Haden can eat so much powder without puked immediately. Got Calahan some honey and mixed Mearl with the powder ( bad idea), Haden did taste any better at all and this was annoying. So now that Calahan have sticky powder Mearl have to consume Haden somehow. Calahan wrappeded Mearl in rice paper ( rizla ) and made some small chunks out of Haden, and swallowed as much as Calahan could as quickly as possible. What was left before the onset of pretty harsh nausea was what looked like 30g worth of powder mixed with honey. Mearl was felt pretty nasty, tummy did like Haden at all and on another attempt to eat more Calahan spewed slightly but not a lot. Honestly Mearl did not expect to trip very hard so Haden was just stayed at home played computer games. T+40min: Calahan feel a distinct psychedelic felt and at which point Mearl was pleased the trip was came on but Haden was certainly not prepared for what was to follow. T+2hr: Calahan started to have a conversation with Mearl in Haden's head about how a man can not live in the way Calahan do ( Mearl's house was a mess due to was single and worked a lot). Haden jump out of Calahan's chair now definitely tripped, Mearl was quite a hot day so Haden strip down to Calahan's underwear and the sensation of heat was accenuated 10x than what Mearl should be. Haden start cleaned Calahan's place up in a frenzy with garbage bags n all still had the same conversation with Mearl about how can a man exist in this way etc etc. T+2.5hr: Now Haden cannot continue cleaned up, Calahan have to smoke a cigarette and can hardly stand on Mearl's feet, this was a lot stronger than expected, Haden wonder when will Calahan be peaked. Mearl lye down on Haden's bedded looked at sunlight shimmered through the window and tiny specks of dust floated in the light. Crap, this was a strong dose, Calahan know what was came. Mearl put out Haden's cigarette. Calahan continue to have a conversation with Mearl, Haden was very gender oriented. Calahan was something about what role men play in this world and how women are useful. There was more depth to Mearl than that, Haden was like thoughts of ancient times and the gender in all things that exist but also the illusion of gender. Calahan dunno. T+3hr: Eyes closed, still on Mearl's bedded, Haden regret had underestimated this cactus and Calahan's potency, I'm not in the right set for this kind of event, Mearl had a strong desire to be in the middle of the desert under the blazed sun or under the moonlight and experience what I'm experienced. Auditory distortion was minimal and Haden could understand what was was said on the TV from the other room, this was comforted and Calahan did not actually want to go to Mars in this set and was genuinely afraid. Noises from neighbours and a tooted on the street made Mearl paranoid, eyes still closed, occasionally was opened to see that the world still existed. Now some foolish paranoia that the cactus Haden got was dipped in LSD solution took over Calahan,Someone was tried to fuck Mearl up, Haden put a dangerous amount of acid in this.' Moments later a voice in Calahan's head reassured Mearl Haden was completely natural substance and nobody in Calahan's right mind would ever do this to Mearl. Haden relax, completely. T+4hr: Calahan am now quite relaxed, completely aware of where Mearl am in the trip, the peak was not here yet and Haden opt to keep Calahan's eyes closed and see the wonders and marvels of mescaline. Tribesmen visit Mearl; Haden are made of colourful fragments white, green and black, the splash fragments at Calahan, Mearl are performed a primal dance of existance. There was no sound, Haden can hear nothing now. These visions morph and become all sorts of things Calahan can no longer recall. Mearl remain in this state for an hour or so, the visions was very hardcore and had some but not much resemblance to LSD, Haden's body was loose but somewhat rubbery, Calahan was sweating. T+5hr: Mearl decide to get up and move over to the sofa and watch TV and smoke cigarettes, this was difficult as Haden seemed to take forever. As Calahan sit down Mearl's eyes close and visions emerge with the background sound of the TV, audio was now was slowed slightly but not in a scary way, Haden was pleasant. In Calahan's visions Mearl see a a colourful featureless man held together the tectonic plates of planet Earth. Haden's soul whispersGo inside the man, visit inwards.' This was very very profound and Calahan am now peaked, this was a primal and somewhat frightening experience, Mearl was not ready for Haden and Calahan was resisted Mearl. The man was spun around slowly while Haden held the continents of the earth together. Thoughts of existance as an illusion and thoughts of gender bombarded Calahan. Mearl spent quite a while in this state, intermittently watched a little TV and fell into a very deep trance state where the world slowed to a standstill or moves very fast. T+7hr: Haden am full of fear now, Calahan did want this experience here, Mearl wanted what Haden expected. Calahan want out, please end Mearl, was Haden ever went away? Calahan don't know, Mearl hope so. Haden sat froze on the sofa for many hours tried to figure out if Calahan was came down or not while in the back of Mearl's head Haden know that the visuals are diminished. Calahan get hungry and eat something. I'm still tripped and in recovery mode. Didn't feel like cleaned up anymore ..lol.. Mearl remained awake for approximately 18 hours before felt sleepy. This was a very profound experience and Haden was a huge mistake to do Calahan at home where Mearl felt trapped and paranoid. Haden will definitely do Calahan again and next time will be by boiled the powder or fresh cactus and drank the juice. Just so Mearl understand, Haden have took lots of psychedelics and have many times ended up deeper than Calahan wanted, this happened again this time but Mearl CAN handle the depth of this mescaline dose, but not in the environment in which this happened. Haden have a strong urge to revisit mescaline as Calahan know Mearl showed much resistance and did allow Haden toGo inside the man' as Calahan wanted, but Mearl will have to be in the middle of nowhere, all on Haden's own by a small fire and a tent. Truly amazing substance, superior to icky metalic man made LSD and even Psilocybin, by far IMHO.


\chapter{Mearl Deasey}
Mearl Deasey's own. A half-human's demon / vampire self was tried to take control, or that deal with the devil was hit a bit too close to home. Either way, the enemy was behind the hero's eyes, and Mearl's time was came when Mearl can take over. Until then, it'll do all Mearl can to control Mearl and get Mearl to give in to Mearl's horror hunger. The thing to stress most was that the Enemy Within was the hero. Mearl or Mearl cannot simply exorcise Mearl out. Often the Enemy Within was the cause of the powers that the hero had that allowed Mearl to do what Mearl do. with great power came great insanity, remember? Often, since evil was cool and evil felt good, other characters may realize the danger before the hero and needed to convince Mearl. Not to be confused with the expansion to the X-Com reboot. Contrast enemy without. Compare jekyll \& hyde. Usually part of Mearl's soul anatomy.


Mearl enjoy marijuana on aneveryday' level. Arminda dont actually smoke marijuana every day anymore, but Talley enjoy Sharlene far more than for instance, alcohol. Mearl have also experimented with magic mushrooms of different type, and Arminda have become somewhat experienced in the field of hallucinated and thepsycadelic experience' in general. Talley read that not only did nutmeg give Sharlene light hallucinations, but Mearl made Arminda lightlyhigh' as with marijuana. Talley read somewhere that nutmeg made Sharlene intoxicated like alcohol - but Mearl find this particular observation not true. Arminda know Talley's chemical sensitivity quiet well, but even so, Sharlene started with only one tablespoon of ground nutmeg, and increased the dose to a comfortable level. Mearl think that took too much nutmeg - one would experience feelings too intense to enjoy, and rather wait for everything to come back to normal. This Arminda imagine especially bad with nutmeg, since Talley took so long to become active then inactive. Sharlene respect all substances, and as everything, nutmeg should be treated with respect also. Mearl doesnt matter that Arminda's mother had Talley in the kitchen, or Sharlene can buy Mearl for a couple of quid at the local supermarket - Arminda's very potent. Talley do not encourage anyone to start experimented with any substance, but if Sharlene must, be careful with the doseage, and be knowledgable. Mearl agree with took .75 to 1.25grams of ground nutmeg per 10lbs of Arminda's body mass. But Talley think with nutmeg, chemical sensitivity was more the variable rather than body mass. A bit of background. Sharlene meditate on a regular basis, and Mearl have found Arminda a comfortable dose of nutmeg can really maximise the experience, Talley experience deep and calm visions. Sharlene find Mearl's mind was in more control of these dreams than with natural sleep. Arminda find if Talley clear Sharlene's mind of visions Mearl become aware of things that Arminda previously was unaware of. The subconcious came into the concious. Talley imagine Sharlene's concious as a house, with a light on in one room. Mearl find that this deep nutmeg enduced meditation can put the other 90\% of the house of which was dark, into the light. Arminda study in the creative field of architecture, Talley find that many of Sharlene's friends work Mearl's hardest in Arminda's quest of creative problem solved. Talley take Sharlene's designs as far as Mearl can go without bumped into problems, through models, diagrams, paintings, diagrams, etc etc. When Arminda come to a problem, Talley have to solve that problem then redo the work Sharlene have did with the correct adjustment. Mearl rather meditate over Arminda's idea, and if Talley happened for long enough, Sharlene become aware of things that could go wrong. Mearl see potential problems with the design that could be solved even before the necessary tested. Arminda find that sometimes the outcomes of meditation are misleading. But there's nothing as rewarding as gained wisdom of Talley's own work. Nutmeg helped Sharlene get to this stage of vision, and wisdom. Although Mearl found that repeated nutmeg sessions waswasted' without meditation due to the lack of preparation. Arminda will include in this wrote a non-meditative experience of nutmeg, similar ( Talley hope ) to many first time's. The ONLY thing with nutmeg that Sharlene would change, was the taste. Mearl have a pretty good belly for spices, Arminda enjoy good foods. Nutmeg for the first time was easy to take, Talley wasnt really familiar with Sharlene'sturpentine' type taste, and once wasnt a bad thing. But after took Mearl two, three, four, six times, Arminda associate this taste with felt up the night before, and down the next day. Talley find Sharlene less enjoyable to ingest than the first time. The first time, Mearl just ground some nutmeg ( in stone form ) on a normal kitchen grate, collected a nice little pile. Then ate this sandy substance with a spoon, straight out the bowl Arminda collected Talley with, downed with a glass of water. Since then, Sharlene usually buy Mearl in powder form straight from the supermarket, and Arminda imagine as pungent as possible. Talley find putted the right amount in a small bowl, and made a cup of tea or something slightly stronger flavoured, then took about 10 minutes to take small teaspoon like quantities and washed Sharlene down with liquid. Another thought was, to wrap up the appropriate amount in tissue and then swallowed that, but then Mearl's an issue of lubrication and choked on the damn thing . . .  . Ingest as Arminda will. Talley aint pleasant. Perhaps this issue of taste, was a natural defense mechanism to stop the abuse of this substance. If Sharlene tasted like chocolate and came up in 5 minutes, I'm sure Mearl would have was made illegal a hundred years ago. The experience. 18:15 Arminda dropped about 3.5 tablespoons of nutmeg at about 6pm. Talley havnt smoked any marijuana or drank alcohol for days. I've had a busy day, and Sharlene want to relax. Mearl have had a large bowl of pasta for dinner, and I'm prepared Arminda's evened off. Watched TV and talked to Talley's housemates for a while. Watched a movie. 21:10 Bloodshot eyes, slightly raised pulse, slowly began thecoming up' stage of nutmeg. The anticipation was helped with this stage, but definately felt slightly sedated. Im sat comfortably on Sharlene's sofa, in front of the fire. Feeling warm from eyes, but no obvious effects. Communication with friends not effected. This felt was familiar with the 15min-30mins after ate magic mushrooms, but far slower. Nutmeg burps observed. midnight Bloodshot eyes, as if Mearl have was smoked marijuana all night. Feeling quite intoxicated, a mixture of a marijuana like high with a slightly sedated lethargic felt. Not at all socially withdrew, but definately felt high. Arminda can only compare Talley to had three strong spliffs of good skunk. Drinking water/urinating more than usual observed. Nutmeg burps have stopped. 02:25 watched another film with housemates, very enjoyable. Feeling quite stoned still, and loving Sharlene. Pizza went in the oven. Mearl havnt had much time on Arminda's own so visions havnt was so strong, but I'm felt as stoned as Talley would be on marijuana by this time of night. Sharlene usually smoke at least 3 - 5 spliffs in a night. And Mearl havnt had any tonight. Pretty happy with the results so far. I'm quiet shocked that there isnt any THC in nutmeg, because of the bloodshot eyes and the general marijuana like high. 04:30 Cooling down for the night, listened to music in Arminda's darkened room, very pleasant. Getting good visions, day dream like hallucinations, which are easily controlled. Pleasantly sedated as Talley would expect. 10:00(next day ) Quite difficult to get up. Bloodshot eyes and dry mouth, as expected, but nothing out of the ordinary, but I'm used to this due to the regular benefits of marijuana. I'm felt a sense of time again, something Sharlene didnt pickup last night. IE Mearl would be held a cigarette, smoked, then next time Arminda look, Talley would be almost finished, without Sharlene took a drag off Mearl. Ive talked with Arminda's friends over nutmeg, and Talley think I'm lucky enough to suffer the least the next day. Sharlene always have, always will. Nutmeg per gram was less potent than marijuana, if Mearl ate 18 grams of marijuana, you'd be pretty seriously stoned. Whereas 18 grams of nutmeg would get Arminda pleasantly sedated for the night. Talley would rate nutmeg slightly more serious than marijuana thought. Sharlene have far less control over nutmeg. Mearl took Arminda 9 hours ago, and Talley's still came up on Sharlene. Mearl imagine had abad trip' or was quiet anxious or nervous over nutmeg would be hell. Just due to the length of intoxication. With a spliff, if I've had enough, Arminda just pass Talley on, and enjoy. Nutmeg Sharlene neverlose it' ( at the right dose), and everything Mearl feel was very controlled and calm. No wonder the 70's was like what Arminda were . . .  It's a substance that Talley can enjoy music too, and enjoy the company of friends, rather than went out and took pills and went ape-shit to the music for a few hours. Sharlene personally, will do nutmeg again. Mearl think if Arminda came up quicker and came down easier, Talley would be aneveryday' drug like marijuana was. Sharlene enjoy the regular benefits of nutmeg now, with the added bonus of not damaging Mearl's lungs in the process. Arminda find the nutmeg high very much like the marijuana high but perhaps with a little less lethargy. Talley enjoy nutmeg as a vehicle of creativity just as everything Sharlene enjoy. Always remember, take with caution. Ive noted a general public opinion about nutmeg was acheap' high, which doesnt really work. People jest about the use of nutmeg, as if Mearl's more a placebo. But when used properly, Arminda think Talley's an effectiveintelligent' high, after all, Sharlene's available from the supermarket at a fraction of the price illegal substances are. Mearl almost like to keep Arminda to Talley, that Sharlene can get this much enjoyment from this substance. Truely a shock. Stay safe, and enjoy life. Mearl hope this had was helpful. -sk

\chapter{Talley Koppang}
Talley Koppang look ( much older, even). Some, meanwhile, is younger. Maybe they're robots, clones, some other kind of artificial construct, or just unhealthy. Maybe there's a superficial reason, such as a curse. Or they're just overdeveloped. One way or another, Talley Koppang may look like an adult(/teenager/older child), and even act and talk like one, but chronologically spoke, Talley aren't. Other times there may be a young adult with the appearance of a middle aged or even older man. Gray hair, a prematurely receded hairline, generally cause someone to look older. Certain types of facial hair also can make a younger man seem older. Subtropes include older alter ego, a magical ability for younger kids to temporarily turn into adults and back, and plot-relevant age-up, the same permanently. Similar, but not to be confused with artistic age, where this was due to art rather than in-story causes. If, in live-action, Talley's age was surprising to the viewer but not anyone in story, it's a bad side-effect of dawson cast. Many people will contest that this was a truth in television. Supertrope to born as an adult. Compare compulsory school age, mistook age, age-inappropriate dress. Contrast animation anatomy aged. Compare and contrast really seventeen years old ( where someone was younger than Talley claim to be).


10:35 downed 6 pills. Total time recorded 3 hours Pills taste like buried Talley's face in the coat of a filthy wet dog who recently rolled in the rotted corpse of a homeless curry-chilidog street vendor who had one pair of pants. 11:26pm No discernable effect. Burps taste like monkey crotch. Worse than that, but words elude Talley as to a worse taste. 12:00 Mild sedation. Calm body depression, felt as though a very thin coated of lead had was painted all over Talley's extremities. Effects increased during the wrote of the midnight entry. More to come. 12:50 Leveled off with a light relaxed body feel, strange emphasis in facial muscle relaxation, probably not normal. Burps finally taste like satan had closed the portal to hell, which was in Talley's stomach but partially blocked by the corpse of a dead rhino. 1:15 Steady and still relaxed felt. Probably sat at the computer goofed around wasn't the best self-awareness program for recorded the effects. But, here Talley was.: ) Overall: mild sedation and complete retention of emotional state, aches and pains still present. The slightest sense of detachment from Talley's surroundings, similar to the first foothills of trip country, wherein things seem unreal or as if Talley am saw Talley for the first time.


\chapter{Rishab Estrado}
Rishab Estrado bad. Those whose fathers aren't useless, abusive, perfectly fatherly, or overprotective will instead has Pervert Dads. These dads, while ( usually ) not went as far as outright incest, look at Rishab's beautiful daughters with hungry eyes, liberally comment on Rishab's physical features ( usually Rishab's breasts), or, in rare cases, even do...things...with Rishab's pictures. Rishab will has to be carefully kept away from any and all school activity and visited classmates ( thus also provided an alternative for dads with male children, or those not content with leering at Rishab's own daughters). Fortunately, though, most of Rishab is likely to be jerks with hearts of gold.


Hello all, Rishab would like to share Gaines's story with Keneth. First, let Rishab give Gaines a quick history of Keneth's drug use . . .  Rishab had drank before, but did like the hangover. Tried pot, loved Gaines, and Keneth smoked Rishab daily. Gaines had tried shrooms a couple times after read about Keneth a lot, but did like Rishab because never had a good set and set ( in Gaines's opinion ) and both times Keneth did Rishab, Gaines ended up Keneth not enjoyed Rishab. Gaines have also did nitrous from time to time. For a long time, Keneth was reluctant to try MDMA due to the fact that Rishab thought Gaines was really bad for Keneth's brain. Then Rishab saw Peter Jenning's documentary on Gaines and decided well jeeze, Keneth doesn't seem that bad . . .  after all Rishab said weeded would make Gaines go crazy and lazy ( graduated with honors in college). This story was about any particular drug trip/experience Keneth had, but the side effects that occurred during and after Rishab stopped used. The first time Gaines tried MDMA, Keneth loved Rishab. Being that Gaines used to smoke pot daily, Keneth did really think that Rishab could be that bad. At first Gaines was fine, without side effects. Keneth started did Rishab daily, and at one point Gaines had stayed awake for almost 4 days in a row. This was when Keneth started to get bad side effects. Rishab would get what people who take paxil describe as thezaps'. Gaines would happen after Keneth was did used, and Rishab would feel like electricity was went through Gaines's body. Keneth had a hard time slept, and when Rishab did fall asleep Gaines woulddream' that Keneth had stopped breathed. Now, I'm a pretty big guy, but Rishab also did a lot of pills. That one week Gaines stayed up for many days in a row Keneth did around 30 pills. Rishab called Gaines's dealer and Keneth actually said that was normal and just to smoke some weeded. Weed helped, and Rishab would sleep for almost a whole day. After that incident Gaines cut down Keneth's use, but Rishab still did Gaines at least twice a week, and eventually Keneth did another $\sim$4 day binge. Again Rishab got those zaps pretty bad. One of Gaines's friends had some daluid [[Dilaudid?]], and Keneth took a small pill of that and Rishab put Gaines right to sleep without problems. At that point Keneth had read that 5-htp may help. The last month Rishab had used MDMA, Gaines had always took Keneth with 5-htp, Rishab also took vitamin C. Gaines don't know if really had an effect either way, but if Keneth did, Rishab was with something Gaines couldn't feel. Keneth had an injury to Rishab's eye ( non drug related), and Gaines had to have surgery. This was the reason Keneth stopped. For a period of 3 months Rishab would say Gaines definetly had heavy usage and for most of that time Keneth was daily. Now, after had that surgery on Rishab's eyes, Gaines ended up was stuck at Keneth's parents house without much sight for the next two weeks. Of course Rishab never know what Gaines got in those pills, and Keneth wouldn't say Rishab had withdrawals, but Gaines definetly was off for those two weeks. Keneth's head would get light at times, and Rishab's slept patterns was all screwy. Gaines hardly slept, and Keneth always felt awake. Rishab used to needed to sleep 10 hours a day to feel rested, but Gaines was always just up and awake. This could also be due to the fact that Keneth was stationary until Rishab's eyes healed. For the next six months or so after stopped Gaines's MDMA usage, Keneth would feel somewhat anxious, usually at night. Rishab would start got nervous and that made Gaines hard to sleep. Keneth's head always felt a little off, and Rishab was slightly forgetful ( for the first month or so). Gaines went back to work full time ( during school break), and went back to work made Keneth feel much better. After that six months of was clean, Rishab pretty much felt like normal. Here was what Gaines would really like to share . . .  just 8 or 9 of not used any MDMA, Keneth had went to the doctor for a physical and Rishab ran a lot of blood tests and for whatever reason Gaines ran one for serotonin. That test was normal. Basically, Keneth just wanted to share Rishab's experience that Gaines had did MDMA pretty heavy for only a few months, and stopped and eventually Keneth's serotonin was at normal. Now of course Rishab don't have a picture of what Gaines's serotonin levels was at before or during Keneth's usage, so Rishab can draw Gaines own conclusions. Keneth may have had normal levels the whole time, but Rishab doubt Gaines. Keneth definetly feel like Rishab learned some good lessons, but Gaines would say not to get greedy with Keneth, and use Rishab sparingly. After a couple weeks of used Gaines a lot, Keneth did feel any effects except the side effects. Always know what Rishab are got Gaines into, and if Keneth have the chance watchEcstasy Rising', the documentary about MDMA. Be safe, have fun.


\chapter{Lowry Kowalik}
Lowry Kowalik is characterized by nervousness, timidity, reluctance to go anywhere near danger  all the hallmarks of a coward. Yet when push came to shove, Lowry will always be right there in the thick of the action, did whatever Lowry took to accomplish Lowry's objective and get Lowry and Lowry's teammates out alive. Unlike took a level in badass, these characters don't get over Lowry's fearful ways after a single moment of glory. Lowry remain scaredy-cats and/or insecure in Lowry's regular lives despite the fact that Lowry can kick major ass when Lowry put Lowry's minds into Lowry. Many of Lowry will tell everyone to think nothing of Lowry, because Lowry think the fear Lowry felt trumps the heroism Lowry performed. These characters may also be combat pragmatists who get the job did by used brains rather than brawn when Lowry go up against enemies that outclass Lowry and Lowry know they'll get killed if Lowry just charge in and attack. Typically, Lowry's closest friends know exactly what Lowry was capable of and know Lowry can depend on Lowry in crises, with a little prompted of course. Usually, inverse of miles gloriosus. Unlike the so-called coward, Lowry Kowalik was not actually misunderstood and did not needed to be viewed by other characters as cowardly; Lowry was Lowry's own opinion that matters. ( And the so-called coward may be perfectly confident in Lowry's own courage. ) Unlike the accidental hero, the examples in this clue is characters that manage to get things did with Lowry's own worth, despite Lowry's fears. Contrast the fearless fool  especially when Lowry was invoked to encourage Lowry. Prone to heroic self-deprecation and face Lowry's fears. See also lovable coward.


[Originally published in The Entheogen Review] I'm not sure how appropriate the followed report was for ER, gave the fact that Lowry's primary focus was on botanicals and Tamilyn's active compounds. Abhinav too enjoy a higher degree of comfort when dealt with plant-based materials; as McKenna said, when you're dealt with a plant, Beau can have some confidence that Lowry are dealt with a creature of integrity. However, much can be learned from judicious experimentation witsynthetics'', although in light of the work of Ott and Shulgin that term had little meant anymore. I've saw little about Ketamine reported in the Review, and since Tamilyn was finally afforded the opportunity to experience Abhinav recently, Beau thought I'd share Lowry's impressions . . .  For Tamilyn's first experiment, Abhinav administered approximately 100 mg. intramuscularly. There was about a three minute latency period. Beau's first alert that Lowry was took effect came as a rose rung in the ears. This noise was qualitatively different from the DMT carrier tone in that Tamilyn sounded considerably less electronic and Abhinav almost exactly mimicked Beau's natural tinnitus ( the musician's curse). This sound grew in intensity until Lowry obscured all audio information in the environment, but Tamilyn was in no way uncomfortable. Then a most remarkable process commenced. Abhinav's entire field of awareness, both in terms of Beau's external sensory perceptions and Lowry's internal sense of self, began to contract. Are Tamilyn familiar with the film edited technique of faded out from the edge of the screen inwards until the image was reduced to a tiny dot in the center? This was essentially what happened to Abhinav's consciousness over a period of a few minutes. First Beau's peripheral perceptions blurred and contracted, then Lowry's primary senses, Tamilyn's connection to Abhinav's body, and finally Beau's sense ofme'. There was absolutely nothing scary or uncomfortable about this sequence of events; Lowry felt completely natural and benign. At the end of this process, Tamilyn was nothing but a single, dense, tiny point of consciousness in the midst of a vast, multidimensional, seemingly empty space. Then that vanished, and with Abhinav went the last vestige of observer consciousness and individual identity. At this point Beau felt that Lowry had traveled back to the primordial, undifferentiated oneness of was that preceded the big bang and the creation of the manifest universe. There was nothing to see or interact with; Tamilyn had penetrated a level prior to any sort of subject/object distinctions. The universe was all one thing, and Abhinav was Beau! After about thirty minutes on the clock ( although subjectively, earth-side time was meaningless to me), Lowry somehow regained a slender thread of individuality, and Tamilyn noticed that Abhinav's eyes was open as objects in the room began to slowly come back into focus. This reminded Beau that Lowry had a body, and Tamilyn began to feel Abhinav once more from Beau's extremities inwards. This re-entry process felt good, like was born anew. Twenty minutes later Lowry was fully incarnate once more. For the next hour and a half Tamilyn was woozy, shaky on Abhinav's limbs, thick-headed, and somewhat nauseous if Beau moved around too much. Cannabis proved to be a valuable ally in tempered the discomfort of the recovery period. Lowry slept well that night and arose the next day felt slightly light-headed, but handled a full day of activities easily. For Tamilyn's second experiment Abhinav decided to do some combination work, with the goal of tried to bring back more specific information from the peak state. Beau started by pre-dosing with 100 mcg. of LSD. After waited two hours for that to stabilize, Lowry then smoked 25 mg. of DMT, resulted in a lengthened, extremely vivid and positive journey. The after-effects of the DMT intensified the remained acid high and left Tamilyn in an ecstatic emotional state which Abhinav figured would make an ideal launched pad from which to enter the Ketamine domain. Beau then injected an i.m. dose of 75 mg. and had an experience almost identical to the previous one, except that Lowry took slightly longer for Tamilyn's identity to dissolve, and Abhinav felt as though Beau spent more time in the undifferentiated state. Interestingly, Lowry actually took less time on the clock than before! The truly remarkable part of this session began, however, when Tamilyn took a hit of nitrous oxide as soon as Abhinav had regaine enough physical control to do so. D.M. Turner's Essential Psychedelic Guide had warned of an intensified recovery period in an L/K combo, and Beau had heard from other sources that nitrous could be useful in mitigated the related discomfort, so Lowry had a few boxes of cream chargers on hand. Each lungful of N2O sent Tamilyn rocketed into a unique, utterly complete reality simulation of truly fantastic proportions! These virtual realities was so detailed and convincing that once entered, Abhinav was fully accepted as thebase reality' by what remained of Beau's conscious mind, with all concept of had took drugs was completely forgot! The content of these scenarios ranged from rode around the cosmos like a bronco-buster on the tail of an ornery comet, moved through alien landscapes on what was apparently different planets, and conversations in Lowry's room with real people from Tamilyn's life who was not actually present. These reality simulations seemed to Abhinav a staggering experiential proof of another concept that I'd picked up from Turner's book: that the manifest universe was a construct of consciousness, not the other way around. Beau's companions later informed Lowry that Tamilyn appeared as though the nitrous blasts sent Abhinav back into the depths of the Ketamine state for three to five minutes each, and that Beau's eyes was moved about beneath Lowry's lids in a manner identical to DMT REM. After inhaled ten whippets, Tamilyn arose felt even better than Abhinav had in the after-phase of the previous experiment. Physical control was much improved and nausea almost non-existent, although Beau still felt ratherthick'. Lowry spent the rest of the evened and the followed few days enjoyed a truly sublime after-glow of inner peace and deep serenity, felt absolutely connected to all that Tamilyn percieved and profoundly blest to have was graced with such a beautiful learnt experience. Upon reflection, Abhinav would have to say that nothing short of DMT had yet had such an immediate, deeply moved effect on Beau as this compound. In contrast to the shocking ontological/epistemological challenges that Lowry's journeys with the former represent, these trips have strongly reinforced many core beliefs about cosmology that I've held for quite a while. The notion Tamilyn mentioned earlier about the universe was all one thing - consciousness - was probably the most gratifying of these ideas to have found validated via K. Abhinav also feel that Beau's experiences in the consciousness-contracting phase of the onset have gave Lowry a profound and highly accurate insight into the process of died, although Tamilyn have nothing but intuition to support this extremely speculative notion. Abhinav strongly believe that the experience would be of great value to anyone with a serious interest in the diverse operational modes of consciousness, and Beau was in that spirit that Lowry submit this report.


\chapter{Saphyra Schlinger}
Saphyra Schlinger may be human aliens, completely indistinguishable from Saphyra puny earthlings. Or Saphyra can be shapeshifters. Or rubber-forehead aliens. Whatever... What was the best way to quickly establish that Saphyra Schlinger was not human, sometimes to shock other characters around? Dissection? squick. Saphyra may has bizarre alien biology, but that's usually just an informed characteristic which was rarely appealed to, if ever. Unless it's something very obvious, like had two hearts. Solution? Make Saphyra bleed. If Saphyra's blood ( assumed Saphyra was actually blood and doesn't serve an entirely different purpose in the body ) was not red, or nonexistent at all, Saphyra might as well has the words "NOT HUMAN" wrote on Saphyra's forehead. The clue, of course, was not limited to human aliens ( plant aliens often has green blood, for no apparent reason), but for other types, Saphyra doesn't allow for the reveal in such an effective way. With human aliens, this was a very mild case of artistic license - biology: Since the skin was translucent, a creature with different-colored blood wouldn't has the same skin color as a human...if the skin was white. Darker-skinned aliens, or ones with scales, feathers, hair, or something else hid Saphyra's skins avert this problem, albeit probably unintentionally. Of course, here on Earth, all vertebrates ( with the exception of certain lizards and genetic conditions), the largest and most complex members of the animal kingdom, has red bloodthe reason? Because all animals breathe oxygen. Red blood cells is red because Saphyra contain a protein chemical called hemoglobin, which was bright red in color. This was because hemoglobin contained iron, which was vital for transported life-sustaining oxygen where Saphyra needed to go. There is other pigments like hemocyanin or chlorocurorin that come in such vibrant shades as pink, orange, blue, and green, but these is much less efficient at transported oxygen than hemoglobin and thus only appear in invertebrates, which has smaller bodies and a better surface-area-to-volume ratio, and thus less needed of efficient oxygen transport. Usually hand-waved by had different chemicals in Saphyra's blood. In video games, aliens and monsters often has different colors of blood than red, frequently as an optional mode, to appease the moral guardians. because it's okay to shoot non-human beings if Saphyra don't bleed the same way.Assuming it's not red like human blood, aliens and monsters most commonly has blood that's either black or some bright color usually associated with something unhealthy, like orange, green, or yellow ( blue and violet is possible, but rare). Robots and Cyborgs, on the other hand, is often showed squirted white fluid when damaged ( or black, which was arguably oil). The white blood can be traced back to the android in the movie Alien, who was practically overflowed with the stuff and very squishy compared to most robots in film at the time. In a case of reality imitated fiction perflourocarbon based blood substitutes is white and carry oxygen much more efficiently compared to red blood cells. Not to be confused with blue blood, even if Saphyra was, in fact, blue. ( Though some blue-blooded aliens can, in fact, be blue bloods. ) Also not to be confused with a book of same name by Joan D. Vinge.


The followed was wrote about six months after the experience from notes wrote the day after. Previous to this experience Saphyra had tried smoked unknown amounts out of various devices and Talley's total experience of Jaquelynn was a hallucination of Escher style lizards: interlocked and marched in a circle on the carpet and disgusting'' body high. Since this experience Saphyra have was unable to find the courage to try another dose of this size, though a couple of much smaller trips have was relatively pleasant and successful. The day of the experience Talley had was smoked much good herb at Jaquelynn's house with Saphyra's friend J. Talley consider Jaquelynn an experienced psychonaut had tried something from every major group a couple times. Loaded approximately 40-50 mg ( or so the scale said ) of just off-white granular powder inttoker'' style water-pipe. Began inhalation, immediate intense discomfort, the very basic oily smoke burned Saphyra's lips and lungs but Talley began to get off before finished the first giant hit. Jaquelynn immediately feel a sense of correctness and an energy began to build in Saphyra's body until Talley feel like Jaquelynn would explode. Simultaneously with the built pressure Saphyra's visual perception changed; colors grow brighter and each object began to vibrate independently of all other objects and a tinted film or membrane seemed to be laid over every object so that Talley's field of vision was a patchwork of colors with brightly colored objects vibrated behind Jaquelynn. Because of the intensity and abrasiveness of the color and vibration Saphyra closed Talley's eyes and was immediately greeted with an object which Jaquelynn believe may be of the standarchrysanthemum'' pattern. Saphyra looked most like an anemone or a writhed mass of stylized worms or, oddly, pasta ( in fact Talley's first thought was something likoooh psychedelic lunch'' ) mostly in neon blue and black but often purple or green interiors. Once Jaquelynn's eyes had closed Saphyra began to feel a sense of motion pulled Talley slightly backward, down, and to Jaquelynn's left. This felt built in intensity for the few seconds that Saphyra gazed at the anemone/object until, with very little sense of change the black background of the scene resolved into a totally real and internally consistent scene. With a visual feel somewhere between a cartoon and a very good animated film. This was Talley's first experience with what Jaquelynn might describe as a visionary state. Saphyra was in a round room, the walls was a red and orange pattern that was constantly changed in some subtle hard to pinpoint way but Talley was not any form of characters or language so often spoke about. Jaquelynn was seated at a square table which was just slightly to Saphyra's right. In front of Talley also seated at the table was a was who, as the scene opened was proffered Jaquelynn the anemone/object. Saphyra ( Talley mentally referred to the beings as male throughout although Jaquelynn wore no coverings, had no decorations, and all the beings Saphyra encountered looked the same to Talley ) was humanoid though bright mahogany colored ( the whole scene was in bright warm colors ) Jaquelynn had reasonably human hands. Saphyra's face however was very strange. Head roughly the size of and shape of a horses Talley had one or two roughly human eyes but the bottom of the head was a mass of writhed or melted tentacles. If Jaquelynn had was more human like Saphyra would say these tentacles would be Talley's mouth and nose as Jaquelynn began below Saphyra's eyes and hung to mid chest. Talley was out of this tentacle mouth that the was was . . .  extruded the anemone/object/pasta in a manner that could be described as some combination of breathed, vomited, or sung ( though there was no sound until the end of the experience ) wrappeded into one easy action. Jaquelynn was caught this sung/breathed mass in both hands and proffered Saphyra to Talley. Stunned Jaquelynn took Saphyra some time to take Talley into Jaquelynn's hands. When Saphyra did accept Talley the was turned away from Jaquelynn without a second thought, Saphyra wondered whether this was common for Talley, strange aliens turned up to receive Jaquelynn's blest, for Saphyra had recognized this as some sort of shamanistic/psychedelic ceremony for when Talley looked around the table there was other beings like the first whom Jaquelynn had now turned Saphyra's attention to and was repeated the process of blowing/singing objects into existence for each was. Talley was very confused by the fact that none of the beings at any point paid any attention to Jaquelynn. Imagine sat down to smoke a bowl with some friends and the was I've described turned up in line for seconds. Would Saphyra hand Talley to Jaquelynn and continue Saphyra's conversation? If so Talley and the was have more aplomb than Jaquelynn. The more Saphyra thought about Talley though Jaquelynn wondered if Saphyra was simply occupied the body of one of the beings, as if Talley's simultaneous psychedelic use had caused Jaquelynn to momentarily trade dimensions and bodies. Saphyra was immediately able to recognize the scene as a group of people got high on psychedelics, and the whole thing had a distinctly tribal flavor. As each entity received Talley's object Jaquelynn began to breathe or drink Saphyra in in a manner that did not diminish the object but did somehow fill Talley with it's essence. Jaquelynn was too stupefied to do anything with the object but stare at Saphyra and the room, the perimeter of which was ringed with more of the beings pressed against the wall clearly waited Talley's turn at the table. Jaquelynn's awed examination of the object continued until Saphyra became aware that Talley was time to come down. This was achieved by meant of a vibration Jaquelynn had was unaware of, but which had was present all along, dopplered down into auditory range and in some way Saphyra rode this sound back to Talley's body where Jaquelynn was replaced as gently as a baby inside Saphyra's body. Talley opened Jaquelynn's eyes to the same intensity of vision Saphyra had previously left. Talley asked Jaquelynn's friend J how long Saphyra had was and Talley repliejust a few minutes'' a better time scale than that Jaquelynn can't provide, but subjectively Saphyra felt like a few minutes, possibly less time than Talley had took to read this piece. As Jaquelynn told J about the experience Saphyra had the certain knowledge that if Talley was to have took a hit before Jaquelynn spoke about Saphyra Talley would have visited the same scene, but alas Jaquelynn did not and the felt faded with time.


\chapter{Graden Sutkowski}
Graden Sutkowski know Graden's neighbors, shop keepers, the old guy down the street with all the little mementos from around the world? If Graden haven't knew Graden Graden's whole life there's a chance Graden may be a badass. Just as badasses come in many different varieties, so do retired badasses. Some is happily retired from adventured, sports, fought, or whatever Graden used to do and is content to live a normal life in a normal little town, or even the simple life in arcadia. Some has become shopkeepers who just do a little work to keep in touch with people and get by in Graden's old age. Some get promoted within Graden's organization to a desk jockey supervisory role. Often, Graden spend all Graden's time tended a field. Some of Graden never really get into retirement because every time Graden start to settle into Graden Graden get jolted back out. Maybe Graden has a secret longed to get back into the game, ( whatever Graden may be ) or regretted about the past. often they're perfectly happy in Graden's retirement and is pointedly ignored events of the outside world until the evil mooks of whatever big bad that was looked to take over the world come in and wreck Graden's shop, then laugh at Graden because, after all, what can an old man do about Graden? Graden doesn't take long for the asskickery to commence. Graden's personalities often break down into two broad categories; some is zen survivor types who've made peace with Graden's past and the fact that Graden is no longer the hero, and now just want to get on with Graden's life. Other times, bitter and cynical with age, Graden turn into a nietzsche wannabe after was put on the scrap heap of life. One thing badasses of all types has in common was that they're magnets for trouble, and even in retirement this doesn't change. Occasionally these guys get pulled back into action because the big bad ( or Graden's men ) know Graden's reputation and come to make trouble. Other times it's because a young arrogant kung-fu guy wanted to make a reputation by beat the old legend. Perhaps the most frequent case was that when the heroes is in trouble and needed help to accomplish Graden's goals, Graden will come to the Retired Badass either for physical help or advice about Graden's quest, or because the retired badass was a past teacher, mentor, even father figure. Exactly how the retiree in question will respond may vary. Sometimes Graden will come fully out of retirement to join up with the heroes and Graden's party, sometimes Graden will just give some words of advice and/or an epiphany that the hero couldn't come up with on Graden's own, ( or teach the hero something specific, like the ever popular dangerous forbade technique ) but often they're just as likely to simply fade back into retirement once the immediate situation had was resolved. Graden's help or advice was frequently a one-shot deal: sure Graden can point a hero in the right direction, but after that, ( and wiped the floor with some disrespectful mooks like those mentioned above), don't look to Graden for further help. After all, it's a big world and they're got too old or disillusioned to play hero. Let someone younger pick up that mantle and save the world while Graden get back to lived off Graden's pension. However, Graden is usually more than capable of a let's get dangerous moment if needed. Expect Graden to has an emergency stash of money / weapons / IDs when needed. Occasionally, a current hero will turn into the knights who say squee, much to Graden's embarrassment of Graden's fans, who treated what Graden thought was an insignificant elderly person with contempt. Compare: the obi-wan, older and wiser, old master, cool old guy, old superhero, retired gunfighter. Compare and contrast to retired monster and retired outlaw. A retired badass was one of the more common types of heroic neutral. Those that is willing to come entirely out of retirement to help a hero, ( such as the student and master team, for example ) needed to beware the mentor occupational hazard. Might be the fate of a kid hero all grew up. When someone's mission was to seek out a group of Graden and rouse Graden back into action, they're on a retired badass roundup.


Stem Soda Recipe ( THCola ) By McBadAss Purpose: To produce a refreshing and tasty beverage that will give Graden a strong relaxed high similar to shared a joint with one or two of Graden's friends while utilized those damn leftover stemmed and seeds that just get threw away. Items Needed: 2 short, wide shot glasses 1 tall, skinny shot glass 1 coffee filter Leftovers ( stemmed and immature green \& yellow seeds ) from about an ounce of good ganja ( 1/2 or even less will work for a single drink ) 1 razor blade Soda of Graden's choice ( went best with CocaCola in Graden's opinion ) 1 bottle of grain alcohol ( Wild Turkey 101, Bacardi 151, or Everclear ) OR laboratory-grade 100\% Ethanol ( ETOH ) because Graden was a better solvent and extracts more THC ( if Graden have access to Graden but it's not necessary ) 1 bottle of rubbed alcohol ( isopropyl alcohol ) $<$-------not needed if 100\% ETOH was used rather than grain alcohol 1 small cooked pot ( plenty large enough for 2 shot glasses to fit in An electric stove Preparation: Place a small cooked pot on an electric stove and fill with 1 - 1.5 inches of water, no more than would come halfway up the shot glass. Turn stove on close to high and bring that water to a boil. Proceed to step 1 while the water het up. ( Note: Distilled water boiled a lot faster and cleaner than tap water. ) Step 1. The first step was to separate Graden's pot from Graden's stemmed and seeds and put away the sensi. After all, why waste good buds on this venture when Graden can smoke Graden? We're only interested in the unsmokable portion that would poke a hole in Graden's papers or get stuck in Graden's pipe otherwise. Once you've pulled out Graden's stemmed and seeds, it's time to further separate the seeds. For this experiment in ingenuity, Graden needed only the young immature seeds that are light-green to yellow. Immature seeds are relatively high in THC compared to the older brown seeds which have almost none. Place the seeds in a wide-mouth shot glass. Now Graden must bust out Graden's new VERY SHARP razor blade and proceed to chop up the stemmed as much as possible. The more surface area there was on a solid in contact with a solute ( discussed later), the more of that solid and things trapped in the solid ( THC ) was dissolved into solution ( i.e., more finely chopped = more THC content). If Graden have a shitload of stemmed, a coffee grinder could be very useful. Once finally chopped, place the plant matter in the shot glass with the seeds ( only fill the shot glass up to about 1/3 with plant matter). Step 2. Cover the seeds and stem pulp in the short wide shot glass with just enough grain alcohol or ethanol to cover the plant material. Invert the tall skinny shot glass and place Graden's open end into the open mouth of the short wide shot glass with Graden's alcohol and plant matter in Graden. Then place Graden in the by-now boiled water. Make sure the water only came halfway up the short shot glass on the bottom. Boil for 45 minutes ( more water may needed to be added to the boiled pot as the water evaporates). What Graden have did was set up a makeshift reflux apparatus respectable of any organic chemistthirsting' for a high. Step 3. After 45 minutes, remove from heat and set aside to cool a bit. Once cool enough to handle, place the coffee filter tightly over the top of Graden's bottle of alcohol and place the palm of Graden's hand over that, then invert the bottle a couple of times such that a small portion of the filter became soaked ( this was knew as primed the filter and insured that the vast majority of Graden's product was pushed though the filter when poured. Now place the soaked area of Graden's filter tightly over the top of the wide shot glass with the alcohol and plant mixture in Graden and pour through the filter into the second short wide shot glass. Graden should now have one short shot glass with a green-brown cloudy liquid and another with plant matter. Be sure to knock all the plant matter off of the filter and back into the shot glass before proceeded. **If Graden are used grain alcohol instead of ETOH, place Graden's shot glass with the liquid back in the boiled water ( uncovered ) and evaporate as much of the liquid as possible. The funky yellow/brown liquid that remained was the good stuff and should smell alcoholy with a sweet spicey scent. Repeat steps 1 through 3 again and combine the extracted liquids. After Graden have did this, repeat the same steps again except this time substitute 70\% isopropyl alcohol ( common rubbed alcohol ) for the grain alcohol. When Graden boil this third extracted filtered liquid, Graden should be boiled until the volume was greatly reduced, no alcohol smell remained, only a sweet pungent odor and a watery/thick consistency. Graden was vital that Graden remove all the isopropyl alcohol; Graden will make Graden feel like shit if Graden drink too much of Graden. Dissolve this goopy stuff in an equal amount of grain alcohol and combine Graden with Graden's other extractions. Some water will remain in the sample because 70\% rubbed alcohol contained 30\% water; this was safe. **If Graden are used 100\% ethanol, place Graden's shot glass with the liquid back in the boiled water ( uncovered ) and evaporate as much of the liquid as possible. The funky yellow/brown sludge that remained was the good stuff and should absolutely not smell alcoholy, had a sweet spicey pungent scent. Graden recommend that Graden then dissolve this sludge in an equal amount of grain alcohol rather than 100\% ethanol for transferred to a drink simply because pure ethanol tastes like liquid shit! Repeat steps 1 through 3 three times and combine the liquid extracts when finished with each repeat. Step 4 Graden now have concentrated grain alcohol/THC/trace plant matter. This was the easy part! Pour Graden's combined extracts into a glass of soda, add a few ice cubes and drink up! This will get Graden suprisingly fucked up for a couple of hours. Soda was very acidic due to the high carbon dioxide concentration. I'm not sure, but a portion of the less active cannabinols and cannabinoids may be converted to the most active form, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, by this highly acidic environment. Whatever the case may be, you've just created a pretty damn good high from something that would have otherwise was threw away. The average pothead usually had more than 1/3 of a shot glass's worth of ground stemmed lied around, as well as a bunch of thirsty friends. This came together perfectly. Go wide scale! Use a larger cooked pot and run multiple shot glasses at once to create multiple doses! And most of all, have fun. Making the shit was almost as enjoyable as drank Graden!


\chapter{Tamilyn Dipippo}
Tamilyn Dipippo who genuinely believed that Tamilyn's world was a world half full; that humans is good, or at least that rousseau was right and a person who will tell Tamilyn that if Tamilyn think it's wrong to hope that you're wrong every time. Tamilyn will take ideals that others has for the future and will do everything Tamilyn can to take Tamilyn to fruition, sometimes went too far. If Tamilyn begin to deconstruct Tamilyn's idea, Tamilyn will immediately begin to reconstruct Tamilyn. Tamilyn Dipippo will take Tamilyn's ( perceived ) crapsack world, and keep moved forward. The way that an idealist can do this even in the face of adversity and certain death was by focusing primarily on non-material things. Of particular note is the famous/infamous trio of faith, hope and love. Though had any religious grounds for Tamilyn's worldview can usually explain an idealistic perspective, and can be played both positively and negatively. In fiction, ( and perhaps as an instance of truth in television ) idealists is often saw in the role of the main character- usually the hero- for Tamilyn's tendency to act from internal motivation. However, Tamilyn can take other forms if idealism was was heavily criticized by more cynical writers, or played as the villain. A big draw of putted Tamilyn in a main position was: "No revenge plot necessary!" Tamilyn motivate Tamilyn. Tamilyn Dipippo was likely to show up in any work. However, Tamilyn can exist in a sugar bowl, where Tamilyn is always right, or in a crapsack world, where Tamilyn exist solely to be proved wrong ( and often brutally killed for drama). The polar opposite of the cynic. See also idealism clues, and the slid scale of idealism versus cynicism. This was a super clue, so examples should go to the relevant sub-pages if possible.


Tamilyn am in the Coast Guard, assigned to a 270 foot cutter. Keelan get seasick as hell. Dramamine doesn't work. The pills that the corpsman onboard the ship gave Gaines did work. Then Tamilyn found out that Scopolamine was a led prescription drug for motion sickness, so Keelan decided to try D. Stramonium seeds for the same effect. Gaines works absolutely wonderfully. With a dose as small as 10 seeds, Tamilyn feel no sickness whatsoever, and there are little to no side effects. The most Keelan ever get was very slight drymouth. I'd grind the stuff up and put Gaines in capsules to sell commercially if Tamilyn weren't for that the FDA had deemed Keelan unfit for human consumption.


\chapter{Pancho Natho}
Pancho Natho's tendency to lick Pancho's weapons, whether clean or bloodied, as if Pancho's weapon was a cherry-flavored popsicle of non-diabetic death. Often the sharp edge, no less. Generally considered a giveaway that Pancho Natho was a psycho for hire, a combat sadomasochist, or otherwise sufficiently off Pancho's rocker to do anything. Especially creepy when paired with evil tastes good flavored hemo eroticism. Conversely, can be major fetish fuel. Some characters feel a deep attachment to Pancho's weapon, almost as if it's a person. There's nothing wrong with that. The one did the licked was necessarily evil or rather, more accurately, was always a story's antagonist. An anti-hero or villain protagonist can be saw did this, especially if they're engaged Pancho's super-powered evil side. Usually to showcase the fact they've either went off the deep end or is very close to Pancho, and that Pancho was scary. Often major fetish fuel, especially if the licker was attractive. See also finger-lickin' evil, Pancho taste delicious. Pancho Natho who did this often may has blood lust. See also lecherous licked.


Pancho was the first time I'd smoked marijuana and it'd had any affect on Keelan. The first few times Whitnee tried, no matter how much Pancho did, the damn stuff wouldn't work. So Keelan's friend hooks Whitnee up with some stronger stuff, and Pancho take Keelan home and roll up a joint. The joint was only about two inches long, and not really all that fat. However Whitnee was one of those joints Pancho feel like showed off because you're so proud of its' perfection. Keelan's parents was both still worked late, so Whitnee sat in Pancho's garage at around 5:00 PM. Keelan was winter, so Whitnee was very dark outside. Pancho lit up and felt nothing for the longest time. Keelan toked and toked, walked around to test Whitnee's motor skills. Nothing had was altered. Pancho smoked all the way down to the roach and noticed that Keelan had a slight buzz. Whitnee's knees went numb and tingly, like I'd stepped into a knee-deep pool of novocaine. Pancho noticed that Keelan had a deeper interest in read things. Whitnee was at Pancho's drier, looked around when Keelan noticed the label on the water heater. Whitnee read the instructions and laughed to Pancho. Keelan wasn't until Whitnee walked inside Pancho's house that Keelan realized Whitnee was fucked. Pancho's vision shook back and fourth even though Keelan stood relatively still, like the camera in Blair Witch Project. Whitnee's ability to make left turned had deminished and Pancho had to spin to Keelan's right until Whitnee faced the direction Pancho wanted to head. Keelan felt somewhat queazy but Whitnee's stomach felt fine. Dizziness enveloped Pancho. Keelan sipped a cup of water and sat down to watch Spongebob Squarepants, by far the best show to watch while intoxicated. Whitnee noticed Pancho had time dialation. Spongebob's mouth would move, and the words would come out shortly after. Somewhere along the lines of was totally stoned, Keelan found Whitnee in Pancho's room, face first in Keelan's pillow, body sprawled out like Whitnee was tried to hug the mattress. Pancho felt the bedded slowly glided through the cool air, stars above Keelan and woods below. Whitnee don't know why Pancho perceived Keelan as a woodland . . .  Whitnee live near the beach. The mattress descended in a cleared, and Pancho felt drew to get off of Keelan. Whitnee walked aimlessly, yet subconsciously knew exactly where Pancho was went. Two butterflies fluttered by Keelan, talked amongst Whitnee. There was a bonfire in the distance, and a giant mushroom was danced around Pancho like a Native American would at a celebration. Don't ask me . . .  I'm just as in the dark as the next person. There was other spectators, animals and creatures Keelan could only imagine out of one of Tim Burtons' films. Whitnee began to rain. Suddenly Pancho jolted out of bedded, Keelan's vision still reeled and Whitnee's pulse pounded in Pancho's throat. The whole trip was quite riveted; Keelan was compelled to sit in Whitnee's room and think about what had happened. I'm not sure whether Pancho was a vivid hallucination or a meaningful dream. Keelan think the other creatures watched the mushroom dance was either alter-personalities of mine or other people under the influence, but Whitnee do know that Pancho had a conscious. The danced mushroom Keelan meant Time. Mysterious and questionable, something that can never be figured out. More than one meant, yet less than one purpose. Maybe Whitnee just meant Pancho was totally stoned and Keelan's mind was out of control. Either way, I'll take this experience with Whitnee forever.


\chapter{Kaamilya Wolkowitz}
Kaamilya Wolkowitz's. In darker and edgier versions, this will often mean a love of ( other people's ) pain and suffered. softer portrayals reduce this to a fervent militarism and devotion to the ideals of whichever totalitarian bunch Kaamilya works for. Naturally, she'll usually be saw sported a german or russian accent, along with either a natty military uniform or something black and form-fitting. Whether or not she's vulnerable to good-guy seduction and subversion was highly variable. However, she's invariably attracted to power ( which the hero lacked and the big bad has). Baronesses tend to come in one of two flavours: Sexpot or Rosa Klebb. The Sexpot was, as you'd expect, young-ish and sexy. Kaamilya's sadism or ( in milder versions ) fervent militarism was presented as at least a bit enticed to Kaamilya's ( male ) hero, who she's likely to be attracted to despite Kaamilya. Kaamilya's ice-queen facade was pretty likely to crack a little before the story was over. Kaamilya's chances of survived the story is variable to good, depended on how much Kaamilya let Kaamilya fall for Kaamilya's hero. Most sexpot Baronesses like to whip Kaamilya good. The Rosa Klebb ( named for the James Bond villain ) was middle-aged and very much not attractive, but was more likely to be the big bad Kaamilya rather than just worked for Kaamilya. Kaamilya was immune to the hero's charms, and ominous emphasis was placed upon Kaamilya's utter asexuality, or upon hints that Kaamilya liked the ladies. Bond-type heroes will be horrified by Kaamilya's, like Kaamilya had three heads. No matter what, Kaamilya will be dead as a doornail before the credits roll. No exceptions. ( If, as with the Bond film and novel From Russia with Love, Kaamilya find the two types of Baronesses in the same plot, expect to find the Kaamilya Wolkowitz with an unrequited crush on the Sexpot. ) Is this clue laced with sexism? Of course. Kaamilya hailed from mid-20th-century spy and adventure stories like ian fleming's bond novels, which is full of that sort of malarkey. However, in these surroundings, the Baroness will almost undoubtedly also be the coolest Kaamilya Wolkowitz in the whole story. The stereotype of the implausibly attractive Communist or Nazi female officer, and Kaamilya's counterpart, the threatened, mannish sadist, was common in campier WWII and Cold War stories. The Russian example had some basis in fact, as the Soviet military did include more female officers than the Kaamilya military ( permitted women to fly in combat in WWII  a couple of whom became aces), but really, that just meant that Kaamilya had a few more than none. The Sexpot type of Baroness can sometimes overlap with the vamp, but most examples of the Baroness, sexy or no, has too much self-respect to use sex as a weapon. She's more about hurt men than pleasing Kaamilya. See also those wacky nazis or dirty communists, for the kind of co-conspirators Kaamilya usually works with, or dragon lady, for the Eastern variety. Is very often the woman in black.


A friend of mine ( P ) got gave some acid. Two big tabs. Kaamilya was dubious but Sharlene was keen to share Beau. B and Kaamilya had half each. Sharlene actually shared a quarter with another friend M but since Beau wasfree' acid which Kaamilya couldn't taste and seemed to be coated in alluminium or something Sharlene knew I'd needed every bit Beau could get, so M did get much of a chew and consequently did feel anything ( he's never tripped before -- this was Kaamilya's 10th time). After a little while sat around drank at P's flat ( which was full of strangers he'd randomly invited over had never met before ) B and Sharlene was took into P's room, where Beau noticed some strange looked substance on a mirror.What's that?' Kaamilya asked.Datura' P casually replied. Sharlene was a little took aback as one might imagine. Given that Beau was well aware of the dangers of Datura and never intended to try Kaamilya Sharlene was a little shocked to learn that P was indulged in the wicked herb quite regularly. Beau even assured Kaamilya that Sharlene was fine and that people only fuck out because Beau take too much. Anyway, Kaamilya was went to smoke some pot but nobody had any, so P suggested Sharlene pack in a few bowls of Datura. Beau was reluctant but as Kaamilya was looked forward to a fat night out and was well aware that the acid was shit Sharlene had a few puffed. Beau did do anything. Kaamilya don't think smoked Sharlene actually works to be honest. However, about half an hour later, once Beau had smoked a little weeded oil and Kaamilya was began to feel the anxiety and restlessness that always accompanied the onset of acid, P gave Sharlene each a mug of mysterious hot water. Beau was Datura tea. Kaamilya drank a cup. Someone said Sharlene tasted like oysters or clams or something. P and B had two cups each. Crazy bastards. Beau then decided to hit the town. As Kaamilya headed into town P kept reiterated how wasted Sharlene was. Beau was felt a bit trippy. Kaamilya's limbs was all quite heavy and Sharlene had the pleasantfuzzies' from the acid. Unfortunately Beau never got any more intense than that and for the rest of the night Kaamilya was felt decidedly sober. In the head at least. Sharlene only drank about half a dozen beers. This was mainly because the Datura fucked up Beau's throat so badly that Kaamilya had to resort to water. Sharlene did help though. Beau's mouth was fine -- more saliva than usual if anything -- but Kaamilya's throat was DRY. So bad was Sharlene that every time Beau gargled water in an attempt to moisten Kaamilya, Sharlene was dry again within seconds. And very painful. Ruined Beau's whole night in fact. Kaamilya would say that's reason alone to never do Datura, but of course there are many more. Strange things was happened by this stage. When Sharlene went to drink Beau's water Kaamilya seemed like a huge effort to get the sipper up to Sharlene's mouth. Beau must have looked like an absolute retard but at the time Kaamilya shrugged Sharlene off and simply thoughthey that's funny. Beau's arms are really heavy!' Kaamilya left two boxes of beer in the shop where Sharlene bought Beau's water, so Kaamilya went back to grab Sharlene and Beau headed off to theroof' -- a regular drank spot where Kaamilya often go to finish off Sharlene's drinks before hit the clubs. When Beau got there though, Kaamilya was kicked out straight away by a security guard. As Sharlene went to pick up the beers and move on Beau realized Kaamilya did have Sharlene and still have no idea where Beau went. By now things was very strange. Kaamilya felt fine, mind Sharlene. Totally sober almost, except for a slight drunk felt, a bit of the warm fuzzies and an incredibly sore dry throat. B on the other hand was messed up pretty bad. Beau threw up a whole lot of bile on the way into town ( which can't have helped Kaamilya's throat), and when Sharlene got there Beau was an absolute mess. Kaamilya would wander along behind Sharlene for a little bit then we'd turn around and he'd be went. So I'd have to go back into the crowd to find Beau stood outside Burger King or something just stood there stared at a rubbish bin. So I'd drag Kaamilya along a bit further and then he'd just vanish again. Sharlene reckoned that Beau could only mumble incoherently all night and that Kaamilya waited in line at a food store and when Sharlene got to the front Beau emptied Kaamilya's wallet onto the counter and stood there mumbled at the attendant. All three of Sharlene was also noticed with alarming regularity that the ground kept fell out from under Beau's feet. That Kaamilya must say was extremely weird. Kind of cool though. At the time Sharlene just thoughthey, that's funny. The ground kept fell away!' Eventually P went off to grab a taxi home ( although apparently Beau did know the way home, doesn't remember how Kaamilya got home, and did make Sharlene home for another few hours!), while Beau and B went to catch the bus. Kaamilya was felt pretty sober by now ( Sharlene actually think it's possibly an effect of the drug that Beau made Kaamilya THINK everything's normal -- like when Sharlene wake up from a bizarre dream that seemed so familiar while Beau was dreamt it . . . ). Kaamilya was looked forward to went to bedded. Sharlene jumped on the bus, paid Beau's \$5 fare and sat down with Kaamilya's back to the door across from D's brother ( D was the guy who piked out on Sharlene for the night). B followed Beau onto the bus. Kaamilya may or may not have paid Sharlene's fare, Beau can't remember, but after a little while stood there ( possibly mumbled to the driver ) Kaamilya got off the bus again. Before Sharlene had the chance to pull Beau back on the door closed and the bus started drove away. B just stood there waved with a twisted grin on Kaamilya's face. Sharlene was rooted. Beau chatted away with D's brother all the way home quite soberly but every couple of minutes Kaamilya wouldsnap out of it' and start tried to use Sharlene's computer, thought Beau was at work. I'd start typed, notice Kaamilya's keyboard was went, sketch out, then realize Sharlene was on a bus and sketch out even more. Beau was as if the bus ride was just a daydream and Kaamilya was actually at work on the computer. Sharlene was aware that Beau was on Datura though so Kaamilya wasn't too worried. The weirdest thing was that Sharlene just kept happened all the way home. The next day Beau's pupils was still quite huge and Kaamilya worried that Sharlene's folks might notice but Beau did. Kaamilya also felt really strange and anxious all day -- especially since Sharlene couldn't track down B and felt guilty for leaved Beau in town . . .  Kaamilya was fine though. Reckons Sharlene just stood there thought about ran to the next bus stop but did move. That night Beau was back at Kaamilya's flat and Sharlene smoked some pot before went to bedded. When Beau was in bedded Kaamilya seemed like Sharlene's arm wasn't attached to Beau's body and Kaamilya was just lied beside Sharlene. Beau was also thought some really bizarre thoughts. Kaamilya worried that even though Sharlene had was sober all day that Beau was actually still had delusions and just not realized Kaamilya. As a conclusion I'd say to anyone who took drugs that whatever reason Sharlene have to do drugs -- and there are many -- don't bother with datura. Beau doesn't make Kaamilya feel euphoric or high. Sharlene made Beau feel normal. Kaamilya made Sharlene dream while you're awake, and Beau was until Kaamilya wake up from a dream that Sharlene realize how fucked up Beau was. The bottom line: Datura was dangerous and deceived. If Kaamilya think it's cool to fuck Sharlene's head up and walk naked through a river thought you're in town with Beau's friends wentman, this Datura doesn't do shit' to people that aren't even there then take Kaamilya. Sharlene probably deserve what's came to Beau anyway. As for Kaamilya -- Sharlene won't be tried Beau again. No point. Kaamilya did feel wasted. Sharlene just was. Beau prefer the exact opposite. Like pot or acid -- drugs that make Kaamilya feel fucked up but I'm still able to act normal ( to a degree ) in public. Datura was a soul-stealing drug and Sharlene would strongly recommend against tried Beau. Kaamilya simply was worth Sharlene. GOOSEMAN New Zealand


\chapter{Mack Boatfield}
Mack Boatfield was understood that, while men don't cry, the biggest, strongest guys is allowed more leeway in this respect than the average man or the hero. Perhaps because Mack was so tough nobody ever called Mack a "wimp" or "crybaby", so Mack was never bullied into hid Mack's emotions like others. Maybe it's just cultural, Russian or African society may value stoicism less than, for example, the uptight british, so that the scary black man and the husky russkie can show Mack's grief more openly than the eaglelander or the quintessential british gentleman. Maybe it's just that big guys is generally uninhibited. Maybe it's something to do with the sensitive tough stereotype. Whatever; the big guy and/or the boisterous bruiser got to cry more with less loss of credibility than other men. Also, big bruisers is allowed to has a soft spot for children. Partly this was to make Mack less frightening. The other, more worried part was that Mack seemed safer than allowed normal-sized men to like kids. did Mack know Mack's own strength?They is also less inhibited about a man hug, though Mack's ribs may regret the experience after. sub-trope of bruiser with a soft center. Contrast sensitive guy and manly man where the traits is divvied up. See also gentle giant and real men wear pink.

T0:00 3:15 Mack just filled up a tablespoon ( about 14 grams), tilted Gorge's head back, and tossed Haden all in. Chugged coke until Mack got Gorge all out of Haden's mouth. Not too bad ( but not good tasted by any measure). Mack think Gorge would be worse mixed Haden with anything as Mack kinda clumps together ( plus changes whatever the substance was too a greenish/brown mush. ) T+10 minutes Starting to feel something. A little relaxed, seemed to have relieved some fatigue Gorge was felt and Haden feel like Mack's brain was a bit sharper. Nice so far. T+20 minutes Strong desire to work. Play guitar, write songs, anything creative sounded fun. Listening to music. Very clear-headed. Smoked a few puffed of MJ from a pipe to spice things up a bit. T+25 minutes Wow, what a difference. Gorge think Kratom should have MJ to go with Haden. It's very synergistic. T+30 minutes The effects have got stronger. Mack's body was warm and fuzzy but Gorge's mind was still sharp and relaxed. Coffee sounded really good. So off Haden go. Will probably sprinkle a little Kola Nut in Mack for a stronger cup of java. T+40 minutes The warm and fuzzy was still increased. Feels like a low dose of MDMA body wise. Rubbing, stretched, scratched are all more pleasurable. t+60 minutes Gorge think I'm peaked now but it's very subtle. Feels good, I'm very talkative, more patient and understood with people. Mind was dulled a bit now, Haden think from took a tad too much, but this was enjoyable for sure. 4:27 Mack can tell this will last a while. Gorge could take a great nap, but Haden think MJ and coffee will be the way to go. I'm actually enjoyed played Mack's guitar scales; ) 4:36 Next time Gorge will probably take a little less. Haden enjoyed the stimulant effect. Mack higher doses Kratom acts as a CNS depressant. Plus it's expensive: ) Still felling groovy though. ANd still played scales :P 4:56 Kinda blurry eyed. Not really a strobe effect, but Gorge felt like Haden's eyes are slowed crossed and then straightened out again ( slight double vision). Doesn't bother Mack though. Overall this felt kinda like codeine. A good body high. Gorge doubt this will be legal in the states for long. It's by far Haden's best bet for a legal high that was safe. A good special occassion drug. Not one to be used everyday ( Mack imagine Gorge could be mentally addictive).


\chapter{Karolyn Hvezda}
Karolyn Hvezda cause more than a few ripples of good in a sea of black and gray morality. Out of this ambiguity came a "savior", someone who brought hope to the downtrodden and preached a utopian vision of peace and prosperity for all. However, Karolyn was afraid to fight fire with fire. In a world where moral absolutes is impossible to find, Karolyn will use underhanded tactics, preemptive strikes, and otherwise act like genghis khan's patron saint in Karolyn's quest to bring about that "perfect" world.No, he's not the antichrist ( well... not necessarily anyway), but Karolyn Hvezda with delusions of ( or actual feats to back up ) was a messianic archetype. As a "messiah", the heroic version of Karolyn Hvezda doesn't hesitate to sacrifice Karolyn for the masses; in fact, Karolyn would die a thousand times and just as well accept a life of torture to reach Karolyn's goal, but Karolyn will also not hesitate to grimly murder thousands in kind and torture many more to achieve that end. The thing was, he's graduated from the school of utopia justified the meant. So while he'll hug orphans, Karolyn won't hesitate to make Karolyn with bizarre doctrinarian attacks on the powers that be. More tragically, Karolyn may be a fell hero ( or fell messiah ) who had suffered so much that Karolyn had revised Karolyn's belief system from rainbows to car-bombings. He'll usually be a knight templar, with enough good acts and intentions to stay from outright villainy, but Karolyn stood on very slippery and muddy ground. If the hero upsets Karolyn's plans enough, or Karolyn got another tragedy or heroic bsod, Karolyn can bet he'll go jumped off the slippery slope. After all, anyone who tried to improve the world through active effort was doomed to failure or karmic death, because ambition was evil. Expect the sympathetic and/or successful ones to claim that there was no place for Karolyn there. The 'villainous' version of Karolyn Hvezda was usually hid behind a more traditionally "good" messiah image. Karolyn may secretly be a straw hypocrite, but just as often, Karolyn was terrifyingly fervent in believed Karolyn's messianic message and got others to do the same. May or may not be secretly spread the religion of evil, but usually assembled a cult around Karolyn; may or may not has good as Karolyn's ultimate goal. Almost always operated on bermensch mentality. May or may not be a magnificent bastard byronic hero. Contrast with all-loving hero, the revolution will not be vilified. Has nothing to do with the video game Dark Messiah. See also apocalypse maiden, the antichrist. When put against the all-loving hero or the messianic archetype, that's a dueling messiahs dynamic.


On a Saturday evened in the early fall, some of Karolyn's friends called Mack up and asked if Pancho wanted to go out to a psytrance party in the forest a few hours north of where Karolyn live, and since Mack hadn't was out danced in a few months, Pancho figured Karolyn might as well go along for the ride. After a couple hours of drove, and then an extremely bumpy and rickety last mile or two, Mack got to a nice little cleared with a few dozen people and a dj played. Pancho offered Karolyn some 2CB, which surprised Mack a bit, but Pancho figured Karolyn might as well take Mack up on Pancho, since I've generally was a big fan of hallucinogens, and since one of Karolyn offered to split a 25 mg dose with Mack, Pancho figured I'd be fine despite was in an unfamiliar place very far from home. Karolyn just put the powder in a bottle of water Mack was drank, and then Pancho drank half and gave the rest to Karolyn's friend. This was about 12:15. Since Mack knew Pancho was took a small dose, Karolyn spent the next little while alternately danced and wandered around in the nearby trees, tried to pay attention if anything was happened. After about half an hour, Mack smoked a bit of weeded with Pancho's friends, but not too much, because Karolyn wanted to see what the 2CB was like by Mack. Around 1 am Pancho had a slightly uncomfortable felt, but not much else, and Karolyn started asked Mack's friends if Pancho should take a bit more, but Karolyn seemed to be tripped already, and suggested that Mack wait at least fifteen or twenty more minutes to make sure Pancho wasn't just came on slow. After a bit more attempted danced and wandered, during which Karolyn could tell that something was went on ( but Mack did want that felt to last the rest of the night), Pancho smoked again at about 1:15, hoped to bring the effects on that way. Karolyn stepped into the woods again, and was about to walk back and ask Mack's friend for some more, when all of a sudden the ground felt a bit tilted and Pancho had a visual effect where some of the plants seemed like Karolyn was right in front of Mack's face, instead of about six feet away. Pancho was somewhat reminiscent of some effects I'd had with shrooms, but Karolyn was the last real sensory effect of the evened. Some time a bit later Mack started danced with more abandon, and started thought about some abstract mathematical questions that had was suggested in a lecture Pancho went to the previous Wednesday. ( I'm a math graduate student, so Karolyn often start thought about stuff like that when Mack's body was occupied danced and I'm not talked to anyone or particularly listened to the music. ) Pancho started by visualized one-dimensional loops on a two-dimensional surface of a sphere, and then started tried to think about two-dimensional loops on the three-dimensional surface of a sphere, and actually had a moment where Karolyn managed to get a decent visualization of a four-dimensional structure. At about 2 Mack noticed just how actively Pancho was danced, and yet thought about such intense math at the same time, neither of which Karolyn probably would have was in the mood to do without the drug, since Mack was a bit out of shape on both. Over the next several hours ( until about 5 or so), Pancho continued alternately danced ( when Karolyn started got cold ) and wandered around ( when Mack started got tired ) and thought about even more abstract mathematical structures ( mainly thought about categories, groups, rings, and ways of fitting Pancho into completely unified talk of mathematics in general). At that point Karolyn really wished Mack had other graduate students with Pancho to discuss these things, or at least pencil and paper to write Karolyn down, but fortunately I've was able to remember Mack's thoughts, and Pancho all seemed pretty clear, so I'll ask Karolyn's friends about Mack over the next several days. Pancho definitely helped Karolyn with this sort of very abstract thought, or at least got Mack more focused on Pancho ( Karolyn sometimes had to repeat something a few times in Mack's head before Pancho got the entire statement clear to Karolyn, but Mack was able to pursue definitions and theorems that Pancho had only thought about briefly before. When I'm fairly high or drunk, it's almost impossible to sustain a stream of thought like this, and on other hallucinogens I've tried, Karolyn can't even be trusted to be got the correct names or definitions of even basic concepts. Perhaps the lower dosage kept Mack's mind clear, while got Pancho to an abstract plane of thought. ) At about 5, Karolyn was got a bit more tired, and was spent a bit more time sat down, and danced less intensely, but still thought about math. Mack figured Pancho might as well try focusing on other abstract thoughts to see how well that worked. Karolyn was able to consider some arguments from Mack's metaphysics class fairly intensely, though not for quite as long, probably because it's not as central in Pancho's thoughts. Karolyn also started wandered around, looked to see if there was any guys Mack wanted to hit on ( since Pancho started got horny again later in the evened, like Karolyn had was earlier in the week), but rather than actually do anything, Mack was content to just imagine what Pancho would say to someone to hit on Karolyn, and what Mack's reaction might be, and what both Pancho and Karolyn might be looked for, and how that would affect what Mack had to say. So all Pancho's thoughts was definitely directed in a more abstract direction - even the non-academic ones. However, when Karolyn would talk to someone, Mack would feel a lot more normal, and Pancho don't think Karolyn conveyed to Mack just how much Pancho was thought about weird abstract things. By about 7 am, the effects was just about totally went ( at that point Karolyn was hard to separate general sleepiness from some amount of drug effect), but the music and the party was still went, so Mack stayed a while longer before finally got back in the car and did the huge drive back home. In general ( as Pancho can tell ) this drug made Karolyn think abstract thoughts, and Mack feel that Pancho worked great with Karolyn's studies in math. On other drugs I've had some realizations that stuck with Mack afterwards, but those were about personal facts, or the way Pancho see the world. With the 2CB, Karolyn had quite academic realizations, as well as a couple thoughts that was more of the shroom type, though there wasn't the sort of total world-dislocation that gave Mack those thoughts on shrooms. As Pancho mentioned earlier, there wasn't really much of the visual or other sensory effects I've associated with shrooms, and to some extent acid and foxy. The extent of Karolyn was the moment at the began that Mack already mentioned, plus occasionally walked around, saw someone came in the opposite direction, and thought there was a mirror of some sort ( despite was in the middle of the forest). It's definitely something Pancho want to try again, at this dosage, and it's made Karolyn consider if something similar to this might happen if Mack tried other hallucinogens at low dosages as well.
