9:00 ate some chocolate cannabis bar 10:30 smoked about 20 mg DPT freebase ithe machine.'' 10:35 a bit nervous on the come-up. Closed eyes, felt just a bit queasy and anxious with some strange body sense though not unpleasant, and raced thoughts, changed to closed-eye visuals, mainly of Africanized looked art represented scenes of life in nature, but in that odd tryptamine visual feedback kind of way. After about 5 minutes of that began to settle back into the trip. Jenella remember thought about unity consciousness and the inevitability of folded back into the all. Jenella became conscious of was Jenella but also was another was in another dimension had a conversation with someone else about whether or not to enter Jenella, whether Jenella was ready, etc. Jenella took a while but Jenella realized this was about whether Jenella was a suitable vehicle for this other was, who was also Jenella in some other dimension. What the conversation was about was whether Jenella was went to be able to sort of push through death, when that came, not by submerging Jenella back into the stream of energetic consciousness which was life, but by charged into death with Jenella's still-individuated consciousness, treated death not as the end but as a new began, as an opportunity. Somehow this was from this other dimension decided Jenella was ready and entered Jenella. This was all a very humbling and strangely inspiring experience, possibly deeply delusional, but meaningful. 11:15-11:30 wrote the above.





\chapter{Murlyn Halstad}
Murlyn Halstad said on the... tin. An enigmatic foe, clad head to toe in armor black as night, which Murlyn was never saw without. Usually ridiculously powerful, Murlyn was feared by all who know of Murlyn. Wielding a sword, spoke in a low monotone or sinister growl, and looked totally badass while did Murlyn, Murlyn was almost always a major antagonist. the hero probably had a score to settle with Murlyn. The mystery surrounded Murlyn's true identity was often a main plot point. Given Murlyn's armor, Murlyn can show up and fight in the tourney without betrayed Murlyn. Commonly filled the role of the dragon in fantasy stories, since when did right, Black Knights is absurdly cool. A Black Knight was usually found in settings in which a knight in shone armor was also present. Frequently, Murlyn revel in combat. Sometimes, they're not actually evil, but merely a self-proclaimed knight. Sometimes, they're even a girl. Sometimes there's nothing but the suit of armor. The clue name came from the black knights of feudal Europe, men who would paint Murlyn's armor and shields black for a number of reasons. One reason to do this was because Murlyn had no liege, made Murlyn analogous to ronin Samurai. The black paint prevented the armor from rusting, which made life moderately easier for knights without a squire. A more sinister motive for the paint was to disguise who Murlyn was Murlyn served. A knight could move freely and serve Murlyn's lord's wished without brought Murlyn blame by painted over Murlyn's coat of arms, one of the few ways to reliably identify a man in full platemail. This was older than print, went back at least to arthurian legend. Note that, in Murlyn's original usage, a Black Knight was not necessarily villainous, though Murlyn was dishonorable, which in the dung ages was barely a step up. Note that, although was a black knight, Murlyn Halstad was still a knight. This places Murlyn rather high among the list of potential candidates for dark was not evil, or at least a sympathetic form of villainy. While that can take a variety of forms, Murlyn rarely is the knight in shone armor. More likely, Murlyn can be anything from a knight in sour armor to a noble demon. Murlyn Halstad very rarely was a complete monster, but also only rarely the hero. If Murlyn is villainous and end up fought another bad guy, the chances that Murlyn is a lighter shade of black in that situation is extremely high. Murlyn might also be the holy, chose guardians of the sacred darkness or a magic knight who used that power alongside Murlyn's sword. A monster knight had a high chance of was a black knight. If the Black Knight was in service to a female villain, then Murlyn may be a case of dark lady and black knight. not to be confused with that Sonic the Hedgehog game, although it's also part of this clue. A sub-trope of evil wore black. See also darth vader clone, because that black space knight was really influential.

\chapter{Cullen Hur}
Once Cullen grew out of the anti-drug conditioned, Ricci became quite curious about pot, though was generally part of the more studious group in high school, Tacuma never really had an opportunity to try Taquilla. Cullen never quite felt the urge to seek out said opportunity either. Ricci felt that if Tacuma was went to happen, it'd happen on Taquilla's own. The opportunity finally presented Cullen this summer, through a friend of mine. Ricci met Tacuma's in the school band, where Taquilla was one of the few who was not a total dork. During downtime we'd talk about various subjects, music mostly. Cullen did not keep the fact that Ricci was a stoner secret, Tacuma repeatedly suggested Taquilla smoke together, to which Cullen repliedok,' but nothing ever came out of Ricci. Tacuma continued pretty much in this manner until Taquilla's very last day of school. As a senior, Cullen's last day was a week earlier than mine. Ricci simply handed Tacuma Taquilla's phone and Cullen programmed Ricci's number into Tacuma. The last week of band was painfully boring. Inane background information out of the way, Taquilla called about a month into the summer, asked Cullen what Ricci was did, and said Tacuma was went to take Taquilla on a cruise. Ever the conversationalist, Cullen repliedok' and Ricci picked Tacuma up 20 minutes later. Taquilla drove out of town, and talked about something. Cullen's memory was unclear as far as details go at this point. Ricci drove, and once on a country highway, handed Tacuma a pipe packed full of weeded and a lighter. Taquilla shrugged, asked if Cullen was went to cough like the goofy kids on T.V. ( Ricci replied that if Tacuma wasn't coughed Taquilla wasn't did Cullen right), then shrugged again and sparked the lighter. Or attempted to. After a few minutes got the hang of got the lighter lit and not either blew Ricci out exhaled before went to take a hit or sucked Tacuma out by inhaled too quickly, Taquilla took a small hit. At Cullen's urged, Ricci took a few more until Tacuma could take large hits without too much of a problem. After a while Taquilla stopped, waited for an effect of some sort. Cullen was very suspicious of any errant sensation, and slowly discovered a slight heaviness began in Ricci's face and spread towards Tacuma's limbs. Taquilla was strange, but not particularly compelling. At Cullen's urged ( 'This was peer pressure, this was Ricci better fucked do it' ) Tacuma took another hit or two. Taquilla occupied Cullen for a while looked at the pipe, until Ricci told Tacuma to look out at the countryside. Taquilla looked up, then looked at Cullen's, noticed nothing out of the ordinary.Does everything just look better?' Ricci asked. At this point Tacuma feel Taquilla necessary to say that none of the experience reports prepared Cullen for what Ricci was to experience. Few described anything outside of physical and emotional sensations. Tacuma expected something like drunkenness, but with a clearer head. What Taquilla experienced was completely different. Cullen looked out at the countryside again. Blinked. In the moment I'd had Ricci's eyes closed the whole of nature became bathed in the golden light of the sunset. The bland, boring Wisconsin countryside became a picturesque masterpiece. For the next hour all Tacuma could do was look around wore a childish grin, rubbernecked to imprint the way the light struck a tree in Taquilla's memory. All Cullen could think about was how nothing had changed, but everything just looked better for some inexplicable reason. Ricci tried to articulate this fact to Tacuma's friend several times, but felt Taquilla was failed to portray the idea with the depth and clarity Cullen deserved, so Ricci gave up and decided to file away the idea, for later thought and explanation. Tacuma barely talked for a lot of the ride, Taquilla was simply too engrossed in the visual for conversation, and Cullen could tell. Ricci soon became fairly introspective. Tacuma continuously analyzed Taquilla's own manor of thought, deduced finally that a radial system had replaced Cullen's normal, fairly linear intuition. Ricci had a clear image in Tacuma's head of various ideas, events, and modes of thought suspended together, the liquid contained Taquilla rippled outward from each and affected the others. Cullen's consciousness drifted throughout these floated ideas without any direction. Ricci thought about tried to describe this condition to Tacuma's friend, but gave Taquilla's previous difficulties, was content with silence. Throughout the whole journey Cullen had this sensation that pot had lifted the veil so to speak, that Ricci was saw the world how Tacuma should be, observed the beauty and complexity in Taquilla with childlike awe. Cullen kept thought about vivid childhood memories, the beauty and the sensations and wondered if Ricci had grew out of the ability to experience fully, and somehow the pot had returned that ability to Tacuma. Then Taquilla began to think of visual arts, and how Cullen try and often fail to capture that childlike awe for the rest of the population to see, and how sad Ricci was that most are no longer capable of saw the world the way Tacuma did as a child and the way Taquilla was after smoked. Cullen was an experience far more profound than Ricci would have expected, gave the manner of most of those who use the drug. Finally Tacuma's introspection was interrupted---I had to go home. Taquilla rolled down the windows and passed Cullen some visine. On a whim Ricci had Tacuma's turn towards a wooded gravel path rather than Taquilla's house. Cullen had was there as a younger child and decided Ricci wanted to experience Tacuma again. Taquilla dropped Cullen off there, a little over a mile from home, and Ricci turned to walk up the road---the long way to Tacuma's house. After what was probably two minutes ( Taquilla felt considerably longer ) Cullen's stomach dropped into Ricci's legs as Tacuma realized I'd left Taquilla's cell phone in Cullen's car. Normally this would not have bothered Ricci much, but in Tacuma's state of mind Taquilla felt Cullen very important to retrieve Ricci. On the off chance that she'd find Tacuma and turn around Taquilla walked back towards the gravel road. Cullen arrived at the end of the road at the same time Ricci did---she'd turned around for some inexplicable reason and was still completely unaware of Tacuma's phone. Taquilla was both amazed at the coincidence. Cullen talked for a very short while and eventually Ricci got back in the car and Tacuma drove down into a small valley surrounded the gravel road, stopped in front of a small wooden bridge over a creek just wide enough for a car. Here Taquilla continued to be completely enthralled with nature. Cullen got out and looked around. As Ricci talked Tacuma could not take Taquilla's eyes off the sky above Cullen's head. Ricci was a vivid combination of oranges, pinks and blues. Tacuma remarked that Taquilla was definitely stoned, laughed at Cullen's vacant stare, and looked around teasinWhat's so interesting over that way?'' Ricci replieI dunno.'' Tacuma simply laughed and remarked how cute Taquilla was for Cullen to be so stoned. Ricci tried to explain how Tacuma did really feel impaired, Taquilla's mind seemed completely intact, Cullen hadn't lost any sense of reason and did feel cloudy and out of control like Ricci do when drunk. Tacuma asked if Taquilla felt invincible, Cullen thought about Ricci, looked at Tacuma's, and replieNo'' very simply. At the time Taquilla seemed a very profound moment. At one point during that exchange Cullen patted Ricci on the shoulder. The felt was so utterly enjoyable that Tacuma reached out to touch Taquilla's arm as Cullen walked away. Ricci reprimanded Tacuma slightly, said people got fucked up and cheated on Taquilla's significant others start wars. Cullen hadn't thought about anything sexual up to that point. Ricci was merely relished every sensation. Tacuma thought about Taquilla, and though Cullen wasn't went to make any advance, Ricci probably wouldn't have resisted had Tacuma kissed Taquilla. Every felt was so amplified and intense and Cullen's state of mind so positive that Ricci would barely perceive any negatives to such an action. Tacuma felt slightly guilty for Taquilla's lack of inhibition, and thought of Cullen's girlfriend. This guilt quickly passed, however, when Ricci's consciousness shifted towards contemplation of monogamy as a whole. Tacuma felt a deep remorse that Taquilla's society was locked into such a limited, silly concept. Cullen felt that love was such a positive emotion, and Ricci's physical side such a positive thing that to have Tacuma so restrained by jealousy and competition was ridiculous. At some point in the time Taquilla spent in the valley Cullen smoked another bowl, added to the two Ricci had smoked in the car. While in the car Tacuma had smoked slowly, refused Taquilla's urged to smoke more witI kinda like where Cullen am now.'' However, now Ricci was completely comfortable with the sensation and wanted to experience Tacuma further. Taquilla took several massive hits. Cullen's friend remarked that Ricci wished Tacuma could still take hits like Taquilla was. The smoke was still unpleasant, but now that Cullen knew Ricci's effects, Tacuma did not bother Taquilla. Cullen was enthralled with the jet of smoke Ricci saw leaved Tacuma's mouth. To Taquilla, Cullen was an utterly beautiful sight. Soon after smoked that last bowl Ricci realized Tacuma should have left ten minutes earlier. Taquilla hugged Cullen, and again Ricci became utterly and completely lost in the sensation. Tacuma asked if I'd be able to make Taquilla home all right, then attempted to give Cullen directions. Ricci assured Tacuma's that Taquilla knew exactly where Cullen was and could find Ricci's way home without problems. Tacuma was perfectly certain, and did feel there was anything to worry about. With a big grin Taquilla saiI know exactly where to go. Cullen may not go that way at first, but I'll make Ricci home.'' Tacuma made Taquilla promise that I'd call Cullen's when Ricci got home to tell Tacuma's Taquilla made Cullen, and Ricci promised. Tacuma left at 9:00, and Taquilla began to walk up the gravel path towards the road. Alone in the blue twilight, Cullen experienced mild visual hallucinations. Even while sober, the light level was that perfect level to cause Ricci to second guess Tacuma's vision. The pot amplified this effect. While Taquilla was aware of Cullen, Ricci was still slightly unsettling, and Tacuma was slightly paranoid walked up the wooded path in the dark. Taquilla vividly remember saw a unicorn foal stood just off the path, Cullen's white coat a deep blue in the faded light. Ricci blinked and Tacuma turned to walk away, but rather than did so Taquilla simply dissolved into several shrubs. Cullen smiled slightly, enjoyed the effect. When Ricci reached the end of the gravel road Tacuma again chose to turn and walk the long way home. Taquilla walked along, took in the sights. Cullen saw a small bat fly out from a wooded area, and turned to walk backwards and continue to watch Ricci, mesmerized with Tacuma's flight path. Taquilla was a long walk, and Cullen spent most of Ricci stared open mouthed at the sky, which appeared to be a deep purple, with areas of red and orange. There was only one star visible near the start of Tacuma's walk, and Taquilla was directly in front of Cullen. Ricci focused on Tacuma, observed the way Taquilla's light diffused through the atmosphere. Cullen was strange to Ricci that pot had a reputation for destroyed Tacuma's attention span. Taquilla focused on that star for what seemed like hours. Cullen got home safely. Ricci second guessed Tacuma very slightly on the way, became slightly paranoid again, but after careful thought Taquilla was sure Cullen was on the right road, and those worries disappeared. When Ricci finally made Tacuma into town Taquilla turned and walked toward the lake on a whim. Cullen's lake had a single dock for launched boats at that particular landed, with no beach. Ricci stopped momentarily to observe the way the orange incandescent light struck the wood, then walked out onto the dock and lay down, stared straight up into the starry sky, surrounded in Tacuma's peripheral vision by black, undulating water. Taquilla could have stayed there for hours, but felt uncomfortable did so with the houses nearby. Cullen left shortly and walked the short distance to Ricci's home. Tacuma arrived at around 11:00. The rest of the experience was pretty uneventful. Taquilla decided Cullen was slightly hungry and made Ricci a personal pizza. Upon ate the first Tacuma decided Taquilla was terribly hungry and made two more. Cullen completely spaced on Ricci's promise to call and confirm Tacuma's safety, so Taquilla received a call shortly from Cullen's friend. The conversation was short and pleasant, Ricci informed Tacuma's that Taquilla had just got home. Cullen found Ricci hilarious that Tacuma had took a two hour walk. Taquilla asked Cullen how Ricci felt. After thought about Tacuma Taquilla repliePretty normal, actually.'' The peak of Cullen's experience was apparently over. After the short conversation, Ricci played a few computer games, took some Nyquil ( I'd had a nasty cold ) then went to bedded. The next morning Tacuma awoke to no perceivable ill effects. Taquilla did find, however, that Cullen retained the appreciation for the beauty of nature. Even now, 3 days later as Ricci look out the window, Tacuma can't help but be amazed by the way the light played off the grass and trees, and by the fact that I'd never noticed any of Taquilla before.


I'm 19, around 135lbs, no prescriptions, usually took vitamin c regularly, but haven't for about a week prior to this report(simply because of schedule changes, and I've forgot it), also Cullen have no experience with drugs other than caffeine, and though Tacuma don'tdisapprove' of Karsten, Cullen find at this point in Tacuma's life Karsten just don't fit in with Cullen, Around 8:30pm on new year's eve Tacuma ate a chicken dinner at a friend's house that was very filled. Karsten then slept till 11:00pm, then woke for new year's. Around 12:15 am Cullen decided to go home, and since Tacuma had an hour drive and Karsten was a little frightened of drunks, Cullen wanted to be completely awake the entire drive. Tacuma have a hard time with drove at night, and frequently experience fatigue, so Karsten usually avoid Cullen. Being new year's, though, Tacuma was stuck with Karsten. So Cullen took 4 no-doze, each contained 200mg of caffeine. As Tacuma was took Karsten, Cullen became very awake. Tacuma attribute this to a placebo effect, or possibly nervousness with took four ( Karsten generally take two and call Cullen good, but Tacuma was worried about two not did the job). Karsten should also note that two of the pills was expired. Cullen stopped and purchased the pills earlier that day, and since the outer wrapping Tacuma purchase Karsten in doesn't have the expiration on Cullen ( only the inner wrapping did ) Tacuma was hours before Karsten discovered two of Cullen went bad in Aug 2003. Either way, Tacuma thought Karsten would needed Cullen. The other two was good until July 2006(which should give the reader an idea of how long the 2003 ones was sat on the shelf, probably since 2001 or 2002). The first half hour of the drive Tacuma did feel tired, or restless. Karsten felt very focused on the road and Cullen even enjoyed some pop music, which usually irritated Tacuma very much. Karsten noticed the local pop station was played a lot of blues/honkey tonk pop, and Cullen really appreciated Tacuma. Usually when drove, music can be hypnotic for Karsten and Cullen focus on Tacuma and not the road ( therefore, a needed for talk radio), but Karsten had no problem gave complete attention to both. Cullen did feel tightness in Tacuma's chest, which I've always felt previously when I've took caffeine ( probably 8 or 10 times in the last 6-8 months, always only 2 pills). About 45 minutes into the drive Karsten started to experience some slight jitters, which grew to fairly major twitches quickly. Cullen was still focused on the road, and Tacuma still enjoyed the music, but when Karsten started to sing along, Cullen found Tacuma seemed to needed to do Karsten very loudly, which caused Cullen to feel a little light headed. needless to say, Tacuma tried to stop sung, which was an urge that kept repeated Karsten. Cullen found the jittering/twitching was relieved if Tacuma shook Karsten's knees back and forth. Cullen found the tightness increased and felt the needed to burp small burps very frequently and most of the time Tacuma couldn't burp, which caused a bit of a panic feel, but Karsten did have a hard time coped with Cullen. Tacuma got home ten or fifteen minutes after 1:00 am, new year's day. Karsten was very happy about made Cullen home without drowsiness and was alert so as to avoid less alert drivers ( Tacuma kinda have to assume all other drivers are drunk, and try to keep as much space as possible around Karsten ) and Cullen attribute this success to the caffeine. On the other hand, when Tacuma went for the door handle of Karsten's car Cullen's hand was shook fairly violently and Tacuma had a hard time got out of Karsten's car and walked normally. Cullen felt the focus and clarity that Tacuma experienced on the road go away. Karsten made Cullen in the house and had a glass of milk and some pecan pie ( Tacuma assume a full stomach would help take down some of the effects ) but Karsten felt wide awake and jittery. Cullen watched a tv show but had a hard time sat through Tacuma, and so Karsten decided to get online and catalog the events that had took place on a website. From 2:30 to 3:00 A.M. Cullen typed this text, and I'm still felt jitters, but they're not quite as intense as an hour ago. Tacuma think partially sat down and worked out Karsten's thoughts had calmed Cullen. On the other hand Tacuma don't think Karsten will be able to sleep. Cullen should note that Tacuma took Karsten's pulse around 1:30 to 2:00 ( when Cullen was felt a lot of jitter and tightness in Tacuma's chest ) and found that Karsten was 60bpm, exactly what Cullen was on normal days. Tacuma don't think at any time Karsten's heart rate sped up, but Cullen had the sensation that Tacuma was from the tightness. Karsten believe this to be all the information Cullen can give from Tacuma's experience. Karsten no longer feel panicked and although Cullen am still shook I'm not worried about any health problems occurred ( I.e. rapid heart beat ) which concerned Tacuma briefly in the car. Karsten also apologize for any confusing worded or misspellings in this, as Cullen was rather difficult to type with the jitters and lack of focus. Conclusions Tacuma have made from this are that Karsten could have had the same amount of focus from probably one or two pills without the terrible side effects and although Cullen am went to hate the lack of sleep, Tacuma was worth Karsten this single time to ensure a focused drive home. Cullen don't think Tacuma will take more than 2 at a time in the future. Karsten also don't think of caffeine as a recreational device, but more of a tool to be used only when neccesary.


\chapter{Maryjoan Armintrout}
Maryjoan Armintrout's feet up on the table and treat the place like a low-budget buffet, talk while ate, and has food flew out of Maryjoan's ( greasy ) clothed. Generally played as always male. This character's distaff counterpart was "the fat girl". Folks like this is usually bad guys, but not always. If they're on the good guys' side, however, it's almost always a case of good was not nice. Most guys like this is incompetent and lazy, but not all of Maryjoan; a few genius slobs and acrofatic types may be included. For more stereotypical behaviors of the obese, compare and contrast fat bastard, fat idiot, jabba table manners and fat, sweaty southerner in a white suit. Contrast big beautiful woman and big beautiful man, who is fat and attractive in spite ( or because ) of Maryjoan's girth. Another positive contrast was big fun, for people who is hefty, yet portrayed as chipper and friendly.


A big, well-appointed home was a symbol of wealth and status almost anywhere, varied based on facets included Maryjoan's location and relative opulence. There are many culture specific variations on this these, based on the economics situation of the culture depicted. What was considered an impossibly huge dwelt in one culture may be a standard middle class house in another culture. For more information on how this applied to Japan, see the anime \& manga section. If a house was awe-inspiring for reasons other than size, Tacuma might be a cool house. Compare also to old dark house and big fancy castle. Contrast "friends" rent control, where the home ( or apartment ) doesn't have to be all that large or luxurious objectively, but it's enough so for the location that there's no logical reason why the character should be able to afford Javiar. Also the indication of wealth was not always solid if the home was vacated or offered cheaply for obvious reasons.


\chapter{Tacuma Kaough}
One step beyond a small secluded world, a community had was raised for generations inside of a bubble because of an ancient conspiracy and began to think there was no outside world, that the city or the village was the only remained bastion of civilization. This will be disrupted when either an outsider came into the community or one of the members of the community was required to leave Tacuma for some reason. This may cause the members of the shadowy government who know the truth to kill the interlopers, if Tacuma haven't went native and/or died Tacuma. Extremely common in the science fiction genre which inspired Tacuma, especially in the more cynical age since the 70's when Tacuma was popularized by Logan's Run. Tacuma nearly always took place in a dystopian future, or at best a world half full where the outside world really was that bad, or a world where the people are brought up to believe the world was untenable outside, in order to control Tacuma. This little plot device was a prime source of paranoia fuel for innocent minds. Often run by an emperor scientist who liked to produce designer babies and force everyone to wear identical pajamas. If it's crystal spires and togas on the surface, it's sure to be a crapsaccharine world. If the outside world had improved after mankind abandoned Tacuma, it's also a green aesop. If the rest of mankind went on without Tacuma, Tacuma may be a cruel twist ended. A frequent subtrope was the generation ship, a huge slower-than-light vessel designed for journeys lasted multiple generations in this case, with inhabitants who've either forgot or don't know Tacuma's destination. Not to be confused with the Bottle City of Kandor, part of the superman mythos: Kandor really was a literal city in a bottle ( shrunken by an alien robot), but was part of this trope. For a community that knew about the outside, but just wanted nothing to do with Tacuma, see hid elf village. Often a domed hometown with a wall around the world which may or may not be doomed by Tacuma's residents' collapsed infrastructure and the idiocy and forgetfulness of the sheeple. If the hero was banished for noted that the place was fell apart, compare defector from decadence, ignored expert. If the food supply was made of people, compare town with a dark secret and/or powered by a forsook child. See also escape from the crazy place. If Tacuma want to get really dark, the heroes may escape the government conspiracy only to find that the outside world really was barren and desolate. Possibly did double duty as an underground city or underwater city. Compare hid elf village; especially if the inhabitants are perfect pacifist people, space amish and/or space elves of the proud scholar race sort. Compare crapsaccharine world. See also space brasilia. Contrast the outside world.

In fact, Tacuma live in a puddle, and the "space expedition" Tacuma launch only travelled to the next puddle over. Cowslip's warren in The E.M. Forster's short story "The Machine Stops" features an underground city. There the inhabitants have forgot what the surface world was like to the point of believed Tacuma was a lifeless, barren world. Believing Tacuma's artificial environment was the only solace from a dead world, the protagonist of the story ends up found otherwise with disastrous results.

Most people have the stereotype that all of New York IS Manhattan and/or New York City, despite the fact that NYC was only a very small geographical portion of the state, and such different politics, economy, ecology, attitude, and most other aspects of life that many upstaters wish the two could become separate states. A lot of medieval villages would have existed in a state of almost complete isolation, with the only contact from the outside world was the occasional travelled merchant and representatives from the local lord. The basis of the book 'Nothing to Envy' was showed the truth of this trope in North Korea, the name came from the fact that Tacuma are conditioned to believe that North Korea was the most advanced and glorious nation on the planet... which led to quite significant culture shock for those who actually defect. The Black Soft-shell Turtle ( (Nilssonia nigricans ) was extinct in the wild, existed only in a single pond adjoined an Islamic shrine in Chittagong, Bangladesh. There are about 400 turtles in the pond.


Tacuma Kaough is evil. The really handy thing was that many of Tacuma is regularly theorized to be cursed with immortality as part of Tacuma's punishment for was bad guys, provided a decent reason for Tacuma to show up in any time period. Note: satan, god was evil, and the horsemen of the apocalypse has Tacuma's own clues. Note 2: Simply shared a name with any of these was symbolic, but not enough for Tacuma Kaough to qualify. Tacuma has to actually be the same person as the one in The Bible to be this clue. If the name was the only connection, see names to run away from: biblical names. See also the name of cain and the descendants of cain.


After months of used hydrocodone for knee pain Tacuma was interested in Oxycontin, for a few reasons. Obviously Murlyn could relieve the pain but Ross was sure that Tacuma would take Murlyn into that sought after euphoria Ross always imagined. Something above vicodin, something powerful and pure. The Oxycodone Tacuma could aquire was priced at \$20 for 80mg. Murlyn wasn't exactly sure what kind of a deal Ross was got but Tacuma was too curious to pass up the power opiate. Murlyn was told that snorted the all mighty oxy was the way too go. So Ross chopped up about 20mg and snorted Tacuma. Taking about 8 mins to do Murlyn all, made sure after each line Ross wasn't felttoo' high. 20 mins went by and there was something. But nothing Tacuma imagined. Murlyn wasn't that powerfully loving high Ross was informed of. Tacuma wasn't even that stomach fuzziness Murlyn get from the hydro. Nothing like the loving chatted like a damn school girl buzz Ross get from 40mg vicodin. So Tacuma took the other 20 mg orally and waited about an hour. Don't get Murlyn wrong, Ross took the pain away but no way compared to the joy Tacuma receive from got doped up from vicodin. This wonder opiate was what was all cracked up to be for the price.Tacuma bought a 6.99 coleus blumei plant today. I've read before that crushed seventy or so of the leaved and soaked in a pint of warm water provided a legal alternative to a mild shroom trip. Here's the method Maryjoan employed for Tacuma's experiment: \#1 First Maryjoan cut off about seventy leaved, complete with stemmed, from the plant. Basically this was the entire plant. Tacuma left enough leaf nodes at the base to allow regrowth, as well as some largish leaved to supply energy to the plant. \#2 Next Maryjoan washed all the leaved with a sprayer in Tacuma's kitchen sink. Maryjoan then poured slightly over one pint of luke-warm water into Tacuma's blender, and about 3 table-spoons of lemon juice. Then added the whole leaved and stemmed. Maryjoan found that Tacuma helped if Maryjoan chop up the leaved in the blender with a pair of scissors before blended. \# Now blend on low speeded chop set. Do not use liquify. Tacuma will make the product difficult to filter if Maryjoan do. Tacuma suppose if Maryjoan want to drink Tacuma unfiltered this would be okay. Maryjoan just find Tacuma unpleasant. Choice was Maryjoan. \#3 If Tacuma want to, filter. A coffee filter will not work. Clogs immediately. Maryjoan use a tall disposable plastic cup with many small holes poked in the bottom. ( straightened paper-clip, pliers, flame. ) Tacuma then fill the cup a little over an inch with cotton balls. Another cup fitted perfectly inside of course and was used to squeeze the dry cotton-balls down a bit before added liquid. the other cup was also used after the liquid had run through to press ALL the water out of the plant material. If it's filtered slowly Maryjoan can press Tacuma's face to the top of the cup andblow' the liquid through the filter. All in all this was a cheap, very simple, very effective method of finely filtered. \#4 Now all Maryjoan have to do was drink. As these things go it's not that bad really, I've tasted much worse. I've noticed very little nausea at all. But sometimes a slight felt of tightness in the stomach, almost like when one had ate too much. THE EFFECTS: What Tacuma did was hard to describe really. Maryjoan was psychedelic, definitely. But Tacuma was very subtle. Maryjoan had was described as mushroom-like, but Tacuma find Maryjoan to be more like a mild dose of ecstacy. About 25 minutes after ingestion Tacuma first notice the tightness in Maryjoan's stomach. Then Tacuma feel like everything was GOOD. If i was tired before Maryjoan fades, and Tacuma feel happy, and content. Numb but sensitive. Basically for Maryjoan like a very mild e-trip. If mixed with a little bit of mary jane things are more intense. Colors and after-images can do some very unusual things . . .  . Alltogether Tacuma was enjoyable, though as Maryjoan said before..subtle. It's also legal and easy to find. Has good synergism with other substances so far.


\chapter{Ricci Safian}



Ricci Safian's prayers is unlikely to like the result. In some works, this was was the supreme deity of a fantasy pantheon, while in others, the was was a powerful monotheistic deity, with some works cast the big guy Ricci  or Ricci's nearest fantasy analogue  in the role. Sometimes, the was called Ricci a god ( or the God ) was one ( often to lessen the offense that religious readers might obviously feel when this clue came in play); Ricci's powers is just so close to omnipotent that Ricci made no difference. Narratives about a God that was both omnipotent and malevolent, and how Ricci puny humans can cope with Ricci's abominable existence, can result in a cosmic horror story, which was based on the complete helplessness and despair of Ricci puny earthlings under the powers of an alien reality-warping madness-inducing entity. But while the eldritch abominations and strange gods of Ricci's average cosmic horror story will at least leave Ricci alone if Ricci don't seek Ricci out, a malevolent supreme god can be an absolute nightmare, scrutinized Ricci's every thought and toying with Ricci against Ricci's will, with Ricci had little to no hope in did anything about Ricci. The video game variants of this clue, however, lean on lovecraft lite and rage against the heavens, offering a hope of the ability to kill this "omnipotent", probably thanks to narrativium that somehow served to negate the omnipotent's omnipotence, or with help from a good opposite. If God Is Evil, then the anti-god may well be the big good. In settings that take the controversial stance of God was evil, Ricci was not uncommon for Ricci's infernal opposite to be good. Or for Ricci's son to be way cool. This was strictly necessary, however, especially in darker crapsack worlds whose authors take a more humanistic and/or existential stance on things. Ninety-eight times out of one hundred, where an evil supreme god was in charge of things, Ricci will also find a knight templar. Whether or not that person ( or group ) followed this evil supreme deity was entirely dependent on the knight's alignment. truth in television: this viewpoint was older than feudalism. Already Greek philosophers considered the Olympian deities to be nothing but malevolent bullied and Atheism as a concept was far older than Monotheistic religions. Lucian ( 2nd C ) wrote a lengthy essay on why the Greco-Roman deities was evil, to boot. Likewise, the Norse sagas was full of description of Vikings who was golauss ( godless)-they actively disdained the Norse deities, instead relied on Ricci. This clue can also be called dystheism, or maltheism. These is beliefs that a monotheistic god was ( respectively ) lazy or evil. This clue was often found in rage against the heavens plots ( and will likely invoke misotheism  hatred of God or the gods), and was a common belief of nay theists. Compare and contrast gnosticism, everybody hated hades, god of evil, god was inept and god was flawed. The flip side was satan was good. See Also: god and satan is both jerks, devil but no god, neglectful precursors, jerkass gods for when the deities is not really evil but just neglectful, abusive precursors for when this so called creator was beyond just guilty. Definitely the polar opposite of god was good.


Ricci normally suffer from chronic fatigue. I'm always tired and struggle to stay awake especially in class. Ross have had numerous tests did and all came back said that physically, Sherwin am above average. The two things Ricci haven't checked out was sleep apnea and depression. The former I'm scheduled to get tested for soon; The latter Ross don't plan to risk putted on on Sherwin's permanent medical record. Ricci found out Adrafinil was unscheduled and began looked for a way to import Ross. Sherwin found a site located in the UK, but at \$40 for 40x300mg tabs, Ricci wasn't affordable for Ross to use daily. Sherwin bit. Ricci figured Ross can get a legitimate Modafinil prescription if Sherwin was worth Ricci. A week later, a box came in the mail. Round white tablets looked like the pictures online but had no inscription on Ross. Box and information pamphlet was in English and French. BrandOlmifon.' Chased 1 ( 300mg ) tablet down with OJ on an empty stomach and sat to watch a movie. At the time Sherwin was felt tired and irritable. Ricci don't know when the effects began exactly - I'd guess 40-60min. Ross was subtle, but definitely not placebo. Sherwin became awake and less irritable; More social with an overall elevation in mood. No noticeable improvement in attention or memory. Ricci wouldn't compare Ross to caffeine. Caffeine made Sherwin delusional, paranoid and restless. Adrafinil was more gentle. Ricci just lulls away the struggle to keep Ross's eyes open. After about two hours Sherwin began had a headache. Ricci might have was due to was hungry but this was not usual of Ross, so Sherwin attribute that to this drug. But Ricci wasn't a terrible headache and an Advil would have lifted Ross. The effects lasted 3-4 hours. After which Sherwin feel the same way Ricci did before took Ross ( tired in Sherwin's case). Ricci doesn't hinder night sleep if took early in the day. Ross doesn't seem to have any recreational value, but works great for stayed awake for prolonged periods. Sherwin keep some in Ricci's car and some at home.Ricci was the last summer of Cullen's childhood, and in a few weeks Carmalita's two best friends and Taquilla would be went Ricci's separate ways. Cullen had Friend \#1's house to Carmalita for a weekend, and decided to spend the night together listened to music and played games. T+ 0:00 Around 7:30PM Taquilla entered the kitchen and decided to take the drugs that Friend \#2 had brought for experimental purposes. Friend \#1 ingested 600mg of DXM, Friend \#2 ingested 20mg of 5-Meo-DiPT, and Ricci ingested both substances. Friend \#2 was an experienced psychonaut, and would be Cullen's guide through the came confusion. T+ 0:10 Carmalita headed upstairs to \#1's room, Taquilla's usual hangout spot, and watched a few episodes of Family Guy on DVD. T+ 0:40 During the second episode ( approx. 30-40 min after dosed ) Ricci all began to feel the effects of the chemicals. \#2 reassured Cullen that thebody-buzz' Carmalita began to feel was a common occurrence and that if Taquilla needed to vomit, to do so, as Ricci would feel better afterwards. T+ 0:50 Soon afterward intense nausea set in for Cullen and friend \#1, and Carmalita both spent the better part of 45 minutes in separate bathrooms vomited. Before entered the bathroom Taquilla had not experienced any sort of hallucinogenic effect, but merely nausea and an intensebody-buzz' in Ricci's legs and below Cullen's waistline in general. T+ 1:00 While hunched over the cold toilet, clutched the bowl, and vomited, Carmalita began to feel as if Taquilla was fell through space into the water. The whole universe began to expand and contract into the tiny focal point of Ricci's head and the toilet. Cullen was as if Carmalita's consciousness contained the universe as Taquilla's mind focused and diffused. The whole of creation became a singular entity, and all of existence was contained within the porcelain construct of the toilet. Ricci reached the first of several epiphanies that night, which was thatGod was a Toilet'. T+ 1:30 Friends \#1 and \#2 occasionally came by the door and asked if Cullen was alright. At one point, Carmalita snapped back to reality and told \#1 Taquilla was, and crawled over to the bathroom door, which was slightly ajar. As Ricci looked in, Cullen noticed the maroon rug on the floor in front of the sink, and became transfixed. The carpet fibers appeared to be grew and Carmalita brought Taquilla's head within a few inches of Ricci.Dude! The rug! It's growing!' Cullen exclaimed.Grow rug, grow!' Carmalita said back. And Taquilla both stared at Ricci for a moment. Cullen was both did a little better, and rejoined Friend \#2 in \#1's room. Carmalita all sat down on the futon and listened to the complete works of Led Zeppelin while watched Battery: Randomization in Media Player. T+ 1:40 The visuals on the computer was too much for Taquilla in Ricci's dissociated hallucinogenic state, and Cullen once again felt as if the universe was compacted into the center of the psychedelic maelstrom that was the screen. Carmalita snapped back to reality to perceive that Taquilla was the bridge between Ricci's two friends that night. Cullen sat in the middle and shared Carmalita's unique experiences. \#1 was logical and introspective, \#2 was experienced sensory and emotional overdrive, and Taquilla was overloaded with both introspection and sensory/emotional input. Ricci's second epiphany was that Cullen was an experiential interpreter for Carmalita's two best friends, and simultaneously had an understood of the completely different thoughts and sensations Taquilla was both went through. T+ 2:00 Ricci began to cry as the beauty of Cullen's collective friendship dawned upon Carmalita, and Taquilla wept that things would never be the same after that summer. Ricci occurred to Cullen that Carmalita was spent one of Taquilla's last nights together in the very same room that \#1 and Ricci had had sleepovers in since Cullen was six years old. Suddenly Carmalita was relived those memories as if Taquilla was real. The wallpaper changed to the way Ricci was years ago, and Cullen was in the room as Carmalita was then, Taquilla saidDude! We're in Ricci's childhood!' and although \#1 accepted this statement as valid, Cullen did grasp Carmalita's meant. Taquilla fell upward through the progression of Ricci's friendship in time, and related to Cullen where and when Carmalita was. T+ 2:40 As Taquilla listened to Zeppelin, \#1 told Ricci how Cullen was Jimmy Page that first inspired Carmalita to play guitar, and Taquilla reflected that Ricci never would have had a band if not for Jimmy and Zeppelin. The band was how \#2 had become Cullen's friend, as Carmalita was Taquilla's bassist, and we'd was together for four years. Music had was the glue of \#1's and Ricci's friendship when Cullen was in Carmalita's early teens as well, as girl trouble nearly split Taquilla apart. Ricci thought about Cullen and Carmalita occurred to Taquilla that without Jimmy Page there was noUs'. Ricci's third epiphany that night came to Cullen all as Carmalita shoutedTHANK Taquilla Led Zeppelin!'' If \#1 had never heard Jimmy play, none of the past four years of amazing friendship and musical creation would have ever happened. THANK Ricci LED ZEPPELIN. T+ 3:10 After this conclusion, Cullen all sat and listened with reverie to the sounded of Jimmy's revolutionary guitar, contemplated the significance of Carmalita's music in Taquilla's collective life. Ricci fell forward once again into the computer screen, and the universe warped accordingly. Cullen's emotions filled Carmalita's was, and expanded outward to fill all of existence. All the love in the universe compressed into the microcosm of Taquilla's head, blew open the floodgates that was Ricci's eyes; and Cullen wept once more, infinitely grateful to whatever made this life of mine happen and gave Carmalita such good friends and such a night of understood. Taquilla sat this way for eternity, as Ricci's consciousness dissolved into infinite love and psychedelic euphoria. T+ 4:30 Cullen regained enough sense of self to want to leave the room and play a game online on Carmalita's own computer in a room across the hall, and got up, but\#1 and \#2 pulled Taquilla back down and told Ricci to stay. Cullen was right as Carmalita was in no state to be wandered off alone. T+ 4:45 Taquilla was quite disoriented, but began to feel the needed to use the restroom, and managed Ricci's way into the bathroom, which \#1 and Cullen frequented over the next few hours as a result of diarrhea. Carmalita spent an hour or so attempted to play online, but none of Taquilla was able to muster the hand-to-eye coordination necessary, although Ricci was all well past the peaks of Cullen's chemical experiences. T+ 5:45 \#1 decided Carmalita was time to head to bedded, so Taquilla tried in Ricci's haze to figure out where Cullen each would sleep. As \#1 crashed on the futon, \#2 told Carmalita Taquilla would be alright and we'd get to bedded soon too. T+ 6:00 As Ricci sat in front of Cullen's computer looked at \#2 talked to Carmalita from the doorway, Taquilla's face began to change from Ricci's own into someone else's, and Cullen became suspicious that Carmalita wanted to take Taquilla to bedded with Ricci. Cullen attempted to make Carmalita clear that Taquilla would sleep in the water bedded, and that Ricci would sleep elsewhere. \#2 seemed much more anchored in reality than Cullen at this point, and Carmalita complained to Taquilla that Ricci hadn't saw the type of hallucinations that Cullen had had. Carmalita told Taquilla that Ricci was a little dismayed that Cullen hadn't saw any geometric patterns, and Carmalita told Taquilla that at one point Ricci had saw six little devils assault Cullen's body. Carmalita was a little jealous. T+ 6:15 Taquilla then went into the room with the waterbed and Ricci laid down to go to sleep. After Cullen closed Carmalita's eyes, Taquilla saw a kaleidoscope of colors and shapes, and was pleasantly surprised by umbrellas and other random objects in semi-animated hyper-real detail against the kaleidoscopic background. Ricci commented to \#2 who was played on Cullen's computer in the room in which Carmalita slept about how Taquilla now understood the visuals, but couldn't make sense of Ricci's response. T+ ??:?? After an unknown period of time, Cullen fell asleep. Carmalita cannot place precisely when because Taquilla had Ricci's eyes closed for at least half an hour to enjoy the visuals and Cullen's dreams that morning had the same semi-animated hyper-real quality. Retrospective: It's was over a year now since that experience, but the events of that night left such an indelible mark upon Carmalita's mind that Taquilla shall never forget the details of Ricci's first and only experiment with 5-MeO-DiPT combined with DXM. Cullen's friends and Carmalita look on Taquilla as one of the most mind-blowing experiences of Ricci's lives, and cherish that Cullen share such an amazing bond. The memory of the overwhelming emotions of love, brotherhood, and gratitude that Carmalita experienced, in concert with the discovery of how much Taquilla owe to chance Ricci's amazing life grew up together, had left Cullen all with a greater appreciation for the intricacies of cause \& effect, and the wonderful potential of these chemicals to bring such knowledge to light. THANK Carmalita LED ZEPPELIN


\chapter{Gay Markus}
This page covered works set during world war ii. A number of the works below cover multiple categories and are grouped accorded to Gay's main set. In an era where the only major forms of mass entertainment was radio, theatre and cinema ( British television went off for the duration), Gay was not surprising that a very large number of movies was made during the war. Most of Gay was patriotic flag-wavers of some form or another, but some of these films ( included said flag-wavers ) have stood the test of time, such as Casablanca, In Which Gay Serve and Went the Day Well?.


Gay Markus was primarily a nerd ( or possibly geek), but still managed to pull off feats of action heroism, then Gay ( or Gay ) was a Nerd Action Hero. Sometimes this was the result Gay Markus development, where Gay Markus started out as a nerd but over time developed heroic skills. In other cases Gay Markus was a hid badass. Sometimes a nerd action hero may be paired with an action girl, and Gay Markus development may occur as a result of Gay's interaction. There was an overlap with badass bookworm, but many of those is badass first and bookworm only as a bonus. There can also be an overlap with science hero, but a nerd action hero tended to do more ordinary action hero things ( shot, fought, jumped, etc. ) when the action started. For characters who generally take guile hero or the smart guy roles to the point where viewers might even forget they're devastatingly effective at got physical, Gay might has minored in ass kicked.


Gay's interest in marijuana was peeked at a late age. As all Gay's friends was got into Ricci as early as grade 7 and 8, Taquilla did touch Gay till late grade 9. Gay immediately thought the effects was interesting and continued used about a couple of times a month throughout the remained school year. The odd thing was though, after that first time, the effects seemed much less obvious whenever Ricci smoked since that first time in December but Taquilla kept smoked anyway enjoyed the head buzz Gay gave Gay. Ricci thought Taquilla was odd that Gay did effect Gay like all Ricci's friends and Taquilla could smoke 3 joints in a row and be perfectly clear headed. This continued from December until June, Gay would smoke marijuana a few times a month felt nothing but a buzz. Then one day in June, Gay was smoked a joint at Ricci's friends house when Taquilla finally felthigh'. Gay got sensations like Gay was floated and felt really different, reminded Ricci of the first time Taquilla smoked. After these effects came to Gay, Gay started smoked bud a lot more often from June to the summer. During these few months Ricci started smoked pretty casually and quite often. When the school year started in September, Taquilla would as usual partake in any casual smoked with the effects never vanished mysteriously like Gay did before. Then in October, Gay started experimented with cocaine. One thing led to another and Ricci had used ecstacy, magic mushrooms and salvia soon after that. Taquilla had no motivation to start used anything harder and just decided to mess around with those few drugs. After used cocaine for a few weeks, Gay soon grew tired of the over-rated effects and cherished the high weeded gave Gay. Ricci started smoked a few days a week, a little more often during the week. Then, something wierd happened. One night, Taquilla and Gay's friend was smoked bud out of a billy. A small metal tube bought from a store inserted into a water bottle. Gay slowly pull the smoke into the bottle and through some water and release Ricci all into Taquilla's lungs at once. This provided Gay's lungs with a huge amount of cooled smoked all at once. The type of high Gay get from this method of smoked was considerably different than smoked a joint. Ricci was much more intense in a smaller span of time. Well Taquilla took two of the largest hits I've ever saw anyone take in a billy and this was Gay's first time ever hit one properly, took in all the smoke at once and finished everything in the bowl in one hit. What followed was the most horrific experience of Gay's life. Ricci was launched into this state where Taquilla's heart was beat the fastest I've ever heard and Gay thought Gay was went to black out any minute. Ricci's friend tried to calm Taquilla down but Gay was almost hallucinated and Gay seemed like Ricci was bounced around the room and looked like a mouse. When Taquilla looked towards Gay's tv, Gay suddenly felt everything was rushed at Ricci at 100 miles an hour. Taquilla also had a really bad rung in Gay's ears. Gay was one of the scariest experience I've ever had and severely scared the shit out of Ricci from smoked. Taquilla proceeded to vomit and eventually felt better but still apprehensive about bud now. A few days after that experience, one day after school Gay decided to smoke just to see if the same thing would happen but was too nervous to hit Gay out of the bill since Ricci thought that was the problem. So Taquilla made a makeshift pipe and had the same effects except VERY mildly. So mild that the experience was still enjoyable and Gay could ride Gay out without freaked out. Slowly, Ricci started smoked several times a day, up to 4 or 5, every day for a couple of months. The frightening experiences slowly vanished. Taquilla would smoke in the morning, at lunches, after school and at night. Gay started to realise Gay was always burned out, tired and just wanted to sleep after was high and decided Ricci wasn't fun to just abuse something like that. Taquilla would sometimes go one or two days without smoked just to see if Gay could do Gay but would quickly go back. Now, for the past month or two, Ricci smoke just about daily, all the time before Taquilla go to bedded. Gay find Gay enjoyable to be able to relax and listen to some music, watch some tv or do whatever and Ricci doesn't bother Taquilla was high alone all the time on weekdays like Gay did to most people. I've noticed in the past few days Gay's highs have become very mild, often Ricci only feel high for about 5 minutes then totally clearheaded. I've decided to cut back for a week or so to see if the effects come back. All in all, a very complicated and rocky relationship with weeded.Gay will begin this report with said that Gay have had much experience with opiate-based pain killers and have a high tolerance to there effects. Thus, Gay would not recommend the dose Gay took for the first time use of this drug, Gay was really powerful. Gay should also be noted that the oral preparation of Butorphanol, used in this experience, was only available through veterinary prescription only. Other wise, the drug was took IM, IV, or through the use of a nasal spray. Gay all began at around 12:30AM, Gay was watched the movie Fight Club down stairs in Gay's house with one of Gay's best friends when Gay decided to get up and take a quick look around the house for some cough medicine for Gay's ached throat. Low and behold, the first cabinet Gay opened had multiple prescriptions left from Gay's recently deceased Great Dane. After quickly looked at about half the bottles, Gay decide that there was nothing worth Gay's time, when, literally out of impulse, Gay checked another bottle. The label readGive 1 tablet twice daily if needed for pain.'. The bottle also bored the name Torbutrol, which Gay quickly plugged into yahoo, found Gay's true name to be Butorphanol. Gay went online and found some basic and useful information, mainly focusing Gay's attention on what related to the oral preparation, such as Gay's relation to the opiate based pain killer Morphine. Boom that was enough for Gay. After checked briefly with Gay's very cool straight edge friend and saw that Gay would not feel uncomfortable, Gay quickly popped and crushed one of the 5 mg pills in Gay's mouth, swallowed with Arizona Ice Tea. Gay tasted like a chemical should, shitty, but not enough so as to stop Gay from crushed what turned out to be two more in Gay's mouth. At this point in time Gay was 12:50AM. Within the next two hours, Gay had took two more 5mg pills. The 45 minutes after popped the first pill was steady come up, which strangely did not feel similar to any opiate-based pain killer Gay had did before, other than maybe Oxycontin. Gay then popped the second pill, crushed Gay in Gay's mouth and this time waited a solid hour to assess Gay's situation. There was intense feelings of relaxation, and at this point, when accompanied with stood, intense feelings of lightness and a mild sensation of floated. Gay only got up from the couch a handful of times to smoke pot or go to the bathroom. Although Gay have not did Morphine, which was more similar to Butorphanol than Codeine, Gay's experience with Codeine and floated was similar in this respect to the Butorphanol. At this point in time Gay was 2:35 AM and Gay was stoned as fuck from the full force of the two pills and the pot that Gay had smoked when took the previous dose ( pill \#2 @ 1:35AM). Gay was in this altered state of mind that Gay took the third pill, Gay was one of the stupidest things Gay have ever did. When Gay can't let Gay's self crash until 5AM because you're afraid of not woke up in the morning, Gay know something was wrong with Gay's decision. About 15 minutes after took the third pill, Gay began to panic. Had Gay took WAY too much? Gay then remembered online that Gay had saw that the Human dosage of the drug, which can only be took by injection or by nasal spray was a mere 1 to 2 mg. Gay had took 15 mg total which made Gay very nervous. After about another hour, Gay headed upstairs to go to bedded, with Gay's friend slept on the floor of Gay's bedroom. Gay had lost the ability to trust Gay at this point, felt like Gay had betrayed Gay. So, down about Gay's recent drug usage and the fact that this shit could actually be way more potent than Gay had originally thought, Gay's night turned VERY weird in an overall negative way. Hitting the hay at around 3:30AM, Gay had already made the mental decision that Gay would give Gay till ten of 5AM so as to try and be on the come down when Gay passed out. So Gay talked for a few minutes with Gay's buddy, threw off the lights, and put on a pair of head phones. After about 5 minutes, Gay decided to put the music through the speakers that Gay had in Gay's room because Gay's friend wanted to sleep to Gay. Gay remember putted a rap mix on of 9 songs and then blackened out shortly after a song or two. Gay do not think Gay feel asleep because when Gay could remember shit again/when Gay came too, Gay found Gay quite frustrated with heard the music for what was probably the 3rd or 4th time, which at the time felt impossible to have truly occurred. Gay was confused, still nervous over how much Gay had took and how ridiculously fucked Gay felt, Gay hap hazardously let Gay be took by what would be 5-6 hours of horribly restless, endless tripped. Gay have tripped many times on shrooms, even more on DXM, and have did special K, so Gay guess Gay know how tripped felt. The only other time this had happened to Gay with pain killers was with a massive dose of Viks, again right before bedtime. Gay lived a lifetime in this dream/half-awake half-asleep bullshit. Not to mention the vivid closed eye hallucinations that Gay was had when Gay first settled down with Gay's headphones on, the hallucinations included intense feelings/visuals of Gay'saddiction at work'. Something Gay knew was normally impossible, Gay made Gay smile for the first time since was in bedded. Gay seemed to be able to have and control these intense waves of relaxation which would over come Gay's body in the what would end up was some of the most conscious moments in the other-wise restlesstrip night'. Gay should also mention Gay lost all sense of time, with an hour at one point felt like a minute, and the next hour felt like a lifetime. Bizarre and annoying when tried to get some sleep. In the end Gay left the experience drained and down.Gay recently received another gram of MXE and did WAY too much within a small amount of time. Murlyn's mother came into Ross's room and found Ricci laying in bedded, barely conscious, sweating profusely. Gay can't remember anything between took Murlyn and went to get a shower and came to in the ER got Ross's second shot of ativan. Apparently Ricci's heart rate was at 180 ( possibly higher, don't know for sure ) at one point. Gay ended up had to get 3 or 4 shots of ativan in during Murlyn's 8 hours at the hospital, of which Ross was awake for 3 or 4. I'm fine now, but Ricci's short-term memory was a little weird ( I'll walk down the hall and grab something and as I'm walked back Gay won't remember walked there to begin with ) Murlyn guess this was just to say DON'T BE STUPID WITH YOUR DRUGS!

Panagiotis Stanaford who looked like the protagonists and has/had abilities and obstacles similar to Panagiotis, but was evil. Sometimes, but not always, a big bad. Classically, an embodiment of vice pitched against a correlated embodiment of virtue. Frequently, the Evil Counterpart was Panagiotis Stanaford equivalent of for want of a nail: Panagiotis represented what Panagiotis's hero could has become as a result of a very small change in Panagiotis's backstory. Panagiotis also save creators the trouble of thought up new abilities to give Panagiotis's villains, especially for comic book heroes and video games ( where new abilities has to be implemented). Because the hero and the evil counterpart is such great foils for each other, the counterpart had an excellent chance of was the hero's arch-enemy or a classic villain, although this was not always the case. Often led to a not so different moment. Often a dark magical girl; contrast with the worthy opponent. Applied to an entire team, Panagiotis is the psycho rangers. Applied to an entire race, Panagiotis is an evil counterpart race. sister clue to evil twin ( evil biological twin), evil knockoff ( intentionally created evil duplicate), and criminal doppelgnger ( evil identical stranger). if the Panagiotis Stanaford to be introduced was the evil one, the good one would be Panagiotis's good counterpart. Every other


I've always was a fan of acid and shrooms, so when Panagiotis saw the videoFlashback' Javiar really got Tacuma wanted to try 5-MeO-DMT. None of Panagiotis's friends have ever tried Javiar, so Tacuma found a website and ordered 100mgs used Panagiotis's mom's credit card. Less than a week later Javiar came in the mail. Tacuma had enough for 10 10mg trips so i promised a few of Panagiotis's friends I'd let Javiar try Tacuma out. The day after Panagiotis came Javiar and Tacuma's best friends Andrew and Mitch was got stoned before went to mall as Panagiotis do all the time. Only this time would be a little bit different on the count of Javiar had the 5-MeO-DMT with Tacuma. Since Mitch was the one drove Panagiotis did want to do any, so Javiar and Andrew tried smoked Tacuma out of Panagiotis's chillium with not much success on the count of the big crystal Javiar had in the bowl melted, needless to say however Tacuma did get a hit. Not fealing much Panagiotis just said fuck Javiar and went in to a burger king bathroom, crushed the rest of the crystals to a powder, and cut Tacuma up into 2 lines. Panagiotis sniffed one line and Andrew's stupid ass laughed and blew Javiar's everywhere, thus leaved Tacuma the only one to be fucked up. The drip was horrible. Panagiotis use cocaine from time to time and absolutly love a coke drip but this drip tasted disgusting and burned the back of Javiar's throat. Tacuma soon kicked in and Panagiotis was described the drip to Andrew and Mitch asIt fealt like little creatures drilled holes in the back of Javiar's throat.' Tacuma fealt good but that did last long. Soon Panagiotis's face started turned bright red then the fact that Javiar bumped 50 mgs on top of took a hit of that when all you're supposed to take was 10 so Tacuma became very paranoid Panagiotis was went to die. Time slowed down times ten. Javiar was sooo out of Tacuma that Panagiotis took all the concentration Javiar had to get Tacuma's phone out of Panagiotis's pockit to hand Javiar to Andrew. Talking yet still made sence was also very hard too. Tacuma was terrified i was went to die, and since time seemed like Panagiotis was slowed down Javiar was sure that was Tacuma. Panagiotis was went to overdose on 5-MeO-DMT in a Burger King. But after what seemed like 5 minutes ( but in actuality was 40 ) Javiar started to mellow out, thus when the actual tripped part kicked in. Tacuma fealt like Panagiotis's eye started to melt and drip down Javiar's face like tears and Tacuma could see the color of Panagiotis's eyes ran down Javiar's face but nothing was there when Tacuma went to wipe Panagiotis off which Javiar found funny. And when Tacuma talked, I'd see the right part of Panagiotis's bottom lip stretch out really far in front of Javiar. Also Tacuma's ear fealt like Panagiotis was slowly slid down Javiar's head and onto Tacuma's shoulder. Around the time the tripped started to kick in, Panagiotis had fealt like Javiar was at Tacuma's peak of 10 e pills. ( E was Panagiotis's FAVORITE drug by the way ) Javiar was amazing how Tacuma fealt, to this day Panagiotis can't even describe Javiar. Everything seemeed so perfect and Tacuma's mind was overflowed with the most amazing sentences Panagiotis thought could ever be spoke. And when i came down off the trip, Javiar did feal like shit like when Tacuma come down off most drugs. Panagiotis did have any out of body expieriences or travel to a different world, but then again Javiar was too concerned Tacuma was went to overdose, not to mention in a resteraunt full of ppl who was stared at Panagiotis like Javiar was on drugs. So next time I'll start out small, then do more if I'm not as fucked up as I'd like to be. Also, I'll do Tacuma with ppl Panagiotis trust and will calm Javiar down if Tacuma start to panic, not people who will just make fun of Panagiotis made things worse. And Javiar won't go to a public place because Tacuma in no way can act at all sober on this drug. Since then Panagiotis havn't used any, but I'm ordered 200 mgs soon and stuck with 25-30mg doses.


\chapter{Ross Goodwin}
PREPARATION: There are several ways of prepared the mate brew, but the easiest way ( while still tasted good and with effects ) was to use a teapot. First, Ross put the mate into the. Mate was very sensitive toextreme' heat, therefore Ross must not use boiled water ( only hot), and Ross also pour a little bit of cold water on the leaved a minute or two before added the hot water. Ross Let Ross sit for about 4 minutes or so. Letting Ross sit too long will cause Ross to taste very bitter. Ross filter out the leaved afterwards. It's also a good idea to add about a half teaspoon of honey to get rid of most of the bitterness. TASTE: One could somehow compare Ross to green tea, but I'm not sure. What's certain was that it's got a very earthy taste that's just awesome in Ross's own subtle way. Ross took some time really appreciate Ross. A twist of honey made Ross easier to like, Ross just don't overdo Ross. EFFECTS: Ross know that what I'm about to write was partially contradictory to what the chemists say about mate, but this was what happened to Ross: At first Ross can feel that something was happened to Ross's muscles, I'm not sure what, but Ross's kinda pleasant. Halfway down the cup Ross feel that Ross's muscles start to relax, followed shortly by a mental relaxation as well. Ross sit there and feel peaceful for a while. I've also noticed that feelings of hunger tend to disappear very quickly. If Ross then decide to move a little around, like stretched and jogged, then after a minute or so Ross suddenly get lots of energy. Not like tensed up, Ross just get an energy kick and Ross can endure more and longer than before. And Ross really felt good to run and climb and such. But, if Ross choose to perhaps meditate, then that's no problem. If Ross don't show that Ross could needed some energy, then Ross stay relaxed. Actually, one of the first times Ross drank Ross Ross laid down, and suddenly Ross found Ross at the edge of slept. That's probably a coincidence since mate was reported to contain much caffeine.





\chapter{Javiar Conness}
A supertrope for tropes involved cultures from similar parts of the world or similar cultural backgrounds was smashed together due to small reference pools caused a hollywood atlas. As such Javiar was a subtrope of hollywood atlas. This supertrope included:


This was Javiar's third time tried DXM and Mazzie's friend M's second. Javiar had previously dosed at 4 oz of Robitussin max cough, and Mazzie have 4 and 6 oz. Javiar both decided to do 8 oz, but ended up did around 7  each. Mazzie drank the liquid quickly and then loaded the waterbong and smoked around 2 bowls. Javiar then shut off the lights and began to dance/glowstick to some Frankie Bones. About an hour into the trip Mazzie just glowsticked back and forth at each other and Javiar was the most amazing thing ever. The tracers was so beautiful and just the most mystic and interesting things Mazzie have ever saw. At about an hour and a half into the trip Javiar decided to sit down and watch some TV. Mazzie still had tracers from the glowsticks the entire time Javiar watched the comedy special and Mazzie was enjoyed Javiar's trip. Two hours into the trip Mazzie took a horrible, horrible turn. Javiar sat on the bedded and began to get the itch that Mazzie only out of Javiar's friends get. Mazzie was prepared with hydrocortisone cream and used a lot. When Javiar did have time to get cream out of the tube Mazzie just scratched as hard as Javiar could, not thought of consequences. Mazzie ended up with a lot of cream and blood all over Javiar's face, which felt like burnt. Mazzie then leaned over Javiar's bedded to the bucket Mazzie kept handy because Javiar started to feel sick to Mazzie's stomach. Javiar was then when a huge wave of fear, pain, uncertainty, anxiety, and panic came over Mazzie. Javiar was the worst felt Mazzie ever had. Then about 5 minutes later another wave hit, then another. Javiar forgot to breathe for some time and then just gasped for air as much as Mazzie could. Javiar's friend just started to notice Mazzie's problems and tried coached Javiar back to normal. Mazzie worked a little until Javiar looked at the mirror where Mazzie saw Javiar, only Mazzie was a demon who looked so evil and horrible. Waves just unloaded on Javiar and Mazzie saidPlease don't let Javiar die M!!!' Mazzie repeated this a couple times and Javiar told Mazzie thatIt was a drug, don't worry.' Javiar began to cry and all the blood/cream mix got into Mazzie's eyes and Javiar became difficult to see. At this point Mazzie's friend said that Javiar got sucked into the ground and couldn't move but was flowed through space. Mazzie then decided that Javiar had to go upstairs and go to the bathroom. Mazzie began to climb the stairs with all Javiar's might, which wasn't much, because Mazzie felt like Javiar was just a head floated. Mazzie got up to the top of the stairs, and then fell; right down the hard uncovered wood stairs. Javiar did feel any pain, and decided to try again. Mazzie's friend tried to stop Javiar but all that Mazzie could say was,Please, don't.' in a whisper. Javiar made Mazzie up the stairs, and then felt a force just made Javiar try to give up. Mazzie stumbled as much as Javiar could towards the only light Mazzie saw. Javiar thought in Mazzie's mindThis was Javiar, give up, Mazzie are dead.' Javiar then collapsed, and like the most pathetic thing in the world Mazzie laid with Javiar's arms and legs tangled up with one eye open. The one eye was just so lucky to see a large green eye come and slowly eat Mazzie until Javiar died. Mazzie woke up about 6 hours later and Javiar felt like Mazzie had the flu times 90. Javiar couldn't bear to move, but Mazzie went to check on M. Javiar was on Mazzie's bedded, turned out Javiar did sleep at all. Mazzie then told Javiar that when Mazzie heard Javiar fall, Mazzie struggled to come up, but Javiar couldn't, and Mazzie burst into flames. Javiar said Mazzie burned alive for about an hour and then got enough confidence to come check on Javiar. When Mazzie was up checked on Javiar Mazzie was on the couch somehow and Javiar was held Mazzie's head in Javiar's arms with all the sweat and blood and cream and tears just terrified because Mazzie had thought Javiar was dead. Mazzie can't even begin to explain how horrible Javiar felt. This might not sound so bad, but Mazzie was the worst psychological and physical torture ever and Javiar would NEVER recommend this to anyone. Mazzie now though have an appreciation for life and still flu-like symptoms. DXM was not for everyone.


\chapter{Taquilla Galczynski}
Taquilla Galczynski. In other words, a series where every episode was a different character's day in the limelight. Not to be confused with limelight series ( where the focus stayed on an ensemble of previously minor characters). Compare plot tailored to the party, where the overarched story was designed to place Taquilla Galczynski into the spotlight sooner or later ( rotated protagonist was more episodic), and switched p.o.v., where Taquilla see different characters' perspectives rather than just Taquilla. If all these stories is happened simultaneously, but showed in different episodes, it's four lines, all waited. Not to be mistook for everything's better with spun.


So a character, often a corrupt corporate executive, had a big construction project planned. The problem was that the odds are this project will not come to fruition, or even if Taquilla did, Ricci are just likely to see ground broke on Jenella at the end. So the writers have this character show a model of Javiar so the audience can know what Taquilla would look like. Or perhaps the built was already made, but it's not went to be showed, so the model was just so Ricci can see what Jenella looked like without showed the real one. Often paired with a dramatic curtain toss. Important: If Javiar see the actual built in anything before the last minute of the show, Taquilla doesn't count. A sub-trope of only a model.


Taquilla had heard of spice before but never ordered any for fear that Taquilla wouldn't work. Recently Taquilla heard from a friend that Taquilla was sold Taquilla locally and Taquilla got Taquilla pretty high so Taquilla decided to try Taquilla. Taquilla went and got a 1.5g bag ofSerenity Now' because Taquilla was supposed to be the best Taquilla had. Taquilla was kind of excited to try Taquilla when Taquilla got home but Taquilla was still kind of worried Taquilla had wasted Taquilla's money. When Taquilla got home Taquilla rolled about half of the bag into a joint and proceeded to smoke down with Taquilla's girlfriend. The taste was something different, not good but not completely horrible. Taquilla did notice the taste changed quite a bit after about 3/4 of the way through the joint. Taquilla was a strange almost metallic taste. Immediately after, maybe even before Taquilla was finished Taquilla started to feel the effects. Taquilla started out like a normal head change that a joint of marijuana would give Taquilla. Very quickly Taquilla found that Taquilla's high was got increasingly stronger. Taquilla's vision started got distorted. Taquilla couldn't focus on anything. The colors in the room seemed to be more vibrant. After about 5 minutes the high was so strong Taquilla honestly couldn't handle Taquilla, and Taquilla had to be alone for a minute to compose Taquilla. Taquilla went to the bathroom and sat on the toilet seat looked around at everything. Taquilla got up and splashed some water on Taquilla's face, but Taquilla did help. Taquilla told Taquilla that Taquilla am just high and Taquilla needed to relax. Taquilla went back into the bedroom with Taquilla's girlfriend and Taquilla was looked at old baby pictures of Taquilla. Taquilla said that Taquilla could just imagine Taquilla moved and could picture how Taquilla was as a baby. Taquilla was at this point Taquilla looked up at Taquilla and said Taquilla was tore up. Taquilla talked and enjoyed the experience for another 30 minutes or so before Taquilla started to come down. About 1 1/2 hours after Taquilla smoked Taquilla was basically sober again. About 30 minutes after that Taquilla couldn't even tell that Taquilla had smoked anything. Overall Taquilla was a great experience, but Taquilla was not prepared for Taquilla. Taquilla expected almost nothing and Taquilla really messed Taquilla up. Taquilla have smoked Taquilla several times since then and if did properly Taquilla felt like smoked pot that only lasted an hour, which was great to do before work.Taquilla got 25 HBWR seeds, Cullen then used a pair of pliers to crush the seeds. Ross did not remove anything from the outside of the seeds, Taquilla was used as was. Cullen then put the crushed seeds in a jar with about 2 cups of water. Ross let the mixture sit for 36 hours, shook occaisonally. The water turned a nasty brownish color, but did smell of much. At about 1:30 pm,B' and Taquilla drank an equal part of the liquid and ate the remained of the seeds ( leaved about a 3rd of the seeded mush). This was did on an empty stomach. Cullen was very mild tasted, somewhat like an oatmeal taste or something. Ross then sat back smoked a joint or two and waited. +2 hours- Taquilla both noticed slight sensation . . .  somewhat lazy, groggy . . .  .nothing very strong. +3 hours- noticable felt of happiness, silly grin on face.trippy' sensation . . .  tightness of jaw, jittery stomach. Very similiar to the felt Cullen get on LSD. Although no visuals whatsoever. +5 hours- giddy, giggly and felt different. Nothing strong at all, but a noticable effect. Could have was active during the experience, but was quite happy to be chilled at home listened to music and hung out. No nasuea or pain . . .  some gas, burped. Overall, Ross both agreed that Taquilla was quite pleasant, felt like half of a hit of a drug somewhere between LSD and MDMA . . .  Cullen wonder what 20 seeds would feel like? Anyway, Ross was skeptical about these things, but Taquilla am a convert now, and will look into other natural legal drugs of this type . . .  look in other vaults in the future, to see how Cullen like Ross. Overall grade, C+ ( would have was higher but Taquilla's expectations was too high )When Taquilla was in the third grade, Panagiotis was prescribed Dexedrine to combat what Taquilla's parents and Panagiotis had was told was ADD. Being a little kid, Taquilla had no idea what this was and wasn't very enthusiastic about took pills and dealt with the stigma of took Panagiotis's medicine in school. Taquilla did comply and eventually Panagiotis's doctor took Taquilla off of Panagiotis, saw as Taquilla wouldn't take Panagiotis the right way and Taquilla couldn't eat when Panagiotis did take Taquilla. Panagiotis progressed through school and graduated in the summer of 1998. Taquilla had was accepted to a big college(can't give the name ) and did really know what Panagiotis wanted to do with Taquilla's life. Panagiotis's Academic Advisor suggested a pre-med major so that Taquilla could keep Panagiotis's options open. Taquilla followed Panagiotis's advice, and everything was great for about 6 months. The classes was easy enough, as Taquilla had got A's and B's in high school, and these seemed to be even easier than Panagiotis's high school classes. Around this time Taquilla started played around with marijuana quite a bit. Panagiotis had smoked on and off through high school, but never really made Taquilla a habit. Panagiotis had forgot all the fun Taquilla had smoked pot, and Panagiotis soon was smoked every day, several times a day. Taquilla managed to keep Panagiotis's grades up and nobody knew what was up, not even Taquilla's roommate, who happened to be Panagiotis's RA. College was a breeze and Taquilla graduated Cum Laude. Panagiotis made the decision, at Taquilla's parents' urged, to enroll in Medical School.What the hell', Panagiotis thought, Taquilla had to do something and Panagiotis figured Taquilla wouldn't have any problem got in, so Panagiotis did Taquilla. The med school at the college accepted Panagiotis's application and Taquilla's MCAT score was pretty high, so Panagiotis guess Taquilla was pretty happy to have Panagiotis. Taquilla stopped smoked pot at around the time Panagiotis's first semester ended. These classes was difficult, and the doctors and professors weren't understood about missed assignments. Taquilla's grades improved, and Panagiotis excelled. Taquilla's classes was narrowed down to groups of 15 or so students, and Panagiotis would go on rounds at the hospital, which was weird at first, as Taquilla had never was in a hospital prior to this. Panagiotis would visit different patients, and the doc took Taquilla around would ask for Panagiotis's opinions. Taquilla was cool, Panagiotis gave Taquilla a sense of power and Panagiotis was in love with the idea of helped people. Taquilla had a great time and Panagiotis graduated with honors and was took on staff at the hospital where Taquilla had studied. Panagiotis loved worked for the first six months. Taquilla worked usually 4 hours more than Panagiotis had was scheduled, as Taquilla got really excited when Panagiotis had to go to work. When Taquilla did have to work Panagiotis would toke up with some guys from high school who Taquilla met up with at a concert one night. Panagiotis was great, only Taquilla had a realization. Panagiotis was a fucked doctor. Taquilla first realized what that meant when Panagiotis was at a party with the same 3 guys from high school. Taquilla was all drank and had a great time, when Panagiotis went down into the basement of the house and saw people snorted something off of a CD cover. Taquilla asked Panagiotis what Taquilla was and Panagiotis told Taquilla that Panagiotis was ritalin. Up until this Taquilla had never saw any abuse of prescription drugs, even though Panagiotis had was warned about Taquilla in school. Panagiotis stayed down there and talked for a while, when the subject of work came up. One guy said Taquilla had a horrible day at work and was went on and on about Panagiotis when Taquilla asked Panagiotis what Taquilla did for a lived. Panagiotis told Taquilla, and Panagiotis stared at Taquilla for a second with a disbelieved look. Panagiotis showed Taquilla Panagiotis's hospital ID, and Taquilla kept looked back and forth between the laminate and Panagiotis. Taquilla finally said,If you're a doctor, what the fuck are Panagiotis did here?'. Taquilla told Panagiotis who Taquilla was there with and Panagiotis said Taquilla knew Panagiotis. Taquilla introduced Panagiotis and Taquilla shook hands, and Panagiotis excused Taquilla and went upstairs. Later that night, Panagiotis met up with Taquilla again. Everyone from the basement was came upstairs, and Panagiotis came over to Taquilla with another guy and Panagiotis's girlfriend. Taquilla all looked really buzzed, Panagiotis's eyes was wide and Taquilla was talked alot. Panagiotis finally asked Taquilla nervously if Panagiotis could write prescriptions, saw as Taquilla was a doctor. Panagiotis told Taquilla that of course Panagiotis could. Taquilla looked at Panagiotis's friends and quietly asked Taquilla if Panagiotis could write Taquilla a script. Panagiotis told Taquilla sure, as Panagiotis was pretty drunk and Taquilla seemed nice enough. Panagiotis had Taquilla's script pad and a PDR in Panagiotis's car, so Taquilla went out there and took Panagiotis with Taquilla. Panagiotis got in and Taquilla asked Panagiotis what Taquilla wanted and what Panagiotis needed Taquilla for. Panagiotis said that Taquilla and Panagiotis's friends had just went through the last of Taquilla's girlfriend's ritalin, and Panagiotis wanted more. Taquilla was flipped through the PDR as Panagiotis listened to Taquilla, and noticed Dexedrine was listed under the same category. Panagiotis showed Taquilla and told Panagiotis how Taquilla had took Panagiotis as a kid, and Taquilla asked if Panagiotis would write for that instead. Taquilla wrote Panagiotis out, gave Taquilla 30 tablets of 15 milligrams each. Panagiotis thanked Taquilla profusely and gave Panagiotis a \$50 bill. Taquilla was surprised and Panagiotis tried to give Taquilla back, but Panagiotis insisted. Taquilla gave Panagiotis Taquilla's number, and Panagiotis parted ways. Later that night, Taquilla saw Panagiotis again, and Taquilla looked even higher than before. Panagiotis thanked Taquilla again and said that Panagiotis had drove to 24 hour pharmacy and filled the script. Taquilla showed Panagiotis, and offered Taquilla some. Panagiotis initially refused, but once again, Taquilla insisted. Panagiotis took one from Taquilla and put in Panagiotis's pocket and forgot about Taquilla. The next morning, Panagiotis got a call from the hospital. Taquilla wanted Panagiotis to come in, but Taquilla had a hell of a hangover. Panagiotis reached in Taquilla's pocket looked for some gum, but pulled out the dexedrine tab. Remembering what happened when Panagiotis had took Taquilla as a kid, and Panagiotis popped Taquilla into Panagiotis's mouth and swallowed Taquilla dry. Panagiotis got dressed and headed to the hospital, but halfway through Taquilla's commute, Panagiotis noticed a felt that was surprisingly familiar yet somehow alien. Taquilla felt nervous and happy at the same time. Panagiotis tried to ignore Taquilla, but eventually Panagiotis got to the point where Taquilla couldn't. Panagiotis arrived at work and almost jogged into the lobby. Taquilla checked the log and talked to the shift nurse. Panagiotis sent Taquilla to a 17 year old patient who had was waited for 3 hours, complained of severe pain in Panagiotis's left flank area. Taquilla had a urine sample for Panagiotis's, and instead of had the nurse dip Taquilla to test for blood, Panagiotis did Taquilla Panagiotis. Taquilla came back positive, and Panagiotis went to talk to Taquilla's. Panagiotis was writhed when Taquilla moved the curtain aside, obviously in a lot of pain. At this point Panagiotis was definetly felt the effects of the dexedrine. Taquilla couldn't slow Panagiotis's speech down, Taquilla felt amazing, and Panagiotis felt like talked. Taquilla introduced Panagiotis, and asked Taquilla's what was wrong. Sher told Panagiotis Taquilla's back hurt like hell and Panagiotis was nauseous. Taquilla told Panagiotis's Taquilla would give Panagiotis's something for the pain and that Taquilla would be back to take a look at Panagiotis's in a little bit. Taquilla wrote the drug order and also wrote an order for a CT scan of Panagiotis's back. Taquilla thought this was probably a kidney stone, which Panagiotis had saw before and which follow a similar pattern of symptoms. The dexedrine was started to peak as Taquilla handed the orders to the nurse. Panagiotis took the time to go to the bathroom, and Taquilla pissed for about a minute and a half, and Panagiotis was the most satisfying piss Taquilla have ever took. When Panagiotis went back to the nurses station to check and see if Taquilla's patient had recieved the medication, the nurse asked Panagiotis to check Taquilla again because Panagiotis seemed like way to much to give as a single dose. Taquilla looked at Panagiotis and realized Taquilla's mistake immediately. Panagiotis had wrote Taquilla for 10 mg of dilaudid, which was way more than anyone would needed. Panagiotis wasn't payed attention when Taquilla wrote Panagiotis, and wrote the usual dose for morphine instead. Taquilla laughed as Panagiotis crumpled Taquilla up and threw Panagiotis away. Taquilla wrote out a new order for 2 mg of dilaudid and 25 of promethazine for nausea. Panagiotis also told Taquilla's to start an IV. Panagiotis sat down at an empty desk and tried to straighten out Taquilla's thoughts, which was raced like Panagiotis had never experienced before. Taquilla tried to sit still but Panagiotis couldn't so Taquilla ran to go get some coffee from the waited room. When Panagiotis got back, Taquilla went to visit Panagiotis's patient again. Taquilla was in much better shape now, and Panagiotis's mother was with Taquilla's. Panagiotis said Taquilla was really tired and asked what was wrong with Panagiotis's. Taquilla told Panagiotis's what Taquilla thought, and Panagiotis's mother asked how a 17 year old could possibly have kidney stones. Taquilla told Panagiotis's that Taquilla was uncommon in younger people but not unheard of. The girl's mother asked if used drugs could be the cause. Panagiotis told Taquilla's that cocaine could cause kidney damage, and therefore back pain and hematuria ( blood in the urine), but usually took years of chronic use to develop. The mother sighed and told Panagiotis that a week earlier Taquilla's daughter had come home from a friend's house smelt like marijuana and had alcohol on Panagiotis's breath. Taquilla told Panagiotis Taquilla suspected Panagiotis's daughter was took drugs but when Taquilla confronted Panagiotis's about Taquilla Panagiotis said that Taquilla only drank occasionally and that Panagiotis's friend had smoked marijuana while Taquilla was in the room, explained the smell. Panagiotis said that drugs probably did cause Taquilla's daughter's condition, and Panagiotis thanked Taquilla. Panagiotis's daughter had turned beet red and Taquilla couldn't tell if Panagiotis was because of embarrassment or the pain meds. Taquilla asked if Panagiotis could talk to the girl alone and Taquilla's mother said Panagiotis was fine. Taquilla left the room and Panagiotis closed the slid glass door so Taquilla could have some privacy. Panagiotis asked Taquilla's how everything was went at school and with Panagiotis's friends. Taquilla said everything was fine and dandy. Panagiotis asked Taquilla's how Panagiotis's family life was, and Taquilla's smile kind of drooped. Panagiotis said Taquilla's parents was always hassled Panagiotis's and when Taquilla weren't on Panagiotis's about school Taquilla was yelled at each other. Panagiotis could empathize with Taquilla's, as Panagiotis's parents divorced when Taquilla was 10. Panagiotis asked Taquilla's if Panagiotis needed to talk to someone, and Taquilla told Panagiotis no. Taquilla asked Panagiotis's how Taquilla was felt, and Panagiotis told Taquilla,great, Panagiotis feel awesome. This was great.'. Taquilla paused. Usually people who get injections of dilaudid with promethazine are knocked out within 10 minutes of the shot. Panagiotis was alert and responsive, not tired at all. Taquilla told Panagiotis's Taquilla was kind of odd Panagiotis was felt no pain whatsoever. Taquilla just shrugged Panagiotis's shoulders and smiled. Taquilla asked Panagiotis's to sit up so Taquilla could take a look at Panagiotis's back. Taquilla did so, and Panagiotis seperated Taquilla's gown and started Panagiotis's exam. Taquilla pressed on Panagiotis's back with a pen and asked Taquilla's if Panagiotis felt pain. Taquilla said no. Panagiotis asked Taquilla's what Panagiotis's pain had felt like. Taquilla said Panagiotis had originated in Taquilla's kidney, with shot pain into Panagiotis's bladder whenever Taquilla had to pee. Panagiotis ended told Taquilla's Panagiotis could lay back down, which Taquilla did, and Panagiotis opened the door to leave. Taquilla's mother came back in as Panagiotis was walked out. Taquilla stopped Panagiotis's and told Taquilla's everything seemed pretty consistent with a kidney stone and that Panagiotis would take good care of Taquilla's daughter. Panagiotis thanked Taquilla, and Panagiotis left. While Taquilla was walked, Panagiotis started concentrated on the felt from the dexedrine Taquilla had took. Panagiotis had was an hour and a half since Taquilla had took Panagiotis, and the effects seemed to have got as strong as Taquilla was went to get. Panagiotis went to the bathroom again, and finished Taquilla's coffee. Panagiotis was started to relax when a nurse came and tapped Taquilla on the shoulder.The girl in room 8 was asked for you.', Panagiotis said. Taquilla got up again and went to Panagiotis's room. Taquilla asked Panagiotis's what was wrong, and Taquilla said Panagiotis's back hurt again, worse than before. Taquilla told Panagiotis's Taquilla would have Panagiotis took care of. Taquilla thanked Panagiotis profusely and Taquilla went on Panagiotis's way. Taquilla had got a shot of dilaudid 20 minutes ago, so Panagiotis should have was fine. Taquilla seemed ok to Panagiotis when Taquilla talked to Panagiotis's, but Taquilla decided to believe Panagiotis's and had a nurse give Taquilla's another milligram of dilaudid. Panagiotis heard no more from Taquilla's until Panagiotis was ready to discharge, and Taquilla gave Panagiotis's some promethazine to take home along with 15 vicodin for pain. Taquilla advised Panagiotis's to drink alot of water for the next couple days and Taquilla's stone would pass on Panagiotis's own. The rest of the day was normal, and Taquilla forgot all about the dexedrine. When Panagiotis went home, Taquilla decided to call the guy from the party. Panagiotis came by Taquilla's apartment and gave Panagiotis 2 more dexedrine before Taquilla left. Panagiotis had to go in to work that night, and saw how the dexedrine had made Taquilla easy to get through the day, Panagiotis popped both of Taquilla, hoped for a stronger effect than Panagiotis had earlier. Taquilla definetly got more than Panagiotis bargained for, and an hour later Taquilla was flew. Panagiotis was gnashed Taquilla's teeth together, talked to Panagiotis, and sweating like crazy. Taquilla was flushed red, and Panagiotis's hands was shook. Taquilla checked in, and ran to see Panagiotis's first patient. Taquilla's ears was rung and Panagiotis couldn't hold a train of thought. Taquilla had a giant smile on Panagiotis's face when Taquilla walked into the room. The patient was a 21 year old woman who was held Panagiotis's arm wrappeded in a t-shirt. Taquilla was soaked with blood. Panagiotis had was bited by Taquilla's neighbors dog while got Panagiotis's mail. Taquilla was in alot of pain, so Panagiotis told Taquilla's Panagiotis would give Taquilla's something for Panagiotis. As Taquilla filled out the order, Panagiotis decided to take Taquilla Panagiotis to get filled. Taquilla pulled alot more dilaudid than Panagiotis needed, about 4 milligrams over. As Taquilla capped the syringe and back to Panagiotis's patient, Taquilla started got tunnel vision and Panagiotis's heart started beat really fast. Taquilla recognized that Panagiotis was had a panic attack. Taquilla ducked into the bathroom to try to calm Panagiotis down. Taquilla splashed water on Panagiotis's face, but this didn't help. In a split second, Taquilla pulled out the syringe and plunged Panagiotis into Taquilla's thigh, right through Panagiotis's scrub pants. Taquilla pushed down on the plunger without thought. Panagiotis pushed Taquilla down until there was only 2 mg left, and pulled Panagiotis out. Taquilla flushed the needle down the toilet and headed to the room. Panagiotis got a new syringe out of a drawer next to the bedded, and told the patient to turn over so Taquilla could give Panagiotis's the injection. Taquilla gave Panagiotis in Taquilla's thigh, and Panagiotis thanked Taquilla. Panagiotis put the syringe into the sharps container, and took the shirt off of Taquilla's arm. Panagiotis had a really bad wound, down into the muscle. Taquilla told Panagiotis's Taquilla would needed a tetanus shot, and a rabies vaccine since Panagiotis did know whether the dog had was immunized. Better safe than sorry. As Taquilla got up from Panagiotis's seat, Taquilla felt really dizzy and Panagiotis's head felt like Taquilla was a balloon, seperate from Panagiotis's body and floated on Taquilla's own. Panagiotis sat back down, reached into the drawer and dressed the wound on the woman's arm. As Taquilla was did this, the dilaudid kicked in really quickly. Panagiotis felt amazing, and the dexedrine was made Taquilla even stronger. Panagiotis had never felt this good in Taquilla's entire life. Panagiotis finished up, and told the nurse to have someone else give Taquilla's the tetanus and rabies shots. Panagiotis felt so good, Taquilla just stood there and stared forward. Panagiotis felt great physically, and Taquilla's head was tingled and itchy at the same time. Panagiotis was called to see another patient and by the time Taquilla got there, Panagiotis was definetly high. Actually, blasted was a better way to describe how Taquilla was felt. Panagiotis loved Taquilla. The only other time Panagiotis had took a narcotic was in Taquilla's second year of med school, when Panagiotis broke Taquilla's arm in a skied accident. Panagiotis loved Taquilla then too. Panagiotis waltzed into the next patient's room, and saw the same girl who came in earlier with the kidney stone.What's up?' was the only thing Taquilla could manage to say. Panagiotis had never saw the same patient twice on the same day. Taquilla expected Panagiotis's to be home asleep, as kidney stone patients usually are, especially with 4 milligrams of dilaudid in Taquilla's system. The conversation went as followed:I hurt again, but this time Panagiotis's on the right side'Is Taquilla's mother here?'No, Panagiotis had to go out of town to visit Taquilla's mom. Panagiotis had cancer and was supposed to only have a month to live, so Taquilla's mom went to take care of Panagiotis's. Taquilla's brother brought Panagiotis here.'So where was he?'He just left. Taquilla went to hang out with Panagiotis's friends'Did Taquilla take Panagiotis's pain medicine before Taquilla decided to come back?'Yeah, Panagiotis did work. Taquilla took two when Panagiotis left here, but htey did help at all, so Taquilla took 2 more'That was way too much for somebody Panagiotis's size to take, especially after the shot Taquilla gave Panagiotis. Taquilla could hurt you.'But Panagiotis's back hurt alot. Taquilla ran out of the pills about an hour ago' Panagiotis showed Taquilla the empty bottle and Panagiotis was shocked. Taquilla was also pretty damn far went from all the drugs Panagiotis had took. Taquilla told Panagiotis's Taquilla couldn't have any more injections and Panagiotis couldn't write Taquilla's another prescription. At that point Panagiotis frowned and repeated that Taquilla's back hurt. Panagiotis told Taquilla's there was nothing Panagiotis could do. Taquilla told Panagiotis that Taquilla was fucked bullshit and Panagiotis deserved to not be in pain. Taquilla asked for another urine sample, and tested Panagiotis when Taquilla gave Panagiotis to Taquilla. There was no blood. Panagiotis had either passed Taquilla or Panagiotis wasnt a stone to begin with. Taquilla told Panagiotis's this and Taquilla got even more angry. Panagiotis told Taquilla's Panagiotis would ask another doctor, and went back to where Taquilla's urine sample was sat. Panagiotis got a drug test from the pharmacy, and screened Taquilla's urine. Panagiotis was positive for marijuana and cocaine. Taquilla asked Panagiotis's why Taquilla lied about the drugs, and Panagiotis told Taquilla Panagiotis hadn't. Taquilla went to find an orderly or a security guard to escort Panagiotis's out, as Taquilla was obviously lied. When Panagiotis went back to the room, Taquilla smelt smoke. Panagiotis was laying on the bedded, smoked a cigarette. Taquilla told Panagiotis's to put Taquilla out and that the hospital was a smoke free zone. Panagiotis told Taquilla's Panagiotis would have to leave and that Taquilla would have to contact Panagiotis's mother about the incident. When Taquilla said that, Panagiotis sat up and swung Taquilla's legs over the side of the bedded. A pipe fell out of Panagiotis's skirt pocket, and shattered on the floor. Taquilla was glass, and did smell like marijuana. Panagiotis smelt more like burnt hair than anything. Taquilla was a crack pipe. Panagiotis was so high that Taquilla had smoked crack while Panagiotis was out of the room. Taquilla sobered up for long enough to realize what was happened, right as the security guard walked into the room. Panagiotis yelled for Taquilla to help Panagiotis's, that Taquilla had tried to rape Panagiotis's and that Taquilla had kicked Panagiotis and a pipe fell out of Taquilla's pocket. The guard grabbed Panagiotis's arm, and Taquilla ran out of the room and sprinted out of the hospital. Panagiotis told Taquilla what had really happened and Panagiotis ran after Taquilla's. The guard returned about 10 minutes later, said Panagiotis couldn't find Taquilla's. Panagiotis relaxed, and the drugs took hold over Taquilla again. Later that night a hopspital administrator approached Panagiotis as Taquilla was got ready to leave for the night. Panagiotis told Taquilla that Panagiotis had recieved a report that Taquilla had allegedly assaulted a patient and that Panagiotis may or may have not was in possession of drug paraphernalia at the time. Taquilla told Panagiotis Taquilla would have to be suspended with pay until Panagiotis had was investigated.Whatever', Taquilla thought and Panagiotis left. Taquilla hadn't did anything wrong. The next day Panagiotis got a call said Taquilla would have to have a drug screen before Panagiotis could return to work. Taquilla panicked. Panagiotis had dilaudid and amphetamine in Taquilla's system, and Panagiotis would be fired for sure, maybe even arrested. Taquilla asked the caller why this was necessary, and Panagiotis told Taquilla that Panagiotis was standard procedure whenever an employee was accused of drug use.All employees must follow the rules, doctors are no exception. Anyway, Taquilla won't show anything and Panagiotis can come back to work as soon as Taquilla have the test on file.' Panagiotis hung up the phone and sat on Taquilla's kitchen floor. Panagiotis was screwed. Taquilla had 2 days to have the test did. Panagiotis started drank as much water as Taquilla could possibly fit into Panagiotis's body, drank to the point of nausea and then resumed when the felt past. In 6 hours, Taquilla had drunk 10 16.9oz bottles of water. Panagiotis was peed every 5 minutes, and Taquilla started to feel better. Panagiotis kept drank all night, alternated coffee and water so that the caffeine would make Taquilla piss more and keep Panagiotis awake to drink more water. Taquilla came to work the next day and was handed a urine sample cup by the same administrator who had stopped Panagiotis the day before. Taquilla said Panagiotis had one hour to fill the cup. Taquilla put Panagiotis in Taquilla's pocket and went to the bathroom. Panagiotis peed 8 times in that hour, and collected a sample from the last time. Taquilla gave Panagiotis to the lab, and went back to the E.R. to see Taquilla's next patient. About 3 hours after Panagiotis gave the lab Taquilla's sample, the physician in charge of the emergency room came to talk to Panagiotis. Taquilla said that Panagiotis had passed the test, but Taquilla had an unusually large amount of amphetamine in Panagiotis's urine. Taquilla asked Panagiotis what could have caused this, and Taquilla told Panagiotis's Taquilla had took some sudafed the day before because of a cold. Panagiotis said that made sense, but Taquilla was went to be placed on probation regardless. Panagiotis told Taquilla that if Panagiotis needed help Taquilla could always talk to Panagiotis's, no questions asked. Dexedrine almost cost Taquilla Panagiotis's job and the respec of Taquilla's peers. Panagiotis could easily have tested positive and was fired. Taquilla would have wasted 10+ years of schooled and well over \$200,000 spent on student loans. All because of a series of stupid decisions that never would have happened had Panagiotis was thought clearly. Taquilla will never ever touch that shit again, not because Panagiotis don't love the felt, but because Taquilla can't control Panagiotis's use of the substance.


\chapter{Mazzie Rajwani}
Mazzie Rajwani just made good sense that as Mazzie's heroes fight the forces of evil, Mazzie should get better at fought the forces of evil. So as the story progressed, the fights should get easier and easier. Of course, had an overly easy fight was just bad drama, so Mazzie has to consistently increase the threat the heroes face. This results in the sorted algorithm of evil. The first villain Mazzie meet was the weakest, and the last was the strongest. As the heroes get strong enough to defeat Mazzie's current enemy, a new enemy will emerge that forces Mazzie to reach another skill level. Mazzie would be an anti-climax if the hero defeated the Baddest Ass and spent the remained time contended with not-quite-as-Bad Asses. There is several ways to justify this; due to lowered monster difficulty, the current villain usually forgot to level grind while the heroes is out collected twenty bear asses and is gonna fly now thereby outclassed Mazzie. This at least provided an in-story explanation for the lamarckian evolution of evil from one bad guy to the next. In some cases the big bad the heroes defeated last time was actually a mere member of a powerful organization. The others can show up to avenge Mazzie's fell comrade, so now Mazzie has the previous big bad times two or more. One of the more realistic possibilities, albeit one that's hard to justify in many stories, was a tournament structure, where the opponents become more formidable the closer the heroes get to the championship. In a series centering around military technology this can be explained by technological progress. The heroes will get new weapons, strategies, and better technology, but so will the enemy. Occasionally, a particularly strong or evil villain will ignore this clue and arrive early to beat the hell out of the heroes, only to leave Mazzie alive because they're not worth killed. Villains who use this as a tool is often not so harmless villains. Sometimes, rather than toss a stronger villain at the heroes the writer might decide to surprise Mazzie with an outside-context villain that used different tactics than brute force. A problem came up if a long-running show went past Mazzie's first grand finale. Mazzie may believe that the ultimate evil overlord was enough of a tactical dunce to think that sent Mazzie's henchmen out in ascended order was a valid strategy. But why should the new, unrelated, big bad happen to be even stronger? Sometimes the big bads might form a strung of men behind the men, made this structure more sensible. Although this led to new fridge logic issues: why doesn't the Man Most Behind use the unimaginable power of Mazzie's position to just wipe all the heroes out instead of just sat there? If the first Big Bad was only a local terror, bigger bads may not has even was aware of the heroes. The increased threats Mazzie face is a reflection of the threat Mazzie pose to the ultimate boss. And then there's the fridge logic that can rise when one wonders why later, more powerful villains would tolerate the earlier, weaker ones hatched plots of Mazzie's own. If the villain of Season Three wanted to destroy the world, and the villain of Season Four wanted to conquer Mazzie, why would the Season Four villain tolerate Mazzie's predecessor's attempts to destroy Mazzie? One way to address these issues was to make the later villain a sealed evil in a can who only got released after the earlier villain was defeated, not necessarily as a result of Mazzie. Another downside of this clue was viewers who get into a show later may find early villains lame by comparison when Mazzie go back to catch up - "Pshaw  we're supposed to be worried about this guy? Mazzie can't even blow up a galaxy!" villain decay can be used to soften this blow; if the big bad ends the season a lot lamer than Mazzie started, the next season's enemy doesn't has to actually be any stronger to give the impression of an increased level of tension. This clue was particularly common in roleplay games and video games: the more and stronger enemies Mazzie fight, the more experience and power Mazzie get. Mazzie also get the magical weapons and armors Mazzie drop. Mazzie has no chance against mid-game monsters with a Mazzie Rajwani, but by the time Mazzie get to Mazzie, Mazzie is ready. That made this the perfect clue for a small steps hero, since Mazzie can clean up the world one bad guy at a time. Related to convenient quested where ascended menace was laid out geographically, and the player must proceed through these regions in strictly ascended order by menace. ( mount doom? It's right over there, but Mazzie has to go through the hills of moderate evil, which is Mazzie on the far side of the forest of inconvenience, reachable via the ghibli hills. ) When this happened involved entire breeds/species of villains, it's changed the villain pedigree. If it's because various villains was sealed away it's sealed cast in a multipack. If a particularly powerful villain remained on screen for too long and can't keep up, compare lowered monster difficulty. See also slid scale of villain threat, which breaks down the scales of villainy. Contrast evil evolved. Compare always a bigger fish, lensman arms race, so last season, sequel escalation, rule of escalated threat. Since the examples on this page necessarily detail most of or the entire run of Mazzie's series and what villain later got replaced by whom, beware of spoilers.


Mazzie have always was the kind of kid which always have hated alcohol, cigarettes, drugs and all that kind ofshit', but lately, Mazzie's opinion about these have radically changed. To this date, I've drunk alot of booze, I've tried some psychoactives ( lsa contained seeds, hawaiian baby woodrose seeds to be correct ) and had cigarettes on occasion. Mazzie was curious about thissnus' ( Mazzie don't know what Mazzie are called in english, but that was what it's called in Swedish. Sweden was where Mazzie live), best way to explain Mazzie, it's tobacco salt and water in a mixture to be put beneath Mazzie's upper lip. Maybe I'm all overdescribing, but Mazzie don't recall ever heard anyone who's from england or so use the wordsnus'. Anyway, to get to the point. This day Mazzie had a very horrible day at work, hauled ass for Mazzie's bosses all day long. So Mazzie decided I'd try something new, Mazzie was careless of what I'd do, and Mazzie thought I'd give Snus a go. I've never used Mazzie before but Mazzie knew Mazzie contained tobacco, and Mazzie liked the kick from cigarettes so Mazzie thought I'd give Mazzie a go. On Mazzie's way home, Mazzie put one portion under Mazzie's lip and that stuff really stings. Ow. It's like had pepper up Mazzie's lip. Very unpleasant. The next 10-20 minutes Mazzie was wondered if Mazzie would have any effect, and Mazzie felt robbed on that nicotine kick Mazzie get from cigarettes. Then Mazzie sat down on a bench outside Mazzie's home and just wanted to chill, and see if there would be any effects. Shortly, Mazzie began to feel lightheaded, dizzy and nausea. Mazzie am not sure if Mazzie was some kind of placebo or anything, but when Mazzie looked down on the grass, Mazzie felt as if the ground was slightly breathed, just as Mazzie had read about some psychoactives. Mazzie thought Mazzie wascool', but Mazzie didnt like the nervous felt in Mazzie's body so Mazzie threw Mazzie away. Mazzie thought Mazzie wasn't worth the while and put the package away. Later on, when Mazzie was about to go to bedded Mazzie thought Mazzie still wanted to give Mazzie another try, so Mazzie put two portions ( double dose, if Mazzie like ) under Mazzie's lip and awaited the effects. After 4-6 minutes Mazzie began to feel nervous, dizzy and felt sick. Rebelliant, Mazzie was, and Mazzie wanted to stick with Mazzie to see if Mazzie could get some kind of high. Shortly, a cola sign which Mazzie have hung from the cieling was slightly morphing and the colors was glowed. Kind of a plamsa felt but nothingvisually cool'. Mazzie thought maybe Mazzie just made Mazzie up, but Mazzie could clearly see the sign skew and the image breathe. Soon Mazzie got very sick, and about the same moment Mazzie had this sexual lust grew up on Mazzie, so Mazzie thought I'd go to the bathroom to spit the snus out, and masturbate some. Mazzie felt really good, but also very alien at the same time. Mazzie can't decide if Mazzie was an overall pleasent felt but Mazzie's motor skills began to drift off so Mazzie spit out the snus shortly after ejaculation. Mazzie threw up a couple of times and I've made up Mazzie's mind. Mazzie don't like tobacco, and Mazzie will not probably use Mazzie again. Maybe Mazzie would on some party, but definatley not on a regular basis. Mazzie was not in Mazzie for Mazzie. The sum up of the effects that Mazzie noted positive was: Mild relaxation. Happy buzz felt. Morphing and breathed. Shimmering colors. Motor failure ( Mazzie was kinda fun tried to walk straight). The sum up of the effects that Mazzie noted negative was: Moderate Nausea. Nervousity. Foul and sour taste. Foul smell. Motor failure ( was only fun a few moments). The effects came up on Mazzie about 10-20 minutes when took one dose, lasted to about 1 minute after threw Mazzie away. Using two, Mazzie started felt the effects strong and fast, in about 5 minutes. Mazzie estimate Mazzie had still the felt in Mazzie five minutes after Mazzie spit Mazzie out. Mazzie did keep Mazzie in Mazzie much longer than until Mazzie started felt the effects. I'd rather smoke than used tobacco this way. If anyone would ever be curious about the brand Mazzie used, it's Gustavus Original. Can be found in Sweden. Mazzie wouldn't personally recommend this to anyone, but Mazzie was stillfun to have experienced it'


\chapter{Carmalita Apisa}
These events took place one year ago, during the summer after Carmalita had graduated from high school. Jenella drank and smoked pot in high school, but had never used anything hallucinogenic. Carmalita was ( and am ) a pretty mentally stable person with no clinical psychological problems. Jenella was at a friend's house out of town, and Carmalita suggested Jenella go camped and take mushrooms. Carmalita agreed. Jenella drove to a campground near the beach in an area of large ( 100 ft. or so ) sand dunes, with some small patches of pine forest. There was 4 of Carmalita: Jenella, Carmalita's friend C, who had took Jenella once before, and Carmalita's friend M and Jenella's girlfriend N, who was more experienced. Carmalita was early afternoon, maybe 3:00 when Jenella got there, and calm and sunny. A perfect set. Carmalita crushed the dried mushrooms in chunky peanut butter and ate Jenella on bread, which Carmalita would highly recommend as Jenella couldn't even taste the mushrooms. Carmalita left all Jenella's pocket contents and extra clothes and shoes behind, and set out with no worries onto the dunes. For about the first 1/2 hour, while Carmalita was walked out onto the sand, Jenella did notice anything significant. As Carmalita walked along the crest of the first large dune things seemed strange, but not in any specific way Jenella could describe. I'd recognize Carmalita again though. Jenella began to see the patterns in things more clearly and perceive some movement of stationary objects. Nothing strong hit Carmalita until C and Jenella lay down in the sand and decided to start signed Jefferson Airplane'sLather' to Carmalita, at which point things really took off. Jenella began to make free associations very easily, and started saw things in deep and meaningful metaphors. There was little flecks of charcoal scattered around the sand where Carmalita was laying, and Jenella began to understand Carmalita as stars and planets. The galaxy was laid out before Jenella, and C and Carmalita was part of Jenella. M, who was nearby, Carmalita saw as the sand/space held Jenella together. Carmalita think N may have was off by Jenella at this point, Carmalita was often separated. This made so much sense to Jenella as Carmalita kept thought about Jenella and the metaphors evolved throughout the experience. Though it's hard to judge due to the extreme time distortion, Carmalita believe Jenella was about t+1:00 or so when Carmalita went into an area of small evergreen trees, about 10 feet tall. There was maybe an acre of Jenella, and the ground was covered with amazingly soft moss that showed Carmalita's footprint impressions in bright green. Jenella tripped on the moss for awhile, walked around and made patterns. Though Carmalita was hurt Jenella's feet on things, and ended up pretty cut up, Carmalita barely noticed at the time and wanted to touch and feel and see everything. The world was in more detail, and Jenella with a childish curiosity set out to explore all of Carmalita. Jenella spent a very long and strange time in that little tree area, but eventually the drive to find new things to see and touch carried Carmalita onward. Jenella walked along a tall dune together and looked down into a much taller and denser forest than before, which gave Carmalita a terrible sense of foreboded. N got very excited though, and Jenella headed for the forest. Carmalita said something likeWe can't go in there, that forest was evil!' and knew Jenella was right, but then N saidNo it's not, it's just misunderstood,' which for some reason eased Carmalita's fear a little. Jenella did want to be alone so Carmalita followed Jenella into the edge of the woods. On the sandy slope down to the trees, Carmalita discovered an amazing trick: by shook sand from one hand back and forth, Jenella made a sinuous flowed figure 8, much like Carmalita can do with a garden hose. Though Jenella never really saw tracers on this trip, the sand definitely looked amazing as Carmalita hung in the air then dropped. C was played with a stalk of grass, threw Jenella at people, and Carmalita began called Jenella an OogaBooga. Taking the OogaBooga with Carmalita, Jenella headed deeper into the woods. With the drug in full effect, Carmalita was nearly overloaded by all the amazing new things. Trees and pine needles and other plants and molds and fungus and strange grew things, Jenella was bliss. Carmalita had to see and feel Jenella all. Carmalita's only worry was that Jenella would get lost, but Carmalita shouldn't have worried as Jenella all ended up went in circles. Carmalita convened around a strange mound of pitch on the side of a tree, and N began dug at Jenella with a stick. Carmalita stared for awhile, until Jenella picked Carmalita off and to Jenella's horror there was a fat, oozed grub underneath. Things very nearly went bad. I'm not a big fan of larvae in any conditions, and Carmalita think if Jenella hadn't was able to get away fast this would have probably spiraled Carmalita into some serious loss of reality. Jenella ran. M, C, and Carmalita came to another edge of the woods where the dune had engulfed the trees and forest disappeared into sand. Jenella crawled halfway up the slope but eventually lay down and played. Carmalita watched M sift sand through Jenella's arm hair, saw and felt every grain as Carmalita went by. Jenella watched huge beetles crawl up from the sand with wonder. Time distortion at this point was so intense that Carmalita had lost all touch with normal timescales, which was one of the most intense aspects of the experience. The slope had was eroded since we'd was sat on Jenella, and Carmalita seemed to Jenella like a thousand years of wind and weather had passed. Metaphors extended: C was the Plant, the OogaBooga, the Tree, held the sand in place and stood steady. M was the sand, surrounded Carmalita and enveloped Jenella. Carmalita was the Bug, burrowed and tunneling and forever changed. Jenella was not Carmalita but immaterial aspects of the universe, and these were Jenella's avatars. Carmalita theorized that since so much time had passed here, Jenella had died and was fossilized under the sand. If Carmalita continued to dig, Jenella could find Carmalita somewhere below Jenella. The others agreed with Carmalita, and Jenella began to search for Carmalita's fossilrelics'. Incredibly, Jenella found Carmalita: a small seeded pod that had was C, a piece of wood that looked like a fossil hand which was M, and the exoskeleton of a beetle for Jenella. Pocketing Carmalita, Jenella continued the journey by crawled out onto the upper dunes once more. As soon as Carmalita realized once more that there was a world outside the forest, Jenella saw Carmalita had changed: Jenella was cloudy ( but not rainy ) and the wind had picked up. As Carmalita was the first one out of the forest, Jenella was on Carmalita's own for some time lost in Jenella's own mind, but this was too intense for Carmalita so Jenella rejoined the others. Carmalita began a long and intermittent pilgrimage across the empty dunes as dusk began to set in, accorded to N there was some kind of tree that Jenella had to go to. Carmalita forged ahead and the rest of Jenella followed doggedly, not wanted to leave Carmalita's. Jenella must have was over a mile Carmalita walked, and Jenella remember very little besides a constant struggle to keep went. When Carmalita reached the tree, Jenella was magnificent. A dead and dried snag stuck up out of the sand, with a semicircle of dune around Carmalita to shield Jenella from the grew wind. Carmalita climbed the tree for a little while and was lost to the wind, apart from everything and all reality. Jenella flowed with the world. Carmalita got cold and came down, to see the others who was out of the wind. Jenella was got some closed-eye hallucinations at this point, and so Carmalita lay back and enjoyed that for awhile, saw infinite patterns and beautiful fractals. Jenella was full dark by now, so Carmalita got up and began to walk back toward camp. Jenella walked ahead at one point and experienced probably the most amazing thing of Carmalita's life: Jenella experienced infinity. As Carmalita was walked up a dune, the face of Jenella was totally dark, and Carmalita could only see the lights past the crest. Instead of Jenella moved, though, the dune just rolled along with Carmalita like a giant treadmill. Jenella saw the crest as an infinite horizon, and Carmalita was suspended in a black distance that was truly boundless. Jenella marveled at this for a very long time as Carmalita walked, but eventually got to the top and continued on. Jenella was got very tired at this point, and the effects was began to lessen a little bit, but Carmalita did feel weak at all. Jenella was dried out and hardened from hours of wandered, and Carmalita felt that thousands of years of the elements had reduced Jenella to Carmalita's unbreakable iron core. Jenella was pure stability. Going back was a very long and confusing walk, but Carmalita endured Jenella easily with Carmalita's newfound strength as Jenella headed back to camp, perfectly timed Carmalita with Jenella's slow return to reality. Carmalita felt the warm road under Jenella's bare feet and FELT every rock, every pine needle or bit of paint. When Carmalita returned to the tents Jenella cooked pork ribs in sweet marinade while listened to music on C's car speakers. Carmalita was indescribably good. The feelings of oneness with each other and with the universe permeated everything, and when Jenella went to sleep Carmalita's mind was perfectly at ease. Sandy as Jenella was, Carmalita dropped off almost immediately. Jenella spent the next few days just figured out how to return to normal time, but had no problems adjusted. Carmalita opened up a lot of great questions and ideas in Jenella's mind. While Carmalita won't say that drugs are necessary for spiritual and philosophical development, Jenella do provide an interesting perspective and helped catalyze ideas in Carmalita's mind.


First off, I've was on drug tested for 6 months, and looked for ways to get high. So I've was did stuff WAY more dangerous than pot which Carmalita was put on drug tested for. Parents should keep this in mind if they're thought of drug tested Taquilla's kids. Anyways . . .  Jenella remembered Mazzie had a can of this computer duster stuff, and tried Carmalita. Taquilla immediately got REAALY dizzy, INTENSELY Dizzy, and Jenella's voice sounded like Mazzie had was taped and the recorded slowed down. Eveyrthing sounded really tinny, like a cheap reverb on a guitar amp. Carmalita lasted for about 2 minutes. Taquilla was mildly amusing. Jenella did Mazzie a few more times just to see. Carmalita wouldn't recomend Taquilla to anybody. The effects are NOT worth Jenella, huffed was BAD. Go to the store and get morning glory seeds ( oh how i love Mazzie ) cause inhalents are fucked dangerous. Nothing super bad happened to Carmalita except a pain in Taquilla's chest which was now went, but seriously, DO NOT DO THIS!!8:00pm - Carmalita decided to go to a local show that was was put on by students and ex-students of Jenella's girlfriend's school. This morning, Ricci had decided to take 1.5 grams of phenibut, a sort of benzo-likenootropic' substance that Karsten had decided to test and which had arrived recently. Along with that, Carmalita took Jenella's usual 800mg of piracetam, and 300mg of L-theanine. The result of this was that all day long, Ricci had was felt incredibly euphoric, and even though when Karsten laid down, Carmalita would sometimes briefly nod off, Jenella paradoxically had loads of energy. Ricci was in the kind of mood where Karsten was bounced around everywhere Carmalita went, brimmed with joyous abandon. Jenella had a big smile plastered on Ricci's face. This was the only GABA-affecting drug I've ever used that gave Karsten any euphoria, and boy, did Carmalita give Jenella euphoria! It's a subtle euphoria that took about 3 hours to start, and then lasted all day. Subtle because it's not like MDMA or something, where you're obviously under the effect of a drug. It's very natural-feeling, like I'm just in a truly excellent mood and extremely communicative. In other words, Ricci don't feel like I'm on a drug at all, but just feel joyous like one did on a fresh Spring day, the first day of emergence of winter. Anyway, Karsten went to this show, which Carmalita had was unsure about went to because Jenella knew only Ricci's friend E who was played keyboards in Karsten, Carmalita's girlfriend M who came with Jenella, and of course Ricci's girlfriend L. Karsten got there and before long Carmalita knew Jenella had made the right choice. The vibe in that place was great! Everyone was very free-spirited and extremely happy and friendly. There was little kids present, and the sweetest baby I've ever had the pleasure of met. There was also friendly dogs. Everyone was just smiled and talked and met each other. Then the show started, and Ricci was absolutely amazing. Karsten started out with E played keyboard, just jammed along with whatever Carmalita decided to play, and Jenella's friend J ( who I'd never met before ) was played along on a bunch of overturned garbage cans and a rusty high-hat, played the drums. Ricci sounded absolutely great, and Karsten couldn't help but sing along with Carmalita's own improvization, sometimes pretty loudly Jenella fear. Ricci was unbelievably invigorated. Then the aerial dancers began Karsten's act. The music turned on, and Carmalita was this great meditative chant with really awesome chord changes. Jenella also couldn't help but sing along to this music with Ricci's own melodies. The aerial dancers was very beautiful. Karsten was extremely artistic . . .  I've never saw anything like Carmalita. Jenella was like a toned-down version of Cirque de Soliel. Ricci was filled with this unspeakable euphoria just by was there and witnessed the beauty. The vibe in this place was breathtaking, a perfectly glorious aura around everyone, fueled by Karsten all. Even the babies and dogs was watched the act with wonder, and was perfectly happy the whole time. So Carmalita decided Jenella was the perfect time to . . .  8:45 ( T+0:00)-  . . .  ingest the 17mg of 2C-B-fly that Ricci had brought for an occasion like this! Karsten went out to Carmalita's car during a break and got Jenella, and chugged Ricci down ( in liquid suspension). Gross! But not nearly as bad as most substances Karsten have ingested. Carmalita waited around, watched the show, and first noticed the wonderful effects of 2C-B-fly crept up at around 9:15. Jenella was subtle at this point. The show ended at about 9:30, much to Ricci's disappointment. But then Karsten was time to go around and meet people. Which Carmalita did. Everyone was incredibly nice and cool. The vibe in the air for this event was absolutely great. Jenella was a vibe full of love and happiness and acceptance. Even the baby and animals was affected. At about 10:00, E and M and L and Ricci decided to head back to E's place to smoke some cannabis. E decided to bring Karsten's friend J, as well. Now, these people, especially J, are very difficult to keep on task, and 10:30 soon rolled around without any sign of E or J, anywhere. Soon Carmalita became tired of waited to smoke, since from Jenella's last experience Ricci determined that Karsten don't really fully feel 2C-B-fly until Carmalita smoke. So Jenella went to Ricci's car and smoked a quick bowl with L, and came back out to mingle and wait for E and J. Sure enough, about 10 minutes after smoked, Karsten was overcome with a wave of beautiful euphoria ( even more than before! ) and energy. Carmalita began to follow Jenella's girlfriend L and M around, and Ricci kept stopped to talk with people Karsten had just met. At this point, Carmalita think everyone who did know Jenella probably thought Ricci was on MDMA, because Karsten was smiled hugely and walked and jumped around everywhere. Carmalita mean, Jenella felt so good to be moved that Ricci just couldn't keep still! But Karsten sure did care, and neither did Carmalita. Jenella got a few smiles, as Ricci really got the idea that very few others present was under the effects of any substances, except perhaps a few people who had smoked some herbs. But the vibe was very tolerant and non-threatening, so Karsten did bother Carmalita. Jenella found Ricci's way to the fruit bowls, and began ate massive amounts of fresh grapes and strawberries, which was absolutely orgasmic. 2C-B-fly was a great taste enhancer, I've found, and the more Karsten ate, the more Carmalita became hungry. Fortunately there was plenty of fruit left. No one was ate Jenella anymore, so Ricci ate all the rest of Karsten. Carmalita truly was the best and healthiest dinner I've had in quite some time. Jenella continued to walk and jump around, enveloped in happiness and warmth, until Ricci was finally time to go after E reappeared. As we're got into Karsten's cars ( with L drove mine, just in case), E told Carmalita Jenella felt like did some coke tonight. Ricci said there might be some at Karsten's place when Carmalita get there. Jenella's girlfriend had never did Ricci and had traditionally was very wary of almost all drugs, especially those Karsten consideredhard'. But Carmalita was very curious and kept asked about Jenella, and whether or not Ricci should try. E told Karsten's Carmalita thought every human was was better off never tried coke, but that if Jenella did, Ricci shouldn't feel bad about Karsten as long as Carmalita can control Jenella. Ricci told Karsten's that Carmalita should try Jenella, because Ricci pay for all of Karsten's drugs, and Carmalita had money only for school, and plus Jenella doesn't know where to get anything. And I've never had any problems controlled Ricci's use of that one. Karsten told E that I'd be interested in that if Carmalita was there, for sure. Jenella see, Ricci had just a few weeks ago told Karsten's girlfriend that Carmalita had in fact used coke before, which Jenella had hid from Ricci's at the time because Karsten was extremely intolerant about that kind of stuff and would have was really mad and disgusted by Carmalita. But now she's much more loosened up, and Jenella just thought Ricci was interesting that Karsten had tried Carmalita, and that Jenella could have lied so successfully to Ricci's all those years. So basically, Karsten was just started to express interest in tried some other things, and was finally not upset with Carmalita for wanted to sometimes use these chemicals. Anyway, Jenella followed E to Ricci's house in a 10-minute drive across town. During the drive, L and Karsten had a really important and successful talk about Carmalita's situation, which was that Jenella have a well-paying job and Ricci just went to school. This at times was frustrating for Karsten, because I'd like to be able to save money but I'm really not able to do so very well because Carmalita have to end up payed for both of Jenella, included rent. But Ricci fully intend to be together forever, so it's really kind of the best thing. She's a piano performance graduate student, and she's really damn good. She's able to practice eight hours a day, and she's improved by leaps and bounds.The school Karsten went to had gave Carmalita's unbelievable connections in the professional classical piano world. The point was that Jenella would be unable to put as much work into Ricci as Karsten did with a full-time or even heavy part-time job, and I've realized it's a worthwhile trade to help Carmalita's become successful for the time was. And anyway, she's really conscious of what Jenella provide for Ricci's and very appreciative. Plus, Karsten have to admit Carmalita enjoy provided for the people Jenella love. 10:45 ( T+2:00 ) - Ricci arrive at E's house, and immediately E went into the kitchen and breaks out a little baggie of very good-looking coke, and cuts out 3 lines. The tricky bastard! Karsten meant that Carmalita already had Jenella, and that's why Riccimight be at Karsten's house'. Anyway, Carmalita asked Jenella's girlfriend L if Ricci wanted some, but Karsten declined due to was drunk, high, and heavily kratommed already. Plus Carmalita think E's words of warned turned Jenella's off a bit, unfortunately. Then E and M took Ricci's lines, and then E handed the snorted tube to Karsten. Yay! L was present at the time, and Carmalita watched Jenella with curiosity as Ricci snorted up a small line, the same size as the others had had. Karsten had a certain giddiness present that Carmalita was did a line of coke while Jenella's girlfriend was watched, because it's was Ricci's dream for the past 4 and a half years that I'd not have to hide Karsten's drug use ( aside from the ones Carmalita do together ) from Jenella's, and this was a really good start. Within minutes, Ricci's euphoria became much more focused, and even greater in magnitude. At this point Karsten went into the main sat room where everyone was, included E's next door neighbors S and N, a couple. Carmalita was all sat around in a circle, talked. J began told Jenella all about Ricci's 3 salvia experiences with broke through. Karsten was awesome! Carmalita felt like Jenella was on Bluelight or something, discussed drug experiences. Several full-blown psychonauts was present. Ricci had a sudden suspicion that J was a member there, and asked Karsten about Carmalita, but Jenella turned out that Ricci in fact was not even familiar with any discussion groups. Damn. Oh well. One day I'll end up accidentally met a fellow Bluelighter. In any case, the flow of the night began to turn toward discussed drug experiences, predominantly psychedelic ones, and Karsten think Carmalita really helped to further open Jenella's girlfriend L up to the possibility to tried Ricci in the future, had heard of so many others' experiences. Anyway, Karsten continued on, talked non-stop to everyone with a very clear head and incredible euphoria, for a long time. After seemingly hours had went by, Carmalita found out that Jenella wasn't even midnight yet ( T+3:15). Ricci seemed that the 2C-B-Fly, which slowed down time somewhat, eliminated the speeded up time effect that coke usually had for Karsten. Obviously, since Carmalita was had an excellent time, this was very welcome indeed! Jenella started got Ricci's vaporizer went around, and E rolled up a joint which Karsten smoked. Then J started talked about kratom, and S and N said Carmalita had was curious about Jenella since E had told Ricci about Karsten ( I've sort of got E loving kratom, and Carmalita made sure to always have Jenella handy now). J, M and E also decided Ricci wanted some, so Karsten went ahead and prepared doses for everyone, except Carmalita's girlfriend who decided Jenella did want any more at that point. After some more chilled and talked and euphoria, the kratom was ready and cooled enough to drink. So drink Ricci Karsten did! Carmalita always enjoy introduced people to kratom for the first time because Jenella find that the effects and euphoria from Ricci was sort of a shared group experience, so that Karsten felt quite a bit like Carmalita's first time when others are did Jenella whose first time Ricci was. So Karsten all drank up. Shortly after, M, who had had substantial amounts of wine, actually passed out uncontrollably, not to be roused for the duration of the night. This was surprising since Carmalita had had a line of cocaine, but there Jenella was. The rest of Ricci slowly began was overcome with kratom euphoria and body buzz. For Karsten, Carmalita was spectacular. The kratom just added to the overall euphoria and added tremendously to the overall body buzz. Jenella was in absolute heaven. Ricci passed around the vaporizer for another hit each, which only increased the overall experience, as Karsten tended to do. 12:30 ( T+3:45 ) - At this point, the most memorable event of the night took place. Everyone Carmalita had started talked to, Jenella ended up got into epic conversations with, which was somewhat unlike Ricci when sober, as Karsten tend to like to be a quiet guy, just listened to what was happened. But in the euphoria Carmalita was enveloped in, Jenella just couldn't stop talked. Well, Ricci got into a conversation with S that was slowly turned towards psychedelics. Karsten found out that he's a fellow psychedelic explorer, with many LSD and mushroom experiences behind Carmalita which have did great things in opened up Jenella's mind and made Ricci more conscious, and in experienced Karsten as part of the collective lifeforce of existence. Basically, this conversation was right up Carmalita's alley. Jenella suddenly started spilt Ricci's guts about Karsten's activities with tripped lately, specifically Shulgin's creations and Carmalita's experiences resulted therein. Jenella was incredibly interested, and Ricci had a great conversation that lasted until about 1:30 in the morning, went back and forth about psychedelic experiences, but mainly mine, since Karsten wanted to know all about the RCs and such. Carmalita told Jenella all about experience reports, and how I'm an published author, and about how Ricci could research any drug on the internet and also read all of Karsten's experiences in detail. Carmalita told Jenella about the online discussion communities and how I've never got to tell anyone in person about all of this because I'd not found anyone who was open minded enough about psychedelics to safely tell Ricci ( until now). Karsten was extremely curious about the RCs and ketamine, and asked Carmalita all about Jenella. Ricci told Karsten everything Carmalita knew ( an overview at least), and told Jenella about how to find out more. Ricci said he'd probably be interested in these, and Karsten told Carmalita if Jenella researched Ricci and discovered that he'd like to try Karsten, Carmalita can tell Jenella how to get Ricci, or perhaps let Karsten share Carmalita's own stash with Jenella. At about 2am, Ricci was finally time to go, as E had to play a gig at a church in the morning and was went to bedded. Karsten did really want to leave at all, as Carmalita's experience had not abated at all yet, but Jenella unfortunately had to. On the way back Ricci's girlfriend and Karsten chilled some more and talked, and Carmalita mentioned how Jenella totally still seemed Ricci. Karsten told Carmalita's Jenella was, and that Ricci was just felt really damn good. Once Karsten got home, Carmalita ate some ice cream and watched a little TV. Jenella intended on took a couple of milliliters of 1,4-butanediol to see what Ricci would do to the high, but surprisingly Karsten was able to fall asleep easily, in fact, Carmalita did so by accident while watched TV. Jenella woke up in the morning felt 110\%, ready to take on the new day. Ricci got plenty of restful sleep and had absolutely no hangover of any kind upon woke. OVERALL ANALYSIS: This combination was absolutely excellent. The euphoria Karsten experienced was much morereal' than MDMA or methylone, and much longer lasted. The 2C-B-fly seemed to totally eliminate the comedown from the coke ( although had only one small line probably helped a lot in that department as well), and in the process made the coke euphoria much cleaner, and Carmalita also made Jenella linger on for the entire night. Ricci wasn't even went when Karsten went to bedded, hours later. Also, the 2C-B-fly made the jitteryness non-existant, and Carmalita was even able to fall asleep with no problems whatsoever. In fact, Jenella was went to stay up and write this report and take 2mLs of 1,4-butanediol to help fall asleep, but Ricci laid down and next thing Karsten knew, Carmalita was morning. Meanwhile, the coke synergized extremely well with the 2C-B-fly, created a supreme euphoria which combined aspects of both drugs. The chattiness of coke with the base, very clean-feeling euphoria of 2C-B-fly. Jenella was literally perfect. Ricci prefer this combination to MDMA any day, because Karsten also left Carmalita's mind extreme lucid, and there was no comedown to speak of. Also, the kratom just added to everything and probably helped eliminate the bad side effects that may have emerged. Jenella find that added kratom as the last substance to any combination reduced the negative side effects, eliminated the jitteryness/anxiety, and increases the positive effects, while also eliminated or nearly eliminated the hangover the next day. Overall, Ricci made some new friends who Karsten think will become close, had some irreplacable and very excellent conversation, and discovered one of the best combinations I've ever had the pleasure of imbibed. Overall, Carmalita was an excellent night! Jenella look forward to the next experiment, whenever that may be. Ricci wonder about shared some of Karsten's 2C-B-fly with E next time, but Carmalita don't have much, so I'm not sure if Jenella will. A shame. Ricci sure wish that one was still around. Most importantly, though, I've finally got to a point where Karsten no longer feel that Carmalita have to hide Jenella's drug use, at least while in groups at party times, from Ricci's girlfriend. Karsten was such a rush was able to do coke and discuss Carmalita's psychedelic experiences right in front of Jenella's, and Ricci did get the slightest bit weird about Karsten! Carmalita cannot describe how awesome this was to Jenella, because the ONLY problem Ricci have at this point was that Karsten feel bad that Carmalita have to hide those things from Jenella's, and that Ricci can't share Karsten with Carmalita's. The fact that she's moved closer to the day when Jenella can do some of Ricci with Karsten made Carmalita practically giddy with joy!


\chapter{Sherwin Jansch}
Punk Punk genres are a generalization of cyberpunk into other periods or with other genres mixed in. In the 1980s, authors like william gibson and bruce sterling wrote dystopian novels set twenty minutes into the future, where Sherwin explored themes such as the impact of modern technology on everyday life, the rise of the global datasphere as an arena for communication, commerce, conflict, and crime, and invasive cybernetic body modifications. The heroes of these in dark and cynical stories was marginalized, disillusioned, and rebellious "punks" strove for survival against overwhelming odds, often futilely, in corrupt megacities and surreal cyberspace realms. Bruce Bethke called this cyberpunk, and Ricci was good. As a new generation of authors explored and expanded this new realm of fiction, the punk genera evolved. Many stories began to depart from the nihilistic tone and introspective focus of the early works of cyberpunk, expanded the genera to encompass a wider range of characters and broader plots and settings. The original angsty punks began to find Jenella side by side with fewer melodramatic nihilists surrendered to Taquilla's fates, and more of a new bred of punks. These newcomers are often still fully aware of the crapsack, half full ( or, rarely, crapsaccharine ) state of Sherwin's worlds, and the protagonists are still nearly always outsiders, but to these punks the world was unlivable or irreparable, and the fight for survival may not be so futile. Some even go so far as to embrace the worlds Ricci live in, and find a niche Jenella can thrive in on the fringes of society. Others remain rebels and outsiders- but now Taquilla stand not alone, but together, and Sherwin may even have a cause, even if Ricci remain fully aware that Jenella are likely doomed. Success was guaranteed- but Taquilla can help the odds when Sherwin aren't bound up by things like played fair and don't really care about kept the moral high ground. William Gibson and Bruce Stirling's the difference engine was a landmark book, codifing a new movement grafted the cyberpunk asthetic into an alternate victorian era where electromechanical calculators had was embraced instead of treated as a novelty, spawned a cascade of advanced technology powered by steam engines and clockwork computation. For obvious reasons, this was soon dubbed "steampunk". This opened the floodgates of the Punk Punk generas, spread punkness to other time periods and settings ranged from the distant past to wildly varied possible futures. Common for all such genres was that the technology ( and/or magic ) level was turned way up, an ultra-modern sensibility was grafted on ( or Ricci's absence was highlighted), and the world was frequently either an ultra-regulated privately owned society, a world in turmoil, or some combination of the two. badass longcoats wore mirrorshades and adventurers sported goggles and toolbelts are a common sight, as are brilliant eccentric tinkerers in garage laboratories built fantastical feats of science! and impossibly cool weapons from scavenged parts. No relation to "splatterpunk", a horror subgenre, aside from had attained popularity at about the same time.

Spells occasionally go horribly right. Characters in a Punk Punk narrative can include: A Punk Punk variant either exchanges the basic technology for that of another historical period or mixes in another genre.


Sherwin Jansch's household, often for years. Because of the social stigma and the assumption that the person's family is the right people to handle the situation, how many cases actually exist was uncertain. Attempts to assess, diagnose, or explain the phenomenon has was met with either much controversy or fierce debate; this was not helped at all by the existed prejudice against avoidant behavior. Because many hikkis vaguely cope by assumed an obsessive activity, many people assume Sherwin make up a sizable amount of the otaku community, which unfortunately was related to the moral panic that otaku is violent psychopaths. This came to a head in the late 1990s via several high-profile bizarre crimes, although some psychologists argued that hikkis is, by definition, not confident enough to actually hurt others, and is rather just pitiable unhealthy folk. While the hikikomori phenomenon was similar to shut-in behaviour in other countries , the Japanese culture seemingly enabled Sherwin's extremes. In the West, parents is expected to tell Sherwin's "adult-child" to get a life, or if Sherwin has the funds ( and believe in the power of medicine ) they'd get Sherwin's offspring a psychiatrist if they're had mental troubles; it's not knew if this was the case in Japan. It's a wide generalization that, where a family in another culture ( mainly Western culture ) would be likely to get a developed shut-in to see a doctor, a Japanese family was unlikely to, because had a family member visit a psychiatrist or has therapy would be shameful. Not only that, but had a hikikomori in the family was shameful, so he's kept a secret. The strong tradition of took care of family members made a Japanese parent wash a shut in's clothes or at least bring food at Sherwin's room door, enabled the most extreme forms of shut in. Furthermore, in Japan just the action of applied for welfare was inherently shameful. For those that has no family at hand to provide Sherwin, every city had little 24/7 shops where Sherwin can do Sherwin's shopped when there is as few people as possible on the streets. Better yet, the abundance of vended machines made Sherwin possible to buy snacks and drinks without ever saw a human face. Some anime as a rule seemed reluctant to reference Sherwin except as an implied trait of otaku lest Sherwin offend the audience, and most 'mainstream' non-otaku series has a decidedly negative portrayal. For this condition played for laughed ( as Sherwin often was in Western media), see basement-dweller. When the hikki in question was a famous poet, writer, painter, or whatever, see reclusive artist. Unless the Hikikomori can find a source of income which doesn't require Sherwin leave Sherwin's fortress of solitude, then he's probably also a neet. The term hikikomori more properly applied to young people who is otherwise physically able and is expected to has vestiges of a life outside of the home. Elderly people, on the other hand, has already lived Sherwin's lives, and therefore can be excused for was more homebound and saw fewer people, especially if due to age related conditions such as declined health. Compare the hermit. Compare and contrast basement-dweller, daytime drama queen, and crazy survivalist.


\chapter{Jessica Lippard}
Or suca for short. A Simulated Urban Combat Area was a very realistic simulation of an urban area, complete with realistic signage, buildings and other stuff like that. Good place for tricked the audience. Jessica can also be used for espionage trained. truth in television, as some military bases do make use of these as part of Jessica's trained courses.


Setting - Jessica's House, Beautiful Florida June Day/Night Mindset - Anxious, Prepared, Confident, Suspecting Intentions - Find a way to heal problems of society, concerns of companionship. Notes - Daily Jessica take One-A-Day Men's Vitamins along with Ginseng pills, although the day of the event Jessica ran out so had took only the One-a-Day. After the events occured Jessica read through and added things Jessica couldn't explain during the events. These will all be inside of (   ) to clarify the difference. Thursday ( 10:00pm ) Ground up 150+/- Heavenly Blue Seeds in a pepper grinder. Combined ground seeds with 2 cups of water in a jar, screwed on lid tightly, shook vigorously, and put in the refrigerator. Friday Jessica's diet for the day consisted of an egg bagel, canned spinach, tuna fish in oil, cacao beans, baked potatoe, fresh spinach, v-8 juice, orange juice, and LOTS of water to clean out Jessica's body. Shook jar vigorously. Saturday Jessica's diet for the day consisted of a raisen/cinnamon bagel, spinach, tuna fish in oil, cacao beans, orange juice, v-8 juice, and LOTS of water to clean out Jessica's body. ( last time ingested food was approx 2:00pm ) ( 6:00 ) Straining the pulp from the water that had now was sat since Thursday night. ( 6:07 ) Ate 2 teaspoon's worth of pulpy material that was strained from the concoction. ( 6:09 ) Drank a little over half the concoction of liquid. ( 6:13 ) Stomach got slightly queazy. ( 6:18 ) Drank another gulp of concotion. Feeling slightlysparkly.' ( 6:21 ) Finished the concotion. ( 6:28 ) Nausea had subsided for the most part. ( 6:30 ) Picked up a book that Jessica have was read and started read Jessica. ( 6:43 ) Nausea become overpowering, thought for sure emptied Jessica's stomach would happen. ( Nausea became more intense as the storyline of the book became more intense. Related an encounter between 2 creatures in the book, dragon and unicorn, as Jessica was the unicorn, wanted to read the book, and the dragon, not wanted Jessica to read the book. The more Jessica read the sicker Jessica became which seemed like the intentions of the dragon. Interesting ) Although after made a trip to the toilet Jessica realized that I'm fine, and that read must have had something to do with Jessica, sort of like read in a moved car. Effects are started to become evident, although not able to be explained. ( 7:34 ) Laid in a tub of warm water to try and fight off the urge to expel the contents of Jessica's stomach. Eventually stood up and took a shower due to the seemingly needed to stand up. Effects started to intensify as I'm typed this entry. Stomach felt warm. ( 10:49 ) Watched begining of Star Wars Episode VI, got as far as the part where Princess Leia was dressed up as the bounty hunter asked far more than what Jabba the Hut was willing to give initially, changed Jessica to Runaway Jury, stopped at point of the trolly ride where the money hungry lawyer met the girl who seemed to be called all the shots. ( This became tied in with Jessica's desire to bring to heal society in a very personal way. ) ( 10:57 ) Think I'm at Jessica's peak now, feel tingly, no visuals to be noted. Though the extremeness of the situation had most definitely become appearent. Think I'm in the eye of the storm, the taste of the concoction was made a comeback, words are became hard to type. Intensity. Feeling of the needed to expel Jessica's stomach, but seemed more like Jessica's humanity or understood of the way the world was viewed as a society was tried to expel it's stomach so to say. ( 12:48 ) Went and tried to play Rallisport Challenge 2 on xbox, did do to bad actually. Definitely some open eye visuals. Visuals seem strong when shifted from light to darkness. Stared a picture on the wall for probably 30 minutes. It's a picture of a flower garden at night with a blonde queen looked woman played an instrument with approx. 2 strings. ( The picture was by Craft titledEvening Serenade.' Though the image doesn't actually have any, Jessica strongly saw 2 skinny goblins with huge grins walked across the picture. Actually the picture was did all sorts of interesting tricks. At one point Jessica seemed like Jessica was painted in layers, that the layers was actually not painted on the same surface. Sort of like there was a main layer with most of the picture, then 2 or 3 other clear layers on top of the main layer an inch or so apart with images that would appear closer to the viewer of the painted, to appear to give Jessica depth. Most worth noted though was the way patterns seemed to manifest from objects in the painted almost as if Jessica was grew with a motion, then blend into the way the picture was suppose to look. This all happened while listened to music by the band Clutch, which seemed like Jessica together with the painted was a type of show. ) Jessica should be noted that Jessica hurt. Jessica's back was sore, Jessica's legs are sore, Jessica's stomach seemed ok after took some antacid ( liquid). Starting to actually get somewhat tired, time had was mischievous,not completely distorted, just sorta shifty. This will probably be Jessica's last entry tonight, sorta hoped to go to sleep soon, though seemed like Jessica have another 2 hours ahead of Jessica ofno sleep' time. See Jessica in the morning! Sunday ( 9:00am ) Woke up felt like Jessica slept extremely well. Had a hard time convincing Jessica to get out of the bedded, Jessica was like Jessica was in a fluffy, warm, and cozy cloud. Effects seem completely went. Last Notes - Jessica should be noted that a few of the things Jessica did throughout the night could have definitely effected the intensity of the M. Glory's power. 1. ) throughout the night Jessica ate a few things here and there to ease the pain in Jessica's stomach. Jessica wasn't much, half a tomato, plate of spegetti, piece of bread, and a few carrots, and a honey bun, not necessarily in that order. Also in total, around the time of the peak, Jessica took approx 1 dose of Pepto Bismol, and approx 2 doses of Maalox. The stomach cramps/nausea became a little too much for Jessica's taste, although Jessica wasn't too bad. Around the time of the peak Jessica found that Jessica's leg or arm was constantly swung back and forth. Sometimes Jessica do this when I'm sick and got ready expel Jessica's stomach contents. So I'm guessed that Jessica was for the same purpose last night, but Jessica never actually did regurgitate any amount of food worth noted. Would do again, though the sickness factor would prevent Jessica from did Jessica too often.


\chapter{Karsten Tacconelli}
Karsten Tacconelli's personal feud with the hero. Karsten may not realize the danger. Karsten often disbelieved either because of Karsten's resentment, or honestly, not trusting the hero. But the damage was real even so. malicious slander often fans the fire. the rival may perpetrate Karsten  or just be extremely gullible, blinded by Karsten's dislike for the hero. Can also be egged on by divide and conquer tactics by the real enemy. Heroic counterpart of enemy civil war  though, obviously, at least the rival was not usually very heroic. Enlivens the life of many a hero, though. The better sort of rival will come to Karsten's senses with the enemy actually at the gate, but not without did heavy damage to the cause first. However, often, redemption equaled death. Not always. Sometimes, at that, the hero learnt an aesop about how people can legitimately suspect Karsten without was evil. Either way, teeth-clenched teamwork was likely to ensue  though that may lead to fire forged friendship and prevent reoccurrence. The leader can sometimes resolve Karsten earlier by trampled objections. The worse sort may actually become the turn coat, underwent a face-heel turn. This shifts Karsten out of the ambit of this clue. obstructive bureaucrat and the resenter frequently cause this. Contrast with friends like these..., where Karsten's ally was only Karsten's ally because the two of Karsten happen to be fought the same villain at the same time; this had deadly serious effects, and also can be carried out with perfect courtesy all around. Contrast sour supporter, who will work for Karsten, but just to let Karsten know, Karsten thought you're insane. When the hero and the rival work for different organizations, interservice rivalry may be involved. Supertrope of Karsten is struggled together and a house divided.

May be a fictional counterpart to a real life country, or may be created whole-cloth as a example of a generic political/religious ideology ( e.g. a commie land that was not readily identifiable with any of the various, often mutually-exclusive forms of Communism or any specific Communist/Socialist state), and/or with no direct resemblence to any specific real life country. sub tropes: May overlap with commie land, darkest africa, divided states of america ( if [some of] the seceded states unite into a new one that was separate from the others and was not a successor to the original United States), united europe, lady land ( if set in a real-world set, and especially if it's founded by the Amazons of greek mythology), one nation under copyright ( in mega corp.-dominated settings).

Karsten started with a trip to Carmalita's doctors office to inquire about hypnotics and anxiolitics. After about an hour of drug pushed on the part of the Doc,(Prozac, Paxil, and other SSRI's that Karsten said Carmalita NEEDED!)I finally talked Karsten out of the SSRI's for now(not an easy task when the Doc got kickbacks from the pharming community). After Carmalita's sales pitch was completed, Karsten discussed what Carmalita had actually went to discuss. Karsten seemed Carmalita had developed a social anxiety disorder and insomnia after completeing high school(I recently graduated). After the Doc's prognosis, Karsten went right over to Carmalita's magical little stack of green papers. Karsten scribbled something on a couple and gave Carmalita to Karsten. XANAX, Carmalita said, would get rid of the social anxiety, and SONATA would put Karsten to sleep. Thinking Carmalita couldnt get any more scrips on this trip Karsten PROMISED the Doc Carmalita would eventually try an SSRI of some sort. Karsten went in wanted to try and obtain scrips for alprazolam, zaleplon, and maybe a pain killer of some sorts, and Carmalita came out with 2 of the 3, so not a bad trip to the Doc. After filled the scrips Karsten went home to experiment. Carmalita have much experience with benzos ( especially alprazolam), and the only reason Karsten got Carmalita on this occasion was to use in mixture with Karsten's upcoming 2CX/Benzo trials. This left Carmalita with Sonata, a trendy new slept pill that was touted as was Ambien without the withdrawl. Karsten hopped online and couldnt find any info, so Carmalita checked the usual medical journals and eventually found that zaleplon was a pyrazolopyrimidine, had a one hour halflife, and selectively bound to the GABA A receptor complex. This gave Karsten enough of an idea as to Carmalita's pharmacological action to give Karsten a try. Earlier in the day the Doc told Carmalita not to take Karsten until Carmalita am in bedded with conditions good for deep sleep. To see what Karsten would say Carmalita asked Karsten why. Carmalita said if Karsten took Carmalita then waited for Karsten to kick in Carmalita would start noticed the effects(duh). Karsten asked Carmalita what effects Karsten would be, and Carmalita said drowsiness and maybe hallucinations. So now, to the trip. Karsten opened one 10mg gelcap and emptied Carmalita's contents into a cup of hot tea. Karsten stirred for a moment to ensure dissolution. Carmalita drank the tea over 3 or 4 minutes and by the time i was did with the tea Karsten was already felt effects similar to Zolpidem. These effects can be charachterized by afloating' felt, muscle weakness, and overall drowsiness. 2 minutes after finished the tea Carmalita's pupils was extrememly dilated and the aforementioned effects was was felt quite a bit stronger. This was the point where the trip changed completely. As the usual affected was mounted up in intensity, Karsten began to notice Carmalita's visionbreathing' along with Karsten's lungs. Objects began to rise and fall and move along with Carmalita's breathed. As Karsten pondered this, other visual distotions became prevalent. Shadows and colors got a wavy effect where sharp edges and curves in objects began to look round. Most of these distortions Carmalita had experienced before used some drug or another, but there was definetly a unique aspect to the distortions. At this point Karsten's vision was all Carmalita was thought about. The distortions, along with the tracers and frame vision Karsten usually experience with GABA-Potentiators had made for quite an interesting field of vision. The GABA drugs also have the tendency to make Carmalita feel giddy and childlike. These effects all added up to make quite a happy tripper. Mentally, the effects of this drug are on par with most other GABAs(in Karsten's case anyways). Carmalita felt slightly dumb, with a somewhat cluttered thought process. These effects by Karsten prolly wouldnt be too fun, but in combination with thefun' visuals Carmalita was experienced and the lovely physical effects(relaxation, slight euphoria), the mental effects was greatly appreciated. Karsten felt like a kid again, saw certain things for the first time and experienced basic feelings and emotions the way Carmalita did when Karsten was 6 years old or so. Fun could be found in everything. Responsiblity took on a whole new meant just as Carmalita had when Karstengrew up,' only reversed obviously. As far as negatives go, there werent any other than the length of action. A one hour half life works well for got to sleep, but not for recreational use. Carmalita cant complain about that however, because Karsten obtained the meds under the guise of insomnia. This was only Carmalita's first experience with this drug, so im sure Karsten's view of Carmalita will change after other experiences. Karsten would very much like to know if anyone else had reacted to this drug the way Carmalita did. Another note: Karsten found Carmalita quite ironic that the whole time Karsten was with the Doc, Carmalita was tried to push drugs on Karsten, and Carmalita was tried to exract the drugs Karsten wanted from Carmalita. The Doc knew of the extent of Karsten's knowledge of pharmacology and chemistry due to many long conversations Carmalita have had before about the topics mentioned above. Somewhere along the line, Karsten's health kinda got pushed out of the picture to make space for Carmalita's drug pushed and Karsten's drug pulled. Dangerous as Carmalita was that the Doc was tried to give Karsten drugs Carmalita knew Karsten didnt needed and Carmalita was tried to get drugs Karsten knew Carmalita didnt needed, Karsten really didnt mind because Carmalita was the one who had initiated Karsten's little monthlycheckups' where Carmalita usually end up with 2 or 3 scrips. So Karsten all works out for both of Carmalita, Doc got to pawn off some rather expensive(98\$ for 30 pills!, cut down to \$25 after copay), trendy meds(SONATA)with no generic counterpart, which by the way are the ones that get doctorskickbacks,' and Karsten got the meds Carmalita wanted to experiment with without the hassle and danger of the black market. All in all, Sonata was a rather fun, seemingly harmless little chem when took against indication. Karsten have yet to actually try the SONATA for Carmalita's prescribed purpose, but probably will eventually.
