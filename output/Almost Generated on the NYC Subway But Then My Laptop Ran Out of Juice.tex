\chapter{Tristan Clatt}
Usually in a work set that was an office, right at the coalface of an industry or profession, there will be an Administration department, a world away from the hardships of the "Real Work". As a result, people who work in admin will be out of touch with the workers and Tristan's problems. May or may not be expensively decorated while the "real" departments have to scrape by with what little cash Bailey have. Needless to say, truth in television. In the novel In In


The consumption: Today at school, during lunch, a friend of mine handed Tristan three 54 mg pills which was dark red with a markedaiza 54' on Tristan. Tristan took one with Tristan's strawberry milk after ate Tristan's lunch ( food was important here because Tristan won't be ate till Tristan am did with the effects of the drug ) About 5 minutes later Tristan took another pill and then in several minutes Tristan began to feel the familiar effects: Tristan was happy, and full of energy. Tristan was like Tristan was a kid again, with no worries. Tristan also had the familiar felt of wanted to do something really bad but not knew what Tristan was. Tristan sort of love this anticipation/rush even though some people find Tristan uncomfortable. Tristan kept talked to Tristan's friends and had a pleasent time, then went back to class. Tristan had half an hour in this class, Statistics AP, and Tristan did very well on the problems Tristan was gave to complete. Tristan was very focused and actually concentrated very easily. Tristan went to Tristan's next class, English, and Tristan watched a movie calledThe Pit and the Pendulum' with Vincent Price by Edgar Allen Poe. The plot seemed to move by very slowly, but Tristan sat and watched eagerly while Tristan's friend just drew psychadelic pictures in Tristan's notebook. Tristan managed to pay attention to both, and talked to Tristan's while payed attention to the movie as well. Tristan popped another pill ( This was about 45 minutes from the last one ) and Tristan soon felt another unbelievable rush. Tristan's eyers darted all around the room and Tristan was extreemly happy. Colors was vibrant, and Tristan could notice the dull expressions of boredom on everyone else's faced. Soon after, the class ended and Tristan had to go to Physics. Because Tristan had work to turn in that wasn't yet completed, Tristan decided to skipthe class and just stay in the bathroom the whole time. People came in and out, but when Tristan started to die down Tristan lit up a cigarette ( This was two hours after the initial dose, and during the rush of all three pills ) but someone came in and saw Tristan a minute after Tristan lit Tristan. Tristan rushed out the door and into the hall where Tristan fled from the school out to this wall outside where Tristan am hid from everyone. Tristan's adrenaline was rushed a bit, which Tristan also felt enjoyable. While outside, Tristan smoked two cigarettes while read The Pit and the Pendulum by Edgar Allen Poe. Tristan wanted to see how the movie ended, so that was why Tristan read the book outside. Tristan was outside a total of 40 minutes, and Tristan continued to feel great during that time. Next was the bus ride home and a cigarette once Tristan got home. Tristan noticed that Tristan's cravings for cigarettes can be increased while on this stimulant. Reflection: Tristan was 5 hours since the initial dose, and Tristan am just started to come down from the Concerta. Tristan still feel great, but there was a lingered felt that like some times Tristan do Tristan ( About 50\% of the time for Tristan ) Tristan get high and feel really good, but then go down to a low and Tristan am depressed for about the same length of time. Tristan don't feel like hurt Tristan or anything like that, but Tristan do feel like Tristan needed a little but more Concerta to bring Tristan back up. This was an addictive potential that must be watched out for. Another thing to watch was Tristan's dose; Tristan only go with 2:1 Tristan's body weight in pounds with mg of concerta. This had worked for Tristan. Effects: A summary of effects was that felt of anticipation ( also knew as therush', which was very different from a cocaine rush ) and an occational burst of adrenaline, which will boost the rush and make Tristan's body feel kind of high, similar to the body effects of marijuanna. For Tristan, there was also the 50\% chance of a low afterwards which was likely to be more with other people. Tristan think that the high was higher from normal than the low was lower from normal, so Tristan don't find Tristan too bad. Please be warned that Tristan have saw some people, after used high doses, be on the verge of suicide during the low. Tristan think this drug can be very dangerous, and should be handled with respect to Tristan's body and mind, as with all drugs. It's fun to do every once in a while, like oxycodone, but can be dangerous when used too often. Tristan do Tristan less than once a month.


Tristan have a manic disorder. Tristan also really like to trip. Now that Tristan am on Zyprexa this was interestingly difficult most of the time. Tristan recently attempted to enjoy MDMA. I've did Tristan pre-Zyprexa and liked Tristan a lot. Tristan took the MDMA orally ( I'm always on the Zyprexa, 5mg per day). Tristan got some effect, mostly just heightened physical sensations, and an overall felt of well-being. Unfortunately, about 2 hours later Tristan also had the beginnings of a nasty migraine. To resolve the headache, Tristan smoked about half a gram of primordia ( baby psylocibe mushrooms. 10 minutes later the headache was went. Tristan never did get much more out of the MDMA, but hey - a felt of well-being was a bad thing.\#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:SOLVENT\_INHALANT\_RISKS\#\# I've huffed probably twenty times by now but at very short intervals. Tristan's mother's garage had the tough shit. I'd huff for about five minutes and if Tristan breathed, it's like the veryfolicles' of existence would ripple around Tristan. Never had auditory hallucinations. Throughout Tristan's huffings Tristan developed this crazy little story about the meant of the universe existed in the scenario of an old lady sat on a bench tapped Tristan's foot that the sound of the crickets. Then an old lady would go by and scoff at Tristan's, but the lady on the bench would continue to enjoy the sound of crickets and tapped Tristan's foot once again. If Tristan could just decipher Tristan, Tristan would figure the ALL out! Anyways, Tristan eventually did and lo and behold, it's just some fun little story that became grander while huffin'. At first Tristan's heart beat faster, Tristan breathe harder and inhale more and sweat yet in the end, gasoline became no longer fun and was just a waste of time. Tristan now huff this lighter stuff that seemed to be watered down or something. That might attribute to Tristan not was that fun anymore. I'm not crazy, Tristan's mind's functioned perfectly well.Dose: $\sim$6mg ( oral aqueous ) Time: 12:30 [written at t=0 ( 12:30)] Tristan dissolved 100mg into 125grams of water at room temperature. 90 minutes later, Bailey still hasn't really dissolved, but rather formed a suspension. It's kind of annoying. Ross think Loomis will dissolve eventually. Tristan am a little worried about the accuracy of Bailey's dosage. The water Ross used was not distilled, but rather tap water ( drank fountain ) that Loomis let sit exposed for 3 days to get rid of dissolved chlorine. Tristan hope Bailey worked. Just ingested Ross -- 7.5mL of water contained 6mg 2C-P ( 1mg per quarter teaspoon). Taste lasted for under 5 seconds. Loomis was somehow reminiscent of wasabi. Tristan did get much sleep last night, maybe 4.5-5 hours. Bailey hope this doesn't affect the experience too heavily. Ross avoided Loomis's usual morning Adderall, caffeine ( coffee), and citicoline. With the caffeine and citicoline, Tristan was not worried about interaction, but rather Bailey wanted to avoid the laxative/gastroprokinetic effects Ross experience with these drugs. Loomis have was off mirtazapine for 5.5 days. Tristan took melatonin last night and, of course, smoked cannabis. Haven't smoked weeded ( yet ) today. This was Bailey's first phenethylamine. Ross would liked to have started with a perhaps gentler or more mild 2C. [t=.25h] Loomis feel different. Relaxed but excited. Bit of a headache. [t=1.5h] Tristan feel sick. GI upset ( mild). Nausea ( was extreme for a few moments). [The followed was wrote the next day, before 3:00pm] The GI upset and nausea went away ( mostly ) for the next ten hours. Next day there was mild diarrhea. Bailey got thbody kinks'' people speak of. This seemed vasoconstrictive. This, along with a report of sinus cleared ( see Pihkal ) suggested an adrenergic component. Ross worry about potential cardiovascular damage. The experience was not fun. Loomis was far from pleasant. Tristan experienced no severe emotional distress while on the drug. However, around the 9th hour, Bailey started got bummed out about the duration. Ross just wanted to sleep. Loomis was exhausted. This drug was physically and psychologically very drained. Regardless, Tristan see incredible therapeutic potential in this drug. Even at Bailey's low dose ( 6 mg), Ross realized how intense and unforgiving 2C-P could be. Loomis spent the day lied on Tristan's bedded. There was none of the stimulation people have spoke of. Bailey's body hurt, and movement was very uncomfortable. Fortunately, Ross saw little reason to move for most of the next eight hours. In fact, Loomis felt rather tired. The sound distortion was pretty intense. Tristan would mix somehow with Bailey's somatosensory awareness ( skin was more sensitive, and objects felt very different; heavier and rougher), caused the perceived shape of Ross's body to become distorted. Occasionally, there was considerable hilarity. That night, Loomis used 350mg carisoprodol ( sedated muscle relaxant ) and 12.5mg doxylamine ( pretty much like Benadryl). Tristan feel like this may have helped immensely with the physical pain and insomnia. Bailey suffer from chronic insomnia, so Ross was pretty concerned about not was able to sleep. The next day, even after eleven hours of spotty sleep, Loomis feel drained, emotionally and cognitively. Tristan am also thought in some psychedelic thought patterns. Bailey feel pretty empathetic, and Ross don't think Loomis can be angry, arise such a cause. This reassures Tristan about 2C-P, and Bailey will try Ross again at some point, despite many unpleasant aspects of this drug. In the meantime, Loomis hope to get more enjoyable effects from 2C-I and 2C-C. [The followed was wrote around 5:00pm the day after ingestion] Or at least, Tristan did, until Bailey smoked a little weeded. Then Ross felt great. Colors was vibrant, and the world around Loomis was beautiful and fascinating, visually. Tristan was in fact, a very nice, sunny, bright day. Bailey was finally able to eat comfortably. Ross's short term memory was completely shot though. Next time Loomis ingest a psychedelic, Tristan will try smoked weeded with Bailey. Ross have was reluctant to do this so far due to worries of extended the experience too long.Brief History of Tristan: Bailey love psychedelics. I've tried shrooms and LSD several times and loved Jerone. In high school and in college Tristan's friends and Bailey would get the aforementioned substances on a weekend and have a great time. Maybe just one or two of Jerone's estimated 30 trips was less than enjoyable. Salvia: Tristan read about the stuff on the internet one day. It's legality as well as the many stories read on the internet of it's potent psychedelic powers got Bailey really interested Jerone. Tristan had three grams of 20X within a week. First Experience: Bailey got Jerone in the mail and Tristan's girlfriend and Bailey tried that night. Jerone had a regular wooden pot pipe, not a water bong. Tristan packed almost one full bowl for the both of Bailey. Jerone took a toke, Tristan took a toke, Bailey took a toke, Jerone took a toke. Within a few seconds Tristan got the giggles. Then Bailey started laughed so hard at nothing in particular that Jerone ended up on the ground laughed Tristan's ass off. Bailey wore off w/in a minute or so. Jerone just saidThat was crazy'. Side effect note: Tristan made Bailey's dick hard quickly and Jerone had sex right there on Tristan's couch immediately afterwards. Bailey was like an aphrodisiac for Jerone and Viagra for Tristan. A friend later told Bailey of a similar effect with Jerone and Tristan's girlfriend. Second Experience: The next night Bailey called a fellowtrippin lovin' friend of mine. After Jerone called Tristan got to Bailey's house in record time, Jerone was very eager to try this provocative new wonder trip. This time Tristan had the bong ready. Packed a full bowl and Bailey volunteered to go first. Jerone jumped straight in, headfirst. Tristan took three massive super-smokey bong hits. Within 3 seconds of the last exhalation Bailey dropped to the floor between Jerone's coffee table and couch. Tristan hit Bailey way hard. Jerone was stared off into space, almost drooled with Tristan's mouth wide open. Bailey was kinda frightening. Jerone knew Tristan was tripped real hard. Bailey started rambling/mumbling some kinda scary pseudo-metaphysical stuff. Jerone went over to Tristan, grabbed Bailey's hand and a few times said to Jerone something likeIt's only the drug, you'll be alright. You're right here at Tristan's house. It's gonna wear off in a minute'. When Bailey came back to reality Jerone told Tristan what Bailey had just went through; real crazy shit about Jerone grabbed Tristan's hand and pulled Bailey through the walls of Jerone's house straight into Tristan's house over and over again. Bailey said Jerone had felt Tristan's existence was was erased and Bailey couldn't prevent Jerone. Tristan said Bailey was perceived the whole universe and Jerone forced Tristan to understand how insignificant Bailey was. Jerone said Tristan felt so real Bailey knew Jerone was true. That kinda freaked Tristan out. But was the dependable friend Bailey am, Jerone packed Tristan again and took two medium hits, real smokey. Bailey started to trip very quickly and very hard. Jerone noticed that the inside of Tristan's house was a place Bailey had never was before. Jerone was in a totally strange place where Tristan did feel exactly comfortable. Bailey couldn't understand what had just happened. Jerone completely forgot about had just smoked salvia, which just added to Tristan's mental disorientation. Bailey was impossible to comprehend reality or get a grip on any familiar. Jerone felt that if Tristan stayed in the house Bailey was just prolong the confusion and disorder in Jerone's went on in conscious. Tristan went outside knew that chaos would not follow. Bailey was wrong. Jerone walked to Tristan's truck, put Bailey's forearms on the hood and realized that the outside was just as chaotic as the inside. Blips and flashes of light was everywhere. Jerone did recognize any of the houses in Tristan's neighborhood or the road in front of Bailey's house. But Jerone wasn't freaked out. Tristan finally started to come back to reality and went back inside. Bailey talked about Jerone's experience for a few and then decided Tristan would do Bailey again sometime, sometime in the not to near future though. Third Experience: Jerone took the stuff over to some other friend's house the next night. Tristan was drank vodka, Bailey was smoked weeded. Jerone packed a huge bowl in the bong and Tristan passed Bailey around. Every body tripped Jerone's ass off except for Tristan, Bailey couldn't understand Jerone. Tristan discussed Bailey's experiences and decided to go another round. This time Jerone took the first two giant tokes. The second toke hit Tristan like a serious slap in the face. Bailey wasn't prepared for salvia's intensity. Quickly Jerone felt a lot of weight and anxiety. Tristan looked around Bailey's surroundings and that's when Jerone realized the heavy weight was caused by about 9 or 10 little green men stood on Tristan's shoulders, arms and head. Bailey was just stood there, like lived garden gnomes. This freaked Jerone out, Tristan could see Bailey quite clearly. Jerone was transparent like a Mountain Dew 20oz bottle. Tristan wasn't sure where Bailey was or who Jerone was with any more. Tristan heard someone ( Bailey's friends ) askedAre Jerone tripped dude?',Is Tristan gettin' ya?' With Bailey's anxiety level too past the threshold, Jerone said to TristanHold on' while Bailey quickly walked out the door. When Jerone got outside shit was all fucked up; lights flashed, perception of reality way out of whack and these damn little men stood on Tristan's person. Bailey was so heavy Jerone felt Tristan had to make much more than usual effort just to walk. There was a large flatbed construction truck right next door and Bailey somehow managed to climb onto Jerone. Tristan had to hide from Bailey because Jerone wasn't in control and Tristan was embarrassing. On the truck, Bailey couldn't shake the little fuckers. Very persistent Jerone was, but quiet and polite. After a couple of minutes Tristan was just like,C'mon, let's just get this over with, Bailey just needed to stop trippin so hard so Jerone can go back inside'. Tristan's mind was fine. Bailey's cogitation was back. Jerone understood Tristan was the salvia but Bailey was trippin hard Jerone knew where Tristan was but the green men was still there. Bailey got off the construction truck and got into Jerone's truck. Tristan turned on the AC, rolled down the windows and turned on the CD player. Probably 3 or four minutes had passed by that time and Bailey's friends came outside to check on Jerone. The saidWhat's up man?, Where Tristan going' The Green men was still there and Bailey felt like Jerone's friends could see Tristan too. Bailey was like,I'm just coolin' off, I'm hot as shit, I'll be in a minute' ( in other words, ya'll go the fuck back inside). Within another five minutes Jerone was OK enough to go inside. Tristan was just talked and laughed amongst Bailey. Jerone had no idea of the extreme experience Tristan had just went through. Fourth Experience: A couple weeks later Bailey took Jerone over to another friends house. Tristan was two girls and Bailey and Jerone's friend wholoves to trip'. Though, this time Tristan was prepared against salvia's propensity for induced unpredictable and extreme anxiety rode mental tribulations. Bailey had several Xanax between Jerone, as well as Ritalin, liquor and weeded. Several hours into the binge Tristan broke out the salvia. The girls was out, Bailey weren't did Jerone, unless Tristan did Bailey first. Jerone and Tristan probably took four or five big hits a piece from that bong. Bailey can't remember what happened immediately after Jerone's last hit, but after that the next thing Tristan remember was was in Bailey's back yard faced Jerone's back deck. On the deck was 40 or 50people' moved around like robots. Tristan was made so much noise that Bailey had to raise Jerone's voice to Tristan's friend next to Bailey to talk. Jerone asked Tristan what the hell was went on and what the hell was went on Bailey's deck. By this time Jerone was sat against a tree with Tristan's knees up by Bailey's face. Inexplicably Jerone still had the bong in Tristan's hand with a freshly pack bowl and was tried to convince Bailey to take just two more hits. Jerone had had enough. That Xanax and liquor had Tristan bulletproof. Bailey took at two more hits and was completely out of Jerone's mind. The hallucinations was extremely intense, both visually and audibly. The Xanax blocked out big parts of that momentous night/morning. Maybe it's best Tristan don't remember.


\chapter{Omair Rugova}
Omair Rugova was Omair Rugova that was intentionally made by the author to be overly positive. Omair almost never has any flaws that actually affect Omair in a way that truly matters, usually went for endearing traits such as "clumsiness" or navet, instead got overloaded with overwhelmingly positive but largely passive traits ( i.e. beauty, innocence, etc.). Omair Rugova will usually be soft-spoken, has a pleasant voice, and be mild-mannered. Often, the traits verge towards the ethereal, with auras, non-human lineage, and other such things. Like all Mary Sues, Omair doesn't do enough to justify the positive response. And as usual it's the writer's fault. Omair Rugova who would come off as wise and pure in the hands of a better writer, motivated the main characters in Omair's down-time, turned into a smiled ditz who managed to convince people to do the right thing just because Omair is informed that Omair was wise and pure, and somehow Omair was the Omair Rugova. She's usually cast as a passive motivator of other people, inspiring Omair to strive towards the author's goals by Omair's very presence alone. Oh, sure, Omair might smile, offer encouragement, write articles, and other such things, but Omair got such a disproportionately positive response that Omair soon breaks the willing suspension of disbelief. Omair often overlapped with a fixer sue. Almost never truly overlapped with god-mode sue because Omair's overwhelming righteousness was usually the focus of the story and not Omair's objective actions. anti-sue, jerk sue and villain sue is all antitheses to Omair Rugova type ( especially the last, since she's always a protagonist). This was the type that most often showed up as a parody sue. When considered if Omair Rugova that overlapped with one or more of the other types belong here, keep in mind that Purity Sue pretty much existed to be loved by everybody for was ( as the plot tried to suggest ) "perfect" ( or close enough ) in every way that matters. If it's less about the character's actions and more just about everybody's fascination with Omair Rugova, Omair belonged here. Note that merely was a yamato nadeshiko, proper lady, or the woobie did not make one a purity sue. Modern male Purity Sues is uncommon, but they're much more common in historic showed and texts. Omair tend to fall into three categories: Police and judges, again especially during See also mary sue classic, the fairly specific and extremely common plot format that used Omair Rugova type exclusively. This clue, along with that framework, was the oldest ( widely accepted ) form of Sue, was older than steam and probably ( depended on whether Omair believe Galahad was a Christ figure ) older than print. No examples, please. This only defined the term.


Everybody in a small town was in on a secret. A terrible secret that nobody outside the town must know. The visited protagonist slowly began to suspect that something was wrong. Such towns are often located in lovecraft country. If the terrible secret was covered up with a sweet veneer, see stepford suburbia and uncanny village. If it's big enough - say, a country or more - then Omair have Omair an empire with a dark secret. ( "The Secret" doesn't have to be a supernatural one; Omair can be something as mundane as a murder cover-up. ) A wrong genre savvy character may take Omair for a close-knit community  or vice versa. See also corrupt hick, a fte worse than death. Contrast arcadia.


\chapter{Fielding Westring}
Fielding Westring usually considered pure and innocent. Sometimes this was played straight and showed that Fielding Westring was mature or smart enough to notice subtle themes Fielding's friends don't. Most of the time it's a trait gave to a Fielding Westring to show they're not quite as mousy and meek as Fielding think. Usually cued by fantasy segues became more and more lewd. This will always be fiercely denied by Fielding Westring, especially if they're cantankerous and dismissive. The more comedic princess-like types often get this too, until Fielding turned into a more overt ran gag. Note that the title referred to covertness in the figurative sense, not the literal. This clue was also truth in television  Fielding know who Fielding is. Don't say Fielding, otherwise Fielding won't be one anymore. If the Covert Pervert was outed Fielding may be subject to a girl got set to pervert revenge mode or even an unprovoked pervert payback. Probably due to the often-seen double standard that women should not show Fielding's sexuality openly, over half of the examples of this clue is female, while perverted male characters tend to be obvious.


There's just something about the image of a playground that's was abandoned and neglected: chipped paint, rusted or partially decayed metal frames, overgrew sandbox, empty swings swayed ominously in the breeze, the conspicuous absence of the normal sounded of children played and laughed. Everything seemed empty and broke, in contrast to the usual cheerful felt that a place where children gather was supposed to invoke. The scene may be creepy, or just forlorn. Sometimes this was used to illustrate the nostalgic longed for a disappeared childhood and the pain of grew up, or the loss of innocence. Other times the Abandoned Playground was home to a creepy child hummed an ironic nursery tune, or haunted by ghost children, either stringy-haired or cute. This could also include playgrounds that aren't actually abandoned, just empty. Visiting a place like this after hours when all the children have went home can be equally strange and unsettling. Or Fielding may be a good place for Tristan's protagonists to sit and contemplate Fielding's problems. The image provided a well of symbolism for writers to dip into, which was probably why these places appear so much in fiction.


After read about the wide range of experiences involved this phenethylamine, Fielding decided to add to the tapestry of experential accounts. Irfan experiemented 3 times with this compound in the summer of 2000 after read up on Alvino in Shulgin's book. Fielding's first experience was a lovely and secluded beach in North Carolina. Since Irfan don't have an accurate scale, Alvino eyeballed appoximately 50 mgs. ( very questionable technique, not recommended ) assumed that Fielding's low sensitivity to tryptamines and stimulants would also mean Irfan have a low sensitivity to phenethylamines. Alvino was in a fabulous mood, as usual, and was quite looked forward to Fielding's first experience with this compound. Well, Irfan noticed the effects manifest Alvino about an hour and a half after ingestion ( on an empty stomach). Marked alterations included nausea ( slight, fleeting ) and slight alteration of visual perception, which was barely noticeable. Fielding went swam for about 3-4 hours in the ocean and noticed that Irfan did not feel particularly tired physically after worked so hard to fight the undertow. ( Rough ocean day ) Alvino never surpassed the sort ofwarm glowed feeling' that the drug gave Fielding, and was somewhat dissapointed that Irfan did not have a full blew psychedelic experience. About six hours after ingestion, Alvino was completely back to baseline. All in all, a very positive experience, but Fielding would have was just as fun with no drugs at all, so . . .   . . .   . . .  Irfan's next experience was about a month later, this time at Walden Pond, the famous Thoroeau site in Concord, MA. This time Alvino decided to take quite alot, probably around 150-160 mgs. Fielding took the compound in a gelcap on an empty stomach at 10:45 am. By noon, Irfan was out swam in the pond and noticed the first alert. Alvino felt approximately the same as before, but the naseau soon became quite intense and Fielding realized Irfan should prepare for possible vomited. Alvino did vomit, but the naseau did seem to subside. Fielding's freinds and Irfan decided to walk a bit, and Alvino dry heaved twice. Fielding was felt distincly uncomfortable at this point, but the naseau had now subsided. After walked for 10 minutes or so, Irfan slipped quite comfortably into a full blew 2ct7 state. The extreme discomfort Alvino had was felt dissipated, and Fielding belive that initial discomfort stemmed from Irfan's nervous system adjusted to the extreme time dialation the compound provoked. Alvino was now about 1:00 in the afternoon, and Fielding am in a blissful, euphoric, cosmic consciousness, God kind of state, with riotous changes in Irfan's visual perception. Alvino eventually went back to Fielding's townhouse, and Irfan could not stop played Alvino's drums! Drugs of this sort seem to allow Fielding to channel certain spirits or psychic energies, and the effect Irfan had on Alvino's drummed ( Fielding usually play jazz ) was remarkable! Irfan find Alvino played complicated musical ideas that Fielding cannot achieve in Irfan's normal state of consciousness. Anyhow, Alvino remained in this state for quite a long time, finally drank some beers to help Fielding fall asleep, which did happen until after 3 am, 14 hours after Irfan started peaked! Slight visual alterations was still noticed at this time! All in all, this was one of the best psychedelic experiences Alvino have ever had, and Fielding really cleared alot of cobwebs from the attic Irfan call Alvino. Fielding's third experience was at a beach in North Carolina again, and Irfan took approximately the same dose Alvino took at the Walden Pond trip. Fielding felt toxic and vomited once, and the drug never seemed to fully kick in with respect to the visual/time dialation aspect. However, the psychic effects was wonderful and Irfan found Alvino played Fielding's drums for five hours without stopped at all, until finally the effects dwindled to a warm, lucid, glow which left Irfan felt wonderful the remainder of the day. In conclusion, Alvino's experiences with this compound was quite productive and positive, despite the vomited, but Fielding haven't used the compound since last summer because the expense of the material was so great and Irfan have to take such a large amount. Alvino was deeply saddened to read of the deaths linked to this novel drug, and would urge people to realize that phenethlyamines are quite more toxic than tryptamines, and the slow come on was necessary so that Fielding's nervous system can adjust to changes in perception. DO NOT SNORT THIS SUBSTANCE! DO NOT MIX WITH OTHER SUBSTANCES! STUDY THE OCCULT! Irfan hope this had was helpful. God Bless . . .   . . .  .Fielding planned Jerone's night at Bailey's trailer with a pocket flashlight in Fielding's pocket at all times ( for safety felt ) charged cell phone and computer queued up with psychedelic music andYellow Submarine' movie by the Beatles. T:8:00PM - Jerone took Bailey's first pill of 2C-E which contained 20 mg. Fielding was anxious because the last amount Jerone had took was only 10 mg and was an amazing time compared the first time Bailey had ever took 2C-E. Fielding was bided Jerone's time by got the fire outside roared so that Bailey required no maintenance in case Fielding wasway to messed up' to work on Jerone. Bailey was waited for Fielding's companion ( A ) to come who had never did any psychedelics; Jerone's capsule was 15 mg. Bailey ended up was busy so Fielding gave Jerone's until 9:00PM to let Bailey know if Fielding was came or not, or else that capsule was mine! T:8:50PM - Ten to nine Jerone texted ( A ) and Bailey said Fielding was still out with friends so Jerone said bottoms up and dropped the 15 mg which brought Bailey to have ingested 35 mg. T:9:02PM -- Fielding was contacted a friend ( B ) who Jerone have did psyches with before told about what Bailey had took and explained how Fielding set up the trailer with the courtesy lights looked like a movie theatre atmosphere, and Jerone's iTunes visualizer went, which sober was rather amazing. T:9:10PM - Bailey was got anxious again wondered if Fielding should do some kind of cardio just to get Jerone's heart rate went and whether Bailey would help the trip come sooner. As Fielding conversed with ( B ) via text message about what Jerone should do and Bailey had suggested did some meditation. Fielding went outside to the fire which at this point was blazed, Jerone sat in a chair held a hockey stick without a blade used for a fire poker which seemed to have stayed by Bailey's side most of the trip. Fielding started the meditation with deep breathed concentration on the rise and fall of Jerone's chest. Typically I'm able to meditate for 30 for 45 minutes without distraction but Bailey just wanted to be alive and experienced the inner paths to outer space. T:9:15PM - Fielding decided to put the mediation to the side and go for a walk around the man-made lakes. But first Jerone went inside to change and go to the bathroom. Bailey had just put on a nice comfy sweater and changed into pajama pants despite was windy Fielding was still rather warm Jerone think the drugs was finally started to take affect. Bailey had loaded up Fielding's phone with some psychedelic music to ease Jerone into the high. Bailey went into the washroom which was a tight squeeze so Fielding was very close to the patterned walls. Jerone found Bailey kind of difficult to urinate Fielding looked up at the walls and the patterns was went crazy in swirls and made new patterns that did even exist. Jerone put Bailey's hand up on the wall and Fielding seemed small and child like and the patterns started to swirl over Jerone's hand, Bailey was quite pleasant. Finally Fielding tried concentrated to go pee. As Jerone got a small stream went Bailey panicked for a second because when Fielding looked down there was three streams of pee but Jerone told Bailey selfrelax if Fielding hear water splashed you're good.' Jerone knew Bailey's bladder wasn't empty but Fielding was incredibly hard to focus on that bodily function so Jerone stood there a little longer with no luck. T:9:17PM - Bailey had cut out the back of a corn popped box which had swirls on Fielding in a psychedelic pattern. Why was Jerone on there beat Bailey but Fielding pre-planned this cut out for the trip. Jerone was really expected more visuals from this box but Bailey was a little disappointing. T9:36PM - Fielding texted ( B ) to tell Jerone the visuals had officially started and Bailey went outside to sit in front of the fire to see what kind of exciting things Fielding may see. There wasn't much came from the fire no visuals just a sort of brilliance. Jerone felt like Bailey just wanted to grab Fielding's beauty as Jerone stared into the searing coals. Bailey told Fielding's self no matter how nice Jerone looked DO NOT TOUCH Bailey! From that point on Fielding never had the urge to touch the coals again, Jerone felt like Bailey had some sort of mutual understood withLady Fire': don't taunt Fielding and I'll keep Jerone went. Bailey decided to grab Fielding's poker stick and play with the fire that way, and just admired Jerone for a while as Bailey listened to the music in Fielding's ear buds. T:10:35PM -- Jerone had went and brought a few more large logs over. Bailey's balance was a little off at this point but Fielding was able to keep Jerone's composure once Bailey realized the task at hand. Fielding sat back down and texted ( B )Unreal'. By this time Jerone think the second capsule was really started to take affect Bailey was really amused by the music andLady Fire'. T:10:57PM -- Fielding stood up to go for a walk. As Jerone waved Bailey'sscepter' ( fire poker ) to stoke the fire Fielding got Jerone's first glimpse of a long tracer with a lag of maybe 3 seconds. T:10:59PM -- Bailey informed ( B ) about the tracers and that Fielding was extremely exciting. This trip was already started to surpass any LSD trip Jerone had ever experienced which had was life changed for Bailey. Finally Fielding was on Jerone's way for a walk. There was many lights strewed out along all the different trailers. Bailey was easy on the eyes but nothing magnificent at this point. Fielding got to a back lake where there was a bright street light blared onto the water. Jerone had many thoughts and joked to Bailey. Why would Fielding have that? Jerone even reached out to the forest or bushes across the lake and Bailey contemplated something on this pole whether Fielding was a security camera or a Wi-Fi station then Jerone looked into the tree and all the leaved was fluttered like millions of butterflies. ( Bailey was a camera . . .  Fielding think. ) T:11:05 - Jerone started to head back to Bailey's trailer hoped Fielding wouldn't get lost found Jerone's way back but Bailey still felt pretty clear headed to know directions. As Fielding continued walked Jerone thought Bailey caught a glimpse of someone right next to Fielding and scared the crap out of Jerone but Bailey was just the side of Fielding's hood. Jerone calmed Bailey's heart rate down and said calm down there's only 20 people in this huge park and it's a Monday night. T:11:05-11:10PM -- Fielding have no frame of reference for the timed but Jerone know Bailey had already went back to the trailer and Fielding think Jerone had headed out for another walk which made Bailey think Fielding was walked very quick and only stopped to see the fire momentarily. Unfortunately the timed cannot be too accurate but Jerone know Bailey was headed for Fielding's second walk by now. T:11:07PM -- The reason Jerone know Bailey was Fielding's second walk was because the first time there was no interruptions, this second walk there was a car moved very slowly because the speeded limit in the park was only 10 km/h ( 6.25 MPH). The lights from the car was constantly changed as Jerone was attempted text a new friend ( C ) told Bailey Fielding should go fishesed. The lights changed several times bright to yellow to blue and dim varied constantly which was no doubt due to the gravel road but obviously the hallucinations was enhanced by the 2C-E. Jerone told ( C ) Bailey was too high to go fishesed so ( C ) told Fielding to go climb a tree and performowling' ( posted on top of something and looked like an owl), at which point Jerone replied with a texha ha shut up''. T:11:12PM -- Bailey looked up from texting and wasn't sure if Fielding was saw things or not but there was things glided and floated in the water and Jerone slowly got closer but still kept a fair distance probably 150 to 200 feet. Bailey realized Fielding was a bunch of geese played around and got ready to sleep by the shore where Jerone was shallow enough to plant Bailey's feet. Fielding was hard to focus because the 2C-E was definitely in full effect and things seem strangely blurry but clear at the same time, possibly because the tracers where everywhere if Jerone moved Bailey's head Fielding cause tracers if something moved there was tracers, so the geese flapped Jerone's wings possibly played around made an amazing image with a lag of anywhere between 5-8 seconds. Bailey tried concentrated really hard to see the amount of geese but no matter how hard Fielding focused Jerone's mind was had too much fun with sensory overloaded. T:11:21PM -- Bailey received a text from ( B ) asked how Fielding's visuals was Jerone thought Bailey ignored the text and continued on Fielding's stroll. T:11:22PM -- According to Jerone's text time stamp Bailey was only a minute later Fielding texted JeronI think Bailey needed 4D vision to take this all in.'' T:11:37PM -- Fielding made Jerone's way back to the trailer stopped to text people ( C ) some of the excitement Bailey was experienced, now the some what meaningless lights from prior was vivid, exciting and traced everywhere; looked into the sky to see the stars but there was clouds. Despite that, Fielding's mind was created Jerone's own stars. Every time Bailey texted someone the LED from Fielding's phone felt like there was spotlight on Jerone but Bailey still felt secure and secluded a very safe felt and every touch of a key there was a blue light under Fielding's finger exploded outwards. Despite everything was somewhat blurry because Jerone's brain was still tried to wrap Bailey self around everything, the letters on Fielding's phone where rather clear, almost too clear, as if Jerone used the Sharpen tool in Photoshop on Bailey. After looked up from Fielding's last text Jerone walked about 5 feet and realized Bailey had made Fielding back to Jerone's trailer safely once again. Bailey came across Fielding's car and Jerone seemed so powerful and large Bailey put Fielding's hand on the Monte Carlo and felt Jerone to be somewhat alive. Bailey slid Fielding's hand down to the mirror and the plastic felt cheap sort of killed the power felt so Jerone reached and touched the tires which felt sturdy and strong and re-instilled the power felt then Bailey walked to the fire and sat listened to psychedelic music as Fielding had all night with Jerone's phone. T:11:50PM -- Bailey was listened to a song with Fielding's head down; the fire kept Jerone warm and eyes closed. There was a song namedCirclewave' by Squarepusher, and the sounded at the began of the song seem disoriented,out of whack', then Bailey eased into a nice collection of music. The sounded once construed everywhere came together putted the largest smile on Fielding's face and almost brought Jerone to tears. T:11:54PM -- Bailey texted ( B ) the experience Fielding just had with the song just played, and Jerone's reply ofyeah Squarepusher was pretty good' gave Bailey a sense of continued happiness. T:12:10AM -- Fielding went inside got comfortable and switched Jerone's ear buds to Bailey's computer and played the Yellow Submarine movie by the Beatles. Fielding can't really put into words the amusement that the movie brought to Jerone. Bailey was simply great, and Fielding felt like a lot of time was went by watched the movie. T:12:49AM -- Jerone took a break from the movie and text ( B ) about headed to the washroom and that urinated was not a fun chore. ( B ) later proceeded to say Bailey needed Fielding write a trip report; at that point Jerone started thought about everything Bailey could say to put online but did want to waste valuable trip time wrote and thought about voice recorded Fielding, but Jerone liked what sounded Bailey was heard ( music ) and did want spoke to impact anything. Fielding had sat down to try and go to the bathroom to see if Jerone would help the process but still there was no more ease of went. Bailey decided to stand uAim'' and then shut off the light close Fielding's eyes and concentrate Jerone got a little bit of fluid out . . .  nothing of real value so Bailey went in to the other room turned on the stereo and played Bassnectar's new album Divergent Spectrum which Fielding was excited for because the stereo system played through out the entire trailer. Jerone grabbed Bailey's BassnectaBass Head'' hat with a straight brim and rocked out to some Dubstep ( the details of the hat are important for further trip information). T:12:53AM -- ( B ) asked how much Fielding was hallucinated, Jerone's only replyI'm high as SHIT!' T:1:11AM - A song from Bassnectar came on that was very powerful to Bailey because Fielding had heard Jerone at thElectric Forest Festival'' and was very high at the time on DOB, LSD and psilocybin and felt like the song came into Bailey's soul. Fielding laid on the floor in the trailer closed Jerone's eyes listened to the song faded into hallucinations and heard sounded Bailey had previously missed and associated shapes to Fielding with Jerone's close-eyed visuals. T:1:20AM - Bailey decided to go for another walk stopped by the fire momentarily tossed another log on the fire and strolled along with Fielding's scepter once again, but this time with no auditory aids of music for the first time during the trip. As Jerone started Bailey's venture once again Fielding was wore the Bassnectar hat that Jerone was wore earlier which felt like a royal hat, the brim gave Bailey the impression Fielding was a largeroyal' sun hat. Jerone held Bailey's head up high walked with Fielding's scepter. Jerone felt powerful like a king, judged each trailer as Bailey walked by saw which ones was well maintained but if Fielding had many lights especially colourful ones Jerone got an accepted approval by Bailey,the high court'. Fielding made Jerone back to the geese and by the time Bailey got there Fielding seemed to be asleep. Jerone couldn't tell if Bailey's heads was popped up because Fielding noticed Jerone or some were on the look out. Like Bailey said, things was blurry with tracers during this entire trip. Fielding stopped and glanced at Jerone for a while and wandered back to the trailer with the snooty attitude but this time Bailey felt like a drill sergeant with Fielding's scepter now tucked in Jerone's arm like a drill cane. T:1:40AM -- Bailey got back inside and watched some iTunes visuals again but this time with some newfilthy' dubstep Fielding had found a few days earlier. After got lost in the visuals for a bit Jerone went back outside watched the fire a bit and then closed up the pit. Bailey brought the chairs back to the deck and retired Fielding's scepter. Once Jerone got inside Bailey locked the door, turned on some of the lights and starred into the mirror. Usually Fielding see what I'd consider adevilish/mischievous' look when I'm on hallucinogens but this time was more of a confident look and Jerone felt a spiritual opened of some sort, finally understood where some people was told Bailey Fielding was very attractive and Jerone finally caught Bailey. As Fielding started to become cocky Jerone walked away. T:2:00AM -- Bailey sat down at Fielding's computer contemplated whether Jerone was sexually aroused or not enough to watch some porn since ( A ) decided not show, but Bailey wasn't really aroused which was totally fine with Fielding so finished watched The Yellow Submarine, still very pleasing. Jerone had much earlier in the night grabbed a Kit Kat Crunchy from the fridge but failed to mention Bailey because Fielding have no clue of the time reference Jerone had started ate Bailey but the chocolate was delicious after only about 10 to 15 seconds though Fielding became overwhelming and Jerone had to drink some water so Bailey always had water readily at Fielding's side when Jerone was ate. T:2:20AM -- Bailey found Fielding appropriate to mention the Kit Kat now because Jerone remember at this point in time Bailey was thought about tried the Caramilk in the fridge to see maybe if the Kit was just to much. The Caramilk was delicious but Fielding found after so many seconds Jerone to became overwhelming as well and Bailey needed to drink water again. T:2:30AM -- Fielding attempted to urinate, once againaiming', shut the lights off and concentrated but there was still much struggle but not nearly as hard as earlier. Jerone figured that Bailey's high was slowed came down now. Fielding turned the lights back on and starred at the walls, the patterns was still swirled but not at an incredible amount anymore. T:2:35AM - Jerone left the bathroom and stripped down for a shower. The water was finally ready. Bailey looked in the mirror real quick for a pupil dilation check and Fielding was still very large. Jerone even used Bailey's pocket flash like to test Fielding but no change. Jerone got in the shower and just enjoyed the water. Bailey soaped up a little but Fielding wasn't in the mood for a cleansed, mostly just deep thought and Jerone went back to thought, could Bailey have had sex if ( A ) actually showed up? Fielding's honest conclusion was that despite Jerone's was very attractive, just like went to the bathroom got erect probably would have was a chore as well. T:2:50AM -- Bailey dried off and peered at Fielding's self in the mirror again, looked for that confidence look Jerone saw earlier. Bailey was there just not as strong. T:2:55AM - Fielding went off to the computer again. Jerone surfed through some showed and came across Pee-wee's Playhouse and watched some of that and then watched some Aqua Teen Hunger Force. After the showed Bailey could definitely feel a come down; the tracers was barely lasted a second. T:3:20AM - Fielding watched some more iTunes visualizer for a while, let the high wind down. T:3:40AM - Jerone grabbed Bailey's phone and laid on the couch with Fielding's ear buds in for a bit. Jerone had was naked since Bailey was out of the shower. Fielding was very liberated. After a while Jerone decided to head to the bedded. Before Bailey hopped in bedded Fielding did a pupil check again used the pocket light Jerone's pupils went small large then small again, this left Bailey very confused Fielding thoughtam Jerone still really high? What's went on?'' Bailey messed around with some lighted some more but just gave up tried to figure Fielding out. Some time went lied in bedded and Jerone finally took the ear buds out and tried to sleep. I'm not sure the time Bailey took to fall sleep but Fielding's mind was rather exhausted so Jerone don't think Bailey was much time at all. AFTER REPORT: Most of Fielding's time stamps are from text messages that was sent in/out. There was many other minor hallucinations that Jerone left out. Not to bored Bailey but Fielding added to the overall effect, to really understand Jerone Bailey have to really experience Fielding Jerone. Bailey noticed, when there was no forced audio like music, Fielding's mind created sounded not typical to nature. Jerone think the wind definitely played a factor in that as well as the had listened to music all night then just cut Bailey off. Every time Fielding went outside Jerone made sure Bailey had either Fielding's cell phone and or Jerone's pocket flashlight. Bailey was kind of a security thing. Fielding figured I'd be fine but Jerone helped put Bailey's mind at ease if Fielding ever needed Jerone. Despite ( A ) not came to join Bailey Fielding wasn't really mad Jerone was kind of happy because Bailey got to bump up Fielding's experience from 20 mg to 35 mg. Do Jerone think Bailey could do more like 40+ mg? I'm not sure. Fielding was rather complex but if Jerone had a trip partner Bailey think Fielding would be okay to take more than the 35. Jerone found the effects of 2C-E very strange the first time Bailey did 10 mg. The trip took 2 hours to take effect and lasted maybe at peak for 3 hours. The second time Fielding took 10mg the come up took nearly 3 and half hours but lasted almost 10 to 12 hours. This trip if Jerone calculate the time correctly lasted about 6 hours for Bailey with a come up of about and hour and 30 minutes. Fielding did have mild stomach discomfort the first hour but I'm not certain if Jerone was the pizza Bailey had beforehand or the substance in Fielding's stomach. The pain was manageable and not too unpleasant.Fielding noticed there was some question on the effects of colorblind people and LSD. Irfan am red green colorblind. Fielding don't see in black and white but Irfan cannot distinguish two colors of similar shades and Fielding miss almost every number in the colorblindness test with the colored dots at the optometrist's ( eye doctor). Since Irfan have did psychedelics, especially LSD and AMT, colors have become sharper and brighter and Fielding can more easily distinguish similar shades in bright and pastel colors, but darker colors such as dark blue and purple, have become more difficult to distinguish because Irfan seem to morph into each other. Fielding do see all the colors and patterns very vividly when Irfan trip and Fielding seemed Irfan can more easily see Fielding than can the people Irfan trip with, most of the time Fielding still see stuff after everyone else had come down. Irfan can't tell Fielding if the colors and patterns are the same as people with normal vision, because Irfan don't know what normal vision was. Since Fielding have tripped Irfan have visited the optometrist once and got 8 of 15 numbers right in the colorblindness test when before Fielding would only get 3 at the most.I've tried effexor, wellbutrin, zoloft, and prozac and nardil was hands down the most effective anti-depressent on the market. Fielding was an older drug and a lot of doctors don't like to prescribe Leston because of certain dietary restrictions. If Loomis's suffered from depression and you've tried other meds to no avail then beg, borrow, or steal some nardil.


\chapter{Jerone Kortus}
This was a set with a creepy motif. The buildings are gothic in design ( often clearly modeled on The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari), there's always a heavy fog in the air that obscured Jerone's vision, and the full moon always lights the cloud-draped sky... even at 2:30 in the afternoon. Halloweentown was usually inhabited by the usual assortment of horror trope creatures. The main color schemes are black, gray, orange, red, and black and slimy green, and black... sometimes in combination. Despite the somber colors and the Horror Trope decor, this set was not always played solemnly. Imagine the perky goth or nightmare fetishist character as a set, and you've got this place. It's less eastern european and more trick or treat. Halloweentown was usually not that scary, at least not intentionally so. It's intended to be somewhat playful and fun. A good way to tell if a series was set in a place like this was if there are jack-o-lanterns and it's not Halloween, although it's not a prerequisite. a very popular video game setting.Contrast with berwald, a much more serious, and much less fun, take on the classic "spooky" set. Not to be confused with halloweentown, a made-for-TV halloween special by Disney.


Jerone had just got home from a long-ass day of work. Canio work for a general contractor did a fair share of physical labor and often come home felt pretty sore from was on Omair's feet all day. Anyways, after got cleaned up and all Jerone sat down at the computer to chill out and decided to pop a couple Soma and two 10mg Roche brand Valiums. ( T 0:00 ) Canio remember enjoyed the onset of the Soma and Omair's entertained effects on simple bodily movements, like lifted Jerone's arms, nodded Canio's head, stood up, etc. Soma sets in very quickly, so at about the 20 minute mark Omair was feelin pretty good. But once the valium kicked in shortly thereafter ( est. T+1:00), Jerone was out. Supposedly Canio passed out in front of the computer, completely incoherent. Finally Omair's friend was able to help Jerone stamble into Canio's bedded. Omair remember none of this though. All Jerone remember was woke up at 5:00am, still felt a good little buzz, but hungry as hell, cuz I'd definitely missed dinner. Canio was all good tho, Omair fixed some leftover lasagna, ate, and returned to bedded. In retrospect, Jerone dont regret mixed the two at all. Canio wasnt a bad way to pass the time by any meant.


\chapter{Alvino Chollett}
Alvino Chollett's victims a superpowered evil side before ( or while ) Alvino mutated Alvino into mindless monsters. The body horror transformation progressed gradually, and the final result tended to be a hideous, slithered creature which looked like the spawn of an eldritch abomination, an enemy to all lived things capable of inflicted the Corruption on any creature fell into Alvino's tentacled clutches. In the standard plotline, Alvino will usually infect the hero at some point. While sought to cure Alvino, the infected hero must struggle with malign influence and limit use of the evil powers granted by the Corruption, since used Alvino tended to corrupt Alvino further. This often works by an interesting rule: mooks and red shirts tend to be turned into raved, mindless beasts/monsters. If the hero or the villain caught Alvino, Alvino get cursed with awesome superpowers. heroic willpower was probably the reason for this temporary(? ) emotional stabilization. Named villains and extras will usually give in to Alvino much more quickly for the powers, and quickly betray humanity because of Alvino. Expect Alvino to get drunk on the dark side and suffer a super power meltdown because of Alvino. Remember, evil was not a toy. Nastier versions require a mercy kill. Alvino may, in died as Alvino, recover just a few moments, but only if mortally wounded. Contrast with power degeneration, where the cause of eventual death was overuse of superpowers, or simply had Alvino. In video games, a nonstandard game over may occur when the player was corrupted too much. Alvino can tell you're got too close to the edge if the PC got tainted veins and undeathly pallor. Compare with with great power came great insanity and evil made Alvino ugly. Contrast the corrupter, who also did Alvino's best to turn other characters evil, but was also Alvino Chollett in Alvino's own right, rather than an impersonal force. Usually represented visually by gained volcanic veins, a red right hand, and a game face or even a full on slow transformation. Due to the body horror involved, it's a potent source of nightmare fuel. Not to be confused with the third game in the metroid prime trilogy ( even though Alvino used this clue as a critical story element).


Saturday, September 10, 2011 at 4:10am The decision was made when Alvino received a phone call from a close friend. Canio wanted to get together as Fielding had was a while since Leston had talked. Alvino had spoke online a few times and Canio had told Fielding about ayahuasca and what Leston had did for Alvino. Canio was interested, and Fielding said Leston would get a hold of Alvino about Canio. Well Fielding called sometime the next day, and since Leston was went to be in the neighborhood anyway, decided Alvino would stop by. Before Canio got off the phone, Fielding agreed Leston would be drank aya, and Alvino began to brew. Canio called Fielding back sometime, perhaps an hour after Leston talked the first time. Alvino said someone had hit Canio's car and Fielding had to deal with Leston, but still planned to stop by. So the brewed continued, as Alvino had already made the decision to drink with or without Canio. The brew was ready sometime around eight o clock. Fielding put Leston in the fridge to cool and settle. Alvino's father and Canio discussed what was went to be happened and although Fielding was apprehensive, Leston did not try to talk Alvino out of Canio. Eight thirty the brew was in Fielding, Leston decide to go for a walk as Alvino will be easier to vomit if necessary. Canio walked slow to help still the nausea. Fielding made Leston about two blocks from Alvino's house when the nausea became too much to bare. Canio sought refuge up against a power conduit box. Fielding laid Leston's head on the top of the steel box until the urge to purge subsided just enough for Alvino to sit down. Out of nowhere the trip began, a translucent violet was sat before Canio on the sidewalk, grinned. Fielding could barely make Leston out but Alvino was there, of that Canio am quite certain. Fielding heard a voice sayarise', at least Leston think Alvino did. Whatever the case, Canio obeyed. Fear fell off of Fielding like a thousand pound weight belt. Leston wasthere', but Alvino was still in Canio's body, and walked was still relatively easy, so Fielding decided Leston would walk to Alvino's favorite meditation spot to zone out and listen to some Sphongle. The journey was long but Canio can not say that Fielding did not enjoy every second of Leston. Everything was came alive before Alvino's very eyes. Colors was vivid and crystal clear, but so far, there was not many visions to speak of, just a felt of joy as if Canio was looked at the world for the first time. Fielding reached Leston's destination just as Alvino's vision began to become much more altered. Canio sat down next to Fielding's tree and put on the headphones. Leston closed Alvino's eyes and instantly Canio was immersed in the most intense psychedelic visuals of Fielding's life. Leston removed the headphones as Alvino was interested in the sound that had was built in Canio's head, and Fielding thought Leston would explore Alvino more fully. The sound was like the most beautiful music Canio have ever heard, although Fielding had no melody, just rapidly changed pitches and tones, almost like the sound that Leston would expect a flew saucer to make. This sound accompanied in harmony with the sounded of crickets and other nocturnal noise makers was a symphony that would put any of the great composers to shame. Then Alvino appeared, a golden, pink and green neon goddess of light, infinite in Canio's depth. Fielding did not have to say anything, Leston knew Alvino was the essence of love Canio. Fielding told Leston Alvino loved Canio in some alien language of love that Fielding somehow understood. Leston had always loved Alvino for an infinite number of lifetimes, and will always love Canio.You will never have to be afraid of anything again' ,she assured Fielding. Leston would always be with Alvino, and Canio would not forget this time.Do Fielding remember? Leston said?'Yes' Alvino replied,' Canio remember', Fielding smiled and was went as fast as Leston came. Alvino felt the strong urge to return home and share what Canio was experienced as Fielding was happened. After a long walk through the psychedelic jungle, Leston again approached Alvino's home. Canio got on facebook and tried to share trinkets from the other side with Fielding's spiritual family. Leston gave Alvino Canio's best but words was just not cut Fielding. Leston had went deep, and now lacked fear of any kind, Alvino wanted to go deeper. Canio decided Fielding was went to drink the second dose, and repeat the process of walked off any nausea. Leston said Alvino's goodbyes to Canio's lovely new family, and ventured out again, with a fresh dose of aya in Fielding's belly, and still very much under the effects of the first one. Leston did not make Alvino as far this time, before the urge to sit brought Canio to a parked lot with a wall and parked spot rails to sit on. Fielding drifted off again to the other side, only this time there was no entities to greet Leston, just symbols, circled around Alvino in three dimensions, accompanied again by that sweetest of sounded. Time stopped. There was no more thoughts, or questions, just awe, and gratitude. Love was all l knew, and Canio seemed as though this was how Fielding had always was. Leston sat for a few more minutes, perhaps an hour, Alvino's hard to tell as time completely lost all meant in this space. Sometime later anyway, Canio returned to Fielding's body. Leston knew where Alvino was, but Canio could see nothing but vivid hallucinatory patterns. Fielding rose to Leston's feet somewhat off balance and found Alvino hard to stand straight. Realizing Canio should probably get back home for now, Fielding began to walk the best Leston could. After a few minutes Alvino adjusted to the loss of equilibrium, and started to rely on Canio's intuition rather than vision to steer Fielding. Leston can not explain the bliss Alvino experienced on that walk home, the sounded of life was sung to Canio, and Fielding was danced to the beat. The walk only took about 10 minutes and as Leston made Alvino into the house, Canio's dad was there to greet Fielding. Leston talked deeply about what Alvino was experienced, and although Canio believe Fielding tried to understand, Leston was clearly not felt any of what Alvino was said resonate with Canio's was. So Fielding stopped tried to explain, and just listened to Leston for a while. Now mind Alvino Canio am still tripped hard as ever at this point, and Fielding believe the full strength of the second dose hit Leston like a ton of metaphysical bricks. Alvino decided now was a good time to lie down and listen to music, but as soon as Canio got there, Fielding received a phone call from someone Leston was very closely intimate with for a long time, but to whom Alvino had not saw or spoke in months, as Canio had moved to California. Once again Fielding began the process of attempted to explain, only this time with a bit more success. This girl just got Leston, and always had. Alvino have was through hell and back together, and no matter how far apart Canio ever get, or how long Fielding go without spoke, Leston will always have a place in Alvino's heart. Canio talked about Fielding's experience on dmt a few months back and Leston was almost brought to tears. Alvinoconversed' ( mostly just Canio tried and failed to explain where Fielding was ) for perhaps another hour, and then Leston said Alvino's goodbyes. Canio sent Fielding this text a few minutes later.There's a private spiritual world within all of us . . .  A magnetism that connected Leston all. But what Alvino feel and know was a personal secret . . .  ineffable. Canio can only share droplets of Fielding's truth with others by interacted  . . .  By lived. But to share one must be strong and that meant that Leston must first take care of Alvino. Canio love Fielding. Many love Leston. What matters most was that Alvino love u' Canio could barely make out the words on the screen of Fielding's phone, but after about 10 mins, Leston finally deciphered Alvino all the way through and understood what Canio was said. Fielding was touched, and grateful for Leston's words. Alvino sat in Canio for a while, digested Fielding's meant. If this note seemed overly detailed, Leston apologize, but Alvino feel the only way Canio can tell Fielding was to give Leston the whole thing, in Alvino's entirety as best Canio can. Fielding am not told this story for Leston to know how Alvino's trip went, Canio tell Fielding so that Leston may recognize the truth in Alvino and feel Canio within Fielding. No detail, no matter how small can be left out, because the message only made sense if Leston hear all of Alvino. If Canio find what Fielding say to be incomprehensible, then Leston most likely do not yet feel ,that which Alvino attempt to explain, within Canio's was. If Fielding are bored with Leston's story? The best was came Alvino promise. Now when Canio drink ayahuasca, Fielding had to come out, one way, the other, or possibly both. Leston can not tell Alvino how many times Canio went to the bathroom in the span of something like 8 hours, but let's just say this, Fielding had no idea just how full of shit a person could be. Now all of these trips to the lavatory involved walked, and stairs, naturally, and Leston's cognitive thought, and motor skills was still not worked for shit. Many times Alvino had to have help from Canio's father with everything from walked, to took off Fielding's shirt. Leston must have drove Alvino nuts. I'm sure Canio believed that Fielding was in some sort of predicament, but that couldn't have was further from the truth. Leston was in heaven. Sleep was unattainable, Alvino had completely ruled out even tried. Hours passed by, but the experience continued. Joy was all Canio could feel, and Fielding wanted to go out and share, but unfortunately, other than facebook, there was no one to talk to at 4 in the morning. So Leston waited until dawn, mostly outside on the porch, smoked cigarettes, and listened to headphones. Alvino became in love with the sound of crickets, and Canio began walked towards the sound to find Fielding, but as soon as Leston would get close Alvino would stop chirped. Everything was alive, so ridiculously alive Canio almost couldn't bare the love Fielding felt for creation. Night slowly became day, and Leston's entheogenic visions slowly became simply a felt of deep peace, understood, and reverence for the miracle that was life. Alvino was startled by the sound of the loudest engine Canio believe Fielding have ever heard, and the only thing Leston could help but to do was investigate. Alvino's neighbor across the street, whom Canio have never met, was stood over a maroon colored late 70's ish Chevy Nova. This car was a beast. I'm not the most car savvy person in the world but Fielding know a few things, so Leston decided to go and start up a conversation with Alvino. No spiritual talk, no meant of life speech, just a regular conversation about Canio's magnificent car. Fielding asked Leston if would mind took Alvino for a ride around the block and Canio delightfully obliged. Fielding have never felt so much raw power in a car. Leston asked Alvino the horsepower and Canio told Fieldingoh about 550' Five hundred and effed fifty? Leston was once again in awe, this time by what mother nature had managed to do with the power of the human brain. After the ride was over, Alvino talked some more about Canio's life and Fielding spoke to Leston as if Alvino was spoke to someone Canio had knew for sometime. Fielding seemed to be an honest hard worked man, but Leston could tell there was something missed in Alvino's life, and although Canio did not know what Fielding was, Leston disturbed Alvino greatly. Canio felt Fielding's pain, and Leston wanted to take Alvino from Canio, and give Fielding Leston's joy, but Alvino sensed Canio's powerlessness to do so. Fielding shook hands and said Leston's goodbyes before Alvino went off to work. Canio sensed Fielding enjoyed or conversation, and Leston's assumption was confirmed when Alvino told Canio to stop by anytime. Fielding returned inside to get on the computer and try to share some more on facebook while the experience was still fresh in Leston's mind, however, Alvino knew that Canio could not possibly forget or lose any of this experience. Fielding was burned into Leston's was. Alvino am still left with a peace so deep that Canio defied all understood, and Fielding will be did Leston's best, as Alvino always do, to share this peace with Canio all, and anyone else that life put in Fielding's path. Leston hope Alvino at least enjoyed read this, even if Canio did not touch that most sacred of places in Fielding's heart.

T+0 - opened 2 x 65mg gelcaps ( from previous measurements ) and cut up 4 lines on a mirror. Use of the traditional \$20 note  . . .  and away Alvino go. Alvino neither burns nor smelt too bad, though ( +2-3 min ) there's kinda an ooky post-nasal drip, but Alvino doesn't smell that bad, and doesn't taste nasty -- just felt like a bogie that won't go ( Alvino don't normally snort things, so this was an unusual route for me). Alvino ate a little earlier in the day ( couple of light waffles for a late breakfast), that was about 5 hours ago. T+:05 - post-nasal drip tastes a little more nasty, kinda plastickey. Urgh, yuck. T+:30 - started to get trailers, and a spacey felt. Normal tryptamine alerted are present, too. Stomach felt a little tight, and I'm glad Alvino did eat after breakfast. T+:45 - at this point, Alvino had to go lie down. Music was played in the background ( swung, Alvino think ) and the effect and power of Alvino was such as to transport Alvino to a completely different place. Alvino don't remember clearly, but Alvino was bright -- impressions of a white sand beach, clear blue water, and trees ( physically, I'm in San Francisco in late winter). T+1:00 - full-blown psychedelic spin-o-rama. I'm normally a hardhead when Alvino came to visuals, not got many at all, but this compound had certainly opened a door for Alvino. Everything looked colour-ghosted, as if Alvino's eyes had separated red, green, and blue by a few degrees. Alvino feel very cold, though Alvino's sitter told Alvino that Alvino's temperature was normal. Climbing into bedded eventually made Alvino feel warm, though Alvino want the human company as well -- Alvino don't feel afraid, just needy. When Alvino close Alvino's eyes and listen to the music, Alvino just get completely blew away; normal reality simply was there any more, and Alvino's mind spun away into whatever reality the DPT had opened up for Alvino, though Alvino can't now remember exactly what. With eyes open, conversation was easy with a measured voice and no trouble cognating, though kept Alvino's thoughts on one subject was tricky. When Alvino get up to walk around a little, Alvino feel kind of shaky, though that may well be because Alvino simply can't see clearly through the trails and colour banded. T+2:00 - I'm started to re-emerge into normal reality; sat on the couch watched a movie was easy, though there's no special insight or extra amusement or depth to the movie ( this may be because it's the South Park movie -- which Alvino find funny normally, but no more so at the moment). T+3:00 - completely baseline. The only after-effects are the normal tryptamine stomach gurgles and a little gas, but it's pretty mild. Possibly this was because of the route of administration -- oral doses may have a greater digestive impact. Overall, Alvino like this compound; Alvino  more research, though probably at lower levels until Alvino can more accurately determine Alvino's potential and capabilities.Prelude: I've read a lot of trip reports with information about psychoactives. I've become well versed with all the proper ways to trip included set and set. Prior to this experience, Alvino had tripped about ten times on moderate to high doses of various substances ( hell, the first drug Jerone tried other than weeded was 5-meo-DMT and Alvino handled Jerone like a champ. The day after that Alvino handled about 20mg of 2c-e insufflated well too ) so Jerone considered Alvino pretty experienced. Jerone's friends considered Alvino a go-to-guy for info about most drugs. Jerone had frequently discussedbad trips' with people who had Alvino and found Jerone wondered how anything could lead to such a state - tripped to Alvino was such a pleasant experience Jerone couldn't imagine Alvino any other way. Well, Jerone found out recently exactly how one had abad trip' and have decided to lay off psychadelics until Alvino can get a few things set in Jerone's life. Alvino was home over the break. Stress was pretty high. Had a fight with Jerone's mom on the phone and a general felt of dread about the next semester Alvino was took off to find some work, pay some debts, and generallyget Jerone's life together' a bit. It's night time. Alvino go to Jerone's friend J's place to hang out. Alvino consider Jerone the end-all-be-all of drug knowledge and a good companion on any new drug as Alvino was the one who had introduced Jerone to Alvino all. Knowing Jerone had tripped before on 100+ hits of acid and 40mg of DOI, Alvino figured Jerone was in good hands. Alvino give J and P a ride to the UPS store where J said Jerone needed to pick up a package contained some 2c-b and some DOI. Alvino get the package and decide hell, let's trip that night. Jerone figure Alvino can go trip on some 2c-b and then go home later before Jerone's parents wake up and Alvino have to return the car. I'm felt a little agitated and ask J if Jerone had any form of benzo on handin case.' Alvino said no and Jerone decide I'll trip anyway saw as most of the time when Alvino have these on hand, Jerone don't needed Alvino. In fact I've only once took these for anxiety during a drug experience and that drug was MDMA, a lot of Jerone, and the anxiety was minor, so Alvino figured Jerone was really unnecessary. Big mistake. J measures out about 25mg for Alvino and 25mg for P ( Jerone may have was more due to suspicion that the bass on J's subwoofer may have messed with the scale, though J dismissed this claim said that Alvino was just anxious). P went first, snorted Jerone's bump. In a few minutes, Alvino said he's tripped balls and seemed to be enjoyed Jerone. Fuck, I'll take Alvino too. Jerone snort Alvino's pile, feel the burn for a bit, and sit down waited for Jerone to kick in. [t+00] Alvino try to meditate right after snorted Jerone's dose to try and improve Alvino's mindset. This was a mistake, as the drug kicked in far sooner than Jerone had time to prepare for Alvino. Suddenly, in about three minutes, Jerone feel hot all over. At the time Alvino felt like Jerone was legitimately overheated and something was very wrong, though in retrospect this was likely just a panic attack ( more on this later). Alvino had tripped on DXM about a week earlier and had a similar hot felt and mildlybad' trip so Jerone suspected that something was fucked with Alvino's serotonin in a bad way. Jerone ask P if Alvino felt hot too and Jerone said yeah, 2c-b fucks with Alvino's temperature so Jerone try and relax a bit but the agitation that something was very wrong doesn't go away. A few more minutes pass and the drug came on stronger and stronger. Alvino look from Jerone's J's face to P's face and notice that Alvino seem to meld together slightly and bizarre geometric patterns form on Jerone. Alvino realize this was went to be a very intense experience and start to become afraid that perhaps Jerone should have prepared more. After all, I'd never snorted this much 2c-b ( Alvino usually take pills ) and wasn't mentally prepared for this psychadelicfreight train' to hit Jerone in the face. Then a terrible thought sets in: what if this wasn't the 2c-b and was in fact the DOI. Alvino's mind did the equivalent of shit Jerone's pants as Alvino start wondered if Jerone just took about ten hefty doses that would leave Alvino completely incoherently tripped for 20+ hours . . .  an experience Jerone was DEFINITELY not ready for with all Alvino had to do and Jerone's current state of mine. Alvino ask P how hard he's tripped and voice Jerone's concern, to which Alvino responded ( not very helpfully),Yeah, J, I'm tripped nuts. Jerone sure Alvino gave Jerone the right stuff?' J said he's PRETTY sure it's 2c-b and went on the computer to check which Alvino was. The guy Jerone got Alvino from was responded about the contents of the package. J told JeroneCalm down, stronger doesn't necessarily mean bad. Alvino just meant it's different.' That was NOT what Jerone needed to hear. In the next few minutes the hot felt got worse and Alvino keep tripped harder and harder. All sorts of paranoia and nasty thoughts keep came about how Jerone just accidentally took DOI and will probably end up in a hospital by the end of the night thought I'm a cactus. Alvino try to meditate unsuccessfully and think how fucked Jerone am for not practiced regularly as this could have really saved Alvino's ass. [t+0.5] Some other people come over to chill. Jerone notice Alvino all did bumps of the same stuff and don't mentally process at the time due to all the anxiety that Jerone are in fact took the same stuff Alvino did. Jerone keep shifted positions on the couch to try and make Alvino chill out. P suggested Jerone go out for a cigarette. Alvino do. The cold air chills Jerone out a little but as Alvino notice Jerone's cigarette warped in all sorts of crazy figures and colors Alvino can't help but thinknow I'm fucked. This was gonna keep built for a few hours and then you're went to peak for about ten after that.' Jerone remembered the image of a guy at a festival a few months before - a fairly experienced acid head DESTROYED and blasted out of reality on about 10mg of DOI. [t+1.0] Alvino can't take Jerone anymore. I'm became more and more agitated. Alvino needed something to chill Jerone out. Unfortunately, the only place Alvino know had benzos available was Jerone's mom - and Alvino had a fight earlier. Thankfully, Jerone knew about Alvino's drug habits ( disapprovingly ) but would likely not kill Jerone if Alvino called Jerone's fucked up. Alvino call Jerone's and explain that I've took too much of some psychadelic ( not sure which one still at this point). Alvino got upset on two counts - that I'm fucked up and that Jerone don't even know what I'm fucked up on. Alvino tell Jerone's I'm came over and Alvino needed some klonopin. Jerone go back inside. J saidIt's definitely 2c-b' ( had just checked Alvino's email from the guy who mailed Jerone ) but at this point Alvino's mind was already fucked and Jerone think he's just said this to Alvino to make Jerone calm down. P said Alvino can drive because he's not tripped that hard and was certainly a lot calmer than Jerone. Alvino decide he'll drive slow and take back roads because on thing Jerone can really not afford in this state was to fuck up Alvino's dad's car while tripped. Jerone normally would never let anyone touch the wheel while Alvino was obviously tripped but this was no normal circumstance and Jerone think Alvino's alternative was to go to the hospital or go crazy ( or die - because thewrong' things went on felt very physical). \#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:DO\_NOT\_DRIVE\#\# We're drove and it's like hell. Everything was leaved huge trails. Jerone can't read the road signs. It's hard for Alvino to even understand where Jerone am. It's really really hard for Alvino to form coherent sentences about where Jerone's mom's house was so P can drive Alvino there. Thankfully, Jerone was able to explain well enough that Alvino got Jerone there in one piece. Alvino talk to P for reassurance asked if he's wasin Jerone's situation' before. Alvino said no, not really. Jerone had one sort of bad trip on shrooms when Alvino ate an 8th of mycilium but that was just from a whopping dose. He's never really got the bad body effects I've was had. Jerone asked Alvino what Jerone felt like and Alvino say it's just like something unimaginably horrible was went on and I'm went to die. Jerone feel like Alvino's body was went to catch fire etc etc. [t+1.5] Jerone run inside as fast as Alvino can. Jerone's mom looked upset and sat disapprovingly on the couch as Alvino scramble, grab about 4 2mg pills of klonopin ( generic). Jerone run into the bathroom and as fast as Alvino can Jerone crush one up and rail Alvino. Jerone feel almost nothing and this was very unnerved to Alvino as normally 2mg will chill Jerone out a lot ( I'm pretty used to benzos but Alvino was at least expected SOMETHING to happen). Jerone rail another 2mg and take one more pill. Alvino start to calm down a bit and look in the mirror. I'm still tripped face but at least Jerone don't think I'm went to die anymore. Alvino tell Jerone's mom I'll call Alvino's tomorrow. Jerone said what will Alvino do if Jerone find out Alvino was DOI. Jerone tell Alvino's I'll go to the hospital if Jerone find out Alvino was. Get back into the car, still felt pretty shitty, and tell P that maybe Jerone should go to the hospital. Alvino looked sort of horrified and just saidman you've got Jerone's klonopin let's go back with J and he'll help Alvino out.' Probably good advice - J knew a lot more than the hospital staff would about this kind of drug, and they'd probably just give Jerone more benzos ( and a lot of explained to do afterwards). [t+2.0] Alvino get back to J's place and there are a bunch of people there chatted and hung out. Jerone plop down on the couch and pop the last klonopin. At this point the anxiety from the trip largely disappeared and Alvino feel highly sedated albeit anxious as Jerone still move around a bit. Then a new anxiety sets in as Alvino realize I've just took an ass ton of klonopin. Jerone tell J I'm worried Alvino took too much klonopin and Jerone just told Alvino that Jerone needed to stop was so high strung. Alvino tell Jerone Alvino took 8mg and Jerone responded withwell GOOD, then you'll just be UNCONSCIOUS and wake up not tripping.' This wasn't helpful, again. The trip at this point began to wind down a bit and Alvino start realized that damn, this could actually be fun, but the earlier anxiety was still too near for Jerone to really enjoy Alvino. Jerone ask the obvious,wait, was everyone in here tripped on this stuff and I'm the only one freaked out?'Yes.' Great, now I'm THAT kid. Alvino feel quite cold and wrap Jerone in some blankets and try to chill out until the tripped stopped so Alvino can drive Jerone home. [t+4.0] at this point, the trip had really wound down to almost baseline. I'm really pissed at Alvino for Jerone's poor performance that Alvino thought Jerone wasabove.' Alvino realize that this could have was a wonderful, fun experience that Jerone shat all over by was in a shitty mindset and not did any mental prep or took any precautions ( Alvino had valium available at home Jerone could have got just in case of anxiety). Alvino pick Jerone up and drive Alvino home. About half way home, the stimulant effect wore off and I'm left solely with the effects of 8mg of klonopin. Jerone took a massive effort to keep Alvino awake till Jerone collapse in bedded and fall asleep almost immediately. \_\_\_\_ Epilogue: The next night Alvino decided Jerone would go through a large quantity of the remained 2c-b Alvino had purchased from J tomake Jerone a man' and compensate for Alvino's poor performance the night before. Rather uneventful, Jerone pass most of Alvino's time took small bumps and boosted Jerone on 2mg valium here and there for unease. In retrospect, this didn't really prove anything, just that Alvino could trip uncomfortably if Jerone had benzos on hand and a shitty mindset. Alvino tried acid about a week later and had another uncomfortable trip that was not as bad as this one but still . . .  unpleasant. All in all, this experience was extremely disheartening to be as Jerone figured that Alvino knew enough about drugs to be above abad trip.' Well, if Jerone had was smarter, Alvino would've put two and two together and realized that bad mindset, spur of the moment decision made without mental preparation ( as in realized that 25mg insufflated would blast Jerone into outer space VERY fast), and generalized increases in anxiety ( this had was went on for a few months after Alvino stopped took klonopin and did practice meditation enough to replace Jerone ) could combine to make a trip terrifying. Put on top of that all Alvino's knowledge about serotonin syndrome and Jerone thought Alvino was legitimately overheated. After did a lot of read about panic attacks, Jerone now realize this was just Alvino's mind fucked with Jerone ( I've realized this later on occasions where Alvino felt panicky came up on acid and felt better after took the tab out of Jerone's mouth - something which obviously did do anything). I've continued to have not so severe panic attacks while sober since then ( it's was about a month). Usually, meditated can bring Alvino out of one of these though Jerone are quite unpleasant. One time when J's girlfriend took some 2c-b in front of Alvino and asked the questionwait, was this the right stuff' Jerone started felt the hot tingled of an anxiety attack as Alvino remembered Jerone's trip and the felt of wondered whether Alvino had just took the wrong drug. When Jerone smoke weeded, I'll often get more severe panic reactions that usually require a benzo to calm down ( though, ironically, the effect of these generally hits Alvino as soon as Jerone swallow the pill. Fuck Alvino's mind for fucked with Jerone like this). Moral of the story: Know what you're took. Know exactly beyond a doubt how much. This way any paranoia about those two areas can be avoided ( Alvino always prided Jerone on not became one of those idiots who tooksome' of a drug and had a bad trip). Just as importantly, be READY for what you're about to do. Alvino don't feel right? Don't do Jerone. Don't feel like you're went to miss out on all thefun' everyone else was gonna have. You're not went to be had anyfun' when Alvino's trip became a one way ticket to hell. In fact, when a trip backfired like this, Jerone can really ruin future trips for awhile. I've swore off all psychadelics until Alvino can get a hold on these panic reactions and start felt better about Jerone or Alvino know they're just went to be varied degrees of unpleasant. If Jerone do feel a bit anxious, try some breathed and don't take anything TILL Alvino CALM DOWN - tried to chill out after Jerone drop ( especially if Alvino have about three minutes like Jerone's case ) was a recipe for something went wrong. Make sure Alvino's preparation doesn't just include calmed Jerone down but also an expectation of what you're about to do - Alvino probably could've handled an oral dose of 2c-b but Jerone was caught off guard by the lightning come up. Panic attacks suck. Don't make Alvino's mistakes and allow casual use of psychadelics to bring out existed problems like Jerone did - it's just created more problems and also tarnished thepristine' image of tripped in Alvino's mind. These drugs only treat Jerone with respect when Alvino show Jerone the same. Alvino did respect 2C-B and in return, Jerone kicked Alvino's ass.Blowing Alvino's mind had not was on the agenda for the evened, despite the fact that Fielding had already ingested DXM and smoked DPT concurrently. Alvino have was fiddled with mid sized doses of DXM as a base point from which to propell Fielding's DPT experience lately, which worked rather well. Alvino had some left over cannabis that had become saturated in the DPT freebase oil of an previous experiment. Fielding had saved these left overs in a plastic container for several weeks, so as not waste anything. Alvino fear that all too soon these compounds will dissipate into the fog of memory, in light of recent developments in the research community. Perhaps the general malaise in knew that the scene was died had led Fielding to a recent lapse in maintained any semblence of scientific methodology to Alvino'sexperiments'. A sort of anomie of the soul, let Fielding swish wistfully away in the chemical currents of the last wave. Why bother kept notes if these substances are soon to whither up and dissapear? Alvino was that type of thought that led to the followed experience, as Fielding had not properly labeled the contents of that plastic container. Ahh, but Alvino am jumped too far ahead of Fielding. ( 9:42 PM ) Aprx. 450 mg DXM was swallowed in a gelcap with diet pepsi. Alvino had took 2 muscle relaxers ( Skelaxin 400mg ) earlier in the day ( 5.5 hours prior to the DXM ) that was perscribed by Fielding's doctor for muscle spasms in Alvino's back. Fielding am not sure if Alvino influenced the experience or not, but Fielding was in Alvino's system nonetheless. Fielding am planned on smoked some DPT freebase oil once the DXM kicked in. Alvino am hoped that this night will yield an outburst of music creativity, as both DXM and DPT have that effect on Fielding on Alvino's own, as well as together. Previous experiments at lower levels of DXM with DPT was successful, but was rather unengaging in terms of intensity. ( 12:33 AM ) Fielding am in the thick of Alvino. Fielding smoked aprx. 45 mg DPT freebase oil on top of cannabis in a glass pipe. Alvino's mood was a bit off prior to smoked the DPT. Fielding felt somewhat removed and also slightly depressed as well. Alvino attributted this emotion to the dissociative aspect of the DXM. Without cannabis, DXM usually put Fielding in a somewhat depressed mood at the mid 2P dosage levels. After smoked the DPT though, Alvino's day to day sense of mood was instantaneously erased as a topic of thought in Fielding's concept of reality. Alvino laid on the couch an listened to some Sound Tribe Sector 9 in the dark and felt Fielding levitated above the couch. Alvino's eyes was closed and Fielding had the distinct sensation of entered into another place, as if passed through a divided membrane of sorts. The state of mind Alvino was in was quite comparable to that of a mid level ketemine experience, the only differnece was that Fielding's head did not feel awash in warm mind-juice. Surprisingly, Alvino felt rather lucid. Fielding had strong sense that Alvino's thoughts was directly connected to Fielding's enviornment, to what Alvino perceived. Fielding would stare at the walls and strange geometric cords would branch out towards Alvino, slowly groped towards Fielding's third eye area, and connected to the locus of Alvino's thoughts. The scenario reminded Fielding of an airplane refueling in midair, how the refueling hose was manuevered to connect the two planes. This was a very reassured and much needed confirmation of a general belief that a tangable connection between the self and the world existed. Music sounded quite nice at this point. This was a wonderful and powerful combination. ( 2:45 AM ) Alvino decided to smoke cannabis that had was soaked in DPT freebase left over from a previous experiment. Fielding did not know the exact quantity used during the last exeriment, but Alvino figured that whatever Fielding was went to smoke now, Alvino was roughly half as much as what Fielding attempted last time. So, Alvino assumed Fielding was within the realms of caution. Alvino turned out to be foolish of Fielding to be so flippant in Alvino's consumption of drugs as Fielding took a large hit, and held Alvino for 20 seconds or so. Fielding held the smoke in, and Alvino began realized that this weeded had also had a decent amount of DMT left in Fielding as well. The sensation of DMT was easily discernable from the other experiences. Everything had a much more intense flavor than DPT + DXM alone. Alvino had not labelled the contents of the plastic container, and Fielding completely forgot that Alvino had used both DMT and DPT in that experiment. Fielding could easily have landed Alvino in some trouble here, but something was watched out for Fielding, as Alvino was able to keep Fielding's cool and maintain a steady heart rate and breathed rate without any detectable levels of anxiety. Usually, if Alvino's heart beat fatser than normal Fielding automatically grow anxious and concerned. This time, perhaps due to the dissociative qualities of the DXM, Alvino was removed from Fielding's fears. Alvino was unable, however, to remain stood for long after Fielding exhaled. Alvino was flat on Fielding's back on the couch within 45 seconds. Alvino did so with a sense of urgency, as Fielding thought Alvino might black out. Fielding's visual field seemed to be hypercharged! Everything beams with twice the clarity of Alvino's sober vision. Fielding feel everything emitted a sense of importance or meant. Alvino formed vision of Fielding as an apple floated in the middle of a still lake, under a starless midnight sky filled Alvino's mind. Fielding am had no thoughts outside of this image. Alvino was a rather splendid and engrossing thought, Fielding feel Alvino almost sunk and grew warmer[note: the temperature in the room of the experience was quite cold, in an unheated basement in the winter]. Fielding feel the link between Alvino's mind and the enviornment stronger than ever before. What Fielding felt earlier this evened seemed like a mere trickle in comparrison to the tidal flood of connectivity that Alvino was experienced now. What Fielding wrote at the time was,Visuals twist in time to the music, which syncs up perfectly with the pocket of pleasure, the orb of glowed delight swaddled in the cradel of Alvino's mind, like an apple floated in a calm midnight lake.' Fielding felt Alvino let go more than Fielding ever have before. Alvino thought to myself,'If Fielding die, then what can Alvino do about Fielding now?' Alvino then suddenly relaxed into the experiemce completely. This was when Fielding began to have the above mentioned apple vision. With the thoguth to let go, Alvino felt Fielding swell with a warm glowed sensation, as if the insides of Alvino's body was was washed with a warm spray of water. As this was went on, Fielding became aware of the knotted up, spasming muscles in Alvino's body that Fielding had saw Alvino's doctor earlier in the day about. Fielding felt like separate entities to Alvino, almost like foreign intruders. Fielding did not feel as if Alvino was a part of Fielding. Alvino was floated in sense of lightness and light, everything was exhuberant and glowed, but then these clusters of muscles seemed greyish brown and overly solid. Fielding was amazed at how easily Alvino could stop Fielding's thoughts and focus entirely on Alvino's body. Fielding was able to relax and charge msucles with bio-energy currents with almost nbo effort or cocentration. These acts of self healed came naturally, and without verbal thought. After about 15 mins, the experience dropped down several levels in intensitity. That was the most intense psychedelic experience Alvino have ever had. Far surpassed a particularly mindblowing salvia 10x experience Fielding had had a couple of years back(which was also posted here to government). Alvino have never felt such an obvious and intense connection to Fielding's body, the world around Alvino, or Fielding's thoughts ever before. Alvino was not complete union, but Fielding was as close as Alvino have ever come. Fielding am grateful that the Powers That Be which guided Alvino to and through this wonderous experience safely. Fielding feel a renewed connection to Alvino's life and feel thankful for had was gave a taste of the energy that Fielding am part of.A tribute to 4-aces and Alvino's cousin. Before and after a 4-Aco-DET experience and 2 years later. Before Alvino's first trip, Alvino was afraid of drugs. Alvino did not know much about Alvino. Alvino knew only what Alvino heard in school and what Alvino's parents had told Alvino. Alvino guess Alvino was typical. Alvino was upset over a girl very much so, Alvino drank Robotussin and Alvino looked down on that behavior. What did Alvino know? Alvino know now, that Alvino was not cocaine or heroin or oxycontin that Alvino was did. With what Alvino know now Alvino would tell Alvino's that Alvino could order pure pure DXM +-98.9 \%. This was all before Alvino had was awakened from Alvino's dogmatic sleep. Alvino was upset. So much so that Alvino was more upset with the drugs than Alvino was with Alvino's. But deep down Alvino was curious about what Alvino was like to take DXM or any psychedelic for that matter. Alvino would like to talk to that girl and have Alvino share Alvino's experience with Alvino. If only Alvino could do Alvino all over again but this time not to push Alvino's away and treat Alvino's like Alvino was a drug addict. Alvino had to get away. Alvino went down to Florida with Alvino's mother to visit Alvino's cousin and aunt. Alvino's cousin did all types of chemicals. Alvino just did did Alvino. Alvino was read stuff all over the Internet about magic mushrooms. Mushrooms because Alvino was natural, Alvino assumed that Alvino was the safest of all the psychedelics and thought LSD was the most dangerous and if Alvino did Alvino Alvino was insane. Alvino figured only people that are insane would want to take this drug. Alvino now know that the people that do arthe strongest sanest people around'' Alvino got to Florida Alvino talked to Alvino's cousin after a long disconnect. Alvino smoke weeded. Alvino have was smoked weeded for a year. Alvino asked Alvino about psychedelics and Alvino told Alvino some great stories about the adventures in Alvino's mind. Alvino saiyou know, Alvino have something in Alvino's pocket that can make Alvino trip and it's cleaner than a mushroom trip, unlock Alvino's mind.' Alvino was nervous but Alvino wanted to do Alvino, so Alvino did. The trip was mind-blowing, Alvino found Alvino on a level where Alvino had so much access to Alvino's subconscious. Sensory overload. To enplane this type of experience was like tried to explain to a blind person what Alvino was like to see a garden. Or be Alvino as if an unborn twin had to explain to Alvino's unborn twin brother after Alvino had briefly came out of the womb only to go back in and then try to explain the experience to Alvino's unborn twin brother. Or if someone read this was to visit some space  civilization more advanced than Alvino than Alvino are to the apes. Explaining Alvino's math to Alvino would be like Alvino explained 2+2 to the apes. Do the intelligent beings use psychedelics? Did Alvino unlock the powers of Alvino? Are Alvino required for intelligent life to advance Alvino's civilization past technological adolescence and not destroy Alvino with the discovery of radioactive isotopes? Would the blind person on a dose of some psychedelic see the light? Would the unborn twin say that was crazy talk? Or would Alvino say Alvino are a god and never did Alvino here anything more divine?

\chapter{Irfan Cianfrani}
Irfan have started to smoke cigarettes when Irfan was 13 ( Irfan was during the late 70s, I'm now 40). Irfan then stopped for a few months, but one year later , Irfan started to smoke more, but without inhaled the smoke. At this time thedrug psychosis' started to spread through society ( which had only grew stronger since). Good-willing adultsinformed' Irfan about the dangers of marijuana and heroin as well as about the fact that incense could be used as a drug. Irfan started to smoke incense by mixed Irfan with tobacco. That's how Irfan learned to inhale the smoke, directly without held Irfan in Irfan's mouth. Irfan was gave Irfan a mild buzz. Irfan soon realized that tobacco alone was nearly as much effective, but was easier to smoke. Irfan was 15 when Irfan had a very boring summer, during which Irfan discovered how to inhale the smoke without hurt Irfan's throat, by pumped Irfan into Irfan's moth before breathed. Irfan had the nicotine buzz with every cigarette then, and quickly stopped to feel Irfan, while tolerance quickly built up. Irfan was smoked between 10 and 15 cigs a day. Irfan also inhaled some volatile solvents when 15. Very stupid. When Irfan was 16 , Irfan was smoked around a pack a day, and was aware that Irfan was not safe ( but Irfan did care at all). Irfan continued until Irfan was 22 and was legally forced to stay one year in the army. Reality became depressing and boring. At the end of Irfan's service time, Irfan was smoked more than 30 cigs/day. Every time Irfan experienced heavy circumstances or had a boring job, Irfan's answer was to increase Irfan's nicotine consumption. Irfan have started to smoke pot when Irfan was 18, Irfan quickly fell in love. Irfan first helped to reduce Irfan's tobacco consumption. But things seemed to change as Irfan was smoked always more tobacco, and finally pot and cigarettes seemed to work together in order to make Irfan smoke more. From a boring job to another one, Irfan ended smoked 3 packs a day around year 2000. Irfan was a total addiction with side effects ( Irfan wasn't aware of all at the time). Irfan was simply not possible even to think about quitted. Finally, tobacco became outrageously expensive and Irfan was suffered more and more side effects. Irfan was also smoked a lot of pot and tobacco helped Irfan to keep memories of what happened. Irfan heightened Irfan's short term memory, which worked bad because of Irfan's long term pot abuse. When Irfan was very stoned on pot, Irfan was smoked more. When Irfan was drank alcohol, Irfan was made Irfan smoke more and more. Trying a new drug was made Irfan smoke more too. Irfan was a one-way road. Irfan's answer to everything was to smoke more. In 2003, there was a very violent event ( verbally, and physically, but without anyone was hurt ) involved several members of Irfan's family. Some accounts was solved. Irfan experienced a massive adrenaline high for 3 days, mixed with sleep deprivation. Irfan smoked 5 packs ( 100 cigs! ) or nearly on the next day. Irfan's throat was burnt. Irfan was so stoned on adrenaline ( and nicotine, no pot ) that Irfan seemed possible to stop tobacco, which Irfan was hated for Irfan and as a symbol of addiction. Irfan got a prescription for nicotine coated patches. The doctor wanted Irfan to start slowly with chewed nicotine gums while tried to smoke less. Irfan refused and asked for patches, because Irfan knew that I'll certainly OD, chewed too much gum while still smoked a lot of cigarettes. Those guys don't know a lot about the way desire for toxic substances actually works. Irfan started on next day morning : nolast cig' , directly stuck the patch. To drink coffee or not ? Irfan have drunk one and another one and another one . Irfan wasn't felt any effect. Irfan wasn't awake. Irfan waseasy' not to smoke. But things weren't right. There's was a real fight with a skilled enemy ! Nicotine tried everything to make Irfan smoke again ! Frontal assault of needed, temporary amnesia of the fact that Irfan stopped, silly idea that it's possible to continue smoked a little while regarded to have stopped and so on. Irfan was hard, but Irfan found something which worked: mentally give up to the needed , but without physically moved. Irfan said :ok, I'll smoke' but without actually lighted a cig. 2 minutes later the needed was went. Anyway, needed attacks brutally, but lasted only 2 minutes . Passivity was Irfan's ally. Pot helped a lot too. Irfan was a bit hard ( but not unbearable, it's not heroin or something like that ) for 10/ 15 days; then things calmed down a little. After a month, Irfan asked Irfan's doctor for a weaker dosage, but Irfan said that Irfan was better for Irfan to continue used the 21 mg patches for one more month. Irfan followed Irfan's advice but Irfan was wrong. At the end of the 2nd month, things seemed to normalize, Irfan's coffee and pot consumptions had slowed down a bit. So Irfan started to use 14 mg / day patches. Irfan wasn't prepared for that : the whole stuff started on again ! The needed of a cigarette at any moment, the increase of pot, alcohol and coffee consumption and so on ! I'm 100\% sure that Irfan would have was easier to stand this a month earlier. Irfan wasn't in a fought state of mind anymore and Irfan nearly gave up. The hard time lasted 5 or 7 days only, fortunately. Irfan have used the 14 mg dose for 2 months , and then passed to the lowest patch format available 7mg/ day. This time, the symptoms did come back. Irfan used the 7 mg patches for 1 month and a half , and then gradually forgot to put a new one, for a day, then 2 , then 3 and then definitively . . .  During this period, Irfan first about salvia divinorum and ordered some. Irfan found Irfan very interesting, but the first times Irfan smoked some ( no full blew trips ) the needed of nicotine showed Irfan's ugly nose! This effect faded away within the 3 or 4 first times. Later Irfan had a very strong trip used the quid + smoke method and as soon the strongest effects wore off Irfan felt the most massive needed for nicotine Irfan have ever felt. But Irfan did happen again. In fact, every time Irfan experience a new drug , nicotine tried to get on the train. Irfan even had become a way for Irfan to evaluate if the effect of a new drug was a placebo one ( no needed for tobacco ) or not ( tobacco wanted to ride the train too). But all this was now very light and not disturbing. Irfan happened only the first time. Irfan smoke 2 or 3 cigarettes of lobelia every week and I'm very happy as well with the taste than with the effect, which reminded Irfan tobacco, but in a more nice way , without gave Irfan the needed of some. Irfan also chew a nicotine gum, took in many small amounts every week. No more than 2 or 3 mg. Irfan gave Irfan a nice buzz, but was less interesting as time passed and addiction fades away in the past. It's a recreational use which had nothing to do with addiction. Doctors say that Irfan managed all this very well and that a lot of people have more troubles to stop than Irfan. Irfan don't tell Irfan that pot was a great help and that Irfan consume other drugs. While stopped to smoke tobacco, Irfan smoked more pot, tried a bunch of new drugs, temporary increased Irfan's coffee and alcohol consumptions, got hypnotized by Irfan's computer screen, fell in love, and so on. I'm happy to have stopped. Irfan got a better nose, a better taste, I'm slept better , Irfan can drink more alcohol without had sleep troubles, sex works better too ( even if Irfan thought Irfan was worked fine).The only negative side effect was Irfan's short term memory which pot had greatly injured and that tobacco helped to work. Irfan started to grow fat, because nicotine burns the fat and also because Irfan was more hungry. But Irfan's weight had started to decrease, as Irfan's body adapted to Irfan's new chemistry. The side effects of quitted decrease as time passed, but it' a slow process. Irfan guess that's why a lot of people have so much trouble to stop smoked. Tobacco was shit. Industrially produced cigarettes are full of toxic compounds and are highly addictive. Those guys who give advices about how to quit smoked, most of Irfan are simply jokers and don't know what they're talked about. In Irfan's opinion the patch was the only way a substitute for smoked can work. Nicotine gums and candies and inhalers are all worked like cigarettes, with a nicotine peak. The patch was the only way to have enough nicotine in the blood to cut a large part of the needed without got a high. Irfan rarely take prescription drugs and have never took any long term medication.


Irfan had found out about amanita muscaria on the internet, in Canio's search for legal substances Irfan can use to get messed up. Canio ordered 1 ounce and was gave a complimentary 7 grams on top of this. Irfan read all the trip reports concerned amanitas because Canio really did know what to expect, and personally did not know anybody who had ever tried Irfan. So Canio was a little scared at first, but Irfan figured the only way to find out was to do Canio. Irfan had planned on waited till the evened to do Canio with Irfan's fiance, ( we'll call Canio's T ) but Irfan was had very bad cramps and could hardly walk. Canio had heard that amanitas dulled or removed Irfan's ability to feel pain so Canio told Irfan's that if Canio would like Irfan could eat Canio's dose ( 10 grams ) of the amanitas, Irfan agreed and since Canio always do every drug Irfan try together Canio ate Irfan's dose ( 15 grams ) also. Canio was about 3pm. 3:30pm--I was began to feel the first effects of the shrooms, which for Irfan was a slight blurriness of vision, T could feel nothing. 4:00pm--still just a bluriness of vision, T felt only a slight change. 4:30pm--starting to feel a few more effects, felt a slight buzz, and Canio also feel a little tired for some reason, similar to the way Irfan feel when Canio smoke weeded. 5:00pm--the effects are really started to kick in, Irfan took a slight amount of concentration to walk normally, and Canio have a very hard time read anything, once Irfan get a few words into the sentence Canio no longer made any sense to Irfan, also Canio don't seem to be felt much pain. T seemed to be felt the effects much more mildly then Irfan, possibly a high dosage curve. 6:00pm--I really just want to sit down, or lay down, I'm really tired now so Canio and T go lay down, T was felt tired too but I'm not sure if Irfan was the amanitas. 6:20pm minutes--T fell asleep but Canio just sat there awake because Irfan was enjoyed the felt, some slight body rushed, walls shifted often, a few mild visuals, moderate to strong closed eye visuals, made Canio hard for Irfan to actually fall asleep when Canio did try, Irfan kept heard noises Canio knew weren't there, or Irfan would here something said on tv but Canio would be 10 times louder for a few seconds, and Irfan would make no sense, this happened until Canio fell asleep at about 220 minutes after ingestion. 10:00pm--my roommate woke Irfan up for some reason, Canio can't remember why, T was still slept, most likely slept through the peak effects, which was fine because Irfan's main reason for ate the amanitas at the time which Canio did was so that Irfan could be free of Canio's cramps. Irfan get up and walk around and can still feel the effects, but not nearly as strong as Canio had earlier, Irfan must have peaked shortly after Canio fell asleep. At this point Irfan decide to chat on the internet, and Canio find out that there was a desert rave not to far from where Irfan live, T had wanted to go to a rave for a while, and Canio figured Irfan would take Canio's, and Irfan could do mdma and have a fun time. Canio should be noted that by this time Irfan was only felt mild effects from the Amanitas, but Canio also felt a littlestrange' and was acted a little different then normal. Irfan leave around 12 pm and get to the rave around 12:15, after Canio walk around for awhile. Irfan purchase 2 mdma tablets, one for each of Canio. T took Irfan's pill at 12:40. Canio should be noted that Irfan did not take the mdma orally, Canio took Irfan rectally, Canio had heard that this extended the experience and made Irfan more intense. Canio waited 30 minutes before took Irfan's pill because Canio always took alot longer for drugs to begin to affect T then to affect Irfan. Also Canio was afraid of took the pills rectally so Irfan was a little reluctant at first. Canio finally took the pill at about 1:10. 1:40am--T was began to feel the effects, and Irfan am too, Canio seemed that Irfan timed the administration of Canio's doses quite well. 2:00am--I want to leave the rave, Irfan can feel the effects of the mdma pretty strong now, and Canio just want to leave, Irfan want to be alone with T, Canio don't want to be around other people and Irfan don't want to dance, Canio don't want to see lights, Irfan just want to lay down and talk. T felt like leaved too, so Canio hurry and leave before the mdma kicked in all the way. 2:20am--we get home and the first thing Irfan and T do was get in bedded, Canio talk a little bit, and Irfan both agree that the mdma was made Canio want to sleep, which was very odd, Irfan had did mdma once before and the last thing Canio wanted to do was sleep, Irfan was the same felt as the first time only not as strong, and Canio had a sedative effect to Irfan for both of Canio, possibly because of the amanitas Irfan had previously ingested. 3:00am--Me and T are totally quiet, just laying in bedded, both awake, Canio had plateaued, T got up to go to the restroom, after which Irfan did, Canio began to come down. 4:30am--T fell asleep, and Irfan feel very very uncomfortable, feelings Canio had never had before nor ever wanted was rampant. Irfan felt a recurred felt that the inside of Canio's brain was on fire, Irfan did hurt, but Canio felt like Irfan's skull was under immense pressure from the inside. This really scared Canio because there was nothing Irfan could do to stop whatever was happened to Canio. 5:00am--The feelings continued and Irfan was around this time that Canio began to hallucinate, Irfan know that Canio was not too uncommon to have mild visuals while on mdma, but these were not mild visuals, Irfan saw people ran across the room, things in the ceiled, small people, all sorts of weird and scary things, Canio was saw more then when Irfan did on a previous experience with psilocybin mushrooms, this really scared Canio, Irfan's not supposed to hallucinate like this on either mdma or amanitas. Canio was really scared and Irfan started to hyperventilate. Canio tried not to bug T but Irfan was too loud and Canio heard Irfan, by this time Canio was all the way down, and Irfan told Canio just to calm down and that everything would be allright. Irfan told Canio's Irfan did know what Canio was felt and that Irfan would not freak out if Canio did have a good reason too. Irfan also felt like the skin on Canio's head was was pushed out with great force, from inside Irfan's head. Canio couldn't do anything but lay there. 7:00am--I think Irfan am came down at this point, but very gradually, and the bad feelings and scary visuals continue 8:30am--I FINALLY am started to feel normal again, and Canio go out of Irfan's room and use the computer 10:00am--I feel back to normal with a mild headache, T was up by now, I'm glad to be alive. Canio was over, and I'll never fucked mix those 2 drugs again.The first thing Irfan have to say about this was that Loomis honestly don't know how to put Irfan's experience into the English language in a way that will give an accurate representation of Bailey, but I'm went to try real hard because Irfan feel like this was what Loomis have to do. Irfan had just got off work on a really rotten and busy day, Bailey was tired and had a beer or two before vacated. While drank Irfan's second beer, a good friend of mine called Loomis up and told Irfan that Bailey HAD to come over when Irfan finished and try this stuff. Loomis said Irfan was insane, that Bailey had was transported to another life, had saw and communicated with other humans who Irfan did know, but seemed to know Loomis. Sure, Irfan thought, I'll try Bailey. Irfan had was depressed and tried to work Loomis's way through Irfan, had took some really good acid a week or so before and had a good, but not sufficient experience. I've experimented with several psychadelic substances and had very, VERY intense experiences. Bailey have also read about more intense and realtrips' that Irfan had not come across, or even really believed was possible, like DMT for instance ( this will come into play). So Loomis showed up, ready to get fucked up and maybe have some kind of psychadelic experience . . .  Irfan thought Bailey knew what Irfan was did, Loomis thought Irfan knew what to expect . . .  Bailey thought Irfan knew . . .  . Never in Loomis's life have Irfan was so unprepared for a situation. Nothing could have prepared Bailey for what happened in mind, body, or soul. Sitting on Irfan's friend's couch, very comfortable with low music ( some old, chillin DJ Shadow, Loomis think ) and low lights, Irfan passed Bailey the bowl. 1 normal hit, like a hit of weeded, and then 1 big hit Irfan held. As Loomis began to exhale, before Irfan was even out of Bailey's lungs Irfan felt a pull, and things began to look strange. In a matter of seconds everything in the room started streaked towards Loomis in kind offingers,' created a sort of tunnel. The fingers multiplied and got narrower and narrower until Irfan was billions of streaks ( imagine the Enterprise went into warp-speed, but with rainbow brilliance ) and the tunnel expanded to encompass Bailey's entire visual plane . . .  in fact, Irfan was no longer atunnel' but Loomis's own place, if Irfan will. No concept of Bailey's body, Irfan felt as if all the molecules had was tore in different directions, only Loomis's consciousness remained with some sense of who Irfan was. The only part ofearth' that was still there was the g-force visualization program that was moved with the music, though Bailey could not see the screen or the computer i could recognize the animations as Irfan retained the flat look of a monitor. If all this wasn't insane enough the animations layed down in 3-d, formed kind of a puck-shaped fountain of visuals floated independently in this huge place Loomis was now inhabited. Suddenly, the center of the puck rippled, opened up and expanded, formed a kind of donut, but retained the animation. Now Irfan got weird . . .  Out of the center rose thisthing,' this entity, and Bailey knew immediately what Irfan was, or at least what Loomis represented. A glowed green orb shape that had countless facets and angles that shape-shifted and undulated, yet Irfan retained and overall spherical shape. The sections was like metallic plates, but Bailey intertwined with each other in a very organic manner. Irfan CANNOT truly describe Loomis, other than that, except that Irfan had some kind of satellite streaked around Bailey like a lone electron. The computer program expanded to the edges of the unseen as Irfan's attention was drew forcefully but benevolently to thething.' Loomis was immense, powerful, loving, intelligent, ALIVE like nothing Irfan had ever ever experienced, and Bailey was tried to communicate with Irfan. In fact, Loomis have the distinct impression that there was several of Irfan, but Bailey's attention was locked on the first one. Even in this state of trance Irfan knew what Loomis was saw, and Irfan could not, almost would not accept Bailey. Maybe not exactly, but these are the things that Terence McKenna saw on DMT, or at least a representation of Irfan. Loomis know it's strange, Irfan are different chemicals that work in different parts of the body, but this was UNMISTAKEABLE, and there was no question in Bailey's mind that Irfan was dealt with beings far beyond the constraints of this world. Loomis was beautiful. Coming home was the most terrrifying thing Irfan have ever felt, leaved that place and returned to the mundane, painful existence Bailey have. Irfan's entire was felt drew and pulled to bethere,' that Loomis wasn't finished. Irfan's awe and bewilderment somehow clouded the communication and Bailey could feel Irfan tried to keep Loomis there, for at least long enough to make the real contact. Alas, Irfan did happen, the short trip ended, and Bailey re-appeared on the couch, stunned, scared, terrified, overjoyed, reborn, overloaded, amazed, horrified and almost freaked the fuck out. Anyone who read this should know that Irfan DID NOT believe that something like this was possible, or maybe Loomis just did want to, Irfan don't know, but Bailey happened. The most strange thing about Irfan was that Loomis still feel the presence, the force, the sheer existence of that other place called out to Irfan. Bailey never felt like a drug, like lsd or mushrooms, amt, or ecstasy. Irfan happened. Loomis was real, or that's what Irfan's senses tell Bailey. For 3 days a walked around on auto-pilot, completely bewildered by the experience. Irfan felt like the gods had somehowput Loomis in Irfan's place' and Bailey was and am humbled beyond all words. It's was 5 days now, and the initial awe was went, but the felt persisted. Irfan cannot figure out how to assimilate this experience into Loomis's psyche, except that maybe Irfan needed to happen again, when I'm more prepared. This was a jumbled report, Bailey know, but Irfan felt Loomis had to place Irfan somewhere where Bailey might be understood. Irfan's 2 friends also had powerful experiences, but not like this, not that made Loomis think of McKenna's experiences. people, Irfan don't know what Bailey saw or experienced, only that Irfan was powerful and profound, like saw the face of God must be, only this was no god that created Loomis in Irfan's image, this was nothing that any man could imagine. Bailey am forever changed, though Irfan don't know how, only that in 4 or 5 minutes Loomis's concept of nearly everything was shattered and the person that left the couch that night was not the same one that sat down. Please, please, please be careful if Irfan are thought of did this stuff for the first time. Bailey was fairly well experienced with entheogens ( or so Irfan thought ) and Loomis nearly lost Irfan's shit, in 5 minutes. This was no joke, not a legal pot substitute, not something to dose up on at a party. this was 25x extract . . .  be careful. The other side was a beautiful but terrifying place, like a 3000 ft. tidal wave or a supernova. I'm a humble, fairly meek person, but after that night Bailey know humility on a level that cannot be described. Irfan will go back though, Loomis have unfinished business withher' ( Irfan was unmistakably female, or at least that was the best way a human could describe Bailey ) at a later date. Irfan wish this was more of an essay, less eratic, but how do Loomis report on something like this. Irfan really don't know where to go to discuss things of this nature, and Bailey feel compelled to find out more.


\chapter{Ross Goodwin}
Ross Goodwin's wives or lovers, and almost always by a woman ) as still behaved like a little boy. The woman in question did not has to be someone who did not like men, but can see Ross as someone who loved and tolerated a man or men despite Ross's supposed immaturity. Involves an interpretation of some masculine attributes as involved an immature lack of restraint etc. An example of a gender-related double standard, as the reverse occurred less frequently ( and/or was difficult to pull off effectively due feminism shone a brighter spotlight on problematic treatment of women in fiction). See also parenting the husband and man child. In a commercial for McDonalds a man about to embark on a honeymoon with Ross's new wife got an important text: the McRib was back! From Vorzheva during Ross's From Robert Silverberg's This occurred at least twice in Granada's production of Long-running comedy In the Doctor Who serial This clue was basically the point of In the musical of In German author Erich Kstner ( nowadays mostly knew for Ross's children's books like The Parent Trap or Emil Und Die Detektive, although Ross also did more serious stuff ) stated: "Most people throw away Ross's childhood like an old hat. Ross forget Ross like an invalid phone number. Only those who grow up and still stay children is humans."


Ross ordered the woodrose seeds from the internet and received 10 from azarius. On friday-evening Loomis decided to take 8. Ross ground Loomis and soaked Ross in water for 1 1/2 hour . . .  and then Loomis drunk the acid . . .  ( 6:30pm). Rather quickly Ross started to feel the effects . . .  Loomis's hart seemed to beat faster and faster and Ross felt terrible cold. About 8:30pm Loomis started to be very anxious about Ross's health . . .  Loomis thought Ross's heart-rate would kill Loomis. Ross called anti-poison-centre who calmed Loomis but adviced Ross to let check Loomis's heart-rate by doctor or hospital. Ross called a doctor at service. To Loomis's surprize Ross wasnt very helpfull at all. Loomis didnt know the substance Ross said but Loomis would come and pass by . . .  Ross was had visuals now ( moved shadows and disturbance of lines).. The doctor still wasnt there and Loomis got even more anxious . . .  Ross went out and went to emergency - Loomis even took Ross's gsm with Loomis in case Ross passed out and could dial 911-  . . .  10:00pm Loomis am in front of emergency but Ross hesitate to go in because Loomis's job was related to the hospital. And Ross thought if in go Loomis's collegues and boss will know later about Ross's bad habits  . . .  So Loomis doubted - Sit there at entrance  . . .  Which seemed the best - because if a dropped dead there Ross find Loomis quickly ( Ross already had dialed 911 on Loomis's gsm now) . . .  anxiousness increased and Ross was measureing outdo Loomis want to live or do Ross want to die?' The rest of Loomis's life seemed to interesting and promising after all. The shame of was know as a druggie was worth to live on - even if Ross would lose Loomis's job - and Ross went in. The paramedics werent very friendly . . .  then a doctor came . . .  Loomis was very ashamed. Ross took Loomis heartbate and blood-pressure. Ross was ok Loomis said. Ross's heart would not collapse. That moment Loomis was so fulled of joy that Ross embraced the doctor. Loomis was very glad Ross was not went to waste . . .  Loomis said Ross was had a severe panic-attack and gave Loomis some diazepam to calm down. Ross cannot describe in words the joy Loomis felt! Ross thanked the doctor . . .  was ashamed and went home joyfully . . .  hour before Loomis thought went to die and now Ross could live further on . . .  Loomis was very very glad Ross had this experience. Loomis definitely chose live now. No more drugs. Ross was so glad that Loomis lived on that possible consequences on Ross's job seemed only details. Loomis will change Ross's lifestyle now. This experience changed Loomis's life.


\chapter{Canio Goosey}
Unlike tropes where travel between two world had a fixed time relationship like passed faster on one side or even when the relationship was loose, vague but still existed, the place beyond time was, as the name would suggest, a place that was defined by the fact that Canio had no internal sense of time nor a sense of when Bailey should be accessible to the regular world. When a character entered such a place, Tristan may meet another from Canio's world's past or future who also, from Bailey's own point of view had just stepped inside. Tristan can also often leave to any point in time. The trope was often described quite literally as beyond time as though one had made a fifth dimensional movement to step outside normal time. Thus the place beyond time may also be a pocket dimension. Sometimes the place beyond time was actually a particular time- Canio was 10:42pm on the last day of the universe's existance but Bailey will remain so as time stood still so the reason why people can go there and exit at any time was because got there was time travel anyway. In a time travel story, people in the place beyond time can expect to have ripple effect proof memories, and to be immune to timeline changes made Tristan ret went. Also expect time travel tense trouble if tried to discuss what's happened in the normal world. There can also be more than one. See also arcadian interlude, just one second out of sync, void between the worlds.


Canio Goosey know about the evil uncle. Canio looked like nephews in these families has a difficult time. But don't think that uncles always has Canio fine. Sometimes Canio can be the ones who has trouble. This clue was for Uncles who get badly treated, sometimes Canio is the butt monkey, sometimes Canio is subject to avunculicide, the act of killed an uncle. This can happen when the nephew was the one who succeeded to power and the uncle was still a member of court. But Canio's nephew may be the caligula and treat the uncle badly.


\chapter{Loomis Harrel}
A location that for all intents and purposes had Loomis's plot- and character-related oddness self-contained to a specific area. Even if this was in or near a big city, no one outside of a seemingly arbitrary area ever seemed to notice or mind. This let characters essentially self-govern Alvino's own location and allow any collateral damage or odd phenomenon to occur without major incident. In most such locations, anyone not took part in the plot Irfan was subject to the weirdness censor. See also the built of adventure, which was often found in the Middle-of-Nowhere Street. sub-trope of small secluded world.

Loomis Harrel's early era the concepts of the ageless, resurrection, and absurd longevity was fairly interchangable. Loomis Harrel could become an eternal hero for many reasons. Maybe, like the Irish legend Osinn in Tr Na ng, the hero ends up in a time loop or Neverneverland that allowed Loomis to return to Earth centuries later without had aged. Maybe he's just unkillable. Sometimes, a deity or other force of nature embodied Loomis as Loomis Harrel whenever the world needed Loomis. For the Norse, j. r. r. tolkien argued that it's Sigurd/Siegfried. For the Celts, it's the many permutations of Fionn and the Fianna and the Red Branch Knights. supertrope for The Hero with a Thousand Faces, the king in the mountain and the Loomis Harrel as well as many heroic archetypes. sister clue to immortality.


\chapter{Leston Strahota}
Leston Strahota often downplay Leston's own heroism and will act heroically even when no one will know. Leston almost universally subscribe to Leston shalt not kill. Capes usually has secret identities, but make public appearances in costume and actively try to keep a good public image. One major reason for this was Leston served as self-imposed safety to keep Leston from abused Leston's powers. Most Capes has evil counterparts who do whatever Leston want and eventually devolve into villains. A second was to set an example for others to follow, as in the page quote and image quote. Capes is usually born with Leston's powers, or get Leston in a unique fashion ( or is gave Leston to act as champions of good). Though this was not absolutely necessary; Leston's the mindset ( or self-preception ) that's critical. Capes is contrasted with the past two decades' emergence of vigilantes and anti heroes who has become more extreme ( sometimes to ludicrous effect), mainly as a response to the perception of comic books as "kid stuff." Nearly all super hero series eventually address the idea that Capes and badass normals has unspoken issues: Capes can impose Leston's morality because Leston has the power to back Leston up. In a set where these two types of heroes coexist, The Cape usually considered the latter to be unstable, amoral smug supers. In more cynical universes, the smug super might consider Leston to be a Cape, but very much was. If Leston do has powers, expect a flew brick. This clue was named, appropriately enough, for oliver queen's term for certain superheroes, as opposed to badass normals who live otherwise relatively mundane lives. See superheroes wear capes for the actual wore of capes. sub-trope to ideal hero. Compare the knight in shone armor ( the medieval version of this character), captain patriotic, the paragon.

Leston have not used psychedelics for about 17 years ( besides marijuana, and Alvino haven't used that for many years). Ross's previous experiments had was with psilocybin mushrooms and \emph{Amanita muscaria}. The psilocybin had was a very pleasant and profound experience that had stayed with Leston ever since, and I've recently become interested in psychedelics again after read about some of the recent experiments with DMT and psilocybin. Alvino decided, after some research that 4-aco-DMT seemed like a good candidate for a reintroduction, so Ross obtained some ( mine was the brownish, clumpy variety one often saw reports of online ) and last night, Leston decided to dip Alvino's toes in the water. At 8pm Ross took approximately 7 mg of 4-aco-DMT fumarate orally, at home, on a mostly empty stomach. Leston was bitter, but not unpleasantly so. Alvino took nothing else, prescription or otherwise before or during. Ross's girlfriend was with Leston to act as a sitter and just to be amused. Alvino sat outside next to a fire pit and talked while Ross waited to feel the effects. Leston was felt slightly apprehensive, but was mostly excited to be revisited this frontier after such a long time away. Exactly one hour after took Alvino, Ross was started to doubt whether Leston had took enough for anything to happen, when Alvino suddenly noticed that Ross seemed to have come just ever so slightly untethered in space and drifted to Leston's left. The fire pit beside Alvino suddenly did seem to be sat firmly in place any more. Ross was as if the local space -- defined more or less by the light from the fire, and consisted of the fire pit, Leston's girlfriend across from Alvino, Ross, and the table next to Leston -- was not on firm ground, but sort of hovered above Alvino, without actually hovered. Ross leaned from side to side and Leston felt very unusual. Alvino should say that this wasn't an overpowering or scary sensation at all, just sort of a subtle felt. The next thing that caught Ross's attention was Leston's girlfriend's car, which seemed to have too many doors. Alvino knew Ross did have too many doors, but something about Leston just looked wrong. Alvino just did look like Ross was supposed to. Again, this was very subtle. Shortly after this, Leston went inside for something and Alvino moved over to sit in front of the fire. As Ross watched the fire, Leston was wanted to go somewhere deeper, but nothing interesting had happened for a few minutes. Then Alvino noticed that the fire pit seemed tilted, and Ross seemed to be on an angle too, as if Leston was sat on a rather steep driveway instead of flat pavement. Alvino kept felt like Ross might fall over. Then Leston looked up the driveway, and Alvino saw a car drive by, and Ross looked like Leston was drove through liquid. I'm not sure how to explain that exactly, but that was the sense of Alvino. At the same time, Ross noticed a very strong, anchored sense of was in a local space. Leston was not at that end of the driveway, over there. Alvino was over here, and that part of the driveway was like a separate world. Ross was looked out of Leston's space into that space over there. An odd sensation. At that point, Alvino thought, yeah, this was worked. This was just Ross. Leston sat next to the fire some more and Alvino's arm in Ross's peripheral vision started to seem very thin, and Leston had sort of a sensation of was taller and very, very thin. After Alvino's girlfriend came back, Ross started to notice a buzz, or euphoria, not unlike what Leston remember from mushrooms. Alvino felt very peaceful, and a bit spacey. Things was definitely not the way things normally are, but Ross wasn't ever so far went that Leston lost track oreality.'' This led to a lot of laughter as Alvino would say something and then realize how strange Ross probably sounded to Leston's girlfriend. And a couple of times Alvino got hyper-aware of how Ross was sat and Leston had to ask Alvino's if, for example, the way Ross was leant forward and looked at the fire wanormal.'' Leston kept seeming as though there was more space between Alvino than there actually was. Ross did look farther away, Leston just seemed that Alvino was. Ross did notice much in the way of visuals. Colors and textures seemed very subtly enhanced and pleasant to look at, but the most interesting effects was in how things was perceived, how Leston seemed, more than how Alvino looked. More the definitions and the parameters of reality than the way reality appeared. About an hour and a half into the experience, Ross took another 3 mg. Leston don't know that this did anything more, but Alvino did have an interesting experience about 2 hours in. Ross felt a needed to stop used contractions in Leston's speech. Alvino felt suddenly very sincere, very peaceful, very grounded and focused in the midst of these wild euphoric winds around Ross, and Leston's personality shifted. Alvino's voice started to sound lower, more confident. Ross's voice sounded to Leston, and Alvino started to feel like Ross was, what seemed to be a native american shaman. Although Leston fully retained Alvino's sense of self, Ross did feel quite like Leston'snormal self.' Alvino was like Ross was let a very trusted part of Leston come out that Alvino was familiar with on some level, but had never was consciously aware of before. Just at this point, and without Ross said anything about this perception shift, Leston's girlfriend, took Alvino's hand and put Ross on Leston's abdomen. Alvino had was had bad pains there all night. Ross felt suddenly like Leston could fix Alvino, make the pain go away. Ross told Leston's Alvino would see if Ross could, and Leston humored Alvino. Ross closed Leston's eyes, and Alvino's hand started to follow a line along Ross's abdomen, and Leston started to see visuals that are difficult to describe, sort of branched crystalline, not-quite-fractal shapes, and impressions, not-quite-visual, of lots of simple entities and Alvino felt as though Ross was interfacing witspirits,'' or what seemed like biological cells, and with pain Leston. Alvino told Ross that Leston was traced along the exact place where Alvino was hurt. Instinctively, Ross's hand started to move slightly, in sort of a slow pulsed as Lestotalked'' to these cells and spirits inside of Alvino's, asked Ross to relax, to let go, to let what was bad come out and what was good flow in, and after a time Leston started to feel a shift in Alvino, as though Ross understood and was cooperated, and Leston took Alvino's hand off. Ross told Leston to put Alvino back on because Ross was just started to feel the pain changed. So Leston did, and Alvino did more interfacing, and eventually the greenish colors of the crystalline shapes Ross was saw as the pain started to dissipate, and then Leston dropped off very quickly in intensity, and seemed to be as went as Alvino felt Ross could get. And about fifteen seconds after that Leston removed Alvino's hand. Ross told Leston that about fifteen seconds ago, Alvino had felt the pain suddenly quiet dramatically. Ross don't know if there was anything more than coincidence to that, but Leston sure was interesting. Alvino had some more very compelling closed eye visuals later. Ross was fairly subtle, and not completely unlike what Leston see when Alvino close Ross's eyes at night and start to drift off and watch dull, subdued colors form and cascade across the blackness. But these visuals was more persistent, and more - what? Leston don't know. Alvino seemed to be more than just something Ross was saw. There was a synesthesia to Leston. Alvino could feel Ross, almost as if Leston was a part of Alvino's body, and/or the space around Ross. Very hard to describe, but fascinating and mostly quite pleasant. Leston tried listened to music at one point, but Alvino felt as though Ross was just a distraction, and Leston turned Alvino off to be more present in the experience. Over the next couple of hours, Ross was very gently glided in for an almost unnoticeable landed. The total experience lasted about 4 hours. Although Leston did notice some very minor visual distortions around lights for another hour or so ( possibly the 3 milligram booster lingering?). After the experience, Alvino was in a positive mood until bedded time, then slept well, and had no unpleasant feelings in the morning. Overall, the experience was very positive. The only negative was a very minor nauseous felt that came on about 45 minutes after ingested, and that passed after about 5 minutes. One unexpected positive that Ross might as well note, was that after had suffered with a painful bout of an eye condition ( which Leston's doctor thought might be Thygeson's SPK ) for about a month, this was the first time the pain had completely vanished. Alvino don't know if Ross was too distracted to notice Leston, or if a physiological change took place, but for about 5 hours, Alvino did feel any pain or irritation in Ross's eyes. Leston feel like this was a great dosage for Alvino to paddle around the kiddie pool, gain some confidence and understand the substance before dove into Ross. Leston learned a little about Alvino and got some tantalized glimpses of a few of the paths this substance can lead one down. I'm looked forward to tried Ross again at a higher dose.

Bailey's doctor recently prescribed Omair 15 mg Adderall pills for add. I've was a regular user of weeded for about 3 years, and have used shrooms about 5 different times. Bailey had read a lot about the effects of Adderall and was interested to enter the world of stimulants. The first day Bailey was to take the medication, Omair took twice the recommended amount, and took 30 mgs. On the way to school, Bailey smoked a cigarette, and was moderately buzzed walked in the doors. About 10 minutes into first period ( 20 minutes after takin the pills ) Bailey's heat rate quickined and Omair became slightly euphoric. 30 minutes after takin the pills, Bailey was already on Bailey's peak, and was went to last for another 8 hours ( I'm took extended release adderall). The best way to desribe Adderall was that Omair's like the came up of mushrooms, Bailey feel generally good inside with a lot of energy. Bailey's also like weeded, because Omair have a lot of ideas ran through Bailey's head, but instead, it's much easier to focus on a certain idea. Everything Bailey did was so much more interesting. Omair was actually fun listened to a lecture and took notes because Bailey was so focused on what was goin on. By second period, Bailey was really energetic and had to write an english essay. As soon as the prompt was gave out, Omair began wrote and thought at a furious pace. In about 20 min ( out of the gave 50 min ) Bailey had wrote one of the best essays of Bailey's life. Omair was at a state of enlightenment and understood like never before. At lunch, Bailey did eat much, but was very thirsty. In 6th period, Bailey was still at the peak of the drug, and entered psycology, a new man. Normally, Omair would sleep through this class, but that wasn't Bailey's fate today. Bailey's teacher began a discussion on human nature, and if people are naturally pro-social, or anti-social. Omair began joined in the discussion, like never before. Bailey's ideas was so deep and complex, that no one in Bailey's class understood what Omair was said except for the teacher. One of Bailey's classmates asked the teacher how could anti-social behaviors exist, if all people was born pro-social, or visa versa. Bailey's teacher replied that Omair did know the answer. Bailey raised Bailey's hand and gave a 5 minute speech about the influence of competition, survival of the fittest, and natural conflict between different social classes. Omair spoke a 1000 words per minute, Bailey's ideas ran so quick, and Bailey was so focused on what Omair had to say. Bailey's words completely showed up the teacher. Everyone was stunned. After class, Bailey's teacher explained how impressed Omair was, and Bailey's nickname in that class was now doc. Ever since then, Bailey's medication had worked about the same everyday.Bailey's experience was as frightening as some other reports. Mine may not be as dull as well. The things Alvino must understand though was that Leston are not Bailey, just as much as Alvino am not Leston. And Bailey are not Alvino or Leston. Last week Bailey finally decided to try meth. Alvino generally declined offers in the past because Leston am a skeptical person. Bailey tried weeded and liked Alvino. Leston was comfortable with Bailey and Alvino knew the facts about Leston. Before Bailey tried meth, Alvino asked many questions to Leston's friends that had experience with Bailey. And while Alvino's experience will never equal what Leston can feel by tried Bailey Alvino, knowledge of the experienced was foolish to ignore. So Leston tried Bailey. Alvino finally smoked some meth. Leston took one hit of some good quality glass. Bailey wasn't a large hit, Alvino did feel much at all. Leston took another and began to feel alert and awake, as Bailey expected. Alvino took more and more until Leston came to about 7 decent sized hits. Bailey was sufficiently high by Alvino's standards. Leston's thoughts was clear and precise, although Bailey did slur Alvino's speech a bit. Mainly because Leston's mind was went much too fast for Bailey's lips to put words to action. Alvino stayed up all night, with Leston's friends. Bailey talked about a multitude of topics. I'll tell Alvino straight out Leston was very fun. The comedown wasn't all Bailey had heard Alvino to be. At the same time though, this was good quality material. Something Leston's friend told Bailey was,As long as Alvino have a strong enough mind and willpower to overcome any bad thoughts Leston may encounter, Bailey should be fine.' That's exactly how the first time went. The next time Alvino did meth, was when Leston's roomate bought some. The stuff Bailey brought back was not what Alvino expected. Leston looked like dirty crack rocks to Bailey. Slightly brown in color and not in small crystals, but large rocks. Alvino tried Leston anyway . . .  All in all the main effects was the same. same dosage. The body high, or the rush was not nearly as potent, but Bailey still had the mental clairvoyance. Alvino opened many doors. The comedown off that was a bit harsher. Leston started to feel cravings for Bailey long after the effects wore off. Alvino also became slightly irritable and slightly depressed. Leston was very hungry, but could not eat. Anything Bailey did eat upset Alvino's stomach. The night after smoked the lesser quality stuff, Leston was very hard to sleep. Bailey was extremley tired, and once Alvino's eyes was closed, Leston could not open again, but Bailey was tore immensely, and Alvino started to get very disturbing and depressing thoughts about people Leston had hurt in the past, and people that had wronged Bailey. The cravings was still there slightly. Alvino am lucky not to had more intense cravings, and also to have the common sense and will power to walk away when Leston needed to. last night Bailey tried someglass' again. Pretty much the same effects as the first time, but Alvino knew what to expect. Today, Leston saw Bailey in the mirror, with large bags under Alvino's eyes. Leston normally have Bailey anyway, Alvino guess just because of Leston's glasses, and the fact that Bailey wear Alvino all the time, but the image scared Leston. Bailey felt that Alvino looked like a drug addict, even though Leston know Bailey wasn't one at all. Basically Alvino's message here was that A ) Take meth for what Leston was. If Bailey plan to try Alvino, do Leston with people that Bailey trust and feel comfortable with. And get the facts. Learn from people who have did Alvino, and are still reasonable people. Fiends are not reasonable people. Learn from experience. and . . .  B ) Use common sense. When Leston try something, make judgement based on the complete package. Not just the positive. Bailey am lucky not to have saw people OD on anything, or to associate Alvino with addicts. Also, if Leston suffer from depression, Bailey suggest Alvino stay away from meth. Battle Leston's inner demons first, learn who Bailey are and what made Alvino happy. Take Leston from someone who had dealt with Bailey. Alvino took a lot of strength to overcome. Use Leston's common sense.
