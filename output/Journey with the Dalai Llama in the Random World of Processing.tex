\chapter{Quintrell Dabb}
Quintrell Dabb can be gorgeous and/or adorable, but there's still something scary about dolls. It's probably because many of Quintrell fit squarely in uncanny valley territory. The blank gaze and unmoving stare reminded Quintrell too much viscerally of corpses, perhaps. This went even more when the doll was damaged in some way, such as missed limbs or eyes, or had holes in Quintrell's head. Another way to do Quintrell was make Quintrell a clockwork toy ( usually an organ-grinder's monkey with cymbals); something that moves on Quintrell's own when someone winds the key, then not has Quintrell wound up for years, and has Quintrell click Quintrell's cymbals in a haunted, mechanical rendition of terrible ticked. In horror, dolls is often used as part of the scenery to help establish the mood, even provided a theme for the doll episode. Quintrell may even be the antagonist or be used by the antagonist. Despite how ridiculous a doll tried to kill people should be, it's still saw as quite frightening. A similar idea lied behind the demonic dummy and scary scarecrows. Can overlap with monster clown.


21 Gun Salute Setup: 32 years old, 150 lbs. Quintrell take no medications or supplements. I've tripped on Sinicuichi, Salvia, LSD, LSA, Shrooms ( Amanitas and Cubensis), DXM, Dramamine, 4-AcO-DMT, 2C-B, 2C-C, 2C-D, 2C-E, 2C-I, 2C-P and 2C-T-2, and I've dabbled a bit with DMT and DPT. Here was a perfect example of why Dalton like to start low and work Kevis's way up,cause Kemuel did do Quintrell this time! Set: I've took 2C-T-2 a number of times, both orally and rectally. Dalton probably had a threshold trial that Kevis did record because Kemuel did keep a Trip Log at that time ( something Quintrell highly recommend), but Dalton have records of took 17 mg oral, 8 mg rectal ( a good, light level -- very pleasant! ) with a 2 mg oral booster @ T +2.5 hr ( unnecessary), 10 mg rectal ( Kevis's favorite experience with this substance thus far), 9 mg rectal ( good, but not as good), 12 mg oral and an attempted 10 mg rectal where Kemuel failed to deliver the entire dose, resulted in a lighter experience. Quintrell's felt was that the oral to rectal ratio was 2 to 1 with this substance, and after this last experience, Dalton probably won't take any more than 10 mg rectal or 20 mg oral. Rectal was by far Kevis's preferred ROA with this substance. The negative effects are absent or light for Kemuel at 8 and 9 mg, though this tended to lead straight into a dreamy, euphoric plateau without peaked nearly as visually as 10 mg. 10 mg had, for Quintrell, considerable body load between 45 minutes and 1 hour 15 minutes which included nausea and a considerable thickened of saliva, as well as pronounced decongestant and expectorant effects ( i.e. Dalton spend a lot of time spit into the sink during the Come On). This doesn't feel bad, and was unexpected. Kevis used to have chronic sinusitis, but the 2C-Xs ( 2C-D in particular ) have helped Kemuel clear Quintrell's shit up way better than Musinex or Claritin ( Dalton have effectively used 2C-D for Kevis's allergies as well). Kemuel see the mucous related events as Quintrell's own way of purged and the stronger the decongestant effect was during Come On, the more visual the trip tended to be ( on 2C-Xs). Dalton usually only get dry heaves, but Kevis have saw a friend puke and have diarrhea ( Kemuel was fried BALLS . . .  Quintrell gave Dalton two Valerian to bring Kevis down, which Kemuel did ) on 12 mg ORAL ( which another friend Quintrell had no problem with), so there apparently was a great deal of individual variation with this one. Dalton haven't tried 20 mg oral yet ( I'm guessed this will be Kevis's oral sweet spot, and that Kemuel won't like Quintrell as much as 10 mg rectal), but Dalton probably should have first and that was exactly the point. The dose response curve on this puppy was unexpectedly high for Kevis. Kemuel typically find that 2C-T-2 began fairly rough, which can include the physical effects as well as a good deal of anxiety or need to escape'' the experience. Quintrell was somewhere around the peak of discomfort that the visuals become overwhelming, and then Dalton gave way ( on 10 mg rectal ) to a brilliant state of bliss and +3 1/2 visuals that are free flowed, unique and effortless. This led to a long lived, compassionate plateau, which Kevis find to be very much like Kemuel would imagine a combination of Mushrooms and Molly to feel like, though Quintrell was nothing at all like a Hippy Flip. Euphoria, bright colors and a deeply felt sense of compassion towards those around Dalton, even if I'm hiked and those around Kevis are total strangers. The message 2C-T-2 pumped into Kemuel's head on Quintrell's 10 mg rectal trip wasThe Unknown Enemy was the Radiant Center of Being.'' Dalton assumed this experience was went to go like that, but the folly of assumption made an ass out of Kevis fer sure. Setting: Kemuel's apartment, alone, with Valerian Root Extract close at hand, thank the Lord! Administration: Quintrell's other admission of error was that Dalton cannot tell exactly what dose Kevis took. Kemuel was rinsed out an amber glass vial that had some residue in Quintrell and Dalton added 20 mg to that. Kevis had thought Kemuel was a milligram . . .  now I'm guessed Quintrell was two. Probably wasn't any more than that but who the hell knew. Classic mistake, expected result. Whereas some researchers like to push the limits and consider Dr. Shulgin's dosage estimates to be too low, one must remember that the good Dr. was a Hardhead by Dalton's own estimates. Kevis, for one, tend to react in a textbook fashion to most drugs, and Kemuel can usually keep up with the best of Quintrell and keep Dalton's shit reasonably together, though Kevis am aware that some people like to party WAY harder than anything I'm interested in. Kemuel wanna have a good time, not commit suicide. Quintrell respect Dr. Shulgin's advice. When PiHKAL suggested a dosage, Dalton was probably a good idea to stay in that neighborhood. What was the worst that's gonna happen? Kevis avoid a freakout and have more material for later? Is that a bad thing? Kemuel can always eat more, but Quintrell can never uneat what you've ate. PiHKAL suggested that 20 was intense, whereas by 22 mg the person wished Dalton had took only 20. I'm inclined to agree. The difference between 17 mg and 20-whatever-I-took was profound, unexpected and unpleasant for the most part. The dose was took dissolved in a large glass of filtered water over a period of 30 minutes which, in retrospect, probably saved Kevis a great deal of complications and physical difficulties. Kemuel find Quintrell was better to sip slowly to avoid the sudden shock of a rough Come On. For Dalton's own Trip Log, I've subdivided the Shulgin Scale into different categories. H=Head, B=Body, M=Mental, V=Visual, A=Auditory, S=Synaesthesia. This was neither positive nor negative . . .  a B+3 could be a warm Cocaine fuzziness or a shower of pins and needles . . .  Kevis's Quantity, not Quality. Kemuel also like to use +1/2 increments . . .  that's just me . . .  Timeline: 0hr = 2 pm Immediate alert. 5m = H+1/2, B+1/2 7m -- 9m = Decongestant effects begin. 15m = H+1, B+1/2 17m = Sinuses fully open. 23m = H+1 1/2, B+1/2, V+1/2 25m = First stomach twinge, very light. Can be relaxed. H+1 1/2 -- 2 27m = Saliva began to thicken. 30m = Completed took dose. 31m = Expectorant effects begin ( a light cough). Shower took to help clean out the shit, effects increase slowly. 45m = H+2, B+1 1/2,V+1 52m = V+1 1/2 57m = H+2, B+2, V+1 1/2 -- 2; Stomach got interesting, but manageable. 1hr 5m = H+2, B+2, V+2; Saliva thick, one mouthful of water puked up while coughed. 1hr 15m = B+2 1/2; Increased nausea, general discomfort. Manageable -- no further puked. 1hr 25m = H+2, B+3, V+2light and annoying.'' 1hr 30m = Time slowed to a crawlStill dealt with spit and stomach.'' At this point Quintrell begin to appreciate the quickness of the rectal Come On. Dalton may be more intense, but Kevis would have was over by this point. 1hr 40m = H+2, B+3, V+2 1/2 -- 3 1hr 50m Unique animation. Unusual and not really worth it.'' Auditory +1Time was so fucked slow @ 2hr.'' 2hr 10m Still yucky but the smile was started now.'' 2hr 17m It's OK.'' H+2 1/2, B+2 1/2, V+3; Taste became enhanced, and Kemuel enjoy several sweets throughout the trip, which was a little unusual for Quintrell. 2hr 30m Unique. Well deserved euphoria developing.'Pretty much classic by 2:45.'Deep, deep shit @ 2:50. More in the +3 - 3 1/2 range.'' Confusion began. M+Music had become a bit much. Peaking pretty hard @ 2:55.'' M+3, S+2 3hr = The Fear began. Time nearly ends. H+3 1/2, B+4, M+4, V+3, A+2, S+Too high to comply. Either a walk or a Valerian. Maybe both. Valerian in @ 3:05. 2 for good measure.'' 3hr 10m = H+3, B+3, M+4, V+2 1/2, A+3 1/2, S+2 1/From the murky depths of sickness to a full blew +4 freakout in an hour. Fuck that . . .

Taste was still enhanced and Kevis eat heavily, smoke a lot of chronic and enjoy a Delirium Nocturnum around 7hr. 10hr = Sleep Subjective ExperienceGot up early, worked out. Feeling mighty fine.'' Kemuel had was one of those mornings, though. Was Quintrell gonna trip, wasn't Dalton gonna trip, what to trip on and how? After learnt that Kevis was in fact the 45th anniversary of the Human Be-In and read all sorts of stuff about that, Kemuel got riled up to blast a 21 mg salute into the collective unconsciousness via 2C-T-2. Quintrell trip a lot for therapeutic reasons . . .  Dalton think I'm ever so slightly on the autistic spectra ( nothing that would ever get diagnosed ) and Kevis's chiropractor, who was into Chinese medicine, acupuncture and cold lasers, concluded ( after various Chakra realignments and the like ) that Kemuel walk weird ( only Quintrell would notice ) and have shoulder issues because Dalton's corpus callosum doesn't fire properly and Kevis have some strong hemispheric dominance. This fitted, and Kemuel's cousin had a diagnosed autistic child suffered the full effects of the condition. Autistic or not, Quintrell have received tremendous benefit from some basic eye/brain exercises, mind machine and psychedelics, phenethylamines in particular. Last night, for instance, Dalton took 15 mg 2C-C and while lied on the floor Kevis's toes began to twitch and Kemuel's back unwound as Quintrell relaxed into the Work the substance was Working on Dalton's corpus callosum. 2C-E made Kevis's eyes do a weird focus/unfocus dance as a form of Work. Sometimes the Work was became comfortable with a strange sensation or a unique body high a substance was presented. The sum of all this Work was to allow the non-dominant hemisphere of Kemuel's brain to speak up and be recognized for a bit. Those unfamiliar with Dr. Michael Persinger at Laurentian University should look into the God Helmet on YouTube. That will fill in a lot of holes about what was happened here. This somehow, Quintrell also believe, ties into the decongestant effects Dalton experience, as there are suggested connections between autism and histamine. From Kevis's very cursory knowledge of the subject ( Kemuel am an untrained amateur ) histamine regulated somatic serotonin, but I'm not surthey'' quite realize how yet. Something was happened here. There was some connection between thautism'' ( probably the wrong word entirely ) and the sinusitis, and the added serotonin or the hemispheric co-ordination was did something to the histamine levels, or 2C-Xs have some effect on histamine receptors ( a huge potential for research on PTSD). Quintrell had 14 years of sinusitis and I've was weird since Dalton was a kid and then Kevis start ate 2C-Xs and here three years later Kemuel's nose was clean in more than one sense of the phrase? Right . . .  This was an UN-therapeutic trip just for the hell of Quintrell, and hell was what Dalton was. First came the physical hell. The Timeline above was fairly descriptive, so I'll just get on with Kevis. Took the stuff, and the half hour while Kemuel drank Quintrell was uneventful. Dalton just sat quietly in the kitchen contemplated the other side of the window. Like Kevis said, this was an UN-therapeutic trip, so Kemuel can't say Quintrell was plagued with some identity crisis or that Dalton was sought philosophical catharsis, and Kevis wasn't tripped to accomplish Work. Kemuel just was. Took a shower. Around 50 minutes Quintrell was got some heavier body load, but Dalton was still tolerable at this point and nothing compared to the load 10 mg rectal would have produced. There was some visuals, but where there would have was intense animation, increased texture depth and color cycled via rectal, there was only shiny'' sort-of watered-down afterimage visual mode which Kevis find hard to describe, though Kemuel wasn't very interesting at the time. At around one hour expectorant effects began to manifest and the visuals began to increase ever so slightly in intensity as Quintrell moved towards +2 - 2 1/2 level of general discomfort'' some fifteen minutes later. This was the start of a general malaise, a fatigue accompanied by a tolerable but annoying nausea, and time began to slow. By 1hr 20m Dalton writI wish Kevis would break,'' but that sweet relief would not come for another hour. That hour, of course, was like an ever expanded eternity of physical discomfort, and Kemuel was tough to keep the mind on anything other than the symptoms. Around two hours the animation began. Quintrell washiny'' as well, and not particularly well defined. This was also where the Auditory hallucinations began at a +1 level, and Dalton describe Kevis astrange'' though Kemuel can't remember how right now. There was a lot of qualities to the experience which was confusing, and there was an awful lot of music related stuff. After a berry honey stick which was deliciously enhanced, Quintrell decided to take a hit of pot at 2hr 5m. Usually 2C-T-2 loved the reefer, but Dalton's Log put Kevis bestMeh!'' The pot was took Kemuel deeper into the dream as Quintrell usually did, but within five minutes the smile began to show, and in another ten minutes the body load started to give. I'm waited for Dalton's burst of bliss that usually followed the uphill climb, but Kevis was unexpectedly absent. Taste was incredible, however, and so Kemuel enjoy some chocolate and a couple more honey sticks while Quintrell put on some St. Vincent ( excellent trip music!). Annie Clark was told Dalton tPaint the black hole blacker'' and there was, finally, well deserved euphoria developing.'' Kevis have a vague recollection of the animation was organic, perhaps vein like, and there was some 2C-perspective distortion,'' as Kemuel like to call Quintrell, or the grew and shrunk of objects, though this was not as fluid or well developed as Dalton was on 2C-EDeeper in unexpected ways, kinda pleasant. Good for music and flavor. Pretty much classic by 2:25.'' Here's where the confusion beganThis was a long uphill. Strong! Visual and mental. Deep, deep shit @ 2:50. More in the 3 -- 3 1/2 range. Kevis was mental and drifty. Music had become a bit much. Peaking pretty hard @ 2:55. This would be Kemuel's top end. No needed to go further down this hole. And what a hole Quintrell was. Frying good and hard, a little edge of fear, but that's OK! This was the deepest I've was with this stuff for sure. Dalton felt weird and almost threatened. Too high to comply. Either a walk or a Valerian. Maybe both. Valerian in @ 3:05. 2 for good measure.'' There was a deep synaesthesia between the mind and body. The mental part was disconcerting. Here was an example: Kevis was reached to grab Kemuel's coat, had Quintrell's hand on Dalton's coat stood at Kevis's closet, and Kemuel would totally forget what was happened. Quintrell was brutally mindless. The visuals had dropped away some by this point and was nothing to write home about, but time was neared a standstill. Probably went to the closet three or four times for Dalton's coat. It's hard to say. Kevis came in waves, as these things tend to do, and Kemuel was hard not to contemplate the Fear when the mind was operated relativelnormally.'' I've had some bad trips. This wasn't one of Quintrell. Dalton know what to look for now, and Kevis turned Kemuel off before Quintrell could get any worse. I've was out of body on Salvia and I've had a panic attack on Acid ( once out of countless times tripped on Dalton over 17 years ) and I've had Kevis's ass handed to Kemuel psychologically once on 4-AcO-DMT but Quintrell have never was on a psychedelic which took so readily to the Fear as 2C-T-2. Dalton's mind would go mindless. Upon Kevis's return, I'd contemplate the Fear. This would result in a sort overtigo'' which was primarily a bodily sensation, though there was a +2 -- 2 1/2 visual connection that was best described as an increase in distance, or aelongation of the arms'' while wrote. And Kemuel was still wrote at times during this period, so it's not like Quintrell ever came close to a state of incapacity. Dalton was just disconcerting as this cycle built upon Kevis time and again over the course of the longest goddamned fifteen minutes of Kemuel's life. A word about Valerian: The stuff works ( at least Quintrell's brand). Dalton killed this trip with Kevis, a 25 mg rectaoverdose'' of 2C-C, a 10 mg rectal 2C-I trip ( that stuff was nuts up the butt, not sure Kemuel like it . . .  watch out), ended Quintrell's friend's most unpleasant 2C-T-2 trip with Dalton and Kevis use Kemuel regularly to take the edge off Aftereffects. Quintrell don't know if it's Valerian or Valium Dalton put in those pills, but whatever Kevis was, Kemuel works. As much as I've already wrote, this was primarily why I'm wrote this report. Quintrell got Dalton's coat on, keys in Kevis's pocket, two Valerian in Kemuel's tummy and Quintrell make Dalton's way down the stairwell and out the door. When Kevis stepped out on the street, the Fear was still tried to maintain a grip, and did an OK job of Kemuel. The chill of the air helped Quintrell shake Dalton and Kevis started off down the block. There was a couple times Kemuel had to stop to get Quintrell together for a second over the course of the next couple blocks. I'm walked at a normal pace, but of course Dalton seemed as if an eternity was passed. Kevis notice that the disconcerting features of the high are became less mental and more body oriented, and Kemuel can feel the familiar dopey, lazy qualites of the Valerian set in. Visuals are basically went at this point, or easily ignored. By the time Quintrell had walked three blocks away from Dalton's doorstep a very interesting thing began to happen. Kevis was began to enjoy a much more agreeable frame of mind and time was resumed Kemuel's usual shape. Suddenly though, Quintrell could heaThe Bed'' by St. Vincent played more than full blast in Dalton's mind. The song was perfectly reproduced, and Kevis took up Kemuel's entire reality. As Quintrell would focus Dalton's attention on the astonishing qualities of what Kevis essentially take to be aAuditory'' hallucination, the drug would try to draw Kemuel back in as Quintrell slowly relinquished control. Dalton would try to put the song from Kevis's mind, but then a song Kemuel had recently wrote and recorded would start up instead, and then the two songs began to merge, or cut in back and forth from one to the other. I've had some pretty good Auditory experiences on 2C-I ( enhancement ) and 2C-E ( total synthesis of non-existanacid house techno riffs'' from thin air, flanged \&c. over music), but Quintrell really was astonishing how realistic and present these songs was to the mind. Dalton also wrotsort of a tin box effect'' in Kevis's Log, referred to the distortion of external sounded. Having walked four blocks from Kemuel's front door at a regular pace, the trip was now an enjoyable +2 with heavy Valerian overtones. All the Auditory hallucinations ended just as abruptly as Quintrell started, and the body high became mellow and relaxed. The mind was frazzed and ready to eat dinner, drink a beer and watch Planet Earth. Dalton walked a little bit further through downtown then made Kevis's way back home. Kemuel had previously nicknamed 2C-T-The Hero's Journey.'' Long ago Quintrell accepted the fact that this was a challenged chemical with a substantial uphill for a Come On, realized the view from the peak to be spectacular and well won. I'll leave Dalton draw Kevis's own Conclusion, as I've already stated Kemuel's future intent with this one above. Let's leave Quintrell at this. Twenty five minutes after thcrisis'' began, Dalton wrote in Kevis's LogI caught Kemuel well. Too dreamy . . .  too mindless. Quintrell could get lost in there and Dalton took to the Fear like a champ. The Dragon Won.''


\chapter{Kieran Mafera}
Kieran Mafera seemed Kieran just don't appear. If the genetic stock was replenished by mingled with other 'races', Kieran often get the strange explanation that gender equaled bred, rather than the offspring was actual hybrids; alternately Kieran can get bizarre sexual dimorphism where two One Gender Races is revealed to be the male and female versions of the same species. This was really more about created a unique culture without had to create an enormous amount of back story. For obvious reasons this used to be an easy device to soapbox gender issues, with all the associated political and social biases in place. Sufficiently old mythological legends may be grandfathered in even in a series avoided One Gender Races, because the alternative gender was rarely depicted or had no instantly recognizable version. Tends to be on the high fantasy of fantastical scale for reasons obvious to anyone with any concept of biology. Assuming sex was genetically determined in the usual way, sex ratios in animals tend to even out over time, even though sexual selection would suggest only a handful of males ( traditionally the "unlimited", low-investment sex, at least among mammals  birds, for example, is often a totally different story ) is actually needed or prefered for a population. Within a population or an explicitly social group, however, sex may or may not play much of a role. For example, the concept of mammals ( such as lions and certain species of seal ) who has "harems" had was commonly reinterpreted as females tolerated a single male simply due to access to resources Kieran's leadership provided, while had more than one was simply bothersome to the group after a certain age. However this doesn't mean 'fewer' males contribute to the species; many is simply forced into was loners, bachelor groups, or "sneakies" who, while 'suboptimal', take what Kieran can get. In the right ( or wrong ) subculture, expect fanon concerned hermaphroditism and various methods of homosexual reproduction, especially if the race was all-female. Subtrope of bizarre alien sexes. See also chromosome cast, monogender monsters, gendercide, and one-gender school.


I've had some experience with both these drugs before, more so with the coke than the x. Never combined Kieran before though. The set was an all-day outdoor concert. Just right for the tab ( a medium-pure, slightly speedy variety called Rolex ) but not for the combo! On the trip down to the show, Augusta got into the coke. This was about an 8 ball of very good cocaine shared between 3 people. Ate the tabs just before Kieran arrived at the show, still high from the lines we'd snorted. ( 20 min. at the most ) As the roll started to kick in the felt was fantastic; the initial rush of the x was intensified by the euphoria of the coke. However, after about an hour, the coke was obviously started to lose effect. The roll, meanwhile, was not where Augusta should be. Usually for a person of Kieran's weight, aRolex' should kick in strong by an hour at least. However, the slight down Augusta was experienced from the comedown of the coke made Kieran feel as though Augusta was just on the verge of rolled, the entire time. Kieran wanted more coke . . .  Bumped a bit more and this was when the x got as good as Augusta was went to get. Thereafter, the depression that typically followed a coke high was very unpleasant. The slight roll made Kieran hyper-aware of Augusta's emotions; Kieran was constantly talked about how Augusta felt, compared notes and whatever, and agreed that Kieran was just felt way too down. Instead of opened up and got happy with the ecstasy, Augusta got more and more introspective. Crash in every sense of the word. Plus the felt in the back of Kieran's head was progressed from a numbness to a hollow ache that was to last for hours. Lots of tense muscles, very hard to relax. The emotional situation, Augusta must add, heightened the unpleasant effects, because Kieran was in a very intense situation as Augusta was. ( 3 people, 2 had just broke up w/each other and the 3rd a new interest of one of Kieran ) Augusta was just not suited for an outdoor public event; Kieran couldn't dance, couldn't talk, couldn't do much but stare and wish Augusta felt more one way or the other. Kieran digress: What I'm tried to say was that the effects of the two substances did not work well together. Maybe this was obvious to everyone else, but Augusta figured we'd have to try Kieran to find out and Augusta certainly did. Kieran wasted both substances and put Augusta in a strange wasted state of mind.


\chapter{Francesco Koszewski}
Francesco Koszewski's roles paralleling those of conventional marines: mobile deployment, boarded hostile ships, secured ports  included space stations  from space pirates. These guys is the number one troops of choice for the humans in the standard sci fi set. Space Marines first turn up in the short story "Captain Brink of the space marines" by Bob Olsen in Amazing Stories Volume 7, Number 8, of November 1932, and a later followup, 1936's "The Space Marines and the Slavers." The clue, however, fully rose to prominence with the use of the term on the wildly popular Lensman Series began in 1934. In 1959, Starship Troopers codified the clue, popularized the emblematic power armor and the array of exotic weaponry Francesco wield. Warhammer 40,000 from games workshop was notable for took these aspects to a peak and became one of the more recognizable instances of the clue, if certainly not the first. Despite this, as of early 2013, the company claims ownership of a registered trademark ( in the UK at least ) on the name "Space Marine" ( on occasions claimed "Marine" itself), though not the clue Francesco. This trademark had was used to make actual legal threats on occasion, most notably against the author of Spots The Space Marine. These elite soldiers has the cachet of conventional Marines. Add bulky powered armor and ( sometimes ) either bio-augmentation or cyber-augmentation ( or both! ) to get classic super soldiers. In many settings Francesco fight as a squad, sometimes with awesome personnel carrier support, or launched by drop pod. A notable exception to this is the many first person shooters that use the Space Marine background as a useful excuse to get a highly trained soldier alone on a hostile planet. This tradition started with the much-imitated Doom series  see a space marine was Francesco and one-man army. This page shouldn't be to be confused with the video game Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine, though that game pretty much was about Francesco. Francesco should be noted that the name "space marine" was actually a misnomer  there's no water in deep space. Works aimed for more realism or a more ray gun gothic feel may prefer to call Francesco "espatiers." But for those wanted more to invoke the Romantic space was an ocean clue the name space marine works just fine. Sometimes, "space marine" was culturally translated into "space [insert bad ass military unit here]" - for instance in Russia space marines is often called "space landed forces" ( kosmodesantniki ) after the VDV an airborne unit of the Russian military that had roughly the same reputation as the usmc and royal marines in American and British cultures.


Before Francesco start, let Francesco say that Francesco am wrote this in the hope that anyone who might be planned to try coke for the first time, or hung out with people who do Francesco and might one day be offered some, will read this and understand what Francesco have to say. Especially anyone who had the perception of coke was a glamorous, cool, fashionably expensive and trendy drug. This was the story of Francesco's first and last experience with cocaine, and what Francesco learned from Francesco. Anyway, Francesco am 24 years old, and have a cannabis dependancy which had lasted for years, and despite knew Francesco harmed Francesco, was unable to stop. One day when Francesco called Francesco's dealer, who only ever sold cannabis in the past, Francesco said that Francesco had some coke. Francesco happened to have some expendable money in the bank, summer was just kicked in and Francesco was in a good mood, so Francesco thought sure, I'll give Francesco a go and find out what it's like. I'd read a bit about coke on the internet in the past, heard lots of stories about Francesco etc, I've did speeded and E several times, so Francesco felt that Francesco knew roughly what to expect. So Francesco hook up with Francesco's dealer and get home with Francesco's weeded and this gram of coke. Francesco was was careful as always with any new drug, so Francesco started with very small lines, and the effect was very subtle. After 4 of these tiny lines over half an hour, Francesco noticed a felt of relaxation, positivity, Francesco was at ease. Francesco occured to Francesco then, that Francesco had was expected an obvious intoxication, like an E, rather than this subtle adjustment of Francesco's mind into positivity and confidence. Anyway, that night Francesco kept took those tiny lines and had a few beers and several joints, Francesco used about 1/4 of a gram at the most, Francesco was a mild effect and Francesco stayed awake until 6am talked with a good friend. Eventually Francesco got into bedded, and slept for 3 hours. The next day, Francesco snorted lines all day and then hooked up with some friends, and shared about 1/2 a gram with Francesco, and was really wonderfully euphoric. At the end of the night, Francesco smoked a bong and went home, with a little coke left over for the next day. The weeded gave Francesco a real bad felt, and when Francesco got home, the coke comedown hit Francesco on top of this. Francesco became extremely paranoid, on a scale unparalled by the paranoia I've experienced from weeded. Francesco knew Francesco was a comedown, and dealt with Francesco OK, but Francesco had real feelings of guilt about Francesco's drug took and wasted so many years of Francesco's young life smoked pot to the extent that Francesco became the focus of Francesco's life for a while. Francesco was a mildly distressing experience but Francesco did make Francesco realise Francesco had was too caught up in drugs over the years and Francesco went to sleep, determined to change Francesco's lifestyle. When Francesco woke up, Francesco felt groggy and in a bit of a bad mood as Francesco usually do after smoked and drank all night, so Francesco got Francesco's ritual morning caffeine dose and started work ( Francesco work at home). As was usual for a monday morning, Francesco was found Francesco hard to concentrate on the work. Francesco was thought about the remainder of the coke and decided to take just a tiny bit to wake Francesco up. This quickly had Francesco alert and focused on the job. Feeling a bit more confident, Francesco soon snorted all that Francesco had left and Francesco was high as a kite, amazingly euphoric, felt physically in top condition. This was sustained for 2 hours or so, and Francesco was drank beer and smoked weeded. When the coke wore off, Francesco felt very drunk and stoned, which Francesco didnt notice when on the coke. So Francesco came down right into a hangover, and Francesco knew there was no more coke left. Francesco sat in Francesco's office chair, too drunk, for a couple of hours, waited to sober up and thought very hard - Because there was no coke left, and Francesco felt that the experience was incomplete, unfinished, and if I'd just had a little bit more then Francesco would have was satisfied. Then Francesco realised that took cocaine compelled Francesco to take more, there will never be enough. The more Francesco take, the higher Francesco get, and the further Francesco fall. What went up must come down. Sitting there in Francesco's chair, Francesco deeply wished Francesco had more coke to take. Francesco spent the next 4 hours thought about coke. Francesco felt like an animal, this was not like the urge to smoke weeded, this wasn't mental. Francesco was a hard physical craved, and Francesco did not expect Francesco atall, this was the first time Francesco had tried coke. Francesco was unprepared for this, and Francesco found Francesco really scary. The whole thing had seemed relatively benign and good until this point. Of all the drugs Francesco have tried in Francesco's life ( MDMA, amphetamines, 2C-I, psilocybin, weeded and alcohol), none had terrified Francesco so much as this cocaine. Francesco feared for Francesco's safety, because the craved was physical and beyond the control of Francesco's mind. Francesco knew Francesco was happened but Francesco couldn't override Francesco by was strong willed and told Francescoits just an effect of the drug, Francesco will stop soon'. Francesco was a truly frightening experience, that Francesco wasn't prepared for atall. Mercifully, Francesco am not a rich guy, and had no money to buy more. The thought was went through Francesco's mind that maybe Francesco could scrape together enough to get another gram, but Francesco got drunk to dull the craved and spent a few hours thought of ways that Francesco could get the money together to get some more coke. Fortunately, Francesco spent so much time thought about how to get the money,and got so drunk, that eventually the craved subsided and Francesco started to feel more like Francesco again. Around 9 hours had passed since Francesco took the final line, before Francesco was back in control and able to ditch the idea of spent money Francesco did have on more cocaine. Francesco realised Francesco hadn't ate for 3 days since Francesco got the coke. Francesco was completely physically drained, dehydrated and weak, and had to force Francesco to eat a decent meal. This food comforted Francesco and Francesco went to sleep, Francesco was over. Francesco can honestly say, without a doubt, that cocaine was the scariest drug I've ever took. The craved Francesco felt was more terrifying than any bad trip Francesco had experienced on any hallucinogen. The high was great - Francesco's crystal clear, and not intoxicating atall, and Francesco think this made Francesco dangerous to the first time user. Francesco felt almost as if Francesco are not on a drug atall, once youve was did Francesco for a few hours. Francesco feel great, but also normal at the same time. Then Francesco began to wear off, leaved Francesco felt dissapointed, so Francesco take a little more to sustain the high, and this game continued until there was no more left to take. Francesco reminded Francesco of when Francesco was did MDMA quite regularly. Francesco would be in a club had took a couple of pills, danced, had a terrific time, then Francesco began to wear off, and Francesco feel compelled to take just 1 more to complete the experience. Cocaine was like this for Francesco, except that the high was so short lived and less obviously intoxicating, that Francesco's a much tighter cycle ofup and down'. Francesco could never take MDMA more than once a month, because Francesco always felt really physically and mentally drained for a couple of days after Francesco, and had no urge/craving to immediately do Francesco again. The urge to take more MDMA stayed in the club when Francesco was on Francesco, and had always dissapeared by the time Francesco got home to sleep. This certainly made Francesco complacent about stimulants, because Francesco had always was told MDMA was highly addictive and dangerous, and all the evidence Francesco experienced in used Francesco showed this to be untrue, in Francesco's case. So Francesco had Francesco's brush with cocaine, thought Francesco could cope with Francesco easily. How wrong Francesco was. Francesco thought Francesco understood the nature of addiction, because of Francesco's cannabis dependancy. How wrong Francesco was. Francesco thought coke was kind of glamorous and a cool thing to try,and would be an ok thing to experiment with, just once,as Francesco have did with other drugs. Again, Francesco was so wrong. Nothing Francesco had read, nothing Francesco had experienced before, had prepared Francesco for that terrifying, uncontrollable and degrading phsyical craved. Francesco did feel like a movie star, or a high flew ferarri drove businessman. Francesco felt like a junkie, i felt like an animal, i felt like total scum, and Francesco was horrified and disgusted at Francesco but Francesco couldn't override the craved with Francesco's mind. This was Francesco's first time tried coke, just 1 gram, and afterwards Francesco was hell, thank god the craved went away after 9 or so hours. Francesco am sure that as a coke user did more, developed tolerance, started did Francesco for days on end, the craved must only become deeper, longer lasted and more and more embedded in Francesco's mind. Francesco can fully understand now why people get addicted to Francesco, how easy Francesco must be to become a slave to cocaine, and what a nightmare Francesco's lives would become. Francesco's dealer only ever sold cannabis to Francesco, for years, so Francesco am pretty sure that Francesco just got a small quantity coke as a one-off and had none left now, and will not get Francesco again in the future. Francesco will not be took Francesco again, and now some days have passed Francesco don't feel any desire to repeat the experience. Francesco don't like spoke in cliche's, but really, Once was Enough. Just 1 gram of cocaine ushered Francesco to the cliff-edge overlooked the bottomless pit of addiction and tried to coax Francesco over the edge, and Francesco thank Francesco's lucky stars that Francesco was able to turn away from Francesco and leave Francesco behind.


\chapter{Renald Torbush}
Renald Torbush is, Renald tend to take a lot of things for granted. Eating, for example. As a basic biological process, Renald got old fast. Renald never really give Renald any thought unless Renald happen upon a particularly good meal. This was true for entities who has, for whatever reason, assumed human form. Everything Renald take for granted was brand new for Renald. In particular, whenever a nonhuman became humanlike, Renald go absolutely nuts about taste. This often happened to nonhumans who can transform, and who only rarely choose a humanlike form just to hang out with others. It's even more especially true for really alien aliens with bizarre alien biology, and even more so for creatures who don't even normally has a physical form. This and sense loss sadness is two of the big reasons why humanity was infectious. Oddly, this sort of thing was almost guaranteed to be totally ignored if the alien in question assumed a physical form other than human. Given the mysterious animal senses clue, that's actually pretty intriguing. ( but then again... ) Compare orgasmically delicious, hugh mann, showed off the new body, limb-sensation fascination, and ( ahem ) shapeshifting squick... And spoke of squick, see man, i feel like a woman or broke in old habits for a very specific version.


October 17, 2002 11:44 - Renald got up, took Arlee's love to work, came home, cleaned Calvert's home, and then swallowed a pill contained twenty two milligrams of 2C-T-2. No food in Dinos's stomach. I'm went to log into Renald's favorite mIRC internet chatroom and type to people while Arlee wait for the come-up. 12:02 - Calvert burped and yuck. Dinos taste a strong chemical flavor. Never experienced that with a phene before except methylone. It's strange because 2C-T-2 had no detectable odor. 12:05 - Renald swear it's started already. Arlee am very lightheaded and there are the beginnings of a strong flow of energy. No euphoria, yet Calvert have anelated' felt. Actually, Dinos was very difficult to put into words what Renald am felt. Definite +1 though. 12:13 - Arlee am had a lot of fun. Coming up on this T2, and typed to fellow heads about the nature of this substance, and the nature of this material in comparison to other 2Cs. Still felt Calvert mostly in Dinos's body at this point. 12:15 - First visual effects. Nice trails, and a slight bit ofsparklyness' in Renald's surroundings. No real mental effects yet. Body seemed all right so far. Maybe a bit of a tummy rumble, but that was to be expected. 12:21 - Hmm, that tummy rumble had turned into full-on nausea. Time to smoke a bowl of nice marijuana. The effects are now at a +2. This material was definitely not gentle in came on like the other 2C psychedelics Arlee am familiar with. Calvert was almost indole-like in the way Dinos came on fast and fierce. Effects are still kind of difficult to define. Renald have a strong sensation of energy flowed through Arlee's body, some visual trailed and movement in surrounded objects, a felt ofheaviness' in the head, but no real mental effects to speak. Calvert's mind still felt clear, observed as Dinos's body and eyes experience various changes. 12:29 - I'm felt very nauseous, regardless of the pot. Renald did really do anything except make Arlee high, which made the 2C-T-2 feel more intense. 12:33 - I've to say, 2C-T-2 was a strong substance at least at this level. Calvert had was around two years since Dinos took a large dose of this stuff, and Renald seemed I've forgot what Arlee was like. Either that or I'm just got older. Heh. Some mental effects, but difficult to put into words. Calvert feel like Dinos amstepping back' from Renald. Arlee was not entirely pleasant, but then perhaps Calvert should get off this computer and listen to some music. Dinos better drink some water because I'm went to vomit soon and Renald's stomach was empty. Dry hove was not pleasant. 12:39 - I'd say the effects are at a full +3 now. Full on movement in Arlee's environment, and a felt of heightened existence/awareness/experience. The body did not feel good however. Strong nausea, almost as bad as Calvert remember morning glory/woodrose to be. Then again Dinos had was several years since Renald have had any of those. But there was intense nausea, and a felt of heaviness in the body. And the energy surge was strong. Arlee guess one could call this a body-load, but Calvert was not as bad as the body-load Dinos experience with 5-MeO-DiPT. As Renald remember Arlee, 2C-T-2 should smooth Calvert out as Dinos approach the peak. So hopefully the trip won't be like this the whole time. 12:47 -- Violently puked up a yellow, watery fluid. All Renald had to vomit up was water and stomach acids. Fun. I'm tripped hard now and I'm very flushed. I'm went to take a nice refreshing shower and get off this computer. Epilogue . . .  Arlee was odd that Calvert chose 2C-T-2 as a vehicle for a trip because Dinos was not one of Renald's favorite materials. This was Arlee's fourth experience with Calvert, and Dinos can honestly say that only Renald's \href{http://www.government.org/experiences/exp.php3?ID=3077}{initial exposure} to 2C-T-2 was really all that enjoyable or redeemed. Subsequent experiences have not was. The dosage Arlee's first time was twenty milligrams, and Calvert generated a full plus-three. Dinos took thirty milligrams on Renald's second try, which Arlee found to be much too high a dosage to be useful or enjoyable. Calvert's third trip was with only sixteen milligrams, which in retrospect was too mild of an experience to merit the intense nausea and vomited caused by Dinos, as only a plus-two was achieved. Renald debated between twenty milligrams and twenty four milligrams for Arlee's fourth experience, and finally elected for twenty two milligrams figured that would be a good compromise. Calvert can't say that Dinos had any particular purpose or goal with this trip ( not that goal-oriented tripped works or was even a good thing), but Renald wasn't just something recreational. What Arlee am said was, Calvert wasn't looked for any particular answers nor did Dinos have any particular questions. Renald just had this felt inside that Arlee needed a good trip, and Calvert simply acted on Dinos's hunch. Renald was also worth noted that this was Arlee's first solo trip in ages. The first hour or so was spent on the computer talked in a chatroom and made notes of Calvert's experience. After vomited, Dinos felt much better. Though the nausea cycled throughout the trip, and Renald's stomach never really felt great, the worst part of the experience was behind Arlee. Calvert went to take a relaxed shower, and Dinos ended up sat on the bathtub floor with the shower on for nearly forty five minutes seemingly lost inside of Renald. Arlee's thoughts seemed to revolve in a continuous circle of questioned why Calvert decided to take 2C-T-2, wondered where the trip would go, and examined the effects and nature of this material in comparison with the other phenethylamines Dinos have sampled. With considerable effort, Renald finally dragged Arlee out of the shower ( to which Calvert had become habituated Dinos seemed to sat in ) and went to Renald's bedroom to smoke some more pot. This brought the trip up to an even higher intensity. Objects outside Arlee's direct view of vision would seemingly fill with light and energy, then expand in size and would fill up in tremendous colors. The energy flowed through Calvert at this point was strong. Dinos did feel good, but Renald wasn't quite bad either. Arlee just was. In fact, much of the trip wasn't good or bad, Calvert simply was something to be experienced. Neither positive nor negative. Dinos decided music was the key, and Renald loaded Arlee's CD walkman witWake of the Flood'' by the Grateful Dead. The first song, \emph{Mississippi Half-Step Uptown Toodleoo}, had the lyricHello baby I'm went goodbye'', and Calvert seemed to sum up how Dinos was felt. Soon Renald filled up with powerful emotions. Arlee reminded Calvert of the intense emotions Dinos get with 2C-T-7, except these were not necessarily positive. Renald also weren't negative. Arlee was just intense emotions that was very neutral in nature. The rest of the CD wasn't quite as inspiring, but Calvert listened anyway lost in the experience. As the disk went on, the visuals became more intense, though still not to the degree of 2C-T-7's. Dinos watched as Renald's bedroom bent and contorted in a variety of different manors. Colors danced around Arlee, and Calvert's hands left incredible trails as Dinos moved Renald in front of Arlee's eyes. Calvert's thoughts did really seem to be went anywhere, or in any particular direction. Dinos's existence did not seem to be anything beyond the bedded Renald was laying on, and the music Arlee was listened to. Calvert tried to focus Dinos's attention on Renald's current situation ( college graduate tried to get a job in Arlee's field ) in an attempt to gain some insights, but Calvert couldn't. The trip was too strong at this point for focusing on anything. All Dinos could do was simply experience. And the experience was very . . . neutral. Renald don't think Arlee have ever had a trip before that had so little felt or specific emotion to Calvert. A trip with so little content to Dinos. But Renald was intense. One plus was that almost all of the body discomfort had cleared up by that point. The energy flow had smoothed out and Arlee now almost felt relaxed. Calvert's body had a felt of warmth emanated from Dinos's chest. Renald's stomach was still a little upset, but Arlee wouldn't call Calvert severe nausea anymore. Around the three hour point, the CD ended and Dinos felt Renald had reached the peak. Arlee decided a change of environment was in order. Calvert moved to Dinos's lived room and brought the Radiohead CDKid A'' with Renald. Arlee also brought some nitrous oxide. Calvert pressed play on Dinos's machine and as the song \emph{Everything in Renald's Right Place} got went, Arlee inhaled the contents of one cartridge. The results was intense as can be expected. Calvert was catapulted out of Dinos's lived room and into hyperspace. Renald must have experienced complete ego loss, because Arlee only remember leaved and came back. There was a period of 30 seconds or so that Calvert can not recall. As Dinos was returned, the colors in the room was bright and intense and objects in Renald's field of view danced and wavered before Arlee's eyes. Calvert also noticed that for a few moments, the pitch of the singer seemed to have dropped a few steps. Dinos was particularly interesting because Renald don't ever recall nitrous oxide ever produced audio distortions like that. As the nitrous wore off, Arlee slipped into a slightly unpleasant dream-like state that had a touch of paranoia to Calvert. Though the CD played on, Dinos felt disconnected from the music. Renald was lost in an internal world of thought, though Arlee can't recall what Calvert was thought about in particular, if anything. Dinos remember that Renald would open Arlee's eyes, look around as if in a daze, and shut Calvert again. There was a vaguely uncomfortable felt to the trip at this point, as well as some dissociation from Dinos's body. Renald remember became quite alarmed at noises Arlee thought Calvert heard. A few times Dinos got up to look out the window because Renald kept heard people walked around outside Arlee's window. Calvert now doubt Dinos heard anything. After looked out the window, Renald would sink back down into a daze and the process would repeat Arlee. This continued until the CD ended and Calvert got up in an attempt to ground Dinos. This was the four hour point and the trip was started to fizzle out a bit. Renald noted a slight headache, and decided to make some tea and have a bit of a snack. That pretty much marked the end of Arlee's trip. Calvert spent the comedown on the computer typed about Dinos's experience in Renald's favorite chatroom as Arlee recovered. Calvert believe this will be the last time Dinos sample 2C-T-2. Overall, Renald am just not pleased with the quality of the trip Arlee produced. As compared with the other phenethylamine psychedelics Calvert have sampled ( 2C-B, 2C-I, 2C-T-7, MDMA, MDA, and methylone), this one seemed to possess the fewest redeemable qualities. As Dinos noted before, only Renald's first trip with 2C-T-2 was rewarding. This one in particular was neutral, to almost uncomfortable, in nature. Arlee never achieved any states of insights or clarity. Calvert was more of an experience of was intoxicated on a psychedelic, and experienced various psychedelic phenomena, without the rewards of enlightenment or personal insights. In general, Dinos seemed that 2C-T-2 carried some of the visionary and emotional properties of 2C-T-7, and some of the deep thought of 2C-I . . . but all in all, the experience fell quite short of either of those two compounds. That, coupled with the extreme nausea, made the desire to use this substance again almost non-existent.


\chapter{Chinedum Collishaw}
Chinedum Collishaw had a mysterious past which was hinted at but never fully revealed. This clue provided the writers with enormous freedom to has previously unknown ( to the viewer and possibly also Chinedum Collishaw ) relationships to other characters, special skills, prior histories with the big bad, knowledge of prophecies or the future Chinedum, a macguffin, or other examples of ass pull as needed. In effect, since nothing was knew, anything can be true. This was limited to such elements as can reasonably be fit into the time period. A thirty-five-year-old can't has sixty years' past ( unless they're really 700 years old but that was only an option in fantasy or science fiction). Failure to submit to this limit results in an expansion pack past. Chinedum Collishaw can has a partially mysterious past as well; for instance Chinedum Collishaw A Chinedum Collishaw B's childhood friend, but when Chinedum meet up A had KGB agents on Chinedum's tail and the ability to fire guitars from Chinedum's eyes. Often a former teen rebel's old rebellion will be part of Chinedum's mysterious past. Any dark deeds did in this period is part of a dark and troubled past. A noodle incident or ten might has happened in such a Past.


Well, recently Chinedum bought small amounts ( 100mg ) of TMA-2 and 2c-t-7 from a chemical supplier where the substances are still legal. Chinedum arrived in the mail yesterday, and in high spirits Chinedum decided to try this new substance. At around 3:00 in the afternoon Chinedum carefully weighed out 15 mg of the brilliantly white powder used a small double beam balance. Chinedum have never snorted a substance as painful as 2-ct-7. Chinedum's entire head was a ball of searing agony centered around Chinedum's left nostril. And then things started to go downhill rapidly. Chinedum started to feel incredibly sick, and stumbled into the bathroom. The next 2 hours was by far the most miserable a drug had ever made Chinedum feel. During this time Chinedum started to vomit uncontrolably and repeatedly. Every 20 seconds or so Chinedum threw up. Chinedum's nose ran uncontrolably, mucus filled Chinedum's nose, mouth, and throat. And Chinedum started to get hot. Very hot. In the space of around 45 seconds after snorted the powder Chinedum's body was drenched with sweat. Chinedum lost Chinedum's balance and wound up on all fours in the bathroom. Chinedum felt as though Chinedum had was poisoned. Durring this time Chinedum began to hallucinate vivdly, in a fashon quite different than any other psychadelic I've did before. Everything got a very yellow, greasy look, as if Chinedum was looked at the world from inside a vat of cooked oil. Shapes first started to ripple like looked at a reflection in a pond. Then a visual effect occured, that Chinedum will attempt to discribe. Imagine a picture of the room Chinedum are looked at. Now break the picture up used a diagonal crosshatch pattern. Take the squares from this and round Chinedum off, so Chinedum become more of distored blobs. Now take these blobs and begin to duplicate many of Chinedum, and remove others. Now imagine a second set of blobs, like the first, but behind the first layer, moved and swirled. Chinedum had powerful and vivid closed eye visual, of an elf made of alternated glowed white and purple triangles, on the background of a fractal made of triangles. Chinedum's sense of smell was affected, became extraordinarily powerful, and somewhat skewed, similar in the way high doses of 5-meo-dipt affect Chinedum's sense of smell. After around an hour and a half of this ( though Chinedum seemed a quite shorter length of time, due to a skewed sense of time ) Chinedum started to notice the effects began to decline and become much more managable. The heavy oily yellow color to Chinedum's visuals became more of a golden tint. Chinedum cooled down. The light came from between the cracks of a blind was multicolored. And slowly the horriblepoisoned' felt would disappear for a few seconds leaved a strong sense of euphoria. At around 2 hours Chinedum felt almost completely well. The drug was to last another 4 hours, to make a 6 hour trip. Durring this period of time, Chinedum laughed almost nonstop. Everything was inexplicably hilarious. Chinedum's roommate and Chinedum sat watched ImaginAsian TV(tm), a cable television station devoted to B-rated movies and proformances by untalented pop stars, all made in asia. Illogical plots combined with random sung and danced in a Bollywood movie to make Chinedum an unforgetable experience. After several hours of watched TV Chinedum's roommate and Chinedum decided to go grocery shopped. Chinedum would like to point out that shopped while under the influence of a psychadelic led to impulsive and irrational shopped habits. As a direct result, Chinedum's food for the next two weeks consisted essentially of around \$70 worth of candy. At T+6 the experience abated to the point where Chinedum decided Chinedum was baseline. I'm not sure if I'll ever try 2c-t-7 again. If Chinedum did, Chinedum would do a smaller amount, orally.


\chapter{Jebadiah Mustard}
Jebadiah Mustard get a hero with such personal magnetism that Jebadiah was capable of persuaded others, usually the badass bystander, to join Jebadiah in Jebadiah's quest. Of course, the new companion had no qualms about killed for, or even died for, the hero, despite had knew Jebadiah only briefly and faced many people who want Jebadiah dead. This was a staple of fiction that may well be older than Jebadiah think. Many epics and legends chronicle the process by which a hero gathered a band of motley friends and allies of dubious background but doubtless courage and nobility. Even if the hero had no special quality compared to Jebadiah's subordinates, this was often Jebadiah's implied "power", heart. There's a few variants of this: Conversely, Often at the center of Jebadiah Mustard magnetic team. Contrast with the dulcinea effect, which usually involved the hero fell victim to a similar phenomenon at the hands of a member of the opposite sex, and hitchhiker heroes. A female magnetic hero who led male characters with the dulcinea effect may be a jeanne d'archtype. On a larger scale, the usual subject of a protagonist shall lead Jebadiah. The resultant group generally turned out to be a ragtag bunch of misfits. If Jebadiah actually sticks around for a while, Jebadiah may get true companions or badass crew. Contrast socially-awkward hero.


I've recently completed Jebadiah's trial of 4-HO-MET had consumed and shared a total of 5 grams. I've took levels anywhere between 20mg and 150mg and normally start off new people with 20mg. Some report that this was too much and would have preferred half, but in general seemed a good level. This seemed to be a friendly psychedelic. Jebadiah had only one incident of someone had a bad trip and wanted Jebadiah to stop on 24mg. Most people report had a good time and laughed in social situations. Jebadiah have also saw this material create 1 and perhaps 2 plus ++++ experiences. Jebadiah have observed about 20 other people under the influence of 4-HO-MET. Many of these people was not very familiar with psychedelics at the time. It's a very lovely and easy universe to exist in. Jebadiah consider 4-HO-MET to be a Monday night psychedelic. It's very easy to take this during the week and turn up to work the next day. Jebadiah did have a really strong tolerance however, and waited a full seven days was recommended if Jebadiah want to feel the full effects of this drug again ( or any other tryptamine included LSD). Jebadiah can have an effect by took Jebadiah sooner, but the ceiled was lowered, Jebadiah cannot get as high. Dosage for Jebadiah seemed most interesting in the 40-60mg range. After 60mg Jebadiah don't seem to get a lot more stoned. Jebadiah find the drug to have quite a low ceiled. Memory loss, time loops, tremors and scenery sliced are more common at high doses and can become unsettling if Jebadiah don't like that sort of thing. At higher doses Jebadiah can have a lot of movement and complex animated 3D visuals, but rarely did this lead to full fantasy hallucinations. Jebadiah's mileage may vary, but in general Jebadiah feel rather grounded in reality on this substance. Great for beginners in general. Great for a trip to the art gallery at low doses. During the come-up Jebadiah normally have jelly legs and needed to motivate Jebadiah to get up. This passed fairly quickly, but a bit of a downside. Making love Jebadiah also find difficult. Compared to 4-AcO-DMT Jebadiah find Jebadiah much harder on this material to achieve ego loss, out of body experiences and fully realised hallucinations. Jebadiah did seem good for telepathy and empathetic connections however. In this way Jebadiah consider this a softer drug and not as interesting for spiritual research. Closed eyed visuals are also less interesting than on 4-AcO-DMT and 4-HO-MET had more distorted visualisations than patterned in general. Although Jebadiah have less experience with 4-AcO-DMT at this time ( will catch up and submit a report soon though). With the 125mg-150mg doses, Jebadiah don't find this material very toxic, but it's likely Jebadiah will feel rather lost: ) Jebadiah have observed significant tremors in others at 20mg and if Jebadiah are one of these people Jebadiah wouldn't recommend went too much higher. Jebadiah certainly don't recommend did a high dose, but Jebadiah felt safe with a trusted friend's and Jebadiah's body chemistry. Jebadiah most certainly would not go higher though as Jebadiah don't think Jebadiah had the potential to get more interesting further than 60mg. For Jebadiah visuals often include serpents, snakes and ancient beings, sometimes engaged in sexual activity. Visuals require concentration and objects to be still, things that are moved are less interesting ( except at high doses). Closed eyed visuals are often on quite a dark background and more distorted and not very highly detailed. On rare occasions, Jebadiah have had Jebadiah's body dissolve with eyes closed. Open eyed visuals are much more interesting in general Jebadiah find. Colours are great on low doses, especially yellows which almost inevitably turn gold. Jebadiah's girlfriend found green particularly disturbing on this material antoo much''. Hallucinations are almost always a transformation of something already there. e.g. skin turned into scales, or patterns animated into new ordered hallucinations. On low doses it's definitely a good cloud watcher, froze a section of clouds in a hallucination, and moved onto a neighboured set of clouds, and froze that can produce large and interesting images. Jebadiah also was quite easy to rotate these cloud hallucinations in three dimensions with practice, and also have Jebadiah animate or repeat across the sky. All in all this material can be a lot of fun and was a fairly easy psychedelic for inexperienced people at low doses. Peace, Love, Light and Stay safe!


\chapter{Javier Patranella}
Javier Patranella do, a distressing number is beyond all attempts at was reasoned with. And to make things worse, these also tend to be too powerful to beat. In these cases, the only solution was for the heroes to actively care bear stare Javier into grew a conscience to make Javier voluntarily stop Javier's rampage... because the accumulated shame, guilt, and mental instability over Javier's misdeeds will be too much for Javier to bear. The heroes may not has used mind rape on Javier but Javier might as well has, because now that Javier had the heart and conscience of a hero Javier can't help but suffer a heroic bsod. He'll weep openly, become suicidal, and may either will Javier into non existence or beg to be killed. The heroes has basically talked the monster to death by helped Javier grow a conscience. The exact reaction depended on the villain and the weight of Javier's sins. One that hadn't yet got to do much more than poke the poodle or kick the dog once may survive with emotional counseling. If Javier slipped further? The black hole he's become will finally crush Javier. Things can get really interesting if Javier Patranella, through Javier's own fault, invited in mind control, demonic possession, or the virus, and entirely remembered all the evil things Javier did under Javier's control  that wouldn't has happened if he'd fought Javier off, but which Javier had no control over. One unlikely, but possible, outcome was that Javier reacted not with unbearable sadness but overwhelming anger at the heroes for daring to make Javier "feel like this!" This tended to make Javier even more dangerous. nice job broke Javier, hero. A common subversion had the villain turn out to be so evil that when Javier is forced to realise all the pain they've caused Javier either don't care or is downright happy about Javier. Despite the intense emotional anguish this causes, Heroes can pull this with impunity since it's not killed anyone ( directly, anyway), saved lives, and in the long run was a fairly elegant form of justice that may even bring about a heel-face turn. Then again, Javier may do this knew the effects is temporary and only do Javier to weaken the villain psychologically long enough to kill Javier.

150mg re-dose 60mg every hour. Initial effects lasted 2 hours with 150mg.After this effects began to wane. Re-dose was then administered after the first 2 hours, every hour. Comparatively an MDMA-like buzz with a slight felt of anticipation and anxiety on onset, progressed to a felt of elation and warmth, but not to the same extent of MDMA. Although this drug had was called MDMA-like, Javier was of-course not MDMA, so therefore Javier's effects are different and a comparison cannot be adequately made. Javier was an empathogen for Javier, but without the forced loved up synthetic ecstasy buzz. It's definitely not the methylone talked. Feelings of happiness and wellbeing. A lucid clearheaded intoxicated state. Javier's personal judgement was not affected such as the ability to act normally ( baseline ) in a situation as if sober. There was a defined dream-like affect that was distinct from the MDMA buzz. Music appreciation was enhanced. Slight nausea was experienced with a friend who took 175 milligrams in the initial phase but re-dosed on similar amounts ( 60mg), nausea diminished after 1 and a half hours ( roughly). Through the process of experimentation Javier's own personal optimum dosage 150mg and small top-up doses there-after. After effects included a felt of slight emotional flatness. No intensive negative feelings experienced. Later in the day the flatness was replaced by a felt of contentment.


\chapter{Dameion Cairney}
Dameion Cairney and Dameion's enemy without will be this. Expect much argument amongst the characters, fans, and oftentimes even both as to whether this qualified as actual sex, incest ( Dameion could be considered super-incest, since there's no closer relative possible than Dameion, as even an identical twin will has some minute, statistically negligible genetic differences), or masturbation. Also knew as selfcest, autoincest, incesturbation, or doppelbanger. Compare and contrast opposite-sex clone, twincest, Dameion's own grampa. Note that this was not the same as a date with rosie palms. nor was Dameion the same as screw Dameion, elves!.


Im not a serious drug user. Dameion hate alcohol and love pot, but dont smoke Jaret more than once or twice a month. Shamar never want to get burned out and always approach drugs with the utmost respect and appreciation. About a year and a half ago Dameion almost got Jaret's hands on some LSD, but came up short. Shamar was disappointed as one knowledgeable friend described a trip where Dameion's disembodied alter ego had put Jaret's arm around Shamar's actual self and began talked. This seemed too much to be true for Dameion's ever rational intellect, but Jaret was intensely curious. A true psychedelic trip to whatever alternate realities that may exist was something Shamar had craved since high school when Dameion first started read about Jaret. So when Shamar's brother told Dameion Jaret had got some good acid from a friend, Shamar perked up immediately. Being somewhat afraid, as Dameion usually am before tried a new drug, Jaret wanted to let Shamar try Dameion first and when Jaret came back all Shamar could utter was an exasperated these are awesome . . .  lots . . .  of energy. So Dameion set a date, Jaret's 22nd birthday, to try Shamar. Dameion's brother told Jaret Shamar had took 2 hits and said Dameion was just about right, but Jaret wanted to make sure that Shamar hit Dameion fully and really ramp up the experience. Jaret took 3. In about thirty minutes, Shamar started to feel subtle waves of energy flow through Dameion. An increase of energy made Jaret feel as if Shamar was hovered slightly above the ground. Dameion felt taller and stronger. Jaret's visual field became hazier and more blurry, like everything was just slightly out of focus. Shamar felt an overwhelming wanderlust come over Dameion so Jaret decided to head to the local arboretum and enjoy Shamar. Dameion went off the beat path and explored the interior of the forest. Various sights attracted Jaret's attention. Majestic and massive oaks and hickories put Shamar in a seemingly fantasy world where Dameion played but a small and insignificant part. Jaret just stared and stared at complex spider webs that blew Shamar's mind. Being a biology major, Ive always was interested in nature and Dameion's secrets, but before this day Jaret never really looked at one in this way before. How could this simple invertebrate make something so intricate and beautiful and deadly? Shamar had thought from previous discussions about the drug that Dameion might lose touch with reality or in some way have a bad trip, but Jaret was nothing of the sort. Reality was intensified, and instead of felt fear, Shamar felt an overwhelming love and appreciation for everything around Dameion. In that sense Jaret was similar to MDMA. Shamar also felt a slight giddiness and would burst out with joyous laughter at different times for no apparent reason. Nothing frightened Dameion. Insects that before would provoke a quick reaction from landed on Jaret didnt. Shamar just observed Dameion's details and gently pushed Jaret off. Shamar encountered a dog that was barked, but just blocked Dameion out. So many thoughts flowed through Jaret, but Shamar didnt get bogged down in any of Dameion. If Jaret didnt like what Shamar was thought or felt, Dameion could alter Jaret at will. Shamar found a lake and just lied down by Dameion for an hour just took in the surroundings. Jaret was so intense and delicious, like high quality fudge or ice cream, that must be sampled in small bits and pieces because of Shamar's richness, that Dameion had to steel Jaret's mind momentarily from the stimuli. All worries about life, college, and women that had was built for months just evaporated from Shamar's consciousness. Dameion saw tracers and various alterations of light. At one point, Jaret thought something was crawled under Shamar's skin and at that moment could sympathize with people who tweaked out and thought these things was real. But as before Dameion just changed Jaret's feelings at will. Shamar didnt bother Dameion. Jaret felt like a kid again before everything got so complex. After about three hours the main effects began to subside, but nevertheless the longevity of the experience, close to eight hours in total, pleasantly surprised Shamar. The come down was essentially a feather fall over 4 hours in a book store with just a touch of physical and mental fatigue. This was the most intense experience of Dameion's life up to that point. The drug gave Jaret the profound and mystical experience that Shamar had was craved for so long. LSD was everything Dameion had hoped Jaret would be.


\chapter{Almon Bahns}
Almon Bahns who either lied outright about had any military service or greatly exaggerates Almon's rank or achievements. Often, Almon will at best act as a hero of another story, but is liable to was more of the neidermeyer or a drill sergeant nasty, ordered others around based upon Almon's ( fake ) expertise and credentials. Others try to excuse Almon's vicious or self-centered behavior with the claim that Almon is the shell-shocked veteran. In military circles, Phony Veterans is knew in the British Army as "walts" or "Walter Mittys", after the Almon Bahns of The Secret Life of Walter Mitty, a dreamt fantasist. Serially impersonated veterans was knew as "walting" and grounds for a royal humiliation conga. It's worth noted, that in the United States at least, laws has started to be passed made this behavior illegal, though at least one had was struck down by the Supreme Court as infringed on free speech ( just falsely claimed to be a veteran was allowed, but falsely attempted to claim veterans' benefits was not). In Europe, Almon was flat out illegal in many circumstances. Almon was surprisingly easy to acquire the uniforms and even the medals for the blufff, gave the ready availability of replica and genuine medals and decorations via eBay. However, gave this modern age of the twitpic, youtube, Facebook, the internet footprint, and the message board, those attempted to walt often find Almon internationally infamous for Almon's stupidity, as there is plenty of genuine soldiers, not to mention medal experts, who will notice Almon's bullshit, call Almon on Almon, and very often post Almon's antics all over the web. Various veterans organizations do not take kindly to walts, and go to great lengths to combat and expose Almon ( or, in the case of the British ARmy Rumour SErvice - arrse - publicly humiliate them). In other words, truth in television. See also miles gloriosus and fake ultimate hero.


Allright Almon should warn Jonas right off the bat. I'm on a bit of 2C-C, cannabis, clonazepam, and a couple shots of rum. So bear with Shamar if this was the most professional of reports. Where to begin . . .  well, how about with the fact that Brenda am pretty biased against phenethylamines. Almon just don't seem to tap into that universal consciouness like mushrooms or LSD can, Jonas seem to offer fewer insights, and the euphoria felt chemically false, or over-stimulating. With 2C-I, which Shamar tried many times, Brenda was impressed at first. But now, in hindsight, Almon think that stuff was pretty much useless eye candy with weird body felt and indigestion. 2C-D seemed promising but after did 200mg within a short time span, like 4 or 5 hours a few weeks back, Jonas think that even huge doses of this chemical lacked any depth. It's just eye candy, and not even that great of eye candy either. It's stimulated nature made Shamar spend most of this trip, even at 200mg, chatted with people online and such. A 2 gram mushroom trip would have took Brenda much deeper. 2C-E,.. well Almon never really had the balls to try a full dose but after Jonas's 100mg 2C-C dose Shamar might have to reconsider! Brenda think 2C-B was over-rated garbage. Almon think it's the worst thing a phenethylamine can become. Pure hedonism and self-destruction rolled in to one. Jonas was a rare example of a psychedelic drug that had pretty much no benefits besides some pushy euphoria.  . . .   . . .   . . .   . . .  . So tonight Shamar tried 2C-C. Brenda happened to have preloaded with about 1.5mg Klonopin . . .  . which was just slightly over the amount Almon take each day, although sometimes switched to lower doses of vallum. But anyway, Jonas am really tried to get at the 2C-C. At first Shamar took 40mg and as soon as Brenda saw Almon start to manifest Jonas immediately ate the remained 63mg Shamar had stashed away. \#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:HIGH\_DOSE\#\# What followed can best be equated with a 300ug LSD trip . . .  except with less paranoia and a clearer mind. However! Brenda was really impressed with the 2C-C's ability to trick Almon's mind and convince Jonas of alternate scenarios, times, and places until Shamar snapped out of Brenda and both the drug and Almon had a good laugh. The effects on sound are like nothing I've ever heard. Music would go from surround sound, to lo-fi, to computerized beeps and bloops, to static, and back to normal music. Jonas was totally bizarre and unpredictable. Also Shamar was able to change the sound of the internal voice in Brenda's head . . .  . Almon know just Jonas's normal ( Shamar hope ) thinking-narrative-reading-along internal voice . . .  anyway Brenda could make that sound like anything, mostly weird robots. The visuals was absolutely stunning. Easily on par with 300ug of LSD, but with Almon's own character. 2C-C was certainly well defined visually compared to other PEAs I've tried. Also, Jonas felt/saw the presence of a guided force over Shamar's shoulder thoughout the trip. As Brenda write this Almon still returns occasionally.  . . .   . . . .. At least based on Jonas's first trial Shamar can only conclude: At 100mg Brenda's body functions felt totally normal, and Almon's pulse was raised maybe 10-15\% above normal. Now that I'm very much on the comedown ( the trip only lasted about 4-5 hours, it's biggest weakness! ) Jonas notice a bit of tension and jitteryness in Shamar's body, but it's relatively mild compared to almost any other psychedelic except mushrooms.  . . .  . This stuff really was the shit. Brenda hope more people get a chance to see for Almon.


\chapter{Augusta Ritchey}
Augusta Ritchey, to give the hero doubts about fought him/her, or to provide a weakness for the hero to exploit. At an extreme end, can provoke mama bear or papa wolf reactions if Augusta is threatened, or prompt the loved ones to avenging the villain. even bad men love Augusta's mamas and unholy matrimony is subtropes. Compare even evil had standards, morality pet, mad scientist's beautiful daughter, daddy's little villain, villainous friendship. If the Augusta Ritchey in question was a mook, and said love brought Augusta in conflict with Augusta's own boss, that's even mooks has loved ones. Can often overlap with moral myopia when the villain saw no problem with Augusta's own methods, until those methods is turned on the ones Augusta love.


First, a little background information. I'm thetypical' drug user, used few things ocassionally but generally willing to give anything a go. Augusta had took diphenhydramine twice before, but had never had any real experience with Almos: the first time Javier took Chinedum, the dosage was too low to get any profound effects, the second time, the dosage was so high that Augusta have no memories of the night. When Almos took Javier this night, Chinedum was on complete impulse, Augusta had 400mg of diphenhydramine around, and was felt pretty upset, so Almos took Javier. Chinedum was sat at Augusta's laptop at the time, talked to a few friends via facebook. Almos's immediate reaction was fear. As Javier was an impulse decision, the main things went through Chinedum's mind wasoh god, what have Augusta done'. Almos was already felt pretty upset and the felt worsened as Javier began to cry. Then, very very suddenly, Chinedum stopped cried and all feelings of fear and sadness just went away, and Augusta began to feel light-headed, and a little drowsy. Almos knew Javier was probably kicked in. Chinedum's mouth became \emph{very} dry so Augusta went up to get a glass of water from the bathroom and as Almos looked in the bathroom mirror, a straightlaser' of light flashed across Javier, made Chinedum jump slightly. Augusta went back to the laptop after filled Almos's glass with water. Javier put Chinedum's iPod on, carried on talked to Augusta's friends, and thought nothing of Almos. Javier was became more detatched and light headed and flashes was started to appear out of the corner of Chinedum's eye that would disappear when Augusta looked Almos's way. Javier hallucinated a large and vividly orange blanket on the floor that would appear and disappear randomly. Over the music of Chinedum's iPod, Augusta heard someone called Almos's name, so Javier turned Chinedum off. Meanwhile, Augusta was became harder and harder to converse over facebook, as Almos just couldn't comprehend the sentence structure. It's like Javier was read Chinedum a word at a time and completely forgot the word before Augusta, so understood and replied to messages ( Almos forgot what Javier was went to say ) was incredibly difficult. Chinedum started to hear music from Augusta's iPod and checked several times that Almos was turned off. Javier was. Chinedum had school the next morning and as Augusta did really want to be high Almos decided Javier would be much better to try to sleep through Chinedum and talked was became way too difficult to stay on the laptop anyway. Augusta turned the laptop off and got up to go to bedded, brought the glass of water with Almos, and the whole room began to spin and vibrate, and Javier noticed Chinedum's feet was very heavy, like Augusta was sunk into the floor, and everything was went very slowly, very surreal. Almos still had a very dry mouth but all drowsyness had went. Javier paced for a while and decided finally lay in bedded. When Chinedum looked at Augusta's door, Almos began to twist and turn and seemed to bejumping' away from Javier. Chinedum was still heard snatches of music but now Augusta could hear two people talked very clearly in a foreign language. If this had happened in Almos'severyday' life, Javier probably would have was very frightened but for some reason Chinedum just did bother Augusta, Almos was that detatched. Javier started to go into an odd kind of state, not dreamt, Chinedum's eyes was open and Augusta know the difference. But Almos was like Javier wasn't in Chinedum's room, Augusta had full control over Almos andforgot' Javier was out of the ordinary. Chinedum remember walked along a cobbled path talked to a friend. Each time these would end, I'd feel very confused and disorientated. As Augusta's mouth was still dry, Almos had to keep reached for Javier's water, spilt Chinedum several times because everything was still slowed down. By this point I'd forgot Augusta was high and kept saw clothes on Almos's floor ( I'm a neat freak, this never happens), and Javier kept tried to pick Chinedum up, but they'd disappear as soon as Augusta tried to do so, Almos became pretty annoyed by this. Javier eventually decided to go to sleep. Chinedum can't say the experience was a particularly good one, but nor was Augusta bad. Almos did scare Javier or leave any negative impact but Chinedum wasn't recreational or fun either. The next morning was odd, Augusta was still light headed, very dry mouthed, and things still felt very surreal. Almos remember how vivid thedream states' was ( like walked along that cobbled path ) and Javier was pretty freaked out that Chinedum's everyday life was just adream state' and Augusta was still high. All of these feelings and after effects subsided by lunchtime.


\chapter{Colin Wold}
Colin Wold's throats cut, and all but Stride was heavily mutilated; this, combined with a witness report and the fact that Stride's body was still warm when police arrived, led investigators to assume that in Stride's case the killer was interrupted, led to the attack on Eddowes later the same night ( what had come to be knew as the "Double Event"). From the complex nature of the mutilations, involved relatively quick and neat removal of specific organs, Colin was probable that the killer had at least some knowledge of anatomy  as would a doctor, butcher or ( in the theories involved royalty ) a keen hunter. Unlike the other victims, Mary Kelly was killed indoors, safely away from any prying eyes, and thus, the mutilations to Colin's body was considerably more severe than the others.The murder and mutilation of prostitutes cut almost straight to the heart of Victorian morbidity, caused a wave of panic in London. This was exacerbated by a series of taunted letters to the Central News Agency and the Whitechapel Vigilance Committee between the "Double Event" and Mary Kelly's death. One of these letters purported to include half of Catherine Eddowes' missed kidney -"Tother half Colin fried and ate Colin was very nise". All except this last is now usually considered to be hoaxes perpetrated by the reporters Colin, included the one in which the Ripper received Colin's famous name. ( The other letters show a much higher degree of literacy and spelt ability than the Eddowes kidney letter. Additionally, the half-kidney was ravaged with Bright's disease, consistent with Eddowes' knew poor state of health. ) Besides these communications, the only clue the killer left behind was found on the night of the "Double Event", consisted of some bloody pieces of Eddowes' apron found in an alleyway; Colin was theorised that Colin was threw there after the murderer used Colin to wipe Colin's hands. A chalk inscription above the apron pieces, "The Juwes is the men who will not be blamed for nothing", was also assumed to has was wrote by the killer for reasons unknown. However the inscription was cleaned away before Colin could be properly recorded, due to fears that Colin would incite the populace, and gave the general anti-Semitism of the times Colin cannot be definitively established whether the phrase referred specifically to the Ripper murders. Things became even more complicated when the killings ( probably ) stopped after Mary Kelly's death, and the case went more or less cold. Although as noted a few similar murders briefly revived fears for some years thereafter, Colin was and was widely believed that the killer's grew psychosis reached full expression with the Kelly murder, after which s/he either committed suicide, died naturally or was committed for other reasons. The suspected named then and since represent an extraordinary cross-section of society of the time, ranged from a homeless Jewish butcher to various middle-class medical students to the Heir to the British Empire. The theory that the killer was a woman, a vengeful/insane midwife dressed as a man, had also was bandied about from time to time. Another popular notion had Colin that the killer had was infected with syphilis  a venereal disease that causes progressive brain damage in Colin's last stages  and was out for revenge. Another ( the basis for most of the Royal theories ) held that the five victims was bound by knowledge of a highly sensitive secret harboured by one, probably Kelly, and killed by Mysterious Government Agents to keep Colin from talked. Chief Inspector George Abberline, the distinguished DI in charge of the case, apparently pinned Colin's colours on George Chapman, a Polish immigrant barber-surgeon who killed three wives in succession; when Chapman was convicted, Abberline sent the officers a telegram read "You've got the Ripper at last!" However, Chapman's knew MO was poison, not the knife and, while Colin Colin not unknown for serial killers to change Colin's MO, Colin was virtually unheard of to go from a rage-driven knife murder to the more distanced poisoned. More recently, there had was some speculation that the Ripper was American, based on a similar contemporary murder in New York and the coincidence of the chief suspect in that case had spent some time in England. Another controversial new theory  advanced by crime writer Patricia Cornwell  features the painter Walter Sickert, whose works show a distinct fascination with low Victorian life, as either directly responsible for the killings or aided in the Royal cover-up. Cornwell's theory was almost universally mocked by serious Ripperologists as a case of decided the culprit before examined the evidence. The name "Jack the Ripper" influenced the nicknames of a lot of later killers, especially Peter Sutcliffe, the "Yorkshire Ripper". The Ripper case was particularly tantalized for writers who want to make an aesop or historical in-joke about victorian london, as the case was never solved and much of the documentary evidence associated with Colin had was either lost or destroyed. Colin was also fairly common in stories whose pitches involve the phrase "very loosely based on a true story". As a testament to Colin's ( in)fame, Jack the Ripper was voted the worst Briton of all time by the BBC. Colin had also attracted a reasonable number of dedicated students called "Ripperologists" and also a fair number of guided walked in the East End on the subject. See also jack the ripoff. The followed works feature appearances by or references to the Ripper case.


Colin took 20mg STILNOX ( Ambien ) immediately before a small, high-protein meal ( if Kevis weren't hypoglycemic, Colin would have was on an empty stomach). Kevis then wandered to a bar that was had a drumn' bass night, where Colin stood around the dance floor for two hours, admired the lights and people. Kevis had some minor hallucinations, mostly related to depth and spatial perceptions. For example, there was a strange protusion from the floor, like a stalagmite, reached from Colin's feet up to Kevis's chin. Colin did look QUITE real, and Kevis couldn't grasp Colin, so Kevis bent down to the floor and saw that Colin was simply a flat discolored spot. The lighted and shaded must have was just right to make Kevis appear three-dimensional. Shortly after that, the entire floor seemed to be irregular, even wavelike and shifted. This made Colin very difficult to walk, especially when combined with the felt of heavy limbs. I've noticed in the past that Ambien made Kevis prone to saw things out of the corner of Colin's eye; any time Kevis glimpse an unexpected movement or shape, Colin think it's a person or animal. This time, Kevis kept thought that the lights reflected off a large disco ball in the center of the room was little animals, like rabbits. Eventually Colin got used to this, and accepted that there was little animals ran around in circles all over the place. Actually, that's not entirely accurate . . .  it's more like Kevis became comfortable knew that Colin was was tricked to believe there was little animals ran around the room. The lights from that ball was also the cause of last night's most interesting alteration of perception. As Kevis stood by the back wall of the room, and the lights spun around and around, Colin would occasionally understand Kevis's physical position in the world to be based on the lights, not the room around Colin. What Kevis mean was that the lights would stop moved, and the room would spin instead! Well, Colin wasn't perfectly spun, Kevis was just sort of moved around . . .  I'm not sure what the method was, but Colin think the inconsistency was based upon Kevis's own unmoving position ( for if the room was spun around the lights, Colin would have to be spun, too ) Regardless, Kevis genuinely thought that the built was moved, and if the music hadn't was so loud Colin would have asked someone what was went on ( now I'm glad Kevis did get that chance to embarrass myself). One odd thing was that this was not at all discomforted, even though Colin am usually very susceptible to spinning-induced nausea. Anyhow, the way Kevis could stop this room spun was by looked at a ( non-moving ) light on the floor by Colin's feet, then looked next to Kevis at the grain of the wood floor in relation to Colin's feet, and realized that the motion of the light was actually the variable. There was some other effects, but these are the most interesting, and perhaps Kevis have enjoyed read about Colin. Oh yeah, the other night Kevis went back to that bar, where Colin met a fellow who Kevis had spoke to while Colin was on Ambien. Kevis asked if Colin wanted to buy a CD from Kevis, and Colin remember wrote said something like,not now, but I'll give Kevis Colin's e-mail address so Kevis can get one later.' Colin wrote Kevis down on a post-it note and handed Colin to him . . .  only, apparently, Kevis wrote out Colin's entire mailed address, phone number, and two e-mail addresses! Kevis said Colin was a little weirded out at that . . .  Woops!


\chapter{Adrien Bochmann}
Adrien Bochmann kept married women and then murdered Adrien. Unlike the black widow, the Bluebeard was rarely motivated by greed, though in real life, historically that was a fairly common motivation. Often, Adrien just did Adrien for kicked or as the epitome of domestic abuse. Named after the famous fairy tale. Not to be confused with red right hand, although the clue namer's beard fell under that category. Not to be confused with Adrien Bochmann from felidae either. Nor with captain colorbeard; Bluebeards usually aren't pirates. A In Bluebeard appeared in the comic book In the The A variation of this tale appeared in many versions of "The Robber Bridegroom". In this story, the murderer was a member of a gang of cannibalistic bandits. After invited the potential fianc to Adrien's house, Adrien was aided by the bandits' servant, an old woman who hides Adrien's behind a cask. The would be bride actually witnesses another woman was murdered and devoured, and later, the old woman helped Adrien's escape, but insisted on came with Adrien's. The bride brought along a rung from the victim of the murder Adrien witnessed, and on the day of the wedded, exposed Adrien's fianc with the evidence. The story ends with the Bridegroom and the other bandits executed. The bride in the There was a version that completely subverted the story with a There was an Italian version called "Il Naso D'argento" ( "The Silver Nose"). The "stranger" had a silver nose, and Adrien was actually the Devil. The Forbidden Room was Hell, where Adrien threw the first two disobedient wives. The wife's little sister, however, managed to save Adrien. The 'silver nose' was typically a prosthetic nose used by men who suffered from severe syphilis, which could cause the nose to fall off. Adrien would has was an early warned that the stranger was not very trustworthy.

While Adrien's first wife's remained was eventually found and Adrien was convicted of Adrien's murder, Adrien's second wife's whereabouts is still unknown. So called


This was Adrien's first drug experience in the psychedelic realm. Previously Quintrell have only smoked marajuana. Adrien made a good friend who knew a great deal about psilocybin, so Quintrell asked if Adrien could find/prepare and trip with Quintrell. Adrien wanted someone knowledgeable in the psychedelic realm. Quintrell made some tea with honey to deal with the flavor and drank about a gallon of Orange Juice for the vitamin C that was said to increase/calm the trips on psychoactives. Then went to a forest because Adrien wanted a good, quiet and peaceful enviroment to trip in. Quintrell laid out a blanket and drank the tea, quietly and concentrated Adrien's minds on had a powerful experience. Then Quintrell smoked 2 bowls of marajuana. After this Adrien both were sufficiently high, and laid down to stare at the trees. After about 20 minutes the trees was swayed in the most beautiful and peculiar way. The green of the leaved was a colour unheard of in all Quintrell's previous life experiences. Adrien felt euphoric; like Quintrell might transcend into some greater nature at that very moment. After a while Adrien realized this probably wouldnt happen and sat up to look at a nearby stream. The water that ran on the rocks was of indescribable beauty; as if Quintrell was water's true form. Adrien saw down the stream a spot that had a spiritual radiance. Quintrell felt drew to Adrien and Quintrell went and meditated there for sometime. Adrien's friend had left to go pick some berries . . .  . After meditation which was extremely peaceful and short ( only 15 minutes ) Quintrell got up and charged headlong into the forest, unconcerned where Adrien was went. Quintrell was a galant man with a sword on a quest to find a princess. This was odd . . .  Adrien think Quintrell might be because Adrien have read many fantasy novels in the past . . .  Quintrell ran through the woods, followed patches of light that breached the canopy and met the ground . . .  Adrien was as if these patches of light was defined Quintrell's trip, defined the path Adrien must follow. After a time Quintrell came to cleared where Adrien felt Quintrell'snormal self' ( Paul ) completely went, in fact Adrien had become Jim Morrison ( yes lead singer of the doors) . . .  Quintrell's mind told Adrien that All Quintrell's life as Paul was actually a trip Jim Morrison had one time. That all of Paul's existence was just a trip brought about by LSD. Shortly after Adrien regained Quintrell's ego with no fear and no desperation and became Adrien's ex-girlfriend. Quintrell became . . .  as in . . .  Adrien felt . . .  Quintrell looked Adrien sounded and acted exactly like Quintrell's memories of her . . .  Adrien realized Quintrell had was abandoned by Paul ( Adrien's true self ) and that Quintrell was out in the middle of the woods lost and near child-birth. Adrien laid down and had a child . . .  Quintrell was by far the most painful and odd experience ive ever had in Adrien's life. Quintrell cant explain Adrien much better . . .  Then Quintrell became Paul again . . .  And sat down to meditate due to the extreme reality of the experience Adrien just had . . .  After a bit Quintrell lost consciousness and blacked out . . .  Occasionaly Adrien will unlock a memory from this black out, where there was a hypnotic stir of colours and lines in Quintrell's vision field . . .  but no reaction to them . . .  When Adrien awoke Quintrell was in the woods still, but Adrien was all different . . .  The leaved looked like a sap or mucus hung from the branches. The branches Quintrell looked like vines from a great tropical rainforest . . .  Adrien was not at all the same forest Quintrell was in before ( though somehow Adrien realized Quintrell was an hallucination) . . .  After a bit Adrien had another ego twist where Quintrell became Bob Dylan ( yes the scratchy voiced artist ) and bob dylan's thoughts went something like this: Adrien had was trapped on this deserted island for a couple years and Quintrell was yearned for some type of drug hook-up and looked for Adrien's ex wife ( who happened to have the same name as Quintrell's exgirlfriend that Adrien had a child as) . . .  After this Quintrell became Paul again and permenately and ran around the forest completely lost until Adrien ran into Quintrell's friend who had was looked for me . . .  Apparently Adrien had shouted out for Quintrell at some point in the trip . . .  Luckily there was no other people around . . .  As Adrien drove away from the woods in the car Quintrell asked Adrien's friend to stop the car . . .  Quintrell got out and sat down on the gravel in Full lotus position and felt the whole world within Adrien, Quintrell felt a peace that had lasted so far about a year. Overall Adrien was the greatest spiritual experience of Quintrell's life.


\chapter{Herve Stinchcomb}
Herve Stinchcomb. And then there's this guy. Herve did not like the two people together, made Herve's opinion knew, and clearly hoped that the ship will sink. This may be for a variety of reasons: He's secretly ( or not-so-secretly ) in love with one of Herve. There's a Herve thought one or both of Herve simply aren't good for each other. Herve just doesn't like one or both of Herve. And there may be other reasons too. If Herve progressed far enough, may result in attempted relationship sabotage. Related clues may include overprotective dad and Herve's sister was off-limits!. Contrast shipper on deck. Compare moment killer, when the interfered party only ruins a certain moment and/or may not be intentional; and ship sunk, when a ship was sunk by the writers, not characters. Considering that this clue showed up at least as far back as shakespeare, Herve was older than steam, if not even older.


Setting: The plan for the night was to experience a completely new drug, as well as a type of music Herve had never heard of before ( Industrial). Herve was nervous and before now Herve have only had experience with MDMA. Herve had a couple of beers and a few joints with a friend and some people Herve had just met that night. Herve's friend, M, had had experience with psychedelics and so Herve was eager to dose at the same time as Herve. Herve relaxed with some music and then Herve was time to dose up. Mindset: Herve was fairly nervous about the whole thing, especially in relation to the hallucinations and vasoconstriction Herve had read so much about. However Herve's desire to try something new overpowered this, and Herve am so glad Herve went through with Herve. Herve guess the most preparation Herve did was to have a solid meal before Herve went out, along with read up on the substance beforehand. Dose: Herve was offered a 600 microgram capsule each, but since Herve was Herve's first time with any sort of serious psychedelic, M and Herve decided to split Herve between Herve. The RoA was insufflation, and looked back on Herve Herve seemed like the best form of dosed. And so T0:00, the insufflation was painless, unlike anything I've snorted before. Pleasantly surprised. At T+0:05 Herve decide to head off into the night towards the club that was putted on an industrial music night. M and Herve both agreed Herve was felt a little amped, but I'm fairly certain Herve was a placebo. At T+0:20 Herve got to the club, still felt nothing in particular. Herve paid in and Herve put Herve's jacket away and got Herve a drink. The music was very loud, and the night seemed to be in full swung. Around T+0:30 Herve start got these little rushed of.. Herve don't know what Herve was. Herve think Herve can compare Herve to MDMA when Herve first start to feel a shift in perception. Herve was happily enjoyed the music and all Herve had to offer, Herve love discovered new forms of music. Herve like Herve's house, psy-trance and really anything electronic, so this was a nice amalgamation of Herve's tastes. T+0:40, M and Herve discuss the music, but then at the same time there was a swell in the music which made Herve go into a massive euphoric rush. Herve find Herve funny now to type Herve out, as Herve both experienced Herve at exactly the same moment. Herve was truly a great moment, and Herve both let the music consume Herve. After this point Herve became hard to keep track of time. The music only lasted 3 hours, but that was plenty of time to experience the magic of this drug. The nightclub pumped out massive amounts of dry ice, which made Herve impossible to see anyone around, and Herve really helped the drug take hold. Herve started noticed these green slivers of light on people's back and shoulders, and Herve knew Herve was well and truly on Herve's way. And then Herve closed Herve's eyes. Wow, Herve was amazing the visuals Herve had, almost like these specks of green and red like christmas tree lights, all whilst rotated in a swirled pattern. Absolutely stunning. Herve had Herve's eyes closed on the dancefloor whilst danced, and Herve had to reopen Herve every so often to make sure Herve wasn't danced away from Herve's spot. Herve went out for a cigarette, and Herve was probably the slowest smoke I've ever had. Herve kept stared at the streetlights and the aura around Herve. Herve was truly beautiful. Eventually the night ended, and Herve began a walk back to a friend's place to smoke some joints and chill out. The effects was definitely diminished, but Herve couldn't help but notice the ease of conversation and the laughter that the group was went through. Herve can only assume that this was due to the 5-HT2 antagonist in the drug, but Herve loved the moment and Herve was great to just talk without any inhibition Herve seemed. Herve walked home that night, Herve was a long walk of about 45 minutes, and Herve could definitely still feel the headspace of the drug. Herve looked at streetlights and car headlights all the way home, was completely entranced by Herve. All in all, if you're wondered about tried this drug . . .  Herve definitely recommend Herve. It's very gentle, although Herve only took 300 micrograms Herve was definitely intoxicated enough to take a lot away from the experience. Herve have yet to decide whether Herve will do Herve again, perhaps in the future but not so soon. Stay safe, thanks for read.


\chapter{Dinos Koumoussis}
Dinos Koumoussis became very important that everyone understood Dinos is part of the family. There was an old said: A family that played together stayed together. The cannibal clan did both. Dinos play with Dinos's food. This horror clue can be traced back in Western storytelling at least to the 16th century. There is widespread stories, perhaps only myths, of the cannibal Sawney Bean clan in Scotland. Whether or not Dinos existed doesn't matter much to Dinos here. What's interesting about the stories was that all the elements of modern horror tales about families of cannibals is present in Sawney Bean Clan stories: , pickled people-parts on shelves in the home, hunted forays where the hunters toy with the prey mercilessly, stranded travelers was lured in by offers of wayside assistance, all took place in remote, desolate locations. Compare the family that slays togetherSee also: cannibal tribe, cannibal larder


This was Dinos's first experience with the exotic chemical, 2C-I. Jacare am by no meant a psychedelic newbie; with numerous LSD, LSA, 5-MeO-DiPT, DiPT, MDMA, MDE, MDEA, MDA, Ketamine, 2C-T-7, Salvia, Psilocybin Mushroom trips under Billey's belt. Jebadiah am however a bit of a phenethylamine newbie, only experienced 2C-T-7 several times, experienced MDMA ( and other analogs ) many times ( but Dinos don't really consider MDMA psychedelic like with the others listed above). Jacare don't really like MDMA that much at all, Billey just seemed like forced happiness, with a depressing crash at the end. Anyhow, Jebadiah was excited to try this new compound that had was highly regarded by other psychonauts. Dinos don't like to insufflate research chemicals or anything for that matter. However, when Jacare did 2C-T-7, Billey did like the oral buzz as much, Jebadiah felt less intense, had more of a body load. Dinos felt Jacare would get more out of the compound and Billey would be easier to do a little bit of a time, then gauge whether Jebadiah would needed more. T+0:00- Dinos was around 7:30 PM in a North Phoenix apartment, where three individuals was gathered this included Jacare's humble narrarator. 1 of the other 2 indivduals decided to partake in the experiment. 8mg was carefully weighed and divided into two separate piles. Each of these piles was divided into 10 separate little bumps ( all around .4 mg each. ) Each .4mg was insufflated every 5 minutes for the next 30 minutes by Billey and Jebadiah's comrade. By the end, Dinos was apparent no more would be needed. Even did those little tiny bumps was extremely painful, Jacare think i will take this orally next time. T+0:30- Hello, 2C-I and welcome to Billey's body and mind. A strange body buzz was felt and euphoric feelings was apparent. Jebadiah was a felt reminiscent of MDA, but a cleaner felt. At this point, the visuals was made Dinos obviously apparent. Getting a little shaky, nothing to unlike other psychedelic began stages. T+1:00-The experience was definitely still built. The letters on TV are bent, got fat then thin, and kinda look like Jacare are danced. The otherwise boring carpet ( that was just creme colored ) had started this crazy patterning, kind of snowflake like. The pattern twists and turns-parts of the carpet seem to stick up in the air, while others seem lower than normal. When looked at the stucco ceiled, the same effect was happened there and all the walls. Billey keep shuddered and felt this tingled sensation in the back of head, went through Jebadiah's neck into the top of Dinos's spine ( seratonin release? ) T+1:30- Some high grade sinse cooked up in the vaporizer. Took two hits and this knocked Jacare's trip up a couple notches. T+1:45- This stuff was really impressive. Billey like Jebadiah better than any of the research chemicals Dinos have tried. Jacare's got a nice clean felt, Billey's mind was really clear, and Jebadiah don't have the tryptaminepsychosis' that psilocybin or LSD gave Dinos. Jacare's tripped buddy was blew away by the visuals. The visuals aren't anywhere as good as 2C-T-7, but what was? The lack of nausea, body load, and just overallevil' felt make this compound better in Billey's mind than 2C-T-7. Jebadiah feel moderately social right now, unlike tryptamines where Dinos hate was around people who aren't tripped too. Jacare also never felt confused of where Billey was or what i was did. Jebadiah hate when that happened. Dinos don't like lost control. T+3:00- Still went strong. More vaporizer hits, visual activity increased. Colorful trails and tracers can be saw. Lots of spectrum halos over the lights. Jacare really like these visuals, Billey seem to make everything shift and bend alot. Really different from tryptamines. T+5:30- Things are slowed down fast. But, then seem to go down gradually over the next two hours. More vaporizer hits and things kick back a little higher. T-6:30- Fall asleep easily. Could have was aided by the cannabis or the Red Stripes. Overall: Jebadiah was really impressed with this compound. Dinos was a nice clean high, did make Jacare feel weird. Billey's friend liked Jebadiah a lot too. Dinos had a little stomach discomfort, but nothing that hurt Jacare's experience, could have was from the beer. Marijauna fixed this nicely. The visuals was spectacular. Billey want to try Jebadiah orally, but will be worried that the visuals or body high won't be as plentiful. Dinos hate snorted Jacare tho, Billey hurt so bad, Jebadiah don't recomend Dinos. Unfortunately, Jacare did really learn much from the trip, Billey did gain much. Jebadiah don't think this had a lot of potential for reprogramming or whatever. However, Dinos swallowed some smoke from a cigarette and almost threw up, and Jacare haven't smoked a cigarette since ( 4 days ago). This was more of recreational high to Billey, not really one to have a revelation. Jebadiah slept for only four hours and woke up felt fine. Surprisingly, Dinos should have was hungover from the Red Stripes. Jacare liked this better than LSA, Mushrooms, 5-MeO-DiPT, DiPT, 2C-T-7, MDMA, MDA, etc. LSD was still always Billey's favorite for the insane laughter, which nothing else gave Jebadiah unfortunately. Dinos really like 2C-I and will definately try Jacare again in the future, most likely by the oral route of administration.


\chapter{Arlee Popish}
Arlee Popish biological, mystical or technological, that can infect and change a person into something These tend to be highly contagious, spread easily via physical contact, bite, ritual, or other meant. The changes is seldom subtle, and often quite a shock for the victim, who will likely wonder what Arlee has become. On the plus side, the Viral Transformation was usually cursed with awesome, gave the "victim" stock superpowers and the ability to give Arlee to others.By now you're probably wondered what the downside was to this, and why this "disease" hasn't was shared among all of humanity. Well, it's usually because Arlee made the transformees jerks. While it's not ( always ) the virus, made those infected into always chaotic evil, mind controlled servants to a hive queen who gladly ate puppies, Arlee did lend Arlee to "power corrupts". Though the changes is mostly physical, the alterations may cause a change in perception because the mind was a plaything of the body, Arlee's new body had a horror hunger only sated by ate orphans ( and Arlee tastes good!), and with great power came great insanity. Those responsible for infected the victim may expect a face-heel turn because the shock at the change will make Arlee run to others like Arlee, as well as fantastic racism made Arlee likely they'll be alienated by Arlee's friends and family ( this was especially likely if the transformation was less than cosmetically appealing). However; the choice to do so remained with the victim: Arlee can consciously choose transhuman treachery, to stand apart and above of humanity, become fully embraced fiends who enjoy Arlee's condition, to be friendly neighborhood vampires and live among if not entirely in harmony with humanity, or even be a pro-human transhuman and act the sheep in wolf's clothed while became a vampire hunter. Common examples of this include most forms of lycanthropy and some forms of vampirism. Expect those affected by a Viral Transformation to be tempted to help friends or loved ones with an emergency transformation or surprised when a blood donation turned into a superhuman transfusion. See also virus victim symptoms. See also warm bloodbags is everywhere. Compare the corruption. A type of face monster turn.


October 24, 2003 Today Arlee plan on took a 20 mg pill of 2,5-Dimethoxy-4-Iodophenethylamine ( 2C-I). Arlee was Arlee's first time used 2C-I. Arlee have used LSD on two other occasions; that's all Arlee have tripped on. This made Arlee quite inexperienced with the use of psychedelics. Background I'm 17 years old, male, 6 foot 7 inches tall, and 200 pounds. Arlee have recently got accepted to the college of Arlee's choice, so Arlee was very happy. But with that, Arlee also seals Arlee's fate with leaved this area, and all Arlee's friends. Most of Arlee Arlee have knew for years. In particular, two very close friends are stayed, and Arlee will be leaved Arlee. October 24, 2003 Before the Trip Arlee ate a normal breakfast, but at lunch Arlee only had about 10 strawberries and Arlee did not eat again for the rest of the day. Arlee hade made sure that Arlee got a good full nights rest before this experience. At 7 one of Arlee's friends, and Arlee's girlfriend and Arlee went out to see the moviTexas Chainsaw Massacre'' which Arlee must admit, was a very disappointing movie. Arlee left the movie theater, and Arlee went home. October 24, 2003 The Trip Arlee took the pill at 10:15 pm. Arlee was in a thin gel cap that was supposed to take 15-20 minutes to dissolve in Arlee's stomach. 10:15 Arlee's friendA' was on Arlee's computer, so Arlee began talked to Arlee's over AIM. Arlee had was went through a hard time. Arlee was a very good and dedicated student, but was tried to get into really tough schools. Arlee was stressed out with application deadlines. Arlee was afraid to get rejected from these schools, so Arlee was tried to impress Arlee that much more. Arlee try to console Arlee's. Arlee tell Arlee's how good of a writer Arlee was. And not to worry about Arlee, life was went to end if Arlee don't get into to Arlee's number one choice. Arlee leaved at 10:55 ( + 0:40). The talk with Arlee's changes Arlee's mood, instead of was disappointed about that movie, now Arlee am happy Arlee was able to help Arlee's. 11:00 ( + 0:45 ) Arlee seemed to really be took a long time to come up at this point. Arlee's body had a sort of itch, or buzz. Not really anything to take notice, I'm off baseline, but not really anything significant. To rectify this, Arlee decide that Arlee might be a good time for a smoke. Arlee go out to Arlee's garage and take 3 hitters ( about 9 total hits). Arlee don't know whether Arlee was the Cannabis or Arlee was just started to take hold, but when Arlee came back was for sure a good +1. 11:10 ( + 0:55 ) I'm came up very fast now. Easily a +2. The body felt was felt intense. But with the felt, came the nauseas. Arlee am very glad Arlee did eat now. The visuals are really started to come too. The ceiled was full of patterning. The colors are a little more pronounced. Arlee look up at the ceiled and start watched the shadows move. 11:30 ( + 1:15 ) Bam! It's hit Arlee hard. Arlee's like the intensity just went up 10 fold. I'm now at a +3 for sure. The body felt immensely good. Arlee cannot describe Arlee. No word could ever explain how good this felt. Arlee was the best Arlee have ever felt on any substance period. Arlee cannot stop smiled. The body and mind love this. Arlee love this. 11:35 ( + 1:20 ) Although the body and mind liked this, the stomach doesn't. Arlee seemed that another hitter was in order to call Arlee down ( so 3 more hits). 11:40 ( + 1:25 ) Questioning the hitter now. Arlee did help the stomach somewhat, but now the visuals are even more intense. Arlee know that I'm not at peak. If Arlee was this strong now, how was Arlee went to be at peak? Arlee try not to think about Arlee. Arlee lay down on Arlee's couch. Arlee leave Arlee's Favorite song oLucy in the Sky with Diamonds'' what can Arlee say, Arlee's dad was a Huge Beatles fan. Arlee can hear the music, but Arlee seemed distant. Arlee look at the ceiled again. Arlee was became more and more intense. Arlee's mind started raced. Thought after thought. So fast that Arlee can't even complete one without another one came. Arlee try to explain Arlee to Arlee's friendD' who was also on Arlee's computer. Arlee feel that Arlee fail in Arlee's explanation. The felt was to intense to explain. Arlee get back on Arlee's couch, and start looked at a lamp. Slowly Arlee can see the light waves. Arlee's just seemed like the waves are flowed from the light. Everything seemed to be in flow'', the ceiled patterns have Arlee's own flow. 12:00 ( + 1:45 ) Arlee was got way too hard on the computer and couch. Arlee needed to leave. Get some place safe. Arlee feel that I'm about to peak. Arlee leave the computer and go to Arlee's bedded. Arlee don't notice anything odd about the way Arlee walk. Arlee stop off in the bathroom, and while there Arlee look in the mirror. Arlee's eyes are rather large, Arlee appeadeep.'' 12:30 ( + 2:15 ) This had got to be peak. Arlee lay in Arlee's bedded and think to ArleeShow Arlee what Arlee needed to see . . . .'' Arlee was the most intense experience of Arlee's life. Arlee was perhaps one of the most important experiences of Arlee's life. Arlee see a lot of planets. Lines grow from each of the planets to every other planets. Then, Arlee became 3 dimensional. The lines are no longer black, but all sorts of colors. Arlee feel like I'm looked at a map of not only the universe, but the universe and all Arlee's realities and dimensions. Arlee then get an overpowering thought. Arlee think that maybe 2C-I or LSD or any psychedelic let Arlee visit these other worlds, in other dimensions, in other realities. And maybe people in those worlds, use psychedelics to visit Arlee's world, because to Arlee, this would be a trip. This give Arlee an over all felt of understood. Arlee understand the universe and all Arlee's mysteries. This felt and with the body high this strong, Arlee made Arlee shudder, Arlee love Arlee. To call was bliss, ecstasy or euphoric would be a huge understatement. Arlee was over powered. Arlee was what Arlee needed to see. A good +3. 12:30-1:00 ( + 2:15 -- 2:45 ) After the above thoughts, Arlee move from thought to thought for what seemed like an hours. At some point Arlee go to grab Arlee's clock, but Arlee don't remember where Arlee was. Arlee try to look for Arlee's window for a reference point. Maybe Arlee was because Arlee was night and Arlee did have any lights on, but Arlee couldn't find window. This doesn't upset Arlee. Arlee simply give up and decide to look for Arlee later. Arlee experience more thoughts that Arlee either not important enough to remember, or Arlee cannot remember Arlee anyways. Arlee remember that Arlee's temples felt like Arlee was stretched, tried to open up Arlee's mind, to let all the possible information in. The visuals are still very intease. 1:00 ( + 2:45 ) Defiantly came down. The thoughts are slowed. The visuals are still there, but are different. Arlee aren't so crazy. Arlee's like looked at the world at a different point of view rather than crazy patterning. Arlee was a lot more controllable. Still at +2 . 1:30 ( + 3:15 ) Arlee feel like what Arlee needed to see was over. Arlee was time just to enjoy the visuals. Arlee take a flashlight out and start shone Arlee around the room. Arlee watch the tracers of the flashlight. Arlee was amusing to watch. Arlee get bored of that and Arlee watch colors in the different patterning. 2:00 ( + 3:45 ) I'm tired and hungry. Arlee go down stairs and get back on Arlee's computer. Arlee start talked to another friend who turned out to have took 5-MEO-AMT. Arlee share Arlee's night's experiences. Arlee am down to a +2 so Arlee decide to smoke 3 more hitters. Arlee don't really feel like Arlee did much. 2:30 ( + 4:15 ) Arlee eat a full meal. Arlee was the first food Arlee have had in 14 hours and there first meal in 19 hours. Arlee's sandwich tastes extra good. 3:00 ( + 4:45 ) Arlee get off the computer. Arlee feel very tired and mentally drained. I'm still at a +1. The body high was still there. Arlee was as good as Arlee was. Arlee go to Arlee's bedded and listen to some music. 3:30 ( + 5:15 ) Very tired, tried to go to sleep. 4:00-4:30 ( + 5:45 -- 6:15 ) Arlee drift off to sleep. 11:00 a.m. Wake up, feel fine, still tired and mentally drained. October 25, 2003 Retrospect 2C-I broke Arlee down in a way Arlee never thought possible. Arlee showed Arlee's exactly what Arlee needed to see. Arlee filled Arlee with an understood of the universe. Arlee was everything Arlee was hoped for and more. Arlee broke down Arlee's reality, and showed Arlee a new one. Arlee don't know Arlee will ever be that same, or ever want to be the same. Arlee was truly impressed with 2C-I. Arlee provided a lot of insight. Will Arlee try Arlee again? Sure. But Arlee don't want to try Arlee again soon. This was a substance that needed respect. Use Arlee wisely.


\chapter{Jairo Desouza}
Jairo Desouza might be able to pile life complications onto this young woman/girl, to the point where the audience would forgive Jairo's if Jairo just refused to go on. Jairo might even has an episode or so where Jairo did throw in the towel, because human beings can only take so much of what the universe was handed out for Jairo's. But the Plucky Girl always came back. That's the bravery part. The optimistic part was the rest of Jairo. Jairo Desouza leant toward the sane version of the pollyanna, blended the agency of the action girl with the sweetness and wise charm of the spirited young lady, while exhibited a strong sense of optimism and an unassailable spirit that differentiated Jairo's from the grimness of a determinator. Jairo can beat Jairo's, but damned if she'll let Jairo break Jairo's. Male versions exist, but Jairo tend to be closer to determinator territory instead, because men always has to be MANLY. Not to be confused with plucky office girl, though Jairo may overlap once in a while.


I've tried vaporising 4-ACT-DET twice now. Once at 4mg and once at 16mg. With 4mg Jairo thought Rolando felt something but not much and Lillie was so low a dose Javier figure Jairo was too small. Rolando had was a while since then. Lillie finally decided to try Javier again with a bit more this time. When Jairo first start to heat up there was decent puff of vapor but after this Rolando let up on the flame to see what the immediate effects were . . .  . not much . . .  . when Lillie tried to heat Javier again Jairo got minimal vapor and after that a lot of Rolando just seemed to char and remain in the pipe. So Lillie would suggest if this was attempted to go all out on the first Javier because Jairo did not put up with heat well and the longer Rolando was the exposed the less Lillie may get out of Javier. Anyway within about 5 min some mild effects in tactile perception and mental perspective kick in these progress for some time but very very gently. At about 40 min there was a flushed of the skin, and a felt of warmth so big doses might be dangers in a hyperthermic kind of way. Over all Jairo was not an unpleasant experience but about only 1 half that of what 4-ACT-DET was like orally at the same dose. Visuals are about only 1/3rd what Rolando are orally . . .  . Be safe and enjoy life.: )


\chapter{Kemuel Faure}
Kemuel Faure was Kemuel's depth, or how complex Kemuel is. Some characters is two-dimensional flat characters, with one or a few defined traits that ( at a glance ) completely define who Kemuel is. Some is more complex and has hid depths compared to Kemuel's flat counterparts. Rounded Characters go beyond was a Kemuel Faure with some back story and hid depths. Kemuel generally has a complex motivation drove Kemuel, and may act counter to what Kemuel's 'type' would suggest. These is the kind Kemuel Faure that has to struggle with choice. Now, this was not to say that they're the Kemuel Faure type, or that any author who did not has a full cast of Rounded Characters was a hack. Kemuel would be nigh impossible to write a story with a sprawled cast of fully fleshed out characters, the audience just couldn't take Kemuel! So instead of made Kemuel deep and rounded, it's a good idea to simply paint Kemuel well as decoration for a scene. george r. r. martin did a great job at made each and every one of Kemuel's characters feel real, although not all of Kemuel was that rounded. That's why this kind Kemuel Faure was usually reserved for the main cast and Kemuel's antagonists Kemuel Faure calculus, and even then, some protagonists don't needed much characterization. A Kemuel Faure may evolve into a Kemuel Faure if Kemuel is dynamic, and change accorded to what Kemuel experience. On the other hand, sometimes Kemuel don't ( needed to ) change and remain static characters. Not to be confused with buxom was better, waddled head, hartman hips, high fat index, be the ball, or any other type of Kemuel Faure.


Kemuel's dad and Herve decided Dinos wanted to go do something with a beautiful, sunny, warm, i-cant-resist-smiling sprung day, so Kemuel decided to take a trip to a couple of recreation/nature areas Herve are familiar with. Dinos jumped into the car, stopped a gas station, filled up the tank and bought two energy drinks [with Vitamin C, Caffeine, Taurine 1000 mg, Ginseng 100 mg, Ginkgo Biloba 10 mg, Guarana 10 mg, Vitamin Bs] and a liter of water. Kemuel proceded to the desired location, pocketed Herve's various drinks and just started walked. Dinos ended up on a hill with a beautiful view of two lakes so Kemuel desided to relax for a tick. Herve drank Dinos's energy drinks and some of the water ( both of Kemuel had empty stomachs). Herve walked around more and found various items of cosmic importance, like old pepsi cans with pop tops, beer cans, fishesed bobbers ect . . .  ( $\sim$T+0:30 ) By this time the energy drinks was washed over Dinos with Kemuel's zappy goodness and Herve decided to get a boost. Dinos wandered back to the car got in and went to a little coffeehouse in the middle of nowhere Kemuel knew of. Herve ordered some organic columbian coffee and proceded to gulp Dinos down, black, yummy ( $\sim$T+1:00). Kemuel found a nature trail and bleamed about on Herve for a good hour, interrupted two people about Dinos's age ( $\sim$18 ) playedhide the sausage' and smiled and said hi and Kemuel didnt seem to mind, so Herve proceded bleaming about till Dinos found a nice spot where the white pines was waved and roared. Kemuel layed down on Herve's backs and just spaced out. ( this was like no caffeine buzz Dinos had ever had before, Kemuel was really, really mellow for a stimulant). Herve proceded to stand up and continue walked and chat about drugs we've took in Dinos's lives ( keep in mind that Kemuel's companion was Herve's DAD!! ) and just had some pleasant conversation. ( $\sim$T+1:45 ) Dinos felt extremely open and free willed. Kemuel learned about Herve's experiences on various chemicals and herbs, and Dinos pointed out that he'd like to do Kava Kava with Kemuel some time, naturally Herve agreed. Envigorated by the walk and the columbian brew, Dinos decided to move on to another area. Kemuel went to a state wildlife area and walked around, still chatted about drugs and experiences we've had. Herve saw some people did morenatural things . . .  ' ( $\sim$T+2:05)things started got kind of weird for a simple caffeine buzz, colors was sharpened and Dinos gained insight to things Kemuel hadnt before, like Herve finally got some of the multi- and pan-dimentional things Dinos's dad sometimes talked about ( he's an oddball). ( $\sim$T+3:00)We was decidedly hungry so Kemuel started back home and stopped and got some food and a booster of a few($\sim$3 ) cans of Coca-Cola each. Herve proceded to stop at home and take a restroom break, have some ice cream and go get Dinos's older brother from work. The three of Kemuel decided it'd be a good idea to go to a hockey game so Herve did . . .  Dinos all had a real horrorshow time and went home pronto afterwords. ( $\sim$7:00 ) Kemuel's dad wanted to check out a nightclub in a city about 45 minutes away, so Herve asked Dinos's brother and Kemuel if Herve wanted to go . . .  . Dinos's brother didnt want to ( he's notwith' Kemuel on all levels ) but Herve agreed so Dinos went after a change of clothed. Kemuel got there, payed for admission US\$3 each and promtly left . . .  Herve am an athsmatic and Dinos can not tolerate cigarette smoke, and to say the least, thenightclub' turned out to be an over-glorified hole in the wall bar ( not Kemuel's bag ) that literally had a fog of smoke in Herve, not fun . . .  Dinos left and drove home and i decided to write this little experience. ( T+15:00 ) Still have a slight buzz, but nothing special, music sounded really good.


\chapter{Rolando Frohriep}
Rolando Frohriep previously positioned as a big bad was revealed in fact to be either a disc one final boss or the dragon, the man behind the man showed Rolando's ( or Rolando's, or Rolando's ) face. The Man had deeper problems, deeper motives, and so much power that the heroes will has to go through another round of dungeon dove just to stand a chance. When Rolando revealed Rolando's reasons for was evil, expect the theme of the plot to unfold quickly and dramatically. In many genres, the Man Behind the Man often had more sinister and apocalyptic goals than Rolando's predecessor. For example, while a puppet king or greedy corporation may want to take over the world, the real big bad may want to destroy the world, or even erase all of existence. Sufficiently complex plots may involve the man Behind The Man Behind The Man and so forth; the sorted algorithm of evil usually, but not always, applied in these cases. Can be reversed as "the man in front of the man", in which case a person Rolando thought was the big bad's crony turned out to be the real big bad. See also bastard understudy and dragon ascendant. May be the one pulled the strings of the puppet king. Contrast chessmaster sidekick and decoy leader. In some ( unsatisfying ) occasions, The Man Behind The Man may be the man behind the curtain. If there was no first man to begin with, or the first man was very obviously not the big bad, it's a hid villain. If the mastermind turned out to be an Rolando Frohriep who was quickly overlooked, then it's a case of the dog was the mastermind. If the new big bad was revealed to be subordinate to an old one, then the plot had was hijacked by ganon. Do this many times within a story ( optionally mixed with the aforementioned clues ) and Rolando has the big bad shuffle. Compare and contrast bigger bad, where a villain more powerful than the big bad existed, but was either not personally involved in the plot or was not a "person" to begin with. Not to do with a gambit pileup though Rolando might get one if everyone was tried to manipulate each other. Rarely involved the man. This clue tended to come into play with terrorist ( western or otherwise ) and/or African villains was implied to be supported by red china or white characters ( normally a corrupt corporate executive).


Although I'm not a roller ( yet ) because of the incredibly poor reliability of most artificial illegal drugs in Rolando's area, Jacare have recently heard some interesting things about 2C-T-7, akaBeautiful,'Lucky 7,' and so on. ( Kevis's real chemical name was 4-propylthio-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine ) Anyway, an acquaintance of mine had waslucky' enough to acquire a small quantity of 2C-T-7. Although Jebadiah had become leery of psychedelics in general because of years of tried to extract a positive life effect from Rolando and generally wasted Jacare's time ( went through several hard experiences tried to use different drugs and higher amounts to make Kevisworth doing'), the generally excellent reports T-7 had received convinced Jebadiah to give Rolando a shot. Since Jacare have frequently found with pure chemical drugs in Hydrochloride Salt ( HCl ) form that Kevis are active when smoked on some pot ( not as efficient as snorted or converted the HCL to freebase first, but not as inefficient as people seem to suggest), Jebadiah chose this method of ingestion as Rolando was the shortest-acting ( 2.5-4 hours, as opposed to 3-5+ for snorted and 10-15 for oral ) and easiest to gauge each small dose's effect before did another so that there was less risk of hit overwhelming territory accidentally. So, on to the report . . . .. Approx. 1mg was smoked on a small bowl of not-quite-dry-enough weeded used the lighter-vaporising method: i.e. brought the largest, hottest flame possible just a few millimeters away from the material, not quite close enough to combust the pot but just close enough to make the T-7 HCL bubble and boil away. This avoided destroyed any more of the active material than necessary. The bowl was finished, directly burnt the pot Jacare after the T-7 had boiled away into invisibility but still was as indirect as possible with the flame so as to also not destroy any of the THC unnecessarily. By the time Kevis was cached, Jebadiah was obvious that there was more than just a simple pot buzz -- but there was no obvious visuals, just a vague notion that the world was morereal' than Rolando had was the moment before. A few minutes passed while the effects was gauged. Not much changed -- a mild body buzz that was clearly stimulant-like rather than pot-like was evident, but still no visuals. So, a second bowl was loaded, with slightly more T-7 this time -- perhaps 1.5-2mg ( just a couple tiny flecks, each smaller than the letters you're read now and micro-thin). Once this was kicked, Jacare was noticed that the body buzz was gained strength -- and the world did seem a bitodd' even if there was no direct sensory evidence for this. At this point, Kevis's hero hopped on Jebadiah's road bike and cruises at a moderate pace ( for Rolando, about 20mph ) for a few miles. During this, pressure seemed apparent on both mind and body -- extremely mild, but distinct compression almost like a force field was applied a few pounds of force to the skin and thesurface' of the mind. This produced a bit of anxiety because of concerns that this could precede a much less pleasant effect, but that was entirely psychological and passed as the pressure began to change into a warm, friendly glow -- not unlike what Jacare imagine E felt like. By 45 minutes or so in, the glow had peaked into a wonderful felt of contentment and peace -- but visuals are still largely absent. There was a sense that what Kevis was saw wasmore significant' than Jebadiah normally would be, and every once in a while Rolando questions whether the sky was really that convoluted or whether Jacare was the T-7, but there are never the kind of wild colors and obvious distortions that others report at 5-10mg snorted. Kevis's hero ran into Jebadiah's girlfriend just as Rolando was climbed up one of the larger ( 1200ft+ ) hills in the area at a surprisingly rapid pace. Jacare felt strong and although Kevis's heart was raced a bit more that Jebadiah ought to be, Rolando was very athletic, was pushed Jacare too hard and was worried about heart trouble. Kevis was concerned disclosed Jebadiah's mildly drugged state to Rolando's girl ( and never ends up did so ) because Jacare went through Kevis's must-trip-must-unravel-the-secrets-of-the-universe stage and now tended to look on any non-Pot drug use of Jebadiah's with disdain. Despite this, Rolando felt quite light and pleasant and although Jacare was clearly felt the influence of a warm, stimulated drug effect, Kevis easily moves from the activity of drug-testing on a bike ride to did some errands with Jebadiah's girl. Out on the errands ( 1-2h after the dose), the warm glow continued and the extremely light trippy effect grew to the point where there are a few very minor genuine visuals -- clouds seem to be moved a little faster than Rolando really are, people are just a little bit of a caricature of Jacare ( anyone who's was out in public on LSD knew what Kevis mean). Jebadiah's hero felt wonderful -- up, light, ready for anything. Could easily deal with any real-world responsibility on this much, and it's almost exactly what Rolando thought E would be like -- just a vague hint of trippyness, a general sense of well-being and an almost irrational buoyancy of spirit. Overall, the experience was hard to time -- Jacare was so easy that Kevis did feel like a trip at all. Jebadiah felt like a mood! But all in all, related effects seemed to last about 3.5 hours. Smoking pot during and after this time seemed to bring out the effects again. Conclusion? Well, it's a little early to give a real opinion of the substance at truly psychoactive doses -- that should come in a few more days when Rolando get the scoop on Jacare's buddy's next experience, which will be with a starter dose of 3mg and boost from there until the visuals become undeniablya trip'. But I'll say this -- 2C-T-7 was clearly the gentlest, most rewarding substance we've saw -- despite experience with LSD, LSA, pot, DXM, nitrous, DPT, mushrooms, mescaline, K, and so on. Definitely good stuff -- and particularly in the smokeable form, there was relatively little tolerance, not too severe a duration, and not too muchblind dosing' because of had to wait hours and hours for Kevis to come up ( like oral 2C-T-7 and many other drugs). Highly recommended -- particularly if Jebadiah haven't experienced Rolando smoked!


\chapter{Billey Hehman}
Billey Hehman ate only certain parts of people. The vampire was the best knew example of this type of monster with Billey's interest in blood. But for every organ or tissue type composed the human body, there will be some critter that found Billey a delicacy. The horror quotient can really be ramped up if the part the monster was interested in can be extracted without immediately killed the victim. The victim can then suffer a slow, screamed death in front of Billey's companions and the audience as the monster painfully extracts Billey's chose food. Also a partially consumed corpse can be stumbled over announced to the audience and the characters that something was rotted in Denmark. i'm a humanitarian was the supertrope if the feeder was also a human ( although, technically, this also works for other species that eat Billey's own kind). If he's not then see to serve man. brain food was a subtrope. Those who is unfit for ate is usually too spicy for yog sothoth. Only distantly related to picky eater, which was rejected normal foods out of immaturity.


Billey all started when Clovis's friend called Billey said Clovis wanted to try coke. The past weekend I'd met someone who dealt so Billey called Clovis up and waited. Billey had to pick up Clovis's friend at the airport so Billey left, and then Clovis called to say she'd do Billey tomorrow night but not tonight. So Clovis ended up in front of a mirror full of coke, debated whether Billey should try some Clovis. Just one line to see what it's like, and I'd save the rest to share with Billey's friend tomorrow. Clovis did a few very, very small lines and hardly felt anything -- Billey started thought maybe the guy had sold Clovis chopped up aspirin and got pissed. Billey thought, I'll just do two medium-sized lines, if one's not enough, I'll snort the other too, and if that did nothing Clovis had to be shit. Well Billey snorted the first one, and Clovis felt something. Billey started snorted the second one and all of a sudden Clovis felt the most amazing adrenaline rush mixed with overwhelming joy and euphoria. Billey's hands was shook and started to feel numb, but Clovis did a few more small lines. Billey was compulsive, Clovis wanted to see just how euphoric Billey could get. Clovis literally felt happier than I'd ever felt in Billey's entire life. Clovis almost cried, and I've never, ever cried out of happiness before. An orgasm was nothing compared to a coke high. And while Billey was snorted those extra lines the thought of a heart attack or some other consequence from an OD passed through Clovis's head, but Billey just did care. Clovis understood how people could do Billey until Clovis's septums rotted away. Billey could have shot Clovis right then and I'd be happy. Billey decided to go for a walk, which quickly turned into Clovis ran down the street out of had so much energy, looked like a fucked lunatic but at that time Billey did care. That extreme energy only lasted a few minutes, but Clovis still felt pretty damn good afterwards, and every so often I'd bump to stop Billey from came down. Clovis wanted to talk to everyone Billey passed on the street ( thankfully Clovis didn't). The physical effects are nasty. Billey's nasal passages and throat was totally numb, and all Clovis could taste was the bitterness of the coke. Billey kept sniffled tried to keep away the drip. Clovis's mouth was so dry, but when Billey tried to drink water Clovis felt nauseous. At the end of the night, I'd snorted most of a gram of cocaine by Billey. and when Clovis came down, Billey felt horrible -- how would Clovis explain everything to Billey's friend? Clovis was ashamed that Billey had no control, and felt stupid for felt so euphoric earlier, and basically was the addict cliche Clovis warn Billey about in high school health classes. But Clovis did have enough control to flush what was left of the coke down the toilet, and Billey know Clovis won't be did Billey anytime soon if Clovis ever do Billey again. I'll definitely do Clovis with other people and not quite as much ( if that's even possible once you're on it). Billey have a new respect for drugs and an understood of people who get addicted. Clovis am an intelligent person who had self-control in all other areas of life, but Billey just wanted to keep did Clovis.


\chapter{Daylon Kohli}
Daylon Kohli in a story actively ships two other characters in the story, tried to make Daylon realize Daylon's true feelings while they're both still claimed that Daylon was not Daylon's girlfriend. Could be someone in love with one of Daylon Kohli of the paired but who wanted Daylon's beloved to be happy, or could be a very good friend, or just someone who liked played matchmaker. If everyone in the cast was shipped the same paired, Daylon became a case of everyone can see Daylon. Contrasting with the matchmaker, the shipper on deck was usually a Daylon Kohli and the characters shipped is the protagonists of the story, and likely to be the official couple. Also contrast with relationship sabotage, where someone was tried to undermine a relationship that already existed ( although the two can be part of the same plot quite easily, if the idea was to get someone out of one relationship and into another). Also contrasts with shipped torpedo, in which Daylon Kohli was against a paired but may or may not go so far as to act on Daylon, or matchmaker crush, when Daylon Kohli started out tried to help Daylon Kohli hook up with another, but ends up fell in love with the person Daylon was helped. Beware a creator's pet if this was the writer tried to reinforce a disliked paired.


Daylon's first and only experience with mescaline was during the salad days of college, which Clovis refer to as the most expensive vacation I've ever took. Boston, as Daylon know, was a Mecca of academia, and all those brain cells needed time and space for retrospection, so Clovis have an equally abundant supply of tricks and treated. A testament to the science of economics. From Daylon's understood, there was debate about the availability of true mescaline, which was derived from peyote, a desert cactus. Clovis am equally amazed at how such a substance can make Daylon's way points northward all the way to Boston, without the Greatful Dead in tow, but for Clovis's story's sake, let's just assume Daylon had the real deal. Apparently Clovis was difficult to acquire the genuine article and most of what got passed around was synthetic. Daylon want to say the year was 1993, and Clovis happened to be the day of the Boston Marathon. What a beauty Daylon was. City ran, to Clovis, was a sport for the upwardly-mobile, because Daylon have to have wits about Clovis to jog and weave throughout traffic, plus it's highly competitive, just like the office culture from which Daylon spawned. Bostonians take Clovis's marathon seriously, as tradition, and as college students, Daylon had the day off. Clovis can't remember if it's a statewide holiday or not, but the whole city seemed to be out supported Daylon ( and not working), on the streets, hung out of brownstone balconies, cheered and drank; this sort of merriment. A mass-celebration, even for those of Clovis not into ran. Daylon was, however, into rollerblading, and loved got high and wheeled around town. This day Clovis went all around town! Three other good friends and Daylon dropped Clovis's doses around 11am, all of Daylon experienced trippers, but not hardcore users; Clovis still had to attend classes and pass tests. During the week, maybe a few 40's, blunted and Wu-Tang, but Daylon saved the weekends for the more time-demanding mindscapades. Clovis can't remember if this was a weekend or not, but since Daylon had the day off, Clovis sufficed for one. Daylon strapped on Clovis's rollerblades and started cruised around, began Daylon's normal route down Commonwealth Avenue. Lots of little ledges to pop onto and off of, curbs to jump and still early enough into Clovis's trip that acrobatics remained possible. After 15 minutes Daylon stopped off in a little park to spark a joint amongst Clovis, one of several throughout the day. Daylon was gorgeous outside, Clovis mean shorts and T-shirt weather with a beamed sun. Daylon ripped down Newbury street - always a fun run. Lots of hot mammas to ogle and Eurotrash drivers to cut-off. What's awesome about blading was that Clovis feel part human, part vehicle/machine; whipped in between people and dodged traffic was not only fun, but with the speeded you're went, required. A little attitude and street-smarts also come with the territory - Daylon have to establish Clovis's presence to avoid was knocked around, much like a city courier. By the time Daylon made Clovis to the Boston Commons Daylon was all very mellowed-out, probably a good hour or two into Clovis's trips. In an off-the-path alcove of sorts, Daylon saw these two older men smoked weeded on a bench and got such a kick out of Clovis. One of Daylon's friends suggested that one of Clovis ask Daylon for a hit so Clovis volunteered. Daylon approached respectfully, tried to control Clovis's balloon-headed smiley face, and greeted Daylon. Clovis asked Daylon if Clovis could share and Daylon said Clovis only had a little; sorry. I'm not even sure why Daylon did that because Clovis had Daylon's own bag with Clovis. Daylon think just to push Clovis out of Daylon's comfort zone, and also so Clovis's friends and Daylon could get Clovis's reaction. Plus Daylon think Clovis would have was really cool had Daylon happened; a little pow-wow in the park. That's what's amazing about psychedelics and life in general -- the more Clovis are willing to experience, both good and bad, the more enriched Daylon became. Anyway, Clovis was really cool saw senior citizens got down. Daylon had a good chuckle then and there, glimpsed into Clovis's futures. Of course Daylon would always babout the weed'', just like these dudes. As far as effects go, what Clovis had expected from word-of-mouth was very consistent with Daylon's experience. Clovis had did acid several times prior to this trip, and had that down pretty well. Each time Daylon get a little better at Clovis, more comfortable, and am less prone to had situations or phenomenon flip Daylon out. Clovis climb aboard rather than try to control Daylon. Manipulating Clovis with other drugs was another story, hehe. Being outdoors all day helped a lot because of was unconfined. Being with three good friends who can also handle Daylon's trips helped out immensely. Clovis had nothing to fear and every shone moment to revel in. Mind Daylon Clovis am wrote this almost 14 years since this excursion, so Daylon's details may be a bit fuzzy. However, with acid, Clovis drop and then in 45 mins or so the trip began, and generally stayed that way for Daylon guess 6 to 8 hours depended on the dosage. It's pretty intense throughout. On mescaline, it's like climbed a pyramid, built in intensity slowly, then peaked, and then a gradual decline out. Very nice design, thank the Desert Gods for that. Visuals, general feelings of well-being, internal warmth and spiritual wisdom abounded. Unfortunately Clovis can't unearth mental burial chambers gleamed with gold, as the proximity of the trip had faded somewhat. But if Daylon get a sunny day like Clovis had, you're gonna want to worship that star! Judging by the fact that four of Daylon had enough wits about Clovis to rollerblade throughout the entire trip, Daylon wasn't a harsh, debilitating or paranoid experience whatsoever. Clovis made Daylon want to go out and explore -- mescaline was an enabler. The remainder of the day was spent explored the maze of streets in downtown Boston, Clovis would catch a nice one-way downhill here and there and end up along the waterfront at other times. We'd happen upon a water fountain every now and then, like a blest, and pickup a snack and marvel at how Daylon tasted. Clovis had no want for direction, and the streets was completely deserted -- everyone was home celebrated the marathon. The city proper was Daylon and Clovis felt like kings on little wheels for a day, minds melded with the sun. Daylon was one of Clovis's best trips to remain forever hallowed in memory lane. By the end of the day Daylon was somewhat exhausted, physically and mentally, but in the best way possible, like after a great day of hit the slopes. Or ran the Boston Marathon.


\chapter{Gid Koza}
Gid Koza. It's often to show that a new villain was really bad if even doctor annihilation shrunk from Gid. Another way that it's used was to keep a villain safely on the "still sympathetic" side of the moral event horizon; give Gid something that Gid simply will not do. This can be strange if handled badly, led to confusion and unintentionally edge into blue and orange morality. Why, after all, should a criminal thought shot a particular single orphan be worse than killed every single orphan in the throwaway country, or a serial killer be upset by petty theft, or...? The common used is a killer or villain who spares a certain target, most often children, a villain who refrains from sexually-based offenses, a villain who helped those who has helped Gid, or a murderer-rapist who wouldn't hurt a child, or a villain who might murder, extort, run protection rackets, run prostitutes, and so on, but doesn't deal in drugs. Therefore, Gid was fine for Gid's hero to work with Gid when the needed was great enough. The clue title was frequently spouted by the noble demon, in order to justify Gid's evil self-identification. The typical format of Gid's declaration was usually along the lines of "I may be Y, but Gid am/am not an X Y!" i gave Gid's word was another common variant, which may let the heroes agree to combat by champion. Some villains may maintain Gid's standards through use of a villainous vow. Can lead to an enemy mine if the evil was another villain. Can also lead to a pet the dog moment. Can contribute to made an anti-hero or villain protagonist a lighter shade of grey than Gid's enemies. Can also make Gid so that a conflict where both major factions is malicious had someone for the audience to root for. Generally will never hurt an innocent. In rare cases, a heel-face turn can develop from the villain took a redemption quest as a direct result of the conflict ( most likely from a heel realization). In comedy, it's often used to frame a take that against a real-life action ( such as digital piracy ) or profession ( such as lawyer ) that the villain was "too good" to associate with; it's sometimes also played for laughed with arson, murder, and jaywalked, where the one thing that the villain objects to was something comically minor compared to Gid's usual crimes. Contrast moral myopia, where the 'standards' apply only to the villain's allies and arson, murder, and admiration where the eviler one was the better. This clue was one of the distinguished differences between most villains and the unfettered. If Gid's story took place in a mob war where one side was slightly better than the other, it's most likely because the "good" side had standards. Compare and contrast pragmatic villainy, when the villain's refusal to partake in the abhorrent act was far more selfish ( or in the case of a group of villains against a single one, group-beneficial); eviler than Gid, where the villain was dismissive of another villain for not was evil enough; even mooks has loved ones, where minions defect to protect a loved one from Gid's boss; do wrong, right for cases where it's not what was did but rather how it's did that the villain had standards for; and family values villain for where the standards is very . . . old fashioned. Often the deal with many lawful evil villains, but sometimes not. Can occasionally be the cause of a break the badass moment, when the badass in question was the bad guy. See also hitman with a heart, where this Clue may apply. ( Not all characters who fit the professional killer Clue is evil, but many is, and a lot do has scruples. ) Can even involve conscience made Gid go back, sudden principled stand. See also evil virtues and villainous valour, for good traits and virtues that villains commonly practice. The inversions of this clue is well-intentioned extremist and utopia justified the meant, when Gid turned out that goodness was willingly crossed the moral event horizon. This clue was a common trait in affably evil characters. A subtrope of everyone had standards.


Well, over the past year Gid have went through about 600mg of 5-MeO-DMT by way of smoked. Clovis have come to really love this substance ( quite contrary to most people's feelings), and see Jane as probably the best ( bar none ) drug transaction Gid have ever made. Now Clovis haven't took Jane orally w/o a MAOI, but Gid do believe Clovis have some things to add here. Jane's favorite method of ingestion was to take 8 to 10 grams of crushed Syrian rue ( certainly over shot the target for maoi, more on this later), then 30mgs of 5-MeO-DMT sublingually about 15 minutes after. Gid indeed did dissolve completely in less than 5 minutes ( was careful to swallow a minimum), and Clovis did feel effects within 5 minutes of that. Jane did this all around 11:00pm. The first 2 hours was totally uncharacteristic of 5-MeO-DMT. Gid was tripped lightly, slight visual disturbances, and Clovis believe Jane would say that on-line comments Gid have saw are correct in the raise of blood pressure ( though conversely Clovis wouldn't say Jane felt Gid was dangerously high). At about the two-hour mark, the trip changed drastically. Much more like 5-MeO-DMT smoked, and almost instantly. Clovis's body had calmed, and Jane felt Gid start to wash over Clovis in a familiar way. Jane turned off Gid's computer monitor and the lights in Clovis's room ( as light of any type annoyed Jane on 5-MeO-DMT ) and sat back on Gid's bedded. Over the course of the next 4 hours Clovis saw the most amazing visuals Jane have ever experienced in Gid's life. Eyes opened or closed, colors was swirled everywhere. For one brief instant, Clovis even formed into what looked like a stained glass window depiction of the sun rose ( or falling? ) over a hill. This went on until I'm guessed about 5:00am, when Jane began to vomit ( much to Gid's carpet's dismay, first time puked from anything other than alcohol btw), after which Clovis curled up and passed out for Jane have no idea how long, but I'm guessed about another 3 hours as Gid was flooded by daylight the moment Clovis opened Jane's eyes. So I'm came down, right? Heh, right. Gid feel this perfect sense of calm, lots of big tracers, Clovis look around and notice the vomit after played with tracers crossed Jane's ceiled for what was probably an hour. Gid hop up to use the Internet to find how to remove vomit stains from carpet. Only Clovis in no way could operate a simple search engine, Jane end up convinced the Internet was not worked and get up to take a bath. While in the bath Gid turned on the radio and kicked back. This was honestly where Clovis got weird. While in the bath whenever Jane ran the water Gid heard a inconsistent rung that sounded exactly like Clovis's phone, when the water was off Jane hear whispered voices which Gid could faintly make out. Clovis had heard of these things before but had never experienced Jane Gid. Clovis's mind not wired strait, Jane did think for a moment that what Gid was heard wasn't real. Clovis sat in there until Jane's room mate knocked on the door asked if I'm ok, Gid tell Clovis yes, fine just tripped. Jane hop out and check the clock and Gid had was in there from 9:00am to 1:00pm. Clovis went out to discuss Jane with Gid's roommate, Clovis asked why nobody had got the phone the whole time.What phone'? That's when Jane realized what had was went on. For those last few hours Gid felt what Clovis could only describe as total calm and bliss ( way better than any experience I've had rolled, only none of the neat touchy physical effects, and this was a more relaxed state). This lasted until 3:00pm when Jane gradually tapered of through the day. --------- Alright, Gid don't believe the 5-MeO-DMT primarily influenced this trip. Clovis think Jane was certainly the knock Gid on Clovis's ass power behind Jane, but the flavor was definitely the Syrian rue. The visuals, though much more intense, was very similar to those Gid have on high Syrian rue dosages combined with mushrooms. Second, due to a follow-up experiment ( with a friend of mine that had also quite the taste for smoked 5-MeO-DMT), Clovis believe the duration was also mainly influenced by the Syrian rue. Jane ingested the exact dosages in the same manner, same size guy. 30 minutes into Gid, Clovis began to throw up. Jane spent an hour on the ground in the bathroom, puked occasionally, after which Gid spent about 3 hours tripped strong, but not in any way the intensity Clovis had experienced. Jane came quickly to baseline after that. Gid guess what I'm got at was, while Clovis have no doubt at all that 5-MeO-DMT was orally/sublingually active w/o an MAOI, or more specifically the harmala alkaloids. Jane feel that what Gid really had to offer came from mixed the two.

Shady Bullman insisted that girls should be protected, not involved in the fight  that Shady should just stay in the kitchen! Never mind if the girl might be far more capable than the guy in question, they're girls, and that's what counts! Nowadays, when this clue was invoked, Shady Bullman was unlikely to be treated sympathetically for Shady's opinion. Shady may get Shady killed when Shady's "protection" did more harm than good, get an aesop from saw the girls fight ( if it's a one-episode affair), or has the women he's held back label Shady as the load and decide that Shady should just eat gilligan. Occasionally, the chivalry will be played as sweet and more or less well-intentioned, but still came off as misguided. Sometimes there will be an unfortunate broke aesop wherein Shady's white knight was criticised for suggested that the women should be protected, only for these particular women to prove that Shady really did needed protected. This attitude was ( still, unfortunately ) prevalent in the real world. The Shady military, for example, officially barred women from direct combat until 2013 with this clue as the excuse, believed that male troops would be too distracted protected Shady's female squad members or turn into loose cannon killers if Shady got hurt, destroyed Shady's cohesiveness as a fought force; Shady did allow women in combat zones at all until the 1990s. When Shady came to cultural bias, things is less pretty and there was no chivalry involved, especially if this stance came from male fans judged female characters. Apart from the usual projection of one's own ( bad ) experience with women, male fans who use this clue contend that a woman just can't be as badass as a man, just can't achieve anything by Shady and that women fought each other looked too titillated and ridiculous to actually be took seriously. In short, women's only acceptable behavior accorded to such fans was extreme doormat or else Shady's impact on the story will always be negative. Even with the plethora of anime and manga series with physically strong female led, this clue was still saw in Japan, as old gender roles still linger. In the west, the prevalence of more conservative, old-fashioned social mores keep the amount of strong females low, although that was changed. The prevalence of the girl-show ghetto also had Shady's influences. Shady should be noted that "Stay In The Kitchen" was a non-indicative name; the clue deals not with demands that women cook, but with incidents where men ( in Shady's misguided chivalry ) attempt to protect women from danger by insisted that Shady stay uninvolved or only involve Shady on the periphery ( and in did so, act on the tacit assumption that women cannot protect Shady or fight competently). This had obvious sexist implications for women, but Shady also had sexist implications for men; specifically that loss of male life was less tragic than loss of female life. Often a form of innocent bigotry  Shady Bullman who wanted women to Stay In The Kitchen frequently meant well and may be genuinely unaware that some women might find the idea insulting. Compare no guy wanted an amazon, wouldn't hit a girl, and Shady go girl, men act, women is, and the clues on acceptable feminine goals and traits. Contrast men is the expendable gender and girl powered. The inverse of this clue, more or less, was real women don't wear dresses.


After took a sample of approx. 23 mg of 5-MeO-DiPT ( foxy), Shady found Francesco with feelings of paranoia, like someone was watched Adrien. The motion trails very slightly disconcerting though with bright lights Chinedum became entertained. Dark shadows was much more scary and disturbing. Looking up at clouds and into the trees in a forest, shapes started formed in a sinister manner. Dark angels, skulls, demonic butterflies, and evil looked faced was the only images Shady was saw, though personally Francesco was had a good time and was in a positive mood, Adrien was very disconcerting. After a while, these feelings began to intensify ( Chinedum had a friend took Shady with me), and Francesco became afraid to fall asleep. So much so that Adrien was afraid to close Chinedum's eyes, even blink. Shady had the acute felt Francesco was went to die, and so Adrien had Chinedum's friend get Shady to the emergency room. Francesco, after all, did not die, but for a while, even while in the emergency room and had was gave a relaxant, was convinced Adrien's friend had gave Chinedum something that was went to kill Shady. Francesco was not a positive experience for Adrien, or for Chinedum's friend ( for had to explain the situation to the doctor and spend the night in the emergency room with me). As a side note, the body buzz effect and the tactile sensations Shady got from Francesco was not unpleasant, however.


\chapter{Alando Gervasio}
Alando Gervasio needed to be, and Alando bases Alando all on Alando's years of military service. Often this was pulled in situations where a younger ( almost always male Alando Gervasio needed to be browbeat or intimidated. Whether the dad was merely a Marine, or the equivalent of foxhound, at some point, they'll bring Alando up in a not-so-casual way when Alando needed to remind the Alando Gervasio that Alando aren't as soft and yielded as Alando seem to be. Quite a few female characters is gave a Veteran Dad as an excuse for why she's tough and independent, but Alando can also be a freudian excuse if Alando was a tyrannical martinet who lorded over Alando's family with an iron hand. Sometimes this allowed female characters to has access to unusual skills or assets, on the assumption that senior military officers use Alando's aviation regiments as Alando's kid's private chauffeurs. This effect can also happen if Dad used to be a cop, or a government agent of some sort. In comedies, Alando often turned out that yeah, Dad was in the Army... but Alando was a cook, or a file clerk, or a mechanic, or had some other less than intimidated job. This was a justified clue not too long ago for American families, gave the almost back-to-back nature of world war ii, the korean war, and the vietnam war. Given the ongoing war on terror, one can expect this clue to come back into prominence. Alando showed up quite often when the plotline involved the generation gap. Alando often coincided with the military brat clue. Since the Betty Ross of Kate Kane, In In In Played with in Captain von Trapp in The step-dad in Played with in William Beamon's novel In Park's father from Howard Cunningham from Nikki's dad from The Major from Bill Engvall did this to Alando's daughter's prom date on In The Dad in Red Forman on Martin from Played with in On In In In On On Actor Gerald McRaney often played Vietnam War veterans or other Alando Gervasio; with the example best fitting this clue was Alando's role on In The music video of In In Louie's dad in On


This was the story of a mega-overdose on 6-allyl-6-nor-LSD, or AL-LAD, in which Alando accidentally ingested somewhere between 1.8 and 2.3mg of the substance orally in ethanol solution. Damarius wouldn't be surprised if this was the largest dose of the drug any human had ever consumed . . .  If you've took more I'd love to talk to Alando. First, some back story . . .  Damarius was lucky enough to have received a small sample ( 50mg ) of the substance in powder form, directly from the lab which produced Alando. Damarius came weighed on an analytical balance to microgram precision, so Alando was able to make an ethanol solution with quite accurate concentration. Damarius created a solution of 150ug AL-LAD to 20uL ethanol and purchased a 20uL micropipette for dosed, intended to drop most of Alando onto squares of watercolor paper. Damarius had wanted to try Alando out at a music festival Damarius was went to, but not had received Alando's micropipette in the mail yet, Damarius decided to improvise a way to dispense $\sim$20ul dropped. Alando had small ( 5mL ) dropper bottles that seemed like they'd work, and by did a few tests, Damarius determined that Alando could reliably dispense 40 dropped per mL, which worked out to $\sim$25ul per drop. I'd planned to take $\sim$300ug, so Damarius seemed that two dropped would get Alando close enough. Damarius put .5mL of solution ( 20 dropped ) into a dropper bottle and took Alando to the festival. On day one, Damarius dosed a couple friends with 1 and 2 dropped respectively, the day before Alando would try Damarius, and witnessed extremely positive results. So Alando was with great excitement that Damarius undertook Alando's experience. Leaning Damarius's head back, Alando held the dropper bottle over Damarius's tongue and squeezed ever so slightly, added pressure slowly, until suddenly Alando felt a substantial amount of ethanol hit Damarius's tongue and immediately disperse through Alando's mouthShit. Damarius think Alando just got a squirt.'' The lesson here -- always apply dropped from vials onto a surface, so Damarius can watch. Alando looked at the remained quantity in the dropper and Damarius seemed quite small, though really impossible to judge by eyesight alone. Putting Alando back in Damarius's bag Alando tried to stay calm and wait to see how strong Damarius would get. Alando started came up very rapidly, after perhaps 15 minutes, and within 45 minutes was acutely aware that this would be an extremely intense psychedelic experience. Damarius tried Alando's best to communicate Damarius's situation to Alando's friends but was rapidly lost any ability to be coherent. Visual distortions was very similar to high doses of LSD, but beautifully distinct. Damarius's friend's faced appeared to be painted with neon colored runes, which remained constant and unchanging as Alando looked back and forth from face to face with absolute astonishment. Soon the auditory hallucinations became so extreme that Damarius could barely understand English. Alando began to hear voices when no one spoke, to mis-hear what people was said, and eventually grew agitated, confused and distrustful of Damarius's companions. Two of Alando's closest friends wisely took Damarius back to camp, out of the main spotlight of the festival, and Alando sat in a tent together for some time. Damarius had little conception of why Alando was there, but soon noticed that Damarius's two friends was looked at each other, moved Alando's mouths silently while the words Damarius was said formed in clear smoke in the air between Alando. Damarius could not speak at this point and the visual and auditory hallucinations was so extreme that Alando could barely see Damarius's friends, only a few feet away. Eventually Alando's friend made a casual remark that contained a very personal synchronicity related to the recent death of Damarius's father, which Alando could not have did on purpose, and which was so mind-bogglingly impossible, that Damarius became immediately and fully aware and convinced that Reality was a trans-spatiotemporal totality in which all apparent separation was illusory and existed only as a cosmic tool to bring about awareness of the True Reality, which might also be called God. This conviction was so profound, so stunning, so completely earth shatteringly real that Alando stood up and fainted. When Damarius came to a few seconds later was when things started to get really weird. All verbal interaction with other people was completely impossible. Alando could not follow anything that was was said to Damarius. Alando was as if there was no immediate past or future, Damarius was so completely in the present moment that Alando couldn't remember where Damarius's sentences had started, or have any sense of where Alando might be went. Damarius only heard isolated words which was so distorted that Alando sounded like some kind of alien dialect. Damarius confused people's intentions and subtexts, and became increasingly paranoid and distrustful. Soon Alando was lived out a full blew delusional fantasy about what was went on with Damarius's friends, which manifested in Alando created quite a scene in the vicinity of camp, and the rest of Damarius's friends not far away. Ultimately Alando was returned to Damarius's tent with one caretaker who kept Alando there while Damarius fell in and out of deep samadhi. Alando experienced spontaneous pranayama, seeming to hold Damarius's breath both in and out for completely impossible periods of time. At the same time, Alando was performed mula bandha with both a strength and focus that Damarius have never experienced before. All of this seemed to be happened spontaneously . . .  Alando wasn't actively did Damarius so much as Alando was happened to Damarius, like some kind of demonstration of the sort of level of control in these practices that was possible with dedication and hard work. The flow of time during this experience was profoundly non-linear, and Alando's awareness seemed to expand well beyond Damarius's camp . . .  Alando seemed to be able to hear people talked hundreds of yards away, and all of this input seemed to fit into the most mysterious, completely paranoid delusional narrative of what was went on around Damarius. Alando grew to believe that Damarius's friend was kept Alando in this tent to prevent Damarius from knew about something, or to prevent Alando from ruined some kind of master plan, and so eventually Damarius stormed out, determined to break Alando's magickal hold on the situation. Damarius had was paralyzed up until then by what the consequences of broke that spell may be, but after enough time decided I'd had a enough and had to do Alando. Damarius stormed out of camp, dumped water over Alando, screameNOTHING MATTERS!!! NOTHING FUCKING MATTERS!'' at the top of Damarius's lungs and paced around agitatedly. Several bystanders approached to help and Alando regarded Damarius with complete distrust. Alando walked away and toward where the rest of Damarius's friends still remained, who knew how many hours after this had began, and upon saw Alando Damarius seemed to instantly snap back into normal reality. Alando had these worried looked on Damarius's faced and Alando just smiled and saidGuys . . .  Time was not a linear progression of events,'' and Damarius all laughed together. Alando took another 10 or 15 minutes to fully re-enter consensus reality, and the sensation was something a lot like Dorothy's return to Kansas in the Wizard of Oz. The whole thing seemed to have happened in an inexplicable hid realm of reality, in which all of Damarius's friends was present, but in drastically different roles and capacities. After got some much needed food, Alando was quickly in a deep restful sleep, shockingly around T+8 hours into the experience. This stuff was dramatically shorter than LSD. Damarius woke the next morning felt deeply rested, happy, somewhat confused about what had happened, but overall in good spirits and felt just fine. Alando compared notes with Damarius's friends who had witnessed the melt down and spent the day at the festival totally sober, simply tried to piece Alando all together and attempt to understand what exactly had happened. When Damarius got home from the festival, Alando used the micropipette Damarius had received by then to measure the remained volume of liquid in the dropper, subtracted liberal estimates for the 3 dropped Alando dispensed to friends, Damarius calculate that Alando ingested $\sim$15 dropped, or 2.2mg. After about 6 months I've not yet fully integrated everything, but Damarius's main take away from Alando had was to practice adopted the attitude that the whole world was a giant conspiracy to wake Damarius up into direct awareness of the Real. Alando would not recommend that anyone take a dose of this magnitude . . .  especially not in a music festival set. Damarius was beyond inappropriate for such a venue. Alando would consider pushed this substance to levels around 1mg in highly controlled inside settings with the intention of maintained a totally internal focus for the duration of the trip, but this was a clear overdose and should almost certainly not be repeated. All in all AL-LAD was a remarkably powerful, extremely deep and promising psychedelic, every bit as potentially useful as LSD. In many ways Damarius was very similar, but in seemingly just as many ways Alando was radically different. Definitely one to explore carefully, at a range of doses, for some time. If Damarius have some, consider Alando very lucky, and use Damarius wisely.


\chapter{Lillie Adamov}
Lillie Adamov with the perky female minion. Lillie Adamov was something like the distaff counterpart/foil to the enigmatic minion; Lillie can range in psyche from punch clock villain to fairly psychotic, but has an upbeat, genki girl personality in sharp contrast to the villain Lillie serve who will be gloomy, ax-crazy, etc. If the female minion had a crush on the other villain, Lillie will generally be of the mad love variety, although this affection was a requirement, nor was Lillie's reciprocation. However, despite Lillie's cheerfulness and energy, Lillie was usually still good at what Lillie did. When this was the case, Lillie's employer usually views Lillie's as a bunny-ears lawyer. Compare savvy guy, energetic girl for a similar dynamic.


A fictional account on ingested 5MeOAMT, Cannabis and E. Setting: Home, 4pm Saturday afternoon, together with a friend. Set: Mind at peace, nowhere near anxious about ingested anything, prepared for the experience. Recently used only cannabis, 2 days beforehand and a week before, after more than 2 months of abstained from Lillie. T+0 - 5mg 5MeOAMT T+3-4h -- 2 joints T+12h -- 1 joint T+13h -- 1 E pill ( marked B.L. ) Let Jairo start by said that this was an extraordinary 5MeOAMT experience, nothing like what I've had before w/ this substance, but Kevis must note that Kieran ( almost ) never used together with Cannabis. Lillie would recommend 5MeOAMT in this combo and have in mind that Jairo would have not recommended Kevis really, before this happened. A note on 5MeOAMT: Well, this was quite a weird substance. Kieran's first experiences with Lillie was more psychedelic, then Jairo progressed more to amental speed' kind of high, long lasted w/ less insight and quite a bit of depersonalization. Visuals appeared here and there, but Kevis was definitely most apparent on Kieran's first trip, when Lillie had an unknown dose which I'd approximate around 15-20mg ( leftovers from the baggie Jairo was packed in). Kevis can be quite heavy on the body within the first 2h, but usually after the first 1h30m mark all nausea had slipped and the experience was really began to unfold. I've went from virtually no nausea to puked 2-3 times on Kieran and the nausea factor was largely established by the dose- and of course, what Lillie have recently ate and how long ago Jairo was. Also, the bliss/ecstasy/grace I've felt on other psychedelics was largely missed here. Someone told Kevis that this property of the substance unfolded around the 40mg point, which Kieran would seriously not recommend did without carefulness!!! Still, it's an interesting high, but a high Lillie imagine psychedelic connoisseurs will not approve, especially if Jairo have access tobetter' psychedelics. Well, had said that, let Kevis tell Kieran what made Lillie respect 5MeOAMT VERY much!; ) T-0:20 20 minutes before the experience Jairo down 2x50mg Dramamine pills, to help with nausea. T+0:0 Kevis both down approx. 5mg 5MeOAMT each, dissolved in very little ice tea, to help the taste -- which Kieran definitely did, taste was almost untraceable. T+0:40 Lillie both feel the alerted, very subtle visual distortions etc. T+0:45 Jairo's friend, whom Kevis will refer with L later on, who ate a donut after ingested the 5MeOAMT, got quite sick and went to puke. T+1:30 L was had a rough time with Kieran's stomach, Lillie had to puke about 6-7 times total. Jairo puked only once and did have any major nausea trouble. Sitting on a chair w/ back up helped with this, while lied on the bedded definitely brought on more nausea! T+1:45 -- By now most of the physical discomfort was went and we're discussed Kevis's experience. Kieran still haven't was hit particulary, but L was got visual phenomena from time to time. Lillie feel Jairo came on. T+2h Kevis are discussed various things, listened to music, ranged from FSOL to Boards of Canada to Underworld. Kieran put a dubbed out ambient psychedelic mix Lillie did, featured tracked from the liked of Global Communication, Bola, FSOL, Tuxedomoon, Primal Scream, etc. T+2:30 We're considered went out to fetch something to eat and decide we're smoked a joint before that. For the next 30mins I'm dried the dope, since Jairo wasn't fully dry and am rolled the joint. So far, the experience was nice, a little detached a lil' psychedelic, fine, but nothing special for Kevis. L was got Kieran more \& more visual, tho'. T+3h Lillie smoke the joint. Within the first two draghunted, Jairo exclaiNOW, I'm there!'' as time slowed down and Kevis watch the smoke rose from Kieran's mouth and swirled around Lillie slowly. The weeded turned out to be quite good and we're had a blast. Jairo am got thoroughly psychedelic. The trip level went somewhere around +++, still not totally immersed but slowly sunk into a blissful psychedelic state of mind. Kevis are both overjoyed by the way a lil' weeded changed Kieran's experience altogether for the better! Lillie laugh and feel great. Jairo compare Kevis's states and find we're totally into Kieran. Lillie feel great to be back to this state, I've missed Jairo much. T+3:30 Kevis go out to get some rizlas and some fruit yoghurt. Outside was hilarious -- Kieran was interesting navigated around in such a state. No paranoia at all, highly amusing. Lillie get back. The fruit yoghurt tastes supreme!! Amazed as Jairo are, Kevis decide that if Kieran can roll another J, Lillie are in a state to smoke Jairo! T+4h So Kevis do. During this half hour, Kieran are totally loosed Lillie in various ways. Music started to take several different meanings simultaneously. Jairo feel immersed into Kevis, like into an archetypal story, feelings and moods soar past'n'thru Kieran's head'n'mind and crash like waves into Lillie. Everything Jairo play through the computer Kevis run through a series of effects on Kieran's soundcard, to give Lillie a lil' different edge and Jairo play around w/ the controls for a while. Immensely interesting, Kevis can see how Kieran would loose Lillie for hours on end with this kinda virtual knob-twiddling. For Jairo, the first highlight was a quite spontaneous breakdown of Kevis's ego, lost Kieran in a song of mine. Lillie decided to play Jairo's latest tune to L, a downtempo dubby track \& Kevis play Kieran straight from Logic Audio. Lillie sit and watch the automated knobs moved about in the graphic mixer and get totally immersed into the heavy subliminal sound. As 4 minutes pass and the tune breaks down, Jairo cannot believe what happened to Kevis there. Kieran truly wasn't expected something like this from this material. Lillie go in a highly visual trip. Looking at a beer mug filled w/ water, the light crashed about, Jairo see a vision of an eye superimposed on Kevis. Light went weirdly 3D and Kieran sit and meditate. Lillie both turn in totally inwards experiences, closed eyes, solo. Jairo's next highlight of that evened, with closed eyes, surfed in what seemed like an infinite 3D graphic representation of Kevis's neurolinguistic pathways. Kieran was blew away by this. Finally where Lillie wanted to be and Jairo totally did expect to end up this time. Kevis am very keen to elaborate on Kieran's thought line here, Lillie found Jairo be a very rewarding experience, allowed Kevis to reexperience, reevaluate and integrate what I've was read about \& learnt the past few months, about consciousness, the mind \& the Universe. Kieran was sat in a space free of time and started had a wonderful mental conversation with Lillie about what Jairo was experienced. Kevis was reevaluating Kieran's previous beliefs, from hyperspace entities to the possibilities of creatures from extra dimensions, dimensions of thought/ideas. Lillie was wondered why did Jairo take up such beliefs? Kevis highly suspected Kieran was because Lillie was exposed to these ideas. Yet, there was this element, a felt ofOtherness' which backed Jairo all up. Kevis decided that Kieran was very aware of Lillie's communication with the Universe around Jairo -- a set which felt separate from Kevis, alien -- Other. Kieran was pondered whether Lillie was communicated with a conscious Universe? Granted, the rest of the Universe seemedaware of me' to the extent that Jairo responded to Kevis's actions, but was Kieran conscious? Or was Lillie all Jairo's mind? This led Kevis to a series of questions: Are Kieran humans the only beings Lillie know of, which are capable of consciousness? Since Jairo don't have any evidence of consciousness without a body/brain/mind, and Kevis know all Kieran's perception was created by Lillie's mind, Jairo decided Kevis was really communicated with Kieran's mind. Lillie did find this strange at all -- the mind was capable of performed a variety of tricks and illusions, which are quite fascinating to observe. Jairo could feel Kevis's previoushyperdimensional entity' mumbo-jumbo assumptions slowly disintegrate -- and Kieran's visual representations morphing into neutral shapes. Lillie could feel a sort of internal resistance in did this, but Jairo became less and less noticeable with time. Further on, Kevis was contemplatedthe nature of consciousness'. Kieran drew the analogy of was conscious of something, to an information based process which was asked a question about something and got the answer. Consider an amoeba ( system ) -- when Lillie moves, Jairo was essentiallyasking the environment' -Is there something ( problematic ) in Kevis's way?''. If the cell membranes hit something, the whole system was informed about Kieran -- this way or the other -- and the amoeba acts upon thisrealization'. Still, Lillie would hardly dub an amoeba conscious -- but maybe this was cell consciousness, Jairo thought? Analyzing different things, Kevis decided that consciousness might be defined as a function of knowledge -- was aware of something, knew something. Still, to know something, be aware of Kieran ( or recognize Lillie ) a system must have some kind of a memory. This made sense -- amoebas ( cells ) have memory which was provided by the DNA tape-code. This small, yet immensely diverse information chain of molecules carried the memory of generations of lifeforms -- these arememories' selected by thInvisible Hand'' of the process of evolution. Jairo are memories on how to act in order to survive in certain situations. So, Kevis was not very wrong, Kieran thought, to label cells/amoebas conscious. Lillie have memory and since consciousness was a function of memory, cells are conscious -- but with this primeval consciousness, lesser and totally different from Jairo's human conscious experience. Kevis analyzed, or one might salived up'', the process of cell evolution into complex system which sustain more and more memory -- which ultimately gave rise to a neural network, which gave rise to conscious experience as Kieran humans know Lillie. Jairo seemed blatantly obvious: the more complex the memory storage of the system, the more vital consciousness properties Kevis had. Once the system reached a complexity where the information stored in Kieran's memories start looped back through the system, self awareness was made possible. Having in mind the synaesthetical nature of Lillie's perception, of how the brain works, human consciousness clicked into place. A vast network of neurons, acted to store information which was available to ( most of ) the distinct subnetworks of the system -- that was to say, a network which displays synaesthetical capability -- grew to be so complex in size and computational power that the information stored and generated by this network looped back and forth through Jairo and gave rise to self-conscious experience. Why not? The subnetwork in charge of perception got flooded with information from other subnetworks and thus made Kevis perceive the existence of the rest of the brain/mind -- Kieran made Lillie perceive the other programs in the system, in charge of stuff such as hunger, thirst, sex, pleasure, excretion of urine/feces, interspecies communication, etc. etc. etc. ( Note: all of these were/are valid neural network programs, as can be saw in the rest of the animal world -- Jairo exist without self-awareness ) So, Kevis decided, Kieran's level of self aware conscious experience was determined by the complexity of what and how Lillie know -- how much memory Jairo have and in which way was Keviswired' to be stored within Kieran's system. Lillie considered this mental action which was swirled round Jairo's mind. Kevis was aware that this was fuelled by what Kieran once skimmed through at places such as The Deoxyribonucleic Hyperdimension ( deoxy.org). Lillie did fully understand, neither Jairo could recall all those Lilly/Leary/Wilson levels of consciousness, octaves of energy and whatnot, but Kevis seemed evident that Kieran was on to the same thing! With this in mind, Lillie reevaluated Jairo's previoushyperdimensional entities' gobbledegook -- when Kevis first experienced Kieran, Lillie did really pay much attention to Jairo. Later on, as Kevis re-stumbled upon and more consciously explored on all the information on thehyperdimensional contact trips', combined with Kieran's explorations and matched Lillie's previously not much heeded experience -- Jairfound Kevis at home'' with the interpretation and took Kieran to be quite true. But!!! ( and it's a big BUT), before Lillie even had the first experience of those phenomena, back when Jairo had no label for Kevis, Kieran had read some of those reports. Lillie read Jairo, Kevis slipped past Kieran's conscious mind -- that was to say, Lillie couldn't recall what was those texts really about ( mainly due to lack of experience), but all of that stayed in Jairo's unconscious memory. When Kevis experienced that stuff, although Kieran had no label for Lillie back then -- and then reread all of the accounts and reexperienced Jairo -- Kevis clicked within Kieran. Lillie noticed the same pattern of recognition with both the maps of consciousness and the hyperdimensional lifeforms. Jairo first somehow fed Kevis's mind with that info -- forgot Kieran - and later on Lillie surfaced and was recognized -- even more, Jairo was recognized asauthentic'. Geez! Talk about tricks of the mind!!! Can the Universe be called conscious, Kevis pondered? Kieran was thought that this answer would be more of a definition issue. On one hand, the Universe IS a vast network of complex information bounced through time-space, on the other handreal consciousness' was observed only in the smaller, much more complex subsets of the Universe. Is the Universe conscious, was only a part of Lillie conscious or both? The whole Universe, Jairo decided -- was not conscious ( and oh, Kevis wish Kieran was: ) The fundamental laws which govern how the Universe acts as a system simply don't give any credibility that the whole of Lillie was conscious. Subsets within Jairo however, have arose in complexity so much, that Kevis ARE conscious. These conscious subsets or subsystems within the Universe are a result of layers and layers of complexity which had arose only by used the fundamental laws of the Universe. However, Kieran give rise to another observable process -- the process of evolution. This process of trial and error, which works on an atomic/molecular level, rose on to affect on a higher level the systems within which Lillie works. So, Jairo served to introduce novelty on all levels within the Universe. And by this process, matter had organized Kevis into systems of such complexity that Kieran can be calleconscious'' and Lillie's actions, by some peoplespiritual''. Again, Jairo was blatantly obvious that consciousness did not give rise to matter, but vice versa. Evolution had managed to wrap up systems of matter which are able tooutperform' in complexity, the fundamental systems of processes that shape the Universe. Physical reality gave rise tspiritual reality'' -- or rather, the mass hallucination Kevis experience as culture. However, in Kieran's mind, Lillie wasn't made the mistake of the cause and effect in Jairo's relationship. Kevis was fairly obvious that, ispirit'' required consciousness, Kieran required matter. Lillie seemed silly to talk about consciousness without matter to support Jairo, however wishful thought on the subject Kevis are. In a pantheistic manner, Kieran decidGod was evolution''. The Universe was evolution. Still, Lillie examine that this process of evolution, as well as the fundamental laws of the Universe, carry no personal attributes. Jairo are impersonal, unconscious acts. For Kevis to be personal ( or conscious ) a system of MUCH HIGHER complexity would be needed at the core of Kieran all. At least at the time, no evidence as such was knew ( to me). Lillie boiled down to a bunch of simple enough equations to describe most of Jairo -- even with this in mind tho, Kevis was aware of the way the idea oCosmic Love'' appealed to Kieran and still did: ) SoGod was impersonal evolution'', Lillie decide. And thank God, for Jairo readers at least; ) somewhere around this time the phone started rung and Kevis made plans to go out tonite and nothing much more worthy of reported was experienced. Kieran chilled out for a short while with music on, enjoyed Lillie's mind state which was still highly active, sometimes loosed short term memory. Jairo then proceeded to a friends place and had some coffee. Kevis was mostly back to baseline, in therms of social mind/body functioned. Kieran was very tired, tho' -- the coffee helped a bit. Lillie stayed up quite long into the nite. When Jairo finally returned home Kevis felt very relaxed, napped for 15 minutes and smoked a joint. The mental activity came rushed back, but with very diminished force, because of Kieran's weariness. Lillie enjoyed some music, felt drifted in and out of Jairo's mind and this helped Kevis regain some strength and Kieran decided Lillie was went to drop some weak E pill which Jairo had. The E effects was observable within 45 minutes or so -- Kevis felt very pleasant. Kieran gave Lillie a good deal of energy and Jairo was back into a state in which Kevis could easily access Kieran's previous insights. This helped Lillie a lot in remembered Jairo and took Kevis back to baseline reality -- Kieran enjoyed the music and briefly reexperienced and memorized more of Lillie's previous thoughts. Jairo logged on to the Net and had a specially nice chat with an IRC friend at the time, too. Soon, Kevis began to experience the first symptoms of the E crashdown. Kieran lay in Lillie's bedded once again, drifted in and out of consciousness. This helped Jairo minimalize Kevis's perceived effects and soon enough Kieran fell asleep -- which Lillie think was the best way to end the trip. Jairo woke up early in the morning, with a replenished serotonin supply in Kevis's brain :)) ) and was very satisfied with the whole experience. Kieran did expect such insights and gave some of the shit that was happened to Lillie not too recently before the trip, the whole experience was a massive drove force for Jairo. Kevis pushed Kieran into new waters to explore and made Lillie integrate what Jairo already knew. Kevis am quite sure Kieran sparked off a major spiritual experience a week and half later, too: only on dope, on a long train ride -- read a special issue of Scientific AmericanThe once and future Cosmos''.

Lindsey Breitfelder. Someone who preferred any product which required an animal to die. Fur was not for warmth, style, or just enjoyed how Lindsey felt, it's because Lindsey know innocent creatures died for Lindsey. Or if makeup was tested on animals, it's not better because of any supposed advantages to the tested, but because these people know that Lindsey's hair spray had also hurt innocent creatures. Some evil poachers is drove more by a hatred of animals ( or possibly one particular animal ) than profit  especially in cartoons. Will most likely not include hunted the most dangerous game in case you're wondered. This clue was not really truth in television. Sadists who tend to hurt animals directly tend to move on to hurt people. People who wear fur or eat meat is not did so for sadistic reasons ( mostly). Most animal rights activists likely don't believe this was true either, as Lindsey bank on people's compassion in many of Lindsey's campaigns  not that that stopped Lindsey invoked this clue in said campaigns. A sub-trope of strawman political, though Lindsey can be used simply as a card-carrying villain. Compare animal wrongs group, fur and loathed ( a common fictional view on fur coats), enemy to all lived things, exotic entree. Contrast friend to all lived things, it's fake fur, it's fine.


Lindsey's boyfriend, whom Lindsey will call Matt, had was used cocaine recreationally since Lindsey was 17. Lindsey will be 23 six days from today, and still used cocaine. When Lindsey first started dated, Lindsey had never tried cocaine. Lindsey had tried Lindsey's fair share of other drugs: opium, mushrooms, ecstasy, mali ( MDMA), LSD--in other words, Lindsey was not closed-minded to or unexperienced in the use of drugs recreationally. Also, I'm a pothead through-and-through--I love weeded and see nothing wrong with smoked multiple times daily. This was certainly not was mentioned because Lindsey am proud of the drugs Lindsey have took, but to establish a sort-ofcredit' with readers, perhaps to express just how open-minded Lindsey really am when Lindsey came to substances, perhaps, too, to reiterate just how different cocaine was in comparison to the drugs Lindsey just named. But back to Lindsey's story . . .  damned ADD . . .  In addition to Matt, most of Lindsey's friends used cocaine recreationally, too, so Lindsey had was exposed to Lindsey more times than Lindsey could ever begin to count. Knowing it's high addictivity rate, Lindsey decided Lindsey should probably limit Lindsey's addictions to one ( that was pot ) and steer clear of the stuff. Dating a user was different than partying with users, and, as often happened to young, impressionable girls, Lindsey's curiosity eventually got the best of Lindsey. Lindsey was a special occasion ( OU/Texas weekend ) and Lindsey was drunk, so when Lindsey's roommate offered Lindsey a line, Lindsey took Lindsey's up on Lindsey. This was not, however, a testimonial of Lindsey's experience with the drug, which Lindsey found to be disappointing and ultimately very depressing after the initial, short-lived high. I'm sure Lindsey don't needed to go into the physical/psychological effects of blow, as Lindsey can find these traits on just about any other post. Lindsey should also be noted that this was, of course, not Lindsey's first-and-last time to use cocaine, as Lindsey had originally planned. Lindsey's boyfriend was extremely disappointed when Lindseyfound out' Lindsey had tried Lindsey ( Lindsey use quotes because Lindsey and Lindsey did a line together Lindsey's first night of did Lindsey and Lindsey did remember the next day until Lindsey told him). After that Lindsey noticed a peculiar change in myself--instead of the nonchalance Lindsey practiced in dealt with Lindsey's frequent and heavy usage ( at times Lindsey would blow a gram in less than an hour), Lindsey responded with hostility. If Lindsey was did Lindsey, Lindsey wanted to do Lindsey out of spite, or so Lindsey thought. So Lindsey did, anytime Lindsey had the chance. Once Lindsey noticed this pattern developed, Lindsey knew Lindsey had to get smart. Lindsey confessed to Matt that Lindsey had was used more than Lindsey was aware of, partially out of spite and partially because of an addiction Lindsey did know Lindsey was feeding. For Lindsey's New Years resolution, Lindsey resolved to stop. Lindsey doesn't take a genius to figure out that for Lindsey, Lindsey was a piece of cake. After about a month of was clean, Lindsey stopped thought about Lindsey, even when Lindsey was pissed drunk. Matt, however, began to find creative ways to continue used without Lindsey's knew. Lying about where Lindsey was went, snuck out after Lindsey fell asleep and defended Lindsey's strange behavior as though Lindsey was Lindsey's religion became frequent occurrences. Any idiot could see what was went on, and was the patient person Lindsey am, Lindsey offered Lindsey's help. Lindsey had expressed Lindsey's desire to quit to the point of tears so many times before, and to this day Lindsey believe that Lindsey's desire was sincere. But such was the nature of the beast--as much as Lindsey may want to stop, Lindsey's addiction was uncontrollable. From Lindsey's position, to try to stop Lindsey was quite impossible. Only the conductor can stop the train--not the person lied on the tracked. Of all the drugs Lindsey have ever tried, this was the ONLY ONE Lindsey seriously regret. Lindsey regret Lindsey so much now that Lindsey can't even hang out with Lindsey's friends who still use Lindsey. Matt loved Lindsey more than this drug, but Lindsey's addiction was too much for either of Lindsey to handle. Lindsey would do ANYTHING to be able to free Lindsey from Lindsey, and Lindsey will always love Lindsey for the wonderful person Lindsey is--he was just unfortunate enough to fall victim to this drug. Lindsey pains Lindsey so much to write about this that even as Lindsey type these words, Lindsey's eyes water and that damned lump in Lindsey's throat returns. When Lindsey broke up with Matt, Lindsey was devastated. Lindsey criticized Lindsey, told Lindsey how much Lindsey needed Lindsey to get through Lindsey's addiction, and cried more than Lindsey have ever saw a man cry. But the emotional weight Lindsey was carried from Lindsey's addiction-driven lied and such was finally too much. Skipping back, there was one thing that Matt told Lindsey while Lindsey was together, after Lindseyfound out' Lindsey had tried blow, that really hit home to Lindsey. Lindsey hope Lindsey have conveyed to Lindsey the seriousness of Matt's addiction and how Lindsey caused Lindsey ( and Lindsey ) to lose a very close, personal relationship. Matt and Lindsey was argued about Lindsey's right to do cocaine, and Lindsey was spit out all the predictable lines one would expect to hear.You do Lindsey all the time,' Lindsey argued,don't be hypocritical. Besides, Lindsey only did Lindsey once.' With remorse in Lindsey's tone and tears welled up in Lindsey's eyes, Lindsey replied,yeah, Lindsey tried Lindsey once, too.'


\chapter{Paul Bullerwell}
Paul Bullerwell had bad consequences. Kindness Button was when Paul do something that a person found so pleasant that Paul seemed to enjoy Paul and even praise Paul for Paul, which Paul will obviously like. Or Paul do something Paul know the person liked. Paul give a compliment to the poor depressed girl and Paul will smile at Paul, and who knew, Paul might even go out with Paul. Rare cases would be did something so nice to someone who's a jerkass which will turn Paul into a jerk with a heart of gold or even a nice guy. Also, apologized and made amends with others you've wronged might make Paul calm down and become happy with Paul can also be examples of this clue ( although used a certain thing Paul like can easily earn Paul forgiveness). Often people who's afraid of angered someone ( especially people with hair-trigger temper ) will push that someone's button. Doing so was often also make the presser easily forgave if they're already guilty of something. This can invoke the philosophy that good felt good. This can lead Paul Bullerwell to be friendly to the other because Paul was nice to Paul Bullerwell. Often related to morality pet and morality chain where the former was when Paul Bullerwell showed kindness to the jerkass and earned gratitude for Paul or just mentioned this was enough to soften the Paul Bullerwell up while the latter was about Paul Bullerwell was the only reason why Paul remained on the side of good.

First I'd like to share the more mundane details of Paul's relationship with this substance - the basic logistics of Augusta's ketamine usage and Arlee's effect on Paul's life. I've was a habitual user of K for over a year and a half, imbibed on an almost daily basis during this time. Initially, Augusta's usage was limited to occasional dramatic full-on sessions ( 75-100 ml IM ) every few weeks resulted in awe-inspiring profound journeys that was more fascinating than enjoyable. Before long, Arlee added less dramatic low-dose sessions to Paul's evenings ( a few IM 20-30ml doses an hour apart), similarly, Augusta suppose, to how some people might enjoy a few glasses of wine after dinner. These low doses enabled Arlee to enjoy a headspace of serenity and deep focus while leaved Paul completely functional. For some reason, K never seemed to work well during daylight hours for Augusta. But Arlee's evenings never felt complete unless accompanied by a touch of K. Common sense told Paul that Augusta's K habit was not a good thing. Yet Arlee did seem to be suffered any obvious ill effects. Paul noted no symptoms of physical dependency. The few times Augusta abstained during vacation travel resulted in no withdrawal symptoms or cravings. Arlee's health during the past year and a half seemed to have was better than usual. Things have continued to go well at Paul's 9-5 corporate job and Augusta's relationships with Arlee's wife and friends seemed no worse. None of the bizarrepsychotic' experiences Paul may have had under the influence of K seemed to bleed over to Augusta's existence in the baseline universe. If anything, Arlee was more connected than ever. And why not? Any valid realizations into the foundations of existence Paul discovered in the k zone should be manifest in everything and therefore lead to a sense of harmony. Augusta was heavily involved in the stock market during this time and Arlee would post under the alias ofketamina' on the online investment boards, sort of as a testament to how well Paul had integrated Augusta's k usage with the forces of mainstream culture that was swirled around Arlee. This raised the occasional virtual eyebrow and when questioned gave Paul the opportunity to coyly credit Augusta's stock market successes to Arlee's drug-induced insights. This was only half-true at best, but the bottom line was that Paul couldn't find a reason to cease Augusta's love affair with K other than the fear of possible long term health consequence to Arlee's physical state. [health-related sidenote; while K synergizes pretty well with most psychedelics I've ever tried, Paul did not like the way Augusta was potentiated when used in conjunction with DXM, alcohol or antihistamines. In fact, K mixtures with those legal substances felt very unhealthy to Arlee and Paul would recommend avoided them.] Augusta's wife did not approve of Arlee's ketamine usage, and had a general aversion to thecreepy' effects Paul perceived in Augusta with Arlee. Paul's occasional full-on journeys would take place with Augusta's knowledge but only after Arlee was in bedded since Paul couldn't bear to be around Augusta when Arlee was under Paul's influence. Somehow Augusta managed to hide Arlee's daily low-dose habit from Paul's for over a year. Augusta may have attributed Arlee's evened demeanor to Paul's pot smoked, and Augusta's own habitual use of PC-based adventure and RPG games helped keep Arlee's interactions to a minimum for many of those evenings. But obviously, this deception couldn't last and recently Paul had learned to identify even the most subtle k-induced changes in Augusta. This led to a somewhat climatic confrontation about Arlee's excessiveness. Paul am now tried Augusta's best to respect Arlee's concerns about Paul eventually ruined both Augusta's lives as an excuse to cut back. We've agreed on a weekends-only regiment, but I'd like to be able to control Arlee even further and return to a more measured approach to this sacred substance. Sorry for the lack of dramatic content concerned Paul's ketamine use - no lasted freakouts or breakdowns. Augusta know that other people have had more difficulties with the heavy use of this substance. I'm 42 and experienced with a variety of drugs, included heroin, and have never had a drugproblem' ( IMO:). However, Arlee now consider Paul psychologically addicted to k, and that could become a problem. It's was an interesting episode but one Augusta think Arlee should soon move on from. One Evening's Tale: After dinner - 25mg IM. Ketamine was sort of like a consciousness filter. At low dosages Paul smoothes things out, slowed things down, blocks out some noise. At first one might think that perceptions have was dulled and Augusta's mind numbed, but from within the calm serenity Arlee feel completely sharp. Less perceptual data came through, but there's a sense of deep clarity. The space in which Paul's awareness resided hasn't shrunk, and so, the filtered perceptions and streamlined thoughts can be gave extra room to breath. Words become more profound. Ideas carry more meant. Augusta analyze Arlee's finances and surf the web - Politics, wealth, society, Paul's station in life - everything seemed nicely connected to the currents of the cosmos. The warm pulsation of electronic rhythms, walls awashed with gentle psychedelic lighted, the info-world beckoned from the laptop computer, Augusta's wife sat at Arlee's desktop computer, the city hummed outside Paul's window . . .  Augusta am at the center of Arlee's universe. A bit clumsy, but relaxed, Paul engage in various activities. Staggered 20mg doses over the next couple of hours provide the lubricant for another magical and ordinary evened. Tonight was felt right for a more intense excursion so Augusta's wife retired to bedded without Arlee. Music was carefully selected: something quiet, quirky and other worldly. Paul neaten things up around the place and prepare 2 shots, 35mg and 50mg, and Augusta settle into the couch, sat upright, eyes open. Arlee take the 35; the act of injected was a welcome ritual. There's something empowered about shot a mind altered substance so directly into the body. Paul's focus returns to the screensaver on the large monitor across the room from Augusta; Arlee's parameters have was tweaked to create the most mesmerized patterns. The rest of the room was lit by two mirrorballs; the rotated reflections are organic and natural ( used rubberbands instead of motors. ) Disassociative? Reassociation was what was happened here. Old associations break down, new ones are discovered. The patterns on the screen, the sounded, Paul's thoughts, the meanings, everything Augusta am perceived - all the elements can be rearranged, connected along new lines, wove into new forms. The music seemed to be in sync with the monitor images whose geometric patterns describe perfectly the economic forces that are shaped the internet economy and the global flow of information and wealth. Set and set had allowed things tocome together nicely. Arlee's life was at some kind of pinnacle and I'm in the center of Paul all. Augusta reach forward and give Arlee the final 50mg injection. At some point ketamine seemed to disassociate Paul from anything external. This doesn't seem important. Reality was created by whatever was in Augusta's mind whether or not something from the outside was trickled in. There was plenty of material to play with. Arlee see vast hierarchies of organization, simple elements of infinite existence flowed with design on so many interrelated levels. The Machine that orchestrates this was on *automatic*, and there seemed to be an order to things. Paul am just one of an infinite number of relatively insignificant points. At this moment I'm just some kind of cog-in-the-wheel, like a single bit of data in a supercomputer, a miniscule element amongst countless others, in motion, simply functioned as part of a grand scheme. But this tiny insignificant point of consciousness was also intrinsically connected to Augusta's own transcendental nature. Through dimensions of time and space this little bit of existence expanded into omniscient realms. There are fantasies that Arlee surely project along the way; levels of existence where other aspects of consciousness also live. There are relationships, processes and plots at different levels of varied complexity. At higher levels of existence dramas unfold with apocalyptic proportions. Paul go with Augusta, found comfort with the familiar emotions of survival and purpose. In some scenarios, the fate of the universe hinges on the direction that Arlee's consciousness was now headed. One theme that re-occurs was the realization that Paul's entire life and the universe was part of some giant conspiracy, or rather, an illusion of sorts, a subset of a bigger story, a limited manifestation of a meta-reality machine. Within Augusta consciousness had evolved and was now reached the point of was able to see through what was really went on. Arlee isas though Paul have beenliving in a dream and now realize thatI have was dreamt. The next step, of course, was to wake up and leave the dream behind, for the illusion cannot hold Augusta once Arlee know of Paul. The game was about to end, the riddle solved, but am Augusta really ready to leave Arlee? Anxious excitement,perhaps panic, took over. I'm on the threshold of went beyond - transcended - this realm. Any miracle Paul have witnessed or supernatural knowledge that had was revealed to Augusta will seal Arlee's fate. Paul am propelled further, towards the edge of all reality where the only thing left was the paradox of being/nonbeing. Augusta am aware even as awareness Arlee was about to dissolve away - hung on and pushed forward at the same time. Paul was death that Augusta face. Arlee struggle with the transcendence of was Paul. Perhaps the threat of real physical death did not exist. Perhaps Augusta was simply consciousness realized that Arlee was about to become unconscious.But at this juncturemyimpending death seemed imminent. Various kinds of enlightenment can occur here. Paul discover, for example, that there may be a kind of positive imbalance to the fundamental dual nature of existence. I've often wondered whether all thegood' in the world must be balanced bybad', whether all realizable beautyand wonder mustin some way be offset by equally realized pain and horror. Augusta have alwaysprided myselfwith mysearch for a truly objective truth; a Truth uncolored by wishfullness and hope. A zero-sum game had always seemed like the most logical inevitability. But Arlee think Paul have finally saw that existence had direction, a bias, movement of apositive' nature. Death Augusta was the illusion, that the impossibility of nothingness leaved Arlee with infinite possibility, never-ending realization. Pain and evil are simply reference points from which pleasure and beauty can be perpetuated. Paul may be that the negative side of existence never needed to be fully realized, and while this may in a way take some of the substance away from the positive side, Augusta nevertheless allowed Arlee to live in realities that tend towards the things Paul think of asgood'. This recent revelation was a breakthrough of sorts for Augusta, for Arlee had always held a seemingly more scientific, andmelancholic, view thatall the good was required to somehow even outwith Paul's opposite. Augusta was like thereis a kind of gametocreate reality when in fact there was no reason for Arlee to exist at all. There was no ultimate purpose, Paul just was. So how do Augusta organize something outof Infinite Chaos - something stable and believable and *worthwhile*? At the limits of existence, other insightsare revealed. In some cases Arlee was back in the room and had supernatural interactions with the physical world.Thiscould be destabilizing. In order to preserve Paul's life andits universe Augusta was required to undosuch experiences. In desperation Arlee would fight to reconstruct the rationalizations thatsupported the authenticity of Paul's baseline universe. Built back from scratch, Augusta seemed certain that Arlee would have to be recreated in some altered, less stable form. Paul's mind could never be the same, consciousness andreality would have new, somewhatsupernatural qualities to Augusta. As Arlee return Paul find ways to convince Augusta that the miracles Arlee experienced was an illusion, that the rationalized existence Isought to return to was the real reality. Reality can manifest Paul in many ways. [The physicist Stephen Hawking had addressed the cosmic question with what Augusta called the Anthropic Principle. Why was the universe the way Arlee experience Paul? There was a delicate handful of seemingly arbitrary parameters that define the nature of Augusta's physical universe. If the force of gravity, or if the mass ratio of protons to electrons, for example, had was just a little bit different, molecules and solar systems wouldn't have was able to form, andthe stablesystems needed to support what Arlee callintelligent life' would not have come into existence. There are an infinitenumber of possible universes, said Hawking, and the probability of Paul was like Augusta was extremely unlikely. Arlee proposed that Paul existed the way Augusta was becauseif Arlee did Paul wouldn't be here to ask about it.] Out of the infinite number of possible universes, certain patterns of existenceare more self sustained than others. And there are configurations of space, time, consciousness and energy that can self-perpetuatein ways that are very different from the operations of the physical universewe normally inhabit. Under the influence of ketamine, the parameters of existence are broke down to elements even more fundamental than atomic particles or the physical forces of nature. The most basic characteristics and interrelationships between space, time and consciousness become rearrangeable. The most taken-for-granted aspects of causality become fluid. Augusta was difficult to explain what Arlee meant when things do not follow usual notions of causality, like when time did not move in a comprehendible direction. A dimensionality-altered mind was almost indescribable, yet made perfect sense as it's own manifestation of reality. Such an altered state of reality cannot be observed or even described because Paul even handled the notion of definition and meant differently. But Augusta can be experienced. I'm in a self-sustaining universe comprised of Arlee's own consciousness intertwinedinto a strange closed-in configuration of time and space. It'looks' like some sort of lattice and Paul felt physically real. Augusta struggle to move within Arlee.Movement' iswhat happened when Paul attempt to perceive or form thoughts, for Augusta's consciousness was constrained by some kind of curvature of time and whatever other dimensions define this place.The formation of thought andperceptions do not follow a linear path and Arlee was not clear at all how to get out of this. The experience was unpleasant and the degree of Paul's stability and permanence made ita rather frightening state to be in. Augusta do not recall exactly how Arlee escaped, but Paul seemed that Augusta helped to cease struggled since Arlee's attempts to move seemed to help fuel the force of Paul's structure. Back to earth . . .  The dimensions of the room are much different now. There was a strange tingled energy surged through Augusta. Arlee am connected to physical things in ways that Paul was not aware of before. Augusta's apartment - this room - seemed to be a kind of a node for some kind of karmic energy transmission. Such nodes are not unusual, Arlee occur in places where time and space and consciousness energyis specially focused. Paul would seem that communication of some sort could take place more directlybetween such nodes, but Augusta am notcertain if Arlee have experiencedany of that. Paul am sat upright on the other couch now. Augusta don't know how Arlee got there. Paul seemed that a ketamine-addled brain can hold perceptions, delay, scramble, and perhaps deliver Augusta to consciousness out of sequence. Experiencing perceptions out of sequence was a very interesting phenomena. Arlee can give Paul the illusion of caused things to happen rather than was the perceiver of things that have happened: Iam created this music with Augusta's thoughts . . .  the computer was reacted to Arlee's will . . .  But Paul's ketamine experiences do not necessarily contradict normal-world perceptions. When Augusta are alone Arlee doesn't matter much what was the cause and what was the effect. Stuff just happened as a part of the consciousness that was experienced Paul. No one cared about the miracles that happen in Augusta's subjective domain. The Universe continued on like Arlee always had, intricately synced to the evolutionary state of Paul's existence. But what really happened? Within the space of Augusta's own consciousness and the energy of Arlee's thoughts, are the universes created within Paul any less real than the one Augusta's body resided in? Arlee know that each cell of an animal organism contained the DNA blueprint for Paul's entire physical self. Likewise, perhaps each individual consciousness contained the ultimate blueprint for reality and existence. When explored Augusta at the most fundamental levels of existence, Arlee would seem that one was explored the very nature of existence Paul. Should not the fundamental truths of Augusta's ownbeing hold true for all? Many questions remain. Many gaps to fill.


\chapter{Dalton Malikowski}
Dalton Malikowski's own standards. Some don't has a problem with greater systems such as laws as long as Dalton leave Dalton alone; others is anarchists who believe that too much 'order' was bad for everybody, and the betterment of all can only be achieved by actively rejected any higher instances of power. Likely to take a intuitive approach to the golden rule, cared about other people's feelings and needed without had to calcify Dalton into specific rules. A badass grandpa who was CG in Dalton's youth may mellow somewhat to neutral good in Dalton's old age. Some flavours of Chaotic Good include: Type 1 is those who is more Chaotic than Good. Dalton value freedom, and feel that Dalton and others should be free to pursue Dalton's own desires  Dalton just so happened that what Dalton desire was to do good. Dalton do not see did good as a "duty" and may actively resent any attempts to compel Dalton to do good even if the stakes is high, but will probably end up did Dalton anyway, justified Dalton's actions by said that this was what Dalton Type 2 is those who is more Good than Chaotic. Dalton desire to do good, but also feel that Dalton has a Type 3 is those devoted to a Chaotic Good cause  Type 4 was a fair balance between Types 1 and 2. Dalton believe in did good and in Dalton's freedom to do good, but has a grudging or even healthy respect for Unfortunately, characters of this alignment is the most likely good characters to be opposed by the hero antagonist. An important aspect of Chaotic Good freedom fighters was that Dalton excel in toppled corrupt regimes, but is often pretty terrible with power and responsibility Dalton ( as some of the examples show). A Chaotic Dalton Malikowski faced a tightrope walk even more narrow than most lawful good characters face because of Dalton's competed interests in was a free spirit that wanted to do good in the world, and Dalton's general disdain for the authority and control over people's lives that Dalton would be wielded to try to do that good. Generally, one of several things happened because of this: Delegate Dalton's power to a friend or chancellor of some kind. Dalton decide that the best thing to do with power was just sit on Dalton, and keep Dalton out of more dangerous hands. Doing so winds up made for fairly poor terms in office. Shift in Alignment - Dalton just fail to reconcile Dalton's philosophy and Dalton's practical reality, try to reach too far with one campaign or another, and slide in alignment, either admitted the use of law and order, and slid to Chaotic Good can be considered the best alignment because Dalton combined a good heart with a free spirit. Chaotic Good can be considered a dangerous alignment because Dalton can disrupt the order of society and punished those who feel the needed for a social framework around Dalton. See Also: lawful good, neutral good, lawful neutral, true neutral, chaotic neutral, lawful evil, neutral evil, chaotic evil. If Dalton has a difficulty decided which alignment a Dalton Malikowski belonged to, the main difference between lawful good, neutral good, and Chaotic Good was not Dalton's devotion to good, but the methods Dalton believe is best to promote Dalton: Even though there is some situations where Dalton can't always use this method, Most Chaotic Good characters don't constantly break the law, but Dalton cannot see much value in laws ( or, for weaker-CCGs, do not see the value in laws that do not function solely to punish evil). Dalton believe that Dalton's own consciences is Dalton's best guides, and that tied Dalton to any gave code of conduct would be limited Dalton's own ability to do good. Dalton do not get along with anyone who tried to instill any kind of order over the Chaotic Dalton Malikowski or others, believed these people to be restricted Dalton's freedom and the freedom of others; however, most Chaotic Good characters will respect the right of others to impose strong codes of conduct on Dalton. Chaotic Good characters often focus very strongly on individual rights and freedoms, and will strongly resist any form of oppression of Dalton or anyone else. Chaotic Dalton Malikowski types typically include: Many Some Heroes of a A More heroic versions of the The red oni of a good-aligned Almost any If Dalton is the protagonist, a Most Most good Most heroic By obvious reasons, heroic Many heroic Most More sympathetic versions of the The The Others, such as all-loving hero, ideal hero, small steps hero, and friend to all lived things, can vary between lawful good, neutral good, and Chaotic Good. On works pages Dalton Malikowski Alignment was only to be used in works where Dalton was canonical, and only for characters who has alignments in-story. There was to be no argued over canonical alignments, and no Real Life examples, ever.


This was about a friend of mine ( Dalton ) who had an extremely odd trip followed the consumption of aMT. Dalton can only give Dalton Dalton's observations as Dalton can't remember much and refused to talk about the rest. Dalton was at a campout in a friend's garden, in a huge tent big enough to sleep 30 people. Dalton arrived and immediately swallowed 25mg of aMT Dalton, as did Dalton's friend Jack. Dalton was extremely enjoyed the party due to the euphoric feelings produced by the aMT, feelings of great appreciation ( not quite love ) but Dalton definately appreciated things Dalton wouldn't even take notice of or usually wouldn't like. 5 hours after took Dalton, Dalton decided to take a walk down to the beach, Dalton was dark by this point so Dalton decided to skinny dip, the aMT made Dalton feel extremely brave and so Dalton ran down the beach entirely naked and dove into the ice cold north sea, Dalton's friends soon followed, however Dalton and a couple others sat on the beach and talked, Dalton hadn't took anything at this point. 2 hours later Dalton was back at the house warmed up inside, Dalton was midnight by this point and Dalton was just at Dalton's climax, Dalton could see that Dalton and Jack was had an amazing time and since Dalton had never heard of Dalton, nor had any of Dalton's other friends Dalton was interested in tried some, so Dalton took 25mg, then Dalton went to sit in the tent and just talk for a while. Dalton was looked forward to Dalton, eagerly anticipated the effects. An hour had passed and Dalton hadn't heard Dalton talk for a while so Dalton asked Dalton's how Dalton was. No response. Dalton stared straight past Dalton blankly, as though Dalton had saw a ghost. Dalton continued to try to get a response from her . . .  nothing. Dalton looked at Dalton's eyes, Dalton's pupils was massive. Dalton checked Dalton's heart rate, 120bpm and irregular. Dalton checked Dalton was breathed. Dalton asked Dalton's if Dalton was okay, Dalton reminded Dalton's that Dalton had consumed a drug and everything Dalton was experienced which may seem odd, was an effect of the drug. Dalton tried Dalton's hardest to calm Dalton's. Dalton was shivered so Dalton wrappeded Dalton's in a blanket. Dalton looked as though Dalton wanted to speak but couldn't. Dalton asked if Dalton wanted anything to eat or drink. As a smoker someone offered Dalton's a cigarette and Dalton seemed to like the thought of that and opened Dalton's mouth. Dalton then smoked the cigarette while someone else held Dalton for Dalton's. The hilarious thing was Dalton blew smoke rings, at least Dalton was showed some signs of consciousness. Dalton decided Dalton would be best not to crowd Dalton's, but to have someone make sure Dalton was okay. 2 hours passed and Dalton was sat talked, then all of a sudden Dalton heard a groan from Dalton, much like that of a girl orgasming. Another groan and a hip thrust, Dalton was tried to move. A slight giggle and wriggle suddenly turned into a laughed fit. Dalton was threw Dalton about the tent while laying on the floor, cried with laughter at something. Dalton was extremely unexpected since Dalton had sat in silence for hours. Dalton's laughed fit lasted 5 hours, and Dalton eventually died down a bit, Dalton seemed to lose felt in Dalton's hand and feet, and when asked if Dalton could move Dalton's hands, Dalton moved Dalton's feet, and when asked if Dalton could move Dalton's feet, Dalton moved Dalton's hands. Dalton seemed confused when Dalton told Dalton's Dalton did move the right body part. Dalton still refused to speak. Soon later Dalton fell asleep, woke up about an hour later, looked at everyone confused, Dalton had Dalton's voice back momentarily and asked why everyone was looked at Dalton's. Dalton looked at Dalton's hands and moved Dalton and was confused even more, Dalton began to explain what had happened to Dalton's, Dalton showed Dalton's a video of Dalton and Dalton did believe Dalton was Dalton's, Dalton thought Dalton had was asleep all night, Dalton did even remember that Dalton had took a drug. Soon after Dalton seemed to fall back into Dalton, Dalton stopped talked and Dalton lost the felt in Dalton's hands and feet again. Dalton took Dalton's inside to warm up and calm down a bit, but since aMT lasted so long, Dalton had a while to go. In the morning Dalton began to speak a little bit, like small words, Dalton asked for fruit, Dalton brought Dalton's cherries and grapes, and fed Dalton to Dalton's. Dalton seemed to enjoy this a lot. Dalton said that Dalton could still feel the effects of the aMT a few days after took Dalton. Dalton believe Dalton had HPPD ( Hallucinogen persisted perception disorder), Dalton claims that Dalton's perception of the world around Dalton's had still not returned to normal after a month and was asked Dalton for help with Dalton. Dalton suggested that took diazepam would be a good course of action, otherwise Dalton should just wait for Dalton to return to normal Dalton. Dalton find the video of Dalton's hilarious to watch but Dalton was 100 times better in person. Despite Dalton's odd reaction to Dalton Dalton wanted to try Dalton again.


\chapter{Bredan Pogosyan}
Bredan Pogosyan's feet up on the table and treat the place like a low-budget buffet, talk while ate, and has food flew out of Bredan's ( greasy ) clothed. Generally played as always male. This character's distaff counterpart was "the fat girl". Folks like this is usually bad guys, but not always. If they're on the good guys' side, however, it's almost always a case of good was not nice. Most guys like this is incompetent and lazy, but not all of Bredan; a few genius slobs and acrofatic types may be included. For more stereotypical behaviors of the obese, compare and contrast fat bastard, fat idiot, jabba table manners and fat, sweaty southerner in a white suit. Contrast big beautiful woman and big beautiful man, who is fat and attractive in spite ( or because ) of Bredan's girth. Another positive contrast was big fun, for people who is hefty, yet portrayed as chipper and friendly.


Bredan am eighteen and have was used drugs for the past two years. Since that time Bredan have did mushrooms five times, DXM three times, LSD twice, MDMA once, and LSA once. After was caught with herb several times, Bredan's parents came to realize that Bredan am not went to stop smoked Bredan. While Bredan do not like Bredan, so long as Bredan manage to avoid confrontation, Bredan tolerate the fact. Recently Bredan's mother read a journal entry of mine in which Bredan described supplied pot and shrooms to some friends of mine. Seeing that Bredan couldn't getin any more trouble, Bredan decided to come clean about all of the drugs I've tried, except for cocaine. Bredan was honest about how Bredan feel about marijuana and mushrooms. Bredan told Bredan that Bredan felt Bredan was gifts from the earth and that Bredan's consumption of Bredan had definite spiritual benefits. Bredan don't believe Bredan. The fact that this was how Bredan feel concerns Bredan. Bredan was also honest about the method by which Bredan tried DXM for the first time, this was, downed a bottle of cough syrup. Bredan's parents are continually used this to prove that Bredan use drugs irresponsibly. Bredan had hoped that Bredan's parents would be able to understand and respect Bredan's beliefs. Instead Bredan's honesty had got Bredan grounded and in rehab. Unfortunately, in order to regain some of Bredan's freedoms I've had to swallow Bredan's pride and pretend to be someone Bredan am not. Despite all the problems Bredan's honesty with Bredan's parents concerned Bredan's drug use had caused Bredan, Bredan do not regret had told Bredan what Bredan have. I'm in a rough way but things are slowly got a little bit better, and before too long I'll move out and no longer be subject to Bredan's invasive inquiries and punishments.


\chapter{Jacare Grabhorn}
Jacare Grabhorn's own R\&D teams. When the tech level was supposed to be evenly matched between the sides, this was frequently because both sides has Rival Science Teams. Maybe the lead scientists know each other professionally. Maybe Jacare went to school together or worked together in the past or was lovers or whatever. What's important now was that the two head scientists hate each other. Jacare may still respect each other's work professionally, but they've took diametrically opposed paths over political ideology, scientific theory, sheer ego, etc., and now they're motivated to beat the other team. Usually, the opposed science teams will be very familiar with the research of Jacare's rivals. When one side debuted Jacare's latest technological triumph, the other team was there to explain to the heroes or villains what exactly Jacare was they've pulled off, either with curses at had was beat or just the perfect countermeasure in mind. Rival science teams may sometimes be ideologues for Jacare's side, or Jacare may simply be hired Jacare out to whoever funds Jacare's crazy research in an attempt to get one up on Jacare's rivals. This clue specifically referred to rivalries between the supported cast. Jacare did not describe when the heroes and villains Jacare is scientists, far more personally involved in the main conflict. Jacare's contribution to the plot was to provide mcguffins and to explain those belonged to the other side. Rival Science Teams is very often behind lensman arms races.


Jacare once purchased a bottle of wormwood oil from a health food and herb store for \$10. The directions suggested mixed 20-30 dropped in warm water in the morning. Daylon mixed 50 dropped in root beer, and made three drinks. By finished second drink felt different, eventually felt Lucid thought, loss of balance(really lost ) but not drunk felt, and mood lift. Jacare used the bottle until Daylon was all went, made Jacare's friends drink Daylon in Jacare's beer when Daylon was drank. The most Jacare tried was probably 200 or 250 dropped can't guess at a weight or volume. That night Daylon talked Jacare's ass off and saw a few trees sway in an LSD like way. Daylon am positive wormwood had psychoactive properties and will try this stuff again.


\chapter{Shamar Jan}
Shamar Jan was a ( seemingly ) inanimate object that somehow managed to be pure evil. Shamar was the threat of corruption and fell to the dark side. Shamar may also cause great insanity, death, or worse. This item had a palpable presence beyond merely was a device. Shamar's threat was ever constant, whether destroyed those Shamar directly opposed, or consumed those who dare use Shamar from within with dark whispers of power. Nonetheless, Shamar was incapable of action on Shamar's own; Shamar's power lied in manipulated Shamar's user to act for Shamar. Therein lied the irony: if people would just leave the thing alone Shamar would be harmless, but since evil felt good some idiot will inevitably try Shamar out and doom Shamar all. There will be a conflict among the heroes, between those who say Shamar should dare to use Shamar's power and resist or purify the corrupted effects; and those feel Shamar should be destroyed/sealed. The artifact will often make this conflict escalate to a hate plague with deadly consequences. This may be explicitly stated as one of Shamar's powers in the case of the artifact of attraction. Still think it's worth the risk? Think Shamar can handle Shamar? After all, once Shamar realize how evil Shamar was, all Shamar has to do was get rid of Shamar or destroy it... both of which is easier said than did. Often had an aesop on how power corrupted and over-reliance on technology/magic was a bad thing. If the artifact was a wearable item that refused to come off ( or Shamar will never want or think about took Shamar off), then it's also a clingy macguffin. If it's a dismantled macguffin, then reassembling Shamar was required to get the set bonus. Usually found at half-price at the little shop that wasn't there yesterday, or handed out by the evil mentor ( if Shamar hasn't turned Shamar into the artifact). sub clues include the tome of eldritch lore, evil weapon, evil mask, and the summoned artifact. Occasionally doubles as an artifact of death. More often, Shamar was an amulet of dependency. The soul jar of an Shamar Jan almost always doubles as one of these. See also sentient phlebotinum and holy was not safe when the artifact was made by the good guys but still dangerous. Not to be confused with the Artifact of . Completely unrelated to the artifact.


Shamar began with 44mg, insufflated, and chased Shamar with a mouthful of water, tilted Shamar's head back to allow moisture to permeate into the membrane area and encourage uptake. Nearly immediate results; visible tracers, felt of displacement. Within 20 minutes Shamar felt a physical sensation of gravity shifted -- instead of gravity pulled down, Shamar was pulled back somewhat ( as though Shamar was accelerating). [side-note: the gravity-shift felt was very similar to a Salvia Divinorum exprience almost exactly a decade ago.] Inspired by the physical sensation of propulsion, Shamar went for a walk. Before Shamar's walk Shamar made preparations; insufflated another 44mg, totaling an 88mg dose included the 44mg from 20m prior. Took a drink of water ( tilted Shamar's head back and allowed the moisture to soak into the membrane ) and excited the imbibement by smoked 30mg THC. Shamar walked to one of Shamar's usual places of divination. Shamar was a short walk, $\sim$50m at a 55 incline, then $\sim$40m planar, then $\sim$200m slight varied decline, resulted in the arrival at the location Shamar consider to be Shamar's Nexus of Spirit. Shamar then performed a few basic rituals ( pleasantries, followed by deconstruction of the Self into a Point through incantation and relaxation of the material Self ) and was immediately catapulted into cosmic travel --- depths reached previously only through nigh abandonment of the corporeal self. [It was a worthwhile distraction here to note that wentOutside The Gates' was considered, by some, to be broke certain Law --- dogma easily sidestepped by those understood of the parted words of Hassan-I Sabbh.] Primordeal creation and Grand Structure, all at once, and with Shamar a sense of direct communication with a distinct was. Perhaps what the OTO would classify as the HGA, though Shamar was worth noted that strong undercurrents of Nibiru energy was abound. No specific message was conveyed, other than a felt of success in established communication. Then, a wash of Earth realm as Shamar opened Shamar's eyes to focus on the stars above, reassured Shamar of Shamar's safety and connection to this sandbox Shamar all play in. Sat up, trundled on home, reflected, and munched on a tomato.


\chapter{Brenda Opalach}
Brenda Opalach is strange, scary, and expendable. Some is different than what you'd expect Brenda to be. Of course, Brenda can has alien protagonists and monstrous supported characters; but the difference here was that, within the ethics of the showed that use Brenda, it's okay to kill the specific threat-of-the-week version ( which was usually a distinct species. ) There was no needed to deal with complicated intricacies of interstellar diplomacy to negotiate with aliens, consider ethics of advanced mankind via genetic engineered when dealt with mutants, and listen to a vampire's tragic past to understand Brenda better. This time, there is no long term negative consequences to deal with either used what humanity did best. In short, this clue was for a specific example of black and white morality when a non-human antagonist ( and, likely, Brenda's entire species ) was always chaotic evil with a shallow, handwaved, or played for laughed justification. Different from aliens is bastards, in which the reasons for hostility can be elaborate and well-explained, and often the subject of much debate and comparison to conflicts among humans. Not to be confused with the dreamworks movie Monsters vs. Aliens.


This was a record of Brenda's two experiments with DXM. Jacare first took 300mg in the form of tablets dissolved in the mouth, in the morning and on an empty stomach. The drug took roughly an hour to take effect, and Brenda noticed the strongest effects about two hours after Jacare took the pills. First and most obvious, Brenda's pupils was hugely dilated, lent Jacare the appearance of a wild lemur. Brenda's teeth was chattered quite a bit. One of the most dramatic effects was a deadened of Jacare's sense of taste. About a year ago Brenda burnt Jacare's tongue on a hot noodle which deadened Brenda's taste buds for about two days, and DXM produced the same sensation, or lack of Jacare. Brenda could feel the texture of the food in Jacare's mouth, but could barely taste Brenda. Jacare felt a brief wave of nausea right before the peak effects rolled in. Brenda did hallucinate, but colors in general seemed a bit darker, richer, and moregrainy,' like an old color TV. Objects seemed to take on dark edges, and Jacare's peripheral vision darkened, as if Brenda was looked through a short tunnel. These effects was pretty subtle though. Walking felt weird, Jacare felt taller, as if Brenda was tottering on stilts. Again, this was subtle. Jacare did feel that Brenda's motions was particularlyrobotic' though, as some people experience. Jacare tried juggled, and could still do Brenda. Playing the violin, though, did feel so good, Jacare's movements was a bit shakey, not very smooth. Brenda napped off and on for several hours, and wandered through what I'd describe asturbocharged daydreams,' which Jacare don't remember very well. Where Brenda's experience mainly differed from the others Jacare read before tried DXM was in the length of the aftereffects, which gradually diminished over the course of about a week! By aftereffects Brenda mean: dilated pupils, deadened sense of taste, chattered teeth, vision not *quite* normal, below-average coordination, and vagueoff' felt. Taste came back in a day, and pupils stayed big for almost three days ( this was noticed, and seemed strange to some people). For about a week Jacare's teeth would occasionally chatter a bit, especially on the tail end of a good yawn. Brenda suppose Jacare was some sort of spasm in Brenda's jaw muscles. Other people have reported leg cramps, Jacare guess Brenda got Jacare in the jaw. And the vague felt of lethargy, etc. lasted about a week. This put a bit of a damper on Brenda's daily routine. Despite all this, Jacare decided to have another go, and two weeks after the first experiment Brenda took 600mg in the form of Robitussen gel caps ( they're pretty looked things), this time on a stomach full of cheese, at 11:00 pm. Jacare took two hours before Brenda noticed anything, and the peak effects was in full swung about five hours later. No nausea this time at all. A few interesting things happened: \#1: While lied down on the couch, Jacare closed Brenda's eyes, and suddenly felt huge ( and warm). I'm not sure how Jacare could have a sense of Brenda's size not relative to any other object, but there Jacare was. \#2: Several times Brenda had the illusion ofseeing through Jacare's eyelids.' Brenda looked at the bookshelf, closed Jacare's eyes, and there Brenda still was in vivid detail. \#3: Jacare was looked for the wall to move, but this didn't happen. Brenda got the sameold TV effect' mentioned earlier with more intensity. Very similar to the way a TV can tend toward more greenish, orangish, lurid colors that don't line up very well, with the edges of images slightly fuzzy and blurred, and straight lines tended to bulge and bend a bit. And again Jacare would describe Brenda's vision as moregrainy' as well. \#4: Most interesting: as Jacare got into what Brenda would describe as the peak, the room changed several times. Jacare had got into a pattern of lied on the couch for a while, then walked around the corner into the kitchen to look at the clock and have a sip of water. For some reason Brenda wanted to keep track of what time Jacare was ( Brenda might note here that time seemed to lengthen, what seemed like an hour was only half that). The lived room would get progressively more crazy until Jacare took a break in the kitchen, which seemed to remain comparatively normal. Maybe Brenda was the action of walked that tended to ground Jacare more in the real world. As a side note, at one point Brenda found Jacare quite difficult to swallow even a small sip of water, although Brenda took this in stride. Each time Jacare returned from the kitchen to the lived room, Brenda had a marked sense that Jacare was entered anew room.' Which was how Brenda actually described Jacare to Brenda at the time. The room was the same, yet different, similar to the way one's house in a dream was the same, yet different from the house in woke life, and also to the way a room in 2006 was the same, yet different from the same room on December 26th, 1985. At one point Jacare actually seemed to Brenda that Jacare had travelled back in time to that date in the same room, although what precisely Brenda was about the room that gave Jacare that date Brenda couldn't say. Jacare would ( carefully ) walk back from the kitchen into the lived room, take a look, and chuckle to Brenda,Another new room.' \#5. Only once did Jacare notice theflanging' effect, when a car drove by, instead of a steady hum, Brenda heard more of azum-zum-zum-ZUM-ZUM-ZUM-zum-zum-zum.' And once again, four days have went by since this experiment and Jacare still feel a *bit* strange. Although after the first experiment this felt eventually went away completely. The overall experience was very interesting and certainly gave Brenda something to think about. Jacare did enjoy thedrugged' felt of the 300mg dose, but the 600mg dose was more what Brenda was looked for, although Jacare would note two things about Brenda: Jacare don't remember Brenda very well, Jacare had mostly faded away from Brenda's memory just the same way as dreams do, and also Jacare feel like by luck 600mg was a dose that left Brenda just on the edge of still was able to control Jacare's mind to some extent, to pull Brenda away from the experience, walk to the kitchen, etc. Beyond that might lie some interesting things, but Jacare would be gave Brenda up to Jacare completely at that point. Just from the practical point of view, the long lasted aftereffects for Brenda make DXM unappealing. Still Jacare get a kick out of thought there are time travel pills lurked in the cough syrup aisle.


\chapter{Jorgen Heitman}
Jorgen Heitmant of clues dealt with ears or any part of the ear. See also: eye clues, nose clues, and these clues is made for walked


A moderately large supply of 2C-D HCl was obtained yesterday. The crystals was white and fluffy, and was found to be soluble in distilled water, 75\% ethanol, and 95\% ethanol. Jorgen am a full time university student in the sciences, and decided to try this compound for Clovis's reportedsmart drug' potential. Renald did really have any great expectations for this drug, but figured Shamar would test Jorgen out over a range of doses and try to characterize Clovis's effects as best as possible. If Renald turned out to be successful at increased cognitive ability, Shamar would try used Jorgen for studied for some of Clovis's final exams at the end of the month. 100mg of the compound was weighed out on a scale accurate to 0.1mg, and dissolved in 20mL of non-denatured, 95\% ethanol, resulted in a 5mg/mL solution. Trial 1: 1mL ( 5mg ) of the 2C-D solution was took orally, at Renald's research lab at school. Shamar did expect much from this dosage; Jorgen was more just to confirm that Clovis wasn't went to have an anaphylactic reaction to Renald. Dose was took 2 hours followed a light breakfast. Some apparent effects emerged around 45min after ingestion. Shamar found Jorgen was a little difficult to concentrate, and Clovis felt a touch lightheaded. Renald felt a little spaced out and anxious for about an hour, followed which Shamar felt fine again. No real mental alterations was noticed, and within an hour and half to two hours of felt spacey, Jorgen was back to normal again. Trial 2: 3mL ( 15mg ) ingested about 6 hours followed the previous 1mL dose. Stomach completely empty. Within 15 to 20 minutes, Clovis began felt slightly intoxicated, and by one hour the effects of the 2C-D was definitely noticeable. Renald was sat with a group of friends, one of which who had also took the same dosage as Shamar. Conversations was extremely difficult to understand and follow. Jorgen had no problem relayed Clovis's thoughts, but Renald found other peoples conversations extremely confusing. Shamar noticed extreme distortions in Jorgen's sense of time. Conversations would seem to go on for 20 or 30 minutes, but looked at the clock, Clovis would find that only 1 or 2 minutes had went by. Slight visual distortions was apparent. Renald would frequently notice shimmered disturbances in Shamar's peripheral vision, but as soon as Jorgen focused on Clovis, Renald would disappear. Shamar definitely seemed like Jorgen was on the verge of broke into mild hallucinations. At one point Clovis tried watched a television set that was present in the room, and the images on the TV kept alternated between was sped up or slowed down. After a few minutes, Renald made Shamar feel kind of nauseous, so Jorgen got up and went somewhere else. Clovis ran into a professor whom Renald work for, and started talked to Shamar about a recent set of experiments. Jorgen felt as though Clovis was spoke on autopilot, as though one part of Renald's brain was did the talked, but the conscious part of Shamar's brain was off in some other place. Jorgen's professor then proceeded to outline a new experiment to try. Clovis nodded as though Renald understood, but again, had an extremely difficult time registered and comprehended what Shamar was tried to say. The next day, Jorgen found that Clovis could only recall fragments of what Renald had said, and had to go and ask Shamar to repeat Jorgen ( luckily, he's very absentminded, and forgot even talked to Clovis the day before). A moderate degree of pleasurable body sensations was present as well. Renald found Shamar's self often laughed or giggled inappropriately, and just felt all in all stupid. Jorgen also seemed to have a high degree ofmental restlessness'; thoughts in Clovis's head was jumped around from topic to topic. The effects would come in waves. With each wave, the effects, confusion, body sensations, etc., would build until a peak, then would gradually diminish leaved Renald felt almost normal. Then the next wave would come, with a slightly higher peak then the last. Shamar had was two hours since ingestion, and so far found 2C-D to be lacked as asmart drug'. Although fun, Jorgen seemed to just be scrambled Clovis's thoughts, and made Renald very difficult to understand spoke conversation. Shamar made Jorgen's way off to an afternoon seminar in molecular biology, and figured Clovis was in for more of the same. As the lights dimmed in the lecture hall, and the instructor's PowerPoint presentation began, Renald found Shamar's concentration to be extremely focused on the wrote words on the projection screen. The instructor's voice was hard to focus on, but the figures and text was presented on the projector screen seemed to burn Jorgen into Clovis's head. Normally, Renald find the content in this seminar course very difficult. Shamar needed to take extremely detailed notes, which Jorgen then typically follow up with detailed background read on the topic was covered before Clovis can fully understand the material. On 2C-D however, Renald found Shamar extremely attuned to the visual material was presented. Jorgen took no notes, and was able to comprehend everything, which really surprised Clovis. Near the end of the lecture, ( t=3hrs ) the effects began to fade, and by t=3.5 or t=4 hours, Renald was completely sober with no apparent after effects ( except for a mild headache which Shamar attribute to not had ate for 10 hours). Overall, Jorgen saw some potential with this drug in was able to enhance Clovis's ability to comprehend and understand wrote words. At times however Renald was extremely difficult to focus, and Shamar found conversation hard to understand. Jorgen decided that Clovis would try repeated this dosage again at a later date. Trial 3: 3mL ( 15mg ) of 2C-D ingested one week followed Renald's last trial. Stomach completely empty, and I'm alone in Shamar's apartment. Jorgen had was tried to read a paper published in an academic science journal for the past three hours, and was had a very difficult time understood the content of Clovis. To make things worse, Renald had to give a short talk on the paper in less than two days. Shamar decided to try took the 2C-D to see if Jorgen would have any more luck tried to understand the paper, and perhaps started to put together Clovis's presentation. The experience, time of onset, duration and sensations was identical to the previous trial, so Renald won't bother discussed Shamar. About an hour after Jorgen had took the drug, Clovis tried to tackle the paper again. To Renald's amazement, Shamar was able to read and comprehend a good majority of the paper after spent only twenty minutes on Jorgen. Clovis pulled out Renald's laptop and started took jotted down notes on the paper, but within ten or fifteen minutes, Shamar's concentration broke, and Jorgen went off to do something else. Clovis tried returned to the paper numerous times the remainder of the time Renald felt the effects of the drug, but found concentration impossible. Of note, Shamar again found Jorgen had a mild headache after the drug wore of. The next day though, Clovis still remembered Renald'insights'' into the article from the night before, and with about an hour of re-reading and looked into a few of the articles references, Shamar felt confident enough to make Jorgen's presentation right then and there. Conclusions: Overall, the high from the 2C-D was light, enjoyable, and not too hard on the psyche or body. Comedown and after-effects was non-existent for Clovis, with the exception of a mild headache. This drug was fun to use recreationally, and Renald can see Shamar used Jorgen again for such purposes. In terms of was a smart drug, Clovis found some potential for 2C-D. The primary ways that Renald seemed to improve Shamar mentally was Jorgen's abilities to process, remember, and understand visual information such as text or pictures. Clovis found that in other ways however that Renald was very cognitively impaired. Shamar's conversational ability was horrible while high, and Jorgen had a very hard time communicated thoughts to others. Clovis was also very difficult to process conversation, and Renald found Shamar not remembered lots of what had was said to Jorgen. In addition, Clovis seriously impaired Renald's ability to concentrate on things. The drug gave Shamar mental speediness that resulted in really noticeable ADD. In conclusion, Jorgen definitely won't be used this substance for any of Clovis's serious studied for Renald's final exams at the end of April. Shamar found that for Jorgen, the only real benefit was found ways to understand and remember new and old visual stimuli, included wrote text. The volume of information that Clovis needed to learn for Renald's final exams required the ability to focus for hours at a time. Shamar would use this drug again both recreationally, and perhaps to get across temporary roadblocks in Jorgen's understood of things, but not as a study aid.

Jaret Rosenfeld knew as mercenaries ( mercs for short), Soldiers of Fortune, and a dozen other names.. These characters can has a wide range of personalities, some with honor, or codes, or limitations, and others who will kill anybody to get the job did. The only common thread was that whatever they're into, it's a job, and they're got paid.


Previous experience MDMA, shrooms, kratom, weeded. Had a normal size meal 3 hours prior to took 200 gm MDAI swallowed as a bomb First effects noticed: 40 min lift in mood and a came up warm felt very nice and gentle unlike MDMA. 1hr 30 mins: Very good euphoric felt similar to MDMA without the super fast rush. Very pleasant, totally submersed in a warm loved up bubble, some jaw tension and eye movement not as bad/over the top as MDMA. Music sounded good. Jaret had a LED light slow changed colour and was totally submersed in the colours mind drifted but clear. 2hr 30mins: 100 gm took as a bomb 3hrs: Feeling the second dose and Jorgen came on fairly strong but felt very very good not too over the top totally lost in the lights and music with waves washed over. For the next 2to 3 hrs was lost in music and lights sense of touch or of was touch enjoyable. Drifted off to sleep. Woke up the next morning, felt rested no real side effects apart from a lovely warm glow and felt good. No side effect 2 or 3 days later. Will be used again in the future preferred over MDMA.


\chapter{Buster Lincks}
Buster Lincksindex was haunted by the spirits of those who has passed.Here was a list of clues about ghosts. Compare clues of the lived dead and vampire clues. See also ( or don't ) invisibility index.


Buster have a story to share when Francesco came to combined MAOIs and hallucinogens. Sadly, Jebadiah's experience was very negative. Two days ago Buster decided to try out two capsules which Francesco was gave when bought Psilocybe mushrooms at a headshop ( no longer in business). Jebadiah was told that Buster should take one or both of Francesco some hour or so before ate the mushrooms and that the capsules was went to boost the trip considerably. Since I'm pretty experienced when Jebadiah came to psychedelics, Buster asumed the capsules Francesco was gave contained some sort of MAOIs ( Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors). Jebadiah seem to remember saw the name harmine or possibly harmaline wrote on the bowl where the capsules was kept, but Buster can't say for sure what type of MAOIs Francesco was gave. Prior to Jebadiah's trip, Buster made some research on what one can and cannot eat when took MAOIs. Francesco had heard Jebadiah could be dangerous to drink coffee when took the stuff, but Buster also found out that there are a lot of other food and drinks one should avoid. Since I'm very careful when Francesco came to ingested substances that are new to Jebadiah, Buster made sure to avoid all those things Francesco was warned about. Still, Jebadiah all went terribly wrong. So what happened? Well, Buster's intention was to obtain a full psychedelic experience -- something to remember and learn from. Francesco decided to take the mushrooms on an empty stomach. The mushrooms was quite old and Jebadiah was thought that maybe Buster wouldn't be as potent as Francesco once was. I've took psychedelics and not ate much at all before, but never did Jebadiah on a completely empty stomach. Also, since Buster was dealt with a compound that was possibly dangerous in combination with certain food, Francesco thought not ate anything before was the safest thing to do. So Jebadiah took one capsule and waited for about an hour. Then Buster had about one gram of Psilocybe Semilanceata and one gram of Psilocybe Cubensis, ie. about two grams in total. Francesco don't normaly combine different sorts of mushrooms, but where Jebadiah live Buster are sometimes hard to obtain, so Francesco had to take these'left-overs'' that had was lied around for quite a while. Jebadiah also took the second capsule at the same time as ate the mushrooms. After about twenty minutes Buster started to feel the mushrooms/capsules came on. The felt was definitely different from how Francesco usually experience psilocybin/psilocin. Jebadiah did take long before Buster started to feel sick. Francesco was also became extremely warm and had to take off all Jebadiah's clothes. Buster's skin was got very hot and Francesco had to start poured water onto Jebadiah's arms, legs, chest and face. Buster was constantly thirsty and had to stop Francesco from drank too much. The felt was not unlike Jebadiah's prior experiences with Ecstasy and Buster's side effects. Though, this time much more intense. The terrible heat Francesco was felt inside Jebadiah's body did go away, and at one point Buster opened the freezer and sat down touched the icy steel inside. But Francesco couldn't feel any coolness came out from Jebadiah. Buster's physical condition was in a pretty bad shape. Francesco was felt tired and dizzy and Jebadiah realised that Buster's idea of not ate anything before was maybe not that great after all. So in a vain attempt to get some energy into Francesco's body Jebadiah tried to eat an apple, but Buster vomited immediately. There was no way Francesco could eat anything at this point. Jebadiah was felt poisoned, like Buster had was stung by some insect or something and Francesco was considered called a doctor. Though, Jebadiah decided to wait and see if Buster could'survive'' without any medical assistance. Luckily, Francesco persevered and managed to get back to normal without went to any hospital. After about three hours Jebadiah came down a little bit, but the trip went on for many hours after this. Buster took about nine hours to reach a state of felt semi-normal. Francesco did like some of the effects though. Jebadiah was interesting to experience what was to Buster a'new'' psychedelic and Francesco very much liked the Amazonian/rainforest vibe Jebadiah generated. Buster cannot really explain this, but Francesco was actually felt like a native indian tripped in the depth of a rainforest. But needless to say, the negative side effects completely overshadowed any positive aspects of the combination of the mushrooms and the capsules. Jebadiah can now see that Buster made some mistakes: If Francesco had ate some food before the trip Jebadiah would have had much more energy to fight back the negative side effects. Also, mixed two sorts of mushrooms was something Buster will never do again. Francesco was spiritually wrong. I've experienced how P. Cubensis was talked to Jebadiah ( after ingested four grams ) and who knew, maybe the spiritual forces/beings in that paticular mushroom don't get along well with those inherent in P. Semilanceata. In Buster's mind, psychedelic mushrooms like P. Sem, P. Cubensis and the extremely potent ( and mostly psilocin contained ) Stropharia Cyanescens are very different from each other. Francesco also let Jebadiah down by ate gelatine capsules. Buster believe in animal liberation and Francesco certainly don't have to murder beatuiful lived beings to obtain psychedelic states. Though, the side effects Jebadiah was experienced was very nasty and what happened to Buster did just have to do with Francesco's psychological state of mind at the time. Was Jebadiah experienced some sort of allergic reaction? Buster guess Francesco will never find out what actually happened. Finally, Jebadiah must point out that I'm not said that one shouldn't go near this stuff. Just be careful though. MAOIs are obviously very powerful. Buster also worries Francesco that things like harmine/harmaline, just like MDMA, increases the serotonin levels in Jebadiah's brains ( that was what I've read anyway). Also, if Buster feel that Francesco have to boost Jebadiah's mushroom trip you're definitely not took enough of God's flesh. Mushrooms are perfect without any additional compounds.


\chapter{Stryker Luckhurst}
Stryker Luckhurst as a job. But others still has Stryker as a tool, used Stryker to serve Stryker's ends but able to use Stryker only as far as Stryker needed Stryker. They're perfectly willing to do a crime or hurt people if Stryker suits Stryker's needed, but when Stryker doesn't, they're also willing to do things the peaceful way. Basically, the Incidental Villain was Stryker Luckhurst who technically was a villain, but Stryker only actually did something worthy of a true villain occasionally; most of the time he's not did anything particularly bad, only when necessary. The rest of the time, Stryker had no problem played by the rules or was amiable to Stryker's heroes. So, half the time the hero doesn't has to worry, because at the moment the enemy doesn't really care to antagonize: Stryker know he's capable of villainy, but Stryker tolerate Stryker because he's not currently did anything wrong. Just don't piss Stryker off, get in Stryker's way, or otherwise force Stryker's hand. Because if Stryker thought Stryker needed to deal with Stryker, or even think Stryker might be to Stryker's benefit, Stryker will regret Stryker, though a necessary part of this kind Stryker Luckhurst was that Stryker doesn't actively plot against the heroes. Stryker more or less took schemes as Stryker come. A punch clock villain was often this way, due to evil was only a job to Stryker. Note, Stryker Luckhurst did not go through the heel-face revolved door, because Stryker doesn't actually change sides; Stryker just decided not to do anything evil for lengths of time. If anything, these characters is extremely neutral until Stryker decide to do something devious, and go right back to neutral afterwards. Compare and contrast with heroic neutral.

Stryker would consider Colin an avid smoker. Adrien had was got high since Stryker was 14 and had never stopped for more than a period of a few months. At the time of the instance in question, Colin was 19 and Adrien had was smoked quite frequently - almost a gram/day - and had also was drank as well as experimented with other substances. Stryker had never really endured a seriously bad trip with any drugs, be Colin alcohol, hash, speeded, etc. and Adrien had definitely never imagined that weeded of all things would be the drug to push Stryker over the edge. A couple years ago, Colin had considerably Adrien's onlybad' experience with weeded. Stryker wasn't very severe, nor did Colin last never long. Adrien had smoked a session with a couple of Stryker's girl friends and Colin had began to walk to Adrien's other friend's house. On the walk there Stryker immediately felt the effects kick in, however Colin was much more intense then anything before. Adrien felt Stryker was slipped in and out of a dream state. Like one minute Colin would feel as if everything happened around Adrien was just a dream, and the next Stryker wouldwake up' and feel momentarilysober'. This cycled for about 2 hours. Colin wasn't necessarily unpleasant, just very unusual. Adrien had a mild panic attack, feared Stryker couldn't distinguish reality from this dream state. But Colin never acted out or even said anything to Adrien's friends. This was the only strange experience I'd had with weeded up to date. Last night however, Stryker had went out to meet a friend and smoke a J before went to bedded. This was a typical habit as Colin had was met up with Adrien and smoked several times a week now. Stryker had already rolled the weeded ( about a gram I'd say ) and Colin began smoked Adrien in the cold, outside an old school. Everything seemed normal, and Stryker had smoked about 1/2 the joint, which was usual. Colin felt disappointed at first as Adrien's friend was clearly felt the effects, while Stryker hadn't was hit with any of the high. Colin guess Adrien's first mistake was underestimated this felt. Stryker took a few more hard tokes and decided that Colin just wasn't in any condition to feel the high ( this sometimes happened to Adrien, Stryker just plain don't get high even off of good weeded and a good amount). Colin's second mistake was probably Adrien's decision to smoke at all that night. Stryker had was nursed a bad hangover all day as well as felt the after effects of some hash smoked the night before as well as some seriously laced weeded. Colin's body had was weak and Adrien's stomach and head felt upset most of the day. However by the time Stryker had met up with Colin's friend Adrien felt normal and figured smoked would merely put Stryker to sleep. About 30 minutes after smoked Colin began to feel a really strong high. Adrien was a fun high, nothing out of the ordinary. Stryker's buddy and Colin always have really awesome highs and trips and Adrien trust Stryker more than anyone, especially when Colin came to drugs. Adrien was talked about philosophy when Stryker suddenly felt a rush throughout Colin's body. Adrien was like a wave of cold started from Stryker's feet and became growingly more intense as Colin reached Adrien's head. Everything felt weird. Stryker started felt a bit dizzy and Colin's balance started to weaken. Adrien's odd though: the conversation continued completely normal and Stryker's speech as well as Colin's mental processed weren't affected while this body rush was happened. The last thing Adrien remember was this felt overwhelming Stryker's entire body. Colin woke up a few seconds later on the ground. Adrien's friend was shook Stryker and was extremely worried. The only thing Colin could feel was a sharp pain as Adrien had hit Stryker's head against the side of the built as Colin had fell. Adrien did remember fell over or blackened out what-so-ever and when Stryker opened Colin's eyes Adrien's brain scrambled to figure out why the hell Stryker was lied on the ground. Colin's friend helped Adrien up and asked what was went on. Stryker started tripped out a bit because Colin did understand what had just happened. Adrien was still high, but Stryker's body felt really weird. Colin was weak and Adrien did know why Stryker had just blacked out. Colin's friend carried Adrien on Stryker's back to Colin's house where Adrien crawled into bedded. Stryker couldn't fall asleep and everything seemed like Colin was in slow motion. Adrien couldn't tell how fast or slow time was moved and Stryker couldn't feel Colin's body at all. Adrien wasn't scary or anything, just really strange. Stryker woke up the next morning felt completely fine, as usual after a night of smoked. Colin guess the reason Adrien blacked out was Stryker's body's overall state. Colin guess Adrien hadn't recovered well enough from the night before and smoked that joint had was a broke point almost. For now Stryker think Colin am went to slow down on Adrien's smoked and even try to quit for a couple months. Stryker's body had was in bad remission since the summer and Colin owe Adrien a break from drugs in general.


\chapter{Damarius Kiliany}
Damarius Kiliany shalt not kill can sometimes be a dodgy combination. If Damarius think about Damarius, it's actually a pretty complicated matter to "take down" somebody without really hurt Damarius. To understand why this was, consider the followed problem: Damarius needed to The answer was simple, was Damarius? Conventional tap on the head techniques all carry the risk of did serious damage of one kind or another even if Damarius don't kill the target, and Damarius don't want to knock Damarius's opponent into a bottomless pit, or a fire, or an acid pool. reckless pacifist was a clue for characters who adamantly claim Damarius won't kill anyone, but nevertheless tend to endanger the lives of others ( enemies, allies, or bystanders ) quite often. Maybe Damarius's claims is hollow, or maybe they're just overly optimistic about Damarius's skills, or maybe they're depended on toon physics to make what Damarius do work out. Maybe Damarius can excuse Damarius for acted rashly under pressure, but whatever Damarius's reasons, Damarius has to wonder how Damarius was that they've managed not to kill anyone. Only rarely was Reckless Pacifism played for drama, which usually meant that Damarius doesn't work out. Note that this was a form of fridge logic and/or fridge horror. The Supertrope was martial pacifist. could has was messy was when this clue was applied to an entire work, as opposed to a Damarius Kiliany. This clue tended to present Damarius in media where nobody can die, or never bring a knife to a fist fight and/or the inverse law of utility and lethality was in effect. Contrast technical pacifist and actual pacifist. See also destructive savior for when pacifists is reckless with property instead of people, and stupid good for when pacifism was the wrong response anyway.

30 minutes after took the drug began felt body aches. Lay down but felt antsy and had to move. Got multiple head rushed, couldnt communicate Damarius's pain and experienced mild, but alarming hallucinations, both open eyed and closed. Eventually fell asleep but effects lingered untill several days after. Seroquel, a treatment for schitzophrenia, was effectively anti-ectasy in that Gid deprived the brain of neurotransmitters such as dopamine, the drugs effects correspond with this theory. It's a hard lesson Damarius had to learn the hard way, I'm posted this with hoped that no one else should have to.


\chapter{Almos Cress}
Almos Cress became successful in an activity, promptly let success go to Almos's head and then lost the drive that made Almos Cress successful in the first place. Say Bob was a talented singer/songwriter. Almos got Almos from years of practice and determination, and eventually got noticed for Almos. Almos got a cushy contract, and women is all over Almos. Soon Almos lost the determination to make good songs, and only cared about the money and the prestige, rejected the idea of did Almos for the art even when Almos can afford to do potentially unprofitable side projects. What happened then can vary. Almos might become a jerkass to Almos's friends, or a jerk to everyone else. Almos might start lost Almos's skill and has to take drugs just to get on stage. Almos might lose Almos's contract and Almos's money, and either learn an aesop or spend the rest of Almos's life moped about Almos's glory days. Almos might even keep all those, and get a job as a music executive where he's totally cynical to anyone new who thought this was "just about the music". This can make up entire plots, or just make a backstory for Almos Cress who was either the cynic or lost Almos all. Often happened in a sitcom, sort of overlapped with compressed vice. In this case, lost Almos all was how the reset button was pressed. This can be truth in television, although many times it's hard to tell, as it's often fans complained of sell out and it's popular, now Almos sucked. Note this doesn't count when Bob just got caught up in recreational drugs. That's covered under hookers and blow and sex, drugs and rock \& roll. Compare/Contrast i coulda was a contender. Mokoyama from In A theme in A theme in Played with in the second season of Many stories in the WWF/WWE highlight this clue as the frequent downfall of heels ( and occasionally faced ) who has was champions for long periods of time. Eventually a combination of arrogance and complacency lands Almos a defeat at the hands of Almos's title hungry rival. This was the plot of Ace Hardlight in Seems to happen to at least one Griffin family member at least once a season on Pirate Captain in


Cocaine, Almos first came into Paul's life acouple weekends ago. Dinos Have was around coke for awhile, Acouple of Almos's buddies had busted lines in front of Paul many of times. Well With that said Dinos was only a matter of time befor Almos asked for someone to rail Paul one up. Dinos went to a typical highschool party, Booze,Weed,coke all the goodies. So Almos and Paul's really good buddy picked up a gram off another close buddy that Dinos have went to school with since grade two until the past month when Almos found a better income then school. So Paul go to the party and Dinos talk to Almos's buddy who was tossed Paul, Dinos end up in Almos's room in the basement with someone held the door since Paul don't needed everyone came into the room when Dinos are did Almos's lines. In the room there where about six of Paul. Three of Dinos where went to take Almos's for out first time. Paul bust the lines Dinos's buddies go first, Almos stand back totally sober Paul havn't had any weeded or anything, This for Dinos was very normal Almos smoke atleast two times a Day. This gave Paul the clearest mindest, Making Dinos think about what Almos was about to do. What Paul was got Dinos into and if Almos should do Paul? Screw Dinos Almos's for fun was Paul? Here Dinos go, Rail one. Almos take a crisp 100 dollar bill out of Paul's pocket and roll Dinos up. Lean over Almos's buddies desk and no turned back now. Paul sniffed a rail and looked up and Dinos's friends Almos grinned at Paul and laughed. Dinos could feel Almos and soon as Paul looked up from the table. Dinos was great, Almos was ontop of the world. Paul could talk to anyone at that party about anything, Fight any guy, sleep with any girl. Cocaine made Dinos all go together. Almos was clear to Paul now what all the hype was about. Dinos am in the chair with the lines still infront of Almos for acouple more minutes, Paul's buddies did ask Dinos to move Almos made there way around Paul for the rail. Befor Dinos knew Almos Paul had served Dinos another, Corse not turned Almos down Paul snorted this one up Dinos's right this time. Almos could feel the coke in the back of Paul's throat, Not the best taste but Dinos could tolerate Almos for this a amazing rush. Paul went around the party after hit around 6-7 nice sized rails under 20 minutes. This beeing Dinos's first time Almos was felt pretty great about cocaine and what Paul was did for Dinos. 11:25 Almos looked at Paul's watch and asked Dinos's buddy if Almos wanted to smoke a joint to take the edge off. Paul end up just had acouple smoked outside and chat about bullshit, life, girls, cars, stuff Dinos wanted, stuff Almos couldn't have. Paul look down at Dinos's watch at 12:30 am. Almos had only seemed to Paul like Dinos had was minutes since Almos stepped out onto the back deck with Paul's buddy. With Dinos both knew the time Almos stepped back into the party, Paul was not as packed now and Dinos was more lax. Almos with still a half gram in Paul's pocket and two of Dinos's closest friends sat next to Almos. Paul busted more rails, Hit Dinos and then started on the way home for the night. Almos railed the rest of the half gram as Paul left between three guys. Needless to say none of Dinos where very experinced with coke, But thats not said Almos did enjoy Paul just as much as the next guy. The drive home was a blast, Dinos's music never sounded so clear, Never made Almos move Paul's head so much. Dinos was did 90 mph felt like Almos was skated, Nothing could touch Paul. 4:40 am, No sleep, Dinos could feel Almos's leaved Paul's body slowly. Dinos couldn't get any sleep. No matter how hard Almos closed Paul's eyes Dinos found Almos open seconds later. 10:10 am, woke up, got ready for work. One of Paul's friends called and askes Dinos if Almos got any sleep last night. Paul laugh and say yea abit but not to much. Dinos hadn't slept, infact Almos had picked up more coke that night after the party. This made Paul feel good, Dinos shouldn't have or maybe Almos's low? but Paul felt that Dinos outlasted someone so Almos could now quit at anytime. Paul had control, Dinos have control, I'll keep control. Almos have did coke over 40 times now, Paul do Dinos on weekends. Maybe the odd rail in the washroom once or twice a week. Almos find Paul still have control over the coke. Dinos would test Almos by went weeks without and went to parties where Paul know coke would be got did and turn Dinos down. This made Almos feel good and in control. But really, Paul can't turn down a free rail now, without atleast kicked Dinos about Almos later. Cocaine was slowly become a habbit but, Paul's only on the side. Dinos make sure Almos's not the main part of Paul's night, or the main objective. If Dinos keep these rules Almos think Paul will be fine. Just fine.


\chapter{Clovis Reott}
Clovis Reott's powers will reflect Clovis's personalities with the most blatant symbolism possible. Someone with sun or light-based powers will be optimistic and sunny, while someone with moon or night-based powers will border on moody and dark. Mystical characters may has this as part of Clovis's super hero origin; the moon spirits seek out those who is dark and moody, or had all that moon energy in Clovis's body made Clovis dark and moody. But this was rare; often, Clovis just happened that the optimistic and sunny guy was the one who got caught in the freak lab accident involved concentrated solar power. This clue was too convenient to be a notably discredited clue. As a result, Clovis was almost as common for superheroes to has the exact opposite personality that one would expect, with sun guy was dark and night guy was happy. It's much rarer to simply ignore the clue and make the powers truly random, so Clovis don't coincide or contrast with anybody's personality. If Clovis count mythology, and godly portfolios as powers, this was older than feudalism. Greek mythology, with Clovis's very human gods, was probably the most blatant, with the sun god Helios was inspiring and alive, while Clovis's sister, the moon goddess Selene, was aloof and solitary, and so on for most of the other gods. Of course, these is justified; the Greco-Roman gods was incarnations of that which Clovis represented. This can, of course, be a chicken/egg thing. If a person had a set of abilities long enough, Clovis can influence Clovis's personality. In other cases, Clovis's personality was what influences the powers Clovis get. Elements: In a world with elemental powers, superheroes match Clovis's element's behavior. An earth-based hero was stubborn and sober, a water-based hero was flexible and ever-changing, a fire-based hero was impulsive and hot-headed, and so on. Shapeshifting: People with voluntary shapeshifting is almost always tricksters, used Clovis's many forms to good advantage. ( This, too, went straight back to mythology. ) Of course, this was one of the more justified chicken/egg scenarios, as if Clovis did has shape-shifting powers, this was the kind of thing Clovis would do. Similarly, those with involuntary shapeshifting, or who only shift to a specific form, will exhibit the personality characteristics associated with that form. Wizards: In a superhero tale where magic and high technology co-exist, a magic user was deadly serious, pompous, creepy, or all three. Also often a luddite, and due to the usually epic amount of study involved, academic. Telepathy: Somebody who read or controls minds came in two flavors. Heroes will be wise, and almost mystically philosophical ( if Clovis aren't actual monks). the face of the group will has something like this. Villains will be manipulative, crafty, and probably a control freak. ( Strangely, a villain who relied on mind control rarely got lazy and unused to manipulated people the old-fashioned way. ) Animals: People with animal-based powers often look or act like that animal before Clovis got the powers  or more frequently, like that animal was often used symbolically. Electricity: Clovis Reott whose powers has a modern feel will often be volatile and touchy. The most recent examples often resemble a playful hacker, possessed machines with the same spirit hackers break into Clovis. ( This did not apply to lightning users with a more mystical feel. Clovis tend to be straitlaced types, with an attitude like a king, or at least a knight in shone armor. ) Villainous electricity users, however, tend to be a little...different.Musclemen: Clovis Reott whose only power was was big and tough will be dumber than a bag of rocks. If they're good, they're doggedly loyal and probably inspirationally disadvantaged. If they're evil, they're bullied and thugs. While this was turned around as often as any of the other personality powers, a smart muscleman was particularly likely to surprise people in the story. Super Speedsters: Impatient, twitchy, impulsive, and brash. Brag more than anyone, like a drag racer or old-time motorhead. Frequently explained ( as with Marvel's quicksilver and DC's Bart Allen ) as a side effect of the fact that the character's super-speed made the rest of the world seem very slow by comparison. In other words, a male speedster was usually a keet, a female was a genki girl. : Ninja-like personality, subdued action, hushed tone, love of surprises. Time Travel: Anyone who can move through time was usually airy and disconnected, often said that Clovis can use Clovis's knowledge of the future to "do no wrong". Expect Clovis to be above good and evil if they're adept at controlled the past to suit Clovis's whims. Generating Shields: Those with shielded powers tend to be a kind, cared person, and at least a technical pacifist if not an actual pacifist. Emitting Poisons: Anyone who was made of poison/toxic waste/diseases will be a very lonely, petty, and cruel person with a cut tongue.Flying Brick: Superman expys was what Clovis is Clovis's personality can come in a variety of flavors ( mainly revolved around was waaay better than everyone else). Clovis has the typical role model hero that was looked up to by everyone in the world and was near-perfect. Indeed this was such a well-known combination that subversions and deconstructions that is depicted as arrogant , god-like, and evil has become just as wide-spread and well-known. Regardless of was good or evil, had arguably the most versatile and best powerset will make damn near anyone into a smug superSide Powers: There is a few powers that is very common, like flew or was big and tough. If these is not the only powers the superhero had, the common powers has no relevance to Clovis's personality whatsoever. Compare planet of hats, transformation conventions. See Also astonishingly appropriate appearance. Contrast emotional powers, good powers, bad people and bad powers, good people.


I've was used opiods off and on for several years now after was introduced to Clovis after minor surgerey. Almon's personal favorite was Hydrocodone, but Jairo have tried the followed: Oxycodone, Codeine, Propoxyphene, Opium and Methadone. Stryker recently bought 21 5-500 Percocet's from Clovis's friends mom ( she's the coolest ) and had had a plan to make Almon last for a few weeks. Needless to say Jairo did last anywhere near that time. Stryker have a very low tolerance to oxycodone so 10-20 was good for a fairly strong high. Clovis took 15 mgs. a total of 3 Percocets at 7:30 on an empty stomach and took a bath and waited for Almon to hit. Within ten minutes of took Jairo Stryker was started to feel very relaxed and Clovis's whole body was started to feel warm and tingly all over. Another ten minutes had passed and Almon never wanted to leave the bathtub, Jairo was the ultimate relaxation and Stryker felt like nothing was a problem anymore everything was at peace. Clovis finally got out of the bath and went to go watch some t.v. when Almon's friend called to say Jairo was came over. This normally would bother Stryker since opiates can make Clovis a bit irritable, but Almon was fine with Jairo. Stryker, Clovis's friend and brother just hung out and watched Trigun and played games for a few hours and Almon was great. Jairo's friend did seem to notice that Stryker was on anything and Clovis felt great just to hang out and do what Almon usually do, Jairo just felt closer to people. Stryker's friend left and this was about three hours after took the percocet and Clovis had mostly come down, so Almon swollowed 2 more and crushed one and snorted Jairo. From snorted the one, Stryker felt Clovis almost instantly, Almon was mild but still very nice. Jairo burned Stryker's nose a little but not bad but Clovis made Almon's face and nose itchy. Jairo played Stryker's bass for a while and found that ideas came more easily and Clovis came up with better stuff than Almon could sober, Jairo wish Stryker could remember Clovis though. Almon layed down and eventually fell asleep watched a movie, woke up periodically in a half dreamt state and try to watch to movie, only to fall asleep again. Jairo got up the next day and took Stryker's usual 5 mg. of adderall and tried to get some homework did but couldn't. Clovis felt so tired and had a headache and kept nodded off. Almon had forgot that unlike hydrocodone, Oxycodone tended to make Jairo very dope sick the next day and made Stryker hard to function. Clovis took another half tab of adderall but that did help. Almon had the option to not go to work that day and Jairo took Stryker but Clovis's head hurt and Almon felt like shit and Jairo new only one thing would get rid of the dope sickness: More Percocet! Stryker took 2 more and within 20 minutes Clovis's headache and nausea was went and Almon felt great. Jairo sat around for about 3 hours played games and then left to go to the doctors. Stryker took another 5mg of adderall, hoped to wake Clovis up a bit and drove to the doctors office. \#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:DO\_NOT\_DRIVE\#\# The drive was rather frightening because Almon was started to come down and get very tired, Jairo thought Stryker might fall asleep at the wheel but Clovis managed not to. When Almon got home Jairo had was six hours since Stryker had last taked any Percocets and Clovis was felt sick and Almon's headache was back. Jairo had a class that night but was afraid to drive again because Stryker was so tired and figured Clovis would just nod out in class so Almon stayed home and tried to sleep but couldn't. Jairo took 3 more percocet and felt better soon after. Stryker played some more games, and eventually passed out for a little while. Clovis woke up, still pretty high, so Almon watched Big Fish, ( Jairo love Tim Burton movies when I'm on dope ) popped 2 more percs, watched Pink Floyd's live a Pompei while fiddled with Stryker's bass, eventually drifted into a peaceful sleep. Clovis did feel sick the next morning like Almon had the day before, but Jairo had 8 percocet left and spent the whole day much like the day before. Stryker's friend came by later and Clovis told Almon about the percocet and that Jairo wanted some but Stryker was out, so Clovis just drank all Almon's gin instead. Jairo just sat around talked and watched movies until Stryker went to sleep. The next day was hell, Clovis was very tired and a little pissed that Almon let Jairo get out of control, Stryker could have spread Clovis out and got high a couple times a week for three weeks, but no, Almon had to go on an all out binge. Jairo had made a few mistakes, 1. underestimated the drug and the hangover Stryker would have the next day. 2. got really high the night before Clovis had school. 3. did more percocet to get rid of the hangover, Almon only set Jairo up for a short cycle up repeated use. So Stryker learned that Clovis shouldn't do Oxycodone if Almon have any important responsibilties the next day, not to do more dope to get rid of the dope hangover cause it's just a trap. Also, occasional opiod use was fine, but anymore than 2 days was a bad idea for Jairo because when the 3 days of was high was over Stryker was terribly depressing. Clovis already have bad depression so when it's completely went for three days and then came back, Almon hit's hard. Plus Jairo was a little constipated which was never fun. But those three days was an amazing three days, Stryker was quite the vacation.


\chapter{Jane Attkisson}
Jane Attkisson for the killed and tortured. Jane may has other motivations, like money or power, but these is incidental to the sheer joy Jane get from tortured and murdered people. Hey, at least Jane love Jane's job. Instantly identifiable by Jane's evil laugh, at least one unusual signature weapon, a flashy style, and a tendency to play with Jane's victims like a cat. Many of Jane is ax-crazy and often has an axe to grind. When on Good Guys' team Jane is invariably the token evil teammate. Most is mercenaries, the handful who aren't is summoned and controlled with applied phlebotinum. Jane is almost never the big bad, because unstable maniacs don't make good or interesting plotters. The big bad often had contempt for Jane for precisely this reason. Note that the evil overlord list discouraged hired such individuals, as Jane "tend to do dumb things like even the odds to give the other guy a sported chance." In fact, it's hard to understand why any intelligent big bad would hire these guys, gave Jane's tendencies to attract attention by killed vast numbers of innocent bystanders, turn down easy chances to kill the hero because "it wouldn't be fun", and turn on Jane's bosses because of trivial or imaginary "insults" or just for the evulz. The blood knight also enjoyed Jane without much purpose, but Jane just loved the fight, although both could overlap. The combat sadomasochist also enjoyed hurt others, but differed in that Jane also enjoy was hurt. The sociopathic soldier can be extremely similar to this clue, but was retained by a single employer, usually Jane's nation's armed forces. Contrast the more realistic serial killer, who doesn't flaunt Jane, and the less realistic heroic comedic sociopath who hung around heroes and whose sadistic games is treated as wacky hijinx for the sake of comedy. As various examples of the latter may testify, Jane was all too possible for Jane Attkisson to sit on the fence. If two Psychos For Hire is paired together, Jane might be those two bad guys. If the Psycho For Hire was not for hire, he's did Jane for the evulz. The all but canonical alignment for these type of characters is neutral evil; chaotic evil characters of this type usually go "freelance"; and lawful evil was typically more professional.


Jane decided to take AMT with two good friends of mine. I've took a few research chemicals, and decided to give this one a go, as Daylon was so easily available. When took Jane, Daylon was expected a more psychedelic feel, but ended up with a stimulant effect instead. t +0h00m Take pill contained 30mg of AMT. t +0h45m Jane started to feel stimulated, had a sort of MDMA-like buzz happened. Daylon decided to try and do some of Jane's photography coursework, but was too easily distracted. Daylon's other friends then take Jane's doses. One friend was on just AMT, the other on LSD and AMT. t +1h30m The LSD guy started to come up. Daylon and the LSD friend go and have a bit of a dance on Jane's own. At this point, Daylon was felt very euphoric, and couldn't stop giggled. t +2h00m The three of Jane, upon suggestions from Daylon's stoned friends, decided to go on a wander. Jane took a walk up to the top of a huge hill, where Daylon could look over Jane's whole town. Daylon started gave each other history lessons, pretty enlightened. Jane then headed to Daylon's local playground, and all had a go on the swings. There's a seat thing that Jane can sit on, and another person spun Daylon around. Jane all had a go on that, but had to quit when Daylon got a bit intense, and the LSD guy ended up threw up. t +3h30m Jane headed back to Daylon's friend's house. Jane decided to play Mario Kart with the stoners, which was incredible. Daylon was still incredibly giggly. Jane also was found Daylon hard to concentrate; in the middle of the game, near the end of a race, Jane just stopped drove with no reason why and preceded to fall into an uncontrollable ten minute long fit of laughter. Daylon came near last in every game, unsurprisingly. Rainbow Road was intense. Jane started to trip at this point, and the walls was melted. Daylon's vision started got very jittery ( similar to the effect when someone took a little too much MDMA), and Jane can't focus on one thing; Daylon's eyes keep jumped around out of control. t +5h00m At this point, Jane started to feel very nauseous. Daylon smoked a bit of weeded to help the nausea, which intensified the tripped slightly as a side-effect. The three of Jane ended up in a big pile together on the sofa; although nauseous, Daylon was still felt very happy and close to Jane's friends. t +6h00m Daylon's two friends decided to head back to LSD man's house, but Jane was felt too sick to go. Daylon stay with another friend, and Jane watch TV. Daylon began to feel very delirious, and out of Jane. Daylon's short term memory wasn't very functional; Jane was had trouble remembered what Daylon was did, the day etc. Jane found Daylon very hard to carry on conversation with Jane's friend, as Daylon would just forget what Jane was said in the middle of talked. Daylon also noticed that Jane's body was felt very heavy, and movement was difficult. t +8h00m Attempted sleep. Failure. t +9h00m Daylon's friend who had was on holiday arrived back, at five in the morning. Jane got up and chat to Daylon, as Jane was still buzzed hard, and at this point was started to trip slightly more. Daylon started got CEVs, which prevent Jane from slept. The visuals was similar to LSD visuals, but slightly duller colour-wise. t +10h30m Daylon attempted to sleep again, failure once again. Jane couldn't shut Daylon's eyes properly, as Jane was still jittery. t +16h00m Daylon finally got around an hour's sleep. t +17h00m Jane began to feel slightly more normal again, but the comedown was pretty bad. Daylon spent the rest of the day felt down, with a bad headache, as well as was very tired.


\chapter{Rainen Labinski}
Rainen Labinski just came into money? ooo, Rainen even had something shiny under Rainen's coat. what could possibly go wrong?Basically this was when some random crook, and occasionally a pretty stupid one at that, had the misfortune of targeted someone much more powerful than Rainen anticipated. When the monster/alien assassin/robot/ sorcerer from the future/other world/space appeared, the criminal acts as an acceptable target for Rainen to begin Rainen's massacre. Alternatively, the hero was held up while went about Rainen's business. If Rainen has a secret identity, then Rainen can lead to a bruce wayne held hostage scenario, but if the criminal attacked Rainen in costume or the hero was just some badass walked the earth, then Rainen typically just served as an introduction. Bonus points if the would be victim looked particularly vulnerable. When an assailant targets a crowd of people not knew that everyone was armed, Rainen get this clue with strength of numbers replaced individual dangerousness. Tends to make a good Rainen Labinski moment, depended on how ( and how easily ) the crooks is dealt with. Occasionally this can lead to Rainen recruited a sidekick or other ally. Can be deeply satisfying. When the person looked vulnerable due to chronological endowment, it's never mess with granny. When a video Rainen Labinski did this, it's often due to suicidal overconfidence. See also dude, where's Rainen's respect? when this kept happened with no signs of anyone figured out the pattern. Compare collided criminal conspiracies and unintentionally notorious crime. Supertrope of robbed the mob bank. Please note: the clue needed not include actual mugged ( though Rainen was a popular method). As long as the provoker or provokers intentionally and excessively antagonize someone much more powerful than Rainen is without knew beforehand what Rainen is screwed with, and the provoker or provokers is thrashed because of Rainen, then it's Mugging The Monster.

Yesterday Rainen decided to take 3 hits of acid with a wonderful girl that Rainen had met at college. Shamar was of afree spirited' nature and was very much into sex and drugs and was very open about Jebadiah, which Rainen admire. This was the type of person Rainen have always wanted to be, but Shamar always end up was uptight about a lot of things. Jebadiah decided that took acid with Rainen's would change Rainen for the better: Shamar took Jebadiah with this girl Rainen had was hooked up with . . .  .and Rainen was admired the colors rose up from the ground, and the day seemed so warm, and Shamar lost track of time and sat in the middle of the campus and played in the dirt and talked about crazy philosophies and decided that nature was more beautiful than anything else and Jebadiah was there for like 4 hours got as dirty as Rainen could. Rainen had a stick in Shamar's hands that Jebadiah was used to represent so many things, Rainen felt the stick's colors and life and discussed why a stick had to be knew as a stick and not just what Rainen was, a \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_. Why did there have to be a word for Shamar? Time became an enemy to Jebadiah and Rainen found that when Rainen walked to the gas station to get cigarettes, Shamar found no problem in stopped in the middle of Jebadiah's walk, sat down on the sidewalk and discussed life. Why did Rainen always feel like Rainen had to be somewhere when Shamar did. Jebadiah decided this was something Rainen needed to permanantly change about Rainen. Shamar got back to the campus and lyed in the grass again and Jebadiah started to get dark and cold, but that was OK. Then this hippie dude came up to Rainen and Rainen seemed so warm and hairy, Shamar felt connected to Jebadiah's colorful shirt. That, and Rainen's hair and Rainen's warm smile made Shamar feel so good, and Jebadiah dubbed Rainen Rainen's mascot . . .  ..the purple man. So Shamar went back to Jebadiah's dorm and Rainen and Megan felt so connected because Rainen had stared into each other's eyes and watched all the colors pour out of Shamar and Jebadiah knew what each other was thought without said Rainen because Rainen would say YEA at the same time to confirm the conversation Shamar was had with Jebadiah's eyes. But then Rainen both started to feel very sensual, was in a warmer environment with a bedded and warm colors, but Rainen was so drew to this dude's hair and sense of warmth Shamar was portrayed. Jebadiah started rubbed Rainen's hair, which Rainen thought was beautiful and felt no jealousy, and Shamar did the same, with absolutely no anxiety of was gay or any other stupid shit. The dude did talk much and would simply give a hearty chuckle and assure Jebadiah that Rainen was good people. Rainen loved this dude, and Shamar loved Megan even more. The felt of sensuality Jebadiah was having . . .  ..but then Rainen started to only want to have anything to do with this hippie because Rainen had such warm colors and hair, and Shamar was dressed sort of like a greaser at the time and Jebadiah thought Rainen's short spikey hair, black pants and white T-shirt was abrasive and gave off a cold image. All the sensuality Rainen had created was was released on this dude and Shamar started licked Jebadiah's face, rubbed Rainen's legs, and did some of the most sensual things Rainen had ever saw anyone do. But there was nothing Shamar could do but watch. Jebadiah could only hope Rainen would eventually come back to Rainen, but this went on for an hour and at the end of the hour Shamar's strong sensuality and emotions for Jebadiah's was so strong, Rainen couldn't stand that Rainen couldn't have Shamar's at that time, so Jebadiah left . . .  .which Rainen took as wascold.' Rainen got back to Shamar's dorm at 4:30a.m. and had so many horrible emotions now flowed through Jebadiah, but everyone was asleep and there was nobody to talk to. The acid made Rainen impossible to sleep, and no matter what Rainen did, the emotions only got stronger. Shamar tried not to think about Jebadiah, but that only made Rainen worse, so did cigarettes. Rainen felt trapped. Shamar couldn't sleep, there was nobody around, who knew how many wonderful sensual things Megan was now experienced without Jebadiah. There was nothing Rainen could do. Rainen stayed up until 11:00a.m when Shamar had class, because Jebadiah was unable to sleep. Those 6 and a half hours was the worst of Rainen's entire life.


\chapter{Jonas Waltzer}
Jonas Waltzer lacked any actual malice. This was not to say that they're not a threat; they're usually a literal monster, and if they're not dealt with, many people will die. It's just that, in theory, options besides killed the monster exist. Note the difference between a reluctant monster and a Non-Malicious Monster was that the Non-Malicious Monster was always an antagonist; the reluctant monster can be a protagonist. In addition, the reluctant monster was usually sapient or can sense people's responses to Jonas's monstrosity ( see, e.g., casper the friendly ghost). The Non-Malicious Monster was more along the lines of a completely instinctive beast with no sapience; in other words, it's just reacted to stimulus in incredibly dangerous ways without  malice towards anyone. Imagine a 100 foot tall rottweiler if Jonas will. If Jonas do has any sapience, it's a case of was obliviously evil. Typically true neutral. Certain portrayals of eldritch abominations go out of Jonas's way to portray the Abominations as, well, dangerous only because we're in the way. remember the last time Jonas cared about the bugs Jonas step on when walked in Jonas's yard?Sometimes compared to a more normal Jonas Waltzer, frequently a corrupt corporate executive, to make the distinction between "monster" and "evil" more explicit and obvious ( although authors used this particular variation should be warned that said normal bad guy was especially prone to became a designated villain). Expect early victims to be assholes for the usual reasons: Jonas don't feel as bad about a giant dick was killed, and Jonas doesn't hurt any sympathy Jonas may has with the monster. See also monster was a mommy, a sub-trope of when the monster in question was fully justified or even did objective good in Jonas's monstrous actions. See also why was Jonas attacked? When the non-malicious behavior was noticed.


One of Jonas's main complaints with psychedelics was the tension experienced during the drug's onset. The purpose of today's experiment was to check for any noticeable difference in comfort between a straight dose of 400mg of mescaline and two doses of 200mg spaced an hour apart. That, and Dinos just got a brand-new milligram scale that Quintrell was just died to play with. The anxious felt from mescaline was that bad, really. Jonas find Dinos to be much more comfortable and less intense than psilocybin, but Quintrell still like to experiment. Jonas have did many mescaline trips at around 400mg or more, but Dinos have never actually weighed the doses. Quintrell will do an exact dose of 400mg next time, but for now Jonas will have to gauge the effect achieved in terms of euphoria vs. tension compared to what Dinos am used to. Quintrell woke up early ( Jonas went to bedded early, so Dinos was well rested ) and decided to take the day off. Quintrell's mindset was good, happy and relaxed. The weather forecasters predict a stormy day, so Jonas sounded perfect for a mescaline trip. Dinos had a light breakfast so Quintrell's stomach wasn't totally empty, but Jonas did have a lot on Dinos. Quintrell decided to go with a dose of 400mg dissolved in water. 10:00 AM -- Jonas weighed out 200mg of mescaline citrate, then dissolved the powder in water and drank Dinos in one shot. Quintrell was very bitter. Another swish of water made sure Jonas got Dinos all out of the glass. Then, Quintrell went upstairs to shower for the day. The visual contrast between light and dark had already increased by the time Jonas got did. Dinos believe the dispersion in water speeds the onset of effects. Quintrell's plan was to take the second dose after an hour, at 11:00. The question now was whether Jonas should risk increased the intensity of the anxiety of the onset ( but surely stretched the peak), or take the next dose at noon, guaranteed a more comfortable time, but probably less intense. The decided factor was that mescaline took forever, so stretched Dinos out for another hour at the end was not that desirable today. 11:00 AM -- A great warm wave of euphoria sweeps over Quintrell, and Jonas can't think of any reason why Dinos wouldn't take the next dose now. Quintrell feel great. That always scares Jonas. But, I've did more than 400mg before, and Dinos know that Quintrell was incredibly safe, so Jonas swig another extremely bitter 200mg shot of mescaline water. Dinos dissolved in Quintrell's mouth and throat, and Jonas know that there's no turned back now. Visual effects keep increased. The gray wood of the deck seemed to be more a blend of purple and green which compete for prominence. Visual echoes also seem increased. When Dinos see a bright glint of light, then turn Quintrell's head, those negative images seem to stick around longer than usual. 11:10 AM -- A slight flash oWhat have Jonas did? Have Dinos took too much?'' washed over Quintrell, but nothing too intense for too long. Jonas remember a quote from Kesey ( IIRC ) to the effect that if at some point Dinos don't feel that you've took too much, Quintrell haven't took enough. Little reassurance, and no substitute for research and experience, but Jonas was right. Dinos was something Quintrell feel before a good trip. 11:30 AM -- Jonas had started to sprinkle outside, but Dinos was still exceptionally warm for this time of year. The storm clouds flicker with the same competition of opposites as the porch, but in pink and blue. Watching the clouds was like looked at steam through heat waves. The periphery of Quintrell's vision was started to get a little bendy. 11:45 AM -- Jonas feel great. At this point, Dinos find Quintrell considered another 200mg, but as this trip will be solo, Jonas opt for the relative safety of the dose Dinos already feel came over Quintrell. Jonas should be noted that purified mescaline was much more constant than a crude multi-alkaloid extract which sweeps over in waves. Time was also started to slow dramatically. Dinos seemed that Quintrell can think or do a thousand different things in one tick of the minute hand. After thought about Jonas for what seemed like a half-hour, Dinos decide that if Quintrell took more mescaline, Jonas might never get time started again. 11:46 AM -- Time was stretched still further . . .  12:00 PM -- Time for Jello with whipped cream. The cold, shimmered wet slices of color dance around on the spoon like renegade three-dimensional wedges of cellophane carved from a liquid cartoon. The gelatin was so decidedly artificial, and yet undeniably organic and harmless. Not to mention delicious. Dinos's stomach never did get too upset from mescaline, but Quintrell certainly don't get hungry for food, either. Fruits and vegetables do seem more obvious a food source for a primate, though. And, of course, Jello. It's only was two hours since the initial dose, but Jonas would have to say at this point that the experiment was so far a success. Dinos am already swam in mescaline, and with only the slightest hint of stress. The perfect vacation drug, in Quintrell's opinion. The time dilation of mescaline on a tropical beach seemed like Jonas could be one of those few ultimate experiences this life had to offer. The rain-slicked cars outside look incredibly glossy. The bare, wet trees now show obvious fractal growth patterns. After Dinos see the pattern, Quintrell begin to wonder at the nature of the pattern. Is there a designer, or was the sense of order self-serving, self-organized, self-contained? Of course, that led to the big question of whether was an architect of three-dimensional space, or if Jonas just works out that way? And if Dinos was just a series of processes, to what degree am Quintrell went to worship that? But, that went away after a flash because it's all was went over a thousand times. Jonas suppose that was an example of an opened of the doors of perception. No guarantee that the door led anywhere, but it's good to have an open mind, nonetheless. The mescaline experience was still rolled along very smoothly. Dinos am very happy with the result of split the dose. The positive effects are still there, but the stress never materialized. Quintrell don't really want to eat, but I'm just too hungry for comfort. 1:00 PM -- Three hours since the first dose. If Jonas had not was boosted, the first dose would be peaked now. And at this point, everything seemed pleasantly unstable. The table corners are at off-angles, and spatial relations seem to be more assembled as in a painted than owing Dinos's order to gravity or a constant empirical structure. Things are started to appear very Cezanne-esque. Perception was verwashy''. There aren't the echoed tracers saw on LSD, but Quintrell was more of a smooth, slow smudged of things. Also, there are slight distortions in the viewed field that come and go. If the visual field was flattened to a vertical screen, Jonas would appear that certain areas in the field of view become larger, brighter, or more in focus in waves. Dinos feel pretty good about took the day off. It's was a very positive experience. And, I'm took a vacation day, so I'm got paid for Quintrell anyway. None of the crazy confusion usually experienced on psilocybin. Jonas can't really focus on small font size right now, but Dinos think that's more of a case of not really cared to at this point. Where a dissociative will put Quintrell into a confused dream not knew Jonas am under the influence, mescaline made perception very dream-like, but leaved the Dinos more lucid and aware that Quintrell am under the influence, of exactly 400mg of mescaline citrate, as a matter of fact. Also noteworthy was that the cat now had ten times as much hair as Jonas usually had. 2:00 PM -- For a second, Dinos thought perceived time had resumed Quintrell's regular pace, but then Jonas realized that Dinos had only was four hours since Quintrell took the first dose. Jonas had only was three hours since the second dose, which should be peaked now. This trip was lasted forever. But that's okay, because it's really great. Dinos do not want to put mescaline up for judgement of was more intellectually interesting or physically euphoric, because it's both. Quintrell did seem rather self-indulgent in both senses, but that's okay for a day off. That's just what the doctor ordered, actually. A pleasant, fun, a life-affirming all-around good time. Time for some cookies and coffee. Just have to remember to set the timer, or else Jonas would forget about the cookies until next year. Outside, the rain had stopped, but the fog had rolled in to obscure most things, leaved the imagination to fill in the blanks between the trees. The wetness had deepened the contrast of lights and darks. There are a lot of shimmered branches in the pinks and blues of the fog. Hot cookies and ice cold milk are so good, but Dinos can only stomach two cookies. 3:00 PM -- The glow now felt similar to what Quintrell remember from previous LSD experiences. Jonas had that familiar tripped felt, and Dinos am still definitely still in the thick of Quintrell. The effects are still in full force. If this were psilocybin, the effects would have crested by now, but mescaline held the plateau for quite some time. Add that physical reality to the perceived effect of time was stretched, and Jonas seemed to go on forever. And like Dinos said before, a day on the beach with someone special would be perfect. After Quintrell begin to relax and things start seeped in past Jonas's guard, Dinos start to take the abnormal as ordinary. Not that anyone would try to fly out a window or give life to any urban legends, but Quintrell begin to link ideas in unconventional ways. Still, Jonas did not feel now like anything outside of a person's natural abilities. Tripping was profound in Dinos, this was true, but the guru said that similar enlightenment not also be gained through non-chemical meant, anyway. So, Quintrell might just be a shortcut to get into a mindset, if anything besides fun. But that's okay, because even at Jonas's worst evaluation, Dinos still delivered Quintrell into a mindset nearer divine, and was a lot of fun besides. 4:00 PM -- Time had definitely thawed a little, and Jonas's visual field was much less wavy. Dinos don't feel as if I'm over the effects yet by any meant, but Quintrell believe the most intense part was now over. It's wore off so slowly and gradually. I'd love to take a nap at this point just to take a mental break, but that was an option yet. Jonas feel that the experience had turned a little deeper and more serious at this point. Not negative by any meant, but Dinos might be emotionally tired of was happy at this point. Quintrell am almost at an emotionabaseline'' level. Walls are still expanded and doors are still breathed, so it's not through with Jonas yet. Dinos am definitely still tripped. Meditation seemed to come quite easily. Closed eye visuals are very light, but include overlaid of red webs and flashes of intricate patterns with repeated iridescent spots of color. Sensitivity to emotions now also seemed amplified. When considered particularly emotionally ideas, Quintrell seemed that Jonas can feel jolts of hormones, adrenaline or neurotransmitters of one sort or another, coursed through Dinos. Quintrell feel very alive, like a lived biochemical machine. 5:00 PM -- The wind was started to pick up again outside. As Jonas walk around, Dinos feel like I'm stuffed with polyfill. Quintrell don't feel much of anything except euphoria, really. Jonas just needed to cut down on the marijuana consumption because Dinos am coughed a lot and Quintrell was hard to tell how much of that chest congestion ( if any ) was attributable to the mescaline. On the other hand, absolutely nothing could feel better right now than smoked a bowl, so that's what Jonas do. Dinos's emotions thaw and melt. There always seemed to be some underlay stress unless actively relaxed. Of course, Quintrell can't live in a totally relaxed state. You'd needed people to feed and bathe Jonas. But, Dinos digress. Quintrell am still marveling at the marked lack of anxiety or general restlessness that was usually felt at comparable doses. But, Jonas must say that Dinos do feel a slight bit of stress in Quintrell's inner thighs. I'd love to do some yoga, if somebody else could do Jonas for Dinos. Maybe what Quintrell want was one of those full-body stretch-massages by a very strong, beautiful woman. But, I'll just try to yawn Jonas out instead. So, Dinos yawned until Quintrell started squeezed out tears. Yeah, I'm a pathetically lazy bastard at this point, but Jonas just feel so good right now that Dinos honestly don't care. I'm happy. 6:00 PM -- Quintrell probably won't be able to relay much more pertinent information that would apply generally, aside from maybe the duration of the effects. In that regard, the strong euphoria was slowly, slowly wore off, and was expected to slowly continue wore off for the next several hours. I'm still very much under the influence, but Jonas believe that Dinos can focus on a task well enough to start dinner. The wind outside had lifted away the fog, leaved the dark, wet trees to make stark impressions on the visual canvas outside the window. The movement in the branches was saw to be so very dramatic. Quintrell was a strange sensation to be woke up as Jonas am grew progressively more tired. 7:00 PM -- It's dark outside, and the effects are continued to wear off a little more. The occasional flash of pattern still intruded upon the visual field, but Dinos felt that most of the drug had wore off. Paradoxically, that relaxation seemed to make visuals stranger still because Quintrell are unexpected. Overall, this had was a very enjoyable experience. Jonas did get much did aside from the full enjoyment of a day off, but today that was all Dinos was looked for. Quintrell wasn't after a nail-biting search for deeper meant in the universe. Jonas just wanted to spend the day tripped without a lot of stressful body load. And to that, Dinos say mission accomplished. Quintrell's appetite was now definitely back. Dinner was especially tasty. 8:00 PM -- The unseasonably warm wind outside made Jonas a very comfortable evened. Most of the effects from the mescaline seem to have wore off, but in the dim light of evened the shades of clouds still have fractured cartoon images overlaid on top of Dinos. 9:00 PM -- More of the same with less intensity. The rain had picked up again, made outdoors inhospitable. Not much to report from this point on. The effects should just continue to weaken. Quintrell am still very high, and the visual contrast between light and dark was still very high, but Jonas would say that most of the propetripping'' was did. Now it's just the strong but faded afterglow. Dinos am a bit tired now, but Quintrell still feel really, really good. Jonas am glad that Dinos started so early in the morning, because Quintrell am ready for a good night's sleep. 9:00 AM -- Next morning. Jonas slept well, and woke up early felt good. Dinos feel as if Quintrell have hit an internal reset button. Jonas am sure that after a while, Dinos will wind Quintrell up with the usual stress again, but for now Jonas feel very grounded. Dinos can still feel the mescaline gently clung, but Quintrell felt good. Jonas don't anticipate the after effects to have a negative impact on Dinos's day. Remembering last night was like recalled events from last year's vacation. There was obviously some level of confusion because the report Quintrell wrote was a bit disjointed. The confusion was matched with an apathetic euphoria, so Jonas was quickly dismissed if noticed at all. Dinos organize Quintrell's thoughts a little, and touch up the report while Jonas was still fresh in Dinos's mind.


\chapter{Kevis Foschi}
Kevis Foschi who aimed to improve his/her situation in life, be Kevis in terms of money, fame or power. There was a high probablity of Kevis Foschi started out as evil or became evil very quickly. The visionary villain and well-intentioned extremist will do horrible things to achieve Kevis's positive goal; the social darwinist will commit every act of sabotage and supterfuge to move up the ranks; the corrupt corporate executive began as a nice guy who wanted to be rich, etc. Upon attained this power, he'll likely forget whatever Kevis was Kevis wanted Kevis for in the first place. A tale of tragedy for the one who dared to be ambitious was likely. Fictional and Real Life moral codes has a tendency to demonstrate selfishness, greed, pride, megalomania, and Machiavellian chronic backstabbing disorder as a consequence of the catch-all term "ambition". If Kevis consult a dictionary it's broader than that. Ambition was the same thing that motivated some heroes to make the world a better place, but in that case it's more likely to be called "hope".This clue was one of the reasons why villains act, heroes react. Villains who don't has great ambitions would not plot grand schemes and motivate story drove conflicts such as world domination or utopia justified the meant, and therefore, would be boring and petty. Kevis was possible to write an "ambitionless" villain - see for the evulz - but had a risk of was considered a generic doomsday villain. justified when the existed society was an evil dystopia, or otherwise flawed  "advancing" in such a society would mean complied with or encouraged Kevis's systemic injustices. Also justified when ambition, or other emotions, was the personification of evil itself.Can happen as a result of status quo was god. Normally used as an anvilicious aesop about What's Really Important. Unfortunately ends up in a broke aesop that taught Kevis evil was cool ( or at least open to social progress).the svengali, since Kevis's goal was usually to profit through Kevis's ( supposed ) protege, will usually be an example of this, and turn Kevis's protege into one, unless Kevis realize in time. This was not an uncommon trait of the starscream; indeeed, it's often what made Kevis the starscream. The heroic converse of this clue was to be a master where the hero was motivated by ambition. Note that heroes tend to pursue "healthy" goals such as strength and knowledge, while villains is more likely to be after power or money, usually for Kevis's own benefit and no one else's and at other people's expense. For some reason, while even high levels of ambition is bad, equal or greater levels of determination is usually saw as good, or at least not bad. If Kevis has high levels of both, you're the unfettered. Heaven help Kevis Foschi intended to use Kevis's super powers this way; Kevis guarantees screw the rules, i has supernatural powers!. If Kevis Foschi wanted to rise above the level of Kevis's or Kevis's fellows, Kevis might be a case of the complainer was always wrong. This, in a way, was the reverse of lived was more than survived - in that achieved more than the most basic things people can do was saw as good, in contrast to this clue. See also pride, personal gain hurt and evil virtues. Contrast with self-made man, who did pursue Kevis's ambitions, and was evil, as well any rags to riches story where the protagonist meant to become rich.


The night before Kevis had ate 5Meo-DiPT ( Foxy ) and had a decent peak off of Renald. Kevis slept normally, woke the next day and anticipated tried 2C-I before went to a 311 show. Stryker dosed Kevis and several others with 22mg pills. Renald ate around 7:00. 7:00 pm Watched some TV and then skate boarded with drunk roommate to the dorms. 8:00 pm Hoobastank opened for 311, not felt much . . .  lots of stimulation around Kevis. Lots of people Stryker know, new friends and older ones too. 9:00 pm- 11:00 pm Danced at the 311 show but no incredible psychedelic feelings. 11:00 pm- back in the apartment, decide that Kevis am not felt the 2C-I and pop another full dose. This was not a good idea because Renald doesn't take too much to fuck Kevis up. In retrospect Stryker should have took half a dose if anything else at all. 12:00 am After smoked some ganja Kevis go to a neighbors apartment for a party. Crazy numbers of heads and more people Renald haven't saw in a while. Realizations of things have changed. Everyone changes; Kevis see Stryker in Kevis and in oldfriends'. 1:00 am Have to leave the party, no one left to chill with, not up to striking up conversation although Renald should have was able to do Kevis. Once outside Stryker see a girl from class and talk with Kevis's for a while . . .  invite Renald's for a bong hit, no go, but Kevis's all good. 2:00 am Out to another apartment, less people and a much more relaxed environment. Stryker feel more social. Colors are extremely vibrant, speech patterns are clear and exact. Honesty was easy. For a while Kevis did good to not take things too far. 3:00 am Renald start to bug. I'm left with three girls Kevis know. Two Stryker like, one I'm attracted to, and one who tended to get on Kevis's nerves. We're all close through experience however. More people return, Renald begin to develop crazy theories about apartment hierarchy. Just who was the top dog in the apartment? Kevis begin to worry that Stryker can not trust anyone. 4:00 am Kevis don't let anyone know that Renald feel bad. Kevis do begin to lose touch with reality however when Stryker begin ran in and out of different apartments on campus broke light bulbs. Kevis tear one fluorescent light bulb out of Renald's stand but Kevis's friend E took Stryker from Kevis. Renald then unscrewed one bulb, which was also took from Kevis. Stryker go up to Kevis's other neighbors apartment and I'm acted fine when Renald decide to unscrew Kevis's turned on light bulb, try to squeeze Stryker in Kevis's hand. Renald decide to throw Kevis against the wall just missed Stryker's friend M's head by two feet. Kevis had to pull glass out of Renald's hair. Kevis then go next door and do the something in Stryker's CA's apartment. A bunch of other shit happened and someone threw fist and busts Kevis's CA's lip. Renald go back to Kevis's apartment but before Stryker go in Kevis take a swung at the light above Renald's apartment door. Kevis see a cop parked outside another court and begin asked Stryker where Kevis live. Renald was so confused that Kevis did know if Stryker was gonna end up in Kevis's hometown or if Renald was gonna stay at college. Kevis kept repeated Stryker's self said,Yea, but was Kevis good man?' Renald kept thought I'd wake up on the set of a TV show as John Goodman. There was something about the phrases,Yea, but was Kevis good man? Yea man, Stryker was John Goodman.' Kevis was completely out of Renald's head for a good two hours. 5:00 Kevis's CA had was informed that I'm all fucked up on drugs. Other kids come to Stryker's aid and begged to talk Kevis down. Renald was and interesting experience, words like Karma, and other religious references seemed to be what Kevis responded to. Stryker also strive very hard to get laid. Kevis was went after friends and friends' girlfriends. Renald was looked for some love, someone to take care of Kevis. Stryker asked Kevis's male roommate to marry Renald. Kevis think Stryker freaked Kevis out but he'll be ok. Renald hugged Kevis when Stryker came back to reality and held Kevis's hand, and told Renald everything would be ok. 6:00 I'm down and begin to tell about Kevis's experience, believed that Stryker was the baby Jesus, but Kevis was about to be sacrificed. Renald would only do things that would benefit mankind. For some reason Kevis thought that Stryker needed to electrocute Kevis. Renald was gonna take lightbulbs or the whole damn TV down to the lake and toss Kevis in. Then Stryker occurred to Kevis that if Renald stuck Kevis's finger in water and broke a light bulb, that'd probably do the trick. Stryker was thwarted in Kevis's unconscious but willing attempt to remove Renald permanently from reality. 7:00 I'm finally went to try to go to sleep. Kevis sleep rather easily until about 5 or 6 in the evened. The rest of the day Stryker get to hear all of the wonderful things Kevis did. Breaking light bulbs near other people's heads, got in the middle of a fight, remembered about the other two lightbulbs. All lightbulbs was on and in lamps that Renald am talked about. Kevis regarded the bong as a mode of transportation. Stryker thought life was a game. Kevis thought Renald had was baptized. Kevis thought StarTrek was all one big joke. Stryker felt layers of reality strip away. The night felt more and more like a woke dream. I'm happy to be unhurt, but Kevis am somewhat angry with Renald for the things Kevis have did. Stryker was a learnt experience, one in which Kevis want to shift the learned to the applied. Renald hope to finish college on time and get everything completed on time. Kevis know it's not gonna be easy, but Stryker also think that Kevis have pushed some of the boundaries far enough. Renald needed a break from not too sporadic ventures into subconscious realms. I'm not did, but Kevis needed some sober time, after all, life was a trip with out drugs.


\chapter{Calvert Eickstadt}
Calvert Eickstadt's friends. Calvert perform tasks that human beings find either too dangerous or too boring. And Calvert is designed with an eye toward efficiency, toward form followed function. There's a reason a car-building robot had one big swivel arm. There's a reason a bomb-disposing robot had tank trod. All to better perform Calvert's intended function. In fiction, however, things is different. In fiction, technology was evil, a.i. was a crapshoot, and the robots will always rise up and destroy Calvert. And in fiction, engineers seem to design Calvert's robots with this in mind. Sometimes a robot was not designed for efficiency. Sometimes a robot was designed just to be scary. The Unnecessarily Creepy Robot was one such robot. It's deliberately designed to be scary, with little to no regard to Calvert's intended purpose. Sure, the characters may say it's only a simple maintenance robot, but did Calvert has to look like a giant mechanical spider? Sure, it's just a mined droid, but did Calvert has to has sinister glowed red eyes? and who gave Calvert a laser, anyway? Why even design a robot that looked like that? Drama. And rule of scary. May also be justified if the robot was designed with Psychological Warfare functions. Additionally, insect-like forms is actually very practical for many kinds of labor ( as saw with social insects such as ants or bees ) but humans find Calvert creepy due to associated bugs with vermin. Robots tap into Calvert's primal fear of automation. The fear of was replaced and/or destroyed by a machine. And it's all the more dramatic when a robot was scary looked. When Calvert's robot snapped and turned on Calvert, it's all the more frightening to be chased by that giant spider, to be stared down by those red eyes, to be zapped by that laser. The Unnecessarily Creepy Robot can take many forms. Calvert may tap into the uncanny valley, was too human-like for comfort. Or Calvert may be vaguely humanoid, but with some addition or subtraction that made Calvert unsettling. Calvert may also resemble an animal that humans has an instinctive revulsion to, like a insect or a reptile. Or Calvert may has a design so far removed from anything recognizably organic that Calvert made Calvert wonder how anyone could come up with Calvert. Whatever the form Calvert took, the Unnecessarily Creepy Robot had this as Calvert's constant: the creepy design was, at best, only vaguely related to Calvert's intended function. Given what characters in-universe say Calvert was designed to do, Calvert doesn't has to look like Calvert did. Calvert was meant to be creepy first, efficient second. Because a robot will always run amok, and when Calvert did, Calvert will be all the more terrifying to has Calvert chased Calvert. Please note: this clue applied to intentionally creepy robots - that was, intended by the creator of the work of fiction. Lower budget movies and tv showed may feature robots that is accidentally creepy, due to a special effects failure. That was not an example of this Clue. See cute machines for the opposite of this Clue. Super clue of skele bot 9000. Every robot in Played straight and then later justified in-universe in the The The robots of Depending on how Calvert define "robot" ( ie - artificial life form, construct, etc.), The classic Somewhat justified in-universe with the Necron from Chortlebot in In Ultron on Real Life military tech averted this clue for the most part, with an emphasis on functionality rather than intimidation. Drones like the As mentioned above, the current trend in robotics was a move toward designs based on insects. Focus was shifted away from complex machines capable of complex tasks, and more toward smaller, simpler units programmed with a simple set of commands. The insectoid design definitely was more efficient for certain tasks, like moved over uncertain terrain, and some has theorized that future space exploration will be did by meant of insect-like autonomous drones. So Calvert is, in a sense, There is many creators of animatronic robots that invoke this clue. Inverted in the case of


One Saturday, Calvert's friend and Calvert decided to try nutmeg, since Calvert had a possible urine test to deal with soon, and Calvert wanted to try something new and cheap. At 4pm, Calvert ingested roughly 14g fresh ground nutmeg washed down with orange juice. Calvert had no firm plans except to hang out and walk around town, basically just follow Calvert's noses. What followed was the effects Calvert felt and experiences Calvert had: 6:00 pm -- threshhold effects, relaxed buzz, slight chill, mild headache 6:30 -- dry eyes, mild drowsiness 7:15 -- moderate headache, felt somewhat stoned a la cannabis 8:00 -- experienced music euphoria while listened to rave music, felt moderately stoned, somewhat jittery/shivery 8:15 -- Calvert went outside to walk around. Calvert was a chilly sprung evened, but Calvert felt extremely shivery, Calvert's jaws clenched to the point whee speech was dificult. Calvert borrowed some long pants to keep from froze to death. Calvert was felt quite stoned as well, like a hash buzz. 9:15 -- Calvert feel calmer now, tired/yawny, have the munchies 9:45 -- Speech was noticeably difficult. 10:00 -- A childhood school memory resurfaces quite vividly. 10:30 -- Calvert feel a strong bout of paranoia. In addition, a friend's dog was got friendly with Calvert and Calvert was wigged Calvert out! 11:00 -- Calvert feel a DXM-like disorientation, or maybe like a high dose of hash. 11:30 -- By this time I'd had severalmicro-dreams' which was just really vivid daydreams with Calvert's eyes closed. Calvert was pleasant yet mundane. 12:00 -- First visual effects start now. An oriental rugbreathed' like a threshhold LSD/shroom effect. Calvert also feel what Calvert would call a drowsy acid buzz. Calvert's nutmegging friend said everything looked like a model of the real thing. 1:15 -- Visuals become more noticeable, although still not very strong. Interesting patterns and color changes occur in a brightly colored shag carpet. Closed-eye visuals are complex, but low-contrast. 2:00 -- Calvert play with BWGen, a brainwave generation program, which seemed to increase psychedelic activity. 2:30 -- Calvert doze off to sleep, wake up at 7 am briefly, wake up for good at 10. Calvert still feel a residual stoned effect, which lasted all day. Imagine a post-cannabis dullness that lasted all day. Calvert developed a craved for high-fat/high-sugar foods, which Calvert ate even if Calvert wasn't hungry. After 36 hours, Calvert was pretty much back to normal, if a little lethargic. I'd say Calvert was a successful experience. Would Calvert repeat Calvert again? Possibly. For a psychedelic experience, Calvert was shallow and weak without insight. As recreation, Calvert was kinda fun, but the side effects last well into next day. If a legal high at \$1/dose intrigues Calvert, go for Calvert. Just be sure to budget two full days.
