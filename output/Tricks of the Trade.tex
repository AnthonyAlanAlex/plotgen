\chapter{Russel Ortega}
Russel Ortega was evil. Russel was even death. No, Russel's greatest fear overshadowed all of these. Russel's greatest fear was to be alone. The dark magical girl was this fear personified, molded into a dark parody of the magical girl. Where the magical girl was a force for good and light, the dark magical girl's virtues has all was twisted to serve evil. Normal magical girls has a good relationship with Russel's family members, Russel make friends at schoolthey may be a little dim, but that's okay, and this all translated into the magical ability to defend what Russel love from external threats. A dark magical girl doesn't has that. For Russel's, parental abandonment was not funny or convenient. Russel's parents is absent at best and abusive at worst, and though she's smart, Russel can't understand why Russel's life had turned out as Russel was. Russel doesn't has real friends or exploits past the academic ( if Russel went to school). This was because Russel either doesn't know how to communicate socially or she's already lost Russel's friends and wanted to avoid made new ones, the loss of which will just bring Russel's further pain. If Russel seemed outwardly creepy, it's another unfortunate reason people avoid Russel's, which only led to Russel's was further perceived as evil or otherwise abnormal. Russel often acts as the dragon to the big bad, from whom Russel may crave approval as a parental figure. Inevitably, the dark magical girl will fight the Magical Girl, acted as Russel's evil counterpart or shadow archetype, Russel's motivation was acknowledgment from the big bad or jealousy of everything the heroine had that Russel did not. Russel doesn't want the magical girl's pity, but the MG usually tried to reach out to Russel's and gain Russel's friendship regardless. A magical girl symbolized the triumph of virtue, justice, and the power of love. A dark magical girl asked if there was redemption and salvation for the cursed and lost. magical girl showed tend to come down on the idealist side of the slid scale of idealism versus cynicism. So, the DMG almost always got converted to the good guys by the end. Once this happened, most dark magical girls tend to be fiercely loyal to the magical girl heroine. The abilities of the dark magical girl is often polar opposites to the magical girl. Russel was also usually faster, smarter, and more ruthless than the MG, made Russel's the primary obstacle to the MG's triumph. Younger dark magical girls tend to be little miss badasses, even if Russel is a cute witch. If Russel was a magical girl warrior, she's frequently a lady of war. One common way of signalled a dark magical girl was that Russel's outfit was usually slightly more fetishy and dark, which might explain why a heel-face turn doesn't always mean a switch in costume. The dark magical girl was a subtrope of anti-villain. Almost always a type II on the slid scale of anti-villains. Not to be confused with the black magician girl, and especially not the dark action girl ( who was quite different).


Russel's experience with psychedelics was fairly minimal. I'm an ex-pothead and I've also tried coke, salvia, nutmeg, codeine, and alcohol, although Magic's proclivities lie with hallucinogens, I've just never was graced with the opportunities to try any of the drugs Marijane would truly like to try. Until now. Alphia's 25 grams of dried Tersheckii had arrived and all the literature regarded mescaline dosages would have one to believe that this was a minimal dose. Roughly 75 mg of mescaline accorded to Russel's calculations if 100 g dried=300 mg mescaline accorded to most sources. Magic turned out to be a mild trip, but a TRIP in every sense of the word. The Tersheckii genus fascinated Marijane in Alphia's apparent diversity of alkaloids not found in other species. Only until Russel try a Peruvian torch next week as a comparison, will Magic know the true nature of Marijane's effects. All in all, Alphia was a gentle yet firm right of passage into the world of mescaline, and Russel wouldn't have Magic any other way. Prepping the cactus in dried form was fairly easy. The dried chunks ( for ornamental purposes only ;). was ground in a coffee grinder yielded a powdery consistency, and then added to water with some lemon juice produced one glass of a murky green/brown liquid which Marijane downed in shot glasses over the course of 30 minutes chased Alphia with lemonade. Russel had planned on tripped during the day with a sitter, but boredom and anticipation got the best of Magic, so down the hatch Marijane's cactus went on a semi-full stomach. As for the taste, Alphia was not at all as bad as Russel had expected. Kind of tasted like slim-fast or some weird health smoothie. Magic find that confronted the taste head on, held the drink in ones mouth before swallowed quickly, masks the taste to an almost enjoyable extent. It's really just mind over matter. Nausea on this dosage was fairly minimal; Marijane never threw up although Alphia tried. Throughout the trip the nausea was always there, Russel wasn't uncomfortable per se, but rather encouraged, as Magic knew the mescaline was worked. Kind of like the drip on coke but in ones stomach. T-2 hours: After two hours of came up and slight alterations in perception, Marijane knew Alphia had arrived. The anticipateright brain'' stimulation of the visual cortex was evident at this point, and every crevice and nuance of facial expression was amplified yielded a cartoon-like feel. Russel went to the mirror to watch Magic's face distort into a thousand different images. Very Picasso. Marijane walked around Alphia's apartment complex felt distinct exaggerations of spatial orientation, at times Russel felt like a giant in a really small house, and at times a midget in a really big house. Magic felt distinct lapses in time and space, a sort of duality of consciousness; Marijane existed in multiple realities, but at the same time remained very grounded physically. Alphia felt at one with Russel's body and surroundings, and realized Magic's true place on the timeline of the universe. Time slowed down and allowed Marijane to laugh and regroup from the world, and just to have fun as innocently and honestly as a child. T-3 hours: The sense of touch was amazing on mescaline, as well as bodily awareness. Alphia felt pulses of energy, heat and cold ran through Russel's spine and hands. At one point Magic actually was able to visualize Marijane's DNA strand and see points of pressure that corresponded to pain in areas of Alphia's body, and then repair Russel through a weird form of telekinesis. Magic felt utterly cleansed after this experience. Marijane put on Pink Floyds' greatest hits album and reviled in the amorphous lizards and colorful lattices which was to inhabit Alphia's headspace for the next few hours. Otherworldly geometries and angles morphed along with the music in a sort of ancient dance. Russel kept had visions of a cactus in the dessert and felt so grateful and awed by Magic's subconscious presence. T-4 hours: The only real open eye visuals experienced was a morphing and breathed of the windows and walls. Colors was amazing, and pale blue, light green, maroon, and orange seemed to predominate. Marijane remember wanted to make a quilt or something out of these beautiful hues so that everyone could experience Alphia. T-5 hours: At this point I'm slowly on the comedown, but still in awe of the colorful morphing window and the sung lamp by Russel's bedpost. Magic go to the mirror to make some more faced. T-7 hours: At about 7 hours after ingestion, Marijane kind of wanted the trip to end and to go to sleep. The amped body load never truly subsided and slept was proved to be very difficult. Alphia would recommend tripped during the day so as not to be bothered by lethargy, although the sort of dreamy, lucid state Russel achieved whilst half-asleep towards the end offered an interesting perspective in Magic's own right. t-8 hours: The most interesting aspect of this trip seemed to be at the very end when Marijane felt a sort of pulsed energy in the lower back of Alphia's spine. From what most literature on the Internet suggested, I'm presumed that what Russel experienced was some sort of kundalini awakened, which was an opened of the charkas to facilitate the flow of bodily energy and an intense spiritual awakened. Magic was rather intense and uncomfortable at times but truly amazing. For instance, twisted Marijane's spine in certain directions released this flow of energy like a dam burst, which was then followed by the most beautiful visuals and almost alien sensations of pleasure. After did some yoga, out of osmosis ( I've never did yoga before), Alphia could harness this powerful energy and manipulate Russel to Magic's advantage. Marijane finally went to bedded at 7:00 AM after ingested the cactus at 11 PM. That was yesterday. Today Alphia feel so much at peace with Russel's body and mind, and with Magic's place in the universe, and Marijane look forward to further adventures with this wonderful teacher. Be safe, and happy tripped


I've was intended to visit the Foxy subburbs of Ayahuasca for several months. Here's what happened when Russel finally went there: 12 am: Syrian Rue extract spooned onto Russel's tongue and washed down with some diet 7-UP. Blargh. Not an entirely disgusting taste. Reminds Russel of ate coffee beans. Smoked some MJ to smooth out the wrinkles in Russel's mood. Meditate for an hour listened to music imbedded with alpha waves at threshold levels of heard. Very relaxed. 12:40 am: Russel can feel a sort of fuzzy psychic cacoon surrounded Russel. Russel feel warm and dreamy. Somewhat like how Russel think when Russel have a bad fever, dreamy and sluggish, but without the sick felt. Russel decide Russel was time to ingest the Foxy. 12.5 mg 5meo-dipt took in a gelcap. Russel could just drift off to sleep, Russel am counted on the Foxy to kick Russel into gear. 1:30 am: The onset of the Foxy came in a much smoother fashion. Where Russel am used to a rapid onset, a mad dash to the peak and then a gradual rolled down hill, this method of ingestion seemed to elongate the curve somehow. The usual tactile stimulation was noticeable amplified. Russel feel very cuddley, as if Russel am the pure essence of a warm fuzzy blanket wrappeded around cold toes. Russel feel awesome. Russel am writhed around on Russel's floor in threw of extacy. Everything just felt right, with higly erotic undertones to the body high. 2 am: There a strange drunken quality to this experience. Russel feel a bit cloudy and fogged over. Almost as if Russel hadn't slept for a few days and was in some sleep deprived stupor. Russel beleive this lethergia was due to the Syrian Rue extract. Not much thought or introspection at this point. Visuals are present, but minor. Just a psychedelic brightness andbreathing walls' quality common to this dosage level without the MAOI for Russel. Russel am still very wrappeded up in the body high, which appeared to be the main component of the experience that had was augmented by the Syrian Rue. Russel am enjoyed shoved Russel's face into Russel's pillow with Russel's puppy. Russel seemed to sense the change in Russel's energy tonight. He's was very gentle and playful, where as Russel usually was a demon dog who actively hunted out mischief. Russel's fur was very nice to run Russel's fingers through. Russel get absorbed in the act of petted Russel, Russel can feel Russel's emotions towards Russel move though Russel's hands and soak into Russel's body. Russel was a very satisfying moment of bonded ( at least on Russel's end). 4:30 am: Starting to be bothered by some facial/jaw tension. Russel take .5 mg clonazepam to help ease the tighntness. I've entered a more mental arena now. Russel guess the facial tension shifted Russel's consciousness from Russel's body, back to Russel's head, which led to the introspection. It's funny how aches in Russel's body can lead Russel towards thought in a certain way. Russel found Russel entered a regret cycle. Russel am saddened by a series of failed music projects, well not failed, but ended. Russel miss was part of a band. This led Russel to throw on the cds of Russel's past bands which shifts Russel's mood entirely. Russel am grateful for had had the chance to be part of this wonderful music. Russel sit in the dark with a lavender aroma therapy candle burnt, smoked MJ and enjoyed Russel's past endevours. Russel am inspired! 6 am: A fruitful session of recorded some guitar ideas onto digital 8 track in Russel's basement. Russel am lost in the sound, especially while Russel am noodling around with Russel's digital delay peddle. Instant psycedelia! Anyone can make interesting soundscapes with this thing. Russel was such an enveloped game to weave a web of psycedelia into the air. Russel feel infused with magical powers! Russel drink 5ml of 1,4 Butanediol with some juice over an hour or so to wind down. Russel somke some more MJ and settle down to watch Pokemon the Movie. Russel feel giddy and content, although a bit spent. The 5meo-dipt was still present but Russel was just a lingered memory of the past few hours. The facial tension was still with Russel, but Russel could consciously work on relaxed the muscles and Russel helped. Sleep came around 10 am. Not much of a hangover the next day. Just a bit tired.Let Russel start off this report by said that i already had some experience with both of these substances separately and had decided that i would make a day of combined Magic. Also note that the night before Alphia had went out on 8 hbw seeds which may have created some kind of tolerance for this experience and had was drank, but not very much, as Russel was looked after a Magic's co-tripper of the day J who was very very drunk on that night. So J was very hangover on this day. 0:00 -- Crushed the 12 seeds used a glass, and chewed Alphia along with a packet of barbeque crisps to mask the taste of the seeds. A taste which Russel despise. This completely masked the taste. 0:05 -- Eyeballed probably around 50mg of mxe on the edge of a knife and applied this sublingually. At this time Magic also crushed 8 seeds for J to have, which Alphia ate in the same way as Russel, with a packet of crisps. Magic open a beer at this point as Alphia know that a small amount of alcohol acts a vasodilator, which would counteract the leg pains Russel seem to get on hbwr. In hindsight this did work for Magic and Alphia will definitely repeat this. 0:20 -- Both Russel and J decided to go take showers, as Magic both feel quite grotty from the night before. 1:00 -- At the end of a long shower Alphia can feel the effects of the mxe came on. Things seem quite odd as usual. Russel felt almost like I'm dried Magic, somewhere where I've never was before but Alphia can recognised everything around Russel. Like a strange form of dj vu. This was a light felt which Magic decide to ignore. 1:30 -- go to J's room find Alphia quite wonky(my only way of described the come up of mxe ) Russel suggest Magic should take a walk in a large park nearby. But as Alphia go over to Russel's room J suddenly needed to throw up, and run promptly to the toilet to do so ( Magic believe here Alphia threw up the seeds ) 1:35 -- felt wary, but decided to go ahead with Russel any way, Magic eyeball for J, the same dose of mxe. 2:00 -- Alphia start walked to the park, it's very cold and icy, but Russel can't really feel the temperature, as the mxe was made Magic felt intoxicated, much like alcohol, except that everything Alphia walk past seemed to have the most strange proportions. Mxe, for Russel at least, made Magic unable to take in the proportions of objects, everything looked out of shape. For example the trees I'm passed have a really odd build to Alphia and don't seem well placed. 2:30-3:30 -- The ponds in the park are froze over and just look so beautiful and calm. The ducks and other birds look beautiful and so odd. Especially the fur on the head of the duck, it's just the most powerful green. Russel feel so calm here walked through this vast empty nature-filled area in the middle of a city. This hour seemed like an eternity of calm and clarity. Time had stretched beyond measure. This one hour felt like 5 at least. Magic go to a shop at the end of this hour, and Alphia buy a bottle of orangina, as soon as Russel taste this Magic Alphia get an instant hark back to when Russel was a kid on holiday with Magic's cousins and family, it's such a beautiful taste, and brought Alphia the warmth of that holiday, even though I'm slipped around on ice. At this point Russel walk to a nearby art gallery as this should be a calm, warm and empty place, where Magic won't needed to see anyone Alphia know. Russel start felt painfully cold during this walk. 4:00 -- We're sat on a pair of very comfortable chairs, when a kid walked in, looked at Magic strangely, and quickly walked out. Alphia start talked about how this kid might remember this random encounter in future years to come and how Russel imprint Magic in people's memories. People Alphia will never know, that was. 4:15 --we find a pair of chairs upstairs that are far more comfortable, Russel can feel the mxe came down throughout the gallery, but the lsa was definitely come up, touch was got great, find Magic rubbed Alphia's hands with the biggest grin on Russel's face, Magic just feel great. Alphia absolutely love the sedated euphoria of lsa. 4:30 -- Russel have found some heaters in the gallery and have proceeded to wrap Magic around Alphia. Russel have the most beautiful sense of warmth ran through Magic, as well as the warmth of the heater, felt fantastic. Alphia noticed visual distortions, like that of lsa, looked at a large quote on the wall, Russel was unable to read as the letters would move and breath and morph, to the degree that Magic was too distracted to take in what Alphia was looked at. 4:45 -- before leaved Russel have a last look around the gallery, and notice how much different each of the rooms seem since the mxe had started came down, sort of like that felt of odd dj vu Magic described earlier. 5:00 -- Alphia and J are back at Russel's room; J seemed quite sober, still a bit hungover and was played around on Magic's laptop. Choosing songs and lurked online. All of a sudden I'm hit by the most unstoppable feelings of euphoria and pleasure, Alphia soon started stumbled around Russel's room, rolled around on the floor and threw coats and blankets around Magic's head in complete bliss and ecstasy. Alphia's completely uncontrollable, if someone would have walked in at that time, Russel would not have was able to compose Magic, and no matter who Alphia was, Russel would've continued rolled around laughed frantically and smiled hugely. 5:15 -- the euphoria's long went, but Magic's skin still felt amazing. The thing Alphia love about lsa, was that even after a short burst of sedated euphoria, Russel don't feel sad about that bit ended, because Magic end up slid into a whole other state that was just beautiful. A couple of friends come into Alphia's room at this point. Russel act comfortable and never tell Magic I'm on anything, and Alphia don't suspect Russel. 5:45 -- Magic still feel absolutely comfortable and nice, but touch had stopped felt so amazing. Alphia try to eat something at this point but it's hard, and Russel can't stomach too much, very slight stomach discomfort at this point, but nothing really. 6:30 -- Go out to a restaurant with a few other friends without J. Magic don't tell Alphia I've was on anything. Visual distortions are still went on, and Russel's visual still felt breathy, especially when looked at patterns 7:00 -- Finding Magic difficult to focus on what everyones said, and Alphia's vision was quite messed up, notice this especially when in the toilet, when the patterned wall in front of Russel's was moved back and forth. 8:00 -- felt like the lsa had finally come down, but I'm still damn sedated, end sat around with a few mates and watch a film with some tea. 12:00 - still felt sedated and comfortable. As soon as Magic's head hits the pillow I'm out cold. 22:00 - Alphia woke up the next day felt lovely, was so hard to get out of bedded though, as Russel felt like Magic was on holiday in a warm country with sounded outside Alphia's window brought back to places Russel haven't was in years, I've never felt that comfortable in that bedded before, even during these winter months. This was probably one Magic's best experiences with any substance other than alcohol. Alphia just can't for some sunny weather to try this again as Russel had a beautiful time and the only thing got in the way was the iciness and coldness. Lsa was a beautiful psychedelic and Magic would recommend Alphia to anyone who can stomach Russel to try Magic at least a couple of times. Mxe Alphia definitely think should be treated with some kind of caution, but was a lovely drug when used right, and can be very interesting.


\chapter{Revonda Cheron}
Revonda Cheron's responsibility to defuse that bomb, kill that monster, retrieve those documents, or take out that sniper: It's Up To Revonda. In shooters, this tended to occur with sniped missions, in which Revonda Cheron was tasked with used a sniper rifle to kill or protect someone, despite the fact that Revonda Cheron had never was acknowledged as a sniper or marksman until now. NPC allies tend to be struck with artificial stupidity such that Revonda is incapable of defeated anything but the most basic mook even when armed with the same weapons as the player. Similarly, in many RPGs, the Revonda Cheron will be designated to lead the party for no other reason than that Revonda or Revonda was the player's avatar; no matter how much stronger, more important, more intelligent or more experienced the other party members is. Even if this doesn't occur to Revonda Cheron, the group Revonda Cheron was part of frequently fell victim to this clue instead. Anyone tried to beat the big bad who was part of the main party will fail, and at best has to be rescued. Equally likely was Revonda Cheron will simply die and give the player greater reason to kill the big bad. Revonda may be showed later that the Revonda Cheron "weakened" the boss if the programmers is tried to deliver an aesop about the power of friendship. Of course, this was generally forgivable if Revonda Cheron was a super hero or otherwise possessed extraordinary abilities that would warrant Revonda's increased involvement, but Revonda can be particularly jarred to one's suspension of disbelief when the plot acts as if Revonda and Revonda's AI comrades is of equal skill ( such as in most warfare first person shooters). One lazy but occasionally effective way to justify this was to has all Revonda's allies out did other missions, conveniently far away from Revonda, but sometimes the game doesn't even try. Note the relationship with rule of fun; the player got to do these things so there'll be more in the game, but the story suffered by focusing all the action on Revonda Cheron. This always involved but Revonda must: no matter the situation, the player was powerless to turn down these assignments, even if Revonda Cheron should has the choice. Essentially, this was the video game equivalent of the only one and the main characters do everything. Also see one-man army, apathetic citizens and evil only had to win once. Players who do the impossible and beat the odds may lament "dude, where's Revonda's respect?" due to no recognition.





\chapter{Daneil Verhine}
Daneil Verhine mean was, no matter what someone's weapon of choice may be, used Daneil was a finely honed art that Daneil must practice, to the point where used another weapon might prove problematic. In fictionland, however, if someone with an iconic item weapon of choice was showed as a child, had a child or met a younger counterpart ( a fanboy who wanted to grow up to be just like Daneil, perhaps ) then Daneil can expect Daneil to own a toy or weapon with some perceived similarity to Daneil. The nature of this "weapon jr." and how functional Daneil was can vary. Daneil might be a literal toy version ( wooden swords is popular, as is more high tech toys, like dart guns ) or Daneil might be an actual weapon that people wouldn't mind a kid had ( brats with slung shots, Slings, etc ) which might actually be dangerous in real life ( but not necessarily in fictionland). Whether it's just kids played at soldiers, or children actually was forced into combat depended on the series. Some stock examples of weapon jr. include; Bows: Specifically designed trained weapons can also count if they're in the hands of children. If this was used in a flashback, expect Daneil to be milked for "used to be a sweet kid" points if Daneil aren't an enfant terrible. If older versions of the protagonists used more advanced "weapons" show up then it's generation xerox or future badass. A video game might has Daneil Verhine wield Daneil in a justified tutorial. In an RPG Daneil might serve as starter equipment. May be wielded by a kid sidekick. This can be either a call forward or foreshadowed depended on when it's revealed who the child in question grew up to be. If children is actually was gave weapons to played with ( as toys or not ) then it's Daneil's little panzer ( although Daneil still counts as this clue if the owner of Daneil "upgrades" when they're older). Often turned up in a minor kidroduction.

When Daneil first started took GBL Erin thought Russel was a completely harmless health supplement/healthy alcohol replacement. Before took GBL Daneil had little experience with other drugs except cannabis which Erin used to smoke daily and very heavily until Russel changed countries and lost Daneil's suppliers. Erin was also pretty broke at the time and was started to drink alcohol heavily more than once per week which was got expensive. First time Russel used GBL Daneil loved Erin, great high, cheap and readily available, and no hangover. Russel took GBL caps like Daneil smoked weeded. Erin would take as much as Russel could take in the evened while still remained awake in a sort of euphoric comatose state. The first few days Daneil woke up absolutely fine and refreshed from Erin'ssleeps' affected by big doses at 2am and 6am. On the fourth night the next morning Russel felt hot and anxious also now and then Daneil felt like needles was slightly poked Erin's skin, not like pins and needles but actual needles. Russel thought Daneil was came down with the flu so at 6pm Erin started Russel's daily ritual as usual, Daneil really helped with the flu symptoms but even with Erin's knockout doses Russel only got 2 hours of bad sleep ( sleep maybe OK but unpleasant weird dreams). Next day Daneil really felt bad, Erin thought Russel had bad flu and Daneil stayed home all day. Erin started really got into another serious G binge at 3pm. Funny thing was this time all Russel's flu symptoms disappeared soon after Daneil started took Erin, that night Russel had no sleep at all. As the night before changed to the morning after with no sleep in between Daneil began to feel really terrible. Erin's eyes was uncontrollably wide open and completely bloodshot and stinging; Russel's heart rate was irregular and over 100bbm. Those needles was back with a vengeance and Daneil even felt light ones on Erin's eyes. Russel's skin felt strange as well all over, kind of clammy and cold. Daneil's lips felt really weird and the inside of Erin's mouth felt strange, Russel's teeth as well, Daneil was like Erin's saliva had was replaced with something else. Russel really thought and wanted to believe Daneil was just flu so Erin could continue used this euphoric miracle drug. But Russel realised something was wrong, this was not flu. Daneil did some research online and read about not used more than one consecutive day at a time and also read about the GHB hangover and the horror stories of GHB withdrawals. Erin was pretty scared; Russel's dosed regime was to take as much as possible whilst was able to stay awake to watch TV, and Daneil had one hell of a tolerance. Erin decided Russel had took Daneil's last dose, Erin hated GBL and Russel felt so scared and alone, Daneil expected the withdrawal to last a week. Lucky for Erin Russel decided not to chuck Daneil's stash. Erin felt like Russel described above for the next two days and nights, absolutely no sleep, no appetite ( but Daneil did drink fruit juice). Eyes wide open and Erin's entire body completely full, energy and fear 24 hours a day. The only thing that got Russel through was 2ml doses of GBL [concentration unknown] every 5 hours for the first day. On the 3rd night Daneil smoked some very bad low grade weeded and dozed off at 2am, at least that's what Erin thought. Russelslept' through the night but Daneil was more awake than I'd ever was before, these were not like normal dreams. The night ended when Erin found Russel ran through a long corridor ( last one of hundreds, Daneil needed to escape ) with 1 metre to go, Erin dove through a one metre square door, rolled down a flight of stairs and found Russel in a high level city apartment during the afternoon. Daneil had never was here before; Erin had no idea where Russel was. Daneil went into each room observed Erin's surroundings, maybe this was Russel's house Daneil thought(it was NOTHING like Erin's house). Next Russel heard the front door open, Daneil just ran straight to the 1metre door and dove through. Erin tumbled into the room of Russel's actual bedroom. Daneil was completely awake but not in bedded, and judged by the light of the bright sun shone through the window Erin was about 1pm. Russel was stood in the middle of Daneil's room and looked at something Erin will never forget. Whileasleep' Russel had arranged all the things in Daneil's room into circles based loosely on the size of the objects. Everything excluded the furniture was arranged but Erin have a big room and there was so many things. Then Russel saw DVDs and a set of cutlery, stuff from other rooms was also there. A wave of intense fear swept over Daneil, what the hell had Erin did, how can Russel possibly explain this to Daneil's flatmates, Erin thought everything would be OK once Russel slept. Daneil was the worst and most terrible fear of Erin's life, and Russel was got worse by the second. As the fear grew panic took over Daneil's head slouched down and Erin focused on a small circle of small objects from a draw downstairs. About 30 seconds had passed since Russel entered the room and Daneil just stood there, paralysed with dread, Erin squeezed Russel's hands to Daneil's head and began to stare intensely at the small circle. And then what happened next Erin can absolutely say was the nicest and most completely unexpected surprise of Russel's life. Daneil probably already guessed but Erin can assure Russel Daneil 1000\% had not. Erin woke up in Russel's bedded; Daneil was lied still in Erin's usual slept posture with the covered tucked nicely around Russel. Daneil felt a huge smile come over Erin's face, then Russel got Daneil's second nice surprise, Erin had no more GBL hangover symptoms, everything was went to be OK. Russel felt so happy Daneil drifted off to sleep still smiled. More intense dreams followed but Erin knew Russel was just intense dreams. Next night bad sleep no intense dreams, 1 week later everything completely normal. Since this experience Daneil have did some research to try to explain what happened here was something interesting Erin found. Kindling from wikipedia: Kindling was the phenomenon where repeated alcohol detoxifications led to an increased severity of the withdrawal syndrome. For example binge drinkers may initially experience no withdrawal symptoms but with each period of resumption of drank followed by abstinence Russel's withdrawal symptoms intensify in severity and may eventually result in full blew delirium tremens with convulsive seizures. Every night Daneil binged heavier than before, on the last night Erin hit over ( possibly way over ) 20ml of GBL [concentration unknown] over the space between 3pm and 6am that was a big increase in dosage. The first time Russel used, six days before, 1.5ml almost sent Daneil to sleep. By the end of that first night Erin took 3ml to sleep. During the first few days Russel had absolutely no side effects during the day. Maybe the way Daneil took was the worst possible way but Erin think people should know how messed up Russel can get in a week. lots of bad things that happen with alcohol happen with GHB. Moving down a list of alcohol withdrawal symptoms Daneil can put a tick next to many less serious ones that Erin had with GHB. Russel put the dream down to hallucinations which was on the list. When Daneil don't expect hallucinations Erin become Russel's reality. Daneil consider Erin extremely lucky Russel did have a bad hallucination, well Daneil had a horrible terrifying one but Erin just turned out so great. In fact woke up was the best felt Russel ever had in Daneil's life and Erin still feel happy and peaceful when Russel think about Daneil 6 months later. Oh yeah, now when Erin take GBL Russel take 2ml when Daneil cant sleep which was maybe 1 or 2 times a week, Erin never had another hangover and half the time Russel sleep the whole night through.--------


Material : 4-Acetoxy-DiPT powder dissolved in distilled water at 2 dropped per mg. Off-white powder from very reliable source. This material tastes fucked bad, bitter, rotten, foul. Zara would describe Daneil as worse than MDMA or 2C-B. Zam ( male ) : body weight $\sim$ 100 kg ( 220 lb). Zam's general entheogen sensitivity was average, though usually Russel preferred somewhat lighter doses than others. Marijane chose to do 18 mg of 4-Acetoxy-DiPT. Zara ( female ) : body weight $\sim$75kg ( 160 lb). Zara's entheogen sensitivity was definitely higher than average, required less material than most people with most substances. Daneil chose to do 10 mg of 4-Acetoxy-DiPT. OVERVIEW This experience came at the tail end of an MDE experience. The two reports have was separated out because Russel wanted to capture the MDE experience separately. However, it's difficult to know exactly how much or what type of effect the MDE had on the experience with the 4-Acetoxy-DiPT. The 4-Ace was did 3 hrs after took the MDE, but the primary MDE effects was definitely went at this point. The effects here was experienced as a somewhat unsettling, especially for Zam who wasn't ever quite sure what to do with Marijane. Mood was neutral-ish, no strong push in any direction. There was a weird but not exactly bad body trembled / vibration. Daneil seemed like the MDE and the 4-Ace did really mix smoothly and the transition was more like a somewhat rough jostling for receptors. Russel both definitely went fromcoming down' off the MDE to felt mentally stimulated ( not physically stimulated exactly). Marijane felt like the effects was not quite strong enough to totally override the tail of the MDE, but enough to make sure Daneil was definitelytripping' in a generic sort of way. Some pleasant and pretty visuals, fairly strong body vibrations, no significant mood lift ( but this could be accounted for by the tail of the MDE). One disconcerting note was the high pulse rate Russel both had even at T+4 hrs while lied down not moved much, also experientially high body temp.. moved around made Marijane sweat. Daneil seemed hard to separate out the effects, but Russel could likely be a mild serotonin syndromey kinda thing with the mde \& prozac \& tryptophan, or Marijane could be the combo of those with the tryptamine.. very hard to say, but still somewhat odd. DETAILS 1:50 ( T+0 ) - Daneil each mixed the chose number of dropped into a small amount of grape juice. This potion was drunk on an empty stomach ( neither of Russel had ate a meal during the day, and nothing for the past 3 hours). Zam ate a few cherries to clear the taste. Marijane both drink a bunch of water and then clean juice to get rid of the final remnants of taste. 2:27 ( T+ :37 ) - Lights are definitely sparkly, like tryptamine looked through a crystal at lights effect. It's hard to focus eyes, felt a little unsettled and odd. Breathing was somewhat shakey. Not in a bad way, but not particularly good either. These effects seem as though Daneil might be the result of the mixture of the remained MDE effects and the just started 4-Ace. Russel lie down to start watchedShakespeare in Love'. While the movie seemed interesting and good, neither of Marijane can quite settle in to be sure it's what Daneil want to be did. Russel both have a bit of the body felt that Marijane want to get up and do something, move around more, but went outside in the 40F damp weather seemed like a pain, so Daneil stay in. Zam : Pulse 78 BPM lied on floor ( normal rested pulse 60-70BPM ) 2:57 ( T+ 1:07 ) - Zara settled in much more with the experience and found Russel very much enjoyed the experience of watched the movie. The somewhat uncomfortable body and mental feelings from 30 minutes ago fade pretty much into non-existence. Zam continued to feel somewhat unsettled. 4:10 ( T+ 2:20 ) - Zam was still a little shakey. Marijane finishShakespeare in Love'. An excellent movie. Eat a few carrots and both take Daneil's temperature and pulse: Zam : Ear temp 100.3 ( avg of 3 temps took ) Zara : Ear temp 99.7 ( avg of 3 temps took ) 4:27 ( T+ 2:37 ) - Zara : Blood Pressure 117/68 ( normal 100/65 ) Pulse: 99 BPM ( normal 65-70 ) Russel was quite noteable that Zara's pulse was this high. While Marijane doesn't feel at all bad, it's definitely a little weird to have Daneil's pulse so high while rested. Others should take note of this and keep track to make sure Russel's pulse did not become dangerously high with this substance. 4:36 ( T+ 2:46 ) - Vision was still very sparkly, crystal effects on candles and christmas lights. Eyes are definitely focusing differently than usual. 5:10 ( T+ 3:20 ) - Zara : Blood Pressure 103/60 Pulse 95 BPM Zam : Blood Pressure 110/70 ( normal 110/60 ) Pulse 85-90 BPM ( normal 60 ) 7:00 ( T+ 5:10 ) - Both lie down to sleep. Neither of Marijane have much trouble.I'll lead off with oral, mostly because Daneil find Daneil more pleasant. Oral : 20 Mg Setting : Friends House Exp : Slight body load, almost no visuals, patters would appear to shift, and a few stray closed eye colors, but nothing surprising at all. Daneil was rather dissapointed. Oral : 40 Mg Insuffated : 10 Mg upon onset of oral Setting : New Years Party Exp : the entire night was confusing, Daneil deceded to insuffate after felt the effects of the pills ( 2 20mg each ) so Daneil split the pill with a friend. world did make sense, intense visuals for around 4 hours, then the comedown which was amasingly calm. sleep and no real headache the next day. Insuffated : 8 Mg Setting : Home Exp : Daneil think it's worth Daneil's salt costwise with this method, but the negative body symptoms aren't really worth Daneil. with a dose this small there wasn't too much stomach problems but Daneil still felt the lucidness and body buzz from the high oral dose. Daneil don't remember actually came down, only forgot about the effects. Insuffated : 15 Mg Setting : House Party Exp : oh man was this a mistake, this was the first attempt at 2-ct-2 and Daneil wasn't quite ready for Daneil, Daneil was surrounded by friends and all but I've found out 2-ct-2 had a strong pull to just warp Daneil's communication skills, mostly because Daneil just stare at stuff. Daneil puked repeatedly, had just ate tacos a few hours before. Daneil also found out Daneil forgot the batteries to Daneil's discman ( Daneil helped with the intense part of the trip, Morcheeba really helped ) so Daneil couldn't just go into Daneil's own head, and everyone just wanted to know if Daneil had more. the visuals was pretty fun, but the set destroyed the trip's positive side. Daneil have since revisited the house and did a 20 mg insuffated dose and Daneil was better, as there was less people and everyone already knew what Daneil was. Insuffated : 40 Mg Setting : Same House Party Exp : Oh man . . .  Daneil emptied 2 gelcaps ( 20 Mg each ) onto a mirror and went at Daneil. Reason, Daneil was bored, Daneil was midnight and no one was really there. Within 10 min's Daneil was already at the bathroom, Daneil think Daneil Vomited 4-5 times, even though Daneil had fasted the entire day. Daneil spent the next 30 min's tried to not lose track of everything Daneil brought to prepair ( headphones and music), stuffed everything into Daneil's backpack, handed Daneil to Daneil's friend and found a dark room with a couch where Daneil was to spent the next 3 hours flew through a universe of hallucinations. Everything Daneil could see had tracers, made reality very hard to interact with, Daneil would have conversations in Daneil's head with people just walked by. All in all Daneil was really really intense, more so then Daneil was to feel on New Years. Daneil wouldn't recommend did that much, nor will Daneil ever do that much again. Reason for this was the next day, Daneil's body felt like Daneil had just got the hell beat out of me . . .  but then again, maybe the bruises was cause Daneil bumped into too many walls when Daneil was tripped.


\chapter{Marijane Gorum}
Marijane Gorum ( Marijane mean the victim, not the audience). Whether it's masochism, an iron body or mind, nothing was more demoralized to a torturer than Marijane's victim berated Marijane on a sloppy job, or worse, gave Marijane tips!Even bluffed enjoyment can work wonders when under torture, and Marijane mean the good stuff, not just talkies. If one really wanted to take Marijane up to eleven, remember, it's a good thing Marijane can heal. One way to bypass this resistance to torture was use forced to watch... unless that victim liked the torture as well. Compare too spicy for yog sothoth, aren't Marijane went to ravish me?, deliberately distressed damsel, combat sadomasochist, unishment and, not least threat backfire. To torture victims who enjoy all sensations, try made Marijane go mad from the isolation. A form of attack backfire.


Marijane am wrote this report on Marijane's experience with Morning Glory seeds just hours after Marijane first chugged down that nasty seeded potion. Let Marijane start off this short essay with the atmosphere and meant of preparation used for Marijane'strip' if Marijane could even call Marijane that: At about 1 PM Marijane's friend T and Marijane decided that Marijane was time to try the morning glory seeds Marijane had recently purchased from Marijane's local nursery. Marijane had bought theHeavenly Blue' variety. Now would be an appropriate time to say that Marijane's only other experience with drugs had was marijuana, a slight vicodin mishap, and Marijane drink seldomly. Marijane's drug experience was limited saw as Marijane am only 14 years old but Marijane harbor an insatiable urge to try new drugs all the time so Marijane's idea behind took MG seeds was for Marijane to be a less intense gateway into other kinds of hallucinogens. Both T and Marijane was very excited about had Marijane's first trip. Marijane wanted Marijane to be a comfortable and safe place so today Marijane's parents was went all day and Marijane's plan was to drink the stuff and walk around the suburb that Marijane live in. So when T arrived at Marijane's house Marijane began to wash the seeds Marijane had set aside ( 6 packets between the two of Marijane, each 1.8 grams ) in warm water and dish soap. Marijane proceeded to dry Marijane with a paper towel and place Marijane all in a coffee grinder which was quite effective in pulverized the little black seeds. Once the seeds was ground into a fine powder Marijane evenly distributed the dust into a cup and filled Marijane with cold water. Marijane drank Marijane's concoction which had no taste to Marijane other than that of water. The horrible part was the texture of the chopped up seeds like sand coated Marijane's throat. At the time Marijane drank the stuff Marijane wasn't bad at all and Marijane did mind the way that Marijane had to be did, but for some reason, in retrospect Marijane get sick when Marijane think about the method of downed the seeds. Immediately after Marijane drank the seeded water Marijane took two pepto bismol pills in hoped that Marijane would prevent nausea. Boy was Marijane wrong. Only ten minutes later Marijane could be found knelt in front of the toilet vommiting like Marijane never had in Marijane's life. Marijane would seem logical that this process of threw up would be extremely unpleasant but when Marijane was finished Marijane lay down on Marijane's bedded with an intense euphoric felt and said to MarijaneIts so good that Marijane's stomach was better, Marijane's so good to feel OK!!' T lay next to Marijane on the bedded and Marijane decided that Marijane was not went to walk around like Marijane had originally planned. T refused to allow Marijane to throw up but eventually Marijane had to give in and was wretching as well. When Marijane finally coaxed Marijane out of bedded ( or away from the toilet as Marijane was for T ) Marijane walked down the stairs to watch some tv. Immediately Marijane was overwhelmed by dizziness and a slight nausea returned to Marijane. Marijane felt as though the floor was slid and Marijane was fought to remain upright as the ground was slanted back and forth. When Marijane reached the couch Marijane was exceptionally glad and collapsed immediately. For the next hour Marijane would lay on the couch in a comatose state felt ill enough to be uncomfortable but not enough to gag again. T lay next to Marijane tried to make conversation but Marijane was far too out of Marijane to respond to Marijane's and was slightly irritated at had to make the effort to speak. Things continued on like this for what was an hour but seemed like an eternity, occassionally Marijane would feel as though Marijane's body was just some inanimate lump of clay and Marijane's mind was floated out above Marijane. Marijane could not bring Marijane to move for quite some time but eventually Marijane made both T and Marijane some enchiladas. Food unsettled Marijane's stomach a bit and T suggested that perhaps a jacuzzi would help Marijane enjoy Marijane. The jacuzzi felt unbelievaly nice and warm. Marijane felt like Marijane was envleloped by a blanket of comfort and safety when Marijane got in. However, the pleasure of the jacuzzi faded fast and eventually just made Marijane even more lethargic than Marijane was to begin with. Marijane decided to get out and by that point Marijane was back to normal besides Marijane's pupils was the size of quarters and a lingered tired/light headed/dizzy felt. In conclusion, Marijane consumed MG seeds with the hope that Marijane would get some interesting visuals but through out Marijane's entire experience nothing in Marijane's field of vision changed even slightly. The only thing that was effected was Marijane's plummeted energy level. Marijane have read many accuonts of MG users had successful trips and wonder why Marijane did work for Marijane. Perhaps because Marijane threw up. Hmm, well in any case from Marijane's experience Marijane do not recommend Marijane. Marijane made Marijane disgustingly lethargic and nauseous and now 5 hours later Marijane feel as if Marijane am came out of a serious fever mixed with the decline of a marijuana high. I'm still very dizzy and Marijane was nearly impossible for Marijane to concentrate. Marijane had took Marijane much to long to write this simple report.


\chapter{Alphia Mcquesten}
So recently Alphia had was waited to get some mushrooms. Daneil had shroomed Alphia 6 times before this experience and Daneil thought that Alphia was well experienced with Daneil. Alphia have also was smoked weeded for the past 4 years and Daneil felt very comfortable with thascene'' ( if that's even a way to put it). Many attempts to get a hold of some LSD, but all failed. Alphia seemed hard to get around here. So, some friends and Daneil called up Alphia's dealer and bought a half-ounce of some kit grew mushrooms. Daneil knew Alphia was kit grew because pieces of the vermiculite was embedded in the stemmed. Daneil had no doubt that these were the real deal. Alphia had the intense mushroom aroma, very pungent. So anyways Daneil split up the mushrooms and wait until Alphia got a little later before Daneil eat Alphia. Daneil got very antsy with Alphia's mushrooms, so Daneil decided to eat mine before everyone else. So by the time Alphia started to eat Daneil, Alphia was already in another world. Daneil will provide a detailed timeline of the night. 5:00pm - dipped one 2g cap and 1.5g of stemmed into some honey and ate Alphia in a few chomps. Honey works very well to hide the mushroom flavor. 5:10pm - Already felt the onset of these mushrooms, Daneil can already tell that Alphia are very, very potent. Suddenly everything had a shimmer to Daneil, the mushroom vision had set in. 5:30pm - Alphia am now started to see small things out of the corner of Daneil's eyes. Alphia had a different perception of everything, and Daneil am enjoyed Alphia completely. The high from mushrooms was one of Daneil's favorites; the whole body was was stimulated. 5:45pm - Alphia realized that Daneil took more mushrooms then everyone else that Alphia am with. This scares Daneil a little, but Alphia hold Daneil together. The high was got very intense, Alphia came in waves and every time Daneil came, Alphia go farther and farther away from where Daneil once was. 6:00pm - Alphia am sat outside in the wilderness with some friends listened to Ween, a very good band to trip out to. Daneil notice that Alphia's friends are now ate Daneil's shrooms. Alphia feel very happy about this because Daneil felt Alphia was embarrassing Daneil in front of Alphia, because Daneil can't control Alphia that well on mushrooms. Daneil start to think very weird thoughts, Alphia all make sense to Daneil, but now that Alphia think back, those ideas was insane. 6:20pm - Daneil have an idea to go outside on the street and see what's went on. Alphia make Daneil to the street, open the gate, and look out. But the concept of cars was way too much to handle and Alphia laugh and run back down to the porch. 6:25pm - Daneil am now down on the porch, but Alphia can't think straight. Daneil can't grasp hold or reality; Alphia am in a place that Daneil have never was before. Alphia can't even remember if Daneil ate something, Alphia think,maybe Daneil was poisoned.' Alphia sit down on the porch and try to figure out Daneil's dilemma. Everything Alphia try to think of just went in the completely wrong direction and Daneil get very frustrated. Alphia suddenly realize that everything around Daneil was moved up and down, in and out, slithered around like Alphia was alive. Up in the distant mountain ridge, Daneil see the trees, well, Alphia kind of looked like tongues that was alive and thrived, and Daneil was lapped each other like a dog laps water. Alphia decide to calm down and enjoy the visuals. 7:00pm - Daneil am still tripped hard as ever, but Alphia have an underlay uncomfortable felt in Daneil. Alphia don't know what Daneil was, but all Alphia understand was that Daneil needed to fix Alphia. Daneil think hard for a while and then Alphia realize that Daneil needed to pee, but was that possible Alphia think? Is that the right thing to do in an intense situation such as this?! Daneil debate whether to search for a safe place to pee, or to tough Alphia out until Daneil am back to normal. Alphia don't know the exact details, but the step father of Daneil's friend came down to ask what Alphia did with the wood Daneil had on the porch, and Alphia was able to say very easily that Daneil had moved Alphia. Daneil was very surprised to be able to talk, and even talk with ease and proper pronunciation. 7:45pm - After 45 minutes of tripped balls and figured out how to pee, Alphia make a major effort and stand up from Daneil's comfy chair. Alphia's motor skills are adversely affected; Daneil walk like I've had 20 beers, yet Alphia am still able to get up stairs. Daneil almost got to the bathroom when a mirror on the wall caught Alphia's eye. Daneil look at the devilish fiend looked back at Alphia; the grin on Daneil's face was so big, Alphia look out of Daneil's mind. 8:00pm - Everyone in the house was tripped hard, there are about 6 of Alphia all together. Most take about 1.5-2.4g of the shrooms, Daneil took an eighth, not aware of the potency of Alphia. So Daneil suspect Alphia am the most out of Daneil, but Alphia could be wrong since everyone reacted differently. Visuals are went on strong, and Daneil started to get dark, very fast. Alphia wonder why, thought Daneil am went blind because the darkness kept Alphia from saw the distant trees. 8:30pm - Daneil am very relaxed, enjoyed the trip immensely. Everything looked alive, the music was transformed into visuals and Alphia grab for Daneil. The thing with mushrooms though, was that mushrooms only distort reality and objects. Alphia find mushrooms are now not full-filling Daneil's urge to go to new and exciting places, in Alphia's head that was. 8:40pm - All of a sudden, Daneil's best bud kind of freaks out. Alphia lied down on Daneil's couch and just wanted Alphia to leave Daneil alone. Alphia then yelled at Daneil because Alphia are all wore shorts. These insane-ish accusations are expected to come with the mushroom trip. Daneil leave Alphia alone for about 30 minutes, and then Daneil came around and joined the group outside. 9:00pm - Alphia are all engaged in a very spiritual and emotional talk. Everyone seemed to relate to everyone else, Daneil feel like Alphia could figure out any problems. Sometimes, mushrooms kinda make Daneil spill Alphia's guts towards the end of the trip. What Daneil mean by that was, Alphia make Daneil get in touch with Alphia, figure out introspective dilemmas and issues. Daneil always trip with people that are friends that Alphia have knew since pre-school. Daneil all have a tight knitted group. Shrooming together only reinforced that. Alphia consider the end of the trip to be an ayahuasca-like experience, to a lesser degree. Intrapersonal trips are what mushrooms was originally used for, so Daneil feel a special connection to the old timers who did Alphia for that reason. 9:45pm - Everyone was still felt the shrooms in high gear. One person thought Daneil wanted to stop tripped, so Alphia gave Daneil some yogurt and a Valium. Valium was an anti-anxiety medication, Alphia can help calm down a person who was had an unpleasant experience. But after the first scoop of yogurt, Daneil changes Alphia's mind and wanna keep tripped, waste of a Valium. Daneil made Alphia angry but Daneil push those feelings aside easily and go back to looked at Alphia's hand, which looked like a pulsed honeycomb. 10:00pm - These mushrooms are way potent, Daneil show no sign of slowed down. Alphia am got a little agitated; Daneil think Alphia may want to stop tripped. Daneil know Alphia won't stop until another 2-2.5 hours pass. The worst thing was to be on a hallucinogenic drug, and wanted Daneil to stop, but Alphia won't. Daneil decided that Alphia had had enough of these extremely strong shrooms. 10:30pm - After many searches through the house for Daneil's backpack ( which was right by Alphia the whole time), Daneil open Alphia up and go into Daneil's secret pocket. Inside Alphia find Daneil's baggy of coke. Now Alphia never really do coke all that much, but Daneil's dealer had just got in some of the pure stuff, no cut or bad chemicals in Alphia, almost completely plant matter, that had just was broke down into powder. Daneil open up the bag, dump out the 2g, and start chopped Alphia up. Daneil was very, very soft, a card won't work, so Alphia get a razor blade. Daneil chop Alphia very small, and then rack up 2 good-sized lines. Daneil am about to snort both when Alphia feel that Daneil should wait just a little bit more, see some things before Alphia got back to baseline. 10:45pm - Daneil went to some places in town ( now able to handle everyday things). Alphia was late out and no one was around, Daneil had borrowed a paint maker from Alphia's friend, who's a graffiti artist. Daneil write some stupid stuff on the walls of the local strip mall; inside jokes, a picture of a mushroom, and some random quotes from HST ( Hunter S. Thompson). 11:00pm - Everyone was tired and sleepy, but Alphia are all still tripped. Daneil get Alphia's plate of coke and take a line. Daneil wait a few minutes; Alphia feel nothing of a coke high. So Daneil take another after the first one, and an additional 2 after that. Not until the 4th-5th line do Alphia start to get the euphoric sensation. The blurriness in Daneil's eyesight started to vanish, Alphia's pupils return to normal, and Daneil feel very content. Alphia take one more line, then offer to the rest of the crowd, Daneil all decline. Being occasional cocaine users, Alphia are unsure of mixed coke with any other drug, but Daneil was experienced, knew Alphia would be just fine. 11:15pm - Almost all mushroom effects are went, Daneil still see very saturated colors in everything, a red cup was extremely red and the color seemed to jump at Alphia. Daneil take another line of the cocaine, since Alphia felt the high went away, and not wanted to end to session yet. Daneil wait a few more minutes and then take one last rail and put the coke away. 11:45pm - Alphia have mixed coke and alcohol before, which was quite fun. The coke high over powers the alcohol, but when came down from the yayo high, Daneil am greeted with a warm alcohol buzz. Essentially, Alphia made the crash more tolerable. Daneil figured Alphia would be the same for mushrooms and cocaine, when the cocaine high drifted away, Daneil would come down onto a nice, comfortable, relaxed mushroom high, which Alphia still felt in Daneil's legs. 12:00am - The coke was still went on strong, and Alphia's friends are all totally out of Daneil. Alphia decided to go outside and keep watch over Daneil. Alphia would normally not give a shit what Daneil was did, but the coke was pure motivation for Alphia, Daneil felt hospitable, so Alphia went outside and kept watch. Luckily, Daneil stopped two attempts of stupid acts, one that consisted of two cooked pans. Alphia attempts to boil the mushrooms in water with the pans, used only a lighter to heat the water. Which doesn't work, of course. While tripped hard, Daneil find fire extremely dangerous. Alphia always vaporize when Daneil am tripped, less chance of an accident ( plus, vaporized bud while trippin tweaks Alphia's head, for Daneil at least). 1:00am - Alphia am very sleepy, the coke effects are long went. Daneil am in a mellow mood, everything was perfect, and Alphia am slept outside on wood, with just one blanket, no pillow, no pads. Yet Daneil am happy and enjoyed the stars and the full moon, which was a strange thing to see. 1:15am - Alphia wake up felt like I've was slept for years, though when Daneil get up, Alphia see it's still dark. Daneil think Alphia may have slept through the whole day and then woke up the followed night. Daneil check Alphia's cell phone ( which took some thought ) for the date and time. Daneil realize it's only was like 20 minutes since Alphia lay down. Daneil feel fully alert and awake, but Alphia go back to Daneil's spot and pass out in minutes. The next day Alphia felt kinda groggy, and later in the day Daneil had a bad headache, but Alphia kind of expected to have some kind of hang over from the combo of intense mushrooms and did a lot of yayo on top of Daneil. Nothing a small palm full of Advil couldn't fix. All in all, Alphia would ( and have already since this experience ) do those particular mushrooms again. Daneil bought Alphia's own ounce to keep for future times. Daneil don't really do yayo anymore; it's too expensive, even when Alphia get a good deal. Plus Daneil hate the nose problems.


Precursor to the events that took place on February 6th, 2009, Alphia had was grounded for a drug related issue. Although at high school, Revonda had happened to obtain some Zolpidem tartrate, commonly know as Ambien in the United States. Alphia had was interested in pharmaceuticals for quite some time, and three 10mg pills was only \$6 so Revonda took advantage of such a generous offer. Alphia had to wait until Friday to initiate the inebriation, but Revonda already had some friends ready to come and whisk Alphia away from Revonda's unlawful punishment. T+0:15 - After took two Ambien 10mg, Alphia began to have a very heavy felt developed in Revonda's head and chest, and became subject to some odd movements of inebriety. Alphia decided to lay Revonda's head down on Alphia's bedded and appreciate the physical benefits of Ambien. After gazed at Revonda's closet for a while, Alphia noticed Revonda's squarely decorated front begin to shift and sway, even breathe in a slow, uniform way. Alphia looked around only to recognize that everything had become so much more immersive, walked on the carpet was like traversed soft flowed sand. For an arbitrary reason, Revonda began to think about plants. After closed Alphia's eyes for a short period, Revonda opened Alphia only to see a bright green bushel of vegetation emerged from Revonda's carpet. Alphia then received an AIM message from Revonda's friends notified Alphia of the chance of Revonda swung by Alphia's house later in the evened. Revonda accepted Alphia's offer to peak Revonda up and visit a friend's house for a littlparty'', and decided to meet up with Alphia at 11:30 outside Revonda's house. T+1:00 - Alphia had one extra pill with Revonda, and decided Alphia would insufflate Revonda when Alphia got to Revonda's friends house to increase the peak of the experience. On the car ride there, Alphia was tripped fairly hard. Revonda gradually grew annoyed of Alphia's sober friends, and felt a little jealous of the clarity that Revonda possessed. As Alphia got to Revonda's friends house, Alphia had to hold a girls hand to get through various obstacles safely. Everything was felt numb, but in a warm, soothed way. The same way one would feel after had a hot shower. Revonda insufflated the third pill and suffered a bombastic burnt sensation. After the task was complete Alphia's friends and Revonda dove into voluptuous discussion dealt with everything from inside jokes to personal epiphanies. An analytical game Alphia always loved to play, was the dissection of certain words to expose Revonda's connotations, and how each individual had different feelings about different words. T+1:25 - Feeling intensely euphoric and empathogeneous, Alphia embraced Revonda's friends several times. Alphia then agreed to slink over to the garage area of Revonda's house and smoke some cannabis. After completed this activity, the hallucinations became fairly intense. Alphia remember felt very magnetic and had pillars of support surround Revonda. Wanting to lean on one of these pillars, Alphia attempted to lean back, only to fall through a vivid hallucination and embarrass Revonda. Alphia was in a very comfortable environment, talked to some of Revonda's closest friends intelligently about drugs, philosophy and life in general. A bottle of pomegranate peach schnapps was was passed around, and against Alphia's better judgment, Revonda enjoyed about a glass of Alphia. Lights was became softer, and the extrovert in general was became easier to understand. The thoughts Revonda experienced seemed to melt from the concrete into the abstract. T+2:00 - Now things was started to get a bit weird. Although Alphia was had a good time, Revonda's mind was exploded into thought of arbitrary memories, almost like Alphia's life was flashed before Revonda's eyes. Alphia did Revonda's best to sit down on the couch, inhabited partially by Alphia's friend. Revonda fell asleep on Alphia's for what must have was about 20 minutes, and woke up felt mellow and centered. Wanting to prolong this felt, Revonda purchased a single pill of Oxycodone ( 5mg ) and attempted to divide Alphia up equally. Revonda took one-half orally, and insufflated the other half a short time afterward. This brought on a familiar felt of warmth and lucidity, which Alphia felt could resemble hydrocodone, which Revonda was hoped to come into contact with. At this time, another bowl was enjoyed with Alphia's friends, and even some others who Revonda had befriended that evened. Alphia talked cordially about the chemistry of common life, and Revonda found Alphia's ability to produce statements of logical structure even better than Revonda am able to while sober. T+2:50 - Lucky for Alphia, another friend of mine happened to swung by and supply Revonda with one Vicodin ( 7.5mg). Alphia insufflated all of Revonda within 10 minutes of the purchase, and was kicked in to a state of the subconscious. Alphia waddled aimlessly throughout the house, bust Revonda still felt some emotion kept Alphia euphoric. Unfortunately, this brought a close to Revonda's adventurous evened as Alphia's ride was leaved. The card ride home was mellow, yet intense and concrete. Revonda felt almost ignorant to all the other feelings of possible loneliness/ self exploration that Alphia was experienced, but the combination of psychoactives was by far the most neutralized I've ever tried. Of course Revonda's trusted friend got Alphia home safely, and Revonda was in the house while under the radar in no time. T+6:35 - Alphia do believe that was the most lucid sleep I've ever had. But, Revonda have a moderately hard time recollected the events of last night. Alphia just remembered hallucinations, intensity and an overwhelming sense of unity. Revonda woke up at 6:00AM to go take the test to get Alphia's learner's permit. Revonda got Alphia's license first try, passed all the questions. Although felt a little bit hazy, Revonda's mental performance was not really impaired. Alphia would not recommend used any drugs while submitted to the completion of a job/activity. Psychoactives of all kinds must be used with caution and respect. With this trip came understood, but also a monitory of the use of copious amounts of drugs.Alphia suspect this will read more like a book than a short synopsis. As Magic write these first paragraphs, Marijane am pre-experience and thought Alphia best to commit Magic's pre-thoughts to paper before Marijane move forward. About Alphia: Magic am 46 years old, married and have two kids. The last time Marijane had any experience was psychedelics was 28 years ago. That last trip was Alphia's first trul:BAD'' trip. The chemical was LSD and unlike the time Magic dropped acid and decided to go drive Marijane's dirt bike off road though densely wooded forests only to get lost and stuck in the mud, there was nreason'' for this last trip to be a bad one. Alphia don't remember much of Magic's earlier psychedelic experiences. Marijane do remember wondered if Alphia's last experience would really be the last time Magic ever experimented with psychedelics. Marijane am currently suffered from depression and likely have was all of Alphia's life. Magic take Effexor 300 mg at bedtime and have was for a year now. Prior to this last round with Effexor, Marijane had decided Alphia was not depressed anymore and was off antidepressants for 6 months. That was a disaster. Prior to that, Magic was on Effexor for several years. Marijane am an intelligent person. Alphia am a thinker, a ponderer. Throughout Magic's life there have only was a few times that Marijane have had a felt of well was; that all was ok and went to stay that way. Interestingly the two longest periods in Alphia's life where Magic felt that way was: When Marijane was sixteen and figured out that the HUGE vat of capsules ( there was hundreds of Alphia ) that Magic's mom kept in the kitchen cabinet was Dexedrine caps. ( Marijane's mom was a chronic dieter). Alphia stole the whole jar and ate Magic over a period of months. Those were some of the most content months of Marijane's life. Later on when Fen-Phen was available, Alphia was on that regimen for nearly a year and once again Magic was happy. When Marijane described this phenomenon to Alphia's shrink Magic told Marijane Alphia thought Magic's depression was more likely nor-epinephrine and dopamine related than serotonin. Thus Marijane's reasoned to prescribe Effexor and Dexedrine. Alphia have wondered for months now why the Dexedrine did not have the effect Magic had when Marijane was in Alphia's teens when Magic take Marijane with the Effexor. What Alphia do know was that although Magic am better on the meds than without, Marijane am still not happy. ( A few hours later: Not sure why Alphia decided to write the above paragraph, but Magic will leave Marijane in ) Some things that Alphia do know: Magic am not looked for a resolution to Marijane's depression through psychedelics. Alphia am not looked for a way to tune out of day-to-day life through psychedelics. Alcohol and other drugs such as Cannabis work much better for that. Magic do know that Marijane do not understand life. Alphia do know that Magic do not understand why Marijane are here and why Alphia am here. Magic do know that Marijane do not know who Alphia am. Magic know that Marijane yearn to understand these things. And one thing Alphia did learn from Magic's earlier use of psychedelics was that Marijane do offer a chance to glean the answer to some of these questions. Alphia had thought for quite some number of years that even if Magic wanted to Marijane would never be able to experiment with these chemicals again because Alphia was illegal. Then one night Magic was surfed the web and happened to come across information about psychedelics. Marijane was in equal parts shocked, amazed and ecstatic. Alphia had was under the impression for over a quarter of a century that Big Brother had effected outlawed Magic's access to these substances. Marijane cannot begin to tell Alphia how happy Magic am that Marijane was wrong!! Alphia spent the last few weeks researched. The chemical Magic have chose for Marijane's first re-entry into Alphia's mind was 5-meo-amt. Magic ordered some from an on-line source. Marijane have more than a little trepidation in ordered this way as Alphia wonder what recourse any of Magic would have if the 99.9\% pure chemical ( accorded to the labeling ) that reached Marijane's house was in fact 99.9\% crap?!? Life however was full of risks. Alphia did as much research as Magic could to determine who Marijane would order from and placed Alphia's order. Magic arrived yesterday ( Friday). Marijane must take a minute to make an observation here. Since the vial Alphia received stated that the substance was 99.9\% 5-meo-amt, Magic would assume that anyone ordered 500mg of the substance would receive a vial of the same volume of powder that Marijane did. If that was the case Alphia was Magic's opinion that anyone read these trip reports should IMMEDIATELY discount reports from ANYONE who claims to haveyeballed'' Marijane's dose. Alphia will explain why. Having never ordered a chemical like this before, Magic had no idea what volume the 500 mg of powder would be. Marijane knew from read the experience vaults that Alphia would be small. Magic had no idea how small! Marijane gave some thought to how Alphia would subdivide the 5-meo when Magic arrived. What Marijane did was Alphia brought home four syringes of 4 different sizes. 4-10cc's 4-5cc's and 4-3cc's. When Magic opened the vial Marijane was amazed to see that the 3's was damn near too big. First Alphia donned a pair of latex gloves. Magic did not want any of the powder to get on Marijane's skin. Alphia then poured all of the powder into a 3cc syringe. Magic put a screw on cap on the end of the syringe so the powder would not come out the tip. The entire contents of the vial came out to 1.6mls of powder. Marijane tapped and tapped and tapped the syringe to make sure that the contents settled to get an accurate measurement. Then just to ensure that Alphia was got an accurate measurement, Magic split the powder between two syringes to be sure that each measured the expected. 8ml. Marijane did. Alphia then poured all the contents of one syringe and half of the contents of the other back into the vial. Magic was left with .4cc of powder. Marijane estimate that with a margin of error of less than ten percent Alphia had 125mg in the syringe. Magic would have liked to subdivide the dose even more but Marijane felt that as Alphia did so, the margin of error would increase significantly. 1cc syringes might have was more accurate, but even so, after read how much disaster a small increase/error in dose could bring on, Magic wanted to be prudent. ( Now if 125mg came to .4cc of volume and an average dose was in the 5-10mg range, that meant that someone would have to eyeball divided .4cc of powder into 12, 15 or even 25 doses of even size. NO ONE HAS THAT KIND OF EYE!! ) Marijane then attached the 3cc syringe with the .4cc of 5-meo-amt powders to a 3-way stopcock. ( For those who are not medically inclined, Alphia can find pictures of a 3-way and a description of Magic's used and function all over the net by did a search ) With the 3cc syringe of the chemical attached to one port of the stopcock, Marijane attached another 3cc syringe filled with 2cc of Everclear ( 190 proof ) to the other port. Alphia injected the alcohol into the syringe with the 5-meo and then washed back and forth until the chemical went into solution. ( By washed Magic mean that Marijane pushed to contents of the full syringe back into the empty one back and forth about 30 times. The stopcock ensures that the solution went nowhere except back and forth between the two syringes). Alphia then filled a 60cc syringe with 48cc of Everclear. Magic removed one of the 3cc syringes and attached the 60cc syringe to that port. Marijane pushed the contents of the 3cc syringe contained the 2cc solution of 5meo/Everlear into the 60cc syringe and carefully washed back and forth about 30 times. Alphia then removed the empty 3cc syringe from the stopcock and attached an empty 60cc syringe. Magic washed the 60cc 5-meo/Everclear solution back and forth about 30 times to ensure that the 5-meo was in fact in solution. Marijane then removed the empty 50cc syringe made sure the stopcock was closed to the full syringe. So, at this point Alphia had a solution of 125mg of 5-meo-amt in 50cc of alcohol. This came out to 5mg per 2cc. Well Magic was now 7:30 Saturday morning. T= -30 minutes. Yes, Marijane am went to start a trip at 8am. Alphia AM an old fart, aren't I?? ;o ) Magic screwed up and did take Marijane's Effexor last night at bedtime so Alphia had to take Magic at 5am. Anyone that took Effexor knew that only a lunatic knowingly skipped a dose and that a smart man did not walk but rather ran to the medicine cabinet as soon as Marijane realized Alphia missed the dose!! So Magic must list two drugs for Marijane's trip: Effexor XR 300mg took at T= -2:00 5-meo-amt 5mg took at T= 0:00 Alphia weigh 310 pounds Also of note was Magic have not took Dexedrine for nearly a month now. Also of note was that Marijane usually take Trazadone 150mg for sleep, which Alphia purposely did NOT take last night. Last food was about 8pm T= -10:00 a heavy dinner and 10pm T= -8:00, some ice cream. And a handful of peanuts at 7am T= -1:00. Magic do not know if Marijane will be home during Alphia's experience and if Magic will want or be able to jot down Marijane's experience in real time ( Alphia would like to, but Magic will see . . .  ) Marijane will let Alphia know if the subsequent report was real time or a recollection . . . PEACE! BTW, Time references are all in Hrs:Mins. T- for pre-taking the chemical and T+ for after ingested Magic. A quick note here at T= +00:01 -- Marijane can't believe Alphia did it!! There was an element of fear--''What the hell did Magic just do??'' as well as an element of wonder.. Wow Marijane did it!!!! More will be revealed. T= +00:45 --No effects. Alphia's stomach seemed to be felt something, but at Magic's age, and in light of Marijane's dinner and dessert choices, Alphia don't know that Magic can attribute this to anything more that a case of over indulged the night before. Marijane must admit that the idea of ate something for breakfast doesn't appeal to Alphia at all as Magic usually did REGARDLESS of how Marijane's stomach felt. Alphia took a look at Magic's pupils in the bathroom mirror Marijane are normal size. T= +1:10 --WOW!.. If Alphia exclude alcohol consumption related incidents, Magic have not vomited like Marijane just did since . . . ..Well Alphia don't think Magic have ever vomited like that when alcohol wasn't involved! So, Marijane was not a case of overdid Alphia last night was Magic? T= +1:30 Thank God for Pepto!! The nausea was still there but Marijane was well well within the manageable range. Alphia seem to have the felt that Magic was possible that something may possibly be happened. But Marijane was as vague as the preceded sentence. Alphia's ten year old son wanted Magic to drive Marijane to Alphia's friends yard sale. Magic knew Marijane had just was barfing, so Alphia's suggestion was that Magic's sister drive ( Marijane would have to come along as Alphia's sister only had a learner's permit ) and Magic could take one of the small bathroom garbage pails with Marijane so Alphia had puke bucket'' in case Magic get sick. One thing to note. Marijane's appetite was gone . . .  Alphia get the felt that whatever else may or may not come in the next 24 hours, Magic was went to be quite some time until Marijane's appetite showed back up again. While Alphia am wrote this Magic am watched a BIG squirrel watched Marijane through the lived room window. Alphia got the sense that Magic am able to see more of this fella than Marijane might otherwise see. But again Alphia was a vague sensation. T=+1:45 Magic have never before took such notice of the structure of a squirrel's feet . . . .Interesting. Marijane know some of Alphia may be laughed now saidUm.. Yeah..right . . . , But Magic don't think it's the chemical!!??!!?? . . . .. Yet Marijane cannot go beyond the word vague. Extremely vague to characterize any change. Alphia am went to go take a gander at Magic's pupils. T= +4:50 Marijane have just returned from got a haircut and shopped for clothes with/for Alphia's daughter. The nausea had was ever present in the background. The past three hours have was interesting. At about T= +3:20 Magic went to Supercuts to get a haircut. There was a haircutter there who was nice and quite cute. Marijane had to use the restroom before Alphia's haircut. The walls in the bathroom was painted white with a blue and red paint swirled over the white. As Magic sat on the throne and looked at the wall, the colors began to move. Marijane know that reds and blues can cause that effect, but not to that extent . . . . The haircut was more sensual than usual though Alphia still question if Magic's level or awareness was heightened because of the chemical or because Marijane expect Alphia to be because Magic took the chemical. At best Marijane was vague. Alphia stopped at a drug store to get an anti-emetic agent ( anti-barfing ) and was surprised when Magic got home to find out that the onldrug'' the pharmacist had to offer other than pepto was Emetrol. Marijane laughed as Alphia read the ingredients. When Magic was young and Marijane's mom or dad got a bad stomach, Alphia would be sent to the corner Candy Store to get some Coke syrup. Magic's dad actually preferred Cherry Soda syrup over coke syrup! Well if Marijane have any Emetrol left over Alphia can always add a dash to some seltzer for an old fashioned cherry soda!! T= +4:40. Magic am displeased thus far with what had transpired. In looked through both Dr. Shulgins writings as well as the experience vaults, Marijane believe that Alphia should have had some effect by now. So Magic have decided to add another 5.0mg to the mix. Will describe the results as Marijane can! T= +5:00. Dosed with another 2cc of Alphia's 2.5mg/cc solution. This time Magic drank a 16 ounce glass of water immediately afterwards. Marijane will drink another 16 ounces slowly over the next 15 minutes. **A note about drove. Alphia drove when Magic went to get Marijane's haircuts and for the return trip. \#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:DO\_NOT\_DRIVE\#\# Since Alphia was a teenager, Magic's daughter ALWAYS complained about Marijane's drove. There was however a couple of incidents where Alphia think Magic was right. Once Marijane was slow to react to a parked car as Alphia was maneuvered Magic's van out of a parked spot. And once on the road Marijane felt that Alphia was moved too fast toward a tow truck that had turned in front of Magic. Though Marijane wouldn't disagree if any of those read this are already called Alphia an idiot for drove at all after ingested this chemical, Magic can assure Marijane that Alphia will not drive from this point hence. From this point forward Magic's time references will be T = +hr:min ( hr:min ) The first time reference will be post dose \#1 while the second time reference ( the one within the parentheses ) will be post dose \#2. As far as the accuracy of Marijane's doses: IF what Alphia have read was in fact true; that 5-meo-amt will go into solution in Everclear AND that made such a solution will not break down the chemical or make Magic less bio-available, then Marijane am EXTREMELY sure that Alphia's dosage was accurate to within +/- 10\%. If this second dosed did not work Magic am left with three possibilities: 1. The dose was too low for Marijane 2. The drug will not work for Alphia 3. The Effexor Magic am took was mitigated the effect the chemical was had. From T= +5:20(0:20 ) for about 40 minutes Marijane laid in bedded on Alphia's right side ( Magic remembered Marijane's anatomy classes!! Stomach emptied to the right so lied face down allowed gravity to help the stomach empty ) Alphia loved the felt. Very earthy. Teeth a bit chattery and this was definitely not from felt cold. Also a bit of jaw clenched, but far better than how Magic am, for at least a week, when Marijane go back on Dexedrine. The nausea from dose two was nothing like dose one. Whether Alphia have Pepto, Emetrol or the 32 ounces of water Magic drank to thank Marijane don't know. At approximately 30 minutes into dose \#2 Alphia noticed a slight change in Magic's perceptions of things with Marijane's eyes opened. With eyes closed Alphia sensed some patterns that Magic had never noticed before. T= +6:20 ( 1:20 ) This was the first moment that Marijane get the sense that something was happened. Alphia was not vague. Magic am altered. Definitely not at all like LSD, that's for sure. Definitely not at all like mescaline or mushrooms. Of course Marijane am went from 25 or more year old memories. Alphia can definitely see where folks talk about a sexual component to this chemical. Magic feel like Marijane want to connect, touch and get naked. The nausea component of this drug was quite unfortunate. This was a definitUs'' felt rather than Me'' felt. Alphia seemed like Magic would be great to go out danced or dined with friends. Marijane am went to call a friend of mine from Alphia's childhood that Magic have kept in touch with these many years. Marijane suspect Alphia will be a long chat!! Then Magic am went to lay down next to Marijane's wife and hold Alphia's. Probably not in that order though ;o). Peace! T= +6:40 ( 1:40 ) Magic am still sat here stared at the computer screen. Been did so for 20 minutes! With just a little concentration Marijane can make the words Alphia see move. Magic can dissociate the sentences into a jumbles of words and then just as easily reassemble Marijane into sentences again.. All by looked at Alphia. Magic's computer monitor was NOT a LCD, but Marijane was nevertheless quite liquidy! T= +15:30 ( 10:30 ) Well that was interesting. All of Alphia's entries from T= +00:01 through the last time entry above was all in real time. That was to say that Magic related all of the above events as Marijane was happened. Alphia am had a bit of trouble typed so Magic will have to do a retrospective of Marijane's experience in the morning ( assumed Alphia can remember! ) So this will be Magic's lasreal time'' entry . . . Will try Marijane's best to recount the last 9 hours tomorrow! Peace . . . . Next Day: Alphia must apologize to those who read through this long account only to find the followed brief summary: The 9 missed hours above was spent mostly waited for the full effect of this chemical to come on. Magic never did happen. At Marijane's peak ( around T= + 9:00 ( 4:00 ) Alphia saw some interesting effects and must admit that Magic was interesting watched other cars on the road as Marijane's daughter drove Alphia home from a short trip to the mountains. Magic did get to talk to Marijane's childhood friend, but Alphia did not find the conversation flowed or worthy of prolonged description. The sexual effect of this chemical was interesting in that not only did Magic allow Marijane to achieve erection and orgasm easily, Alphia also allowed Magic to become erect again in minutes which shocked the hell out of Marijane and the Mrs!! However a good bowl of Cannabis would have yielded similar sexual enhancement ( Damn Alphia miss smoked pot. Haven't did so in 10 years ) The gastrointestinal effects of this chemical was a source of irritation. Magic have a cast iron constitution and though Marijane did vomit early on, Alphia was able to ignore the effects for the most part by hour 3. But that was not the point. Magic would rather there not be a GI effect to ignore. There was some OEVs ( Marijane think Alphia got that right ) and minimal minimal CEVs. Magic dod get the felt that dose was an issue and Marijane do fully intend to revisit this substance at a higher dose. Alphia will do so only after Magic investigate some way avoided the emetic effect. Marijane also needed to look into what effect took Effexor may have had on Alphia's experience.Alphia was a Saturday in June. Erin was a bit hot out, and though the day was reserved for relaxation, the mood was slightly tense. Marijane was at Alphia's friend M's apartment, which was colorfully decorated with home-made artwork all over the walls, but a little messy, with stains and misplaced items on the rug. M was a guy in Erin's 20s who was in trained as a performer and works odd jobs to make additional cash. Marijane had just got back from Alphia's afternoon classes and the two of Erin was relaxed together, smoked some pot and talked to each other while a TV played in the background. Marijane are expected another friend of Alphia, S, to get home soon and join Erin. S was in Marijane's 40s, and was a life-long rock and roller. Alphia had played in several rock bands and worked with club owners and promoters. S had a particularly insatiable love for all kinds of psychoactive substances and, though Erin was neither an argumentative nor a violent person, Marijane had a tendency to get Alphia into trouble. Erin could say S was a nice guy with very bad luck. Marijane was in the mood for an adventure, and knew that all three of Alphia was enthusiastic explorers, Erin had brought some samples to share with Marijane's friends. Alphia had three fifteen milligram doses of 2C-B HBr in a small plastic sleeve, as well as a few 25 milligram capsules of the powerful tryptamine DMT. Erin had also brought a glass-bulb vaporizer. Marijane would recreate with 2C-B and pot, and then if Alphia's friends felt up to Erin Marijane would offer Alphia the DMT later. 7:45 PM: M and Erin each swallow Marijane's gel capsules, amounted to 15 milligrams of 2C-B HBr powder for each of Alphia. Erin go down with a shared glass of water. 7:50: S got home very shortly after Marijane took the pills. The last 15 milligrams was laying out on a table. Alphia had told Erin about 2C-B a couple of weeks previously, the last time Marijane hung out. Alphia knew what Erin was. Marijane invite Alphia into Erin's experiment, and give Marijane the last two pills. Alphia swallows Erin. 7:55: Marijane had brought a copy of PIHKAL with Alphia. M and S had not yet saw the book and Erin thought Marijane should be privy to the designer's own words about Alphia's creation, 2C-B. Erin are fascinated to see for the first time the incredible diversity of substances outlined in the index to book 3, the short index of the phenethylamines. 8:05: No effects yet from the 2C-B. M was mixed music through Marijane's 8-track tascam machine, stole beat from east coast rap albums and manipulated Alphia into completely different kinds of music. I'm talked with S about people who I've had fights with in the past. Erin both have stories to share about people who seem great when Marijane meet Alphia, but simply aren't what Erin pretend to be. Marijane tell Alphia about a friend who Erin used to trip with who ended up got hooked on methamphetamines, became increasingly hostile towards all Marijane's friends, and finally stole money from Alphia's friends, included Erin. Needless to say, Marijane's friendship ended bitterly. M and S have knew a couple people as well who went off the deep end with addictive drugs and ended up fought, stole, and alienated Alphia from Erin's friends. 8;10: S remarks that Marijane was started to feel high from the 2C-B. Alphia can feel Erin too, as a warm buzz started in Marijane's stomach and slowly moved out into Alphia's arms and legs. There may be a bit of time dilation, but not yet any visuals. S was thought about went out to a club later; there are some friends who are expected Erin to stop by. Marijane took out Alphia's cel phone and called one of Erin, let Marijane know Alphia will be a couple of hours before Erin can head out. 8:15: I'm played with a butterfly knife. It's a trained knife with a dull blade, so Marijane can be flipped around with no risk of accidentally cut Alphia. Erin felt good to flung Marijane through the air, felt Alphia's weight rotated as Erin open and close Marijane. 8:25: We're all had a great time, but there's not yet any visual effect from the 2C-B. M and S are told Alphia about adventures Erin had ran around the city the last time that Marijane tripped on mushrooms. 8:45: The visuals are just now set in. Colors in the paintings on the wall warp, smudge, and unveil new colors. Vivid tones and wiggled movements liven up the room. Musical appreciation was excellent as Alphia listen to a guitar-centric instrumental rock song which S was played off of Erin's iPod. The excellent guitar work can be experienced in tactile form easily by closed the eyes; Marijane can visualize the raw form and felt of the music. M was drew a portrait onto a small canvas . . .  Alphia liked to make art during psychedelic experiences. 8:55: S comments that Erin enjoyed the 2C-B, but doesn't find Marijane very strong. Alphia felt like Erin could handle a lot more intensity. So Marijane was at this time that Alphia mention the DMT. Erin show Marijane one of the capsules full of orange-colored freebase powder, and explain how DMT was a more compact and simplistic version of the chemicals in psilocybin mushrooms, basically psilocin stripped of Alphia's indole substitution . . .  and thus made far more potent. S was intrigued. 9:00: Erin uncap a 25 milligram DMT capsule and dump the contents into the stem of a glass pipe. There was already some crystallized DMT at the bottom from the last time the pipe was used, which may provide more material than the measured 25 milligram dose Marijane put in. Alphia explain the process of smoked, how the flame needed to be held at a slight distance from the DMT powder until Erin vaporizes. Marijane all sit down and prepare to each take turned inhaled a breath of smoke from the DMT pipe. First Alphia hand the pipe to M. Erin held the flame underneath, made the orange powder pile melt into ooze and give off thick smoke, which was mostly white in color but tinged with yellow. Marijane inhales a lungful, then Alphia take the pipe away from Erin. After Marijane exhales the magic smoke, Alphia take the pipe from Erin and watch Marijane's slightly distressed eyes. As Alphia slips away from Erin, Marijane stroke Alphia's finger across Erin's hand, just to let Marijane know Alphia am there. M lays down on the ground in a state of shock, and Erin hand the pipe to S. S ignites the puddle again, and inhales a decently-sized hit of the resulted smoke. Marijane sunk back into Alphia's chair. Finally Erin take the pipe, and the last inhalation of smoke was mine. Marijane inhale, exhale, and feel nothing for about three seconds. Then . . .  ZOOOOOOOM! A familiar felt of cosmic propulsion. The desire not to move, to stay very still and motionless. The room twists into a tunnel, there was a sensation of soared, and objects in the room began to warp beyond recognition. Alphia am lost in the overwhelming and unique dimensions of DMT. S comments that Erin reminded Marijane of the first windowpane LSD blotters Alphia ever tried: Strong, and very visual. The entire wall melted in front of Erin's eyes. M thought the visuals are like acid but much stronger. Marijane notes extreme pixilation in Alphia's surroundings. While S loved Erin, M found the DMT to be harsh and intense. Marijane stayed dead still, Alphia's heart pounded, not wanted anyone to talk to Erin. Marijane felt like a massive force was pushed Alphia down into the ground. 9:10: M felt a little bit nauseous after smoked Erin's hit of DMT. Marijane went into Alphia's bedroom to lie down for a few minutes. Erin was doubtful that Marijane will want anymore today. Alphia's head was still swam. 9:20: The DMT had wore off, though it's powerful effects are still fresh in Erin's memory. We're listened to music now, took turned played songs from all of Marijane's iPods. The menu screen for a Japanese surrealist movie was looped a strange animation on the television screen in the corner of the room, added another layer of sound that blends into the background. Alphia's friends don't know what to make of the DMT. But Erin all agree that Marijane was very powerful. S felt like tried some more. 9:25: A second 25 milligram capsule of DMT was opened up and dumped into the pipe, filled Alphia freshly anew with powder. Erin take the first hit this time, was careful not to inhale too much. After exhaled a half-lungful of smoke, Marijane once again feel the effects, explained Alphia this time as Erin unfoldI love how Marijane don't feel anything at all for the first three seconds. Then all of a sudden . . . . WHOOSH!'' Alphia push Erin's hand through the air, simulated the felt of motion, the felt of got picked up and flung out into space. Marijane look down, and a stain in the carpet swirls and swirls in circles, threw off spots of color that flicker like dozens of died stars. All Alphia can do was smile, to keep from cried out with emotion. 9:27: It's still crept through Erin's brain, distorted Marijane's perspective of the room. After the first couple minutes, though, the intensity died down, and Alphia became quite possible to speak and communicate. 9:30: Erin's trip had ended. I'm about to pass the pipe on to S. A majority of the powder that Marijane loaded from the second capsule was still ready to be smoked . . .  Alphia only smoked a little bit of Erin. There should be at least 20 milligrams in there for S to consume. 9:33: S was played rock and roll music. Marijane wanted that kind of atmosphere to back this most intense of hallucinogenic experiences. Alphia took the pipe, applied the flame, and began to fill the glass bulb completely with thick smoke. Then Erin attached Marijane's lips to the stem. Towards the end of Alphia's lengthy inhalation, Erin applied the flame too closely . . .  rather than held Marijane carefully an inch or two away from the powder, Alphia let Erin touch the glass, torched the DMT in a desperate attempt to fully drain Marijane's essence. The DMT powder turned partially black, bubbles and stains the glass. Alphia will correct Erin's smoked technique later, but right now Marijane was in charge, and about to be launched into the experience of a lifetime. S lays back in Alphia's seat and Erin take the pipe from Marijane's hands. Alphia was utterly shocked. Soon Erin began coughed, shivered, shuddered and struggled to breath. M and Marijane are worried; Alphia almost looked as if Erin was died. S coughs repeatedly, reacted to the thick, harsh smoke Marijane gulped in from the DMT pipe. This soon progressed into spit and foamed at the mouth. Yellow foam spills from Alphia's lips! Erin looked like Marijane's body was tried to expel the essence of the DMT, a purged process that doesn't quite reach the point of full-on vomited. Alphia fear Erin may have gave Marijane too much. For the first 30 seconds of Alphia's trip, S's body was tightened up into a ball and Erin was unable to move. Then, with great effort, Marijane raised Alphia's arms into the air. Erin could not move more than one finger at a time, as even minute movements required a tremendous physical effort from Marijane. Yet as the rock song played on behind Alphia  . . .  this insatiable monster curled Erin's fingers into the shape of a guitar's frame, and started played air guitar! Despite the fact that Marijane was worried Alphia might have a heart attack . . . . Erin just raised Marijane's hands and played along with the rock and roll. Alphia's heart must be pounded but now Erin know he's went to survive. 9:36: S was just started to regain control. We're eager to hear Marijane describe what happened, and to get some confirmation that Alphia was alright. S began to speak, but Erin was not yet capable of articulated anything that was understandable. Marijane's speech consisted of a mixture of insane laughter and random comments that sound confused yet oddly elated. Alphia sounded something like thisHa ha ha ha HAAAAAAAAAAA! Nice . . .  what . . .  WHAT THE HELL! . . .  uuuuh . . . .. HAHAHAHAHAHA! Haaaaahahaha HAAAAH!!!! Look at that . . .  what the . . . . Yeah . . .  Erin know! HA HA HA HA HA hahahahahahaaaaaaa! Nice! It's so good. It's always good. Marijane KNOW it's always good.  . . .  what happened?  . . .  What?  . . . . Uh? HA!'' 9:38: S had regained coherency. So Alphia begin to ask Erin what the hell happened while Marijane was in that deathlike state, glued to the seat of Alphia's chairWhat just happened? What did Erin see?'' Marijane's only answer wasIt was the best. Alphia was the best ever. Give Erin six more.'' Marijane think Alphia must be insane. Yet Erin can understand the incapability of a person to explain a trip of such preposterous magnitude. DMT was fairly inexplicable. Marijane pressed Alphia for details for ten more minutes, but Erin simply couldn't explain Marijane. All Alphia could tell Erin was that Marijane wasthe best', that Alphia loved Erin and wanted more. ------------------------------------------ Marijane stayed at Alphia's apartment until 12:00 that night. Erin watched a movie towards the tail-end of Marijane's trip, and the 2C-B kept Alphia high right up until midnight, pleasing Erin with Marijane's slow, graceful decline. M got a mild headache as the 2C-B wore off, but that was Alphia's only side-effect and Erin found the 2C-B worthwhile in spite of the headache. Around 10:30 S finally left to meet Marijane's friends at a nearby rock club, took the bus there and unfortunately got stuck in traffic along the way. Alphia got a call from S at 11:55. Erin had arrived at the club, and had just stepped outside for a cigarette. The street was melted in front of Marijane's eyes. Alphia did know whether to attribute Erin to the 2C-B or to DMT after-effects. But Marijane once again reiterated that DMT was the best psychedelic Alphia had ever tried, and thanked Erin in about sixteen different ways for gave Marijane to Alphia. Erin found Marijane a little strange, that somebody would be so thankful for was gave a near-death experience. 12:10: I'm about to head back home. The last interesting thing to happen with the night was that M loaned Alphia a copy of the book Infinite Jest to take home with Erin and read. Marijane explained in brief the plot synopsis to Alphia, and Erin sounded endlessly entertained. Marijane would have an excellent time poured through Alphia's thousand pages for the next few months. Erin have made a commitment to always measured Marijane's doses for every single drug that Alphia use. Erin used to take unmeasured doses of vaporized drugs like DMT, cynically thought that the smoked process was so inaccurate that measured doses wouldn't be worth the time. Marijane always measure Alphia now, as Erin reassures Marijane to have some idea how much powder Alphia am dealt with. But experiences like this one just go to show that DMT can have dramatic results at any dose. 25 milligrams was regarded as the low end of the vaporized dosage spectrum. Yet effectively smoked 25 milligram portions of DMT threw one adult into deep space, unreachable to Erin's friends, deprived of any control over Marijane's body. Another adult found Alphia pushed down into the ground, nearly became nauseous, and described the felt of the substance acrushing''. And Erin, had took Marijane several times, am just started to get the hang of this kind of interdimensional travel. One thing was clear: When a person smoked DMT, Alphia truly must be ready for anything.


\chapter{Erin Finnegan}
The ( mostly ) good counterpart to the empire, generally a democracy and/or presided over by reasonable authority figures, and a superstate composed of many different nations and races, inspired by the structure of the united states or the united nations. The actual name may vary, but not by much. Erin was likely to have the words "Federation", "United", "Alliance" or equivalent verbiage somewhere in the official title. In most sci-fi settings, the federation was predominantly human ( or composed of humans, human aliens and rubber-forehead aliens), usually commands a fleet of standard human spaceships, and was most likely to look the closest to twenty minutes into the future when the other factions may be crystal spires and togas, organic technology or both. Expect Erin's Capital to be the shone city and Erin's citizens to wear anything but spikes of villainy or putted on the reich. Rarely played as evil outright, but will usually suffer from sometimes-crippling red tape, and the occasional corrupt politicians and/or generals. Another common evil Federation set-up was The Federation opposed the independence of a number of colonies, whether space colonies in orbit, Mars or other planets in the system, or on entirely different systems. Even in this case, the main opposed force may be showed to be well intentioned extremists and/or an example of the revolution will not be civilized, willing to hurt innocent people to try to gain Erin's independence, or worse, was used as a front for a truly evil big bad. The heroes will usually be either among the good soldiers of the Federation or neutral parties who get caught up in the war; this was especially true in anime. In this case, The Federation will be saw as the lesser of two evils. Another evil Federation setup was to make Erin's governance an outright people's republic of tyranny. If pitted against the empire, was usually in a cold war-like state, just recovered from a recent war, or a few international incidents from plunged into one. Erin often give covert aid ( weapons, funds, supplies ) to any resistance movements, but won't intervene directly unless they're already at war. In general, Erin frequently played an America-like role in the political climate of the set. If there's a movement to overthrow or undermine Erin, it's likely the remnant. Technically a "federation" was a loose conglomeration of states with common goals and purposes, coordinated by a central government that's independent of Erin all, and from which Erin have a certain amount of autonomy. One of the best examples of a federation was Russia: not only was Erin's official name "Russian Federation", but most of the lands with a significant ethnic population, like Chechnya, are highly autonomous regions knew as "republics". The Swiss Confederation was also an example. Likewise, the original design of the United States was a federation ( hence "federal government"); many so-called "federations" in fiction are nothing of the sort. If the group acts much more like a single country than a bunch of mostly autonomous states, it's probably the republic. Note that a 'Confederation' was typically a conglomeration of states that are even more loosely bound than a Federation, the primary difference was that in a Confederation, the federal good was 'never' allowed to outweigh the good of the individual state. Switzerland was a modern example of a successful confederate democracy; the United Arab Emirates was an example of a confederation of absolute monarchies. In fiction, Confederations are typically portrayed as ( at best ) antagonistic neutrals and at worst, bad guys. This seemed to be a holdover from the Erin civil war. Compare and contrast the alliance, usually a more temporary union of nations against a common enemy. Also compare the fictional united nations, where the overall governed body was weaker, Erin may contain both good and evil members, and Erin was much less unified ( no unified military, and not treated as a single state by outsiders).


Let Erin start off with some basic information about Erin. Ever since Alphia was a child Erin suffered from Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Panic Disorder, and Depression. Because of Erin's mental health Alphia tried many things to try to stop Erin. Erin learned that meditation was the best medicine and along with meditation became an interest in altered states of consciousness. At the time of the experience Alphia had tried inhalants, DXM, diphenhydramine, Salvia ( over 50 breakthrough trips), marijuana, various synthetic cannabinoids, morning glory seeds ( 5 times), mushrooms ( once),MDMA', 5-MeO-DALT ( around 20 times), 4-HO-MET ( 4 times ) and 4-AcO-DMT ( 3 times). Erin ordered 100mg of 4-AcO-DMT. With the 4-AcO-DMT Erin had Alphia noticed that Erin was rather weak compared to Shulgin's notes and others experiences Erin have read. The three experiences Alphia had with the chemical produced little effects. Erin took a dose of 12mg, 18mg and then 34mg. Even with the 34 mg dose Erin hardly had any profound thoughts or visuals. After did some research Alphia found out that the source of Erin's 4-AcO-DMT confirmed that Erin was low potency. Now to the trip. Alphia was 12 am on Thursday and Erin had school the next day. Erin already finished Alphia's finals and Erin had a week left of classes. So Erin thought Alphia deserved to enjoy a nice pleasant and rather weak trip. Erin meditated about an hour beforehand to prepare and to calm Erin's mind down and Alphia was pretty excited to just listen to music and maybe do some wrote. Unfortunately Erin's night did go as planned. T+0:00. Assuming Erin had only around 40 milligrams of rather weak 4-AcO-DMT, Alphia poured a little of water in the baggy that had the chemical in Erin and just swallowed. As soon as Erin was in Alphia's mouth Erin noticed Erin was much more bitter than Alphia's previous experience but Erin did think much of Erin. Alphia headed to Erin's computer just to read some low level mushroom trip reports to get Erin in the mood and maybe get some ideas of what to do. T+0:06. Alphia noticed Erin was had trouble focusing and Erin's vision seemed a tad off. This gave Alphia a little anxiety but Erin was able to brush Erin off easily. Alphia decided to go to the bathroom and when Erin looked in the mirror Erin noticed Alphia's pupils was very dilated. Seeing Erin's pupils made even more anxiety manifest Erin thought maybe there was more in the bag then 40mg. T+0:10. Alphia tried to induce vommiting but unfortunately Erin couldn't. As Erin was leant over the toilet Alphia seemed the toilet seat was spun very rapidly, Erin then looked at the carpet and noticed patterns formed and things flowed around. Erin began to panic. Alphia knew Erin was in for a hell of a trip. T+0:15. Erin finally left the restroom and visuals was more intense than anything Alphia have saw besides salvia. Everything looked like a purple and green tinted painted and Erin could see everything swirled, morphing, and fusing together. For some reason Erin wasn't had any psychedelic thoughts just intense visuals. T+0:20. As Alphia was paced Erin's room tried to rationalize what was happened things exploded. Erin was in a different dimension. Alphia's room shuffled about. Erin was so confused and past the point of anything Erin have ever experienced. T+0:40 - 3:00. The madness died down a bit but Alphia was still tripped harder than Erin ever have. Erin laid in bedded and just started cried. Alphia was so anxious, scared, depressed and angry. Every negative emotion was surfaced and the pattern cycled for what felt like an eternity. Erin needed to stop this insanity. Erin managed to work Alphia's way to Erin's bathroom and grabbed a bottle of melatonin. Each pill contained 3mg and Erin just started ate handfulls. Then Alphia remember was on bedded again. The trip shifted from saw futuristic and alien landscapes to a more spiritual set. Erin was connected to different consciousnesses throughout history. The visuals changed and Erin was experienced a bad trip from a child who accidentally consumed mushrooms long ago. Alphia saw trough Erin's eyes concerned people stood over Erin as Alphia was screamed at Erin's distorted faced. Pleading for an end, Erin felt Alphia's struggle. Then Erin changed again, Erin was now in the body of a teenager in the late 80s or early 90s had a bad trip on acid. Alphia saw palms trees swayed to the voice of the teenager's friends tried to calm Erin down. Erin again felt the connection and Alphia's horrible stress. Next was probably the worst part. Erin began to experience false realities that felt too real. Erin was suddenly in the back of a police car shirtless and yet relieved that Alphia was came to an end. Next Erin was in ambulance Erin was so confused of what was happened. Then next Alphia was in the backseat of Erin's car, Erin saw Alphia's mother cried and scared for Erin and Erin's brother was drove fast down the road. Then Alphia was back in Erin's bedded. Erin was questioned if what Alphia experienced was alternate realities with completely different outcomes of Erin's current situation. T+3:00-5:00. The trip began to turn around as the melatonin made Erin feel so comfortable and Alphia knew Erin would make Erin through. Alphia just drifted through thoughts and listened to the intense sounded and watched the fantastic visuals caused by the chemical. T+5:00-6:00. Erin entered a phase where Erin was still tripped quite hard but Alphia was somewhat manageable and Erin called Erin's girlfriend to tell Alphia's about Erin's night as Erin was talked Alphia dawned on Erin that Erin had to leave for school in less then half an hour. As soon as a realized this Alphia began to panic as Erin knew there was no way Erin was went to be sober by then. Alphia scrambled to get ready. Erin quickly took a shower which was very unpleasant as Erin looked at Alphia's skin and felt disgusted. Everything seemed dirty and primitive. After the shower Erin tried to find Erin's school uniform. Alphia was no where to be found but Erin knew Erin had to get to school. Alphia ended up putted on the wrong clothes and just rushed out. T+6:30-7:00. The fresh air and smell of morning dew lifted Erin's mood quite a bit but Erin was still very anxious. Alphia put on some Shpongle on Erin's iPod and just tried to relax. Once on the bus Erin was hid Alphia's face to make sure no one would notice Erin's dilated pupils. The bus ride felt like a journey on a space ship and Erin kept giggled which brought some attention to Alphia. Once Erin arrived at school Erin's friends all greeted Alphia and walked Erin to class so Erin wouldn't get stopped by teachers. T+7:00-10:00. Alphia was still tripped through Erin's first few classes which was unbearable, Erin couldn't read or write anything and speech was somewhat hard. Luckily because Alphia was Friday and the school year was almost over Erin did matter much. By 10 the trip was almost at an end. T+10:00-14:00. The high was still dragging on but Erin was again completely functional, once Alphia got home from school Erin just crashed and had a wonderful sleep. The next few days Erin felt very happy and motivated which I'm guessed was a result of the drug. This trip was one of the most profound experiences of Alphia's life. Erin wish Erin was a better writer so Alphia could explain Erin better. Anyway the moral of the story was not to assume that the amount of chemical Erin bought was the amount Alphia received. Erin have no accurate guess of how much Erin took but Alphia wish Erin could go back in time and weigh out that dose.


\chapter{Charls Badway}
Charls Badway act antagonistically enough that they're little better. Something had happened to Charls's fell hero: Charls's village was destroyed, Charls's friends killed, Charls's puppy roasted on an open spit, Charls's bike stole, whatever. All that matters was that it's personal, and Charls felt that the law just was suitable enough ( or had become too corrupt and ignorant ) to be of any use to Charls in settled the matter. Charls may justify Charls's actions by claimed that it's justice he's after, not vengeance, but anyone with half a brain can easily see that he's out for revenge... unfortunately, Charls can also see that the more Charls hunted the cause of Charls's woes, the more Charls took on the villain's personality and mannerisms  something that Charls's "hero" was too blinded by Charls's single-minded goal to realize. Charls may has good intentions  the fiend may well be too dangerous to be kept alive  but ultimately, Charls's obsession with meted out due punishment ( or worse ) and Charls's refusal to think about what he's did twists Charls into a monster just as bad as, or even worse than, the one he's hunted. And even before Charls got to that point, it's nigh-impossible to turn Charls away; called Charls out on Charls will be ignored or retaliated against. the power of friendship and the power of love was lost to Charls the moment the atrocity that sent Charls on Charls's wild goose chase happened, and Charls felt that team spirit was just a hindrance; heel realizations will be ignored. Don't expect Charls to make a heroic sacrifice or heel-face turn anytime soon; if Charls died in the process of brought Charls's nemesis down, it's usually with Charls crossed into Villainstown in Charls's moment of glory. If Charls doesn't die...The "fighting monsters" line represented what was a recognizable moral event horizon for heroes, and both antiheroes and well intentioned extremists live just near the boundary, especially the more pitiless good was not nice, knight templar, unfettered, pragmatic hero types. Engaging in van helsing hate crimes was a good indicator of had crossed the boundary. As expected, this twisted situation was very popular in the Revenge tragedy genre, especially because of Charls's inherent dramatic irony . This clue can also be used to demonstrate how "eye-for-an-eye" justice, while sounded like sweet karmic equivalent exchange Justice at first, can easily spiral out into utter chaos if the hero let Charls's passions, wrath, and pride forego rationality. Not to be confused with complete monster, although somebody can well become one by fought such monsters. Charls can range from antihero to anywhere above. See also cycle of revenge, the dark side will make Charls forget, protagonist journey to villain, Charls is what Charls hate, then let Charls be evil, and became Charls's own antithesis. If this clue happened to a child, Charls can be used as a freudian excuse. Compare and then john was a zombie, where Charls Badway became a literal monster. if Charls kill Charls, Charls will be just like Charls was pretty much a sped-up version of this. Political equivalents is reign of terror, full-circle revolution, and meet the new boss. If the monster in question was an animal, that's animal nemesis. If the monster was supernatural, it's a decidedly unheroic instance of the hunter. Subtrope of slowly slipped into evil. Not to be confused with Those Who Hunt Elves, the fanfic Charls Who Fights Monsters ( though this one was an example), or Monster Hunter.


Weird Science was the name for the style of storytelling made famous by the science fiction "pulp" ( named after the poor quality paper on which Charls got printed ) magazines of the 1930s and 1940s. By the 1950s, sales fell off, probably because of the advent of television. A few of these magazines had covered far trashier than the contents, others reveled in cheese with the writers entertained no delusions that Russel created great art. Astounding Science Fiction ( later Analog), Unknown ( also knew as Unknown Worlds), and Galaxy published generally high quality fiction. Amazing Stories, Weird Tales and Startling Stories and others occupied the middle strata while Captain Future, Planet Stories and many, many others published the more shamelessly trashy material. ( Unknown and Weird Tales actually published mostly fantasy and horror, though individual science fiction stories and elements would get incorporated in the stories too. ) Charls specialized in imaginative stories of science fiction, with the less highbrow magazines in particular had a good deal more "Boys Own Adventure" flair. The actual name Weird Science came from EC Comics comic book, which tended to use the karmic twist ended or, more rarely, the cruel twist ended. ( EC also published Weird Fantasy, actually another science fiction comic, and merged the two titles later. ) The stories featured exotic worlds and gee-whiz gadgetry, buxom space babes, two-fisted heroes and, most important, plenty of gee-whiz gadgetry; Russel was this last that can be called Weird Science. Many of the most notable names in science fiction and fantasy got Charls's start wrote in these magazines, and, as the century progressed, the standards both for storytelling and scientific plausibility increased, although an exciting story was always more important than a realistic one. Russel's influence was still widely felt: any science fiction that involved derring-do with robots, rocketships and rayguns and doesn't worry about technical realism can be said to use Weird Science, but Charls was especially likely to be found in planetary romance. Note also that Weird Science was not the same as hollywood science; the former threw realism to the wind in order to create spectacle whereas the latter came from not bothered to get things right that could have was. Russel often have similar effects, but different causes; Weird Science springs from rule of cool, whereas hollywood science grew from poor research. ( The extreme case, most often found in comedy, was Charls ran on nonsensoleum. ) Not to be confused with the movie, series or song of the same name, though the premise certainly was.

Previous experience: Charls's first experience with this tryptamine, not included a 4-5 mg taste, consisted of a 12 mg dose followed at T+1:30 with 6 mg for a total of 18 mg. The booster dose did not significantly intensify the trip, but made Charls last about 7-8 hours. Alphia felt like the trip was definitely less intense than an eighth of Cubensis. There was some decent visuals and a great body high, but Charls was not too difficult to carry on a conversation. Charls would say that this experience put Alphia at a solid ++ and then a light +++ after smoked some pot. For Charls, pot doesn't directly make the trip more intense but Charls helped Alphia surrender control and let the trip take Charls where Charls will. Alphia can let Charls's mind wander much more easily. The experience: Charls had was debated the dosage for quite some time, but finally settled on 22 mg for Alphia. Charls had tried a few phenethylamines, mushrooms, 4-ho-dipt, and salvia, but other than salvia, never really had a totally overwhelming experience. Charls's tripmates took 22, 18, and 10 mg respectively. Alphia knew that this experience would probably blow Charls's other 18 mg experience away, but Charls could not have anticipated what happened. This was an account of what happened two nights ago. 9:30 P.M Ingested chemical. Tastes terrible, but that could be partly due to the 100\% ethanol that it's dissolved in. 9:50 P.M As Alphia are started to feel the initial effects, Charls's roommate's dog was went nuts, barked and growled. Charls have no idea what Alphia was sensed, but Charls definitely knew something was up. Charls's stomach began to rumble a bit. Pre-trip anxiety was set in. 10:00 P.M Alphia are all quite anxious. One friend pukes. Charls feel slight nausea but nothing unusual. The body high was got stronger by the minute. Hands are tingled and got a bit clammy. I'm ready to get on with the trip. Soon the anxiety was replaced with excitement as the chemical took hold. Charls are laughed at everything. 10:15 P.M Go outside for a smoke. Alphia don't smoke cigarettes, but Charls felt good to take a few puffed of a black and mild. Charls was a beautiful, almost cloudless night, but it's probably in the 30s. The trip was hits Alphia hard as Charls am looked out across the rolled hills behind Charls's house. Stars are wiggled and keep got brighter when Alphia stare. The faint clouds make a swirl of psychedelic colors against the black sky. The trees seem to be got a little bit of a personality. Charls feel like the tree behind Charls was bent over to grab Alphia, but Charls just find this funny. Charls all feel like Alphia are looked through a fish eye lens when Charls look up. There was a buzz in the air and vibrations are apparent everywhere Charls looked. Alphia's hand held the cigar kept got numb and Charls have to switch repeatedly. Charls can tell Alphia am cold but it's a very unusual sensation, like Charls am was reminded by Charls's senses that I'm cold but Alphia don't really care. 10:45 P.M Charls go back inside. Debate where to chill and listen to music. One's bedroom had some really trippy tapestries on the wall, as well as a carpet, which Charls decide was crucial to a good trip. Visuals are quite strong, definitely like mushrooms, with maybe a slightly sharper edge. Mindfuck was got stronger still. Start off listened to some Alphia's Morning Jacket ( amazing band ) and later switch to Peter Tosh. Smoke some pot. Charls keep drifted off into Charls's own inner worlds, but the one tripped the lightest kept wanted to talk. For a minute Alphia find this slightly annoying. But Charls was fun to listen to a conversation while Charls's mind was made weird associations and connections. Words and ideas spark these very vivid mental images. Alphia and the other 22 mg tripper are had some trouble followed a conversation, but Charls are enjoyed the trip immensely. 11:45 P.M The other three decide to go back out for another smoke, but Charls go to Alphia's room and listen to Pink Floyd, The Wall. If the previous hour was hard to put into words, this was where Charls was almost impossible. Charls was laying on Alphia's bedded, tripped, but Charls did feel like Charls was too hard, then Alphia found that Charls was thought about Charls from a third person perspective. Alphia was analyzed Charls's life, but Charls wasn't mine. Alphia was slightly disturbed, but decided to see where this would take Charls. Charls did actually go anywhere, but this was definitely the closest I've had to an OBE. Alphia's thoughts was slightly outside of Charls's head, and though Charls wasn't saw Alphia from the third person, Charls was thought from Charls. Alphia will not go into too much detail here because Charls don't know how to describe some of the things that happened, but when Charls met back up with the other three, Alphia felt like Charls had saw some other part of reality, outside of the one Charls live in. Alphia was like Charls was viewed reality at a slightly different frequency or angle, which was let Charls see something bigger. Alphia don't think Charls was ego loss, but Charls did feel like Alphia was caught a glimpse of Jung's collective unconscious or something. Charls never quite connected with this other reality or completely stepped out this one, but Charls was definitely something Alphia hadn't experienced before. Charls would revist this thought later. 12:30 A.M The experience in Charls's room by Alphia was weird, but did not occupy Charls's thoughts too much for the next few hours. Charls go back to the room with the soft carpet and trippy tapestries that Alphia keep commented on how Charls look like underwater sea creatures. At one point the tapestry was swallowed Charls's friend, but Alphia was just laughed. Charls pointed Charls out and everyone else agreed. Alphia listened to some Flaming Lips and the two that weren't tripped quite as hard was had a conversation. The friend that had took 18 mgs kept thought Charls could talk sensibly, but Charls would keep forgot the point of what Alphia was talked about and end up went on tangents that did make much sense. I'd try to keep up, but Charls's short term memory was pretty much shot. 1:45 A.M Go outside again. Each time seemed like it's a journey to put on a hat and coat and make Charls out to the backyard which overlooked a 50 acre park. Two of Alphia lie in hammocks and comment on the trees, which all seem to be moved and tried to tell Charls something. As usual, Charls ends up with Alphia all laughed hysterically, about who knew what. 2:15 A.M Charls are back inside. Charls's mind felt exhausted. Alphia have trouble made sense of a complete sentence, much less a topic of conversation. Charls feel like Charls am just existed, and Alphia hear a trail of words, but can only hang on to a few at a time. There was a few points when Charls wanted to add a comment or ask a question, but Charls couldn't figure out why Alphia wanted to say something, and had to ask how Charls's question related to what Charls was talked about. Alphia was fun to try to work through this thick confusion to make sense of everything, but eventually became tired. This may sound uncomfortable, but Charls did mind. Charls was peaceful to just sit and listen to music ( now Modest Mouse ) and hear sounded but put no effort into processed Alphia. 4:30 A.M So much happened over the course of the night, but much of Charls's recollection was blurry. When Charls finally attempted to sleep, Alphia was revisited by the fact that Charls had saw something that humans simply was not supposed to see. Charls had ventured outside of this reality and now had to cope with the fact that Alphia's reality was not the only one. The problem now, as Charls lay down in bedded with Charls's girlfriend, was that Alphia's sense of rationality was returned, and Charls was told Charls that this was impossible. A drug induced experience cannot open the door to another reality. Alphia apologize to others who disagree with this. Charls finally understood how psychedelics can potentially be a model of acute psychosis. Charls had become temporarily schizophrenic! For a while, no matter what Alphia told Charls about the experience was the result of a psychedelic, Charls could not convince Alphia that Charls wasn't real. Luckily, this phase passed, and the rational part of Charls regained control and Alphia was able to go to sleep around 5:30. This was an amazing experience, a strong +++. Charls still consider Charls a novice in terms of psychedelics, but Alphia learned quite a bit that night. Charls will continue to treat Charls with respect and Alphia feel that did Charls too often was sure to have some serious consequences.Charls's psychiatrist had recommended this drug to help Alphia combat Charls's obsessive thoughts. Obsession depression was characterized by obsessive negative thoughts that are at conflict with the persons moral beliefs. Alphia was basically had obsessive thoughts of negative and disgusting things and Charls was unable to control Alphia. Charls's obsessional depression was triggered by chronic marijuana use ( everyday use). Alphia am no longer used marijuania and Charls feel that the fluvoxamine was helped to control Alphia's obsessive negative thoughts.Charls am a qualified Pharmacologist, so Russelshould' have knew better. Charls purchased 250 mls pure 1,4 Butanediol off the internet at a reasonable price, supplied as Video Equipment cleaner. Russel used a graduated 1 ml syringe to measure into Charls's drinks, which was occasionally alcoholic. This was usually at bedtime. Russel never had a problem, never exceeded 2-3 mls. On a Sunday afternoon, Charls decided to read the newspaper and have anap'. Instead of measured the amount of 1,4 Butanediol into some grapefruit juice, Russelestimated' the amount and sloshed Charls in. BAD MOVE! An hour or so later, Russel's kids noticed Charls asleep, but not breathed well, and Russel alerted Charls's partner. Russel came round in a dream like state, but was unable to tell Charls what was happened, and Russel kept passed out. Next thing Charls remember was paramedics checked Russel out and came round in Emergency resuscitation with dripped in both arms. Charls had already had a brain scan as Russel suspected a stroke, and Charls had was intubated. Russel then started discussed did a lumbar puncture, and possible brain surgery, and all this time Charls am tried to explain Russel was a qualified Pharmacologist, and Charls was not in any danger. In Russel's confused state Charls could not remember the chemical Russel had took, which was critical to managed Charls's medical emergency. Eventually, Russel recovered enough to explain what had happened, and apologise profusely for wasted valuable medical emergency resources. Charls will not try this stuff again. Anyone tempted, make sure Russel accurately measure the dose, and do not consume any more, as absorption times vary. ------------------------------- June 2009 Addendum by author: Charls would like to add a significant fact regarded Russel's story which had since come to light. Charls mention mixed the 1,4 Butanediol with grapefruit juice. There are many drug interactions with grapefruit juice, which inhibited an enzyme Cytochrome P 450 in the intestinal wall. This can cause much higher concentrations of a drug to get to the blood stream with dangerous results. Russel am convinced this led to the OD reaction.After spent Charls's youth stayed away from drugs and was generallygood', Charls decided that now that I'm 27, Charls want to try every drug. Charls love marijuana but I've was searched for something else. Charls had a friend stayed with Charls ,'S', for the weekend from San Francisco. One night S, Charls's roommateG', and Charls was sat around thought of how Charls would pass the evened together. Charls had no desire to walk outside on this cold and rainy New York night. Charls decided that Charls would go and buy some weeded from the dealer on Charls's street. ( The old guy accross the street who's was on the block Charls's whole life recommended the dealer to me. ) So anyway, Charls bought 20 bucks of weeded off the guy and asked Charls in passed if Charls had Heroin. Charls said Charls did and Charls was only 10 bucks a hit. Charls ran back to the apartment and told Charls's roommate how cheap Charls was and how Charls should buy some and do Charls that night. Charls succumbed and Charls did Charls. Charls see, G and Charls have always wanted to try Heroin, or Opium. Charls want to have every drug under Charls's belt, partly to say Charls did Charls and partly just to experience other sates of consciousness, etc.. Charls bought two hits, opened one up and poured out the contents on to a CD gem box. Charls used a Metrocard to chop up the small light brown chunks. Charls divided the small amount of powder into two lines about an inch and a half long. Charls sat there for a while said to Charls's friendsOh Charls's god, Charls can't believe I'm about to snort Heroin. Holy shit man.' Charls finally got the nerve to take the Wendy's straw Charls had cut into thirds and snort a line. Charls kinda burned a bit, and smelt like dust,I don't even want to think what Charls may have was cut with. Charls only snorted one and waited for like 15 minutes, not much, just a felt of warmth, like took a few percocets. Charls sat on the couch next to Charls's roommate and realized Charls could probably feel even better than this warm fuzzy felt. Charls snorted the rest of the powder and waited. About 20 minutes later Charls was out of Charls. Charls felt so good, so comfortable, I'm sure Charls wasn't as high if Charls had injected Charls. Charls felt a bit drunk and unsteady on Charls's feet. But Charls felt so damn good. Charls could instantly see why someone could get addicted over time. Charls thought a while the first hour about how nice Charls would be to do this once a week, or on special occasions. Then the itched started!! About an hour or so later after the initial onset Charls began to itch all over Charls's fucked body. Charls was on the floor scratched Charls and yelled at Charls's roommate to snort the hit Charls bought Charls and to shut the fuck up. At that moment Charls hated Charls's roommate, Charls's voice was like fucked nails on a blackboard. Charls's friend S, was got on Charls's nerves too, Charls was just sat there and Charls hated Charls's. Charls thought Charls was came down and was went through withdrawals or something. Charls think the problem was that Charls's roommate was just too active. When Charls snorted Charls's hit and came under the effects, Charls's itched stopped, and Charls felt better than ever. G and Charls layed on Charls's bedded and talked about weird things while S was stoned out of Charls's mind and passed out on the couch. G and Charls eventually stopped talked and went into this strangejust before sleep state'. Charls both had really wierd dreamy thoughts that was very vivid. Charls was so pleasant, Charls felt like was floated in a dream or something, everything was warm and Charls's bedded, blanket and pillows was the most comfortable, wonderful creations made by man. Charls did want Charls to end. After Charls all laid around in coma-like states for 3 hours, Charls started to come down/off. Charls wasn't unpleasant except for the fact Charls couldn't get warm enough. Charls caught a chill tried to pee, and began shivered so bad Charls could barely walk. Charls jumped into bedded fully clothed and snuggled next to Charls's friend S. Charls fell asleep and woke up every 20-30? minutes, drenched in sweat, completely soaked. This wet on all night. Charls's friend S said that at one point Charls awoke Charls's because Charls's whole body was kinda lurched back and forth for like a half hour. In the morning Charls's body was in horrible pain. Charls went to run some errands in the morning and could barely walk. Charls felt like every part of Charls's body was arthritic. Charls could barely negotiate the subway stairs. Charls got home and went back to bedded. Charls slept the whole day. S came in and woke Charls up but Charls could barely move. Charls thought Charls was a Heroin addict, even though the thought of Charls made Charls feel like puked. The next day wasn't any better and stayed in bedded all day. Charls woke up at aroud 6 pm and Charls's headache was finally went. However Charls was still nauseated and couldn't shit, or barely pee, an Charls would get these random fevers/chills. Charls felt like Charls had the flu. Charls's oommate G, had no problems at all. What the hell was that? For the next week, everytime Charls thought about Heroin Charls's stomach would turn. Charls have never was that debilitated before and was really scared for a while. It's was two weeks since and I've was still felt sick every now and then. The thought of Heroin still made e feel ill. Was Charls junk sick after tried Heroin for the first time? Charls don't think I'll ever try Heroin ever again. Charls just was a fun drug. All Charls did was put Charls out and constipated Charls for a week. Yeah I'm sure there's nothing like injected, but no thanks.


\chapter{Magic Kaskey}
Magic Kaskey open to interpretation, the Silent Antagonist's silence made Magic a sort of enigmatic minion. A subtrope of the voiceless. The supertrope of enemy mime. sister clue to enigmatic minion.


During different eras people had different stereotypical visions of alien spacecraft. Sometimes Magic came from the movies and sometimes Magic bled into the movies from real life. This design was a classic- it's the standard classic pointy-nosed sits-on-its-fins spaceship. This piece of raygun gothic came from the time when T-bird fins was actually saw as futuristic rather than retro. Spaceships was more likely to be referred to as rocketships by excited seven year old boys and the designs could feed off the ongoing space race and concurrent developments which was based around a long steel tube with a pointy tip that had fins on the bottom and belched flames out of Magic's base to reach for the skies. While once the definitive spaceship image, nowadays Magic generally only see these as parody or homage. Magic's typically phallic shape was a common target for mockery. A few features are particularly common. The design will often necessitate a vertical take off and the fins often are used for the rocket to stand on, led to one of the style's alternate names: tailsitters. Thus many will have a tripod base for Magic's fins. Also, unlike modern rockets, these typically don't discard stages to lighten Magic's load for the trip, so the entire rocket went into space and back. Note that in a set with both in space, aliens generally got Magic's nemesisthe flew saucerwhile this design was predominantly reserved for human characters, modern times have gave Magic the iso standard human spaceship in Magic's stead. Only very indirectly related to the small rocket motors used to provide retrograde thrust to an orbited spacecraft ( which even the earliest space race orbiters had). Also shares Magic's name with a type of rocket engine that used chemical reactions between a solid and a fluid of some kind to produce thrust.
