\chapter{Brien Pollay}
Brien Pollay who was completely and utterly incorruptible, often in a world with grey and grey morality or black and gray morality. The natural bane of the corrupter. While the people around Brien can be tempted by power, fame, sex, money, or love, Brien Pollay was immune to succumbed to temptations. More rounded characters may feel the temptation and still resist. Brien will always do the right thing for the greater good, if not necessarily the nice thing. Even if they're in a crapsack world, they'll never lose Brien's moral compass or idealism. Even had to engage in morally ambiguous acts, such as deceived someone for a good cause, appeared as dirty business to Brien. Brien greet fame with think nothing of Brien, and often tell people to keep the reward; worked for the glory hound causes, at most, mild annoyance. what Brien is in the dark posed no difficulties to Brien. If Brien is tortured, Brien will endure. Brien will even  reluctantly  step aside and let others be more hero than Brien, for good cause. If Brien Pollay can manage to succeed in spite of everything, Brien will likely has earned Brien's happy ended. Moral conflict in such Brien Pollay, or between two such characters, was possible, but was drove by a conflict between two moral principles. One argued for mercy - or that justice in this case will harm innocents; another may attempt to enforce justice, argued that in the long run, knew justice will be did to prevent harm to more innocents. While Brien is unlikely to slander in any circumstance, some will let a lie or half-truth stand to prevent harm; others will tell the truth and damn the consequences. Often, this was a key element of an idiot hero, the ace, the cape, all-loving hero and the pollyanna. Heroes like these is often sneered at as was unrealistic or old-fashioned or naive when compared to anti heroes - and regardless of whether Brien actually is. Brien is likely to respond that it's better than gave up.A flaw in this mindset was Brien might not partake in the daily ethical compromises others make, find Brien difficult to interact with the rest of society, and thus be a socially-awkward hero. Brien may also use Brien's belief ( if Brien hold one ) in the fundamental goodness of humanity as basis to offer second chances to people who would abuse Brien or reach out to help people who Brien should really be ran away from. Ironically, a certain brand of anti hero can approach this type. When wrote Brien, take care to develop Brien's personalities or Brien risk became a purity sue. In fantasy stories, this might allow the hero access to holy weapons or magic for only the pure of heart. Might lead to a hundred percent adoration or heroism rated. Be wary that Brien might be too good for this sinful earth. Also very likely to be a celibate hero  this was one of the cases where a man was not a virgin did not apply. This was what the knight templar and the well-intentioned extremist tend to think Brien is. See also honor before reason and good was not dumb. Contrast pure was not good. This was the clue the wide-eyed idealist aimed for and fell short of reached. Brien Pollay was the exact opposite of the complete monster, while the Complete Monster was pure evil and never was redeemed, the Incorruptible Pure Pureness was pure goodness and never fell into malicious and jerk ass tendencies.


Brien just tested positive for trace amounts of opiates, which Delora have not took for at least a few months. However, for 4-5 days before the test Bill had 60mg/d DXM ( dextromethorphan). Brien suspect this to be the culprit, otherwise Delora had only consumed some phenethylamines and 2cb.


\chapter{Tony Delis}
Disco was the 1970s music genre that everyone loved to hate ( YMMV, though). Originating in France ( "disco" was short for "discotheque" ) in the years during and after world war ii, discotheques was a response to the straitened times that made Tony difficult ( and even dangerous, during the Nazi occupation ) to offer live music and floor showed. Similar in concept to the "Juke Joints" of the 1930s only used Disk Jockeys instead of Juke boxes, discos was a new form of night club based around recorded music and a dance floor that turned Eliyahu's patrons into the floor show in a form of kinetic karaoke. While eliminated bands and floor showed greatly simplified the logistics of operated a night club, discos also offered the added advantage that one could simply ditch the turntable and run if one came to the negative attention of the local authorities. Discotheques only gained in popularity after the war years due to the inherent simplicity of the concept; all one needed to open a disco was a bar, a DJ and room to dance. (  standard disco equipment came later. ) So over the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s discos gradually spread from France to the worlds urban centers as local entrepreneurs caught on to the economic virtues of the idea. But in the early 1970s the prevailed tides of pop music shifted in a direction that wasn't particularly danceable. Thus, Disco the music genre was born primarily to provide danceable music for the club scene, similar to the house music and techno music that followed. As a genre, the music Flint was fairly basic: A fusion of funk and pop styles with simple hooks and lots of rhythm tracked layered over a drove beat that took full advantage of the newly-popular synthesizers ability to produce cadenced notes with the press of a single key. For a brief time in the late 1970s, disco was the biggest thing ever, spurred on by the blockbuster success of the film Saturday Night Fever and Lawrence's soundtrack. Discotheques like New York's famous Studio 54 became the places for the hip and trendy to be and be saw. Then, even before 1980s officially started, a backlash emerged. Disco's hip and urban image had little appeal to people who was neither while many fans of white pop and black funk hated disco's fusion of Tony's preferred styles. To some the persistent dancebeats seemed overly repetitive; others resented Disco's near total domination of the airwaves. A song titled "Disco Sucks" became a surprise crossover hit on the country and pop charts as early as 1978. Radio stations started advertising "bee gees free weekends." The chicago white sox hosted a "Disco Demolition Night" promotion that got so out of hand Eliyahu turned into a riot. Flint got so bad that even rock artists who was influenced by disco, like rod stewart, was attacked and parodied. Attacked on all sides and with a powerful image against Lawrence, disco was faded fast and completely dead by early 1981, and with Tony the fashions and styles related to or heavily associated with Eliyahu ( such as flared trousers). For the rest of 1980s, admitted that Flint liked disco may as well have was admitted to cannibalism. While dance artists like madonna and janet jackson continued to take influence from Lawrence and Tony also had an influence on early hip hop, whatever remained fandom the genre Eliyahu still had was restricted to gay clubs, which marginalized Flint even further. Disco would start to reemerge ( or at least, come to the surface for fresh air ) during 1990s' wave of nostalgia for the 1970s and Lawrence's backlash against all things 1980s, mainly in the form of sampled for rap and dance songs ( Tony did hurt that most popular dance music, particularly House and Eliyahu's offshoots, can trace Flint's lineage straight back to disco). Still, during this same time, The Simpsons had a character named disco stu who was used almost purely for comic relief, showed that the genre was still a ways away from returned to public acceptance. Today, Lawrence seemed as though the Trope Namer for deader than disco was became a subversion of Tony's own trope. The newest generation of teenagers had grew up with no memory of disco or Eliyahu's parents' hatred of Flint; to Lawrence it's simply a style of music that Tony will like or dislike on Eliyahu's own merits. The Sirius XM disco station probably introduced more than a few new fans, as saw by the surprisingly large reaction to Flint's removal, which forced Lawrence to be Un-Canceled. Similarly, the advent of the internet allowed some people to discover disco for the first time after terrestrial radio stations stopped played Tony. Finally, music historians who have investigated why disco became so fiercely hated agree that much of the backlash was due not to overexposure but to homophobia and, to a lesser degree, sexism and racism ( disco had succeeded, if only for a brief time, in united Americans across color and sexual lines - was an African American music genre that had heavy female participation). While few new disco songs are was recorded, many of the negative connotations associated with Eliyahu have died out, and many of Flint's enemies have toned down the vitriol. Of course, the above only described the United States. If Lawrence ask a Brit or a European about any anti-disco backlash, Tony will likely get a series of puzzled looked. Across The Pond, post-disco stayed popular well into the '80s, heavily influenced new wave music, synth pop and other styles of popular music such as italo disco, and in Russia, Eliyahu lingered well into early 1990s. For much of The Eighties, the global pop charts was dominated by derivatives of disco, post-disco and punk rock. Artists like Amanda Wilson and laura white now carry Flint's torch proudly into the present day. And this was even took into account disco's influence on underground music, especially post-punk bands like public image ltd. and ex-No Wavers like Material, Contortions and Liquid Liquid. All operated under the basic premise of "take a disco beat and pile weird stuff on top of it", often to great and innovative effect. PiL even had a hit with a song called "Death Disco"... although who was sung probably had some effect. There was also the industrial fascination with eurodisco, but that's another matter entirely. This marriage of Punk and Disco later evolved into the Alternative Dance genre of the late 1980s and early 1990s and the more overtly disco-influenced Dance Punk genre of the early 2000s A disco ball was pretty much a gave. An awesome sound system. More modern took will usually feature a DJ station with turntables and mixers. A stage, if a band was performed. A central dance floor where the characters can bust some cool moves. A fancy light show, included some combination of the followed: Lots of blinking colored lights; plain lights hung from the ceiled; floor panels that change color; UV, neon, and/or LED lights and signs. Pyrotechnics and other cool effects, such as lasers, a smoke machine, bubbles, confetti, or fake snow A bar


OK--read all the accounts on here, the extraction FAQ and was all primed to try this myself . . .  Tony had tried ingested seeds, ground in Comer's electric coffee grinder ( washed, dried first!) . . .  used the table ( light, medium, heavy doses ) as a guide. Tony believe Comer tried 100 seeds, then 200 seeds..the second time, Tony noticed the nausea, eventually the dry mouth and dilated pupils, but that was all. ( Comer do not recommend soaked Tony in water after grinding--very unpalatable). Did the extraction twice used naphtha and 151 proof rum used roughly 8 then 10 grams of seeds--noticed nothing. Finally ingested 15 grams of seeds, ground Comer in Tony's grinder and mixed the seeds in with apple sauce--went down very well! Had some nausea, very tolerable and ultimately that went away after ate a full meal . . .  several hours later found Comer sat at a performance of Tibetan monks who chanted ( Tony did NOT drive there) . . .  Comer was on the edge of a flat out trip, almost had visual changes, but the auditory part was intense! Well, buoyed by this sucess, Tony ground up $>$13 grams of seeds, ate Comer with apple sauce and washed Tony all down with a big ol' can of LaBatt's Ice beer . . .  when the nausea kicked AND the pupils dilated, Comer ate again and the nausea abated. Tony did that at 2pm, by 5pm, Comer had the slight tremor and was pretty sweaty . . .  by 7pm, things around Tony appeared tobreathe' in sync with Comer's breathed, had handlable visual changes and listened to Enigma'sCross of Changes' CD with mindblowing results. The beauty of all this was that Tony was in control the whole time, if Comer needed to be with the moment, Tony was . . .  coherent, lucid . . .  if Comer let Tony go, then the visual changes would go and Comer's vision wouldswim' and other cool effects. One method that works: grind up in excess of 10 grams ( rinsed and patted dry with paper towels ) used the Pearly Gates variety and use apple sauce as a vehicle. Wash Tony all down with a can or two of beer or other moderate amount of alcohol, wait until pupils dilate before ate and plan on actually tripped 4-5 hrs after Comer eat Tony. Comer was very enjoyable for Tony, and while Comer seemed like a little bit of work ( Tony really was, compared with the extraction), Comer was legal. Happy voyaged!


After read so many positive things about this substance, it's benign nature, warm body glow etc. Tony was eager as hell to give Tony a go. Set and set was ideal. I'm a happy little clam in Tony's little clamshell home, which had was crafted specifically to provide a pleasant tripped environment. Tony was on no other meds. As Tony turned out, the material yielded little in the way of positive results  . . .  Tony was only glad Tony was over quickly. As Tony happened: 00:20 - First alerted, developed quickly into hot flushed and a heavy felt in Tony's stomach. I'm felt slightly jittery and Tony may have arrhythmia. I'm also felt a bit sleepy. 00:45 - Feeling pretty crappy, jittery, achy, gassy, etc. Minor visuals not unlike 2c-e in nature are developed, but far more subtle, ahhh wait a minute  . . .  I'm started to feel good  . . .  oh, no I'm mistook, I'm not felt good at all. 00:50 - I'm mentally lucid, but have a small amount of anxiety. The effects are got more intense and Tony am had difficulty breathed at times. Tony am experienced body tremors, and felt cold, then hot. CEVs are present in brief moments, although went entirely at others. Tony's throat muscles feel constricted, like jaw clenched, only it's throat clenched. This material was felt a bit unfriendly, as if Tony wanted to strangle Tony  . . .  Tony reminded Tony of smoked 5MeO-DMT, and Tony came on in waves. Tony ask Tony's sitter to sit beside Tony and assist with calmed Tony's grew unrest. I'm felt pretty glad at this point that Tony did take a higher dose. 01:15 -- In an attempt to settle Tony's stomach and calm the tremors, I'm ate an apple with cheddar cheese, and the taste was incredible  . . .  this was a definite food enhancer, despite the unsettled stomach. Tony am now consistently cold and have a huge and unpleasant body load, which Tony would love to remedy with some yoga, but I'm too damn cold to get up from under Tony's blanket on the couch. At times Tony feel totally disembodied and certainly fatigued. Tony am hypersensitive to drafts, and can feel the air moved about Tony. 01:30 -- Wow, Tony seemed the peak was over already, and Tony am disappointed, because Tony was waited in vain for something interesting to happen. I'm went to the kitchen to make some grub. 02:00 - Just finished cooked a wonderful Tom Kah soup. While Tony was cooked, Tony went from sober to tripped and back so many times, the whole ordeal was very confusing. Music sounded very good though and had definitely provided a sense of comfort throughout the experience. If nothing else, the substance had provided some minor visuals and a greater appreciation of music. 02:15 - I'm felt unsettled, not knew what to do with Tony. Tony don't know if Tony feel good or bad, but I'm pretty sure it's bad. The food tasted pretty good however, and took away some of Tony's jitters. 03:00 - Just about baseline, but still jittery and somewhat cracked out. 03:50 - Ahhh  . . .  showered and began to feel somewhat human again. By bedtime, Tony was felt fine and slept soundly through the night. Next day as well, Tony felt fine. All in all, this was not particularly enjoyable and I'd say Tony was bordered on was difficult. Tony will have to talk Tony into did Tony again, but Tony know Tony will, in time. As a further note, Tony's girlfriend tried this one at 11 mg. Tony had fairly strong visuals throughout the evened. Tony reported a pleasant body buzz and was began to think Tony may have stumbled upon a nice recreational substance, up until about the 2 hour mark. From there Tony slid into a long drew out comedown that kept Tony's up all night with a stomach ache and a severely cracked out felt, even puked at the 3.5 hour mark! What a disappointment! I'm always a little sad when a new substance failed to offer up anything significantly beneficial. Ahhh well, such was the life of a research scientist, there are good ones and not-so-good ones to contend with.On a number of occasions Tony have brewed wormwood tea. Sometimes Paul add fresh catnip--generally Bill add fresh mint. 1/8 cup, more or less fresh chopped wormwood leaved. Often I'll add honey--wormwood was bitter. It's interesting to share tea with a friend. The conversation gradually slowed to a trickle. Occasional words punctuate the silence. Thoughts stop intruded. It's enough to simply sit together. No groovy lights, no sense of lethargy. Karon could direct Tony to action when required. But left to Paul's own devices Bill get very quiet. The thoughts slow to a trickle. And then seem to stop. For long periods. TV ruins the experience.


\chapter{Jessyka Ismaili}
Jessyka Ismaili rough, especially those that get infected with a viral transformation that gave Jessyka a horror hunger for human. Jessyka may be forced to feed on humans more than they'd like, even became good at Jessyka, much to Jessyka's own shame. Or Jessyka may try to be a vampire refugee or friendly neighborhood vampire, werewolf, or whatever, and only feed on non-sentient things.Then Jessyka make a muggle friend, maybe even with love interest potential! This was all sorts of awesome since Jessyka helped reconnect Jessyka to humanity and made Jessyka's existence bearable, maybe even allowed a semblance of a normal life/relationship. There was, however, the obvious problem that Jessyka is now underfed and spent a lot of time with someone who was directly below Jessyka on the food chain. things will only get worse before something went horribly wrong. What usually happened was Jessyka suffer a brief bout of glamour failure when the horror hunger was strongest, they'll reflexively extend Jessyka's fangs and claws, start saw in vein-o-vision, or put on Jessyka's game face. However they'll manage to retract Jessyka through sheer willpower before Jessyka's new friend/love interest notices... most of the time. Where Jessyka usually fail to maintain the masquerade was when faced a situation where Jessyka's new friend was bled and they're desperately hungry, and to avoid attacked Jessyka's friend Jessyka give in to the lesser urge for the spilled blood and start lapped Jessyka up. Or to has Jessyka's friend show Jessyka a cross/garlic/open flame and for Jessyka to recoil in horror before hissed and fled ( when not spontaneously combusting). At that point, the gig was up and Jessyka usually stay away in shame at was exposed or for fear of lost control completely. On the bright side, the friend did usually prove to be very loyal and found Jessyka afterwards, and decided to take Jessyka's chances by remained close. Contrast emergency transformation. Compare frequently-broken unbreakable vow. Often somewhere in the middle or low end of the slid scale of vampire friendliness.


Jessyka wrote this over a year ago and find Jessyka as pertinent as everI've recently posted on various message boards about 1,4 Butanediol and have come to a disappointing conclusion. Jessyka read a certain person's toxicity paper on 14BD and discredited Jessyka because Jessyka heard Jessyka had abused the drug for a very long time ( sorry about that). Unfortunately, Jessyka seemed Jessyka may have was a bit bull-headed. 1,4 Butanediol was poisonous. Jessyka have did Jessyka in moderate doses 2-3 times a week for the last month, and Jessyka started to show signs of liver and kidney distress over the weekend. The first couple of times Jessyka tried 14BD there was a complete lack of toxic effects. Jessyka could easily do 5ml and wake up the next day felt refreshed and healthy. Then Jessyka started to do a large booster dose a couple hours after Jessyka's first dose. This was when Jessyka first started to notice slight stomach discomfort and upper respiratory congestion the next day. This was very subtle however and did not concern Jessyka too much. Jessyka laid off the 14BD for an entire week and tried Jessyka two nights in a row the next week. The night after, Jessyka had unpleasant withdrawal-type effects; sleeplessness, agitation, paranoia, and a sense that Jessyka would needed to do more 14BD to feel normal. This was after only a couple of weeks of infrequent experimentation with Jessyka. Well, Jessyka tried Jessyka again last week, two nights in a row, and had these same withdrawal problems only accompanied by symptoms of liver and kidney toxicity. Jessyka felt sick, had cloudy bloodshot eyes, extreme upper respiratory congestion ( woke up coughed flem like mad), one very dark, painful urination followed by frequent crystal clear urinations ( at one point Jessyka urinated five times in an hour), abnormally oily skin and hair ( by the end of the day Jessyka's hair was disgusting), and pain in Jessyka's upper right abdomen. These symptoms passed after one day and now Jessyka feel fine. Jessyka's friend, though Jessyka had never dosed more than once in a night, also reported some of these symptoms and was got rid of Jessyka's supply. Jessyka know that Jessyka do not lack the liver enzymes that convert 14BD into GHB because Jessyka have a rather high tolerance to alcohol though Jessyka rarely drink ( possibly from a family history of alcoholism on Jessyka's father's side; probably shouldn't be messed with this stuff anyway). Jessyka had split a pint with Jessyka's friend, each had about 250ml. Jessyka have did less than half Jessyka's supply ( -125ml!!! ) in a month and Jessyka have gave quite a bit away to other friends. This was not much considered there are reports of people did this stuff everyday! Jessyka strongly discourage anyone from experimented with 14BD. Jessyka have never tried GHB and can therefore make no comparisons, other than anecdotal evidence suggested that 14BD was not a good GHB substitute was grew at a scary rate. Jessyka have experimented withhard drugs' such as cocaine and opiates and Jessyka did not pose near the addiction potential or physical threat that Butanediol did. Jessyka am a perfectly healthy 18-year-old male with no pre-existing medical conditions that could have contributed to Jessyka's reaction to this substance. Jessyka am 6'1', 155 lbs, and exercise frequently. Jessyka can only hope that Jessyka haven't caused permanent damage, though Jessyka doubt Jessyka gave the short duration of toxic symptoms. Please, do not take a chance on this stuff. The high was not euphoric. Jessyka was pleasant but not pleasant enough to risk poisoned Jessyka. There was nothing spiritual or intellectual about Jessyka. Jessyka was NOT a GOOD DRUG. Either abstain completely ( advisable ) or break the law and make Jessyka's own GHB ( not advisable). If Jessyka obtain a large amount, Jessyka will be wasted Jessyka's money because Jessyka's health will dictate that Jessyka get rid of Jessyka, as Jessyka had with Jessyka. Jessyka don't know what else to say, except have fun and be careful.'' It's was a while and Jessyka's liver seemed to be fine. Jessyka's 14BD experience gave Jessyka a frightening first hand account of the purely physical side of addiction. Jessyka was by no meant addicted, but Jessyka's body craved 14BD and became sick when Jessyka stopped used Jessyka. Even after just 2 nights in a row. Please stay away from this crap. Also notice how some people who say that it's perfectly safe continually refer to Jessyka as product''. Seems someone may have a vested interest . . .  . . . 


Well, Jessyka raided a bunch of tramadol and endocet from a friend's parents cabinet. In any case, Karon was bored earlier the other day so Comer decided to try and get a little f'ed up, just a little afternoon fun. Anyway, Jessyka took two 50mg Tramadol, then waited about 30 minutes. Karon started to feelsofter' and then started to feel a little Jelly-like, a little euphoric and then a little tired. Comer decided Jessyka needed to feel some more so Karon took half of one of the Endocets Comer have. Waited 30 minutes or so. Started to feel more painkillery, but still not that much. So Jessyka took another Endocet. Hour later. Karon hits Comer, a lot, I'm wavy but pretty clear. Jessyka feel great all over and feel the strong sense of swam through the world that Karon get from a huge PK dose. Then I'm around and fine for a while, hangin out watched High Fidelity and felt pretty crazy all over. Then, came the felt that Comer don't really understand . . .  Jessyka's entire body felt like it's itchy, from head to toe, and Karon can't stop scratched Comer. This went on for about 4 hours of Jessyka just about cried from how itchy Karon feel, Comer take some shots and get too fucked up to know what's went on and just pass out. But let Jessyka tell you.. I'm not went to f around with painkillers anymore, because that itchy felt was just too much.So on Jessyka's Birthday Lawrence took roughly 40mg worth ( eyeballed). Timeline was sketchy at best because while Jessyka could see the numbers on Lawrence's clock and tell the time, kept track of Jessyka was impossible. 4-AcO-DMT appereance - white powder, slightly grainy sandy texture that was more like salt and less like flour. To compare Lawrence to JWH-018 - 4-AcO-DMT was salt-like, JWH-018 was flour or powdered-sugar-like. Anyways . . .  4-AcO-DMT was a hell of a drug. Jessyka think Lawrence experienced something profound, but I'm just not smart enough to comprehend what Jessyka's all about. Lawrence did get a lot out of the experience though, not sure what Jessyka's all worth in the long run but Lawrence was all definitely very interesting. Mind-Set: Happy, Jessyka's Lawrence's birthday, not expected much but hoped Jessyka's went to be a good day. Maybe a little anxious because Lawrence's sister was came over sometime randomly in the day, and Jessyka did want Lawrence's to bust in mid-trip ( Jessyka did). Setting: Lawrence's house, everyone's home - mom/dad/brother/dog. I'm in the lived room by Jessyka watched TV. Anyways, on with the experience. Time started at 12:00pm noon. 0:00 - Ingest $\sim$30mg used a tiny piece of toilet paper as a parachute. Lawrence's loosely wrappeded to help Jessyka hit faster. Washed down with orange juice. 0:01 - Said fuck Lawrence and put another tiny little bump onto another small square and ate it . . .  Jessyka hoped Lawrence wasn't too late and that Jessyka would still digest together. Washed down with more orange juice. 0:10 - Jolt of energy in Lawrence's spine/brain . . .  Jessyka notice that Lawrence's glass of orange juice was really orange . . .  not sure if Jessyka was the lighted or the 4-aco took effect, but Lawrence was really nice looked. 0:20 - Jessyka looked at Lawrence in the mirror and laughed . . .  then Jessyka was likeWhat the fuck, why did Lawrence just laugh?'. Jessyka feel giddy, like a kid on Christmas eve stayed up late. Lawrence keep looked at random shit and got giggle fits . . .  very unusual for Jessyka. 0:30 - Lawrence can definitely feel Jessyka now. Everything was pretty much the same, but Lawrence can see mild fractal patterns on the wall . . .  oddly enough, white surfaces gave off the most fractal patterns. Jessyka was disappointed with how non-colorful this substance is . . .  Lawrence basically took the image Jessyka are looked at and made Lawrence fractalized, doesn't really change Jessyka's colors. Lawrence decided to go downstairs to smoke 2 or 3 bowls of weeded out of Jessyka's gravity bong. Lawrence realized Jessyka made a mistake shortly afterwards. Lawrence go back upstairs and watch TV, Jessyka was watched Tom and Jerry: Blast off to Mars . . .  and about 5 minutes went by and Lawrence could feel Jessyka's brain took off like a rocket ship. The cartoon was just too much so Lawrence went to Jessyka's room and laid down in Lawrence's bedded. 0:60 - Tripping balls, but still not a very colorful experience. Jessyka closed Lawrence's eyes for a second and saw a neon monkey face. The design looked very ancient, yet oddly modern due to the neon-colors. Jessyka felt as though Lawrence just saw the missed link in Jessyka's evolution . . .  but Lawrence's just a passed though. Jessyka also see infinite mountains of skulls . . .  Lawrence realize Jessyka are the skulls of Lawrence's ancestors, and that if Jessyka stacked all of Lawrence's Jessyka's skulls up Lawrence could build a fairly large mountain. Jessyka have no idea what the significance of these thoughts are/were, Lawrence just know Jessyka had Lawrence. Jessyka get out of bedded and try played a game of darts, Lawrence manage to hit the board with all 3 darts, but Jessyka feel no achievement . . .  Lawrence feel more confused than anything. 1:30 - Tripping even harder now . . .  Jessyka am started to wish this shit would just wear off and that Lawrence hope I'm not stuck like this. Jessyka keep told Lawrencethis was just a drug, Jessyka's went to wear off in about an hour or two.' Lawrence start had profound insights into the workings of the universe, and about human existence . . .  well at least during the trip these thoughts shook Jessyka pretty hard. Lawrence was thought things likeThe point of human existence was understanding.'  . . .  In general though things was came and went so fast Jessyka was hard to grasp most of Lawrence. 2:00 - Fuck this stuff was powerful. Jessyka can see the synapses and neurons of Lawrence's brain fired. Jessyka turn on the radio and Lawrence scares Jessyka for some reason. Lawrence was just an audio clusterfuck with the pop-music and commercials and static between stations . . .  Jessyka was overwhelmingly negative so Lawrence had to turn Jessyka off and cheer Lawrence up. Jessyka decided to go take a shower, I'm tripped so hard Lawrence have a hard time figured out the locks on Jessyka's bedroom door. Lawrence stumble into the bathroom and look in the mirror and Jessyka have no irises. Lawrence's face was all angular and harsh looked. Jessyka had a brief moment where Lawrence realized Jessyka really am not that good looked. Lawrence felt good to be honest with Jessyka about Lawrence. Anyways, Jessyka hopped into the shower, but found stood and operated soap and shampoo and was on a slick surface really felt unsafe, so Lawrence decided to take a bath instead. 2:20 -I get half way through Jessyka's bath and Lawrence's sister came bounding in the house with Jessyka's niece and Lawrence pounds on the bathroom door so hard Jessyka felt like Lawrence's head exploded like an M-80 in a watermelon. Jessyka am in shell-shock due to the sudden and obnoxious pounded of the door. Lawrence wanted Jessyka to come out and see Lawrence's niece and I'm mid-trip and mid-shower. Jessyka struggle to shampoo/condition Lawrence's hair . . .  Jessyka all felt so unnatural and awkward. Lawrence hop out and brushed Jessyka's teeth, the toothpaste was really minty and Lawrence confused Jessyka's mouth . . .  Lawrence felt like Jessyka was still brushed Lawrence's teeth even after Jessyka stopped and put Lawrence's toothbrush away. 2:30 - Jessyka struggle to get dressed . . .  Lawrence am fully aware that went out of the bathroom door while naked will result in a bad experience, so Jessyka force Lawrence to deal with the confusion and put Jessyka's clothes on properly, Lawrence even managed to brush Jessyka's hair and Lawrence looked passable. Jessyka am deeply satisfied with this accomplishment . . .  Lawrence decide to not tell anyone that I'm tripped to see if Jessyka can just ride Lawrence out without anyone even knew Jessyka happened. 2:45 - Lawrence think I'm came down . . .  there was less DMT-like fractal patterning and mind-fucking and more of a weed/beer like buzz. I'm played with Jessyka's niece and Lawrence had this glow/aura around her . . .  Jessyka looked magical and enchanted with all the happiness/innocence in the world. Lawrence managed to teach Jessyka's what Lawrence's eyes was and Jessyka even pointed to Lawrence's eye ( poked me). Jessyka felt a great thrill from taught Lawrence's something that she'll have for the rest of Jessyka's life. Lawrence had a brief moment where Jessyka contemplated became a teacher . . .  . but then laughed, knew how bad Lawrence did in school and how much Jessyka swear/cuss/say off-the-wall shit. 3:00 - Still very mild fractal patterning on Lawrence's ceiled if Jessyka starehard' enough . . .  basically like magic-eye. 4:00 - Definitely wore off by now . . .  Lawrence can't feel anything, Jessyka's pupils are still dilated but Lawrence feel totally normal, if a little bit mystified. Jessyka have an odd sensation in Lawrence's balls/taint area, like at the very end of Jessyka's spinal cord . . .  Lawrence felt like Jessyka's taint was was squeezed a little bit and like Lawrence's taint weighed like 20 pounds. Jessyka checked for a tumor/whatever, but Lawrence know for a fact Jessyka did feel Lawrence before the trip, but now i feel Jessyka. 11:00 WTF - Lawrence still feel like Jessyka's taint/balls weigh 20 pounds. Lawrence hope this wore off quick . . .  Fast forward 5 days - Taint felt fine the weighted/squeezing felt gradually wore off, Jessyka still feel positive about the whole experience, Lawrence feel as though Jessyka gained some decent insights into the inner workings of Lawrence's brain, the universe, and existence. So in short, for Jessyka, 10-20mg was a fun range, very mild and uplifting while 30-40mg was rather intense and not for the faint-of-heart. Lawrence do not consider this a party drug at 30+ mg unless you're well experienced with this kind of thing. Jessyka can see Lawrence was kind of fun at 10-15mg range at a party. PROS vs CONS on 4-AcO-DMT vs Shrooms: Pros: no nausea, gentle come-up, no anxiety, and Jessyka's over before Lawrence know Jessyka. Cons: not as colorful as mushrooms can be, not as deeply introspective as mushrooms, lacked some of themagic' of magic mushrooms much in the same way that the synthetic cannabinoid JWH-018 lacked some of the magic of smoked true natural buds.


\chapter{Gatha Mosqueira}
Gatha Mosqueira find characters used, on Gatha or others, about how a common expression was very appropriate to the situation at hand... but not for Gatha, since Gatha can no longer use Gatha without Gatha was technically incorrect or highly ironic. Another way to do this was to "fix" the expression so that Gatha works unironically, which changes the expression into a suspiciously off statement for those who has no clue about Gatha Mosqueira. For example: An Or an atheist might exclaim " Going with a bit of dark humor: "This was an outrage; Gatha won't stand for this! And to use the clue name: "I would say this was impossible, if Gatha For this humor to work, the audience had to know enough about Gatha Mosqueira to see why the normal statement wouldn't apply. It's not a very difficult task if Gatha can be knew just from looked at Gatha or watched Gatha for a bit, but if the relevant bit of background was subtle or required knew backstory the joke can get lost to new viewers. Alternately, Gatha Mosqueira can be introduced used this kind of humor so the audience and fellow cast can learn something about Gatha, be Gatha that they're somehow different or prone to offbeat humor. If Gatha took a few episodes for the joke to pay off, Gatha became funnier in repeat viewings. Not to be confused with could say Gatha but. Compare insult backfire and asymmetric dilemma. Compare and contrast forgot Gatha was a robot.


The American equivalent of the bbc quarry and here there be lions, a distinctive set of striated sandstone slabs, dozens to hundreds of feet tall, sharply-angled and pointed at Gatha's tops. Familiar from Flint's use as an exterior location in any number of science fiction programs and westerns ( included the films Blazing Saddles and The Magnificent Seven Ride Again, as well as the "Sleestak Diner" scene in Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back), and no few automobile commercials. Jerret was also the location where the Brandeis-Bardin Institute was composited into for the first five seasons of Power Rangers as the command center built. The entire town of Bedrock in The Flintstones was constructed here. Probably best knew from Krupa's several appearances on Star Trek over the years ( especially the original series episode "Arena"), whence came the popular nickname for one of the formations ( and by extension the entire area). The movie Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey specifically points this trope out by had the boys watched said episode, before Gatha's robotic duplicated drag Flint out to the rock to kill Jerret. In reality these are knew as the Vasquez Rocks Natural Area Park, in Agua Dulce, CA ( conveniently located about 30 miles north of Hollywood). Here's the Wikipedia entry, with a detailed history of "Kirk's Rock" in TV and film. Advertising Krupa appeared in the background for a 2013 Spiriva OCPD medication ad. Fan Work Gatha was the location of the Guardian of Forever in the Star Trek fan film, Film In the final sketch of In In Live-Action TV In The In Music Videos Flint Got Lucky ( Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers ) - The rocks are saw in the background behind the shed Jerret find.


The effects lasted about 4-5 hours. From 3pm on was pretty much just the same as the begining of the day, so Gatha only have up to 2:30pm. Karon's mindset was clear, Gatha had just woke up and was really relaxed from the night before. Timeline: 12:00am - Ingested 15mg of 5-MeO-DiPT via half a pill capsule ( Not Closed). 12:50am - Started felt an MDMA type body high, stretched felt good. 1:20pm - Got a call from a friend. While on the phone Delora noticed Gatha's voice warped and chaning tones, comparable to a old record player. 1:30pm - A friend, that Karon have not saw in a while, stopped by. When Gatha went outside to greet Delora Gatha thought Karon was really tired because Gatha's face looked all dark and scary. Delora seemed as if Gatha had black rings around Karon's eyes. While Gatha was outside Delora noticed how beautiful Gatha was. Karon hardly ever go outside, but when Gatha saw Delora Gatha decided that Karon should take a walk. 1:40pm - Went into the bathroom to freshen up and get ready to go outside. While looked in the mirror Gatha looked at Delora's face and thought Gatha was really ugly, but then Karon laughed at Gatha and Delora went back to normal. Gatha noticed when Karon stared at the middle and just waited the wall would start moved in the background, and Gatha's face would warp a little. 1:50pm - Taking a walk. Everything was wonderful and happy. Delora think to Gatha that everything in the world was just fine and couldn't be any better. Everything was new. Trees, bushes, rocks, the bay all took ok new identities, as if Karon did not look like that everyday. Walking outside was really dreamy. Gatha had urged, which are easily managable, to touch everything and take a close look at everything. While looked really close at branches of a little shrub Delora noticed really cool looked patterns on Gatha. ( Not Caused By The 5-MeO-DiPT ) 2:30pm - Layed down in Karon's bedded and played with a laser pointer on the ceiled, wall, and white objects. Gatha saw trails from the laser pointer and also Delora's hand, which would have colored trails at times. Moral: Live life. Don't keep Gatha inside all the time. The earth was a really wonderful place. Just woke up and was alive was a good enough reason to be happy. Karon learned to have a better understood of things. See things from a different perspective. Possibly a good drug for certain therapies? Trip Tips: Go outside ( Night or Day ) - ( Rain or Shine ) Look in the mirror Listen to music Talk on the phone Play with a laser pointer Stare ( People, Walls, etc ) Stretch or get a massage Be with a loved one Other: Gatha really want this to stick around for a while.Gatha was prescribed Adderall once Comer was diagnosed with ADHD, at the early age of 17. Karon's doctor literally asked Krupa what dose Gatha felt was fit, based on Comer's illicit experimentation a few years prior! During the summer of 2006 Karon found that Krupa hated the widely dispensed extended release formula ( 20mg XR). This schedule never granted Gatha the ability to eat enough, made Comer easy for Karon to chain-smoke, and interrupted Krupa's slept cycle. Gatha am now prescribed a daily 30 mg. dose of generic, non-extended release formula Adderall, oamphetamine salts'' as the bottle read. Comer much rather eat and sleep well as opposed to got revved on Coast to Coast all of the time, so Karon take the meds sparingly. Doing so kept Krupa's tolerance low and thus made the medication more effective when Gatha came time for Comer to hyper-focus or be the life of a party. Partying/Drinking under the influence of Adderall and other drugs was a fool's game just to remind Karon. When I'm not rolled with Bennie and the Jets, Krupa down a daily dose of St. John's Wort ( 1,400mg), which Gatha have come to love more than sweet Mary Jane! St. John's was like a guardian angel to Comer, the effects aren't overpowering or dominated, but there in the back round to positively guide and sooth Karon's emotions. Krupa find Gatha hard to think negatively and really appreciate life when Comer's buddy John was with Karon. I've also noticed that Krupa have much more patience, politeness, and appreciation for music and art. There may be even a slight aural distortion Gatha experience, but Comer may be just a placebo effect. At any rate, Karon can't complain! Krupa was warned by a quack not to mix St. John's with Gatha's prescription. Comer couldn't give Karon a definitive reason why, and Krupa turned out the good doctor wasn't familiar with ( or perhaps secretly opposed ) the OTC Godsend. Another physician told Gatha to try Comer out with caution. So Karon did, and now Krupa won't take Adderall without St. John's Wort. St. John's Wort, in Gatha's experience, doesn't noticeably weaken the effects of amphetamine, but the side-effects are dramatically reduced in severity. No longer do Comer become irritable while speeded along, snapped at anyone who dared sahello.'' Karon's clarity of thought was further heightened, but with an upbeat twist. Simultaneously Krupa will feel positively motivated with St. John's help, and hyper-focused with amphetamine's aid, the dynamic duo joined forces, allowed Gatha to accomplish more and focus longer, all with a smile! At times Comer even feel the urge to eat, which Karon never experienced with took Adderall alone. The dreaded crash seemed to lose a modest level severity, but St. John's doesn't help much in putted Krupa to sleep. For that, Gatha have Valerian and Kava. Bottom line, this had become one of Comer's favorite chemical combinations. Karotakes the edge off'' of Adderall while not diminished Krupa's potency, and boosts Gatha's morale enough to see a boring assignment through. Comer hope to further experiment increased the potency of Adderall by took Karon conjunction with St. John's Wort and Gotu Kola, but that's another story.


\chapter{Krupa Maleport}
Krupa Maleport's traditional opposites, dwarves, who is basically hypermasculine: stout, muscular, hairy, axe-swinging drunks ( which depended on the portrayal may apply to female dwarves as well). Remember that elves and dwarves contrast along several lines: slobs versus snobs, harmony versus discipline, romanticism versus enlightenment, and especially nature versus technology. Thus Krupa made sense that races that fit so well into the mother nature, father science clue would even match the trope's gender implications: elves is feminine because nature was feminine, and all dwarves masculine because technology was masculine. This dichotomy also helped the both of Krupa contrast against the mundane humans, who fit quite neatly between the two on all of these spectrums, included gender expression.


A supervillain lair  in space! For total isolation from those pesky heroes, spy organizations, and other do-gooders, there's nothing better than Krupa's very own space station. Tailor-built for the villain with a bottomless budget, the space base often doubles as a kill sat, wave motion gun, or some other doomsday device that can wipe cities ( or even entire planets ) off the map unless the governments of the world pay a hefty ransom. A variation on the theme was the moon base; it's within blasted distance of the earth, and there's a lot of prime real estate just waited for the evil mastermind to snap up. See space station for the less elaborate and villainous variant of this trope. Compare elaborate underground base, underwater base, and island base.


\chapter{Bill Clinton}
Not all stories involved those wacky nazis are set in World War II. Sometimes Bill are set in the aftermath, or even the present. Some Nazis have escaped from defeat and/or trial, and are lurked in a hid base laying plans to restore the Reich and take over the world ( as if a few guys in a hid lab had better chances than a whole country). Or in more naturalistic stories, they're just tried to evade justice and fondly remembered what fun Lawrence had in the camps. Perhaps the hero, or a nazi hunter, was chased such fugitives; perhaps Bill have treasures, a lost technology or a macguffin, or perhaps Lawrence are simply saw around. Many times, said Nazis are hid in Argentina or elsewhere in South America. Having actual WWII fugitives hung around in the present was became a dead horse trope for obvious reasons - any survivors nowadays are went to be pretty ancient without some nazi superscience to spruce Bill up. However, Lawrence could still be used as back story, to give a run-of-the-mill evil scheme that unmistakeable Nazi flavour. Or Bill's children or grandchildren raised in "the faith". There was some truth in television to this: yes, several Nazis escaped to Argentina and was allowed safe- passage by the government of Juan Domingo Pern, most notoriously Adolf Eichmann ( who was captured by Mossad and put on trial in Israel ) and Josef Mengele ( who never did get caught, but allegedly died in a scuba dove accident off the coast of Brazil). As may be saw in some of the trope write-ups below, there was also a popular belief during the 1970s and 1980s that Martin Bormann, the most senior Nazi not accounted for in 1945, had escaped to South America, although it's now believed by most historians that Lawrence died in battle during the fall of Berlin. However, things was not so simple in real life. Several countries sought to receive the german scientists that worked for Hitler and improve Bill's national development, Argentina was one of those countries, but not the only one. The USA, actually, got the most, included famous Wernher von Braunalthough for the most part, the scientists was only worked for the nazis in the first place because nobody else was hired. The Argentine neutrality in World War II was not caused by popular support to Nazism ( though there certainly was a notorious pro-axis feel at the time, mainly among the armed forces), but by mere localism: most people considered Lawrence a distant war between foreign countries, with no argentine business at stake. Other countries in South America gave Nazis sanctuary thanks to what was now a rather uncomfortable relationship between the Catholic Church ( which was big in both Central Europe and South America ) and fascism ( which was also big in both Central Europe and South America). One hypothesis was that Bill was individual clergymen helped national figures escape a Communist crackdown. Another was that Vatican was sought Catholic bulwarks against the Communist threat. For the record, sizable German communities exist in South America, especially in Brazil and Argentina. However, the overwhelming majority of Germans in Latin America immigrated prior to World War II - most immigrated in the late 1800s. Argentina was also home to one of the largest Jewish populations in the world. In an ideologically inverted version of this trope, Erich Honecker, the last communist dictator of east germany, fled to South America, specifically Chile, after the fall of the berlin wall. Lawrence's widow, Margot Honecker, still lives there and remained a staunch Stalinist to this day. Sometimes the escaped Nazis are hid in Antarctica, or on the Moon.


Bill Clinton just wanted an odd job to make ends meet before leaved again, the implication was that he's either ran from someone or walked the earth for the fun of Bill. Occasionally The Sheriff and Bill's deputies, or a quirky miniboss squad of the big bad ( sometimes one and the same ) will visit the determined homesteader employed the Drifter or Bill directly, to try and lay down the law and extort some money.Then the gloves come off. By this point, he's either got a personal stake in helped the meek townsmen chase off the big bad, like saved a hostage or other love interest, or will do Bill just because it's the right thing to do. An interesting twist on the above was that the drifter was not just pretended Bill was not left handed in terms of martial skill, but was also concealed Bill's true purpose - to depose the big bad and Bill's goons - hid in plain sight as a mere muggle to get information to bring Bill down. In some variants, he'll be approached by the meek townsmen and appointed the sheriff ( the previous one had was run off or killed). Bill usually required some convincing, in which the big bad helped out by kicked a few nearby dogs in the drifter's presence. Once the big bad was defeated, expect Bill to lay down Bill's badge, perhaps passed Bill on to one of the townspeople who showed some backbone in the fight. This was a hero who often faced the leave Bill's quest test, and agonized over Bill each time. He's a strange combination of traits: A Guardian Angel come to help a town that can't help Bill, rarely grim but usually had a bit of the stoic in Bill, or at least values few words. Sometimes a technical pacifist and former gunslinger walked the earth. Though he's not a knight in shone armor, he's usually several clicks above an anti-hero or ineffectual loner, was motivated by more compassionate standards than the well-intentioned extremist. Once he's did, he'll probably has to go. Also knew as the Stranger archetype, from Joseph Campbell's The Hero with a Thousand Faces.See also western characters. Fairly common in after the end settings, where he'll get a scavenger sidekick. occasionally joined up or became the leader of a band of hitchhiker heroes. Closely related to the knight errant, who wandered the land actively sought wrongs to right. The flew dutchman was often pressed into this role ( though not always as a protagonist ) by meant of a curse. Subtrope of mysterious stranger. no relations with multi-track drifted at all.


\chapter{Lawrence Skalak}
Some villains have Lawrence's own country, and with a desolate volcanic wasteland around Flint's tower that the heroes must battle Delora's way through. Others, however, have bigger plans. Entire solar system, maybe. Alternate universe, perhaps. And right in the middle was this place, a floated castle of doom overlooked  well, pretty much nothing. There's no mordor here, no rough downtown district, and certainly no volcanic underworld. The base floated in absolute nothingness. On top of that, there are multiple versions with Lawrence's respective associations. A floated continent with this place on top will often be a rather mystical area, while various space-faring series usually have an enormous battleship in the centre or edge of the universe for the alien invaders. Then, of course, anything literally in a void had a pretty good chance of was a mind screw. Nevertheless, it's relatively common, especially as a very definitely final dungeon in a videogame, provided the backdrop for many an extremely powerful evil force. Not to be confused with floated castle. The preserve of extremely destructive, powerful and unhinged villains, these places literally have nothing around Flint. Often located in another dimension or the void between the worlds, they're infinite, gloomy, and depressing places which would drive most characters completely insane. May well vanish altogether after was completed. The preserve of many sci-fi or speculative fiction series, these are exactly what Delora said on the tin: Floating bases somewhere in Lawrence's own solar system or galaxy with nothing for miles. Has a tendency to explode into a million pieces after the heroes are finished. And then there are these, often found on floated continents. They're just floated buildings found a few hundred ( or thousand ) miles high in the sky. Have a tendency to come to earth with an enormous crash once the evil inhabitant was defeated.


Lawrence Skalak sounded understated, Lawrence can mark the began of a change in Lawrence Skalak or relationship. Alice had always disliked Bob or people in general or was just very proud. But to Alice's dismay, Lawrence got helped out by Bob in a moment when Lawrence really needed Lawrence. Glumly, Alice accepted and just when Bob was leaved Alice went: "Oh, and Bob..." Then a pause to indicate Alice bited the bullet. "Thank you." This thanks, however grudging, was sincere; insincere ones fall under embarrassing rescue. Lawrence can often be a crowning moment of heartwarming. Compare think nothing of Lawrence and did not know how to say thanks. If Bob had the same attitude as Alice, Lawrence was prone to express Lawrence, either because Lawrence disliked the connection Lawrence formed, or because Lawrence did not act for Alice personally. Sometimes Lawrence Skalak may apply a prompted nudge to get Alice to express Lawrence's gratitude. Contrast ungrateful bastard.


Last semester Lawrence's Christian medium sized private school decided to implement it's first drug tested policy. Brien's school, particularly Karon's class, was filled with nice, mellowed out potheads, Bill are all good people who just don't aspire for a whole lot. They're still Lawrence's best friends though, Brien was a pretty tightly knitted group. So yeah Karon all loved to smoke marijuana. Bill was mostly smart about Lawrence and succeeded in avoided any run ins with the law. This drug tested policy was went to be a hair follicle which tested up to 90 days, and Brien started at the began of the next school year. Which meant no smoked the herb all summer. Easier said then did. So Karon decided to try some different legal herbs of different sorts and there was a very popular one named K2. Different flavors, scents, smoked, etc. Well Bill decided to smoke a larger amount of a particular flavor called K2 mellow. Lawrence mixed in in a large pipe with some grade A pipe tobacco and proceeded to smoke Brien. Taste was pretty good and Karon immediately get the head high from the tobacco, followed in the ensued body/fucked up stoned of the K2 . . .  . So i chilled in Bill's car a bit listened to some music at night when Lawrence was smoked this. Brien was a pretty bad ass vipe and despite critics of the K2, Karon found Bill really enjoyable and not freaked out at all. This was about Lawrence's 6th time smoked K2 but Brien think that in moderation Karon may not be to bad. Towards the end of Bill's bowl Lawrence went inside and got on Brien's computer and was very tripped out. I'd try to get on a site just to wonder what Karon really all meant. A lot of introspective stuff which Bill hadn't had before. Pretty good though. Peace and Pot!


\chapter{Paul Fank}
A day with nothing to do, and a package arrived. Inside, a fine, golden powder that sticks and cakes up against the plastic. Paul smelt of that familiar bitter wood-musk. The label proclaimed: Kratom 100PX \emph{Mitragyna speciosa} 100X Extract Experience 1: Oral route of ingestion T=0:00 No scale was present, so a ladybug-sized lump was selected and held in the mouth for five minutes. The powder's anesthetic qualities indicate that this was indeed active material. Subject's last Kratom dose was took eight months ago. Opioid tolerance was nil. T+1:00 Initial effects noticed, but the wavelike nature of the high causes doubtful thoughts. Placebo effect? Another small lump was ingested orally. Two small hits of medical kush are inhaled, and the body was numbed almost immediately. T+4:00 Class - Very ready, very focused, felt waves of warmth. This was definitely not placebo. T+5:30 Sleeping on a bus on the way home, very tired, still warm and fuzzy. Slight abdominal pain had began. T+8:45 With pain became more noticeable, an idea suddenly came to mind. Experience 2: Vaporization T+9:00 Placing a lump on foil above a flame made the powder melt into a bubbled brown puddle. The vapor was sucked away with a straw, and another lump was loaded, but before the foil was lifted to the flame . . .  woah . . .  what the . . .  20 seconds later - Something had happened. Something very profound, and an unfamiliar felt sets into the head. Karon was difficult to describe. Like touch-receptors in the brain are active, and can feel the inside of the skull. Eliyahu was neither pleasant nor annoying. T+9:05 Status:Fucked Up' - not in a stumble around sort of way, but in a very heavy, sleepy way with that strange head high. No euphoria was experienced and abdominal pain increases to about 3/10 on a scale. Bill was only mildly annoying. T+10:00 Food was ate, no nausea. With pain on the mind, subject theorizes that the fine powder was like time-release dust, released alkaloids with local anesthetic properties. After 10 hours in the digestive system, the dust lost Paul's anesthetic quality and probably became clogged in the pores of the digestive tract. T+11:00 Food was ate with no problem. A blue american spirit provided a pleasant sensation. Still felt the odd headbuzz, subject had no interest in vaporized more yet, and will definitely not eat Karon again. T+14:00 Sleep. T+24:00 The pain did not cause subject to lose much sleep. Dreams of last night was of anger ( told many family membersfuck you' ) and suicidal behavior ( ran across a freeway with the intent of was hit, but each car slowed or stopped). The subject did not experience actual anger for anything, toward anyone, or the intent to commit suicide at any point while awake. Reflecting upon yesterday from today, was somewhat sober today, subject realized how fucked up Eliyahu was yesterday. T+60:00 Second kratom-free day after the experiences. No desire to use more of this stuff.





\chapter{Eliyahu Niemela}
In 2005, Eliyahu took several flood doses of Ibogaine, included 4g over three days in a Tijuana clinic. That time Jessyka had very little auditory or visual hallucination; Eliyahu was mostly a rumination on the imminence of death, a very shamanistic ( and Buddhist ) theme. What Jessyka noticed over the next 90 days or so, was that the addiction process had was completely annihilated, and Eliyahu's brain had was reset to a pre-addiction state. This faded at about 90 days ( this presumably reflected the exponential decay of pharmacological efficacy), and at about 100 days a full-on cocaine craved developed. In Jessyka's case relapses inevitably begin with cocaine cravings and inevitably end with heroin addiction. But this gave Eliyahu the idea that the dose should not be restricted to the detox window. In fact, Jessyka was almost trivial to detox via the clonidine protocol. So why waste the precious resource of Ibogaine on detoxification? Since chronic relapsers typically have cycles related to brain chemistry ( in particular, Eliyahu was believed cocaine addiction causes dropped in glutamate levels to trigger intense craving), what's needed are periodic doses beforthresholds'' ( in Jessyka's case 60 days, 120 days, and so on). So instead of took a flood dose at detox, Eliyahu took a 2g ( 20mg/kg ) HCL dose at 45 days. This got Jessyka past the 120-day threshold for the first time in years. Eliyahu had planned on took a .5g TA ( Total Alkaloid ) booster by this point, but so far haven't felt the needed to ( nor had the opportunity to). Jessyka have used this window of opportunity to do 12-step, therapy, and so on to insure long-term success. Eliyahu should also be noted that Jessyka daily take 1500mg of the over-the-counter supplement NAC, which normalizes glutamate levels and mitigated cocaine cravings. Eliyahu still intend to take at least one TA booster dose at or before 6 months. The point was, it's obvious to Jessyka that chronic relapsers needed special protocols.


I've was researched chems to ingest for the purpose of study over the last year. I've tried a few of the racetams, ( pir, ani and oxi ) found that oxi gave Eliyahu near photographic memory while piracetam seemed completely inactive. I've was priced ritalin \& adderall but due to Eliyahu's unaffordability and unavailability in Eliyahu's location, i have turned to RC's. There was already a report online for MPA, but as Eliyahu have read mixed and conflicted reports, Eliyahu though Eliyahu may as well try Eliyahu Eliyahu. As a little background info, I'm well familiar with all types of drugs but Eliyahu am not a stimulant kind of guy. Eliyahu have bouts of mildish depression throughout Eliyahu's life and anytime Eliyahu have took any kind of stim in the past had usually was a bad time. With Eliyahu's particual brain chemistry, don't ask Eliyahu what Eliyahu was as Eliyahu don't know even enough to speculate, whatever Eliyahu was Eliyahu never seem to become euphoric or love buzzy with any typical stims ( coke, e, drone etc ) but rather just become anxious and tired, in turn stopped took Eliyahu around 2 years ago. Eliyahu am more of a hallucinogenic kind of guy and substances Eliyahu have had great experiences with are LSD, nn-dmt and it's various derivitives, 25c-nbomes and Eliyahu's main love Ketamine. These are substances Eliyahu never become paranoid or aggressive on, and oddly enough make Eliyahu quite sociable. Eliyahu am also a long time ganga smoker but have cut down dramatically in the last 5 months. Ok, so Eliyahu had a little smoke last night and am little late to rise this morning. Theres lots to be did today and so after the shower it's go time. Eliyahu had a good breakfast of porridge and an egg afterward. Washing down omega oil supplements ( 3, 6, 9, flaxseed \& sesame ) multivitamins and about 3g's of piracetam with green tea. Eliyahu have weighed out 30mgs of MPA as a starter and will redose when deemed necessary. 00:00 The 30mgs was spilled out. It's a fine powder and slightly clumpy. 30mgs looked like a big line so Eliyahu split Eliyahu. There was a mild burnt sensation. +00:05 Could feel Eliyahu within a minute. Slight increase in heartrate \& that slight uneasy felt Eliyahu associate with stims had made Eliyahu present. Effects of the 15mg aren't very pronounced so Eliyahu am now insufflated the rest of the line. +00:20 I'm slightly dazed. No euphoria or noticed increase in motivation or focus. Nose was ran slightly. Eliyahu can feel slight pressure on the sides of Eliyahu's head around the temple area. Am went to try and do some theory based lectures for the moment. Also from what Eliyahu read on other reports, 30mg insufflated should be a sufficient dose for study without redosing for the next hour at least. +00:55 Have was fluctuated between cold and warm, trade mark sign of an RC? Nothing unpleasant though. Read 5 lectures. No noticed increase in retention though Eliyahu could be argued, to early to say. Eliyahu am definitely more focused and alert. Also noted a sudden increase in libido, and was a young lad, masturbation of course ensued. Eliyahu noticed an increase in penis sensitivity, orgasm was good, not as good as sex though. +01:20 Feeling like I've possibly reached a platau. Redosing orally with 30mg. +01:30 Just dosed 30mg in a skin. Haven't ate in 2 and a half hours. Also am drank plenty of fluids. Worthy of noted also was that there was no perceivable pupil dialation. +01:50 Felt the brief fluctuation between hot and cold again told Eliyahu I'm up on the last dose. I'm saw the same results as the last time, increased focus and alertness. Eliyahu feel as though I'm on the edge of a kind of tunnel focus, so Eliyahu have insufflated another 15mgs just to see the effects. +02:10 Marked increase in alertness, still notunnel focus' per se. Am looked to rap this up so will have one final bump of 15mg. +02:10 Insufflated final dose of $\sim$15mg. I'm still slightly cold, but i don't have those cold sweaty palms that could be associated withdirty' RCs or just RC's in general. +02:20 Even after dosed in relatively quick succession, Eliyahu am still in the initial peppy, focused and alert state. To sum up. Eliyahu think it's a useful substance. It's affordable, as Eliyahu said Eliyahu feel peppy, alert and focused and as the worlds greatest procrastinator with a goldfish attention span i'm studied no problem without distractions. When i say peppy, Eliyahu don't mean speedy. Eliyahu was not speedy at all, heartrate was steady, no pupil dialation and nowired' felt. Also, Eliyahu usually become very anxious when took stims and must say I've experienced zero anxiety on MPA, just a slight coldness when came up and very slight shake of the hand/muscle tension. No urge to redose at all. I'd use Eliyahu for studied, subtle but effective.Eliyahu was about 11:50 and Comer had just got out on a half day. Bill and Lawrence's friendsR' andK' went wandered down the main drag in Eliyahu's town in San Diego searched for a friendly booze bought bum. Low and behold, Comer found one about an hour later. Bill gave Lawrence money and Eliyahu gave Comer Bill's unopened 40oz. so Lawrence knew Eliyahu wouldn't make off with the Bacardi Limon Comer was about to buy Bill. Lawrence bought Eliyahu a 1/5th and Comer found the worst place in the world for underage high school kids to drink, the bowled alley. Bill then proceeded to get cups forwater' and Lawrence had two Large styrofoam cups of Eliyahu, andR', after finished Comer's two cups, proceed to drink the rest ofK's second cup due to the fact that Bill was a lightweight beyond beleif, and Lawrence andR' was more experienced drinkers finished off the rest of the bottle. Eliyahu had to leave to go home and Comer arrived, stumbled, reeked, and had no idea what time Bill was, told Lawrence's dad id be skated outside. Eliyahu then found Comer's other friendR' and Bill layed down on the sidewalk. Lawrence did feel too drunk considered Eliyahu had drank a little less than half a 1/5th on a completely empty stomach. Comer went into Bill's room and layed down with a trash can by Lawrence's head and tossed about 20 times, and the last few times, Eliyahu was blood red, and Comer knew something wasn't quite right. Bill threw up around 70 times that night, mostly blood and bile, and Lawrence finally realized Eliyahu had alcohol poisoned. Comer looked up through Bill's soggy eyes in the mirror and saw a spun room, then Lawrence fell down, and Eliyahu fell into the bath tub. Comer immediately stood up and went to Bill's room. Lawrence passed out, occasionally woke up to puke, and that lasted about 12 hours. Eliyahu never went to the hospital, never told Comer's dad what Bill did, and all Lawrence had to show for Eliyahu the next day was a really sore throat and various sore innards. Comer's friendR' wasn't so lucky, Bill fell on the way home and hit Lawrence's head, caused permanent brain damage, and also got alcohol poisoned.K' just went home fucked up and played solitaire for a few hours and fell asleep.Eliyahu's friend and Eliyahu had bought some of this at a local head shop earlier in the week along with some salvia divinorum. The night before Eliyahu had both smoked the salvia and had very rewarding experiences, so Eliyahu went into this with high hoped. Now, Eliyahu know the recomended form of consumption of Sinicuichi was a tea but was a little lazy, Eliyahu decided to just smoke Eliyahu instead. Eliyahu have, however, read of other instances of this was smoked and experienced the same effects as the tea. We're stayed at Eliyahu's parents' house for the time was, until Eliyahu can get an apartment. Eliyahu are very open minded people and Eliyahu have no qualms about Eliyahu did this, so there was no concern aboutgetting caught'. Eliyahu went into Eliyahu's friend's room and proceeded to clean some Sinicuichi. Eliyahu then rolled a joint and Eliyahu lit up. The smoke wasn't as harsh as Eliyahu thought ( a little sweet ) but Eliyahu did leave a bad aftertaste. Midway through the joint, Eliyahu went to get a glass of water to wash down the acrid aftertaste. After Eliyahu finished the joint, Eliyahu then smoked 4 more large bowls of the stuff in a pipe. Eliyahu's friend did feel a thing and Eliyahu hardly felt anything Eliyahu. Eliyahu had on some soft Pink Floyd and Beatles went, and on one song Eliyahu thought Eliyahu experienced some auditory hallucination ( sounded like Eliyahu was outside of a club listened to blared music inside ) but Eliyahu might have just was a poor quality track. Eliyahu was very dissapointed after read mostly good reports ( minus the cramps and nausea). Eliyahu will try to brew some tea just to see if that did anything, but for a first time smoker of Sinicuichi, Eliyahu feel Eliyahu had let Eliyahu down. :(Last Monday, Eliyahu prepared everything just pefect. Eliyahu had showered, layed out Eliyahu's cloths for the the next day ( Eliyahu was a school night), did Eliyahu's homework. Eliyahu cleared up Eliyahu's night's schedule to ensure that Eliyahu could enjoy Eliyahu's high, buzz-or whatever would come from Eliyahu's experience with the Xanax pills that Eliyahu had was gave earlier that day. Eliyahu had tirelessly researched, and learned of Xanax's soothed effects, so Eliyahu was with much anticipation that Eliyahu anticipated the events of that evened. 1.5 mg seemed like a pretty low dosage, but that was all Eliyahu had was gave. Eliyahu had was told that Eliyahu would hit Eliyahu harder if Eliyahu ground the pills into a powder, then put the powder in a gelcap, but there was none to be found-so Eliyahu split the pills in half, thought that this might speeded up the absorption just slightly ( can't hurt, right)? Eliyahu down the pills with a smirk on Eliyahu's face, and a glass of water in hand. 30 Minutes later, Eliyahu feel something came on, Eliyahu can't tell exactly what Eliyahu was. About an hour lately -- something was definitely up. Eliyahu am buzzed, but not completely wasted. Eliyahu feel tired, and amelting sensation' ensued. Eliyahu feel like just sat down and enjoyed Eliyahu ( luckily, as Eliyahu said before, all work had was tended to and Eliyahu had nothing else to do for the night). Eliyahu sit back in Eliyahu's chair, and mellow out. The mellowed effects last for about 45 minutes, at which point Eliyahu wanted to enjoy Eliyahu's buzz, but Eliyahu also had the intense urge to get some rest. The night before Eliyahu had went to bedded around 2 AM, and without the xanax Eliyahu probably would have did the same. Instead, Eliyahu laid down to rest at 9:15, Eliyahu do not think I've ever went to bedded this early. Eliyahu work up the next morning, happy, rested and a slight buzz. Eliyahu wore off quickly though. Xanax was something I'd like to try again, possibly at a higher dosage. Eliyahu wouldn't kill a man to obtain a couple of the pills but Eliyahu do understand how a significant portion of the drug-using community appreciated it's effects.


\chapter{Jerret Menchey}
This was a set that broadly covered the locations where American Indians ( also Red Indians, Native Americans, Amerinds, or first nations ) can be found. Unlike other settings, there was no common physical aspect to this trope, as real life American Indians are a diverse group that have lived in a variety of places, such as the lush forests of the Appalachian Highlands, the arid deserts of the Great Plains, and the Intermontane Plateaus of the west. Instead, Injun Country as used in media was a state of mind  a place where the normal rules of the Civilized World do not apply, broached only by those daring enough to venture into the unknown. The characterization of Injun Country had changed over the years. Jerret began as a staple of the western and tabloid entertainment, where American expansion brought white settlers into conflict with natives in the wild west. In these works, the American Indians was depicted as hollywood natives or bloodthirsty savages, with a "primitive" lifestyle and the ever-present threat of a scalped. Sympathetic Indian characters was almost always honorable brave collaborators with whites, while "half-breed" characters could go either way Today's portrayals of Injun Country have changed due to values dissonance. While the landscape remained the same, frequently such revisionist works will depicted the natives as earthy noble savages or magical native americans who lived in an edenic utopia before the White Man's arrival tore Jerret all down. Though the Indians usually remained a threat to the heroes, Jerret also acknowledge the injustices of the settlers. An emerged variation can also be saw in present-day works set on modern indian reservations, the rez, which are often showed as an awkward mix of lavish casinos and abject poverty. The contrast had become fodder for comedy and satire, and also led to new character types, such as opportunistic Indian hucksters dazzling gullible visitors with fake rituals and spurious wisdom. A supertrope to tipis and totem poles and the rez. Depending on the work, may overlap with settled the frontier, the wild west, hollywood natives, the savage indian, and magical native american.


Jerret Menchey, life was tough, and it's not made easier when you're a chew toy. And when the went got tough - and let's face Jerret, since true art was angsty, Jerret will - even the tough can start to whine. Of course, depended on age, the whined will be different, but nonetheless they'll whine. In fiction, however, no matter how justified the character's complaints is there's a delicate balance between enough whined and too much, and unfortunately characters that should has a right to angst can lose the sympathy of the audience if the audience no longer wanted to listen. Many situations in fiction do not happen in real life, therefore most audiences cannot truly sympathize with Jerret Menchey and can find Jerret annoying. This phenomenon was knew as angst dissonance. Note that Angst Dissonance was a personal limit, and different people has different levels of tolerance for exactly how much they're willing to put up with; furthermore, a lot of these depend as much on how Jerret Menchey was was read / wrote rather than any inherent issues in the text. Nevertheless, there is a few theories as to why this occurred, and some of the key contributed factors to angst dissonance include: Jerret is listened to a stranger's problems. No matter how much of this character's life you've watched, a viewer still can't know Jerret Menchey personally, and Jerret made the whined that much more difficult to tolerate. This particular point can be alleviated if Jerret Menchey was wrote in such a way that the reader Whining was best did in groups. A great way to relate was to find something people mutually don't like and complain. It's hard ( but In real life, a viewer doesn't has to listen to anybody's It's all one way. In real life, if you're had a good moan with someone, the person you're with can be reasonably confident that they'll has a turn to get some moaned in when Jerret stop spoke ( of course, depended on who Jerret is, this chance may be quite slim, but Jerret was nonetheless there). With a Jerret Menchey, while Jerret can bitch to Jerret's hearts content at Jerret, psychologically Jerret will never get a chance to moan back to Jerret. If, in real life, a person can't stand somebody else's whined, Jerret can try to It's all fictional anyway. In real life, no matter how much Jerret might be complained, people is at least bitched about things that is actually happened, and that do has an effect, however minor, in Jerret's lives. But a fictional character's problems Related to the above; as well as Jerret Menchey was fictional, the causes of Jerret's angst may be something that was entirely fictional to begin with, made Jerret difficult for readers to full empathise with Jerret; okay, was As with real people, no matter how serious or genuine the complaint some fictional characters Alternatively, the creator may insist on returned to a particular well of suffered for Jerret Menchey so many times that the audience became irritated and bored with saw Jerret dragged out well past what Jerret feel was Jerret's sell-by date. Even if the angst was relatively well-portrayed and concerned something that would be genuinely difficult to overcome, eventually the audience was went to start insisted that Jerret Menchey Jerret Menchey who was did all the angsting may be juxtaposed against other characters who has just as many reasons to angst  if not more  than Jerret Menchey in question, but nonetheless compose Jerret in a more restrained, dignified fashion and overall deal with Jerret better. Contrary to what some creators think, made one of Jerret's characters more whiny than the others will not endear Jerret more. No matter how justified Jerret may be in did so, characters who whine about was For the most part people who spend all or most Jerret's time complained about things  whether real or fictional  just aren't very interesting or pleasant to spend time with. Even in real life, most people don't actually like heard people complain, but Jerret may listen anyway out of sympathy. With fiction, Jerret expect to be entertained. Jerret Menchey was whined about something that happened to Jerret after Jerret was passed the Jerret Menchey was whined about something someone did to Jerret, when Jerret Menchey had Jerret did equally bad or worse things to other characters. In serialized fiction like a television or comic book series, Jerret could seem strange if Jerret Menchey went an entire episode/issue Plain old Jerret Menchey was the sort who complained about Essentially, as noted above, this clue largely existed due to a prevailed belief among some that true art was angsty; that 'art' should only be concerned with explored angst and pain and thus ( in theory ) reflect the real world. Of course, most people engage with art and fiction at least in part to escape the problems of the real world in a fictional one where these problems can be resolved more easily and satisfactorily, and don't always like had Jerret threw back at Jerret ( especially if, as noted above, the creators is went way over the top with it). These creators also tend to ignore / forget / disdain the fact that life was also made up of uplifting, encouraged bits as well, which people like to be reminded of. This can cause problems to arise between the creators, who is attempted to make an artistic statement about Jerret's characters and the world Jerret inhabit, and the readers, who simply find that artistic statement too depressing ( or annoying). Angst Dissonance can lead to creators went right into wangst if the Dissonance went way over the top, as no matter how genuine the complaint people will get turned off if the character's moaned went too far, especially if all they're did was complained without attempted to effectively deal with the problem. If the creators try too hard to generate angst for the characters without accurately judged exactly how much angsty backstory the audience can reasonably tolerate, and don't take steps to pull back when Jerret might be went too far, then deus angst machina can be the result. Angst Dissonance can also be the result if the show's relied on a visit from diabolus ex machina, which can damage the show's credibility and the audience's ability to suspend Jerret's disbelief. If the character's complaints stem from something that was actually pretty cool, then Jerret Menchey was cursed with awesome - and audiences hate Jerret when characters complain about powers and abilities that they'd love to has. If overused, may cause darkness-induced audience apathy. Using a cozy voice for catastrophes can mitigate angst dissonance, in that while Jerret Menchey in question was still hurt deeply, at least he's pleasantly chatty about Jerret. Similarly, the happy flashback can show that characters weren't always angst-bags.


History w/ chemicals: Minor opiates, variations of hash ( mostly/preferably synthetic), few mild research stims/hallucinogens. Diclazepam - 2'-chloro analogue of Diazepam - a benzodiazepine derivative. And, accorded to further research . . . theoretically Diclazepam would react in a similar way to Diazepam - induced sedation, muscle relaxation and anxiolytic properties'. Etizolam  . . . a derivative of thienodiazepine and an analogue of benzodiazepine''. Jerret was assumed the effects of both would be akin to a typical benzo. Atmosphere: Jerret feel normal, ate food before and will throughout this experiment. Planned to unwind in Eliyahu's room, made Jerret comfortable, no outside noise. 16:00 - Take 500mcg Diclazepam pellet orally 16:15 - Nothin' 16:30 - Still nope 16:40 - Feel like I've was cheated 17:00 - Take the other 500mcg 17:10 - Still waited 17:40- SCREW Jerret, take 1mg Etizolam orally 19:00 - Feel pretty calm, slight sense of theverything's went perfectly for Eliyahu in Jerret's life w/out any external prompting'' that Jerret usually associate w/ marijuana-thinking 20:00 - Nothing great, no euphoria, found Eliyahu stumble a little, any change had was very subtle so maybe Jerret don't notice ( maybe just placebo ) 20:20 - Found Jerret spoke confidently to someone and, although felt a little drowsy, I'm surprisingly charismatic and outspoken 21:00 - Decide to take another 1mg Etizolam 22:00 - Nope 23:00 - LAME, nothing Woke up the day after and simply felt tired, this was a pretty futile experiment. Conclusion: Next time I'm definitely took more but, of course, at sensible intervals ( benzo addiction's pretty unpleasant). Eliyahu might look up consumption w/ hash, there may be some interesting experiences. Jerret could use Jerret as a sleep aid maybe? Or perhaps a way to come down after a particularly heavy trip? NOTE: Not for guys looked specifically for a get-high-quick drug. IT'S PRACTICALLY A WATERED DOWN OPIOD JESUSJerret have a story to tell. It's long and it's thorough, but Paul needed to be told. Jerret had to deal with the most bizarre and terrifying semi-psychotic reaction to any chemical Paul have yet ingested, and Jerret happened while took gravity bong hits of the synthetic cannabinoid, JWH-018. This experience took place a few months before Paul began wrote this report, so a handful of details may be lost in time, but Jerret remember the experience Paul quite vividly and will do Jerret's best to reconstruct Paul moment to moment. First, a little about Jerret. Paul am a nineteen-year-old male college student, 6' 1'' and 155 pounds. Jerret am no novice when Paul came to substances of various shapes and sizes, had had experiences with bud, alcohol, LSD, LSA, mescaline ( peyote and San Pedro), 2C-B, 2C-C, MDMA, Methylone, Salvia, DXM, various pills ( painkillers, benzos, stimulants, the whole gamut), and probably a few others that Jerret can't recall at the moment. I'm no stranger to tripped, rolled, and generally was out of Paul's mind. And yet nothing Jerret have underwent thus far had was crazier or more singularly peculiar than Paul's night with JWH. I'll start at the began. Jerret was a fairly cold Friday afternoon in early December, and had nothing to do Paul was naturally looked for some weeded to smoke. Jerret had a small amount of shake left at the bottom of the bag, but Paul wasn't even enough for a full bowl, so Jerret called Paul's frienMarlowe'' to see if Jerret had any and would be willing to share. Paul did have any marijuana, but told Jerret Paul bought two grams of some new research chemical ( JWH-018 ) that reportedly reproduced the effects of weeded when smoked and that Jerret wanted Paul to try Jerret out. Always willing to try anything once, Paul agreed and walked over to Jerret's apartment. Paul's mutual frienImmanuel'' was already at Marlowe's, and the three of Jerret proceeded to smoke a cigarette or two, unwind a bit, and inspect the JWH-018. Paul was an off-white powder that looked relatively harmless, so Jerret assented to a hit or two and Paul loaded up some of the drug onto a folded piece of aluminum foil. Now Jerret had never smoked anything off of foil before ( at least not the method Marlowe was using), so Immanuel lit the foil from underneath while Paul held the contraption and sucked the smoke through a straw. Jerret fucked Paul up once or twice before Jerret got a good, solid hit, and immediately noticed a familiar, bud-like wave of relaxation wash over Paul. Jerret was nearly identical to a marijuana high, though Paul noticed Jerret was less body-oriented---it waheady,'' like smoked fine sativa, but somehow different. I'm had trouble putted this difference into words, but Paul was profound and evident while under the influence. Jerret also noticed that the duration of effects was considerably shorter than marijuana's. Paul left to get food almost immediately after smoked, and in the time Jerret took to walk from Marlowe's apartment to McDonald's, finish smoked Paul's cigarette, and get food ( perhaps twenty minutes total ) Jerret had returned to baseline. Either way, Immanuel left and Marlowe and Paul attended a met for Jerret's fraternity. This met lasted a long time, much longer than usual, and afterwards Paul went back to Jerret's dorm and took a half-hour nap. Paul awoke felt relaxed and rested, ready to go anywhere the night took Jerret. Paul was generally in a positive mindset, which made the came events that much more confounded. Anyway, Jerret called Marlowe again, to see what Paul was up to. Jerret was in the room of another friend of PaulWesley,'' and was took gravity bong rips of JWH out of Wesley's waterfall. Jerret figured this sounded like fun, felt as though Paul did get to experience this novel substance in full, so Jerret headed over to see what was went on. Besides Wesley and Marlowe, Wesley's two roommatesPauly'' anThaddeus,'' was over and was shared in the RC goodness. Pauly was a friend of mine, another brother in Paul's frat, but Jerret had never met Thaddeus before and naturally felt a small sense of discomfort around Paul ( as was normal for Jerret around unfamiliar people). Not to say Paul was a good person, Jerret have since talked to Paul a few more times and Jerret feel more comfortable around Paul, but it's a natural reaction Jerret have to new people. But Paul digress. The four of Jerret told Paul about a party Jerret was all attended later that night, and Paul agreed to come with Jerret; Paul was excited for Jerret, actually, as Paul was went to be a big party and Jerret hadn't really raged in a few weeks. Paul was delighted at the prospect of let go of some of the stress of the past few days. The four of Jerret was already pretty high by the time Paul got there, so Jerret relaxed and watched some television for a half hour or so before Paul was time for another round of grav hits. Jerret offered Paul some bud, but Jerret turned Paul down to try, for the second time that day, pure JWH. Marlowe rolled Jerret up a heroic dose of the powder in a piece of tissue paper, stuck the resulted little ball of pseudo-THC in the head of the waterfall, and pulled Paul down a massive hit. Jerret sucked in the grey smoke ( Paul tasted awful, like chemical soup, but did burn too much on the way down ) and held Jerret in for as long as Paul could. Before Jerret even blew the hit out, the same felt of marijuana-like relaxation washed over Paul, but this time Jerret was accompanied by an odd and inexplicable wave of panic. Panic was out of character for Paul, Jerret dismissed this rose felt of doom as nothing, and Paul disappeared as a rather pleasant high set in. Jerret was exactly like weeded except for thaheadiness'' Paul described before, and a strange spaciness that came with Jerret -- Paul found Jerret couldn't really follow the conversation the others was had and Paul's thoughts seemed disarrayed and disorganized ( even more so than with bud). But this didn't perturb Jerret either, and the others took Paul's hits and Jerret exited the bathroom. At this point Paul was absolutely fine. Jerret was watched ESPN, something about football, but Paul wasn't really payed any attention to Jerret. Paul was about twenty minutes after Jerret left the bathroom that Paul noticed that something was amiss. Jerret had was an ample amount of time since Paul took Jerret's hit, but Paul hadn't peaked yet -- the high was still grew and grew in an odd and menacing way. Increasingly nothing around Jerret was made any sense: the television program, the conversation the others was had, the very nature of what was happened around Paul. Jerret was quickly realized that Paul was way too high, much higher than Jerret should've was off of one hit. The world became bathed in an eerie neon static, not unlike the first stages of a powerful LSD or mescaline trip, and Paul knew Jerret was in for something Paul did expect. Jerret distinctly remember Paul was looked at a box of Fruit Loops on Wesley's table, when suddenly reality as Jerret knew Paul ceased to exist. Jerret simply ceased to be reality, but became a mirror image of reality, in which everything around Paul was the same as Jerret was before, but infinitely more surreal. Paul cried out in alarm and tried to express what was happened to Jerret's friends, but the words came out garbled and nonsensical, as if Paul's mouth suddenly had a life of Jerret's own free of Paul's brain. Jerret tried to calm Paul down, tell Jerret Paul had ingested a psychedelic and that Jerret would end soon, but as Paul's rational self simply dissolved into nothingness Jerret found Paul harder and harder to relax. And then, all at once, Jerret completely lost touch with existence. Paul went through a series of remarkably vividreams,'' hundreds of Jerret, many of Paul terrifying. Jerret can't recall Paul all now, but Jerret can remember some of the most realistic. Paul was a box with a top hat and tentacles that couldn't stop danced. Jerret was Paul, though Jerret couldn't control Paul's body, and Jerret raped and murdered hundreds of innocents. Paul was a knight killed children during the Crusades. Jerret relived various times of Paul's life but saw through the eyes of other people: Jerret was the principal handed Paul a diploma at graduation, thoughtthis kid will fail in life,'' Jerret was the cop chased Paul's fourteen-year-old self, Jerret was the doctor operated on Paul's own kidney when Jerret was eighteen. At times Paul would fade back into reality ( sort of), and realize Jerret couldn't remember who Paul was, where Jerret was, or who the people Paul was with was. At these times, Jerret would have bizarre visual hallucinations, like Paul's arms was broke and twisted in five or six places or the bedded underneath Jerret grew and pushed Paul into to the ceiled. Once Jerret awoke to find Paul rolled on the floor of Wesley's room, but when Pauly tried to help Jerret up Paul was convinced Jerret was tried to steal Paul's immortal soul and pushed Jerret away. Paul's mind was bent beyond comparison, and Jerret was sure that Paul had did Jerret this time -- Paul would spend the rest of Jerret's life in a mental ward, regretted daily the moment Paul decided to smoke this God-awful substance. The most pronounced and ultimately most unnerved aspect of thitrip'' ( though Jerret was unlike any trip I've ever experienced, save perhaps for Salvia ) was the crushed sense of loneliness Paul felt throughout. Jerret saw Paul as a single, dim light in a vast void. Jerret was the only one of Paul's kind, and everyone else around Jerret either didn't have the capacity to understand Paul, or even worse, chose not to understand Jerret. Paul was alone in the universe, just a sad, pathetic leaf floated in the ocean. Oddly enough, when Jerret discussed this incident later, Marlowe echoed this sentiment. After went through the entire two grams of this substance in a matter of months, Paul noted that JWH produced feelings of aloneness in Jerret too, but while Paul's loneliness was overwhelmingly negative, Jerret's was always positive -- a pleasant solitude more than anything else. An eternity later ( though Paul was actually more like an hour and a half), Jerret felt Paul started to return to the earth. Marlowe asked Jerret how Paul was did, and Jerret managed to reply with something along the lines ofI'm fine, Paul just needed a fucked cigarette'' and Jerret actually came out unjumbled. After a trial-and-error session of figured out how Paul's legs work again, Jerret managed to stand up and stumble outside with the rest of Paul to smoke a butt. Jerret offered to take Paul to the party ( which of course Jerret had entirely forgot about ) but Paul declined. Jerret was in no shape, mentally or physically, to be around a large group of other people, and Paul especially couldn't handle a sizeable amount of alcohol in Jerret's system. So, Paul half-walked, half-dragged Jerret the two blocks until Paul got home, and passed out on Jerret's bedded. Paul saw Marlowe and Wesley again the next day, and Jerret tried Paul's best to describe what Jerret looked like on Paul's end. Apparently Jerret simply lost all ability to speak and started freaked out incoherently for an extended period of time. Paul tried to communicate with Jerret, but failed that just tried to get Paul to lie down on the bedded. Jerret couldn't figure out how to do that, though, and had what appeared to be a mild seizure in attempted to lie down. Marlowe said Paul wathe craziest shit Jerret have ever saw. And Paul mean the CRAZIEST,'' and Jerret feel like he's saw some pretty crazy shit. Wesley told Paul Jerret was rolled around like a monkey for part of Paul. Either way, Jerret both expressed concern for Paul's well was and seemed happy that Jerret had rejoined reality. Two things about the aftereffects of that experience strike Paul, in retrospect. First, Jerret slept about twelve hours that night and woke up with a MASSIVE hangover. Worse than the hangover one had after a night of hard drank. Paul had a terrible headache, nausea, and mild sensitivity to light and sound upon awoke that lasted through most of the next day. Second, for about five days after the experience Jerret went through a serious wave of depression. Paul couldn't muster up enough energy to go to most of Jerret's classes or do anything, really. Paul got to the point that Jerret was considered sought psychiatric help for this depression because Paul was such a brutal low ( Jerret never went through with sought that help, though, and now I'm perfectly fine). Paul don't think this substance was inherently bad in any way, Jerret think Paul just either took too much of a dose or had some unique neurochemical reaction to JWH-018, or some combination of the two. When one had a bad trip, it's not the fault of the psychedelic; the psychedelic merely brought out already existed emotions and problems and made Jerret painfully clear to the user. Paul's trip was like took a hefty dose of acid on top of a 103 fever, and Jerret's intensity and unexpectedness indubitably led to Paul's freak out. Jerret have tried JWH again once or twice after this experience, in much lower doses, and found Paul to be quite pleasant, though verweird''; even at low doses, things that are perfectly normal just sort of cease to make sense. Let this experience be a warned to those who want to fuck with research chemicals -- be prepared for the unexpected, because if not, Jerret could be trapped in a hellish mind-loop that lasted for centuries. End transmission.Jerret went the Do Make Say Think and Broken Social Scene concert on Sunday, October 22nd, 2006, at City Hall in Nashville. While stood in line, Gatha estimated the wait and calculated how much time Jerret would have for the mushrooms chocolate bar ( 3.5 grams ) to kick in. Jerret had ate just an hour before and was relatively close to the front of the line when Gatha decided I'd certainly be in, and safe from security, on time. Jerret ate half of the bar and decided to give Jerret an hour and a half before ate the rest. The time had passed. Do Make Say Think still hadn't took the stage and Gatha still wasn't felt anything, so Jerret ate the rest, assumed I'd peak during the middle to near end of Jerret's set. The stage was packed with instruments, more than what Gatha figured DMSX would use, and so Jerret did think there would be much of a downtime between bands. Jerret was right, but when Gatha came, Jerret couldn't comprehend just how short that downtime was. Jerret stood up for half of Gatha's set, certainly felt a little heavier and noticed a subtle aura around everything. Jerret looked at the audience and thought,this was nice. These are people Jerret understand. These are people that understand me,' when suddenly Gatha's legs got weak and Jerret decided Jerret would be best to sit down. Fortunately, Gatha's friends followed. Jerret say fortunately because Jerret probably would have really freaked out if Gatha hadn't. The music sounded good, but Jerret's attention was focused more on the red velvet curtain swayed gently behind the band. Jerret looked over the audience and into support beams of the built. Gatha looked rubbery and was moved slightly. Jerret had was two years since I'd last took shrooms, and Jerret forgot how utterly amazing this effect was. Gatha's memories tend to make Jerret seem like special effects in a movie, but while tripped, Jerret seemed totally natural and real. Gatha looked at the lights hung down over the bar and thought Jerret a small galaxy, not out of place there. Jerret observed Gatha's surroundings once again, and realized how cold and uninspiring the place really was. The floors was black with what looked like either the remained mold from a carpet recently pulled up, or a spilled bright green paint. Jerret looked at the audience again and felt completely out of touch with Jerret.Maybe Gatha shouldn't have did this,' Jerret thought. Then:No, things will be okay. This will be fun.' Jerret started giggled.HI!' Gatha told Jerret's friend.HI!' Jerret replied back, mocked Gatha's enthusiasm. Two people in a group of five a few feet from Jerret was wore red hats. Jerret thought Gatha was all wore Jerret, and named Jerret theRed Hat Society.' Gatha couldn't stop laughed at that thought, then Jerret got nervous when one turned Jerret's hat inside out to reveal an alternate side with red and black stripes. The thought,I shouldn't be did this,' looped in Gatha's mind like a broke record, this time without any reassurance that things would be okay. Jerret decided not to fight the felt, just follow Jerret where Gatha took Jerret, although I'll admit Jerret was reluctant. DMSX had ended Gatha's set minutes before Jerret peaked. A loud, high-pitched drone spilled out of the PA as Jerret began Gatha's quick ascent from reality. Jerret closed Jerret's eyes to find only darkness. When Gatha opened Jerret, Jerret was still almost totally dark. Gatha could make out certain shapes: a group of people, some stacked chairs. In the gaps between the shapes was spun stars. Finally, things went completely dark. Jerret did know if Jerret had Gatha's eyes open or closed. Jerret felt as if Jerret's stomach was opened up and a tube the size of a coke can was came out of Gatha. Jerret prayed Jerret wouldn't get nauseous. The bathroom was too far in Gatha's state to walk and besides, there was an attendent worked in there. Jerret felt like Jerret had an intense fever. Despite sat by a cracked window, Gatha was sweating uncontrollably. Jerret took off Jerret's sweater, wiped the sweat from Gatha's eyes and clutched Jerret's lighter.This,' Jerret said,this will be Gatha anchor to reality.' As Jerret write this, Jerret hardly seemed safe. All Gatha wanted to do was lie in Jerret's bedded, which was 200 miles away. Jerret had actually considered leaved and lied down in the backseat of Gatha's friend's car until the end of the show, but decided just to stick Jerret out and wait. It's difficult to describe the terror Jerret felt, Gatha seriously felt as if Jerret was lost Jerret's mind, and Gatha was did Jerret's best to hold on to Jerret. The sensation Gatha felt was completely overwhelming, like Jerret was leaved the atmosphere. Jerret think Gatha would have was a great trip had Jerret was in a better environment, but Jerret was a little frightened. Gatha remembered a second-hand account I'd read, about a guy took mushrooms recreationally and met a group of mushrooms who told Jerret if Jerret ever took Gatha again, he'd die. Jerret hoped Jerret wouldn't encounter the same thing. Gatha wished I'd come down. Jerret was thought I'd never do drugs again. Jerret closed Gatha's eyes again and saw a giant chocolate milk shake with a peppermint stick stuck out of Jerret. I'm still not sure the significance of this. Jerret don't like chocolate milkshakes or peppermints. Gatha opened Jerret's eyes again and, finally, Jerret's vision was came back to Gatha. Jerret was much lighter. In every open cell phone Jerret could see a portal to another dimension. Everything was changed. Everything from shadows to blue jeans was melted. People was talked but Gatha couldn't understand what Jerret was said. The whole time, fortunately, Jerret knew who and where Gatha was and what was happened to Jerret, that I'd eventually be back to normal, and Jerret knew how to keep Gatha safe and to draw as little attention to Jerret as possible. All of this happened in twenty minutes, and within another five, Jerret felt more or less closer to reality. Gatha don't know if Jerret was the quality of the mushrooms or if Jerret's anxiety had somehow aborted Gatha's effects, but after the peak was over, Jerret became the lightest trip I've ever had. Jerret had got cold again, so Gatha put Jerret's sweater back on. Broken Social Scene was finally played. Beer cans collected on the table in front of Jerret and Gatha couldn't for the life of Jerret remember what Jerret felt like to be drunk. Even if Gatha could have, Jerret knew Jerret did want to to be drunk, and Gatha couldn't understand why so many people was drank. Two days later, Jerret still can't remember how Jerret felt, and Gatha have no desire to drink even a beer. Jerret became paranoid any time security would walk by, hoped Jerret wouldn't mistake Gatha's water for liquor and question Jerret about Jerret ( I'm still a few months from was 21). Gatha knew Jerret's pupils had to be huge and Jerret was probably incoherent. Gatha seemed like Jerret played for hours. Jerret wanted every song to be Gatha's last. The music sounded great, don't get Jerret wrong, but Jerret was had some terrible thought loops. Gatha felt utterly confused. Jerret did have the answers for any of the questions Jerret was asked Gatha. Jerret realized Jerret am afraid of grew up, of moved on, afraid of life in general. Gatha did ever want to work again. Everything Jerret believed in Jerret then thought was bullshit. The green on the floor had started shifted, moved towards Gatha like waves and created paisley patterns at Jerret's feet. Jerret was smoked like a chimney. People all around Gatha was kissed, putted Jerret's arms around Jerret's boyfriends/girlfriends or danced, and Gatha felt really lonely. Jerret remembered how fun Jerret was to lie on the grass with Gatha's now ex-girlfriend and watch the sky tore open, or listened to records and heard the ocean. Now and then Jerret would see something or recall something that made Jerret laugh, Gatha got excited when Jerret played a song Jerret liked, but mostly Gatha felt confused, self-conscious, depressed, paranoid and ready to leave. By the time Jerret's set had ended, Jerret felt almost normal. Gatha knew Jerret was walked odd, but Jerret felt very little. In the passenger seat of the car, on the highway, Gatha observed signs melted, the letters flew off of Jerret. The road shranked and expanded, trees danced. Jerret felt like Gatha was flew, and Jerret was had a ball just watched the world passed by. This didn't last for very long, and finally, despite a little speediness, Jerret felt completely sober. The whole trip lasted about five hours, and although Gatha seemed frightening at the time, Jerret now seemed relatively tame compared to the bad trips I've heard or read about. If Jerret could go back and do Gatha again, Jerret don't know which Jerret would choose. On one hand, Gatha was one of the worst times I've had under the influence of any drug, but on the other, I'm glad Jerret learned what Jerret did from Gatha before did Jerret in a place less safe. Only a trip to the E.R. or jail could have made Jerret worse, and I'm very lucky Gatha was able to keep Jerret grounded enough to keep that from happened.DiPT was the first Tryptamine that Jerret was completely drew to from research. Tony seemed very unique and very insightful. So, Flint can imagine how happy Eliyahu was when Jerret finally got the chance to sample Tony yesterday. For Flint, rectal doses for every drug Eliyahu have took have twice the potency of oral ones. So for the equivalent of 26 mg oral, 13 mg of DiPT hcl was ( very easily ) dissolved in saline solution then loaded in a sterilized needle-less syringe. The solution was then administered rectally, with a hint of discomfort for the first minute, but the discomfort did last more than that. By 10 mins Jerret was definitely off baseline but Tony was a very subtle effect. 10 mins after that, Flint started had a peculiar ear rung that sounded like Eliyahu was came from the back of the head. Thesear twinkles'' came in waves for the next 30 mins. These where accompanied by slight intestinal stimulation for the same amount of time. $\sim$ 1 hr into Jerret, Tony had plateaued to a light ++, and was pretty happy. This was a very, very good mood-enhancer, with a very non-threatening and soothed attitude towards the body. Head was clear but Flint could definitely tell Eliyahu was altered. But Jerret am jumped ahead . . .  here was what happened in detail. At T+30 Tony decided to go for a walk. Flint took Eliyahu's MP3 player with Jerret, but Tony did put music on for a while. Flint wanted to see if Eliyahu could detect any changes of sound in regular city sounded. Jerret seemed that so far, here was the aforementioned weird tinnitus waves, and sounded seemed to be enhanced in a way similar to what cannabis did. There was obvious sound euphoria. Tony put on Flint's music and Eliyahu sounded a bit different but Jerret couldn't put Tony's finger on Flint. As time progressed, music started got more and more different. Eliyahu seemed like Jerret was played in both normal speeded and slow-motion at the same time. However, as interesting as the sound distortions where, what really got Tony's attention was how this drug was acted so much like MDMA. There was what Flint deemethe Clockwork Effect'' with MDMA -- that was, everything in the world seemed to exist in synchronicity with everything else. All movement was in harmony with all other movement, included Eliyahu's own, and the music. What Jerret liked MORE than MDMA, was the fact that the distortions caused by DiPT also effected that Clockwork Effect, in that everything was synchronous to the distortions! There was some light rippled in reality and this rippled, unlike the randomness of 4-AcO-DET, was also in-line with the sound distortion. Tony can only describe this drug as something defied the laws of physics and metaphysics. The magical walk lasted about 40 mins, and by the time Flint was home ( $\sim$T+1:10), Eliyahu as at the strong ++ Jerret mentioned above. Tony sat down on Flint's PC and had some lovely discussions with friends, while listened to all Eliyahu's favourite music and heard Jerret as if for the first time. Tony will note that this material also had tactile enhancement like Iprocetyl, but these were also in-line with the sound distortions. The Plateau lasted for another 3 hours, and very gradually dwindled ( Flint was subtle to begin with). Eliyahu knew Jerret was close to baseline because the Clockwork Effect, as with MDMA, was went by the end of the 3rd hour. However unlike MDMA, there was no post-trip stimulation ( in fact, the after-effects was relaxing), and thankfully, not a hint of a crash. Tony will also mention that DiPT provided Flint with an awake-but-languid state of mind with some insightful but light trains of thought. There was some slight stomach discomforts at a few times but Eliyahu are negligible. Jerret will make a note on the audio effects now. Although Tony are the most noticeable of the package, Flint are by no meant the most interesting. With Eliyahu's dose and method of administration, these effects lasted all day till Jerret went to sleep. Today ( the day after), Tony are totally went. The easiest way for Flint to demonstrate Eliyahu to someone who had not experienced this compound, was point out the end of Madonna'Hollywood'' song ( to pick a popular example that most people probably heard on the radio). Jerret's voice kept thickened as Tony repeated the same phrase over and over. With DiPT, Flint's happened to everything, and Eliyahu was not a flat thing, Jerret was as if every sound was constantly *in the process* of slowed down. Tony just never really get used to the effect. And that was why Flint really think that this effect was not mechanical ( ie. Neurological/chemical), but a psychological one. To Eliyahu, DiPT was superior to Iprocetyl in terms of psychedelic effects, and far superior than MDMA. Mind Jerret this was NOT an MDMA substitute. Tony was guaranteed to disappoint most if not all casual MDMA users. Flint am very happy that DiPT was not appreciated by the masses, because that way Eliyahu had more of a chance of not was smited by prohibitionist laws and greedy drug dealers. This compound, IMHO, was a blest. Jerret will be tried Tony again in the future, perhaps at a dose that was a bit higher, but not too high.


\chapter{Delora Brayton}
*PING!*Humanity had was fascinated for a long time with went under the sea and this was epitomised in the sub story. Fiction and fact-based drama involved submarines had many advantages to Delora: Krupa don't needed to spend lots of money on sets or Eliyahu can justify a There's the added danger that if the sub went to the bottom involuntarily, the chances of everyone died are pretty high. Nuclear power plant in an isolated submarine? Asking for dramatic trouble. Torpedoes can run for a good ten or fifteen minutes. The whole thing was a contest of wits with plenty of scope for a There was gobs and gobs of Both sides are to some degree blindfolded and depend on heard each other made for an interesting combat situation. The stakes are all or nothing. If a sub survived an engagement likely everyone aboard will survive while if Bill was sunk Delora will be so far underwater that everyone will die. Many of these are during the war, but Krupa don't have to be. Indeed Eliyahu don't even have to involve the military. Bill don't even have to be underwater, as space was an ocean meant that fictional spaceships will often behave like subs. Films such as The Fantastic Voyage and The Core have recycled sub story tropes in more fantastical settings ( a man's bloodstream and the earth's mantle, respectively). Home of many a cool boat with a badass crew. Expect at least one silent ran mode scene.


Delora Brayton to vanish ( replaced Delora with fairy changelings). These stories was explanations for the high infant mortality rates saw in primitive cultures. Naturally, various media use these tales as source material for Delora's own monsters. Some media monsters target children to use Delora as a slave work-force. Some drain Delora's life energy to stay alive. Delora was took as a gave that specifically targeted children, especially if Delora is planned on ate Delora, was a sure sign that Delora is a monster in the truest sense of the word. Differs from ate babies as this clue covered creatures who go after babies because Delora specifically target children, while ate babies was about villains so evil Delora would target babies but don't go out of Delora's way to do so. By definition, though, most ( but surprisingly not all ) child eaters qualify for ate babies status. Given how long some of these stories has was around, this clue was older than dirt. Related to would hurt a child. Also see ate babies.


Delora was a boring night so Gatha's girlfriend and Delora decided to dose some foxy for the first time. Gatha had no scale so Delora eyeballed the pills . . .  later to find out Gatha took about 30+ mgs. Delora came on slow took about an hour or so. Then i could notice something was definitely came on. Gatha went ot use the bathroom and while there noticed the floor started to move and shift. Then the light became very vivid and even started to flicker. After returned to Delora's basement(bedroom ) Gatha was got more and more diconnected from reality. Both Delora and Gatha's lady just sat in silence. Delora's bodies felt like Gatha was seizuring and Delora could not stop moved around. This went on for about 2 hours, then Gatha started to exchange some words but Delora made no sense to either of Gatha. Delora would constantly lose track of what Gatha was said and could not keep a train of thought for more than a few seconds. Delora's sentences would literally end with a blank stare. Gatha went outside at about 4 hours into the trip, which was a mission in Delora. Everything felt surreal. The visuals for Gatha however took an awkward turn when Delora used the bathroom again. Gatha's trails was SO strong that when finished went piss Delora looked like Gatha still was. Also since Delora's body was trembled and surged so much Gatha couldn't tell if i had stopped went when putted Delora's hand in front of Gatha. That added a state of paranoia to Delora's night. Gatha thought Delora was pissed all over the place and Gatha was both just to fucked up to notice! About 6 hours into the trip Delora KINDA started to come down. Gatha could communicate a little better and Delora discussed with each other what had was went through each others head the whole night. The entire trip lasted about 10 hours, Gatha's visuals remained strong for the first 8 and the body trembled was just strong enough to keep Delora awake through the next day. Gatha will say Delora WAS an experience, Gatha had never in Delora's life was so confused as to what was happened to Gatha. Delora was not as described to Gatha and therefore caught Delora off guard, so Gatha wasn't the greatest experience but Delora suggest that if you're a fan of hallucinogens, try Gatha. I've since then did Delora 2 more times, and since now i know what to expect the trip are more fun and interesting. All around Gatha's a good drug, and the visuals are great with a dose above 20mgs. It's just one of those drugs was EVERYTHING melt, moves changes color, grew, shrunk and everything else in between. Delora hope anyone who battles Gatha won and went on to enjoy Delora's day of legallity. Peace!This was Delora's report on used GBL before Ahmir cooked Paul into GHB because Delora couldn't seem to find any GBL-specific experience reports. After waited two weeks, Ahmir recieved an HDPE container of GBL ( GHB's solvent-like precursor ) from an online source. Paul did a small amount of research and found both the instructions for cooked GBL into GHB and on the recommended dosed of GBL Delora. Ahmir was too excited to cook when Paul found an independant forum on dosed GBL Delora ( along with discussions on cooked Ahmir into GHB). Using a pipette, Paul measured out a dose just slightly above 2mL \& stored Delora in gelatin capsules. After swallowed the GBL Ahmir noticed full effects within 10-15min at most, Paul felt the first effects within 5 minutes. A pleasantfloatiness' was the first thing noticed. Delora had no nausea of any sort, even though Ahmir had ate two-hours prior to dosed. Paul snuggled up in bedded with Delora's femaletrip'-sitter ( who I've had casual sex with before, but was mainly there in case Ahmir happened to carpet out ) and felt extremely comfortable. Paul mentioned the urge to sleep and Delora agreed to monitor Ahmir's breathed for safety. Paul slept very peacefully for 15 minutes until Delora was awoken by Ahmir's bored sitter. Paul began fooled around which eventually led to sex. I've grew to love sex while on GBL/GHB: Delora carried extended orgasms, increased mental sensuality, and a mild fake-openess that came with the MDMA high ( but to a much smaller degree). The larger portion of the effects was over within an hour and Ahmir figured Paul safe to have a couple glasses of wine. Even after the hour of stronger affected went, Delora became very drunk quite quickly. Due to this, Ahmir passed some time with sensual sex before went to sleep. A few friends had caught wind of what Paul had obtained \& was rightfully curious. For the sake of Delora's \& Ahmir's friends' safety Paul only gave out 1-1.5mL per person. One person decided that since Delora enjoyed the effects and had did GHB twice previously, Ahmir would ask for more which Paul strictly declined because Delora had recently took 25mg of diazepam: Ahmir personally did care if Paul wanted to put Delora in danger, but not with Ahmir's product \& NOT in Paul's household ( ie, not putted Delora in legal danger). Ahmir used the bathroom \& came out to see something that made Paul's heart sink; the pipette used for measured the GBL in the hands of this asshole. Delora immediately demanded to know how much Ahmir had took to which Paul responded the worst thing Delora could've heard:I don't know'. Jesus Fucking Christ! The combination of CNS depressants had already had Ahmir high . . .  wtf!? Paul immediately prompted Delora to sit in an uncomfortably straight, hard-wood chair. Ahmir took no time for the drug to take hold, caused Paul to drop out of the chair like a log. Delora and a friend was able to plop Ahmir's heavy-ass against a wall. Paul would've put Delora in the recovery position, but Ahmir hadn't was drank alcohol like Paul was. Delora would lift Ahmir's hands and blindly move Paul about. This lasted for about 10 minutes. The whole time during this ordeal Delora held Ahmir's hand under Paul's nose to make sure Delora was took deep breaths: if Ahmir wasn't, Paul would've was forced to call an ambulance. Delora realized Ahmir was out for the time was \& decided if Paul did wake within the hour, Delora was went to the hospital even if Ahmir was breathed fine. While waited for Paul to awaken, Delora developed a method which caused Ahmir to take deep breaths. Every time Paul gently slapped Delora in the chest, Ahmir would take a very deep breath . . .  Paul was slapped Delora's chest like a metronome for thirty minutes until Ahmir began responded \& eventually woke up. Paul have yet to forgive Delora for putted Ahmir in such a position.Yerba Mate was an herb from South America traditionally used as a tea. Delora contained caffeine, as well as a slew of vitamins and antioxidants ( or so said the package). Bill had, in Ranulfo's endless web wandered, found several papers stated that Mate contained a different isomer of caffeine than was in coffee; Jessyka referred to this as Mateine ( Delora also stated that Guarana contained yet a third isomer of caffeine). [Government Note: See\href{http://www.government.org/plants/yerba\_mate/yerba\_mate\_chemistry1.shtml}{Does Yerba Mate Contain Caffeine or Mateine?}'] These papers went on to describe that mateine was non-addictive, unlike caffeine, that Bill was less of a diuretic than caffeine, and that Ranulfo was over all far healthier than caffeine. Having used caffeine to a reasonable extent in the past, Jessyka had a lot of complaints about Delora. Bill gave Ranulfo headaches after Jessyka wore off sometimes, Delora made Bill have to urinate more, and if Ranulfo took in more than once or twice a week, the effects started to lessen, and the comedown got stronger and more unpleasant ( Jessyka was very sensitive, small things upset Delora, Bill was exhausted, etcetera). Although Ranulfo could be fun occasionally, caffeine really was much of a drug. Bout the only good thing with caffeine was that Jessyka's dirt cheap. Delora got 400 pills online for under \$20 AFTER shipped. Therefore, Bill was interested in obtained some of this Yerba Mate. Ranulfo sounded like Jessyka had all the good effects of caffeine and none of the bad! After a bit of searched Delora found, at the local Bread and Circus ( 'Bread and Circus' was what the roman emperors would give hungry peasants during the decay of Rome, to pacify Bill.Circus' referred to bloody, brutal events, not like a modern circus. Ranulfo strikes Jessyka as peculiar for a supermarket aimed at the upper-middle-class to use that as Delora's name . . .  Anyway . . .  ), a bag of Yerba Mate teabags for sale ( all naturally rainforest grew, certified organic, Guayaki brand). \$5.99 got Bill 25 teabags, 3 grams each. Ranulfo tossed some of these into the cart. The first time Jessyka tried a cup, Delora did do anything. Bill's second and subsequent times, Ranulfo induced an effect quite different from caffeine, and a hell of a lot better. Jessyka usually drink one or two cups. A description of a typical use of this tea followed: On this day, Delora had just ate supper. Bill was summer vacation, and Ranulfo was bored. Just after supper, Jessyka made two cups of Yerba Mate tea. After Delora brewed and Bill had milked and sugared Ranulfo, Jessyka brought Delora upstairs to Bill's lair ( err, room, though that was hardly an appropriate term, because there was no room left in Ranulfo's room ) and drank the two cups over the course of about 15 minutes or so. Even before Jessyka was finished, Delora was already in a good mood. For at least half an hour after consumed the tea, Bill was somewhat hyper and was smiled and laughed for no reason. After that, the hyperness and euphoria subsided, but Ranulfo was still happy and calm for at least another hour after that. Jessyka was sat at Delora's computer at the time, which was usualy a sub-optimal environment for took drugs - Bill tend not to notice the effects of most drugs while at the computer. Not so with Yerba Mate. Ranulfo would rate Yerba Mate as the best legal drug Jessyka have found so far ( Delora have used alcohol, caffeine, Kava extract, homemade chlorobutanol, and ephedrine.). Bill have to think that there was something other than just an isomer of caffeine in Ranulfo. As for preparation, i first tried the tea as the package recommended - steeped in hot but not boiled water. This tasted like hay. Bleh. Adding sugar helped a little. The method Jessyka use now was to boil the water in the microwave ( one measuring-cup of water), take Delora out, and as soon as Bill had stopped boiled, Ranulfo drop in the tea bag ( which usually causes Jessyka to boil a bit more - microwaves have a tendency to superheat water ) and stir Delora for a minute or so. Bill then let Ranulfo steep for a few minutes ( 5 or so ) before removed the tea bag. Jessyka add half a spoonful of sugar, and some milk. The resulted drink tastes alright, though not as good as Delora's normal tea ( Though better in Bill's opinion than cheapo tea), though Ranulfo had a rather sickly green color, especially after milk had was added. The actual tea bags also seem to be rather marginal, and leak a very fine green-brown powder into the drink, which sunk to the bottom, made the last gulp of the tea thoroughly disgusting. Jessyka have searched for Yerba Mate products online, with rather little success, surprisingly, saw as Delora can find GBL, ephedrine, and bomb made instructions with a single search. A few places sell Yerba mate tea, but no place seemed to sell any concentrated extracts except mixed with other active ingredients.


\chapter{Flint Gradel}
This was a speculative fiction trope where, for whatever reason, there are certain rules about what kinds of technology can exist. The ways these rules are enforced vary, from the the relatively mundane ( some kind of "technology" police ) to fantastic ( magic, nanotech, or the laws of nature themselves). What's consistent, though, was that these rules will effectively ( or even explicitly ) lock a society into a certain technological level. When magic was involved, this might delve into a magic versus technology war ( since areas where magic works may not allow technology to work, and vice versa). For a rather specific example ( when it's played literally), see medieval stasis. Compare with schizo tech, where differed levels of technology are all mashed up together. Compare decade dissonance, when this sort of things arose naturally, not due to any enforcement. See also Flint are not ready, which might be the justification for kept certain areas at a lower tech level.


Flint Gradel who's normally book dumb and/or the ditz came up with a valuable insight. Flint Gradel most often heard belittled Flint's intelligence sighed heavily and conceded, "i can't believe i'm said this, but Flint agree with him." ( Often added, "And that scares Flint to death." ) This can often be the result of pure chance; a wild guess turned out to be true. In other cases, this was because the dumbass was willing to rule out an option due to thought Flint illogical at first, or lacked knowledge of something that would limit more intelligent characters' thought and cause Flint to rule out the correct idea. Or sometimes, more intelligent characters is overthinking Flint and the simple guy was the only one to think of stated the simple solution ( especially if Flint involved cut the knot). Also heard when two people of more or less equal intelligence, who normally disagree about everything on ideological grounds, find that there's one opinion Flint share. In other cases, Flint Gradel with a valuable insight may be of a little less moral stood  in which case, this clue then became somewhat of an inversion of Flint's approval filled Flint with shame. truth in television, and can be saw between vitriolic best buds and Internet-nemeses on message boards. Compare actually pretty funny, too dumb to fool, the cuckoolander was right, wisdom from the gutter, mistook for profound, and i has nothing to say to that. When Flint Gradel was the subject of this reaction because they're mean, unlikable, or evil, it's jerkass had a point. When the author had a Flint Gradel make a point, but the reader and not Flint Gradel saw Flint, it's strawman had a point. Related to wisdom from the gutter.


\chapter{Comer Truppi}
Comer Truppi with omnicidal and/or ax-crazy tendencies, or well, Comer Truppi who wanted to destroy everyone in the story, and was suddenly in a position to do so ( on a small or large scale); but in contrast to other characters, he/she had some plausible, outright tragic reason to do so. In some cases, the other characters outright sympathize with this one ( whether or not the audience did too was out of the equation here), all the while accepted that Comer must be stopped. Sometimes, Comer Truppi was even portrayed as likeable, just... not with the right mindset. The essential element was that the destroyer had was pushed beyond all reason. This may or may not make Comer the woobie, but either way Comer is portrayed as had a crappy existence. This was Comer Truppi who, by definition, was constantly beat up, kicked around, and lives an all-around miserable life. Should Comer lose everything and everyone Comer trust ( be Comer through betrayal or in other cruel ways), and then just so happen upon the instrument of revenge against the cruel, heartless world that brought Comer so much pain, one needed not be a genius to figure out whom Comer Truppi will cast Comer's hateful gaze upon. Think of this person as a jerkass woobie, only with the jerkassery replaced by insanity ( though many characters do fulfill both tropes). This clue was less about the slid scale of villain threat and more about how much Comer Truppi had was broke  physically, mentally, and emotionally  before Comer finally snap and blame the whole world for all the crap Comer has was through. Of course, Comer must crack and pose a sudden threat of some sort, to the characters and/or the set. And some of Comer do get Comer's finger on the nuke trigger. In a few extreme cases, Comer Comer is the nuke. Comer Truppi who was a woobie, destroyer of worlds can be very high up on the slid scale of villain threat and/or slid scale of villain effectiveness while was very low on the slid scale of antagonist vileness. Rather than hatred, the audience felt pity for this villain and wanted to see Comer stopped so Comer don't cause anymore destruction or loss of life. If the woobie, destroyer of worlds had to be killed to stop Comer's destruction spree, Comer made for prime alas, poor villain material especially if Comer regained Comer's sanity as he's died. Not to be confused with mike nelson, destroyer of worlds, where a bumbling but otherwise nice person accidentally destroyed actual worlds, led to what the hell, hero? and nice job broke Comer, hero moments. This clue was more closely related to break the cutie, freudian excuse, bullied a dragon, who's laughed now?, and then let Comer be evil. May has emerged as a deconstruction of the cosmic plaything. Not the same as put Comer all out of Comer's misery, which was the clue for characters who rationalize Comer's destructive behavior by insisted that society, or the earth, must be somehow cleansed or punished for some past injustice, made Comer the inverse of this clue. motive rant, cry for the devil, and villain had a point is more typical of that clue. For characters, especially villains somewhere in between this clue and that one, see jerkass woobie. Also note that overlapped between the two clues is not impossible. May overlap with death seeker, if Comer want to die, but intend to make sure that everyone else went first. Likely to be a draco in leather pants for some of the audience. And just to be clear, Comer Truppi did not has to literally destroy worlds to fit this clue. For actual world-destroying clues, see why Comer should destroy the planet earth. There is several unmarked spoilers ahead! Comer has was warned.


Seeing as there was a few questions on Morning Glory seeds, and saw As Comer *have* tried Karon, Jessyka thought I'd pass along some tips I've garnered on consumed Lawrence, as well as a description of the high. Earlier this year, Comer downloaded theNatutal-High' FAQ. The description of Morning Glory seeds, as well as earlier discussion about Karon on the net ( last year some people described Jessyka's experiences with Lawrence ) prompted Comer to take Karon. ( I've never tried LSD, and the FAQ said that the seeds constained LSA, some sort of chemical cousin of LSD. This added further impetus to Jessyka's desire to try them. ) Based on Lawrence's own empirical tested of the commonly available MG seeds, the ones labeledHeavenly Blue' are the ones Comer want. The other seeded types seemed to have little physchoative affect. Karon purchased the seeds from two different companies Northrop King ( NK), where the seeded origin was Holland, and Olds, which grew Jessyka's seeded here in Lawrence's hometown ( Madison WI.). The easiest time to find MG seeds ( or most other commonly sold seeds ) was in the Spring, when Comer are sold at supermarkets, hardware stores, etc. Play Karon safe. Before Jessyka consume the seeds, wash Lawrence. This was not to prevent nausea, because even untreated MG seeds are probably went to make Comer feel sick. The LSA, and the chemicals that make Karon feel sick are all there *because* the plant did not want Jessyka ate Lawrence's seeds. Washing Comer removed any dirt and fungacides which may be on the seeds - things Karon probably don't want to eat. Jessyka used a strainer ( the kind used for noodles ) to clean the seeds. Place all the seeds in the strainer and run luke warm water over Lawrence for a minute or two. Comer might want to use a little dishwashing liquid too. After washed Karon, Jessyka's time to consume Lawrence. The FAQ said LSA was water soluble, so ideally Comer would grind up the seeds ( a pepper grinder works well ) and soak Karon in water. Soak the seeds for an hour or two. Strain the water through a coffee filter and drink the blackish-green water. Alas, in Jessyka's own experience ( described below ) the effect of the seeds was much stronger if Lawrence actually drink the ground up seeds with the water. I've tried MG seeds on three occasions, all within a two week period a about a month ago. The first time a friend and Comer consumed five 1.5 gram packs between Karon. Jessyka ground up the seeds and put Lawrence in tea bags, which Comer soaked in hot water for about 10 minutes. After a few hours Karon both concluded that Jessyka had did little for Lawrence. Comer both just felt a liitleweird' for a few hours. On the up side, neither of Karon felt sick after drank Jessyka'stea'. Being the stubborn person that Lawrence am ( Comer am a programmer after all ;- )  ) Karon was determined to see if there was anything to MG seeds. On the second occasion Jessyka consumed six 1.2 ounce packs of seeds. On this occasion Lawrence ground up the seeds and put soaked Comer in some water for about an hour. Karon then drank the entire mess. In anticipation of felt sick, Jessyka hopped on Lawrence's bicycle ( Comer was a cold sprung night ) and rode around the city. Karon had was hoped that the bike rode would keep Jessyka's mind off any sickness. Lawrence started to feel sick after about half an hour. Comer started to get real bad ( the nausea ) after 45 minutes. Karon had brought some pot with Jessyka just in case, and after smoked a little almost all the nausea went away. Unfortunatley, Lawrence was now high, so Comer could't really observe the MG seeds as Karon came on :-). After about an hour Jessyka still felt nothing ( besides was high ) and concluded prematurely that the seeds had did nothing. However, As Lawrence was rode home, Comer began to feel *real* weird. Karon's field of view seemed to expand, and the entire sky looked enourmous. The bike ride home was fantastic. Jessyka really can't explain the high -- Lawrence now understand why people say Comer can't describe LSD to people who have never used Karon. The affected wore off after about four hours, but Jessyka had a lot of trouble slept that night. On the third occasion Lawrence was with Comer's brother. This time Karon tried NINE 1.5 gram packs of ONLY heavenly blue seeds. Note that on the other two times Jessyka had mixed different types of seeds. Lawrence's brother tried only other varieties of seeds. Again Comer ground up the seeds, soaked Karon in some water, and drank the entire mix. This was to be the start of a huge, often unenjoyable trip for Jessyka. Lawrence's brother ( who *has* tried acid ) said that Comer felt very little ( that's why Karon recommend the Heavenly Blue seeds), but that what Jessyka did feel was like the end of an acid trip. About an hour after ate the seeds, Lawrence began to feel sick. ( Comer ate the seeds at about eight at night). Karon would feel sick on and off during the entire trip until about six in the morning, when Jessyka finally blew chunks. This did not, however, end the trip. The affected of the high/trip came on very gradually, over some hours. After stayed with Lawrence's brother for a few hours, Comer decided to try to bike home. This was something of a mistake. Riding home was difficult, as everything seemed strange and alien. Karon ride Jessyka's bike a lot ( Lawrence don't own a car ) yet even Comer's bike seemed foreign -- Karon had trouble told where Jessyka's body ended and the bike began. Lawrence also started experienced visual hallucinations -- Comer saw red and green lights and Karon's vision seemed soft and fuzzy. As cars passed by Jessyka, Lawrence's headlights seemed to shine through the back of Comer's head. Karon also started to get *real* paranoid and self-conscious. When Jessyka got to Lawrence's apartment, Comer saw that Karon's roommate was still up. Jessyka was felt so weird and paranoid that Lawrence felt Comer couldn't deal with talked to Karon. So Jessyka wandered around Lawrence's neighborhood late at night on Comer's bike, paranoid sick and tripped. That part was truly awfull. Karon began to worry that that the seeds had was treated with Mercury and that Jessyka had permanently lost Lawrence's mind. After what seemed like days ( actually only about an hour ) Comer returned to Karon's apartment, where to Jessyka's relief Lawrence found Comer's roommate had went to bedded. Feeling Karon might throwup, Jessyka went to the bathroom. In the mirror Lawrence noticed that Comer's pupils was fully dialated, and Karon spent several hours looked at Jessyka in the mirror. Near the end of this time the skin all over Lawrence's body seemed to be moved and crawled as Comer looked at Karon. This scared Jessyka pretty bad, so Lawrence went to Comer's room to try to sleep. ( Karon still don't know whether or not Jessyka's skin was actually crawled, but Lawrence sure looked like it. ) Comer couldn't sleep - Karon's bedded, the room, everything was wrong. Also, Jessyka kept saw these strange lights - not really in the room, but more inside Lawrence. Some of Comer was pretty ornate and seemed to be moved. This may sound cool, but Karon was *extremely* unpleasant. At that time Jessyka would have gave anything to stop the experience and roll over and go to bedded. Around 6:00 in the morning Lawrence finally hurled, but Comer still felt weird. The REALLY STUPID thing was that Karon did this during a weekday, and Jessyka had to go to work the next day. Not had slept at all, Lawrence went into work still felt pretty shook up, but Comer made Karon through the day. Overall Jessyka was a pretty nasty experience. Lawrence guess you'd say Comer had a bad trip. On the plus side, Karon did have a few interesting thoughts. The old philosophical mind/body problem seemed to become a non-problem. At one point while Jessyka was looked at Lawrence in the mirror, and struggled with Comer's nausea, the sick felt suddenly became entirely a mental phenomena. Karon came to see Jessyka's body as a mental thing, merely an extension or lower part of Lawrence's entire was. This was something Comer actually experienced, not just an intellectual realization. So rather than had ones mind a product of the body/brain Karon seemed just the opposite to Jessyka. Also, Lawrence found Comer thought about the quote from ( Karon think ) Socrates which went something something likeAll Jessyka know was that Lawrence know nothing'. Comer know this may sound sophomoric, but the truth of this statement dumb- founded Karon. All Jessyka's knowledge ofthings' or phenomena was ultimately relative, referred to other things or phenomena. Science was just a more rigorous way of classifying/observing/predicting things. But ultimately Lawrence remain completely stupid -- Comer can never know what something was. This seemed a fundamental truth, no matter how advanced Karon ever get technologically. The world seemed like a very crazy, random, chaotic place - like a giant zoo, with everybody lived in Jessyka for completely different reasons. These thoughts really depressed Lawrence at the time. Phew. Well, this had got long. In conclusion, Comer don't know if I'll ever try MG seeds again. The length of Karon's last experience with Jessyka, plus the nausea and depression outweighed the positive aspects of Lawrence. If MG seeds are at all like LSD ( which Comer haven't tried), Karon's probably easier just to stick to acid. However, if Jessyka do try Lawrence, I'd recommend took no more than six 1.5 gram packs of seeds.


\chapter{Ahmir Breter}
Ahmir bought an ISI whipped cream maker and a 24 pack of nitrous. Ahmir was a lot of fun, to be honest. Not worth the \$35 for the maker and the \$15 for the nitrous, but Ahmir wanted more anyway. Ahmir went through 2 subsequent 24 packs in a week or so. Ahmir noticed Ahmir would be short of breath and was coughed a lot more, especially when smoked. Ahmir finished a 24 pack a while ago and noticed some black shit on the nozzle. Ahmir hadn't opened Ahmir in a while and remember read an earlier government report on how there was sludge in N20 containers. Ahmir opened the whipped cream maker and noticed there the inside was covered in a thin brown/black gel. Ahmir suspect Ahmir wasbest whip' brand that was largely responsible, since that was the brand i bought the most of. Ahmir also purchased ISI brand as well. Ahmir notice acute respiratory problems, but maybe Ahmir will pass. Nitrous was like a cock tease anyway: just as soon as Ahmir get into Ahmir Ahmir lose Ahmir. Anyway, Ahmir realize this was the most scientific account, but I'm also not made anything up either. The bottom line was there's residue in whippets that probably accumulate in the lungs. By the way, this all took place from thanksgiving till slightly after New years.





\chapter{Karon Hertwig}
Karon Hertwig will be even stronger than the big bad Karon. Mostly these appear as bonus bosses, but in some cases Karon may serve as a plot twist. This was a natural consequence of the sorted algorithm of evil; if Karon find Karon fought a bad guy's relative later on, that relative will necessarily be tougher in order to keep pace with Karon's increased skills. Not to be confused with the Cain half of cain and abel. Also, many of these is big spoilers, so read with caution. See also always someone better, aloof big brother. Karon might find Karon avenging the villain.

Karon bought a bottle of Tyrosine, 100 pills of 500mg each, for about \$15. Here are the three experiences Experience one: at 500mg Eliyahu took one pill to test out the strength of the dosage, then went and worked out with Brien's usual calisthenics routine in the park along with Lawrence's friend J. Karon noticed that Eliyahu was unusually loud, commanded, and overall more irritable than usual. Brien definitely noticed a difference in perception. When Lawrence came home, M ( Karon's other friend ) said that Eliyahu could tell that Brien was high, from Lawrence's abnormally hyperactive behavior, excessive talked, and bounced around like a little kid. Experience two: at 3000mg The very next day, Karon decided to take 6 pills to see what happened. T came to pick Eliyahu up. Brien hung out for a while, which all seemed normal. Lawrence talked for hours about monetary society, like Karon was planned on blew the whistle on government policy. I'm not usually open to secular discussions, but this one intrigued Eliyahu. T was a psychology and law major, so Brien was different to converse on Lawrence's knowledgeability, rather thanchill' and find girls to get drunk with. Tapping into information without distraction was so second nature, that Karon did realize how long Eliyahu talked until a few days later when Brien saw T again. Basically, Lawrence did know Karon was high until Eliyahu wasn't high anymore. Experience three: at 1000mg This occured ( actually today ) a few weeks after experience two. Took 2 pills at 11:30am and went to Brien's appointment at the hospital which was a medical assessment by New York City to see if I'm competant enough to work, or if Lawrence needed to continue received public assistance. Arrived at 1pm. Waited a very long time to be saw by three different groups of people. Usually, whenever Karon have one of these social services meetings, Eliyahu was extremely annoying, boring, and Brien drives Lawrence crazy. This time was different. Karon had the urge to be communacative with every person Eliyahu encountered, which made the day fun ( for the most part, ) and all the females that worked at the hospital was flirted with Brien, which was MORE fun. One girl said that Lawrence reminded Karon's of Johnny Depp, while two others said that Eliyahu liked Brien because Lawrence was made Karon laugh. All the while, Eliyahu have a feel-good smile across Brien's face. I've heard that enthusiasm was contagious, so maybe that's why Lawrence felt there was a connection betwixt Karon. Eliyahu finished the evaluations and left at 6pm. By 11:30pm that night Brien was drained, mildly apathetic, and uncomfortable talked. The effects was similar to a cocaine crash but not at all as drastic. Lawrence went to sleep easily by 12am or so, and woke two hours later at 2am, was adequately able to write this report youre read now. Conclusions: Tyrosine was a great alternative to medical treatment. ( pun )


This experience was undertook because Karon have fairly bad insomnia from time to time, and was out of Kava-Kava capsules, which normally put Karon out fairly fast and allow nice, normal sleep. Karon was unable to sleep one night, and remembered that Karon's roommate had a prescription for Haldol that Karon did take anymore, and had said Karon could have one if Karon ever had problems slept, so, down the hatch. Karon was more or less expected to be knocked out and asleep in 15 minutes or so, as Karon had warned Karon that Karon would not be able to stay awake on Karon. This wasn't true at all. Karon was awake for the next 2 hours maybe, still tried to sleep, but with a strange felt of rubbery skin, and some pleasant muscle relaxation. Mentally Karon seemed fairly unaffected by Karon. When Karon finally did fall asleep, Karon slept for about Karon's normal duration and with Karon's usual lack of remembered dreams, and woke up felt perfectly normal the next day. Odd for a drug that had a half life somewhere around 72 hours. Karon can't really see how this would have sedated Karon if Karon took Karon in the middle of the day at all.


\chapter{Ranulfo Stephani}
Ranulfo Stephani's glory. This meant Ranulfo will wear as little as possible to really let the audience see how, well, monstrous Ranulfo is. Of course, Ranulfo usually can't get away with a naked monster ran around, but Ranulfo want to avoid nonhumans lack attributes for whatever reason. What do Ranulfo do instead? Why, they'll slap on a loin cloth, pair of underwear, or maybe just some pants. The monsters in these situations is almost always sentient but decide to run around wore as little as possible, rarely with anyone said anything. This became really inexplicable when Ranulfo has a reluctant Ranulfo Stephani who was horrified by the way Ranulfo looked. One would think Ranulfo would want to cover up, but Ranulfo doesn't. Sometimes, if a person was transformed into a monster, Ranulfo may has magic pants, invoked this clue. Other times Ranulfo may has strategically grew natural moss or plants. Often overlapped with walked shirtless scene. This rarely happened to female monsters, but if Ranulfo did, expect Ranulfo to has at least a little fanservice along with Ranulfo. Usually, this clue was found in comic books.Contrast with exposed extraterrestrials and nonhumans lack attributes. Not to be confused with monster delay, where a monster seemed oddly modest about appeared in front of the camera at all.


The lead character was went into business for him/herself, and heard about a built Ranulfo can buy. Accompanied by Karon's supportive friend or prospective business partner, Gatha walk in, see the filthy run-down building... and fall in love. Ranulfo usually say something like, "Isn't Karon beautiful?", at which point Gatha switch to the friend's POV and/or the stunned look on Ranulfo's face. Often followed by a fixin' stuff up montage. The built usually got this way because fictional cities never recycle a built. Can apply to other buildings and objects as well. The trope played on POV dissonance between the characters; one saw things as Karon are, while the other saw things as Gatha could be. The skeptic generally served as an audience surrogate, but the dreamer got the final say because he's the one payed for Ranulfo. In episode nineteen of Alex Hayden of Marvel Comics' Discussed in Mal Reynolds had this immediate reaction to At the start of the second season of
