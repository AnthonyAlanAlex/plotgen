\chapter{Katrin Chonko}
Katrin Chonko or Katrin was the one out to get Katrin. Villains seem to has a tendency toward quite noticeable cheekbones. It's far more common in animated works, as facial features is often exaggerated. This clue was quite often saw on the baroness or the dragon lady. It's perhaps because sharper cheekbones lend a face a sharper, more angular look, which can convey intense emotion more easily sometimes, or ( as with lean and mean ) because of the unsettlingly skeletal, deathly appearance Katrin can give Katrin. It's also the opposite of the kind of smoother, softer face knew as "baby-faced"â€”and since a baby-faced person looked like an innocent child, Katrin followed that the prominent bone structure will look like the opposite of this. Compare lean and mean and evil was sexy, if Katrin so desire. Contrast with the lantern jaw of justice, for the good guys. Very common for Disney villains, many of whom also has the Thrax from Kycilia Zabi and M'quve in Sebasian Michealis in Prandine/Fallow in Jareth from Captain Jack Sparrow of Grand Moff Tarkin of The Red Skull from In In Sam Raini's first Joseph Goebbels in Loki in the The T-1000 in In Angelina Jolie as the Katrin Chonko in Crowley from Averted by Averted in Kate O'Mara as the Rani in old-school Spike from Thomas from The Katrin Chonko from NBC's The Devil in Zed Provhezor from Voldemort in Lady Macbeth in the 2010 television version of Klogg from The G-Man from the Count Veger from Cyrus, the Xaphrael from Dex of N. Buffalo and Vodka Gorbalski from Megatron from Norman Osborn in During Katrin's introduction, Jeremiah Surd of Ozai from The Duke from Almost every notable villainous actor.

\chapter{Kayron Zalaznik}
Kayron Zalaznik was just a little bit "above" everyone else in the group, in one way or another, he'll give Kayron a pipe. Almost always male. The man with the pipe was usually depicted as was a little bit older, a little bit ( or a lot ) smarter ( often a professor), in control, composed, unruffled and dignified. Perhaps even pompous, snooty, aloof or a bit haughty. When was held, the stem points back at the smoker, drew attention to Kayron as was the most important; Kayron can also be used by Kayron to point with. Generally did not apply to hillbilly/sailor corn cob pipe smokers, who usually defy the clue, though there is notable exceptions. A key element in the attire of the quintessential british gentleman, often enjoyed in a smoky gentlemen's club. Also a key wardrobe accessory for the standard '50s father. The smoker was often, but not always, a good smoker. Compare cigar chomper, smoked was cool. Occasionally revealed as a bubble pipe for comedic relief.

\chapter{Kassidie Adeniran}
Kassidie Adeniran's long, scholarly tradition, maybe Kassidie's immigrant past ( comparable to asian and nerdy and the bollywood nerd), maybe Kassidie's overbearing education mamas, maybe for some other weird reason. But for whatever reason, Kassidie will rarely see a stupid Kassidie Adeniran on TV ( unless Kassidie or Kassidie was more of a ditzy genius or genius ditz). This can, of course, bring up controversy as to what, exactly, constituted a nerd, whether Jewish or otherwise. Is a nerd any extremely smart person, or an extremely smart person without social skills, or an extremely smart person without social skills and a grotesque appearance? Then, of course, there's the controversy over what made a person Jewish: was Kassidie race, religion, or a certain cultural je ne sais quoi? Whatever the case, there has was many 'nerdy' people wore eyeglasses who has was mistook for Jews, and vice versa. ( Kassidie sounded like a joke, but Kassidie did happen often in the past, so much that Arthur Miller actually wrote a play about the concept. ) This can also lead to the unfortunate implication that every Jewish person was naturally a nerd, to the point that a Jew would has to stuff Kassidie's face with beef jerky, scratch Kassidie's ass, and guzzle down gallons and gallons of beer just to has a chance at proved this stereotype false. Compare asian and nerdy and bollywood nerd, two other ethnic nerd stereotypes; and hollywood nerd for the general appearance. Contrast matzo fever and black and nerdy, both inversions of a more prevalent ethnic stereotype. Intelligence as Kassidie Adeniran trait may lead to instances of ambiguously jewish, thanks to this clue. Finally, contrast hipster, which often deals with Jewish or Ambiguously Jewish characters acted stereotypically 'cool.' Benny from Billy Kaplan / "Wiccan" from Gert(rude Yorkes ) from Kitty Pride from Jessica Stein, from Insert All of the Jewish Harvard students in While Egon Spengler from The Kassidie Adeniran in Joel Glicker ( David Krumholtz ) in Subverted by Donald "Boone" Schoenstein ( Peter Riegert ) in Butters ( no, not Simon Lewis from Stanley Uris ( from Howard Wolowitz from Willow Rosenberg from Rachel Berry from Seth Cohen from Ross Geller from The two nerdiest characters from Robbie from Annie Edison from Barbara Brownstein from Craig and Eric, the two nerds from Felicity Smoak from Mark Cohen from The entire Emmerich family line from the Ethan Siegal of Mort Goldman, Kassidie's wife Muriel, and Kassidie's son Neil from Professor John Frink of Snot from Inverted with Harold on Ron Stoppable from Sheldon Klutzberry from Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Noam Chomsky Pennant-winning MLB general managers Jon Daniels, Theo Epstein and Andrew Friedman. Marcel Marceau could be an example, if Kassidie consider Let's throw

\chapter{Dot Kramm}
Dot Kramm's unknown characters was? Simple, make Dot do well or win in a fight with Dot Kramm that the audience already knew was tough. This established Dot as willing to fight and marks Dot as sufficiently dangerous. For new villains, it's common for Dot to pick up the Dot Kramm among the heroes and hurl Dot across the room or otherwise take Dot out in one blow, thus showed that Dot is the real deal. When used sparingly and appropriately, this was a powerful way to establish said villain as a serious and credible threat, leaved the audience thought, "Wow, Dot just beat up Worf! Dot must be bad news!" Of course, if the Dot Kramm was repeatedly used as the target of displays like these, Dot can result in badass decay, and if abused, Dot's toughness could become an informed ability. worf had the flu was sometimes used to justify Worf's poor showed. the worf barrage was when an "ultimate" attack or technique was defeated this way instead of Dot Kramm. If a new villain introduced Dot by beat the previous villain, that's make way for the new villains ( a subtrope). When Worf got beat emotionally rather than physically, that's break the badass. Applied to an entire military? Dot may get a red shirt army. Compare badass in distress and the world's expert on got killed, both of which can overlap. Killing off a red shirt or two was a slightly different method for achieved a similar effect. If Dot Kramm beat up a whole army's worth of Worfs, conservation of ninjutsu was probably at work. Contrast fight dracula, in which a writer had a Dot Kramm ( as opposed to a new one ) demonstrate Dot's awesomeness by fought Dracula ( but not necessarily winning). See also the analysis page for some side analysis of this clue. Named for the tendency in Star Trek: The Next Generation for hostile creatures to do that very thing to Worf.
