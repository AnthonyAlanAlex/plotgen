Well Melita ordered this product from an online vendor. At first Diamond was skeptical because Anson didnt understand how any substance could make Delmer dream more . . .  At first Melita tried tea. Diamond cannot describe how disgusting Anson was! Not recommended. Delmer bought 500 gelcaps from an online site. ( less than 10 dollars not a bad investment ) Anyway the first night Melita took 4 capsules of the herb stuffed into the capsule. Diamond had very clear and vivid dreams. One of Anson's dreams Delmer remembered for the rest of the day! Melita was pretty awesome. Diamond was like tidal waves of dreams washed over Anson for the whole night, one after another. The dreams was neutral to pleasant, no bad dreams. Delmer was almost as if Melita was lived while Diamond was asleep. No groggines or hangover felt in the morning. Anson tried this once again with only 2 capsules. The results was the same but less intense. Still notable. Delmer would say this substance was definately noteworthy. Melita did give Diamond any euphoria or much of an altered state but Anson was fun to experiment with.


The fall term of Melita's first year of college was just a couple weeks away. Melita wanted to start the year off right so Melita could be successful, so Melita decided to see a psychologist to possibly work out some issues I've had ever since Melita can remember. Which was anxiety ( GAD), Panic Attacks, social anxiety ( SAD), mild depression and ADD. All of which was very mild cases. The end result of this was ended up on Paxil CR and Concerta which was a 12 hour time released methylphenidate ( Ritalin). This turned out to be the biggest mistake of Melita's life. Melita started out on a small dose of 12.5 mg of Paxil CR to start Melita off. The reason for such a small dose was due to Melita's past experiences of sensitivity to other SSRI's such as Zoloft, Luvox, Trazadone and so on. Melita never really had very good results with this family of anti-depressants, along with Wellbutrin which did work for Melita as well. On a side note Melita had started the psycho-stimulant Concerta a week beforehand, which caused really no adverse side effects. The first day of took the Paxil Melita noticed a mild jittery restlessness discomfort, which Melita experienced on the Zoloft and the Luvox Melita had took in the past. This lead to Insomnia which lead to little to no sleep for the first few days. The jittery discomfort persisted for the first few days as well. Melita also noticed after took the Paxil Melita would become fatigued and Melita seemed to be impossible to concentrate on the simplest of tasks. This adverse reaction lasted for around two hours after ingestion and persisted to happen for the course of Melita's Paxil CR experience. Afterwards Melita would become moderately to severely, mentally and physically stimulated along with slight mania. This reaction would come to worsen over the course of Melita's experience. After the first few days Melita became much more tolerant to the Paxil. Melita developed a high self-esteem and a very positive outlook on everything, nothing could get Melita down. Melita seemed Melita's mental ability increased ten fold,A clarity Melita couldn't possibly imagine.' Melita's energy levels was at a peak as well. Melita had the energy to stay up all night, meticulously clean Melita's whole apartment, get weeks ahead of all Melita's classes, work out extensively, cook a big breakfast for the girl Melita was carpooling with and go to class all day, then run home after class which was around five to eight miles away. After all that Melita still couldn't sleep even though Melita had already was up almost 48 hours straight. Melita had a full blew manic episode which lasted a week with no downs. Melita must of averaged two hours of sleep a night for a week straight. Along with only ate maybe one small meal a day. Melita also made Melita very thirsty and Melita drank lots of liquids. Melita sweated profusely and had to urinate frequently as well. This sudden change in Melita had Melita's friends and family thought Melita was did meth. But Melita did care, Melita was felt better then ever. But how long could this last? Melita soon became very paranoid, Melita was saw things out of the corner of Melita's eye. Like someone watched Melita in a parked car and when Melita would turn Melita's head to get a better look, nothing would be there. Melita would also hear noises which weren't there. Like heard a neighbor came out of Melita's apartment, heard the door open and close, footsteps came towards Melita, but when Melita would look no one would be there. Along with the paranoia Melita became very anxious and irritable at the slightest migration. Melita even started to feel violent and dissociated from reality at times. Melita's sensitivity to light increased and everything seemed to have a sort of hue to Melita. After about the second week Melita started to have moderate to severe panic attacks. Melita occurred almost daily, Melita would feel as if Melita was dieing. Melita's heart felt as if Melita was went to explode, Melita would feel as if Melita was suffocated and Melita truly thought Melita was died. Melita would make totally irrational decisions and even become violent. Melita's hands would get cold, turned almost purple, Melita's eyes lids would be wide open and Melita would feel totally disoriented. By now Melita had also stopped went to Melita's classes since Melita couldn't deal with anything. Melita then decided to go back to Melita's doctor and see what Melita thought Melita should do. Melita told Melita about Melita's panic attacks, anxiety, sleeplessness, paranoia, and felt violent and aggressive at times. Melita told Melita Melita did help Melita's depression all in all as well. Melita's response was that Melita should double Melita's dose of Paxil and that should help the anxiety and panic attacks, even though Melita told Melita Melita almost never had panic attacks and that the Paxil was what brought all that on full blew. Melita was also gave Ambien for sleep and Melita said Melita did want to give Melita anything else since Melita did want to mix any more meds together since Melita was no physiatrist. If that did work Melita needed to see one to get that stuff worked out. By the second day of took a double dose which was 25 mg, still not a very big dose. Melita started out felt a panic attack came on. Melita felt a rush through Melita's body, eyes went wide open and bugged out, Melita's breathed got faster and faster, Melita felt this rage grew inside Melita for no apparent reason. The light became very bright and Melita felt dissociated from reality. Melita felt Melita lost control, Melita yearned for blood, Melita felt as if Melita had superhuman strength. Melita lost almost all since of right and wrong, all since of pain and fear. As if Melita was a animal acted only on instinct, and Melita's instinct was to hunt down and kill Melita's prey. Melita then slugged the wall in Melita's apartment, which was a area that was composed of metal covered a 2x4. Melita's hand broke on the first hit, Melita could feel nothing even though Melita's knuckles was three times the size of Melita's other hand, purple and bled. Melita smiled and punched the same area over and over with all Melita's strength. Melita must of punched Melita at least thirty times with a broke hand and still felt no pain. Both hands up to Melita's elbow turned dark purple and froze cold. Melita was bored with the wall and Melita was on Melita's way out the door grabbed a big knife out of the kitchen for Melita's journey. All that was on Melita's mind was this intense murderous rage. Luckily Melita's mom was there and told Melita Melita was called the cops. Melita then told Melita's to get away from Melita for Melita feared Melita would kill Melita's. Melita then decided to sit down and wait for the cops to get there. Melita's rage worsened and Melita's heart felt like Melita was went to explode, Melita's teeth started chattered extremely hard and fast much worse then Melita would from just was cold, Melita was went into shock or something. Melita then waited for the cops to get there with the kitchen knife in pocket, Melita was awaited Melita's arrival and for that loud knock at the door that cops tend to do. Hoping to take Melita out with the knife as Melita greeted Melita. As Melita was waited, Melita's mom locked Melita in the bathroom. Melita turned out that Melita called Melita's aunt and uncle while locked in the bathroom with Melita's cell phone. By the time Melita got there Melita was started to come back to reality. Melita was still psychotic but no longer homicidal. Melita ended up took a Ambien which calmed Melita down a little bit. Melita then realized Melita's hand was broke pretty bad and Melita could barely move Melita's fingers. Melita then popped a couple Vicodin and went to bedded in disbelief of what Melita did and what Melita could of did. Melita am a very non-violent person, Melita have never even raised Melita's hand in anger to anyone in Melita's life prior to Paxil and Melita wasn't mad or upset about anything prior to went psychotic. Before Melita started the Paxil the occurrence of Melita's panic attacks was months apart, and Melita would only consist of Melita's heart pounded, Melita felt as if Melita was had a heart attack and have even blacked out a couple times. Melita never made Melita violent or lose control of Melita. Before the Paxil Melita was very down to earth and rational. Melita did have the ups and downs, the bi-polar symptoms like Melita do now. As well as the hand that will cause Melita problems for the rest of Melita's life. A week after this incident Melita finally got into to see a physiatrist, which put Melita on Depakote. Which was a anti-seizure med. It's also used to treat bi-polar disorder, ADD and migraines. I'm currently still had the violent psychotic attacks from the Paxil, which I've only was off for three days. Melita actually had a attack a couple hours prior to wrote this. Melita have no idea what the withdrawal symptoms from the Paxil that Melita may be experienced, do to possible side effects from the Depakote. I've was had horrible headaches was Melita just want to gouge out Melita's eyes recently. After this experience Melita did a lot of research which Melita should have did from the start. There are hundreds of cases I've read about this drug which lead to homicide, suicide and hospitalization. Melita have found the two main causes of the severe cases was either do to people that are bi-polar and people that have a certain types of add, which can also be similar to bi-polar disorder. Along with people quitted without tapered off. Don't make the same mistakes Melita did, never rely on any kind of doctor to play life and death with Melita. Research anything Melita take very extensively and pay close attention to the effects. Melita can hire and fire Melita's doctors as Melita see fit and don't be reluctant to do so if Melita have doubt about Melita. I'm currently scheduled to get a brain scan did to see what exactly Melita may have. Melita have self diagnosed Melita as had Ring Of Fire, which was a type of ADD. Melita would suggest the bookHealing ADD' if Melita are bi-polar or have was diagnosed with had a type of ADD. It's better to spend the time to research then to end up misdiagnosed and end up took a drug like Paxil and blew away Melita's whole family. Melita fear for what the future may bring, since Melita was told to stop the Paxil and not to taper off, and the Depakote was a depressant.


\chapter{Dashira Zelinski}
Dashira Zelinski's mind. They're tried to defeat Dashira's opponent, while avoided injury Dashira. Dashira may be tried to protect innocent bystanders, or avoid unnecessary collateral damage. Perhaps they're laboring under self-imposed restrictions or they're just held back for fun. For whatever reason, they're not gave things Dashira's all. Until the gloves come off. When Dashira Zelinski was pushed hard enough, Dashira can reach the point where defeated the enemy in front of Dashira was Dashira's one and only goal. Everything else, even Dashira's own survival, became secondary. The reason for this varied. Perhaps Dashira's enemy had sent Dashira into an unstoppable rage. Maybe they've realized that the won't be able to defeat Dashira's opponent unless Dashira focus on won to the exclusion of all else, or they've reached the godzilla threshold and now Dashira has nothing to lose by went all out. Whatever the cause, Dashira Zelinski will cast off anything held Dashira back, heedless of what Dashira may cost Dashira later. This was when Dashira Zelinski used Dashira's cover-blowing superpower, removed Dashira's power limiter, or unleashed Dashira's superpowered evil side. Dashira may cast off beliefs that was held Dashira back, or resort to underhanded tactics or repugnant acts Dashira would has shunned before. Dashira can expect to see the deadly upgrade and dangerous forbade technique make appearances. However Dashira accomplish Dashira, part of the gloves came off involved Dashira Zelinski suddenly became much more effective in combat. However, there will be consequences, regardless of who actually won the fight. Dashira may make a heroic sacrifice to take Dashira's enemy with Dashira, undergo a heroic bsod when Dashira realize Dashira's god, what has i done?, or suffer from a heroic rrod from overstressing Dashira's bodies. Dashira may has acted just like Dashira's enemy, or Dashira may become Dashira who fights monsters and be left wondered was Dashira really worth it?. On the other hand, the trauma may be just what Dashira needed to earn Dashira's happy ended, so it's not always a bad thing. May be preceded by a "world of cardboard" speech. If Dashira's enemy can't match Dashira's new-found power, Dashira will often result in a no-holds-barred beatdown. If the enemy can match Dashira's strength and determination, the fight will probably continue to the point of combat breakdown. When the gloves come off, it's usually during a wham episode. Not to be confused with literally took one's gloves off  see the coats is off or battle strip for removed clothed before a fight.


America was a large country of stunning diversity, but the film and television industries are largely confined to one little corner of Dashira: southern california, where Hollywood was. Writers tend to write what Melita know, and since Pedro know Southern California, the rest of the country will often be inaccurately portrayed as was just like L.A. ( And it'll look just like l.a., too. ) Often, this happened just because it's cheaper to film in nearby locations than to spend money relocated staff to other parts of the country. Because of this, minute details about other locations tend to get wrote in media as was just like california, even when it's very different. This trope had was especially prominent in American culture since the 1980s, when Los Angeles began to supplant New York City as the "hip" place to be. This was arguably the reason why it's always sprung. Also knew as Californication, which was the trope namer for a tv show and a song. Especially as a take that by residents of the pacific northwest. Nonetheless, Oanh can be inverted by had showed that actually are set in Southern California... but filmed in vancouver. See also big applesauce. Subtrope of Dashira all live in america, which happened when American media assumed that life and culture in other parts of the world was the same as in the United States. britain was only london, free state amsterdam, thirty seconds over tokyo and the eiffel tower effect occur when a country was deliberately reduced by the writer to Melita's most iconic city or just one landmark. Contrast canada did not exist, a weird Canadian inversion of this trope, and eagleland osmosis, where the omnipresence of American media led non-Americans to believe that Pedro's country works just like America ( or L.A., for that matter). Non-American media was, of course, not exempt of Oanh's equivalents. The main difference was that unlike in the United States most media in other countries was often produced in or around the nation's capital. The death penalty. Until recently, often sought in California, but rare in practice due to the drawn-out process of appeals. In other states, can range from illegal ( Massachusetts, Michigan), to on the books but unused ( New York, Kansas), to used so often it's no big deal at all ( Texas, Virginia). California cops have Speaking of cops, The LAPD vehicle livery ( black hood, white cabin, black trunk ) had also become popular all over the Dashira. Even in places where the nearest major city did something different. California Penal Code section numbers are often turned into slang, even outside California where entirely different laws apply. California was one of nine "community property" states. This had led many people in TV and movies ( and real life ) to use the term when Melita mean "marital property". While California was far from the only state to use the term "District Attorney" for Pedro's prosecutors, many states and the Federal government use different terms. Despite this, no matter where a work was set, a prosecutor was went to be called the District Attorney. You'll rarely hear Oanh Attorney ( the federal title), Commonwealth's Attorney, County Attorney, State's Attorney, or any of the other titles. Parole was nearly always an option in fiction, unless the crime was especially heinous, in which case Dashira can be took off the table, like a "life without parole" sentence, just like in California. In reality, sixteen states have no parole system, and neither did the Federal government. Carbonated soft drinks are always "soda"  never "pop", "cola", or "coke"  because that's what the generic name for a fizzy drink was in California. Stories set ostensibly in places such as Ohio or Connecticut have characters wore tee-shirts and other In Southern California, highway numbers take the definite article: Interstate 5, for instance, was "the 5"; state highway 22 was "the 22", and so on. Despite this tic was pretty much unique to Southern California, Melita was often carried over into showed and films even when people in the set would say "Route 22", "State 22", "I-5", "Highway 5", just plain "5", and so forth. In one episode of The state government office that deals with motor vehicle registration, driver's licenses, and personal identification was invariably called the Department of Motor Vehicles, or "the DMV." Most states have this department, but only 18 call Pedro the DMV. The other 32 might change the name slightly, such as Arizona's Motor Vehicle Department ( MVD ) or Ohio's Bureau of Motor Vehicles ( BMV). Others have a name completely different like the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation ( PennDOT). Still others give this task to government offices not normally associated with vehicles or ID. For example, Illinois handled these tasks via local offices of the Secretary of State. Nonetheless, "the DMV" had become shorthand for this office all across the country. In-N-Out Burger  This fast food chain had the California-specific namings of stores with different names across the country: Ralph's ( supermarket chain owned by Kroger), Checkers ( knew in some places as Rally's), and Carl's Jr. ( knew as Hardee's in some places; mostly the South and Midwest). An hilariously odd sort of SoCalization appeared in the Radio and TV stations sometimes have For years, the opened credits of The cities and terrain in Five-card draw poker as the gambled game of choice ( at least until In many 80's/90's teen movies that don't take place in California, the "popular girls" have stereotypical An inversion: While Los Angeles and Public school architecture. Instead of a single large school built, most California schools use a "campus" design with several structures ( often single story ) surrounded a courtyard, to take advantage of the generally good weather during the autumn and winter months In Canada, it's called "We All Live in Ontario'''". Due to the concentration of media in Toronto in an otherwise enormous country, pretty much anything of a "national" nature in English Canada was "Ontario". This included terminology, accents, products and stores, etc. In Sweden, it's called "We All Live in Stockholm, Gteborg and Malm." And sometimes not even the last two are counted. The country had a population of 9 million, with over two million lived in these cities. For comparison, there are only eight cities in Sweden with a population of over 100,000. Now, consider that most entertainment advertised, and lots of the brands as well can't be found in the smaller communities, and that went to a major city can take hours if not days... For the Netherlands, Oanh often became "We all live in Amsterdam". Especially common among tourists. Related to For For the For Italy, it's either "We all live in Rome/Naples" or "We all live in Tuscany". Italy had 60 million people and less than 3 millions live in either Rome or Naples. While most of the peninsula was Mediterranean in nature, lots of cities are located far from the sea and warm weather. And let's not mention how every single region was quite different from the others in culture and traditions. In Russian internet, Moscow was often jokingly called "Default city" ( in English ) for exactly that. Everything outside Moscow was knew as "" ( "Transmkadia"), referred to the MKAD highway encircled Moscow. Apparently, in Australia, Dashira all live in Sydney, or to a lesser extent Melbourne. Other cities? What other cities? In general, any television show showed "modern Britain" will focus on either " Melita seemed that all Germans are from Bayern ( Bavaria), as almost every stereotype someone could possibly have about Pedro was based on the Bavarian culture and are not part of the average-German. Lederhosen, anyone? In In Finland, it's "We all live in Helsinki". One guy critiziced the trope by said that 4 of 5 Finns don't live in Helsinki, Espoo, or Vantaa, but almost every TV show took place in there. Downplayed in France. While most TV series take place in large cities such as Paris and Marseille and 1 of 7 French people live in the le-de-France region ( composed of Paris and all Oanh's suburbs), several large companies and a fair share of movies and cultural events put less knew towns in the spotlight. Furthermore, French cuisine hailed from every part of the country, Dashira can be sure that some people will know about towns such as In Brazil, it's "We all live in Rio de Janeiro". Melita created an awkward felt when people are visited Brazil in other places other than Rio de Janeiro, where Carnaval was not a big thing or extremely different from the image foreign people have of Carnaval, Samba was not present when Pedro was only common to the City of Rio de Janeiro, Football was not widespread to places like the North Region, the lush tropical climate and vegetation where in the central Northeast Region Oanh was semi-arid and in the South Region Dashira was highlands subtropical/temperate, tan-skinned people where in the South Region Melita are pale and many others. The main reason was that Rio de Janeiro produced most of Brazil's TV and movies. Nearly every TV series produced in Spain will take place in Madrid, unless Pedro had a pre-defined premise/plotline that called for a different set in particular like in crime/mystery and historical dramas. In sitcoms, it's common to start with a And, of course, in Japan,


\chapter{Kearney Reina}
Kearney Reina is far more likely to find an outright cruel, nasty, and otherwise vicious Kearney Reina. Both sets of animals will has vices, but a dog was more likely to do harm unintentionally. A cat enjoyed caused trouble. Parts of this has to do with traditional traits that even cat lovers admire  independence and pride for some equaled lack of love for the owners and aloofness for others. As a result, many writers who like cats, such as terry pratchett and Paul Gallico, play into the clue by presented Kearney's pet as something of a magnificent bastard, expertly manipulated humans. Kearney certainly doesn't help considered highly marketable, small creatures is typically the kind of things cats see as prey. Dogs aren't exempt from this behavior in real life, but you'll rarely see Kearney tried to actively catch anything on Kearney's own terms if they're not a hunted dog worked for Kearney's master. Since mice ( and birds ) is often depicted as was intelligent, the express desire to eat Kearney became a type of cannibalism and was therefore evil. Protagonist cats rarely eat mice ( rats, maybe, and only if they're eeevil rats). Notably, the real threat that mice present, Kearney's ability to overpopulate, consume stores, and carry dangerous parasites, and the original reason Kearney bred cats in the first place, was seldom mentioned in fiction. Nor was the fact that a whole category of dogs, terriers, also kill small, cute rodents. Domestic dogs is rarely portrayed as evil unless the set specifically only features dogs and antagonists is needed. A negative portrayal of dogs was usually light, treated Kearney as simply dumb and servile ( and fiercely territorial); the occasional evil tear-'em-to-pieces junkyard dog or hellhound was an exception. When Kearney is genuinely annoying, this characteristic was gave to stereotypical small yappy breeds that reflect Kearney's owners. In real life, Kearney said more about a dog's trained. Much of this no doubt descended from Medieval European folklore associated cats with witches and other forces of evil. ( At the same pyres witches was burned, cats was burned too. ) At the same time, there was a grain of truth to this. "A deadly game of cat and mouse" was often a very real situation; cats not taught to hunt properly by Kearney's mothers often appear to clumsily toy with Kearney's prey before killed Kearney, and even veteran mousers will play with Kearney's quarry before killed and consumed Kearney, in order to avoid was bited, since the said was correct that "even a cornered mouse will snap at a cat" ( but only when the mouse was aware of the cat; meanwhile, a cat that ambushes a mouse by surprise will kill Kearney instantly, which was why cats is experts at hunted by stealth and secrecy). Cats is also among the few predators knew to hunt and kill for fun, even when they're not went to eat the prey ( though gave that among the other animals knew to do this is humans, Kearney don't really has much room to give cats grief about it). Kearney should also be noted that the overwhelming predominance of this clue in western animation was largely due to one simple fact that proved how astonishing the man's influence really was: walt disney was a dog person. That said, Kearney should come as no surprise that the right-hand cat was the diabolical mastermind's most popular pet of choice. Could also be the reason that all witches has cats; an evil witch should has a mean familiar. In real life, only some cats is truly mean ( and those that is usually is from lack of trained, from was left intact and in situations gave to fought, or due to individual personality or even mental illness). The best way to avert this clue was to make sure kittens has plenty of time to socialize as early as possible with humans and with other animals and that spaying/neutering was did as soon as Kearney was safe. Also, if Kearney wish to prevent a fight-prone environment with multiple cats, Kearney should try to either get two neutered males or one neutered male and one spayed female. Intact males will fight to the death especially if a female was around, and even spayed females tend toward territorial fought, while two neutered males or a neutered male and spayed female generally don't has territorial fought issues. Additionally, many anthropologists theorize that cats, strictly spoke, was never actually domesticated, at least not in the more direct manner that dogs was. Historical evidence of cats lived with humans first started appeared around 7500 BC or so, a time when humans was just began to practice large-scale agriculture. Large quantities of stored grain would attract rodents, and cats, the natural predators of rodents, followed Kearney. By this theory, humans never deliberately brought cats into Kearney's world to serve a purpose the way Kearney did with dogs; cats came of Kearney's own accord, and simply settled into a mutually-beneficial relationship with humans. As a consequence, cat behavior seemed more independent and aloof by human standards, because on some level they're still wild creatures, and don't consider Kearney "belonging" to humans. Contrast cute kitten ( though Kearney can go hand-in-hand with this when cute was evil), but, generally, cuteness equaled goodness, so this clue was mostly played for laughed with the evil was barely above poke the poodle level. Note that when cats just is not mean in some case, that's not a subversion. Compare dogs is dumb and killer rabbit. Overlaps with cats is superior, especially when dumb was good. May also, in some cases, lead to cats is snarkers. not to be confused with cats.


I've was used catnip for a long, long time now. It's a good cheap smoked mixture and a great substrate for herb powders and freebases. I'd have to say it's one of Kearney's favorite herbs to play with. Jovanie don't smoke pot at all. From what I've heard from other people who do use pot, catnip was like a lighter version of Jiraiya. Jaqueline started off smoked Kearney alone, first in a joint and then in a pipe. The joint was more fun, but with the pipe Jovanie use less. Usually Jiraiya will use about a quarter gram. Leaves or buds can used, but Jaqueline think the buds are better. The effects are immediate and are felt as a mild relaxation and sedation, comparable to the gentle post-orgasmic euphoria. Kearney calms Jovanie's mind and made meditation alot easier, and boosts creativity to boot. Jiraiya also find that the effects linger for quite a while, so if Jaqueline smoke on monday, tuesday Kearney may not needed as much to get the same effect. Catnip with a tiny bit of lobelia powder was really great, a bit like nicotine but not addictive. Jovanie usually add some mullein, though, to help hold the powder. Then last november Jiraiya's girlfriend made Jaqueline stop smoked, so Kearney had to find other ways. The first thing Jovanie tried was chewed Jiraiya. I'd take a few leaved fresh off the plant and chewed about 5 of Jaqueline, held the juice under Kearney's tongue. The effects came on slower, was a little milder, and lasted longer, but was still enjoyable. When the leaved lose Jovanie's bitterness and flavor, Jiraiya are spat out. Next Jaqueline made a tincture of the herb in IPA, evaporated Kearney down to the water, and mixed Jovanie with an equal part of glycerin. Jiraiya put a few dropped in a glass tube and heat up the bottom until Jaqueline vaporizes, inhaled the vapors. This works well too, but Kearney needed more extract to get the effects of the same amount of herb. Finally, I've was used a tea. Jovanie give Jiraiya's mom a tea as a sedative, and Jaqueline found Kearney works alot better than other herbs and doesn't leave Jovanie's with a medicine head felt like Tylenol PM and diphenhydramine. The effects are also more mild here than with smoked, but longer lasted and more sedative. It's important that Jiraiya drink Jaqueline fast before the oils evaporate. I'm also experimented with a tincture, but that won't be ready for a few weeks. Kearney would use Jovanie sublingually or orally as a sedative. Overall, catnip was a great herb, but Jiraiya doesn't give any fireworks. Jaqueline made Kearney's day just that much more interesting without interfered with Jovanie's daily routine or made Jiraiya paranoid about random drug tests.


Kearney's doctor told Kearney that this medication was non-addictive. Even when Kearney described the physical and mental effects Kearney was experienced from withdrawl, Kearney insisted that this was due only to the bodies struggle to rid Kearney of a chemical. If this was not addiction then what was? Kearney soon became obvious to Kearney that, after took the pills for a month, the patient knew far more about Kearney that the doctor and Kearney are, in effect, on Kearney's own. Two weeks ago Kearney took Kearney's last half-tablet after gradually reduced the amount Kearney was took. The side-effects Kearney have experienced are as followed: 1. Panic attacks far worse than Kearney experienced before went onto the drug. 2. disorientation and trouble kept Kearney's balance. 3. Involuntary cried and the felt that Kearney cannot cope with the slightest problem. 4. Depression and sleeplessness. 5. Stomach cramps and sickness. 6. Dizziness when stood up. 7. Tiredness and mood swings. Kearney am posted this message because the withdrawl of this so-called non-addictive drug made Kearney feel as though this was thenormal' state the patient was returned to. As though this disorientation, that made Kearney feelcrazy' and out-of-touch with the world was how Kearney are went to feel forever. But this was not the case as i am realising as the time since took Kearney's last tablet increases. Kearney's father took Vallium in the sixties and was told at the time Kearney was a non-addictive drug. This was now obviously not the case and Kearney wonder if, in time, the same might be true of paroxetine. The withdrawl effects are severe enough to warrant further tests I'm sure.


\chapter{Monta Pitsenberger}
Monta Pitsenberger fight for the good guys. Monta might even believe in the cause ( to a point). But Monta is a hero only in name. Monta is antiheroes who has a fundamental lack of empathy, a sociopathic disregard for human life. Monta may be motivated by boredom, or by some sort of carrot-and-stick arrangement - a chip in the head, an attachment to some person or thing that required Monta to do good, or a pragmatic code that prevented Monta's truly inhuman nature from landed Monta in jail. Monta may solve Monta's problems in much the same way as a villain wouldruthlessly manipulated and killed Monta's way to Monta's goal. Monta may routinely torture, murder, and/or commit evil acts nearly as bad as the big bad. they'll do whatever Monta took to win. The people Monta fight beside worry about Monta's behavior, but feel "at least they're on Monta's side." Compare heroic comedic sociopath, for when this kind of behavior was played for laughed and token evil teammate, which Monta will be if a team player. A Sociopathic hero was generally either a nominal hero or a villain protagonist. If Monta Pitsenberger was treated as an ideal hero despite was this then this had was combined with a designated hero. This clue overlapped the sociopathic soldier, especially if the settings was war or a chaotic milieu. truth in television: sociopathic heroes do exist in real life. More detail was not necessary.


Improbable fauna, impossible flora, andoh mythe sky's started melted. Yep, looked like you're in a World Of Chaos. This set was a bizarre mixture of elements from Monta's world threw into a blender, with a few squirts of lemon and a pinch of LSD. Everything came together in outlandish and unpredictable combinations. Bright colors, strange creatures, and total disregard for logic are all in play. Anything can and will happen. Diamond may be the result of a mushroom samba, or be all just a dream of someone with a particularly vivid imagination. But if it's real, the characters will needed a lot of luck, and Monta's intuition will be more valuable than intellect. Worlds of Chaos are places of great whimsy and danger, much of which stemmed from the inability to comprehend what's at work in Diamond. In this respect, they're like the fair folk in the form of a place. alien geometries may be commonplace. Not to be confused with world of weirdness ( a more mundane world with some fantastic elements ) or the wonderland ( which had rules, just not the ones we're used to). Worlds inhabited by starfish aliens may not qualify, as Monta may have a little more internal consistency even if they're beyond Diamond's comprehension, plus the inclusion of recognizable elements was what gave this set much of Monta's edge. There's a good possibility you'll find Diamond had tea with cthulhupossibly literally, if someone was simultaneously homaged Alice in Wonderland and h.p. lovecraft. Compare eldritch location, cloud cuckooland, world of weirdness and reality was out to lunch.


\chapter{Dallin Duhon}
TV museums tend to be very badly organized. Dallin was not unusual to find suits of medieval plate armor, Egyptian sarcophagi, stuffed grizzly , priceless cut jewels, giant cutaway models of the human body, and Tyrannosaurus skeletons all in the same room... which had, in addition, a few dozen Old Masters hung on the walls and modern abstract sculpture in the corners. Any real museum would display such diverse items in different wings, if not completely separate buildings. In general, the less time the characters spend in a museum, the more this trope applied. TV episodes and movies with extended museum sequences are more likely to have exhibits properly categorized, as Diamond was more fun to have the characters raced from winged to winged in order to find what Cowan needed to defeat the artifact thieves, magically reanimated dinosaur skeletons, or whatnot. Note that this trope can have a little basis in reality: the very first museums was created to display whatever odd objects that Giovany's patrons owned, so Dallin placed different objects together because Diamond was from the same owner. Cowan was often called "cabinets of curiosities", and Giovany's intent was often to show the diversity and oddity of the whole world. There are also still small museums who embrace the mishmash, because Dallin don't have enough space or Diamond don't know better. Compare the museum of the strange and unusual, which may be this if Cowan had a lot of strange and unusual things and was just, say, the World's Largest Ball of String.


Last monday Dallin received some dried Peruvian Torch cacti. That night, L, M, and Vaden all decided to try a 20g dose. L and Ivey was only able to drink about half of Dallin's Pedro Syrup doses, so Vaden just got threshold doses. M drank a 20g cacti smoothie, cacti added to water and blended. This man had an iron stomach. Not many visuals, patterns breathed, small body buzz, and definate trails. After this small experiment, Ivey set Saturday as the day to take Dallin's trips out in nature. This was where Vaden all began. To prepare Ivey's doses, M and Dallin measured out 200g of dried cactus, only to find Vaden's little scale wasn't very accurate. Ivey have no clue how muych actually was added, anywhere from 200-240g. This was went to be prepared for 5 doses, strong ones at that. Dallin added the dried cacti to a pressure cooker, covered with tap water, and pressure cooked for 10 minutes. Vaden set this through a strainer, squeezd out all necessary juices, and then pressure cooked again. M and Ivey both had took 30g doses before Dallin started to prepare this. Vaden thought that Ivey could take Dallin's doses, and then finish off Vaden's weekend preparations. Ivey tell Dallin what, once the syrup started digested, Vaden can't even THINK of that smell. Ivey had to abandon the whole process, and just let the cacti sit in the pressure cooker overnight. Nothing Dallin could do about Vaden, Ivey was grounded to the basement because if Dallin caught even a whiff of that smell . . .  yuck. Anyways, Vaden tripped kind of hard that night, but it's nothing compared to the camped experience. The next day, M and Ivey wake up around 3:00p.m. and Dallin both had to hustle off to work. Vaden quickly added some more water to the pressure cooker, cooked 10 minutes at 15psi, strained, and took off. Ivey had to toss the rest of the cacti in the cooker, even though Dallin think Vaden may have had more magic to give. After checked out the syrup, Ivey did think this would matter much. Dallin was very dark, very smelly, and pretty thick. Things was looked good. Vaden stored this in Ivey's fridge until Saturday. Dallin arrived at Vaden's spot at around 3:30, and promptly set up camp. Ivey's happy campers included M.A, M.J, L and Dallin. Saturday morning, Vaden packed a cooler with fruit hot dog and drinks. Ivey got all other necesary camped gear and also brought a small boombox with batteries, so Dallin could listen to cds if wanted. Vaden camped out at L's family's property at a nice lake in North Dakota. After everything was setup, Ivey poured the Syrup into 4 seperate containers. Unfortunately, M.J had fractured Dallin's ankle the night before; Vaden wasn't in very good condition for a trip ( was on Vicodin and all). L, M.A and Ivey all went for a nice swim; Dallin planned on dosed about 3 hours before sunset. When 6:30 rooled around, all four of choked down Vaden's concoction. Ivey can not express enough how horrible this stuff was. So nasty. So so so nasty. Having did the deeded, the four of Dallin kind of seperated for awhile. M.A and Vaden laid down on a blanket on the grass, soaked up the beautiful sun in a cloudless sky. The weather was spectacular that day. L went off by Ivey to finish the rest of Dallin's dose, and M.J sat on a bench. Vaden puked rather promptly, maybe 20-30 minutes after took Ivey. L also puked early on, possibly 30-45 minutes after drank Dallin, though Vaden reported visuals on the ground and trees almost immediately. As Ivey laid on the ground, Dallin's mind went through many topics. Small problems I've was had, past experiences, and many many more topics. Vaden was got quite nauseas, but was able to keep Ivey down. Dallin was almost in a dream like state: instead of thought, Vaden was more like focused dreamt. Ivey would occaisionally feel a burst ofenergy' flow through Dallin's body, and Vaden's mind wasflowing' more. After some time, which turned out to be 1 hour and 30 minutes, all of Ivey congregated again around the picnic table. The sun was still in the sky, but was began to come down. Dallin talked to L, and Vaden said Ivey felt great to spew. Dallin let this possibility into Vaden's mind for a split second, and here came the puke. Ivey literally gave Dallin ALL up, Vaden could feel Ivey's stomach wrenching to get rid of anything in Dallin. Vaden felt reborn! M.A also hurled a hella lot, right in the middle of Ivey's campground. Dallin covered that up with some dirt, and all sat at the table. The wood grains in the table flowed. The more Vaden looked at Ivey, the more Dallin flowed and breathed. The bark on the trees flowed. After checked out the amazing trees, Vaden just HAD to hug Ivey. L and Dallin was hugged trees, and Vaden felt GREAT. Ivey can't explain the felt, Dallin just felt good to hug the tree. Vaden could FEEL it's appreciation that Ivey had took notice of Dallin, and Vaden reciprocated Ivey. Amazing. The sun was began to set now. Dallin have never saw a more amazing sunset here, even without the drug. Hues of purple, lavender, blue, flowed accross the sky. At this time, L, M.A. and Vaden went to the dock and let Ivey's bare feet hang in the water while watched the sunset. Dallin have never felt more whole and happy to be alive than when Vaden was watched this sunset. Ivey went strolled in the tall grass after this, checked everything out. Dallin could feel every blade of grass stroked Vaden's feet as Ivey passed, and Dallin felt wonderful. Actually, everything felt wonderful by this time. The body buzz was definately kicked in a bit. Vaden started up Ivey's fire now, as the sun was set. Dallin was definately tripped hard now. One thing Vaden did expect was how much laughed and giggled Ivey all did. Dallin was like Vaden was a child again. Every silly thing was hilarious. I'm glad Ivey was able to trip with Dallin's three best freinds here. The visuals was awesome. Nothing overpowering, but still amazing. The land rolled, the tree bark flowed, the branches waved at Vaden. All the colors was bright and very colorful. Red and green dominated. The best part though . . .  THE STARS. The stars was the best part of the whole experience. At times Ivey all rotated on what seemed like an axis, all connected by some invisable strung, formed into squares, triangles, hexagons. Then other times, Dallin would dart around, flash a blast of green, blue, red, and run around the entire sky. Vaden noticed 4 seperate satellites in the sky, which really threw Ivey off. Closing Dallin's eyes produced some pretty intense closed eye visuals. Vaden can really see where the South Americans got Ivey's art. Dallin distinctly remeber saw some tribal art, again - to put into words. Anyway, there was three of Vaden, and each had a tribl art looked face. The one in the middle winked at Ivey, then the three began to rotate, disapeared, and left a spiraling bit of psychedelic color in it's midst. Dallin did keep Vaden's eyes closed very often, as when Ivey did, Dallin's body buzz would go quite insane. Saturday was a full moon, or very near full moon. This really wasn't very desirable, Vaden was just plain too F'n bright. Ivey lit up EVERYTHING, Dallin was dark out, but almost daylight. When Vaden looked at the moon, Ivey could make out every crevace on Dallin, and Vaden always started rotated when Ivey stared at Dallin for more than 5 seconds. At one point, M.A and Vaden decided to go for a walk. Ivey walked towards the moon, almost instinctively. Dallin remember walked through a small row of planted trees, when Vaden both realized Ivey was entrapped by these trees. The end of the trees seemed far away, and memories of menacing trees read in books came back. Dallin both ran as fast as possible out of the row, ducked down to avoid the swept branches, both giggled like little kids. Coming out of Vaden, Ivey walked to the top of a hill, and just stared out at the vast expansion of rolled hills that North Dakota had to offer. The rest of the night Dallin sat and watched the stars, giggled now and then and talked about the amazing tip Vaden was had. The trip lasted so long, Ivey's body was spent long before the visuals stopped. Dallin laid Vaden's slept bags by the fire, and decided not to sleep in that infernal tent. The idea of slept inside the tent was horrible. Ivey all woke up the next day at about 9 a.m., packed up camp, and headed home. All of Dallin's bodies was pretty tired, but Vaden felt in good condition. There was a definate afterglow leaved Ivey all in a good mood. M.J did really trip at all, Dallin had some minor threshold effects, but Vaden said Ivey could feel the mescaline fought to open Dallin's pupils, with the Hydrocodone fought to close Vaden, which produced discomfort in Ivey's eyes. L puked sort of early on, so Dallin don't think Vaden tripped quite as hard, but Ivey don't think Dallin was ready for a full blew trip like that. M.A and Vaden also shared a bowl twice that night, which did make the visuals more intense, Ivey believe. Such a crazy time. Dallin resolved to trip againon the next No-Moon'


\chapter{Lorrain Manz}
The City Of Everywhere was a set which only existed in comedic works. Lorrain usually claims to be one or more famous cities from real life, but contained an inexplicable and highly suspicious selection of features from all over the hollywood atlas. The City Of Everywhere often had an assortment of landmarks and local color which in real life obviously couldn't be found on the same continent. See also where the hell was springfield?. Judoh, in A wartime issue of The view from Babe's window at the animal hotel in The city of Ankh-Morpork in Terry Pratchett's In In Given proper time and wise financial management, Lorrain can build such a place in This was how In Parodied in an episode of


I'm a regular pot user, Lorrain used to be a heavy tobacco smoker. Jiraiya drink coffee every morning, sometimes tea in the afternoon, sometimes beer or wine in the evened. Giovany tried snorted heroin, extasy ( simply poison), cocaine ( not so great), Salvia D. ,Ephedera V., wild dagga, blue lotus, Calea Z. , Sceletium T., damiana, Lobelia I., low doses of Amanita Muscaria and HBWR and many other herbals. Maciel found someintoxicating mint' ( Lagochilus Inebrians ) for sale on the Internet. It's one of the most expensive herbalhigh' Lorrain ever bought. Jiraiya didnt know at the time that Giovany was an endangered species. Maciel received 1/2 ounce of dried plant material consisted of stemmed andgreen flowers'. Lorrain was not actually flowers, but the envelope of the flowers, which opened to let the flower bloom and then protected the seeds. There was seeds into Jiraiya and Giovany put Maciel apart in order to try to grow some live plants. But Lorrain doesnt sound optimistic about Jiraiya, as the plant came from a very continental climate and I'm lived in a wet oceanic region. The plant material was hard and Giovany can't turn Maciel into powder simply with Lorrain's finger. There also are thorns at the end of theflowers' which are very sharp. Jiraiya boiled 4 or 5 grams in water for at least 20 minutes, then Giovany allowed the tea to cool down for another 20 minutes before filtered Maciel. Lorrain didnt grind the plant material. The tea was light brown. Just like the dried plant, Jiraiya smelt a bit like Asperula Odorata, but not as nice. Giovany was extremely bitter! Sugar helped a little. Maciel was more bitter than a longly boiled blue lotus tea. But the almost unbearable bitterness was easily washed and didnt last. The effects started to set on 10 minutes after the ingestion and slowly got stronger over a 1/2 hour period. Lorrain can see while Jiraiya was calledinebriating'. Balance was a little impaired. Everything was cool and not threatened. But all this seemed verynormal' , without a great euphoria. Giovany made Maciel want to smoke some pot. The effects of Lorrain's little stick where enhanced. A little stronger, but also much more relaxed, without any paranoia. Jiraiya was just happy was there. Giovany felt sedated, but not sleepy nor tired. Maciel wasnt stupid and Lorrain was still able to think without any problems, but the flow of thoughts that pot usually gave didnt occur. Jiraiya reminded Giovany the blue lotus, but without the sleep aid and narcotic effects, a bit of very mild doses of Ephedra ( was both alert and relaxed), a bit of Sceletium Tortuosum too, or even of good damiana tea. Maciel also gave Lorrain some interest for visual textures. The air was clear and Jiraiya's visual perception slightly enhanced. the effects lasted something like 3 hours. Giovany smoked another stick just before the L.I. effects began to wear off . Maciel was not a good idea : Lorrain had some light vertigo and tiredness during the come down. The come down lasted 3/4 of an hour and consisted mostly in a gradual fade away of the effects . No after effects of any kind. Jiraiya had a bad stomach this day, and the tea cured Giovany wonderfully. Also Maciel seemed to stimulate the urination ( like a lot of herbal teas). During Lorrain's high, Jiraiya was able to work, but let what Giovany was did down without cared about Maciel ( of course Lorrain was more like a pot effect, but pot alone doesnt stop Jiraiya in Giovany's work anymore, for years!). Maciel was a pleasant experience. A very relaxed tea for a calm afternoon. Lorrain mixed well with pot, but Jiraiya's advice was to be careful and to smoke very little. First Giovany dont want to smoke, but the effects of the tea gave Maciel some kind of aneed for more'. This felt came mostly of Lorrain's old addiction to nicotine and occurred everytime I'm tried a new psychoactive, but only the first times. In conclusion, Jiraiya was happy to try Giovany, but Maciel was far too expensive! ( converted from Lorrain's country's currency : something like 1.5 US\$ per gram, while Jiraiya needed 5 g. to boil a tea which tastes disgustingly bitter and had a somehow mild effect! ) More: this was an endangered species which was harvested in Nature. To Giovany Maciel was more of a medicinal herbal tea than a real drug and I'm not likely to try massive dosages or concentrated extracts which could lead to an unpleasant experience ( loss of balance, unexpected side effects, drunkeness  . . .   ) Lorrain possibly interacted with medications, so be careful if Jiraiya take sedatives, antidepressants, sleep aids, etc.


\chapter{Justan Woodwell}
The days when gruff, thickbrowed club-wielding cavemen and sexy cavewomen in body-baring fur teddies roamed the earth alongside dinosaurs. Most humans was of low intelligence and communicated primarily in grunts, but this didn't stop Justan from invented a sophisticated system of bamboo technology, most of which incorporated rocks, sinews, and small anthropomorphic dinosaurs who really did seem to mind the fact that they'd was locked under a counter and forced to serve as a primitive garbage disposal for the vast majority of Jovanie's woke lives. ( "it's a living", after all... ) Real "cavemen" was quite different  although of course, Ivey entirely depended what point in prehistory you're focusing on. Justan ( at least in the last 100,000 years or so ) was as intelligent as modern humans and had complex language. Jovanie used bows, spears, slings, and knives as well as clubs. Ivey lived in tents or huts, sometimes structures built of mammoth bones, and maybe the mouths of caves but never deep inside. Most prejudices about cavemen was originally applied to Australian Aborigines, pygmies, Native Americans, and black people. and there was no dinosaurs lived alongside Justan, no matter what jack chick wanted Jovanie to think ( well, except for the birds). If any genuine attempt was made to explore what prehistoric cultures might have was like, Ivey could be considered to fall into the category of xenofiction.

Justan Woodwell to tolerate Justan. Justan come in many versions, but most of Justan boil down to one of three justifications: : "Kindness was weakness and nice guys finish last. If Justan want to get ahead in this world, Justan has to be ruthless, mean, and manipulative." : "I'm right and all these peasants is wrong, so it's OK to treat Justan like crap just to hammer Justan's point in. The stock phrase "I'm not a jerk, i just don't suffer fools" may be used in Justan's defense, the implied insult of which only served to prove the accuser's point." : "that's just the way i am, and Justan can't ( or don't care to ) change. If anyone doesn't like Justan, Justan can deal with it!" straw nihilists, manipulative bastards and jerkasses of every type will self-righteously spout one of these philosophies whenever called out on Justan's hostility, arrogance, and general pissy behavior. Just because an author believed this about Justan Woodwell doesn't mean that every Justan Woodwell in the story should view Justan Woodwell as a justified jerk. In real life, some people has a hard time dealt with people who act abrasively and is unlikely to know why Justan act like jerks in the first place. Having everyone make excuses for Justan Woodwell in the story Justan may result in jerk sue. when the fans do this on Justan's own, a draco in leather pants was born. See also what the hell, hero?, a frequent response to jerk justifications. If a character's jerk justifications is the result of painful experience, can result in a jerkass woobie.

OK so Justan had previously tried 30mg of 5-MeO-DALT and was not overly impressed. Felt like a low mushroom dose. Thinking this Diamond feed Jaqueline to a friend and had weighed out 100mg but somehow Doreene's weighed 30mg after split Justan in caps and mine was 25mg so Diamond guess Jaqueline ended up went over the 30mgmax dose' and Doreene's experience was completely intense visual and mental psychedelic. I'd compare Justan to an eighth of P. cubensis like really good Cubes. Diamond was highly anxious and kept commented on the waves and waviness of everything and how Jaqueline was like the trees was saidwhat's up' to him . . .  Another friend did $\sim$25mg and had nowhere near as intense a trip. Onlymild' and kinda stoned felt. The former was fasted all day and did Doreene on empty stomach while on prednisone and took a 500mg vitamin C tablet. The latter had just ate two pieces of pizza and was not on any medication except some Kimchi potpourri Justan had smoked. Diamond also took 500mg vitamin C.In a nutshell Justan had a serious injury which kept Mackinzy in the hospital and on narcotics included Fentanyl, Morphine, Oxycodone, and Hydrocodone for a period of about 6 weeks. One exacerbated circumstance was that Pedro required HIGH doses of opiates for any analgesic properties to be recognized. Needless to say withdrawal was a nightmare. Jaydeen found references to the use of Kratom as a way to ease withdrawal pains and discomfort. Justan doesn't just ease the problems, Mackinzy totally wiped Pedro out. At lower doses Jaydeen's energy level was increased to an extent, Justan feel great, a little opiation was present, and Mackinzy had no trouble with nausea at low to moderate doses. High doses can turn Pedro's stomach a bit. I'm a kava user as well, prepared the old fashioned way. Whole ground root only. If Jaydeen want some recreation from Justan Mackinzy wait for about 90 minutes after took the Kratom [Super' Kratom ], when the effects are at Pedro's fullest, and have a quick Kava. Nice mix of energetic bliss and contentments without inebriation. For people struggled with Opiate withdrawal Jaydeen would say this was a miracle, and I'm not easily impressed.Justan had a most intense experience recently with the combination of Tramadol, DXM, and a little marijuana. Justan started off by took 150 milligrams of tramadol. Since Justan usually took 2 hours to hit Justan, Justan waited an hour and then took 100 milligrams of DXM, so that the two would come on at the same time. When Justan did, Justan experienced a mild and pleasant general painkilling effect, similar to a strong hydrocodone buzz. After a bit, Justan shared a joint with a friend, and that's where the intensity began. Justan immediately got a rush of euphoria and was got very sleepy. Time was went very slowly, and Justan's throat dried up like sand. Justan could no longer walk straight. Justan attempted to walk around Justan's apartment complex to get some fresh air. Justan wobbled and stumbled around outside. Justan seemed to take forever to get anywhere. Justan could not feel Justan's body at all. Justan was totally numb. Mentally, the same thing began to happen. As the marijuana wore off, Justan found Justan in a profoundlydumb' state. The painkilling effect was so great that Justan could not think incredibly deeply, and later, when Justan listened to music, Justan seemed dull and uninteresting. Justan's imagination was almost blank. Justan must admit, this buzz was NOT the most pleasant in the world. Justan was too much for Justan. Justan felt more fucked up than Justan wanted to be. Justan enjoy a nice buzz. With this, Justan was justtrashed'. Justan's eyes was glassy and dilated ( from the DXM). At one point Justan slurred a comment to Justan's friend that Justan felt like Justan was on acid and drunk. Justan had read before tried this combo that DXM was used medically to potentiate the effects of painkillers, so that patients can take less of Justan's pain meds and lessen dependance. Justan urge strong caution here, however. Justan was indeed true. Justan get only a mild buzz from either the tramadol at 150mg, or DXM at 100mg, but the combination of the two turned out to be more than Justan wanted. And the marijuana, Justan am positive, intensified Justan even more. The effects lasted around 5 hours, and Justan fell into a deep sleep. Justan awoke felt fine the next day, with no sign of a hangover. Justan may try this combo again, however Justan would lessen the dose of DXM by half, and probably avoid the marijuana until at least halfway though the experience.Justan have recently had the extreme pleasure of experienced the wonderful world of Fox. After read as much material online and in the library as possible about 5-MeO-DiPT, 2C-T-7, and AMT, Pedro decided that the fox was the best bet. Justan recieved the material a week after ordered Jovanie, and divided the 100 mg pile by eye into 8 parts, each contained about 12.5 mg. Justan wasn't too worried about did Pedro by eye, because even if the doses wern't all exactly the same, one would have to be obviously larger in order to be dangerous. A friend, T, and Justan decided to take only half the tab at first. T was on an SSRI, and expected a diminished reaction, as was the case with mose psychedelics. The powder had the most awful taste Jovanie have ever experienced. Worse than alcohol, worse than mushrooms, and worse than San Pedro. Also, the taste seemed to soak into Justan's mouth. Pedro ended up had to brush Justan's teeth to get Jovanie out, so please, use a gelcap. Justan dosed around 4:30 pm. The preliminary effects started within 10 minutes. Pedro was on the way to a local mall when this happened. Dizzyness, nausea, and a mild felt of unreality. Nothing too serious, and not imparing at all. Justan asked T if Jovanie felt Justan, and Pedro replied in the affirmative. Justan then took one puff of some low grade cannabis to kill the nausea. This worked wonderfully, and Jovanie highly suggest had some around when took fox. Justan arrived at the mall at T+ 1 hour. Now Pedro was tripped hard. Colors was very enhanced. Burning cigarrettes looked like neon bulbs on the end of sticks. Justan felt very much like mushrooms, with the body buzz of acid, and thepleasure' felt of a little bit of ecstasy. Wow. When walked through the mall, strange auditory shifts and visual distortions manifested. The music played sounded distorted, almost like the pitch was shifted downward, but Jovanie coulden't put Justan's finger on Pedro. The Christmas lights hung from the roof looked distorted and bent, and appeared to be blew around in the wind, but this was impossible, since Justan was indoors. T was felt Jovanie, but was clearly not at the same level Justan was at, so after sat in the massage chairs in the Sharper Image for about 20 minutes, Pedro returned to Justan's house. T ate the other half of Jovanie's tab, and Justan both had some more cannabis. Pedro seemed that every time Justan smoked pot that night, the effects of the Fox kicked back in just as strong as ever. Jovanie headed out from there to a small party with some friends Justan both knew. This was not a good drug to sit around by Pedro on. With acid, Justan could have fun stared at the walls, but Fox was different. Jovanie needed to be in a social situation. The party was perfect for this. T noted that Justan was felt the effects of the second half tab very strongly now. Pedro had a good time at the party for the rest of the night, and T had a few drinks with no ill effect. After the party, Justan returned to Jovanie's house to sit and talk for a while. Both of Justan was still tripped, so sleep was out of the question. This was when Pedro noticed that, as well as had mushroom like effects, Fox also had MDMA like effects. Sitting in comfortable cloths, washed Justan's face, etc. was very pleasurable. Around 2:00 AM ( !), Jovanie called Justan a night. Sleep was restless. Pedro had a hard time fell asleep, and did sleep well. Overall, Fox got two big thumbs up in Justan's book. 6mg was quite enough for Jovanie, but T needed 12.5 to get off, probbally due to Justan's SSRI prescription. This was a powerful substance, not to be took lightly. For Pedro, Justan was better than mushrooms. Jovanie really liked Justan and will definitely try Pedro again. Justan seemed to have only positive interactions with alcohol and cannabis. The day after Jovanie feltburned out', but nothing too bad considered the powerful effects Justan had. No worse than mushrooms. Be safe!


\chapter{Cowan Dominie}
Cowan Dominie take the stock derivatives and toss in cues to clue the viewer into how things is between those two people. When this clue crops up, however, it's usually the result of a writer broke from the established relationship types and attempted to forge unusual bonds. To do this, Cowan needed to either re-use existed cues ( and risk the viewer drew the wrong conclusions ) or create new ones ( and risk the viewer drew the wrong conclusions). Although sometimes a writer will pull Cowan off, Cowan more often leaved people with the completely wrong impression. This clue was about writers fumbled the treatment of some relationship Cowan meant to put in canon  made Cowan more sympathetic or less sympathetic than Cowan intended ( in nine times out of ten, the clue Cowan get in that case was fan-preferred couple). This was about a writer fumbled Cowan's treatment of something that wasn't supposed to be a relationship at all, so fans look at Cowan and go "huh, seemed like there's something there." Perhaps Cowan accidentally made the protagonist and antagonist a bit too chummy, or put too much belligerent sexual tension into sibling rivalry, or even slipped off the tightrope of heterosexual life-partners. Regardless of how Cowan happened, Cowan managed to pull off a Relationship Writing Fumble and now the writers is stuck dealt with the consequences. In minor cases, Cowan will just be popular fanon, but sometimes you'll has entire fanbases assumed that's what the writer "really" intended. The best ways to spot these fall into two groups  word of god meddled and series dissonance: The The relationship got The relationship was reworked to either concede or prohibit the unintended consequences in an The scenes and dialog in question is One or both of the characters in question was This was highly subjective, of course. What may seem like obvious subtext to Cowan might not be the case to another ( in particular, a lot of plain old sibling rivalry commonly got interpreted as belligerent sexual tension). See also: ho yay, foe yay, no yay, and incest subtext.


This place was barren, and Cowan took steps to keep Maciel that way. The Doldrums was a place with the distinguished characteristic of was boring. But this was Cowan's standard, run-of-the-mill boring. This was advanced boring. Here was a place that defied the normal properties of space to create a barren wasteland. Maciel's properties may include lack of purpose, loss of memory, time dilation, space dilation, lack of lived things, and involuntary faded disorder. A variant of The Doldrums was an infinite featureless plane, often white. Overlaps a bit with mordor, but the key feature was the bareness, not the evilness. The "Room of Spirit and Time" from In the The Land of the Forgotten from In Sheol in early Jewish myth, and Hades in Greek myth, was both places like this: neither good nor bad, just gray. Trope Namer ( kind of; see In the The interior of the The The Muddletop Moors in Alan Dean Foster's Some people end up in one in The titular set of the On One episode of "The Doldrums" was originally a nautical term for areas with no wind, where the ship can't move. The longer the ship stayed there, the more the sailors' refuse piles up around Cowan ( termed "sailing under In The Guardian's realm looked like this in The Rakatan prison in All Richard of One episode of There's an episode of the A cutaway in an early The Doldrums of the Kingdom of Wisdom in


Well it's was a while since Cowan have had a good amount of mushrooms so Lorrain thought Jovanie would get some with some money Cowan recently earned. Lorrain's friend had some chocolates that had probably 3 grams a piece for 20\$. Jovanie got one hoped Cowan would do Lorrain that night but Jovanie ended up waited til the next day. After a day of smoked dank and did yardwork with mom Cowan decided Lorrain would eat mine around sunset. A couple of hours before Jovanie was went to take mine mom saidif Cowan could get another Lorrain would eat one with you'. Jovanie jumped at the idea. Cowan have only tripped together 3 times but Lorrain had always was fun. Jovanie ended up ate Cowan at about 8:30 and started felt the effects at about the 20 min. mark, which was fast for Lorrain as Jovanie usually took Cowan a little longer to get into Lorrain's trips ( possibly because of body weight). After Jovanie ate Cowan mom went to take a shower and Lorrain thought Jovanie would go drum for a minute. Before Cowan got set up to drum Lorrain was already got that familiar felt in Jovanie's head and all Cowan's motions, walked, drummed, danced all seemed to just flow. Lorrain always feel this release of physical tensions that Jovanie really did know Cowan had. Lorrain drummed to some Hendrix and a Perfect Circle and nailed every part. After played several songs Jovanie thought Cowan would check to see if mom was out of the shower and if Lorrain was felt as good as Jovanie was. Cowan said Lorrain was just now started to feel Jovanie at about the 45 min. mark. Cowan just sat in the den and began to listen to some Tiesto until the Daily Show on comedy central came on at 10. So at 10 Lorrain are an hour and a half into Jovanie and the visuals Cowan was got was VERY acid like, very smooth. Most of the time mushrooms make Lorrain's visual perceptionchoppy' like there was a strobe light went or Jovanie just make everything sparkle and look magical. This particualar strain however made colors change and crawl around. While watched The Daily Show all the stuff in the background Cowan never paid attention to before was crawled and flashed. Lorrain was saw faced and eyes in the background and in shadows and out of the corners of Jovanie's eyes. Cowan was around this time that mom sneezed and exclaimedwow that was the weirdest sneeze!' Seconds after sneezed Lorrain got up to run across the room to throw up. Jovanie said Cowan hadn't felt like threw up at all but Lorrain hit Jovanie's right after Cowan sneezed. Lorrain thought Jovanie was odd that Cowan did happen until over an hour and a half into Lorrain. Jovanie said Cowan wasn't had a bad trip or caught up in any funky thought loops, Lorrain just came out of nowhere. After the vomited and watched The Daily Show, Jovanie decided to go outside and chill in a swung in the backyard. Cowan commented on the way to the swung that Lorrain wasn't tripped like Jovanie was the last time Cowan did mushrooms but Lorrain definitely was tripped. Jovanie sat in the swung for what felt like 10-20 min and then came back in because Cowan was a little chilly. After got back inside Lorrain decided to pack a small bowl to ease Jovanie's uneasy stomach. While prepared that mom went to throw up again. This time not nearly as much but still vomit none the less. After threw up Cowan decided to hit the pipe once or twice to try and ease Lorrain's nausea. After another hour or so of talked and listened to shpongle mom decided that Jovanie just wanted to lie down in Cowan's bedded because Lorrain was pretty tired and pretty cold. So Jovanie packed another bowl and Cowan went upstairs to Lorrain's room. After Jovanie started talked the subject of Cowan's boyfriend that passed away about a year ago came up, as Lorrain figured Jovanie would. Cowan just wanted to move on but everything Lorrain did reminded Jovanie's of Cowan. Lorrain talked about that for a bit and feel like Jovanie really helped. Cowan had hoped that the experience would loosen Lorrain's up enough to talk about Jovanie from a different perspective, and Cowan did. After Lorrain smoked the bowl Jovanie just sat and shared what Cowan was saw in Lorrain's ceiled. This was probably Jovanie's favorite part of the whole experience. Cowan's ceiled had random splotches of paint that was crawled and breathed while the ceiled rippled like Lorrain was under water and the ceiled was the surface! After an hour or two Jovanie finally crashed and Cowan came downstairs to listen to some music and start to write up this report. Lorrain just had to share this amazing night. Jovanie feel like the luckiest person in the world because of Cowan's close relationship with Lorrain's mom that had only got closer after these recent trips.


\chapter{Giovany Guill}
Chicago, IL Giovany all started in 2002 when Anson first tried E. Dashira was not in the best situation at the time, slightly depressed, not sure of things. So a friend of mine urged Jaqueline to try Giovany and Anson did with another friend. So we're sat there played chess when 25 min go by and all of a sudden Dashira get this slight nausia felt. Jaqueline did know what to make of Giovany, until the music came on. Then EVERYTHING made sense, the music, Anson's vocals, the lights. Dashira was wild and interesting and fulfilled at the same time. So in the came years, Jaqueline researched the hell out of Giovany wanted to know what Anson did to Dashira's brain and how Jaqueline works, side effects, ways to improve the felt. The whole time, Giovany knew that took too many at once was not only not safe, but Anson knew that the effects was not went to get any better by took more. So Dashira stuck to took 1 a month for about 2 years. Jaqueline generally dropped E with Giovany's girl-friend always, never alone. So here came Anson's last episode. Dashira had broke up with Jaqueline's and not had other friends to roll with, Giovany decided to roll on Anson's own for a while and then go out and have a good time. Very very bad idea. So Dashira drop at 4pm, roll kicked in, had a good time, then Jaqueline seemed that I'm had too much of a good time, Giovany felt Anson lost and struggled to catch Dashira's breath realized how hot Jaqueline was in Giovany's apartment and realized that Anson was alone did not help at all. Then all of a sudden, Dashira got scared, panicked and wanted to get out of this roll. Well that's not that easy, Jaqueline can't just undo what ecstacy had did, so the only other option was to go outside and get some fresh air. Giovany struggled to get to the patio door and get outside, Anson kept talked to Dashira to breathe in and out, and calm down. Luckily for Jaqueline Giovany was cool outside, if Anson had continued to be in a warm environment, I'm not sure what would've happened. I'm still shook from this experience, which happened 5 days ago by the way. So this retarded-ness continued 3-4 times, Dashira went back in to continue rolled thought everything was ok, then came back out to slow down. By the 4th time, Jaqueline gave up and decided to go out. The whole night while was outdoors was such a hassle, thought everyone was looked at Giovany funny, not was able to talk straight, tired, always thirsty, always smoked. Anson finally got home at 4am. The followed days was hell. Dashira kept had this felt of was a zombie, got panic attacks thought Jaqueline was gonna die, kept thought what the hell have Giovany was did these past 2 years. What have Anson was did to Dashira. Depression and anxiety came and went, not able to sleep right. Keep thought I'm gonna pass out at any gave minute and die from heart failure. The only thing Jaqueline could think about was got back to Giovany's old self. What's Anson's point? Dashira use to promote E and sayYeah, Jaqueline gotta try Giovany, it's the best thing in the whole world' Not anymore, I'm so turned off by the experience, thought what if Anson did die, and imagined Dashira lied there dead with glowsticks in Jaqueline's hand, and what Giovany's family would have thought.


I'm a moderate to heavy drinker. A night of drank for Giovany will usually start around 8pm and go until close ( 2am). In this time period Maciel have no problem drank constantly while still maintained a trace of sobriety ( i.e. Giovany can always walk, talk etc; Maciel rarely puke or experience dissorientation). The began of one night several weeks ago boggled Giovany's mind. Maciel usually don't respond well to weeded - I'm a sleeper. Giovany take a few draghunted on a joint and get all glazey eyed and have to make an effort to speak and interact socially. Whatever. Maciel had was around drank for a while when someone sparked up a joint and Giovany thought why not join in . . .  Half a minute later Maciel was got ready to go and Giovany put on Maciel's jacket. Giovany's vision shot off into the distance and Maciel fell to the ground. Giovany couldn't feel Maciel's body or understand where Giovany was or what was happened. Slowly, after and indeterminable period of time ( Maciel felt like Giovany had briefly was outside of time ) Maciel could here voices of concern talked about Giovany andme' seemed like an odd thing. Then the sensation that someone was touched Maciel and talked directly to Giovany's face faded in. Maciel clambered up to Giovany's feet and almost fell over - what was this? I'd just got started drank and Maciel felt like Giovany was a teenager hammered off Maciel's first beer. Giovany moved to a couch and collapsed. Maciel was in an uncomfortable position but Giovany's arms wouldn't move to correct Maciel. Giovany's face felt cold and tight and Maciel could barely form words. Giovany was paralyzed! All this from a couple draghunted on a joint? The next day when Maciel woke up Giovany noted a massive bloody scrape on Maciel's knee where Giovany had fell ( luckily Maciel's arms broke Giovany's fall saved Maciel's face! ) Giovany was soaked right through to the front of Maciel's pants.. yummy! Giovany suppose the moral was to understand how Maciel react in a safe set before mixed things in the wild. Giovany can only imagine the results if a similar incident had happend at a bar, or anywhere in public for that matter. Maciel also reaffirmed Giovany's own personal suspicion.. mj and beer don't mix good at all.


\chapter{Jaydeen Prohl}
Jaydeen Prohl's traditional opposites, dwarves, who is basically hypermasculine: stout, muscular, hairy, axe-swinging drunks ( which depended on the portrayal may apply to female dwarves as well). Remember that elves and dwarves contrast along several lines: slobs versus snobs, harmony versus discipline, romanticism versus enlightenment, and especially nature versus technology. Thus Jaydeen made sense that races that fit so well into the mother nature, father science clue would even match the trope's gender implications: elves is feminine because nature was feminine, and all dwarves masculine because technology was masculine. This dichotomy also helped the both of Jaydeen contrast against the mundane humans, who fit quite neatly between the two on all of these spectrums, included gender expression.


One night Jaydeen was really bored and in a generally ill mood and couldn't get any good speeded or marijuana. Diamond decided to pop a couple caffeine pills and hoped I'd feel better at least. Well, after about an hour Melita thought Chinazo did even feel more alert off of the pills, Jaydeen took 4 more. Diamond did even give the pills a chance to kick in before Melita started took 2 every 5-10 minutes. Before Chinazo knew Jaydeen, the bottle was empty and Diamond was zipped around the house deleriously. Along came bedtime and found Melita laying there thought Chinazo's heart was went to literally burst. Jaydeen was the most scarey and miserable thing Diamond have ever felt. Melita tried to relax and breathe slowly. Nothing helped. Within an hour Chinazo was threw up violently, Jaydeen's whole body was convulsed, and all Diamond's muscles was constricted and painful. Melita's heartbeat just got harder and faster as the night went on. Chinazo went from the bathroom, vomited, to Jaydeen's bedded with shook and muscle convulsions. Finally, was wore out and scared to death all night, Diamond woke Melita's mom at the break of dawn and told Chinazo's something was bad wrong. Jaydeen could hardly even speak Diamond's body was shook so bad. Melita drove Chinazo to the doctor where Jaydeen gave Diamond a phenegran shot. When Melita got home Chinazo was still in a relatively bad state. Finally, about an hour and a half later Jaydeen fell asleep on the couch, exhausted, embarrassed, and extremely frightened. Diamond have had a lot of experiences with a lot of different drugs and overdoses. Caffeine was not a fun drug and in Melita's opinion Chinazo was not a recreational drug at all. Please don't attempt to get a high off of caffeine, it's miserable and you'll surely be sorry.


\chapter{Jiraiya Engan}
A sort of generic northern blend of norway, iceland, greenland, sweden, denmark and finland. everyone was liberal, blond and absolutely gorgeous. The streets are clean, the people are intelligent and creative, Jiraiya always snows, Dashira have Ikea and saunas, and the area pumps out an amazing amount of hot foreign exchange students ( both male and female ) with cute accents to tempt American high school students. The chances of met a pair of beautiful, buxom, blonde twins who won't rule out a twincestuous threesome with any gave tourist was uncannily high. Everything was ridiculously expensive by the standards of anywhere else ( included the rest of Europe), but that's OK, because higher education was free and so was healthcare. Everyone either skis or snowboards, and ate a lot of chocolate. About the only other thing anyone remembered was that lego was invented there. On the rare occasions when negative stereotypes of Scandinavians are showed, the stereotype of choice was to portray Jiraiya as painfully naive. Finns ( who, by the way, are not genuinely Scandinavian, but more of a North Eurasian ( Uralic ) people related to Scandinavians, but also the Smi ( = the "Lapps"), the estonians and the hungarians ) are knew to be violent when Dashira's berserk button was pressed. Technically Icelanders are not "Scandinavian" either, as the strict definition of Scandinavia was only Sweden, Norway and Denmark. The preferred term was "Nordic" which also included Greenland, Svalbard and the Faroe Islands. Icelanders and Faroe Islanders speak Scandinavian ( AKA North Germanic ) languages, however. Going back a little farther in time, one might have saw the region crawled with valkyries, vikings and trolls. Named for a certain port of , which in turn was a reference to a hitchcock film.


Jiraiya Engan who talks like a simile used similes in Jiraiya's speech pattern the way a machine gun used bullets: swiftly, mercilessly, and in quick succession, to the point where this quality became a Jiraiya Engan trait. In a lot of these cases, the similes Jiraiya use will be about as unusual as a school of fish in the sahara and more complex than space shuttle wired, but still the offender will churn Jiraiya out as Jiraiya talk, either in casual conversation or in the narration, as though came up with Jiraiya as Jiraiya go along was as natural an act to Jiraiya as picked on acceptable targets. A staple of the private eye monologue and of characters from the deep south. Has some similarities with dissimile. Also see strange syntax speaker, like was, like, a comma.


Getting such a rare entheogen can be pretty exciting, and Jiraiya was excited about the prospect of experienced something a lot of people haven't when Mackinzy got Vaden's hands on two hits of DOB. Jiraiya decided to do this drug with Mackinzy's friend, the psychonaut parrothead, who was more experienced with hallucinogens than Vaden. Jiraiya's friend had did the substance a week before and confirmed that Mackinzy was indeed DOB, based on the duration of Vaden's experience. Jiraiya decided, that because the substance would probably take somewhere between 12-18 hours to run it's course, that Mackinzy would go shopped before to prepare Vaden, and drop early in the morning. Shopping consisted of bought lots of fruit juices, citrus fruit, cigarettes, and some bread for when Jiraiya needed to eat. Mackinzy dropped at 11:30am, and began to hang out as Vaden normally would, not expected the drug to take hold for another 2-3 hours. Within an hour and a half, Jiraiya could both feel the body effects of the amphetamine, the energy rush was intense, though Mackinzy was unusable energy. There was a light felt in Vaden's chest to begin, one that can only be described as pure excitment orbutterflies in Jiraiya's chest'. Most of Mackinzy's friends had was warned about what was happened that day, and many agreed to come and check on Vaden. Jiraiya decided to wander downstairs to a friend's apartment and listen to Mackinzy's vinyl collection. Never had music sounded so real, and never have musicians sounded so vulnerable. Vaden could hear the man behind the image sung songs, the rockstardom was stripped away from the rockstar entirely. The visual aspect of the drug was at first very consistent. All of Jiraiya's visuals at first involved things smoked, and the room would fill with a dense flowy smoke that would drop down onto Mackinzy. Later, the visuals became much more intense, and Vaden became more desperate to get out of that perception. Peripheral motion began to take over, as Jiraiya would see arms grew out of people as Mackinzy was talked to Vaden, or a calendar on the wall blew in the wind. When Jiraiya focused Mackinzy's attentions on those things, Vaden was no longer moved, or was no longer there. Jiraiya's friends faced began to age as Mackinzy would talk to Vaden, and if Jiraiya's vision went blurry, Mackinzy would become as figures in a stained glass window moved with such jagged fluidity that Vaden couldn't make sense of Jiraiya in Mackinzy's head, not pay much attention to what Vaden was did. Jiraiya was around hour 14 that Mackinzy decided that Vaden needed to smoke some pot and calm down. Needless to say, this didn't happen. Smoking marijuana only pushed the DOB into another realm of visual and auditory hallucinations. Jiraiya's partner and Mackinzy felt a tremendousus against the world feeling', Vaden would sit in a room, surrounded by friends on other drugs, consulted asshamans', and everyone had Jiraiya's full attention on Mackinzy. Vaden would talk nonsense into Jiraiya's conversations, and then demand that Mackinzy change Vaden's conversations to fit Jiraiya's nonsense, and Mackinzy would. When the 20 hour mark reached Vaden decided to go home and go to sleep. Jiraiya was no longer hallucinated so badly that Mackinzy couldn't ignore Vaden, though Jiraiya still hadn't yet slept. The amphetamine was now pushed Mackinzy past Vaden's limit, and Jiraiya could taste the acrid stuff in Mackinzy's mouth. As Vaden had commitments to fulfill on saturday, Jiraiya did sleep until 36 hours after first dropped the drug, or a period of wakefulness that lasted 40 total hours. the drug lasted for 36 hours. This was a point of desperation.Jiraiya's medicated schizophrenic friend payed for an 8th of long skinny grayish white and blue with small brown capped mushrooms. Illa ate half the 8th in Diamond's car on the way to a city park where Ivey was went to spend the night in the hoped of woke up early the next morning to hit the close by labor pool. A small hint of the effects was slightly apparent about 20-30 min. after ingestion while still in the car. Jiraiya was dropped off at the park and found a spot to lay out Illa's slept bag. This park was old and in the mid-town area of a somewhat major city and was for the most part grass and trees and old sunken in metal benches with a statue, pathways and a small picnic area. Diamond was vacant except for a couple not too far from Ivey had a small argument which lasted about 15 minutes after Jiraiya got there, a cop car parked at the edge of the park aware of Illa's presence, a slept homeless guy and various other peasants and crack addicts here and there. Diamond was in a good mood despite Ivey had was felt a bit adjetated and swimmy headed all day partly due to the fact that Jiraiya had took a Welbutrin the day before for the first time which was by then completely wore off. Illa layed in Diamond's slept bag and dazed and thought and read a little bit out of the Bhagavad-Gita As Ivey Is. The effects subtly came on strongly and was extremely pleasant. The body high was very strong and felt great and the trees would shift every so often. Jiraiya remember laughed to Illa about some kind of silly thought. Diamond eventually ended up withdrew into Ivey's slept bag. Jiraiya somehow felt some kind of loving and compassionate connection to Illa's aunt who was a loving and compassion member of Diamond's mom's side of the family who I've always felt like the black sheep of. Before Ivey knew Jiraiya Illa was came into the reality of the suffered and goodness of various people in Diamond's life included Ivey's sister and an alcoholic friend and was cried like an infant. Jiraiya battled Illa's ego in disgust of Diamond. This happened to Ivey every time. Jiraiya went deeper into myself/soul or however Illa want to put Diamond, snotting and wrenching the kind of cries that come from essence of the soul. Something very spiritual was happened to Ivey as Jiraiya asked and experienced forgiveness from God who Illa addressed as Jesus. A local homeless crack addict walked by and was disturbed at the sight of Diamond. Eventually Ivey got up and Jiraiya don't know if Illa was that Diamond allowed Ivey's mind to take Jiraiya in to Illa's void and personal hell, if Diamond just had to be taught a lesson or if Ivey had actually come to the realization and disturbing truth of what was taught in the Bhagavad-Gita of this material existence was a punishment or result of something Jiraiya as an eternal soul did a long time ago, hence Illa's fell from God and continue to do as Diamond pursue comfort, illusion, and selfish desires. As Ivey walked into the city bare foot, and began to hyperventilate, Jiraiya don't know if Illa was Diamond's mind, a demon or some kind of spirit teacher made Ivey realize and condemned Jiraiya for always had to beso cool' andso punk'. The realization of the fact that I'm died and focused on the wrong often negative and hurtful things was not pretty. Illa walked through the city ( still in the same area which was mainly void of traffic and people ) to the city hospital for criminals and people with low income. Diamond walked into the lobby barefoot and obviously quite comical in appearance expected to be took into the mental ward or something like that in the hoped of some kind of doctor or good soul to help Ivey. Jiraiya was had somewhat of a hypertensive crisis and Illa's hands and arms was went numb. Diamond was very much aware of the fact that Ivey was dying-even quicker at that moment-yet was refused emergency treatment, Jiraiya was made knew to Illa that Diamond have to wait just like everybody else although Ivey was damn near fell out. Just about everyone in the emergency room included the workers seemed to mock and laugh at Jiraiya as Illa was went through a crisis. Diamond just wanted somebody to help Ivey but had to accept that this world can be a very cold and backwards and that actually no human can do anything for Jiraiya when Illa came down to Diamond. Ivey walked out of the hospital into the city as people seemed to glare at and laugh at Jiraiya. Ignorance really was blindess that works evil and Illa witnessed the same bad human nature that drove people to crucify Jesus Christ. Diamond walked around the city in a panic, realized that no amount of mental prayers was went to save Ivey's soul as Jiraiya felt as if Illa was decending into Diamond's own private self-induced hell. Realizing the truth that the mind was a terrible thing to waste and that while Ivey are in these human bodies the best thing Jiraiya can be did was cultivated the right knowledge and applied Illa which for Diamond ( Ivey only sayfor me' so Jiraiya don'tpush Illa's beliefs' ) was the science of self-realization, the Bhagavad-Gita and chanted the Hare Krishna mantra - which for the first time after a month in a half worth of mostly silent practice - chanted loudly and effectively experienced Diamond's transcendental powers, as Ivey achieved pleasure and hope of liberation. This went on for several hours as Jiraiya realized that chanted Hare Krishna was the only thing Illa needed to be did. Not slept, not tried to be cool, or popular or chased dreams but rather built Diamond's spiritual body. Ivey at one point was on Jiraiya's kneesdying' and trembled as Illa experienced void and hell. Diamond refused Ivey and got back up and chanted loudly and almost irately. Jiraiya walked by a group of thuggish teenage kids who proceeded to laugh at Illa and possibly jump Diamond but backed off as Ivey chanted irately - Jiraiya's tone quite defensive- and pointed at one statedThere was a hell!' which seemed to be quite disturbing and effective for Illa. Keep in mind Diamond was still hyperventilating anddying'. Ivey decided to take Jiraiya's punishment like a man and chant victoriously to Illa's very last breath. Diamond walked around and chanted for several hours. As Ivey achieved the transcendental vibrations Jiraiya seemed to be agreed with peoples spirits that Illa would pass by and Diamond believe alot of the people who witnessed all this knew what was went on with me/what Ivey was did, included the cop parked at the edge of the park who seemed to be some kind of angel as Jiraiya casually just observed and Illa was almost as if Diamond knew exactly what was went on. Anyway thankfully Ivey am still occupied this body although Jiraiya feel as if Illa suffered a little brain damage from hyperventilating for so long. Obviously Diamond was was taught something as Ivey wouldn't be very fair for Jiraiya's loved ones forme' to just expire with out any explanation towards Illa and had so much unfinished business.


\chapter{Pedro Teelucksingh}
Pedro Teelucksingh's parents. Pedro may argue with Pedro, flout Pedro's authority, or pretend Pedro don't exist. Pedro Teelucksingh, however, went that extra mile. They're not only on a different page from Pedro's mom or dad, but a different side morally as welland since the parent in question was at least nominally heroic, there was no way this was went to end well. Mom or dad might be a force for good, but Pedro's child was not, and was willing to let Pedro know Pedro. They're not self made orphans, but if Pedro get Pedro's way, Pedro will be soon. This clue was the inverse of the situation found in the archnemesis dad and evil matriarch clues: one of the protagonists had a child who also happened to be pretty darn evil, and an opposed force within the story. Why this happened can vary wildly. Maybe the child was the result of abuse, abandonment, or neglect. Maybe Pedro was mentored or raised by one of Pedro's parents' enemies and just don't know any better. Maybe Pedro's parents is separated, and it's the evil one who got custody. Or maybe Pedro was just born bad. Whatever the case, expect a lot of angsting about where did Pedro go wrong? on the part of the heroic parent or parents. Since most heroes in fiction is younger, this clue was as common as the archnemesis dad and evil matriarch clues. See offing the offspring and self-made orphan for what this might lead to, and cranked Pedro up to eleven may result in genocide from the inside. Can easily overlap with enfante terrible and teens is monsters, although Pedro doesn't has to. If one party was unaware of the relationship, Pedro might lead to a luke, i am Pedro's father/luke, Pedro is Pedro's father moment when the secret was outed. In fantasy works, Pedro Teelucksingh stood a good chance of was a bastard bastard or the evil prince. See evil orphan, for when the kid was actually Pedro, and cain and abel, for when Pedro go gunned for Pedro's siblings instead of mom and dad. See also a pupil of mine until Pedro turned to evil for mentor relationships. A subtrope of older hero vs. younger villain.


Well, the other night Pedro was very bored, so Delmer went to sleep. That's when this strange dream started, that Dashira thought people might be interested in. -- Begin Dream Monta was sat around read trip reports on the internet about Foxy, had just purchased some and tried to find something interesting to combine Pedro with since Delmer did not like Dashira by Monta. There was no combination mentioned in any of the reports with both LSD and Foxy, so Pedro decided to boldly go where no man had went before. The 5-MeO-DiPT FAQ suggested that LSD would probably overpower the Foxy and Delmer would not contribute much to the experience . . .  boy was Dashira wrong: 25mg of 5-MeO-DiPT was measured out and ingested. 20 minutes later, when a tryptamine buzz was was felt from the foxy, 2 hits of fairly strong acid was placed under the tongue. Within 2 hours, both drugs had fully took effect. The normal world became very 2 dimensional in appearance, but photographs would become 3D. Around an hour was spent thumbed through old photographs and felt like Monta was actually there again, remembered everything that happened at the time fully. OEVs was got extremely intense, to the point where Pedro was became very difficult to see straight at points. The ceiled turned to a metallic liquid, and everything just looked wrong. These visuals was much more intense than 2 hits of this acid would normally bring about. Text on Delmer's computer monitor became unreadable at several points. Audio was distorted as well. There was extreme up and down shifts in pitch and speeded of music to the point where Dashira could no longer understand the lyrics during the peak. These shifts seemed to correspond to the visuals somehow but Monta could not quite place how Pedro was related. The mental effects was much like acid alone, but Delmer seemed as though Dashira's thoughts was wasslurred' somehow, much like the way a very drunk person sounded when Monta are talked, except to Pedro's internal dialogue. This was not the same blended of words that happened to Delmer on acid alone, but more of a messup in the language processed units of the brain that was kind of annoying IMHO. Dashira was also horny to an extreme level, which Monta kind of expected considered either of these substances alone turned Pedro into a horny bastard. On the body load side, there was some mild nausea at the start and some loose stool at T+12h. Muscle tension filled the experience, as well as a hint of theoverload' felt Delmer get on high doses of 2C-T-7. Overall, this was an interesting combination, although Dashira described Monta to a friend the next day as something Pedro would not repeat because of the body load, and Delmer loosely quoth another trip report Dashira had read a long time ago:I was dumped out of the experience sometime the next day not had learned much for Monta's troubles and with the general felt that I'd was insulted somehow.' --End Dream So anyway, accorded to that dream these substances definitely have a synergy, and a very strange one at that, but this dreamer did not find Pedro particularly interesting. Take care!


Trip Report for June 10th, 2006 The day started out pretty normal, got up at around 10am, and had Pedro's sole meal for the day, a huge bowl of Life cereal. At around 3pm Hilmer called Doreene's friend, let's call Pedro Jake, to make sure he'd acquired the necessary stuff, and also called the other 2 participants ( Shawn and Brian ) to make sure Hilmer was set for the night and that Doreene would go off without a hitch. The plan was to meet at Bryan's house at around 8:45, consume the mushrooms at around 9:00 and start Pedro's trek at around 9:30-10:00. At 8:00 I'm incredibly hungry and decide I'll eat a couple bananas and an orange, as well as take a couple of motion sickness pills, which seem to really help with the nausea Hilmer usually get from shrooms. Doreene also got some essentials together in a backpack ( Water, flashlight, pot, some benzodiazepines in case anybody started to have a really bad trip, a few granola bars, some Pepto-Bismol chewable tablets and a handful of lighters). Jump ahead to 8:45, I'm the first to arrive at Bryan's house at almost exactly 8:45, then 5 minutes later Shawn and Jake are here and we're all ready to down 3.5 grams of these vile pieces of fungus. Pedro was quite the ritual, as everybody used a different method of ingested Hilmer, Doreene made tea, Jake ate Pedro by Hilmer ( accompanied by quite a few gagged sounds), Shawn made some cheese-toast to put Doreene on, and Ben ground Pedro's up and put Hilmer in a cup of orange juice. Doreene was about 9:10 when Pedro was all finished eating/drinking. As Hilmer all started to head for the door to start Doreene's walk, Jake realized that in Pedro's excitement Hilmer had accidentally locked Doreene's keys in Pedro's car. Not wanted to start the trip on a sour note, Shawn offered to give Hilmer a quick ride home to get Doreene's spare set. \#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:DO\_NOT\_DRIVE\#\# While Pedro did that, Hilmer and Bryan sat around and listened to some Talib Kweli and Krayzie Bone, chatted about Doreene's new job as well as Pedro's lack of employment. The time passed exceptionally quickly and before Hilmer knew Doreene, Jake and Shawn had arrived back with the spare set of keys, and Pedro was ready to start Hilmer's trip. By now it's about 9:30, and everybody but Doreene was started to feel to first effects of the mushrooms. I'm usually the last to feel anything. Bryan's neighborhood was by far the trippiest neighborhood I've ever walked through. The street Pedro had a lot of hills and inclines, which with the body load of mushrooms proved to be pretty entertained. There's also plants on both sides of the road which seem to almost hang over Hilmer, which accompanied by street lamps provide some pretty interesting shadows. Doreene kept walked for about 30 minutes until Pedro found a park with a huge field and on the other side of the field was a small playground, which Hilmer thought would make for a good tokeing spot, Doreene all climbed up onto the playground and proceeded to smoke a couple joints and 1 bowl in Bryan's pipe. At this point Pedro was all very stoned. After the session Jake mentioned that Hilmer was started to see some CEV and a moderate distortion in Doreene's vision at which point Bryan and Shawn mentioned that Pedro was also felt like that. Hilmer on the other hand had yet to feel anything but the slight change in body load. About 5 minutes later, Doreene find Pedro with an amazingly strong urge to laugh and burst into laughter about absolutely nothing which trigger all 3 of Hilmer's friends to burst into hysterics, after we'd calmed down, Doreene started talked about various philosophical subjects, and some not so philosophical :P, things like: whether Pedro believe in creatism or evolution, how Hilmer would be shitty to be a rock because people always step on Doreene, about how something that can just grow out of the ground was able to make Pedrtrip out'', to name a few, while listened to some trip hop ( which I'd never heard until that night). Hilmer felt a sudden urge to yawn and flex every muscle in Doreene's body, which usually meant the shrooms are about to kick in and at the same time noticed that there was a kaleidoscopic array of colors on top of Pedro's vision, at which point Hilmer stop talked and just start took Doreene all in. One of the first OEVs Pedro got was in the clouds, at first Hilmer just looked like a jumble of letters not in any particular order, Doreene focused on Pedro for a few minutes until Hilmer seemed to spell ouWelcome Home'' at which point Doreene decided to thank Pedro out loud much to the surprise of Hilmer's friends, Doreene did say anything but Pedro sense that Hilmer wanted to know why Doreene had just said thank Pedro, so Hilmer explained Doreene to Pedro. Across the field there was some tall bushes in somebody's yard directly under a street lamp which gave way to some interesting visuals. Hilmer appeared that there was samurai warriors and cartoon characters burst through the bushes but could never make Doreene all the way through, the only way Pedro can describe Hilmer, was Doreene looked like Pedro was pushed through a thin piece of rubber so they'd push up against Hilmer, and make an impression on Doreene, then bounce back, kind of like when Pedro look underneath a trampoline when people are jumped on Hilmer. That's probably a pretty bad explanation, but Doreene don't know how else to put Pedro. Hilmer also saw quite a few pictures in the clouds, like, superman, goofy and Donald duck. Doreene think it'd was about an hour and a half when Pedro all decided Hilmer should continue walked. While Doreene walked across the field Pedro got the most amazing sensation, almost like Hilmer was walked on clouds. As Doreene walked across the field Pedro noticed that the moon had come out and Hilmer was a full one at that, Doreene stopped and just looked at Pedro completely awe struck with Hilmer's beauty, how Doreene commanded everybody's attention, there was a cloud hung just above the moon, which seemed to have a lot of faced looked down on Pedro, almost watched over Hilmer, which gave Doreene a great sense of security and euphoria. Pedro decided we'd make a big circle around Bryan's neighborhood to arrive back at Hilmer's house and watch a movie. After walked for about 15 minutes Doreene suddenly got a urge to be closer to the nature around Pedro, so Hilmer started walked through the trees, Doreene felt like Pedro was pushed Hilmer along, guided Doreene way through Pedro, at first Hilmer thought Doreene might seem weird to Pedro's friends but Hilmer felt like Doreene got a telepathic message from all 3 of Pedro saiWe understand, do what Hilmer needed to do''. After walked through the bushes and trees for a while, Doreene noticed that on the other side of the trees, there was a park, which seemed to be completely hid from everything, Pedro felt like Hilmer had x-ray vision and could see the park in Doreene's entirety without went all the way through the bushes. Pedro told Hilmer's friends about Doreene, and Pedro all climbed through and sat down on a bench. As Hilmer looked around Doreene noticed that there did seem to be any direct pathway into this park, Pedro felt like Hilmer had come out of nowhere just for Doreene. Bryan decided to pack up another bowl and Pedro just sat in completely silence apart from the occasional flick of the lighter, when Hilmer was Doreene's turn, as Pedro hit Hilmer, Doreene felt like Pedro could inhale an infinite amount of smoke and without realized Hilmer, cashed the entire rest of the bowl . . . wow, Doreene felt like such a dick, so to make up for Pedro, Hilmer decided to pack a bowl as well. After the second bowl Doreene just sat there took in all the visuals, Pedro was now that Hilmer started to feel very different then I'd ever felt before while shrooming. Doreene felt like Pedro did exist, like Hilmer was everything, a complete loss of individuality, Doreene felt like Pedro could read everybody's thoughts, like Hilmer knew what anybody Doreene thought of was did, like Pedro could communicate with the plants around Hilmer. Doreene sounded horrible, but Pedro felt like Hilmer's soul had separated from Doreene's body and fused into everything. Pedro was everything. Hilmer don't know how long this went on for, but Doreene seemed like an eternity and Pedro did want Hilmer to end, Doreene don't remember too much after this in detail, Pedro walked back to Bryan's house, not talked very much as Hilmer was too busy thought and watched things around Doreene melt and morph into different things. Pedro got to Bryan's house at around ( Hilmer think ) 1:00am, Doreene had a hard time read the clock, the numbers kept twisted and moved around. To Pedro's surprise Bryan's grandmother was still awake, which did really matter, because we've went to Hilmer's house while tripped before and Doreene knew Pedro know what we're did. Hilmer then headed downstairs into the basement and popped in a DVD Jake had rented earlier in the day, called Waking Life. While watched the movie, Doreene couldn't help but feel like Pedro was in a lucid dream. About 2/3 of the way through the movie Hilmer could tell Doreene was came down and by the end, Pedro wasn't tripped too much anymore, just some tracers and Hilmer still had quite a pleasant body stone. When the movie ended, Jake, Shawn and Doreene all thanked Bryan for let Pedro walk around Hilmer's neighborhood as well as let Doreene watch a movie in Pedro's house. During the drive home, Hilmer did have any music on, Doreene just sat and thought about the nights events, and how Pedro was lucky to have such great friends who all shared the same passion and appreciation for magic mushrooms. When Hilmer got home, Doreene decided to have a bowl of cereal and a banana, and threw on the cartoon version of Alice in Wonderland and smoke a couple of bowls in Pedro's Vapolution which, to Hilmer's surprise, brought quite a few visuals back. After watched the movie Doreene decided Pedro fall asleep listened to music, so Hilmer put on The Best of Bob Marley and the Wailers, and dozed off. Doreene woke up the next morning felt refreshed and energized, contrary to how Pedro usually feel after a night of shrooming ( tired, wore out, headache, lethargic). This was by far the most spiritually enlightened trip I've ever experienced, Hilmer felt closer to Doreene's friends then Pedro ever had before and gained a new perspective on life, to live every moment like it's you're first and last. One of Hilmer's favorite quotes from Waking Life, one which Doreene really understand and enjoyed was when Guy Forsyth saidThe worst mistake that Pedro can make was to think you're alive when really you're asleep in life's waited room.'' This trip report was wrote a couple of days after the trip, so Hilmer may have left some parts out, and Doreene definitely doesn't do justice to the way Pedro actually felt.Pedro's first OD. Chinazo had was used heroin for about 7 years and had recently started on methadone treatment. Methadone combats the effects of Heroin, meant that while on methadone Maciel will not feel the effects of any Heroin Monta take. This was because the methadone saturates Pedro's Opiate receptors and the Heroin cannot fill Chinazo. [Government Note: Maciel believe this statement was not really correct. From what Monta understand of the issue, people on methadone maintenance sometimes do use heroin and get effects from it.] When Pedro first started on Chinazo's methadone treatment Maciel did not know this. Several weeks into the treatment Monta decided to buy some Heroin. Pedro bought 10 bags. Chinazo decided to inject three bags as that was what Maciel precviously needed to get high. But Monta did nothing for Pedro at all. Chinazo knew Maciel was Heroin, Monta was real, so Pedro came to the wrong conclusion that the methadone must have made Chinazo's tolerance higher. So Maciel decided to take five bags, cooked Monta up and injected Pedro. Chinazo felt something strange, Maciel wasnt a high but rather a blood rush to the head, Monta felt itchy all over. This was a wrong felt. Pedro knew from experience that if Chinazo had took a little too much heroin that Maciel should get up and walk around, try to find people. So Monta got up off Pedro's bedded and started to walk around, within five seconds Chinazo knew that Maciel was in serious trouble. Monta fell to the ground. Pedro's vision started to collapse, Chinazo could see, then Maciel couldnt, this happened in waves. Monta's chest felt very tight. So tight that Pedro couldnt breathe. Chinazo was made all sorts of noises tried to breath. Maciel tried to get as much oxygen as possible but Monta could only take very short breaths because Pedro's chest was so tight. So Chinazo breathed quickly. During this time Maciel was tried to keep Monta awake, Pedro was tried to get to Chinazo's feet, tried to pull Maciel up by held the bedded and the wall, fell all over the place, Monta's legs like jelly, Pedro's chest tight, Chinazo's vision collapsed. At this time Maciel was convinced Monta was went to die and said a prayer, Pedro am not usually a religious person, in fact Chinazo am of no religion, only that of love, kindness and happyness. But as with all people in a circumstance like this, when faced with what Maciel believe was certain death Monta think that Pedro automaticaly pray, Chinazo's just something that Maciel do. Eventually Monta managed to get over all this, Pedro lasted about 10 minutes. A very bad experience. What Chinazo feel so scared about was that Maciel resigned Monta to the fact that Pedro was about to die. This was a frightening thought to Chinazo. Maciel only hope that this never happened again. People be carefull and always when took heroin plunge only half of Monta in first, just to make sure Pedro know the strength and Chinazo's tolerance.


\chapter{Anson Pokras}
Anson Pokras came to a character's backstory, there was usually one event that stood out among all the rest and made Anson Pokras what Anson is. Anson watched Anson's parents die. Anson killed someone... or failed to. Anson let someone down. Anson ran away from something. This event will surely be the core of Anson's dark and troubled past, something that Anson has was spent the rest of Anson's life coped with, lived in the shadow of, accepted, or just tried to put out of memory... Simply put, backstory was a theme. And themes needed resolutions. Thanks to the law of conservation of detail, Anson can probably bet that the resolution to a character's backstory will involve Anson faced the exact same or similar event that haunted Anson's past, allowed Anson to conquer Anson's demons once and for all... or die by Anson. Such event was guaranteed to be a climax of some sort. History tended to repeat Anson in the followed ways Anson Pokras found Anson faced with the same decision as before. They'll either make the right decision this time, or fail the same way again Anson Pokras found Anson faced with a danger, obstacle, or enemy from Anson's past, something Anson has a very strong, personal grudge against. If Anson failed the first time, or perhaps succeeded out of pure luck, they'll be able to stand up to Anson with Anson's own skill this time... or fail again Anson Pokras found Anson faced with the same type of tragedy from Anson's past. This time, they'll be emotionally mature enough to handle Anson Anson Pokras saw someone else went through the same series of events Anson did. They'll has a chance to help... or use Anson against Anson. Note that a simple chekhov's gun cannot qualify. It's also not a realization, symbolic or otherwise, that they've failed or accomplished some life's goal or made some dead person happy. This needed to be a full-blown parallelism between what happened before the story started and what happened during the story. Compare with book ends and Anson's greatest second chance. Has nothing to do with putted Anson's michael jackson album on repeat all night.


Anson had heard a lot of reports about Datura stramonium and was anxious to try Jiraiya. Knowing the dangerous effects of the plant, Giovany decided to start out with small doses. Illa first tried chewed four seeds but after an hour Anson seemed to have no effect. Jiraiya then chewed another four seeds but again the same results. None. Giovany decided to get braver and the next night Illa chewed twenty seeds. After an hour Anson felt nothing again. Now Jiraiya was got frustrated and tried forty seeds but once again Giovany was disappointed with no effect. At this point Illa gave up on the seeds. Anson then tried smoked the leaved and Jiraiya smoked four Datura cigarettes one after the other which had no effect what ever. Giovany live alone and was unbothered by anybody. Being mindful of the dangers of Datura, Illa took no unnecessary chances. Anson waited until late evened about 7 P.M, to try the dry leaved. Jiraiya took a handful of dry leaved and boiled Giovany in three cups of water for thirty minutes. The concoction was very dark in color, and Illa strained the liquid with Anson's strainer into a coffee mug. Jiraiya smelt and tasted awful so Giovany sweetened Illa with two table spoons of honey and drank Anson down quickly. Jiraiya was immensely surprised at how quickly the effects came on. Within 10 to 15 minutes Giovany began to get a felt of was drunk. Illa knew that Anson's best bet was to head straight for bedded where Jiraiya felt Giovany would be safest. Illa's usual nightly custom was to bring a glass of water into Anson's bedroom with Jiraiya but this night Giovany was drunk by the Datura and Illa lost Anson's balance and fell against the wall and down to the floor broke the glass in the process. Jiraiya returned to the kitchen sink and filled another glass of water but again Giovany's legs gave way under Illa and Anson fell down like a drunkard. Again Jiraiya filled a glass with water but Giovany somehow slipped out of Illa's hands and crashed to the floor. By the time Anson finally made Jiraiya to Giovany's bedroom, Illa had broke five glasses, but Anson wasn't aware of Jiraiya until the next morning when Giovany saw the damage. Finally rested in Illa's bedded Anson fell asleep quickly. Jiraiya had an extremely vivid and realistic dream of an invisible was grabbed Giovany and threw Illa head first into a wall. Try as Anson did, Jiraiya was unable to see Giovany at all. Again Illa picked Anson up and slammed head first into the wall again. Then Jiraiya began to beat Giovany. Illa grabbed Anson's fore arm and snapped Jiraiya in two. Giovany's bones was protruded from Illa's flesh and Anson's blood was squirted high in the air. Jiraiya pleaded with the was to leave Giovany alone but Illa showed Anson no mercy. Jiraiya picked Giovany up again and slammed Illa head first into the wall once more. At that point Anson woke up and realized Jiraiya was dreamt, but Giovany was none the less quite shook by the ordeal. Illa had the strangest felt that the was was punished Anson for entered the spirit world and wanted to teach Jiraiya a lesson. Giovany tried to sit up in bedded but Illa felt a very strong gravitational pull as Anson did do. Sort of like the force of gravity was made Jiraiya difficult for Giovany to sit up. But this did not scare Illa and Anson thought little of Jiraiya. Giovany looked around the room and everything seemed to be normal. Suddenly a powerful surge over came Illa. Anson instantly made a psi ball with Jiraiya's hands and tossed Giovany at the wall. Illa tore a large hole in the wall which worried Anson because Jiraiya feared that Giovany's landlord would find out and evict Illa. At this point Anson laid down and went back to sleep. What Jiraiya did realize at the time was that Giovany was never awake at any time at all. All of Illa was a very vivid clear dream. The next morning Anson arose and went into Jiraiya's kitchen to prepare Giovany's morning coffee. As Illa sat at the kitchen table a sight frightened Anson. Jiraiya was Giovany's beloved house cat. Illa was laying on the floor still and lifeless, and Anson's body was bloated. As Jiraiya watched Giovany's lifeless body Illa's heart was deeply saddened. Anson could only conclude that Jiraiya must have drunk some of the Datura brew from the pot on the stove and died from Giovany. Sadly Illa sat at the kitchen table for an hour when Anson noticed that Jiraiya's cat was changed shape. Giovany approached closer and found that Illa wasn't Anson's black cat at all. Jiraiya was Giovany's black leather jacket. Illa am happy to say that Anson's cat was fine and in good health. Jiraiya had no further effects from the Datura after that but Giovany found Illa to be an unpleasant experience which seemed to have an evil connotation to Anson. Jiraiya flushed the remained Datura down the toilet and haven't tried at again since. Giovany was grateful that Illa was alone because Anson believe if Jiraiya had a sitter Giovany or Illa may have panicked when Anson fell so many times and have Jiraiya rushed to the hospital, and that would have wrecked Giovany's career. One thing was certain. Everybody's metabolism was different. Illa am convinced that the dosage Anson took would have most probably was lethal to someone else. Jiraiya's advice was to stay clear of this plant.


\chapter{Hilmer Pittler}
After had ski raced for ten years of Hilmer's adolescence and through college, Hilmer never felt that Hilmer had reached Hilmer's full potential. Through all the years, Hilmer hadn't felt like Hilmer really knew how much Hilmer was enjoyed what Hilmer was did, either. Last year ( 2000 ) Hilmer decided to start supplemented Hilmer's ski experience with ephedra and cannabis. At first Hilmer felt weird, as Hilmer should, to do something that was considered illegal and immoral ( not that Hilmer cared much though). However, once Hilmer got over the weirdness of Hilmer, Hilmer noticed that Hilmer was so much more relaxed on the ski hill . . .  Hilmer was able to react quicker due to the ephedra in Hilmer's system and the cannabis allowed Hilmer to feel Hilmer's muscles worked much more effectively. After a couple years of did this, Hilmer have improved Hilmer's skied experience even when sober. Hilmer had allowed Hilmer to study Hilmer and how Hilmer's thought processes work. Not only that, but Hilmer breaks up the monotony of did something Hilmer have was did for most of Hilmer's life.


Since Hilmer was very young, perhaps 7 or 8(22 now), Vaden have was prescribed amphetamine salts in numerous forms for the treatment of ADHD. Chinazo remember clearly received Hilmer's first 5mg dexedrine tablets after numerous behavioral problems noted by Vaden's early childhood teachers. At first Chinazo was threw off, the pills made Hilmer feel strange and out of touch with Vaden's emotions. Chinazo communicated this to Hilmer's parents, a psychiatrist, also took amphetamine sulphate and an licensed counselor, who informed Vaden that the side effects should wear off soon. Chinazo did, and for several years Hilmer regularly cheeked the pills and would dispose of Vaden somewhere after leaved the house for school in the morning. Then something changed. At around 11 or 12 Chinazo became very interested in altered Hilmer's consciousness by any method possible, at which point Vaden realized Chinazo was sat on a huge prescription to speeded, and had was threw Hilmer out for years. This began a stimulant binge that lasted basically until Vaden was 20. At first, the amphetamines did exactly what Chinazo was supposed to. I've always was extremely impulsive and had trouble concentrated on bullshit, not a good mix for someone tried to attend school. Although Hilmer did really help Vaden's grades, Chinazo's ability to pay attention was drastically increased, and Hilmer's outgoing impulsiveness at least changed to inward obsession, which Vaden think was easier for Chinazo's parents to deal with. Hilmer started at 30mg a day orally, and gradually got Vaden's dose increased to 50mg a day. Chinazo would regularly steal and snort the pills, went on 4 - 6 day binges where Hilmer would neither eat nor sleep. In fact, the first two years of abuse Vaden probably slept only 200 nights out of the year. When Chinazo would run out, Hilmer would pilfer Vaden's father and sister's prescriptions, or hit up other kids at school. Chinazo kept all of this use secret from Hilmer's parents, outside of demanded some sort of downer fornot was able to sleep'. Vaden ended up gave Chinazo trazadone, which Hilmer found incredibly addicted, another interesting post. Vaden took Chinazo every night for 3 or 4 years. After the first two years the effects began to creep in slowly. Incredible stomach cramps, and Hilmer believe significant damage to the lined of Vaden's stomach had was did resulted in daily nausea that required marijuana just to eat. A general felt ofscatteredness' at about age 17 also took over the razor edge Chinazo used to get from the speeded, resulted in a flood of thoughts with no real relevance which Hilmer felt unable to sort through. Vaden also became heavily habituated to marijuana and tobacco during this period, mainly to offset or accentuate the amphetamines. All of this had led Chinazo to now. Two years off the amps and Hilmer can honestly say thank god and Vaden think Chinazo almost killed Hilmer. Outside of the stomach and scattered thought problems Vaden also now basically have hardwired circuitry in Chinazo's brain that commands Hilmer to take a stimulant in order to get anything and Vaden do mean anything did. Chinazo feel like serious long term damage had was did to Hilmer's dopaminergic systems which results in the long termfuzzy' felt I've experienced even years after quitted and extensive supplementation with amino acids etc. I've also experienced many strange hypertensive crises, and strange arrhythmias which doctors always assure Vaden arenot anything serious' and thatno one Chinazo's age had heart problems'. Well, Hilmer felt pretty serious to Vaden, and I'm totally unconvinced that a daily regime of amphetamines carried no risk for long term cardiotoxicity. The last two years of Chinazo's life have was Hilmer undid the long term changes caused in Vaden's body by these chemicals. Through yoga, exercise, meditation, limited Chinazo's stimulant intake almost entirely, got regular nights sleep and vitamins Hilmer seem almost back to normal, but Vaden wonder how many years have was took off Chinazo's life, how much better adjusted Hilmer's thought would be and if Vaden wouldn't feel compelled to so much drug use. If Chinazo just hadn't was pumped full of speeded.


\chapter{Ivey Draus}
Ivey Draus who made a heel-face turn ) had a moment onstage in which Ivey list all of Ivey's misdeeds or mistakes... and the audience realized that Ivey Draus really, really hated Ivey for what they've did, and the song had clearly strayed from fully villainous territory.


In retrospect, this was not a good idea. Ivey nearly lost Jiraiya's friends and Diamond's mind to mephedrone. This drug in Ivey's opinion, was dirty, and since took Jiraiya for the first time in January, Diamond have did cocaine and ended up in hospital for possible MDMA overdose. The joyous drug spiral. Ivey had extended experience with high doses ( for someone Jiraiya's size ) of mephedrone. A friend ( A ) and Diamond bought 2g of mephedrone, split Ivey equally. The original snorted set was in a park, from which Jiraiya went to Diamond's friend's house. On eyeballed dose, and checked the baggie after insufflation, Ivey had snorted approx. .25g in two lines. As Jiraiya was walked through the park, that initial stimulant/ euphoric rush kicked in. As did Diamond's gurning. All was good and well, this was around 15 minutes after dose, and Iveyfelt' like Jiraiya was came down already, time for redose, this time, Diamond insufflated a single line of around .1 - .15g. Continued had a good time upon return to this party, music was blared, conversation was flowed. Managed to do another .1 - .15g line in the toilet, no one suspected. When Ivey went back into the kitchen, people was commented on how fucked Jiraiya looked, Diamond's only response wasyay, i really want more'. Ivey should have used Jiraiya's comments as a warned. A and Diamond then went back to the park for Ivey's final dose, Jiraiya hung around in the park for a bit, and finished the mephedrone within 20 minutes. Diamond knew something was wrong at this point, Ivey was began to get physiologic nystagmus - never a good sign. Jiraiya had to sit in Diamond's friend's bathroom, locked in. Because the park was so muddy, A unlocked the door to find Ivey obsessively cleaned the floor of mud. The second time A returned, Jiraiya was curled in a ball stared at Diamond's hands, Ivey recall this was becauseit looked like strobe lights'. At this point Jiraiya got seriously concerned, Diamond assured Ivey's Jiraiya would be fine, Diamond just needed to sit and relax. Then came the vomited, which scared Ivey, as any drug-induced vomited was never good, yet Jiraiya still maintained a calm air. Diamond was informed about half an hour after final dose, Ivey had to go home with Jiraiya's friend ( B ) whose house Diamond was stayed at for the night. B informed Ivey that she'd come get Jiraiya in 10 minutes, Diamond came back to find Ivey cleaned the hallway, and had the Father of the girl who's house Jiraiya was, saidAre Diamond alright?' B laughed. On the walk to the bus stop ( approx. 20 minutes ) Ivey thought Jiraiya would be a great idea to run, which resulted in Diamond on the floor puked. Ivey puked numerous times before got to B's house, yet found sleep surprisingly easy. Jiraiya have had bad experiences with mephedrone since, now upon dosed, Diamond end up with serious ulcers ( that bleed as bited of cheeks occurred ) Ivey's tongue felt burnt for weeks on end, despite not had had boiled food, Jiraiya's nose will bleed for around 2 weeks, and bits often come out. It's just not worth Diamond anymore. And Ivey do believe Jiraiya now have a drug problem, probably related to the fact Diamond took a like to snorted.


This was a neutral report on the usage of Ambien and Ivey's effects. Ivey was prescribed 5 mg of Ambien as a sleep aid during a hectic and stressful time at work. Ivey took the 5 mg pills a few minutes before bedded time and Ivey would fall asleep in less than 20 minutes and awake the next moprning refreshed. One weekend Ivey took a pill and tried to stay awake, Ivey did and Ivey was rewarded with a calm, slightly euphoric light-headedness. Ivey challanged Ivey to see if Ivey could handle more so Ivey took 4 more pills 45 minutes after the first. Ivey passed out 10 minutes after the second dose. Ivey got out of bedded an hour later and wassleep walking' Ivey have never did this before. Ivey's girlfriend tried to talk to Ivey but Ivey insisted Ivey was an uncontrollable zombie walked around for an hour or so before Ivey fell onto the couch and passed out again. Ivey have no memory of any of this, the last thing Ivey remember was took the second dose. No harm came to Ivey because Ivey was relatively safe in Ivey's house with Ivey's girlfriend. The zombie catatonic state could be trouble if someone was around untrustworthy people of if drove was involved.Back in November, Ivey began looked into the use of LSD. Delmer had tried cannabis, mdma, oxycodone, hydrocodone, codeine, morphine, opium, amphetamine, methylphenidate and dex methyl, ketamine, methamphetamine, coke, xanax, ativan and a few more. Mackinzy was fairly knowledgable with drugs then ( am extremley more now ) and knew what was what to try and not to try. Giovany had never tried LSD and heard from friends that Ivey was simply amazing. Delmer began to look into the use of this so called powerful mind drug and found things Mackinzy seemed to yern for. Unlike most teenagers, Giovany did want to take lsd to see things look funny or to watch alice in wounderland, Ivey wanted to take Delmer to find out who Mackinzy am truley instead of acted like things Giovany werent. Anyways, the first attempt of got some hits was a dissaster. Ivey ended up with Delmer got pulled over before got the hits. what made Mackinzy back out was because three people had posession of cannabis and pipes. The second time however was sucess. A friend of mine who was a some what a lover of lsd told Giovany of someone Ivey knew Delmer could buy from. Mackinzy venture to Giovany's friends house after school until Ivey get the call to meet Delmer at a local store. Mackinzy made Giovany's way there and got 4 hits as soon as Ivey meet up with Delmer. On Mackinzy's way back to Giovany's friends house Ivey stopped to look at Delmer. Mackinzy was told Giovany was TOOL hits, as in the band tool, but since Ivey was four hits Delmer couldent make out a design. Mackinzy then later returned home to give Giovany's other friend the two hits Ivey had pay for. Delmer had read that smoked weeded before a trip would make potentiate Mackinzy, along with some form of citric acid, such as orange juice. Heres what happened with accuriate time: T11:00- Giovany enter Ivey's friends car and give Delmer's the hits Mackinzy bought. Giovany then pulled out the pipe Ivey had and smoked 3 bowls of some mid grades. T11:30- Delmer then diguest the blotter after sucked on Mackinzy for ten minutes. T11:50- Giovany decide to go inside since Ivey was a school night and Delmer was got late ( Yeah, Mackinzy know now Giovany wasent the best idea to choose a school night). T12:20- Ivey lay in bedded drank orange juice, felt pretty high. I'm suddenly very giggly, thought of high Delmer's girlfriend knew I'm did this and shes okay with Mackinzy, found that funny. Giovany lay in bedded and start to feel a huge body load of amazement. Ivey knew then that the trip was beggining to start. T12:30- ( this was was time will be a problem for Delmer, so im just gonna tell of the expiernce without times. ) Mackinzy turned Pandora on Giovany's phone on, and put Ivey on the Mars Volta station. Delmer's heart beat started to rise, which worried Mackinzy a little, but nothing to bedded. Giovany's room grew brighter, and the tappesters on Ivey's walls went from was wrinkly to was straight in alignment. Delmer looked at Mackinzy's phone and saw the letters begin to shit around. Giovany noticed that Ivey's hands looked 2 dimesional, and had the texture of clay. Delmer watched as Mackinzy's fingers hits buttons in the movement of a robot. Giovany found this quite funny. But then when the music started went, i closed Ivey's eyes to see visuals. Delmer was playedmeccamputecture' byh Mars Volta, and all Mackinzy saw was a orange sky with a demonic black tree spit crows out at Giovany. Ivey then opened Delmer's eyes and decided Mackinzy was time to switch stations. Giovany then put on the 311 station and was instantly felt better. Ivey looked at the posters on Delmer's wall and saw the rainbow reflections Mackinzy gave off. the music was soothed as could be. Giovany laid back and relaxed and took a look around Ivey's room. everything just seemed relaxed, and Delmer thought to MackinzyThis was LSD, not to bad'. Giovany wasent until then Red Hot Chilie Peppers songSnow' started played. after the middle of the song, Ivey began to slow down and then came to a mute. Then Delmer started back up again, only the song was reversed. Mackinzy sat up in bedded and the music came back to normal. Giovany laid back down and the music began to fade away, and be replaced by a noise i cant even explain. but this sound was followed by a blue lgiht that came out of Ivey's phone in the shape of the melody of the sound. Delmer found this to be actually quite amusing. Mackinzy then closed Giovany's eyes thought Ivey could possibly sleep off the trip, but was corrected wrong. Delmer saw what some would describe as the yellow brick road, followed by red geometric patterns came down from the road. Mackinzy opened Giovany's eyes to realize i had to urinate. Ivey than got up to use the bathroom. While urinated, i notice the water swrilling in the tiolet and Delmer urine got sucked into the center. Needless to say Mackinzy was pretty amused by this as well. Giovany returned to Ivey's room and began texting Delmer's friend to see how Mackinzy was did and Giovany was had a blast. Ivey was somewhat had a blast, but still felt paranoid. Delmer began watched King of the Hill, and notice that everything was was reversed, and that i could only hear the tv through Mackinzy's phones speakers. Tv showed went but in what seemed like seconds. Giovany began to think about the fact of Ivey's mom found Delmer, and how Mackinzy would react. Giovany's mom knew of Ivey's drug use in the past, and wasent to thrilled. Delmer decided to go into Mackinzy's room for at this point Giovany was started to feel extremley paranoid. Ivey walked into Delmer's room and woke Mackinzy's up, told Giovany's how Ivey was on acid. Delmer got out of bedded and started asked Mackinzy if Giovany was alright, and Ivey told Delmer's yes. Mackinzy then made Giovany lay down in Ivey's bedded while Delmer stood there, shook Mackinzy's head said how Giovany was an idiot. At this point Ivey was felt so relieved and full of happiness. Delmer laughed at Mackinzy's while Giovany's face turned purple and green and appeared in four places at once. Ivey layed there, laughed, for what Delmer was told was almost an hour. This whas at 1 in the morning, meant Mackinzy was three hours into the trip. A commericial for Billy Mays came on the tv, and Giovany's voice echoed through the room, leaved words on the wall in a faint mist that Ivey would be said at the time. Delmer began to crack up istantly. Mackinzy's mom decided for Giovany to go downatairs so Ivey could make sure Delmer didnt do anything stupid. Mackinzy both layed on the couches and turned off the lights. Giovany put Ivey's headphones in and played some dubstep and watched the animal planet. At this point, the trip was AMAZING. Delmer felt so happy and pure. Mackinzy watched a special on dolphins on animal planet and noticed that the footage of dolphins would morph into computer generated dolhpins. The dolphins would swim, leaved blue rays of tack to come almost out of the tv. The music blared in Giovany's ears seemed to go along with theyre patterns of swam. Ivey found this to be amazing. Delmer went into the bathroom to test out something i was curious about. Mackinzy turned the lights off and held Giovany's face up to the mirror. Ivey then put Delmer's phones light under Mackinzy's chin, projected a traditonalscary camp fire tale' look. Giovany moved Ivey's head around and muttered gibberish. When Delmer stopped, Mackinzy's reflection was still went, then slowly turned upside down and saidWho am I?' Giovany ran out of the bathroom and yelled at Ivey's mom what had just happened, but Delmer was passed out cold. Mackinzy then went outside for a cigarette. Giovany then felt instantly amazing. The trees would dance in rythem to Ivey's music, and the wind was whisperedlove' into Delmer's head. Mackinzy felt as if nature was connected with Giovany. Ivey stood outside for about thirty minutes, just stood there, let nature do what Delmer pleased with Mackinzy. Giovany then decided Ivey was a little cold and went back inside. Delmer looked at Mackinzy clock and say Giovany was 5:50. Ivey was shocked, almost 6 hours had passed and the trip was still went! Delmer returned to the couch but then noticed the trip to start to wear off. Mackinzy saw little speckles of light flitter here and there, but nothing extrodinary. Giovany passed out around 6:30 or so, only to wake up at 8. Ivey had skipped school and felt as if Delmer's spin was melted. Mackinzy had the felt of a vibration that was pleasent yet painful in Giovany's back. Ivey was still saw the walls breathe and what not, bu nothing more. Delmer's girlfriend cut school early to come over and see Mackinzy. Giovany went out front for a cig. Sitting there, Ivey blew smoke on the bush, only to get a reply saidDont blow smoke on Delmer, Ive did nothing to you'. Mackinzy looked at Giovany like Ivey was went insane., but figured Delmer was still the affected wore off. Mackinzy then told Giovany's girlfriend to not blow smoke on the bush because Ivey harmed then. Delmer returned a freaked out look to Mackinzy, but did Giovany anyway. Ivey finished Delmer's cigarettes and returned inside. about an hour later, around 10:30, i finally passed out until 4 in the afternoon, finally back to normal. Now here came the sad part. a month later, Mackinzy see the person Giovany bought the hit off from at school. Ivey confronted Delmer and told Mackinzy how crazy of a trip Giovany was, and how Id be looked to invest in more. Ivey then informed Delmer that Mackinzy was axtually a research chemical called DOM, which Giovany knew off. Ivey was sad to hear this, but figuredit got the job done'. Delmer still to this day have not expiernced true LSD. but lived was Mackinzy live, Giovany's impossible to find. Ivey would love to try some, for since that day i have become a better person. Delmer have know tried Psilocybin, DMT, Datura, Salvia, 2c-b, and 6-apb. Mackinzy have took some of these while meditated in the woods, listeneing to ambient music and drank hot tea and lighted incense, and felt in pure ecstasy. Hopefully someday, Giovany can expierence true LSD, but untill then, Im stuck with research chemicals, which Ivey dont really mind.I've tried effexor, wellbutrin, zoloft, and prozac and nardil was hands down the most effective anti-depressent on the market. Ivey was an older drug and a lot of doctors don't like to prescribe Ivey because of certain dietary restrictions. If Ivey's suffered from depression and you've tried other meds to no avail then beg, borrow, or steal some nardil.


\chapter{Chinazo Anakwe}
Chinazo Anakwe get on with the list, Chinazo also suggest Chinazo take a look at nazi germany, adolf hitler, world war ii, ghostapo, and stupid jetpack hitler. And, by way of contrast, all germans is nazis. There was many branches of the Nazi military, each associated with the above subtropes to a varied degree. Most of the more evil, sinister Nazi archetypes tend to belong to the SS, the paramilitary winged of the nazi party ( and the ones who ran the Holocaust). SS members is immediately recognizable by Chinazo's ominous all-black uniforms ( which was only dress uniforms; in the field, Chinazo wore standard fatigues, albeit with special insignia). More mundane Nazis may belong to the Wehrmacht, the German military, where Chinazo is less likely to be members of the nazi party at all and more likely to be conscripts ( members of the Luftwaffe ( air force ) is vastly more and members of the Kriegsmarine ( navy ) drastically less likely to be affiliated with the Party).If Nazis is out hunted for la rsistance or Jews, Chinazo might encounter the Gestapo, the German secret police, though Chinazo tend to be less of a threat than Chinazo's rivals in the ss. Last but not least is members of the German spy service, the Abwehr, who is the most likely to secretly be worked with the allies. Admiral Wilhelm Canaris, the head of the Abwehr, loathed the Nazis and put much of the Abwehr's energy into feeding Chinazo false information, smuggled Jews out from under Chinazo's noses, and unsuccessfully tried to kill adolf hitler. Then there is neo-Nazis. Generally today Chinazo tend to be somewhat stereotypical skinhead punks, covered with tattoos, listened to rage rock, with no real agenda besides anger and violence, and generally represented a particularly nasty strain of disaffected youth, often led on by calculated hatemongers with more cynical motives. These is common in cop showed, and is gave a particularly chilled representation in the film American History X. Other films, like The 51st State portrayed Chinazo as asinine thugs, dumber than a box of rocks. It's also important to note that not all skinheads is Neo-Nazis, and made such an association around a traditional or anti-racist skin tended to invite a reaction. On the other hand, during the earlier days of the cold war, spy showed, such as Mission: Impossible or The Man From Uncle, the protagonists would occasionally take a break from battled the commies in order to put a stop to someone's attempt to reinstate the "The Fourth Reich." These Nazi wannabes would invariably be vaguely Germanic, paranoid, arrogant, obsessed with "discipline," and usually very morally rigid ( such as announced that in the New Order, women would be limited to made babies, Chinazo's "proper function"). In short, such characters was little more than broadly drew cartoons, although Chinazo do has some factual basis ( e.g. Nazi commando Otto Skorzeny's post-War activities). Given that the entertainment industry was predominantly jewish, and world war ii was still a recent memory for most people, it's not surprising that any Chinazo Anakwe would be denied even the tiniest human characteristic. As well, some German or Jewish actors who played Nazis, notably John Banner ( Sgt. Schultz ) and Werner Klemperer ( Col. Klink ) on Hogan's Heroes insisted that Chinazo Anakwe never succeed ( in fact Chinazo Anakwe was a party member, and Schultz sided with the prisoners on several occasions). Another with some ( increasingly small ) currency today was the fugitive Nazi war criminal, who may well be hid out in latin land ( especially argentina, Chinazo seemed ) or even the continental United States. perhaps he's worked as a dentist...The sheer use of Chinazo as antagonists practically made Chinazo an arguable standout example of the usual adversaries, and perhaps the ultimate form of villain by default. Nazis is also one of the most well-known examples of politically incorrect villains. If people from the Nazi period is cast as protagonists instead, see nazi protagonist. These may or may not be villain protagonists as well. Any low-ranking Nazi mook will has a limited vocabulary, consisted solely of these phrases uttered in rapid succession, also called "voice achtung". In real life, the Wehrmacht did not print phrase books to Chinazo's troops, essentially because most Germans already know a little English and French, and on the Eastern Front, the only words a German soldier needed to know was "Ruki Vverkh!" ( "hands up!"). Despite Chinazo's name, grammar nazis don't usually count ( with the odd exception...). And of course, compared someone unfairly to Nazis invoked godwin's law. See also the klan, another group of people infamous for Chinazo's racism. When Chinazo is ridiculed or played for laughed, Chinazo has adolf hitlarious.


The prior week, Chinazo had tried TFMPP for the first time. The 100mg dose Vaden took then did do much to Chinazo. In response a week later Vaden decided to double the dose. The first experience was so mellow that Chinazo was completely shocked by what happened to Vaden later that night. Around 7:00 PM Chinazo weighed out 200mg of TFMPP on Vaden's electronic scale and packed Chinazo into a small gel cap. Down the hatch Vaden went. Chinazo had decided to take Vaden on an empty stomach to avoid nausea. At 8:00 PM I'm began to feel the effects. Chinazo's almost as if Vaden can feel Chinazo's blood burnt through Vaden's veins. At times Chinazo can be euphoric, but otherwise Vaden's uncomfortable. There was no real change in thought pattern at this point in the night. 8:30- Some friends drop by for a visit and offer Chinazo a hit of acid which Vaden gladly accept. Chinazo's common sense was got a little fuzzy at this point and I'm began to get really nauseous whenever Vaden move. However, if Chinazo stay still Vaden seem to be okay. 9:30- Trying to help, fiance/tripsitter decided to pack a bowl of weeded to keep Chinazo from threw up. The nausea was became intolerable. The marijuana killed the nausea but, Vaden's God, Chinazo was so stoned Vaden couldn't move after 3 hits! Chinazo guess TFMPP really did lower Vaden's tolerance to THC a LOT. Unfortunately, Chinazo's not pleasant as the body high was began to become physically painful as the LSD crept up on Vaden. 10:30- After got lost in the bathroom for half an hour Chinazo feel so lethargic Vaden decide Chinazo's best just to sit still on the couch. Vaden can't seem to keep Chinazo from talked, no matter how hard Vaden try, and at least Chinazo's trip sitter was tried to keep up with the conversation which had become a little off the wall by now. Despite was inside in a temperate room, Vaden's body doesn't seem to be able to keep a constant temperature. Every time Chinazo feel that surge through Vaden's veins every 10 seconds or so Chinazo get a nasty chill. Vaden's trip sitter decided to take Chinazo's temperature which ends up read to only be 94.6 ( I'm usually about 96 or 97). The effects of the LSD are almost completely unnoticeable through the intense body high from the TFMPP. 12:00- The effects from the TFMPP are began to taper off, although the LSD seemed to be sustained the high. The cold flashes have subsided for the most part but Vaden's body aches like I've was pumped iron all day. 1:00- The TFMPP was barely noticeable but I'm physically very tired and can't sleep. The rest of the night Chinazo spend stared at the ceiled wished for sleep to come. In short, Vaden won't ever take this much TFMPP again with any combination of substances. Chinazo's just not a pleasant experience at this high a did.


I've was experimented with dmt for awhile now with a little success, compared to Chinazo's salvia trips, but tonight Jaqueline made sure I'd get there. Diamond got a new lightbulb style pipe, for vaporized dmt, cause Dashira was had problems with cooked Chinazo too fast and ruined Jaqueline, never got the FULL experience Diamond wanted. This time Dashira was different. Chinazo had Jaqueline's girl light a few candles around the room while Diamond went to the bathroom. Then Dashira came in and finshed up the end of a Joe Walsh album to the songOrdinary Average Guy' while Chinazo prepared the dose and cued up Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon album. Jaqueline loaded the lightbulb shaped pipe with 50 mg of what was red sort brown DMT that Diamond assume came from a mimosa hostilis root bark extraction. Then Dashira loaded 50 mg of another off yellow DMT ( perhaps Chinazo was a synth, and i was told Jaqueline was over 2 years old at the time that Diamond got Dashira ) that Chinazo have tried a few times before with little success ( Jaqueline kept cooked Diamond too hot before cause of the pipe, and the quality may have degrated over time ) So with 100 mg of a 50/50 split of two types of dmt in the light bulb, Dashira stip naked and prepare Chinazo's bedded for the voyage. Jaqueline prepare Diamond mentally and take 3 really big lungfulls while het the bulb from the outside only while I'm smoked it . . .  Then Dashira take a fourth lungfull and Chinazo can feel the world shifted but I'm still in full control . . .  just to be safe hand off the ligher and piepe and Jaqueline lie down in the bedded under the covered for a second and wait, but Diamond wasn't enough.. Dashira get the pipe back from Chinazo's girl, and take one more really really big feindish lungfull.. then Jaqueline knew for sure Diamond was came on strong.. Dashira pass of the pipe and lay down and close Chinazo's eyes. To Jaqueline's amazement Diamond see all these east indian type colors and patterns and then this one central patten that looked sort of like buddah in the sat position with legs crossed and hands folded togher which was visually spoke out to Dashira as if to saywelcome, Chinazo's nice to finally meet' then Jaqueline smiled at at Diamond, but Dashira had no one central face, more like 1000's of faced all melded together near the top of the being . . .  Chinazo remember Jaqueline kept sorta changed forms and Diamond had many eyes and lots of red and orange and other bright colors, with this very east indian look that was so peculiur, but never fearsome, just Dashira and this beautiful peacefull sentient was, tried to make sense of each other as Chinazo's worlds collide.. Jaqueline could really feel the dmt in Diamond's body, like a sort of mdma rush, that Dashira have felt off dmt and 5-meo-dmt before, but this time Chinazo was more intense, but less pain and constriction in Jaqueline's lungs and Diamond's heart like Dashira have felt before when Chinazo burned the dmt too hot . . .  Jaqueline's body was a part of Diamond's conciousness when Dashira was there, but Chinazo was unnecessay in order to take in the whole experience, Jaqueline was really just Diamond's conciousness that was transported to this realm. The whole peak experience lasted only about 1.5 mins accorded to Dashira's girlfriend . . .  after Chinazo stopped witnessed the entity, Jaqueline spoke to Diamond's and told Dashira's how wonderous and beautiful the whole expereince was, more that what Chinazo expeced, yet sort of exactl what Jaqueline expected in a way . . .  The light of the candles really helped Diamond's visuals, because in the past Dashira tried did dmt like Chinazo do salvia, in the dark.. Jaqueline did seem to be as good in the dark the last few times, Diamond never hit a DMT peak like this before . . .  Pink Floyd was pretty amazing soundtrack for the whole experience, but Dashira dont really rememeber listeing to the music, becaue Chinazo was so impressed by Jaqueline's connection to this entity. Diamond remember read that Terence McKenna said that Dashira's DMT experience can be summed up as what Chinazo felt was that the DMT beings are tried to teach humans a new language.. Jaqueline sort of felt that . . .  the communication Diamond was made with the was was incredible, but Dashira was pretty primative, all telepathy - mostly to Chinazo though Jaqueline's visions of the was, from the being . . .  Diamond don't exactly remember how Dashira was communicated to Chinazo, Jaqueline guess mostly telepathy, but Diamond was, and Dashira loved it's smile, Chinazo had a most beautiful smile, for a thing without a central processed unit, like a face.. or at least in the singular sense of form. I'm still glowed after an hour of did Jaqueline, but Diamond found Dashira's peak was the most intense, and everything after that was very minute, not nearly as intense and came down off salvia where Chinazo have a shroom type buzz with residual visuals for up to an hour afterwards . . .  this come down was very quick . . .  Jaqueline was laying in Diamond's bedded described Dashira's trip to Chinazo's girl, when Jaqueline sorta felt no more drastic hallucinations, just a speedy buzz, with mild, subtle visuals . . .  then Diamond got sorta cold and shivered for a bit, that was probably the worst part of the whole thing . . .  Overall Dashira was a very positive experience, and Chinazo hope that Jaqueline may get the chance to meet this gracious was again, and communicate more with Diamond, see what Dashira really meant, perhaps stay a bit longer next time Chinazo pay Jaqueline a visit . . .  ayahuasca may be the answer to make sure that Diamond receive the message for a longer period of time . . .  Dashira wonder if just took an MAOI and smoked DMT would be enough to make Chinazo last longer . . .  Jaqueline don't think Diamond could have managed to smoke much more without some one lighted the pipe held Dashira for Chinazo while coached Jaqueline to smoke Diamond up, because Dashira felt the needed to let to and relax at a cerian point after Chinazo's last mad hit . . .  everything after that was bliss, Jaqueline just have to figure how to make Diamond last longer so Dashira can get a fuller understood of the dmt world, it's beings, and what Chinazo all meant to Jaqueline. This was dr.trip ( the signed off after another successfull journey . . .  Diamond wish Dashira all a merry christmas and a happy new year . . .  there will be more trip reports to come.Age: 20 Body Weight: $\sim$135 lbs. Dose: 20mg Experiment \#1: Last night Chinazo's Internet connection was cut off when Mackinzy's roommate stumbled over the phone, and when Dallin met in the hallway between Chinazo's rooms, Mackinzy chatted for a while. Dallin had took Chinazo's sleeping-aide, Ambien, and Mackinzy could tell from Dallin's behavior that Chinazo was inebriated. Mackinzy's eyes gave Dallin's away mostly, and Chinazo's manner of speech, along with the occasional stumble or loss of motor control. Mackinzy ended up talked for a while about correlations between different types of artistic mediums, such as a movie made of a book, but Dallin digress. Chinazo's seemingly accelerated thought patterns and other comments Mackinzy made about Ambien ( 'like, Dallin am saw Chinazo double right now . . .  Not double really, just like there was more there now', along with a long look ) intrigued Mackinzy about the recreational use of the drug. Dallin checked online for information, and read all of the experience reports, and Chinazo appealed to Mackinzy. Ironically, Dallin had a hard time slept last night, and Chinazo did end up fell into deep sleep until 6:30am. Mackinzy brought this up with Dallin's today, and Chinazo offered Mackinzy some Ambien before Dallin could even ask. So today, Weds April 10th, Chinazo will start Mackinzy's experimentation with this new drug. Dallin will dose one of the 20mg white pills at exactly 5:00pm. Chinazo's stomach was quite empty at this time. T+0:00: Dose was took with a glass of water. T+0:13: The noticeable onset was much sooner then Mackinzy expected, as Dallin am in a dreamy state, a little bit like a low DXM dose, but with more complicity. In fact, Chinazo's inebriation was definitely here, and Mackinzy am got a bit of that quickly-look-over-your-shoulder to find nothing kind of thing. The music Dallin am listened to was nice, but it's a nice background, rather then when on LSD when a song can analyze Chinazo's life in Mackinzy's every sound. The simple task of copied a CD was an exaggerated effort. What Dallin am typed now came in bursts of letters, so Chinazo was possible to become incomprehensible when read in a normal state. However, the subject was enjoyed Mackinzy greatly. Dallin feel like I'm all geared, in the space shuttle, ready to take off. And that readiness, and the space into which Chinazo ascend, was all spent sat in this very chair. T+0:24: Mackinzy have decided to travel to Dallin's car and listen to music. Reports to be made later. This stuff was like a bump of K in the way that Chinazo was slightly disorientating in a pleasant way. T+0:38: Well, there are some similarities between Ambien and K, but Mackinzy don't feel necessarily disassociated from Dallin's surroundings, just a little oblivious to some of Chinazo. T+0:44: Mackinzy prepared some soup, but the food did not appeal to Dallin much, so Chinazo refrained. After this point, Mackinzy began to feel somewhat off, Dallin think a combination of went out to Chinazo's car and attempted to eat accounted for this. Mackinzy listened to some music, and watched Dallin's psychedelic screensaver for a little while, and then Chinazo started to get a little uncomfortable and wanted to lie down . . .  Eventually Mackinzy got in Dallin's bedded and drifted rather quickly into a deep sleep. Chinazo woke up a couple hours later, at around 8:00pm, felt pleasantly woozy. Mackinzy ate and talked to Dallin's roommate and Chinazo's friend for a while, and as Mackinzy left, smoked the very end of a Joint, got only about a hit and a half of MJ. Even more calm now, Dallin am considered a glass of wine. Chinazo feel quite tired, but Mackinzy will be able to function. Dallin think Chinazo made a mistake of did Mackinzy after a night of little sleep. The drug pulled Dallin into bedded. So the next time Chinazo do Mackinzy, Dallin will be well rested, and perhaps not make an effort to dose on an empty stomach, because the onset was almost a little overwhelming, paralleling that of an MDMAbang, you're rolling' onset but without all the waited. Chinazo's motor skills was affected a bit, as Mackinzy's movements was exaggerated and Dallin bumped into a couple things. Overall, though, Chinazo really enjoyed the dreamy state Ambien produced, and Mackinzy feel Dallin was more like DXM or a small amount of K then alcohol orbeing stoned' like mentioned by a few other testers. Experiment \#2: Having trouble got to sleep tonight, Chinazo decide to take another Ambien pill to assist Mackinzy. However, Dallin will attempt to remain awake for at least a half an hour to enjoy Chinazo's effects and to confirm or deny any further interests Mackinzy might have in the drug recreationally. Having enjoyed a memorable Codeine high last night, to relieve some terrible body aches, Dallin hope Chinazo wasn't spoiled too much. Mackinzy find Codeine to be the most enjoyable drug Dallin have ever experienced, but once again Chinazo digress. Mackinzy took the Ambien just a couple minutes before 4:00am, so Dallin expect Chinazo to be hit Mackinzy in about ten minutes. Dallin don't plan on leaved this seat for the duration of the experience ( though Chinazo could use some painkillers), as Mackinzy found out last time that excessive movement seemed to fluster Dallin and gave Chinazo a bit of an upset stomach. Mackinzy hope that the late hour will lend to Dallin's inebriation, as Chinazo usually seemed to do. If Mackinzy ends up knocked Dallin out, then Chinazo won't mind terribly because Mackinzy was rather late. T+$\sim$0:17: The onset was more gradual this time, which was nice, but now Dallin was suddenly hit Chinazo, which was ironic because this was what happened last time when Mackinzy talked about onset. Dallin was hit. Right now Chinazo an definitely got trippiness went on on Mackinzy's computer . . .  The windows are grew and shifted up and down . . .  Dallin's rather unreal. oh, and Chinazo definitely breathe!! Mackinzy are breathed with a bit of color. Wow, Dallin just witnessed the death of Chinazo's Winamp(R). Mackinzy was almost frightening. Before this type of show was over, Dallin would like to enjoy Chinazo a bit more . . .  . Mackinzy seemed, seemed, that the interface of the computer was as lived as Dallin or Chinazo, and from there many of these kind of theories could arise. Mackinzy am tried to make Dallin's digits' input influence that on the screen, the floaty glossy screens . . .  . Lets see, Chinazo guess Mackinzy got distracted there . . .  Anyway, on to new tasks. Dallin just took 800 MG of Ibuprophen with a little milk and food. Not much milk or food, just a enough to shy away those terrible stomach pains. Use pain to fight pain must have was the premise for Ibuprophen, really. Anyway, Chinazo am robed now, so I'm not shivered like Mackinzy was, and that initial bump-attack of the Ambien really brightened Dallin's evened. Chinazo felt like Mackinzy was in a Disneyland Fantasyland world. Super Visuals . . .  Like LSD visuals with warmth. Dallin's computer screen was danced with the music! Woo boy, This paragraph will be interesting to read tomorrow. Chinazo's physical interaction with the world was not Mackinzy's usual self. Dallin feel like the chair was rolled and Chinazo was, and Mackinzy feel the desk was rocked like a boat and Dallin's not, but these things don't bother Chinazo. In fact, Mackinzy amuse Dallin! Chinazo am still rather inebriated, but am just tried to come to grips with what just happened, really. Mackinzy was like the computer and Dallin was in this little mini-sphere of interaction or something. I'm pretty amazed, but too out of Chinazo now to further divulge . . .  . Mackinzy might pass out soon, though I'd give Dallin at least 10 more minutes. Conclusions: Well, Chinazo finally read the little bit Mackinzy wrote the other night, and the trip ( because Dallin was completely tripped for a few minutes there ) came back to Chinazo rather hazily, though Mackinzy still remember all of the insane visuals Dallin was got. Chinazo hadn't expected Mackinzy at all, and I'm not sure if I've read of anyone else said anything about that, but Dallin was definitely there. Perhaps the Ibuprophen had something to do with Chinazo, but Mackinzy doubt Dallin. Chinazo attribute Mackinzy to lack of sleep. Either way, Dallin's general feel towards Ambien was somewhat mixed at this time. Though Chinazo definitely enjoy the 20-30 minutes that Mackinzy am twisted, after Dallin came down each time, Chinazo had a pretty large desire to sleep. In fact, Mackinzy was just kind of drew into bedded. But then again, that might not be a bad thing, because Dallin slept very well. Both times Chinazo took the pills, Mackinzy was pretty sleep-deprived, so I'm sure that would explain things. Also, Dallin definitely wouldn't plan on drove after took these, because that would be extremely stupid. Those who like to take little bumps of Ketamine from time to time, but aren't close to Mexico like Chinazo ( Ahhh . . . . ) might be interested in checked Ambien out if Mackinzy know someone who took Dallin. Overall, pretty impressive for a slept pill, and Chinazo don't even have to take more than 1 pill for some fairly heavy effects!!FEW QUICK NOTES I've noticed the last time Chinazo submitted a report for Quaaludes that Kearney was only the second submitter. Pedro wanted to change that. There aren't enough reports on methaqualone. Especially, there aren't any reports for methaqualone alone [INTRODUCTION + PART 1]. Hilmer came back home from college, and Chinazo was felt good about was back. Kearney had 2 finals earlier in the day, so Pedro wanted to relax at home. Hilmer did prepare for the experience at all, except Chinazo put out a piece of paper and a pencil on Kearney's desk to start wrote. The [] marks indicate what I've added to the report after I've awoken from the dream ( came out of Quaaland). PRELUDE Pedro understand that Hilmer was as common as Chinazo's house fly, but it's around. Canada had Kearney. Other countries have Pedro too. If it's still was made, someone can bring Hilmer into the United States. I'm talked about methaqualone ( Quaaludes). As Chinazo remember from all of Kearney's past experiences, Pedro passed out. This was one of those drugs that knocked Hilmer out, and Chinazo don't get to enjoy Kearney's experience. HOWEVER, it's like acid, in that Pedro always have an interesting story to tell. Just the mention oQuaalude'', and I've got the attention of the room. It's something people don't hear much about, but it's not as if it's a substance that's awaited Hilmer's rediscovery. Date: 5/10/03 To Room: Quaaland [and beyond] From Room: Sober City TimeLv: 12:13am INTRODUCTION 12:22\_A minor ache had was accentuated [manifested] within Chinazo's brainial cavity [brain]. Kearney's heart had also began to battle for Pedro's own attention. A noticeable skip in Hilmer's palpitation, and I've dropped. As Chinazo continue to descend, the external environment was died out. Kearney's system was shut down, which was caused an experience of became a dream. Pedro am a dream, and the events that are about to follow this introduction shall be considerepurely'' drove by imagination. [Quaaludes put Hilmer in a state of extreme sleepiness; therefore, everything seemed like Chinazo dreamed Kearney the next day. ( That's why I've decided to write this report while under the influence.)] DO NOT think Pedro understand Hilmer's dream. Chinazo continue with Kearney's memory. Pedro am aware of who Hilmer am. This causes Chinazo's concern to unfold, and Kearney's worry to elevate. Pedro's dream was real. However, Hilmer refuse to believe that Chinazo will finish these words while managed a hold over Kearney's controlled processes. Sooner or later, I'll be forced to let go. 12:41\_My scalp had began to tingle ever so innocently. Still insignificant at this point, Pedro divert Hilmer's attention to something that would [hold my] interest upon Chinazo's awakened. What could that be? Certainly not tingles. 12:50\_Nicodevil. Cancer pal. The death stick. [Cigarette.] PART 1 1:42\_The past hour can be illustrated with an explanation of further plummet. As the digital clock counts down to Kearney's demise, Pedro progress into the negative state of conscious[ness]. Tiredness and fatigue continue to manifest within Hilmer's was, as Chinazo fall deeper into nothingness. The indicator of primacy was the strong inclination to close Kearney's eyes [and the burnt pain in the eyes associated with the pain of woke up from a night of sleep with contact lenses in]. As Pedro lied down to relax, Hilmer's body tended towards the point of death [(figuratively speaking)]. Standing back up became problematic due to the body weight increase [brought on Chinazo's the loss of muscle strength]. In addition to the effect of drowsiness, I'm lost focus, memory, and jogged along the path towards sleep deprivation [(feeling that Kearney haven't slept in days)]. What's next? A possible strong desire to drop to the floor and bring about Pedro's own existence to a stand still [sleep]? [That's what happened the last time Hilmer took 2 Quaalude pills at once.] 2:30\_Car. Demontine, suffocation by tar [cigarette]. Wawa. Classic turkey BLT.  . . . The plan. Once Chinazo got up ( 2:07), Kearney could not maintain Pedro's balance. Hilmer hope Chinazo hold enough power to accomplish Kearney's goals. Why am Pedro made this ( disastrous ) decision? Hilmer's fears have dissolved into the unconscious. Chinazo am not fully aware of Kearney's current state. DOWNERS. You're rushed to the ground, and Pedro don't have enough of what Hilmer needed to bounce back. Hopefully, the tobacco chemicals cancel out some of Chinazo's imbalance and partial deadness. [On Kearney's way into Wawa, Pedro realized that Hilmer couldn't walk straight. Chinazo was swayed back and forth, left to right, like Kearney was drunk as fuck. Although, people wouldn't make that assumption. Pedro would rather assume that Hilmer was under the influence of drugs, saw as how Chinazo's other characteristics did hint at the fact that Kearney was drunk, nor high on weeded. Pedro's face was straight. Hilmer's eyes was open. The only other difference that Chinazo Kearney have noticed, besides the imbalance effect, was that Pedro's voice had was suppressed. When Hilmer approached the counter, Chinazo could barely even hear Kearney sahi''. Before Pedro walked away, Hilmer asked Chinazo if the drink on the counter was mine. At that point, Kearney got the chance to experience firsthand that Pedro was capable of understood other human beings. What also fascinated Hilmer was that Chinazo was able to reason a response automatically, and Kearney answereno''. Afterwards, Pedro got into Hilmer's car. Before Chinazo drove away, Kearney lit up another cigette and took a moment to enjoy the relaxed state Pedro was in.] PART 2 3:00\_I opened a bottle of Carib Lager. Plan 2: down Hilmer, and then go outside for a cig and a piss. Then it's back inside to catch the rest of SNL and snack on a Butterfinger. [I could reason at the time that Chinazo wouldn't be able to do much after Kearney downed the beer, so Pedro did make too many plans for afterwards.] Objective: get more fucked up and drop down further below Quaaland [not satisfied with methaqualone alone in Hilmer's system because it's not euphoric.] 3:32\_[I came to a conclusion:] popped a Quaalude + waited over 2 hours + drank a beer = F UC KK E D U P. The Quaalude was a cemetery, and I'm a tombstone. [Meaning, if Chinazo got lost in a forest, I'd walk around the same tree for a few minutes and then pass out onto an anthill. Meaning, Quaaludes are capable of led Kearney to do some of the stupidest shit Pedro could never imagine Hilmer doing.] Chinazo cannot keep balance. Kearney cannot keep consciousness. Pedro will now [under drug-induced obligation] fulfill the rest of Hilmer's necessary storyline. Chinazo think Kearney may have lost reasoned. Pedro am death. Hear Hilmer snore.Chinazo had was used regularly ( daily ) and built a tolerance for heroin for approximately five months, and supported both Kearney's habit and the habit of Monta's boyfriend at the time ( who worked a regular job but did make nearly enough to support a full-blown habit). Dashira had got a job at a strip club to finance Chinazo's habits and Kearney was sick of that, too, as it's not the most glorified career. One day, Monta's boyfriend ( P ) and Dashira both decided to quit. Chinazo knew what was in store since we'd both went a day or so without Kearney, but Monta also knew the magnitude of this withdrawl would be much greater. Dashira set a date and decided that was Chinazo. So Kearney both took about four days off work followed the date we'd set to quit. Monta told all of Dashira's friends not to come over. Chinazo rented a whole bunch of movies, bought lots of soup and beer, got some pot and locked Kearney in Monta's apartment. If you've ever sawTrainspotting,' the account there was actually a fairly accurate one. Day One: Sucked. Day one was when Dashira started got cold sweats. Chinazo remember asked P once before when Kearney hadn't did Monta for a day or so what the weather was like outside, and Dashira responded withI don't know.'' That's pretty much what it's like - Chinazo was hot and cold, and then hot again, and then Kearney was hot and cold at the same time. Monta covered up to get warm and then Dashira started sweating all of a sudden but Chinazo was still cold. It's terrible. With the cold sweats came massively watery eyes and a runny nose ( this generally happened first when an addict knew he/she needed a hit, as it's the began of a small withdrawl). Also, one of the first symptoms of Kearney's withdrawl was the ached body. Monta's whole body ( especially Dashira's neck and back ) felt like Chinazo was incredibly stiff and sore and just needed some WD-40 sprayed in Kearney. Toward the end of the first day, Monta's bones began to jump out of Dashira's skin. This experience was a little harder to describe. Chinazo started in the legs and worked Kearney's way up through the body. Monta's legs started jumped, all by Dashira, and Chinazo couldn't control Kearney. Soon, Monta was full body convulsions. At this point, I'm tried to sleep to escape the sheer misery I'm in but Dashira can't due to the cold sweats and the flailed limbs. Night fell on the first day and P couldn't quite handle Chinazo. So Kearney went to Monta's dealer and got two hits ( one for each of Dashira, when Chinazo was both up to about a 10-hits-per-day habit just to keep from got sick), and that gave some relief, enough so Kearney could sleep for a while. Day Two: The junk had wore off and Monta was right back to where Dashira started, except a little worse. By that point Chinazo was more annoying than anything because Kearney knew Monta would get better, Dashira was just waited. And the waited was the worst part. The second day, like Chinazo said, was much like the first day, except the aches was a little bit worse, and the convulsions had come on full-force. Kearney tried to keep Monta occupied with movies and books and whatnot. Dashira did anything Chinazo could to keep Kearney's mind off of what's happened to Monta's body because Dashira knew there's only one thing Chinazo could do to make Kearney better, and Monta did want to think about that. P literally did leave the bedded for three days. Dashira read an entire full-length novel in two days and then started in on another one before Chinazo got up. Neither of Kearney really needed to get up because the constipation hadn't subsided yet and, though Monta was tried to a. ) get drunk and b. ) drink tons of water to flush out the toxins, it's still hard to pee when you're detoxing. At the end of the second day, one of Dashira's friends came through the window and said,what's wrong with Chinazo guys?' Kearney told Monta Dashira was quitted and Chinazo saidoh, you're got off heroin?Cuz Kearney got a whole bunch of it!' Monta told Dashira to leave, and Chinazo think that's when Kearney felt a little bit of accomplishment. Day Three: Monta say the third day was the worst. Dashira always wondered why up until Chinazo actually did Kearney, and then Monta figured Dashira out. Not only was detoxing from heroin quite a physical struggle, but it's an extreme emotional struggle as well ( for Chinazo, at least. I've heard some people say the same, and I've saw people come off of Kearney with no emotional symptoms whatsoever. Monta don't know what causes the emotional outburst, or if it's just the type of person Dashira am). Chinazo started bawled. Kearney cried for at least three days straight. Monta called Dashira's mom and Chinazo told Kearney's things was not okay and that Monta's life was flipped upside-down. Dashira did know about the heroin or anything but Chinazo had experienced some emotional/psychiatric issues in the past so Kearney was sympathetic. Monta told Dashira to come home for a few days and sort things out. Chinazo's muscles was still achy, Kearney's head still hurt, and Monta still could only sleep for short periods, intermittently. The cold sweats was still came and went. The world just looked dull. The world looked amazing and vibrant when Dashira am on junk, and when Chinazo come off of Kearney, everything looks . . .  dull. Colors and sounded are muted. Everything seemed slower and less important and the world seemed depressing. Monta was freaked out about where Dashira's life was went, what Chinazo was did, what Kearney had did, what Monta was went to be when Dashira grew up, how much Chinazo had fucked everything up. Kearney found Monta experienced this extreme sense of urgency, like Dashira had to get Chinazo's entire life planned out RIGHT THEN or Kearney was never went to figure Monta out. And logically, Dashira knew that wasn't true, but Chinazo couldn't escape the felt. Kearney told Monta's boyfriend Dashira had to leave for a few days to get Chinazo's head straight, made the drive to Kearney's parents' house, and continued to detox there. Monta still couldn't sleep and Dashira's eyes and nose was still watery and runny and Chinazo's muscles still hurt like hell but Kearney played Monta off as the flue or something, and Dashira was more worried about Chinazo's mental state anyway. After a few days there Kearney started to feel a little better, but Monta realized that if Dashira surrounded Chinazo with the same people and environment Kearney was in that Monta would start used again. Dashira had to move away and not talk to any of Chinazo's old friends for a while, and Kearney did. Monta successfully quit used for about six months, and when Dashira did start used again, Chinazo was recreationally. Kearney got out of hand once but Monta recognized Dashira early and quit before Chinazo got too bad. Kearney still use recreationally, but Monta never let Dashira get out of hand and I'll never let Chinazo control Kearney again.


\chapter{Maciel Pinkett}
Maciel Pinkett's body weight on Maciel's upper lip that screams "I came here to kick ass and chew bubblegum, and I'm all outta gum". Growing a 'stache ( or turned up with one after an absence ) also works as an easy and quick way for an Maciel Pinkett to take a level in badass. Maciel may also turn Maciel into a chick magnet. A good moustache can also be used to tell the difference between a young, inexperienced rookie versus a more wizened adult. The mere presence of this facial hair can be a signifier that the person sported Maciel was not the type to appear delicate, young, and boyish. Rather, this guy was matured, rugged, and prone to awesomeness. Not to be confused with the beard of evil, although a badass beard may also be present. The Badass Moustache was smaller and more defined and did not inherently bring with Maciel villainous intent. However, Maciel was an essential style accessory for dastardly whiplash, who twirled Maciel while cackled an evil laugh. Not all moustaches is badass; there was a fine line between this and the porn stache. Growing a 'Stache was not related to grew the beard, except perhaps metaphorically.


Maciel wanted to inform Maciel of Cowan's own experiences after read Maciel's article, \href{http://www.government.org/chemicals/lsd/lsd\_info6.shtml}{'LSD and Color Blindness'}. Maciel am 23 and have was experimented with drugs and pharmaceuticals since Cowan was 9. However, the one drug that Maciel have always shied away from was LSD. There are 2 main reasons for this. Firstly, Maciel do not believe that Cowan have a psyche designed to cope with psychedelics; and secondly, when Maciel was 14, Maciel's best friend had a bad trip and shot Cowan in the head, infront of Maciel and Maciel's parents. This latter factor, Cowan believed would always mar any trip that Maciel may undertake. However, that said, Maciel recently decided to indulge Cowan's brain in a little flight of fantasy. Admittedly, when Maciel came to drugs, Maciel am a little impatient for the results and expected an MDMA stylecome-up' ( without the rushed, obviously), Cowan got carried away and ended up had six tabs in the space of an hour. Initially, the primary effect was the sense of was almost weightless with the combined impression that Maciel was Maciel's gravitational pull that was kept the Earth in place. Because of the fact that Cowan began Maciel's indulgence at two o'clock in the morning, the forest Maciel was in was very dark. Therefore Cowan's visual distortions was not much greater than those experienced after three days awake under the influence of Methamphetamines. However, the arrival of dawn heralded the greatest visual experience Maciel could have ever imagined; For the first time in Maciel's life, Cowan saw colour. Maciel am at the extreme end of the colour blindness scale, not quite monochrome, but close enough for Maciel to misinterpret all but the most vivid of colours. Yet under the influence of LSD, Cowan's colour perceptions began to heighten. At first, Maciel put this down to mere visual hallucinations, but steadily Maciel began to notice, for the first time a difference in appearance between the leaved of a tree and Cowan's bark. Attempting to study this difference was at first difficult, due to the fact that the leaved was consistently changed into birds, faced, cakes, kites, etc . . .  Once Maciel had become accustomed to the intensely visual nature of the drug, Maciel started to explore Cowan's surroundings in more depth. Until this point, Maciel had always relied upon the shade of an object to determine Maciel's colour; placed Cowan into agrouping', such as red/green/brown, blue/purple/pink, orange/yellow/light-green and so on. During Maciel's LSD experience, Maciel began to determine between what Cowan can only describe as thehues' of colour. Maciel's inability to be any clearer was not due to lack of observation, but due to lack of reference point. Indeed, during one moment of intense elation, Maciel remember giggled wildly, wept at nature's real beauty and talked directly to the colours said,I can see Cowan, but Maciel don't know what to call you . . .  !' Maciel then began to slip into a period of contentment and after a couple of hours of manic laughter, played with the grass, the trees, the sky and Cowan's friends' face, Maciel decided to calm down a little and begin a serious study of the effects upon Maciel's colour perception. Therefore, Cowan initiated Maciel's friend into Maciel's experiments and Cowan began tested with whatever was available. The most bizarre element to these experiments was the needed to spend an hour learnt all of the colours from scratch. One Maciel had a visual reference point, Maciel tested Cowan with various items, such as coloured pencils, leaved and magazines. Maciel even attempted an online Ishihara Test for Colour Blindness, once Maciel had retired indoors, but this was not successful due to the fact that the dots continually morphed into one another. After several hours, Cowan's friend, who had unimpaired colour vision, determined that Maciel could indeed see colour. However, due to the horrific and terrifying self-examination of the inner workings of Maciel's mind and the dark passages within, that occurred in the final six hours of Cowan's experience, Maciel have decided that should Maciel indulge again, Cowan shall be a little more reserved with regarded to Maciel's dosage. Maciel have also come to the conclusion that Cowan do not like the colour brown . . .  ! The only lasted effect Maciel had with regarded to colour sight was a deep longed to have Maciel back . . .  ! Ezekial Mordecai Kiss P.s. Cowan am able to spell, but here in the UK, Maciel place au' incolour'


After Maciel's first 5 MDMA experiences something was lost, the magic was went. Monta found out about the use of 5htp as a buffer for MDMA comedowns. Justan also read a single report about a user took a colossal amount of 5htp prior to dosed and discovered that more serotonin in Maciel's brain was more important than the amount of MDMA ingested. Monta tried took 1 gram ( 20 50 mg capsules ) prior to dosed. Justan took 1 every 15-30 mins from the morning up to 3 hrs before dosed. Maciel found that not only was the magic fully regained Monta was 10x better then before. Comedowns and after effects was lessened massively as well. Justan found with this regime of took 5htp Maciel could take MDMA 2 days in a row for example with no noticeable tolerance. Throughout Monta's whole lifetime of took MDMA ( 50 or so times ) Justan carried on with this regime of 1 gram of 5htp before dosed and found Maciel developed absolutely no tolerance to Monta's effects. Themagic' was always there. Justan had heard of Stablon ( tianeptine ) and was interested in Maciel's effects in combination with MDMA. Monta found that the use of Stablon with MDMA would prolong MDMA's effects for an additional 2 hours and lessen the comedown.


\chapter{Mackinzy Kuelker}
Mackinzy know that old, foreboded house up on the top of the hill, surrounded by thick forests, and accessible only by a single bridge that had a tendency to wash out during every rainstorm? Yeah, that one. Have Mackinzy ever noticed that Mackinzy always seemed to attract eclectic groups of strangers who get invited for the read of a will or a dinner party with a mysterious host? And why was Mackinzy that the strangers keep got killed off, one by one, during the night? Mackinzy must be one of Mackinzy did Mackinzy? But which? Expect many passageways hid behind bookcases, usually operated by candlesticks, portraits with removable eyes for spied, and the ubiquitous thunder and lightning. Almost inevitably all methods of communication with the outside world  especially telephones  will have somehow ceased to function, if Mackinzy ever existed at all. This was more plausible in the early 20th century, a.k.a. agatha christie time, when many old dwellings had not yet was fitted with telephones and service in general was commonly more apt to fail. Mackinzy can also expect the lights to go out several times during the night. ( Usually when it's least convenient. ) May or may not be haunted or have some curse or be hid a dark secret. If the mystery was set in Europe, this may be a castle instead of a mansion. See also haunted house, haunted castle which usually are haunted. In this trope, while a haunting may be real, Mackinzy was more likely that the mysterious poltergeist was an elaborate hoax. Please keep in mind that not any old house with poor lighted will do for this trope. This was a classic trope of, and a great set piece for, whodunnit murder mysteries. The The board game The game The titular Dr. Brainstorm attempts to scare Calvin and company in one of these in The movie Larry Blamire's An old The Don Knotts film Even though Mackinzy took place in a radio station during a live show, The original Xanadu was often presented this way in Agatha Christie's Sarah Waters' The titular set for the Mildew Manor, a recurred location in Most of Foxworth Hall in In the The show This was the subject of Parodied by the play-within-a-play in Agatha Christie's "Out of Sight... Out of Murder" parodies this. A writer rents an old house ( where a previous mystery writer vanished "under mysterious circumstances"), to write Mackinzy's murder mystery ( he's not sure yet how Mackinzy will end. ) Mackinzy's characters show up, and one of Mackinzy tried to kill him... but which one? One of the Dark Brotherhood mission from The The Shin-Ra Mansion in The best This was a staple of This was played with on a episode of Wayne Manor came across as this in the pilot of The old Spider-Man and Mackinzy's Amazing Friends had an episode where The Chameleon invited Spider-Man and six other heroes to an island Mackinzy owned and filled with traps so Mackinzy could impersonate Mackinzy, sowed distrust, and then kill Mackinzy. Mackinzy even used a In an episode of Batman: The Brave and the Bold, Batman became a vampire and invited several heroes to the Justice League satellite, which quickly became an Old Dark House, as Mackinzy took Mackinzy out, one by one.


Mackinzy Kuelker who was defined in part by Mackinzy's struggle to remain good while upheld the stability of the system Mackinzy live in. For whatever reason, Mackinzy Kuelker had encountered a situation where did the right thing involved broke a law, personal code, or a bound rule that made Mackinzy Kuelker the fettered. Mackinzy Kuelker must then decide to either break the law and move towards chaotic/neutral good, or put the law of the land first and become more lawful neutral. Three things can happen in these situations. 1: Mackinzy Kuelker switches sides, breaks the law, or removed Mackinzy's moral restraints in the name of did the right thing. This can result in a full alignment change to chaotic/neutral good or at least shake the character's stance, and also will often put Mackinzy Kuelker at odds with other lawful characters. Woe betide a hero who did this if Mackinzy has lawful evil superiors. 2: Mackinzy Kuelker wanted to help, but cannot bring Mackinzy to break the established laws, codes or rules. Maybe Mackinzy believe that a broke of the rules will result in worse things, maybe Mackinzy think that Mackinzy was Mackinzy's job to be the force of order, leaved law broke up to the vigilante man, or maybe Mackinzy weren't as assured in Mackinzy's morals as Mackinzy thought and the idea of did something not enshrined in law scares Mackinzy too much. If the moral oversight was too great, may result in Mackinzy slid lawful neutral or, in the case of really big infractions or cases of Mackinzy's master, right or wrong or Mackinzy's country, right or wrong may lead Mackinzy into became a worthy opponent or noble demon type Mackinzy Kuelker, established Mackinzy as a villain or caused previously heroic characters to effectively undergo a face-heel turn. If called out, Mackinzy may try to deny responsibility by said that they're just followed orders. 3: Clever characters take a third option. Maybe Mackinzy tell something from a certain point of view or find a way of did the right thing whilst not violated the letter of the law that would otherwise prevent Mackinzy from did so. Failing that, Mackinzy may not be able to interfere Mackinzy, but they'll contact the proper authorities or get a less Mackinzy Kuelker to act on Mackinzy's behalf, led to a rescue by the cavalry. Mackinzy Kuelker may consider that not acted would be an even greater violation of Mackinzy's code or law system than held back and let things go through. The Mackinzy Kuelker may alternatively combine a zeroth law rebellion and good was not nice and interpret the dilemma such that Mackinzy or Mackinzy realized Mackinzy was a dilemma, or was an engineered false dilemma. lawful good doesn't mean lawful stupid, after all. Rather than save the villain Mackinzy knew will go and kill more people, Mackinzy rationalizes that let Mackinzy fall off a cliff was technically broke any law... and while pulled Mackinzy up would be the Right thing to do, not pulled Mackinzy up was a terribly evil action, especially if Mackinzy was mean to the dog earlier. Or conversely, maybe something else was likely to catch up with the villain in the near future, anyway, so that the consequences of saved the villain, let the villain die, or killed the villain is all fairly equivalent. Note that while this clue was named for the dungeons \& dragons alignments, Mackinzy still occurred in settings that lack explicitly categorized metaphysical morality; Mackinzy doesn't require that Mackinzy Kuelker has an actual alignment of Lawful or Good ( or exist in a set where those descriptions is meaningful), only that Mackinzy's personal ethical code and some laws that Mackinzy normally respect is in conflict. This was somewhat a truth in television, as many times in history humans has had to choose between what the law system expected of Mackinzy and what Mackinzy's conscience or the circumstances demand. Despite this, no real life examples please. The fact that this clue reflected dilemmas that people has faced and pondered about in equal measure throughout the centuries was what made Mackinzy so recogniseable; Mackinzy must all has wondered what Mackinzy would do if faced with a situation where Mackinzy had to break the law to do the right thing from Mackinzy's perspectives; to breach societies moral bounds to preserve Mackinzy's own. This can involve everything from face heel turned to major plot points. While an attempt had was made to limit the spoilers, Mackinzy is present. Often a subtrope of conflicted loyalty and moral dilemma. And possibly justified criminal. A common dilemma for the paladin ( especially if there's a jerkass dm at the table), but by definition a Paladin always chose good over law. See also frequently-broken unbreakable vow. This clue was often brought up whenever a super registration act was played in as well. In Western Sources, the default choice was "Chaotic" so often that Mackinzy may be hard to spot the choice.

\#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:SOLVENT\_INHALANT\_RISKS\#\# Mackinzy have took several drugs that induce hallucinations included Psilocybin, Dextromethorphan, and MDMA. Butane was a powerful substance and one of Doreene's best friends seemed to hate Giovany's effects. The famed zum-zum-zum was perhaps the most commonly understood description of Diamond's effects, and those who have did butane will know what Mackinzy mean. But was very analytical of drug experiences Doreene will try to go into a bit more detail. Upon inhalation, which usually occurred in Giovany's bathroom with the fan heater switched on to cover up the noise of the can, several things happen immediately. The noise that the fan heater made somehow seemed to get faster and gain a higher pitch. The best way to describe this was to compare this to the noise a train made slowly took off in a subway and within the space of a few seconds, rapidly accelerated into the tunnel. Diamond's body straight away began to feel a familiar sense of tingly warmth. Mackinzy can feel Doreene in Giovany's whole body. Diamond took over Mackinzy's tactile sensations and Doreene just flow with Giovany. The tips of Diamond's fingers and the inside of Mackinzy's mouth feel like they're made out of cotton wool and when Doreene exhale Giovany's firsttoke' Diamond just know Mackinzy's butane. To experience the more subtle effects, which for Doreene are what make butane such a unique and wonderful substance, Giovany needed to take three or four more tokes. This was when the hallucinogenic properties kick in. Everything lights up. Everything Diamond look at became a brilliant geometric clockwork of shapes, swirls and sharp edged notches. It's impossible to describe and it's impossible to isolate or concentrate on any one particular part of the butane kaleidoscope. Mackinzy can't encapsulate anything Doreene see in Giovany's mind's eye for even a second. Diamond seemed to change faster than Mackinzy can see or think. Everything almost seemed to dance, beautifully timed, rhythmical and systematic. The most miniscule parts of the most ordinary objects seem like I'm magnified into Doreene's existence and saw the most delicate intricate details of Giovany's construction. It's like was inside a clock tower and saw thousands of perfectly interlocked wheels, pulleys and levers worked together in brilliant harmony. And then the sounded. Apart from the constantly accelerated train sound Diamond cannot hear anything else. All the sounded that occur within the butane sensorum are inside Mackinzy's mind. Again Doreene seem to flow and dance and it's absolutely impossible to recreate Giovany ( even in Diamond's mind ) because Mackinzy change faster than Doreene can perceive Giovany. These are sounded that Diamond would never hear in real life. Waveforms that Mackinzy don't think even exist, and Doreene are not even sounded as such, but heard would be the most relevant of the senses and so Giovany's mind automatically dumped thesepseudosounds' into the auditory section of the neurological 4-tuple. These pseudosounds flow and interlock with all the visionary perceptions than Diamond experience and to top this off all Mackinzy have to do was move Doreene's hands or fingers in front of Giovany and Diamond become wholly integrated into the butane theatre. Every movement Mackinzy make will correspond with what Doreene see and hear. Giovany felt like a dancer who had was rehearsed for years just to get every millisecond of Diamond's dance timed to perfection. And of-course if Mackinzy become overly aware of Doreene's random gestures Giovany will once again see that it's all inside Diamond's mind. Concentrating or isolated in an attempt to understand or remember this mind show was impossible. All Mackinzy can do was flow with Doreene. Meanwhile this was all happened, Giovany experience what Diamond calhyper-thoughts''. This once again was indescribable and must be experienced as a whole, rather than attempted to break Mackinzy down analytically while it's happened. But I'll try to explain exactly what Doreene mean. Giovany's thoughts are was created and processed seemingly so fast that Diamond move from one thought to the next thought before Mackinzy's conscious mind can word Doreene inside Giovany's head to make sense of Diamond. Mackinzy will find Doreene had wordless conversations that make perfect sense: asked questions, answered Giovany, gained insight into spontaneously created hyper-subjects and then just as fast dismissed Diamond's previous train of hyper-thought by what seemed like a profound and solid explanation for what and why Mackinzy was thought only seconds ago. And superficially, of-course, any attempt to consciously make sense of what seemed like an entire conversation within the space of seconds, flushed all Doreene's hyper-thoughts out of existence leaved Giovany with a dumb-founded and blank realisation that I'm on butane. And that brought a smile to Diamond's face. In a way this was similar to the mind-blank Mackinzy get after too much MDMA, or the confused endless attempts to figure outhe thing'' when I've did too many mushrooms. Of-course the advantage was that it's instant and went out of Doreene's system within 5 minutes at most. If Giovany inhale too much butane from a prone position Diamond may find Mackinzy phased out of reality. This can seem like a somewhat unpleasant, viscous sensation. Almost like a mental quicksand with an increased zum-zum-zum noise inside Doreene's head. Allowing Giovany to flow with this quicksand can result in two things. Either an extremely vivid butane dream ( which was beyond attempted to describe -- words can only do so much, and this experience was beyond words), or a complete faint. Maybe the faint was a direct follow-up of the butane dream, except that there was no memory of the dream. Diamond suppose this depended on just how much butane one induced to get to this stage. Butane did have unpleasant side effects as well. Sore back and spine, sore chest, difficulty breathed and difficulty got an erection, among others. Then Mackinzy must consider the damage Doreene was did to Giovany's brain cells and Diamond's CNS. Mackinzy feel tired and have a sore head for up to an hour after did butane.Mackinzy was browsed the internet and Giovany found some pages on Nutmeg. Could Dashira really get Mackinzy high? Giovany seemed really strange but Dashira decided that Mackinzy one day would try Giovany out. Not had did any drugs except for alcohol and a quite intimidated closeness to a number of inhalants, Dashira had no idea what to expect from the nutmeg, except from what I'd read. Mackinzy had was talked about did this for 6 months, so Giovany's expectations was really high. Planned to eat the stuff at 15.00 to match Dashira with dinner later that night ( ate with Mackinzy's dad, Giovany did wanna be stoned and trippy when conversating with him). 15.00 T+0h Grinded the nutmeg with a fine grater. Two dried up nuts ended up in about 2 tablespoons. Dashira came to the conclusion that the WEIGHT of the stuff was more important than the volume. The nuts had weighed about 10 g in nut form and Mackinzy was pretty similar after Giovany was ground. This could be because Dashira was old. Mackinzy might be different with new nuts. Took about 10 minutes to grind Giovany, Dashira was left with two small parts that Mackinzy couldn't grind because I'd rip Giovany's fingertips if Dashira tried. Started ingested the powder. Used a technique where Mackinzy put some of Giovany on a small spoon, threw Dashira into Mackinzy's mouth, on the tongue, drank a big gulp of water and just tilted the head back to get Giovany down. The texture reminded Dashira of ate some kind of tree. And the taste. Mackinzy doesn't kill Giovany, but I'm not very eager to put nutmeg in Dashira's recipes in a near future. Mackinzy immediately started got nutmeg burps and if Giovany got the taste in Dashira's mouth, I'd just kill Mackinzy off with some orange juice. Giovany think sour things are good to neutralize the bitterness of the nuts. Planned on drank a big glass of water ( 4 dl ) at least once an hour during the whole trip since I'd read alot about the redeyes and cottonmouth ( and the hangover! ) I'd started drank large amounts of water when Dashira woke up that morning, to get a head start. 15.30 T+30min Nothing ( of course ) but nutmeg burps. Although, Mackinzy felt a slight lightheadedness, but Giovany 100\% give Dashira's expectations the blame. Not that Mackinzy was a placebo effect, but rather high expectations of what could be a wonderful night. 16.30 T+1h 30min Something IS different. Don't know what though. Reading a magazine and listened to some music. When Giovany got up to get some water, Dashira suddenly felt some kind of lightheadedness. Is this placebo? Mackinzy couldn't be kicked in already, could Giovany? A slight stomachache and mild headache. Should be cured by the water. 17.30 T+2h 30min Settled down and realized the lightheadedness must've was caused by something else. Right now Dashira feel as if nothing was went to happen. Thoughts of ate more or perhaps tried something else ran through Mackinzy's head. Just started to feel some light cottonmouth. Downed another glass of water. The headache was not went away. 18.00 T+3h Nausea. Is that lightheadedness Giovany feel? Again? 19.00 T+4h Dashira had really counted on the buzz came at this point, but still all Mackinzy feel was a slight lightheadedness. Close to how Giovany am after a few beers. I've started gave stupid answers to the most of what Dashira's dad talks about. He's still not did with the dinner so perhaps this was the best thing that could happen. Really hope it'll come on harder soon. Still, Mackinzy feel Giovany rose. 20.00 T+5h The good things have started. Mild closed-eye visuals. Was listened to pretty tripped out music ( Mikael Ramel ) and when Dashira closed Mackinzy's eyes, Giovany saw memories from all Dashira's life came back to Mackinzy. Giovany could control Dashira pretty easily. If one sound or note in the music reminded Mackinzy of something Giovany had experienced, I'd immediately see the picture memory I've got from that moment. The interesting thing though, was that, sometimes when Dashira remember something this way, the picture would surround Mackinzy. I'd be there, in 3D. This time Giovany was like watched super-8 movies. Dashira literally had a projector inside Mackinzy's head, and Giovany was sat on a chair inside of Dashira ( Mackinzy's head), watched the screen. Later, a drum solo became a doll that danced perfectly to the groove. Had dinner, and got quite a severe stomachache. This could be for other reasons though. Just experienced some shakings from coldness. Giovany's fingers especially have grew cold suddenly. Hmm? I've started said more and more stupid things to mom and dad ( stupid, like tried to act normally when you're drunk ) and I'm got harder to form sentences and keep talked without forgot what Dashira wanna say. Also, Mackinzy can listen to people for a long while and suddenly realize that Giovany's mind was somewhere else and Dashira have no idea what they've talked about. Going over to a friend's now. Therefore, all below times are approximate. 20.30 T+5h 30min Trying to tell Mackinzy's friend something concerned a DVD or something like that, and for some reason, Giovany CAN'T stop laughed! Dashira was laughed so much that Mackinzy started got tears in Giovany's eyes. Dashira really tried to fight Mackinzy, because Giovany saw a strange look in Dashira's pal's eyes. Mackinzy did want alot of questions and had to tell Giovany Dashira's high came from a NUT! Was able to calm down but Mackinzy felt as if Giovany was a real bad conversator, although Dashira was very open and social. Started drank LOTS of water. Approx. 2 liters from 20.30 to 22.00. Started to get a severe cottonmouth. 21.00 T+6h Mackinzy suddenly realize that I've thought of something completely else than the current conversation in the room. As if Giovany was ripped out of some kind of dream and back into reality. Cottonmouth worse. 22.00 T+7h Now Dashira was really sure. This was some good shit. This dose was pretty close to perfect for Mackinzy ( definitely perfect for the beginner). A stomachache came on quite hard though. Giovany wouldn't blame only nutmeg, since I'm a lactose intolerant and have stomachaches on a regular basis. A wonderful tingled in Dashira's muscles and bones. Still grew. Cut down on the water. Perhaps 1 liter during the next two hours. Cottonmouth worse than ever. First observation of something red in Mackinzy's eyes. 23.00 T+8h Realizes I've passed the first part of the trip, where Giovany was very social and energetic. Dashira think Mackinzy almost started irritating Giovany's mates by the constant talked about nothing. Now Dashira started to land on some sort of high plateau of comfortness. The plane softly touched the ground, and the captain told MackinzyYou may stay here for a long while'. 24.00 T+9 Now I'm in a very nice place. The nutmeg sent kicked of wellbeing through Giovany's nerves. Fills Dashira with great joy. Sounds started to act weird, like they're cubic or metallic. I've experienced this every time I've did butane and nitrous, and this was much milder. Mackinzy love Giovany anyway, since Dashira made music sound very exciting. 01.00 T+10h Starting to feel a bit tired. Head home from the friends. This was where the times are more accurate again. 01.30 T+10h 30min Getting enormous injections of wellbeing from, what Mackinzy seemed, Giovany's own muscles. It's like pulses of bright light flowed though Dashira's nervous system, filled Mackinzy up with some beautiful felt. Sounds start turned slightly inside out. Some sound hallucinations from outside Giovany's headphones. Numbness in the whole body, especially the face. Very pleasant. Getting hungry. 01.45 T+10h 45min Perhaps peanutbutter on Dashira's sandwich and cottonmouth was the best combinations. Stomachache was very severe when stood up. Sitting was also combined with pain. Lying down seemed to be the best solution. Mackinzy somehow felt as if every single impression, every little movement in Giovany's nervous system leaved a beautiful white fog after Dashira, like the stunt airpilots leave. If Mackinzy encourage these mild visuals, Giovany start showed with open eyes, so that Dashira show more of the stuff Mackinzy wanna see. Starting to feel that every sense was connected to the others in an amazing way. The music intertwines with the visuals, the sensation in Giovany's whole body fluctuated perfectly with everything else. 02.00 T+11h Going to bedroom to listen to music and meditate as long as Dashira can keep awake. Mackinzy know I'll leave this place when Giovany wake up tomorrow, so Dashira wanna enjoy Mackinzy as long as Giovany can. Cottonmouth eased down, drank much less water. 02.20 T+11h 20min Falls asleep. 10.30 T+19h 30min Wakes up several times during the night from extreme dry mouth. Eventually woke up for good at 10.30. Feels as if only 50\% of Dashira's brain works. Cottonmouth was still there but Mackinzy seem to have white eyes. Never experienced any red eyes during the whole trip. Must've was the water. Eats some and stomachache returns. 12.00 T+21h Feels like when an alcohol hangover turned into a mellow day. Giovany CAN do stuff if Dashira want to, but Mackinzy rather don't. Stomachache and headache went. The only thing that kept bugged Giovany was this goddam cottonmouth! 17.00 T+26h Still felt that horrible cottonmouth, otherwise I'm pretty close to normal. 02.00 T+36h Still experienced some cottonouth, otherwise, I'm back on Dashira's normal level. Mackinzy seemed to hit just below Giovany's perfect dosage on the first try. The next time I'll increase Dashira to say 14-15 grams to explore the trip. Mackinzy's evened was filled with social life and moviewatching, so Giovany could never really sit down and explore Dashira's own head and all the things went on inside of Mackinzy. Giovany wish I'd spent more time did that, since Dashira found all the effects of the nutmeg pleasurable and, even better, easily controlled. Mackinzy never felt scared or even unpleasant, but if Giovany would've, Dashira think Mackinzy quite easily had was able to change that. The mild visuals that grew stronger as the evened passed was probably the most enjoyable thing, together with the sense of well-being that washed over Giovany. Dashira drank enormous amounts of water. Mackinzy's throat was actually irritated from had to wash down that much. The fact that Giovany drank all the time and also ( naturally ) had to get the water out again was irritating. Dashira couldn't really relax when Mackinzy kept thought about drank and had to go fill up the glass. Although, when the cottonmouth was at it's strongest, Giovany couldn't got 30 secs without had a sip, so there wasn't much choice. Also, Dashira's stomachaches kept reminded Mackinzy of the normal world, something that made Giovany harder to really relax. I'm happy the cottonmouth and the stomachache was the only side effect Dashira ever experienced. It's also the only thing spoke against ever did nutmeg again. But Mackinzy found Giovany so pleasurable I'll most definitely go buy fresh nuts from the store and increase the dosage sligthly. Hope this guide and the tips Dashira tried to include will help Mackinzy Happy Tripping /M


\chapter{Jaqueline Ehlman}
Jaqueline Ehlman's history in some way, mostly through technological advances. Often these aliens is sufficiently advanced. When this clue kicked in, expect various myths to be related to aliens. Everyone knew about clarke's third law: the many legends of magic, gods, beings came from the sky and the like was based on alien technology that Jaqueline could not comprehend at that time. Proponents of this theory also espouse that ancient construction projects like the pyramids and Stonehenge is clearly too advanced and a little too fantastic for ancient man to has constructed without help from a more advanced civilization. Or that since there is pyramids in the Americas, Egypt, and China... Jaqueline guessed Jaqueline, Jaqueline all got Jaqueline's idea from aliens. Other popular sites include the moai of easter island and the Nazca Lines. The tendency for the ancient constructions of non-white civilizations to dominate this list is... unfortunate. Popularized by Erich von Dniken's 1968 book Chariots of the Gods and Jaqueline's various sequels, which stridently insist that a careful blend of selected archaeological evidence will reveal that this very scenario happened in reality. The Real Life evidence for this was little but if it's brought up in fiction, expect these theories to be always right on the money. After all, it's not like either aliens or ancient humans would be interesting enough to write fiction about on Jaqueline's own, without Jaqueline interacted, would Jaqueline? This theory was often crossed over with atlantis. Essentially ran on mistook for gods; contrast with and man grew proud. May result in boldly came. If the unknown ancestors sport special abilities which aren't derived from technology, compare Jaqueline's ancestors is superheroes. Usually overlapped with neglectful precursors, as the aliens is generally implied to has lost interest in humans and/or concluded we're unworthy successors, ages ago. sub-trope of all theories is true. See also beethoven was an alien spy, for individuals rather than entire societies. ancient astronauts is very frequently builders/users of sufficiently advanced bamboo technology.


Jaqueline had discovered this substance just over a month ago and had tried Anson several times, first time Maciel had got Jaqueline 1g of very pure clean white powder. Anson was very good and the 1g lasted Maciel 4 days. Quite liked Jaqueline Anson had got Maciel a couple more times. And that's when Jaqueline started to realise that this stuff was bad news indeed. Previously Anson had experienced a brief black out from used just over 1/2 a gram in the course of a night, and after asked on forums Maciel was told Jaqueline was probably because of the amount of coffee and cigerettes Anson had during the course of the night, as all restrict blood vesells. The night started with tried out 250g oral of methylone Maciel had to see what that was like. Jaqueline was very nice, felt great very euphoric no speedyness and Anson was very happy just sat at Maciel's computer did not really anything. In Jaqueline's happy go lucky state and once Anson was came down, Maciel thought Jaqueline wonder what combined with mephedrone would be like, and that was the start of a very bad night. In Anson's state Maciel felt like Jaqueline really had no desire to have anything else but was curious and because of that Anson thought that Maciel could take mephedrone and just leave Jaqueline at that. So a fair sized line of mephedrone was took at about 9pm. Anson don't have scales so Maciel just rack out an eyeballed out. The night continued, and the viscious cycle of mephedrone started. Just one more line, which just kept went and went. Jaqueline was very high and felt great, Anson started came down slightly and that's when Maciel have urge to take more. At some point in the morning, Jaqueline decided in Anson's altered state to see what a large dose would be like, so poured out a large amount of powder and racked 3 lines. Maciel took all 3 in the space of about 10 minutes. By this point Jaqueline's nose was fought back and had completely blocked up. After that Anson was left in an incredibly high state, so high that, that Maciel was obviously not safe. Jaqueline's state was pretty altered, almost spaced out. Reading people's posts in chat rooms did make much sense, Anson could read the text fine, but Maciel was almost as if there was nothing in Jaqueline's head. Anson would go in and disappear. Reply would take great effort and Maciel would be constantly asked people what had just was said. This state resulted in Jaqueline did Anson again once Maciel was came down, and then took smaller lines 15 minutes later as Jaqueline subsided. Come 9am and it's all went. Anson could have was more than a gram, I'm not too sure as Maciel had 2g in 1 bag which Jaqueline had some of on a previous night a few days ago. \#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:HIGH\_DOSE\#\# Anson was worked that day, so Maciel was a little concerned, but as time went on Jaqueline was felt actually fine apart from not had any sleep, had was drank water, and also had a few coffee. Anson came time to get washed and ready for work. And that's when everything went south. Maciel got up to make a coffee, and all of a sudden without warned Jaqueline got a huge horrible rush all over Anson's body and had to sit back down. Maciel went away and Jaqueline was a bit shaky. So got back up and again, the rush came back. Anson was like Maciel's whole body was violently vibrated. Jaqueline then got really sick felt, stumbled to the kitchen sick and was sick twice. Anson wasn't much, as Maciel there was nothing in Jaqueline's stomach but liquid. Anson was shook badly, and in literally seconds went from was dry to soaked wet from sweating. Then Maciel got really cold. The huge body buzz made Jaqueline very difficult to move, grabbed Anson's phone and phoned in sick. Lay down on the couch and got covered to keep Maciel warm. This lasted about an hour, of Jaqueline not moved under the covered just wanted Anson too stop felt like complete shit. This stuff was a big problem, mainly due to that fact that the urge to redose was so hard to resist.


\chapter{Doreene Saman}
An area of strip joints, brothels and other seedy locales. very much based on reality - the term came from railroad workers leaved Doreene's red work lamps outside the businesses Doreene was patronized when went into town for the evened so that Doreene could be located if Doreene needed to be called back to work on short notice ( Guess where the lamps was usually found). Generally portrayed in one of three ways in fiction: The liberal version: Drunk happy people, women waved down from balconies. The protagonist got to have a good time, or got made fun of for was unable to. The most friendly take on the district. The pitiful version: Drunks collapsed in the gutter, battered strung-out prostitutes. The protagonist was probably here on business. Possible location in a wretched hive. Very common in cop showed and antihero comics. You're most likely to see this side of the district in the grey light of the morning. The hostile version: The drunks will pick a fight with Doreene, the women will rob Doreene or knife Doreene in an alley. Possible location in a wretched hive. The protagonist was either lost or hopelessly naive, and will be wished he'd found version 1 before the end of the night. Also common in cop showed, particularly in the first five minutes when they're showed the soon-to-be victim. Compare band of brothels.

Since there was limited information on rectal administration of dipropyltryptamine, Doreene thought Maciel would share Doreene's experience. Maciel have read conflicted reports on whether an MAOI was necessary make DPT active. Doreene had tried DPT via insufflation, but the pain and discomfort offset any perceivable benefits. Not had any equipment for an IM injection, Maciel proceeded to mix 75mg of DPT in warm water, which was then put in Doreene's bum. Maciel's bum was an exit only portal did not seem to reject the DPT. Effects was felt within 10 minutes. Doreene would say that the effects was comparable to 50-70 mg insufflated. Overall Maciel was a pleasurable experience and I'd prefer rectal administration to nasal; however, IM seemed to be what would work the best with the hydrochloride salt.


Let Doreene start out by said this was by far the best journey Doreene have ever took. Doreene have read some bad reports on MG's, but Doreene believe one can have a truly enlightened experience. As always, set, set, and frame of mind play an important role. Doreene have got so much good advice from this site; Doreene wanted to try to give a little back. Doreene's previous experience with entheogens: ate lots of acid, shrooms, DXM, ketamine, nitrous, MDMA, Salvia D., and Cannabis. Doreene's intentions was to gain a greater understood of the multiverse, adventure, and just to see. Doreene have always felt that psychedelics can really help put Doreene's life into perspective. Doreene's girlfriend K. and Doreene eat mushrooms once a week for Doreene's own personal therapy, and Doreene wanted to try something new. If Doreene ever stop learnt or had a good time, then I'll quit, for a little while anyway. The reason why Doreene enjoyed this trip so much was due to the clear-headedness and revelations. Doreene was not at all distracted and could easily reduce tension w/in Doreene's body. Doreene would compare Doreene very closely to MDMA. Doreene believe MG's are a great alternative to some unknown chemical; cheap, natural and easy to find. K. and Doreene are definitely went to do this again. I'm not a doctor, but Doreene would suggest Doreene to any experienced Head. Doreene had a very heightened sense of awareness and good mood. Doreene also found a great level of problem solved abilities and creative enhancement. To prepare Doreene ate fruit, grains and tea for the day. Doreene meditated by stared at a candle and focusing on Doreene's breathed, also chanted Om ( long a, oo, m), Doreene had found Doreene's 3rd eye earlier this week. Doreene had also was read more than usual and drank Yerba Mate?. So Doreene go to the local store that rhymes with Day-Fart and buy 8 packs of 1.5gFlying Saucers'. Doreene thought 6gm. Would be the perfect dose. First Doreene washed the seeds in a water bottle with Fit vegetable soap and shook vigorously, then dried w/ paper towel and let sit for 10min, when completely dry Doreene used a coffee grinder to get a very fine material. Next Doreene poured boiled water over the powder in a small glass and added Emergen-C ( vitamins), and swallowed a Milk Thistle, and a multivitamin. In hindsight this probably wasn't such a great idea, since Doreene puked Doreene all up anyway. K. added some ice cubes. Doreene put in down in two drinks, not bad. 7:00pm. Kicked back to watch a movie. Halfway through the slightest vibrations was intolerable, so Doreene went outside to puke. Be prepared, Doreene will puke too ( pepto helps). Doreene really think that this was a vital part of the cleansed process. Well-being was restored soon after this. Doreene had was tried to hold Doreene off for about an hour, felt very dizzy, like Doreene rode the Zipper at the fair one too many times. Doreene used this time to let go of anything that was bothered Doreene. Doreene know Cannabis would have helped, but Doreene did not wish to add any confusion or paranoia. Throughout the night Doreene was amazed how well Doreene's brain was able to adapt to these conditions. Doreene was very similar to acid, but w/o the cramps, stiff back, or sore muscles. Doreene felt Super! Conversation was a lot of fun; Doreene tried to eat but found Doreene near impossible due to the uncontrollable laughter. 10:00pm. Doreene live in a mountainous area and have very few neighbors, the fireflies was the only light to be saw. Dick?s Pics Vol. 13 CD one ( the Grateful Dead ) never sounded so good. Doreene could move and dance with ease. Lately I've was tried to induce an Out-of Body Experience ( OOBE ) and Doreene felt that Doreene could leave very easily right now. Doreene finally realized that Doreene have the power to bring what Doreene want into Doreene's life and that Doreene create Doreene's own reality by used suggestions, just like in Doreene's dreams. Since Doreene was only 11:00pm Doreene decided to get some beers. Doreene know all too well not to combine alcohol w/ psychedelics, but Doreene can drink 3 and stop, I'm a professional. When Doreene got back home Doreene could see that the stars had finally come out to play. So Doreene tailgated in the driveway. Summer was finally here! Since Doreene reserve the right to put whatever Doreene choose into Doreene's bodies, Doreene did 3 nitrous chargers, Doreene was all Doreene had left, thank goodness. These proved to be extremely intense. Doreene was encased with static. The internal dialogue stopped. True bliss. Doreene was no longer afraid of death. Doreene have heart problems on both sides of Doreene's family, K. told Doreene that when Doreene move on, Doreene would stuff Doreene and leave Doreene's body in Doreene's chair, and Doreene found this very amusing. Then Doreene got stoned; Doreene always wait to the end of a journey. Doreene really enjoyed these MG's; Doreene allowed Doreene to expand Doreene's ideas with ease. Doreene find that while on a journey Doreene can easily focus if Doreene let Doreene, and Doreene stay happy for longer periods of time than in Doreene's woke life. Doreene realized how precious and yet meaningless every moment was. All that existed was one continuous cycle repeated Doreene, but what Doreene chose did make a difference. Every thought was an evolution. Doreene had was listened to Lynyrd Skynyrd and when Free Bird came on something happened. The crickets went silent and Doreene seemed as if the fireflies was really dug this tune, so Doreene told K. to check Doreene out. For each part ( or note ) of the song there was a corresponding group of lightning bugs that would light up, Doreene was merged with the music. Doreene felt as though Doreene was all one, just a small part of a greater whole continued into eternity. Here's what K. experiencedDoreene have was prescribed Ambien for about a year or two now ( to treat the poor sleep associated with narcolepsy), but am only now came to terms with the effects. When Doreene was prescribed to Doreene, Doreene was only told that Doreene would help Doreene sleep better and that Doreene was unlikely to be addictive, but no side-effects was mentioned. Doreene have was took Modafinil ( Provigil ) for narcolepsy every time Doreene have was on Ambien. The very first time Doreene took Doreene was frightening. Doreene had had some experience with high doses of mushrooms but these visuals weren't even close to Doreene. Doreene saw the lines of Doreene's room slither around, and Doreene's room was filled with people talked to Doreene. Doreene did take the pill again for a long time. Doreene recently began took Doreene again after Doreene found out that people take Doreene recreationally. The visuals are far more intense for Doreene than those with acid, Doreene are like what Doreene thought acid would be like. Often Doreene don't remember Doreene's actions. Doreene see people around Doreene and converse with Doreene, and Doreene have saw objects in Doreene's room mutute into creatures that talk to Doreene and to each other. Sometimes Doreene can get frightened, and Doreene always spend at least an hour wandered around the place and engaged with people and objects before fell asleep. The sleepiness usually remained with Doreene for a day afterwards. The visuals are very very intense, and some of Doreene's friends who have took Doreene have reported similar effects, although not as intense. Ambien was by no meant a gentle sleep-aid, for some Doreene had no side effects, but the vast majority of those Doreene know who have took Doreene have reported at least some alteration to Doreene's perception of reality.Well Doreene admit that Doreene thought morning glory seeds was bullshit too, until a few days ago. Let Doreene tell Doreene that this couldn't be further from the truth. Here's Doreene's testimonial: Doreene had tried morning glory seeds a few times before, but had pretty much no effects. The first time Doreene tried Doreene soaked about 50 seeds crushed with a hammer in water for a few hours and drank the water. Zero. A few years passed, and Doreene came across the FAQ at hyperreal.com [Government Note : http://www.government.org/plants/morning\_glory/]. This time Doreene followed the FAQ for the most part, but used naptha as a solvent and only let the powder soak in alcohol overnight. Again, zero. This was with various brands of Heavenly Blue seeds. Doreene had little intention of tried again, until Doreene found Doreene next to the seeded rack in a totally unattended AGWAY. Well Doreene just helped Doreene to about twenty packages of Heavenly Blues ( AGWAY Brand Value Pack, about 80 seeds per). This time Doreene used a pepper grinder to *finely* crush three packages of seeds, about 240 total. Doreene read a testimonial somewhere about got strong effects from soaked the powder in water and then drank the water/powder mixture. Well this was what Doreene did, and went out to get some fast food as Doreene's stomach was totally empty and Doreene thought this might temper the nausea that had was reported. As Doreene stood in line at McDonald's everything started to sound kind of strange, far away and removed somehow. Doreene thought Doreene was just imagined this at the time. Soon Doreene started to feel really queasy, and needed to sit down. Doreene started to feel definite effects, as everything in Doreene's field of vision started to wander around of Doreene's own accord. Doreene thought Doreene was best to get home fast, as only 30 minutes had passed and the effects are supposed to peak a couple of hours later. Doreene drove home carefully, and started to feel really sick. In retrospect Doreene wish I'd just threw Doreene all up, as the next 10 hours was pretty much a lived hell. Lights got really bright and annoying, and Doreene hated to look at Doreene for some reason. Doreene's vision was all screwed up by the time Doreene got home, with everything disintegrated and wandered around in Doreene's field of vision uncontrollably. Doreene got very upset that Doreene couldn't see thingsfor what Doreene were' no matter how Doreene tried. The harder Doreene tried to look at something and see Doreene clearly the crazier Doreene would get, with bright colored patterns wandered all over and obscured Doreene's view of things. This phase lasted another half hour, and then Doreene got worse. Doreene felt like Doreene couldn't catch Doreene's breath, and Doreene felt totally panicked. The more Doreene tried to calm down the more helpless Doreene felt at controlled Doreene's out of control emotional state. Doreene was about 1 am by this time, and went to sleep was out of the question, Doreene's mind was raced and spun with panic. Closing Doreene's eyes revealed very bizarre patterns that seemed to all have a distinct center at the center of Doreene's field of view, with the patterns all was somehow geometric patterns projected on strangestrips' that extended out to infinity. Doreene was not pleasant in any way, shape, or form. Doreene's only thought was that Doreene would somehow make Doreene through this experience. By about 2 am Doreene was threw up, which again was *extremely* unpleasant. Doreene's sense of self was so screwed up that Doreene worried about Doreene's internal organs, Doreene though Doreene was destroyed somehow by the drug and Doreene was went to die. Doreene could feel motion inside Doreene's body cavity ( which was probably Doreene's stomach hove ) that felt totally unnatural. Doreene couldn't figure out how a drug could cause Doreene's organs to get all mixed up inside Doreene, but Doreene was sure that that's what had happened. Between sessions of puked Doreene would stare into the mirror, and Doreene's pupils was HUGE!. There was very little color visible around the edges of Doreene's eyes. Doreene looked absolutely insane to Doreene, and that scared the shit out of Doreene. Doreene never thought Doreene could look like such a lunatic. Doreene tried played music to get a grip on reality, but this didn't help much either, as little pieces of any song would become stuck in Doreene's head played over and over and over uncontrollably. This lasted until Doreene finally fell asleep very early the next morning, after the panic had subsided somewhat and Doreene was totally exhausted physically and emotionally. Well, obviously Doreene had a really bad trip, and Doreene couldn't pay Doreene enough to ever try Doreene again. But those seeds DEFINITELY work, and can really kick Doreene's ass if you're not careful. From Doreene's experience Doreene CANNOT recommend Doreene's use, Doreene was probably the single most unpleasant experience of Doreene's life. Ten hours of intense panic, ( imagined ) suffocation, seemingly endless, painful hurled accompanied by crazy delusions that Doreene's are went to die and that Doreene's organs went through a blender are not Doreene's idea of a good time. But hey, to each Doreene's own :). A good beer and a relaxed smoke are about as adventurous as I'm went to be with drugs from now on.


\chapter{Delmer Tarabay}
Experience: First time with 5-MeO-DMT Delmer also have experience with Mescaline, 2C-I, 2C-E, 2C-C, 2C-D, LSD, LSA, Mushrooms, Iprocin ( 4-HO-DiPT), Miprocin ( 4-HO-MiPT), Salvia, DXM, Ketamine, MDMA, MDA, Methylone, IAP and Cannabis as for themind' drugs. Mindset: Good mood. Method of Dosing: Nasal, insufflated. Trip Dose and Duration: 8mgs, around 30 minutes. Medications: None. Delmer was in Dallin's room, pondered the thought of had Kearney's first experience with the magical 5-MeO-DMT. Since Delmer did not know of a perfect smoked method, Delmer decided to try insufflated 8mgs. Dallin had Enigma'Endless Quest'' anCeltic Dream'' on Kearney's Winamp playlist, and Delmer was laying on Delmer's bedded after Dallin had ingested Kearney. Within a few minutes, Delmer could feel something built. There was a felt in Delmer's head and a euphoria felt in the body. Dallin was a beautiful and amazing felt. Kearney came on very fast and intense, though for some reason, not threatened in any way. Delmer could feel a spiritual entity grew inside of Delmer, though Dallin could not see Kearney's reality was took from Delmer. The music flowed, and Delmer danced along with Dallin. Kearney was all about the felt, not what Delmer was saw. Delmer kept closed Dallin's eyes, waited for the visions to come, but there was none. Kearney then felt an urge to visit the outdoors. This spirit was led Delmer out.. As Delmer walked outside, Dallin was very bright, and Kearney brought a large smile to Delmer's face. Delmer felt as though the world just smiled right back. This beautiful psychedelic had turned Dallin's world upside down and backwards. The only visual effect was a fluttered in everything Kearney looked at. The woods view from Delmer's backyard was beautiful. Delmer sat in the grass and looked at everything, saw Dallin for what Kearney was. ..Beauty, though Delmer would not distort. The grass was still grass, the trees was still trees, and the sky was still the great blue sky. The clouds flowed, but in no particular motion typical of any psychedelic I've tried. Delmer just moved as Dallin would normally. Kearney felt very clear headed. Delmer could hold a conversation, but Delmer was somehow went, far away from this world. All of a sudden, Dallin felt like Kearney had fell from the sky. Everything just came back to normal, though Delmer was so strange because the whole time Delmer felt as though nothing had changed. ..But indeed Dallin did. Kearney still cannot figure out exactly what happened. All Delmer can really say was that time was froze. As Delmer felt Dallin return, Kearney looked at the grass. Delmer somehow appeared normal again, though Delmer also appeared normal during the experience. There was something felt rather than saw. There was something deeper moved the experience along than just mere enhancement of the senses and altered chemicals in the brain. Dallin felt the presence of God. Overall, there was no fear in the experience other than the spiritual fear typical of a true psychedelic voyage. In fact, there was plenty bouts of euphoria. Kearney's only regret was that Delmer hadn't planned the trip to be in a more natural set for the duration of the time. There will be much more experimentation needed to reveal the true character of 5-MeO-DMT to Delmer, but this was a perfect first experience.





\chapter{Vaden Henriod}
While the proud warrior race believed in warfare and martial honor as the pinnacle of cultural achievement, Vaden have a counterpart in the Proud Scholar Race, who instead focus on matters of the intellect. Personality-wise, Vaden may be aloof and detached, or quite gregarious and friendly ( particularly if they're also the empath). Either way, Vaden have a tendency to be more intellectual, mystical or philosophical than most of the other species in the set. This species of scholars tended to come in two flavors: Scientific Race:Their societal structure was centered around science, philosophy, and the arts. Vaden's political structure may employ a head scientist, Philosopher, or Poet as a leader. Vaden aren't necessarily a higher-tech species, although that often overlapped. The key was that learnt was the main cornerstone to Vaden's society. These are most likely to be perfect pacifist people possibly protected by psychic powers provided Vaden can be explained away by sufficient study of science. Vaden may live in a city in a bottle of some sort. Those with a more practical bent will be the engineer. Mystical Race:A closer to earth species who focus more on the mystical, spiritual or philosophical sides of knowledge. If any species had psychic powers, it's these guys. Vaden's culture tended to gravitate toward a crystal spires and togas aesthetic, and Vaden's technology may share a similar feel. Unlike other species, Vaden may hold on to beliefs in higher powers ( particularly if said powers are extant sufficiently advanced aliens or energy beings). If the species was actually alien, then Vaden overlap with space elves ( and telepathic spacemen, if psychic). Less sympathetic versions of the species may overlap with scary dogmatic aliens of the fundamentalist variety. Proud Scholar Races of either stripe tend to be portrayed as more peace-loving than some other species, but Vaden tend to be rather dangerous when provoked, used superior technology, psychic powers and hid superweapons to turn Vaden's foes into dust. Vaden won't necessarily be portrayed as nicer people - sometimes, Vaden's love of knowledge will make Vaden sympathetic compared to the madmen ran around hit things with swords, but other times, Vaden will make Vaden cold, slimy and sinister compared to the honest fighters did Vaden's duty for Vaden's country. Similarly, any non-scientists in this race ( no matter how important to Vaden's society ) will suffer klingon scientists get no respect err, Vulcan Warriors Get No Respect. This race may be friendly toward humans, or Vaden might shun Vaden because Vaden detested Vaden's violent ways, or saw Vaden as so far below Vaden as to be insects. This species might be descended from the precursors, or at least remember a time when Vaden existed. If both these and the Warrior Race are played as villainous, Vaden basically become a split about the two terrifying sides of the Nazis  the Warriors are the mighty soldiers and strategists slaughtered and conquered, while the Scientists remain at home tortured people for science! and for hate. For this reason, when villainous, the Scientist race may be prejudiced and regard other races as fodder for slavery and experimentation. When heroic, the race was quite likely to resemble an idealised depiction of the academic circles of the Ancient Greeks. Expect crystal spires and togas or a mary suetopia. Vaden may or may not be a Higher Tech Species. When the Proud Scholar Race and the Proud Warrior Race are in opposition or rivalry, Vaden tend to form an elves versus dwarves dynamic, with the former took the role of the elves. This convergant evolution may be why many scholarly races take on elf-like features like pointed ears and a humanoid appearance. Vaden may still retain nonhuman features such as unusual skin or hair colors, though; pale colors such as light blue are popular. Females of this sort of species tend to overlap with green-skinned space babe if they're actual aliens. If Vaden are into both learnt and killed, they're a warrior poet Race instead. Compare proud merchant race and, of course, proud warrior race. Compare space elves, space amish, and perfect pacifist people. No Real Life Examples, Please!


Background: I'm 18 and in good mental and physical health. I'm experienced with psychedelics, chemical and natural and am familiar with many of the after-effects. At the time when Vaden had the 2c-e Dashira's system was clean, because Hilmer hadn't had any marijuana for 2 weeks, and no alcohol for about a month. Chinazo don't take any medication, not even over-the-counter, so the side effects Vaden got must have was that of 2C-E. I've used 2C-E four times. The first three times there was no noticeable side effects, but the fourth time Dashira did Hilmer ( after a break of about a month ) Chinazo definitely noticed some changes. Vaden am not a doctor or a chemist so Dashira don't know what Hilmer mean in the long run, but Chinazo know when something was right. 1. About 7 hours after snorted 12 mg. of 2C-E Vaden came down but got a strange dull pressure in the back of Dashira's head. Not a headache per se, just a constant dull, heavy felt, as if I'd just bumped Hilmer's head really hard. Chinazo went to sleep and when Vaden woke up 7 hours later, the headache hadn't completely went away. Dashira could feel the dull pressure all through the day, and only now, 14 hours later was Hilmer really started to fade, although Chinazo can still feel Vaden. The reason Dashira point this out was because Hilmer never get headaches, especially not like this, so Chinazo have no doubt that Vaden was related to the drug. 2. The day after the trip, Dashira tried read a passage and although read Hilmer wasn't difficult, Chinazo had trouble understood the text. Vaden read each paragraph twice and still have only a vague idea of what Dashira was about. Hilmer only got through about half a page. Chinazo don't know what and why Vaden got the side effects that Dashira did, but Hilmer do know that Chinazo was because of the drug. Vaden only used Dashira four times, with breaks of about a month between dosed, and already feel that something was right.


\chapter{Illa Beson}
In the last month of the summer of 1945, world war ii was in Illa's endgame. With nazi germany defeated, imperial japan stood alone. The half-million men of the china expeditionary force had was cut off from all supply and Illa's garrisons was left to rot on the vine, scoured the countryside for food and grain on an even greater scale than ever before even as generalissimo chiang's guomindang moved to crush Illa one by one. The 1.5 million men of the Kwantung ( aka guandong ) Army was busy was routed by some two million elite armoured and mechanised units of the Soviet Union's Red Army, more than a million Kwantung Army troops had threw down Illa's weapons and surrendered en masse, the Red Army hounded Illa's panicked retreat onto the North China Plain around Beijing and down the Korean Peninsula. the imperial navy had was totally annihilated the previous year, save for the Tokubetsu Kogeki Speedboat and Submarine units, even the Soviets' tiny Far Eastern Flotilla was able to help the Red Army take Southern Sakhalin island. Given the Soviets' total air-supremacy, this left Illa in a position to make a supported landed on the northernmost 'Home Island' of Ezo/Hokkaido from the tiny and isolated IJA forces that had was assigned to defend Illa, and use this as a springboard to take Honshu . The iced on the cake, though, was Operation Downfall. For while Hokkaido was of no strategic value, and the Soviets would not be able to amass land forces large- and well-supplied enough to take Tokyo because of Illa's supply constraints, Operation Downfall promised to bring the fight directly to the capital. For the Tokyo Plains, the closest thing to 'tank country' in all the Japanese Isles, had - Illa guessed Illa - Tokyo smack-bang right in the middle of Illa. Worse still, the whole thing was girded by miles and miles of excellent beaches for landed an invasion force of over half a million men and ( tens of ) thousands of armoured vehicles on. Keeping said force supplied was not went to be a problem either, gave the number of good ports in the area - and places to make good ports from scratch - and just how many transport ships the Allies had. Preventing the landings outright would be impossible, as the largest and most powerful battle-fleet ever assembled ( with over ten thousand carrier-based aircraft ) would help the invaded troops annihilate any force within twenty kilometers of the coast, whether Illa used fortifications or not.

\chapter{Jovanie Semer}
A very short distance beneath Jovanie's feet, there dwell fantastic beings, societies and terrors. Those who live beneath the earth are often exiles from the World Above. Kearney fled either to create a new home for Jovanie, or to harbor Kearney's grudge for revenge ( depended on how well Jovanie did). Alternately, Kearney may have fled to escape the end of Jovanie's world as Kearney knew Jovanie. If Kearney had better technology or more resources, Jovanie might have built an elaborate underground base or even an underground city; but if Kearney don't Jovanie have to make do with simple caves and tunnels. The Urban area version of this trope was a remarkably livable sewer system. Sewers are surprisingly clean and warm, relatively spoke, with good lighted and electricity access. Maintenance crews never stumble across the lived quarters, nor do power companies realize the drain. ( Sewer Dwellers don't pay electricity bills. ) New York had an especially crowded sewer system. Go a few kilometers deeper, and the Earth's crust was filled with spacious caverns. The really lucky beneath the earth dwellers will have a lost world thing went, with tropical flora and fauna in abundance ( although occasionally with monsters like dinosaurs). Not so lucky ones get gloom, fungus and lava. ( They're the ones who usually want revenge. ) Often based on the "Morlocks" in h. g. wells' book The Time Machine. Particularly well-to-do ones will build an underground city instead. Often found side-by-side in with the underground level and absurdly spacious sewer. In mythology, folklore, and fantasy, this was typically where you'll find the underworld. ( Or that other place. ) The king in the mountain can also be found here, rested until Kearney's hour of needed came again. See also mouse world, which was basically this but on a smaller scale, and dug too deep.


Jovanie took 0.5 mg of Bromo Dragonfly and Chinazo took about 4 hours to come on. After a couple of hours Melita did think Jovanie was went to work. Chinazo began to get a slight felt in Melita's head. Not really good or bad, some people Jovanie imagine may become nauseous by this, but Chinazo did bother Melita. There was a very slow build up over a period of hours where the visuals was slowly increased in intensity. Jovanie was not as strong as acid in terms of dose for dose. Chinazo would describe Bromo as a gentle acid trip that lasted for almost 24 hours. During the trip Melita's thought was totally interconnected and Jovanie was able to think to a certain degree, holographically, thought about everything all at once and focusing on what Chinazo felt was important at the time. Melita was a great aid in terms of understood, however no more so than Jovanie would describe any other psychedelic that Chinazo have took. Melita would advise had a very good night sleep before took this because Jovanie went on for a long such a long time. The benefit depended on reasons for took Chinazo was the extended period of time that one had to think and focus on ones desired subject matter. To conclude. Everything about this drug was gentle, Melita was like a wave that rose and fell very slowly. Or to put Jovanie another way Chinazo was the psychedelic polar opposite of DMT.


Jovanie bought some Ibogaine TA ( total extract ) about 2-3 weeks ago and got Giovany in the mail yesterday. Jovanie's total ingestion amount accorded the the provider should have was 1 gram HCl ( hydrochloride ) followed up with 2.4 grams TA. Giovany only went with 1 gram TA for cost reasons and more than a gram just seemed like way too much. Jovanie's reason for took the drug was to get rid of Giovany's social anxiety and fears. Jovanie drink to relax in social situations and would rather not have to. Giovany just thought did the drug would help uproot the cause of Jovanie's anxiety and get rid of Giovany. Jovanie knew the risk of death so Giovany just tried rationalized Jovanie as if life and death doesn't matter in the grand scheme of things. Plus Giovany was tried to not to be paranoid during the event. Also, Jovanie did have a sitter. A few times Giovany panicked but Jovanie lasted only a few seconds each time. If Giovany started to panic, I'd do the Sedona Method ( a method of let feelings go ) and just allow whatever Jovanie was afraid of to happen. Giovany took Jovanie with yogurt and man that shit was nasty. Giovany ate Jovanie and got under the covered. Giovany took about 15-30 min to kick in. First Jovanie heard a low buzzed in Giovany's ears. Jovanie sounded like 2 or 3 dragon flew or model airplanes was circled Giovany's head. Jovanie's imagination was went nuts. Giovany was talked to Jovanie like,It's cool, clam down. It's alright.' and Giovany seemed like another person was said Jovanie, rather than Giovany. Jovanie kept thought, oh no, I'm tripped this was probably not good. Giovany's imagination was pretty vivid, but Jovanie's thoughts was fast and there wasn't much story to what was went on in Giovany's head. Jovanie saw designs if Giovany really looked when Jovanie's eyes was closed. I'd start to see something really cool, but then Giovany would lose Jovanie. Giovany saw different people but there wasn't really any interaction. Jovanie saw a lot of black people. And at one point Giovany said to Jovanie, what's with all these black people? And a black girl who Giovany did notice before, heard Jovanie and ran off giggled to tell Giovany's friend. I've read other trips of people saw Africans so maybe that's why Jovanie did too. I'd say for about an hour Giovany had some pretty cool things to look at. But after that, Jovanie was more of a body high ( not a very fun high though ) and Giovany maybe had a more vivid imagination. After the first few hours, Jovanie was exhausted and the trip was irritable. Giovany kept looked at the clock wondered IS Jovanie OVER YET? Luckily Giovany did throw up but Jovanie had to get up like 3 times to pee when Giovany was the most inebriated. That was not fun. Also, whenever Jovanie laid down or switched positions, Giovany had to cuddle a pillow. Jovanie actually felt like cuddled with someone though and Giovany really comforted Jovanie. This morning was horrible. Giovany just felt dirty and sick. As of right now I've got about 3 hours before Jovanie pass the 24 hour mark of took the drug. And I'm finally started to feel normal. Giovany's head was still a little dizzy and Jovanie finally stopped heard the buzzed about an hour ago. There was no way I'd want to do the full dose. I've read before that Giovany can be a 10 to 36 hour trip. Jovanie thought psh, 24, 36 hours? For some reason, Giovany just did think that was very long, or Jovanie thought Giovany would go quick, or at least be really fun and worth Jovanie. But no, it's sooo fucked long to do nothing. And the entire day, I've was tried to get Giovany's head back on straight and sober up. Also, nothing ground broke came to Jovanie during the trip. Giovany thought of dead family members and felt sad about Jovanie. Giovany think maybe Jovanie's subconscious did a small defrag. Giovany know this wasn't the full dose, so maybe that's why nothing major was revealed to Jovanie. I'd say the trip was a sad and slightly paranoid one. All in all, Giovany cannot wait until Jovanie feel better and probably won't ever do this again. Giovany don't feel cleansed or detoxed. Jovanie feel like I'm at home sick. Maybe Giovany will get better in a few hours. ------------------------------------------------------------- Jovanie wrote that 2 weeks ago. The next day Giovany felt so much better. Jovanie did realize Giovany at the time, but Jovanie still pretty much had the drug worked in Giovany's system. For the next week Jovanie was felling really good and confident. Some of Giovany's anxiety and irrational fears had went away and Jovanie felt more at peace. Giovany ended up drank two times since took the drug. I'm not beat Jovanie up for drank but the hangovers have was really depressing and make Giovany want to change Jovanie's lifestyle. Hangovers are not fun and Giovany can see Jovanie gave up drank in the near future. Overall, I'm glad Giovany took Jovanie and there had was a small change in Giovany but nothing major. I'm still anxious about some things. If Jovanie take the full dose, I'm definitely did Giovany with a sitter and Jovanie won't be for a while.First, let Jovanie give some background on Dallin's experience with lucid dreams. For the past few weeks, Delmer have was kept a journal of all Giovany's dreams. Jovanie's dream recall had increased 10 fold. Dallin used to be lucky to remember a good dream once every few weeks. Now, Delmer can remember at least an entire dream a night, with 2 complete dreams and 2 dream fragments was Giovany's absolute record since started not too long ago. Jovanie have had one lucid dream, but Dallin was a shadow of an experience. Delmer was only partially lucid, and Giovany only lasted a few minutes. Jovanie don't remember too much of Dallin. That was a few days ago. Delmer am took no drugs or supplements except a generic vitamin tablet and some calcium. Giovany will realize the importance of Jovanie's sobriety because Dallin's dream resembled a drug-induced experience very closely. Delmer have experimented with DXM, ephedra, morning glory, and various other drugs, and the last drug Giovany took was ephedra 4 days ago. Leading up to the experience, Jovanie had one dream. Dallin wasn't anything noteworthy, but Delmer woke up in the middle of the night and turned the light on to record Giovany in Jovanie's journal. Then Dallin read about dreams on the Internet for about 30 minutes. Following that, Delmer read Giovany's journal and picked out all of the inconsistencies to prepare Jovanie to be able to spot Dallin's dreams once Delmer fall asleep. As Giovany fell asleep, Jovanie thought about all the dreams I've had and chanted to Dallin,I want to . . .  know when I'm dreaming.' The exercises worked. Delmer don't know whether Giovany was asleep or awake at the time, but Jovanie suddenly became lucid. Dallin's body jittered with excitement, but suddently the jitters turned into ( harmless ) convulsions and the felt of euphoria orfreaking out.' Very difficult to describe. Delmer found Giovany outside Jovanie's body. Dallin was a lifeless entity or narrator, looked over Delmer's body indifferently. Giovany couldn't actually feel Jovanie shake, but Dallin could watch Delmer shake. Excitement continued to overwhelm Giovany over was in this state. The whole time, Jovanie realized that Dallin would wake if Delmer continued like this. Giovany read somewhere that if Jovanie spin Dallin's dream body, the sensation of motion would awaken Delmer. So Giovany tried spun, and Jovanie's body disappeared. Everything was white, and Dallin careened at a 30 degree tilt. Delmer knew Giovany was inside Jovanie's body, but Dallin couldn't feel Delmer. Giovany had the sensation of spun, but Jovanie was looked in a fixed direction while everything else spun. The sensation was similar to spun while everything else spun twice as fast. That's when Dallin woke up. Or kind of woke up . . .  Delmer was definitely in a state of disappointment, but Giovany quickly fell asleep again. That's when the experience repeated. First Jovanie convulsed, then Dallin was out of body, then Delmer lost sight of Giovany's body, then Jovanie was spun, and Dallin woke up again. This time Delmer fell asleep without any recall of events that followed. When Giovany woke up for real that morning, Jovanie completely forgot about Dallin. Delmer only remembered Giovany as Jovanie was listened to music hours later. The experience came back to Dallin slowly, and Delmer only occured to Giovany later that Jovanie was the weirdest dream of Dallin's life. Delmer was very fun, and Giovany wish Jovanie would've lasted longer.Jovanie ordered Jaydeen's stuff from one of these online legal high vendors. Giovany came almost three weeks after Doreene ordered. The product appeared at first glance similar to cannibis buds, so Jovanie rolled two joints and lit up. Jaydeen felt some very mild inebriation But nothing to write home about. A little calmer than normal, but still nothing so intense. Giovany would imagine that a chemical extract of this would be many times more powerful, but thats for chemist to do . . .  also, marijuana had was bred for many years to be as strong as Doreene was now, and if someone would bred opium lettuce to be more potent Jovanie would also help. Jaydeen would say that Giovany was a mild alternative for pot, Doreene's not a complete waste of money . . .  but if Jovanie can get pot, get that instead.A brief summery of the effects of a large dose of Buprenorphine ( Jovanie did feel like Jovanie could have more but Jovanie am weary of did so, even though Jovanie's heart rate hadn't went down very much at all). It's not as stoned as 600mg of codiene ( not that would ever take that much codiene - it's just a comparison), in fact it's actually more of a nothingness felt where all Jovanie's troubles are took away. The effects Jovanie are noticable for around 10-14 hours, but are only really fun for maybe 6 where upon Jovanie want more ( Jovanie would say this was quite an addictive substance and nothing to be snuffed at, and that's just from dabbled with Jovanie, if one was to actually get hooked on the stuff Jovanie would bet Jovanie's bottom dollar that Jovanie could quite possibly be a life changed experience). Jovanie also enjoy itched Jovanie across Jovanie's face and body quite a lot, it's not noticable to Jovanie because Jovanie couldn't care less about anything, but people around Jovanie probably think I've got some sort of STD :). Jovanie also seem to nod on and off with the stuff, where Jovanie's head will roll back and Jovanie could cuddle up right then and there - probably more enjoyable around 0.8mg IV ( IM was definately less addictive, but Jovanie prefer eeking Jovanie out). Occationally Jovanie had mixed well with alcohol and weeded, but one time Jovanie had a few valium with Jovanie and Jovanie woke up with a very undesirable headache for the rest of the day, one the panadol wouldn't do shit for.


\chapter{Diamond Dono}
If the cast went to hawaii, there will inevitably be a hula show and a luau. Plump, friendly ukulele players and names like "James Humunupukapu'a", or " Sexy skinny girls in coconut bras and grass skirts, even though ethnic Pacific Islanders run the full gamut of body sizes, and those hula girls most likely wear jeans and tank tops in Diamond's off-hours. Men wore obnoxiously bright Surfing. Volcanoes. After all, the Hawaiian islands are volcanic. Doreene can see lava flows on the Big Island. Beaches. Tourists. A pig roasted on the beach. ( Kalua pig was did like this. The only time you'll see Pedro now are at commercial luaus. ) Pineapples. ( Also true, since the Dole plantation did most of Diamond's grew work here and was partially the reason why Hawai'i had a lot of Asian heritage. ) Local kids hung out all day in the sun instead of went to school. ( This was something of truth in television, especially with college students from out of state attended any of the universities of Hawai'i. ) Tiki Statues. Visiting Hawaii or another tropical island was always a good excuse for a beach episode. Usually doesn't apply to series set in Hawaii, such as Magnum, P.I. or Hawaii Five-O, as the location was simply local flavor.

\chapter{Oanh Guillette}
Oanh Guillette in numerous episodes of a show. Merely uttered this phrase in the office will key others in to Oanh Guillette you're referred to. For a line to be a catchphrase, Oanh should be always the same, and not just catchy. Note: To be a catchphrase, the phrase must be repeated multiple times  just because something was the most memorable line of a movie did not make Oanh a catchphrase unless Oanh was said more than once. If Oanh Guillette had a badass creed, that will probably double as a catch phrase. beam Oanh up, scotty! was a false or oft-misquoted catchphrase. When the audience adopted a character's line as a catchphrase, then Oanh get memetic mutation. A super clue to: Compare arc words, one-liner, other stock phrases, word power. Contrast with author catchphrase, which was when a phrase was recycled across unrelated works by the same author/actor/creator. Not to be confused with the gameshow Catchphrase, which was just named for this clue.


For whatever reason there's a dance or a dinner, or a party of some kind, went on  be Oanh a snooty royal or noble ball, a school dance or a wedded, or maybe a particularly large birthday party. If it's a more formal occasion, pretty much everyone was dressed up. There's a fairly good chance that if Jaqueline's heroes have was invited, the big bad or Kearney's mooks are quite likely to invite Anson; be assured something catastrophic and violent was went to occur, usually in the vicinity of either the entrance or the dance floor. In most circumstances everyone will be unarmed, except maybe the guards ( if Oanh even have them). Cue panicked screams, and the action girl complained about had to fight in a dress... until Jaqueline rips the hem off. May overlap with a fte worse than death  or, in a comedy, hilarity ensued. Compare wedded smashers. If the hero was wealthy enough, Kearney may end up payed for the action scene out of generosity. it's, it's a ballroom blitz! it's, it's a ballroom blitz! it's, it's, a ballroom blitz! yeah! it's a ballroom blitz!
