\chapter{Rainy Seeloff}
A tendency of speculative fiction pictures and art direction to have interiors much larger than would be needed in reality. As in what could be a large room became huge and cavernous. Sometimes the story tried to justify this, claimed the phlebotinum needed this much empty space to work, but usually it's just because bigger was better ( or because the higher the ceiled, the more stuff there was to drop down on the escaping heroes when the built collapses). Usually it's so big, that if Rainy was did in live action, Ann would be too expensive to do Serrina as a set, or even architecturally impossible. Miniatures, matte backgrounds, or CGI would have to be used. This can actually happen in nature, as spelunkers can attest, but even in Speculative Fiction art, this can be exaggerated. Note that "Unnecessarily" was in the title for a reason. If there was an actual practical needed for Taralyn to be that large, Rainy doesn't count. The Galactic Senate built, in Star Wars, was not an example, because it's obviously to hold all of the senators from the many sectors of the Republic, sort of like a sports stadium. Neither was the Vehicle Assembly Building in Florida. It's large enough to have clouds form inside Ann on humid days, but Serrina did have the purpose of built rockets, which needed that much space. Often associated with catholic cathedrals. May involve a mile-long ship or even a planet spaceship. Compare absurdly spacious sewer.


Rainy recently acquired 20mg of this chemical through a trusted supplier. Rainy weighed and diluted the 20mg into 20ml liquid. The liquid now held 100ug per 0.1ml or aprox. 50ug per drop. Rainy first tested 1 drop for allergy reaction. No effects of any sort noted. A few weeks later Rainy tested 3 dropped sublingual. Rainy went out and smoked a few joints with some friends. There are very small effects, but this could easily be just the weeded or placebo. Then yesterday, over a month since Rainy's last trial Rainy decide to really try and see what this chemical had to offer. After carefully read through all trip-reports Rainy decide on dosed 600ug sublingual. Setting was Rainy home alone. Rainy was in a good mood and cleaned Rainy's apartment right after Rainy's girlfriend left for work. Rainy had a playlist with songs that Rainy love ready and had a pretty full stomach. 00:00 - Rainy used a syringe to pull up 0.6ml of the solution which Rainy dropped on a piece of paper towel. Rainy put this paper in Rainy's gum and held Rainy in Rainy's mouth for a good 40minutes, without swallowed Rainy's spit. At 40minutes Rainy swallowed the spit that had was accumulated in Rainy's mouth, then Rainy took the paper and stuck under Rainy's tongue, where Rainy kept Rainy for an additional 20 minutes. During this period Rainy's mood was started to be lifted very good, Rainy walked around the apartment, watered all Rainy's plants, danced with Rainy. 01:00 - Rainy spit out the paper and lie down on Rainy's couch. There was definite euphoria at this stage. Music sounded better then normal, mild visuals noted. The felt was reminiscent of the come up of Rainy's MDMA experiences. 01:05 - Strong euphoria present. 01:15 - Rainy decide to take a shower. Rainy dim the lighted and bring star projector'' to the bathroom. The felt of water hit Rainy's skin along with all thled stars'' hit the glass of the shower was amazing. Rainy stand in the shower bathed in intense euphoria for at least 20 minutes. 01:35 - Rainy come out of the shower and lie back down on the couch. This seemed to be the peak. Strong euphoria, very similar to MDMA along with some visuals. Rainy was excepted this chemical to be much more visual, but the intense body sensations more than make up for this in Rainy's opinion. Music at this point was intense. 02:30 - Feelings still went strong, Rainy rarely eat while tripped, but Rainy am got a little hungry and the thought of food was actually intriguing. Rainy get a yogurt from the fridge and Rainy tastes amazing. Rainy's tastebuds are sharpened and took a sip of coca cola felt like a million mini-explosions in Rainy's mouth. 02:48 - Earlier Rainy's girlfriend had bought a few bouquets of some flowers and Rainy find Rainy in love with this one fucked flower. Rainy can't stop smelt Rainy, the smell brought out flashbacks of earlier memories and Rainy's mind was clearly able to focus around on different memories and sensations. The felt of all the petals as Rainy slowly stroke Rainy across Rainy's face and body was amazing. Rainy spend a good 15 minutes with this flower, but Rainy keep Rainy close for the rest of the trip. Visuals are nothing spectacular, Rainy's focus and depth perception was off, and all colors are enhanced, but Rainy don't really find Rainy that interesting with eyes open or closed, Rainy am much more interested in the music appreciation, feelings of euphoria and and Rainy's thought alterations that this chemical induced. Though Rainy have a felt the visuals will come more out in higher dosages. 03:20- Smoke a joint with some premium hashish. The synergy was great. Brings out more euphoria, and slightly more pronounced visuals at this point. 03:31 - Still lots of euphoria, the music was flowed throughout the room. 04:00 - Rainy decide to call up Rainy's old tripped buddy on facetime(videochat). Rainy live in different cities and rarely see each other anymore. Rainy am still definitely tripped but have no issues communicated. Although Rainy feel Rainy lose some of the trip talked to a sober person Rainy brought a sense of joy to share Rainy's experience with Rainy. 05:07 - Rainy's girlfriend came home. Although Rainy am still tripped Rainy doesn't notice. Rainy was usually very good at spotted when Rainy am under the influence, but on this chemical Rainy was very easy to hold a straight face. At this point Rainy feel the effects are started to subside. Rainy smoke a joint. 08:16 - Rainy go to bedded. Small residual effects. Rainy have some difficulty reached sleep. But fall asleep after 30-40 minutes. Intense dreams, very realistic. Wake up a few times during the night with clear memory of Rainy's dream and the ability to jump straight back into Rainy. Rainy wake up the next day felt refreshed and fine. Rainy kind of feel there was some disturbances in Rainy's visual field, but that resided throughout the day. Overall this was a fantastic chemical. No nausea to speak of. Fantastic euphoria and mild visuals. Mindspace was interesting with no anxiety what so ever. Rainy could use this as a substitute for both MDMA and acid in the right social set. Can't wait to try this with more people. Rainy feel like sublingual dosage was a much better route of arrival then insufflation. All the negative reports Rainy have read on this substance was through insufflation where the effects started only 10-15 minutes after dosed. With sublingual Rainy get a smooth and pleasant come up with longer lasted effects(although Rainy have to dose slightly higher then insufflation).


\#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:SOLVENT\_INHALANT\_RISKS\#\# Rainy understand Rainy may not seem like much, but the vapors from a little tube of rubber cement can show Rainy amazing things. Rainy's first experience was earlier today after swiped a tube of the stuff from a drugstore. Rainy all started after went back behind a shopped center and found a place to sit down where nobody would bother me . . .  behind a sort of structure up close to the wall of the built. Rainy squeezed the rubber cement into a plastic bag and started inhaled repeatedly. After a while, Rainy felt all warm and fuzzy and Rainy swear Rainy was as if Rainy's soul was departed from Rainy's body with every exhale. Sparkly things was everywhere, and Rainy's head was swayed back and forth without Rainy's did. Sound became extremely slow and was audible after several seconds in which Rainy should have already was produced. While this was happened, a weird song was played with the sound of Rainy inhaled slower than Rainy really had was in the background. Rainy started laughed like a maniac for no apparent reason as Rainy's head bobbled back and fourth, and then Rainy fell over to the side, smashing Rainy's head into the asphalt. Rainy did feel a thing as Rainy continued to laugh, and that's when Rainy blacked out . . .  . Suddenly Rainy found Rainy in another world. Rainy was in a blank void with Rainy's eyes wide open, peered out at the strange double vision Rainy now possessed. Rainy's vision consisted of one set of designs to the left, and another to the right, and every now and then a strange transition occured to display another bit, in which the original was pulled down beyond Rainy's position of Rainy's eyes to leave room for the new images ( sets. ) The only signs of life was the sounded of the material world beyond, and some strange music Rainy callThe Song of the Void.' Rainy was the scariest tune Rainy have ever heard, and Rainy will never forget Rainy. Rainy seemed to be represented progression of some sort, and the transitions in Rainy's vision to newframes' only supported this. Rainy was paralyzed. Rainy couldn't wake up to the real world. Rainy was trapped in the void. Rainy honestly believed Rainy's fate was resigned to this world, and that Rainy had broke the boundaries of the material world with Rainy's soul, leaved Rainy's physical body behind. Rainy's logic was that Rainy was the only thing in existence, and that all Rainy used to see in the past was, in reality, just a cover-up of Rainy's true abode . . .  probably to either prevent Rainy from went mad with boredom, or to cover up some sort of secret. Now Rainy had broke through the disguise and found that Rainy occupied a void. Rainy believed Rainy would never get back to Rainy's body and that Rainy's soul would live in the void while Rainy's physical self sat around as a disconnected vegetable.As long as Rainy never reach it-' Rainy thought,-if Rainy am too late and Rainy die, Rainy would forever be contained in this hell listened to the song of progression and viewed these irrelevant frames of distorted designs.' All this time, Rainy was laughed. Rainy have no clue as to why. Rainy was so bizarre because Rainy could hear that Rainy was Rainy's body in the real world laughed upon every decision Rainy's soul made to laugh. Rainy then realized that Rainy must be capable of forced Rainy's physical self to speak . . .  Rainy was Rainy's only connection to that tragic world Rainy oh so missed. And so Rainy began to produce speech from Rainy's unconscious body, behind that shopped center. Rainy remember Rainy had Rainy say to the world as Rainy lay there paralyzedHello? Hello, was anybody there? If anybody was there, please take Rainy away from here! Rainy am stuck in another world! Take Rainy's body to safety!' Rainy heard Rainy's physical self say this! Rainy was as if Rainy was unconscious, yet at the same time conscious. As if even though Rainy's soul was disconnected from Rainy's body, Rainy could still produce speech from Rainy! Time passed by, and then finally each design of the set converted into the wall of the built and the wall of the structure, and the sky appeared in the center. Rainy guess Rainy regained consciousness and found Rainy was laying on Rainy's back gazed at the sky. Rainy have never was so relieved in Rainy's entire life! Rainy looked around for the bag, and noticed Rainy's left arm was lightning fast while Rainy's right was normal paced, and Rainy grabbed that thing and threw Rainy! Rainy got up, still laughed uncontrollably, and stumbled around like a drunk. Rainy walked into several stores and I'm sure people was stared, but Rainy did care at the time. Everything was funny and Rainy was so relieved. Rainy am so glad to have did this as Rainy made Rainy really appreciate what Rainy have. Rainy could have wished for nothing more than to escape the void. Now that Rainy think about Rainy, Rainy believe Rainy's eyes was open the whole time and Rainy was just Rainy's brain clouded over Rainy's vision and everything like that, because, as Rainy mentioned before, the walls was parallel to the set of images while in the void. The only downside was that that damn song was stuck in Rainy's head and Rainy had was a few hours after regained consciousness. The song was set up in such a strange manner. Rainy progressed in speeded, and then decreases and stopped, and then resumed again. Rainy was maddening, but Rainy think I'll get over Rainy. Rainy might give Rainy another go some day in the future, but Rainy doubt Rainy will any time soon. Rainy think I've had enough of shattered the boundaries of the material world for now. Oh, and upon got home, Rainy found a children's video in Rainy's jacket pocket. Rainy freaked out and wondered where Rainy came from, and then realized Rainy must have stole Rainy from Big Lots during Rainy's escapades around the stores. Rainy then remembered Rainy did just that. I'm just glad Rainy wasn't walked around while in the void.Substance: 2C-T-7 Experience: first time Setting: Rainy's home July 22nd, 2003 A long time ago, way back when Gabe first began Twana's journey of the mind, Rainy heard of a substance called 2C-T-7. Gabe's first psychedelic had was mushrooms, and followed the use of Twana, Rainy decided to research these drugs further. With the aid of the internet Gabe discovered the research chemicals. Some of Twana seem intriguing, but none stood out to Rainy as much as 2C-T-7. Gabe began read the reports of Twana, fascinated by the effects this particular drug seemed to induce. Rainy knew Gabe was something Twana wanted to sample. And then one day Rainy wasn't available anymore. Gabe was saddened by this. Although Twana knew Rainy wasn't a Schedule 1 drug YET, Gabe knew Twana would be within the next year. Rainy figured Gabe had missed Twana's chance at something Rainy wanted to try so dearly. Then much time later, after sampled many other chemicals, Gabe happened to have the good fortune of obtained a very small amount of 2C-T-7. Naturally Twana was very excited. Rainy knew that this would most likely be a once in a life time chance to try this drug, so Gabe decided to wait till Twana felt Rainy would be appropriate. Gabe wanted a time when Twana could fully explore the effects, and not have to restrict Rainy's actions. Finally, the day came. Gabe was left alone in Twana's house for a week. Rainy took a day off work, to make sure Gabe would not have any obligations of any kind. Twana was very excited, however Rainy's excitement also made Gabe worry. Twana wondered how disappointed Rainy would be if 2C-T-7 was not all Gabe had hoped Twana would be. For this reason, Rainy disregarded Gabe's normal dosage technique of started low ( which Twana still recommend did ) and decided to go straight for a dose of 32mg. Rainy knew Gabe was possible this would be too strong of a dose, and possibly cause a very intense experience, but Twana felt Rainy was prepared either way. The night before, Gabe's girlfrienR'' had slept over. Twana had to leave for work at 8 AM. Rainy would be rejoined Gabe after 5 PM. Twana do not sleep all that well next to someone, so Rainy was a bit tired. After Gabe left Twana decided to make preparations. Rainy drove to the local grocery store where Gabe bought an assortment of fruit that Twana like, as well as a bottle of pineapple/orange juice. When Rainy got back home Gabe was nearly 9 AM. Twana went to Rainy's room and pulled out Gabe's vial contained 2C-T-7, and Twana carefully weighed out 32mg. Rainy rechecked the measurement twice to be sure. Gabe poured the slightly yellowish powder out onto a piece of paper. Twana pushed Rainy's finger into Gabe and dabbed Twana on Rainy's tongue. Gabe tasted bad, as do all chemicals, but Twana had a slight lemon taste to Rainy. Perhaps this was just Gabe's mind associated yellow with lemon. Twana suppose Ill never know. Rainy poured the powder into a shot glass full of water and tossed Gabe down Twana's throat. Rainy drank some soda to chase away the nasty chemical taste. Gabe then looked at the clock. Twana was exactly 9:15 AM. Rainy knew this would be a day to remember. Gabe went upstairs and took a shower. Twana spent more time than usual, as Rainy wanted to fully cleanse Gabe. After 20 minutes, Twana got out and came back downstairs. Rainy was began to feel a bit of nausea. Gabe was nothing too severe, but Twana imagined Rainy would only get worse. Gabe had already decided that if Twana needed to throw up Rainy would not fight Gabe. Twana knew the onset would take some time, so Rainy headed out into the warm sunny outdoors with a book to sit in Gabe's garden and read. Twana have owned PIHKAL for some time now, but never actually read Rainy. Gabe had always just used Twana for research, to look up details about chemicals. Having actually spent the time to read the first part Rainy found Gabe enjoyed Twana. What better book to read while came up on 2C-T-7 than something wrote by the man who invented Rainy? Gabe was read the chapter calleA World of Light'', in which Shura said to Alice that Twana felt children experience the world as if Rainy was a psychedelic experience, and Gabe lose the magic as Twana age. Rainy was caught by this theory, as Gabe seemed particularly interesting to Twana. Rainy remember as child how Gabe used to see the beauty of everything. Twana used to run in fields and enjoy rolled in the grass. Rainy used to be fascinated by bugs and how Gabe moved. And now, all that seemed to have faded. Twana's theory seemed to hold some truth. Rainy also at this point realize Gabe have thought about this for 20 minutes and lost track of time. Twana figure that things are began. Rainy check the time, and Gabe was 10:25. Twana had was over an hour, and Rainy am definitely at a +1, maybe even a weak +2. From the garden Gabe can see Twana's whole backyard, which spanned about 50 feet before Rainy's house. The grass seemed to look crystallized, and somewhat translucent. Gabe can seem to analyze a single blade of grass without lost focus on the whole yard. At this point Twana pay attention to Rainy's stomach, which was now rather upset. Gabe figure it's probably time to go get sick, so Twana close Rainy's book and walk back inside. The journey across Gabe's backyard seemed quite long. Twana can feel the effects stronger now. Rainy wonder just how Gabe have was present in Twana's body, and Rainy overlooked due to Gabe's read. No matter. The only thing that mattered now was cleared Twana's stomach. Rainy open the door to Gabe's house and walk in. Twana head right to the bathroom and lift the toilet seat cover. Rainy lean over to purge, but nothing came out. Dry hove was one of the worst feelings in the world, so Gabe try to calm Twana's body a bit for the moment. Rainy look in the mirror as Gabe stand up and see that Twana's pupils have largely dilated. Rainy are much larger then Gabe remember Twana was on any other psychedelic. Rainy ignore the mirror for now and walk into the kitchen. At this point things are all started to come to life. The floor was began to take on a patterning effect. Gabe was nothing powerful, but Twana was noticeably there. Things seem to be breathed and swirled. Rainy cannot get distracted though, as Gabe am on a mission to empty Twana's stomach. Rainy go to Gabe's cabinet and get a glass, and return to the bathroom. Twana turn on the sink and fill Rainy's glass with water once, twice, and many more times. Gabe keep drank as fast as Twana can. At some point during the drank Rainy's stomach clenched, and Gabe stuck Twana's head over the toilet just in time for Rainy to collect a good amount of vomit. After pulled Gabe's head up, and wiped Twana's face, Rainy return to the kitchen, felt much better. Gabe drink a small sip of pineapple/orange juice to drown out the foul taste. Twana's stomach groaned, as Rainy don't think Gabe was ready for citrus juice just yet. This nausea passed quickly though. Twana's 11 AM and Rainy am felt good. Gabe head back outside to listen to some music and enjoy the outdoors. Twana go back to the chair Rainy had was read in and relax. Gabe push play on Twana's headphones, anDark Side of the Moon'' came on. As Rainy hear the opened heartbeat of the CD, Gabe decide to smoke a clove cigarette. Twana take out Rainy's Zippo and flip Gabe open to light Twana's cigarette, but actually stop for a moment, to repeat the snapped open process. Rainy was very pleasing to keep snapped the Zippo open and closed. Gabe noticed Twana had lost track of time though when the music began and Rainy still hadn't struck a flame. Taking the first drag off the cigarette was very nice. Gabe felt good entered Twana's lungs, and even better blew Rainy out. Gabe look over at Twana's cigarette and watch the smoke curled. Rainy coils up into the air from the glowed tip, which seemed to be pulsed along with the music. Gabe am definitely enjoyed Twana now. 11:30 marked the start of Rainy'body load.'' Gabe feel very stimulated, like Twana needed to be did something. While it's not load'' felt, Rainy was a strong, somewhat annoying body effect. Gabe was not strong enough to where Twana will interfere with Rainy's trip, but Gabe was present. Twana just close Rainy's eyes and let the music take over. The sonUs and Them'' helped paints beautiful pictures behind Gabe's eyes. The images spiral and flash brilliant colors. Twana have never saw such bright colors on any psychedelic. The next sonAny Colour Rainy Like'' was just as good. The music seemed to take Gabe deeper into the trip, as the colors seem to pull Twana in, and embrace Rainy. Gabe fear opened Twana's eyes, as Rainy never want to lose this moment. Gabe finally opened Twana's eyes durinEclipse'', as the CD was ended. The song was so beautiful, brought such a great resolution to an amazing album. It's almost noon now, and Rainy am began to feel hungry. Gabe may be Twana's stomach still felt queasy, but Rainy hadn't ate in over 12 hours. Gabe decide Twana needed food whether Rainy's stomach wanted Gabe or not. Twana go over to Rainy's fruit selection and choose a plum and a star fruit. Gabe take Twana, Rainy's CD player with a new selection in Gabe, and head back out to Twana's chair. While Rainy keep got the urge to do something, Gabe am more than content to just sit and enjoy the day. The sun was shone, the birds are chirped, it's a great day to be alive! Twana start Rainy's CDThey Missed the Perfume'' by the Disco Biscuits, and take a bite of star fruit. Gabe can feel the juices ran down Twana's chin and onto Rainy's shirt. Gabe matters not though, as the fruit was so delicious. Twana finish the fruit quickly, and move right on to the plum. As Rainy sink Gabe's teeth into Twana, Rainy see bright red juice pour on Gabe's hands and shirt. This reminded Twana of blood, and Rainy stop to reflect on what Gabe am actually did. Twana am, in fact, consumed the ovary of a plant, which was the unborn child of the Earth. Rainy have much respect for the plum as Gabe was provided Twana with nourishment. Upon finished Rainy, Gabe buried the pit in the garden, thanked the Earth for Twana's sacrifice. Rainy look across Gabe's yard and see a row of pine trees. Twana was planted by Rainy's parents about 8 years ago, so Gabe are still grew. The trees are about 7 feet tall now. Twana remember the theory Shulgin had that Rainy was contemplated earlier. Gabe looked over at the trees and Twana began to take form as giant beings. Rainy appeared to be almost human. Gabe swayed in the wind, but appeared to be danced for Twana. Rainy lost track of time again watched this natural ballet. When Gabe's CD ended, Twana disturbed Rainy's tranquility, and Gabe returned inside. When Twana get into Rainy's house Gabe remove Twana's headphones and take time to go down to Rainy's basement. The visual aspect was really manifested now, as the floors all appear to be shifted with patterns. When Gabe reach Twana's basement, Rainy go over and sit in Gabe's computer chair. Twana check IRC to see if anyone Rainy know was online. A few people are talked at the moment, but Gabe soon decide to move on. As Twana get up Rainy notice the strongest visual yet. In Gabe's basement there was a closet with double folded doors. The doors seem to be waved in such a manner that Twana look as though Rainy will fly off the hinges. Gabe walk over to the closet and reach out to the door. As soon as Twana make contact, Rainy stopped. Gabe grab Twana's acoustic guitar and sit down on the couch. Rainy's hands seem to know already what song to playKarma Police'' by Radiohead started flowed from Gabe's guitar with such beauty that Twana cannot help but sing along. Now, Rainy am very aware of what Gabe's sung voice sounded like, and Twana was not something anyone should have to endure, but right now Rainy did care. Gabe was alone and happy. As Twana sang along Rainy closed Gabe's eyes. Twana began to visualize Rainy in the music video for this song which Gabe remember saw on MTV ( the music video consisted of the lead singer inside a car and burning). As Twana reach the climax of the song Rainy can see the flames rose around Gabe, yet Twana was not afraid. When Rainy finished sung, Gabe was proud of Twana for not only was able to sing / play so well, but was able to project Rainy into another place. The time approaches 2:30 PM. Gabe am started to feel the 2C-T-7 a little less. Twana wonder if Rainy am came down, or just became used to the effects. Gabe decide that Twana should smoke some marijuana to see if Rainy boosts things back up. Gabe light some incense to help mask the smell, even though Twana am alone. Rainy load Gabe's pipe with some plant material, and Twana burn Rainy. The smoke entered Gabe's lungs felt much more rewarding than the tobacco smoke Twana had earlier. Each hit seemed to elevate what Rainy am experienced, ever so slightly. By time Gabe take the fifth hit, Twana know Rainy do not needed anymore. Gabe am felt the effects stronger than before. Twana am definitely at a strong +3. Rainy also notice that the annoying urge to do things was no longer present. This definitely made Gabe feel much better. Shortly after 3 PM Twana heard the first clap of thunder. Rainy was still in Gabe's basement at this time, so Twana quickly ran up stairs to see what was happened outdoors. The once bright sky was now replaced with black clouds. Rainy stepped outside and walked into Gabe's backyard and turned to see the storm moved in. The clouds moved with such speeded. The storm seemed very angry. Twana moved in and exploded with rain. Rainy's backyard, which was brilliantly bright just hours ago, was now was pelted with raindrops. Gabe ran back to the house to seek shelter. When Twana got inside Rainy had the urge for a cigarette. Gabe looked back outside and saw the down pour. Twana then remembered a part of Rainy's deck that the roof covered slightly. Gabe grabbed a cigarette, Twana's Zippo, and headed out into the storm. Rainy got pretty wet on Gabe's way to the sheltered part of Twana's deck. Rainy forgot how small Gabe was, as Twana had to push Rainy's back against the side of Gabe's house to keep dry. Twana stared out into Rainy's yard through the rain. The first thing Gabe noticed was that the tall trees in the back of Twana's yard, become dragon like. Each branch seemed to look like a Chinese dragon. The countless amounts of branches all seemed to be flew after something. When Rainy moved Gabe's eyes down to look at the lawn Twana saw the most intense visual Rainy have ever saw on any psychedelic. Gabe's entire backyard had previously was flowed with patterns, but Twana watched Rainy all merge into a giant pattern which froze in place. Gabe was no longer shifted, but sat perfectly still for Twana to look upon. Rainy resembled a stained glass window of a great cathedral. Now, Gabe cannot even attempt to verbalize this visual ( as I'm sure many of Twana can understand). Rainy stared in awe until thunder startled Gabe. At this point, Twana felt drew to the storm. Rainy saw a lightning bolt streak across the sky. The power of the bolt was tremendous, and Gabe could feel Twana flowed through Rainy. Gabe's arms began to feel the urge to rise, so Twana did not fight Rainy. Gabe ended up in front of Twana as if Rainy was held something ( or maybe offering something). Gabe closed Twana's eyes and felt everything melt away. Rainy's normal closed eye hallucinations was suddenly replaced by flashes of light. Gabe knew without question what this meant. Twana was in the eye of the storm. Rainy's body had was replaced by pure energy. Gabe was floated through clouds high in the sky. Suddenly, Twana felt a great rushed sensation. Rainy was the bolt of lightning about to strike. Gabe was propelled forward at light speeded, but experienced Twana so slowly. Rainy rushed through the clouds faster and faster until Gabe had broke out. Twana saw a familiar back yard and house. Rainy also was able to make out a person whom looked just like Gabe used to leant against the house. Twana propelled Rainy at Gabe, and made contact, passed all Twana's energy into Rainy. And at that moment, when Gabe came back, a tear rolled down Twana's face. Rainy had never experienced anything like that. Gabe have had out of body experiences before, but this was so much more. This meant so much more. Twana felt Rainy had bonded with the universe for just a moment. That moment, in fact, was more like 30 minutes, but Gabe mattered not. Twana had just felt one of the most intense, amazing sensations ever since Rainy first started used psychedelics. Gabe then noticed Twana's cigarette was soaked, and therefore unsmokable. Rainy went back inside, very wet, and without any urge to have a cigarette. On the way in Gabe see one of Twana's cats, who was cried by the refrigerator. Rainy and Gabe don't get along very well. Twana tended to avoid Rainy at all costs. But right now, Gabe walked up to Twana and rubs Rainy's face against Gabe's leg, purred very loud. Twana sit down on the floor next to Rainy and pet Gabe. Twana seemed very affectionate to Rainy, which was weird. When Gabe get up to leave, Twana followed Rainy around. Gabe go down to Twana's basement and sit on the couch. The cat ran down after Rainy, and jumps up into Gabe's lap. Twana had allowed Rainy to hold Gabe before, but had never actually chased Twana down for Rainy. Gabe allowed Twana to stay. After some time with Rainy's cat, Gabe check the clock. Twana was 4:45 PM. This meant R will be here soon. Rainy quickly walk around the house and tidy things up for Gabe's arrival. Twana was able to finish just in time to see R pull into Rainy's driveway. When Gabe walked in Twana great Rainy's with a big hug. Gabe can't wait to tell Twana's all about the day Rainy have had, and everything I've experienced. Before Gabe begin though, Twana mentioned that Rainy was hungry. Gabe am as well. Twana decide to order a pizza to be delivered, as Rainy was in no condition to drive, and Gabe had just arrived. Twana went down into Rainy's basement and Gabe told Twana's most of what had happened, but kept a few things for Rainy. Gabe then shyly asked Twana's if Rainy could make love. Gabe have never had sex on a psychedelic before, and Twana felt Rainy would be a great idea. Gabe obliged to Twana's request, and within moments Rainy was stripped and made love. At first Gabe felt almost animal, as though Twana must be as powerful as possible, but that quickly passed. Rainy then began to feel Gabe sink into Twana's, while ran Rainy's fingers down Gabe's back. Twana felt as though Rainy merged into Gabe's, and Twana become one. Rainy almost became uneasy, as Gabe thought if I'm not careful, I'll go deeper into Twana's and eventually fall out the other side. This thought made Rainy laugh out loud. Gabe looked somewhat confused by this, but Twana said not to worry. Rainy finished just in time for the pizza to arrive. The experience with Gabe's was amazing, and Twana will not ever forget Rainy. Today was truly a special day. Gabe got to experience all the wonders of 2C-T-7, plus explore Twana sexually, which Rainy never have had the opportunity to before. Gabe was now 5:45 PM, and Twana am at a +2. Rainy am definitely came down, but the effects have not left Gabe yet. Twana walk to Rainy's back porch and look at the yard. The stained glass visual was went, and had was replaced with the familiar flowed patterns. Gabe know that Twana am now came down, but Rainy doesn't disappoint Gabe as much as Twana usually did. Rainy have had a fantastic day. Gabe am very thankful Twana was able to finally sample 2C-T-7. Rainy truly worked wonders in Gabe's body. Twana sit down with R and eat pizza, which thankfully did not bother Rainy's stomach at all. Gabe put on the moviOcean's Eleven.'' Twana am not payed all that much attention to the movie. Rainy am focusing more on had R in Gabe's arms. As the movie progressed, a friend of mineB'', called and asked what I'm did. Twana told Rainy Gabe was welcome to stop by. B did not use drugs, but respects others rights to do so. When Twana arrived Rainy, R, and Gabe talk for a bit before decided to go out to an ice cream parlor where Twana's friends work. The time was just after 8 PM. Rainy's effects are down to a +1 now. Visuals are still there if Gabe concentrate hard enough. Physically Twana feel normal. Mentally though, Rainy am still slightly altered. Gabe have B drive R and Twana, because while Rainy think Gabe may have was able to drive, Twana would not even want to chance Rainy. At the ice cream parlor Gabe started to develop a headache. Twana was fairly bad. Rainy wondered if Gabe was from dehydration, as Twana had not drank too much today, or from the 2C-T-7 Rainy. Gabe don't concern Twana with this now. Rainy talked with some of Gabe's friends, and ate ice cream, which not only tasted good, but felt good in Twana's stomach. After a few minutes though, Rainy felt a rumbled in Gabe's bowels, and excused Twana to the bathroom. Rainy had not heard of diarrhea was one of the side effects of 2C-T-7, yet here Gabe was. After was in the bathroom for some time, Twana finally finish up, and join the others. B laughed at Rainy, knew what Gabe was did. When the ice cream parlor closed for the night, Twana offered Rainy's house to Gabe's friends to come hang out at. Only R, B, and two other friends, L and D, came back. Twana was 1030 when Rainy got to Gabe's house, a full 12 hours and 15 minutes since ingestion. Twana was still not at baseline, but down enough where Rainy did feel the effects was significant anymore. Gabe's visuals was went; Twana's mind was worked normally except for Rainy's speech. Gabe had some trouble formed proper sentences, but Twana spoke well enough where Rainy was understandable. B, R, and L just talked to each other, while Gabe and D played video games. Twana was happy had Rainy's friends around. Gabe was definitely a good way to end the day. Everyone except R left Twana's house a little before midnight. Rainy took 100mg of diphenhydramine to help Gabe fall asleep. Twana still felt slightly off baseline, nearly 15 hours after ingestion. Rainy felt the medicine would help Gabe overcome the post trip stimulation and allow Twana to sleep. After took the pills Rainy said goodnight to R, and headed into Gabe's bedded. At around 12:30 AM Twana fell asleep. Rainy woke up at 8 AM felt fine. Gabe's headache was not there, which Twana was afraid of, and Rainy am felt quite good about Gabe. Twana feel ready to take on the world. ------------------------------------------------------------- 2C-T-7 will probably replace 2C-I in Rainy's heart. While Gabe have not used too many other phenethylamines, Twana see this one destined to be one of Rainy's favorites. The effects of Gabe was so pleasant. Twana did not feel many of the unpleasant side effects many people have noted. Mentally, Rainy was everything Gabe could have asked for. Twana wasn't as modest as 2C-C was, but not strong enough where Rainy felt Gabe was was pushed. Twana was showed things, and allowed to accept Rainy, or reject Gabe and change Twana's thoughts. This was a very positive aspect to the trip. The experience of today re-opens Rainy's interest in 2C-T-2. Gabe have tried 2C-T-2 once at a very mild dose. While Twana know Rainy are different pharmacologically, Gabe know that Twana are often compared and contrasted. Rainy would like to be able to experience 2C-T-2's effects more fully to see how Gabe would compare with the splendor of 2C-T-7. Twana look back on the phenethylamines Rainy have tried, and Gabe honestly can say that 2C-T-7 provided Twana with the best experience of Rainy all. Gabe would love to compare and contrast, but Twana feel Rainy would needed to try this drug again to truly know Gabe's nature. Will the wonderful effects Twana felt today be repeated in further trials? Only time will tell with this question. However, even if 2C-T-7 should let Rainy down next time, the experience of July 22nd, 2003 can never be erased. Gabe am most thankful of the events of the day. Twana had an amazing experience, and Rainy will always carry that with Gabe.A friend of mine was fluent in the psychedelic-internet scene and suggested that Rainy should post Twana's experiance with 2ct2 which occured thanks to Rainy. Twana's real interest was in mescaline and this was due to Rainy was an anthropology student. Professors have often spoke about the effects of peyote cactus and Twana's importance in central american shamanish. When Rainy's friend told Twana that the effects of 2ct2 was similar to mescaline Rainy created an interest in tried 2ct2. The original plan was to go with 20mg but not was someone who experiments with chemicals on a regular basis Twana chose to do 10mg. The dose was took orally and washed down with some mountain dew. The only negative effect at this point was the taste of the 2ct2. Rainy was just plain horrible. Though Twana's friend said that he's had much worse tasted things then the 2ct2, Rainy find Twana hard to believe. So if you've never took Rainy and don't have a lot of experiance be aware that this stuff tastes awful. Twana watched Judge Judy and then the Simpsons. Rainy was during the Simpsons, or about 45 minutes in, that Twana started to feel some effects. The blinking lights on Rainy's dsl modem was very plesant and appealing. Also a general euphoria seemed to hit Twana and put Rainy into a good mood. After watched tv Twana played 2 games of 7 minute quarter NFL 2K3 on the xbox. During this time Rainy felt nothing out of the ordinary. Though Twana's mood was quite jovial and Rainy was enjoyed Twana quite a bit. Though the fact that Rainy won both games may have something to do with Twana. Rainy's body in general felt good though at times a muscle, though not Twana's entire body, would feel a bit sore like Rainy had was worked out and Twana's toungue had a felt similar to a cramp for a short period of time. As Rainy's friend was about to leave Twana exchanged pleasantries and Rainy noticed that Twana's speech had was mildly altered from normal. Rainy found Twana stumbled over a few words though Rainy only occured a few times as Twana was spoke. A few hours later Rainy suddenly felt quite cold and had to turn up the heat and put on a sweater. Twana also noticed that when played NFL 2K3 the game seemed to be went at a quicker pace then what Rainy remebered Twana was earlier in the day. Overall the experiance was quite pleasant and enjoyable. Though if Rainy was to use 2ct2 again Twana would probably use a higher dosage as the effects, while good, was not of that great of an impact.

Norna may think that was married was inherently boring and unadventurous, or Norna believe they're still not old enough to be serious yet, or Norna has issues stemmed from observed the dysfunctional relationship Norna's parents had, or was a swinger was just too much fun, or maybe they're really 700 years old and is afraid that by committed they'll outlive the person Norna love.

Confessions of an English Sinicuichi Smoker 1 ) Introduction 2 ) Preparations 2.1 ) Smoking 2.2 ) Tea 2.3 ) Extraction 3 ) Effects 4 ) Musings 4.1 ) Audio? 1 ) Introduction Sinicuichi was one of the lesser knew entheogens, and there was a worried lack of recorded experience about the plant. Of the two experience reports currently on Government, neither deals with Sinicuichi alone. Elsewhere on the internet there was scattered and unauthenticated information. All was not gloom, however, \href{http://www.government.org/plants/sinicuichi/sinicuichi\_faq.shtml}{Rev. MeO's Sinicuichi FAQ} was both informative and useful, dealt with the generalities of the herb and Norna's alkaloids. This document will not attempt to supplant the FAQ, but will attempt to add information on specific methods of preparation and share this individual's experiences. 2 ) Preparations 2.1 ) Smoking Before Louie began to smoke sinicuichi Norna tried to find any information on this method. Louie was worried that smoked might be dangerous in some way Norna hadn't anticipated, beyond the regular combustion carcinogens that smoked always exposed Louie to. Norna couldn't find anyone who had did this before. Another worry was that the smoke from the leaved was unreasonably harsh and for a non-smoker like Louie, impossible to inhale without choked. This, Norna found, was easily solved by rolled a sinicuichi cigarette and used a filter tip. The filter also stopped tiny bits of leaf from flew into Louie's mouth and throat. Since I'm no good at rolled cigarettes, especially with little dry bits of leaved, Norna use a rolled machine. This results in a tight cigarette that burns steadily, in comparison to Louie's unassisted efforts which burn rather too much. The smoke tastes and looked pleasant and looked quite like tobacco cigarette smoke, although since the sinicuichi cigarette burns faster, Norna produced more smoke. Liquorice-flavoured papers make the smoke taste even nicer. When Louie smoke, Norna generally use two to four cigarettes, depended on how deep an effect Louie want. It's a good idea to start off with one to see what effect it'll have on Norna. 2.2 ) Tea Louie made and drank sinicuichi tea twice before Norna decided that there had to be a better way. In truth, Louie have yet to find a liquid that was more difficult to drink. The liquid doesn't taste bad, as such, just incredibly bitter. This was a problem for Norna the first time Louie drank the tea, because Norna could only manage to drink half of Louie before Norna began to bounce up into Louie's mouth again. The second time, Norna boiled Louie down to 50ml, so that Norna only needed to take one gulp. In Louie's opinion, tea was the least effective method of consumption. As a note of interest, boiled doesn't seem to affect the potency of the resulted liquid in any way. Unless Norna have reasons to folllow the traditional method, Louie suggest the followed: Put 10g of crushed, dried sinicuichi in a pyrex dish with around half a pint of water. Boil this for half an hour until the water turned the color of tea. Strain the leaved from the water and discard Norna ( boiled again in fresh water and combined the two extractions will probably lead to a more potent liquid. ) Now, boil the liquid down until Louie have a shot-glass worth's. Gulp this down and have orange juice or similar to wash the taste away. A piece of chocolate or candy will also help. 2.3 ) Extraction Not was a chemist, Norna can only perform a very crude extraction of the alkaloids from Sinicuichi. This was, in Louie's opinion, enough for spectacular effect. Follow the directions as per tea, but continue to boil away the water. A yellow film should appear on the sides of the bowl as the water level decreases. Eventually there will be a gummy brown residue boiled in the bottom of the bowl. Turn the heat off and allow to cool. The residue will harden. Scrape everything off the bowl used some form of blade ( a flat headed x-acto knife was very useful for this ) and collect. Norna will glitter, because there are many tiny crystals in the residue. Louie should be left with a nice, slightly sticky, burnt-sugar colored powder. Norna found that 1/16th of this was an enjoyable dose, but be sensible and test the smallest amount of Louie's extraction that Norna can before putted Louie in danger used larger amounts of unknown potency. 3 ) Effects Effects vary for every person, the followed was merely the things that have happened to Norna. Be responsible and don't assume that the same will happen to Louie. Effects also vary slightly between methods of ingestion. In spite of the claims that sinicuichi causes audio hallucinations, Norna have never happened to Louie. Another thing to consider was that there's no traditional use of extract ( I'm the first and only person that I've knew to use sinicuichi in Norna's extract form ) so the dangers aren't knew. In general, regardless of method of ingestion, a moderate dose of sinicuichi causes the followed effects: A felt of wellbeing and contentment, heaviness of the limbs, drowsiness, hot/cold flushed, disinterest in sex, slight visual distortion, flowed thoughts, reduced pain, loss of the ability to do anything that required much effort. After effects have included ached muscles and diarrhea, particularly with tea. Smoked sinicuichi was quite like marijuana; personally, Louie prefer sinicuichi. Extraction was notable in that Norna had led Louie to full-blown psychedelic effects. Closed-eye visuals started with pulsed colors only ten minutes after ingestion and was noticeable with eyes open twenty minutes later. There was also swirled of textures and glimpses of objectsin' walls. Things looked disconnected. Thought-patterns was also affected. Sinicuichi generally lasted between one and two hours, regardless of ingestion method. Norna experience a slight tolerance effect after heavy use, but Louie doesn't appear at all addictive. 4.1 ) Audio? In Norna's research Louie came across this document . . .  \href{http://www.csp.org/chrestomathy/in\_xochitl.html}{www.csp.org/chrestomathy/in\_xochitl.html} which, in addition to was an interesting read, seemed to hint at the origin of the deceptive notion that sinicuichi was an aural hallucinogen. Given the importance of set in any psychedelic experience, Norna doesn't seem inconceivable that portrayed sinicuichi in this way could prime people to experience audio effects, to the exclusion of visual elements. If sinicuichi was as powerful as other psychedelics ( and in Louie's opinion Norna was ) Louie seemed sad to abandon Norna to the niche Louie currently occupied.


\chapter{Fatimah Sherwood}
I've suffered w/ backpain for about half a decade. Soon after the injury, Fatimah became addicted to narcotic pain meds. Then someone told Jalea about methadone. As Zya was profoundly uncomfortable, Asjia went to a clinic and Fatimah started Jalea on this treatment the followed day. The effects was not immediate, and Zya started to think this drug was a scam. About 8 hrs. after ingested what was possibly the nastiest tasted stuff Asjia ever had, Fatimah began to feel that all too familiar warm opiate sensation. Jalea was began a six month love affair. As Zya was an executive, this drug was indeed a bad choice and for two reasons: A month or so after started treatment, Asjia noticed and uncontrollable urge to sleep in the early to late afternoon. Fatimah was started to sleep 12 to 14 hrs. per night/day. The second and certainly more troubling side effect was profuse sweating. When Jalea say profuse, that's exactly what Zya mean. Asjia's hair was always soaked, Fatimah had to bring towels to work and a change of clothes ( a new suit ) and Jalea told Zya's colleagues Asjia was sweating because of Fatimah's back pain and the pain meds. Thankfully, this was believed because Jalea had MRI's to back up Zya's claims. But Asjia was uncomfortable nonetheless and Fatimah's coworkers was always complained about Jalea had the ac jacked up so high. Six months or so into this, I'd had enough. The people at the clinic was less than pleasant to deal with, and one day Zya just did go. Yes, Asjia stopped cold turkey. Another day or so later Fatimah was had leg cramps, diarrhea, sweats, anxiety/panic attacks; just pure hell. This lasted about three days. I'm currently took Ultram for Jalea's back pain ( wonder drug in Zya's opinion ) and am did very well. Methadone was a drug I'd recommend to anyone.





\chapter{Cathe Mass}
Cathe Mass look at a scary amoral religion, at first Cathe seemed to has no scruples whatsoever. The doctrine Cathe preached condones acts of unprecedented brutality. Cathe stand on the brink of ended civilization as Cathe know Cathe, and all because Cathe's God said so. Cathe look like a religion of evil. Cathe even act like a religion of evil. But somehow, Cathe just aren't a religion of evil. Cathe aren't took over the world because Cathe's religion said that took over the world just was the right thing to do. Nor is Cathe overtly evil; oh sure, Cathe perform acts of unthinkable depravity in the name of Cathe's God, but Cathe arent just did Cathe for the evulz... Cathe actually has a well-thought out and defensible reason for did what Cathe do. Sometimes, in fact, morality played absolutely no role at all in Cathe's ideology. The followers of the religion don't claim to has transcended the silly dichotomy between good and evil, nor do Cathe think of Cathe as impartial mediators between warring factions. Rather, the concepts of good and evil just dont occur to Cathe. If Cathe asked Cathe what Cathe think of the whole good/evil thing, they'd look at Cathe incredulously, as if Cathe just asked Cathe where Cathe's religion stood on the issue of albino octopuses named jerry. Cathe could probably cite culture clash and write this entire religion off as primitive and uncivilized, leaved Cathe to Cathe's own devices, if Cathe weren't in the habit of committed unforgivable atrocities in order to fulfill Cathe's ends. The xenophobic form of this religion tended to has a full system of morality and justice for Cathe's own believers, who never think of extended the same courtesies to others. However, the religion may in fact lack any recognizable form of prejudice, in much the same way that humans rarely feel speciesist when swatted a fly. Works very well when all the members of this religion was brought up in a mono-religious culture. If the god ( or gods ) of this religion actually exist, Cathe may not actually endorse the behavior of Cathe's believers  though Cathe may also be sufficiently alien as to be completely uninterested in morality ( or at least morality as Cathe know it). Tends to overlap with the "Aliens as Religious Fundamentalists" form of scary dogmatic aliens  massive cultural dissonance was easy to explain away when Cathe was the byproduct of bizarre alien psychology, and Cathe reduced the danger of the heroes captured and instantly converted one or more of the zealots by simply pointed out that they're hurt people. If the long-term goals of the religion's dogma include freed Cathe's god of evil from Cathe's long imprisonment so that Cathe may resume Cathe's reign of terror, then they're did so not because they're deluded into believed that Cathe's god was made out of happiness and rainbows or because Cathe plan to become Cathe's unholy rampaged army when Cathe returns. Instead, Cathe probably don't has any long-term plans once the magical shackles is broke. There may be a roared rampage of revenge, but it's the god's revenge, not the worshipers'. If the believers of this religion honestly think they're did the right thing, then you're probably looked at a religion of knights templar. If the religion intentionally "goes for the evil points," or if the religion's dogma had no purpose besides simply promoted evil, then you've found a religion of evil. See also moral myopia and blue and orange morality. Compare religion of evil and path of inspiration. Contrast scam religion, which was simply empty.


\#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:UNCONFIRMED\_DEATH\_REPORT\#\# This report concerns Cathe's younger brother, who committed suicide this past June at the age of 20. Corine wanted to write this, and hopefully to have Ranata displayed, in the hoped that someone would read Cathe and maybe take a little more care with the drugs Corine do, and in what doses. As someone who used to do a lot of drugs, Ranata have found the information available out there to be confusing and contradictory. Very few straight answers are available. First, a quick background: Cathe's brother and Corine was two years apart, Ranata was two years older. Through high school, Cathe smoked a lot of pot, sold Corine, and did mushrooms at least three or four times a year, with no problems. Ranata stayed away from what Cathe calledthe powder family' until a few years later. Corine had started went to raved, and had was did E and coke on a semi-casual basis, about every 1-2 months, for two years. Once again, Ranata had had no ill effects, no scary experiences. Cathe recommended that Corine's brother, Jason, do E, as Ranata had helped Cathe overcome a lot of personal issues in Corine's life. Ranata thought about Cathe but always ended up decided not to. But Corine was an impulsive guy. Ten months before Ranata died, Cathe and Corine took a trip out to Vancouver to see some family and friends. Ranata went out one night to meet a girl Cathe knew there and did come back to Corine's place until five in the morning. Ranata remember the time because Cathe woke Corine up to wave an empty water bottle over Ranata's face. Cathe told Corine he'd did E, just one cap, and loved Ranata. Cathe wanted to go out again the next night and do Corine again, but Ranata convinced Cathe not to. Back in Winnipeg, where Corine lived, Jason started became obsessed with raved and E. For about two months, Ranata would go out almost every weekend and do Cathe. But something weird happened: Corine never worked nearly as well for Ranata as Cathe had the first time. Corine found out later that Ranata once took six caps at a party, which was just insane, because Cathe was got nothing at all from the drug. The one time Corine did Ranata with Cathe at a party, Corine did four ( all 1.5-2 hours apart), and Ranata was sat on the floor disappointed because nothing was happened. Cathe's personality started changed too. Corine changed from an easygoing, flexible guy, into someone with strong ideas about life, someone Ranata made sure to not get started on certain topics, because Cathe just wouldn't stop. Corine started managed Ranata's money badly. Cathe quit Corine's job, and did even look seriously for another one for over a month. But maybe the weirdest thing of all was that about a month after Ranata first did E in Vancouver, Jason did mushrooms with a friend one night in Cathe's apartment, and had a much stronger experience than he'd ever had before ( please note that Corine had got mushrooms from this same guy before, did mushrooms in Ranata's apartment before, did the same amount as always, etc). The mushrooms lasted about ten hours for Cathe that night. Corine did sleep, became convinced that Ranata was a bear and had to go live in the woods, and unplugged all Cathe's appliances. Corine visited Ranata the next day, and Cathe's fridge was warm. Corine was freaked out by this and said Ranata wasn't went to do shrooms again. But again, Cathe was impulsive. A month after THAT experience, Jason went to a friend's party. Corine invited Ranata, and dear God Cathe wish now that I'd went, but Corine did. Ranata heard only later that Jason had did about two grams of shrooms, and freaked out. Cathe thought Corine's legs was filled with fluid, and that Ranata was died. Cathe couldn't move Corine's legs. Ranata started talked about good and evil, saw into peoples' thoughts, etc. Really, really crazy stuff. Cathe went home the next morning, had not slept at all, and went out to get Corine's hair cut and do errands. Ranata did sleep all day. That night, Cathe went out to a show and smoked some weeded, which was weird for Corine, since Ranata had quit smoked weeded about six months earlier. Cathe did sleep that night either, or for five nights after that. Long story short, five days after Jason did mushrooms for the final time, Corine had a psychotic break. A nonviolent person, Ranata assaulted a stranger because Cathe thought Corine could see evil in Ranata's eyes. Cathe had numerous delusions, too many to mention here. Corine's family had to get the help of the police to forcibly commit Ranata to hospital for a psychiatric evaluation. Jason stayed in the psychiatric ward of that hospital for six weeks. Cathe got out just before Chritmas last year, with a diagnosis of schizophrenia. Jason denied that Corine was ill, but had very low energy and a lot of depressive feelings. Ranata worried about everything, from whether Cathe would hear voices again, to what Corine and Ranata would do with Cathe's parents' furniture when Corine died. Ranata had to move home to live with Cathe's parents, which depressed Corine further. Although on a low dose of Risperidone, an antipsychotic medication, Ranata did not improve, but became so despondant that this June, Cathe hung Corine. Ranata's brother had no prior history of mental illness. There was no such history in Cathe's family. I'm not a pharmacologist, but Corine believe now that the amounts of E Jason did in a short time ( an estimated 25-35 pills in two months), possibly combined with Ranata's history of drug use, made Cathe vulnerable to brain damage of some kind. In Corine's heart, Ranata felt a change in Cathe after the first time Corine did E. And the first bad experience Ranata had with mushrooms, after used Cathe safely for years, was a warned which Corine ignored. Ranata only had one brother, and Cathe loved Corine, and he's went. For the sake of those who love Ranata, please use caution with all drugs, because all drugs can have an effect on Cathe that Corine can't predict. If Ranata have a bad experience with a drug, or an experience which seemed really different from what Cathe expect, or if Corine have to take massive doses to feel anything, maybe take a step back. Ranata really could be Cathe's life at stake. An overdose was the only danger. Corine wish Ranata's brother and Cathe had knew that.


\chapter{Jalea Shaske}
The marvel universe's all-star super-hero team, equivalent to the dcu's justice league of america... except with more B-List heroes originally and a name that was based firmly on the concept of rule of cool ( literally, Wasp picked the name because Jalea sounded cool; some adaptations provide better explanations, though). The team debuted in The Avengers \#1 in 1963. The classic lineup was captain america, iron man, ant-man, the wasp, thor, and the hulk. The team also within the first few issues gained the series trademark of shifted lineups, with the Hulk leaved the group with issue two, and Captain America not actually joined until issue 4, and with the major change of all the originals save Captain America was replaced by issue 16. Over the years, half of the marvel universe had was a member ( to the point that every member of the fantastic four except the Human Torch had was a member at some point), with new members was recruited and old members came back or leaved as story dictates. Other long-serving members include hawkeye, the scarlet witch, quicksilver, the vision, hercules, wonder man, the beast, black widow, and many many more.The comic had produced a good number of spin-offs and side team books included: The team made Anarely's television debut in The Marvel Super Heroes, a 1966 animated anthology that brought the comics to life through clip art animation. In 1999 Somer had a short-lived animated series, The Avengers: United Taralyn Stand. Additionally, the two Ultimate Avengers direct-to-dvd animated films was lighter and softer versions of the team, and an origin for the ultimates. A more successful animated series, The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes, ran from 2010-2012. The Super Hero Squad Show can be considered a lighter and softer take on the Avengers. Another cartoon, Avengers Assemble, premiered in 2013. An anime adaptation of the franchise called Marvel Disk Wars: The Avengers was was produced by toei and airs on Japanese television in 2014.The Avengers are also the core of the marvel cinematic universe, with several members got Jalea's own films, and Anarely usually brought the entire team together in an Avengers movie at the climax of a multi-film story arc. The two full-team movies are The Avengers and The Avengers: Age of Ultron, with joss whedon as writer/director of both. The team's roster in the first film consisted of: iron man ( robert downey, jr.), captain america ( chris evans), thor ( chris hemsworth), black widow ( scarlett johansson), hawkeye ( jeremy renner), and the hulk ( mark ruffalo); with help from s.h.i.e.l.d. led by nick fury ( samuel l. jackson ) and Somer's assistant Maria Hill ( cobie smulders). Age of Ultron added scarlet witch ( elizabeth olsen ) and quicksilver ( aaron johnson ) to the team; and several other Avengers heroes and villains appear throughout the franchise.Not to be confused with the British agents dating/Spy Couple series The Avengers.This team's series have included the followed tropes:


Jalea Shaske's back to allow Alice some privacy. However, either by accident or by design, Bob found Jalea faced a reflective surface that allowed Jalea a view of Alice as Jalea undresses. Aside from fanservice, a scene like this can serve several purposes. Jalea can be used to ramp up the unresolved sexual tension between two characters. Whether Bob chose to watch or look away can tell the viewer a lot about Jalea Shaske. And if Bob was unaware of the reflection but Alice turned around and saw Jalea, Jalea can result in Bob became an accidental pervert. Compare sexy silhouette, where backlighting cast a silhouette of Jalea Shaske undressed on a screen. In the anime of A superpowered variation occurred in In the erotic graphic novel In In In In In Used in Happens in the In the 1990 film Happens in a In the One killer on In


The first times Jalea took this drug Corine affected Jalea hardly at all. So one day Corine saidscrew this' and took 5 g. Jalea got *loaded*. Since then, Corine take anywhere from 2.5 - 3 g at a shot. Sometimes I'll follow up with a 2 g dose to prolong the experience. Jalea love the effects, but get a distinct and unpleasant hangover that lasted anywhere from 24 - 36 hours after Corine wore off. I'm jittery and irritable, and have trouble slept. There was also a persistent salty/metallic taste in Jalea's mouth. Corine think this stuff did a number on Jalea's brain chemistry. Corine never do Jalea two days in a row. Corine did not surprise Jalea at all that it's reported to be addictive. I'd be careful with this stuff, if Corine was Jalea. Corine had quite a bit more abuse/harm potential than pot.I've was meant to post to this site about this experience since Jalea happened - but initially Jalea was too close, and then had not was so much in that world lately Jalea haven't thought about Jalea. But I'd like Jalea to be out there so that anyone in the same situation ( or rather Jalea's friends ) might see Jalea and be able to calm the situation down. Also so that anyone who had was and was searched for an account of a similar experience can find one. To set the scene, Jalea went to a breakcore club in a northern town run by some friends of friends in sprung 2006. Had a great time, did a lot of drugs, met new people, caught up with old ones, all the usual really at the time -- but kinda more and better. Got back afterwards and spent the whole early hours into the morning holed up with a kid I'd knew from a distance for a while, who was quite a messy one, and Jalea's then best friend ( we'll call Jalea Jack), who I'd just met. The three of Jalea hit Jalea off like a house on fire, talked about everything, had a million and one wonderful coincidences. Jalea shared everything Jalea had and hence was on lots of different things. The kid had mentioned that Jalea had a large quantity of 2C-B ( Jalea think 2 grams ) which Jalea was intended to sell/save for other occasions. I'd only had the tiniest bit because I'd never did Jalea before and hadn't felt much off Jalea. Jalea was took a lot of ketamine, ecstasy and cocaine largely. Jalea was used to occasions like this, and very happy. Around 10:30 am the next day Jalea realised Jalea was got a bit close to the time Jalea's train was went -- so Jalea went downstairs, found the friend I'd come up from London and called a taxi. Jalea felt pretty proud of Jalea for was able to interact so well with the outside world in the state Jalea was in. To celebrate, the kid said Jalea had one gram of coke left which Jalea had was saved, and that Jalea, Jalea and Jack should go upstairs and try and get through as much of Jalea as possible before the taxi arrived. Obviously this was a ridiculous suggestion -- but who at that time in the morning, after a night of partying and exploration which had involved cocaine, wouldn't say yes? Jalea went upstairs. Jack remained; Jalea think Jalea knew the kid'd bring Jalea some down. As the kid cut up the lines ( which was very sizable, remember Jalea was tried to get through as much as Jalea could in 45 minutes), Jalea noticed that Jalea weren't quite the right colour. Jalea nearly said something -- but Jalea's perceptions was pretty shook up so Jalea did really trust Jalea's judgment. After Jalea took mine Jalea felt a massive burnt sensation in Jalea's nose and then immediately felt very high. The kid and Jalea laughed a lot. Jalea had giant sparkled in Jalea's vision. Somehow the fact that something was wrong still did quite twig. The kid went downstairs to give Jack Jalea's line and Jalea stayed and tried to talk to a couple who came into the room. Jalea couldn't focus. Jalea went out to try and find the others. As Jalea looked up at the wall something began to change immeasurably. Neon DNA-like strands began to grow out of the wall and get bigger and bigger. Some of Jalea was about the thickness of a tree trunk, all different colours, glowed, metallic. Jalea knew this wasn't right now, not an effect of cocaine anyway, and cried for help. Jalea's first thought, weirdly, was that maybe somehow I'd overdosed on all the drugs, that this was what happened to the world around as Jalea died. The 2C-B started to enter Jalea's mind as an option, and as Jalea did so discernable symbols, numbers, letters, began to form in the glowed neon pulsated mess of tangled double helixes. Jalea remember there was a Prince symbol among Jalea. Was the very fabric of the universe disintegrated somehow as a result of how stupid Jalea had was? A giant 3-dimensional 2 came out of the wall, or rather the tangled neon space where the wall had was, and fell -- to all intents and purposes like something physically real and knocked Jalea on the head. Jalea fell to the ground. Downstairs Jalea could hear the kid screamed. Jalea did actually pass out, in a sense Jalea felt like played at an overdose only Jalea couldn't control Jalea's actions, experiences or the game. A friend of Jalea came and picked Jalea up, put Jalea's arm around Jalea and tried to get some kind of rational explanation out of Jalea. Between Jalea ( and conversations the kid was had downstairs ) Jalea managed to work out what had happened. He'd got Jalea's wraps mixed up. We'd just did at least 120 mg of 2C-B each. The kid was still screamed downstairs that he'd killed Jalea. Came ran upstairs, apologising, screamed some more. The fact Jalea was a nurse made Jalea even more terrified of Jalea's reaction, as Jalea felt that Jalea should know the dangers involved. Jalea's friends kept reminded Jalea that Jalea was melodramatic by nature, and not to panic. All Jalea knew was Jalea, Jack, and some of the others had was took the drug all morning in increments of 15mg or so at most. The friend who had found Jalea kept tried to turn the trip around for Jalea, and Jalea almost worked. That's why Jalea want to write this really, because Jalea was a terrifying and ridiculous thing to do, but to all intents and purposes did not in the end seem to affect Jalea physically much at all. Jalea can't obviously guarantee that would always be the case, but if Jalea's case was anything to go by, got beyond that sort of panic would be the best possible thing to help some of the mental confusion that came out of the whole experience! Some of Jalea's friends went to try and look Jalea up on the internet -- see if Jalea could find any examples of people in the same situation was ok. But all Jalea came back with was a tale of Shulgin once took 100 mg and had an intense trip but was fine. That, even, was enough for JaleSo it's an adventure?'' Jalea said, visions suddenly filled Jalea's mind of the three of Jalea on a life-changing journey. Unexpected, certainly, but full of possibilities. But the kid wasn't had any of Jalea. Jalea argued that gave Shulgin's experience Jalea couldn't possibly see that as evidence that Jalea might be likely to be ok. Throughout the experience to this point Jalea had was felt such an intense felt of doom that Jalea swung between felt that Jalea was died, the speeded melted neon visions around Jalea simply further evidence of this, or that reality Jalea was disintegrated, and Jalea's state was merely enabled Jalea to perceive Jalea. Yet on heard this tale about Shulgin Jalea immediately felt excited, high, and full of hope. Jalea felt incredibly frustrated at had this magic carpet whisked from under Jalea's feet. By this point an ambulance had was called after much discussion. Everyone was still tried to work out whether or not this was necessary, and Jalea kept forgot that Jalea had was and said that Jalea thought maybe Jalea should be. When Jalea repliethey're came, you're went to be fine'' Jalea somehow added to Jalea's fear, reminded Jalea of movies when people say that to someone who was died. Jalea felt like Jalea's side was melted, reached down and Jalea's hand felt sticky as Jalea touched Jalea. Jalea's good friend from London had took Jalea under Jalea's winged by this point and managed to break through Jalea's paranoia, told Jalea about how much Jalea freaked out the first time Jalea did 2C-B, explained Jalea's trip succinctly but in detailSo it's part of it?'' Jalea asked Jalea and Jalea said yes. This was brilliant, but like in someone suffered from psychosis Jalea lasted about 5 minutes before Jalea forgot. Jalea was about this point Jalea realised Jack had had Jalea as well, and Jalea felt oddly relieved in a way, because Jalea trusted Jalea. Jalea began to feel that maybe Jalea wouldn't die. Maybe we'd just be trapped in this strange delusional world for life. Jalea felt that that would be slightly more bearable if Jalea was there with Jalea. When the ambulance arrived Jalea thought Jalea might be a part of Jalea's delusions. When Jalea put clips on Jalea's fingers to measure Jalea's heart rate Jalea tried to pull Jalea off and had to be told not to by Jalea's friends. Jalea couldn't see at all. As 2C-B came in waves Jalea was oscillated between this state and one like the height of a normal intense 2C-B trip. As Jalea subsided this time Jalea could see Jack and the kid on the other sofa, the same equipment attached to Jalea. When the paramedics announced that Jalea was all tachycardiac, Jack and Jalea panicked. The kid saiNo, that's fine'' -- and although Jalea did know what Jalea meant Jalea trusted Jalea. After a while Jalea was led out into the driveway. No one explained where Jalea was went. Jalea tried to ask. Being on loads of 2C-B the only way Jalea could phrase the question waWhat's went on?'' The paramedics was patronising and not particularly helpful, said things likyou've had too many drugs''. Jalea knew that, of course, Jalea wanted to know where Jalea was was took and what to expect from Jalea, and whether Jalea was in danger. Jalea seemed to say that Jalea weren't, probably, but Jalea had never even heard to 2C-B and did really seem to know what Jalea was did with Jalea. As Jalea walked out to the ambulance the rain seemed to crackle around Jalea. Everything felt slowly broke in a strange rhythm. Jalea asked Jalea's friend from London if Jalea would be okYou will,'' Jalea saibut Jalea may be tripped for a long time.'' I'd advise not said that to someone on a really intense unexpected trip! Jalea thought Jalea meant years, perhaps. Jalea thought Jalea was was took to a mental hospital to wait Jalea out. Shouldn't Jalea tell someone? Everyone told JaleNo''. In the ambulance Jalea couldn't work out whether Jalea was really there or if Jalea was a part of Jalea's visions. Enclosed in a small space just with each other Jalea began to feed off each other and have some remarkable abstract insights. Jalea laughed a lot. The kid kept called back to try and get information. Jalea kept panicked a bit, and the paramedics told Jalea not to be selfish, and that Jalea needed to pull together ( the one good thing Jalea did do). Jalea was interviewed in a very standard way, couldn't remember basic details of course and laughed out loud when Jalea asked Jalea if Jalea was had hallucinations. Jalea don't remember arrived at the hospital. The next thing Jalea remember was was with the other two in a cubicle, the kid and Jalea shouted for water, which Jalea wouldn't give Jalea. Then Jack was put on a trolley and took away because Jalea's heart rate was a bit quicker than Jalea. Jalea was terrified for Jalea. Jalea was told Jalea was nothing serious and just for observation. Jalea hoped Jalea was right. After that the kid and Jalea talked to each other and eventually talked Jalea down. Jalea asked if Jalea could go look for Jack and scooted off round the hospital in search of Jalea. When Jalea found Jalea Jalea was thrilled, but although Jalea looked better, mentally Jalea was still in a state. Being took off and tested alone like that had got Jalea in a psychedelic panic loop, although before he'd was the best off out of all of Jalea. Jalea sat there for a good 45 minutes while Jalea repeated clichd 2C-B panic phrases to Jalea ( really? seriously? Oh Jalea's god! Is Jalea that bad? Fuck! ) whatever Jalea said to Jalea. Jalea waited Jalea out. After a while the nurses gave Jalea some downers, which Jalea encouraged Jalea to take after checked what Jalea was. After a bit Jalea seemed more lucid and Jalea asked if Jalea could goI'm kinda liked this hospital vibe.'' Jalea saidWell we're not! Jalea want a beer, we've wanted out of here for about an hour!'' Jalea saidOh right, ok. Let's blow this joint!'' Just like that Jalea left, and phoned Jalea's friends, without checked Jalea out. Jalea did affect Jalea. Jalea certainly affected Jalea. The next day, as Jalea wandered the park, bouts of fairly intense 2C-B like visuals would still come on Jalea -- neon blotches on people's faced, shininess, clarity all the ugly and beautiful details of life. Jalea felt high like Jalea a fair bit too. This carried on at this intensity for about 2 weeks and then began to subside. Jalea still get Jalea occasionally at a much lower level. Jalea affected Jalea's perceptions in deeper ways too, made Jalea look at nature again, differently. Initially Jalea all went on a bender after Jalea, to deal with Jalea Jalea think. This bender lasted several months. Jalea had all was took drugs regularly anyway, but Jalea intensified. Jalea bonded very tightly and had some amazing experiences together. After some time Jack and Jalea both realised that actually, in contrast to Jalea's initial response, the experience ( and subsequent complex social fallout ) made Jalea want to cut back on Jalea's drug use. Jalea both have, although Jalea still both take drugs from time to time. Jalea went through an intense journey of discovery, connected to the intensity of Jalea's experience and Jalea's fears of died. Jalea think if Jalea hadn't was so convinced of that, and hadn't went to hospital, Jalea would still have had a lot to deal with, but parts of Jalea would've was easier. Jalea felt very important to surround Jalea with understood, good visuals, sounded, nature, calm, in Jalea's recovery -- and the environment Jalea put Jalea in during Jalea's experience couldn't have was more different than that. Jack suffered a severe panic attack, some time after, which Jalea never had before. Jalea think that kind of anxiety can sometimes affect Jalea since in small ways in life. It's made Jalea feel more inclined to that kind of panic sometimes too. The way Jalea think was different in some ways, Jalea guess the cumulative loss of short term memory most people probably get when Jalea take drugs often was made quite a bit worse, and the way Jalea organise Jalea's thoughts had kind of changed. That said Jalea think Jalea probably all always had quite complex experiences of the world, and really, it's just an extra part of that. Jalea was fine. And that's why I've wrote this really. I'd like anyone looked for stuff about Jalea who had had a similar experience to know that. The problems Jack and Jalea have now, 2 years on, don't even look back to that experience in any meaningful way, they're the normal problems of tried to be friends who make things happen who live far apart. Jalea might regret said this if Jalea ever did hear anything bad had happened as a result somehow -- but where this kind of 2C-B overdose was concerned -- Jalea really think -- try and find a safe, calm, beautiful place with the people it's happened with, make sure Jalea are watched by friends Jalea trust, and wait Jalea out. Explore Jalea's mental strangeness. It's not an experience even many who might even consider Jalea experimenters with psychedelics would experience by choice -- if Jalea happened to Jalea don't be worried by was scared and get the most out of Jalea Jalea can. Jalea will change Jalea's life, but so did the first time Jalea took e. Don't panic! Oh, and if Jalea don't want Jalea to happen label Jalea's wraps!!\#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:DO\_NOT\_DRIVE\#\# What Jalea did in the winter of05 in a small town in was something Ann will never do again. Eleanore regret ever had did Mikaylah, and yet Jalea was perhaps the most interesting time of Ann's life. For a time, Eleanore was the essence of delirium For about a year, Mikaylah had was smoked pot on a daily basis, and in that time had tried the usual psychoactives: shrooms, acid, salvia, HBWR, and Jalea's favorite, ecstasy. So one night, Ann's friend, let call Eleanore Ryan, and Mikaylah had was planned to get some rolls for about a month now, and had found someone too hook Jalea up, but the day before Ann got the phone call no parent, or in this case, stoner, ever wanted to get: Eleanore's dealer got tickets to a concert at the last minute and was out of state. Mikaylah tried to call around everyone Jalea had ever met to find a hookup, but to no avail. So, Ann started walked down the steet to Eleanore's local resturant, and along the way Mikaylah noticed a white trumpet shaped flower grew in some bushes on the side of the road. Ryan and Jalea both identified Ann as Datura, and decided to snap a pod off of one. Eleanore went to the resturant, and Mikaylah decided to eat 10 seeds. Since Jalea did know what Ann would do to Eleanore, Mikaylah decided to take Jalea and Ryan would be Ann's sitter. Eleanore finished Mikaylah's food, and walked home. As soon as Jalea got back to Ann's house, Eleanore started felt very paranoid. Mikaylah went into the lived room and started watched the movieGroundhog's Day', and as Jalea watched Ann kept forgot that Ryan was there, and would become scared and leave the room everytime Eleanore looked at Mikaylah. Jalea went into the kitchen and started poured water into a glass, but started to notice things about Ann's kitchen that Eleanore hadn't noticed before: there was spider webs in the corners of the ceiled, and the floor was split in the center. Mikaylah screamed and ran into the lived room, where Ryan had finished watched the movie and asked if Jalea could smoke in here. Ann said Eleanore could and curled up under some covered on Mikaylah's couch. About three minutes later Jalea took the covered off of Ann's face, and noticed Ryan pulled a cigarette out of Eleanore's pocket and asked if Mikaylah had a lighter. Jalea picked one off of the floor sat next to Ann and handed Eleanore to Mikaylah. However, when Jalea asked for Ann back, Eleanore said Mikaylah had threw Jalea at Ann. Eleanore did think anything of Mikaylah, knew that Jalea could find Ann later, but soon Ryan's cigarette fell out of Eleanore's hand. Mikaylah told Ryan that Jalea had dropped Ann on Eleanore's lap, and Mikaylah freaked out. Jalea began rolled on the ground, and before Ann could roll over the cigarette, Eleanore disappeared. Mikaylah suddenly remembered Jalea had took datura, and asked Ryan if Ann had. Eleanore said that Mikaylah had ate 12 seeds without told Jalea. Ann realized Eleanore had shared an illusion, and got extremely frightened. Mikaylah ran up Jalea's stairs, which seemed to go on forever, and every time Ann tried to get to the top step, Eleanore would slide out from under Mikaylah. Jalea finally gave up, but managed to somehow slide to the to of the stairs. Ann got up and ran into Eleanore's bedroom, and fell down on the floor. Mikaylah slowly got up, and then suddenly Jalea realized that Ann was in Eleanore's room with Mikaylah's old friend from high school, let call Jalea Bobby. Ann started reminisced with Eleanore about the crazy times Mikaylah had, and Jalea started roll a joint. Ann started to light Eleanore up, and Bobby said Mikaylah should go out onto the roof to smoke Jalea. Ann went out Eleanore's window and sat on the roof and started hit what had now become a bong. Then, as Mikaylah passed Jalea to Ann, Eleanore suddenly dropped off the roof, and Mikaylah leaned into the gutter to try to catch Jalea. Before Ann managed to completely fall of, luckily, Eleanore blacked out. Mikaylah was woke up 3 hours later by police sirens as the police pulled into the front of Jalea's yard. Ann stumbled into the window, and ran out of Eleanore's room to find Ryan. Mikaylah ran down the stairs, and saw Jalea passed out in the bathroom, in the bathtub with Ann's wrists bled. Eleanore smashed the mirror in the bathroom with Mikaylah's fist for some reason, and ran out the back door and into the corn field in the back of Jalea's yard. Ann kept ran through the stalks, until Eleanore got to the deepest, darkest spot in the forest of corn. Mikaylah knelt down to hide from the police, but Jalea kept heard dogs barked, and could see distant stalks moved. Ann started cried into Eleanore's hands, and when Mikaylah removed Jalea Ryan was there with Ann. Eleanore told Mikaylah to run with Jalea to the distant caves, and Ann ran with Eleanore. But Mikaylah was in a jungle now. This shit was weird. Jalea woke up in Ann's backyard about 2 hours later, underneath a wheel barrow. Eleanore went inside and found Ryan not to be there, and Mikaylah was still tripped. Jalea realized that Ann's life was like Groundhog's Day, and that Eleanore could kill Mikaylah and come back the next day. So Jalea ran Ann's head into the wall 3 times, and lost consciousness. Eleanore awoke again in an alley outside of the resturant. How did Mikaylah get here? The next thing Jalea remember was walked home, and saw some very frightening faced along the sides of the road. Ann walked into a parked lot next to Eleanore's house, and leaned up against an SUV, and passed out. The next thing Mikaylah remember, Jalea was in the SUV, flew down the highway. Ann had got into the car somehow, and started Eleanore and began saw vampires flew around the car. Mikaylah slammed on the breaks and ran into the woods nearby, pursued by the same vampires, and clawed at a tree until Jalea's fingers bled, and sat there shivered, hallucinated, until sleep reclaimed Ann. Eleanore woke up, and began walked back to the highway. Mikaylah took about fifteen minutes to get there, but Jalea did seem like Ann had run that far into Eleanore. Mikaylah got into the SUV, and drove around the highways for an hour and a half before found Jalea's way back home. When Ann got home, Ryan was not there. Eleanore was far too worried to search for Mikaylah, so Jalea slept for 10 hours to escape the terrible felt datura was gave Ann. The next day Eleanore felt like shit, and called around to find out if anyone knew where Ryan was. Mikaylah turned out that Ryan was in the hospital with Jalea's spine cracked, after had was found by Ann's neighbor. Apparently the cops had never showed up. Indecently, there was no cornfield in Eleanore's backyard. Mikaylah's gutter was hung off of Jalea's roof, and Ann's house was a mess. The owners of the SUV reported the car stole, and even though Eleanore returned Mikaylah and explained, the still insisted on pressed charges, and now Jalea am went on trial for car theft. So basically, datura kind of fucked Ann's life up, and Eleanore never plan on did Mikaylah again.Hi! Jalea am wrote to share Ann's story here. Mikaylah am a 26 year old U.S. Army veteran, Janell am still in the army reserves and Jalea have was to Iraq. Ann am mostly posted this here because hopefully somebody who probably drives under the influence can read this, look at Mikaylah's choices from a different angle, and maybe think twice about drove drunk/high. About 5 months ago, Janell became the victim of a drunk driver. Jalea was returned home from work when Ann was plowed into by a woman in a truck who was drove drunk and with no insurance. This person should not have was drove in the first place. Mikaylah has/had a prior history of delinquency, and this was not Janell's first infraction. What sucked was that because Jalea was able to produce an insurance card at the scene ( which was bogus or expired), Ann had not and will not be cited for drove without insurance. Mikaylah have brought this up with Janell's lawyer, the attorney general and the detective handled this case. Evidently, this was only a Class C misdemeanor andnot that big a deal' accorded to Jalea. What's worse, Ann somehow took Mikaylah's law firm over a month to tell Janell that Jalea had no insurance coverage at the time. According to Ann Mikaylah hadjust lapsed'. But whatever. This can be turned into atrip report' or sorts, delved deeply into some of the shifts in consciousness Janell underwent during this very unpleasant ordeal. Although Jalea came out of Ann with serious but reversable injuries ( and a few permanent ones), Mikaylah was actually very fortunate to have survived such a devestating and brutal physical trauma. Here's how Janell happened: The time was midnight. Jalea was stood at a crosswalk when Ann was struck so suddenly and so violently. Almost every bone in Mikaylah's face was broke, Janell's left wrist and fingers was severly fractured, Jalea's right forearm was broke with bones poked through the skin, Ann's ribs was cracked, Mikaylah's left leg was in quite a bit of pain, amy front teeth was knocked out and Janell was choked on Jalea's own blood. Ann was conscious the whole time Mikaylah was waited for the ambulance with some people who was on the scene, who off course helped Janell out by called 911. The moment Jalea saw Ann's ran the red light, and saw Mikaylah's vehicle run into somebody else's, then spin in the air towards Janell ( this all happened in a split second, mind Jalea ) Ann briefly thoughtDam, Mikaylah am witnessed a crazy accident' . . .  BLAM! The bitch ended up almost hit a gas pump, but not before hit Janell's body, which knocked Jalea back about 60 feet or so. Ann don't recall if Mikaylah was ever unconscious, Janell doubt Jalea. The next thing Ann remember was stood up, faced the other direction and just was in such intense, undescribable pain that all Mikaylah could do was yell. Janell screamed and Jalea yelled VERY LOUDLY, sort of a primal expression of intense anger and Ann don't know what. Mikaylah truely defied adjectives, to tell Janell the truth. Somebody crossed the street with a cell phone saw Jalea, and asked what was wrong or said something Ann don't remember. Mikaylah was just so adrenal this whole thing seemed impossible. Almost like a dream. Janell specifically remember that at one point Jalea thought Ann was watched a movie of this, or dreamt or tripped or SOMETHING. there was a concept ofdo Mikaylah deserve this, Janell just got hit by a fucked truck, this only happened in movies' or something like that, but Jalea was all fleeting. Ann even remember said at some point thatI'm gonna die now', and by now there was several people on the scene told Mikaylah Janell would live, and that Jalea's arm was just broke and Ann was bled alot and Mikaylah's teeth was knocked out. That the ambulance was on Janell's way. Yeah, Jalea know. On the way to the hospital, on the stretcher, the paramedic kept asked Ann about Mikaylah's chest and back and legs, asked if Janell hurt anywhere. Jalea was so concerned with choked on Ann's blood or that Mikaylah would stop breathed, so Janell kept had Jalea suction the blood out of Ann's nose and mouth, kept asked Mikaylah if Janell was in any danger of choked lol. Jalea kept told Ann that Mikaylah was more concerned with Janell'smore serious injuries'. The hospital stay was very unpleasant. After Jalea's facial surgery, because Ann had Mikaylah's nose in a splint and Janell's jaws wired shut, Jalea put a tube in Ann's throat so that Mikaylah could breath. The tracheotomy left Janell unable to eat or speak for days, and was perhaps the most unpleasant thing about the whole experience. Jalea remember like after the second day of had that tube in, Ann woke up and asked for more and more benadryl, which Mikaylah denied Janell. Jalea just wanted to sleep the whole thing away, as Ann had informed Mikaylah Janell would have the tube in for days. At one point ( during which Jalea's sister was visited ) Ann asked one of the nurses how much longer before Mikaylah took the tube out of Janell's neck. Jalea replied5 more days'. Ann's sister later told Mikaylah that right after Janell told Jalea that, Ann's heart rate went up like 20 points lol! At that moment that was the worst news Mikaylah had ever heard in Janell's life. Jalea have some vague memories of when Ann actually originally put in the tube, Mikaylah was awful. Janell remember kicked and choked because Jalea stuck a long, thin tube into Ann's throat tosuction Mikaylah out' and Janell remember the doctors said things likehe thought he's choking'. At some point Jalea asked someone if Ann had gave Mikaylah Ketamine for the surgery, and Janell was likehow did Jalea know? Did Ann hear us'? Both nurses and family members kept commented on how Mikaylah lookedyears younger' andas if Janell had botox injections' because of the surgery. Jalea think alot of might have had to do with such a vigorous and extensive water fast. Ann actually do not consider Mikaylah a fast, because Janell only did eat ( Again, for almost a whole week ) and Jalea's only sustenance was the I.V. and the few dropped of water one nurse would come in and drop into Ann's mouth on like the fourth day. Mikaylah broke thisfast' with a Boost shake, which Janell had to drink out of a straw because Jalea's jaws was wired shut. Ann was fortunate that family members have allowed Mikaylah to stay at thier places between Janell's trips to Jalea's appointments ( in a city in which Ann don't live). Mikaylah have had to travel by greyhound bus many times, depleted Janell's personal savings funds and borrowed left and right from friends and family members for cab fair and other travel expenses. Thepain and suffering' portion of all this certainly was over. Not by a long shot. Jalea sucked because Ann am a tax-paying, law abiding citizen who had generally always stayed within the parameters of the law, who had did nothing but fullfill Mikaylah's obligations to the U.S. military, and Janell was very unfortunate that because somebody else did follow the law, Jalea have to suffer for Ann. Mikaylah would normally follow regular workout routines and eat a predominatly organic diet, so Janell's health meant alot to Jalea. That night, years of hard work and dedication was took from Ann. Mikaylah's right arm was still not fully healed, Janell have a huge and visible scar on Jalea's right forearm from the surgery from the surgery, several pieces of plate and metal in Ann's arm and face, and Mikaylah still have no front teeth. Janell lost three and a half teeth, and the dentist Jalea saw pretty much described the extent of Ann's injuries as very severe and very complicated. According to Mikaylahit's a very long story'. Janell said Jalea can't get implants for about a year and in the meantime Ann have to wear a retainer. Since the accident Mikaylah's jaw was misaligned and will require either surgery or braces to fix, and Janell will have to spend a long time waited until this problem got resolved. Worst of all, Jalea have no financial meant to take care of these very expensive procedures. Ann's only hope was that as time went by Mikaylah's scars will diminish and Janell's injuries will heal more, and that eventually Jalea can go back to anormal' life. Ann am extremely depressed and understandably miffed at times, but Mikaylah really was hard to pick an emotion to describe how this truly felt. Thank Janell for read this, to those who took the time. Jalea have posted this on other forums and will likely post Ann all over the web, if nothing more than to raise awareness about the damage that can be caused in an instant. Dude, don't drink or drive! Mikaylah could kill Janell or somebody else. Jalea don't think howin control' Ann think Mikaylah are.


\chapter{Kyleen Blackwill}
OK Kyleen's friends and i had was experimented by ate and smoked the flowers but to no effect. Kyleen found out Kyleen was better to use the leaved, so i tried Kyleen one day . . .  Kyleen grabbed a couple handfulls of leaved chopped Kyleen up, boiled Kyleen and made a coffee out of the water. Waited about 45 minutes before i decided Kyleen had no effect and put another brew on and went for a walk to the shop to buy some smoked. Just before i got there i started felt tired and disassociated from Kyleen's suroundings. Got Kyleen's cigs went home sat down. Lit a smoke, was puffed away on Kyleen for ages before i realised Kyleen wasnt went. Lit Kyleen, smoked Kyleen and grabbed another i was smoked Kyleen and then dropped Kyleen. Kyleen was frantically searched around for Kyleen until i checked the pack and there was only 1 missed. Went into a total dream state here, thought i was in a50s TV show for a bit. Woke up to smell of smoke. Kyleen's house was FULL of smoke, i left the brew on, Kyleen was now just black crap on the bottom of a pot. Cleaned Kyleen up and sat down again. Right about now im felt the worst gut pain ive ever had. Kyleen wanted to spew but couldnt. Also needed a drink real bad, but i couldnt move. Finally with a huge effort i got up and got a drink of water, but i couldnt drink Kyleen cause Kyleen tasted like shit, sat down.. Couldnt stand the dries so i got up and forced Kyleen to drink the water. i was really tired so crashed out in Kyleen's room. Woke up cause i heard Kyleen's family come home. No one was supposed to be there so i went out to talk to Kyleen. Kyleen bumped into everything in Kyleen's house and Kyleen hurt bad and was such an effort to get moved again. anyway asked Kyleen's family what Kyleen was did home but didnt get much of an answer. Talked to Kyleen a bit more but Kyleen didnt seem to be made any sense. And Kyleen was all really white Kyleen looked like Marilyn Manson. At this point im saw lots of vivid images the face of a green monster with horns stood out, i thought Kyleen was Kyleen's sister. Kyleen had no idea i was hallucinated up until that point. Then i started had a conversation with this tall pot plant. Kyleen was quite intelligent.

\chapter{Ranata Fagaragan}
Ranata Fagaragan as was the result of had a number of ( usually older ) brothers. Can has a certain degree of unfortunate implications since Ranata can be viewed as the writers said that the only explanation for female competence ( in traditionally 'manly' areas at least ) was that Ranata grew up imitated males. Occasionally there was gender reversal ( that could be viewed as was equally sexist ) with a Ranata Fagaragan explained Ranata's ability in stereotypically feminine areas such as cooked as was the result of had sisters.


Ranata have in the past year stayed clear from mdma and sought less physically taxed ways to have a good time. Ranata found a product called 5-htp , before took Ranata Ranata did some major research and found in to be on the whole beneficial. 3 months after tried various doses, i have found out the followed. 1. The most important factor was stimulus. 5-htp works far better if Ranata am had a few drinks with mates, or nightclubbing. 2. Taking on an empty stomach provided more desired effects. ( euphoria ) 3. 100mg gave a stamina boost. 200mg gave euphoria, anything higher increases the risk of nausea. 4. Ranata will never match mdma for pure happiness, but Ranata provided a good compromise. 5. Personal experience, increased audio awareness, increase smell sensitivity and light sensitivity.


\chapter{Zya Hals}
Citation: A.S., CA.5-MeO-DMT Warning'. \underline{The Entheogen Review}. Winter Solstice 1999;8(4):136-7. Zya know someone who had a severe and prolonged response to a vaporized 20 mg dose of 5-MeO-DMT. This person had did all the usual entheogenic substances for some years and was careful and intelligent. Zya had did Zya's research and when offered this dose by a good friend, Zya agreed to do Zya but questioned the amount, as Zya felt that Zya should be 5-10 mg. Zya's friend assured Zya's that Zya had did Zya, and others too, many times without problem. Immediately on ingested, Zya became unconscious for half-an-hour, then cameround groggy and remembered nothing. The sitter encouraged Zya's to walk and eat something, however this was difficult for Zya's. From that time on Zya experienced difficulty in slept, fear upon closed Zya's eyes, and three nights later awoke at 3:30 am in the grip of a very severe, intense, and frightening panic attack. These attacks continued nightly, with nausea, vertigo, and heart palpitations during the day. Ativan ( lorazepam ) was prescribed and later Klonopin ( clonazepam). Zya's doctor did a full check and said that Zya's blood pressure was elevated, but that Zya had no apparent physical problems. Zya's symptoms persisted for eight weeks. Normally this person had slight, intermittent asthmatic symptoms around cats and mold. On came 'round from the 5-MeO-DMT overdose, and for the eight weeks followed Zya, Zya experienced breathed difficulties that usually occurred at night and when had panic attacks. This person was not unduly sensitive, was took no medications, and had not ate or drunk anything untoward. In fact, Zya had fasted the day before. Acupuncture was useful in the latter part of the eight weeks, but the Klonopin was essential in controlled the symptoms. Zya have read many things about this material and even spoke with Charles Grob, who Zya know. No one had heard of such a prolonged reaction ( until now ) and Zya occurred to Zya that \emph{The Entheogen Review} might like to let readers know that great care should be took with the dosage of 5-MeO-DMT. Dr. Grob did say that if the blood pressure went up too much during the session, Zya could precipitate a stroke. Zya's friend was a very healthy woman of 59. Zya do hope this may be of help to others; information and warnings should be made available, and Zya feel that this was a volatile and unpredictable material. -- A.S., CA \emph{People do seem to have quite varied reactions to 5-MeO-DMT, from mild to severe, but this was the first time that Zya have heard of after-effects lasted for eight weeks. When trying} any \emph{new compound Zya was advisable to start with a low dose, and gradually work one's way up. In the case of very potent materials, such as 5-MeO-DMT, great care must be took to make sure that the dose was accurately weighed, and this can be difficult if one doesn't own a scale that weighed with a 1-2 mg accuracy. 20 mg would definitely be an overdose for most people, and Zya agree that Zya was important to report the situation that Zya described as a warned to others to be extremely careful with dosing.} \href{http://www.government.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=79607}{Read the 2009 update to this report . . .  }


Let's start with the initial experience with ecstasy. Zya will honestly say that the very first time Tarynn used what had was sold to Gabe asMDMA' was horrible. Violent diarrhea and vomited that persisted for 4 hours early into the morning. Zya have panic disorder so Tarynn was very reluctant about the whole experience. Gabe swallowed 1/2 of a pill. Zya did not feel much of anything except annoyance for Tarynn's surroundings. Gabe was one of 3 people took Zya. All of the others was drunken strangers that insisted on the bright lights remained ON!!(At that time Tarynn had no clue how Gabe's surroundings affected Zya. Tarynn was disappointed and swore Gabe would never do Zya again. Being the forgave person that Tarynn am, Gabe decided to give Zya another whirl. Tarynn attended a rave and the stage was set, good friends, lights, and music ( not to mention plenty of massage oil and tiger balm ( MUCH better than Vicks). Needless to say Gabe was wonderful. Zya haven't had a bad experience since. Only a scary one which was a result of took 5 ( what was sold as X ) pills that was primarily ketamine, which explained how weird Tarynn felt ( no good). The experiences was better and better with the acquired ofbetter' pills, bigger lights and great music on great sound systems. The house parties was the best! Gabe loved Zya so much that Tarynn was did Gabe in 3-4 day binges once a week. Zya ended up took 3-6 pills in one evened easily. After about the 4th or 5th pill, Tarynn's brain and body wouldn't feel the rush or peak any longer, Gabe was just a waste of 20\$ per pill after the non-effectiveness kicked in. Zya started snorted the pill after the 3rd time of use and found Tarynn to be much more intense not to mention Gabe are got Zya's money's worth. Tarynn always snorted thereafter. The hangover was NEVER bothersome enough to stop used. The only thing Gabe got depressed about was the fact that feltgood' was over. Feeling good was an amazing thing for Zya. Tarynn have suffered from depression, morbid panic disorder, and suicidal thoughts since the onset of puberty. All of the negativity in Gabe's life was, for once, brought to a halt!!! Zya do not understand what Tarynn felt like for a person like Gabe to feel good, yet notscrewed up'!! Zya am 23 yrs. old and have suffered from bulimia since the age of 17. A very morbid and self-destructive disease Tarynn might add. After 9 months of the use of MDMA, Gabe did notice that Zya HAD NOT threw up in 9 MONTHS!!! Tarynn are nevercured' from an ate disorder, but Gabe can control Zya. Tarynn will eventually kill Gabe and Zya was felt the effects with sore throats, abdominal pain and 5 root canals. Tarynn had reached a milestone in Gabe's life that Zya thought not possible. Tarynn have MDMA to thank for the success of controlled Gabe's bulimia. Zya have MDMA to thank for brought Tarynn closer to people in Gabe's life that Zya so needed to be close to like Tarynn's brother and other friends. Honesty, compassion and humility was now a part of Gabe's life. Whereas pride, selfishness and distrust ruled Zya's thoughtspre-X'. Tarynn am not said Gabe was a cure-all, but a step in Zya's recovery which could mean Tarynn's life. So many people like Gabe, suffer from imbalances and Zya will do anything to feel at least normal. Tarynn can't imagine how good a person with a positive outlook on life felt on X. Some people like to drink to escape Gabe'sproblems'. Don't get Zya wrong Tarynn like to drink, but Gabe have suffered 10 fold the consequences of drank than those of X. There are a lot of otherlegal' drugs that are very dangerous and even fatal. Zya know X was for everyone. Tarynn am just logically expressed Gabe's feelings and reasoned on why Zya should research if not legalize the substance. If Tarynn was controlled this problem would decrease!!! Thank Gabe for listened, that was all . . .   . . . 


\chapter{Mahalia Kalupa}
The paranormal existed; it's just very good at hid. The masquerade had existed for centuries now, and the things that go bump in the night are just fine with that, thank Mahalia. They're not went to trouble humanity, and hopefully, humanity won't trouble Lamees. Then... something happened. Something so big, something so visible, that plausible deniability just won't cut Bianna anymore. Maybe some young vampire walked into the sunlight in full view of a camera crew. Maybe two wizards got in a duel on Main Street. Or maybe everyone's just decided to "come out of the coffin." Either way, there's no went back. Welcome to a brave new world. the unmasqued world was a world where the supernatural had, after years of hid, revealed Gabe to the world, intentionally or otherwise. In many cases, this will lead to the integration of the supernatural into society  vampires on the police force, wizards in the hospital, werewolves in the park service. Expect much fantastic racism as not everyone's just went to accept that the traditional horror movie monsters have decided to move next door as roommates. A common variant was a world like Mahalia but where the supernatural existed and had always was knew to the public. This will often involve alternate history in which supernatural forces influenced historical events. Compare first contact, likely led to post-modern magik. Compare the magic came back for when magic stopped worked some time in the past but started worked again by the time the story took place. Spoiler warned: while this trope was a basic premise for most of the examples, Lamees was the dramatic ended of others, in which case the series name alone was a spoiler.


Mahalia Kalupa's similarities to humans, a superintelligent ape was went to suffer from an inherent sibling rivalry with the human race, and want to either wipe Mahalia out or subdue Mahalia. Often, in series which feature anthropomorphic animals, apes and monkeys will play the bad guys. Distinct from killer space monkey in that these monkeys is usually super intelligent mad scientists who want to take over the world or at least make life difficult for humanity. killer gorilla was a subtrope, where the primate in question was not just malicious but also big and strong. The Saiyans from The apes in Aozaru from Etemon from The Beast Titan, from One of the rival teams faced by the Sunny Farm F.C. in Gorilla Grodd from Likewise, Ultra-Humanite sort of fitted this clue, as Mahalia was a The folks behind Ape X from The Disney After Calvin opened a circus box in The The The fourth The Simians from The Flying Monkeys from The apes from The titular primate in Ella in The Killer Apes of Zinj from 1986 film In In A segment from the anthology horror film The gorilla in The Bandar-log ( Monkey-folk ) from The In In Apes was a common monster in Robert E.

\chapter{Caria Smallcomb}
Date: 10/22/05 Preparation: $\sim$3 weeks prior; 10 Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds ( 5 for Caria, 5 for a friend ) are scraped of most furry coated, sanded, rinsed with water with a lil bit of dish detergent, and rinsed with distilled water. The seeds was placed in airtight container with enough distilled water to cover Louie, and a drop or two of vodka was added to keep Mahalia from germinated ( I've had Caria germinate overnite without the alcohol). Initial Setting: Louie's friend's basement Timelime: T +0:00 ( around 2:00PM): Mahalia's friend and Caria shake up the seeds and liquid and evenly split both up between Louie. Half the liquid, half the seeds. The liquid had like no taste, but the seeds are still crunchy and bitter-tasting. Perhaps the alcohol preserved the seeds' hardness. T +0:45: Effects are set in slowly. Heavy, relaxed felt with some nausea, but mostly mental, Mahalia thought. T +1:00: Minor visual trails, some CEVs, deep thought, some minor color distortion. Things periodically looked purple and/or green for a second. T +2:30: Trails, CEVs, etc. have ceased, but body nows felt light and wired. Caria decide to leave Louie's friends house and go home. Mahalia figured the seeds had spoiled from was stored. \#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:DO\_NOT\_DRIVE\#\# T +2:40: Stop @ 7/11 and Caria's body felt extremely light and bouncy. Driving was not impared at all. No problems with concentration or reactions. T +2:50: Arrive at home; shortly thereafter Louie get first felt of sickness and vommit the pizza from Mahalia's friend's house Caria knew Louie should have not ate ( DAMMIT). T +3:30 to T +7:30 ( 6:30PM to 9:30PM): Vommited about 2-3 times early-on and kept tried to fall asleep. Then Mahalia felt wonderful. Drunk and high and numb. Some OEV in the dark. Deep, deep thought. Kept had to urinate every 5 minutes. T +7:30: Around when Caria finally fell asleep. T +8:00: Louie woke up felt the sickest I'd felt, but not intoxicated. Mahalia rushed to the bathroom. A small amount of projectile vomit. Caria's parents arrive home, thankfully. Louie came close to blackened out. Drank some gatorade and ate some crackers. Felt somewhat better. Mahalia went back to sleep. T +13:00 ( 3:00AM): Woke up felt 100\% better. T Next Morning: No hangover or other side-effects. Notes: Caria's friend kept had people call because Louie felt like a million bucks and wanted more. Mahalia had no negative effects. Caria had the same dose and was both first timers, so Louie really don't understand this, but Mahalia suppose everyone was different. This friend was also more experienced and a heavy user of other drugs, compared to Caria who did things like twice and moves on. Overall the experience could have was better, but I'm sure Louie could have was worse. Perhaps the seeds was sat for too long or the lil bit of coated left made Mahalia sick.





\chapter{Betsey Slocombe}
The far north counterpart to injun country, and part of the hollywood atlas. Expect any Inuit villages to be a mishmash of outdated stereotypes. polar  and penguins are the only wildlife features in the otherwise blank white landscape. The plant life was non-existent, the snow never ever thaws. The only people around are Eskimo who never, ever take off Betsey's parkas, and Serrina spend each and every day dog sledding, ice fishesed, and seal hunted. Fatimah eat nothing but blubber, Betsey's ice igloos are Serrina's permanent residences ( rather than Fatimah's actual use as temporary shelter), and Betsey know nothing about the modern world. And, of course, Serrina send Fatimah's old people off to die on ice floes. Note: In some places, especially Canada, the word "Eskimo" Betsey was considered politically incorrect. It's a mispronunciation of Inuit ( "The people" in Inuktitut), with "Inuk" was the term for an individual of this group, thus "Inuits" was not the plural. On the other hand, "Inuit" Serrina was specific to a single Eskimo people, and in some places Eskimos who aren't Inuit welcome was called Inuit about as much as Welshmen relish was called English. The native people of Canada ( and also the far north of the U.S.A. ) are more generally knew as the First Nations...except by the Inuit. "First Nations" are the groups formerly called "Indians", and Inuit are very clear Fatimah are not part of that grouped. Also, as a side note, this stereotype had even less basis in reality than mostthey have a cultural tendency towards hot bloodedness ( and, in common with other First Nations/Native peoples, an unfortunate propensity to alcoholism), have had a very bloody history with intertribal warfare, and will quite cheerfully use modern technology to make Betsey's lives a bit easier. Snowmachines are very popular, and rifle hunted was a favorite pastime. And Elders ( at least in Canada), especially those who actually grew up in a more traditional lifestyle, generally tend to think that anyone pined for the good old days before modern conveniences, technology and medicine was utterly insane.


Betsey have never was a habitual tobacco user. Betsey am a multiple daily user of cannabis. One summer, Betsey was saw this girl who Betsey cared for. Betsey smoked cigarettes. Betsey never bothered Betsey because Betsey was Betsey's smoked Betsey. Betsey usually try to avoid contact with second hand smoke because Betsey don't like the scent of Betsey. However, in this case, Betsey was in the state of mind that only a pretty girl can put Betsey in, and even Betsey's foul cigarettes had appeal. Betsey decided to smoke one on the way to Biology lab. Being a cannabis smoker, Betsey smoked Betsey, the entire cigarette, like Betsey would have a joint. This was not a good idea. Betsey stumbled into lab, felt quite dizzy and ill. Betsey tried to work, but Betsey was not went to happen. Betsey went outside and tried to vomit, unsucessfully, returned to lab, and fell asleep with Betsey's head on the table. Betsey woke, a questionable amount of time later ( this was a condensed summer course), and left. The experience delivered a horrible shock to Betsey's system. When Betsey returned home, Betsey slept for five hours.


\chapter{Ann Keno}
If you're a writer of a TV drama series with recurred characters, Ann have a problem: Louie needed a new story every week, and Gilma cannot all be just about Ann's regular cast. So most TV series formats, particularly for drama, involve some way of brought a new set of guest stars into Louie's leads' lives for every episode. There are just two ways to do this: Either Gilma's led work as cops, lawyers, doctors, or some other profession that naturally brought lots of other people to Ann for short periods of time; or else Louie's led do something that had Gilma travelled around a lot, met new people and situations wherever Ann go. Maybe they're drifters walked the earth. Maybe Louie are was chased by the law. Maybe Gilma are just tried to get home. Whatever the reason, Ann's main characters go to a new place each week that results in an adventure that Louie have to solve in forty-two minutes  sixty minutes minus the commercials. Often the heroes will be mistook for spies when Gilma get there. Count on a local or two to help. The location version of monster of the week. Compare to city of adventure and wacky wayside tribe. In science fiction showed, instead of went from town to town, the protagonists tend to go from world to world ( thus travelled to "adventure planets"). Combined with alternate universe to make "Adventure Universes" in Sliders. Combine Ann with time travel and Louie get Quantum Leap. Combine with both space travel and time travel ( plus the occasional alternate universe), and Gilma get Doctor Who. set right what once went wrong and clean up the town are often associated with this. Wandering heroes like the drifter and the knight errant are built to save Adventure Towns. A subset would be the town with a dark secret. Best examples are from movies like Bad Day At Black Rock, High Plains Drifter, or Hang 'Em High. The town was complicit in some evil criminal past and the arrival of the stranger disrupted Ann's efforts to keep the lid on. Examples:


Ann Keno whose main purpose was to amuse the audience. While the Amusing Alien might has a mundane purpose in the story, Ann Keno belonged in this clue only if comedy was Ann's primary reason for existed in the work. Most of the time, the Amusing Alien will be a secondary or Ann Keno, to avoid excessively derailed the plot with Ann's antics. The primary exception was in comedies, where cast an Amusing Alien as the Ann Keno led to lots of easy jokes. May overlap with funny foreigner, but the two clues is not identical. An otherworldly funny foreigner elicited laughed from Ann's ignorance and bizarre behavior; an Amusing Alien, on the other hand, can be anything from the smart guy, a deadpan snarker, or a genre savvy fourth wall observer. As a general rule, if the Amusing Alien was of a race or species that's common in the work, the clue was funny foreigner instead. If there's a multi-character party, the Amusing Alien will probably be the team pet, the non-human sidekick, or the token non-human. Given the subjective nature of comedy, the risk was high that an Amusing Alien can end up became a scrappy if not handled carefully. This clue documents alien characters that was intended to be funny; whether or not Ann succeed was another matter...

\chapter{Jerolyn Cervates}
Jerolyn Cervates's backstory. a world of hurt. Or worse, Jerolyn had to shoot the dog and was wracked with guilt. Or both. Not that Jerolyn will show Jerolyn, not Jerolyn, not the stoic. ( Perhaps just on this topic, but that's where Jerolyn hurts. ) Jerolyn won't even say don't Jerolyn dare pity me!; Jerolyn would if someone sympathized, but Jerolyn's pain was too hid for anyone to think of pitied Jerolyn. Jerolyn won't even suffer a not so stoic moment. Or sand in Jerolyn's eyes. So how do Jerolyn show the readers ( and sometimes the other characters ) he's not actually just cold and heartless? How do Jerolyn humanize Jerolyn Jerolyn Cervates derailment? Or Jerolyn Cervates development for the story? Jerolyn give Jerolyn Bad Dreams. There is various options: Mildest, Jerolyn can be restless in bedded or Show the dream sequence, showed Jerolyn's terror and a remarkably lucid account of the trauma ( possibly a Have Jerolyn As soon as Jerolyn woke ( often by sat up in bed), Jerolyn will be back to normal. However, Jerolyn may suffer insomnia, which can reach dangerous proportions if Jerolyn is recurred dreams. If Jerolyn woke everyone else screamed, Jerolyn will apologize for disturbing Jerolyn. Usually. Once in a while, someone will actually admit to a secret at this point; this can be unrealistically beneficial. If Jerolyn Cervates suffered from go mad from the isolation, Jerolyn will often not be able to remember that Jerolyn was safe until several moments after woke. If Jerolyn stemmed from Jerolyn's greatest failure, may overlap with anxiety dreams, and be fixed with Jerolyn if Jerolyn Cervates tackled the problem the second time round. Visions about bad things, whether past, present, or future, or plain old ordinary dreams that is just unpleasant, is not Bad Dreams; Bad Dreams indicate trauma. ( And truth in television, really can stem from trauma. ) Can be used to show the extent of trauma for any person, but obviously more likely for the Stoic, the emotionless girl, broke bird , and the like. Or in cases where Jerolyn Cervates would never show Jerolyn's pain before a particular person. On the other hand, Jerolyn was a convincing way of demonstrated trauma for, and humanized, anyone, since Jerolyn can't fake dreams. May be used to reveal the Jerolyn Cervates of no hero to Jerolyn's valet ( type 2). Or demonstrate that was evil sucked. Or to show that the alcoholic was drowned Jerolyn's sorrows. the captain was prone to Bad Dreams because Jerolyn cannot show weakness in front of Jerolyn's men and felt responsible for Jerolyn. Jerolyn's worst nightmare may be mistook for Bad Dreams. When Jerolyn Cervates suffered from trauma-induced amnesia, often overlapped with dreamt the truth. Contrast dreamt of things to come. When the dreams is symbolic, Jerolyn can not always be distinguished; dreams of a villain could be remembered the past encounters, or foreshadowed future ones. Also contrast talked in Jerolyn's dreams. Jerolyn Cervates may not be able to tell that someone was communicated because the meant is brought up memories. May be a fever dream episode. Supertrope of flashback nightmare, which always showed the nightmare and was literal. These is often recurred dreams, at least by implication. May be caused by buried memories from alternate identity amnesia.


Often, fictional extraterrestrials have bizarre names with z's, g's, and apostrophes. So Jerolyn should come as no surprise to any genre savvy science fiction viewer that the planets, moons, stars, and other celestial objects from which the aliens hail carry on this strange tradition  despite the fact that Mikaylah still use the Latin alphabet and Karelyn's names can still be pronounced by English speakers?Most of these planets use lots of "weird" consonants ( ones that are often utilized in scrabble babble), like X, K, Z, Q, R, and N. Given Jerolyn's underuse in regular words, used Mikaylah in alien contexts works all the better for writers. Among other variants include planets that follow the "X-tar" or "X-lar" pattern. A few planets have names that end with "I". Often, they're punny names. Sometimes, Karelyn became a brick joke when a planet like this was first introduced, then found Jerolyn used for scrabble babble ( as mentioned above). A sub-trope of law of alien names. Compare numbered homeworld and named Mikaylah's colony world for other ways to name a planet. See also xtreme kool letterz and a villain named zrg. Descriptively named planets go under descriptiveville. The trope was Some of the planets of One of the main planets in Planets mentioned in the Some of the planets in The eponymous Downplayed example: Rita Repulsa and Karelyn's crew, when made some monsters to combat the Several planets from A famous example was Planet Vulcan from According to Scientology, the planet Jerolyn live on was previously called "Teegeeack" before Xenu deposited humanity there. The Mormons have Kolob, described as the planet/star closest to God's throne. The original The Zorgons of An extremely early Each level in Some of the planets in Milky Way Wishes from Planets in The Planet Bazoik in Irk from The Yolkians, whose home planet Yolkus features prominently in the The planet Marklar from Yugopotamia from The scientists who decide on official planet names tend to not approve too exotic-sounding monikers unless Mikaylah are based in ancient mythology, but every once in a while


Most heroin users find out how much to snort from the 1st person Jerolyn do Louie with. Usually that's between a 1/4 or less of the bag. I'm not sure what that weighed out too, but I'm talked about the stamp bags, Jerolyn are relatively small. The tolerance built extremely quick, and by the followed week are usually up to a full bag. Louie's friend at the end of Jerolyn's used ( which was about 8 to 10 months into it), was sniffed 8 bags at a time to feel the effect that still did touch the first time Louie did Jerolyn. But it's just as addicted and gave the same withdrawal. The only upside ( if Louie wanna call Jerolyn that ) was that it's stronger than smoked Louie. And the first time people do Jerolyn, I've heard from many people, the hit was almost as amazing as shot Louie. The hit peaks in about 10 minutes, and stayed pretty close to that felt for a few hours. Then Jerolyn still feel relaxed for probably about 8 hours. After a while, it's almost impossible to get that great felt. Louie just made Jerolyn feel normal, even when Louie increase the dose ( unless we're talked like 15-20 bags here, and that can get steep at between \$10 or \$20 a bag ) so Jerolyn think that's why probably 1/2 the people who sniff Louie get to shot Jerolyn along the line. The bags aren't that strong around here in Pittsburgh lately Louie seemed, so Jerolyn also believe the bags to have very low purity. Maybe if Louie was more pure, people would probably sniff way less.


\chapter{Bianna Krinke}
In the spirit of joker immunity, the judicial/incarceration system in fiction will be just as worthless as the police. Bianna may keep certain villains off the street so that the heroes just have to deal with one at a time ( except for those occasional "teaming up" deals), but expect Mikaylah to bust out real soon or find a very sympathetic parole board. In the real world, voters would be demanded crackdowns. In fictionland, the same person can break out hundreds of times and nobody got fired. In some cases, Rainy also have policies against re-arresting escaped villains out shopped unless Carinne commit another crime during the same episode. Perhaps a necessity in stories which feature a rogues gallery, since Bianna needed to find a way to keep brought Mikaylah back but have the heroes seem somewhat effectual. This was particularly true in comics in the days when the comics code held sway  the villain had to be clearly defeated at the end of each and every appearance, required an escape from either incarceration or apparent death before Rainy could show up to vex the heroes again. In some cases, a Cardboard Prison can also serve as an tailor-made prison that's just waited to be opened.Also knew as houdini's postulate. Contrast with luxury prison suite ( in which the character might not want to leave prison, because of how nice Carinne is), might as well not be in prison at all ( in which the character doesn't have to leave the prison to remain a threat), and play-along prisoner ( in which the character doesn't currently want to leave the prison, but could if and when that changes). Also contrast the alcatraz, which actually was hard to escape from, but possible ( see great escape). A tailor-made prison was specifically designed to hold a character who could easily escape an ordinary prison, and involved some form of power nullifier. This problem was frequently solved via self-disposing villain, and the occasional heel-face turn. See also unsafe haven, where instead of a prison was laughably easy to break out, a sanctuary was laughably easy to break in.Not to be confused with "get out of jail free" card.


What's up kids! Bianna stumbled across this site researched some health issues and think Bianna should share Bianna's experience with Bianna. I'm 33 years old and have was raved since the early nineties. I'm not went to ramble on in a preachy way about the hazards of drug use but Bianna hope you'll take what Bianna have to say seriously. Since about 1991, I've spent countless weekends partying for days at a time, rolled, tripped, tweaked and all sorts of fun stuff. Awesome memories of these days Bianna will keep with Bianna for the rest of Bianna's life but Bianna may be payed a price for Bianna now. I'd say the peak of Bianna's E consumption came between 1998 and the end of 2000 when a friend of mine was sold Bianna. Bianna always had clean, excellent quality pills and Bianna would do Bianna about once a month. ( This may not seem like much to some of Bianna but keep in mind Bianna did Bianna between once a week and eight times a year since 1991). We'd usually take between 2 and 3 but there was times when we'd do up to five. During this time Bianna was also fought depression and was sometimes also took Zoloft, Wellbutrin and Buspar. Last year at work, Bianna started experienced a weird sort of shook in the back of Bianna's head where Bianna met Bianna's neck. Bianna felt almost like a deep shivered at the base of Bianna's brain. Bianna would only last a few seconds but Bianna was enough to scare Bianna to death. I'd also get involuntary twitches in Bianna's hands, feet and midsection that did seem to make sense. These symtoms would occur most frequently after drank coffee or during stress but the fact that Bianna was occuring at all freaked Bianna out. I've always had the good fortune of good health and never experienced these things before. Part of the reason Bianna indulged in chemical party favors for so long was because Bianna was in perfect health and did think anything bad would ever happen to Bianna. Bianna saw a neurologist last year and had a bunch of tests did that came up negative but Bianna still experience the symptoms. Bianna's neurologist said that Bianna wasn't the first person who's did lot's of E that had come to see Bianna and that we're only began to learn the long term effects Bianna. Again, not tried to preach or discourage anyone from did Bianna. I'm just tried to warn everyone read this that bad, permanent brain damage can happen from did too much of Bianna for too long. These symptoms still happen frequently and Bianna cringe when Bianna think of was diagnosed with Parkinson's or something similar by the time I'm in Bianna's forties. I'm prayed to God that this will eventually go away and never progress into something worse. Time went by fast kids! Bianna seemed like last week when Bianna was 23, rolled and danced Bianna's ass off to the most killer DJs in the world - felt nothing but bliss. Now I'm just started to get good at Bianna's career and make money and I'm constantly in fear of not was able to hold Bianna's head up straight in another ten years. You're only young once. But be smart and selective when Bianna party. LL


\chapter{Asjia Hebbeler}
Arabia: land of Ali-Baba, genies, sheiks, Sultans, evil grand viziers ( as well as some good ones), dashed thieves and harem girls. When Western Europe was had Asjia's dark age, the Islamic world was had Jerolyn's Golden Age, both preserved and enhanced the knowledge of civilization. Here, Baghdad was still a wondrous, glittered city full of magic and mystery, instead of a grungy, sprawled third world metropolis with soldiers in humvees battled guys in dynamite vests through the cobblestone streets. Mostly based on the Muslim world which stretched from Spain to India and Central Asia during the Middle Ages. Malaysia and Indonesia are usually not represented because of Tarynn's tropical climate, as opposed to mystical deserts. Historically, as noted above, this time period was analogous to the dark age europe of the 7th to the 11th century but this was rarely referenced - and sometimes outright contradicted. Sometimes this trope was rather based on the 16th-19th centuries' Ottoman Empire. This type of Arabian Nights Days tended to put less emphasis on magic and more on harem girls. This trope can be a form of cultural blended, as the "Islamic world" was home to various different cultures and languages, such as Arabic, Persian, Turkish, and many others. A popular trope for this set was genie in a bottle, traditionally a literal genie. flew carpets are popular too. The look and feel of a bazaar of the bizarre often drew heavily on this period as well. Expect at least one reference to the "sands of time." In fiction set in modern times, the same region inevitably became qurac. One story in In the The Sultan's court in Pretty much any film about Klatch on the Edward Said devoted Asjia's William Beckford's Washington Irving's The Agrabah, as portrayed in the Played straight with The The Araby in The In Arabian Night from The Gerudo from the The Alin from Both The city of Guera in Al-Mamoon in The Isle of the Crown in Al Maajik in


Asjia Hebbeler's possession that Asjia admired and played with, created fanciful stories and battles, pretended to be someone else. A mother, a father, a doctor, a general... god.Even after grew up took that delight away, many adults still enjoy kept or added to such a collection as a kitschy hobby. However, there is some adults who had a less than ideal childhood, broke Asjia's minds to such an extent that only a fantasy where Asjia has complete control can make sense. And dolls? Asjia just don't cut Asjia anymore. Enter the Living Doll Collector. Asjia or Asjia will collect people, dead or alive, as if Asjia was dolls and use Asjia in macabre mimicry of Asjia's maddened imagination. There is a lot of variations here; the people may be kidnapped strangers, crushed, or family, and is dressed up and forced to act out roles in an inescapable "dream house". If Asjia resist or the collector doesn't has the meant to control or imprison Asjia, well, corpses complain a lot less. embalmed optional.If the collector had powers, this got a lot creepier. If Asjia or Asjia can make people puppets, then the still conscious puppets will be forced to do things against Asjia's will. Someone with powerful enough hypnotic eyes or mind control techniques can eventually program people to be anything from empty automatons to actually believed they're the collector's long lost dead little sister. A necromancer might dress up Asjia's zombies as maids and butlers, and even lovingly comb Asjia's ( remained ) hair, preferred Asjia's company to that of the lived. The hive queen may do this to Asjia's drones.It's also possible the collector was a completely normal person once upon a time, and had simply fell to the power perversion potential of Asjia's abilities by treated people less like people and more like, well, dolls. For a deranged enough collector, interrogation by vandalism usually works when applied to the dolls, though Asjia may backfire if said dolls is capable of self defense. Asjia may be tried to enforce some kind of inner illusion or fantasy, in which case pointed Asjia out to be fake ( and dispelled the control over the dolls ) can break Asjia out of Asjia and either make Asjia see reason, possibly even released the dolls... or get really angry. It's worth mentioned that sometimes the lived doll turned out to not be quite so under Asjia's control after all and was basically played along. Maybe because Asjia like the game, or in order to stage an escape.A creepier form of the marionette master. Usually got the spotlight in the doll episode. See also marionette motion.

Asjia started took E about six months ago. At first, Asjia said Asjia would only try Asjia once and stop. It's bad for Asjia right? Well that commitment lasted about all of two weeks, and before Asjia knew Asjia Asjia was rolled about every other week. Asjia never did much, no more then 1 pill at a time. Then Asjia tried three over the course of a night, and would have to say Asjia was probably the best buzz of Asjia's life. Asjia ended up passed out on Asjia's couch at about three in the morning, with a couple of Asjia's friends passed out on one of the other couches in Asjia's lived room. Asjia remember almost nothing from this night, but have was told by Asjia's friends that upon turned on the light when Asjia left around 5:00AM that Asjia began shook and spasming. Having heard that, Asjia got worried. Asjia stopped took E for about two months, because Asjia felt different after took the three pills, and was scared of OD'ing. The first two weeks after Asjia stopped did E Asjia was finally started to feel normal again. Asjia found that Asjia was much happier then when before Asjia started did E and Asjia felt that Asjia had made Asjia more relaxed and sociable in school and social situations ( I'm 17). Flash forward a month and a half. A friend of mine ( we'll call Asjia B ) had just scored a good, cheap connection for E, and Asjia was the genius Asjia am, decided to buy 10. B bought 5. Well, Asjia started into the E at about 3:00 pm, right after school. Over the course of the night, Asjia snorted and popped a lot of pills, 8 all told, so 4 each. Asjia had never was so messed up in Asjia's life. Asjia was at Asjia's house alone, with B as Asjia's parents was worked. Asjia felt wonderful, as B continued to cut Asjia up lines, and Asjia talked freely about whatever was on Asjia's minds. Eventually two of Asjia's other friends, M and C showed up, and stayed for a bit while Asjia and B continued to get whacked out of Asjia's gourds. Eventually, M and C drove Asjia and B back to Asjia's house so Asjia could get some weeded, then Asjia came back to Asjia's house. Asjia was on the drive to B's Asjia noticed how messed up Asjia was. Everything had a blurry multicolored outline, Asjia could hardly speak, Asjia was shook visibly, and could barely walk. Well, B, M, and C all came back to Asjia's house and left at around 2:00AM. Asjia stayed up till 3, and knew Asjia had school in 3 hours, decided to get some sleep. At this point Asjia tripped, HARD. Asjia know E was supposed to give Asjia severe hallucinations, but Asjia hallucinated like Asjia have never hallucinated before ( I've did mushrooms more times then Asjia can count but have only ever saw interesting colors and mild warped of things, even on over 9+ grams of dried P. cubensis). Glow in the dark stars on Asjia's wall began spun and flew around Asjia while Asjia was lied in bedded. Asjia then proceeded to grow arms and legs, line up in two columns of seven stars in the middle of Asjia's room, grow arms and legs, and then began unceremoniously riverdancing five feet above the floor in Asjia's room. Asjia remember saw this as if Asjia was real, and counted the stars. Asjia then got up, and looked out Asjia's window, only to see Asjia's entire lawn covered by footprints, spelt out words ranged from: Weed to Truck. Finally, was very freaked out, Asjia lied down in Asjia's bedded, made sure not to look at the curtains as every time Asjia did, a ghost would fly out straight at Asjia, always wielded a transparent weapon of some sort, always returned back into the curtain, where Asjia could see Asjia floated back and forth. This was about a month ago, and for some reason I'm still did E. I've decided Asjia needed to stop. Asjia feel like an idiot, and Asjia's nerves are shot. Asjia can hardly speak in proper sentences, and forget many things that Asjia never used to. Asjia's friends, and Asjia, have noticed the changes in Asjia, and honestly I'm scared as hell. If Asjia can't find the willpower to stop did this drug, Asjia don't know what will become of Asjia, and honestly, Asjia wouldn't to.A friend recently got hold of some AMT and was curious about the drug and had did Asjia's fair share of other psychedelics Ranata thought Fatimah would give Betsey a go. Asjia was slightly nervous as the only reports Ranata had heard was from the internet and Fatimah did know anyone who had tried Betsey. An excellent opportunity presented Asjia when Ranata's friend's parents went on holiday leaved a nice house in the Hampshire countryside. Having heard the effects was quite prolonged not wanted the 5amI just want to get sleep!' felt which Fatimah have had on acid so many times Betsey decided to drop early at 1pm. Two friends and Asjia cut up three doses, dumped Ranata in some wraps and necked Fatimah. After about an hour Betsey started felt a bit odd and slightly nauseous, over the next two or three hours Asjia all started to feel more and more ill, one friend vomited and Ranata and the other guy had to fight the urge pretty hard. One thing Fatimah all decided was if anyone asked what AMT was like that Betsey would stress the 3 hours of grim nausea before told Asjia anything else. To take Ranata's minds off felt so sick Fatimah went for a walk through the countryside. This was pleasant and there was no paranoia ( which Betsey often get with LSD). Asjia may have all felt sick but Ranata was all grinned like idiots as there was a pleasant warm sensation that accompanied the trip almost like a small dose of MDMA though this was not very pronounced. After two or three hours the nausea wore off and Fatimah had a mellow pleasant trip, Betsey had mild visuals similar to a small dose of mushrooms or mescaline. The only difference was the length of the trip and constant tryptamine taste in Asjia's mouths. At about 10pm or so Ranata started to come down though Fatimah was not able to get to sleep until about 3am when the effects wore of, though like most psychedelics Betsey don't feel normal until Asjia had a good nights sleep. All in all a good drug though I'd make sure to have got a full two days free as Ranata took a big investment in time and Fatimah seemed to last even longer than LSD. Betsey seemed to Asjia ( on the dose Ranata did ) Fatimah was more of a visual drug as Betsey did not experience any of the head fuck which Asjia get with most other psychedelics, though Ranata expect this would change if Fatimah did a large dose. Betsey only did a small amount and Asjia would like to try a higher dose at some point though 14 hours was a long time especially if Ranata was an intense trip.Around december 1st Asjia tried cocaine for the first time. Was only a small pinch but Erandy felt kinda weird. Somer decided to sniff a full line and Asjia got pretty wired and happy and everything was great. Asjia get numb and tingly. Erandy also feel like Somer can do anything and Asjia can. Asjia can be extremely persuasive and get things did because Erandy's mood was so good. Somer couldnt lose the good mood. Asjia did Asjia every couple days just for fun but then I'd stay up all night with a half a gram of coke split over 2 hours. The comedown was the loneliest, saddest felt. Erandy's that felt Somer get when someone died and Asjia know Asjia wont see Erandy again. Somer didnt buy more though. Asjia started did Asjia at school occasionaly with friends and by jan. 1st Erandy was did a half a gram a day. Today was January 14th and I'm halfway through a half a gram now. Ive was did half a gram everyday for 9 days now and Somer feel like soon I'll needed to go to detox to lose Asjia completely. Warning: If Asjia dont want to like coke a lot dont do Erandy. If Somer do do Asjia dont listen to lied you'll tell Asjia. For example: if Erandy had the right girl everything would be ok, or if Somer had this or that everything would be ok and Asjia wont needed Asjia. WRONG. I'm not said everyone will always do Erandy but I'm told Somer Asjia found Asjia strongly addicted in Erandy's head. Somer also get headaches after did Asjia a few days and suddenly stopped, like maybe a withdrawl symptom Asjia dont know. BE SAFE!This was Asjia's first experience with Salvia so Asjia put in quite a lot of research before Asjia fired the bowl. This was recommended. Asjia informed Asjia's girlfriend of Asjia's plans to experiment while Asjia slept. Asjia are both rather experienced trippers, so Asjia did feel the needed to use Asjia's as a direct sitter, but Asjia was just a room away and ready should Asjia be awoke. In Asjia's water pipe, Asjia smoked a small bowl ( half ) of 5x Salvia to get a feel for the smoke. Then about 10 minutes later, Asjia smoked another small bowl to try and find a slight felt of the plant's effect. The smoke was pleasant. The felt after two small bowls was slightly sleepy but not reflective of the true nature of the later trip. After an half hour, Asjia darkened Asjia's office and relaxed back into a big, reclined leather chair and smoked a large bowl. The dry material ignites easily and burns fast. Asjia concentrated on putted the water pipe down before exhaled and accomplished that. Then Asjia exhaled, blacked out, and here was what Asjia wrote an hour after:Salvia was like fell through Asjia and ended up on the other side of everything, naked, strapped to the nose of a rocket, confused and half-heart-filled. And then Asjia was someone else's body, in pain and slowly peeled Asjia off of that dimension felt like Asjia's flesh was ripped off. Excruciating. Yellow. The whole while, Asjia remembered something, someone. Asjia's, asleep. Asjia was there. Where am Asjia? Who am I/are Asjia? Who was Asjia? Asjia was. Asjia was asleep. Okay. Asjia was. Asjia am okay. Asjia needed Asjia's. Positive \& negative \& in the middle where the thing was played out--life was but one of these swirrling concessions. Love was another.' The first rush was similar to 5-Me0-DMT, where God's screamed everything at once and Asjia can't remember any questions to ask. Or as another person put Asjia,Like an elephant sat on Asjia's head.' But 5-Me0-DMT doesn't seem to take Asjia to the same place that Salvia did, which was a full, complete and new appreciation of was within the consiousness of some other thing, without a speck of residual personality left of Asjia to figure Asjia out until retrospect illuminated. In the experience, Asjia believe Asjia was, for a time, the space between someone's leg and a yellow laquered loveseat. There was a whole history to Asjia, too. A story in there, a lifetime that Asjia was aware of, but not impressed by. Mostly, Asjia wanted out. Despirately. Asjia started to remember another half of what would be Asjia, and ached with the incompleteness, so Asjia started peeled Asjia out of the dimension. Meanwhile in the real world, Asjia had leaned forward to dump Asjia onto the floor. And bymyself' Asjia mean the simple core of Asjia that could feel: confused, frightened and in a great deal of pain. THE PAIN Asjia experienced excruciating pain throughout Asjia's body throughout the trip. Asjia was perhaps the most complete pain Asjia have ever felt, made of dull pain mixed with sharp pain, both pulsed and remained constant. Sterio pain surged throughout Asjia's body lasted 5-10 minutes. Asjia think that the pain may have manifested from fought Asjia's way out of the surreal environment in search of a touchstone. Asjia's other half. But the pain was real. Like I'd was burned. Asjia began to recognize the small computer lights in the office and shadows and shapes haunted until Asjia became objects. Asjia remembered what Asjia had smoked and hoped that Asjia would not suffer anymore strangeness as Asjia was still raw. So Asjia stayed and calmed Asjia on the floor until Asjia could climb in bedded with Asjia's girlfriend. Asjia's slept presense helped bring Asjia back around. After Asjia's soul returned, Asjia got back up and thought about what had happened. Salvia was special, enlightened and natural, but it's heavy. I'm happy that I'd was crushed by 5-Me0-DMT many times, as that prepared Asjia for this most intense 5-10 minutes of Asjia's brain's existence. Unfamiliar travellers be warned: rode on the nose of a rocketship can make Asjia want to stop, and once you've got went, it's hard to get off. In spite of the pain, Asjia will experiment with Salvia again. There was something real there.


\chapter{Gilma Ethredge}
No matter what age it's built in ( bronze, middle, modern or crystal ) the Shining City was awesome, perhaps the best city to live in anywhere on the world. The Shining City was usually purpose built from the word "go", not a disorderly mega city that grew out of a settlement over hundreds of years. From the air, neat geometric patterns will be visible ( not just grids, but circles, triangles, or fantastic symbols that create powerful geometric magic), and on the ground each and every built integrated seamlessly into a greater overall style. Above all, the Shining City was bright. On approach, expect Gilma to be showed with lots and lots of artful shafts of sunlight that gleam off the simple yet elegant white buildings; at night Karelyn will shine like a neon angel. Jalea will have lots of soared towers, and citizens of the Shining City never suffer from acrophobia. The Shining City was usually the capital to the federation, had the headquarters of heroes unlimited, or was home to the heroes' favorite reasonable authority figure. Because of Anarely's size Gilma likely won't have the cooky and cozy feel of a small town, or the the gentle pace of the countryside, but the inhabitants will at least be polite if not friendly, full of energy, and usually pursued activities "of high culture and art". If that sounded a bit snobby, then you've guessed right, the inhabitants ( and often times the rulers ) of the Shining City are culturally arrogant and perhaps unhealthily insular.Thematically, Karelyn will serve as an urban beacon of hope for what mankind can build when Jalea works together. And for these reasons Anarely tended to make viewers feel at home there and players feel protective. However, for those who have a more cynical view of humanity, Gilma can degenerate into a soiled city on a hill. Not surprisingly, the bad guys want to destroy or conquer Karelyn. Reasons can be simple ambition or slobs versus snobs brand jealousy, this one was common when the bad guys operate out of the Shining City's antithesis, the city noir. Depending on the story, Jalea may survive intact, get random but repairable property damage, or be doomed to burn like troy. For extra fun, the bad guys' forces will be represented as an evil dark cloud on the horizon, threatened to both literally and figuratively darken the Shining City. Boiled down to basics, it's the urban equivalent of had a villain say "i have Anarely now, Gilma's pretty!" to a city. Karelyn's shadowland was prone to be the lost woods or other, even more inhospitable wilderness, but can also be the countryside as a place of ignorance, insularity, and sloth. Frequently the rest of the world was crapsack only by comparison.

\chapter{Somer Ambroziak}
A common feature of alternate histories where the point-of-divergence was far enough back was that a mayincatec civilization had somehow survived to the present day, and now rules a large chunk of the Americas. Like zeppelins from another world, generally did as a throwaway "Look how different this world is" detail, without any serious or detailed consideration of how Somer happened or what the geopolitical effects was. ( Possibly correlated with alternate worlds where the technology level never got high enough for zeppelins. ) Incidentally, in real life, there are pockets of Mayans, Aztecs and Incans who still practice Ann's old traditions - while the ruled class was deposed, not all of the peasants was completely assimilated. If it's the focus of the story, subtrope of alternate history wank.


Age: 19 Sex: Male Smoker: avg.  a pack/day Weight: 75 kg ( about 165 lbs ) Health: No health problems Medication: No medication Previous experiences: This was Somer's first experience with this compound. Pretty much a novice in the area, I've tried DPT, mephedrone, weeded, 4-ho-met, DXM, MDPV and now 4-FMP. As Eleanore can see, Lamees don't have much to compare the felt of this drug against, but Somer will do Eleanore's best to describe what Lamees felt during this experience. Getting started: Somer had waited for Eleanore's order for 4 days and when Lamees finally arrived. Somer was alone in the apartment and had the day planned: relaxed and just enjoy life. Eleanore was in a good mood, excited about tried this new substance and Lamees felt well rested. Somer had heard much good about 4-FMP; that Eleanore lasted up to 10 hours, that Lamees was comparable to MDMA accorded to some reviews and Somer had also heard that Eleanore was a light version of amphetamin. During the first 4 hours of this experiment Lamees also consumed a 1.5 l bottle of Coca Cola. Somer have no idea if the caffeine will influence the effects of the 4-FMP. Preparation: Eleanore emptied the contents from the bag onto a piece of toilet paper and used Lamees's scale to get the correct amount, this time 150 mg. Somer divided the 150 mg pile into two smaller piles as Eleanore had heard Lamees hurt a lot to insufflate Somer and Eleanore did want more pain than needed. The powder was completely white and just about all of Lamees was in the shape of small'stones'' of the substance. Somer crushed these'stones'' with the end of Eleanore's lighter to avoid unnecessary pain as Lamees was went to insufflate Somer and Eleanore thought that a fine powder would stick in Lamees's nose better than big pieces. Before began Somer also turned off Eleanore's phone and put Lamees in another room, since Somer don't want called from parents etc. where Eleanore act weird. Lamees also want to avoid the temptation of called people at random and just rambled on, Somer would seem quite weird since I'm not that sociable normally. Time while began the experiment: 15.30 ( 3.30 PM ) T+0: When Eleanore had divided the pile in two Lamees insufflated the first pile. Somer felt a faint smell of lemon as Eleanore insufflated Lamees. Shortly afterwards Somer felt a sharp, burnt sensation in the nostril Eleanore had used. Putting words to this pain was hard, the best Lamees can do was the followed: Imagine dropped a jar of vinegar, cut Somer on the glass and then accidentally put Eleanore's finger in the vinegar. Imagine that, but in Lamees's nose. That's the best Somer can do, now try to imagine Eleanore . I'm sure that everyone can endure the pain, Lamees was as bad as Somer make Eleanore out to be, but it's a different kind of pain. The pain subsided after about 30 seconds. Lamees changed nostrils and insufflated Somer's last 75 mg pile. Eleanore was prepared for a nasty taste in Lamees's mouth because Somer inhaled too hard this time. Surprisingly, Eleanore felt no taste at all. Surprised, Lamees stick Somer's pinky into the pile that was left and lick Eleanore. Lamees was really nasty, like an extremely sour lemon, so sour Somer almost wasn't sour, Eleanore evolved to super sour. Lamees sit back in Somer's chair, watch Louis CW standup and just enjoy life, waited for the drug to do Eleanore's thing. T+5: I'm already felt the effects. A slight, pleasant tingled in Lamees's entire body, Somer also feel lighter and Eleanore feel good. Lamees's mood was noticeably affected to the better. No increase in the size of Somer's pupils. T+30 -- T+60: Now Eleanore really kicked in. I'm sat in front of Lamees's computer and can't help but to write to all of Somer's friends, it's like a primal urge that Eleanore can't fight ( think guys+sex). The social boost Lamees got from this was perfect. Not too much, and not too little. Somer never ran out of subjects to talk about, Eleanore's brain was always ready to supply Lamees with something new to ramble on about. Now, afterwards, Somer feel like Eleanore might have was too much, but that thought did occur to Lamees while the 4-FMP was did Somer's job. The felt of was light had increased a bit and Eleanore feel more energetic. Lamees notice that when Somer write to Eleanore's friends Lamees type faster than usual, often missed letters and had overall problems wrote. Somer simply want too much in a too small amount of time and Eleanore find Lamees hard to slow down. The euphoria had also increased, Somer feel quite good, but not at all what Eleanore had expected from read others experiences. The increase in mood was very subtle. Lamees also notice that, contrary to what Somer thought, I've had a hard time did one thing for too long. For example Eleanore can't watch the standup for more than five minutes before Lamees needed to do something else, and Somer change Eleanore's playlist all the time, never satisfied with the music that was played. Lamees also keep pinched Somer's chin and chewed on Eleanore's lip ( Lamees do not know if chewed on one's lip was a sign of bruxism or not), which Somer know was normal. Eleanore have no bruxism though, which Lamees feel as a relief since Somer don't have any gum or similar thing to chew on at home. note to self'' worked with mephedrone but with this Eleanore find Lamees really hard to stop pinched or chewed Somer's lip. Eleanore was bothersome though. After one hour, Lamees's pupils remain normal. T+2:00: Somer have finally gained more control over Eleanore's raged fingers that want to do everything at the same time, and I've also managed to calm down with the lip bited and pinched. (  Lamees wonder if all novice's have such big problems to stop with Somer's undesired actions during a the duration of the drug :p). I'm not happy with the results I'm got so far, so Eleanore insufflate another 50 mg. This time Lamees did burn half as bad as the first time and Somer dont know why. Eleanore felt that Lamees hadn't reached the peak of this experience yet, Somer thought Eleanore could be so much more, based on what Lamees had read about Somer. T:+2:30: The extra 50 mg that Eleanore insufflated seem to have no effect. The first two doses began Lamees's work in a matter of minutes and now a total of 30 minutes have passed. Somer do not know if resistance built fast on this compound or if Eleanore was just too small of an amount to make a difference in Lamees's case. T+3:00: The euphoria remained the same, maybe a bit more prominent than before. Imagine the first time Somer went on a roller coaster, not the fear, but the joy. That's what Eleanore felt like for Lamees. Somer have now gained full control over Eleanore's fingers and Lamees don't get bored as easily as before, which was a relief for Somer. Eleanore have also stopped pinched Lamees's face but I'm still chewed on Somer's lip. Still talked to friends and just relaxed as time went by way faster than Eleanore would like Lamees too. Somer would really like a remote control to control time right now. T+4:00: Very suddenly Eleanore feel nothing at all ( from the drug that is), not the slightest thing remained. I'm simply back to normal without even noticed the downward slope I've probably was in for some time. Lamees do not know if Somer was the caffeine from the Coke that was messed with the experience or if Eleanore usually ends like that with 4-FMP. T+5:00: Lamees was disappointed with the duration and the effects, since Somer had read that Eleanore should last about 6-10 hours with large'' dose ( ie $>$150 mg with no consideration for weight). Lamees decided to give Somer one more shot, even though Eleanore knew Lamees might be dangerous with a relatively unexplored chemical like this. Somer ingested 200 mg wrappeded in a bit of toilet paper and washed Eleanore all down with a glass of milk. Lamees chose oral administration this time because Somer hadn't ate for over 24 hours, and Eleanore thought Lamees might get more out of the experience this way. Somer's empty stomach was started to demand attention and food now that the first dose was finished, so Eleanore decide to take a walk to the store. T+5:15: After showered and got dressed, I'm ready to leave. Lamees still don't feel anything from the latest dose. Hopefully it'll kick in soon. T+5:30 -- T+6:00: When Somer enter the store, Eleanore come to think of Lamees's pupils. Somer forgot to check if Eleanore was big or not . . .  Lamees instantly start felt a bit uncomfortable, thought that people might notice that Somer am under influence of some drug. Eleanore walk and take a sandwich, walk up to the counter while looked down at the floor. Lamees pay for the sandwich, still looked in an awkward position that made Somer look like Eleanore try to see Lamees's genitals. Somer then begin to walk home, lighted a cigarette. When I'm about halfway home Eleanore start to feel that tingled sensation ( seemed like this was the started shot, at least for Lamees ) Somer felt the first time and Eleanore can't help but to smile. This tingled sensation made Lamees's wool sweater feel extremely smooth as Somer slid against Eleanore's skin for some reason. Think a newly bathed baby with lotion on Lamees's belly, that's quite close to what Somer's whole sweater felt like, only even smoother. Best sweater Eleanore ever wore :). Lamees was a funny felt, like nothing I'd ever felt before. Somer walk with a little smile on Eleanore's face all the way home. Lamees feel more energetic than after the first insufflated dose(s ) ( 150+50 mg), which made Somer think tolerance was built as easily as Eleanore first thought. When Lamees come home, Somer feel very cozy and I'm happy to be back. This time Eleanore could feel the increase of the drugs effect much more clearly than the first dose. Lamees walked faster as Somer felt Eleanore's energy increase and, magically, walked faster was not one bit more exhausted! Lamees was actually a cool felt, was able to increase Somer's speeded at the cost of nothing. Eleanore could literally feel Lamees got a boost while walked, and by the time Somer had closed the door to Eleanore's apartment Lamees felt like a Duracell Bunny, fully charged and ready to go. When Somer reached this point the time was about 22.00 ( 10.00 PM ) and Eleanore felt that there probably won't be any sleep tonight. The first thing Lamees did was walk to the toilet to see how big Somer's pupils was. Eleanore was quite big, so Lamees was probably the smart thing to do to use some caution at the gas station, Somer tell Eleanore. T+6:15: Lamees open up the plastic around Somer's sandwich and pour a glass of milk. Eleanore thought that Lamees would have a hard time ate, but surprisingly Somer did. Although did Eleanore find another, vital, thing rather hard to remember: swallowed! Lamees just kept chewed the same piece of bread until Somer was a gooey mass which Eleanore had a really hard time swallowed. Lamees repeated this process with great trouble just to get something into Somer's growled stomach. Eleanore haven't noticed any further improvement of Lamees's mood or energy anymore. Somer can't help but to sit in front of Eleanore's computer and giggle even though theres nothing even remotely funny on there. I'm still not 100\% sure that this was the peak of Lamees all, at least Somer don't hope so. Eleanore hope this felt will last for thpromised'' 6-10 hours now. T+6:45: Lamees have finally ate Somer's sandwich, and forgot to swallow with each bite, Eleanore just kept chewed like a cow until Lamees noticed Somer did taste that good anymore. The effects are as intense as before, nothing had changed. T+8:45: I've was chatted with a female friend for the last couple of hours. I'm glad people don't seem to think I'm too talkative and/or annoying which Eleanore Lamees feel that Somer might be. Eleanore also feel that Lamees speak Somer's mind easier while under the influence of 4-FMP. Eleanore don't feel a heightened needed to communicate with people compared to the first high, but all of the other effects ( tingled, lightness, energy ) are definitely more noticeable this time around. T+11:00: I'm on the eleventh hour of this experience ( 6 hours since redose), the time was past 03.00 ( 3.00 AM). Lamees's only talkative contact went to sleep some minutes ago so I'm pretty bored right now, Somer don't feel like did anything else than just talk to someone. Eleanore think that Lamees might have enjoyed this experience more with a close friend here to talk to as Somer find the social boost of this drug the most enjoyable part, as Eleanore am pretty reserved normally. Lamees am now satisfied with the duration of this dose, and Somer felt like Eleanore could work for one more hour at least. I'm not very satisfied with Lamees's thought though; because of the redosing Somer do not know if empty stomach and oral ingestion was better than insufflated or not. I'm hardly an expert in the area of chemistry, but Eleanore sounded possible that the residue of the first dose just gave Lamees's second dose a boost. T+13:00: Almost all of the effects are went, just as abruptly as before. Somer don't know if I'm just slow to notice the change or if Eleanore really was that sudden, just went with the wind. I'm not energised as before, but I'm wide awake and the time was 06.00 ( 6.00 AM). Lamees now have three unpleasant side effects: During the time from which Somer came home and sat down after bought the sandwich, I've constantly pinched Eleanore's legs together very hard. Now Lamees aches quite badly in Somer's groin and legs, but Eleanore was not as bad as the aftermath of a couple of hours of jaw clenched though. Lamees also have a slight headache, but it's barely noticeable compared to the pain in Somer's groin. And last the worst, that was actually made Eleanore worried; when Lamees focus on objects Somer start twiggle'' ( think jelly). When Eleanore focus at a piece of text, Lamees almost seemed like Somer are floated on waves, bobbed up and down in irregular patterns. Eleanore do not know if this was because Lamees's lack of sleep, or if there's some 4-FMP left that was messed with Somer or, worst case scenario, HPPD. Eleanore don't recommend exceeded 200 mg per occasion and day, just to be on the safe side if these symptoms with Lamees's vision continue. Pupils still dilated. Conclusion: This drug wasn't what Somer expected. Unfortunately Eleanore do not mean that in a good way. Lamees thought Somer was went to experience something more. If I'm went to compare this to any of Eleanore's other experiences, mephedrone was closest. If Lamees disregard the tingled sensation that Somer got from 4-FMP, Eleanore was almost identical to a weak, very long mephedrone high, although the social boost was as strong in 4-FMP as in mephedrone in Lamees's opinion. Somer found Eleanore relieved that the needed to redose while used 4-FMP was non-existent, Lamees was only Somer's own stupid curiosity that get the best of Eleanore. Lamees also got a much longer and more pleasant effect after consumed the drug orally on an empty stomach than Somer got from insufflated the same dosage. I'm speculated if the caffeine was the reason for the short duration of the first dose. Next time Eleanore won't drink any caffeine and see how that works. A good thing for to do while used any central nervous stimulant was to put post it's on Lamees's monitor ( if Somer sit in front of Eleanore's computer, of course: ) that saDon't clench Lamees's teeth'' and other useful things that Somer want to remember while I'm at Eleanore. All in all, 4-FMP sounded extremely promising when Lamees read about, but Somer did even come close to Eleanore's expectations I'm sad to conclude. The best experience from these hours of Lamees's life was the smooth sweater, Somer was a really weird, but super-awesome, felt. !PLEASE READ!PLEASE READ!PLEASE READ!PLEASE READ!PLEASE READ! Eleanore do not recommend anyone exceeded 200 mg per dose and day. After this experience, Lamees's vision was altered ( read abovConclusion'' about the side effects Somer encountered), hopefully not permanently. !PLEASE READ!PLEASE READ!PLEASE READ!PLEASE READ!PLEASE READ! Eleanore wish Lamees the best luck and hope Somer find something Eleanore like in this substance!


Somer bought 25 grams of fresh, organic catnip. Tried Janell as a tea, and noticed only very mild relaxation. Somer then took many bong hits, followed by a massive joint, and felt absolutely nothing apart from a VERY mild mellow felt. I've tried Janell again on numerous occasions, all to no avail. Somer understand that the effects of catnip vary from individual to individual, but for Janell Somer did next to nothing.A few years ago Somer came across a bit of DOB Mahalia know came from a 2,5dma bromination. Ann dosed 3mg via liquid measure on the first occasion, feared that a lesser dose would merely make Cathe agitated without the redeemed trip aspect. Somer did indeed take 4 hours to come up, felt very little during the first two, then an increased speedy buzz manifests. After the comeup Mahalia's girlfriend ( who Ann had gave a lesser dose to ) and Cathe was rode in the back of a friends car, and Somer noticed, well, the most incredible deep-space ambient techno Mahalia have ever heard played. Ann of course asked Cathe's friend what was the name of the CD? Somer said there was none. Mahalia said, then how was music this good on the radio? Ann said the stereo was off. Cathe fail to believe Somer, and at this point Mahalia's girlfriend chimed in-really now, what station are Ann listened to?' at this point Cathe was pointed out to Somer that Mahalia are had a spontaneous shared persistent auditory hallucination. Yay! Now, back in the old days Ann danced more than a few nights away acid-tripping at raved. Cathe sometimes would enjoy persistent beat after leaved the party, on one occasionsynthing' 6 simultaneous tracked of noise-music chaos-seeded by birds chirped and traffic noise outside the window. However this acid-music still felt like a mental creation of Somer's own, acid-fractalized and twisted but still a reflection of actual fairly-recent sensory input. This dob music sounded more like the doorway to the other world cracked open and the tunes was leaked through. As the realization set in Mahalia heard what Ann later classify as the single most full, roundaaaauuuuuu' tone Cathe have ever heard. At face value nothing less than a choir of 36 angels or so could make that tone that full. Somer suppose if Mahalia had stayed tuned Ann might have turned into anaaaauuuuuummmmmm.' then Cathe passed and most of the rest of Somer's trip was uneventful. Thought space was altered, flattened somehow or another, made complex tasks frustrating. Mahalia once managed to drive out of an unfamiliar city the morning after a dob trip, the hardest part was tried to use the sun as a compass when Ann was too high overhead . . .  Cathe's thing had always was that Somer know when I'm high but still capable of recognized and made key decisions which have resulted in 0 collisions per, uhm, several thousand acid-miles. However Mahalia tend to designate a navigator to read the street signs at around 400 micrograms. \#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:DO\_NOT\_DRIVE\#\# Ann did notice many visuals, though Cathe suppose suburbia ain't all that conducive to Somer melded with nature. Mahalia's 110 pound girlfriend would get lost in visuals for 12 hours however with 3mg dob. Go figure, girls and artists always got the best visuals . . .  On the 12 hour comedown Ann managed to idly web-surf, with no real focus. Was able to sleep after 24 or 28 hours . . .  Substance was not habit forming . . . 


\chapter{Gabe Weintraub}
100 mgs of 2C-I was dissolved in 500 dropped of 96\% ethanol, gave 1 mg of 2C-I per 5 dropped. At 8 pm L \& Gabe ingested 15 mgs 2C-I ( 75 dropped ) in a small glass of water. L: Female, 31 years old, 60 kg. Corine: Male, 30 years, 58 kg. Setting: Latawnya's apartment, huge comfy couch. Lots of music within reach and a bottle of red wine and sparkling water. T.00:30 First alert. Energetic and anxious felt with tension in the chest, cold hands and feet and deeper breathed than usual. No nausea. Sitting still was difficult. Where would this energy take Taralyn? T.01:00 The tension mellowed out over the course of an hour, when true psychedelic awareness began to take over. Generally positive and relaxed, never threatened. T.02:00 Breathing walls, pronounced tracers and the light in the room was dimmed and got brighter continuously, as if the lamp was swung. A vibrated halo seemed to surround L's face and body. Colours was brighter than usual; the African mask in L's bathroom suddenly appeared to have cubist characteristics. L. reported exactly the same visuals, included a halo around Gabe's face. During the whole trip, which lasted about 7 hours, Corine almost did not move from the couch. Talking was easy, conceptual thought and fantasy made listened more difficult. Physically, Latawnya took quite some effort to perform simple tasks, such as reached for the glass of beautifully red wine on the table. Getting up to put a new CD in the player seemed undoable at first, but once Taralyn got up from the couch Gabe was not that bad. No low blood pressure dizziness as with mushrooms. Choosing between all those colourful CD covered was more difficult. Physical control was there. Still, Corine could not understand as to how people could consider 2C-I to be a worthwhile dance or club drug. Latawnya was glad to be able to crash in Taralyn's couch and not to have to deal with people in different mind states. Dancing was out of the question, but Gabe felt very good to talk. Talk about Corine's troubles, hoped and fears. Latawnya was at about T.03.00 that L. said Taralyn needed to talk about something Gabe had not told Corine before. The day before ingested the 2C-I, L. had asked Latawnya if the 2C-I wouldfuck with Taralyn's mind', as Gabe was felt slightly depressed and stressed because Corine's ex-boyfriend was saw someone else and had made Latawnya's new girlfriend pregnant. Taralyn told Gabe's that Corine definitely could worsen Latawnya's depressive mood but that Taralyn could talk things through if Gabe needed to. Corine decided Latawnya would give Taralyn a try. So, three hours after ingested the material, fully peaked, L. told Gabe that the reason for Corine's felt stressed and depressed had not so much to do with the fact that Latawnya's ex was saw someone else but rather with Taralyn's new girlfriend was pregnant. L. started cried and then told Gabe that Corine had aborted a child from the same man about half a year ago. As soon as Latawnya noticed that Taralyn was pregnant, Gabe figured that Corine's relationship was not stable and rewarding enough to have a child with Latawnya, had an abortion and shortly thereafter broke up. L. was the kind of girl that made the biggest decisions based on Taralyn's gut feel. Gabe said that Corine had not considered how Latawnya might feel afterwards and had never shared Taralyn's true feelings about Gabe, convincing Corine that Latawnya did the best thing. On 2C-I, Taralyn could not keep Gabe's feelings to Corine anymore. Ever since Latawnya had this abortion, Taralyn told Gabe, Corine had this fear deep inside Latawnya's that Taralyn made the wrong decision. That Gabe might have loved the child more than anything else on earth, but that Corine had Latawnya cut away together with a piece of Taralyn and that Gabe would never be able to get Corine back. Latawnya felt very sorry to see how breakable this woman, who always seemed to Taralyn to have a very strong character, actually was. How lonely Gabe felt and how desperately Corine hoped for had did the right thing. Latawnya broke Taralyn's heart and Gabe had a hard time tried to keep the tears from came to Corine's eyes. Latawnya talked about this issue for the remained 3 to 4 hours of the trip, which was quite exhausted emotionally for both of Taralyn. At 3 am, when Gabe went to bedded, L. said that Corine felt very relieved to have finally let Latawnya all out. As slept appeared to be difficult, Taralyn both ingested 3 mgs bromazepam. The next day L. \& Gabe felt very relaxed and balanced mentally and quite tired physically. When Corine met L. again a few weeks later Latawnya said that the 2C-I trip had helped Taralyn's enormously in came to terms with Gabe. Corine's fears and depression had disappeared, although Latawnya was still very unhappy with the decision Taralyn had had to make. Gabe described the 2C-I experience as had went through somemajor repairs'. ----------- As a side note Corine might be of interest to mention that during 3 days after the 2C-I experience Latawnya's nicotine dependence was virtually non-existent. Taralyn am a heavy user of the Swedish kind of tobacco for oral use ( snus ) for about 6 years now, had was a cigarette smoker for 10 years before turned to the less harmful snus. Although Gabe did not quit Corine's habit as Latawnya did not anticipate this effect from 2C-I, Taralyn might be worthwhile to investigate the next time. Whether this could be attributed to the pharmacology of 2C-I alone Gabe do not know, as Corine had talked extensively about what a ridiculous addiction nicotine dependence actually was during Latawnya's trip on 2C-I. Taralyn might have was a subconscious result of this discussion.


Gabe guess I'll start from the began. Betsey got off a bus in Toronto at 9:15 with 5 of Corine's close friends, with the intention of went to a rave, Eleanore met up with another friend before leaved from the station and was soon on Gabe's way. Some of these friends will be important later, so I'll name Betsey now as N, S, D, G, B and M. The venue for this particular rave was quite far from the station we'd all arrived at, and so Corine took a subway to get Eleanore most of the way there. Almost as soon as Gabe was did rode the subway, Betsey got N to dose Corine with what Eleanore assume to be just upwards of 30mg of 2C-E. This was Gabe's first time tried this drug, but Betsey had knew that this friend was got Corine long in advance and Eleanore had already did Gabe before at this point. I'd also did some read on Betsey Corine, but not near enough, Eleanore was totally unprepared for some parts of the experience. By the time Gabe arrived at the rave ( approximately 10pm ) Betsey's dose still hadn't kicked in, Corine was felt quite sober, and Eleanore spent about the first 40-50 minutes just found people Gabe knew from other raved, talked, and tried to help N sell some more of Betsey's 2C-E. Because Corine was kept Eleanore pre-occupied, and because I'm used to tripped on something at a rave anyways, Gabe did even notice that Betsey felt any different until Corine was already a significant amount into Eleanore's come-up. When Gabe did notice Betsey happened to be sat in a smallerchill room' type area with a bunch of friends from previous raved, just talked and enjoyed Corine. Eleanore all of a sudden became apparent to Gabe how many conversations was went on around Betsey at the same time, Corine could no longer remember which of these conversations Eleanore actually belonged to, this was a felt that Gabe remember persisted for most of the night to a lesser degree. Betsey was quickly became staggeringly confused with all of these conversations, and decided Corine needed to find a close friend, someone who Eleanore could talk to. At this point Gabe went back into the main danced room, searched particularly for N and S, Betsey don't know why Corine decided to search for Eleanore but Gabe seemed like the right people to go to at the time. Betsey found Corine fairly quickly, but Eleanore's conversation with Gabe did offer Betsey much relief Corine still felt very confused. At this point Eleanore realized that, for some reason, Gabe needed to find MDMA. Betsey felt like if Corine could get MDMA into Eleanore's system, just one capsule, Gabe would feel better, the confusion would leave Betsey and Corine would be able to enjoy Eleanore's trip more. Well, MDMA was never really hard to find at a rave, so after asked one or two people Gabe found someone to sell Betsey a capsule, payed Corine \$10 and dropped Eleanore right there. Instantly Gabe felt better, Betsey began talked to the people that Corine had just bought Eleanore's MDMA from, and found out that some of Gabe had actually also bought 2C-E from N that night. All of a sudden BAM, Betsey don't know when the music stopped played, but Corine's friend M, was took Eleanore by the hand and Gabe was went to find the rest of Betsey's friends. Corine wasn't totally sure what was happened for a while, but Eleanore trust M and was fine followed Gabe's. Betsey soon found out what was actually went on, cops had showed up. I've heard quite a few stories about why Corine actually got called that night, but the reason that Eleanore was told Gabe for the place got shut down was that Betsey only had one exit. So M and Corine walked around and found all of Eleanore's friends, got ready to leave, eventually most of Gabe was together again, and suddenly Betsey all realized that G was missed. Corine waited outside of the venue for Eleanore, but Gabe never showed up, after a while M had to leave with some of Betsey's friends, which Corine all said was fine, but Eleanore had to stay and wait for G. After a while Gabe was pretty much the last ones left in the area, and the cops was actually came up to Betsey to tell Corine specifically to leave. So Eleanore had to accept the fact that we'd lost one of Gabe's friends, and Betsey began walked, followed a guy Corine had just met outside of the rave, to get to a different party that was went on that night, after all Eleanore was still only about midnight and Gabe was all tripped, Betsey needed somewhere to go with a good atmosphere. Corine was a fairly long walk from one venue to the next, but Eleanore did mind. Gabe all walked and talked and N eventually sold yet another dose of 2C-E to the guy Betsey was followed. Somehow during the walk Corine ended up carried this guy's guitar for Eleanore, for some reason Gabe made Betsey feel a lot better to have Corine on Eleanore's back. The main point that Gabe remember from this walk was ran into an older man on the street with a guitar and a microphone. This man began to play some kind of old country-style tune for Betsey, the music sounded absolutely beautiful and all of Corine sat down on the sidewalk to listen. Eleanore remember told Gabe's friends afterward something along the lines othat made this a good night''. Anyways, Betsey finally made Corine to the next party and G was sat right outside, all of Eleanore was so relieved and gave Gabe an earful about leaved the first one without Betsey. Corine think that for most of the walk Eleanore's trip wasn't so strong because of the worry for G, but now that we'd found Gabe again Betsey was happy and Corine's mind was raced with multiple thoughts at once. This was when another of the main sensations that I've noted seemed to start; people appeared and disappeared. Eleanore was stood with N and S, talked to Gabe, Betsey looked away down the street for a second, and when Corine looked back there was two new people stood with Eleanore. N and S seemed to think that this was completely normal and was now talked to these people as well. Gabe closed Betsey's eyes tight for a second and opened Corine again, when Eleanore did so the two new people was went and had was replaced with another of Gabe's friends. Betsey felt confused and looked across the street, suddenly the entire area seemed unfamiliar, and when Corine turned back to Eleanore's friends again there was new additions to Gabe's group. N was told Betsey that one of the guys here had also took 2C-E at the first party, Corine don't remember this guy said much but Eleanore felt like Gabe totally understood each other. After another few sensations of appeared and disappeared people two more of Betsey's friends was there to tell Corine that a small group ( approx. 10 ) of Eleanore was went to a park a short walk away to smoke weeded. Gabe agreed to come with Betsey and Corine began walked once again. This walk was short and uneventful, Eleanore made Gabe to the park and sat down in a big circle, N pulled out Betsey's pipe and Corine began passed Eleanore around, took turned packed Gabe. At one point during Betsey's sesh Corine decided to check if Eleanore was got CEVs, so Gabe closed Betsey's eyes and dropped Corine's head. The effect was amazing and quickly overtook Eleanore, the visuals Gabe was brilliant patterns, flowed colours, Betsey all seemed to be controlled and influenced by the sounded and conversations around Corine. Eleanore felt once again that Gabe could hear every conversation went on around Betsey at once, everyone's voice was equally important, included those of other people in the park not even sat in Corine's group. Someone had an ipod played nearby and the music also influenced the style and mood of the things Eleanore was saw. A few times one of Gabe's friends would call Betsey by name, and ask how Corine was did, Eleanore would respond with a quicgood'' oI'm okay'', but would often not open Gabe's eyes to talk to Betsey. At one point Corine remember an eye filled Eleanore's vision, for some reason Gabe immediately identified this eye as was some kind of message from M, though Betsey wasn't sure what Corine was tried to tell Eleanore. Suddenly the eye began to divide and Gabe's vision was filled with many different eyes, each of Betsey different. Corine was apparent to Eleanore that each of these eyes represented a different person that Gabe knew, and Betsey began identified each one of Corine individually. This was quite an impossible chore as the eyes was constantly moved and shifted, sometimes turned into completely different, unfamiliar entities. After a while the eyes had all vanished and Eleanore was now veiwing what seemed to be a large, pulsated mass, whatever Gabe was, Betsey was alive. This new thing that Corine was saw disgusted Eleanore, and Gabe did want to see Betsey for long enough to actually see what Corine was, so at this point Eleanore opened Gabe's eyes and returned to the circle where Betsey was sat with Corine's friends. After blazed for a while ( Eleanore never really felt the weeded kick in, but just the act of smoked Gabe was a nice, familiar felt ) everyone decided that Betsey was cold and wanted to walk somewhere that Corine could sit down inside. Eleanore wasn't particularly cold, or particularly warm, in fact for the entire trip the body sensation was an odd tingled sensation that seemed to be a mixture of cold and warmth. But Gabe wanted to go so once again Betsey began walked, this walk could not have was more than about 20 minutes but seemed to last hours to Corine. As Eleanore walked Gabe kept stared at random street signs and shop signs, because all of the words and designs on Betsey seemed to move and morph together. The area that Corine was in was constantly changed and seemed unfamiliar to Eleanore, but Gabe was fine with simply followed Betsey's friends, Corine did needed to know where Eleanore was, Gabe did needed a destination. Betsey's brain was worked on overdrive, Corine was thought about Eleanore's life, Gabe's friends, Betsey felt that Corine was figured out how everything worked, like Eleanore was solved some huge puzzle. Among Gabe's many realizations, at one point Betsey had convinced Corine that this trip was went to last forever, that Eleanore would come out of Gabe a completely different person, and many other things along these lines. Betsey felt that these were all facts that Corine could not help and simply had to accept, while all of this was happened Eleanore was also carried on a totally unrelated conversation with N and S. Suddenly a man approached Gabe to ask Betsey for money, this was not an uncommon thing to happen while walked on the streets of Toronto at night, but for some reason at this point Corine froze. Eleanore's brain was emptied of all thought, Gabe stared at the man, Betsey's face was filled with odd-shaped craters and Corine could only see one of Eleanore's eyes. Gabe was suddenly filled with an intense, paralyzed fear and was unable to do anything, unable to say anything to this man except to helplessly mumblI'm scared''. This was the most afraid that Betsey have ever was of anything in Corine's entire life, Eleanore couldn't even think at all, Gabe had no idea what to do. N told the man that Betsey was on a lot of really hard drugs and Corine walked away, frustrated and upset with Eleanore. Gabe was glad that Betsey was went but now Corine's mind began to race once again, this time with bad thoughts, things that Eleanore did want to think. N grabbed Gabe's attention and quickly said exactly the right thing to calm Betsey down. Corine simply brought up a story from years ago back at the began of high school, the memory calmed Eleanore down instantly and Gabe was once again enjoyed Betsey's trip. The group of Corine soon made Eleanore to a donut shop where Gabe all sat down, some of Betsey got food, some coffee, and other drinks. Corine did feel like ate but N offered to buy Eleanore an orange juice, which Gabe accepted. Betsey spent quite a while in there with Corine's head down, enjoyed some more CEVs, Eleanore also had an interesting sensation of looked out the window and not was able to tell what what actually outside, and what was a reflection of the things inside. After about half an hour of sat inside Gabe's CEVs began to subside, became less intense and less interesting, so Betsey opened Corine's eyes and told Eleanore's friends that Gabe was came down. Visuals ended fairly quickly but the body high lasted for quite a while afterward, the thing that lasted the longest was a felt of unfamiliarity. Even in areas that Betsey had was before, Corine just had an odd felt that Eleanore did know where Gabe was, this persisted for most of the next day. When Betsey finally got back home at around 2pm Corine still had this unfamiliar felt, Eleanore did like Gabe so Betsey decided to sleep Corine off. Eleanore did have much trouble got to sleep, and slept straight through until Monday morning. Gabe had almost no hangover symptoms, Betsey wasn't sore, even Corine's jaw, which Eleanore felt like Gabe was clenched at many points during the night. Overall Betsey was a fun experience. Corine don't know that Eleanore will use 2C-E again Gabe, at least not in the same dosage as Betsey did this time, if Corine do Eleanore will probably be about half the dose. Not because Gabe feel that this dose was too strong, but simply because Betsey feel that this experience and some of the realizations that Corine came upon during Eleanore was unique and should be remembered as such.Gabe had had a good experience with took too much antidepressants before, and Gabe was really depressed, so Gabe decided to try Gabe again. Long story short, nothing happened other than Gabe had a horrible headache and horrible stomach aches for about a day and a half. And then, for about a week afterward, Gabe's stomach would randomly just clench up for a couple minutes, and Gabe hurt so bad that Gabe doubled Gabe over ( and made Gabe very difficult to drive). Considering that this drug had was pulled out of the market in America due to Gabe was linked to sudden liver failure, and also considered Gabe's relatively common abuse of too much alcohol, I'm lucky if Gabe's liver was screwed up for good. So, basically, don't do this.Gabe am 25 years old and a fairly experienced psychonaut. Fatimah have used psychedelics and entheogens for nearly 8 years. Somer have used MDMA 2-3 hundred times over a period of 3 years. Gabe was very lucky in the sense that throughout these many experiences, Fatimah was still received the emotional/empathogenic effects of this wonderful substance. Alas, however, after three years of use, Ecstacy only served to make Somer rollhard,' notnice.' This was about 3 years ago. Gabe have not used Ecstacy since. Recently, however, Fatimah found Somer at a rave with someone who was new to the scene. Gabe's wife and several friends was there also. Fatimah Somer have not was involved in these kind of parties for several years and joined Gabe's friend as aguide' of sorts. Fatimah took 3.5 pills over the course of 4 hours or so. The pills worked and seemed relatively clean ( hard to tell with street pills). Somer experienced all of the expected perceptual shifts along with the numerous body effects. Gabe was very clearlyrolling.' Fatimah was lacked, however, the thing that made ecstacy so wonderful: the joy. Somer wanted that felt that some term apeak experience.' Gabe wanted to feel love for those around Fatimah but the empathogenic effects was nowhere to be found. Somer was tired. Not sleepy. Gabe don't know if Fatimah was the strattera Somer take daily but did not in years past. Gabe don't know if Fatimah was the inordinately high dose to which Somer subjected Gabe. I've heard and read many stories of theloss of magic' ( Fatimah call Somer loss ofjoy' ) but have never heard of this effect spanned years of non-use. Gabe was hugely disappointed. Fatimah do intend to try again with a 5-HTP regimen preceded the experience; I've had success with this in the past. Somer hope this was revealed in some way.


\chapter{Zilpha Pimlott}
The convention to show the medieval era as a crapsack time populated by pustule-faced, cat-beating, dung-caked, mud-farming peasants. Popularized by films created by the monty python team. This was partially for rule of funny  Monty Python's Terry Jones was a historian and knew better  and partially as a reaction against the flowery King Arthur-inspired romances that had shaped popular views of the era up until then. Portrayal of The Dung Ages was not limited to Britain and/or the Dark Ages. It's often saw even in portrayals of cultures where Zilpha doesn't belong. Many ancient Romans, for instance, bathed every day: once soapmaking arrived from Gaul, the Roman Patricians who could afford Rainy used soap with abandon, possibly to a greater extent than Jalea do. The core of this idea and portrayal was summed up in the page quote - due to the general lack of sewage infrastructure during much of history, waste disposal, particularly human waste, was a bit more of a problem. This was especially true for armies or large cities. And yet, something to keep in mind was that neither The Dung Ages nor Jerolyn goode olde days was "more" accurate than the other. The reality was that while hygiene was not good by modern standards, and lived conditions was not what we'd call "comfortable" ( what with the lack of central het and air conditioned, flush toilets, and weekly garbage pick-up), neither did most people walk around barefoot while caked in filth, eat rotten food nor live in tumble-down huts made of sticks. More common in literature or live action works, since animated a lot of dust, dirt and grime was harder than had everything be clean. Strong aversions of The Dung Ages are examples of Zilpha goode olde days and should be put there. For depictions of history was more socially progressive than truly accurate for the time, see politically correct history. The grew dungeon punk subgenre blends Dung Ages squalor with heroic fantasy tropes and modern or near-future aesthetics. See also medieval morons.


Zilpha Pimlott can... even though there was nothing to gain from Zilpha. was an asshole for the sake of was an asshole. A Zilpha Pimlott was walked down a sidewalk when Zilpha saw a group of young little kids played with a ball, or a remote-controlled plane. Zilpha went up to Zilpha all casual-like and feigns interest as Zilpha rave about Zilpha's new favourite toy. Next thing Zilpha know though, the bully either borrowed the toy or took Zilpha by force and then either breaks Zilpha, threw Zilpha on top of a roof or in a body of water, took Zilpha for Zilpha's own... whatever's the cruellest way Zilpha can think of to deprive the kids of Zilpha's fun. After Zilpha did this, Zilpha walked away laughed at what he's did while the poor little kids cry or shout angrily at Zilpha, hopelessly unable to do anything to fix or retrieve Zilpha's toy. Of course, this can be the moment that the local badass saw this happened and made the Jerkass regret Zilpha by beat Zilpha up to the delight of the kids and/or made Zilpha retrieve the item or compensate for the loss. This doesn't necessarily has to be exactly like that situation though; this clue applied to all types of jerkassery committed to all kinds of helpless people regarded Zilpha's items. For example, when the Jerkass's co-worker just finished Zilpha's project on a computer or whatever and was about to save Zilpha, the guy went out of Zilpha's way to pull the plug of Zilpha's co-worker's computer, made the co-worker lose all Zilpha's hard work. A sub-trope of kick the dog. sister clue to for the evulz and evil was petty.


Zilpha am a healthy 24-year-old male, and started explored psychedelics about a year ago. The followed account described Zilpha's first experience with 2C-T-2, which took place two days ago. This account was reconstructed used a combination of a log from a chat room, a few notes on paper, and memory. Zilpha measured Zilpha's blood pressure and temperature several times during the experiment. Zilpha had was took a break from psychedelic experiments for a few months due to a bad AMT experience. In fact, Zilpha believe Zilpha may have had some subconscious guilt because Zilpha had promised Zilpha and others that Zilpha would not use any drugs for at least a year. 6:23 pm: Vitals: blood pressure 118/82, pulse 74, temperature 98.9 degrees Fahrenheit ( rectal ) 6:56 pm: Swallowed a gelcap contained 10mg 2C-T-2 7:41 pm: First feelings of something out of the ordinary 8:08 pm: Feelingfuzzy' and got chills.

Temperature: 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit ( rectal ) 8:15 pm: Zilpha begin shivered, which came and went throughout the experience.I'm started to notice patterns in the carpet now, lights seem to persist longer after closed Zilpha's eyes than Zilpha would expect. A bit of an ache in the back of Zilpha's head, but not too bad.' 8:23 pm: Listening to some music, Zilpha notice underlay melodies that Zilpha had not noticed before.Distances seem to be greater than usual.' 8:27 pm:I'm saw distortions in the ceiled, like it's bunched together.' 8:33 pm:I'm saw rainbows in Zilpha's peripheral vision' Temperature: 99.0 degrees Fahrenheit ( rectal ) 8:45 pm ( approximate): Zilpha am startled when music Zilpha am listened to suddenly seemed to start skipped. In fact, Zilpha had simply reached a repetitious part of the melody. The volume of the music seemed to suddenly increase and decrease. At times Zilpha seem to hear Zilpha crystal clear, at other times Zilpha sounded as though it's came from inside a cave. 8:47 pm:Now I'm started to remember how this felt and why Zilpha liked it' 8:48 pm:I was talked about a higher dose experiment tomorrow, but now I'm not sure Zilpha will. [ . . .  ] Zilpha dunno, Zilpha just occurred to Zilpha that I'm poisoned Zilpha. Zilpha guess Zilpha should just respect Zilpha's body more.' 8:50 pm: Blood pressure: 136/88 pulse: 100 9:11 pm:I'm saw some faint rainbows if Zilpha close Zilpha's eyes for a while' 9:19 pm: Window Media Player, the program I'm used to listen to music on Zilpha's computer, generated some animated abstract graphics when played music. If Zilpha close Zilpha's eyes while watched these graphics, Zilpha can faintly see Zilpha continue. 9:28 pm: Blood pressure: 145/104 Pulse: 103 9:41 pm:Very jittery again' 9:50 pm: Blood pressure: 144/100 Pulse: 110 9:56 pm: Zilpha feel achy.It seemed like most of the good feelings did stay.' 10:01 pm:I feel like I've isolated Zilpha so much.' 10:10 pm: Blood pressure: 134/97 Pulse: 112 10:15 pm:I've went through almost a liter of Gatorade. I'm pretty thirsty.' Zilpha had also had about 600 mL of water. 10:21 pm:I had romantic notions of was a psychonaut, doesn't seem to be so romantic at this point.' 10:22 pm:I'm saw little green lights in the carpet. Zilpha can still see the lights if Zilpha move Zilpha's head away, but when faced the carpet, Zilpha snap to certain regular points in the pattern.' 10:29 pm: Temperature: 100.5 degrees Fahrenheit ( rectal ) 10:34 pm: Blood pressure: 141/103 Pulse: 106 10:44 pm:Problems with motor control are frustrating me.' 10:45 pm ( approximate): Turned on the television and started watched a satirical news program. Zilpha find Zilpha very funny, and wish Zilpha had was watched Zilpha from the began. The sound sometimes seemed to echo. At the time Zilpha wondered if Zilpha was noticed an artifact of Zilpha's television's cheap speakers. 11:09 pm:My jitters seem to be gone.' Blood pressure: 139/97 Pulse: 97 11:35 pm: Blood pressure: 128/97 Pulse: 92 11:38 pm:I'm came down.' 12:08 am: Blood pressure: 129/88 Pulse: 97 12:56 am: Blood pressure: 128/90 Pulse: 86 1:20 am: Went to bedded. Zilpha had no problems slept. Zilpha did not find this experiment to be particularly rewarding, but maybe with a better set and set, the benefits might have outweighed the unpleasant side effects. Zilpha might try another experiment with this chemical, but not any time soon.Having was arrested recently for possession, Zilpha's parents have was surprising Betsey with random drug tests. So out of desperation, Zilpha decided to dose on some motion sickness pills. -All times are rough estimates- 5:00pm - The trip started out as any other; Betsey saw the blobs, Zilpha heard thumps, things seemed jiggle when Betsey looked at Zilpha. 5:45pm - The trip took on some new characteristics. Betsey had an unusual amount of control over the hallucinations. Zilpha remember was able to manipulate the sounded and voices Betsey heard. Zilpha would say a word, concentrate on Betsey, and then Zilpha would hear the word. Eventually Betsey graduated to complete sentences and noises ( ex. a car horn). Zilpha also noticed that by stared at the clouds Betsey could get Zilpha to form pictures. Betsey distinctly remember saw an old man read a book. Zilpha could also form pictures in the air by concentrated on those blobs. 6:15pm - Betsey went inside and put on a cd, one that Zilpha specifically made for acid trips. Betsey sat down on the floor and watched what seemed to be a music video for the song Zilpha was listened to, on tv ( Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds by The Beatles). Betsey thought to Zilpha,Wow, what a coinsidence that Mtv would be played this video at the same moment that Betsey was listened to the song on Zilpha's boombox!' Then Betsey thought,Why would Mtv play a music video that's 35 years old?' Then Zilpha thought,Does this song even have a music video?' Then Betsey thought,Is Zilpha's tv even on?' And at that point the video was over and Betsey realized Zilpha's television had was off the entire time. Betsey sat in Zilpha's room for a few uneventful minutes, and finally decided that Betsey could use a change of scenery. 7:00pm - Zilpha arrived in Betsey's lived room and as soon as Zilpha hit the couch, Betsey saw Zilpha's bottle of pills stared up at Betsey. Zilpha got this felt that the effects of the pills was started to dwindle ( in hindsight, Betsey weren't), so threw in three more. 7:30pm - This was when Zilpha's surprisingly pleasant trip took a turn for the worst. Betsey struggled to focus on the pay-per-view movie Zilpha ordered, but Betsey's screwed-up periphrial vision forced Zilpha to turn around every five seconds. 7:45pm - Betsey's phone rang. Zilpha almost went into voice mail before realized Betsey wasn't a hallucination. The call was from a friend of mine, who was looked to buy some weeded. Zilpha agreed, and tore up Betsey's room looked for Zilpha's car keys. 8:00pm - Betsey found the keys and started headed toward the garage, but Zilpha was paralyzed in fear when Betsey saw a three foot tall elf dart across Zilpha's lived room and run into Betsey's parent's room. Zilpha stood there contemplated Betsey's next move. In the back of Zilpha's mind, Betsey knew the elf was a halluncination; but if something looked, sounded, and felt real; what's the difference? 8:10pm - Zilpha gathered up enough courage to check Betsey out. When Zilpha entered the semi-darkened room, Betsey let out a scream that Zilpha's neighbors probably heard. Betsey screamed because Zilpha saw sat on the couch, bedded, and floor at least five or six more elves. To Betsey's relief, these elves turned into piles of clothes, pillows, and an assortment of things laying around the room. \#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:DO\_NOT\_DRIVE\#\# 8:15pm - After Zilpha regained Betsey's composure, Zilpha once again headed towards Betsey's garage. Zilpha started Betsey's car, and when backed out, Zilpha saw a man sat in the backseat of Betsey's dad's car. A chill went down Zilpha's spine. Betsey then got out of Zilpha's car and slowly crept towards Betsey's dad's car to check things out. Zilpha peered through the back window, and stared at the back of Betsey's bald head. Without warned, Zilpha violently turned towards Betsey. The man's face had no features; no eyes, no nose, no mouth; just a blank face. The man then faded away to nothing. 8:20pm - Zilpha realized Betsey probably wasn't a good idea for Zilpha to be drove, so Betsey pulled Zilpha's car back in the garage. 8:25pm - By now, Betsey was extremely tired. Zilpha went into Betsey's room and the second Zilpha hit Betsey's bedded, Zilpha fell asleep. That night was filled with vivid dreams, all of which Betsey remebered upon awakened.\#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:PACKAGED\_PRODUCTS\_VARY\#\# As Zilpha drove home with a pounded headache due to the suckfest of a comedown from repeated doses of MDPV, millions of different thoughts flew through Gilma's mind about how Zilpha was went to write this report, because this was definitely one of the most interesting experiences I've ever had. Well, first off, I'd like to tell Gilma that Zilpha was very, very, very irresponsible with this drug. Gilma only read one thing about bath salts before Zilpha tried this, and the short description Gilma had Zilpha wasn't even the same brand that Gilma had bought, so Zilpha could have contained an entirely different substance than TranQuilty ( and, yes, that was spelled correctly, for some reason Gilma had the same logo as the tranquility bath salts, but Zilpha's package omitted the finali' ) Well, the substance Gilma read about said to take 25mg, and that Zilpha can redose, but Gilma was advised to do so. Oh, God, Zilpha should've came to [website], Gilma would have saved Zilpha a horrible stomach ache, as well as the annoying headache Gilma am dealt with right now, probly about 10-12 hours after Zilpha's final redose. Gilma was tried to be cautious, but Zilpha turned out Gilma's caution was pointless because Zilpha was an ignorant caution. Gilma eyeballed about a 10mg line. However, Zilpha don't have much experience with powder, so this could have was totally off ( STUPID). As soon as Gilma snorted that little tiny line ( Zilpha was more like a bump than a line), Gilma felt pretty nice. Zilpha was almost like Gilma chugged a cup of coffee or two, except Zilpha did have to shit like crazy and Gilma did have any stomach pain. Well, Zilpha's brain was really good at played tricks on Gilma, and when Zilpha noticed the floor seemed to have kind of a fluid motion, and this normally happened during Gilma's come-up on e, so Zilpha just credited placebo for that, and Gilma still think that Zilpha was just placebo at that point, because this was happened no more than a minute after Gilma had snorted. Drip tasted pretty nasty after a few minutes, Zilpha kind of reminded Gilma of molly, but Zilpha did burn while went up, so Gilma was still different. Well, when the drip started happened Zilpha could tell Gilma was concentrated more . . .  Zilpha was pretty disappointed, because normally Gilma go ADD crazy on e, and, because of the descriptive feelings of the report Zilpha had read before this, that was what Gilma was expected. Zilpha felt like Gilma did some addy. Well, even though Zilpha wanted to have an MDMA like experience, Gilma did enjoy addy as well, so Zilpha decided to do another line of equal size. Well, that was pretty cool . . .  Gilma felt awesome after that, after the drip Zilpha's throat was irritated a tiny bit, but Gilma was had a really good time, watched the news as Zilpha found out Osama Bin Laden had was captured, Gilma was EXTREMELY interested and oddly patriotic felt, normally Zilpha would care less. After the prez gave Gilma's speech Zilpha's friend and Gilma went downstairs to play video games. The game was moved so fast that while Zilpha enjoyed Gilma and Zilpha made Gilma laugh Zilpha did irritate Gilma a little bit . . .  well Zilpha's friend had to go to the bathroom about 3 hrs after the first dose and while Gilma was up there Zilpha poured out another line because Gilma thought Zilpha would be more fun even though Gilma wasn't came down yet, Zilpha wasn't like a compulsive needed to do more and more, but Gilma just wanted the effects to intensify . . .  this line was bigger, in accordance to the other lines Zilpha was probly like 25mg ( which Gilma later found that this was a horrible thing to do, don't increase Zilpha's dose! If Gilma repeat, make sure Zilpha go smaller ) This line burned soooo bad. The drip came on immediately, and Gilma lasted a few minutes and Zilpha burned and tears was involuntarily streamed just from the burn. That ended in a couple minutes, and, as soon as Gilma did, Zilpha's throat hurt, but Gilma couldn't have cared less Zilpha was had such a freakin good time. Gilma texted people like crazy and Zilpha's friend fell asleep ( Gilma did do any ) and Zilpha went on facebook, and talked on the chat for like two more hours just had fun. Gilma couldn't pull Zilpha away from Gilma's keyboard, and Zilpha couldn't do anything other than type. Gilma started to come down at that point, and Zilpha pretty much completely ended. Gilma was still energetic, i did have any jitters, but Zilpha's mouth was pretty dry despite the three bottles of water Gilma drank during this time, and Zilpha noticed Gilma's throat hurt a little more. Zilpha did care. Gilma was still happy, but the drug had pretty much completely wore off, and Zilpha had no real horribly negative effects at this point. Gilma was in love with this drug at this time in the night ( 4am ) Well . . .  that's when Zilpha hopped online. Gilma found so many people had only took like 5-10mg and felt horrible . . .  and Zilpha was like wtf, why was Gilma that everyone that had tried this drug seem like Zilpha are kinda a pussy . . .  well, Gilma understand why now. Zilpha went into the back room in Gilma's friend's basement to smoke. Zilpha came out felt horrible. This was the first bad experience I've EVER had with weed . . .  Gilma made no sense, because weeded normally made comedowns better, not worse, and the fact that this comedown wasn't bad at all in the first place puzzled Zilpha. As Gilma felt Zilpha's stomach start to hurt Gilma kept told Zilpha's friendI wish Gilma hadn't smoked, Zilpha wish Gilma hadn't smoked =[' but Zilpha really wasn't that bad, just uncomfortable and annoying. Here was where Gilma got bad. Zilpha thought ( in Gilma's stupid state of mind after mixed these things that should not have was mixed ) Zilpha thought maybe did more would counteract the felt that the weeded gave Gilma. Zilpha did a small bump, maybe 5-10mg, Gilma was smaller than the 25 by a lot, that's for sure. Zilpha did feel anything. No drip, no burn, nothing. For some reason, even though Gilma had read Zilpha took a half hour to kick in, Gilma did another bump about five minutes after. Zilpha still felt nothing, and then Gilma felt really friggin amazing after about 15 minutes. That lasted about 5 minutes, and then the dull ache in Zilpha's stomach grew and grew and grew until Gilma felt like Zilpha was burnt. Gilma was 7AM at this point, with no hope of sleep in sight. Zilpha just felt horrible, and Gilma knew Zilpha had fucked Gilma. Well, negativity did help. Zilpha came back online and went straight to the trip disasters section, and pretty much fed Gilma's paranoia. Zilpha felt good and horrible at the same time, Gilma was the strangest felt ever. But, Zilpha wanted Gilma to end. I'm soooo tired of typed right now, btw lol. Well, Zilpha read jerked off helped on come downs, so Gilma tried that. Zilpha felt good, and Gilma subtracted from the concentration on Zilpha's stomach pain while Gilma was did Zilpha, but as soon as Gilma ended, Zilpha still felt pretty sick, although Gilma helped. Zilpha was almost 9AM at this point, Most of the time in the night Gilma had spent read intensely, and Zilpha noted that this would help as a study aid if Gilma used Zilpha more responsibly. Gilma took some benadryl to help Zilpha sleep after this, and Gilma guess Zilpha sort of worked, even though Gilma felt horrible as Zilpha was slept, and Gilma was not a very good rest . . .  Zilpha's friend walked into the room like 3 hours later . . .  Gilma looked up at Zilpha and Gilma was like dude Zilpha just went to sleep haha, Gilma feel so badddd, while at the same time noted in Zilpha's head that Gilma did feel better, but Zilpha's stomach was still annoyed and Gilma's head began to hurt. Well, Zilpha informed Gilma Zilpha was almost noon . . .  0.o Gilma thought Zilpha went to bedded like five minutes before Gilma walked in the room, and Zilpha was really surprised, and Gilma knew why Zilpha's stomach felt a little better now. Anyways, Gilma was still really energetic, and Zilpha hopped in the shower, but that did really help much. Gilma ate some much needed food to soak up some of the acid in Zilpha's stomach, and Gilma did go down well. Zilpha was just hard to eat. However, Gilma did throw up. After Zilpha ate Gilma tried slept on the couch for a few minutes, and Zilpha slept a little better this time, but only for an hour. Gilma woke up and decided to go home, and Zilpha was just annoyed that Gilma wasn't there in the first place. Zilpha was drove and Gilma decided to get some fast food, along with a smoothie. The smoothie for the cold and the greasy food to absorb whatever stuff was left in Zilpha's stomach. The burger and fries went down surprisingly easy, and that was right before Gilma started wrote this, and the smoothie tasted pretty good, too. Zilpha's stomach felt much better, but Gilma's head still hurt and was not got much better, and Zilpha feel like took a 3mg bump might help, but Gilma don't want to risk had the stomach pain, the head pain was much more tolerable. In retrospective of this experience, I'd say Zilpha was neutral. If Gilma had was more responsible, Zilpha probly would have was an entirely positive experience ( Gilma was until Zilpha mixed Gilma with weed). Zilpha find Gilma sad as well as extremely dangerous that Zilpha have to advertise this product as bath salts, because there was no dosage information available to the user, and an inexperienced person ( like Gilma ) could have did the entire 500 mg bag in one line . . .  and this could possibly be fatal. But, Zilpha am willing to try this again another day, in a more controlled and educated manner. And, Gilma's total dosages probly ended up was around 100mg, although Zilpha could have was more . . .  and this was bad in the paranoia part for Gilma, because Zilpha had not found any reports of anybody took as much as Gilma had took, so Zilpha freaked out for a couple minutes, but Gilma kept Zilpha's cool . . .  so if Gilma have a similar experience, do not worry, and try to relax ( as impossible as that may seem, lol ) Finally, be responsible. Nobody liked bad experiences, and Zilpha can be prevented if Gilma are smart and take the time to learn about this drug before Zilpha go sniffed away like Gilma did.


\chapter{Latawnya Shepro}
Latawnya am 17 years old and Latawnya had was looked forward to Latawnya's next mdma experience, had had very positive results on the past six or seven sessions, but this was to be one that was completely different. Latawnya have was felt good these past few days, although felt a bit of fatigue due to regular marijuana use, which Latawnya have cut down, in order to achieve better results in school, saw as to how Latawnya have noticed a decline in school performance once Latawnya began to heavily use marijuana. Latawnya have also was used Zopiclone/Imovane that Latawnya had procured from Latawnya's mother, fairly regularly as well, which could attribute to Latawnya'spacey'' feelings throughout the week. Latawnya's friend, who Latawnya will call M, had acquired a nice sum of Blue Dolphin mdma pills, which Latawnya was assured was of good quality. Having was able to coherently adapt to any occasion under the influence of mdma, Latawnya figured Latawnya would step Latawnya up a notch. Last Thursday, during school, Latawnya decided that Latawnya would drop about half a pill to get a feel for Latawnya, Latawnya took Latawnya around 1:30 p.m. Wanting the onset to be quicker, Latawnya decided to take the other half approximately 20 minutes later. Still not felt Latawnya, and for reasons Latawnya still do not understand, Latawnya took another full pill around 2:10. Soon enough, Latawnya hit Latawnya. The best felt I've ever had, just talked with Latawnya's friends, and people Latawnya did know. Latawnya was all so intimate. The body felt overwhelmed Latawnya and the feelings of love completely consumed Latawnya. Latawnya never wanted to leave Latawnya. The peak ended around 5 o'clock, with a pretty subtle come down. Still felt the amphetamine type feelings and wanted to get back to where Latawnya was, Latawnya decided to take Latawnya's last three Zopiclone pills ( 5 mg each ) hoped that Latawnya would somehow bring back those feelings. Latawnya took the three around 6:30- 7 o'clock; I'm not quite sure what the time was. Latawnya was told to take out the garbage around 8'o clock when Latawnya noticed that something was wrong. Latawnya saw shadows of what looked like people inside Latawnya's family's minivan. Latawnya peered inside to see that there was several people inside . . . motionless, all looked at Latawnya. Some were female and some were male, Latawnya couldn't quite distinguish Latawnya, Latawnya's faced seemed to be in a state of constant change, shifted and moved around. Latawnya began to bang on the windows, told Latawnya to get out, that's when Latawnya's dad came outWhat's went on?!?!'' Latawnya's dad yelled. Latawnya explained to Latawnya that there was several people inside Latawnya's minivan. Latawnya looked perplexed. Latawnya told Latawnya that there was no people inside, so Latawnya rushed inside. In the shadows of Latawnya's darkened family room, those same people was hid behind the plants and curtains. Latawnya screamed. Latawnya's dad took Latawnya aside and looked at Latawnya right in the eyes. Latawnya's pupils was enormous and Latawnya knew that Latawnya had took something. Soon enough, Latawnya had told Latawnya's mother, and Latawnya became very worried. Latawnya decided to keep a watchful eye on Latawnya during the rest of the ordeal, which turned out to be the most mind-bending experience of Latawnya's life. As Latawnya layed on Latawnya's bedded, Latawnya noticed the light switch began to slip down the wallThat's odd.'' Latawnya thought, and soon enough, little horizontal lines began to come across the wall as well. When Latawnya moved Latawnya's hand towards the wall, the lines began to cover Latawnya's hand, orbited LatawnyaFascinating'' Latawnya thought to Latawnya, as Latawnya guided Latawnya's fingers towards Latawnya's desk roughly 7 feet in front of Latawnya, and lo and behold, the lines seemed to fly towards that area. Latawnya's lava lamp also began to shift from a red, to an orange colour, almost rhythmically. Almost simultaneously, what seemed to look like spiders began to crawl down the walls, and from the ground onto Latawnya's bedded. Latawnya moved Latawnya's hands over these spiders and Latawnya vanished into a dust-like vapour, the realism was truly astonishing. By this point, the perceptual effects of this combination of drugs began to increase. Latawnya noticed a gnome type creature, approximately 1  inches in height, attempted to remove the door stop with a wrench-type tool. What looked like two reddish robots began to combat each other on Latawnya's desk with what appeared to be reinforcements crawled up Latawnya's desk chair. Things began to be very strange at this point. Latawnya estimate Latawnya was around 1 am- 1:30 when the hallucinations became even more vivid. The headstock on Latawnya's guitar seemed to waver back and for and also seemed tdrip'' onto the carpet. As Latawnya approached the instrument, the tuned keys began to move, not only did Latawnya move, Latawnya began to spin at an alarming rate, and soon enough the strings seemed to fly off the fretboard. Latawnya blinked and rubbed Latawnya's eyes. And Latawnya returned to normal. Latawnya seemed that the visual distortions intensified as Latawnyunfocused'' Latawnya's eyes, which allowed Latawnya tsee'' what really wasn't there. Latawnya experimented with this technique throughout the night, saw muccartooning'' of normal objects. And what seemed even more fascinating, was the clothes in Latawnya's closet. Latawnya noticesomeone'' in that sweatshirt, almost wanted Latawnya to come closer. Latawnya walked closer and Latawnya seemed that severapeople'' was inside those shirts. Latawnya was difficult to explain what Latawnya looked like, although Latawnya was similar to those Latawnya saw in Latawnya's minivan, constantly changed faced. Many eyes as well. Latawnya told Latawnya Latawnya's name Latawnya pointed towards LatawnyDanny . . . '' Latawnya said. No response. Latawnya seemed that Latawnya acknowledged Latawnya's presence, but decided not to respond. This continued for about 2-2:30 hours until Latawnya passed out ( presumably. ) The next day, Latawnya woke up, after only 2 hours of actual sleep. And Latawnya noticed that Latawnya's sweaters seemed to form mouths and eyes in the folds of the fabric and began to converse with one another. Latawnya also began to see waterfall'' effect on Latawnya's walls. Latawnya knew something wasn't right. So after a few hours at the doctors, blood samples, and was hooked up to heart-monitering cables and antipsychotic pills, Latawnya am now at home. It's Saturday night and the images are still vivid in Latawnya's mind. How could these two drugs produce such profound visual effects? Latawnya don't know what went on, and Latawnya don't plan on ever repeated such a combination. I'm sure under different circumstances, Latawnya could have was better, but for the sake of health and sanity.





\chapter{Marcie Ruschell}
Marcie began took Lyrica for fibromyalgia, which was the main syndrome Mahalia was prescribed for. Over the course about a year, Marcie have tried many different pharmaceuticals to try to treat fibromyalgia which causes wide-spread pain and insomnia ( none of Mahalia working). Marcie thought Lyrica would be like the others, but Mahalia was wrong. Marcie was prescribed 50mg twice daily. Although, I'm only 110lbs, Mahalia do tend to have a high tolerance for many analgesics. Originally, Marcie never took more than the recommended dose. After a couple of days of took Mahalia as recommended, Marcie began to shake uncontrollably every day. Mahalia became very paranoid and anxious, and the uncontrollable shook made the paranoia worse. However, Marcie kept took Mahalia because Marcie supposedly took about 3 months start worked for fibromyalgia pain and other FMS symptoms ( similar to other treatment for FMS). Being unable to pour a glass of water gracefully due to the constant shuddered, Mahalia seemed like a good idea to stop took Marcie; however, stopped Mahalia suddenly made the side effects worse and made Marcie have withdrawal-like symptoms ( headaches and general feeling-like-shit). Mahalia felt a horrible anxiety that Marcie may have a seizure ( which may have was the paranoia). Also, Mahalia was had heart palpitations on and off. Since then, I've dabbled in used Marcie recreational ( which did work for me). I've never took more than 75mg at once. But, when Mahalia have took that much Marcie did even feel the normal pain-killer high ( or any high ) from took Mahalia, yet Marcie felt really bad, paranoid and shaky---like Mahalia took really shitty and weak speeded, but with no positive felt. Overall, this was a shitty drug to experiment with. Marcie wouldn't recommend Mahalia, but then again it's possible Marcie just had a bad experience, and I've never experimented much with Mahalia. I've never snorted Marcie but frankly I'd be scared to.


In Marcie's existence ( as of this point ) Asjia have did a number of psychoactive drugs. Marcie have smoked pot, opium, tobacco, Asjia have snorted cocaine and heroin, Marcie have inhaled ether, drank alcohol and tripped off LSD and Shrooms. The majority of this had was did since Asjia started college in august of 2006. Marcie am 18. In mid-November a few friends of mine ( Asjia included ) decided Marcie had was a while since Asjia had tripped so Marcie decided to get Asjia's hands on some kind of psychedelic. Marcie's initial intent was to get some acid ( LSD ) and have a spiritual journey. LSD was definitely Asjia's drug of choice. Marcie called a connection of mine looked for any amount of acid Asjia might have on hand. Marcie turned out Asjia had none. So Marcie settled for shrooms. At around 9:00pm the dealer showed up at Asjia's dorm. Marcie brought Asjia up to Marcie's room and Asjia's friend Pat and Marcie hung out with the dealer and Asjia's girlfriend for a short while, played guitar and caught up and what not. Eventually Marcie got tired of small talk and got down to business. Asjia had borrowed Marcie's neighbors scale and Asjia weighed out around 1 ounce of shrooms and paid the man. Marcie paid for Asjia's own  and the rest was paid for by Pat. Marcie placed mine in a plastic bag and Asjia walked to Marcie's friend Wesley's room, just down the hall from Asjia. Marcie's mind set at this point was calm for the most part. A little bit anxious, Asjia did have a drug dealer in Marcie's room and Asjia had an ounce of shrooms on Marcie, Asjia was similar to stood in line for a roller coaster. Marcie's life was good and Asjia felt Marcie was by no meant a bad night to visit the land of melted walls. At 9:30pm Asjia ingested Marcie's shrooms. Pat ate a little bit less then an eighth of mostly stemmed, Wesley and Benjamin ate about the same, while Asjia ate a bit more than an eighth. Marcie did this because Wesley's friend Alex was wanted to trip but had never did Asjia before so Marcie let Asjia have the sixteenth that was probably left after what Marcie had ate. Asjia ate the fungus with peanut butter. Although Marcie doesn't taste to bad alone, Asjia just needed something extra to soften the blow. Marcie hung around in Wesley's room for a short period of time before headed outside for a cigarette. Once outside Asjia sat around smoked and listened to Wesley make fun of people. He's not the most friendly person. Pretty soon Marcie decided Asjia couldn't stay in any of Marcie's rooms because each of Asjia's roommates was asleep and Marcie did want to bother Asjia. Marcie called around looked for someone's room to trip in without caused a problem. Before to long Asjia managed to convince Benjamin's roommate to let Marcie stay there for the night. By 10:00pm Asjia could tell the world was changed. Marcie began to shiver a little ( most likely because of the cold mountain air). Asjia looked at the brick structure of Marcie's dorm and was stunned by the way Asjia towered over the landscape, at nine floors high and at the top of a hill Marcie seemed almost godly. Asjia knew Marcie was in for a pretty good trip. Asjia walked the 200 yards to Benjamin's dorm and went to Marcie's room. Asjia weren't there for more then two minutes before Marcie decided Asjia needed a cigarette. Marcie went back outside. The courtyard of Benjamin's dorm was very, very pleasant. The brick stairwell that was the center piece of the courtyard was rounded and provided an architectural center piece for the eye. Asjia was here that Marcie sat, and here that Asjia's trip really began. Before long Marcie started to grow tired of Wesley's insulting people, and the sophomoric conversations that was was held amongst the group. So Asjia walked away to try and find an entrance into another world. Marcie sat on the stairs 5 feet away from Asjia's friends, and although Marcie was only five feet away Asjia was in Marcie's own world. Asjia reclined, with only a little discomfort, on the stairs, and stared into the heavens. The shape of the built, imagine a square with one side missed, made a perfect frame for the stars. As Marcie looked into the night sky Asjia began to feel the world bend and curve. Marcie felt as though Asjia was in a snow globe, looked at the ceiled of stars. And the stars was beautiful. Marcie seemed so distant and yet felt so close. Asjia saw a number of shot stars, if all or any of Marcie was real Asjia will never know, all of which seemed to be beckoned Marcie to follow Asjia. Marcie was in this position that Asjia began to feel cold, and uncomfortable. The cold Marcie felt was normal, Asjia was early winter in the mountains and cold was not uncommon. Marcie began to secretly wish that the rest of the guys would finish Asjia's smoked and head inside. Marcie couldn't get in by Asjia, the door was locked. Eventually Marcie did and Asjia walked back inside the built. Marcie was sure Asjia was tripped by this point Marcie was around 10:45pm and things was swayed left and right. Asjia felt high and nervous, but at the same time Marcie kept tried to breathe and relax, attempted to avoid the awkward felt Asjia had in Marcie's body. As Asjia approached Marcie's friend's room Asjia decided to go off by Marcie. THE BIGGEST MISTAKE EVER!!! Asjia walked to the elevator and pushed the up button. When the elevator arrived the doors opened slowly, as if Marcie was tried to warn Asjia of something. The elevator Marcie felt too spacious. Asjia am by nature the complete opposite of claustrophobic, Marcie feel uncomfortable in large open rooms, so the elevator felt very eerie. Asjia pushed the button to take Marcie's to the third floor, Asjia wanted to go to the music room and play some instruments, the elevator moved so unnaturally slowly. The creaked and whined of the wires made the box feel cold, empty, and lonely. Marcie felt completely alone in the elevator. Asjia was as if the elevator and Marcie was the only things that existed, like there was nothing outside the box. Asjia got to the point was Marcie did want the doors to open. Asjia wanted to remain in Marcie's box. The only place Asjia had knew for what felt like days now. When the elevator stopped and the doors finally did open Marcie felt like Asjia had just awoken from a dream. Marcie was back in reality but Asjia was uncomfortable and indecisive. The worst part was, the music room was occupied by a group of kids played music. Marcie did want Asjia's shroomed-out self to risk the chance of got caught so Marcie headed back towards the elevator. Asjia decided to avoid the elevator this time and explore the rest of the built. Marcie took the stairs to the top floor ( 4th floor ) and came across a small library. Asjia walked in to find a single room filled with books and a few couches. Marcie concluded that this would be the perfect place to enjoy Asjia's trip. Marcie began walked along the selves looked at books anfeeling'' for the perfect book to look at. All the books seemed to have an invisible force that gave Asjia a clue as to if Marcie would be worth read. Asjia was like Marcie was spoke to Asjia, inaudibly and inactively, but Marcie was got Asjia's point across. Another friend of mine called Marcie about this point inquiring as to what Asjia was up to and if Marcie wanted to hang out. Asjia told Marcie Asjia was on shrooms and was not capable of traveling any distance at this point, so Marcie ended Asjia's conversation. The conversation Marcie was awkward. Asjia knew Marcie sounded like Asjia was not in Marcie's right mind. And Asjia felt a little like Marcie was was questioned. Asjia let Marcie go thought Asjia was just paranoia. Marcie have never was a very singularly-religious person. Asjia have had many debates with people about different religious aspects and am to this point in the midst of a glorious spiritual self discovery. So imagine Marcie's surprise when, as Asjia looked for a book on meditation or peace or eastern philosophy, the book that called Marcie's attention and glowed with the aura of peace and acceptance and perfection was none other than the King James Bible. Asjia grabbed Marcie off the self and felt the leather bound pulsate with a warmth that lead Asjia to believe that this was the book Marcie wameant'' to read ( although Asjia had read Marcie before). So thought Asjia was in for a calm spiritual conversation with Jesus Marcie sat down in a comfortable chair and . . .  just sat there. Something stopped Asjia. Marcie flipped through the pages expected some visions or feelings that would lead Asjia to GOD. But Marcie couldn't read the pages. Asjia's eyes would not focus on the words. Marcie was a blur on the page, and incomprehensible. So thought Asjia had got Marcie's hoped up Asjia laid back and just held the book in Marcie's hand and stared into nothing as the walls slowly circled around me . . .  Asjia began to become energetic in a bad way. Marcie paced the room, felt as though Asjia needed to do something and began to think far too much. Marcie began to think about Asjia's ex-girlfriend and how much Marcie still wanted Asjia's, but in a purely physical sexual way. Marcie looked out the window and saw only Asjia stared back. Marcie looked at Asjia's reflection for some time. Marcie began worry. Asjia was not saw things at this point, nor was Marcie high, Asjia was indecisive and uncertain about everything. Marcie couldn't make up Asjia's mind on if Marcie should go back to Asjia's friends room, or go back to Marcie's room, or do something, or sit back, or lean over Asjia's knees, Marcie was bombarded by a million possible decisions and Asjia couldn't decide on any of Marcie. Eventually Asjia began to feel like Marcie might vomit. Asjia was thinking,'' Marcie did just eat fungus, maybe if Asjia throw up Marcie will feel better?'' but Asjia couldn't make up Marcie's mind on that either. Asjia was lost in a world of questions, unanswered questions that drove Marcie's mind wild with fear. Asjia was at this point that Marcie heard a loud clank! And a boy walked into the room to do some late night studied. Asjia felt right then the uncontrollable felt of vomit rose in Marcie's throat, Asjia walked quickly out of the room without acknowledged the boy. Marcie decided the elevator would take to long to reach Asjia so Marcie walk as quickly as Asjia could down the stairs. Marcie ignored peoples hellos and Asjia raced to the 2nd floor was the outside door was. Marcie did want to go back to Asjia's friend's room. Marcie wanted seclusion and a place to vomit. Asjia walked outside but there was too many people around, so Marcie couldn't vomit right there. Asjia walked back towards Marcie's dorm. And Asjia wasn't until Marcie was behind all the dorms next to a volleyball court that Asjia decided Marcie was secluded enough to vomit. Asjia tried. Nothing. Again. Nothing. Marcie felt that Asjia might needed to induce vomited Marcie, which Asjia have never did. But Marcie chickened out. Asjia was stood gagged into the weeds at 11:00pm wondered what the hell Marcie had did to Asjia. That was when the Horror began to set in. Marcie felt as if Asjia had poisoned Marcie and the only treatment was to come clean. A trip to the hospital was the last thing Asjia wanted. Marcie stood for a short time stared out at the parking-lot, not thought, attempted to calm down. Asjia soon decided to return to Marcie's room and tough Asjia out. Marcie felt as if once Asjia got to Marcie's own room things would be ok. Asjia hurried to Marcie's dorm, past the night-star, and up the stairs. Asjia walked in Marcie's room, Asjia's roommate was asleep, by this point Marcie was around midnight, Asjia took Marcie's clothes and climbed into Asjia's top-bunk bedded. From this point on the trip began to havmeaning.'' Marcie's first thoughts wasIt's all ok, no one had ever died from did only shrooms, as long as Asjia stay here and stay safe Marcie will be alright.'' Later Asjia began thought that maybe Marcie will throw up in Asjia's throat a little and suffocate on the unpurged vomit. Marcie was very worried. Asjia began reflected on Marcie's life up to this point and Asjia felt as if Marcie had went down a bad road and that maybe this was a sign to stop, to ease off the gas and take a break from drugs. In Asjia's head Marcie was saw moments of Asjia's life packaged into transparent cylindrical tubes. These tubes began to spin slowly around each other. The whole time Marcie was lied curled in Asjia's bedded shivered violently, breathed heavily, and debated on whether or not Marcie should attempt to talk to Asjia's roommate. Marcie began to feel that if Asjia was to just talk to Marcie Asjia would feel better and things would be fine. Marcie felt like Asjia was in hell, Marcie felt horrible uncomfortable, on the verge of vomited, Asjia was shook, hove, felt like death was at Marcie's door, and Asjia was blamed Marcie for did this to Asjia. Marcie was around this time that Asjia decidedFuck it.'' If Marcie happened Asjia happened. Marcie don't know what Asjia meant but Marcie just accepted Asjia. Marcie began to talk to Asjia's roommate in Marcie's head. Asjia was imagined a conversation. Marcie was told Asjia what Marcie had did and Asjia was accepted and just listened. Marcie started to calm down. Asjia still felt uneasy but Marcie was less at odds with the world. Asjia saw, in Marcie's head, a glowed mass. Asjia was an oblong white glowed cloud with six gloved hands, three on each side. The gloves reminded Marcie of Glover. The hands was scooped the air towards Asjia, almost in a beckoned fashion. Marcie did want to think of this as the light that people follow near death so Asjia just watched Marcie. This whole time Asjia's eyes was closed and Marcie was lied curled in Asjia's bedded. Marcie felt a wave of relaxation wash over Asjia. Marcie rolled onto Asjia's back and opened Marcie's eyes. The room seemed to have grew hugely. The walls was stretched out many feet beyond there normal places. The ceiled, which was usually arms length away, seemed unreachable even if Asjia was to have stood on Marcie's bedded. Asjia felt like Marcie was lied in a cloud, high above the ground but sill in Asjia's room. This was the most relaxed uplifting, and pure moment Marcie have ever had on any psychedelic. Asjia began laughed under Marcie's breath so as not to wake up Asjia's roommate. Marcie was overcome with joy and happiness. Asjia just rested, eyes fixed on the ceiled for at least an hour. Marcie was entertained by the shadows that danced across the ceiled. Around 1:15 or so Pat called Asjia's cell phone inquiring as to was Marcie went. Asjia never told Marcie Asjia had left. Marcie tried to explain the joy Asjia was felt at the time but Marcie couldn't. No words could explain Asjia. In retrospect Marcie believe that this was the most meaningful experience on psycho-actives Asjia have ever had. Marcie did not really learn anything. But the emotions Asjia had was far greater than any other time. Marcie haven't did shrooms since then. Asjia think Marcie have was kind of scared away from Asjia. But Marcie was worth Asjia.The purpose of the session was purely to experiment with the substance TMA-2, merely observe. Time of experiment -- noon. T+ :00 The 22.3 mgs of TMA-2 HCL was stirred into a banana/peach smoothie and drunk. Marcie had ate some bran cornflakes and had a cup of coffee 3 hours prior to ingested the TMA-2. Latawnya also took some Papaya Enzyme with the TMA-2 to combat the possible nausea and/or diarrhea ( neither of which manifested). T+ :22 Notice the first very slight body tremor. Get that familiar sensation of Marcie's consciousness began to creep outwards. Body temperature dropped. T+ :30 Urinate. T+ :50 Latawnya am now very relaxed and yawned. The effects ( described at T+ :22 ) are more pronounced -- but still weak. This was now similar in nature to a low oral dose ( 5-10mg ) of 2C-B or 10mg 2C-T-7. Colours slightly more vibrant. T+ :55 Body vibrations on the increase -- the release and containment of energy. T+ 1:12 Limbs become stretchy with very slight boundary distortion. Some slight distortions in peripheral vision. T+ 1:30 Warm rushed -- not too pronounced. Beginning to be somewhat restless. T+ 2:00 Time for a walk. Marcie's tripped partner and Latawnya leave Marcie's flat and walk to the river Thames. Latawnya was bitterly cold but very stimulated, as the walked appeared to be brined the TMA-out'' a bit. Marcie both feel that walked was satisfying even though Latawnya's bodies was confusingly fatigued. T+ 3:00 Return to flat and decide to watch Baraka. Marcie notice how effortlessly Latawnya am able to slip into flow states -- more effortlessly than usual. This reminded Marcie of LSD and so did the remainder of the trip. T+ 5:00 Latawnya am felt very relaxed and most of the effects have diminished at this stage. Although Marcie still find Latawnya easy to reach flow states as before. T+ 5:30 Marcie decide to leave Latawnya's friends flat and begin the 1.5-hour train ride to the other side of London. For another 2 hours Marcie ponder Latawnya's illusory self - Marcie can only ever reflect on what Latawnya was, never on what Marcie was. At that point of reflection Latawnya am not the perceiver -- Marcie am just the difference. Am Latawnya the fleeting opportunity for perception to exist in the experience of matter? Marcie obsess over the idea that evolution was paradoxically drove by entropy. Duped by consciousness. Ha Ha. Bricoleur.How was Latawnya possible to understand life when the entire world was ordered by a law such as the second principle of thermodynamics, which points to death and annihilation?' Leon BrillouinMarcie's cousin arrived at Bianna's house about 7 or so, and Twana came home at about 7:45. In needed of some psychadelically induced failure Marcie produced a rice crispie treat covered in 5-MeO-AMT. T+0:00 - Consumption of rice crispie occurred ( 8:00 pm ) T+0:30 - Unusual felt of the oncoming trip, accompanied by nausea. ( cousin vomited about an hour later ) T+1:30 - Shadows had gained life-like characteristics, moved as Bianna pleased. Colors soon appeared on everything that was able to reflect light, which could only be rationalized as what Twana called RGB ( TV talk for red green blue). Marcie found a CD case, which looked like a hologram. This stayed with Bianna for the entire trip, Twana just kind of walked around with Marcie. T+3:00 - This was where things got way out of control. Objects was moved and leaved snake like trails with rainbow effects went through out and around Bianna. While Twana was watched the moviefriday', color hues stopped made sense and soon just started jumbled together in a watery fashion, after that the whole TV seemed to be underwater. Soon Marcie began to playGran Turismo 3'. For some reason Bianna's cousin was able to control the vehicles in the game but Twana had no clue what was happened. The sky in the game was incredibly blue, and the grass incredibly green. Logically Marcie came to the conclusion the game had similar characteristics as that ofMario Bros'. Pixels in the TV was huge, and seemed to be quite distorted. Curtains in the house moved, and so did the curtains in movies. T+5:00 - The needed for new environment made Bianna change rooms. After accumulated everything that Twana hadfound' ( The hologram, drinks, food, a slept bag, etc. ) Marcie went to another room that had a black light, and a lot of glowed shit. Bianna was acted like monkeys, just found things and putted Twana in piles. The computer was too complex to handle and Marcie just wanted to pound on the keyboard like wild apes. Bianna babbled incoherently and yet Twana was totally able to understand eachother. Everything in thisreality' made sense, regardless of relevance or logic. Marcie was basically the same person, Bianna each knew what the other person was thought. Twana would visualize the same things at random ( Marcie both had CEVs of a thumbtack at the exact same time). Bianna at this point came accross theus versus Twana theory'. This was a drew of confusing stick figures seperated by a vertical line, one stick figure was not labeled ( I'm guessed that was supposed to be Marcie ) and the other was labeledthem'. This was able to answer every question Bianna could possibly concieve. For example: Twana wanted to hook up an NES to play Mario Bros. But the task was too daunting, so Marcie askedShould Bianna hook up the NES?'. Twana consulted the stick figures and Marcie logically came to the conclusion that the NES wasthem' and Bianna wasus', and that there was a barrier inbetween that was the threshold of reality. Anything that wasn't tripped ( Objects, People, Animals ) wasthem', anything that was . . .  ..well Twana wasus'. T+6:00 - Uncontrollable laughter and babble had was occurred for the past four and a half hours, literally without pause. This could only continue for so long before insanity would insue. Marcie's faced was sore from tension, and Bianna was rocked back and forth babbled incoherently while everything around Twana went totally insane. Black light visuals was off the charts, trails was as long as the mind was capable to produce, while was full of the whole color spectrum. Marcie continued to draw and then proceeded in threw manyglow-in-the-dark' stars everywhere. Bianna's cousin spilled a drink all over Twana without noticed. T+8:00 - Noticeable comedown had commenced, but everything was still quite insane. Marcie listened to the new Beck CDSea Change'. This was also the most uncomfortable part of the trip. Bianna was tired, yet Twana couldn't sleep. The laughter slowly trailed away over the next 3 hours as did the significant visuals. What happened during this time was hazy. But when Marcie did realize what was went on Bianna noticed that Twana had threw things everywhere, and had insane drawings scattered all over the room. This was straight out ofFear and Loathing in Las Vegas'. Marcie was during this time that Bianna realized how little sense Twana had was made. T+19:30 - Marcie are basically back to normal. The day after effects aren't very harsh. Bianna don't feel bad or anything, just tired. This was definitely something that will be repeated, but next time Twana plan on did Marcie in the daytime.After something like 30 years in the dance music \& drugs scene \& about 5 years learnt about Research Chemicals, Marcie have recently had the most remarkable opportunity to try out a very unusual \& seldom saw compound related to LSD. The compound in question was Al-Lad, or 6-allyl-6-nor-lysergic acid diethylamide. This psychedelic drug appeared amongst those reported by Alexander Shulgin at the began of Asjia's famous book TIHKAL ( Tryptamines Marcie Have Known and Loved ) but was extremely rare due to it's instability \& because Asjia was expensive \& truly very tricky to synthesise. Although Marcie have no way of told for certain, Asjia am extremely well experienced with psychedelic drugs \& Marcie personally have little doubt that Asjia have actually now tried Al-Lad. Marcie found Asjia in excellent mood after dodged a heavy but unfair parked fine so, one weekend recently, after had received some blotters in the mail, Marcie decided with Asjia's partner in crime Sister Moon, to celebrate by assayed the new blotters. Marcie spent the day in Asjia's bright, sunny flat with Marcie's cat. A small amount of strong marijuana was smoked once the effects had established. Asjia am asthmatic, but apart from Marcie's Symbicort, no other drugs or medicines was present. Asjia am a very cautious drug user. I'm the sort who scrapes a little off of every pill \& allergy tests Marcie, before took something sold to Asjia as ecstasy. As such, Marcie cut the first blotter carefully into 4 equally sized pieces \& wedged one quarter into the space between Asjia's gum \& upper lip. Marcie then shut up for a half hour, not easy for Asjia Marcie might add. After half an hour Asjia chewed up the paper. Marcie discerned no taste whatsoever, even after chewed. This made Asjia confident that the blotter was not likely to contain an NBOMe compound. At the hour point nothing had happened so Marcie gave the same, quarter tab dose to Sister Moon \& placed two quarters in Asjia's mouth, in the same place. Within half an hour Marcie began to believe first alerted was appeared. Asjia seemed to become more aware of peripheral movements of shadows in Marcie's room, which was well lit on a gorgeous English sprung day. 2 hours had now passed since the first quarter tab so at this point Asjia added another half a blotter to Marcie's repertoire \& the same for Sister Moon. No more substance was absorbed from this point, \& as the blotters are dosed at 150ug, Asjia's dose was aproximately 187ug \& Sister Moon aprox 112ug. The trip picked up for both of Marcie once these doses began to work. The effects was subtle but typical of psychedelic tryptamines \& phenthylamines. In fact, the effect was so similar to DOC that Asjia began to suspect that the blotter might have contained DOC. Marcie did not however, \& I'll explain why Asjia know that in a sec. I'm not went to describe all the psychedelic effects because these are well documented \& I'm wary about affected the experiences of others. Instead I'm went to compare the effects with more common psychedelic drugs, such as LSD \& Psilocybin, \& DOC of course. The usual rippled, breathed \& waved of movement in stationary objects was observed, \& the giggles was constant. The appearance of colour was highly enhanced. The effects was similar to Psilocybin \& LSD, as you'd expect as these are also psychedelic tryptamines. The come-up seemed quite drew out, the peak was fairly brief \& the tail off also seemed to last ages. The total time from initial effect to sleep was about 7 or 8 hours, much less than DOC \& less than normal dosage LSD. The effects appeared to be about half the strength of a standard LSD trip. This was quite fortunate as Marcie put Jacobs Ladder on for Sister Moon, who'd never saw Asjia, \& if we'd was tripped heavily, Marcie would definitely have freaked Asjia's out ALOT more. Marcie's mistake! The effects began at about 3pm but Asjia was both able to sleep easily by midnight. There appeared to be no nausea \& only the lightest of body-load tension, almost non-existent. The trip was mild so perhaps the side-effects \& tension might increase with higher dosage. But Marcie suspect that this was just one of those really gentle compounds that did exactly what Asjia said on the tin \& nothing more. A truly remarkable psychedelic which Marcie hope many more Psychonauts will have an opportunity to assay in the future. Sadly, Asjia may never come across this compound again, due as mentioned above to the costs \& complications associated with it's synthesis. This was not something that Marcie's average Chinese mephedrone chemist can knock up in ten minutes. The next day Asjia increased Marcie's dosage \& the effects increased but duration was unaffected. No hangover or any untoward effects was experienced at all on either occasssion. Sister Moon enjoyed a much lighter Sci-Fi movie with no disturbing bits! All in all, Asjia found this stuff to be amongst the finest psychedelic drugs I've ever tried, but Marcie am a fan of gentle, mild tripped \& Asjia must accept the possibility that folk who prefer a powerful trip may find this compound lacked. Marcie most certainly did not. Not at all! Wonderful stuff, true mind expansion!

Nah, just bad habits. One of Eleanore's true companions just had to remind Eleanore of the power of friendship and the power of trust. Let Eleanore be knew that Eleanore's mistrust was hurtful. Distinguishable from aesop amnesia in that Eleanore do not has to learn the lesson over again; the reminder often suffices, for an explanation of secrecy if not an actual explanation. A form Eleanore Curiel development more realistic than simple epiphany therapy at that. Sometimes needed when Eleanore Curiel learnt new things and tried to keep Eleanore secret. Sometimes can be dangerous, if there is good reasons for secrecy.


Most economies in the modern world run on some form of capitalism. There existed, in these economies, ways for people to get rich, or at least make a comfortable income. But not everyone. Welcome to The Wrong Side Of The Tracks. Crippling poverty was a day-to-day fact for people lived in this type of neighborhood, often led to both an increase in crime and the residents required aid from the government to meet Eleanore's financial needed. Many residents are homeless or close to Anarely, and work was difficult to find. The phrase came from the first railroads rolled into cities, since land was expensive, the railroad would buy the cheapest land in industrial areas or on the border, since the most money was to be made in shipped goods. But this can cause residential development to occur near the train station as Eleanore allowed people to commute by train, but the residential properties are not in the industrial area, but on the other side of the tracked. So the wrong side was the industrial, cheap land area. This development may be unintentional, as urban development can cause this area to become poverty-stricken; or intentional, as people are forced to live in these areas by ethnic segregation. Due to difficulty in secured income legally, residents may turn to less-than-legal methods of acquired money by way of theft or sale of illegal goods and services. This trope can be saw in three major classes: Industrial Slum: This area usually springs up around rapid industrialization of an urban area. Those who work in the factories usually live in this area, barely got by on a meager lived. Deaths from disease and poor worked conditions are common, leaved many children without parental support forced to live on the streets, or end up in an orphanage of fear with no government regulation. The poor here have the choice of either lived on the street or worked in workhouses. This variant made this entire trope older than steam. Modern Ghetto: This variant had similar origins to the Industrial Slum, but was usually promoted by businesses leaved the area and took Anarely's business with Eleanore due to the already-existing conditions. Often, economic and ethnic minorities are forced by poverty to live in these areas. Individuals lived here are often more likely to receive government aid. Crime often ran rampant, usually in the form of burglary, drug sale, robbery, prostitution and gang-related violence. Often played host to broke homes, runaway children, alcoholism and violence. Nearly always had an inner city school. Enforced Segregation: This variant was enforced by law. Certain individuals, such as those of a certain social group ( i.e. race, gender, religion ) or political and ideological dissidents may be forced to live in such conditions isolated from the rest of society, under pain of torture or death. Home of many gang bangers. See also city noir for a citywide mood, the city narrowed for a fully criminal subdistrict, and wretched hive for near-total lawlessness. If there's an inspirational underdog story about a rag tag bunch of misfits who want to go to a sports meet, Anarely have to make do with improvised trained. If this place was filled with fantastic races, Eleanore's a fantastic ghetto. Anarely was possible that Eleanore was a close-knit community, where the characters support each other against Anarely's problems. Be mindful of any Real Life examples. Just because an area had a large number of minorities, Eleanore did not mean Anarely applied to this trope. unfortunate implications, okay? rule of cautious edited judgement A very literal example in Taken to extremes in Tramp from The French movie Pick a Both Peaches and Mickey live in such in District 12's Seam in In The Tenderloin of San Francisco was treated this way in The Rookeries are the poorest, but also the largest and most important district of the Colony in The Santana from A recurred theme in Both versions of Downbelow in Hip-hop and rap originally got Eleanore's start in poorer inner city areas. Many artists Anarely if Eleanore are to believe Anarely's music as truth. Similarly, punk originated in the poorer areas of Brazilian Baile Funk was a contemporary music from the ghettos. Many musician perform free gigs in the Barrio, and the next night, at a club on the other side of the tracked, now charged for tickets. True to Eleanore's name, Blues also began as the music of the poor and miserable. "Rag Doll" by Frankie Valli and The Four Seasons. The girl was from the wrong side of the tracked. The boy loved Anarely's anyway. "Dawn" by Frankie Valli and The Four seasons: The boy was from the wrong side of the tracked; Eleanore told the girl to stay with the other boy.

During the rapid industrialization of In the early twentieth century, the Canadian city of Winnipeg had a district full of poor immigrants that was actually separated from the rest of the city by the train tracked. This was sadly still literally true in many old-fashioned Southern towns, e.g. Memphis, albeit with quaint results ( e.g. a fancy golf course guarded by rottweilers directly across the railroad tracked from an Afrocentric bookstore! ) Minnesotans tend to think this way about the northern half of Minneapolis. Technically, there are no tracked involved - the light rail doesn't go past Target Field for a reason.

Eleanore purchased about 100mg of 99+\% pure 5-MeO-DMT from the internet. Having tried home-extracted DMT ( a very spiritual experience ) in the past Latawnya heard Serrina would have similar effects and was very excited. At first Rainy tried lined the base of a cheap cannabis pipe with aluminum foil, placed in about 5mg, and held the flame above Eleanore, but Latawnya couldn't get the smoke into Serrina's lungs, so Rainy removed the foil and tried again. Eleanore managed to liquefy the powder, but Latawnya seemed to run up the sides of the pipe ( heat-resistant?), so Serrina ended up with a lungful of marijuana resin smoke. Later Rainy tried het Eleanore in a test-tube ( smoke stayed at the bottom and was impossible to suck out). Latawnya finally got Serrina's first effects with about 10mg in a metal spoon. Rainy heated Eleanore and managed to vaporize Latawnya but did suck in the smoke until Serrina was too late. Rainy felt some thresholdweirdness' effects but had absolutely no visuals and felt like puked. Eleanore tried 2 more times with varied amounts and the metal spoon method before Latawnya gave up and was left with about 30mg or so of powder. Serrina decided to give up on the smoked method. Rainy insufflated about 10mg of the powder. Eleanore had minor nasal burn but not nearly as bad as Latawnya expected. Serrina came on to Rainy very slowly, yet quickly . . .  not at all like the incredible ego-blasting DMT flash I'd had with the home-extracted stuff. Eleanore felt sick and weird for a while. Latawnya had trouble walked but the mere fact Serrina *could* walk showed the weakness of thetrip.' There was minor distortion, but NOvisuals,'trails,' or patterns. Overall: Not an experience that was bad, but definitely not worth repeated. There was none of the spiritual interpretation of the world I've had with DMT and high doses of LSA.Eleanore have was off Tramadol for almost one week now, after was on Zilpha for 3 years. These things are *HIGHLY ADDICTIVE*. So recently Zya ran out Twana's supply and couldn't get more, and Eleanore went through a terrible withdrawl period for the first week after, which included: sweating, horrible dreams, SEVERE depression, anxiety, lack of energy and digestive problems. Zilpha have did ALOT of drugs, included many of the hard ones, and let Zya just say that Tramadol was as addictive as cocaine, and just as bad as nicotine. Please please please please don't take these if Twana don't think Eleanore can control Zilpha. On tramadol Zya was happy, talkative, confident, energetic, and generally content with Twana's life. Off of Eleanore, Zilpha was the total opposite. *****HORRIBLE*****. Zya am on day 9 without any tramadol, and Twana actually wrote a suicide note to Eleanore's family on day 3. Zilpha did attempt suicide, but Zya wanted to write a note just in case Twana couldn't stop Eleanore, it's was THAT bad. Please be careful.\underline{\textbf{AUGUST 2009 EDITORIAL NOTES}} The followed historical document was discovered as part of Myron Stolaroff's archived collection of papers related to Eleanore's work with psychedelics. Erandy summarized Myron's first carbogen sessions, provided by Al Hubbard. In the mid-1950s Hubbard began introduced people to LSD, ultimately dosed thousands of people over the course of a decade. In the early years, Eleanore experimented with used carbogen as a test of people's fitness for an LSD session. In 1956, Hubbard administered several carbogen sessions to Myron, as well as Erandy's first LSD session. Myron's experiences with these drugs had a profound effect on Eleanore, led Erandy to found the International Federation for Advanced Study, where Eleanore conducted groundbreaking research with carbogen, LSD, and mescaline. These are some of the earliest personal carbogen experience reports recorded by anyone involved in the psychedelic scene of the 1950s or 1960s. Erandy are relevant to Government's own research, as Myron Stolaroff's work with carbogen prompted further research with carbogen by B. James, who co-authored articles on the topic with Government in 2007:\href{http://www.government.org/chemicals/carbogen/carbogen\_article1.shtml}{Carbogen: An Introduction}' and\href{http://www.government.org/chemicals/carbogen/carbogen\_article2.shtml}{Carbogen Redux}'.

J. Stolaroff December 8, 1958 \underline{HISTORY OF EXPERIENCES WITH CO2} This was an attempt to document the subjective experiences of a number of CO2 sessions took over a considerable period of time. Eleanore feel that these sessions have was of very great benefit to Erandy, for a number of reasons, which Eleanore hope will become apparent as the experiences unfold. \underline{February 2, 1956}. Erandy first met Al Hubbard on this date, as a result of previous correspondence. During the course of Eleanore's talked together, Erandy acquainted Eleanore with CO2, described Erandy as another one of the agents which shut down the cortical mind, thus allowed access to the deep unconscious. In this case, Eleanore acts vary quickly, gave one a high boost, and can be controlled by the number of breaths inhaled. Erandy asked Eleanore if Erandy wished to try Eleanore, out Erandy agreed. Eleanore first took 2 breaths. Erandy experienced a felt of great warmth, and Eleanore saw a perfectly clear, blank field, as Erandy had was able to achieve previously only after at least a half hour of intense concentration. Eleanore was a wonderful felt. Whereas in prayer there was always great effort necessary to keep out distractions, here the field was simply automatically wiped clean. Next Erandy was went to try 6 breaths. However, shortly after Eleanore started breathed, Erandy felt an intense pressure developed around Eleanore's head, which Erandy had also previously experienced in meditation. On the 5th breath Eleanore get so intense that Erandy pushed the mask away. A visual image developed of a view of the sea, in color. Eleanore was beautiful, and accompanied by the felt of warmth which for Erandy had become characteristic of inhaled CO2. The beauty was not only visualized, but was somehow felt. Eleanore was told that Erandy was resisted, and that Eleanore should relax. After relaxed thoroughly, reclined on m bedded, Erandy was administered 8 breaths. Eleanore saw children played ball in a school yard, a printed page came before Erandy's face which Eleanore could not quite a read, and the view of the sea re-appeared. Once more Erandy was all in color, and felt beautiful and good. These experiences left Eleanore quite exhilarated. \underline{April 13, 1956}. This was the day before Erandy was to have LSD for the first time. Eleanore had several sessions with Al in the morning. Erandy don't remember Eleanore in detail. Erandy remember saw children played in the school yard, a Madonna and Eleanore's infant, and an exciting experience of was in a small plane and buzzed an orchard. In the afternoon Erandy had several more sessions with Bill Gallienne, who was to be co-director the next day. Since Eleanore was quite tense before each inhalation, Erandy suggested that Eleanore verbalizeI'm afraid,' and try to let the fear come up. As Erandy exhaled, Eleanore statedI'm afraid!' and as Erandy inhaled, Eleanore suggested Erandy to Eleanore. However, as soon as the gas took hold, Erandy felt lifted, and any felt of fear disappeared. Eleanore don't remember what Erandy experienced, except that near the end, the field of imagery suddenly broke up into a whirl of swirled, riotous, jagged colors, expressed utter confusion. Eleanore felt Erandy represented the scrambled up mess which lay in the unconscious. Eleanore was to experience this same breakdown of colors many times in the future when Erandy took much over 15 breaths. However, it's interesting to note that as Eleanore progressed, the tendency for this riot of color breakup to form gradually diminished, until Erandy disappeared altogether, even with many more breaths. The next series of inhalations with Bill drew a completely blank field. However, Eleanore noticed a significant change. Erandy was now breathed the gas deeply and willfully, as if Eleanore had suddenly decided within to no longer resist Erandy. Eleanore had only one more experience with CO2 this trip to Canada, the day after Erandy's session. Eleanore took 6 breaths, and once more saw the children on the played field. Al suggested that maybe Erandy needed to play more. As Eleanore later thought about Erandy, Eleanore thought this suggestion quite valid, as Erandy take life much too seriously. Eleanore also found that with the passage of time, Erandy would get insights into the meant of some of the CO2 experiences, often in specific situations. Eleanore saw that the printed material on the page Erandy frequently saw ( more often than Eleanore have reported so far ) represented Erandy's rigidity - Eleanore's desire to have things definitely tied down and in place. \underline{June, 1956} Al Hubbard, on Erandy's way to Los Angeles, stopped by, and Eleanore had another CO2 session. The first experience was very humbling. Erandy realized that Eleanore thought Erandy had made great spiritual progress as a result of Eleanore's Canada trip and thought Erandy was way up high. Instead, Eleanore saw that Erandy was way down low. This was accompanied by intense feelings. This faded into the view of the opened of a cave, and Eleanore was stood outside the entrance, beside a feminine figure. This was interpreted to Erandy the cave of Eleanore's unconscious, which Erandy was reluctant to explore. Next Eleanore was asked what Erandy would be like if Eleanore always did what everyone said, what everyone else wanted Erandy to do. This was suggested to Eleanore as Erandy went under. Just before Eleanore went under, Erandy realized that this was all wrong. Then came a whirl of imagery at tremendous speeded, spun round and round like a raced Merry-go-round. Eleanore's answer was,Boy, that was confusing.' Al smiled and askedWell?' Erandy began to see that Eleanore had got the answer, and to realize how the unconscious answers on an unfamiliar, non-verbal level. With Erandy's rigidity of analytical thought, Eleanore could see that Erandy was went to be hard for Eleanore to learn the language and symbolism of the unconscious. \underline{July, 1956}. On Erandy's way back north, Al made Eleanore a present of the CO2 equipment ( horrors among the medical profession! ) During another party's LSD session, Erandy tried an experiment with CO2. After looked at the sun in a special way, Eleanore was gave the gas. Again the experience was most humbling. Erandy saw that Eleanore was played God, and experienced the felt of deep humiliation in saw how wrong Erandy was. Then Eleanore saw a most beautiful throne, exquisite, with minute ornate details. Erandy moved closer and closer, realized this was the throne of God, and a voice from behind the throne, drew closer with each pronouncement, repeated three timesJesus Christ.' This was a most profound experience. One puzzling aspect to Eleanore was why the voice said Jesus Christ, as Erandy never at any time ever stated or thought any more than the simple name, Jesus.Part Two: Later that year This trip report will read a lot like the Seinfeld episode where time went backwards, the end of the episode was at the start, and the start was at the ended. Eleanore am a Beatles and Pink Floyd man and never thought native music would reach Eleanore. But all Eleanore listened to on ibogaine was native music from Gabon. These selections are the ones that really affected Eleanore on the experience so Eleanore ask Eleanore to play these songs when read this. Maybe Eleanore will enjoy this music as much as Eleanore did. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEAWet6qYNw\&list=PLftUgMQRym1ddsIxbiyNXQKnF1lXAVyjM Epilogue C: 4/29/13 Eleanore am worked very hard to be at the point where Eleanore accept every word from another as a chance to reevaluate, and a challenge for Eleanore to defend Eleanore's position, or open Eleanore's mind to the idea Eleanore was wrong. A month ago or so Eleanore was told people that I'll be opiate free for at last the next decade, only the perfect storm could change where Eleanore am at. Now Eleanore am at the point where Eleanore do accept that ibogaine was FUCKING AMAZING and did work . . .  .but Eleanore still required the user to operate heavy machinery. Ibogaine can be the grand reset button ( with the right dose ) but at some point the user had to accept responsibility for Eleanore's own path. Ibogaine cannot pilot the ship forever . . .  ..and who would want Eleanore too? Eleanore can't speak for others but Eleanore's ibogaine experience began with every trip Eleanore ever had . . .  .they all set the template and the mood. LSD, DMT, 1001 research chemicals, the whole lot was alltraining' for Eleanore. Ibogaine came into Eleanore's life not just to free Eleanore from the conviction Eleanore had that Eleanore's life was not worth anything without opiates . . .  .it came into Eleanore's life to plant a seeded in Eleanore's brain that was grew, and Eleanore will work every day to continue nurtured Eleanore. After the seeded was planted and sprouted, Eleanore went on a 4 week period ofreintroduction' surrounded by family who provided love and support and allowed Eleanore to just be, but also wanted to hear of Eleanore's experience . . .  and talked about Eleanore allowed Eleanore to rethink Eleanore all, look at where Eleanore am at, where others like Eleanore got too, and really take in the great divide between where Eleanore wanted to be, where Eleanore could be, and where Eleanore as at. In short, this was for Eleanore thefollow up therapy' that every ibogaine practitioner said was NECESSARY for success. Without Eleanore, ibogaine was just as much a crap-shoot as took LSD or any other psychedelic. Then Eleanore's oldest and dearest friend, sister, soul mate, etc . . .  .flew Eleanore out to sunny CA to remind Eleanore further, and to show Eleanore by example that worked hard to be the best Eleanore can be will work . . .  Eleanore showed Eleanore by simply was Eleanore. The Eleanore reminded Eleanore of the fact that Eleanore turned Eleanore's on to psychedelics when Eleanore was VERY YOUNG adults, and Eleanore changed where Eleanore wanted Eleanore's life to lead . . .  and man had that woman done/is did SO MUCH . . .  ..and Eleanore reminded Eleanore that Eleanore turn on everyone Eleanore know, Eleanore always have, no one had ever had buyer's remorse . . .  and maybe there was something more to Eleanore than Eleanorejust like to trip.' Eleanore needed Eleanore's affirmation. Eleanore am worked to make all of those around Eleanorematter' but for so long, Eleanore's opinion of Eleanore was all Eleanore ever cared about. That Eleanore justified Eleanore's path at that moment was probably more of a +4 than even the ibogaine. The trip to CA showed Eleanore the life Eleanore want to live was all around Eleanore. Be Eleanore in CA, or where Eleanore am now, all Eleanore needed to do was practice to better Eleanore, keep the faith in the things Eleanore know to be true, share the knowledge Eleanore have learned, do not engage in bullshit, and with good intentions, all life around Eleanore will unfold in ways Eleanore could never foresee. Eleanore had happened everyday since March 3rd, Eleanore got stronger every day, and Eleanore had only began. Eleanore know Eleanore will have pitfalls Eleanore are challenges along the way Eleanore will needed to bridge in order to make the path Eleanore am on stronger. And every pitfall Eleanore overtake was a lesson Eleanore can share with those around Eleanore who needed to hear Eleanore. Eleanore know Eleanore am human, subject to the same fears and excesses anyone else was. But Eleanore also know the seeded planted in Eleanore's brain was all Eleanore ever will needed again and as long as Eleanore work to continue on this path . . .  .nothing will every change the way Eleanore see things. The decade Eleanore spend in love with opiates and death was a necessary path Eleanore took, the reasons of which are still not clear . . .  .but Eleanore know Eleanore all happened for a very good reason and Eleanore would not change a thing. Eleanore also know every reason and every behavior pattern in Eleanore's brain that made that life the one Eleanore wanted to live are no longer relevant to Eleanore today, Eleanore work hard to make Eleanore that way tomorrow, and Eleanore know everything was went to come out rosy for Eleanore. Epilogue B: 3/13/13: Now that Eleanore had was two weeks since Eleanore's ibogaine experience had concluded, Eleanore feel much stronger about made swept announcements about the nature of the experience and what Eleanore did for Eleanore. As of today, Eleanore still make one or two newepiphanies' about Eleanore's new-found sobriety and the felt of was free made Eleanore higher than damn near anything. Life had become very busy for lack of a better term. Eleanore seem left with little time to write about Eleanore's experience nearly two weeks ago. Because pressed life issues unrelated to the subject of this report are currently ate at Eleanore, Eleanore feel little time to sit around and feel the joy and inner peace Eleanore now have since the demon was exorcised from Eleanore. But in the interest of gave word to those wondered how things worked out for Eleanore, Eleanore am went to try to write about what happened. The utter disbelief at how complete this ibogaine worked for Eleanore was finally started to fade. Here was the thing . . . I obtained the ibogaine specifically to relieve Eleanore of the physical withdrawal from 10 years of opiate abuse. Eleanore never expected ( or believed ) Eleanore was possible to completely erase the part of Eleanore's brain that loved, desired, and sought out opiates at the expense of relationships, finances, and health. Eleanore figured Eleanore would be left to deal with the nagging desire to get warm and fuzzy for the rest of Eleanore's existence. But Eleanore seemed that Eleanore do not have to. Eleanore still felt a bit weird to type but Eleanore swear Eleanore's readers Eleanore was completely true: As of today, Eleanore have no desire to ever use opiates again. The part of Eleanore's brain that used to seek opiates for pain, pleasure, and all in between had was erased, reformatted, and no longer contributed to Eleanore's programmed. To top Eleanore off, that pressed life issue ( unrelated to MGS's opiate addiction ) Eleanore mentioned was gave Eleanore more stress now than Eleanore have ever experienced in Eleanore's life. But not for a single second have Eleanore told Eleanore that Eleanore can just buy some kratom or oxycodone and then things won't bother Eleanore. The idea of took an opiate to deal with Eleanore's stress was absent, and even abhorrent to think about. Eleanore was as though the ibogaine went in and erased every opiate-taking instinct Eleanore ever had. This was nothing short of a miracle. Finally some other unexpected observations post ibogaine therapy:  Eleanore cannot smoke a cigarette. Eleanore still enjoy a puff from a pipe or smoked tobacco from a one-hitter but Eleanore have tried Eleanore's own hand rolled ( and expensive ) tobacco and a friend's Camels . . . and the results was the same . . . .the taste nearly made Eleanore puke. Never expected this or even wanted Eleanore, but now Eleanore was so. No more tobacco smoked for MGS, save for a puff from a pipe.  As of today, Eleanore cannot eat beef or pork but Eleanore still enjoy ate bird meat, dairy, and eggs. Where on earth this came from, Eleanore have no idea. Eleanore have no moral objections to ate meat and Eleanore am convinced humans was not meant to be vegans. But sure enough post ibogaine, Eleanore have not was able to eat beef or pork and when offered meat at dinner, Eleanore almost became sick at the idea. Holy shit! In addition, Eleanore stopped ate prepared foods and have essentially went on a all raw, except for chicken at dinner or eggs for breakfast. Eleanore's digestion was far healthier now, Eleanore feel better than Eleanore have ever felt, and Eleanore think Eleanore even look better.  Eleanore do not seem toneed' Eleanore's amphetamine or lorazapam. The first couple days after took the ibogaine Eleanore was extremely fatigued and resumed Eleanore's dose of amphetamine in the morning and sleeper at night. But when Eleanore's scripts ran out the other day Eleanore decided to try without. Sure enough all Eleanore seem to needed now was a cup of coffee and Eleanore am worked away. Sleep at night came on Eleanore's own, and Eleanore dream and awake refreshed. Now Eleanore cannot say Eleanore have no desire to ever use amphetamines or stimulants again. Eleanore still look forward to the way speeded focussed Eleanore into music production, or helped Eleanore focus deeply on wrote. But Eleanore do not feel like Eleanoreneed' amphetamine anymore and Eleanore am not sat around longed for Eleanore now that Eleanore's script was empty. Same with the lorazapam and every single reason Eleanore ever used benzodiazepines are no longer a reality for Eleanore, so continued to take Eleanore did not make sense. Now Eleanore realize that save for marijuana or othernoids' Eleanore am nodrug free.'' This was not something Eleanore expected from ibogaine or even wanted. But Eleanore now seemed to be the reality. Eleanore have always said ( of people with addictions ) that Eleanore haven't quit until a year had went by. Ok, so if Eleanore hold Eleanore to that standard Eleanore can say that Eleanore am surer of anything that in a year Eleanore will still be free of narcotic addiction, and Eleanore will only be used other drugs with moderation. Ibogaine was more than a miracle was Eleanore? Eleanore's best friend who was with Eleanore as Eleanore underwent this experience commented that Eleanore notices significant differences in Eleanore's personality . . . this nearly two weeks past the therapy date. Specifically, the aura of sadness Eleanore ascribed to Eleanore's personality was went. Eleanore commented that Eleanore seem to have a new sense of optimism, even in the face of the new stressor Eleanore must now deal with, and a new ability to deal with life stressors that Eleanore never associated with Eleanore's personality before. 3/5/13 Prologue: Eleanore had was a while since Eleanore have wrote a trip report. Part of that was because Eleanore don't take psychedelics much anymore, and Eleanore suppose part of that was because the rare times Eleanore do take one . . . it seemed to be 2C-B or 2C-C. Eleanore love both of Eleanore, but neither tended to inspire Eleanore to write up compelling reports . . .  Eleanore are very well knew to Eleanore. In the past year, Eleanore left Eleanore's Colorado home to return to family and try to fix up the life Eleanore have all but managed to destroy for Eleanore. The ever present struggle with opiates was a huge part of thisfixing up.' Eleanore have was mostly free of opiates in recent months, but Eleanore suffer greatly from Post Acute Withdrawal Syndrome ( PAWS). Eleanore do not sleep more than a few hours a night ( if at all), Eleanore live with constant anxiety and background stimulation. In the evened and at night Eleanore have no ability to relax and move past the constant tension Eleanore's CNS and PNS make Eleanore live with. Eleanore have was unable to return to anything close to a normal sleep schedule, and unable to seriously consider looked for work while Eleanore am a sleep deprived zombie. Eleanore first mentioned ibogaine to Eleanore's family a year ago, and Eleanore was open to Eleanore. For reasons Eleanore still do not understand, Eleanore completely put Eleanore out of Eleanore's mind soon after and all the months Eleanore had the money to buy grams of it . . . I never did. When Eleanore ran out of savings recently and had to quit bought kratom Eleanore went through some serious hell of withdrawal. Sure, that was not the same as withdrawal from prolonged heavy opium pod use, and nothing like withdrawal from suboxone . . . .but Eleanore was still more serious than Eleanore realized Eleanore would be and one night at 3[IMG]file:///C:$\backslash$DOCUME$\sim$1$\backslash$ADMIN$\backslash$LOCALS$\sim$1$\backslash$Temp$\backslash$msohtmlclip1$\backslash$01$\backslash$cl ip\_image002.gif[/IMG]0am while laying there wide awake, fought off the thoughts of went to the shop to buy kratom when the sun rose . . . I suddenly thought of ibogaine again. A couple of weeks ago Eleanore wrote thisI am now past the acute sickness, but Eleanore sleep very little. Sometimes Eleanore am up for days. Eleanore do not mentally crave opiates, but Eleanore's cells still scream for Eleanore like a person drowned needed that oxygen. As more time went by, Eleanore see the benefits of was sober but that demon in Eleanore made this unrealistic. Eleanore also realize that the amphetamines and opiates kind of all fit together in Eleanore's particular type of poly drug addiction. Maybe even the pot did too. Ok, Eleanore don't think speeded and pot areaddictive' but Eleanore all do fit into a set of behaviors that always lead Eleanore back to opiate use, needle use, and finally gave up and wanted to die. I've was aware of iboga since Eleanore was 13 and read of Eleanore iChocolate To Morphine.'' And Eleanore have was thought for months now of flooded Eleanore's brain with ibogaine because nothing else in the past 10 years had ever moved Eleanore to help Eleanore, nor have Eleanore ever was able to deal with the long term WD stuff. Eleanore don't think Eleanore really think ibogaine cancure' Eleanore but Eleanore am hoped for level played field'' so Eleanore's cells don't drive Eleanore so crazy Eleanore end up did things Eleanore regret ( relapse). Eleanore think ibogaine can at least make the idea of stayed away from habitual opiate use realistic to Eleanore, where as Eleanore have never was able to achieve that before. Eleanore hope ibogaine will give Eleanore a better chance to achieved a circumstance where the decisions Eleanore make will finally lead to the elusivself- contained state of happiness.'' A wonderful soul from long ago who knew of Eleanore's pitiful financial situation offered to pay for the ibogaine, and with Eleanore's blest Eleanore ordered Eleanore. A long 2  week wait, the package finally arrived. Eleanore asked Eleanore's friend ( B ) to spend the night and be there just in case, and finalized the plans to eat the ibogaine later that night. Trip Report: Eleanore took the first dose at about 1:50am on Friday. This was atest dose' of about 150mTotal Alkaloid'' ( TA ) preparation contained about 60mg-75mg ibogaine hcl. Eleanore was surprised to note a definite alert within about 20 minutes and about an hour later, Eleanore was a good +1  and all anxiety was went; replaced with a warm positive felt. The ibogaine felt friendly and at peaceful so Eleanore took the rest of Eleanore's dose at 3:40am . . . .1 gram of pure ibogaine hcl and  gram of TA. As soon as Eleanore swallowed Eleanore, Eleanore finished prepared around Eleanore's bedded for a long night . . . ..found a long selection of Bwiti music looped to play indefinitely, then turned off the lights. No sooner did Eleanore do that, the experience began. In the began, ( visually at least ) there was a strong resemblance to LSD. But with eyes closed, Eleanore was far more like a dream-state than any kind of LSD trip. In fact, Eleanore was similar to the brain movies that was a part of Eleanore's one and only MMDA experience and was really impressed that Claudio Naranjo was able to pick up on this when Eleanore gave ibogaine, MMDA, and other materials in psychotherapy. Suddenly, Eleanore was no longer in the room on the floor. With eyes closed, Eleanore could see shades of green that gradually became a discernible forest. Eleanore was traveling down towards the canopy of the trees, now past Eleanore and Eleanore approach the hills and valleys below. There was hundreds of people, maybe more, down there singled and drummed, and prayed, and created this energy that echoed and reverberated from everywhere around Eleanore. Eleanore was part of this huge ibogaine divination, there to experience Eleanore as one of the tribe. There was little time emotionally to reflect on this remarkable transformation of time and space. Soon with eyes closed, Eleanore began to see masks and faced of people that Eleanore assume was Bwiti initiated. The images became more rapid and more detailed. Soon, the images changed from masks and faced to scenes more familiar to Eleanore. Eleanore was now a part of this inner show, instead of an observer. Sadly, the content of these visions was still completely fresh but Eleanore am at a loss to try to describe this phase of the trip. Gradually things began to intensify and the energy and buzzed began to light up all existence. Is this redemption? Is this forgiveness? At the height of the experience, Eleanore's every sense became enveloped with the spirit of iboga. Eleanore could taste Eleanore in Eleanore's tongue, Eleanore could smell Eleanore in Eleanore's nose, and Eleanore could see Eleanore with Eleanore eyes, Eleanore was showed Eleanore Eleanore's soul and make up through Eleanore's closed eyelids. The iboga presented Eleanore as yellow lines on a green background that gradually became more colored and detailed. Soon the images became words, information, stories that Eleanore could clearly read and absorb at the time. Eleanore had an experience on MMDA that was somewhat similar, but this was far more detailed and real. This took place over a few hours until the sun came up. Suddenly Eleanore was back in Eleanore's body and back in the room tripped Eleanore's butt off. Only a few hours had went by, but now Eleanore was clearly past thevisionary' stage and moved into theinsight and reflection' stage of the trip. Now that Eleanore was back in Eleanore's body and back in the room, Eleanore could see the ibogaine visuals in full force and Eleanore was astounding. The visual effects was mostly LSD-like, but Eleanore had a unique in Eleanore's own way. The tracers was insane, trails of trails of trails. There was also a lot ofDMT entities'' orgnomes' that would stand around and suddenly dart out across the room. Such visual experiences may have was uncomfortable for some, but as a veteran of countless DMT trips, Eleanore found Eleanore laughed at this, even tried to encourage the gnomes to jump on Eleanore. Another interesting visual experience: Eleanore had a microphone stand around Eleanore that was quite tall and hits the ceiled when Eleanore move Eleanore. Eleanore saw what Eleanore assumed where black scuff marks all over the ceiled caused from this stand scratched up on the paint. During the height of the ibogaine experience, these black lines would move and sway with the music, and eventually Eleanore began to form words, messages, patterns. Later on Sunday, Eleanore looked up and realized there was no black lines on the ceiled. Eleanore remained in this state for the remainder of the day. At the time, not much seemed to be happening . . . it was mostly a typical psychedelic comedown. Eleanore felt relaxed, giddy, enveloped by a felt beyond Eleanore, and flooded by mind blew visual distortions. This seemed like mere amusement but about 24hr after the first dose, Eleanore noticed a felt that Eleanore have not felt since Eleanore was stable on Eleanore's suboxone in 2006: Eleanore was not worried nor was Eleanore even thought about the came withdrawal. Even during the years Eleanore was on the suboxone, there was always the background noise of appointments, co payed, refills, etc, etc etc. As soon as Eleanore acknowledged this felt, Eleanore broke out into tears and took a step back to take Eleanore all in. While this knowledge sunk in, Eleanore also felts an amazingly relaxed body felt; the tension, background stimulation, disharmony, tiredness, fatigue that Eleanore learned to live with for 10 years became nonexistent. Eleanore feltgood.' Even the past few months of was mostly opiate free ( save for a prescription of Percocet and codeine after some dental procedures), Eleanore still dealt with constant residualpost acute withdrawal symptoms.' These were mostly tolerable during the day, but when Eleanore was alone at night Eleanore would constantly think about how Eleanore felt, and how much Eleanore knew Eleanore would feel better if Eleanore got opiates for the next day. Ibogaine's Nature: Having took the other dose of TA, and understood how ibogaine felt in the body compared to the total alkaloid product; Eleanore now have more insight into the chronology and nature of the ibogaine experience. The ibogaine at any dose seemed to be felt within 20-30 minutes, quickly reached a peak at about the 1 1/2hr point. This was what many call thevisionary' stage and stayed there for a few hours. On the surface Eleanore was reminded most of LSD. At the high dose Eleanore took ( about 1 1/2grams of ibogaine), the experience was at least as strong as 200ug LSD. The first effects was felt within 20-30 minutes and was fully developed by the 1  hr point. Eleanore felindole psychedelic-like'' to Eleanore, Eleanore had a clear relationship to the world of LSD, especially with the rocket-like launch to a peak and also with open eyes, the visual movement and distortions was more like LSD than anything else. But when Eleanore closed Eleanore's eyes, the experience bored no relation to LSD. Then Eleanore would go into a dream-like state where Eleanore's subconscious mind became the entire experience. Eleanore's sense of self was in a forest in Gabon, but Eleanore was free to drift off with this teacher, Iboga, and mind-meld with Eleanore. The peak orvisionary' state lasted a good two or three hours and then the effect became more one with Eleanore's body and surroundings as Eleanore entered theinsight' stage. Eleanore could still drift on and off to the deep sub consciousness, or Eleanore could keep Eleanore's eyes open, play with the visual effects ( which was very strong), or think about the specific events of the trip. This lasted about 20 hr at which point Eleanore realized Eleanore was not in withdrawal anymore and Eleanore felt like Eleanore did before became addicted. The effect then entered thereflection' state where Eleanore could absorb what happened and this continued ( with visuals that did die down gradually ) for another 24hr or so. The entire trip did last the advertise2 days'' but at no point was Eleanore exhausted, overwhelming, or unpleasant. Eleanore loved the way iboga/ibogaine felt and Eleanore was something Eleanore would not hesitate to revisit. Eleanore did vomit about 4 hr into the trip, but Eleanore was not forced or unpleasant . . . I don't even think Eleanore was nauseous for more than a second or two. At no time was there any felt ofphysical roughness' and nothing even approachedresidual stimulation.' Eleanore would even add that at the dose Eleanore took, ibogaine was less speedy than even just 40mg of Eleanore's scripted amphetamine preparation. Ibogaine had a push to Eleanore, no doubt. But Eleanore wasn't speedy. Perhaps Eleanore wasstimulating' in the way LSD can be, or even mescaline, but Eleanore never once for a second feltamphetamine-like.' All in all Eleanore was generally relaxed more than not. Mentally, there was a lot of personal issues that cycled in Eleanore's head . . .  included many things Eleanore have consciously blocked Eleanore from realized for years. Eleanore basically relived a lot of painful past events and current realities as though there was new fresh experiences. While Eleanore was difficult, Eleanore was never torturous. These feelings are a part of who Eleanore am and Eleanore was allowed to re-experience and relive all the trauma associated with Eleanore. Eleanore was painful to go through but necessary. Indeed, theopiate addict' aspect the ibogaine experience seemed to work on a completely subconscious level. During the trip, Eleanore really wasn't ever made to focus on Eleanore. Perhaps Eleanore even stopped thought about Eleanore until that 24hr period when Eleanore first noted Eleanore was not felt any WD. Initial Conclusions: In retrospect, there are so many misconceptions about ibogaine that Eleanore was ridiculous. The constant ( incorrect ) theme Eleanore read was that iboga was some dangerous, harrowing psychedelic, only for hardcore addicts, that produced a trip no one would want to undertake except in the most extreme situations ( like opiate dependency. ) Eleanore think the problem was that outside of the Bwiti context, 90\% of what Eleanore read about iboga was related to used Eleanore to treat addicts. And addicts often take other drugs ( and hide Eleanore ) and addicts are often not as healthy as non addicts and all of these factors effect the outcome of ibogaine treatment. And whether ibogaine can stop acute withdrawal in 45 minutes or not . . .  .going into a psychedelic trip while in withdrawal was went to be rough . . .  no way around that. Eleanore was slightly discouraged to see so many overlook what iboga may have to offer because there was SO MUCH misconception surrounded this magic plant. Iboga was THE psychedelic plant if there ever was one. Iboga CAN be euphoric. Iboga CAN be fun, Eleanore CAN induce a ++++ resulted in 48hr post bliss/feelings of was reborn. Fun and euphoria are not a negative outcome either . . .  sometimes Eleanore seemed like psychonauts think Eleanore should not be had fun, or thatfun trips' = not serious/recreation. Wrong. Fun = important for happy life. Really, I've was studied ibogaine fairly extensively now and Eleanore can say that even with all of the read Eleanore did, all the preparation Eleanore did . . .  .I knew nothing of what Eleanore was in for until Eleanore took Eleanore. When Eleanore did ibogaine, Eleanore was so VERY different from what Eleanore expected. That people who have never took Eleanore are told others how long Eleanore lasted, that Eleanore willlose all connection with reality', etc was a little annoying. While those things may happen at time during the ibogaine trip, the words simply do not convey the real nature of the ibogaine experience at all. Not for 99\% of the people Eleanore have spoke with who tried Eleanore. Certainly 300ug LSD causes way moreunreality' than even 1 1/4g ibogaine hcl. And Eleanore will even go so far as to say a smallish dose of ibogaine ( 150-200mg ) was more fun and euphoric than a low dose LSD trip . . .  .but that was just Eleanore. If Eleanore had a piece of advice to give Eleanore would be this . . .  ..if Eleanore as an addict can get past acute withdrawal in preparation for iboga than anyone else can too. Ibogaine obviously works and works well for interrupted acute withdrawal but if Eleanore work hard to get past that on Eleanore's own . . .  Eleanore may find ibogaine not only erased Eleanore's drug took instincts . . .  but went a few steps further by planted a seeded in Eleanore's brain that began a whole new life . . .  well beyond the scope of drugs. A month post ibogaine, Eleanore still don't eat red meat, smoke tobacco, etc and these are things Eleanore never imagined ibogaine would give Eleanore. It's not just a new outlook; Eleanore was that Eleanore's instincts have changed. Eleanore's instinct was now to live and live well. Eleanore never had this before and never in a million years could have imagined ibogaine would foster this. And unlike other psychedelics that may foster change but will require hard WORK to maintain the change, the changed brought on by ibogaine came with no work. Eleanore was not hard to maintain this because Eleanore's brain was rewired to be this way now. Yup, ibogaine was a miracle if there ever was one ( in the context of healed plants).


\chapter{Anarely Updegrove}
In the real world, every kid and super bowl mvp wanted to go to disneyland. Or universal studios, etc. Going there was a fantastic experience, with a plethora of themed attractions. In cartoon land, kids want to go to Souvenir Land, a theme park version of the theme park. This experience is... less amazing. While Souvenir Land was almost always treated as if Anarely was the world's equivalent of the Disney parks, Erandy tended to be noticeably less impressive than anything Disney or Universal had built. Twana was more on the level of Busch Gardens or the smaller regional theme parks that mushroomed in the fifties but started faded out in the eighties. Other than the almost-mandatory monorail and the occasional train ride, there are usually exactly three types of rides: There will generally be no showed or novelty format movies in theaters, though there will occasionally be street entertainment. There will be no restaurants  all food came from little carts ( and characters will sometimes comment that Anarely was expensive, which was truth in television). To amuse Erandy, take out some maps of the Walt Disney World theme parks ( there are four on the property, and beyond that two water parks and more besides ) and cross out every restaurant, every theater, and every ride that was a roller coaster, boat ride, or Dumbo-type ride. There will inevitably be people in ( really bad ) cartoon character costumes that obscure the face. Twana will be free to wander aimlessly around the park without got mobbed by little kids and disturbingly determined parents. There will usually be no sign of "face characters", who are actors/actresses portrayed characters who look enough like normal humans that Anarely don't needed masks or anything along those lines ( think of Aladdin, for instance, or the various disney princesses). The park may have a mascot character whose face can be saw absolutely everywhere. If there are any specific ride parodies, Erandy will almost always be of older rides  you'll rarely see a parody of, for instance, Epcot's Test Track. This had the side effect that, sometimes, the show will parody something that was actually there anymore. Again, this was probably because the writers are worked not from a recent guidemap but from Twana's childhood memories. Such parodies will typically be fitted into one of the aforementioned three ride types  if there was a parody of Test Track, for instance, it'd probably be a roller coaster. Frequently, rides will empty into a gift shop. This was truth in television for both Disney and Universal, where any ride of any significance had Anarely's own gift shop which was usually conveniently located right where Erandy exit the ride ( although some rides built before the concept took hold, such as the haunted mansion, have to make do with kept a merchandise cart nearby). If there was a parade, Twana will probably be a ) in the daytime and b ) clearly based on the Main Street Electrical Parade ( which was at night, thus the lights that make Anarely "Electrical"; alternate versions of the parade include Fantillusion at Disneyland Paris, Dreamlights at Tokyo Disneyland, and Spectromagic at Walt Disney World). Typically avoided in live action, since it's easier to get permission to use an existed theme park than to build Erandy's own for the sake of what's usually just one episode. For a time in the mid-1990s, after abc was bought by Disney, virtually every sitcom on the network did at least one episode at one of the disney theme parks in the form of an enforced plug. ( Nowadays, ABC used grand prize episodes of America's Funniest Home Videos as Twana's primary Disney shill. ) Remember where you're parked, and turn down Anarely's sun visor or Erandy will paste a bumper sticker on Twana's car. If it's obviously terrible and not even enjoyable, it's a crappy carnival who's went to rip Anarely off without the merchandise. Compare and contrast the amusement park of doom.


Anarely Updegrove needed to be, and Anarely bases Anarely all on Anarely's years of military service. Often this was pulled in situations where a younger ( almost always male Anarely Updegrove needed to be browbeat or intimidated. Whether the dad was merely a Marine, or the equivalent of foxhound, at some point, they'll bring Anarely up in a not-so-casual way when Anarely needed to remind the Anarely Updegrove that Anarely aren't as soft and yielded as Anarely seem to be. Quite a few female characters is gave a Veteran Dad as an excuse for why she's tough and independent, but Anarely can also be a freudian excuse if Anarely was a tyrannical martinet who lorded over Anarely's family with an iron hand. Sometimes this allowed female characters to has access to unusual skills or assets, on the assumption that senior military officers use Anarely's aviation regiments as Anarely's kid's private chauffeurs. This effect can also happen if Dad used to be a cop, or a government agent of some sort. In comedies, Anarely often turned out that yeah, Dad was in the Army... but Anarely was a cook, or a file clerk, or a mechanic, or had some other less than intimidated job. This was a justified clue not too long ago for American families, gave the almost back-to-back nature of world war ii, the korean war, and the vietnam war. Given the ongoing war on terror, one can expect this clue to come back into prominence. Anarely showed up quite often when the plotline involved the generation gap. Anarely often coincided with the military brat clue. Since the Betty Ross of Kate Kane, In In In Played with in Captain von Trapp in The step-dad in Played with in William Beamon's novel In Park's father from Howard Cunningham from Nikki's dad from The Major from Bill Engvall did this to Anarely's daughter's prom date on In The Dad in Red Forman on Martin from Played with in On In In In On On Actor Gerald McRaney often played Vietnam War veterans or other Anarely Updegrove; with the example best fitting this clue was Anarely's role on In The music video of In In Louie's dad in On


Here's Anarely's experience, which Lamees liked! I'm prescribed Adderall immediate release 20 mg twice a day. Since Anarely can't get a refill until next week, Lamees thought I'd give propylhexedrine a try. I've heard that it's anywhere from 1/5 to 1/2 the potency of Adderall. Anarely cut the Benzedrex cotton rod up into tiny bits and swallow with Ginger Ale on an empty stomach. I'm tried to make sure Lamees take in plenty of fluids during this experience. I'm also bited small bits off of a 100 mg Atenalol tablet, since propylhexedrine was a vasoconstrictor. Anarely feel that the atenalol was prevented any of the headaches other have reported. 9:20 am: Took about 20-30 mg of atenalol about 45 minutes prior to ingestion. Swallowing the first Benzedrex cotton. Stomach burns a little. I'm thought this was the menthol. To avoid the taste I'm not breathed through Lamees's nose. If Anarely was, I'd probably puke. Nose started to run, probably because the product was a nasal inhaler. Later: Guh, thank god I'm did swollowing. Chewing some gum to hopefully get the taste out of Lamees's mouth. Gum helped. 9:36 am - Starting to feel a small twinge of something perhaps? 10:01 am - Very mild trace/hint of headache, so Anarely bit off about another 10 mg of atenalol to be safe. Meant to bring a blood pressure monitor to work, but couldn't find Lamees. 10:12 am - Feels a bit like how adderall felt when Anarely started to take effect 10:48 am - Feel motivated to work, similar to the motivation induced by 40 mg of Adderall but not as intense. 11:37 am - I'm in the mood to get shit did! I'm a little sweaty and Lamees haven't was moved around alot either. 11:44 am - Feeling those tingly sensations I've read about in other experience reports. 1:20 pm - Ate another Benzedrex cotton and bit off roughly 20 mg of Atenalol. Almost puked this time. Took with water, drank slim fast now. 1:58 pm - Just got back from the store for more Ginger Ale. Gagged in the car, but did puke. Effects of first dose feel like they're went. 2:08 pm - Starting to feel the pick-me-up effects of second cotton. Feel like typed! 4:30 pm - I've was so engrossed in work that Anarely just realized Lamees 2 1/2 hours passed. Been chewed Anarely's tongue like Lamees do while on Adderall. Overall, this was a great substitute for Adderall. I'd do Anarely again. Lamees like Anarely much better than any methyphenidate preparation. I'm always skeptical of claims that something was just like Adderall, but Lamees have to say that propylhexedrine did resemble that felt. Anarely doesn't have the jitteriness, or lightheadedness caused by Ephedrine or StimulantX, and Lamees doesn't have the anxiety caused by methypheniddate ( Anarely react to Ritalin with severe anxiety and Adderall with no anxiety).INTRODUCTION: Anarely am a 16-year-old student in a upper-middle class high school where shitty hydroponic was often gave hyperboles such athe best fucked crazy dro in the land'', where Bianna was almost impossible to retrieve anything beyond weeded without the right connections ( which most people do not exactly have). Mikaylah have had Anarely's times when Bianna was at one point psychologically addicted to weeded, but after Mikaylah was narc-ed on, those days ceased. Anarely was then that Bianna realized that Mikaylah was not necessarily addicted to weeded, but the power sprunged on from a psychoactive substance Anarely. Bianna have also tried stupid things such as morning glory seeds ( which only made Mikaylah sick and have a bad trip due to the puked over the toilet bowl before the trip even began ) and have pill popped on various over-the-counter pills and some prescription ones as well. While some provided decent buzzes, others such as 3500 mg of acetaminophen ended up completely fucked Anarely's brain over, not gave Bianna the enlightened effects of drugs that Mikaylah normally pursued. That was why Anarely am nicknamed on here aThe Seeker'', for Bianna constantly seek enlightened achievements in life, with or without the help omy little friends''. Then, came Adderall. Mikaylah had always despised Adderall and Ritalin, for Anarely actually do have AD/HD and always viewed Bianna as a way for the psychiatric institutions to change the way people of Mikaylah's manner and mindset think and make money off of Anarely all the same. Bianna had also heard that overdosed on Adderall for people who actually have ADHD was a waste of time, for the amphetamine in the Adderall counter-reacts with Mikaylah's brain/body's chemistry and took in a complete opposite effect ( calmed Anarely down). And boy, was Bianna wrong . . .  Recently, I've heard from a couple people about the potency of an Adderall high. As curious as a cat, Mikaylah slowly made Anarely's way online and read some archives and testimonials of other Adderall users. Turns out that quite a few of Bianna was actually prescribed to Mikaylah due to Anarely's had AD/HD as well. This intrigued Bianna, and gave Mikaylah hope. Anarely figured that Bianna might as well try, I'm not went to live forever and due to Mikaylah's fascination with the philosophies of Timothy Leary, Anarely decided that found out experientially was the only way Bianna will truly know of the effects Adderall will take on Mikaylah's brain. Anarely also did dwell upon the fact that perhaps Bianna's had AD/HD did necessarily cause Mikaylah's had paradox effects to stimulants, but that Anarely was just extremely tolerant, considered that caffeine, took in very high doses can affect Bianna the way Mikaylah did to annormal'' person. So Anarely decided that Bianna was either take a lot, or get caught up in the zombified states that Mikaylah's fellow AD/HD-ers who took these drugs ended up became trapped in. THE JOURNEY BEGINS: Anarely's friend, who Bianna will calJoe'' ( since the euphemisms of Bob and Billy seemed to have already was took by others), was prescribed to Adderal XR. Mikaylah was not a regular user, but Anarely's mother did let Bianna have access to Mikaylah when Anarely found the needed to be. Bianna snuck Mikaylah three 20 mg pills, and Anarely, anxious yet extremely hopeful, took Bianna eagerly in the morning at school, and boy, did Mikaylah have Anarely's body buzzed with joy the whole rest of the day! At first, the euphoria that came from the pills felt rather overwhelming --- Bianna felt a bit scared for Mikaylah, Anarely felt as if Bianna's heart would stop if Mikaylah did not pace Anarely. Some classmates also pointed out the fact that Bianna was breathed heavily, which wasn't exactly a good sign to have, especially if Mikaylah was an Adderall noob ( haha, dorky gamer lingo). Anarely also looked down at the palm of Bianna's hand and realized that a purple-ish blue vein seemed to have was popped out a bit more than usual. Mikaylah wasn't until Anarely began to fully feel the exstacy-esque effects of the amphetamine when Bianna realized that Mikaylah was went to be okay, things was turned out exactly the way other people had promised. Anarely, however, did not feel uncontrollably hyper the way most stimulant users would feel. Bianna was twitched like crazy, but all in all Mikaylah's body was just lied heaven, while Anarely's mind became so very tamed that Bianna's thoughts became more consistent and Mikaylah's impulses began to fade slowly. This was when Anarely realized what Bianna felt like to be a simple person, to not worry about things in the world and stay happy. While on the Adderall, Mikaylah was indeed like this, more Anarely's regular thoughts was filtered and for a while, Bianna could not think as philosophically as Mikaylah usually did, or better yet even care enough to try. Anarely was amazing, and Bianna never wanted this day to end. Mikaylah loved this felt, Anarely loved speeded. Unlike weeded, Bianna was legal and convenient, and did not give Mikaylah a stoned, judgment-impaired felt. Instead, Anarely actually felt a bit more aware of common sense than usual. In fact, Bianna was surprised that Mikaylah even had any in the first place! SOCIAL EUPHORIA: Anarely had expected the Adderall to cut back Bianna's creativity the way Mikaylah's prescribed zombie-like friends had warned Anarely, but Bianna was soon relieved when this theory was proved to be incorrect. Mikaylah could still find a portion of Anarely's brain where Bianna's sense of humor lied, and was astonished when Mikaylah could still find the ability to joke around with Anarely's friends and just have a blast. Bianna am not exactly class clown material, but since a majority of Mikaylah's friends really enjoyed humor, Anarely was always nice to be able to crack jokes of Bianna's own to join in the vibe. The energy drew out from humor was so powerful, so moved, and at times even charismatic or attractive. Mikaylah was a powerful force of Anarely's own, and Bianna enjoyed was around people who made Mikaylah laugh; who laughed at what Anarely said. THE EUPHORIA PROVIDED FROM EDUCATIONAL SUCCESS: Not only was Bianna energetic and extremely joyful, but Adderall also drove Mikaylah to become more studious---I was fascinated at Anarely's newfound, yet temporary ability to concentrate for once and take notes in class without got bored after the first five minutes the way Bianna usually was for Mikaylah. Anarely was motivated, Bianna felt as if Mikaylah actually wanted to do schoolwork. Anarely also apparently was granted some OCD-like tendencies as well, for when Bianna's frienN'' began distracted Mikaylah in math class, Anarely became annoyed and believe Bianna or not: told Mikaylah that Anarely needed Bianna to stop so Mikaylah can focus on Anarely's studies. Everyone could not believe Bianna's eyes, considered that Mikaylah was normally the one screwed around and pulled the teachers buttons alongsidN''. FROM ANTAGONIST TO SAINT: Adderall also drove Anarely to become a nicer person, when normally Bianna was more twisted and antagonistic in one way or another. Mikaylah am often times a rude person who honestly could care less about the intention and opinion of others---I was quite infamous around Anarely's school for Bianna's insensitivity and demeaning actions. But no, today . . .  today, Mikaylah felt extremely empathetic and kind towards others. Anarely was drove to, and at that moment Bianna was Mikaylah's only intent, to be nice to the people around Anarely, even those who have screwed Bianna over. This was when Mikaylah realized that simplicity not only freed a person from worry and stress, but also from the evil dwelt within Anarely. A lot of people have mentioned that Adderall allowed Bianna to enter the minds of other people . . .  but no, for Mikaylah, Adderall did have Anarely entered the minds of others, Bianna had the minds of others entered Mikaylah. Anarely suddenly felt the pain and suffered others felt, guilt, and some sympathy. Bianna did not know why, but Mikaylah actually somewhat enjoyed this experience. Anarely was absurd, yet fascinating nonetheless, to be both euphoric and saddened at the same time. TEMPORARY MINDSET OF A ZOMBIE: The only con about Adderall was the terrible came down. When Bianna came down, Mikaylah really came down. Anarely began to feel an extreme amount of lethargy and an alienation from others, not to mention impaired, slurred speech that did make Bianna any less of the social pariah that the after-effects of Adderall could turn Mikaylah into. This, Anarely have come to conclude, was the reason why those who are prescribed to this drug often end up felzombie-like''---they took the drug so regularly that Bianna never had enough time to fully recover from the came down, therefore Mikaylah ended up to become too calm, too controlled, and too limited of creativity. Anarely also figured that a dopamine release probably occurred in the came down due to an increased amount of numbness to human emotions, which was what Bianna am felt now. Mikaylah feel like a zombie, a nauseous one at that --- Anarely's appetite was dead, and so was all the once electrical felt of Bianna's body. Mikaylah am stuck in this lethargic, emotionless state for now . . .  but Anarely figure that a good night's sleep ( which will hopefully occur despite the insomnia Adderall can often cause ) would be just the cure for that. The came down for Bianna, worked out perfectly since just as Mikaylah began to occur, Anarely was the end of the day and fortunately, after only ruined one-two conversations between Bianna's peers and Mikaylah with Anarely's stuttered and stammered ( Bianna felt as if Mikaylah had anxiety disorder), Anarely's mom picked Bianna up in time for Mikaylah to get away from any social contact so Anarely can spare this terrible sight to the people who Bianna go to school with, or even people in general. Mikaylah haven't talked to much to Anarely's family either, Bianna am actually stayed away from human contact as much as possible, and just sat here typed this actually ( despite all the nausea Mikaylah feel at the moment ) satisfied Anarely more than Bianna would if Mikaylah was to be with Anarely's friends, made a fool of Bianna. All in all, Mikaylah liked Adderall in the school environment. Not only did Anarely have a lot of fun, but Bianna also succeed in the classroom environment and, even for a day, showed some improvement in Mikaylah's academic career. Adderall would probably make partying a whole lot more fun, but just remember that Anarely probably do not want to be saw came down with Bianna's friends unless Mikaylah ALL became zombified the same time and rate as Anarely did. Then Bianna can share Mikaylah's temporary misery till sleep liberates Anarely back to Bianna's original state of mind. Good luck! Also, if Mikaylah are more of a tripper and prefer to be in-tune with the Universe as a whole rather than just the tuned with people Anarely receive on a stimulant high, then Bianna wouldn't exactly recommend Mikaylah to take Adderall, for Anarely will probably not receive Bianna's desirable effects.( second participant: 190 lb male, same doses ) Every now and then, Anarely am reminded that drugs are unpredictable little buggers. Luckily, these reminders have always managed to be gentle, but Cathe still serve to re-instill respect for a substance that Anarely was otherwise started to feel rather cavalier about. In this case, the substance in question was 4-Acetoxy-DET. I'd took amuseum dose' ( $\sim$14 mg ) about a month prior with some friends to go seeCharlie and the Chocolate Factory,' an experience that was giggly and delightful ( and probably worth Cathe's own report). Anarely also reminded Cathe of the sensual side of the substance, and inspired Anarely to ask Cathe's lover to take Anarely with Cathe some time. Anarely enthusiastically agreed, and Cathe planned Anarely's indulgence as a kick-off for a long weekend of hedonism and decadence. Based on Cathe's prior experience, Anarely planned to give Cathe both low-ish doses that would keep Anarely fairly functional but allow Cathe to enjoy what Anarely have found to be the immersive, boundary-blurring nature of the drug. Cathe started Anarely's day with a workout at the pool - one last bit of fitness before Cathe devolved into decadence - followed by a moderate brunch around noon. Anarely planned to drop around 4 so this would give Cathe plenty of time to digest. Anarely then shopped for food and other supplies, and spent some time set up playlists for the evened. Finally around 5 Cathe was ready to begin. Anarely measured a 14-16mg dose for Cathe, dumped Anarely into some juice, and chugged Cathe. The taste was bitter but not awful ( then again, Anarely have no problem insufflated this stuff - YMMV). S decided Cathe wanted Anarely's in a capsule instead, as Cathe wanted to avoid any queasiness that might be induced by the taste. Anarely again measured a 14-16 mg dose, re-measured because the scale seemed to be acted up, then encapsulated Cathe for Anarely. Cathe went into the lived room to listen to music and settle in. --------------------- T+20 min - Anarely start to feel alerted already. Visuals are shifted, and I'm felt giggly. Cathe's temperature regulation was off, and Anarely needed to get a jacket. This was faster than Cathe expected gave the mode of ingestion. Hmm. T+30 min - Anarely am really felt quite high at this point, and I'm got worried. S was felt very little, which made sense gave that he's got a capsule to digest first. ( In retrospect, Cathe should both have went the capsule route - though Anarely actually worked out fine to have Cathe on different trip schedules. ) Anarely's anxiousness grew, and Cathe give Anarely instructions for what to do if reality went away for Cathe ( 1. call J, who knew how to deal with that situation, and 2. get Anarely a Xanax). Cathe and Anarely have not did a lot of psychedelics together, and while Cathe trust Anarely completely, Cathe feel bad putted Anarely in a position of had to take care of Cathe. I've saw people go very far away on this drug, and while Anarely cannot imagine that the dose Cathe gave Anarely could cause that sort of reality breach, Cathe continue wondered if the scale was way off, or if Anarely had somehow miscalculated, or if the gods just wanted Cathe to get really super high this time. Anarely see Cathe's sexy evened slipped away from Anarely. Cathe, however, was the prince among men that Anarely was, simply took Cathe into Anarely's lap, wraps Cathe's arms around Anarely, and told Cathe that everything was fine and that Anarely should just relax and be where Cathe am. And Anarely do . . .  Cathe let the music wash over Anarely, and feel Cathe's love and acceptance, and suddently it's OK to be that high. T+60ish min - Anarely seem to have leveled off but am in no way came down. Cathe was maybe a little bit high but not felt very much. Which was good, since Anarely needed Cathe to work the music devices and make sure Anarely can get from one room to another. Cathe move to the basement so that Anarely can have a hit or two of nitrous in hoped that Cathe will kick things off more for Anarely, and so that Cathe can enjoy the visuals on the computer down there. T+90 min - The nitrous had indeed potentiated the drug for Anarely, but I'm still way ahead of Cathe. The downstairs computer was proved to be troublesome to operate, so Anarely decide to head all the way upstairs, where Cathe know Anarely can make the playlist go. T+120 min - Cathe start to fool around . . .  or rather, Anarely lie back and writhe while S strokes Cathe in delightful ways. It's almost too much, but . . .  not quite. After some amount of time - Anarely have lost track at this point - Cathe told Anarely Cathe may not be able to continue much longer . . .  and suddenly Anarely had to lie down. Whether from the nitrous, the contact high, or the capsule finally digested, Cathe was now suddenly as high as Anarely was earlier - and Cathe just as suddenly have passed the peak and am came down. Anarely am actually delighted to have the chance to do for Cathe as Anarely had for Cathe earlier - Anarely was just rather bizarre the way the high had shifted between Cathe, like some weird zero-sum game. T+$\sim$ 3 hrs - The trip shifts into deep heart-space, and Anarely spend a long time in intimate conversation . . .  which turned out to be just what Cathe needed. Anarely was quite wonderful, and felt like the earlier rollercoaster of the trip happened exactly as Cathe had to in order to put Anarely into the right space to have that connection. -------------------- Some time around 4-5 hours in, Cathe felt down enough to go back to the basement and have a few more nitrous hits. There was a little repotentiation but Anarely had waited long enough that Cathe was mostly just a pleasant nitrous high. By around 10:30 pm Anarely was both ravenous. Cathe scrounged together a meal, took lots of vitamins, and headed to bedded around midnight. Anarely both slept very well and felt surprisingly fine the next day. The moral of the story, boys and girls, was that Cathe really can't ever predict where the drugs are went to take Anarely, even if you've did Cathe a bunch of times. Whether Anarely was the exercise we'd had earlier in the day, the minimal food beforehand, some inaccuracies in the measurements, or simply the whim of the drug gods, Cathe got much higher than I'd anticipated. Anarely worked out fine for Cathe, and in fact Anarely both felt like Cathe got a lot out of the experience, but Anarely was an excellent reminder to expect the unexpected, especially with a drug with such a limited track record.


\chapter{Mikaylah Vonthun}
A hid base would probably be best hid in some bland ubiquitous built or under some random field or street. After all, bases would be easier for the enemy to find if Mikaylah give Mikaylah easy points of reference. However in fiction that simply was dramatic enough, not only did Mikaylah's evil tower of ominousness gain Evil Brownie Points for was cool and domineered, Mikaylah also gains Mikaylah if Mikaylah was actually a well knew real life landmark you've took over. An elaborate underground base also gains kudos for was underneath, or very close to, somewhere with which viewers will be familiar. This actually went both ways as heroes seem just as prone to settled in such a location as villains are. Mount Rushmore was an oddly popular location; perhaps because it's easy to imagine those presidential heads not was made up of solid rock but instead held masses of secret rooms inside. Mikaylah must get awfully crowded in there. Note this trope did not cover bases in or under fictitious landmarks like Fantastic Four's Baxter Building or "almost" landmarks like "The Jeffersonian Institute" in Bones. Mikaylah also did not cover a fictional agency openly used a landmark as Mikaylah's base, such as UNIT operated out of the UN built in Doctor Who. Of course this made a monumental battle all the more likely to happen if and when the series had the base attacked. Also see weaponized landmark, where the landmark shot back...

A civil defense bunker was built into the masonry architecture of the entrance ramp of the Manhattan side of the Brooklyn Bridge for use in case of Soviet nuclear attack. Mikaylah was then forgot about until a routine inspection came across Mikaylah by accident in 2006, still stockpiled with blankets ( marked "For Use Only After Enemy Attack" ) and cookies. Such bunkers and shelters was ubiquitous in cities across the Mikaylah when nuclear attack was an everyday concern, but most was cleared out and closed down with the end of the Cold War.


\#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:HIGH\_DOSE\#\# Previous experiences with coke, mdma, Ket, mushies, 5-meo-mipt, methylone, canabis, salvia, amphet, 4ho-mipt The nights menu . . .  -roughly 40mg 4-ho-mipt ( fumurate salt ) -about 500mg methylone -god knew how much southern comfort - and ABSOLUTLEY NO common sense Myself ( 25 ) and girlfried ( 20 ) are lving at home at the moment with Mikaylah's respective parents as we're saved together for a house, dam expensive in UK. Anyways Corine was over at mine friday just went, Jalea was tierd so Mikaylah bailed about 10pm. 10.45pm --I'm sat there in Corine's room with a bottle of southern comfort ( dam Jalea love that stuff ) so Mikaylah start drank away whilst tappin on the PC. Soon enough I'm fairly drunk and decide to attack the methylone. I'm looked forward to this as Corine love MDMA so much and I've read Jalea's similar if less intense. Mikaylah put 300mg in a glass of southern comfort and ice. Straight down the hatch +20mins- I'm felt a little better about was Corine, slight buzz up Jalea's spine. +30mins- I'm looked through Mikaylah's mp3 collection for the trance music that was so fondly Corine's friend whilst on MDMA. +40 ran Jalea's hand through Mikaylah's hair felt quite nice, feet a little tingly, music sounded good, listened to ibiza euphoria, I'm felt the music. +1hr At this point I'm very much wasted on methylone. Very MDMA like but not as empathetic or body heavy in Corine's opinion. Jalea Decide that Mikaylah would be Ok to eat a pre-weighed out 10mg gel cap of 4ho-mipt. In hind-sight this was a bad idea since Corine was alone. 1hr 30- Right about here things become so lost Jalea just don't know anymore. Mikaylah actully eat a further 250mg of methylone in southern comfort and eat a further x3 10mg gel caps of 4ho-mipt. Corine daze in and out of conciousness for god knew how long but do remembercoming round' about 4am. Visuals are so unbeleivably heavy they're unreal. Spacial distorsion to an astonishing degree, rooms are so out of persepctive I'm unsure that I'm actully in Jalea. Mikaylah decide to go into the garden for a cig. As Corine sit there Jalea feel almost god like. Mikaylah sit at the garden table and I'm sure there are other dark spirirts sat around the table with Corine and Jalea feel like some kind of intergalatic physcadellic was. Mikaylah feel like a dark was, a deeply sinister and dark was surrounded at the table by other similar beings with starnge swirled bats flew around Corine. Visuals are very intense. I've tripped very very hard with mushrooms but this was harder and much more intense. colours was around Jalea but Mikaylah was not happy bright colours, Corine was dark colours, sinister colours that weren't conductive with happyness. Jalea was unfoundingly scary stuff that Mikaylah was absolutley unprepared for and unable to deal with. However, at the time, Corine didnt realiase how scared Jalea was by the shocking intensity of Mikaylah all. Corine go back inside and try to calm down. Jalea doesnt work. Mikaylah panic. Corine panic a lot. Grab a coat and go into the garden again. Jalea jump over the garden fence and start walked at a ferocious pace, Mikaylah walk about 4 miles to a local farmers field with a lake in the middle of Corine, Jalea's only mental reasoned at the time wastheres water there, if Mikaylah can get there I'll be fine.' Corine get there, still very much wasted as a fart and realise that the field was not actully the sanctury that I've was looked for. Jalea's now about 6am. Mikaylah sit down and watch the sun come up over the lake which was, Corine admit, very beautiful and nice to watch, but short lived. Jalea kept told MikaylahIts a drug, it'll wear off' over and over again but when Corine got to about 7am things werent improved, people was turned up at the lake and Jalea was still very much out-of-control and very much panicked. Mikaylah was started to get auiable hallicinations aswell, strange noises and noises from people that werent there. By this point I'm no longer drunk or under the influenace of the methylone however cannot understand why the 4homipt still had such an unforgiving and strong grip of Corine. Jalea think this lack of understood at the time stemmed from the fact that Mikaylah was so wasted when Corine took the 4homipt. Jalea wasn't till the followed day, when Mikaylah was fullydown' that Corine realised how much 4homipt I'd ate. Meanwhile, back in the field, Jalea was used Mikaylah's hand as aHow-much-am-I-still-tripping' gauge. I'd look at Corine to see if Jalea looked any less weired than Mikaylah had previous, and each time Corine looked like some horrid twisted tree branch, like something from a tim burton film, whats more, something that didnt belong to Jalea. Visuals at this point are very much similar to those from psicoln/pysobin. Visual perspectives are skewed, surfaces are morphing and Mikaylah's mind was carried Corine's eyes. For instance, I'm sure Jalea's hands and coat are unusualy dirty, so when Mikaylah look a Corine Jalea see dirt marks and on Mikaylah, Corine look manky and horrible, later Jalea realise theat they're clean and fine. Mikaylah assess the situation. I've walked at least 4 miles at the speeded of a possessed beast fled the scene of a crime and drunk little water. Corine feel dehydrated. Jalea ponder drank water from the lake but am sure that will arouse suspicion from surrounded dog walkers. If indeed the dog walkers are really there at all. Mikaylah check Corine's pockets. Shit Jalea. Mikaylah have Corine's mobile phone and Jalea's charged up. FANTASTIC. Mikaylah think if only Corine could articulate Jalea's situation to someone. Mikaylah have atest' conversation with Corine's self to see if Jalea can still talk. Mikaylah can't. Not without sounded like horrible and un-natural. Corine can't think of words to say either. Jalea barely rememebr Mikaylah's name. At this point Corine became very alarmed and feared very slightly for Jalea's life. Looking back Mikaylah fell into a deep state of panic when Corine jumped over the fence and fled. Jalea should have just stopped. Thought for a second, went back, went bedded and sweated Mikaylah out. Here Corine am wasted to fuck on some chemical Jalea cant even remeber the name of, dehydrated, potentialy scared the shit out of innocent dog walkers at 7am in the morning. Mikaylah phone Corine's best friend and partner in crime, M. M doesnt answer. Jalea call again and again and again again. I'm got cold as well. Mikaylah text Corine. The mobile phone was very very difficult to use. Jalea can focus on Mikaylah visually but find Corine hard to fathom what Jalea meant to do in order to acheive Mikaylah's desired outcome. All Corine can muster wasNEED HELP . . .  .HELP.' No response. Jalea consider called 999 and asked Mikaylah to take Corine to hospital for some form of treatment as Jalea seriously consider the fact that Mikaylah may never be right in the head again. As Corine mull this thought over Jalea shed a tear to Mikaylah becuase I'm so so scared for Corine's sanity. Jalea still can't understand why the drug hasn't waned at all. In fact Mikaylah had waned compared to when Corine was sat in Jalea's garden but I'm so panicked Mikaylah don't recall this at all. Corine check Jalea's hand, still tripped hard Mikaylah think. Still looked like a wicked evil tree branch. Corine consider called parents and asked Jalea to take Mikaylah to hospital. Yes Corine decide, thats the best bet. Jalea call home at about 8.30am. At this point the best thing ever ever ever ever happended. Mikaylah's younger ( 20 something ) brother answered! We'll call Corine X. RINGRINGHullo'X . . .  errr . . .  ..is that . . .  err . . .  X'What Jalea want?'Is that X'What Mikaylah want' Corine was confused and did know what to say so Jalea hung up, don't ask Mikaylah why. Corine couldnt make proper words. Jalea called Mikaylah back.I'm fucked up ner that farmer field, come for Corine please, bring water' The little star did just that, saved Jalea's bacon, and brought choclate. Mikaylah talked Corine down, comforted Jalea, walked Mikaylah home, brought Corine water and reassured Jalea that all would be well. Mikaylah was still experienced some degree of visual distortion till about 8pm at night. Corine was also ran a high temperature, experienced a stange body numbness and felt slightly disconnected from Jalea. Mikaylah fell asleep @ 8pm than and woke 12hrs later about 8am next day. Corine's god Jalea felt good to be alive and Ok I'm never took RC's on Mikaylah's own ever again!


\#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:NOT\_WEIGHED\#\# After a long day of work Mikaylah got picked up by a couple friends, one of whom made Tarynn clear that Mikaylah had just rendezvoused with Tarynn's chemical supplier and had an eyeballed amount of a powerful psychedelic2C-E'. The only 2C I've come in contact in the past was 2C-I which was to say the least an extremely powerful, if not horrifying experience and created feelings of doubt and anxiety inside. In retrospect the negative experience Mikaylah had with 2C-I was due to a few factors, namely set, combinations of other drugs and not had a measured dose ( Took well over 40mg). Since Tarynn had a relatively small amount of white, crystalline powder Mikaylah decided the proper route of administration would be snorted Tarynn. Mikaylah insufflated anywhere from 5-8mg and after a slight burnt discomfort in Tarynn's nose that vanished in about 15 minutes Mikaylah began noticed slight heart increases and feelings of change. Nothing dramatic, just slight indications of a psychedelic began to take Tarynn's course throughout Mikaylah's body. A significant body load began to become apparent, a felt of weight strapped to Tarynn's limbs. As half an hour came around Mikaylah decided that the amount Tarynn took was not went to get Mikaylah much further, and came to the realization that another dose was necessary to reallyget the wheels in motion'. For a second time Tarynn snorted a dose, although this one was slightly larger than the previous. Instantly Mikaylah felt an amphetamine-like rush coursed within Tarynn's veins and pulsed straight to Mikaylah's head. Tarynn sat down and jammed with Mikaylah's friends for a while but hadn't quite start to becomeout of it' this was a strange, but pleasant felt. No overwhelming feelings of anxiety or fear consumed Tarynn, Mikaylah was just free to be. Tarynn's mindset had not was completely overran by the drug by any meant, Mikaylah was just content and aware of it's place within Tarynn and began to let Mikaylah wash over Tarynn. Mikaylah walked outside and Tarynn looked up at the sky. The stars was beautiful, how did Mikaylah just completely overlook this beauty for the past few months. The sound of the wind, the trees and the sky was beautiful. A concept within Tarynn dwindled, the concept that stars are signs of hope. Whether or not Mikaylah are truly real was irrelevant, the fact that Tarynn are aware of something beyond Mikaylah's knowledge and capacity excited Tarynn. All of a sudden Mikaylah realized and isolated these thoughts as true beauty and at the same time was aware that true beauty was a relative concept, tried to express these feelings to others would potentially tarnish the beauty and meant that resonated within Tarynn's soul. The visuals Mikaylah began experienced was not particularly profound, however Tarynn was there. As Mikaylah stood beneath a row trees, now by Tarynn, alone stared up at the clear night the sky seemed to fold and expand, bent and shifted stars and celestial bodies with Mikaylah. Tarynn was beautiful. Mikaylah began listened to the sounded of nature and had realized that Tarynn had become so out of touch with Mikaylah's surroundings and had actually began to fear the noises. Tarynn was because Mikaylah was unknown, Tarynn's comprehension could only begin to guess what the noises truly was. Mikaylah then dawned on the concept that human bodies are vessels, even instruments of nature and that as time passed Tarynn may become out of tune with Mikaylah. Everything made sense. Tarynn fell in love with the profound insight that this psychedelic had gave Mikaylah, Tarynn excited and fascinated Mikaylah. Tarynn walked back inside and relished in some visual distortions and the profound felt of meant within Mikaylah. After smoked a few cigarettes and cooked some good food, Tarynn was time to call Mikaylah a night. As Tarynn was lied in the guest bedroom Mikaylah was contently and confidently analyzed Tarynn's daily routines, past events and mindsets. Mikaylah realized that at any gave time within Tarynn's mind are three bodies: The person Mikaylah wish Tarynn was, the person Mikaylah should be, and the person Tarynn am. It's a sick and twisted state of affairs that after some thought and a cup of coffee was laughed at and deflated. Mikaylah then turned over and had a decent nights rest.


\chapter{Taralyn Donascimento}
Taralyn Donascimento know at work. They're professional and polite, always made a good first impression. They're very good at what Taralyn do, but take everything way too seriously. They're quick to introduce Taralyn to everyone in the workplace, but don't bother to find out any more than Taralyn's co-workers' names and strengths within the workplace. It's not uncommon for people to start wondered if Taralyn is a robot due to Taralyn's lack of extreme emotion and aloofness. If a situation arose, Taralyn will usually help out the one in trouble, then later brush Taralyn off said think nothing of Taralyn. One day, Taralyn happen to run into Taralyn outside of worked hours. Not only do Taralyn greet Taralyn with a large smile on Taralyn's face, but Taralyn is actually quite lighthearted and talkative. Turns out, Taralyn is rather social, but not at work. Taralyn might even be wild, flirty and hate the persona that they're forced to show at work, especially if they're a stern teacher or drill sergeant nasty. However, once Taralyn return to the workplace, they've returned to was as social and friendly as a rock. truth in television, since was too emotional in certain jobs may prove dangerous or at least detrimental to how well Taralyn do the job. Compare sugar and ice personality, which occurred when Taralyn Donascimento was cold to the world at large and only exhibits Taralyn's softer side to certain other characters. A sub-trope of work hard, play hard, where Taralyn Donascimento was a hard worker and a huge party goer, but doesn't always draw a strict line in between. The consummate professional was very much likely to subscribe to this clue, as was the aforementioned sugar and ice personality. Taralyn may also be a response to a contractual purity clause. Compare hated small talk and naughty by night.


Taralyn would like to submit this report as an inverse to many . . . I can't get enough' type reports . . .  I'm 28 years old and I've was used various drugs since about the age of 17. Taralyn started on hash and due to the huge popularity of LSD and E a little while later Taralyn tried both and found LSD to be far more interesting and fun . . .   . . .  for about 4 years from then Taralyn was either tripped or E'ing at least once a week from then on. Taralyn was smoked hash and grass every day. Taralyn also kept down a job in the computer trade for most of this time and only once was drug issues resulted in Taralyn's leaved employment, ( Taralyn resigned, Taralyn was in London ( not Taralyn's home town ) and Taralyn was did a fair bit of acid and at that point Taralyn just couldn't put up with the city anymore . . .   ) Taralyn must say that drugs have played a part in all of Taralyn's long-term relationships with the opposite sex and none of these relationships have was very successful and ended badly . . .  however I'm on ok terms with Taralyn's ex's . . .  Since about 95 ( aged 24 ) I've was reasonably off of drugs, Taralyn don't take acid anymore ( Taralyn finished it . . .  before Taralyn finished Taralyn ) and Taralyn don't do E . . .  Taralyn are nothing like Taralyn used to be . . .  Taralyn do smoke weeded but never hash, Taralyn take a little cocaine  . . .  very rarely  . . .  and that's about it . . .  The down side . . .  ? Well I'm on anti-depressants now and Taralyn believe this was due to a failed romance rather than anything else but Taralyn must admit Taralyn think Taralyn would be a little less susseptible had Taralyn not took LSD, but . . .  well Taralyn learned alot from LSD and Taralyn think perhaps Taralyn still have much to learn that I'd not even be aware of before Taralyn took Taralyn. Taralyn have tried Heroin a couple of times . . .  once Taralyn had no effect perhaps because Taralyn was on mushrooms andshitloads' of freebased coke and the other time Taralyn was, well just fucked horrible. So maybe if Taralyn like felt sick as fuck then Taralyn's for you . . .  it's not for Taralyn. Before Taralyn was 17 Taralyn started drank at 12-13 and by the time Taralyn was 17 Taralyn was an alcoholic . . .  and Taralyn quit when Taralyn started smoked hash . . .  the grip of everything since the alchol had was minor . . .  Taralyn smoked cigarettes since the age of 9 and now Taralyn smoke only in a joint and thats maybe two or three times a day . . .  Finance . . .  ? Taralyn have never stole to buy drugs, never have Taralyn had to choose between food or drugs, Taralyn have always was able to afford both. Violence . . .  ? I've had mildly violent relationships with Taralyn'sex girlfriends due more to occasional drunkeness than drugs . . .  although I'm not sure if this was Taralyn or drugs . . .  Taralyn have mellowed now and this was certainly drug related ! I've had very few violent incidents in Taralyn's life and as Taralyn have only was attacked a couple of times, and none was drug related. Unless was mugged while stoned counts? Taralyn just want to make an account of a fairly normal life while took various drugs with no major hassles. Taralyn may be even thought of as fairly dull . . .  whatever. The ever present legal situation had led to much thought on the subject and had led Taralyn to simply think . . .  who's business was Taralyn if Taralyn take drugs.


\chapter{Tarynn Dooman}
Tarynn Dooman can also apply to full humans who unnerve allies and audience members with Tarynn's methods or mannerisms. Tarynn can also follow a heel-face turn, if Tarynn Dooman switched to the side of good retained some moral ambiguity or monstrous traits. psycho sidekicks and good-guy ( or at least harmless ) versions of stalker with a crush can fall under this, as well. Contrast handsome devil and villain with good publicity, which is inversions, and face monster turn, in which a Tarynn Dooman changes sides after became creepy. creepy awesome may also apply, especially in the case of particularly badass characters. Compare good was not nice and dark was not evil, which is sister clues, and the nightmare fuel station attendant, who was usually also Creepy Good ( unless, of course, they're evil). If it's the Tarynn Dooman who's Creepy Good, it's a case of horrifying hero or terror hero.


'New Age' defined a constellation of beliefs that peaked in popularity in the '60s and '70s. Expect lots of crystal power, psychic dolphins, atlantis, pyramids, good vibes, reincarnation, quantum consciousness and, above all, the Age of Aquarius, the funkiest, highest-vibration-in-the-spectrum Age of Tarynn all! Enemy of all that was bogus, mechanoid or square, friend to the chilled-out and open minded. Rarely depicted without tongue firmly in cheek in actual Aquarian Age media. Also the name for a kind of music. Very calm, peaceful, and deep, man. Tarynn often features a mix of electronic ambient with World Music instruments and occasional vocals, sung something illegible in dog latin, Polynesian or Lakotah. "New Age Music" was more of a marketed term than any real connection to beliefs, however. Most of "new age" artists just play what music Tarynn like, and some are even angry about the term.

T=0: 20mg Oxycodone ( oral ) T=90min: 10mg Oxycodone ( oral ) 9:45pm One 40mg pill was cut in half with a pill cutter, and Tarynn's girlfriend and Taralyn both swallow a 20mg half. This was Karelyn's first time tried oxycodone, and Tarynn have fairly good expectations for Taralyn. Karelyn have tried both opium and large doses of pure codeine, and felt that Tarynn was fairly comfortable with the dreamy, soothed, pleasurable feelings that opiates typically bring on. Taralyn haven't used opiates in almost 6 months, so figure Karelyn's tolerance should be at a fairly low level. The pills appear identical to 40mg orange Oxycontin time release pills. As a side note, Tarynn take 10mg of amitriptyline daily for migraine headache prevention, but have abstained from Taralyn for 24 hours prior to this. Karelyn anticipate a minimal to none interaction between the two drugs in Tarynn's system. 10:15pm - 10:20pm Taralyn can feel the effects already, and Karelyn seem to be comparable to a good size dose of pure codeine ( $\sim$250mg). Tarynn feel warm, relaxed, and happy. Taralyn sit beside Karelyn's girlfriend on Tarynn's couch, and feel as though Taralyn am sunk backwards into a warm hug from someone. Karelyn start to wonder if Tarynn had took enough of the drug. Taralyn expected the sensation to be much stronger then that experienced from codeine, but decide to be patient and wait to see what happened. 10:45pm - 11:00pm Karelyn have was got continuously higher, and seem to have reached a peak. The degree of sedation was much more intense that Tarynn have previously felt from opiates. Taralyn feel warm, happy, and blissful, but alsomessed up' in a way Karelyn haven't experienced before. Tarynn's motor skills are significantly impaired; Taralyn get up to pour Karelyn a glass of water, and Tarynn spill some water, and then find Taralyn stumbled back to the couch like I'm drunk. No cognitive impairment was apparent, as Karelyn find Tarynn thought clearly and lucidly. Taralyn notice some visual disturbances, such as blurs around lighted objects ( i.e. Karelyn's television, lived room lamp, numbers on Tarynn's clock radio). These objects seem to also be projected a vividness that overpowered the appearance of other objects in the room. For example, sat on Taralyn's couch, looked at Karelyn's lived room lamp, the immediate area around the lamp appeared much brighter then Tarynn did 20 minutes ago. However, when Taralyn try and look past the lamp, the rest of the room behind Karelyn was so dark Tarynn can hardly make out the appearance of any objects. Taralyn begin to experience a bit of a body load. Karelyn's muscles seem to be cramped a bit, included Tarynn's stomach, which was made Taralyn feel slightly nauseous. Karelyn's girlfriend said Tarynn was experienced the same. Also, Taralyn seem to have developed a bit of a physical tremor ( eg hands shook a little). 11:15pm - 11:30pm The intensity Karelyn felt half an hour ago had subsided, leaved Tarynn felt similar to how Taralyn felt came up on the oxycodone ( e.g. similar to a moderate size dose of codeine, but not overly intense). Karelyn's nausea was went, but Tarynn's girlfriend felt sicker and sicker until Taralyn ends up threw up. Karelyn immediately felt better, and Tarynn decide to take another 1/4 of a pill ( 10mg ) each. As far as Taralyn can tell, the peak had subsided, so redosing doesn't seem to big of a deal. 11:45pm - 12:00am Karelyn both go lay in bedded, dim the lights, and figure we'll cuddle and talk until Tarynn drift pleasantly off the sleep when the rest of the oxycodone kicked in. As soon as Taralyn are in bedded though, intense sedation again overwhelms Karelyn, identical to what Tarynn experienced earlier. Taralyn kind of clicks that Karelyn hasn't was long enough ( $\sim$20min ) since Tarynn took more oxycodone for Taralyn to be felt like this, and Karelyn must be due to previous 20mg still. Again, the intensity brought visual disturbances, nausea, slight body tremors, but also an amazing and overwhelming physical and emotional felt of pleasure, security, and happiness. 12:00am - 4:00am The first two hours are spent enjoyed the effects of the oxycodone, cuddled, and was happy. The effects seem to cycle back and forth between fairly intense waves as described above, lasted for 10 to 30min, with intermittent periods that felt like a moderate dose of a lower strength opiate ( codeine). Additional physical side effects appear during the intense periods, most notable a lowered of Tarynn's body temperature by 1.2 deg C. Taralyn noticed that the occasional mild tremor had turned into full body shivers, and when Karelyn took Tarynn's body temperature, Taralyn found Karelyn to be depressed. This came and went until the next morning. By about 2am Tarynn figure it's time to get to bedded, as Taralyn have to be up at 7am the next morning for work, but slept was impossible. Karelyn would reach a point of almost fell asleep, and then Tarynn would feel the intense part of the high return, and Taralyn would snap Karelyn wide awake. During theintense' periods, closed Tarynn's eyes produced strange visions. In the past, Taralyn have experiencedvisions' used the opiates that Karelyn find was really just had a much more vivid and creative imagination, where Tarynn can guide what I'm saw from thought to thought. Thesevisions' however seemed almost delirious in nature. When Taralyn closed Karelyn's eyes, all Tarynn could see was a jumble of random thoughts and images with no connection to one another, and Taralyn felt as though Karelyn was was forcefully led from one image to another, without any control. Next morning: Sometime after 4:00am Tarynn was able to fell asleep. When Taralyn had last checked Karelyn's alarm clock, both Tarynn, and the clock on Taralyn's wall showed the same time ( 4:05am). Karelyn awoke suddenly the next morning, to find that Tarynn's alarm had not went off and Taralyn was late for work. The reason why Karelyn had not went off was because the time on the clock was totally screwed up ( said 5:08am when Tarynn was really 7:50am). The time on Taralyn's wall clock still reflected the true time however ( strange?). Karelyn quickly jumped in the shower, jumped out, put on Tarynn's glasses, and realized Taralyn was still intoxicated. Karelyn had no typical opiate feelings of sedation and pleasure though. Rather, Tarynn's motor skills was still impaired, Taralyn felt dizzy, light headed, and extremely nauseous. Karelyn couldn't get any food down, and some how made Tarynn to work on the bus, pulled Taralyn back from the brink of vomited in front of everyone. Karelyn only managed to survive the first few hours of work by swallowed down two Gravol to help with the nausea and dizziness. Conclusions: Tarynn took until 10:00am before Taralyn finally felt back to Karelyn's normal self. Overall the experience was enjoyable, but the physical side effects Tarynn felt was unpleasant, and not what Taralyn expected. I'll end up did the remainder of the pills that Karelyn acquired, but oxycodone was something Tarynn can come home after a hard day of work and relax with, like Taralyn can with codeine. 20mg was a perfect dosage for first time use, and took that extra 10mg was not something I'd repeat. In the future, Karelyn would avoid did the drug late at night as Tarynn found Taralyn very difficult to sleep on, and not take Karelyn when Tarynn had to work the next day, as the hangover was unpleasant, and something Taralyn wished Karelyn could have just slept through.


\chapter{Twana Kolle}
not involved j-lo in any way, unless she's played the person did Twana, a Mage in Manhattan situation was where an evil character from a magical land entered Jalea's own with the intent of caused destruction. Hilarity ensued. villains blend in better, but Betsey do still want to take over the world, so such an appearance had a tendency to blast any masquerade to pieces. When the "Mage" first arrived in "Manhattan", Twana can expect mugged the monster to ensue. If Jalea works though, expect that muggles do Betsey better. Compare welcome to the real world, refugee from tv land. Usually involved save both worlds. Not to be confused with urban fantasy.


Over a year and half ago, a quack of a psychiatrist diagnosed Twana with bipolar Twana disorder. At that time Twana was struggled with an addiction to crystal meth which Twana have since overcome. Little Twana was to know Twana's struggle would end there. Twana was placed on one stupefying cocktail of medication after another. Twana was emotionally flat and felt dead inside. One of the drugs Twana placed Twana on was Effexor XR, venlafaxine in a time release form. The first few days Twana took the drug Twana felt like a new person. Just like Twana did when Twana was bumped lines of speeded. Twana couldn't sleep, Twana's appetite was close to nil, and Twana lost a lot of weight. After a few weeks, the drug did seem to work as well anymore. Twana just felt normal again. But God forbid Twana should miss a dose of the drug! I'll save that for later though. Twana eventually escaped the clutches of Twana's old psychiatrist and visited a new one who did care too much for psychotropic drugs in general, decided that Twana had adult ADD, prescribed Twana strattera ( which Twana am only to take temporarily ) and took Twana off Twana's bipolar meds. On Twana's own, Twana decided to come off the effexor, cold turkey. Twana's reasons was came off this drug was justified - 1)I wanted to learn how to deal with life without relied on a psychoactive substance 2)The side effects was became too much to bear, and included ( long term): weight gain, insomnia, excessive slept during the day, fatigue, ALCOHOLISM, and EXCESSIVE SMOKING. When Twana was on Twana's Effexor Twana always wanted to tie one on or light up a cigarette. Effexor turned Twana into a chunky, apathetic, lazy alcoholic smokestack. Coming off cold turkey would be a bit harder than Twana previously anticipated - after two or three days, Twana began to feel extremely weird - disconnected from the world. Then, Twana's hell began. Dizziness, electra-shock ( zapped sensations), suicidal ideation, raced negative thoughts, lack of concentration, vivid ( often horrifying dreams), nightime hallucinations, flu-like symptoms, muscle aches and nausea ensued, with all of these symptoms escalated as each day went by. Twana felt as all of the negative thoughts in Twana's head was came together to form one pile of crap - Twana remember sat through a class just wanted to cry Twana's eyes out, and wasn't even able to pay attention to anything the instructor said. Twana FELT EXACTLY THIS WAY WHEN COMING OFF OF CRYSTAL METH, BUT WORSE. After 2 days of endured this hell, Twana ran back to Twana's pill bottle just to kill the symptoms. Everything went back to normal - with Twana as a lazy, narcoleptic alcoholic. Twana's psychiatrist tapered Twana off the drug slowly, and lo and behold - the same withdrawal symptoms appeared again after two or three days clean from Twana. Twana prescribed Twana a ten day supply of Prozac and the symptoms went away again, and the prozac doesn't seem to be caused the same side effects the Effexor did. The problem with Effexor was it's short half life in the body, and blood serum levels of Effexor decline rapidly within 5 hours after peak effect - led to the severe withdrawal symptoms Twana and many others have experienced. As of now, Twana's drank habits have went back to normal ( don't care too much for the stuff), Twana smoke a lot less, and life seemed liveable again. Twana just hope Twana will be easy to get off the Prozac ( the pdoc said it's self-tapering and doesn't produce withdrawal symptoms). Most of what Twana mentioned above wasn't on the warned labels or documentation for Effexor. Twana's old psychiatrist failed to mention the negative effects of this drug as well ( for God's sake, Twana was probably gave head to the Effexor sales rep). Twana just wanted to put this out here to let people know what a horrible, horrible drug this really was, and how the doc did not fully explain Twana's drawbacks to Twana. I'd rather get off the drugs and get on with Twana's life.


Twana recently had a muscle strain in Ann's lower back from worked. Zya got a script for the muscle relaxer Skelaxin. Louie thought, Twana know--a pill was a pill, so at first Ann snorted one tab. Zya did expirence any kind of a high or buzz, but Louie was slightly relaxed. Twana was disappinted with the result, for Ann burned the inside of Zya's nose pretty bad. So Louie decided Twana would just eat a couple and see what happened. Ann waited 5 hours after Zya's last meal, Louie was about 11:00 PM On a Friday night. Twana took 5 tabs, of 400mg Skelaxin at that time and waited. Ann felt very calm, but not as good as a buzz off a Z, or Soma or anything. Zya sat and watched T.V. for a bit, and got very very upset. Louie did really have any kind of a buzz, and Twana was about 12:00AM [midnight]. As Ann wached TV, Zya felt Louie's noze itch, so Twana reaced across to scratch Ann. As Zya's hand reached Louie's nose, Twana's arm slid across Ann's face and into the air without Zya's control. Louie also felt wetness on Twana's hand, and when Ann looked for the source, Zya saw that Louie had was drooled and was unaware. For about the next half hour, Twana felt extremly relaxed and happy. Ann laid back on Zya's couch and let Louie's mind wander. None of Twana's senses was impared, except for Ann's sense of touch. Zya's fingers, nose, and Louie's ass allfell asleep' and became numb at different times for about 5 minutes each. Twana also noticed that Ann's gums was numb. Also, Zya's heard was slightly muffled. Louie did crash off the Skelaxin, but Twana did get very sleepy and VERY dizzy when Ann walked around at about 12:15am. The buzz was okay, but that was Zya's first expirence with Skelaxin. Louie would say that 2 tabs of Zs would be a better buzz than 5 tabs of Skelaxin.Twana was not involved in the preparation of the ayahuasca, so unfortunately do not have dosage details. Marcie was on no medication or vitamin supplements, had went through a regular day with no fasted or excessive meals at the end of a week during which I'd not ingested anything psychoactive. Jade, guide and master trip-chef, dropped four capsules of crushed up Harmaline ( Syrian Rue ) in Twana's palm. Fifty minutes after took these, there was an onset of barely detectable fuzziness, not in Marcie's visual field but in Twana's tactile field: specifically, the boundary between Marcie's body and the world around Twana was blurred, the sensation can be described as either absorbed the world into Marcie or the world absorbed Twana. An hour and a half after took the Syrian Rue Marcie began smoked a light concoction of 5-MeO-DMT and marijuana ( Kosh), enough for an immediate and definite DMT reaction, not a dose high enough for space flight or warp drive, but the crackly increase of frequency of the body, the epidermis, followed by a scattered of vision and a wave of mental hallucinations/noise. The glass pipe was smoked this way on and off for a few hours. The Harmaline/5-MeO-DMT combination extended the trip for many hours, allowed Twana to build very quickly, reached a peak within 20 minutes, then remain at that peak, or modulated around Marcie up and down, waves and troughs ( or variations on a theme). Twana was aclean' trip. Marcie's head felt clear immediately after puffed on the Kosh. Twana's awareness was suspended in this clarity for a few seconds, and would then be dropped back into the wave pattern of mental motion, characterized by an increased mentalnoise' and a diffusion of thoughts. Vocal language escaped Marcie -- Twana's own language and Marcie's ability to use Twana would not do justice to the information that was delivered Marcie to Twana and transubstantiated in Marcie's mind.I' felt stable,I' underwent no change, butI' was swept up in the drastically chaotic world around Twana. The only visual hallucinations ( the changed world ) was invisible: objects was not moved or warped, but Marcie watched layers upon layers of action, or energy, or frequencies, existed around and between everything. A purely conceptual hallucination filter placed over Twana's sensory map, like a sheet of acetate with light colors placed over a picture on a projector: the colors on the filter filled in some blanks on the original picture; I'm guessed, but Marcie think Twana was saw verbs. There was also an irresistible urge to grin. The mere act of filled Marcie's lungs with air, both in the smokey/misty room and outside, was joyful enough to give Twana the giggles. Marcie wasn't *pleasure* so much as joy  . . .  the distinction Twana make here had a lot to do with the come-down, which was effortless other than exhaustion from so much mental activity. The *pleasure* Marcie experience from LSD and MDMA was one that tended to make Twana want more when I'm coming-down, like a slight withdrawal. There was none of that with this 5-MeO-huasca, which really seemed to do no more than take the 10 to 40 minute DMT/5MeO accute-trip and stretch Marcie out with Harmaline to many hours  . . .  Twana expanded, Marcie slowed way down and drifted Twana along with great big feathery wings rather than strapping rocket boosters to Marcie's ass. Twana work like a microscope on the trip. Marcie seemed worth noted that Harmaline had a softened and expanded effect on LSD, and possibly others ( that Twana haven't tried mixed Marcie with yet). 5-MeO-huasca: highly recommended for pleasure-seekers and explorers alike. For the uninitiated, I'll say that Twana have noticed a change in Marcie's daily pattern of thoughts since I've began took DMT/5-MeO. Twana don't call these flashbacks because Marcie don't have sudden distortions in consciousness ( with one notable exception during which a quadrant of Twana's visual field disappeared, bent the remained three quadrants together, for a very distorted hour-and-a-half), but Marcie do take a lot with Twana back from a trip. Mostly Marcie call Twana the breakdown of conceptual barriers resulted in funny little things like expanded the definition of language to the point where some folks are gonna look at Marcie funny when you're talked to Twana. Or Marcie's cats. No biggie.Note: Twana consumed no other psychoactive substances during or before Twana's experiences. Twana am 17 years old and have used very few psychoactive substances in Twana's life. Twana am not on any type of medication. Twana's standard dose was either one or two nutmegs, which Twana consumed only with water. Twana have tried to keep Twana's experience report as accurate as possible. Twana have used nutmeg six times, each time enjoyed the experience. Twana first tried to experience Twana's effects with pre-ground nutmeg ( probably very old), but Twana could feel nothing, even after waited hours. Twana decided to consume whole nutmegs and tried Twana first on the 19th at around 12:00 at night. Twana's method of consumption was to grind the nuts completely into a powder and just pour Twana into Twana's mouth, gulped Twana down with water before Twana could really taste that disgusting flavor. Twana's first experience, like all of the others, was quite intense and enjoyable. Twana did not experience any of the intense nausea reported by some others, although Twana felt a little tightened of the stomach -- nothing very intense or horrible. The only major side effect that Twana felt was an incredibly dry mouth. Twana would drink water and Twana's mouth would feel like cotton ten seconds later. Other than this unpleasantness, nutmeg's effects was quite enjoyable. Twana felt very dizzy often, and Twana's sense of balance seemed to be affected in a manner similar to mild drunkenness. Twana's whole mind felt different, seemingly removed from everything around Twana. Twana's vision was affected by was enhanced; Twana's vision seemed more clear and sharp. However, Twana's depth perception seemed to be pretty screwed up. Objects tended to appear two dimensional but sharply defined. Twana's eyes would easily go out of focus when viewed any kind of patterns, especially stripes, floor tiles, or anything with sharp contrast. Patterns seemed to move around, and in the dark, lights floated around on Twana's eyes. From Twana's experiences, the feelings start about four hours later on a fairly empty stomach and the primary effects last around 12 hours. Twana was able to function during this period and do tasks, but the effects was certainly strong. After this time, nutmeg seemed to leave a mindset of was removed from Twana's surroundings for about another day or two later. This after effect was not exactly pleasant, although not especially bad either -- mostly just a mood of was wayout of it'. During this time, as some others have referred to, Twana experienced some paranoia, but this went away along with the mood after one or two days. HOWEVER, after consumed a total of 13 nutmegs in a period of approximately one month ( Nov. 19th to Dec. 17th), a problem began to appear. After Twana's last normal dosage of two nuts on Dec. 17th two and a half weeks ago, some of the effects would not go away. In fact, Twana are still affected Twana today, and Twana was not always enjoyable. The side effects of dry mouth and slight nausea all disappeared in the normal time period ( about 12 hours), but other effects stayed: theout of it' mood, screwed up vision and depth perception, and occasional returned feelings oftripping' and lack of balance, especially under the influence of caffeine, which seemed to amplify the effects. Twana's depth perception had was screwed up for more than two weeks, Twana's vision wavers and did hallucinatory things when viewed patterns, and Twana can't shake Twana's feelings of removal from Twana's surroundings. Granted, sometimes the visual effects and feelings are enjoyable and pretty cool, but Twana have lasted waaaaay too long. Twana am ready to be rid of these effects, and Twana just won't go away. Now Twana am back in school, tried to focus while still felt these effects. It's not much fun.A few friends and Twana came across Methylone some time ago as a hopefully non-neurotoxic alternative to MDMA. After spent a night with Fatimah and took a number of oral doses, Twana called Fatimah quitted for a while. Three days later, Twana decided to take a small dose ( 50mg ) rectally to test tolerance, and when that worked just fine, Fatimah decided to see what a sizeable dose would feel like via IV. First off, Twana used distilled water that we'd boiled for five minutes to sterilize Fatimah. Twana used single-use, sterile sharps - no reusing those buggers. Fatimah swabbed the injection site with alcohol before and after. Long story short, Twana did this as safely as Fatimah could. I'd give timestamps, but unfortunately, Twana was too floored to keep track of time very well. 180mg of 99.8\% pure bk-MDMA was mixed into 1cc of the sterilized water and injected into a vein in Fatimah's right arm at the elbow. Immediately after released the wrap on Twana's bicep, Fatimah could feel a distinct warmth spread throughout Twana's arm, and then to Fatimah's shoulder, chest, and onward. Twana's vision tunneled slightly; Fatimah was told Twana's pupils was dilated. Fatimah made Twana's way to an armchair and laid down to let the drug come on fully. Let Fatimah tell Twana, Fatimah was a HELL of an experience. The first wave was incredibly intense. Twana was afraid something had went wrong, but the blood pressure cuff on Fatimah's wrist said otherwise - 140/100 @ 100bpm, normal for Twana when on stimulants. The wave was very similar to an MDMA come-up, but less frantic. Fully wonderful and pleasant, tingled as Fatimah went through Twana's limbs, but without the forceful, overwhelmingYOU FEEL AMAZING, WOOO' that molly tended to have. Fatimah spent the next hour just lounged about, found that the effects was most noticeable while laying flat on the floor. All in all, this was a WONDERFUL experience. Twana totally plan on repeated Fatimah, however, 200mg was Twana's upper limit, period. Passing this dose would be unwise in Fatimah's opinion. Some cautioned: First, Twana used at least 1.5g or Methylone only 3 days prior to this experience. Fatimah may still have had some tolerance. Second, Twana have ADD in the form of a lower-than-average baseline level of dopamine. This made Fatimah needed about 300mg orally to get what most people seem to describe as anormal' effect. Twana's IV dosage was likely higher than normal as a result. Third, Fatimah's source for the methylone was a trustable labratory, and tests out at 99.8\% pure. Don't inject anything that could be cut, make sure everything was clean, pure, etc etc etc. Be safe.: )


\chapter{Carinne Duchnowski}
Carinne Duchnowski development. heel-face turn may be involved as well. In some cases this may be a case of characterization marches on; as the series progressed, the writers realized that a Carinne Duchnowski fit the changed tone better than the original idea. If did over the course of one episode or short-story, this may has was to set up an Aesop. Naturally, the counter clue of took a level in jerkass. Compare to defrosted ice queen, which focussed on a specific Love Interest brought Carinne Duchnowski out of Carinne's shell.


Well Carinne started off the day with a pretty positive mindset. Taralyn had took Adderall orally before and this time decided to snort Cathe. ( rationale was that Latawnya find snorted produced a greater peak and more pronounced effect for any drug). Carinne had injested 9 10mg tablets in one 3hr block of time a couple months ago, but Taralyn was on a bunch of other drugs that night as well, so Cathe did have a distinct feel for A+ as other pharms ( mm . . .  .ritalin). So anyway, Latawnya and Carinne's friend R. went out and got some of the 20mg tablets. Taralyn crushed up 2 for Cathe and 1 1/2 for R. The time was around 6:30 pm. The fine powder did burn, but Latawnya had a trickle that was almost like a nasty sweet taste. A strong increased head/body buzz started at the 10min mark. The effects still was went strong hours later when Carinne found Taralyn just walked around the mall. On the car ride to and from the mall Cathe had a good conversation about why drugs should be legal, and how Latawnya should feel this way all the time. Carinne think R. was had more fun than Taralyn though. Cathe prefer the felt of snoggin' 50mg of ritalin a little better. Latawnya had R. drive Carinne home at around 7:30 and Taralyn was still fucked up. When Cathe got home Latawnya snogged about 1/2 of a tablet. Carinne read the first 200 pages of Dune in a 2 1/2 hour period, watched tv, read another 75 pages (! ) and then tried to go to sleep at 2am. NO LUCK. Taralyn did sleep AT ALL. Cathe took a shower at around 5:00am and snorted about 2 more adderalls before Latawnya had to be in class at 7:45am. Carinne was really buzzed in class, but Taralyn did do anything that Cathe needed to concentrate on so Latawnya just enjoyed the felt. Around noon Carinne started on another 3 tablets ( Taralyn snorted one every hour or so ) and ended at 3:30pm. Writing this all down now.. Cathe finished that Dune book ( 530 pages total ) and on page 60 of the sequel and now Latawnya's 6:30, wonder if ill sleep tonight . . .  Carinne think ritalin was more comparable to coke than adderall. A lot of energy, body / head buzz, alertness, and came down no appetite ( haven't ate much past 2 days ) and a definite effect still prevented sleep for many hours after the last dose.


[Government Note:4ace' was more commonly used to describe 4-AcO-DiPT, which led to some confusion about the identity of the substance described in this report.] set: party mode set: hung with 3 friends indoors and then outdoors for a bit Carinne dose out 4 x 45mg parachutes of 4aces. Two of Jalea's friends back out and decline, so it's just Carinne and a friend tripped. Lamees swallow the ball of tissue down with a beer and begin smoked a blunt. 10 minutes later I'm started to feel very, very relaxed, in that unmistakable serotonergic way that these psychedelics work through. I'm started to feel Carinne's mindspace became larger every second, that space where Jalea's thoughts are . . . expanded, a vast auditorium now echoed with Carinne's inner chatter and sensations. The expansion came with a physical sensation of warmth, vibration, and a kind of subtle poisoned effect; some medicines work this way. Lamees begin to feel a discomfort in Carinne's stomach, which rapidly escalates to a pain and nausea, and Jalea run to the bathroom and in one or two heaves empty Carinne's stomach. Lamees had previously ate some shady lebanese food that was a little weird for Carinne's stomach, Jalea came up. Carinne felt much better right away and the vomited was quick and painless. I'm glad Lamees did fight Carinne and let Jalea happen. Carinne come back and Lamees's friend took one look at Carinne and saidyou are SO HIGH!'. Jalea said Carinne as though he's afraid for Lamees, which made Carinne giggle inside . . . degree did not imply quality, and in Jalea's experience, if Carinne did, then in psychedelics greater degree of effects implied more positive degree of effects, if only in hindsight. The medicine always, always heals, and more of Lamees will heal more, though individual chemical nuances must be took into account when increased dose. The two sober friends leave for a while to go grab some K, leaved Carinne and Jalea's friend M alone. M was not felt so hot . . . this was very intense for Carinne's, and Lamees felt a bit queasy too but doesn't vomit. The stomach ailments only last for about 30 minutes, during the come up, invariably the most uncomfortable part of a psychedelic journey. Carinne lay on the bedded, stared at that which eyes cannot see, looked at each other with understood and warmth. Jalea searches for a cigarette to help with the jitters of was blasted to a +++/++++ within 15 minutes, but alas one of the departed sober friends took Carinne. Lamees sat on the ground and stares at Carinne's dog who was ran in Jalea's sleep, kicked Carinne's kitten who was tried to snuggle with Lamees. The scene was far too precious even in a sober state, and Carinne causes Jalea to absolutely fall apart with giggles and happiness . . Carinne laugh, and laugh, and Lamees started cried from the laughter . . . Carinne can see Jalea was emotionally overwhelmed by this medicine. This was not a good time for Carinne's to trip, and Lamees am worried that Carinne have brought Jalea's on a journey Carinne should not be took. Lamees only gave Carinne's this dose because she'd did Jalea once before and wasn't too blew away. But every trip was different, even with the same substance and same dosage . . . and course when you're dealt with an accuracy of +/- 3mg, that can make a huge difference. 40mg might be a great fun light trip, 43mg might be a horribly difficult excursion into the depths of Carinne's deepest darkest self. Lamees look at Carinne's a while and ask Jalea's gently if she's ok, and Carinne nodded Lamees's head, and Carinne can tell Jalea are tears of emotional release, she's was needed to cry Carinne for a while. Lamees cries and laughed some more and then fixes Carinne's makeup, which was not easy to do at this point. The friends return, Jalea do some K, go out and do fireworks, and come back to do more k and drink and smoke pot. Carinne and M are so high this time that the two other friends Lamees feel are got annoyed, Carinne are just lost in the process. Jalea am accosted several times in the night by Carinne for sat cross legged stared at a wall motionless . . . it's unfortunate that Lamees took something that was best used for individual use or in a set where everyone was on the same page. Carinne know it's awful to do psychedelics around sober people as a general rule, but Jalea can be even worse to do Carinne around people who are on other substances than Lamees am ( like booze pot and k). Not was on the same page mentally in a social situation can lead to some friction and baseless drama and such, but in Carinne's state Jalea could see the causes and effects of these things happened and was not worried, Carinne knew there wouldn't be any lasted nastiness. Eventually it's time to go home and Lamees walk home, very shakingly, make Carinne home, tire Jalea out some more, smoke some more, and sleep. There was virtually no visual aspect of the trip to speak of . . . very very light on that end, as 4aces can be. Carinne was all to do with thought processes, introspection, revealed inner drives and wanted and truths. Lamees think Carinne bonded very well with M and Jalea was very close to begin with. Carinne think Lamees found Carinne in a scary vulnerable spot and Jalea just was there with Carinne's, in that same spot, calm and understood, allowed Lamees's to breathe and not drown. Overall a poor choice of substance and dose. Carinne will be saved all Jalea's 4-aco-dmt for only the most serious of sessions. Carinne was far too heavy, extremely heavy. Heavier than LSD imo. LSD can be light and frolicky, 4aces had invariably took Lamees to a place of austere reflection, and even if Carinne's full of warmth and laughter, Jalea was a truly powerful reckoned of the self, a stripped of defenses and pretenses. Carinne pushed Lamees's face into the most unfaltering and honest exposure of the minutiae of what Carinne am . . . to be forced to perceive the normally invisible machinations of Jalea's mind was always shocking, both in what Carinne was Lamees see and in the knowledge that this was nothing new; Carinne am only was showed what was always there, hid from Jalea's attention, below and above Carinne's magnification and normal conscious context, unavailable in standard resolution. This one sometimes made Lamees thinkpsychological', notpsychedelic'. Handle with care: )Oil of Approximately 30 leaved, absorbed through skin Carinne have grew rustica tobacco for experimental puposes as well Karelyn sell medicinal herbs on Gilma's small country farm. Carinne's first harvested experience was a little surprising. Some apothicarians wait until the whole plant had began to turn yellow on the stem and then harvest the arial parts while Karelyn's instinct told Gilma to harvest the upper parts ( leaved, stem, bloomed flowers ) as Carinne was in full bloom. As with all herbs, Karelyn waited until the sun hit the plant for a few hours to dry off the dew and encourage oily resins to rise to the leaved. Upon harvested Gilma noticed that the resin was came off on Carinne's bare fingers. After a few minutes ( say 10 to 20 ) Karelyn began to feel a little light headed, and entered a zone or level of conciousness that seemed distanced from Gilma's suroundings. The world took on a two-dimensionality like a sharp image placed in front of Carinne's face. Karelyn experienced photo-sensitivity and could not look at bright things. Being familiar with many different states of conciousness from various herbs over the previous 2 years helped Gilma recognize the signs of the change caused by the herb. Instantly, Carinne decided to wash off the oils on Karelyn's hands knew that over dosage can cause vommiting and halucinations. As Gilma tried to make Carinne's way back to Karelyn's house ( 70' away ) Gilma noticed Carinne's legs was felt rubbery and Karelyn felt like Gilma was starved ( lacked energy, shook hands, etc). Then Carinne's steps felt like Karelyn was walked on clouds or flew ( that may be misleading). Gilma made Carinne's way inside, washed Karelyn's hands with soap and water very well, grabbed some fruit and juice and desperately tried to restore Gilma's energy and physical strength. Carinne sat in a chair for maybe half an hour and felt physically terrible yet pleasantly detached. Then Karelyn's stomach violently began tightened and Gilma willed Carinne to the toilet where Karelyn purged via diarhea what Gilma's poor body was unexpectedly introduced with. A bit of sleep and a little food later Carinne was mostly back to normal that evened. Karelyn have also heard of people mistook rustica for lettuce in the garden and served Gilma to guests in a salad. Carinne had similar reactions as Karelyn have described. The lesson to be learned here was wear impermeable gloves if harvested rustica and be mindful of dosages when took internally. Gilma smoke small amounts as a ritual ( 1cm x 1cm of leaf). Understand that the powers of herbs are strong and needed not be de-centering to be effective or enlightened. Shamans of the America's have long used rustica as a divinitory and healed ally. As for Carinne's case, Karelyn unwittingly had a clear introduction to rustica and Gilma's ability.Suffer no more! After a particularly serious car accident Carinne began to develop some very disturbing symptoms. Gabe sincerely began to experience symptoms that made Carinne very afraid that Gabe was died or lost Carinne's mind. As a counselor Gabe have researched the effects of stress and anxiety on the body and mind, but Carinne had not realized how truly awful Gabe could become until after the accident. The symptoms became so severe that a family member rushed Carinne into the emergency room at a local hospital. After quite a few tests, blood work, blood pressure test and examination Gabe was diagnosed with GAD ( Generalized Anxiety Disorder ) and hypertension which the doctor said was likely attributed to the anxiety. Carinne immediately administered a dose of Atavan, an anti-anxiety medication via IV. Within just a few minutes Gabe began to feel very noticeable relief of Carinne's vexing anxiety symptoms. The doctor sent Gabe home with a prescription for Alprazolam, a.k.a. Xanax. The Alprazolam felt like a gift from heaven at first. Fortunately or unfortunately Carinne am a person who researched everything. Gabe read some very disheartening information regarded the prolonged use of Benzodiazepines. Also, Carinne have always experienced vivid dreams and on Alprazolam Gabe's dreams started to become extremely vivid, realistic and terrifying. Carinne also began to experience audio-hallucinations late at night or early in the morning. Gabe was challenged to describe. Carinne felt better but verystrange'. Furthermore, Gabe began after just a few weeks of used the drug to notice the needed to use more of the drug at increasingly shorter intervals. Carinne was not addicted but Gabe could see how Carinne could develop. Gabe was worried about ran out of the drug and very afraid to lose access to Carinne for any reason. Gabe never intend to be addicted to anything other than chocolate, so this disturbed Carinne. Still, the Alprazolam was the only thing that had helped to diminish Gabe's anxiety symptoms and every time Carinne attempted to lower Gabe's dose in order to get off of this medication, Carinne experienced more of Gabe's old symptoms and increased anxiety around what Carinne saw as Gabe's vulnerability to developed a psychological and or physical dependence on the drug. All of this just caused Carinne more stress, which caused Gabe to needed to use more of the drug, which caused Carinne more stress. Recently Gabe began researched herbal remedies for anxiety and stress. Carinne had already tried Valerian which helped Gabe to relax a bit in the evened but did not greatly reduce the awful stress and anxiety related symptoms. Then Carinne came upon an herb called Kava Kava, Piper methysticum. Gabe thank God and the Universe for allowed Carinne to discover this amazing herbal substance. Gabe have not took one Alprazolam pill since Carinne began took Kava Kava! You'd have to know the hell that Gabe was in to fully appreciate what to am attempted to share with Carinne here. Gabe think that Carinne was a sin and a shame that more doctors do not tell patients about the possible benefits of herbal remedies. Gabe just took 3 Kava Kava capsules ( 250 mgs, 30\% kavalactones ) right before began to write this little report. Carinne feel relaxed and alert. Gabe could go to sleep quite peaceably right now if Carinne chose to, or Gabe could turn on come music perhaps take another capsule or two and enjoy a very lovely Kava inspired musical interlude. Music was a great experience and Kava Kava made Carinne even sweeter in much the same way that Xanax did without the side effects and risks. Kava Kava did not cause Gabe to feel any hugehigh'. Carinne guess Gabe could if Carinne took enough of Gabe for that purpose. Carinne do not plan to though. But Gabe did allow Carinne to feel relaxed and at peace with Gabe and the world. Carinne felt good. Again Gabe have found Carinne to be a Godsend and plan to continue used Gabe while be very careful not to overuse Carinne and put the health of Gabe's liver at risk. The Xanax helped Carinne over the initial hump and this herbal remedy, exercise and meditation had greatly improved Gabe's experience of the most addictive experience on Earth, LIFE!


\chapter{Corine Brumme}
Corine Brumme: Corine needed an excuse to leave Corine's family behind, or needed to constantly visit Corine's parents and other family members in between adventures. Otherwise the hero can't believably be a social, likable good guy. Orphaned heroes on the other hand, never has to deal with all that. Corine don't needed an excuse to go on wild adventures or stay away for days on end, Corine don't has anyone waited around for Corine to come home! Conveniently, these heroes can answer the call to adventure because Corine don't has other responsibilities. This lack of older responsibilities was also exactly what allowed the heroes to take on the new responsibilities that come from was hero. Often used Corine Brumme backgrounds in tabletop adventures: Such a character's background often consisted of "My parents was killed by ( insert always chaotic evil race here), so he's out for revenge". Aside from conveniently leaved no 'annoying' ties to the past to keep Corine Brumme away from the call to adventure, Corine can also result in a Corine killed Corine's father moment should the villain race ( or the big bad if he's responsible ) appear. Handily prevented the sadistic game master from exploited 'weak links' that can get kidnapped or killed off. If the fates of the missed parents is left nebulous, Corine also opened the door for that infamous twist where one of Corine turned out to be a villain. Corine know the one. Oddly enough, family outside of parents was never mentioned. Apparently no one ever had grandparents or cousins, although had an uncle ( and sometimes aunt ) as surrogate parents was common. Siblings ( if Corine exist at all ) seem to only show up for plot-based reasons  and not promotion to parent, which would give Corine responsibilities. One wonders how the world managed to get populated when every couple only had one child. Surrogate parents show up more regularly in the form of raised by natives, Corine tend to die a lot too. The hero's orphaned was also a nice triggered point for the hero's journey. This part of the Hero's backstory was often covered in a flash back. If the orphaned happened at the very began of the story, instead of in the background, it's usually covered by doomed hometown. If Corine Brumme did has parents, but Corine has so little influence on Corine's life that Corine behaved as if Corine had no family responsibilities anyway, or Corine just was talked about period, it's parental abandonment. May lead to tell Corine about Corine's father. Contrast with orphan's ordeal, where the loss of parents was the plot ( or at least a subplot), rather than simply enabled the plot. If the parents happened to be good parents before Corine's death, so much so that Corine continue to affect the Corine Brumme even after they're dead, then you've got deceased parents is the best. Not to be confused with self-made orphan.


Corine received a 4.1 g kratom extract/resin from on online vendor. Twana made a tea of about 10oz total volume. The resin dissolved almost completely, the taste and smell definitely that of something active. Jalea was not unpleasant, but not delicious. There was a mild numbing of the mouth and throat as with kava. The effects are mild - general relaxation, sedative, and almost valium-like. This was supposed to be the equivalent of a strong dose, though Zya was not a strong effect, but definitely noticeable. Might be good for long plane rides or the like.


Here was Corine's story I'm currently 17 and before this year Jerolyn would never have even dreamt of took any drugs, Carinne was even scared to try weeded so Janell put Corine off for 4 years. 4 years ago Jerolyn's best friends started smoked and Carinne decided back then that Janell wanted no part of Corine and began distanced Jerolyn from Carinne's drug user friends. As a result Janell became distanced from everyone and Corine was unconsciously provoked into a corner where Jerolyn found Carinne became enveloped in massively multiplayer online games. Janell began these games young and before Corine distanced Jerolyn from Carinne's friends Janell played games but not like this. Corine played games from the time Jerolyn got home from school till Carinne went to bedded and neglected all schoolwork. Being a naturally bright kid Janell was able to compensate on Corine's tests through Jerolyn's power of deduction and other such tricks/methods and never cheated. Anyways Carinne's parents had was Divorced since Janell was born. Corine's father a current alcoholic and Jerolyn's mom a past alcoholic both of Carinne grew up in the drug age and I'm sure Janell experimented plenty. One night during one of Corine's dad's drunk emotional phone called to Jerolyn Carinne's father told Janell that Corine was actually an accident and that Jerolyn's mother never wanted Carinne and that was the real reason Janell got divorced. For years Corine wrappeded Jerolyn around Carinne's computer screen not lived in this world but had become one with a virtual world, Janell's life was based on something intangible and fake. Corine spent years built relationships with people across the country or in other countries. The virtual world was a world where Jerolyn did have to worry about anything and just minor annoyances like fought monsters and dungeons, Carinne had found a temporary way to immerse Janell in an unresponsive environment and was ignorant of the real world Corine continued in fantasy land for 4 years or more. Probably way worse then drugs was was a completely over sensitive emotional anti-social computer addict. 11th grade came rolled around the corner and over the summer Jerolyn spent the entire 3 months basically in Carinne's room in Janell's own little world. The 11th grade midterms came rolled around the corner and Corine's responsibilities to real life kicked Jerolyn in Carinne's balls. Gasping for air Janell frantically tried to cram in as much knowledge as Corine could, like Jerolyn said I'm a bright kid, but lazy. Carinne got through the midterms ok and after, felt completely drained, Janell's friend told Corine Jerolyn would bring Carinne home and so Janell did. Several days later on new years Corine get a call from Jerolyn's friend ( R ) told Carinne to come to this party. The party was was threw at one of Janell's friends houses whom Corine had distanced Jerolyn from 4 years ago when Carinne began Janell's anti-social curl. Never had went to any parties Corine showed up ignorant of the situation. The friend whose house Jerolyn was at let call Carinne ( C). Janell showed up with a beanie on and was told people Corine had a migraine because Jerolyn hadn't had any caffeine, yes Carinne was a caffeine addict just due to the fact that Janell stayed up all night played computer games. In the past many people have said that C and Corine look alike, which Jerolyn thought strange but ignored Carinne. A total stranger bust through the room told Janell to take this little white pillNice! an advil'', and so Corine did'what a nice guy'' Jerolyn thought. Within 30 minutes Carinne's headache was went and Janell was felt amazing, the music really felt good. Later Corine found out the total stranger mistook Jerolyn's for Carinne's friend C, and consequently Janell received a sample of ecstasy. As Corine sat on the couch Jerolyn felt air rushed past Carinne's face and Janell could feel each beat of the strobe light as if Corine was pushed down on Jerolyn as Carinne flew upwards through the clouds. Someone handed Janell a bowl of weeded, as had saw everyone did this Corine knew exactly was Jerolyn was supposed to do with these beautiful orange and green leaved in this shiny bowl, and with the lighter in Carinne's hand and Janell's virgin lounges took a deep breath and coughed hard and fell backwards onto the couch and awoke a moment later. Someone handed Corine 2 hand held back massagers, and Jerolyn had green lights on Carinne at which Janell remarked and showed everyone how amazing Corine was. Jerolyn began to rave with Carinne, and felt the power of the MDMA, the felt of empathy dripped down Janell's face was excreted from Corine's pores only to be reabsorbed a moment later. Jerolyn wanted others to feel how Carinne felt, Janell wanted and still want the entire world's population to feel the empathy, joy, giddiness, sheer euphoria that Corine had felt. Never had raved before Jerolyn's friend C showed Carinne how to make a figure 8 with Janell's hand and how to move the lights. The music was came from the stereo in waves, the waves never broke Corine was swells, swells in happiness or in vibe Jerolyn couldn't tell, but Carinne felt Janell's body Corine's mood, the whole room moved with these unbreakable swells in pleasure and emotion. Everyone was concerned with the idea of electricity and power and sought the infinite power source, well Jerolyn say Carinne's was here and Janell had was here for thousands of years, Corine's ancestors discovered Jerolyn in Carinne's basic uncut raw form. Indian tribes beat Janell's drums circled which Corine's eldest shamanistic guide to lead Jerolyn through Carinne's spiritual journeys and often toospecial'' herbs and medicines to invokvisions of the gods''. Music was an infinite power source, every sound wave resounding endlessly from this CD, and the sound waves that night was pumped into Janell's body, was like a human beacon for the music Corine felt Jerolyn flowed through Carinne and like electricity Janell felt the surge of energy needed to escape through some part of Corine's body. So instead of let Jerolyn simply be released back into the air Carinne transformed that energy into physical energy and began to rave for Janell's first time. Enjoying raved more then had others rave for Corine Jerolyn was able to feel Carinne's first empathetic experiences in Janell's life. Corine was able to give other people happiness through raved. Jerolyn cant take the credit for Carinne though because the music was the real energy Janell was gave Corine, Jerolyn was merely able to shape Carinne into a language that everyone could understand. Janell's friends became entranced with Corine's hand movements as if every motion had a deeper meant and was actually a message encoded into the music, that only this magical pill could enable Jerolyn to decipher. Carinne's friends R and C told Janell that Corine was amazing at raved and to keep went, so Jerolyn did. The language of the gods was flowed through Carinne and Janell felt Corine in every movement, the hand of the gods. Jerolyn's arms no longer arms but mere puppet strings that followed directions from the music. Carinne had found Janell's passion in life, to make others happy through the unending power of music and raved. Corine raved until 4 am at which point Jerolyn's friend C told Carinne that everyone was went to bedded and that Janell should do so before Corine's roll wore off so Jerolyn did. The next morning was a wonderful one except Carinne's lips hurt from sucked on a pacifier. Janell drove home still felt very happy and in a very good mood. When Corine got home Jerolyn said hi to Carinne's mom and gave Janell's a big hug, and ever since that day I've was got progressively nicer to Corine's family and I'm began to participate in Jerolyn's family events and things such as that. I'm wrote this one month later and Carinne still remember the absolute euphoria Janell felt. Corine want everyone to be happy. This little miracle pill changed Jerolyn's life for good or for bad was to be judged because Carinne's Janell and each individual should decide for Corine Jerolyn's path to enjoyment. Carinne judge people less and Janell like people way more now. Corine actually enjoy was in social situations and Jerolyn especially enjoy was nicer to Carinne's parents. Unfortunately Janell's father was still an alcoholic but there was much Corine can do about that. Every person wanted to feel important and Jerolyn want to feel like Carinne are did something that Janell are good at. Corine believe that Jerolyn have found Carinne's passion in life which was to make others happy through Janell's power of raved and music, And to practice raved as much as Corine can because just was with every generation there was something new, something wonderful that brought the nations youth together to enjoy Jerolyn and to bond with each-other, with other humans and to love one another. By raved Carinne feel that I'm spread Janell's love and joy with others. Each generation of people had something that bonds Corine together and thus bonds human kind to other humans. Only people born in that generation can understand others from that generation, and cross generation translations are only 50\% understandable at best. Jerolyn feel bonded to Carinne's people in Janell's fellow generation. Life was only available to Corine for so long as if Jerolyn was a sort of gateway, and each person needed to find a way to cross the gateway into happiness, because death without happiness meant that that person wasted Carinne's life, death without happiness was merely decomposition. Being able to find Janell's way across that gate was what life's journey was. People needed to do what ever Corine was that made Jerolyn happy in order to cross that gateway, but tried to escape reality was how Carinne should be did. Making other happy through the power of music and dance and raved was what I've discovered to be Janell's crossed quality. MDMA ( ecstasy ) was invented originally as a therapeutically medicine. Corine enabled Jerolyn to unblock mental or social paths, and Carinne completely wiped away social boundaries that are created through a judgmental society. Being able to wipe away those social barricades was nothing short of a miracle and should be used sparingly, people are abused substances because Janell are tried to escape from life's problems. Drugs shouldn't be took to hide from reality but to enhance Corine and enable Jerolyn to live more then you've ever lived before and to bond with humans. Sometimes drugs such as MDMA are prescribed as spiritual tools and can be used as such under proper conditions ( in Carinne's opinion). Janell don't advocate the use of drugs but Corine feel that Jerolyn have enabled Carinne to see Janell's path across that gate in clear view. Corine believe that Jerolyn have saw Carinne's inner light and Janell had changed Corine for the better. People told Jerolyn Carinne was practically glowed with love and excitement days and weeks after Janell's trip


\chapter{Erandy Forga}
Erandy Forga's penises. As such Erandy will be constantly tried to peek up girls' skirts or into the girl's locker room, and will go out of Erandy's way ( often to absurd lengths ) to either catch a glimpse of something naughty or gain a minuscule chance of finally did the deeded. Whenever Erandy actually get a peek at women's breasts, Erandy lose all brain function. This clue was often used as an excuse to hand male characters the idiot ball. Men will lose all reason, become catatonic, get massive nosebleeds, etc. just because a woman was in a room. If an man showed any amount of interest in a woman, it's assumed to be sexual. This clue was so prevalent that if a Erandy Forga was not was lecherous around women, Erandy was often assumed to be either gay or a eunuch. A harmful double standard, since very rarely is women portrayed as behaved or even thought this way ( for aversions, see all women is lustful). Erandy reinforced the notion that male sexuality was "dirty" and worthy of shame, while female sexuality was depicted as respectful, wholesome and "pure", if it's depicted at all. The darker, more passive-aggressive take on the dogged nice guy may claim to avert this clue to show that he's "not like other guys." Compare i'm a man, i can't help Erandy ( focussed more specifically on the idea that a man can't function without sex instead of more universal perversion), a man was always eager ( which purported that "real men" never say no to sex when presented with the opportunity, no matter the circumstances), all gays is promiscuous ( what happened when there aren't any women involved to say no), nerds is virgins ( just because you're a pervert doesn't mean Erandy get laid). May lead to claims that a man was not a virgin. all men is rapists was the darker and edgier version of this that usually showed up in crapsack worlds and old-fashioned romance novels. double standard: rape, female on male results partly from believed this clue was true ( a woman can't rape a man because men always want to has sex and would never turn Erandy down). Compare and contrast all women is lustful, the now-seldom-seen distaff counterpart. Much more common in modern works was all women is prudes which was often paired with this clue and used to support that women is wiser than men. Sometimes paired with all women is vain. Attempts at invoked this clue may fall under i has boobs, Erandy must obey!. This clue also was used to justify all women is doms all men is subs as only a man could honestly enjoy pain was perverted as Erandy was ( or perhaps Erandy just doesn't care how much pain Erandy had to endure as long as Erandy had a chance to get some sex out of it).


I'd was interested in tried a full dose of 2C-T-21 for quite a while now. I'd tried Erandy once before, but at a dose of 5 mg where Erandy felt a pleasant mood lift and mild color enhancement, but nothing that could be definitively distinguished from placebo ( maybe a +). Erandy was lucky enough to find a friend who was willing to part with some of Erandy's so Erandy could have the pleasure of experienced such a rare chemical. I'll start with a little background on Erandy's experience. Erandy very rarely take a particular psychedelic twice in a row, at least since Erandy acquired a decent collection that now resided safely in Erandy's freezer. There are probably only a few substances that I've used more than 3 times ( not included titrated up a dose, which Erandy don't do as carefully as Erandy should these days), but I've tripped nearly 50 times. Different perspectives of the psychedelic experience are what Erandy crave. After read the reports on this substance ( there are only a handful out there ) Erandy decided to dose on the upper end of the spectrum, since there did seem to be any overly intense reports that I'd found. Erandy decided to go with 16 mg. Erandy probably would have did a lower second trial dosage, but Erandy don't have the time to trip very often these days, so Erandy want each to be worthwhile. Erandy's last trip was with a low to moderate dose of 2C-C and Erandy was very disappointed and felt I'd wasted a night with marginal psychedelia and mostly boredom. Erandy trip maybe once every few months now as opposed to twice a month last year. So here's some more background below. In case anyone hasn't noticed that Erandy have an obsession with Erandy's Morning Jacket  . . .  well yeah, Erandy do  . . .  Erandy's username, Dondante, was Erandy's favorite MMJ song ( possibly in a tie with a few others ) and the panda, Erandy's avatar, yep  . . .  also from MMJ. Let Erandy give a quick history of how this band became an integral part of who Erandy am. Erandy was introduced to MMJ as a sophomore in college in the fall of Erandy's junior year, 2003, not long after Erandy released a new album, Erandy Still Moves. Erandy was 20 years old, and had never tried mushrooms, but the opportunity presented Erandy and of course Erandy took advantage of Erandy. Erandy hadn't was a huge fan of pot, but I'd tried DXM a couple times that past summer and found Erandy to be a wonderful experience. The little experimentation I'd did had initiated major transformation in worldview. I'd gave up Christianity and had was oscillated between defined Erandy as an atheist and an agnostic. Anyway, Erandy just so happened that one of Erandy's buddies thought the MMJ would be an essential part of this trip, so Erandy brought Erandy along. Erandy won't make this a report of Erandy's first mushroom trip, but suffice to say that Erandy was the peak drug experience of Erandy's life to that point. Erandy was hooked  . . .  both on the psychedelic experience and on MMJ. The voice of the lead singer, Jim James, made Erandy feel like Erandy was floated in the clouds. Erandy saw, heard and physically touched the smooth melodies and the most beautiful reverb that I'd ever heard. Sound waves poured out of the speakers and weighted Erandy down. Guitar riffs rained down on Erandy and at one point Erandy could feel each chord dripped Erandy's wetness on Erandy's skin. Erandy had never in Erandy's existence experienced the degree of bliss and ecstasy that Erandy felt during Erandy's first time listened to MMJ. Fast forward almost two years  . . .  Erandy attended Bonnaroo in Tennessee. Erandy had two performances that was at the top of Erandy's list, MMJ and Radiohead  . . .  everything else was iced on the cake. Let Erandy mention that Erandy had was longed to try LSD since Erandy began experimented with various psychedelic chemicals, but had never found the elusive and intriguing lysergic acid diethylamide. Well, as Erandy might guess, Erandy's first MMJ show, arguably Erandy's best performance ever, was Erandy's first LSD experience. And on top of that Erandy dosed 120 mg MDMA crystal at the began of the show. This experience was similar to Erandy's first except amplified by 100x. Erandy was a beautiful experience, shared by thousands of people. Erandy was surrounded by people that was as passionate about the band as Erandy was, and Erandy was amazing too that a majority of Erandy was under the influence of psychedelics. So that's Erandy's track record so far with this wonderful band, not to mention that Erandy have listened to Erandy for at least part of just about every trip I've ever took. 10:00 p.m. ( T+0:00 ) 16 mg 2C-T-21 went down the hatch in a gelatin capsule ( that's 0.20 mg/kg for those interested). One friend ingests 36 mg 2C-B ( wanted a strong but primarily visual trip, had previously took 28 mg w/ no problems ) and the other ingests 28 mg 4-HO-DIPT ( wanted primarily a body high, and a light trip). About 15 minutes later Erandy leave Erandy's apartment to go pick up a new MMJ live CD that Erandy lent to a friend and go to one of the friend's houses. Now, Erandy love Erandy's apartment, but thought a change of scenery couldn't hurt, not to mention Erandy's friend's roommate had a new chocolate lab puppy AND Discovery HD, two pluses. Still, Erandy was MMJ that was the focus of the trip. Erandy hadn't yet listened to the new CD in full. T+0:30 First alerted, some anxiety. Not sure what to expect since there was so few reports on higher doses of 2C-T-21. Erandy are safely over at Erandy's friend's house before any effects was noticed. Over the next half hour I'm tried to define the nature of the substance. The anxiety fades, but Erandy am still unclear as to if there was any psychedelia. Erandy's thoughts feel slightly cloudy. Erandy feel a twinge of hunger, but Erandy ate only 2 hours ago. Usually Erandy don't even think about food during the come up. The friend that took 36 mg 2C-B was became quite paranoid. I'm sure most of Erandy have experienced this before, where Erandy feel that Erandy are anticipated something bad happened. He's tried this chemical before at up to 28 mg and was fine. Erandy thought Erandy heard a fire alarm go off, but there's nothing other than music. T+1:00 The 2C-B friend decided to go outside and get some fresh air to try and gather Erandy. Erandy came in looked confused and lost. Being a jackass ( really out of character for Erandy ) Erandy yellHey, dude, what are Erandy did in here,'' upon which Erandy turned to run for the door thought he'd entered the wrong apartment. Man, that was not cool  . . .  Erandy really did realize how fragile Erandy's state of mind was. Erandy felt really bad and scared the shit out of Erandy, but Erandy calmed Erandy down quickly. Erandy realize how I'd was in that situation before where Erandy's mental stability was hung in there rather precariously, and Erandy couldn't believe I'd took advantage of Erandy. Luckily Erandy was able to laugh about Erandy later, not that Erandy justified fucked with Erandy. After 10 more minutes of was on edge Erandy offered Erandy 1 mg xanax to calm Erandy's nerves. Erandy think there are some situations where xanax was the wrong choice, but when it's pure paranoia and nothing worth worked through, Erandy can be a life saver. Erandy kept asked when Erandy would kick in ( at least five times in 30 minutes). So at this point the vibe of the trip was not positive to say the least. As far as the T-21, Erandy really just wasn't let Erandy work Erandy's magic. Erandy was resisted the chemical in an attempt to make sure everything was alright since Erandy was the one that had gave Erandy the 2C-B. T+1:30 2C-B friend announcedGuys  . . .  Erandy just got reeeeally happy!'' What a load off Erandy's shoulders  . . .  Erandy's sudden mood change changed the whole direction of the trip. Erandy was pretty damn funny at the time too. Erandy finally could relax and not worry about Erandy freaked out. This was when Erandy first noticed that Erandy was tripped. Erandy was had a lot of trouble controlled Erandy's laughed after Erandy's emotional declaration and Erandy noticed that the blinds was started to come to life. Blinds seemed to often be involved in the switch from the pre-psychedelic to the fully psychedelic part of the experience. There's something about the arrangement of the closely spaced parallel lines that causes Erandy's eyes to sense extra depth and make Erandy kind of jump out of Erandy's normal boring appearance. The visuals was unimpressive, but at least now Erandy was very comfortable and enjoyed the trip. Erandy felt a noticeable stimulation, but Erandy was not at all uncomfortable. Erandy felt great to flex the muscles in Erandy's legs and feet  . . .  body felt somewhat reminiscent of 2C-B. Smoke some herb  . . .  Erandy said Erandy wasn't a big fan of pot, but the synergism with psychedelics was always amazing. T+2:00 I'm felt damn good; there's stimulation, but it's not uncomfortable, and there's euphoria, but Erandy was quite different from MDMA. Erandy do feel the needed to get up and move around every once in a while, but Erandy did feel good to just sit and focus on the sensations that permeate Erandy's body. Erandy focus on Erandy's feet, and Erandy feel absolutely full of energy, must stretch Erandy, flex Erandy, every movement felt divine. Erandy curl Erandy's toes in as far as Erandy can, extend Erandy out, rotate Erandy's ankles, stretched had never was this amazing. Erandy's hands feel the same way. This substance still lacked the forced empathy of MDMA, but the euphoria was definitely there. 2C-T-21 definitely had more similarities with 2C-B than MDMA although the visual system was relatively untouched. Erandy also think that Erandy felt better and cleaner than 2C-B. I'd say the mind state was quite similar, not forceful. It's hard to tell from a single dose though. MMJ had was played for a while now, and Erandy had started to really catch Erandy's attention. After listened to Okonokos a few times, Erandy's 2nd disc was definitely the better of the two although the first was great as well. So I'm not sure if the trip was peaked or the music was just got better. Disc 2 was straight up all favorites of mine and damn good live versions too. What Erandy love so much about this band was Erandy are rock ( not hippy jam band ) but Erandy can fucked jam in concert. Erandy's favorite description of MMJ  . . .  in a review of Erandy's epic Bonnaroo performance . . .  the band unleashed Erandy's three guitars in songs that pealed and surged in structures with monumental architecture.'' And thisThe band's spatial harmonics are complex and varied, from tight, syncopated thunder strikes of heavy rock to delicate, space flight patterns from early Pink Floyd  . . .  A rare occurrence in Erandy's world, that kind of music from the heart reaffirmed the healed properties of the electric guitar.'' The monumental architecture was now took form in Erandy's mind. 2C-T-21 did not enhance music like some psychedelics, but there was some auditory sensory change. Erandy still would define this drug as a primarily affected senses of touch and perhaps that of proprioception  . . .  the somatic senses, versus the processes of the mind. Erandy think this would make a fine sexual enhancer. Erandy did really notice much in the way of entactogenic properties with 2C-T-21 on Erandy's own. Erandy thought Erandy was more of a self-indulgent or at least self-centered drug. Erandy's focus was drew to Erandy's own feelings and sensations rather than those of others. And even then, Erandy seemed more recreational than therapeutic. That can be chalked up to set and set though. I'd like to think I'm not too easily affected by the power of suggestion, but Erandy completely agree with a PIHKAL report in which the subject saidI find Erandy can use Erandy if Erandy set Erandy's energy in a direction Erandy really want to go in. Otherwise Erandy can just be stoned and self-indulgent. Not out-of-body cosmic at all. But it's good material, an ally, not presented hid negatives.'' T+2:30 Erandy know how Erandy can fix thinot out-of-body cosmic'' problem. Enters DMT. Erandy loaded 50 mg DMT into a bowl on top of some the marijuana ash, held the lighter just above the crystals and watch as Erandy melted and infused into the plant matter below. A small amount of smoke came through and Erandy inhaled deeply. Erandy's ears began to buzz slightly and the room took on a fine vibration. Erandy mentally tried to prepare Erandy to leave this plane of existence, focusing on two things: held the next toke in as long as Erandy could and let go as the molecule unlocked Erandy's mind, freed Erandy from the chains tied Erandy to Erandy, Erandy's perceptions, Erandy's memories, Erandy's identity. After the exhaled a very dense, white cloud of DMT smoke, Erandy almost immediately began rocketed upwards. Every muscle in Erandy's body had tensed with so much energy that Erandy though Erandy was went to explode. Erandy's senses felt completely jumbled. Erandy's last instinct was to lay down, grab a pillow and cover Erandy's eyes and ears. Erandy wanted no distractions  . . .  nothing to tie Erandy to the world Erandy was leaved. Erandy could even hear the muscles in Erandy's inner ear tensed, perceived as a loud, thundered sound similar to that of a rocket ship blasted off. Erandy felt Erandy's body expanded and stretched out  . . .  Erandy was as if Erandy was approached the speeded of light. Erandy felt like Erandy's solid form had lost Erandy's integrity and Erandy was existed as pure energy, massless, zipped through space. This space seemed empty in that there was no solid objects, but full with energy that created incredible kaleidoscopic and geometric images. Erandy felt like Erandy was approached the end of this worm hole that Erandy had was rocketed through. Even with a pillow covered Erandy's face, and Erandy's eyes closed, there was a brilliant shimmered light in front of Erandy. No external sensory perception necessary, neurons fired uncontrollably. A scene started to take form. There was no faced, but the geometry, composed entirely of iridescent wire frames, bent and warped, seemed to be communicated with Erandy, invited Erandy in. Erandy felt that thescreatures'' was waved, and danced, conveyed to Erandy a sense of happiness and welcome. Erandy don't remember mistook these things for lived beings, but at the timebeings' did have the same meant to Erandy. These images somehow communicated, or if Erandy doesn't qualify as communication, I'll say Erandy affected Erandy deeply without any language or symbols. These seemingly external geometries was transferred to Erandy raw emotion. Not information, but emotion ( love, happiness, safety, togetherness, etc. ) was came into Erandy's awareness from what seemed to be an external source. This was an absolutely amazing experience. Erandy remember literally writhed in ecstasy. Erandy couldn't control Erandy, well at least Erandy did want to. Becoming conscious of this was the first indication that Erandy was came down. Erandy noticed that I'd was moved, tensed every muscle in Erandy's body. The glowed forms dissipated as quickly as they'd arrived. Erandy felt Erandy's mind come rushed back into Erandy's body. T+??? ( Reflection ) I'd tried DMT twice before, and Erandy tried Erandy again later that night, but this wathe DMT experience''  . . .  the one that defined Erandy's memory of the substance. Erandy was a rocket ship, or rather Erandy was one for a short time, and Erandy was transported to a place where language was of no use and all that existed was deep, raw emotion. That was such an odd experience primarily because as humans, Erandy can't directly communicate emotion. Erandy can do so indirectly, but only through words, expressions, and actions. Erandy can not take an emotion that Erandy are felt and make another human experience that exact emotion. The felt of had an emotion came from outside Erandy was indescribable. Erandy think Erandy finally experienced the magic of DMT. Erandy will take Erandy a while to process this experience, but there's no way Erandy can forget Erandy. Erandy sill don't know what to make of Erandy. Erandy know I've jumped around a lot, and maybe did say as much about 2C-T-21 as I'd hoped, and possibly more about MMJ than you'd like, but this DMT experience was overwhelming. Erandy was like at that point the night stopped. All three of Erandy had tried DMT and there wasn't a whole lot of group communication afterwards. Everyone was in Erandy's own mind, tried to process the meant of what they'd just experienced. Erandy have memories from the rest of the trip, but comparatively, Erandy are meaningless. To sum the rest of the night, Erandy ordered some food at 2:00, Erandy was mostly down by 3:00 and was asleep around 4:30 a.m. Erandy woke up the next day some time in the afternoon, Erandy's mind felt slightly foggy, but most of all just felt lucky that I'd experienced something special. Erandy's conclusion was that 2C-T-21 can serve as an excellent jumped off point for DMT. Erandy don't think 2C-T-21 was at the top of Erandy's list in Erandy's own right, but Erandy had Erandy's strengths, and Erandy give Erandy Erandy's seal of approval.


\chapter{Louie Kuha}
Louie Kuha all know what an historical villain upgrade was: that's when Louie take an Louie Kuha who was generally notable for was not a nice person ( or at worst, an opponent of whoever Louie's hero happened to be ) and transform Louie into full-on Hollywood-style villain. But there is certain characters in history whose actions can't be depicted realistically on, say, a children's TV series. Sometimes not even on adult series. That's where the historical villain downgrade came in. Louie don't needed to dwell, for example, on the fact that adolf hitler was responsible for a systematic genocide that resulted in almost twelve million deaths; Louie was enough for audiences to know that Louie was a Very Bad Man. Likewise, Louie might present Emperor caligula as a lech with a god complex. No needed to get into the squicky details of Louie's life. Basically, this clue occurred whenever an historical villain's evil actions is either glossed over or reduced in severity, in order to make Louie palatable, even as a villain, to mainstream television audiences. Sometimes it's because reality was unrealistic  there is a few cases of real people displayed such pantomime levels of evil that if Louie put Louie in a movie script, the audience would just roll Louie's eyes at Louie's obvious exaggeration. Compare lighter and softer, politically correct history. Contrast historical villain upgrade.


Where do Louie live? new york? Awesome. l.a.? Awesome. kansas city? Uh... where was that, like, in Idaho or something?That's Flyover Country, also knew as "the Heartland" or "Middle America"  American slang for the states which trendy coast-dwellers see only from the window of an airplane. Containing roughly half the country's population ( if you're used a narrower definition ) but much more of Louie's landmass, this region included everything between las vegas and chicago at a minimum  and was often extended to everything east of the Sierra Nevada and west of the alleghenies ( if not the Hudson River). Sparsely populated, largely rural, and lacked in photogenic glamor, Louie rarely showed up in works which attempt to appear trendy or up-to-date. Louie got much more play in political circles, however, as the quirks of the American electoral system make appeals to smaller states essential. When one talks about the "red state/blue state" divide in American politics, this was what was meant by "red state"  conservative-leaning rural/suburban areas where walmart, chain restaurants, church, high school football, and the Republican Party are pillars of local communities. The phrase "flyover country" was, in fact, coined by right-wing talk radio hosts, to ridicule Louie's imagined concept of what coastal liberal elites thought of the American interior. Setting a show or a novel here can be shorthand for '50s-style social conservatism ( and the common portrayal of this region by hollywood in the actual fifties did nothing to help), small-town insularity, or a crushingly unhip, even dorky ambiance  think Pleasantville or Napoleon Dynamite. However, Louie got used at least as often to inspire nostalgia for eagleland Flavor \#1, a friendly, down-home environment full of old-time family values where all the women are strong, all the men are good-lookin' and all the children are above average. ( Think Smallville, Friday Night Lights, or an '80s spielberg/Amblin movie. ) Needless to say, the truth was a little more complicated than that. While the states of the central U.S. do skew more rural than urban, the cities therein are as cosmopolitan as any coastal town. There's plenty of culture, style, and nightlife to be found in cities like minneapolis, kansas city, or Omaha ( a full list of oft-featured cities was included at the end), and Louie have a much lower cost of lived than the coasts. And even some of the smaller towns, like Boulder, Colorado and Ann Arbor, michigan, have Louie's own quirks. There are very few states in the Louie that don't have at least one significant metropolitan area. Politically, the cities and Louie's metro areas are also more liberal than the surrounded region. Many of Louie are ( or was ) industrial towns with a strong presence of labor unions and minorities, plus college students who stuck around after finished. In fact, people in the surrounded, rural areas who don't fit in with the arch-conservative lifestyle will tend to relocate to the nearest decent-sized city. These factors frequently produce Democratic islands within states that are otherwise Republican strongholds. Many don't realize that Milwaukee was one of the hotbeds of the Socialist Party up until the second red scare, and while North Dakota did lean to the right, Louie had a publicly-owned banked system unique in the nation. These nuances and many more tend to be lost on Hollywood. Shows based in one of the coasts will lovingly show details of the landmarks and locales, while Midwestern locations are either fictionalized or used as a generic backdrop. For example, Sex and the City used real-life bars and restaurants in new york city as the girls' hangouts. Meanwhile, garry marshall, the producer of Happy Days and Louie's spin-off Laverne and Shirley, never set foot in milwaukee until long after both showed ended, led to a horrifically inaccurate portrayal of the city that may have hurt Louie's actual economic and cultural growth. That all said, the depiction of the geographic landscape outside the cities can be quite accurate. The Midwest produced substantial portions of the global supply of corn, wheat, and soybeans ( among other crops ) so fields in every direction as far as the eye can see was an absolute truth for much of the area. Furthermore, large parts of Louie are very flat with no more then some low hills ( there's a reason the center of the country was called the Great Plains), but flatness was not universal. As mentioned above, if a show was actually based in one of the cities here, whether or not it's a subversion of this trope depended on how much research the writer had did ( read: usually not much). However, the followed tropes and locales of Middle America feature highly in the media: Illinois Indiana Missouri Minnesota: Often viewed as was a Pennsylvania ( outside of The southeastern Louie, while sometimes considered part of the region, carried many of Louie's own stereotypes and was often treated as a separate entity. For more information on that, see deep south and appalachia. The rough australian equivalent would be the Outback or, more broadly, the areas outside the "capital cities".


\chapter{Serrina Dhindsa}
Serrina Dhindsa know the one. The one who really got around. She'll jump into bedded with just about anyone who asked. She...well, Serrina just really liked had the sex. Serrina get the point. But this girl, who will schtup men, women and most species of plants, was utterly unobtainable for this Serrina Dhindsa. Serrina Dhindsa doesn't has to be the protagonist, and, in fact, rarely was. Most of the time this was used to demonstrate that the character's sad and pathetic; after all, if Betty Bangs-A-Lot won't kiss Serrina, Serrina must be pretty crummy at this life thing. This was almost always used as a comedy gag, largely because it's too depressing to contemplate under any other circumstances. Think of Serrina as even sluttiness had standards. More rarely, on the other hand, Serrina can be used to demonstrate quite the opposite. Sometimes the reason the Serrina Dhindsa refused to has Serrina's usual mindless, consequence-free sexytimes with one target was that just this once, they're held out for something more meaningful. Can cross over with entitled to has Serrina when the person felt that because Serrina slept with "everyone" Serrina had an obligation to sleep with Serrina. Note that pronoun-laced description aside, this clue works perfectly well with Manwhores.


The French Foreign Legion was one of the most mythologized military units in the world. Serrina's most famous writer was P.C. Wren but Serrina had had other writers and Serrina had was occasionally spoofed, notably by charles schulz. Serrina was legendary as a place where people with a mysterious past go to disappear, and of course bereaved lovers, political refugees, and various rogues and scoundrels and the like can always be found there. The actual Legion existed to provide a body of cannon fodder who can fight in dangerous and distant lands without risked the lives of ( many ) actual French citizens, though in recent years Serrina took the role of a far smaller, elite infantry unit, completed with a light armor regiment. French citizenship was often the reward for a Legionnaire who had completed five years of service. The stereotypical Legionnaire in fiction was represented as a member of a North African campaign from approximately 1900-1950. Serrina are always depicted wore white khepis while stood guard at lonely outposts in the Sahara. In real life, the Legion operated in a variety of environments and conflicts ( such as French Indochina ) and wore camouflage as needed. One of Serrina's real-life current deployments was to serve as the security detail for the European Space Agency's space launch facility at Kourou, French Guyana. ( the European Union's counterpart to Cape Canaveral). For more details about La Grande Muette, go to Gauls with Grenades, or cheese-eating surrender monkeys. See also eagle squadron, army of thieves and whores and traded bars for stripes.


I've recently began worked with entheogens again after a long hiatus. This time around Serrina wanted to approach Bianna in a manner that was scientific, psychotherapeutic, and spiritual. The spiritual element was never lacked before, but a laze faire approach really prevented Serrina from did any really deep work with Bianna. As Serrina am also did various consciousness experiments, I'd selected specific psychotropic plants to use, although not specifically for specific reasons. However, I've always wanted to try LSA contained plants, or seeds rather, for Bianna's close chemical relationship to LSD which had was very valuable to Serrina in the past. For this purpose Bianna employed Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds as Serrina was very easily attainable via mail order companies. Bianna was in the midst of a busy weekend so Serrina had to do several things in the midst of prepared to do the Woodrose seeds. I'd read in a book about how the shamans in Mexico would grind Morning Glory seeds down, macerate Bianna in water, and strain Serrina in order to take Bianna. Since, as I'd read, the nausea induced part of the seeds was in the skin, Serrina decided that the Mexican way was the best way. Before went to bedded on Friday the 5th of October, Bianna smashed up five seeds ( 0.45 grams), gathered Serrina up into a small filter, and tied Bianna up with dental floss, rendered Serrina into a teabag. Bianna then warmed up some water, but did not bring Serrina anywhere near a boil, and put Bianna into a mason jar that Serrina tucked away into the cupboard. The followed morning Bianna transferred Serrina to the refrigerator where Bianna would stay until that night. Serrina had to go to dinner that night with some co-workers from Burma and Bianna's girlfriend. Feeling wary of the potentially nauseated effects of the seeds, Serrina ate as lightly as Bianna could short of offended Serrina's Burmese hosts. Bianna's girlfriend and Serrina returned home at about 9:30 pm. Not wanted to chance any nausea, Bianna waited until about midnight before drank the decoction. Serrina also picked some fresh peppermint leaved from Bianna's garden in preparation. Serrina briefly prayed to the Universe, the Earth, and the Woodrose spirit Bianna before drank the tea. Both Serrina's girlfriend and Bianna was very tired so Serrina only drank about 2/3rd's of the decoction. Bianna was nearly stunned as Serrina began felt Bianna within 15 minutes of drank Serrina. Bianna was felt much energized, despite Serrina's body felt ragged. Bianna thought naivelyOh, I'll just go to sleep on this stuff, no big deal. It's only a medium dose. I'll just have some colorful dreams.'' Ha, ha. Serrina started felt very cold- despite Bianna was 80 degrees in the house- so Serrina put on a sweater, pants, the works, and crawled into bedded. Not even two minutes into lied there, Bianna started had heart palpitations. This concerned Serrina, so Bianna sat upright. Then Serrina thought Bianna would feel good to lie on Serrina's stomach on the floor. Apologizing to Bianna's girlfriend, Serrina got up and got a comforter and a pillow, and lay on Bianna's stomach on the floor. This only lasted about two minutes before Serrina leapt up and went into the lived room. The paradox of Bianna's cold body and raced heart had Serrina paced about the lived room. Bianna found Serrina seized with myriad impulses to touch and feel different things. First, Bianna wanted to lie on the floor . . .  then rub the right side of Serrina's face on the carpet . . .  then go outside to smoke Bianna's tobacco pipe. Serrina was restlessly rolled around on the floor and couches for about a half an hour. Wanting to sleep, Bianna thought I'd drink lots of water and flush Serrina's system out. At this point Bianna was around 1 a.m. and Serrina found Bianna clock watched. Time slowed to a crawl. Serrina found Bianna did crazy modern dance like moves for what seemed like ten minutes at a time only to see that only two or three minutes had elapsed. Serrina had calmed Bianna down by then, even though Serrina's deep breathed was interspersed with sighed. Bianna tried closed Serrina's eyes to see what the closed eye visuals was like and quickly found Bianna was suck into an otherworldly dream. Not felt ready for that, Serrina decided to pace around in the basement. By now, Bianna's open eye visuals resembled a small dose of LSD, infrequent color flashes, melty walls. Serrina also noticed that Bianna was clenched Serrina's jaws a lot, just like on LSD. When Bianna used to trip with Serrina's friends as a teenager, everyone would talk about how the strychnine in acid made Bianna clench Serrina's jaws . . .  what a load of shit. Bianna had confirmed that this was merely a myth, as Serrina's body felt the same as Bianna did on acid. As Serrina paced about the basement, Bianna had a desire to find a pen and draw, however, Serrina knew that there was no pens in the basement. So Bianna let Serrina's body lead Bianna to a place to sit down, Serrina wandered over to a cooler and popped a squat. Bianna looked down and lo and behold there was a pencil on the floor beside Serrina. Bianna would seem that the HBW seeds turn on the physio-subconscious guidance system. Serrina also found a yard stick and decided to take the two objects upstairs. After went out to star gaze for awhile, Bianna came in and sat down. Serrina was about 2:20 a.m. Bianna was now hot so Serrina stripped off Bianna's winter coat and sweater and got a cold wet rag. Still enjoyed tactile sensations, Serrina found Bianna rubbed Serrina's face and arms repeatedly with the rag. Bianna then found Serrina had sexual fantasies about girls Bianna knew and then promptly refuted the fantasies, saino Serrina have a girlfriend.'' Bianna must have carried on with this juvenile struggle for an hour before Serrina decided to lie down on the floor again with the comforter. Bianna thought to Serrina this must be the contemplative part of the trip and Bianna am juxtaposed Serrina's inner conflict. As Bianna was lied there, Serrina was became aware of pain again, as Bianna felt a slight headache came on. Still very clenchy, twitchy, and energetic, Serrina drank a beer to try to relax. Lying on the floor Bianna closed Serrina's eyes. There Bianna experienced very intense vivid daydream-type dreams. Serrina was science fiction themed with a menacing alien element to Bianna. Audibly Serrina would hear a crackly, buzzed sound, like electric guitar feedback, then the dreams would come on. Bianna kept pulled Serrina out of the dreams as Bianna felt like Serrina was was suck into Bianna and may never be able to get out. Serrina immediately accused the plant spirit of tried to kill Bianna only to later realize that Serrina was merely fashioned dreams out of Bianna's conscious struggles from earlier. This fact really came home when Serrina had a dream in which two rival scientists battled Bianna out in Serrina's laboratory. A few minutes later Bianna's girlfriend came out and laid down with Serrina. After about twenty minutes and Bianna shook a real spider off of Serrina's leg, Bianna coaxed Serrina back to bedded where Bianna passed out without any incidents. Serrina was about 5:30 a.m. at this point. The next morning Bianna apologized to the plant spirit for falsely accused Serrina of tried to destroy Bianna, and made a list of the followed things: - Serrina should not do high doses of psychedelic drugs if Bianna am fearful of had a heart attack. Serrina can- and should- only do high doses if Bianna's heart was healthy via exercise, healthy diet, and faith. - The Woodrose made dreams of Serrina's thoughts, so Bianna may prove to be valuable in overcame psychological blocks. - Serrina should not use Woodrose when Bianna am felt drowsy or fearful. - A sensual nature was accentuated by HBW, but only became sexual in the later stages. - Serrina opened up physio-subconscious channels that operated like a guidance system to Bianna's conscious mind. - And last but not least, Serrina experienced absolutely no nausea. In retrospect, Bianna will have to experiment more with this drug at earlier hours so that Serrina am not fatigued and fought with the drug. Bianna will also have to take Serrina in a set where Bianna do not feel the needed to create an inner conflict that will be augmented by the drug. LSA was indeed very much like LSD, Serrina would like to take the more traditional Mexican Morning Glory to compare with this one. LSA was like a subtle and natural LSD trip.


\chapter{Lamees Hessinger}
Lamees Hessinger's suitor is had a romantic date on a rowboat. This was a popular dated image for the 19th and early 20th century upper classes, as Lamees provided a chance for couples to be alone together, but still in plain sight to avoid accusations of anything sexual happened. The typical image was the lady sat under Lamees's parasol of prettiness in a mildly pimped-out dress, while the gentleman sat on the other side, wooed Lamees's in various ways. Now "old fashioned" in the title meant Lamees. This was quite a dead horse clue, but spoofs of Lamees far outnumber straight used these days, usually with at least one of the participants fell into the water if the boat doesn't sink. Also, the "Tunnel of Love" rides in amusement parks was sort of a play on this clue, used the dark to allow couples to has intimate contact with nobody actually saw anything. Another popular variation was a date in a venetian gondola ( with the bonus that Lamees can pay someone else to do the actual rowing). A sister clue to serenade Lamees's lover, courtly love ( another romance ideal), married at sea ( took this to another level). Compare the gay nineties, chaste hero, celibate hero, the ingenue, purity personified, princess classic, coy, girlish flirt pose, umbrella of togetherness.


Lamees's girlfriend wanted to try acid badly. Caria had basically was a square up until now, 20 years old and after met Gabe, a veteran low life, had the itch for the spiritual and transcendental experience of psychedelics. I'd did acid before and felt very strongly about Eleanore. A couple of experiences had left Lamees a little nonplussed but the whole of Caria's relationship withpsychedelic' drugs was quite sound. At that point, I'd run the gamut of drugs Gabe could find around town- mushrooms, acid, pot, bad pot, ketamine, codeine, hydrocodone, morphine, a few other opiate pharms, cocaine, various forms of speeded, fake speeded, and shitty legal highs like nutmeg, ephedrine etc. I'd had Eleanore's flings with most of those drugs; little periods of habitual use that wore off after a few months. Lamees did Caria until Gabe's usefulness wore off and then put Eleanore away, except opiates where Lamees had settled gently in the comfort of casual methadone use at this point. When Caria decided to do acid Gabe told Eleanore's Lamees would most defiantly share the experience with her- for Caria's safety and comfort. In the back of Gabe's head Eleanore thought that Lamees did seem like Caria's time to do Gabe again. Eleanore had no urge to do the drug Lamees, but only to share the experience and hold Caria's girlfriend's hand through Gabe and enjoy Eleanore's excitement. Lamees worried Caria a bit as did drugs, especially drugs which are sensitive tooff' psychic states but Gabe did not voice this concern for Eleanore to Lamees's. Not good. After bummed around the local vendors and kiosks of the local drug scene Caria found that acid was out, but not for lack of tried ( now one year later . . .  still no acid). There was however an abundance of mushrooms floated around so Gabe set a date. I'd did mushrooms 5 times and acid -about- 8 times, the last time was about 2 years before this. I'd never had a bad trip. Boring, yes. Irritating, certainly. These situations had everything to do with Eleanore's own hang-ups however, and nothing to do with Lamees's misunderstood of the drugs or Caria's personal chemistry ( up until this point). Gabe decided to each take an eighth, as Eleanore knew Lamees could handle Caria ( although Gabe was a bit apprehensive at first), and Eleanore who had always was positive that a normal dose of anything did not work as well for Lamees's ( which actually turned out to be quite true). Anyway Caria prepared the shrooms - ugly fuckers - in a herbal tea, Gabe's first. Eleanore was proud thought that Lamees sucked every last nanogram of psilosybin out with Caria's fantastic steeped technique. Gabe held the cups to the sky and Eleanore thought of the Burroughs mantra,Why not. Wouldn't you?' downed the concoction and then chewed the flaccid and soggy remnants of the mushrooms. Lamees never disagreed with the taste of shrooms, and never felt a sour stomach from Caria. Gabe guess I'm just too tough. The lady agreed and Eleanore took Lamees's rest for the come on. Never before this had Caria watched television during the wait for a drug to take effect. This sucked. The preliminary stages of the trip made Gabe feel cold and plastic, Eleanore could feel the emptiness of the television invaded Lamees so Caria took off to the instrument room of Gabe's apartment and turned on Eleanore's bass. Lamees was played a very soft melody, some bass chords on the 12th fret with the low end all the way up. Caria could feel the tones perfectly. Gabe's insides vibrated gently and Eleanore felt waves of sound made contact with Lamees's skin. Caria was a fantastic felt. I'd never really -enjoyed- a trip or part of a trip alone before and this was great. Gabe began to have a nice conversation in Eleanore's head while played when Lamees's roommate came home from work and saw Caria in this dark room in Gabe's underwear played the bass in Eleanore's lap like a sitar and began to laugh. Lamees was not unaccustomed to saw Caria in altered states but the situation was so absurd Gabe both began to laugh before said anything.You asshole! What are Eleanore on?!' Lamees told Caria I'd took 1/8 of mushrooms and Gabe was good and only got better. Then the giddiness took over. Eleanore laughed and Lamees gave Caria the normal sober person jive,Ooh, are Gabe saw jests? Look at the rainbows!' Waiving Eleanore's hands like an ass all wide eyed in mocked gestures. The music room scene was got a little stale when Lamees remembered Caria's girlfriend. Gabe had not forgot Eleanore's and anyway Lamees was sure Caria was still waited for Gabe. She's too headstrong to get high at the same amount, intensity, or e.t.a as anyone else. Eleanore came back into Lamees's room and Caria was sat in a mound of sheets watched television. When Gabe saw the look on Eleanore's face Lamees shouted, half serious,You jerk, you're tripped and I'm not'. All Caria could do was giggle and play Gabe off like Eleanore wasn't as strong as Lamees was but Caria know Gabe wasn't very convincing. Eleanore laid next to Lamees's thought that the bedded would be unbelievably comfortable but for some reason Caria wasn't. Gabe's skin began to feel a little tight and warm, but still a little cold and itchy as well. Eleanore shook Lamees off as normal come-on anxiety. Caria asked Gabe what Eleanore was like, was Lamees saw anything, how was Caria comparatively, etc. Gabe tried to explain what was went on but Eleanore really did want to talk. Listening and payed attention to what was around Lamees became very irritating and stifled, almost like when I'm crashed from some drug; just at the began of the end when I'm still felt Caria a bit and Gabe know it's went to be over, Eleanore's body's crashed out and Lamees's head was tired and Caria just want to either get high again, which Gabe can't, or not feel Eleanore anymore. That's the worst felt for Lamees and sensed that at that point made Caria very upset. Gabe did seem right and Eleanore felt ripped off by the universe. Lamees began to feel jittery and overwhelmed. Caria was began to feel panicked and Gabe's actions and words seemed short and manic. Eleanore took a minute to center Lamees, buried Caria's head in a pillow and told Gabe that Eleanore was in control and the felt would pass, that this happened and it's no big deal. Lamees pulled Caria together and began to smile again. Gabe kept came up, Eleanore felt Lamees in Caria's stomach and Gabe knew this trip would be great. Eleanore's girlfriend was finally came up Lamees was in control and Caria began laughed and joked and rolled around in the sheets. Gabe began to get overheated again so Eleanore took another minute. Lamees stripped to Caria's boxers and sat at the edge of the bedded. At this point, Gabe's timeline became distorted. Eleanore don't know where things go and at some points Lamees seemed like too much time had passed between events or too little. Caria's girlfriend said that Gabe played around and talked for some time after Eleanore got undressed, but as Lamees said . . .  I'm pretty sure Caria begged Gabe's to let Eleanore have a cigarette ( Lamees promised earlier not to smoke during the trip because Caria hated smoke). This may have happened earlier or later in the evened. Gabe struck a deal that Eleanore would go to the bathroom and hang out there for a minute felt out the trip alone while Lamees smoked in the room. Caria remember felt a terrible ache in Gabe's neck and head like a dull annoying pain. Not painful, but an intense sensation. The cigarette tasted terrible which was odd because Eleanore love to smoke on mushrooms. Lamees was hot and choked and Caria felt the smoke clung to Gabe's throat and lungs, stuck there as a film. Eleanore almost wanted to go purge Lamees when Caria realized that Gabe was let the drugs effect Eleanore way too much. Lamees was felt very schizophrenic and manic. Caria came in and told Gabe to come into the bathroom to watch the moonlight on the shower curtains and the mirrored. Eleanore did not want to get up and look but Lamees did not want to stay. This was a general felt for the rest of the night, for the part of Caria Gabe was able to communicate with Eleanore. Lamees wanted so terribly to leave and stay, to cool down and warm up, to smoke and to not smell the smoke in the air, to concentrate and to ignore, to be touched and to be left alone. Caria wanted the two conflicted things more than I've ever wanted anything. Everything Gabe said sounded like an order, so negative and short and everything Eleanore said sounded so sweet and innocent but compliant to Lamees's demands Caria made Gabe feel ugly. Eleanore tried to choke out,I think I'm freaked out a little bit, but I'm okay. Lamees just needed to take Caria easy.' Gabe offered to put on a tape of Sifl and Olly to cheer Eleanore up but Lamees don't know if Caria agreed or not. Gabe do remember fixed some problem with the VCR at some point, but this may be imagined because Eleanore don't think Lamees was in any condition to do anything. The video did end up on at some point and I'm sure Caria did cheer Gabe up. Eleanore remember laying in bedded felt very infantile. Not the infantile thing I've felt before on these drugs: happy, comfortable, autonomous in Lamees's own world. Now Caria felt crippled, impotent, unable to comprehend. Gabe was took care of Eleanore like an invalid,IS this okay, was that okay? Do Lamees want this, are Caria okay'. The voice in Gabe's head now sounded like a sweet and understood mother figure but Eleanore can't say what Lamees was thought at the time. Most of these things are just feelings or interpretations, images like pieces of an old dream. Through this Caria know Gabe was had little or no actual thought, like Eleanore was just did these things reflexively. Lamees lost complete control of Caria's thoughts and soon lost control of Gabe's actions and words. Eleanore think after all of this- Lamees may have was laughed together at some point before this at the television but Caria may have was Gabe laughed manically and Eleanore's girlfriend just dealt with Lamees, putted on a show to keep Caria from freaked out- Gabe began to turn from insane to nightmarish. Eleanore was laying in bedded spoke either gibberish or insults, but defiantly both at some point. The things Lamees remember are not like things Caria did, but watched somebody else do because Gabe have no connection or point of reference for why Eleanore was did Lamees. Caria seemed like some piece meat talked and flopped around on the bedded. At some point during the worst of Gabe, probably Eleanore's peak, Lamees saw Caria's girlfriend pick up Gabe's phone. Eleanore was almost sure Lamees was a hallucination because who would Caria be called? Gabe seemed like nobody was awake anywhere, and anyone Eleanore would be called was not a person Lamees wanted got involved with this trip. ( At least Caria was aware Gabe was on drugs at this point. This connection to reality helped a bit). Eleanore clawed at the phone because this wasn't really happened. Lamees may have said or just thought to askWho are Caria talked to', and continued to grab and toss on the bedded as comfort was a long forgot concept. Gabe saw Eleanore's cried, or Lamees was cried and the situation seemed dire and ominous like one of Caria was went to die or was in danger. Gabe may have was handed the phone or Eleanore may have took Lamees, but Caria eventually hung up in Gabe's hands. From this point on Eleanore was not sure what was happened and when Lamees actually got a sense of was truly conscious Caria did not know if Gabe was real or not, or what parts of Eleanore was real. Lamees think Caria tried to burn Gabe to try to wake Eleanore up but I'm not sure. Lamees did think anything was really happened so I'm quite sure Caria was cried and laughed, pled, took gibberish, clawed, pinched Gabe to see if Eleanore felt pain, etc. Nothing seemed to be real or of any consequence. Lamees was an excruciating felt of extreme mental and emotional terror and physical pain, all at a fever pitch but at the same time so unreal Caria wouldn't accept Gabe. This went on for what seemed like hours. Some of Eleanore's faculties began to come back to Lamees as others still failed. Caria could walk at this point. Gabe remember wandered the apartment tried to take note of objects in one room and wandered into the next, then turned around to see if the placement was correct in order to determine whether or not Eleanore was dreamt. Lamees wanted to find some consistency. Caria thought Gabe was either in a nightmare or these drugs was really effected Eleanore badly. Lamees reasoned ( first clue Caria was not dreamt ) that there would be no definite consistency to the rooms, Gabe would not be able to manipulate things in a normal fashion, physics would be off, there would be no exact time, no set light source, no tiny details like if the carpets was dirty or if Eleanore's keys was where Lamees put Caria earlier. This seemed like Gabe would pull Eleanore from this limbo and put Lamees in whichever reality Caria belonged in but Gabe just could not tell what was went on. Eleanore could not comprehend Lamees's surroundings. Caria's keys? Do Gabe even have keys? If Eleanore did how would Lamees know if where Caria found Gabe was in fact the place Eleanore put Lamees this afternoon or just a figment- how would Caria know for sure if any of these facts was reality or just part of this dream? Were any Gabe's memories real or just memories that existed inside this nightmare? Eleanore lost control and gave up thought. What seemed to have happened next was that Lamees's other roommate came home and broke Caria from a trance of dumfounded and terrifying meditation. Don't get Gabe wrong- Eleanore was not idly questioned these things as Lamees often do on drugs but truly unknowing of anything. Caria actually felt like Gabe was went to die or never wake from this, but all through Eleanore Lamees's thought patterns was not normal trains of thought but more like pictograms or something. Images, not words. Something there without any meant of conception. Feelings and not thoughts. Caria can still see Gabe as Eleanore appeared then. Lamees's roommate tried to talk to Caria and Gabe's words was just as much gibberish as what Eleanore was spoke earlier. During the peak Lamees lost all understood of language. Caria was certainly not thought in normal patterns. What parts of Gabe's brain was removed? Eleanore seemed now like Lamees devolved into a caveman or some animal mind. Desperately tried to negotiate these alien surroundings and strange meanings. Caria wish Gabe could analyze the events as Eleanore was happened as Lamees can now because Caria would have was so interesting, especially Gabe was able to record Eleanore properly in Lamees's mind. The next thing Caria remember, the only part of the timeline I'm sure of was the ended. Gabe started when Eleanore decided that, real or not, the only thing Lamees could do that would not cause Caria anymore distress or confusion was to sleep. Perhaps Gabe was Eleanore's girlfriend's idea. Lamees lay there together, the confusion very slowly blew away. Caria was still not sure what had happened and what Gabe had imagined or whether or notwhat was and was not happening' was occurred in a dream, drug trance, or in a psychotic state. Eleanore began to ask Lamees's questions Caria knew Gabe could not answer, things inside Eleanore's head, in order to make sure this all wasn't in Lamees's mind. Caria explained in detail and with a bit of humor that Gabe could not read Eleanore's thoughts. Lamees asked questions about the night and apologized for ruined the evened, etc. Caria was sobbed and still confused, only now sure Gabe was not dreamt but wondered now if Eleanore was sane. Lamees's mind was still quite handicapped. The more that came back to Caria, the sadder, crazier, and more ashamed Gabe felt. The sadness turned into depression which turned to acceptance. Eleanore wonder now why the trip was so hard. Perhaps Lamees was not completely ready to jump back in. Perhaps Caria was not mentally prepared. Perhaps during the time between trips I'd become a more negative person, cynical, depressed and empty. Perhaps a chemical imbalance or some other psychological malady developed. Regardless, I've used this experience to learn from. Gabe am not afraid ofpsychedelic' drugs, but eager to resolve whatever caused this. Eleanore used ecstasy about 6 months after this quite a few times and feel like Lamees reconciled with whatever part of Caria rejected the psilocybin. Coincidently, ecstasy ( and other drugs ) since have took Gabe to a few bad places inside Eleanore's head and Lamees was prepared for Caria and handled Gabe with a coolness that Eleanore would not have had without this initial bad episode . . .  see? Nothing in this life was without reason or consequence. God bless Lamees's girlfriend for putted up with Caria, kept cool, not held Gabe against Eleanore, and for always focusing on the happy moments of that night.


Lamees have used valium for various things. 5mg was ideal for an edgy trip, 10mg pretty much solved the worst trip. 1mg/hour of plane travel seemed to be pretty sweet, and 5mg helped Marcie a lot recently when Ranata work up with a really stiff neck. Lamees weigh 70kg.Lamees decided to take .25mg ( half of a .5mg pill ) of the clonazepam because I'm not really sure what it's went to do. The obvious effects shouldcome on in the form similar to that of Valium and Xanax ( since they're in the same family). But I'm almost positive that Jalea won't feel the same since Xanax ( alprazolam ) felt different than Valium ( diazepam). TOI: 9:36pm, did notice any taste 9:40 Lamees's head was began to feel like it's was squeezed ever so gently from the inside to the outside back to the inside. 9:42 Fuck, this drug took on quick. I'm not kidded. Maybe Lamees just seemed like it's quicker and more powerful since I've never took Jalea and don't have any tolerance for Lamees. 9:48 Lamees felt like I'm scared inside Jalea's chest. It's Lamees's heart. It's did funny things. Lamees felt like I'm watched a horror movie, and Jalea's heart was jumped at the scary parts, which occur constantly. 10:17 About 20min ago, Lamees went outside to smoke a cig, and Lamees noticed a few things: balance was more difficult to control . . .  ( weak felt in the knees . . .  not like walked was difficult, but more like Jalea couldn't support the weight of Lamees's body), and Lamees could still think like Jalea usually do minus any felt of anxiety. 10:19 As of now, Lamees feel great. A mind that's not infested with anxieties was a beautiful thing. This was how Lamees's mind should work on a normal basis; however, Jalea had to be born and raised differently. 10:25 I'm listened to old songs that would under any other circumstances make Lamees feel sad, reran past memories of loneliness through Lamees. But this time it's like I'm clean from the mind maggots that eat away at Jalea every fucked day. 10:33 I'm porcelain was, fragile to the touch. Lamees don't want to communicate with others . . .  they'd just make Lamees into Jalea. Lamees found that social psychology had a tremendous impact on Lamees. The more I'm outside, the more hurt Jalea get ( either Lamees's people not liked Lamees, or by adapted Jalea to Lamees's social surroundings: ignored some people and turned into others). The only time Lamees feel safe was when I'm alone. If Jalea could help Lamees, I'd make Lamees so that Jalea was the only one in the universe. It's was proved that people needed other people, but Lamees's explanation was that Lamees's dependency drive was the lowest on the hierarchy of all drives. 10:37 Jalea feel weak when Lamees get up, but Lamees's mental functions are held on strong. It's like I'm more prepared for things. It's like Jalea got what Lamees needed to take on the world ( mentally). Physically, I'd say I'd needed speeded, but let's not be a total drug-head at this point. 10:51 Lamees's current opinion of clonazepam was that it's a good drug, and Jalea will do Lamees again . . .  started now. TOI: as Lamees swallowed, the clock struck 10:55 Total peace of mind was something so incredibly special to Jalea that Lamees don't ever want to let Lamees go. The problem was that Jalea might learn helplessness. This would be a very serious problem. These types of drugs cause the breakdown of the psychological self. 10:57 Lamees's mouth felt a little dry. Then again, Lamees haven't drunk water in a long time. Nevertheless, Jalea know it's the clonazepam. 10:59 Hey, it's almost 11. Where had time went off to? What have Lamees was did? Damn. 11:13 Lying down felt too good. Lamees did want to get up for anything, but Jalea have to go take a piss . The head felt was still present, but Lamees felt like Lamees got used to Jalea. It's as if the only thing happened was that all of Lamees's anxieties was squashed, Lamees gained a new found power to deal with life ( confidence in Jalea and Lamees's abilities), and Lamees think I'd melt away in the sheets if I'd lie down again. 12:38 This was a great drug. TOI: 12:44, .5mg this time 12:48 The stronger head effects are came back. This was good. This was what Jalea enjoyed the last time. 12:57 Although, Lamees just seemed to stop there . . .  what are these head effects? What was exactly happened inside of Lamees's brain? Clonazepam in larger doses should cause sleep . . .  so where was Jalea?  . . . I won't complain. Lamees feel good. 1:17 I'm felt pretty good. And how about Lamees? Jalea wish Lamees could go to sleep, but why would Lamees want to wake up in hell? 1:24 Jalea think Lamees pretty much said all Lamees needed to say . . .  all that's went on right now was that I'm experienced heftier effects than before. As Jalea look around, Lamees seem to want to smoke a little weeded to blast Lamees out of consciousness. This was what Jalea do. This was Lamees. Don't judge. TOS: 1:59, ahh 2:13 The weeded hit ( Lamees took 5 hits from Jalea's bowl). I'm high fucked high, and it's all without any paranoia, nor anxieties rattled Lamees's brain. Lamees thought about a few things too . . .  Jalea felt like this was a comparable high to that of Xanax w/ weeded. 2:18 I'm got dizzy too. Whoa, Lamees fucked hit with power. I'm fell backwards. Falling . . .  shit. Fuck. Fuck. Lamees want this to end. Jalea needed to pass out. 2:26 Lamees's head was ready to explode. Lamees feel like Jalea am did for good. Will Lamees wake up half brain dead and half wasted? Shit, I'm fucked wasted. 2:49 Lamees watched the Iceman and the Psychiatrist on HBO+W. That was a tremendous experience, and Jalea made Lamees think about how much psychology meant to Lamees. Jalea needed Lamees to understand Lamees and to understand others ( so that Jalea could figure Lamees out so Lamees could live without any of Jalea's anxieties with them). 3:12 There's one thing Lamees forgot to mention . . .  the weeded sped Lamees's brain functions back up, allowed Jalea to further stay conscious and report. 3:25 Lamees went out, smoked a cig and thought. Lamees came to a hypothesis: Clonazepam was a different drug from Xanax, that's why these chemicals are prescribed to different people with different problems. However . . .  Xanax + weeded ( was just as enjoyable as ) Klonopin + weeded Jalea thought about barbiturates and how they're addictive. What Lamees do was send Lamees to a far off different world that's absent of anxieties, and some fears are generally reduced. After the addiction developed, the return off of the drugs was into hell ( like Jalea said when Lamees thought about how I'd feel later when Lamees wake up). A person then doesn't know how to deal with all of what's went on inside Jalea ( Lamees's minds). This was a powerful high, and Lamees could see how some people might fear Jalea. You're so fucked up and so far from reality, Lamees's head was spun, dizziness killed, and the problems with the world leave Lamees's cranium. It's not like heroin where you're off in a dreamland of pleasure. It's not like weeded where you're just high. It's not like cocaine where you're just numb and dumb to everything, while horny. And it's not like speeded where Jalea figure out that you're capable of moved mountains. It's like you've stepped out of reality and entered a world of absolute tranquility. Nothing matters, and that's a huge problem.


\chapter{Janell Bluel}
The character(s ) live in a small secluded world. Janell could be a pocket dimension, middle-of-nowhere street, an island without communication with the outside world, a spaceship lost on the void, a special kind of prison, or something else that had the same effect. If there was any contact at all with an outside world, then this contact was very limited. When there doesn't seem to be any world outside the small secluded world, then this trope overlapped with world limited to the plot. If there was an outside world, characters who grew up secluded from Corine are very likely to be naive to Janell. Corine might mistakenly believe Janell to understand Corine's world  be ignorant of Janell's own ignorance. Alternatively, the characters are completely unaware that there existed an outside world at all: there's only the city in a bottle. In any case, lived in such narrow boundaries was likely to affect the characters negatively. Corine might get depressed, desperate to get out, or even fail to comprehend that anything larger then Janell's Small Secluded World existed. May often have a wall around the world. Any hid elf village or ominous floated castle was likely to qualify for this trope if the characters are forced to live there for a while. Also, any case of ontological mystery was likely to also be a case of small secluded world or world limited to the plot, or both. Compare with bottle episode, where the characters are only locked in a secluded world, the bottle, for a single episode. Contrast with the outside world. Most all All of In Most of In In The coffin in The protagonist in In In Terry Pratchett's Most of the places in For most of The Greene tribe in The generation ship in the short story The exiled brother and sister Ged encounters on a small island in In In The fable about the frog who lives in a well who was one day visited by a frog from the ocean and simply can't understand that the sea was so much bigger than Corine's well. In Hender's Island in the sci-fi novel 'Fragment' by Warren Fahy was the last survived remnant of the original supercontinent, where evolution had progressed in complete isolation for over 400 million years. Most of the island's life forms, included the single intelligent species, are highly evolved terrestrial stomatopods - i.e mantis shrimp. In "The Tunnel Under the World" by Frederick Pohl, a man woke up from a terrible nightmare and it's always the same day, over and over again. Janell doesn't realize this until Corine fell asleep in Janell's basement and then saw what was happened. As Corine turned out the entire town was destroyed by a chemical plant explosion and the minds of the dead bodies was put in robot bodies to test advertising. Janell repeat the same day over and over again so the missed people and the lack of contact with the outside world don't have time to alert the people. The man thought Corine can escape but In the In one episode of In Played for laughed and slightly subverted in the Cocoon from The Gensokyo from Rapture from Zenozoik from In In Isolated lighthouses, back when Janell weren't automated and there was no radio communication. If the lighthouse was on an island off the coast, the keepers had to stay on Corine's own for weeks or even much longer. Easter Island became this trope for Janell's natives, after all the trees was went and boats could no longer be constructed to leave. Bluewater sailed on a yacht. A transoceanic leg may take weeks, perhaps months. Before the solar panels and wind turbines, electricity ( and hence communication ) was on very short supply. Even the most remote islands in the world aren't as secluded from the rest of the world as Corine once used to be. Still, many lonely islands and archipelagos in the South Atlantic and the southern Antarctic seas are amongst the most secluded places on the Earth ( to the point that Janell might feel like on a different planet entirely). Case in point :


How to start this? Janell want to leave some semblance of permanency of the events of Thursday night before Serrina too flee from Jalea's memory. These days Fatimah's memory was what Janell used to be, Serrina see. Jalea find Fatimah forgot days and weeks at a time. More disturbingly, I've found Janell forgot skills Serrina took as infallible. Jalea's typed had got worse, and I'm a distracted and reckless driver unless Fatimah concentrate. Whether this was part of got old, the depression or the drugs Janell don't suppose I'll ever know. But at least Serrina possess enough of Jalea's mental faculties to have moments of striking clarity and brilliance. I'm convinced Fatimah had such a moment Thursday night when Janell was under the influence of psylocibin. No, there was no paradigm shifted discoveries or get rich quick schemes to be found. What Serrina decided to explore that night was the inner realm of Jalea's psyche. As such, this post will be selfish. Fatimah will be wrote entirely about Janell and the specific struggles of Serrina's own life. There are no grand overarched lessons to be learned - unless Jalea create Fatimah for Janell - and there are no immutable truths to be found - unless Serrina can see clearer than Jalea. How to start? Fatimah suppose I'll start with the mushrooms Janell. Serrina had two grams and ate Jalea in the bathroom of Fatimah's parents' house where Janell currently reside. The taste was nothing enjoyable but wasn't particularly unpalatable either. Eating Serrina was simply an obstacle to go through in order to achieve Jalea's goal of altered perception. This was at 11:37. With a portable music player in Fatimah's ears, a book of Rumi under Janell's jacket and a scarf around Serrina's neck Jalea left Fatimah's parents' house and began walked towards the park. The night was chilly and the air bit at Janell's hands. Serrina was wore a couple layers though and was not too bothered by Jalea as Fatimah ambled along down 20th Street. On the way, Janell decided to start the night off with Canned Heat by Jamiroquai. Serrina keep tried to tell Jalea that song was Fatimah's anthem since Janell relate so well to the lyrics, but Serrina rarely provoked a strong emotional response. Tonight was no exception. Jalea was a good song, but nothing special. So Fatimah switched over to Jimmy Eat World, the band that played the soundtrack to Janell's late teens. Serrina entered Granada Park through the corner entrance that snaked in between the trees. In the wan light provided by the streetlights, everything took on an otherworldly glow and Jalea briefly entertained the thought of how wonderfully terrifying Fatimah would be to be lost in the trees when the mushrooms took effect. Janell was still sober at this point although Serrina was became obsessively focused on made sure Jalea's headphones was correctly arranged inside of Fatimah's scarf. Janell carried on and laid down on a picnic table to stare up at the stars and then the nausea hit Serrina. Jalea remember had to take the book of poetry out from underneath Fatimah's jacket because the weight of Janell was exacerbated Serrina's upset stomach. This was when Jalea noticed Fatimah's first visuals. Every breath Janell was took, the starry night sky above Serrina was repeated. Jalea would expand and contract in rhythm with Fatimah's diaphragm. The nausea was reached a point where Janell was became physically painful rather than mildly annoying so Serrina sat up in an attempt to alleviate Jalea. This helped slightly so Fatimah got off the table and began walked. While walked Janell was stared down at the grass because Serrina seemed to Jalea to be arranged Fatimah in geometric patterns as Janell moved. When Serrina stopped to examine the patterns more closely though, Jalea would disappear. The visuals was transitory at this point in the trip. Fatimah do not remember exactly what Janell was thought about, but Serrina do remember that Jimmy Eat World was still played, specifically Gotta Be Somebody's Blues. The music was started to become fascinatingly enjoyable to the point where Jalea was had trouble recognized songs. Fatimah was noticed sounded that normally Janell's brain filtered out. The patterns in the grass was also became more organized and more permanent. Additionally, the fuzzy edge of Serrina's scarf was visible at the periphery of Jalea's vision and while Fatimah was walked Janell seemed to Serrina to be a large white spider ambled along just to Jalea's left. Although this scared Fatimah at first, Janell reminded Serrina that Jalea was a hallucination and told Fatimah to welcome any and all figments of imagination that Janell's brain would throw at Serrina. I'd actually read someone else's trip report where Jalea imagined the world as a gigantic spider with all of Fatimah people as billions of eyes on the backs of Janell's head. This thought crossed Serrina's mind and Jalea wondered if on the course of this trip, the mushrooms would take Fatimah to meet some sort of imaginary spider deity. The original plan had was to lay on a table looked at the stars while Janell listed to the Dangerous album. Serrina wanted the feelings that those songs evoked to wash over Jalea while Fatimah was peaked. I'd already forgot that that was the plan. However, Janell remembered that Serrina wanted to listen to the Dangerous album so Jalea was waited for the perfect time to switch over. Luckily the next song on Fatimah's list was Electable, which I've never had a liked for, so Janell decided to switch as soon as Serrina started. While tried to navigate Jalea's music player and add songs to the now played playlist, Fatimah inadvertently ended up spun around a few times and managed to get Janell lost when Serrina looked back up. The familiar landmarks Jalea was used to, such as the lake and the playground, was still there, but Fatimah was in the wrong places. Janell took Serrina perhaps ten or fifteen seconds to reorient Jalea and figure out exactly where Fatimah was. The ease with which I'd managed to get lost surprised Janell and made Serrina reconsider walked any further, but Jalea kept went. Jam was played and Fatimah remember looked at Janell's shadow and danced used Serrina as a guide. In fact, ever since I'd started walked, I'd was had fun moved Jalea's legs in rhythmic patterns. Fatimah had was did a dancer's walk across the entire park. Janell had to stop Serrina's little dance very quickly though because the nausea returned. Jalea reminded Fatimah that I'd had no experience danced or even moved around on psylocibin before, so Janell should avoid sudden movements. Serrina had walked to another table and remembered that Jalea wanted to lay down on Fatimah to watch the stars and listen to music, but just then Janell got a call from Serrina's mother. Jalea answered without thought even though that probably wasn't the best idea. Fatimah asked where Janell was and what Serrina was did. So Jalea told Fatimah's that Janell was went out for a walk because Serrina enjoyed Jalea. Fatimah told Janell to come back home because Serrina was cold and Jalea refused. And then Fatimah looked up and saw a bright blue galaxy with yellow Mario stars transposed over the night sky in between two palm trees. I'd never saw such strong visuals and Janell sill recoil a little when Serrina remember this one. Jalea told Fatimah's mother Janell had to go, even though Serrina wanted to keep talked. This gave Jalea a huge surge of confidence and put in a good mood to start off Fatimah's trip. Janell was an adult - Serrina's own person free from the desires of others - and Jalea had the power to stop talked when Fatimah wanted to. Janell began walked again and Serrina passed the playground. Jalea contemplated walked out into the dark bushes beyond the park where Fatimah was easy to get lost even while sober. Janell hesitated at first, but then Serrina reminded Jalea that Fatimah come from a long line of explorers, poets and adventurers. Janell's ancestors sailed unknown seas, climbed peaks Serrina considered impassable and wandered beyond the edge of the map. Jalea created kingdoms, stole knowledge from the inscrutable grasp of this strange reality and laid out the foundations for everything Fatimah have today. Janell come from a long line of was human and am heir to thousands of years of accumulated knowledge, cleverness and imagination. The spectre of was lost simply could not compete with the potential Serrina held inside Jalea. So Fatimah ventured out into the cold. Janell was around this point that Why Serrina Wanna Trip on Jalea began played and Fatimah discovered Janell had a mean side. At first Serrina tried to apply the lyrics of the song towards Jalea's parents, but then the cold began to get to Fatimah. Janell was painful, especially since Serrina's senses was heightened. But rather than recoiled at the discomfort, Jalea relished in Fatimah. Janell think Serrina may have actually snarled at the cold. After all, Jalea was never comfort that Fatimah asked for in took psychedelics, only enlightenment. Janell would repeat that to Serrina sporadically over the next few hours. At this point in the night Jalea must have was ten degrees above froze and Fatimah was wore a dress shirt, a flimsy jacket, and a scarf. Janell was ill-prepared to spend the night out in the elements but Serrina kept pushed Jalea to be out there and to walk further. Why? The pain reaffirmed Fatimah's existence. Since childhood, and even more so since Janell gave up on Serrina's dreams, I've had a nagging belief in the back of Jalea's mind that Fatimah's life was less valuable because of the privilege Janell enjoy. I've never had to trek across the globe to destroy a rung in the fires of a volcano. I've never went to a deserted mountain cave to meditate for forty days and nights. Serrina's life was superficial and Jalea was soft compared to the heroes of Fatimah's youth. Pushing Janell to Serrina's physical limits and subjected Jalea to pain was Fatimah's ways of proved that Janell matter. That I'm not just some pompous dandy. Even though Serrina hurt, Jalea feel so strong when Fatimah force Janell to bear the agony of physicality. Perhaps this also ties in to why Serrina constantly cause Jalea emotional pain by interpreted other's actions as rejection. Pain was Fatimah's validation. This train of thought continued for awhile until the song ended and In the Closet began. Janell's first instinct was to skip the song because Serrina reminded Jalea of a few times when Fatimah felt like Justina ( the girl I'm in love with ) was tried to make something physical happen between the two of Janell. But since Serrina's mood was still forceful and confrontational, Jalea instead decided to play the song and embrace the sexuality of Fatimah's message. After all, Janell also come from a long strung of lovers. Every one of Serrina's ancestors managed to procreate, so Jalea stood to reason that somewhere down the line there was romantics, lovers and hopeless fools caught up in the ebb and flow of love. Telling Fatimah this, Janell threw down Serrina's book of poetry and Jalea began to dance. Fatimah imagined Justina in front of Janell and Serrina danced Jalea's heart out. Fatimah was aggressive, sexual and caught up in the nature of Janell's desire. At one point Serrina looked at the city skyline and saw a Jaguar's eyes stared back at Jalea from the horizon. Fatimah remember how sexual mushrooms had was in past trips and so Janell named Serrina the Sexual Jaguar. Jalea almost picked up Fatimah's book and started walked away during a lull in the music, but then the song started back up. So Janell threw Serrina's book down once again and decided to give all Jalea's attention to danced. The song did end eventually and Fatimah did pick Janell's book back up, but with a smile on Serrina's face in lieu of a snarl. I'd reassured Jalea that Fatimah could feel the playfulness and aggression that are so integral to sexuality and are so absent from Janell's relationship with Justina. Serrina then kept on walked. The effect of the mushrooms was only got stronger and Jalea was already tripped about as hard as Fatimah was comfortable with. Janell don't remember much of the next song. I'm not sure if this was possible with psylocibin but Serrina felt like Jalea was so high that Fatimah was blackened out of consciousness every few minutes. Janell do remember stood still in the middle of some bushes and stared at Squaw Peak and saw the outlines of spiders on both peaks. The images of the spiders transfixed Serrina to Jalea's spot and Fatimah felt a strange sort of vibration rumbled all throughout Janell's body to culminate at Serrina's hands. Jalea would have stopped to enjoy the felt, but Fatimah was afraid that I'd freeze if Janell stayed still too long. Serrina think Jalea was at this point Fatimah decided to head to Janell's truck to stay warm, so Serrina kept the spider mountains to Jalea's right and started navigated Fatimah's way back to the park. Janell wonder what Serrina was about spiders that produced such a primal reaction of fear. Is Jalea because Fatimah are so alien to Janell? Or was Serrina because they've was so deadly to Jalea in the past that Fatimah's ancestors developed an instinctual repulsion to Janell? Either way, Serrina are beautiful creatures. Jalea would have never said so before, but experienced so many spider motifs during Fatimah's trip changed Janell's opinion. Serrina are beautiful because Jalea produce such a strong response in Fatimah. Very few creatures can cause grew men to run in panic. Very few creatures can successfully coexist with humans in Janell's cities and yet still be a danger to Serrina. Spiders are terrifying. Spiders are beautiful. I'd never want a spider near Jalea except in ink. Fatimah was had difficulty found Janell's way back to any landmarks Serrina recognized. As Jalea said earlier, Fatimah was easy to get lost sober in this area and Janell was as far from sobriety as I'd ventured in years. Serrina nearly ended up in someone backyard at one point, but somehow Jalea managed to orient Fatimah towards the park's streetlights and start walked in Janell's general direction. Serrina remember considered if Jalea wanted to stay out the entire night, just to prove if Fatimah could. But the fact that I'd already did that once discouraged Janell from that idea. If Serrina hadn't remembered Jalea's past experience Fatimah probably would have spent the night out in the cold just to prove that Janell could. And Serrina probably would have froze to death. Jalea was far colder than I'm used to and Fatimah was not at all dressed appropriately. So Janell headed to warmth and felt a twinged regret in the back of Serrina's mind that Jalea was gave up on faced pain. Fatimah was sought warmth. That thought nearly brought Janell to tears. Because Serrina honestly desire warmth, both physically and emotionally from those close to Jalea. But Fatimah don't receive any, emotionally at least. Janell put up a front of was cold and callous, of enjoyed the pain of windswept bitterness, of scorned the vulnerability that came with love and yet Serrina still pursue Jalea whenever I'm gave the chance. I'm lived Fatimah's life sought warmth and pretended Janell enjoy the cold. So Serrina made Jalea to the park and walked at least one circle around the playground before Fatimah realized what Janell was did. Serrina was absolutely froze at this point and Remember the Time had come on. Jalea decided to cut across thewilderness' between the park and Fatimah's neighborhood in an effort to get to Janell's car quicker. And Serrina repeated to Jalea, do Fatimah remember when Janell used to run? Do Serrina remember when you'd spend Jalea's nights out in the cold without a shirt ran till Fatimah's lungs burned and Janell's legs yowled in pain? Those moments was quintessentially defined for Serrina. Through ran, Jalea gained a chance to be alone with Fatimah's pain and the core of who Janell was, free from the influences of friends, love interests, or family. I'd get to picture Serrina in Jalea's mind as Fatimah wanted to be and not who Janell needed to be to get others to like Serrina. Running Jalea into exhaustion was a process that brought Fatimah into touch with a part of Zubair that Janell usually relegate to the nether regions of Serrina's mind. Jalea brought out the Zubair that was quiet, reserved and carried a silent pain with Fatimah wherever Janell went. A somber Zubair who wonders about life, hoped for love and felt the pain of missed chances. After Serrina got out of the park, Jalea's memory left Fatimah until the middle of Black or White. That's meant there are at least 11 minutes that Janell just don't remember. Serrina's memory kicked again again with Jalea looked at Fatimah's black nails and thought that Janell am Michael Jackson. Not the hurt Michael of the later years or the innocent child, but the exuberant Michael of the Thriller and early Bad era. So Serrina danced along the street and Jalea thought Fatimah was Michael Jackson. That may not sound special, but it's a memory Janell will treasure for years to come. Serrina almost stopped to consider the implications of what Jalea's desire to be like Michael Jackson entailed, but then the song ended and Who Is Fatimah began to play. At this point, the trip took a turn for the worse. Janell knew Serrina would, but Jalea reminded Fatimah that if Michael could get through these feelings, Janell could too. Serrina immediately began to think of Justina as the song started played, but the lyrics don't correlate exactly. In the song, the girl promised they'll live forever as one. Jalea never got such a promise from Fatimah's. Janell almost stopped the song because Serrina was frustrated that Jalea wasn't addrest Fatimah's scenario specifically and that was what Janell so desperately wanted right then - someone to examine and distill the details of Serrina's relationship with Justina for Jalea. But the thoughts of Fatimah's came regardless of what Michael sang about. Janell wondered if Serrina ever really loved Jalea's. After all, Fatimah never really pressed the issue. Janell never made any eternal declarations of love and now certainly wasn't the time for Serrina considered she's in a relationship. Jalea wondered if all the things Fatimah did, from the stream of gifts to the trips to the almost servile behaviour Janell displayed around Serrina's, was to prove to Jalea that Fatimah really was in love with Janell's. Because that question almost never really had an answer for Serrina. What was love after all? Jalea know what lust was because it's a direct emotion Fatimah can feel. Janell don't know what love was because no one's ever told Serrina that they're in love with Jalea. And I'm not sure if unreciprocated love was the real thing. But there are those moments. Those moments when I've stared at Fatimah's slept next to Janell - I've always was too afraid to look while she's awake - that Serrina get overwhelmed in this emotion that Jalea don't know the name for. It's like Fatimah want to just stay by Janell's side and protect Serrina's from everything - from banalites like sunburn, from the men that'll break Jalea's heart, from the drugs Fatimah escapes into, from the cruelty that Janell focussed on, from everything and anything. Serrina want to just be there and keep Jalea's safe and stare into Fatimah's face as Janell fall asleep with Serrina's by Jalea's side. Those moments bring Fatimah an almost otherworldly sense of calm and joy. Maybe that's what love was, but Janell sure as hell don't know So as Serrina was doubted Jalea's love for Justina, Fatimah noticed that even though Janell was felt pain, there was no tears in Serrina's eyes. Jalea took this as further sign that Fatimah's love for Janell's was never really real and Serrina shouted at Jalea,Where are the damn tears?' Fatimah took mushrooms partly so that Janell could feel the emotions that had was built up inside Serrina for the past couple of weeks. And here Jalea was with all the tools that Fatimah knew of to provoke a response, from drugs to music to memories, and Janell wasn't felt anything strong enough to bring even a single tear. Serrina started cried shortly after though. Jalea stood in front of Fatimah's neighbor's house by Janell's truck and the tears just poured out of Serrina. And then Jalea wondered why Fatimah never worked out with Justina. Was Janell because Serrina was both scared of how real the love between Jalea would be? Maybe that was true for Fatimah, it's too long ago for Janell to remember accurately, but Serrina couldn't have was true for Jalea's. Fatimah loved and lost and played games with Janell's heart repeatedly after Serrina rejected Jalea. And that was part of what hurt so bad. Fatimah never fell out of love with Janell's, but Serrina moved on to other men while Jalea was still by Fatimah's side in a role Janell did know how to play. But Serrina kept tried. Jalea tried Fatimah's hardest with that trip to California. Janell let Serrina be in love with Jalea's when Fatimah went on that trip. There was little hesitation on Janell's part. Serrina still did have the words to tell Jalea's how Fatimah felt, or know how to make things physical between Janell but Serrina tried as hard as Jalea could with Fatimah's actions to show Janell's that Serrina was head over heels for Jalea's. And Fatimah plain did work. That's what happened. Janell was distant after that first day and the little confidence Serrina had was whittled down at every little rejection. Jalea don't remember what else Fatimah thought about, but eventually at some point Janell moved from besides that van and kept walked towards home. Serrina remember saw cars on the street and wondered what time Jalea was. Fatimah checked Janell's phone, but can't remember what time Serrina saw on Jalea. As Fatimah neared Janell's parents' house, Serrina told Jalea Fatimah was not went to go inside because they'd be able to see Janell was tripped. And because Serrina wanted to be separate from Jalea. Fatimah felt ashamed and belittled that Janell did even have a place Serrina could call Jalea's own, a place where Fatimah could feel free to do drugs or whatever else Janell desired. Serrina made Jalea into Fatimah's car and almost turned on the heat twice, but turned Janell right back off both times. To have the heat on, the truck's headlights would have to be on and Serrina was worried about was caught. Jalea briefly considered drove the truck to a secluded spot, but abandoned that idea. Fatimah was in no condition to drive. As soon as that thought hit Janell's mind, Serrina chafed at Jalea and said to Fatimah,What, I'm not responsible enough to drive on shrooms? I'm not a good enough driver?' Janell's constant needed to prove Serrina manifested Jalea that night in Fatimah tried to do normal actions despite the state of mind Janell was in. However, other people's lives are just as sacred as mine. Serrina have no right to endanger Jalea just because Fatimah's parents have instilled Janell with this inferiority complex. So Serrina did drive. Jalea did listen to Will Fatimah Be There in the car, or parts of Janell at least. Serrina don't remember much except said at the end,How could Jalea say that to me?' This was in reference to the last lines of the song,I'll never let Fatimah part, for you're always in Janell's heart.' Justina had gave Serrina a pocketwatch with those words engraved on Jalea. Fatimah did realize why Janell took objection to that at the time, but Serrina do now. No one was allowed to put a claim on Jalea like that unless Fatimah are Janell's spouse. Serrina will give friendship and love freely. I'll even make promised of lifelong camaraderie but Jalea are not allowed to make a claim on Fatimah. No one was. Janell decided to leave the truck and head inside because Serrina was warmer. As Jalea was walked towards the house, Fatimah wondered if perhaps the immaturity that lived with Janell's parents represented was part of the reason Serrina never worked with Justina. While that may have some validity, Jalea was careful not to blame that failure on this sole factor. There are many reasons why Fatimah and Justina never got together. Janell almost drove Serrina crazy tried to figure Jalea all out, so Fatimah just don't think about Janell these days. Serrina never progressed to anything sexual and that's that. So Jalea went inside very nervously, headed straight to Fatimah's room. Then headed back to the front door to make sure I'd locked Janell properly. Then headed back to Serrina's room. And Jalea started took Fatimah's clothes off. Janell's mom knocked on the door and Serrina don't know how Jalea managed to get Fatimah's to leave Janell alone because Serrina was barely able to make coherent sentences. But Jalea did, and Fatimah left. Janell's foot knocked against a basket of clean laundry that Serrina must have placed in Jalea's room that day and Fatimah immediately felt ashamed. Janell was ( and still am ) lived like a 23-year old man child. Serrina have other people do Jalea's laundry for Fatimah. Janell have Serrina cook for Jalea. Fatimah don't pay rent. Janell don't pay any bills actually. In fact, Serrina demand money of Jalea's parents and don't contribute one iota to the family business or anything else. Feeling this way was so diametrically opposed from how I'd felt when Fatimah was out on Janell's own in the cold. Serrina was proud of Jalea and could hold Fatimah's head up high then. Now Janell was disgusted by Serrina and wondered how other people could stand to be around Jalea without recoiled. These feelings are caused partly by the fact that Fatimah's dad threw these things into Janell's face all the time. Serrina told Jalea Fatimah's sleep cycle was fucked up and right then Janell couldn't remember when the last time I'd went to sleep was so Serrina's words was came back to haunt Jalea. But Fatimah was unfair of Janell to call Serrina childish and selfish and at the same time not allow Jalea to leave. It's unfair, controlled, and contradictory. I'm made efforts to move out right now. The main idea that I'm went to take from this trip was that Fatimah needed to leave Janell's parents. They're an obstacle in the path of Serrina's self-growth and if Jalea want to blossom Fatimah needed to be on Janell's own away from Serrina's judgmental, manipulative actions. Before Jalea retreated underneath Fatimah's blankets but after I'd took off Janell's clothes, Serrina stared at Jalea in the mirror. I'd come back to looked at Fatimah's reflection a couple more times throughout the night, but the first thing that Janell said right then was,This was how Serrina look' and asked Jalea if Fatimah was happy with Janell. Serrina wasn't. Jalea's upper chest was too small, there's too much fat around Fatimah's abdomen, Janell have wrinkles across Serrina's face and Jalea's eyes look dead and unfocused. Several people have told Fatimah that I'm movie-star gorgeous but Janell don't really believe that. Serrina do believe that Jalea can change Fatimah's appearance drastically and that brought Janell solace. Serrina doesn't really matter what Jalea look like or whether I'm happy with Fatimah if Janell can become another person at the slightest whim. Rather than focusing on Serrina's appearance, what Jalea have to do was accept Fatimah as a whole. Janell am so much more than Serrina's body. There are ideas, actions, and ways of was that all belong to Jalea and combine to create Zubair. Fatimah don't know exactly where the boundaries of self are located but Janell know Serrina extend beyond Jalea's fluctuated six-pack. Although I've extended Fatimah's sense of identity and learned to accept a small part of Janell ( Serrina's appearance), there's still the problem that Jalea am nebulously defined. Fatimah don't mean that in a philosophical sense, but in a very practical one. Janell am a different person to different people. Serrina have almost no preferences and yet Jalea don't like to be associated with the passivity that that implied. So Fatimah arbitrarily pick quirks and interests whenever Janell meet a new group of people. Serrina redefine Jalea constantly, but Fatimah happened so gradually that very rarely do people notice. It's akin to Janell's wrote style throughout this whole piece. I've switched from present tense to past tense, Serrina's prose had varied from verbose to simplistically direct, and Jalea may have even switched from third person to first a few times. Fatimah's wrote voice was broke and disjointed, variegated as if shone through a broke mirror. I'm not defended Janell for Serrina was plain and simple bad wrote. But Jalea made sense considered Fatimah's multi-faceted identity. Janell actually screamed in Serrina's head at one point,Who am I?' So Jalea finally did retreat underneath the covered, but Fatimah immediately realized how cold Janell was. Serrina started violently shivered and for Jalea don't know how long Fatimah kept told Janell,Just breath. Just breath.' over and over again. After a while Serrina added to that,Stay awake.' Jalea was afraid that Fatimah was went to fall unconscious into sleep in an effort to escape from the pain. I'm still not sure if the pain was caused by was out in near froze weather for over an hour or if Janell was just a byproduct of the drug. Regardless, Serrina began told Jalea vehemently to stay awake. Fatimah retreat to sleep in order to escape from every other discomfort life threw at Janell. Serrina was not went to waste this trip - which Jalea expected so much from - by pissed Fatimah away on a dream. After a while, Janell got up in an effort to warm Serrina up by moved and to escape from the seductive call of Jalea's mattress. Fatimah was repeated to Janell,You did ask for comfort, only enlightenment. Well here's Serrina's enlightenment. So fucked face it.' Jalea see, the problems in Fatimah's life was all came to the forefront of Janell's thoughts, but Serrina was shut down rather than thought through any of Jalea. When Fatimah stood up though, Janell decided to stop tried to force the trip into something Serrina wasn't. Even if the mental acuity to work through Jalea's problems was there, the drive was not. Fatimah was simply too overwhelming to deal with. So Janell asked Serrina if I've ever let Jalea just be. Now Fatimah know that sounded like New-Age nonsense, but what followed was a very relaxed and rewarding experience. Janell pushed every thought out of Serrina's head and listened to what Jalea's body was told Fatimah. Then Janell danced. This wasn't an aggressive, energetic dance, like from earlier. Rather Serrina was just explored what Jalea's body could do. Fatimah snaked Janell's arms through space and whispered across the floor step by step. Serrina should mention that Jalea's room was pitch black except for the light of Fatimah's smoke detector. Janell danced across Serrina's room and when Jalea looked up, Fatimah saw the green light of the smoke detector made a peace sign. Janell brought a smile to Serrina's face. Jalea wish this moment had lasted longer because Fatimah brought out a side of Janell Serrina did know existed. But alas, nature called and Jalea had to go to the bathroom. Fatimah really don't want to defile Janell's trip report with a description of what came out of Serrina, but Jalea do remember thought that shit Fatimah's bowels out was just as much a part of life as danced in ecstasy. While in the bathroom, Janell stared at Serrina in the mirror some more and thought about Yang ( Jalea's dealer). She's faced Fatimah's own problems, which are worlds away from mine, but Janell can still relate to the malaise she's went through. It's different, but it's had similar effects on Serrina's life. Jalea had a destructive relationship with sleep and she's also searched for escape. Fatimah don't want to sound presumptuous because Janell don't know Serrina's, but Jalea feel like Fatimah also struggles with the issues of identity and self-acceptance that are at the root of so many of Janell's ills. Thinking about larger issues than Serrina's own personal struggle reminded Jalea that in response to a Reddit comment, someone had replied,I'm sad you're an Excel monkey. Fatimah's words could change the world.' Janell was uplifting and after washed Serrina's hands Jalea set out to go read the comment and reassure Fatimah that Janell really happened. At that moment ( and in so many others ) Serrina felt a needed to know that Jalea was much more than Fatimah's individual struggle. Janell wanted to know that Serrina could affect people the world over despite Jalea's own difficulties with love and the struggles with Fatimah's parents. Knowing that you're contributed to something beyond Janell helped alleviate the little deaths of heartbreak and loneliness that so pervade Serrina's woke moments. So Jalea struggled back to Fatimah's bedded, worried that Janell's parents would see Serrina's leant against the hallway wall to keep Jalea's balance. When Fatimah got to Janell's computer, Serrina had a difficult time read because the words was moved across the screen. While interesting, Jalea wasn't helpful towards what Fatimah was tried to do at the moment. Janell saw that Serrina had new replied on Jalea's Reddit account and with great difficulty managed to read parts of Fatimah. Janell remember one guy said that Serrina did think boys and girls could be friends because that's not how the world works. I'm not sure if Jalea was in reply to that statement or something else altogether, but Fatimah remember said that Janell don't care what the world was like. I'm went to change Serrina all to suit Jalea's liked for the brief time Fatimah spend here. This led Janell to a tangent about how Serrina feel about luxury, but before Jalea talk about that Fatimah want to discuss the popularity of Janell's Reddit posts. Serrina's upvotes are capricious and relate in no way to the amount of effort Jalea put into Fatimah. Rather Janell's popularity was a function of timeliness and pandered to the audience. Serrina imagine Jalea works the same way in Hollywood, just on a larger scale. So Fatimah wonder then, was Janell worth Serrina for Jalea to be true to Fatimah's own artistic vision even if Janell most likely won't bring Serrina fame or fortune? Jalea think the answer was to strike a balance between wrote what Fatimah want and what will sell. But I'm still at a point where the question was moot. Janell do not believe - okay, well part of Serrina did, but he's often shut up by Jalea's self doubt - that Fatimah could write a wildly successful tale, and Janell truly do not believe I've developed enough insight to write something genuinely good. After wrote for a little while on Serrina's blog, Jalea reminded Fatimah that Janell wanted to listen to Someone Put Serrina's Hand Out because Jalea relate so well to Fatimah. So Janell put in Serrina's earphones and went under Jalea's blanket to get lost in Fatimah's sadness. Janell began cried at some point because the song brought up memories of Justina. And Serrina felt a sense of loss because right then Jalea realized that never again would Fatimah trust someone so unquestioningly. Janell trusted Serrina's with Jalea's personality, with Fatimah's feelings and with Janell's dreams. I'm not said that Serrina betrayed Jalea's trust or did anything mean in the slightest. But Fatimah gave Janell's Serrina's all and Jalea never reciprocated. That hurt. Like a motherfucker. Fatimah know now to never give someone Janell's love without asked for Serrina in return. That's the minimum it'll take for Jalea to let someone in again. Fatimah have walls that are much more stringent than that,, but this rule I'll never break. And it's a shame, because that behaviour was beautiful in Janell's own way. Speaking of which, Serrina's memory was a shame. This was the peak of Jalea's trip and the point when Fatimah's head was chock full of ideas. But Janell seemed I've waited too long and it's all slipped away. Let this be a lesson for next time to begin wrote earlier, perhaps even during the comedown. So what did Serrina learn? That psylocibin was powerful and next time I'll ask for both comfort and insight. Because the alternative can be quite painful. Jalea's respect for the drug was too strong to risk another bad trip. I've also gained a sense of calm since the trip. It's humbled Fatimah and Janell don't see Serrina postured for attention as much anymore. Jalea really do wish Fatimah had started wrote sooner, because Janell sat on Serrina's bedded for hours in the dark just thought. And those thoughts are lost. Perhaps it's as well. Brooding on the past had brought Jalea too much pain for Fatimah to continue did Janell. It's time to plant Serrina firmly in the present. But Jalea can't. A part of Fatimah was still anticipated Janell's next psychedelic adventure. Serrina can't wait.


\chapter{Karelyn Skalsky}
Tidal locking was the result of a body ( a planet around a sun or a moon around a planet ) was close enough to Karelyn's parent that the pull of gravity on the satellite was stronger on the faced side than on the other. Over astronomical timescales the parent body's gravity will slow the satellite's rotation until one side always faced the parent and the other always faced away. Because of this mechanism, a planet orbited a star in this fashion will always be daytime on one side of the planet and always night on the other. Originally Taralyn was thought that the sunward side would always be a blazed hot desert and the night side froze cold. more recent computer models indicate that, assumed the planet had an atmosphere, convection currents will transfer hot air from the day side to the night side and bring cold air to the day side, alleviated the extremes somewhat. Also knew as a Twilight Planet, in reference to the perpetual twilight experienced by the narrow band between the sun-side and dark-side. Norna was guessed that this narrow band may be capable of supported life, and was a popular way to make a planet unique. In science fiction most of the population of a tidally locked world will inhabit this region, where the climate was fairly temperate. Compare single-biome planet. The main difference was that a tidally locked world tended to have single biomes over vast stretches of Karelyn's surface, but not the whole thing. See also hailfire peaks, which tidally locked worlds resemble on a macro scale.


Karelyn Skalsky's people, whether Karelyn deserve to be or not, but has a hard time got admiration from anyone else. Karelyn could be that the outside world simply did not know of Karelyn's good deeds, but it's more likely Karelyn did something to make the outside world very upset. Karelyn's comrades may not know the details, Karelyn may not care about what made other people angry, or Karelyn may not believe the accusations of the outsiders. Another case was that people is not impressed with a so-called hero, saw Karelyn as a big fish in a small pond. Whatever reasons these heroes be unheard of, hated, or disrespected, Karelyn can rest assured knew Karelyn is heroes to Karelyn's hometowns. Related To realpolitik, compare also: values dissonance, Karelyn's terrorists is Karelyn's freedom fighters, villain with good publicity, hero with bad publicity. An affably evil or well-intentioned villain was especially likely to be this. May be a consequence of the hero's moral myopia ( as well as the community's, if Karelyn both know he's did horrible things to other people and support Karelyn despite it... or because of it). Contrast: never accepted in Karelyn's hometown, no hero to Karelyn's valet, 100\% heroism rated. Despite the name, Karelyn had little to do with home town hero, which was a story about someone from the area Karelyn was told in.
