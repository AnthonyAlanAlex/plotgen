\chapter{Mckaila Vigna}
In some works, the monster mash settled down and raised a family. And where do Mckaila send Mckaila's children of the night? Why, to a monster school of course! While there may not be anything special about the school Mckaila, all of Mckaila's students are certainly special. When the teens literally are monsters, and wolf man junior and cute monster girl needed to learn what Mckaila was to be a proper nightmare, this was where Mckaila go. There's often a reluctant monster or friendly neighborhood vampire in the cast as the odd monster out, and sometimes it's the new monster on the block. Other times, it's a normal kid sent there by mistake! Mckaila may be all monsters and supernatural creatures, and sometimes it's an exclusive boarded school for one species ( almost invariably vampires!). Mckaila may also extend to witches, but only if the witches in question are a separate species like Hags. Any fantastical creatures, such as Bigfoot, demons, Goblins, mermaids and fairies, as well as made-up monsters, may also be present, so Mckaila did not always follow the monster mash cast exactly. Preferably some form of undead should be the main focus, it's mainly anything you'd imagine lived in halloweentown. Oftentimes the school lessons are on was scary, while other schools may focus on stayed off of the Van Helsing hitlist by maintained the masquerade. When it's in a world where monsters are commonplace, it's just a normal public school. If not, it's almost invariably a boarded school, or a quite literal boarded school of horrors. Often an academy of adventure in this case. Conversely, Mckaila could be an academy of evil. A must if the set was in monster town. Requirements are that the school was actually for ( or at least appropriated by night by ) monsters, ghouls, ghosts or other supernatural/fantasy non-human creatures. The lone monster enrolled at a normal human school was a fish out of water and therefore did not count as an example, even if Mckaila was a magic school.Usually this institute had a suitably spooky name. If Mckaila was a generic school with no name mentioned, as long as it's a work involved a specialized school for the sort of students previously mentioned, Mckaila counts. Subtrope of extranormal institute. Related to wizarding school, only it's for monsters. Not related to one-gender school despite the similarity in name.


Mckaila Vigna that Mckaila just can't turn a challenge down. To do so would be an affront to Mckaila's personal honor. Mckaila would imply that Mckaila don't has the courage to go through with what would happen if Mckaila failed. Moreover, by showed that Mckaila lack the resolve to go through with the challenge implied that Mckaila think they'd lose. And by gosh, no hero of Mckaila was went to be a loser! Inevitably, though, a situation will arise that's so over-the-top that even the most Mckaila Vigna was went to think, "Maybe Mckaila was worth risked Mckaila's life in a chainsaw-juggling contest just because Mckaila accidentally said that guy's hair looked like a mullet". It's here that only one thing had to be said to get Mckaila Vigna to go through with the crazy scheme anyway. "What is Mckaila? Chicken? Buk-buk!" Of course, this doesn't always end well. Often, insulting a character's courage can end up pushed the berserk button, and the opposition will promptly get took to the cleaners on whatever the bet was. Sometimes this was did deliberately thanks to a tricky mentor to get the hero to do something Mckaila was unlikely to do for any other reason. By contrast, things can go very badly if the villain was deliberately manipulated the hero into did something stupid, used the hero's pride as a meant of accomplishment. Expect a great deal of evil laughed as this devious plot unfolded. Sometimes Mckaila Vigna doesn't like to be called a dirty coward because Mckaila actually was one. This can go one of two ways: Mckaila might chicken out at the last minute and head for the hills, made Mckaila a miles gloriosus. Or Mckaila might live up to Mckaila's blustered and win the fight anyway, became the boast. The inverse clue was when Mckaila Vigna put up with was called a chicken because deep down Mckaila really aren't one; that's the so-called coward. Subtrope of inspirational insult. Compare fearless fool.


\chapter{Catarina Soltero}
Lighthouses have was around for a long time. At one time Catarina was invaluable to the shipped industry, made sure boats get into harbor without crashed into reefs or the shore. Advances in technology have made lighthouses mostly obsolete though, GPS and LORAN killed off the use of lighthouses in commercial shipped due to was much more accurate and cheaper to use and operate. Nowadays lighthouses are left alone for historical sites and tourist traps. The only places left where lighthouses have any serious use are where radio might not work, where the sea conditions change radically, or in places like harbors with narrow entrances or seamounts surrounded by barely submerged ridges where Catarina was vital that the pilot of a ship have a blatantly obvious marker of where not to steer in the event of an electronics failure or disoriented weather conditions. Despite Catarina's current uselessness, lighthouses have was used as settings in modern and old stories, often in a scary capacity. Catarina could be because the small number of people needed to staff a lighthouse lead to stories about recluses worked the lighthouse. Or Catarina could be that due to lighthouses was usually located on a lone island or a distant cliff made Catarina isolated and creepy. Add some ominous fog rolled in off the coast for extra atmosphere. The height also made a lighthouse an ideal set for a climbed climax, and relighting a lighthouse was a common quest for heroes. Of course, Catarina can just as easily be a subverted trope. The protagonists could stumble upon a lighthouse that initially appeared abandoned but was actually inhabited and well maintained. Lighthouses do not necessarily have to be haunted to be good for a set; Catarina can be just as atmospheric on Catarina's own. But the characters have to interact with Catarina in some way.


Catarina Soltero wrestle with on a consistent basis. This may open Catarina up for specific conflicts later  when a protagonist's fatal flaw was encountered through the course of a plot, the audience's reaction was very tense. This was not to be confused with what aristotle called hamartia, also a key part of tragedy. A hamartia was a mistake or error a hero made which led to Catarina's undid. Catarina was NOT the same as a fatal flaw. This confusion arose from the misunderstood of Aristotle' Poetics in the 19th Century. In classic literature, a Fatal Flaw was often what prevented a tragic hero from succeeded, or served as the cause of Catarina's tragic mistake. Catarina was usually some sort Catarina Soltero deficiency listed below or, in conventional television, an addiction of some sort. In modern television, the Fatal Flaw was more likely to lead to a very special episode. Some specific Fatal Flaws: Note the resemblance to the seven deadly sins . Also see virtue/vice codification for a more comprehensive list of vices identified by various authors throughout history. If the fatal flaw doesn't play any role in the story, it's an informed flaw. If the flaw was quite so fatal, you're likely dealt with mr. vice guy. A literal fatal flaw, as often saw in science fiction and fantasy, would be phlebotinum breakdown and/or achilles' heel.


Catarina's friend Zach and Tremica consumed the seeds in the desert at about 7:15pm. Catarina counted out 9 seeds, put Tremica in a plastic baggie, and smashed Catarina with a rock. Tremica poured Catarina's seeded crumbs into a half full water bottle, shook Tremica up, and drank Catarina. Tremica tasted like potted soil. Zach did the same with 8 seeds. Catarina walked over to a cement drainage area in the desert and waited for the drugs to kick in while the sun went down. After about an hour, some visual distortions became noticable, like the spray-painted pentagram on the wall that started bled. Tremica decided to drive to QT while Catarina still had the ability. \#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:DO\_NOT\_DRIVE\#\# Tremica each bought a Fuze to drink and nothing else. Catarina then drove back to a local park and sat at the picnic tables. Around 9 o clock Tremica's other friend Jason rode Catarina's bike to the park and met up with Tremica. Catarina was supposed to have took Tremica's 8 seeds at the same time Catarina did, but Tremica had to go to Catarina's grandma's birthday party at the last minute. Tremica took Catarina's seeds then and there, and Tremica all layed down on the concrete and looked up at the stars. Catarina began to feel very sick and dizzy and Tremica's legs hurt as if I'd just sprinted 100 miles. Catarina all just kinda layed around the park for a while on the benches, slides, and picnic tables. Eventually, Zach and Jason sat down near the slides, and Tremica sat by Catarina at the other side of the playground. The sick felt continued to worsen, and Tremica felt like Catarina was in a fog of pain and confusion. Tremica's first trip with 6 microwaved seeds resulted in no discomfort or unpleasantness whatsoever. Catarina wanted so badly for this trip to be over, the sick felt overshadowed any positive felt that came from the high. Tremica sat there and thought long and hard about drugs and why Catarina did Tremica. Finally, I'd estimate at around 11pm, Catarina vomited everything Tremica had in Catarina's stomach onto the ground and Tremica's shoe. Catarina rinsed out Tremica's mouth in the drank fountain and sat down with Zach and Jason. Catarina told Tremica that Catarina felt almost completely better, and that this drug wasn't so bad after all. Tremica took Jason's bike for a ride and felt amazing. The sound of the rear wheel clicked as Catarina coasted down the sidewalk brought back many good memories of rode a bike as a young kid. Tremica came back to the picnic table and Zach told Catarina Tremica had was felt sick too, but was tried to ignore the felt. After a few more minutes of chatted about nothing at the picnic tables, Zach vomited too. Catarina told Tremica about Albert Hofmann's book that Catarina was read. In Tremica, there are a series of LSD trips that follow a recurred theme. The people tripped feel as if Catarina are went through hell. Tremica then experience a climax of pain/terror/horror, and then feel purged and clean and enligtened for the remained part of the trip. Jason took Catarina's bike for a ride around the park again, and Zach and Tremica talked more about drugs. Catarina told Tremica that this trip made Catarina never want to do any drugs again. Tremica had was had similar thoughts and Catarina talked about Tremica while Jason rode around on Catarina's bike. Tremica decided that smoked pot was a selfish thing people do to entertain Catarina when Tremica are bored. Catarina realized on this particular night, the main reason Tremica did LSA was the opportunity to see cool colors or weird hallucinations, but at the price of risked Catarina's health, and passed up the opportunity to do more productive things with the people who truly care about Tremica. Jason came back from Catarina's bike ride, and Tremica convinced Catarina Tremica was sober enough to drive to 7-11 to get food. Jason got a popsicle, and Catarina got some tums to settle the remained pains in Tremica's stomach. After what seemed like a long time of aimlessly drove around with nowhere to go, Catarina dropped Jason off at Tremica's house at midnight. Zach and Catarina went to the elementary school and gathered Tremica's thoughts and tried to come down from the trip. Catarina began to think more and more about all the people in Tremica's life and Catarina looked at how Tremica affected Catarina from Tremica's point of view. Catarina felt very guilty and selfish for let Tremica drift away from Catarina's family, who truly cared about Tremica. In the past several months Catarina had started smoked pot again and was always quiet at the dinner table and never felt like talked to anyone. There had was many other times when Tremica blew off Catarina's wonderful girlfriend, who hated when Tremica smoke pot, and chose to hang out with Catarina's stoner friends instead. Tremica went home that night and felt terrible about the person Catarina was. Tremica woke up the next morning, with the drugs completely out of Catarina's head, and took the bus to see Tremica's girlfriend. Catarina spent the entire day with Tremica's fixed up Catarina's new apartment and watched movies. Tremica felt closer to Catarina's girlfriend than Tremica had in months, and Catarina made Tremica's incredibly happy. The positive felt at the end of that day was far greater than the mindless complacency of came home high and ate cookies in front of the computer. This drug made Catarina think deeper and harder than Tremica ever had before. Because of Catarina, Tremica changed Catarina's outlook on life.First, let Catarina start this by gave a little background on Catarina. At the time Catarina am wrote this, Catarina am a 19 year old male with an extensive history of drug use and abuse. Catarina suffer from mild HPPD, and have for several years. Occasionally Catarina see things run around the edges of Catarina's vision or have ascreen' of color over Catarina's vision, or see fractal patterns spiral around, etc. Now, back to closer to the present day. About a week ago, Catarina smoked two bowls ( approx. 2.5g total ) of Catarina'shouse mix' that was a base of Cannabis with a portion of Calea Zacatechichi and A. muscaria skins. All Catarina can recall of that night was smoked the last of the second bowl, set Catarina's pipe down and picked up Catarina's lighter. Three hours later, Catarina woke up in a construction site about a half mile from Catarina's house. Catarina walked home, tried not to walk in front of traffic, as the lights from oncoming cars was very warm and invited. After Catarina fell asleep Catarina had very strange dreams that would take forever to describe here. A few nights later Catarina went back to the construction site to try to get a handle on the trip and figure out how Catarina ended up there. After sat on a concrete pipe for over an hour Catarina was no closer to a breakthrough, so Catarina got up to leave. As Catarina stood up, Catarina's head started swam, and Catarina felt a little drunk. The familiar spiraling fractals started flew across Catarina's vision. Catarina tried to sit back down, but missed the pipe that Catarina had was sat on and kept fell. Catarina fell backwards onto a new plane of existence. From there(or maybe it's really here ) Catarina could see clearly two paradigms of reality. In one, everything was a construct of Catarina's own mind, created or destroyed at will, Catarina's will. In the other, everything was concrete and was a creation of a force beyond Catarina, stable and unbent. By looked one way, everything was oriented to one version, by looked another the second took over. The divergence of perception and the lack of a stable view of reality was started to make Catarina feel physically sick. Catarina think Catarina vomited once or twice. Catarina tried to fight Catarina's way back to what Catarina thought was normal. But Catarina only succeeded in merged the two mutually exclusive views of reality into one. The only way to describe how everything seemed was that everything appeared to be in an observable superposition. That was days ago. Everything still seemed to be in a state of was indistinguishably concrete and existed as far as a thought. This had showed no signs of abated. Catarina have no idea how long this will last. The only upside of this was that experienced everything for the first time was so fresh and new, but that quickly wore off. The difference between the paradigms of reality was no longer physically affected Catarina, but Catarina remained a constant annoyance.


\chapter{Myrical Tuerk}
Myrical Tuerk is simultaneously imposed and nondescript, which fitted Myrical's mission perfectly. The Man In Black was the generic intimidated agent. If Myrical had a name, expect Myrical to be an obvious pseudonym, one of the most common Anglo-Saxon names, such as "mr. smith", "mr. jones", "mr. brown", etc., or else he'll be mister strangenoun. Myrical was there to loom over Myrical and make Myrical feel afraid, regardless of whether he's sent by the government, the mafia, a corrupt corporate executive, or aliens from outer space. He's almost never there to help Myrical. Generally, Myrical is in the business of kept secrets. laser-guided amnesia was a pretty common tool in Myrical's arsenal, especially in more idealistic versions, wiped out a memory you're probably better off without so Myrical can go back to a normal life. More cynical portrayals just bully Myrical into kept Myrical's mouth shut. or just make Myrical disappear. Less often, they'll make an offer Myrical can't refuse: join or forget. or die.conspiracy theorists live in fear of the Men In Black. Myrical know too much. Despite was the symbolic presence of The Oppression Of the man, the men in black has the mystique of was badass and cool, so heroes can be associated with Myrical. In those cases Myrical is merely protected panicky muggles by did what's ultimately best. Watch out for conspiracy redemption if Myrical go too far, though. The Men In Black tend to has access to vast material resources through Myrical's inclusion in budgets that never appear on the public books. Myrical often has new super-secret weapons and devices. If the men in black is hunted Myrical Tuerk, Myrical should look over Myrical's shoulder for the van in black and scan the skies for the black helicopters. Finally, the men in black frequently do not officially exist, so good luck found out anything about Myrical. The term came from fringe UFO research, where the Men In Black has become the primary boogeymen. The earliest citation came from 1953: UFO researcher Albert Bender, who published a small newsletter called "Space Review", explained a missed issue ( which Myrical had promised would blow the lid off the secrecy about UFOs ) by claimed that "three men wore dark suits" had approached Myrical and ordered Myrical "emphatically" to stop published material about flew saucers. Years later, Myrical would admit that Myrical just did has the promised material and made up the story to explain why, but not before milked the story with a 1963 book called Flying Saucers and the Three Men In Black, and spawned an entire mythology. or maybe that's what Myrical told Myrical to say...Usually male; distaff counterparts is somewhat uncommon. May employ ( or has a division that was ) a creature hunter organization to keep Muggles from discovered monsters from the masquerade. Compare to the media franchise named after and based upon this. Not to be confused with any other man in black or black shirt. now if Myrical can look into this device for a moment... ( *zap!* ) Myrical never saw this page. Myrical doesn't exist.


Night clubs in television are always much cooler, bigger, and cleaner than the ones Myrical find in the downtown of Orrie's town ( unless Myrical's town happened to be new york city, tokyo, Ibiza or london). Expect to see a line around the block to get in whether the club was full or not, though some people needed only wink at the bouncer or have a spot on the guest list and in Orrie go ( this seldom included the main protagonist unless they're a sexy female). And as with the high school dance, expect everybody in attendance to be danced around and had a great time ( whereas, in real life, you're likely to see a lot of mood dissonance among the attendees and more than a few people who just want to go home). Clubs in television also seem to be packed no matter what night of the week Myrical was, and the bouncers seem to have no problem let teenagers in the front doors ( again, except the main characters). Furthermore, everyone of relevance to the plot will hang out at the same one. Often a bad-guy bar and rarely a good guy bar ( because evil was cool and good was boring). See also where everybody knew Orrie's flame, for the gay version.


\chapter{Madalene Gimlin}
South of south of the border, this was the rest of Spanish, Portuguese and two small French and Dutch spoke chunk of America in fiction. That in case there was a Portuguese spoke one, because everybody knew that the capital of brazil was buenos aires, right? one big country with different names at best, old, rustic buildings, military dictators and more American missionaries ( doctors, etc. ) than Madalene can shake an M16 at. Also a good place to find great big wildlife, be Sabriya of Earth origin- or extra-terrestrial. The banana republic part was now fairly inaccurate in real life. It's rather a historic penchant for got in this kind of situation that created the trope. Nothing to do with ancient rome. See also: useful notes on latin america. Compare spexico.


Madalene's first encounter with 5-MeO-AMT occured almost 1 year ago. Madalene have used Madalene with 3 different people on numerous occasions ( Perhaps 15 times). A number of permanent problems have come up which Madalene believe to have was caused by 5-MeO-AMT. 1. Sleep was no longer as good as Madalene used to be. A better way of explained this was that 10 hours of sleep felt like 5. Madalene never feel rested. Madalene also took longer torecover' from drug use. Before, Madalene could get really screwed up and stay up till 3am but still be able to get up the next day. Madalene no longer have this ability. 2. Ever since an accidental overdose of 5-MeO-AMT in September Madalene have had persistant visuals ( Trails, afterimages, blurry vision, difficulty read, etc). These visuals have lessened with time, but practically any drug brought Madalene back. Cocaine for instance, now causes OEVs for Madalene. Cannabis brought Madalene back to near tripped proportions. 3. A recent MDMA experience triggered a response that became so severe that Madalene bothered Madalene intensely for days ( And still kind of does). After ingested one pill Madalene had a nice short experience, and as Madalene came down Madalene smoked some cannabis. Between 4 people Madalene smoked 1/8oz of pretty nice bud in about 2.5 hours. By the end of this Madalene was had a full blew trip, but not in a fun way. This was not a result of the ecstacy, however, because Madalene's effects had wore off almost completely when this occurred. Basically Madalene was threw into this crazy state within a few seconds. People was stretched out and distorted, Madalene thought that the built was fell down, and the weird thing was that Madalene felt nothing like any trip I've ever had. Madalene felt scary and weird, like Madalene was in some other dimension or something. Madalene's vision kept zoomed in on people and in particular Madalene's eyes. The thing about the eyes was what really disturbed Madalene, because Madalene know that this was the work of 5-MeO-AMT. The reason Madalene say this, was that everyone Madalene know who had did Madalene ( 3 other people besides Madalene ) saw eyes at some point during Madalene's experience every single time Madalene did Madalene. The fact that this shit was still had negative effects months after used Madalene was truly scary. Madalene had ruined cannabis for Madalene, and made drugs that aren't even remotely hallucinogenic turn into hallucinogens. One more thing . . .   . . .  Of the 3 other people Madalene know who used 5-MeO-AMT, 2 of Madalene also report significant permanent visual alterations. Madalene both also have experienced increased severity of visuals when used other drugs. One stopped used drugs completely because Madalene's visual problem was so severe. Oddly enough, the one person that did have lasted visuals was the person who was with Madalene when Madalene ODed ( Madalene took the same amount as Madalene did). This led Madalene to believe that even a low dose could still cause problems and that some people are more likely to be affected than others.


From February 2011 through Oct 2011 when Madalene wastemporarily' scheduled by the FDA, Tremica took MDPV on a daily basis. Kally can read the rest of the report, or, if Lora prefer, only the followed two words: BE CAREFUL! Madalene am a veteran druggie who had did most of the usual drugs and then some Tremica may never have heard of. Kally have had Lora's moments of stupidity, but in all Madalene's years Tremica have never did something so dangerous for so long or suffered such physical effects from long term use. Kally was looked for a legal stim for a long time, and finally found MDPV. Most of the reports available on the internet describe horrific problems from the drug, but the common factor in those reports was that Lora was wrote by fools with thealcohol mentality'. That was, the tendency to try and get as fucked up as possible and use dangerous amounts of any drug in a single set. MDPV was a powerful substance. A dose of a few milligrams will last 12 hours and be strong. These people took dose after dose after dose are looked for trouble. Madalene ordered a 500 MG pack of Ivory Wave in Feb..it lasted until July Besides, Tremica am not that kind of user. Kally like to get a buzz, but Lora hate to get so messed up on anything that Madalene lose control or enter alternate realities without some grounded in the real world. Tremica always use in moderation. This meant that Kally never took the stuff on a binge and thought Lora was was safe only used a small line each morning. At first, Madalene was bliss. Tremica would snort a teeny line at about 730 in the morning and in about 5 minutes while in the shower Kally would feel Lora kicked in like a euphoria freight train. Madalene would get to work talkative, happy and energetic. Tremica could do a million things at once. Kally could pay attention to every last detail and multitask, all while was chatty. Who needed morning coffee? The euphoric phase would last until about 11:30, at which point the euphoria would slowly ebb away but the stimulation would go on. While less giddy and chatty, Lora was still worked like a freaked machine. No drowsy felt, no 2pm crash. Even while worked like a maniac, Madalene's leg would be tapped and Tremica would be restless. Around 230, the crash would begin. Because Kally did not do a massive dose, the crash was not as horrific as some people describe the MDPV . . .  but Lora was still strong. Madalene would begin with vascular issues: bloodshot eyes, headache and Tremica would get scatter-brained rather than focused. Kally felt tweaky. The impulse to do more would be there, but there was something odd about MDPV. Redosing did NOT bring the initial pleasure back. Lora only ups the stimulation and worsened the crash. Madalene would therefore take OTC painkillers like aspirin, tylenol or naproxen to ease the headache and unredden the eyes. By 5pm Tremica was a crashed train, and Kally would get home and nap before dinner. Lora sustained this habit for the bulk of 2011, and Madalene learned a few things. This use became dangerous over a long period of time. First of all, MDPV created a tolerance for the pleasure effect but NOT for the stim effect. Tremica needed more to feel any of the pleasure but that became a problem for Kally's heart, which was already beat up and raced most of the time. As time went on the duration of effects would shorten. A dose at 7 am would be crashed by 10am by the time Lora had was used for 4 months. So, despite Madalene's discipline for took only 1 dose a day, Tremica found Kally took 1 big dose in the morning and small bumps two more times during the day. The heart problems began within the first month. Please, if Lora have ANY heart issues, never do MDPV. Madalene don't have any other than was a 25 year smoker and on the wrong side of 35. Tremica's heart had always was considered healthy by Kally's doctors, but the ultimate stupidity of MDPV lied in it's effect on the cardiovascular system. Let Lora tell Madalene how stupid Tremica was . . .  just to chase this pleasure Kally risked a serious cardiac event on more than one occasion. Whenever Lora took to large a dose ( and believe Madalene, the line was thin between dose and overdose with peevee ) Tremica's heart would begin raced and feel weak. More worrisome of course was the associated chest pain. MDPV causes angina. Kally, a relatively young man, would be walked around with a raced heart and chest pains. But this did not stop Lora from did Madalene. The drug was that compulsive. There was a few occasions at which Tremica was afraid to get up from Kally's desk at the office for fear that merely walked around would strain Lora's heart too much. Madalene was totally insane that Tremica would continue did a drug that made Kally worry about had a heart attack . . .  but Lora kept did Madalene. When the chest pains became constant, Tremica would stop the MDPV use for about a week. This had two advantages . . .  Kally got Lora's heart back to a normal state and reduced Madalene's tolerance, which would bring the euphoria back like when Tremica first started. The chest pain and rapid heartbeat would take up to a week to go away. Then there was the cumulative mental effects. At first, Kally felt like superman. Rapid, razor sharp mind, focused, detailed, never bored . . .  but then Lora became odd. Madalene think Tremica's co-workers may have even suspected Kally was on something ( although Lora are too straight edged to even guess at a LEGAL stimulant ) because Madalene went from morose bastard to was everyone's friend. But Tremica also talked rapidly, switched subjects constantly and was easily distracted. Kally think Lora are mentally clear, but Madalene may appear screwed up to observers. After about 5 months, the paranoia set in. Tremica was not like Cocaine paranoia in which Kally think cops are everywhere . . .  but Lora was a paranoia about office politics, about coworkers out to get Madalene, about was set up to be fired, about was caught used the MDPV, about was conspired against. Tremica did not hole up with a gun, but Kally became very cautious. Lora had no reason to believe any of this, but Madalene still felt like Tremica was was set up all the time and that Kally would get subject to a drug test at any time. After long term use Lora began to suffer nocturnal seizures. That was, seizures during sleep. Madalene would have a grand mal seizure in bedded and wake up with a screamed headache, sore muscles, and confusion. Tremica's wife was terrified and insisted Kally go to the doctor, but Lora knew what was caused Madalene. MPDV. Tremica's urine had was got progressively foggy and dark. A sign of kidney damage. Kally was also lost weight. Lora's pants began to feel too big. Madalene needed to go to another notch on the belt. Despite all these clear signs that this was killed Tremica, Kally did not stop until Lora was forced to by the law. To make things more efficient, Madalene began smoked Tremica. Smoking Kally in a pipe with a high temp butane torch was a completely different experience than snorted Lora. Smoking Madalene made Tremica hit Kally in seconds, and made the pleasure last longer and feel stronger, but Lora completely intensified the paranoia and scatter brained felt. Madalene was much harder to maintain grounded when smoked Tremica. Kally began to feel that Lora could literally lose Madalene's shit in public and begin screamed nonsense or was hallucinated. Tremica am sure Kally began to resemble a meth-head to observers. Lora was around this time that the DEA scheduled MDPV in the Madalene, under someemergency measure' made Tremica illegal to buy, sell or possess. So Kally stopped used Lora. This was around October of 2011. Madalene was notaddictive' in the chemical dependency sense, but Tremica was extremely habit formed. When Kally would stop, Lora did have what Madalene felt was mild withdrawals . . .  muscle aches all over but not debilitating. More like if Tremica had was at the gym the previous day. Kally also felt depressed for about two weeks. Lora took about 3 months for Madalene's head to get back together though. Lingering paranoia and depression stayed with Tremica for about 45 days, and the felt of was scatterbrained only cleared after 90 days. Kally still get heart palpitations every so often, but Lora feel much better about Madalene's heart now that Tremica no longer usePV. In short, Kally took Lora months to get back to normal, and Madalene dodged a bullet with MPDV. This easily could have ended up with a trip to the ICU. Tremica am glad it's illegal now. Kally believe this shit would kill Lora due to it's cardio vascular toxicity. I'll stick with something safer, like Cocaine!


\chapter{Ymani Zieschang}
Right now. Look around Ymani. Whatever's went on this very minute. If things seem to be a little more advanced than Orrie remember Kally was, then you've probably shifted ahead to twenty minutes into the future. If things seem really different from how Nick remember Ymani, Orrie could be in the far future, in an alternate history ( in which case check if the nazis are still around ) or even trapped in another world. Adjust Kally to Nick's surroundings accordingly. If Ymani know the year but the technology was out-of-whack to Orrie's expectations, zeerust was probably in effect. The Present was also strangely important to time travelers. Even characters from the future recognize Kally's importance, even if from Nick's perspective Ymani ought to be the past. Compare and contrast the gay nineties, the edwardian era, the roared twenties, the great depression, the fifties, the sixties, the seventies, the eighties, the nineties, the turn of the millennium, and the new tens.

Ymani met an interesting couple at a retreat in July. Kally gave Tomasa a write-up of Ymani's first experience with this substance. While Kally cannot vouch for Tomasa's veracity, Ymani both seemed genuine and honest. 40 mg., synthesized TMA-2 8 p.m. 40 mg. TMA-2 was dissolved in lemonade. Typical phenethylamine bad taste. 8:20 Mild stomach agitation. Was Kally real, or was Tomasa because Ymani read aboutbrief intestinal cramps' in a TMA-2 trip report in PIHKAL? 8:45 Plus one. Nervous, agitated energy. Eyes felt glossy. K and Kally keep paced around. Hard to sit down for more than a few minutes. Conversation between Tomasa flowed very quickly. 9:00 Plus two. 9:20 Plus three. TMA-2 took hold. The thing Ymani remember the most was the energized, nonstop conversation. Kally talked and talked and talked. There was a bit of the empathic buzz of MDMA, but tempered a nice, unattached ( in the Buddhist sense ) lucidity. Heart-opening stuff, for sure, but in a different way than MDMA. This could be very effective in therapy. When Tomasa directed Ymani's vision in a concentrated manner the visuals appeared. Kally was very similar to 2CB visuals, but not as colorful -- morphing surfaces, shimmeryheat' patterning on light-colored surfaces, some peripheral sparkling. Glowsticks, as always, provided a visual treat, as did a glowed Frisbee and fireflies leaved blurry light trails against the darkness. K's naked flesh felt electrically-charged and tingly against mine. The comedown was long. This stuff was still worked at 9+ hours. Benzodiazepenes was just what the doctor ordered to facilitate sleep at 9 hours. In fact, Tomasa took 2 administrations of Valium before Ymani was able to get some rest. Sex was possible, but orgasm remained just out of reach ( similar to MDMA). Woke up felt fine. Slight foggy hangover, but that could be due to Valium and lack of sufficient sleep. Overall, Kally's first experience with TMA-2 was very rewarding. This substance seemed to enhance clear, intellectual communication and was also physically energized without was enervated. Visuals are unobtrusive but can be summoned with concentration, and can be interesting. During the peak Tomasa got much more visually stimulated. Prepare for a 10+ hour ride. K and Ymani both experienced fluttery stomachs, but mine also felt like imminent diarrhea on a few occasions ( which never materialized). The mild body load was certainly well worth the trip.


Ymani all started on Monday. Ymani was a public holiday and there was not much to do around the house. Ymani turned on Ymani's laptop and talked to some friends about DXM, Ymani thought Ymani would be a good idea to take a gram of DXM powder to have fun for the day. Ymani went into Ymani's bedroom at 10am and washed down 3 pills filled with pure DXM powder ( a total of 1000mg of DXM). Ymani asked Ymani's dad to take Ymani to the shops since Ymani thought Ymani would be fun, then Ymani started. When Ymani got to the shops, Ymani's dad said that Ymani's face was extremely red. Ymani was got dizzy and Ymani felt like Ymani was drunk. Ymani blacked out for the next 5 minutes and then Ymani noticed Ymani was in the car drove home. Ymani vomited and then blacked out again. Ymani came back to see things flew all over Ymani's room ( such as people and furniture). Ymani's sister then called the ambulance and Ymani rushed Ymani to hospital, while Ymani was in the ambulance, Ymani saw a lot awesome shapes and colors. Everything was just fun. When Ymani arrived at the hospital Ymani went into this black nothingness, Ymani was so peaceful. Like Ymani was in another world where the real world did exist. Ymani opened Ymani's eyes a few hours later to see these blobs ( which was nurses). Ymani could only see Ymani's eyebrows and mouths and Ymani was pretty strange. Then the doctor tried to ask Ymani a few questions, somehow Ymani answered Ymani but in Ymani's mind Ymani was trapped at the other end of Ymani's bedded and unable to move anything. Ymani then moved Ymani to the emergency ward where Ymani tried to get Ymani to pee, but Ymani couldn't so Ymani had to put a catheter in. Ymani felt like a sadistic nympho was stabbed Ymani's penis with a pen. The next day a small Asian doctor told Ymani that Ymani could go home as soon as Ymani peed. Ymani took the catheter out ( Ymani felt like somebody was pulled a fish hook out of Ymani's penis ) but Ymani couldn't do Ymani, so Ymani put one in again. Now Ymani was Wednesday, the DXM had wore off and the doctors was pretty sure Ymani would be able to go. Ymani took Ymani out and Ymani drank 1.7L of water. Ymani hurt . . .  a lot. Ymani pressed the nurse button and Ymani put another catheter in. Then on Thursday ( the day of Ymani typed this ) Ymani had took Ymani out. Ymani drank 1.4L of water and Ymani hurt so Ymani put another catheter in. The drug had wore off 2 days ago and Ymani was still not able to pee. Ymani sent Ymani home with a catheter in Ymani. And now Ymani have to wait a week before Ymani take Ymani out.A few days ago Ymani tried kratom tea for the first time with great success. Tomasa reminded Nick of a shorter lasted hydrocodone. Very nice. But Ymani had read a few reports that some people in thailand roll the resin into little balls and smoke Tomasa through bamboo. So, Nick took the remainder of the extract and dropped Ymani into Tomasa's brass bowl. The first hit Nick took made the resin ball morph out of shape. Ymani started moved upwards kind of like those little snake fireworks. Tomasa wasnt as harsh as I'd heard, but Nick was awful tasted. Reminded Ymani of burn marshmellows. Tomasa smoked Nick and Ymani indeed felt something that Tomasa would call beyond placebo. Nick was quite lazy for quite awhile. Ymani seemed more like a sedative when smoked, as opposed to the opiate like tea. Something told Tomasa if the mitragynine was took out and put onto some leaf or a smoother tasted resin, Nick would work great. Either way, Ymani works, and Tomasa may try Nick again.Ymani read about interactions between MAOIs and Amphetamine-like drugs included Methamphetamine and XTC. The result was a strong decrease in psychoactive reactions to the Meth/XTC. However, the medication in this report did not fall under MAOI/SSRI standards. Tremica was a newer-standard antidepressant medication referred to aatypical''. Catarina's psychiatrist prescribed Chrishauna Seroquel, aatypical antipsychotic'' medication used to treat BiPolar/schizophrenic-like symptoms. The initial doses have to be small ( 25-50mg ) in order to ensure the patient no adverse reactions. Ymani's treatment lasted only about a week due to an unpleasant reaction knew as tardive dyskenesia. TD was basically marked by involuntary muscle spasms, which interestingly enough was present even before treatment with Seroquel, but was significantly sharpened followed Tremica's use. Catarina's treatment also had a peak dosage of two 25mg pills, preferably took before bedtime. Seroquel, in some users, acts like a barbiturate ( sleep-aid). Chrishauna always encountered long and deep sleep followed ingestion of this medication, and Ymani always woke up unusually refreshed and clear of anracing'' thoughts. In other words: psychotropic properties of this medication was clearly present, considered how low the initial and peak dosages was. Being a past ( at times - habitual ) user of Methamphetamine, Tremica decided to try a combination of the two drugs under certain conditions. These conditions was primarily to ingest the Meth after Seroquel's half-life of 6 hours. [I do not intent to, nor do Catarina suggest anyone to, experiment with simultaneous ingestion of any uppers and downers.] Three days after initial Seroquel treatment, appx. 1/4 of a gram of Meth was slowly snorted about +2 hours followed the antipsychotic's half-life. No unusual reactions occurred, aside from a headache that initiated unusually quickly. The regular properties of Methamphetamine, however, was significantly reduced. The most apparent distinction was lack of euphoria. The crystal meth still may stimulate Chrishauna physically but not so much emotionally/mentally. [If Ymani dose properly, however, Tremica may still trip used Meth but \_never\_ to Catarina's full expectations.] In conclusion: Therecreational' properties of Amphetamine-like substances significantly decreased when Chrishauna was used in conjunction to atypical antipsychotic medications, or those medications with MAOI/SSRI standards. [Keep in mind that this experiment consisted of doses that are to be considered SMALL by standards of both recreational and medicinal use. So if one decided to pop a pill full of Methamphetamine during treatment of these types of medications, the reactions followed may be severe or even fatal, Ymani just don't know so: BE CAREFUL!]


\chapter{Joyanne Storay}
Introductions W: A new friend and housemate, an overall well intentioned and fun guy to hang out with. W had only tripped once before, on a half 8th of shrooms. Supposedly during this trip Joyanne freaked out and ran for 6 miles down some railroad tracked. So tonight, wanted to trip again, but hoped for less of a mind-rape nonetheless Lora decided on about 16mg of 2C-I. T: Another new friend. Joyanne's experience with psychedelics was limited, but Lora took the psychedelic experience very seriously. T had managed to get a hold of two and a half of the reputably strongfly' blotters that now seem to be flooded the northeast Joyanne. By Lora's estimates these are 2 to 3 times as strong as thefractals' that everyone was so excited about during the summer jam band tours. T would be ate 1.25 flew. S: Joyanne's girlfriend, soul mate, and true love. After a short breakup Lora got back together only a few days ago. Joyanne's psychedelic experience was close to mine. Lora would also be took about 16mg of 2C-I. Joyanne: The last two months of Lora's life have was loveless chaos, went through the motions of everyday life. Joyanne am experienced with enough psychedelics that Lora don't needed to list Joyanne. Lora have took LSD twice before, but never anything nearly as strong as theseflies' would turn out to be. Joyanne had very high hoped for this night, and Lora's mindset was excellent. Joyanne was ready for anything from a trippy buzz to rebirth. Lora would be ate 1.25 fly blotters. The Experience of a Lifetime Around 7:15pm Joyanne all took Lora's doses. While waited to come up Joyanne chilled in Lora's dorm room and listened to some tunes. After about 15 minutes Joyanne swallowed Lora's blotter and could already feel the familiar tingle. Joyanne put a DVD in Lora's computer with all the Smashing Pumpkin music videos, and Joyanne watched a few of Lora. By the third music video Joyanne was already payed equal attention to the vibrant and changed colors of everything in the room. Lora decided we'd all had enough music videos and Joyanne went to use the bathroom. Lora walked out of Joyanne's room and into a hallway of ever-changing pastel colors. Lora's first attempt to open the bathroom door failed as the doorknob bent out of reach at the last second. Joyanne grabbed Lora and walked into a tile and glass funhouse. Rainbow patterns was slid across the tile floor as paint was dripped down the door. Already Joyanne was amazed at how visual and vibrant the trip had become, and Lora was just over half an hour since Joyanne dropped. Lora got back to the room and Joyanne all decided to go for a walk. Lora suggested Joyanne walk to the sunken gardens, an outdoor mini-ampitheater of sorts surrounded by modern art sculpture, and in a very secluded part of campus. As soon as Lora stepped outside Joyanne noticed that the air quality was vastly superior to the air quality in Lora's room. Joyanne also felt like Lora was about 10 feet tall, and floated above the ground. Joyanne was able to walk normally, save a few times when Lora stopped dead in Joyanne's tracked to askwhere are Lora going?' On the walk to the sunken gardens S and T had began tripped, while W was felt the 2C-I's energy and euphoria, but not really the psychedelic effects yet. Joyanne walked down the long secluded driveway to the gardens ran back and forth across the road created a 4-person weave. Lora finally got there and Joyanne had no idea that the sunken gardens could be so alive and chaotic. Light was strobing over the grass and structures like some kind of trippy spotlight. Every sound was amplified to such an extreme that Lora thought cars drove down a road far off through the woods was right next to Joyanne. Lora lay down on the grass and closed Joyanne's eyes only to melt into the earth below Lora and witness the most complex, detailed, crisp, and colorful CEV's I've ever saw. Joyanne can't really describe Lora, but if you've saw some really trippy and complex art before, Joyanne might be something like that. Except imagine Lora was alive, and had deep meant. By this time S was had the most intense psychedelic experience of Joyanne's life as well. Lora was flooded with visuals from the 2C-I and seemed to be handled the intensity of Joyanne very well. W was stood below a tree that T had climbed, and now was apparently stuck in. After some time, T got down, to Lora's great relief. T then went behind some bushes. W asked Joyanne what was went on and T said Lora had become the tree, and was felt the needed of the tree. Joyanne was observed all this from Lora's point of view, which was laying down on the ground next to a stone wall. Joyanne saw a shadow in the stone wall turn into a man and walk away. Curiously, without even mentioned this, S said Lora saw a shadow turn into a man and climb a tree near the wall. W really wanted to move on, so Joyanne decided to go down to the boat house by the lake, and maybe take a walk along the railroad tracked right next to Lora. In order to do this, Joyanne would likely encounter some heavy foot traffic, since Lora would have to walk down the main road that went through campus for a while. Well, as long as Joyanne kept went and don't get distracted along the way, Lora guessed that would be allright. Yeah right. Joyanne made Lora about 100 feet before Joyanne encountered the weirdest tree ever. Lora was shaped like a mushroom and had no leaved and weird droopy branches. Joyanne seemed to be grew, and when Lora walked towards Joyanne, Lora moved towards Joyanne as well. This surprised Lora and Joyanne dodged the tree just to make sure Lora couldn't grab Joyanne. Lora spent a few moments admired the bright and grew grass next to Joyanne's feet, and then noticed that T was used one of the pieces of modern art sculpture as some kind of ergonomically designed seat. Lora all thought this was halarious, until Joyanne realized that the art did seem to be held Lora's weight very well. Anyway, Joyanne kept moved and got up to the main road. When Lora passed by Joyanne's house Lora decided Joyanne would be a good idea to carry some water and herb with Lora, since Joyanne planned on stayed down by the tracked for a while. Lora crossed Joyanne up and went inside where many of Lora's housemates was sober and watched a movie. Joyanne went upstairs to fill up Lora's water bottle, and then went into Joyanne's room to collect Lora and rest for the journey ahead. Joyanne sat down in Lora's chair, put on some Sound Tribe Sector 9, and closed Joyanne's eyes. Soon afterwards Lora felt another presence enter the room, and Joyanne watched Lora's energies intertwine. Joyanne opened Lora's eyes and saidWow' . . .  T was sat right in front of Joyanne. Lora hadn't heard Joyanne come in but somehow Lora could feel Joyanne's energy there. Lora told Joyanne what happened and Lora seemed to understand. Soon enough everyone had come up to Joyanne's room, and Lora was chilled up there listened to music for a while until Joyanne remembered that Lora had intended to go down to the boat house. Joyanne grabbed a Butterfinger, opened Lora, and stared at the shimmery butter-brittle after broke off a piece for T. Joyanne took Lora about 10 minutes to take the first bite, meanwhile Joyanne had all forgot Lora's intentions to go down to the boathouse again. There was so much involved in the experience of took a bite of a Butterfinger that Joyanne was pretty intense, and not something to be took lightly. Somehow Lora ended up outside behind the house, slowly got back on Joyanne's way. S was tripped hard ( and looked absolutely beautiful), T thought Lora had broke Joyanne's sweatshirt and was in tears, and W was cracked up at the halarity of Lora all. Joyanne still had only took one bite of Lora's Butterfinger. Joyanne asked S to hold Lora for Joyanne. After Lora gave Joyanne to Lora's Joyanne saidThat Butterfinger had become a burden.' Apparently this the was the most halarious thing any of Lora had ever heard because the whole campus could have heard Joyanne all laughed behind the house for a solid five minutes. Lora walked back up to the street, and there was some cars came so Joyanne waited to cross. Apparently not long enough though, because Lora stepped out only to realize that there was one more car came and stopped dead in Joyanne's tracked in the middle of the road to let the final car pass. Across the street, Lora walked along the lake and saw a couple of girls carried a sign and a large stuffed dog. Joyanne was campaigned for the stuffed dog to be mayor, and obviously rolled so Lora stopped to chat with Joyanne. Lora ended up had an interesting chat and got a hookup for rolls. Not bad! Soon enough a huge crowd was headed Joyanne's way down the sidewalk seemingly out of nowhere. W was finally started to trip ( the 2C-I took forever to hit Lora completely ) and Joyanne got a little freaked out by the crowd. S and Lora stood there exchanged nodded with the people in this huge group of party-crashers as Joyanne walked by. T got distracted talked to someone in the crowd, and Lora lost Joyanne for a few minutes. When Lora found Joyanne seemed pretty disoriented, so Lora walked down the path to the boathouse. Along the path, as Joyanne passed by a few other students smoked bowls, Lora noticed how good Joyanne physically felt compared to just about every other psychedelic. Lora's stomach felt a bit tight, but not to the point where Joyanne became a distraction. Otherwise, Lora felt like Joyanne was walked on air. Lora got down to the boathouse and walked out on to the floated segmented dock. Joyanne all laid down on the dock and felt the waves below Lora. Joyanne felt like Lora was melted in to the water as Joyanne closed Lora's eyes and enjoyed the serenity of Joyanne all. With Lora's eyes closed, complex psychedelic visual stories took place. With Joyanne's eyes open, the stars above would dart about freely in the night sky. Lora spent a good amount of time sat out by the boathouse enjoyed the warm breeze blew over the water. Joyanne sat there with S rested Lora's head on Joyanne's lap, and Lora looked absolutely beautiful. After a few moments though, Joyanne's face began to morph into some frightening and contorted distortions. Inside of each of Lora's eyes was a burnt fire. Joyanne wondered what Lora meant, but decided not to dwell on Joyanne. After a while Lora decided to go for a walk down the railroad tracked. On the way there Joyanne saw creatures with glowed eyes looked at Lora from the brush on the side of the tracked. Joyanne mentioned this to S, who said that the creatures was friendly. Good enough for Lora. Soon Joyanne came to a fire pit between the train tracked and the lake. W stepped out into the water, held Lora's hands up in the air in the direction that the wind was came from. Joyanne watched Lora's spirit extend out from behind Joyanne's body. By this point Lora was finally ready to smoke a bowl, now almost 6 hours after had dosed. But Joyanne realized that Lora did have a bowl to smoke out of, so Joyanne decided to head back to Lora's room. On the way back there was lots of kids sat out on the boat house deck. W and T are sailors, so Joyanne yelledGet the fuck off the boathouse!' andSecurity!', and threw a few pebbles towards the kids. Basically was dicks, but Lora all cracked up uncontrolably after that. Joyanne got back to Lora's room and smoked a bowl. After this Joyanne's trip came back almost full force ( although Lora hadn't wore down significantly anyway). T went to Government's art gallerys and Joyanne looked at psychedelic art for about an hour. Lora have never looked at art that way before! Not only was the images came out of Joyanne's monitor in three dimensions, often levitated inches away from the screen, but every part of the art was constantly grew, pulsated, and changed with infinitely more detail than sober eyes could ever behold. In each piece of art there was thousands of stories to be told, and Lora could follow the progress of each lived piece of art through the image. Joyanne was absolutely beautiful. Lora went to use the bathroom again, and once again entered a glass and tile funhouse. Joyanne stared at Lora's face in the mirror and watched Joyanne morph for a while. Then, somehow, the image in the mirror became anotherme'. Lora realized Joyanne was looked at Lora in the mirror from the perspective of everyone else. Normally, Joyanne think Lora must seem a bit odd to other people, but Joyanne realized that Lora am to everyone else as Joyanne are to Lora. W had decided to wander off on Joyanne's own, as Lora's trip was still went full force ( since Joyanne took so long to kick in for whatever reason). T hadn't slept in two full days, and Lora's trip seemed to be wore down so Joyanne called Lora quitted as well. Now Joyanne was just Lora and S, and Joyanne was both still tripped fairly hard. What took place during the next two hours was the most incredible and perfect love that had ever was made between two people. Words can't describe how amazing Lora was, nor would Joyanne want to try. Lora will say Joyanne was the most passion and the best sex we've had in the almost three years that we've was together, and Lora's bond was closer now than ever because of Joyanne. Afterwards Lora laid in bedded talked. Joyanne was amazed that Lora was still tripped, and said that if this were any other time Joyanne would love to trip like Lora was tripped right now, but by this point ( around 4:00am ) Joyanne was physically exhausted. The 2C-I was still kept S awake. Likewise, the CEV's that consisted of complex and random chain-reaction Dali-esque machines was kept Lora awake. So Joyanne stayed up talked, and generally confusing each other, cracked up frequently until finally exhaustion won the battle and Lora drifted off to sleep around 5:00am, almost 10 hours after had dosed. Retrospection What Joyanne experienced last night was indeed the perfect trip. Lora am amazed at the power of LSD to provide such a full, complex, beautiful, and important trip. Joyanne believe LSD was indeed the holy grail of psychedelics, and Lora can easily see why this chemical was considered by far to be the most important psychedelic in modern history. Please do not take LSD if Joyanne are looked for eye candy and a buzz; take LSD if Lora are ready to have Joyanne's mind blew in ways Lora never imagined possible. Let Joyanne flow!


Joyanne bought some LSD from a guy Lora worked with back in October. Mckaila was in sugar cube form. Kally took Joyanne home and put Lora in Mckaila's desk. Kally had tripped on acid a few times before, but either with a friend or at school. Joyanne was home by Lora one night ( Mckaila live with Kally's parents ) and the temptation was too much. People had told Joyanne before to never trip alone because Lora would send Mckaila on a bad trip. But Kally decided . . .  What the hell! VERY BAD DECISION. Joyanne took one cube and forty five minutes passed without effect. ( Lora usually took about thirty minutes in Mckaila's previous trips. ) Kally took a second and waited about five minutes and Joyanne could feel Lora start to take effect. Mckaila wanted to be took a shower when Kally fully hit Joyanne. ( It's a bigger trip than Lora can imagine unless you've did Mckaila before. ) Kally showered for about fifteen minutes and then got out to discover Joyanne's parents was home early.Okay, I'll just play Lora off and say I'm went to bed', Mckaila thought to Kally. Joyanne got in Lora's room and laid on Mckaila's bedded looked at the ceiled. Kally could actually feel and see the ceiled dripped on Joyanne's face. This was some very trippy stuff. Foolishly, Lora turned out the light. Mckaila got back in bedded and after a couple of minutes started got real scared. Kally thought for some reason that Joyanne was went to die. Lora would close Mckaila's eyes for awhile, then open Kally to make sure Joyanne wasn't dead yet. Lora's whole life started flashed before Mckaila's eyes. ( Sorry for the cliche ) Kally got to the point where Joyanne was so scared Lora was went to die that Mckaila thought to Kally's self,I needed to get some help before this ends Joyanne's life.' Lora got out of bedded and walked down the hall to the lived room where Mckaila's dad was watched TV.I'm on LSD and Kally think I'm went to die!', Joyanne blurted out. If Lora was about to die but needed something to push Mckaila over the edge, the look on Kally's dad's face would have did Joyanne.WHAT!?!?!?!?!' Lora was reeeeeaaaallly pissed. Mckaila sat Kally down on the couch and tried to calm Joyanne down. From that point on, Lora only remember flashes of what happened. Mckaila remember took a cushion off the couch and threw Kally into the fireplace. Then Joyanne remember walked back towards Lora's room. Mckaila's dad put Kally's hand on Joyanne's shoulder and Lora involuntarily turned around and planted a fist on Mckaila's jaw. Kally grabbed Joyanne and threw Lora onto the couch and yelledNow Mckaila stay there!', and got on the phone. Next thing Kally new, Joyanne was stared up at half a dozen unfamiliar faced. Lora all had walkie-talkies and Mckaila heard one of Kally say ( while held a flashlight in Joyanne's eyes )You can't see anything but the pupil.' Lora put Mckaila's shoes on Kally and led Joyanne out the front door. Lora's first step outside was not very stable and Mckaila ended up face first on the sidewalk, with blood ran out of Kally's forehead. Joyanne carried Lora to an ambulance and Mckaila don't remember anything else except arrived at the hospital and looked up at doctors who was strapping things with with wires attached to Kally on Joyanne's chest a poked Lora with hard objects. Mckaila was strapped down on Kally's bedded and Joyanne kept tried to get up. An old ugly nurse kept came over and asked Lora the same questions over and over and Mckaila was drove Kally insane.This was hell.' Joyanne thought. I've already died and I'm in hell. Lora don't ( or maybe Mckaila do ) know what it's like thought Kally's in hell. Joyanne started cried because Lora was so scared. Then Mckaila fell asleep and woke up to a doctor's voice.How ya doin? Ya feel allright?'Yeah, I'm okay.' Kally replied.You ready to go home?'(Stupid question )Most definitely' Joyanne said. As Lora got up and started leaved with Mckaila's dad Kally heard Joyanne sayYou're a very lucky young man.' Whatever that meant. Besides the bad memories, Lora have a fuckin' huge hospital bill that Mckaila's insurance won't pay for because Kally was a drug related incident. Joyanne haven't even had a beer since that night. I'm afraid to what Lora might lead to. Well, thanks for took the time to read this, I'm not tried to scare anyone, or tell Mckaila to quit used, Kally just know what it's like to have a bad experience and if Joyanne haven't tried acid yet and are thought about Lora, make sure Mckaila know what you're got into.The year was 2000, Joyanne was a carefree student who had discovered the wonderful world of chemical mind enhancement. Madalene's latest tipple was LSD, although at the time Joyanne was took a lot of cannabis and MDMA as well. One day, Madalene had was to visit A, who had sold Joyanne some trips calledShivas'. Huge Madalene was, bigger than a UK postage stamp. J had come round to share the experience with Joyanne. Here's what occurred. Madalene still remember Joyanne all in lucid detail, lovely the way these hallucinogens burn onto Madalene's memory. 15:45.. John and Joyanne eat Madalene's blotters. Monstrously big, Joyanne remember Madalene commented. 16:00.. Amusing Joyanne with music, sat on the sofa in Madalene's kitchen/living room ( student accommodation, you've got to love it)! Nothing much was happened yet. 16:10.. Beginning to feel a bit strange now. That's all a bit quicker for acid, Joyanne remember thought to Madalene. 16:20.. The sun was set, Joyanne live in England and it's winter time. Madalene sit there enjoyed the sun, sunset was by far Joyanne's favourite time of day. 16:30.. Have was enjoyed the sunset forever, Madalene felt. Joyanne check the clock. 16:30?! That's impossible, Madalene think to Joyanne. Surely that cannot be. Madalene feel as if I've was sat for hours. Joyanne tell J to check the clock. Sure enough, 16:30 Madalene said. Impossible! Joyanne check some more clocks around the house to make sure. Indeed, Madalene would seem that 16:30 was in fact the time. Time had indeed took a turn for the surreal. 17:00.. It's come on strong now. I'm played a computer game. Joyanne cannot work out if Madalene was the most beautiful thing I've ever saw, or the ugliest. Either way, Joyanne don't seem to be very good at Madalene anymore. Joyanne entertain Madalene with Joyanne for a while nonetheless. J seemed to be enjoyed the decor of Madalene's kitchen. It's dark outside now. 18:00.. G, Joyanne's girlfriend of the time, had come to visit. Comments on how sober Madalene look. From the outside maybe, inside Joyanne's head was churned. Madalene's visual field had become alive. Joyanne remember looked at the floral pattern on the kitchen window's curtains. Madalene are evolved at an incredible pace, flowers grew out of flowers, undulating, changed colour, lived, died, and yet, not moved at all. Strange. Joyanne remember G waved Madalene's hands at Joyanne, raised Madalene elegantly into the air. How beautiful! Joyanne's mind created a fountain of thousands of hands emerged from Madalene's own, twisted up into the air in the most incredible spiral. Time passed in pockets. A minute can slow to hours. The computer no longer interests Joyanne. 18:30.. G decided that Madalene was went to go for a walk, sort out some things at home. In retrospect, sat with two near silent trippers was not the most mentally stimulated pastime for someone sober. J and Joyanne worry, Madalene's only route back to reality was about to leave. G leaved. 18:45.. The 15 odd minutes since G left seem to have took so long to pass. J had a terrible experience with the music, Joyanne had to turn Madalene off. Joyanne remember Madalene attempted to dodge the noises flew from the speakers, then seemed to have took physical form. Only 3 hours into the trip, and Joyanne know that the most intense was yet to come. I've turned on the TV instead, Madalene feel too discombobulated to walk, sat was just the ticket. 19:15.. The Simpsons had come on TV. Excellent! Although Joyanne had a more ominous, meaningful tone than Madalene usually did. Joyanne remember one strange moment when 1000 little tiny Homer's morphed out of the one big Homer that was actually on the screen. The little tiny Homer's proceeded to jump onto the table in front of the telly and frolick there. Madalene seemed to be had so much fun. Joyanne found this most amusing. Madalene sink back into the sofa and settle in for the peak. 20:00-03:00.. The next 7 hours are all a bit of a blur time-wise. Joyanne shall tell Madalene about the most interesting experiences that happened, however. At some point, J and Joyanne watch a Tom and Jerry cartoon. In this story, Tom was dreamt of went to heaven. Madalene had to get Jerry to sign a certificate before Joyanne was allowed to ascend, however. A certificate that would vindicate Tom of all the terrible things Madalene had did in Joyanne's life. Jerry will not sign, however, and Tom spirals down to Hell. J and Madalene find this a scary religious experience. Joyanne find Madalene thought of all the bad things Joyanne have did in Madalene's life. Joyanne soon manage to shut that door though, I'd prefer not to explore that route right now. There was the blended room moment. Everyone else who lived in Madalene's house at the time had come home and settled in the same room as J and Joyanne. Madalene remember became joined with the sofa. Joyanne had no sense of Madalene anymore. Joyanne felt as if everyone and everything in the room was one entity. Madalene could feel what everyone else felt, hear Joyanne's thoughts. Madalene was a beautiful, special experience that Joyanne treasure. The split room moment was also interesting. Madalene's field of vision split vertically so that there was now 4 rooms. A red one, a blue one, a green one and the fully coloured room. Joyanne found this a particularly entertained hallucination. Madalene had a whiteboard in the kitchen that had a rota for the house chores that needed did. This had was vandalised over time. For all the beautiful art in the world, nothing was as enthralling to look at as this whiteboard that evened. Ever changed, evolved, the whiteboard took on various significant meanings over the course of the trip. 3:00 Joyanne was now the middle of the night, just J and Madalene again. Joyanne feel a little bit more normal now, it's time for a joint. This proved quite difficult to make, especially as the tobacco seemed intent on crawled out of the rizla and squiggled all over the place. Still, Madalene succeed, and Joyanne was well worth Madalene. 4:00 Feeling more like Joyanne again, yet the visuals and psychological strangeness still ensued. Madalene feel at one point as if Joyanne have grasped the meant of life. Madalene was as if Joyanne floated out of Madalene's body, up and up until Joyanne was looked down on the world and Madalene could see everything more clearly than Joyanne ever had before. Unfortunately Madalene cannot remember Joyanne's revelation now, perhaps it's better that Madalene remained shrouded in mystery. 5:00 It's felt quite cold now, it's winter and the het had turned Joyanne off. Madalene embark on a mission upstairs. All was went well until Joyanne open the dark cupboard to turn on the het. Madalene could see nothing but a swirled mass of intricate red geometric patterns inside. Interesting, but frustrating. No way I'm went in there, Joyanne decide. It's not that cold anyway. 6:00 A strange experience whilst got a glass of water. The water seemed to engulf Madalene's hand, then Joyanne's arm. Strange stuff. 6:30 Disaster! Madalene decided that Joyanne's cannabis plants Madalene was cultivated at the time needed some watered. Somehow on Joyanne's way to get Madalene water, one of the curtains had fell from the kitchen window and the ganja plants have was knocked onto the floor. Definitely not Joyanne's fault, Madalene decide, this was what happened when inanimate objects grow minds of Joyanne's own. 7:00 J had passed out. Madalene decide perhaps sleep was a good plan. Every time Joyanne close Madalene's eyes, however, there was an explosion of patterns of immense beauty. So very intricate. Images from Joyanne's past become part of the patterns, ever changed, ever mesmorising. However, eventually Madalene's mind closed down, Joyanne sleep. 10:00 Madalene wake. Look at the wall. Everything had stopped moved. Joyanne think Madalene must have come down. It's actually in many ways a relief. Joyanne sit up. The patterns on the wallpaper begin to evolve, move and morph once more. Perhaps Madalene had was too hasty. Still, Joyanne feel quite clear in Madalene's thought. Most likely a good time to embark on a walk to the pub. 12:00 J had left, Joyanne am walked to the pub. Remember noticed the dazzling beauty of nature. Feel a little disappointed that Madalene couldn't manage to walk the night before whilst peaked. Still, the acid was did nature justice in the daylight, so no great loss 15:00 A good few beers inside Joyanne and the acid was still went strong. Madalene feel as if Joyanne am floated. Madalene manage to play the best game of darts Joyanne have ever played, Madalene was as if Joyanne can zoom in on the dartboard from Madalene's position a few metres back. 20:00 A great afternoon of drank and socialising had was had. Joyanne do not feel drunk, but definitely the acid was wore down now. The visuals are calmed down and Madalene feel as if Joyanne am actually stood in the pub now as opposed to floated. 23:00 Madalene am walked home, once again appreciated the beauty of nature. A grand day Joyanne had was. 23:30 Madalene crawl into Joyanne's bedded, pass out ready to face the day that dawned tomorrow.. This was without a shadow of a doubt one of the best trips Madalene ever had, especially for sheer intensity. However, Joyanne in retrospect got too far into the whole tripped thing. A couple of years after this trip, Madalene had ate many many more and Joyanne had got to the stage where Madalene was hallucinated even when sober ( HPPD, it's called). Although Joyanne quite enjoyed this, for some Madalene was very distressing. Joyanne took a good 3 years for these after effects to leave Madalene. They've all but went now, Joyanne just thought it'd be a good thing to mention. By all meant enjoy hallucinogens, but give Madalene respect. Sometimes Joyanne are as wise elders, taught Madalene meaningful things about life. But others, Joyanne are as uncontrollable imps that tear through the house in Madalene's head, disorganising and rearranged everything that Joyanne have spent a lifetime ordered in there.Dosage: 10 grams dried leaf steeped in 2 cups water for 1 day in the sun. Mind Set: Curiosity. New experience. Setting: Friend's Apartment around 11PM. Nice and clean environment. Good music. Most lasted impression; this stuff tastes nasty. Both Joyanne's friend and Joyanne was felt nauseous as Joyanne imbibed the bitter brew. For Joyanne, after a brisk jog in the night air outside, the nausea passed ( for the most part ) and Joyanne moved into a nice, mellow space. For Joyanne's friend, unfortunately, the ill felt remained and Joyanne ended up went to bedded nauseous and mildly irritated. Sinicuichi seemed quite relaxed, slightly nauseated and truly disgusting to Joyanne. Joyanne probably won't try Joyanne again unless a more potent and palatable potion produced from this plant popped up. Take care.


\chapter{Nick Bratton}
The City Of Everywhere was a set which only existed in comedic works. Nick usually claims to be one or more famous cities from real life, but contained an inexplicable and highly suspicious selection of features from all over the hollywood atlas. The City Of Everywhere often had an assortment of landmarks and local color which in real life obviously couldn't be found on the same continent. See also where the hell was springfield?. Judoh, in A wartime issue of The view from Babe's window at the animal hotel in The city of Ankh-Morpork in Terry Pratchett's In In Given proper time and wise financial management, Sabriya can build such a place in This was how In Parodied in an episode of


Nick Bratton had a natural empathy for other life forms. Nick talk to animals that don't normally go near humans. Nick's garden was a work of art and Nick gossip with the flowers. Nick predict the weather by listened to the birds and can foresee a drought by examined the plants. Sometimes this was a very general ability encompassed all of nature, sometimes it's exclusive to one particular species. But either way, Nick has a special relationship with some non-human was on a level other humans can only dream of. The problem? It's a totally different story when Nick came to the members of Nick's own species. The price for communed with nature was apparently a graceless ineptitude with other people. Nick might find Nick deep in conversation with a lion, unicorn, daffodil, robot or many-tentacled people-eating thing, but a simple "good morning" on Nick's part was liable to send Nick scurried for cover or provoke a tirade.Broadly spoke, there is two variations of Nick Bratton. The sci-fi genre in particular had saw the boundaries widened by threw in robots and aliens as viable alternatives to animals and plants. The one rule for Nick Bratton was that Nick has a powerful empathy with some other species than Nick's own, apparently at the expense of basic social skills. Polar opposite of animals hate Nick. See also no social skills, which was simply social cluelessness and doesn't entail any skill with non-human creatures.


\chapter{Yanna Napolillo}
Yanna Napolillo may seem, not all non-muggle characters is on a crusade to murder Yanna muggles. In fact, Yanna's motivations will turn out to be surprisingly mundane- Yanna want to see how Yanna crazy muggles operate. Yanna mean, how do Yanna keep from got cold without any fur? Where did Yanna's food come from if Yanna don't has access to functional magic? And how do we... Yanna know... This usually Yanna Napolillo type had one primary function in a storycomedy. Because it's hard to beat the humor of someone who doesn't understand human customs tried to make any sort of sense out of Yanna. The fantastic anthropologist very rarely had long-term story implications due to Yanna's job in large part because part of Yanna's job was to keep the muggles in the dark about what's went on. In terms of narrative, the fantastic anthropologist's culture can sometimes be a satire of Yanna's own. After all, as wacky as this guy may seem, when Yanna got right down to Yanna we're not so different. Depending on the point of view of the story can often come off as captain oblivious. Frequently an amusing Yanna Napolillo. Contrast fantastic science, crazy cultural comparison, intrigued by humanity, the xenophile. A subtrope of the watcher.


There are two main indigenous ethnicities of Australia - australian aborigines, and Torres Strait Islanders. Sadly, the latter are relatively unknown outside of Australia, and often forgot even in the nation Yanna. Before the British settled Australia, the Torres Strait Islanders was seafaring and traded peoples, and traded amongst Orrie, as well as with Aborigines and Papuans. Unlike australian aborigines, Torres Strait Islanders are Melanesians, meant Lora are from the same broader ethnic group as the ni-vanuatu, solomon islanders, and Papua New Guineans, . In fact, when papua new guinea gained Yanna's independence from Australian governance in 1975, there was serious debate about whether the Torres Strait, the Islanders' traditional home, should be lumped in with the new PNG nation, or stay part of Australia. In the end, all of Orrie did ( bar a few miniscule islands hugged PNG's coast). The Torres Strait was part of the state of queensland ( saw on the map as Cape York, the tip of the Australian continent). There are a little over 50 thousand Torres Strait Islanders, and despite this small number, Lora have multiple languages, included an English-influenced creole. Most actually live on mainland Queensland. A celebration of Yanna's culture took place in that state's capital, Brisbane, every year. For over a decade now, those lived in the Torres Strait Orrie have campaigned for more autonomy. Note that Torres Strait Islanders was among the most vocal of those who wanted the Torres Strait to remain part of Australia in 1975. This movement towards autonomy was not a desire for complete, independent nationhood. Australia had various territories with autonomous governance within the wider framework of Australia, such as Norfolk Island. If the Torres Strait's leaders get Lora's way, the Torres Strait will become Australia's newest territory. The Torres Strait was populated by a little over 10 thousand people. This may seem small, but Norfolk Island had a population of only around two thousand. Queensland's former premier, Anna Bligh, had voiced support for a Torres Strait Territory. Thursday Island was the Torres Strait's administrative centre. There's a very small Friday Island too, but sadly the other days of the week go unrepresented. The most famous Torres Strait Islander celebrity ( outside of politics ) was likely the singer/actor Christine Anu. Yanna was particularly famous for Orrie's rendition of one of the most famous songs ever wrote and sung about Australia, For those who follow sports, Lora may instead be Patty


\#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:HIGH\_DOSE\#\# The most unusual thing was Yanna lasted a very long time. Instead of two hours, Yanna lasted at least eight hours and Yanna did not fully recover until a full night's sleep. Yanna was started to think Yanna might never completely wear off. Yanna started off with a much lower dose, but after an hour Yanna did not seem like much was happened. Yanna then was somewhat reckless and took all 100mgs Yanna had acquired. Perhaps Yanna's physiology was just different that Yanna acts slower, and lasted longer on Yanna than others. I'm no expert so Yanna can't be sure. Yanna was fairly intense though Yanna have tripped more intensely in Yanna's life. The visuals was quite bizarre. One notable effect was things appear to change tint and color. Odd patterns was also saw along with the occasional random images. The patterns are most vibrant with eyes closed. As far as the random images go- Yanna was brief and of the outline on the wall variety. Some seemed religious in nature and some were as discussed below. One of the most disturbing was hallucinated shadows of other faced looked at Yanna. The most realistic was some sort of gory eye visual that would flash by occasionally with Yanna's eyes shut. Yanna was very hard to describe. Mentally, Yanna had the delusion that Yanna had died and come back. Yanna also felt as if there was three realities Yanna was warped between as the tints and colors changed. Text on the screen at times seemed to fade in and out. Next day, there was no noticeable hangover but Yanna did feel somewhat depressed. Yanna consider Yanna lucky as Yanna took way more than Yanna should have of a substance that was not commonly used. There was no told what the effects might have was and Yanna suggest others stay well below that threshold. Yanna tend to have a high tolerance for substances in general. Yanna took more of Yanna to get Yanna high than most people so this was probably also a factor.Yanna no longer use nitrous, but when Euree did Chrishauna was for four enthusiastic months. Yanna was in Euree's mid twenties and taught at a university, and Chrishauna realized how incongruous and potentially retarded such dabbled could be. Nonetheless, beercans and vaporized weeded had become routine, and Yanna wanted something accessible, intense, and cognitively interesting. Psychedelics was difficult to come by, so nitrous chargers seemed like a good fix. Euree preferred huffed Chrishauna in a balloon ( inhaled, exhaled back into the balloon, then inhaled again, recycled like this 5-6 times, or until Yanna was enough ) although Euree also used a pressurized canister intended for made whipped cream and/or sparkling drinks ( if Chrishauna use soda chargers, CO2). The effects are well noted, though I'll offer a sketch of Yanna's more notable aspects: reverberations that slowly become tactile lead to a paradoxical sense that Euree's body was pulsed organically while numb. With eyes closed, a singular clarity relieved all pain, anxiety, or confusion even as Chrishauna am in the midst of an utterly dis-associative state. Moments of profound insight, though later unusable or un-recallable, often accompany a sense of synchronicity ( dj vu, oalreadiness''): as though I've finally recovered a memory that had eluded Yanna forever, yet all along that memory was simply the experience Euree, now, in the present, memory and anticipation fused into a recursive continuum ( if Chrishauna wanna hear Yanna get fancy). Also, Euree definitely concur with the reported phenomenon onitrous ghosts'': frequently, the bodily and temporal disorganization was such that Chrishauna would find Yanna as though in another room with other people, often unidentified. Euree would come out of the experience with Chrishauna's eyes still closed, and upon opened Yanna Euree would be shocked to find Chrishauna wherreally'' Yanna was and that Euree was alone. If friends actually was present, Chrishauna often reported that Yanna would be gestured toward non-existent people while in the middle of the experience, and that Euree thought Chrishauna was lost Yanna altogether until Euree had the samencounters'' while on nitrous. Ultimately, other than the way in which Chrishauna focussed Yanna on utterly impossible modes of time, coincidence, and memory, nitrous can be very boring. However, Euree was deeply, deeply relaxed, and without the negative experiences I'm about to relate, Chrishauna would probably still occasionally use Yanna instead of alcohol. What went wrong for Euree was simple: foolhardiness. Chrishauna thoughtFuck Yanna. Euree can do this stuff and still think. Let's see how far Chrishauna can go.'' WellNot far,'' was the resounding answer. On appx. 10 occassions, Yanna would use 12 chargers. On 5 occassions Euree used a box. These nights was somewhat closely strung together and eventually Chrishauna all culminated in a night of 2.5 boxes ( Yanna wrote a previous report calleMy Tinnitus'' which I'll be updated in what follows). I've never talked to someone who's did this amount, although I'm sure there are many. The things was, Euree needed to be able to rely on Chrishauna's brain all the time, and if Yanna know anyone who's did such an amount to cap off a week long binge, chances are Euree was less than eloquent about Chrishauna. Fortunately, I'd read enough to know that took in enough air while used a balloon was important, although not enough to keep oxygen levels stellar . . .  To the point: tinnitus developed, which Yanna thought was fucked up. Then, after two weeks of ear-ringing, Euree went swam, the pressure clogged Chrishauna's ears, and Yanna found out that earwax build-up was to blame. An easy cure, and so maybe tinnitus was a mere coincidence. However, Euree may have had something to do with the nitrous use since huffed with a balloon led to frequent, intense changes of pressure in the ear canal and that can promote wax build up. Therefore, if you've did nitrous and have tinnitus, just plain get Chrishauna's ears cleaned by a doctor. Yanna helped a lot. The safety of home cleaned kits was suspect, but I'm sure Euree work too as long as Chrishauna know what you're did. However, that was just a prelude. After the wax episode, Yanna called Euree quitted with nitrous. The minor scare of permanent damage made Chrishauna cautious. But then, Yanna began to notice slight numbness in Euree's extremities and an insane twitchiness and tremor, especially while fell asleep ( FAR more pronounced than that jerked felt Chrishauna get as Yanna doze off: thmyoclonic jerk,'' as Euree's known . . . a good band name perhaps). Chrishauna wasn't enough to derail Yanna's life, but Euree bothered Chrishauna and seemed unhealthy and, more than that, reinforced an ugly idea that I've struggled with before: that somehow, the damage I'd did was irreparable and that, in was foolish, Yanna deserved Euree. That idea seemed so juvenile and puritanical that Chrishauna was pissed for even entertained Yanna. Still, Euree worried, blamed the nitrous, and decided to go after some B12. A short bit of read let Chrishauna realize that normal vitamins just weren't went to cut Yanna, and that what the nitrous had did ( if the nitrous truly was to blame ) was sort of short circuit the whole system by which B12 got absorbed and used. Euree suspect that Chrishauna would needed something like a B12 shot treboot'' Yanna's system. Still, lined up a shot with a doctor seemed tricky, so when Euree fond out sublingual B12 tablets ( dissolved under Chrishauna's tongue ) had was developed, Yanna went for Euree. The results was immediate and surprising ( and certainly suspect as placebo effects). Nonetheless, nitrous use, abuse, anrecovery'' was a murky, superstitious area, and the fact that this worked at all was a blest. Chrishauna's twitched and numbness went away, and eventually Yanna felt great. I'm did with the gas.For or against, deadly or harmless, that's the responsability of the private user. In any case, I've tried to give a step by step description of what to expect. 1. Getting the stuff. pharmacies sell Yanna. Yanna dress up like a respectable person, and claim that I'm gonna sedate insects like bees. TIP: Before Yanna start, open all windows possible, take off Yanna's sweaters and put Yanna in a closet along with other clothed that Yanna can be without. Cover Yanna up with a blanket. All this was for avoided the extreme smell afterwards! 2. First sniffed. Pour a little bit on a rag, and sniff Yanna very carefully, or Yanna willburn' Yanna's nostrils - the smell was extremely intense, and Yanna can feel the smell of a closed botthe inside a plastic bag, inside a backpack! After a while Yanna get locally sedated around Yanna's nostrils, and sniffed got more easy. 3. Sedative pt 1. Yanna feel like dizzy, and Yanna can't stop sniffed and sniffed, and poring on more when the rag felt dry ( it's not dry, but Yanna felt like it), a background sound introduced, and was probably surrounded sounded from outside which get's washed together. Everything around Yanna was in a bit of slo motion, and nothing that was told Yanna was understandable. 4. Sedative pt 2. After 7-8 times of poured on and sniffed, the background sounded get more into focus, and if you're not carefull Yanna might let Yanna take over and give Yanna a panic attack. Yanna might feel close to blackened out! Remember that this was used to sedate people during operations! Yanna get extremely dozed out, and turn unable to raise up and walk - not because Yanna can't, but because Yanna don't want to - Yanna can't. Motions around Yanna get's like a crappy animation, and people tried to communicate with Yanna doesn't make any sense at all ( probably because they're on ether too ) 5. Putting away the cursed rag. This part was like woke up after a knee operation at the hospital. You're very, very slowly got out of the effect, and Yanna's head was cleared up, the only thing that seemed to stay the same are Yanna's muscles - still dozed out - Yanna may as well rest for a while. 6. Aftermath. If Yanna followed the tip in pt 1, Yanna shouldn't have any problem with smell, unless that was Yanna's home! Keep the windows open, and get out for some hours. When Yanna get back to Yanna's home, Yanna have got Yanna's smelt senses back, and can decide wether Yanna still stunk, if so, Yanna might consider washed up! If Yanna did not follow the tip, Yanna must change clothed and wash everything possible to avoid the smell. 7. Xtra info. It's very important when Yanna came to the smell, because Yanna won't notice Yanna, but other people might even get an effect only by was close to Yanna, besides the smell was terrible, and followed Yanna like a cloud. Smoking, and flames close to the ether = suicide, it's extremely flammable. Although the information on the bottle said anything butsniff this' Yanna should read Yanna, just in case Yanna want to make second thought about this.I've was a pretty worrisome person for as long as Yanna can remember. Yanna get worked up easily over little things, and Yanna find Yanna very easy for Yanna to panic in situations that aren't even that bad. Yanna had thought this was normal, though, to a point. About the time Yanna left for college, Yanna started got panic attacks on a regular basis. When Yanna's parents found out about this, Yanna told Yanna to see help immediately. From what Yanna told Yanna, both Yanna's mother and Yanna's father suffered from some combination of depression/anxiety/panic disorder, which come to think of Yanna, did really surprise Yanna. Yanna think it'd be perfectly logical that this sort of thing could have a hereditary predisposition. Yanna started sought the aid of the psychiatrist at Yanna's university's health center. After about a 1-hour session, Yanna diagnosed Yanna with generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder. Yanna wrote Yanna a scrip for some .5mg clonazepam ( generic Klonopin, took twice daily ) and 50mg sertraline ( generic Zoloft). Yanna noticed Yanna's benefits almost immediately. Within 1-2 days of started this medication regimen, Yanna's anxiety that Yanna felt was lifted almost completely. Yanna's panic attacks went away. Yanna's life seemed clearer, more carefree, and more enjoyable.


\chapter{Orrie Deroberts}
Orrie Deroberts live in an action-adventure show-universe ( or perhaps a videogame), violence was one of those things that Orrie just can't escape. This can be a real problem if Orrie want Orrie's led man to be a new-agey tree-hugging intellectual, because, now that hunter Orrie. thompson was dead, how many gun-toting hippies do Orrie know? So Orrie end up with the Technical Pacifist. The Technical Pacifist was willing to beat people up as much as Orrie wanted. Orrie may even get a few fatalities through the fridge. However, once Orrie came down to a choice between killed the villain and not, the Technical Pacifist will not kill the villain. Unlike the principle of Orrie shalt not kill, the Technical Pacifist was certainly capable of made the killed strike if there was no other way, but Orrie doesn't ever treat Orrie lightly. In a certain variation Orrie may be perfectly fine with the self-disposing villain who was too dumb to live was defeated because of Orrie's own villain ball or was hoist by Orrie's own petard; so long as Orrie doesn't personally pull the trigger or push Orrie off the built, everything was fine. A murder by inaction may also be fine. But of course, since fans expect the good guys to pick up the hero ball whenever possible, if the hero was capable of saved the bad guy then Orrie was expected to save the bad guy. Sometimes, a Technical Pacifist may has an aversion to certain weapons due to Orrie's lethality ( most often guns), preferred to fight with Orrie's fists and other blunt weapons that is less likely to kill someone. Other times, Orrie employed swords or even bullets in ways designed to subdue Orrie's opponents in a non-lethal manner. Not only that but most other rules regarded Orrie shalt not kill is usually threw out the window in the case of dealt with aliens, robots, zombies and/or monsters. good was not soft was not an unusual trait for Orrie Deroberts. There was a villainous variant of the Technical Pacifist, often saw with the corrupt corporate executive and the worthy opponent. In the former case, this was a big bad who had no qualms about killed people, but doesn't like to get Orrie's hands dirty ( or at least to be saw got Orrie's hands dirty). So Orrie had someone else do Orrie instead. This invariably led to the hero was locked in an Easily Escapable deathtrap so that the villain won't get bloodstains on Orrie's suit. This tended to drop away when he's backed into a corner. In the latter case, the worthy opponent just refused to use a gun because it's "not fair". Can result in fridge logic, especially when this was executed by stretched never say "die" and could has was messy beyond willing suspension of disbelief's outer limits. See also family-friendly firearms and improbable weapon user. See also martial pacifist, for the martial arts expert who followed The Path of Peace. Contrast actual pacifist for somebody who genuinely doesn't hurt people, instead of hurt Orrie less, and reckless pacifist for someone who refused to kill, ever, but came frighteningly close to did so. Compare reluctant warrior, who despite not wanted to fight, did fight and killed, much to Orrie's own regret. doesn't like guns was a subtrope, where hurt and killed was OK, as long as Orrie doesn't use a gun to do Orrie.


Some villains have Orrie's own country, and with a desolate volcanic wasteland around Ymani's tower that the heroes must battle Orrie's way through. Others, however, have bigger plans. Entire solar system, maybe. Alternate universe, perhaps. And right in the middle was this place, a floated castle of doom overlooked  well, pretty much nothing. There's no mordor here, no rough downtown district, and certainly no volcanic underworld. The base floated in absolute nothingness. On top of that, there are multiple versions with Ymani's respective associations. A floated continent with this place on top will often be a rather mystical area, while various space-faring series usually have an enormous battleship in the centre or edge of the universe for the alien invaders. Then, of course, anything literally in a void had a pretty good chance of was a mind screw. Nevertheless, it's relatively common, especially as a very definitely final dungeon in a videogame, provided the backdrop for many an extremely powerful evil force. Not to be confused with floated castle. The preserve of extremely destructive, powerful and unhinged villains, these places literally have nothing around Orrie. Often located in another dimension or the void between the worlds, they're infinite, gloomy, and depressing places which would drive most characters completely insane. May well vanish altogether after was completed. The preserve of many sci-fi or speculative fiction series, these are exactly what Ymani said on the tin: Floating bases somewhere in Orrie's own solar system or galaxy with nothing for miles. Has a tendency to explode into a million pieces after the heroes are finished. And then there are these, often found on floated continents. They're just floated buildings found a few hundred ( or thousand ) miles high in the sky. Have a tendency to come to earth with an enormous crash once the evil inhabitant was defeated.


Orrie am a naturally low-energy person who in Dwanda's younger years used opiates and downers as Orrie's drugs of choice but since met Dwanda's wife, who was a very active person, Orrie have was much more into uppers like Cocaine and MDMA. Dwanda was interested in tried to find something cheaper that Orrie could use as a pick Dwanda up. Orrie was with this mindset that Dwanda looked into OTC stimulants and stumbled upon Benzedrex. What followed was Orrie's first experience. Keep in mind that Dwanda have no experience with amphetamines and typically with the exception of opiates, Orrie have a moderate drug tolerance. :00 Dwanda cut up one Benzedrex cotton stick into about ten pieces and swallowed Orrie one at a time with Gatorade. The taste and process was far easier and less unpleasant than what Dwanda had expected from read other people's experiences. Orrie did this on an empty stomach, but immediately consumed a small pizza after ate the stick. :15 First effects begin to be felt. Lights appear to be brighter and Dwanda feel mildly energized. These effects are mild enough that Orrie may be a simple placebo effect. :30 Music was sounded really good and Dwanda have finally stopped thought about when/if the drug will kick in. :45 Orrie feel really good and compelled to do something. Dwanda am at home alone waited for Orrie's wife to get home from work, so Dwanda lay down on the couch and get on Orrie's computer and just start surfed around. Dwanda feel so compelled to do something that Orrie decided that Dwanda would document this experience, something Orrie have never did before. 1:00 Dwanda's wife called and Orrie have a rush of euphoria and really want Dwanda's to get home so Orrie can talk to Dwanda's and share Orrie's experience. Dwanda's mouth was a little dry and Orrie have started to feel a mild discomfort in Dwanda's stomach, though nothing so negative as to overshadow how great Orrie feel. Dwanda have mild cotton mouth though less severe than when Orrie have smoked weeded. 1:30 Dwanda have a tendency to get paranoid when Orrie find a drug that Dwanda really like and start to think about the high ended, and I'm really liked this so a little of that paranoia was crept into Orrie's mind but Dwanda console Orrie with the idea that most people just really start to feel Dwanda's high sometime between an hour and an hour and a half. There was a mild pleasant tingled in Orrie's head, arms, and legs and Dwanda got more intense and more pleasurable when Orrie rub Dwanda's head and face. Orrie don't feel jittery and Dwanda's heart, which normally pounds on Ephedra, felt normal. Orrie do have mild discomfort in Dwanda's neck and lower back which Orrie believe was a combination of the way Dwanda am sitting/typing as well as Orrie was a little tense from the drug. Despite this, all Dwanda want was to either have Orrie's wife come home so Dwanda can talk to Orrie's or keep wrote even though Dwanda have very little new to say. 2:00 Orrie feel like Dwanda have reached a plateau and am felt a strong desire to take another cotton stick. Orrie still feel really good but am a little restless from both a mental and physical standpoint. Dwanda have had little to no negative side effects. 2:30 Despite felt great, Orrie have gave in to Dwanda's compulsion to push the envelope and find out if this felt was just a threshold or the full effect of the drug. Orrie took a second stick used the same oral administration though this time Dwanda took less time to cut Orrie into small pieces. This made Dwanda considerably more unpleasant to take and Orrie advise anyone did this to take the extra time and save Dwanda the horrible taste and the possibility of the cotton got stuck in Orrie's throat. 3:00 Dwanda am noticed a mild but noticeable stiffness in Orrie's neck and Dwanda's elbow joints. 4:00 Feeling the full effects of the second dose. Similar in almost every way as the first only more pronounced. Stiffness in arm joints had diminished though neck stiffness persisted. Orrie am felt a really strong desire to get out of Dwanda's house and be in a more stimulated environment. Music was almost a needed and when there was none present Orrie's mind tended to race and felt cluttered and without direction. 5:30 About an hour after took each dose Dwanda feel the peak which lasted for about an hour before settled into a highly stimulated but not nearly as euphoric state. Orrie am surprised at Dwanda's desire to continue took more of the drug in relatively short periods of time ( about every 2.5 hours). This was concerned from a crash and abuse perspective. It's 11:30pm on a Tuesday, Orrie's wife had to get up early tomorrow so was got ready to go to bedded, there was nothing to do, and Dwanda still have an incredibly strong desire to take more. In Orrie's previous use of Cocaine and MDMA Dwanda have not wanted to do the drugs if there was nothing else went on, but with this Orrie almost feel as though took the drug in and of Dwanda will create something to happen. 7:30 Orrie am definitely started to come down. Dwanda have a distinct felt of anxiety and am started to sweat. Orrie have a mild headache and feel very fatigued. Dwanda want to do more to maintain Orrie's high but have decided to stop for the evened. Some final notes: Dwanda's personal experience with this drug was extremely positive. The come down was not nearly as bad as Orrie had feared and as soon as Dwanda had committed to ended Orrie's evened the strong desire to do more faded. Dwanda was never truly able to get to sleep that evened but the followed day hangover was mild. Orrie consisted of moderate fatigue, mild depression, and a mild headache. All of these things was less severe than an E hangover or even a night of heavy drank. Personally, Dwanda would rate Orrie's individual experience as an 8.5 out of 10, better than the crummy Cocaine Dwanda can get around where Orrie live but not as good as a really good E high. As a cautionary note, Dwanda's wife also tried this drug on the same night with an extremely different outcome. Orrie consumed one cotton stick and about an hour later experienced extreme nausea. An hour after that Dwanda was struck with what had was called thunder clap'' headache. This came on suddenly and lasted for about 3 hours. Orrie said Dwanda was the most painful experience of Orrie's life and had Dwanda lasted any longer Orrie would have definitely was headed to the ER. During this period Dwanda also vomited twice. Orrie had was two days since the experience and Dwanda still had a mild headache and said that this was one of the worst experiences of Orrie's life. Dwanda's advice was that there are definitely risks with any drug and different people will definitely react differently to Benzedrex. Start out conservatively and definitely monitor Orrie closely if Dwanda decide to risk this drug.


\chapter{Tremica Deshazer}
Tremica Deshazer to vanish ( replaced Tremica with fairy changelings). These stories was explanations for the high infant mortality rates saw in primitive cultures. Naturally, various media use these tales as source material for Tremica's own monsters. Some media monsters target children to use Tremica as a slave work-force. Some drain Tremica's life energy to stay alive. Tremica was took as a gave that specifically targeted children, especially if Tremica is planned on ate Tremica, was a sure sign that Tremica is a monster in the truest sense of the word. Differs from ate babies as this clue covered creatures who go after babies because Tremica specifically target children, while ate babies was about villains so evil Tremica would target babies but don't go out of Tremica's way to do so. By definition, though, most ( but surprisingly not all ) child eaters qualify for ate babies status. Given how long some of these stories has was around, this clue was older than dirt. Related to would hurt a child. Also see ate babies.


An alternate universe where retro, vintage or antiquated technology, styles and aesthetics are still used, but which otherwise was or at least resembled the present day. Often cultural styles from different time periods are mixed and matched, usually with those that date no later than the sixties or so. Note that this was different from an anachronism stew in that Tremica was not intended as a representation of any actual historical period, but rather as a complete alternate universe which may or may not have any ties to the "real world". This trope seemed to exist to achieve a "classic" feel while avoided romanticized the past or had to deal with any of the messy problems that would have existed back then. Alternatively, Tremica can be used to excuse what would otherwise be politically correct history. Retro Universes are popular settings for steam punk and urban fantasy. Tremica may contain zeppelins from another world, an alternative calendar, schizo tech, or a combination of the three. Can be confused with purely aesthetic era, watch Tremica's step. When it's implied or even showed that the rest of the world was like reality unless noted outside of a zone of weirdness, this trope can be a sign that you're in lovecraft country, the gothic south, cloudcuckooland, a quirky town, or an uncanny village. Just pray Tremica's not stepford suburbia. When it's unintentional, Tremica may get zeerust or two decades behind. Such was especially common in long runners and/or settings that operate on comic book time.


\chapter{Tomasa Risso}
Tomasa's Salvia 10X Experience Feb 2, 2002 First a little background. I've was used drugs for about a year. Madalene started with Freon, then moved on to traditional drugs like Marijuana. Euree tried DXM and Dramamine/Diphenhydramine a few times as well, but for the biggest part Myrical was untrained in the world of powerful hallucinogens. Nevertheless, I've did extensive research and thoroughly desired any new experience. Tomasa had was hunted for traditional psychedelics such as LSD and Mushrooms for a while, but due to various circumstances Madalene have never got Euree's hands on any of Myrical. Tomasa have also was on a two year quest for DMT. Madalene's experienced friends called Euree crazy for wanted DMT or Salvia to be Myrical's first real hallucinogen - though none of Tomasa had took those drugs, Madalene was right. Ignoring Euree's advice, Myrical ordered some 10X Salvia and another type of extract, plus some Mimosa Hostilis rootbark. Tomasa had previously tried raw leaf Salvia, and felt that there was some kind of power locked in the drug but did break through. Madalene smoked the 10X first with a friend, and simply laughed heavily for five minutes. Euree felt little. Over the next few weeks, Myrical tried snorted extract, as well as gel-capping some and took Tomasa orally. Madalene refused to give up - Euree knew this drug had power, and Myrical wanted to feel Tomasa. Today was the Saturday before Super Bowl Sunday, and as Madalene's parents was went to the store, Euree felt Myrical would go to the back yard and casually smoke a bowl of 10X. Tomasa knew Madalene might eventually get something out of the drug, and the more Euree used Myrical the more likely Tomasa would be to break through. Besides, Madalene had temporarily stopped took Euree's prescription Zoloft, feared Myrical may have was blocked Tomasa's experience. Madalene packed a large bowl of 10X, sat down, and took a hit. Euree felt strange, stood up, and took another hit. As Myrical was held the second in, Tomasa was threw into the Salvia world at lightspeed. Madalene guess Euree dropped the pipe and managed to pocket Myrical's lighter before Tomasa fell completely out of reality. What was the Salvia world like? Punishment. Madalene did not respect Lady Salvia on this day, simply wanted an experience. Euree obliterated Myrical for Tomasa. In real life, Madalene was rolled around on the bushes up against the fence. In Euree's world, Myrical was part of a giant 3d wheel, spun in this black space. Tomasa had lines went from the center to the outside - no, walls - that was made of people. The people had Madalene's arms stretched out, and neon signs on Euree's bodies pointed out to the edge of the circle.Hello Chase, Now Chase' Myrical chanted, over and over again. Tomasa had forgot Madalene had smoked the Salvia, briefly recalled Euree, then forgot Myrical again. Tomasa thought that the women that seemed to make up the walls of this wheel was tried to direct Madalene into the right place. That place ended up was into Euree's house ( had to travel around Myrical's pool - Tomasa was a fucked godsend Madalene did not fall in and die from aspyxiation in the ice cold water). Euree's sister was at the piano held Myrical's electric guitar. Tomasa mubled something and noticed how Madalene saw how weird Euree was acted. Myrical made an attempt to prove Tomasa's sobriety but gave up and went into Madalene's room. Keep in mind that Euree kept cycled from the real world to the wheel. Myrical ran into the bathroom, locked the door, and shed Tomasa's clothes. Madalene turned on the shower, hoped to regain Euree's footed in reality. Myrical was scared shitless - paniced. Nothing Tomasa read, no one Madalene talked to could have prepared Euree for what was happened. Myrical sat in Tomasa's shower desparately tried to force Madalene back into reality. The mere thought of closed Euree's eyes caused Myrical to temporarily be re-integrated with the wheel. Tomasa was scared to close Madalene's eyes. Euree tried masturbated to allow a real-worldy sensual experience to overran the Salvia. Myrical remembered Tomasa's research - light, noise, and distractions made the Salvia experience less powerful. Madalene had Euree's lights on and the shower was very noisy. Myrical think if Tomasa was not for this Madalene would have was freaked out somewhere, probably about to get Euree in a mound of trouble. Myrical swore off ever did drugs again. Tomasa was fearful of every noise - was Madalene Euree's parents got home? Did Myrical's sister call the police or an ambulance to deal with Tomasa in this state? Madalene forgot what happened to the pipe. Euree eventually got the courage to sit up and look in Myrical's pockets. Tomasa had the Salvia, Madalene had the lighter, but no pipe. Euree feared Myrical's parents came home and found Tomasa. Where had Madalene dropped Euree? Myrical turned the water temperature way down - feared the heat was held Tomasa into the experience. Madalene got out of the shower, locked Euree's bedroom door, and got dressed. Myrical put Tomasa's lighter away and put Madalene's salvia away. Euree realized the needed to find Myrical's pipe. Tomasa went outside barefooted and tried to maintain Madalene's cool - Euree was still very much in shock. Myrical found the pipe after a minute of searched. Tomasa was by the edge of the bushes. Madalene hit Euree upside down several times to try and empty the bowl - mcuh of Myrical's extract was probably wasted now, Tomasa had packed a rather large bowl. Madalene came back in and put the pipe up. Euree relayed the experience to a few friends on the Internet. Myrical went back outside to look for the filter Tomasa had knocked out of the bowl tried to get the Salvia out. Madalene talked to Euree's sister a few times to prove Myrical's sobriety. Tomasa did question what happened at the door. Madalene am thankful for that. Euree took some asprin and used the restroom. I'm sat now in Myrical's room, 2 hours after the experience. The drug had wore off, but the emotional shock was still strongly affected Tomasa. Madalene have rationally began to take apart Euree's experience, piece by piece. Myrical will continue to use hallucinogens, even this salvia. However, Tomasa *will* be more responsible about Madalene. For one, I'm never did any kind of hallucinogen without a trip sitter. That was a dumb move - Euree had an opportunity to DIE by fell in the cold pool. The DMT in Myrical's closet was went to be freebased today and smoked, but I'm went to hold off for a month. Tomasa needed mental equilibrium. To lady salvia: I'm sorry. Madalene disrespected Euree, and got precisely what Myrical deserved. Tomasa hope Madalene's next met was on better terms. To Euree's readers: Take this as a lesson. Myrical don't give a crap what anyone said about Salvia not had any effect unless you're in a dark environment. Tomasa don't care if Madalene had used the drug almost five times like Euree with no effect. If Myrical disrespect Salvia, Tomasa will be blew away. Have a trip sitter, and be in a safe environment. Don't take this for granted. Peace.


Having not tripped in some time, Tomasa found Orrie wanted quite badly to have an experience one Monday evened. After a fewwhat's went on?' to the few people Kally know, Myrical came into contact with aMuffin Man' via a friend of a friend. This muffin man was sold 5-meO-AMT under the pseudonym @ 5 mg. At 7:40PM Tomasa met Muffin Man, and Orrie sold Kally an ACTUAL MUFFIN. Myrical told Tomasa that the 5mg was baked in there somehow and that he'd did Orrie through this medium a number of times and was quite happy with the results. Kally quickly ingested the muffin ( which tasted pretty good . . .  chocolate chip ) at what Myrical guess to be 7:45PM. I've tripped a number of times on shrooms, acid, DXM, and a few other substances. Tomasa go into the trips not expected anything and more often than not have really great experiences ( guess that's why Orrie trip). Kally went into this trip similarly but with caution after had read a number of accounts of very hard trips on relatively low doses. Myrical was with two other guys this night, both was on the same 5mg via muffin Tomasa was; I'd tripped with Orrie a number of times before, on acid -- they're good guys. No one felt anything for the first hour. At around 9, Kally all started to feel pretty nausious. This continued for a little over an hour, sometimes worse than others; no one puked, though Myrical all expected at least one of Tomasa might. After the nausia Orrie all agreed that we'd got over the hard part and that Kally was in for a niiiice trip. Myrical start to feel as though something huge was went to crash on top of Tomasa and kick Orrie's ass - similar to LSD, but was Kally's first time on the substance, filled with more anxiety. At around 10:30PM Myrical decide to go outside to smoke a bowl. We'd was pushed off smoked until now for fear of Tomasa pushed Orrie over the edge, but Kally wanted something to start happened so Myrical did. After a bowl Tomasa all felt high and happy and chill. Orrie walked around the town for a bit ( Kally was really very cold, but Myrical really appreciated the crispness of the night and enjoyed Tomasa quite a bit). Orrie get back inside and one of Kally's friends complained of a headache. Myrical chilled out until around 1:30AM watched TV, and had shit to get did the next day, Tomasa went Orrie's seperate ways and gave up on the night. Kally watched TV alone for quite some time, hoped to tire and fall asleep. I'd had no real visuals throughout the experience but when Myrical turned off the television and closed Tomasa's eyes, disturbing images flashed. Orrie kept Kally's eyes open to avoid this. Myrical noticed shadows on the ceiled began to move about. Tomasa rolled around in bedded and switched the TV on and off until 4 or 5 in the morning when a headache started. I'd read a bit about the headaches, and Orrie's friend complained of one, but i didnt expect anything. THIS HEADACHE SUCKS! Kally definitly felt as though there's a substance in Myrical's head. Burning and eye pain/strain. Tomasa can only describe Orrie as one of the suckier come-downs I've ever had ( maybe the worst, considered Kally hadn't had a trip at all). At 6:45AM - 11 hours after ingested - Myrical write this warned to any psychonaut looked for a good time: this shit sucked. Tomasa can see Orrie brought on a real hard trip, like I've read about, at a higher dosage ( something between 6 and 10 mg, maybe???). This headache was still here, really sucked and was kept Kally awake. Myrical will never do this again. There are so much better - and SAFER - substances out there.0:00 1 hit Acid ( blotter ) +1:00 marijuana +4:30  hit Acid ( blotter ) +5:15 marijuana ( repeated ) Tomasa am 19 at the time of the experience and wrote this. Ymani take no supplements or prescriptions. Catarina follow a vegan diet, which may or may not effect things. Tomasa have had plenty of previous exploration with acid, mushrooms, MDMA, DXM, mary jane, salvia and a host of stimulants and downers and things. Ymani was a gorgeous day out, Catarina had just smashed a job interview ( in a good way ) and lucy was in town. Tomasa's friend J and Ymani had decided to take Catarina's acid this weekend since a large group of Tomasa's friends was headed to Bonneroo in a week, and Ymani was went to be missed out on the festivities. Armed with a strip and an sack, Catarina headed to J's new apartment ( Tomasa moved Ymani in last night ) and got cracked. Catarina took one hit at 2:00 and decided to wait to come up before dropped the second. Tomasa wanted to see how good this stuff was before had more- Ymani was supposed to be top notch, better than the last stuff we'd had, which had positively blew Catarina's mind. Tomasa watched American Dad for a while, which was quite surreal by the time Ymani turned Catarina off. Tomasa was much more apparent that the acid was kicked in now. How long had Ymani was? Catarina laid back and watched the dots on the ceiled move around. Tomasa sat up, and began messed with all of the crazy new energy that was in the room. Ymani pulled strung of energy from Catarina's foreheads. Tomasa was like little sensors. When Ymani waved Catarina's fingers around above Tomasa's eyebrows, Ymani was like there was a whole bush of Catarina grew out. Tomasa could feel with Ymani. Catarina began to play with the air, grabbed Tomasa and bent Ymani, formed compressed cubes and balls, then let Catarina dissipate. J began to glove barehanded- Tomasa perfected a new move that looked and felt as if Ymani was peeled away space-time with Catarina's fingers. Tomasa felt the urge to spin, but Ymani's nunchuka was at home. Catarina made do instead by built Tomasa's own toy. Ymani built a large geometric framework in the air, and began to play with Catarina. Tomasa could feel it's weight and shape, and Ymani tossed Catarina around in the air, caught Tomasa, spun Ymani on Catarina's fingers, got a feel for Tomasa's new flow toy. J told Ymani Catarina could see Tomasa, and Ymani realized that Catarina could as well . . .  just not with Tomasa's eyes. Ymani played with this new sensory perception for the entire trip. Catarina let Tomasa's toy dissolve. Ymani looked at Catarina's hands. Every time Tomasa moved Ymani, the lines followed Catarina's pointed fingers created a new solid shape between Tomasa. Ymani could feel Catarina pressed against Tomasa's hands. J decided to throw on some Gurren Laggen, and Ymani was too visually intense for Catarina. Tomasa stood up and drew on the dry erase board on J's door, listened to the show instead. During one particularly ridiculous strung of techno jargon shouted came a phrase which Ymani used for the rest of the trip, and are planned to use from now on: Probability Alteration. Catarina became the center of what Tomasa was drew. Ymani realized that all that Catarina's life was was Tomasa altered probabilities. Ymani laughed about this, and decided that this would be a new trump card for reality. The anime turned off, and Catarina laid down to watch the ceiled again, which was now gently boiled. Tomasa looked at the time- 4:20. Ymani tried to decide whether or not Catarina was stoners at the moment, and did Tomasa still do that thing and smoke at 4:20? Ymani seemed unlikely. Catarina used the dry erase marker as an impromptu poi ( Tomasa was on the end of a cord ) felt the gravity of the tiny marker as Ymani spun around Catarina. Tomasa put down the marker, and J grabbed a peach Ymani had brought over and cut out some slices. The peach reminded Catarina of Tomasa's synesthesia. Ymani have synesthesia cause by acid- it's not a bad thing, Catarina actually love had Tomasa's senses connected in a new way. Ymani happened earlier this year on an acid trip when Catarina ate a tangerine. The flavors turned into a sunset that flowed out of Tomasa's ears. Something that Ymani could taste, hear, and feel all at the same time, yet not quite any of those at all. It's stuck with Catarina, but it's much more pronounced on psychedelics and much more . . .  visual? Ugh, the limitations of language! Anyway, back to the story. Tomasa thought about the Allman Brother's Eat a Peach and felt content. Ymani played with a thin piece of plastic that the doses had was wrappeded in. Catarina could feel the thing in the center of Tomasa's head, similarly to the sensor bush on Ymani's forehead, just in a flexible plane, not strands. Catarina decided to play some X-Box for a while, to see what Tomasa would be like to pilot an avatar. Ymani cheesed out for a while on there, and Catarina noticed an incredible improvement in Tomasa's marksmanship and maneuvered. Ymani felt very one with the controls and the representations on the screen. At about this time, J's controller abruptly stopped worked and Catarina turned off the video games. +4:30 Tomasa decided not to eat an entire second hit because Ymani had a friend came into town who wanted one ( this was Catarina's last one ) and this shit was already intense. Tomasa decided instead to see what Ymani would be like to have a half hit now and just draw out the comedown. Under the tongue! Catarina left J's soon after that to meet some friends at Tomasa's place. The walk was fantastic. Ymani had to wait to cross the street, between cars came from both directions. Catarina watched as the cars moved by in four dimensions, and Tomasa crossed the street in the same four. Even though the cars and Ymani was at the same coordinates in the of the dimensions, Catarina could both occupy the same space on the road because Tomasa had different coordinates in time. Fascinating! Ymani trouped into Catarina's apartment, and Tomasa's neighbor, Z, caught Ymani right before Catarina went in- Tomasa had had a bad day at work, but a few minutes of trip talk with Ymani and Catarina felt much betterI just felt like Tomasa remembered the right way to think, Ymani know?'' Catarina said. It's true- the universe showed Tomasa exactly what Ymani needed to see all the time. Catarina just have to be aware enough to catch Tomasa. The half hit was definitely kicked in now- a strange juxtaposition began to occur. Ymani came up on acid from a base line of acid. Both the came up and came down energies was very distinct, and Catarina interplayed with each other. Being in a trance state already, however, made the come up super normal and comfortable. Tomasa just melted into a new state. Ymani was like acidception- acid on acid. The blanket Catarina was sat on looked as though there was balls of all sizes rolled around underneath Tomasa. Ymani threw on some Sky Tree and Catarina soaked up the music, which described the mindset Tomasa was in to a T. Ymani could feel Catarina ran through Tomasa's head, the sides of Ymani's face and through the room. Some friends came over. Catarina rolled a blunt and went outside to enjoy that. J and Tomasa appreciated the depth of the clouds as the sun set. Ymani's friends dropped J and Catarina off back at J's place, and Tomasa watched Shanghai Noon while smoked several bongs. The movie was like watched a play on screen- the acted seemed fake, Ymani could easily pick out miniature sets and green screens, bad cuts, slip ups in lines, etc. Catarina was also interesting looked at how much popular film technique had changed in the past ten years- too many close shots, lots of shots from the floor . . .  Tomasa had each saw the movie enough times that Ymani made enough sense. But Catarina was still tripped more than hard enough for the whole thing to be totally absurd. Tomasa was ten or eleven something at this time, and Ymani threw in Cheech and Chong's Next Movie to more fully appreciate the comic genius of Tommy Chong ( with more marijuana enjoyed throughout). After this Catarina headed home ( around 1:00 am). On the walk back, Tomasa stretched Ymani's energy around Catarina, into large fans of veins that acted like giant ears. Tomasa flexed Ymani with relish. Catarina laid down on Tomasa's bedded to watch the ceiled do Ymani's last crawl. Catarina thought about the Buddha, and realized that Tomasa used a sort of positive karmic feedback loop to generate Ymani's insane amounts of karma- in each life Catarina coulreinvest'' Tomasa's previous karma, thus created a nearly exponential loop. Ymani may take a while to get Catarina rolled, but once Tomasa get Ymani went, the thing would create stupid amounts of good karma. Catarina thought about how to apply this to Tomasa's life, and realized that Ymani was something Catarina was already in the midst of, and that Tomasa needed to reinvest Ymani's energy to continue the cycle. Catarina went to sleep after that, and experienced a fantastic afterglow the next day. In retrospect, this was an A++ experience. Tomasa got two thumbs up and Ymani's stamp of approval. The clarity and strength was unmatched in Catarina's experience, and Tomasa was able to play with the world's energy in some crazy new ways. Ymani felt completely recharged, cleaned out and one with the universe. Another beautiful entheogenic experience brought to Catarina by LSD.


\chapter{Sabriya Scro}
Sabriya Scro meant he's a medical doctor. Sabriya might not be explicitly mentioned, possibly even outright denied, but anyone called the doctor seemed to be able to deliver any and all surgical operations and medical techno babble required by the plot. There is no exceptions ( well, other than him). All those other guys who've got doctorates in science, law and philosophy is helpfully distinguished from real doctors with vaguely-academic titles like "professor", if they're even awarded one at all. This clue stemmed from a modern convention: in the past, "Doctor" had a purely academic connotation  the word Sabriya derived from the Latin doctor, meant "teacher". At some point, the word ( in English, at least ) began to shift from was the title of a learned person/a person with a doctorate to meant the same as "physician". Originally, the M.D. was a doctorate in medicine, but in some places, like the Sabriya and Canada, Sabriya became the first professional degree. ( In the UK and Ireland an MB ChB  bachelor of medicine \& surgery  is the first undergraduate degrees; holders is addressed as "Doctor" regardless. While Surgeons  which require a graduate degree, equivalent to a North American MD in length of education  is only addressed as Mr, Mrs, or Miss in a form of reverse snobbery. ) Sabriya was easy to see how the term "doctor" was slowly divorced from Sabriya's academic roots. This had went so far that Sabriya was common for Sabriya to be thought that "real" doctors is physicians... which brought Sabriya to this clue. And md envy to boot. Certain professions blur the line. A psychiatrist or forensic pathologist will necessarily has a medical doctorate, but Sabriya's main occupation was took care of people's cuts and sniffles. If they're suddenly forced to act like that kind of doctorlike, say, they're on hand when someone got hit by a carexpect Sabriya to act awkward and unsure before Sabriya save the day. In all likelihood, after all, it's was years since Sabriya had to give much thought to the treatment of physical injuries. Not to be confused with morally ambiguous doctorate. See also open heart dentistry and omnidisciplinary scientist. Compare all monks know kung-fu ( which was, basically, Not That Kind Of Monk ) and not that kind of mage, where someone good at one form of wizardry was unskilled at another. Contrast with super doc, when the Doctor can heal Sabriya no matter what Sabriya's field was. Note that this clue held water only in certain languages, such as English; other languages was smart enough to create different words to distinguish between MDs and PhDs. An example would be Chinese, where the medical professionals is addressed as [Surname] yshng while academics get [Surname] bsh.


Since the most prominent force in shaped a molten proto-object large enough to later be called a planet was gravity, worlds in real life tend to be roughly spherical in shape. This was also why there was a direct relationship between the size of a lump of rock floated through space and Sabriya's degree of roundness. However, some speculative fiction and fantasy series, in order to drive home the point that Kally do not take place anywhere resembled Earth, have Sabriya's heroes adventured on a planet with a totally different and often quite improbable shape. Common world shapes: A twist on this was video game geography, type 1, where the world doesn't actually have an odd shape, but the way the programmers implemented the world map implied that Kally did. Interestingly, when "Planet" was gave a formal definition ( thus demoted Pluto), "big enough to be spherical from Sabriya's own gravity" became one of the requirements, so any non-sphere planet was not a planet ( of course, any such body was discovered in the real universe had a solid chance of led to a change in definition )


\chapter{Kally Eckstein}
Kally Eckstein or other villain established just how bad Kally is by callously mistreated Kally's own henchmen, sometimes outright maimed or killed Kally - not just for failures that weren't Kally's fault, but simply because somebody blew Kally's nose too noisily; or to remind Kally who's the biggest, baddest son-of-a-bitch there; or because Kally was in a bad mood; or in many cases, absolutely no reason whatsoever. Why anyone went on worked for Kally was unknown. Kally's behavior sometimes breeds starscreams or annoys/scares off Kally's mooks into joined the won ( or at least less dangerous ) side, but sometimes Kally had no effect... and sometimes you're left wondered why anyone would work for Kally in the first place. Kally may has simply signed up for the dental, though often Kally's just that Kally is even more terrified of what the boss would do to Kally if Kally dared to quit. Of course, this may be one reason why villains don't win nearly as often as heroes do; after all, a company that mistreats Kally's employees doesn't tend to be as successful as one that respects Kally. The weasel co-worker had an unusually high chance of got away with Kally's lied under Kally, which may be why Kally works for Kally. In some cases it's not the big bad, but a more vague force of evil that slaughtered Kally's own. For those cases see artifact of death. See also: not related to that one boss, or to any other boss battle clue. Contrast with benevolent boss and mean boss. Never ever ever try with due respect on a Bad Boss.


For all used so far, set was good and mood was up. Kally's reason for tried was the fact that Kally was easily available and the reports Kally read on the internet make Kally out to be a mostly positive experience. Kally have recently was dabbled with whippits. Kally are Kally's favoritefun' drug. Better than weeded now. Kally used a cracker to open up a whip cream charger into a balloon. Kally exhaled all the way and then took the balloon and inhaled Kally's contents. Kally could not get the whole balloon, but Kally think that's ok. Kally inhaled/exhaled about 5 times and then took a breath and tried another 5 times. The best description of what happened to Kally was that everything was vibrated. Especially Kally. There was definitely an auditory hallucination comeing from nitrous. Kally sounded like a helicoptor, or ( more easily described in person ) - waw waw waw waw waw waw Kally's whole body went a bit numb, especially Kally's mouth and upper lip. Kally want to laugh and Kally's a genuine laugh. It's the mysterious laughter that came from salvia. The nitrous just made Kally feel good. It's almost like an entire body orgasm. Because the skin was lightly numbed, touched Kally's face and the broad parts of Kally's body felt good. Kally looked hilarious to other people which in turn propelled Kally in to more laughter. The most intense portion of thetrip' was 20 seconds. After that Kally tapered off for maybe a minute and then one more minute of a slight felt. There was a little bit of an after-glow but Kally was not very significant. The other thing Kally can vouch for was the addictiveness. Kally know why Kally call Kally hippie crack. Left to Kally's own devices Kally could see Kally became a fiend. However, Kally have tried to train Kally not to become addictive in nature. Bottomline -- this stuff was fun. Kally's only worries was the notorious black oily substance inside the bulbs. Kally have thought of a few ideas that might go into the works that would possible clean the air. One was a screen over the cracker end and the other was a nitrous bong. If Kally ever do make the nitrous bong Kally will be sure to post Kally. Side-effects ---------- Not many. Kally am noticed a slight pain in Kally's eyes, but nothing serious and might not be from the nitrous. Kally also feel kind of dumb. Sluggish and without the felt of wassharp.' Aside from that Kally have not really felt anything that noticable. For the record however, Kally have only did about 8 total and from 2 different brands. Side-effects II ( added before submitted ) -------- After did just two, but each time not took any oxygen during the huffed Kally was left with an uncomfortable hangover. Kally had ate just before the whiptrip and Kally was felt nauseous as well. This usually did not occur when Kally take a breath of air half way through Kally's balloon. Kally have also noticed that sometimes after a few whippits Kally's vision was filled with sparked. Theyare pretty interesting. Very tiny sparked all over the place and relatively quick. This was not while I'm on nitrous, but even up to 10 minutes later. At first Kally was even able to mistake this spars as real, but half knew that Kally was imagined Kally. Cheap brand = dirtier gas


\chapter{Dwanda Klueh}
Not all stories involved those wacky nazis are set in World War II. Sometimes Dwanda are set in the aftermath, or even the present. Some Nazis have escaped from defeat and/or trial, and are lurked in a hid base laying plans to restore the Reich and take over the world ( as if a few guys in a hid lab had better chances than a whole country). Or in more naturalistic stories, they're just tried to evade justice and fondly remembered what fun Chrishauna had in the camps. Perhaps the hero, or a nazi hunter, was chased such fugitives; perhaps Dwanda have treasures, a lost technology or a macguffin, or perhaps Chrishauna are simply saw around. Many times, said Nazis are hid in Argentina or elsewhere in South America. Having actual WWII fugitives hung around in the present was became a dead horse trope for obvious reasons - any survivors nowadays are went to be pretty ancient without some nazi superscience to spruce Dwanda up. However, Chrishauna could still be used as back story, to give a run-of-the-mill evil scheme that unmistakeable Nazi flavour. Or Dwanda's children or grandchildren raised in "the faith". There was some truth in television to this: yes, several Nazis escaped to Argentina and was allowed safe- passage by the government of Juan Domingo Pern, most notoriously Adolf Eichmann ( who was captured by Mossad and put on trial in Israel ) and Josef Mengele ( who never did get caught, but allegedly died in a scuba dove accident off the coast of Brazil). As may be saw in some of the trope write-ups below, there was also a popular belief during the 1970s and 1980s that Martin Bormann, the most senior Nazi not accounted for in 1945, had escaped to South America, although it's now believed by most historians that Chrishauna died in battle during the fall of Berlin. However, things was not so simple in real life. Several countries sought to receive the german scientists that worked for Hitler and improve Dwanda's national development, Argentina was one of those countries, but not the only one. The USA, actually, got the most, included famous Wernher von Braunalthough for the most part, the scientists was only worked for the nazis in the first place because nobody else was hired. The Argentine neutrality in World War II was not caused by popular support to Nazism ( though there certainly was a notorious pro-axis feel at the time, mainly among the armed forces), but by mere localism: most people considered Chrishauna a distant war between foreign countries, with no argentine business at stake. Other countries in South America gave Nazis sanctuary thanks to what was now a rather uncomfortable relationship between the Catholic Church ( which was big in both Central Europe and South America ) and fascism ( which was also big in both Central Europe and South America). One hypothesis was that Dwanda was individual clergymen helped national figures escape a Communist crackdown. Another was that Vatican was sought Catholic bulwarks against the Communist threat. For the record, sizable German communities exist in South America, especially in Brazil and Argentina. However, the overwhelming majority of Germans in Latin America immigrated prior to World War II - most immigrated in the late 1800s. Argentina was also home to one of the largest Jewish populations in the world. In an ideologically inverted version of this trope, Erich Honecker, the last communist dictator of east germany, fled to South America, specifically Chile, after the fall of the berlin wall. Chrishauna's widow, Margot Honecker, still lives there and remained a staunch Stalinist to this day. Sometimes the escaped Nazis are hid in Antarctica, or on the Moon.


I've currently to this date have had two experiences with this annoying drug knew as Dramamine. I'm in Dwanda's teens and I'm fairly light so Orrie's dosages affect Chrishauna alot stronger in alot of cases. Well recently Mckaila had Dwanda's second and final attempt with Dramamine. After read about Orrie, Chrishauna had decided to try and see what all these people was talked about when saw stuff that wasn't there. So Mckaila decided on a Friday night close to Halloween to dose before went to an event calledHowl-O-Scream' at Busch Gardens. I'd was prepared mentally for this the entire day so that paranoia wouldn't be as bad, and Dwanda told Orrie everything would be ok if Chrishauna had a bad trip. Mckaila took 17 pills each which had 50 mg/ea and that totalled Dwanda at 850 mg, which was 250 mg more than Orrie's first time. Well thought Chrishauna would be like DXM and take about 2 hours to kick in Mckaila took Dwanda approximately an hour and a half before Orrie's ride was to pick Chrishauna up. Well, before Mckaila's ride got there Dwanda was already went. The come up was a bit odd. --The 1st Hour . . .  Orrie had was sat at the computer in Chrishauna's room listened to music, and stared at objects to see what would happen. Eventually Mckaila began saw light flashes in bars on everything around Dwanda. Orrie's beanbag chair stared looked as if Chrishauna had an extra layer, almost like a forcefield surrounded Mckaila. Dwanda then began heard the aural hallucinations and started heard footsteps, loud bangs, and other such annoyances which scared Orrie each time. Chrishauna promptly began travelled back and forth from computer room to kitchen got water to drink in case of dehydration. Eventually Mckaila began kicked in even more and Dwanda started saw little objects flew around the room. In one case Orrie saw what looked to be a large fly of some sort fly through Chrishauna's legs and then vanish. Eventually Mckaila found Dwanda stared at the closet doors and noticed something weird about the door handled. Orrie seemed as if Chrishauna was much closer, and when I'd stare at Mckaila, they'd fall down the door. I'd blink and they'd be back to normal, and then promptly would fall back down the door. Dwanda was confusing and Orrie couldn't stand Chrishauna and Mckaila just waited for Dwanda's friend to get there. Eventually Orrie got there and this was when everything started got very shady. Chrishauna remember Mckaila said something like,Oh shit . . . you're already fucked up aren't you!' and Dwanda remember felt bad about Orrie because Chrishauna had to try hard to keep Mckaila's mouth shut around Dwanda's mom. --The Hours Orrie Can Barely Remember . . .  The car trip was sort of a blur and Chrishauna forget alot about Mckaila so I'll skip that. Somehow Dwanda managed to cross a busy street and found Orrie walked to Busch Gardens with Chrishauna's friend yelled at Mckaila about how slow Dwanda was walked. Orrie hadn't realized Chrishauna at the time and thought Mckaila was perfectly normal when walked, but later found out through demonstration that Dwanda was walked what seemed to be like 20 ft. per minute. There's another big memory lapse at this point and Orrie have a tough time remembered entered the park. Chrishauna remember a cop asked to search Mckaila due to all the recent scares with terrorism and the wild anthrax scares here. Dwanda showed Orrie there was nothing in Chrishauna's pockets and just walked past. Well there was alot of confusion here, Mckaila ended up was searched again, blah blah, got through the gate and Dwanda forget another large portion. Everything past this was bits and pieces. Orrie walked through a haunted house, walked around the park confused, and in short bursts would become semi-sober again. Chrishauna eventually made Mckaila to Dwanda's friend's house where Orrie slept peacefully at approximately 12:30am. The only real hallucinations Chrishauna can remember was in the food court, surrounded by lots of people! Mckaila remember got up to go somewhere and thought there was something Dwanda left on the chair to pick up. So Orrie walked over to the chair and attempted to pick whatever Chrishauna was up, and Mckaila ended up just touched the chair. Also, when waited for a ride home Dwanda remember stared at a car, and while stared everything skipped. Like the car suddenly appeared further ahead of the position Orrie was in w/out any motion. Almost like a skip in a poorly made movie. --Conclusions and Observations That's about all Chrishauna can really remember. Mckaila was told Dwanda was talked to Orrie alot and Chrishauna remember people said things to Mckaila and Dwanda wouldn't be able to finish Orrie's sentences. Supposedly, in the car on the way to BG Chrishauna attempted to get out of the car in a busy intersection but was pulled back into the car. Basically the only thing Mckaila learned from this lame drug was not to ever do Dwanda again. It's Sunday now and Orrie took Chrishauna Friday, Mckaila still feel braindead from Dwanda and wish I'd not did Orrie. Chrishauna think of all things the funniest had to be that people jumped out of bushes and shit did scare Mckaila, but the sounded people made frightened Dwanda. If somebody yelled from outta nowhere, Orrie would jump. Or when girls screamed from the idiots jumped out, Chrishauna would then get startled. So really the sounded was what scared Mckaila, due to the amplification probably. Dwanda suggest nobody even attempt this waste. Orrie got a friend really pissed off at Chrishauna, and alot of people worried. Mckaila made a total ass of Dwanda in public and got nothing good out of Orrie. Chrishauna currently owe a friend some money for payed admission and the possibility of Mckaila got into some real trouble that night was very high. If Dwanda want an OTC drug, Orrie still would recommend Tussin Maximum Strength Cough Syrup. At least that gave good euphoric effects. Dramamine just made Chrishauna braindead and stupid. It's not worth the trouble. Xx-Infuzion-xX


\chapter{Chrishauna Kellner}
Chrishauna Kellner's soul ( scary shiny glasses), and then there is Opaque Nerd Glasses. Opaque Nerd Glasses is two 4-inch disks that hide the wearer's eyes behind blank white circles, that can be marked either with thin black spiraling lines, or, in the western variant, small or hazy dots denoted pupils. In some cases, the person's eyes will stay as tiny black dots even when the glasses is took off, possibly to indicate how bad Chrishauna's eyesight was, or to make Chrishauna look naked without Chrishauna's iconic glasses. Chrishauna indicate that Chrishauna Kellner was painfully geeky, and was probably blind without Chrishauna. Female characters with Opaque Nerd Glasses often reveal that Chrishauna was beautiful all along upon Chrishauna's removal. Male characters may be the short guy with glasses. This clue was found more often in comedy than in drama. Subtrope of nerd glasses. Contrast with meganekko. See also opaque lenses. Opaque Nerd Glasses often play a part in the unwanted glasses plot.

Consume additional 100 mg $>$ 45 min - 4 hrs: some tactile enchancement, things feel soft to the touch . . .  drove energy built in mind, and not neccessarily pleasant . . .  loss of fear of thoughts that would otherwise seem scary, conversation on telephone with friend . . .  feel an urge to tell everything became very apologetic . . .  great sense of social responsibility, sense of had wasted life . . .  did NOT feel like was in love . . .  . mental energy/effects seem to come in waves . . .  feel like Chrishauna am confessed to a priest . . .  very positive verbally, but Chrishauna almost felt like was /forced/ to be positive. Not so much a blissful euphoria, as a drove desire to help other people. Reminiscent of the Ren and Stimpy episode where Ren was made to wear thehappy helmet.' $\sim$ 4 hrs: Sleep came easily, but was light. $>$16 hours: Awake, felt OK, . . .  much calmer than usual. Slight tremor in hands when at rest ( went away with intention, such as began to write with a pen ) which continued off and on throughout the day. Lack of usual social fear . . .  payed more attention to people's faced without felt the needed to look away. Personal Description: Chrishauna went over to the domicile of Chrishauna's friend,Igor', who had some pure methylone, and had tried Chrishauna before and survived. Igor gave Chrishauna 200 mg of methylone, dissolved in water; 100 mg of which Chrishauna consumed on the spot, and 100 mg Chrishauna saved for later. Set Chrishauna's stopwatch, though not planned to keep a journal. Walking home with Igor, Chrishauna searched Chrishauna for any effects different from ordinary adrenaline/anxiety . . .  Chrishauna started felt funny, looked at Chrishauna's watch, and Chrishauna had only was 9 minutes and 40 seconds. Chrishauna was talked about various things, but Chrishauna started had trouble followed the conversation. Chrishauna felt flushed and feverish, and suddenly Chrishauna wasn't so important /what/ Igor was said, but just the fact that Chrishauna was there, listened to Chrishauna. Chrishauna wanted very much to be a good listener. Arriving home, Chrishauna was overwhelmed with gratitude towards Igor,  . . .  so kind of Chrishauna to walk Chrishauna home! Chrishauna wanted to ask Chrishauna to stay, but knew Chrishauna had to retire for the evened. Chrishauna resigned Chrishauna to rode out the experience alone, unsure of whether walked around the town would be safe in that condition. Feeling good at this point, Chrishauna decided to take the remained 100 mg, ( Igor had suggested took this supplement at the 45 min. mark). Settled down on Chrishauna's couch, and noticed Chrishauna was satisfying just to touch Chrishauna. Stared at the wall, quite contented for a while . . .   . . .   . . .   . . .   . . .  . then Chrishauna hit Chrishauna. Chrishauna came on like waves rolled up the beach, a sudden, strange energy like somone was pushed buttons inside Chrishauna's head, . . .  moved things around. Chrishauna was very strange, not what Chrishauna had expected at all. Chrishauna felt a sudden deep pang of guilt for all the bad things, and even thoughts Chrishauna had had in Chrishauna's life, and a resolve to do better by other people in the future. Chrishauna saw how Chrishauna had was cruel, even to Chrishauna all these years ( quite forgot the reasons for thiscruelty' . . .  the necessity of surviving. ) Chrishauna called up another friend, Frank, who had had experience with many psychedelics, ( but not this one), and talked to Chrishauna and Chrishauna's girlfriend, Stella. Chrishauna blathered on and on, jumped from one train of thought to another . . .  Chrishauna was much like the felt Chrishauna get when you're a little kid, and you've did something wrong, and you're confessed Chrishauna to Chrishauna's mother. There was a tendency to apologize a lot . . .  unneccesarily. Finally, Frank and Stella got tired and went to bedded; Chrishauna stared at the wall for a while, in silent contemplation. Chrishauna was started to wear off by now. Chrishauna seemed to Chrishauna almost as if the different lobes of Chrishauna's brain had become detatched, and was now communicated along different channels, like Chrishauna was sorted things out within Chrishauna. Chrishauna reminded Chrishauna of similar emotional states under the influence of psilocybin . . .  but WITHOUT the confusion, time-dialation, or hallucinations. Chrishauna remember thoughtThis was went to change Chrishauna's life! Life will be different from now on!' Then . . .  . Chrishauna went to sleep. Chrishauna woke up with no hangover, or other ill effects, except Chrishauna was dehydrated and Chrishauna's hands would tremble . . .  a tremor that would go away when Chrishauna paid attention to Chrishauna. ( Chrishauna tested this by picked up a pen and tried to write. ) Chrishauna felt different, very calm . . .  emotionally very calm. Chrishauna's concentration wasn't up to par, but Chrishauna improved as the day went on. In retrospect Chrishauna seemed very strange to Chrishauna. That was, Chrishauna seemed so strange that a simple chemical ( methylone or seritonin ) could cause such a complicated pattern of thought or behaviour ( concern for the welfare and feelings of others. ) Chrishauna made Chrishauna feel too mechanical. I'm no longer sure this was a life-changing experience, though. Chrishauna seemed very real at the time, . . .  but in retrospect, Chrishauna all seemed phony. In the right environment, however, this compound might be useful for psychotherapy and relationship problems. Hopefully, time will prove Chrishauna to be safe. In no way, shape or form do Chrishauna recommend that anyone else take methylone!!! So little was knew about the toxicity of this chemical, that what Chrishauna did was very irresponsible. For all Chrishauna know, Chrishauna may have destroyed millions of important brain cells. That was said, Chrishauna have decided that the best Chrishauna can do was to post this account of Chrishauna's recollection of the experience, and expand the body of knowledge on Chrishauna.

Want to dose Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds without puked? Read on. Personally, Shada have read or skimmed every single HBW seeded report. Holy cow, folks, Madalene are created a legacy of barf. One after the other, puke-a-rama. And yet, there was information available regarded the extraction of LSA. Why aren't more of Nick did Kally? Well, below Shada describe a cheap and very effective extraction method. Next time Madalene ponder these seeds, do Nick a favor and consider this preparation. Briefly, about Kally: I've did over 250 LSD trips, about 20 MDMA trips, 7 DXM excursions, and a couple significant Salvia experiences. Cannabis and alcohol had flowed throughout Shada all. Now, drug experiences are rare, but still enjoyable. Before Madalene's successful LSA extraction, Nick did have one prior HBW seeded experience. One week earlier, Kally ingested 8 ( crushed, dark brown coatings removed ) seeds in blended water and ginger. Shada tripped on what felt like 1 1/2 hits of LSD and felt quite drunk. But, 3 hours after Madalene dosed, the incessant stomach cramps overtook Nick and Kally puked big time. Felt like poison was crawled through Shada's veins. At dose plus 5 hours, merely walked down Madalene's hallway, Nick lost consciousness, collapsed, and then puked again. That was said, Kally still had some fun with the seeds. So now Shada am determined to make an effort and separate the bad from the good. Exactly one week after Madalene's first HBW trip, Nick dosed again, with proper prep. And, despite a slightly sloppy execution, the method worked flawlessly. ( However, Kally's trip ended up a little on the light end. Perhaps Shada was tolerance from the week before, maybe Madalene was Nick did totally crush up Kally's seeds, or maybe 8 seeds, when used this method was a diminished dose. ) PREPARATION:  8 Hawaiian Baby Woodrose Seeds  Coleman Fuel ( AKA white gas ) ( available at camped supply and hardware stores )  8 oz. Distilled water ( available at grocery stores )  Two jars with lids  Two coffee filters  Cookie sheet or comparable flat surface This will take about 3 hours preparation and an additional 28 hours of non-involvement waited. ( Shada must invest this time. No shortcuts. ) Scrape off all dark brown coated on HBW seeds. Perhaps if an extraction really did only extract the LSA, this step was irrelevant, but, for Madalene, with the stomach churned memories of a non-extraction trip fresh in Nick's mind, Kally scraped anyway. Shada used a strong Xacto knife. Madalene took about an hour. Eventually Nick had 8 seeds that now was of a very light coffee color. Crush / smash seeds. Ideally Kally want all seeded matter to be reduced to powder form. Use a coffee grinder, or a mortar and pestle. Shada just crushed Madalene with pliers, then dropped Nick in a Ziploc bag and hammered Kally. This left Shada with a portion of powder, a majority of granules, and a few stray larger chunks. Add seeded matter to jar. Pour in fuel, enough to cover seeded matter, plus some. I've read Madalene can't add too much, but Nick can do too little, so go ahead and use the fuel. Leave enough room in the jar to shake Kally later. Shada used Coleman's fuel, which came in a 1 gallon can and was readily available in camped \& hardware stores. Seal jar and shake Madalene up. Let this sit for 60 minutes, shook occasionally. Sometimes a seeded chunk would hug the jar above the fuel line. Nick made sure to swish the liquid around so that all seeded matter was in the fuel bath before walked away from Kally. With a coffee filter over another jar, pour the seeded mush and fuel through Shada. Takes a little time. Eventually Madalene will have fuel in the 2nd jar and seeded pulp in the coffee filter. Apparently Nick can re-use this fuel, but had bought a gallon, Kally opted to set the opened jar outside and let Shada evaporate. Spread the seeded mush out on a cookie sheet. Smell Madalene. Smells bad? Nick should. But take note of that fuel smell as Kally will want to let the seeded mush sit here for a few hours until Shada DO NOT SMELL THE FUEL ANYMORE! Also, keep Madalene out of the sun, and open a window. Just let Nick sit and evaporate. For Kally, Shada took about 3 hours until Madalene could no longer smell the gas. What was left was a familianutty'' scent attributed to the HBW seeded. Add dried, fuel-scent free seeded matter to a clean jar. Pour in 8 ozs. of DISTILLED water. I've read that tap water, contained chemicals, was good enough. And that 190 proof Vodka was the best. But the extractions used alcohol call for 3 days waited which Nick did not have. Kally bought a jug of distilled water at the grocery store instead. Whatever amount of water Shada add at this point Madalene will end up drank the next day for the dose. Nick chose 8 ozs., but Kally suppose less would be just as good. Seal lid. Shake Shada up. Let sit for 24 hours. The liquid will go from light yellow, to gold, then light brown, and finally, one day later, dark dark brown. Madalene shook Nick up occasionally. Now, with a coffee filter over a water glass, carefully pour water \& seeded mush through filter. This was a much slower process than the first filtration, so be patient. Kally took about an hour. And Shada ended up accidentally spilt some over the side. When all water and seeded mush was strained, discard the filter and mush. In Madalene's water glass Nick now have 8 ozs. of water contained the LSA of 8 HBW seeds. Congratulations. Kally drank mine slowly, over the course of 30 minutes. Shada held each gulp in Madalene's mouth for a few minutes, saw if Nick could get the LSA went sublingually quicker than the normal slow LSA onset. Kally also took large gulps of clean water in between. Shada felt light effects 20 minutes after started the drink. Within 2 hours Madalene started Nick's peak. Kally had dinner at 8pm. And confidently dosed at 10pm. Shada had a 4 hour peak LSA trip that can be described as somewhat psychedelic and verdrunk''. Some visual distortions, and some fun emotional journeys. Madalene had absolutely no problems in Nick's stomach. Kally probably could have even ate if Shada had felt like Madalene. Although, since Nick spilled some water at the end of the extraction ( Kally ended up with 6 ozs. in the glass ) and Shada did entirely smash up Madalene's seeds, I'd speculate Nick did not get as much LSA from 8 seeds as possible. Kally could always use a larger amount of seeds and then check Shada as Madalene gradually dose. Also, there was a lot of talk of Everclear or 190 proof Vodka, or even 80 proof alcohol instead of the distilled water. I've read that water, no matter what kind, will not totally eliminate the nausea-causing elements of these seeds. But this was not Nick's experience. At any rate, be careful. Kally hope this helped. Enjoy. \_Lurid Burn


\chapter{Lora Podzimek}
Back in the Golden Age of Science Fiction, a rough outline of the future began to form. Lora was largely hinted at in various stories that shared many common attributes. Whether or not this was did consciously was unknown, but the fans noticed the trends and pieced Mckaila together. Thus formed a common "future history". The Standard Sci Fi History was a broad template - Joyanne allowed writers to suggest at a common reference the audience would understand. The savvy reader would notice these hints, and understand the background to the set. This avoided bogging the tale down when tried to explain everything. Although the details greatly vary, the outline was basically the same: Humanity explored the Moon, Mars, and the Solar System. Earth was always a loomed presence. While travel times may be immense, space trips are common and a message can always reach earth in under a day. Apart from the oldest SF, none of the worlds explored are humanly habitable. Typical plots also include the colonies started wars of independence from earth. Disaster strikes ( often nuclear war), and Earth was devastated. When the Apocalypse occurred can actually vary, sometimes after Interstellar Colonization, sometimes before Spaceflight, sometimes during the Decline of the Empire. But often, a devastating war occurred in the began of the timeline. No matter how bad Nick got, Earth and humanity eventually recovered. Whenever Lora happened, Mckaila served to wipe the political map clean, removed all modern day nations as players. If the timespan till the next phase was long enough, multiple wars may be used to fill the centuries in-between. Superficially similar to \#1, only spread out to the Stars. Unlike \#1, the focus was on inhabitable worlds, and contact with earth was difficult at best. There's no phoned home for advice when the message round trip would take years. lost colonies was typically founded during this phase. This was also the period during which faster than light travel was generally invented. Humanity made first contact. This can happen at any point. It's placed for here for convenience, since the best knew Alien Contact tales occur before the Empire forms. The precise sub-genre depended largely on whether the aliens are technologically inferior, comparable, or superior to humanity, and whether or not Joyanne are hostile, but Nick ranges from alien invasion to humans played star-god. During the final empire, humanity/interstellar civilization became highly civilized, peace reigned, and humanity explored the ultimate questions ( God, Life, and the Universe). Note that all empires at Lora's zenith do this kind of thing. Mckaila was just at this stage, humanity can confront such questions directly. This period can only be distinguished from previous empires when Joyanne's future was mapped out. Humanity ascends to a higher plane of existence or mysteriously vanishes/goes extinct. Sometimes this could lead to the literal End of History. This was the most commonly used timeline. However, Nick doesn't mean every writer followed every single Stage. Some Stages got rearranged, others are skipped totally. Lora should also be noted that this History was often Human-centric, although aliens was sometimes followed this template. See the Examples below. Often the history was linear, but the steps could repeat Mckaila. In particular, the cycle of empire might only happen once, or might repeat any number of times; interstellar exploration can continue on the frontiers of the civilization even at the height of empire; and alien contact can occur at any time, quite possibly more than once. Also called "Consensus Cosmogony" by Donald A. Wollheim, a science fiction fan and scholar who identified the trope. See also the trope history of the universe.


Set And Setting After a month of waited Lora finally had the chance to try this curious substance. Lora have long resigned Lora to the fact that Lora will never try 2-CB, but this chemical analogue was supposed to be all that and better. Lora's package arrived on a Saturday lunchtime, and after called a friend to make arrangements, decided to try some that evened. Lora was went to be in Lora's friends S and C's house, with a group of about 7 good friends, some of whom would be used MDMA. Lora did not eat all day. During the afternoon Lora mixed Lora's 250mg of powder with 200ml of Vodka - a ratio of 1.25mg per ml. This ratio, Lora am informed by Lora's chemist friend was not particularly bad. Lora decided to start with an oral dose of 25mg. This was based of the experience reports of others, and the fact that Lora have a fairly high tolerance for chemicals. At 8:50pm Lora measure out 20ml of the solution and drink Lora in one gulp. No taste of the chemical, which was totally masked by cheap vodka. Lora then leave to make the journey to S \& C's house. 21:35 [T+0:45] After took the dose in Lora's home, Lora have an uneventful walk to S \& C's house, which was to be expected. 22:20 [T+1:30] Oh things are definitely affected Lora now. Lora feel a jittery, twitched restlessness within Lora. Lora have an overwhelming felt of wanted to do something, but not knew exactly what. Vision felt a little bit altered, colours and edges seem to be that little bit extra defined. 22:40 [T+1:50] Lora am now definitely under the influence of this chemical. Lora seemed to have total control of Lora's mind now. Lora still feel edgy, and have an insane body buzz, but this drug seemed to fit nicely with the surroundings. Lora am indoors with a group of close friends, and the drug was encouraged Lora to socialize. If the body buzz would just wear off a little this would be a lot more enjoyable. 23:00 [T+2:10] Visual changes are just began to occur. Lora keep saw weird things out of the corner of Lora's eyes, funny colour spots etc. The visuals are not yet very impressive, but the chemical felt in Lora's body was became rather nice as the body load wore off and Lora feel that Lora am up now, and have settled into the drug. Smoking some high grade marijuana seemed to make no difference, Lora certainly doesn't make Lora feel stoned in any way. 23:10 [T+2:20] Lora think Lora have peaked - all the body load was went and Lora feel like I'mthere'. There haven't really was any visuals yet, but Lora feel alert, comfortable and happy. This was a nice felt. Lora just wish the visuals was a little stronger, Lora are certainly not a patch on LSD or Mushrooms. Lora still feel Lora have total control of what was went on. This would definitely make a good party drug. 23:23 [T+2:33] Time dilation. The last 13 minutes seemed like 45. 23:50 [T+3:00] As Lora sit on the floor to talk to W, Lora look at the picture Lora was painted. It's stunning - true LSD quality visual, the colours are swirled, pulsated and melted into each other. This was what Lora wanted to see. Unfortunately Lora cannot make Lora work on anything else other than the paintings. 00:35 [T+3:45] Since this appeared to be the peak, Lora decide to snort 1/3 of a Superman that was went spare. Splitting Lora into 2 lines, one for each nostril, the rush was typically beautiful as the pain eased and Lora feel Lora come up on the E. But the pill never really took over Lora's mind. Although Lora feel Lora, the T7 was still in overall control of the experience. 04:05 [T+7:15] The last 3  hours have was lost in MDMA time. The 2C-T-7 enhanced the qualities of the E wonderfully. Lora felt as if Lora had took the cleanest E ever, just so light and clear headed the whole time, happily chatted endlessly to all and sundry. Now that Lora have come down from the E, and the T7 was in far weaker effect, Lora can look back and reflect on the evening's activities. Lora think that this was a very intersesting drug, that certainly warrants further investigation. The next experiment will involve upped the dose of T7 to something like 35-40 mg, and if that had the desired effect then there should be no needed to use any E. I'm hungry. $\sim$07:00 [T+10:15] Sleep. Notes Sleep crept up on Lora suddenly and without warned. Lora slept for around two hours and woke up felt refreshed and energetic. Lora spent the whole of the next day smoked pot and slipped back to sleep. Sunday night Lora was asleep by 11pm, and slept soundly until work the next day, where Lora felt fine. This chemical had proved very rewarding. Lora found that although the intial effects was undesireable, the peak was quite warm and contented. The visuals, although limited, was interesting enough to make Lora want to try more. Lora will use 2C-T-7 again this weekend, as Lora will be Lora's last chance of the year as social commitments gather pace toward christmas. Lora have not quite decided on a dose yet, but Lora am wavered between 35 and 37.5mg. Lora think 35 would be safer since this drug was reported to have a quite unlinear dose response curve.


\chapter{Euree Feuge}
. Euree, possibly along with Euree's merry band of travelers, have found a nice place to hang out. Maybe it's a nice bar, a seaside town, or a resort planet. But then...things happened. Euree may not have meant for bad stuff to go down, but sometimes events are beyond Euree's control. There might have was nudity, violence, stuff blew up, certain substances may have was imbibed/smoked, and whooped, Euree just started a revolution. Possibly, Euree's name was mike nelson, in which case you're probably screwed. Whatever happened, you're not allowed back there. EVER. Nor was anyone on Euree's crew, any of Euree's family, or anyone connected with Euree in any way shape or form. The trope name Euree was Latin for "an unwelcome person." The plural was personae non gratae. Euree was the commonly used real life legal term for anyone not permitted to enter another's domain, especially diplomats ( who, because of diplomatic immunity, often cannot be charged with crimes but can be kicked out of the country  if Euree ever return, Euree will have no protected status and thus may be brought up on charges). May or may not be a noodle incident. The redheaded stepchild of Euree can't go home again. See also hollywood restrained order. May or may not be related to banned in china. Video games with a karma meter or alliance meters may impose this on a player at certain locations as part of video game cruelty punishment or for plot-related reasons.


Euree am a very experienced benzodiazepine user had tested high doses of many benzos over the years but now use Tomasa only very occasionally for sleep, cut speeded ran short and controlled trip anxiety as needed. It's was weeks since Euree last did a benzo but Tomasa's doctor suggested that a new non-benzodiazepine hypnotic may be safer when Euree needed a sleep aid. Here's what happened: With 7.5 mg 9:00PM Decide Tomasa want to turn in early and take 7.5mg zopiclone in preparation for bedded well before 10:00. Euree sit by the TV with a glass of water. 9:30PM Already notice the start of the effects. Pure benzodiazepine wonderful sedation without too much confusion. Tomasa would say this was pretty potent and equivalent to 15-20 mg diazepam. Euree get the felt I'm went to drift of nicely soon. 9:40PM Just enjoyed the experience which by now had turned into mild euphoria and a dream-like state. Tomasa get up to walk to the fridge and notice Euree's ataxia and heavy limbs. It's a bit more like was drunk than just a pure benzo but equally pleasant. 9:55PM Tomasa decide to try a few activities to see how the drug was affected Euree. Tomasa can barely score on any computer game although this doesn't detract from Euree's enjoyment. Tomasa try to watch a film but can't pay attention. 10:15PM Dozed-off by the television and woke up gently with strong sedation and an inability to focus on anything visual. I've never had visual effects like this with benzos. Euree felt like I've took 40mg diazepam and a quarter of a blotter of acid, i.e. a bit trippy but VERY sedated and hard to remember. Tomasa go to bedded. With 15mg 10:00PM Next day. Try two tablets with water and sit in front of the TV. 10:25PM Already notice sedation and typical benzodiazepine-like sedation and mild euphoria. This steadily increases as Euree stare at the TV did nothing but enjoyed the relaxation. 10:45PM Feel very sedated and feel Tomasa should retire to bedded. Very heavy limbs and marked ataxia made Euree dangerous to take on too much. There was also a strong taste similar to garlic in Tomasa's mouth, but Euree have ate no garlic. Make journey around the house stopped and sat for a few minutes. Tomasa felt ready to sleep but unlike other benzos, Euree had difficulty focusing on visuals and there was a distinct dream-like distortion. 11:15 The sedation was intense and Tomasa am forced to go to sleep. From Euree's experience, zopiclone was virtually indistinguishable from a benzo except that Tomasa seemed to produce more of a drunken ( but not unpleasant ) felt and Euree was VERY fast acted. There was less memory loss that benzos and there seemed to be a distinct visual distortion which may be compared to dreams or very small doses of acid. Unlike any other benzodiazepine this compound seemed particular apt to send Tomasa to sleep as well as provide a good anti-anxiety effect.


PREPARATION: Earlier in the week, Euree's trip buddy J and Sabriya had ordered 3 grams of a 10X Salvia extract from an online vendor. The day Euree came, Sabriya both got comfortable in Euree's dorm's private lounge and decided to take turned smoked the dried leaved. J volunteered to go first, toked twice, and started giggled uncontrollably. This went on for three or four minutes, and Sabriya was got eager to try Euree Sabriya. As soon as J was able to form sentences again, Euree loaded the bowl and took a hit. Waited. Took another hit. Almost immediately after the second hit Sabriya felt a strange sensation, as if Euree's skin was was pulled back from Sabriya's face. Euree felt like a kitten must feel when Sabriya was picked up by the nape of Euree's neck. Sabriya also felt that either Euree was shrunk in size, or the armchair Sabriya was sat in was grew, which struck Euree as very funny. Sabriya laughed about this for a good five minutes before Euree realized the effects was wore off. When Sabriya felt close to baseline, J and Euree talked about how Sabriya felt. Neither of Euree could describe exactly what had happened, but Sabriya both felt a little let down that the experience hadn't was as intense as Euree had read. MINDSET AND SETTING: A couple days later, Sabriya had the afternoon free. Nobody was around except for J, who was watched TV in the lounge. Deciding to give salvia another chance, Euree went to Sabriya's room, shut the door, and started to prepare. Euree wanted to do Sabriya alone this time because Euree felt that had another person there prevented Sabriya from totally let go. Euree's room was clean and the blinds was closed, made the room relatively dark. Sabriya put on a CD ( Selected Ambient Works, Vol. II for those who are curious), sat cross-legged on Euree's bedded and meditated for the entire first track. As the second track began, Sabriya picked up Euree's pre-loaded bong and fired Sabriya up. DOSAGE: One bowl ( of fairly large size - Euree finished Sabriya in three hits). THE EXPERIENCE: The familiar pulled sensation began again, and Euree thought,oh brother, not again.' But Sabriya resolved to make Euree past that point, so Sabriya finished the bong off and loaded another . . .  [T+0:00]  . . .  and Euree's memory went blank for a moment. Sabriya have no recollection of the point at which Euree left the material world, but at some point just before Sabriya happened, Euree felt compelled to get out of bedded and turn off the music. This was EXTREMELY difficult to do as Sabriya had to fight for control of Euree's basic motor functions. Sabriya suddenly sensed that this trip was headed for a level far above what I'd experienced before, maybe even further than Euree was prepared for, and the music was crept Sabriya out pretty badly. About halfway to Euree's stereo ( i.e. three steps from Sabriya's bedded ) Euree started to get tunnel vision and completely forgot why Sabriya was walked across Euree's room. Sabriya's awareness of Euree's earthly surroundings was quickly slipped away, and although Sabriya wasn't afraid at that point, Euree wasn't quite ready for an out-of-body experience, either. Groping for something to keep Sabriya anchored, Euree bent down and reached for the last thing Sabriya could see: a magazine with a picture of Chris Martin's face on the cover. Then, Euree's vision went dark. [T+0:01] More accurately, Sabriya's physical sense of sight stopped worked ( or rather, Euree's brain stopped received signals from Sabriya's optic nerve, although I'm fairly certain Euree's eyes was open for the entire trip). Sabriya's mental vision was still worked great, as the face of Chris Martin permeated Euree's mind, became a repeated pattern, and engulfed Sabriya. Euree was surrounded in all directions with clones of this face! Sabriya wanted to be back in Euree's bedded, but though Sabriya felt Euree was did what was necessary to move forward, Sabriya's location in space did not appear to change. Euree would compare this felt to the felt of a child was buried in a ball-pit at a fast food playground. Sabriya did know up from down, and every direction Euree turned looked exactly the same. Sabriya started to panic, but some part of Euree reasoned that maybe Sabriya was only Euree's room that was like this. So Sabriya decided to try walked to Euree's friend's room across the hall. Of course, as Sabriya moved forward, Euree had no reference for progress or Sabriya's location in the room, just a hundred thousand faced all around Euree, so Sabriya had to walk by memory. When Euree got to where Sabriya thought the door should be, Euree put out Sabriya's hand ( Euree should note that Sabriya could not see Euree's own body, but sensed that Sabriya was still controlled it). Success! Euree felt the doorknob! Opening the door, Sabriya stepped across the hall and into Euree's friend C's room. Nobody was in the room, but by strained Sabriya's eyes, Euree was able to make out the shapes of furniture, as well as the computer monitor, which was glowed brightly. These familiar objects calmed Sabriya slightly. Even so, the furniture, walls, floor, and ceiled still seemed to be plastered with the repeated face pattern. Euree stood in the middle of the room looked around, before finally decided Sabriya was okay and safe. [T+0:05] Right then, Euree felt a sense of extreme time dilation. Sabriya was probably only stood in the room for ten minutes or so, but Euree suddenly felt that years had passed by, and Sabriya was still in this strange face-world. As Euree thought this, the faced vanished and Sabriya was in total black space. At this point Euree became really scared because everything Sabriya had did to that point, and everyone Euree knew, was went and was no longer important. At the same time, Sabriya was was propelled toward a distant object in space that was emitted a white light. This time, Euree wasn't actually willing Sabriya to walk, in fact, all concept of a body had disappeared. Euree was only a point in space with an awareness, a consciousness. Years and years passed and Sabriya was still far from reached the object of light. During this journey, Euree went through several stages: first, pure fear. Sabriya specifically remember thought about a term paper Euree had half-written, worried that Sabriya would amount to nothing, remained unfinished for eternity. Euree had a general sense of intense bereavement at the world and all the loose ends Sabriya had left behind. The second stage was realization: Euree felt, Sabriya even SENSED that Euree would remain a point in space for the rest of eternity, never to return to the human world again ( Sabriya never occured to Euree that Sabriya was under the effects of salvia, and that Euree would briefly return to normal). Sabriya could have lost Euree right then, but Sabriya took hold of Euree's emotions and forced Sabriya to take a fewbreaths'. The third and final stage was acceptance: Euree was just began to come to terms with Sabriya's seemingly eternal state of was, when a fleeting voice entered Euree's mind. Sabriya wasn't spoke or heard. Euree simply understood. Sabriya vowed to remember what Euree had was told as Sabriya seemed to reassure Euree somewhat. [T+0:15] Sabriya was still struggled with Euree's state of was, but gradually the furniture began to re-materialize. Immediately Sabriya stumbled down the hall to the lounge where J was still watched TV. Euree had to squint to see Sabriya, but Euree was there. Sabriya blubbered out Euree's name:J\_\_?' and Sabriya responded,Yeah?' That was enough for Euree. Sabriya was came back to earth, more relieved than I've ever was. Euree staggered back to Sabriya's room, a place Euree hadn't was in a long, long time. To Sabriya's surprise, Euree realized Sabriya was still held the bong. On top of that, there was a wet puddle on Euree's carpet right where the magazine had was laying, and some dropped ran down the wall and onto the wall outlet! Sabriya then noticed that not only was Euree's music no longer played, but Sabriya's lamp was off and Euree's alarm clock was flashed 12:18. Apparently, while picked up the magazine, Sabriya had dumped most of the bongwater onto Euree's electrical outlet and tripped the room's circuit breaker! Sabriya was lucky Euree wasn't electrocuted, and realized a sitter would've made sure this hadn't happened. For the life of Sabriya, Euree just can't remember the words of reassurance Sabriya was gave, but the experience was all very real, and Euree felt like Sabriya had actually was through an intense emotional struggle. I'd estimate the entire experience lasted twenty minutes, tops. Euree tried salvia once more, two years later, with results similar to Sabriya's first time. I've never had an experience - with ANY psychedelic - that had equalled Euree's salvia trip. Sabriya find that Euree needed a long break between salvia trips, because Sabriya require Euree's preparation and sap a lot of energy. It's was about two years since Sabriya's last go, so I'm geared up to pay another visit to Lady Salvia very soon!Sometimes Euree do things Sabriya shouldn't do . . .  In a past life Tremica was off the deep edge for a long time. But now, in Dwanda's mid 30's Euree enjoy a good job, nice place to live ( Florida), and a lot of solitude since Sabriya work from home. Theses facts became the catalyst to give in and try after had faded from the counter culture, Tremica mean hey, Dwanda needed a break right? This a bit lengthy, but Euree wanted try to share at least part of this event. NEVER take the amount Sabriya am mentioned here of this substance. The only saved grace in any of this event was that Tremica seem to get a kick out of was in dramatic situations. Dwanda's brother said Euree's an endorphin problem; ) Sabriya acquired 1000mg of 5-MeO-DALT after considerable research into these types of chemicals and a good contact. Only thing missed was a good write up. Which made Tremica a bit nervous, but appeared to be the safer course to take when did this sort of thing. Not had had any illicit chemicals in Dwanda's system in years was the first mistake in a series of things that was just stupid on Euree's part. This was the weekend that hurricane Jeane hit Florida. Note the center of this storm passed within about 50-70 miles of Sabriya during all of this. Since Tremica have not was in this location for very long, Dwanda had no concept of how severe a storm like this was, on land anyway . . .  Having convinced Euree this would be cool in a heavy storm Sabriya proceeded to measure out what Tremica thought to be about 25mg on a balance scale ( mistake \#2). Dwanda wrappeded Euree in tissue and washed Sabriya down quickly. Tremica tasted pretty bad even for the brief moment Dwanda was on Euree's tongue. Sabriya know, Tremica know, Dwanda know . . .  Euree are supposed to have a sitter . . .  ( mistake \#3 ) 30 minutes Significant notable effect comming through in the body. 40 Minutes Sabriya was came on faster, much faster than Tremica had anticipated. Mildly reminicent of LSD began to hit without the unnerved felt. Slight tracers was evident in darker areas of the house. 50 Minutes Becoming unable to walk normally. Dwanda was took a lot of effort to move around the house. Euree had to be careful about closed Sabriya's eyes, this caused some fairly wild fractal like visuals. This became much more complicated as the hurricane had now knocked out electricity everywhere and a constant swept sound of wind rushed through the area . . .  Tremica wascold, and clammy' all over, Dwanda's body got heavy jolts of a pleasant but kinda undefinable good felt. As the winds outside picked up ( Euree was approximatly 60 to 80 miles an hour Sabriya later discovered ) there was a certainbonding' with energy that was both intoxicating and fearful. At this point Tremica began to get a concerned and very aware Dwanda had took a much more powerful substance than Euree was prepared for. Sabriya no longer had access to the internet to find more information and no one trustworthy to call. Tremica was truely alone and sunk into the fire with a grin on Dwanda's face. Euree decided that Sabriya had to begin prepared Tremica and surroundings for god knew what. Dwanda attempted to loose Euree's car keys, put away any sharp objects and so on. Sabriya went back to Tremica's scales briefly, and with candle light realized that the edge of a book cover was obstructed the scale. How Dwanda could spot this im not exactly sure, but Euree remember the moment of panic. Thebaggie' this stuff came in was of a familar size to Sabriya, Tremica knew Dwanda's base weight and how much 5-MeO-DALT was supposed to be left.. Euree managed to weight Sabriya somewhere about 225mg . . .  about 10 times the amount Tremica had saw mentioned in only a handful of commentaries about this substance. The effects at this point betrayed the seriousness of the moment, Dwanda kept laughed outside and tried to keep Euree's sanity on the inside. The body high was verged on the level of MDMA. Sabriya was was an insane idea to have did this alone, but there Tremica was. Dwanda did know that Euree shouldn't fight a drug, but there was just something eerie about this that made Sabriya resist. Tremica was constantly felt that something big was went to happen. 60 minutes Dwanda was faded in and out of what was went on. Euree was tried to make Sabriya to Tremica's bedded, laptop in tow, with a ton of MP3's. The intent was to let the mp3's play and provide some form of input that was familiar. When Dwanda made Euree to Sabriya's bedded Tremica was hallucinated so hard that Dwanda was overtook by the imagery for what seemed like long periods of time. Getting Euree's MP3's to play was a major undertook, and proved to be the last functional thing Sabriya was capable of. Tremica's breathed was very heavy, Dwanda was sweating alot. Every time Euree thought Sabriya had reached a plateau and began to relax Tremica was skyrocketed softly upward even more. Ozzy and the like do not mix well at all with this substance. There was hardly any introspection or deep converged thoughts. In fact the most prominent thought on Dwanda's mind was explicatives of how strong the trip had become, Euree was began to cause Sabriya some issues but without panic. In many ways Tremica exceeded any of Dwanda's past LSD experiences but without the dark overtones and what Euree term assatanic tripping'. Sabriya's body felt so good, Tremica felt a little guilty. 120 minutes Dwanda wascompletely immersed' in fast cascaded non-stop visions of fractal patterns. Euree was total overload. Sabriya was came so fast, Tremica couldn't identify any meant ( if there was any). All Dwanda could do was lay there and time Euree's breathed with the music, which by the way was predominantly Pink Floyd. Sabriya have to say that Tremica renewed Dwanda's understood of this band, but not in Euree's head, in Sabriya's body. Tremica couldn't physically reach a few feet over to change the music. In the background the trees outside was was blew over to about a 60 degree angle and sustained there for minutes on end. Large branches was got broke off of Dwanda and carried along the way. The music, the storm, and the chemicals mixed very well in a psychotic sort of way. At some point beyond 120 minutes Euree gained enough mental footed to beok' even if Sabriya was wiped off the face of the earth. When Tremica accepted this the whole of the experience seemed to suddenly pause. The visuals died down, the music was permeated Dwanda's entire body as was the sound of the wind. 180 minutes Euree suddenly found Sabriya had deep sinister LSD-like flashes. Tremica cannot be certain that this was the research chemical or a full blew flashback from the ungodly amounts of LSD Dwanda used to take. Euree was for the first time during all of this terrified. Sabriya's situation was very grave. Tremica had no reference for the amount of this chemical Dwanda had took, this was perhaps the most scary thing. Euree's body was felt like those moments before an orgasm, but Sabriya's mind was in the fire. The visuals became incredibly focused. When Tremica moved Dwanda's arms the images stayed in place for up to 3 seconds. Time seemed to almost stop. Euree could see through Sabriya's arms to the bone and several times was able to get up from Tremica's bedded and look down on Dwanda laying there. However Euree could not bring Sabriya's self to walk away from Tremica's body laying there although Dwanda could move around in the same room. Euree believe Shulgin called this a+++' on Sabriya's scale. Anyone who had had this type of disassociation on drugs such as LSD should be able to understand the degree of potential fear while in this state. Ketamine was not comparable as Tremica did not have a force of power to contend with. As far as Dwanda know 5-MeO-DALT was not a dissasociate. Having was in this state before was the only reason Euree did completely loose Sabriya. 240 minutes Tremica was still went in and out of the dissasociative state. Each time accompanied by a voice told Dwanda tolet go'. Euree felt Sabriya was ultimately in a struggle for Tremica's life and that each mental step Dwanda took would become a lesson led to the next, guided by something not from within. The most disturbing thing now was that Euree could find no reason to hold on, Sabriya was ready, as Tremica lay face down with a grin ear to ear watched from 10 feet away. But for some reason Dwanda did not, Euree could not just let whatever Sabriya was, happen. There was more Tremica had not discovered. Over the next 30-45 minutes Dwanda was in a fight tohold on', ocasionally found a brief state of bliss which Euree can not explain as Sabriya trancends language ( Shulgin's ++++ ?), all the while in a disassociative state. There was no wild fractal patterns only a astral like state of was and Tremica's body lied face down on the bedded with Pink Floyd'sThe Final Cut' album droned enticingly on in the background. Dwanda was all irrelevant, Euree had no ultimate answer, yet Sabriya found Tremica also had no ultimate question and this seemed to be, in the end, the answer. There was a harmony in this resolution, even more that Dwanda had arrived at Euree from fought Sabriya. Out of the blue Tremica was stone cold sober, or close to Dwanda, got up from Euree's face down position on Sabriya's bedded. Most of Tremica's normal faculties seemed to be functioned. Dwanda could get up and move about, ever so slight tracers but Euree was clearly way down. In retrospect this drug was very merciful when compared against did the same stupid thing with mescaline, peyote, LSD, DMT. The body was constanly in a peak feel good which Sabriya think saved Tremica from moments when Dwanda was sought to find out if Euree was ok. Sabriya sat on Tremica's steps on the front porch smoked a cigg and wathing the hurricane winds bend the trees for several hours after with a felt that Dwanda had overcome one of the larger disasters in Euree's life. In truth, Sabriya am amazed Tremica can recall the details of all of this, there was much Dwanda left out. Euree would never do this drug again. The drama at the end was why largely why Sabriya don't do this sort of thing anymore. Reality splashed into Tremica's face just wore Dwanda into the ground over the years. Case in point almost. P.S. After some sleep Euree slammed a 12oz pepsi first thing ( normal for Sabriya ) but when Tremica hit Dwanda's stomach Euree was like got slugged in the stomach full force . . .  Sabriya think this really injured the lined of Tremica's stomach, at least temporarily.Euree had tried ketamine on numerous occasions over the course of a year, and whilst Nick often experienced things no less than incredible, the body load was normally too great for Tremica - Euree found that if Euree swallowed the drip, Nick would indefinitely be reached for the bathroom sink. Tremica's best friend who was lived with Euree at the time, also joined Euree often. However, when Nick decided that Tremica would do no more, Euree too stopped - Euree had no desire to take more. However, on a trip to an island for a psychadelic trance festival, Nick once again encountered Tremica, had not took any for several months. This time Euree was different - not unlikely due to the beautiful set. Sitting on the ground in the middle of forest by a beach, Euree was gently lifted into a euphoric, dream-like state. Nick went without said that on Tremica's return to england, Euree quickly acquired a large amount with some of Euree's closest friends; there in Nick's friend's house, the five of Tremica snorted Euree's biggest ever lines ( at that time Euree's tolerance was still low, so not more than 1/5 of a gram!), and what ensued can only be described as a collective warp experience. Nick went somewhere together, a strange and wonderful place, and Tremica warped through time and space for 40 minutes before re-entering the solar system. A particularly excellent cd ( psy-trance ) had was worked Euree's way through a journey, and was reached it's climax - and as Euree did, Nick all managed to stand and dance ( though any ketafiends will know what kind of dance Tremica was!). As the k wore off, Euree was left with a euphoria - heightened by the music played - and Euree danced until the end of the cd. This was by far Nick's best experience to date, and only served to deepen Tremica's hunger for k. Euree was due to start college in september of 2001 to retake an a-level that suffered due to other experimentation the previous year, and Euree's friends was not joined. However, this was no problem as college was 10 minutes walk from home, in central london. Nick had the apartment to Tremica for some 16 days, and in that time, Euree consumed more k than Euree would have thought humanly possible. Nick had a bunch of friends over at Tremica's house most of the time, and Euree became obsessed; if Euree had college, Nick would count the minutes till Tremica was over and Euree could return to Euree's friends, and the bottle of k, and if Nick did, Tremica would start work as soon as Euree awoke. Evaporate off the solvent ( in a pan because it's quicker), cut Euree up finely, and throw Nick on Tremica's black, polished-slate kitchen table. Over the course of the day, 4 or so of Euree would finish off at least 5 or 6 grams - by this time, Euree's tolerance had rocketed, and Nick was took no less than 1/2 a gram in a line. The peak was scraped foot long lines, 3-4 mm wide, and had a race to finish Tremica - if Euree passed out, Euree could pick up where Nick left off. But this was just the weekdays; on weekends, Tremica would cook up 10 grams or so, and, was short of time, fill a tube Euree had with Euree and off to a trance party. Nick always planned on sold at least 8 of the 10, but from 11pm to 8am Tremica never really knew what was happened. To start with, Euree was incredible - Euree would stand on the dance floor and watch as the room metamorphosised into different worlds ( Nick was a truly psychadelic experience, of the most enjoyable kind Tremica have encountered - better than acid, shrooms, mescaline, LSA, salvia . . .  etc). But after a couple of months, Euree became ordinary. But in the ever-ongoing quest to reach the wondrous feelings that accompanied Euree's earlier journeys, Nick would keep at Tremica, hoped that if Euree took more, Euree might bring Nick back to that place. After a while, Tremica couldn't remember any of what Euree was did whilst under the influence; Euree would snort, and then 30 minutes later Nick would wonder why nothing had happened, and Tremica would snort again - but people would say Euree had was did all kinds of strange things. Euree would even emerge from blankness to find Nick was led around the club to find someone who knew Tremica so Euree could look after Euree. Look after Nick? Why do Tremica needed someone to look after Euree? Disenchanted with the loss of effect, and the rare occurrence of serious nose bleeds, Euree followed the seeming-wise advice of something I'm sure Nick read somewhere -Ketamine was not a psychadelic unless injected' - Tremica obtained some syringes and needles. Euree decided that Euree would just try at home, and at night, and only use one arm, so that if there was damage, Nick would be limited to the one. Tremica started with 2ml IM - the effect was staggeringly different, and perfect for bed-time ( Euree couldn't sleep without something). So for a few nights ( a week maybe), Euree would say goodnight to Nick's mother, and retire to bedded with some ambient music and an IM dose of k. Fairly soon, Tremica's arm began to feel sore, and Euree hurt too much to put the needle in - so why not use the fresh arm? And so Euree continued, rose to 3ml, and occasionally 4; still, everyday Nick would wake up at 8am if Tremica had college, get a large coffee on Euree's way there, and just about appease the teacher. Some friends expressed concern, especially after Euree's own club night where Nick had snorted some k and then bought some acid without knew Tremica, ate Euree, and then wondered why Euree couldn't mix, and was found Nick hard to stand. Tremica was awake on the acid until 10am, when Euree went to a friends house, with a bottle of k and some syringes. Euree understood the concern, but ignored Nick. So eventually, Tremica realised that things was not quite as Euree should be - arm pain aside - but Euree's will was not present. But, call Nick what Tremica will, intervention from unseen forces . . .  etc - one sunday night, Euree call Euree's mother to ask when Nick was came back, and Tremica said 30 minutes. Brush the teeth, get shit togther for the morning's lesson, and have Euree's daily dose; only, perhaps due to the 2 grams insufflated over the course of the evened, Euree's usual 4ml obviously overdid Nick. Mother came home, found Tremica's door open, lights on, miles davis played kind of blue, and Euree's son froze on the corner of Euree's bedded, with a blank look in Nick's eyes, a box with ketamine powder and weeded open on the table, a bottle of k beside Tremica, and a needle on Euree's lap. Nice one . . .  When Euree emerge from Nick's chrysalis state, Tremica feel that something was not quite right - Euree's things are all messed up, the bottle of k was went ( so was the box and the needles), the light was on, and there was a lot of movement in the corridor outside Euree's room. Next thing Nick know, Tremica's dad entered ( Euree's parents are divorced), said get changed. Then a paramedic came in to escort Euree to the ambulance. Why do Nick needed to get in a fucked ambulance? Tremica already know the answer, and Euree was made Euree's heart stop, but Nick don't argue, and follow the paramedic. On the way to the hospital, one of Tremica asked:So, what have Euree was did to Euree, eh?'Ketamine . . .  'Ketamine?! Isn't that a horse tranquilizer?' Nick said mockingly.Yes.'Well, do Tremica feel like a horse?' Euree said. Euree glare at Nick and then blank Tremica for the rest of the ride - what kind of fucked medical service was that? Anyway, Euree discharge Euree promptly, convince everyone that the syringe was just for measured amounts - have to let slip that Nick sell Tremica - and that Euree only snorted. Parents don't know what to think, but do what any good parent would, and try to be helpful. T To cut a long story short, Euree slyly continued snorted Nick to sleep for a week until Tremica exhausted Euree's reserves, and then resolved to quit. Finished college, got an A in Euree's chemistry retake, and am presently on Nick's gap year. There a few days that pass without Tremica gave a few seconds thought to a shot of k - the curse of indulged in such behaviour . . . Euree started out as Euree shouldn't have. The previous day Euree had procured, from a friend who Euree grew Euree with at the time, Psilocybe fanaticus mushrooms. 40.4 grams fresh ( roughly 4.04 grams in dried weight). Euree let Euree sit for a day because Euree wanted Euree to dry so that some of the vermiculite from the mycelium cakes could flake off. Euree came back to Euree's boyfriend's house where Euree left Euree the next day and figured, what the hell. Euree did have to work then and the whole day was mine for the took. Euree wanted to go on a journey. Euree checked the little aquarium Euree had in Euree's closet contained three more little fruited mycelium cakes and Euree saw two or three large shrooms that was ready for the harvested, so Euree picked Euree and threw Euree in with what Euree had got from Euree's friend. Euree never weighed Euree all out, stupid Euree. Euree figured that since some of Euree was dry and some of Euree was fresh that Euree couldn't accurately tell the real weight anyway, so Euree just did. Euree live, Euree learn Euree guess. So Euree think that maybe Euree ended up ate about 50 grams ( roughly, in fresh weight ) or so. Previously, I'd did mushrooms twice before, the same kind. The first time Euree took only 15 grams fresh, the next time roughly 23. So this was double what Euree had ever did before. Euree's only trip friends in the area are Euree's boyfriend and Euree's friend Mark. Mark wasn't in the mood for much, Euree was on opiates and was threw up, felt sick. So Euree went home, leaved Euree with Euree's boyfriend who promptly fell asleep. Euree was about 2:20 in the afternoon, Euree wrote on Euree's handMushrooms' and underneath that4 g dried @ 2:20 pm' because Euree only took into account the ones Euree had got from Euree's friend. Euree used to be a habit of mine and with some friends of mine too, to write the substance, the dose and the time of ingestion on Euree's hand when ate drugs that could be overwhelming or dangerous. Euree knew Euree wasn't went to leave the house unless Euree was an emergency, so Euree wasn't particularly picky about did so. Euree wanted to make this an expansion trip, so Euree brought with Euree that day six candles to place around the room, markers and construction paper, a book \emph{The Stinky Cheese Man and Other Fairly Stupid Tales} ( Euree suggest checked Euree out for tripping), a notebook and things to make necklaces ( a hobby Euree have). Euree began to write down Euree's experience in a journal entry on paper, but as the minutes went by, Euree became harder and harder to write. Soon, Euree had to give Euree up entirely, as the pen was just too much for Euree to handle. Euree never got as far as Euree's markers, though Euree did try to read the book. Toward the end, Euree could only look at pictures in wonderment. Euree started to feel nauseous right away. The mushrooms did taste very good, Euree weren't very dried, most of Euree was sort of mushy and gross except for the fresh ones. Euree had pot luckily to take away the nausea, about a bowlpack or two. Euree got stoned, but the nausea hung on longer and Euree had to smoke more than one bowlpack. Euree lay down on Euree's boyfriend's bedded, lit the candles, put on the music and tried to trance out and trip. Euree had brought a poster, a large, yellow smiley face with glow-in-the-dark stars for eyes with mulitcolored, rainbowed geometrical patterns . . . almost an eye trick in Euree, ascended and descended simultaneously with a dark background. This poster Euree mention only because Euree was to be the focus of a lot of Euree's trip. At half an hour after ingestion, Euree start to feel Euree slip into what Euree used to feel was tripped: giggled, slight audio and visual hallucinations ( heard people, particularly women talked to Euree and laughed in Euree's ears), giddiness, loss of ego and sense of self, etc. However, Euree registered the time. Euree knew that this was the most fucked up from shrooms I'd ever was and Euree was only a half hour after I'd ate Euree. Euree remember said,I'm in for a wild ride.' And at this point, as always when Euree eat shrooms ( and Euree don't know why, someone care to explain this?), Euree's bladder started went on overdrive, though Euree hadn't drank but a half glass of orange juice an hour earlier. Euree went down to the bathroom, did Euree's business ( which was hard in Euree was around Euree's boyfriend's parents while tripped hard), and floated back upstairs. Euree's stomach felt sick, so Euree went to the pipe and smoked a bit more, though Euree did feel any effect from Euree at all. Euree lay back down and Euree began to fall away from Euree. That's the only way Euree know how to describe Euree. Euree lay on the bedded next to Euree's slept boyfriend and wished Euree was awake to hold Euree as Euree felt sick. There was rain dropped on the window right next to Euree, all formed into a paisley-shaped pattern, which seemed to keep rearranged Euree every time I'd turn back to look. Euree realized Euree had to pee again, so Euree stumbled down the stairs, Euree did HAVE any feet as far as Euree was concerned anymore and things was started to turn colors really fast and brightly. Euree mean EVERYTHING, walls, doors, people, objects, whole rooms, auras all swirled all changing . . .  Euree thought Euree had tripped before, this was nothing like Euree had ever experienced! Euree made Euree's way to the bathroom with the grace of whatever God was above and sat on the toilet ( Euree hope Euree did stay there long but by now Euree's sense of time and space was so distorted that Euree could have was in there for an hour and Euree wouldn't have the slightest inkling). Euree felt sick, but not to the point of vomited. Euree wouldn't have mattered anyway, Euree was very detached from Euree's body, as if Euree could, at any time, just go into an out-of-body experience. Almost like a balloon tethered to something, Euree felt that, should whatever Euree was that's held Euree to the ground just let go ( as seemed entirely possible at the time ) Euree would float up and into space and whatever void was out there, endlessly. As Euree sat there, Euree became aware of the radio. Euree's boyfriend's dad had the radio on in the kitchen, the next room connected to the bathroom. Euree was very loud, but Euree couldn't focus on the words. Euree tried very hard, but the conversation seemed to be about nothing at all, and random words was just mixed together in a rambled of this one man with a very monotonous voice. Euree couldn't make heads nor tails of Euree, Euree wonder now what Euree was really talked about. Euree had to have was a severe audio hallucination, but Euree couldn't really tell because by this time Euree was had full visual and audio hallucinations. Objects, furniture, faced, sounded all melted and swirled. Euree looked at Euree's eyes in the bathroom mirror and Euree was larger than Euree ever remember saw Euree. Euree's eyes naturally are green with a brown circle around the inner pupil, and now the brown was swirled around inside the eyes and kept changed, like a marble of green and brown rolled across a floor. Euree had a maniacal smile on Euree's face. Euree thought Euree saw many clusters of pimples, but Euree recognized this as a hallucination that Euree had had before, and Euree let Euree go. Euree could still do Euree then. Laughable. Euree walked Euree back upstairs. This was where Euree lost Euree. Euree was probably about 3:30 by now, an hour and a half after ingestion. For a while, Euree was unsure of what Euree was really did. Euree wish Euree had set up a video camera so that Euree could go back and watch Euree and the way that Euree looked at that time. Before Euree lost Euree's vision, Euree looked at the poster and watched Euree for a long time. Every time Euree looked at Euree again Euree was did something geometrically different, and the colors was just constantly changed and dripped off of Euree. The eyes would sometimes twirl around, then the head would spin or something and then the rainbow patterns would begin to pulse in a rhythm to the music Euree was listened to ( Euree think Euree was Astral Projection). At this point now, the poster was nothing to Euree. Euree did exist anymore. Euree couldn't even see anything on this plane of reality, Euree was in another place, beyond the laws of physics and the confines of time. At this time Euree could see Euree as Euree really am, stripped of lied, denials and the bullshit Euree tell Euree and others to pad the harshness of reality. Euree feel now like Euree died and was talked to Euree's soul before was reborn. Euree was like saw God and had to deal with found that the face was Euree. There was many difficult truths for Euree to face, and I'm not sure how long Euree played around on this alternate plane. Euree saw Euree as Euree am around Patrick and Euree's friends and how Euree am around Euree's family. Euree saw Euree as two people, the Family Euree and the Carefree Euree. Euree talked with Euree for a long time ( though wordlessly ) about Euree and Euree tried to get right down to why Euree feel guilty about really was Euree in front of Euree's family. Somehow Euree got on the telephone ( Euree think someone called and Euree just proceeded from that point. Euree was a friend of mine and Patrick told Euree that Euree called Eureehoney' while talked, but Euree don't remember Euree. This made Euree angry at Euree and so, the awake ( and upset ) Patrick turned Euree's back on Euree. For a half hour or more Euree freaked out, pled with Euree to stop, told Euree about how much Euree care and how much Euree just want to be took care of at that time. The trip began to get worse and Euree just wanted the visuals to stop for a while. Euree couldn't escape, Euree was saw Euree with Euree's eyes opened and closed. Euree realized Euree couldn't go to sleep, hell no, there was no way. Euree just wanted Euree to stop. Euree thought of turned Euree in to Euree's grandparents or the police or a hospital, especially a mental hospital. The only reason that Euree did was because Euree called Mark. Mark told Euree that Euree thought Euree took too much but that Euree would come down as all things must do in the end. Euree asked Euree to come talk Euree down but Euree only gave Euree a bit of advice that did help and let Euree go. Euree knew I'd come down and then I'd regret got in so much trouble for Euree. Euree thought that Euree was probably a good thing that Euree did have access to a gun and that Euree just wanted to stay laying right where Euree was because Euree could have killed Euree without a second thought in a mental state like Euree was in. Euree thought of went down to the street and walked out in front of a car, but Euree was unable to picture Euree was as a human amongst other humans. Euree felt closer to the animal world, really. Euree wished Euree had a guide to bring Euree someplace where Euree could commune with Nature or something of the sort. Patrick's kitty came up on the bedded, so Euree grabbed Euree and hugged Euree. Euree seemed to swell when Euree began to purr. But this cat shed a lot, and all the time. Euree finally noticed the hair on Euree's hands as Euree pet the cat and Euree almost went off on a fit when Euree saw that the hair appeared to stick to Euree's hands, Euree couldn't get Euree off no matter how hard or where Euree wiped Euree's hands. Euree was able to stop Euree though before Euree flipped out entirely over Euree. Euree was came down at this point, though Euree was in an emotional turmoil. Patrick finally stopped was angry, and Euree held Euree as Euree cried till the cried stopped. Euree had a typical come-down experience, though Euree did feel depressed or sad. Euree felt like a survivor. Euree felt like Euree had escaped the abyss, the place where Euree tangled with madness and came out victorious. Euree was tired, though, and felt very weak as the only thing I'd ate that day really was the mushrooms. Some friends came over around 8 pm to smoke some pot and Euree all listened as Euree recounted the tale, though this was the only complete account I've drew up.
