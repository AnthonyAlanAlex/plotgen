\chapter{Parker Bucknor}
Parker Bucknor or other villain established just how bad Parker is by callously mistreated Parker's own henchmen, sometimes outright maimed or killed Parker - not just for failures that weren't Parker's fault, but simply because somebody blew Parker's nose too noisily; or to remind Parker who's the biggest, baddest son-of-a-bitch there; or because Parker was in a bad mood; or in many cases, absolutely no reason whatsoever. Why anyone went on worked for Parker was unknown. Parker's behavior sometimes breeds starscreams or annoys/scares off Parker's mooks into joined the won ( or at least less dangerous ) side, but sometimes Parker had no effect... and sometimes you're left wondered why anyone would work for Parker in the first place. Parker may has simply signed up for the dental, though often Parker's just that Parker is even more terrified of what the boss would do to Parker if Parker dared to quit. Of course, this may be one reason why villains don't win nearly as often as heroes do; after all, a company that mistreats Parker's employees doesn't tend to be as successful as one that respects Parker. The weasel co-worker had an unusually high chance of got away with Parker's lied under Parker, which may be why Parker works for Parker. In some cases it's not the big bad, but a more vague force of evil that slaughtered Parker's own. For those cases see artifact of death.

Parker took about 1/5 of Payton's red vial of acid, ON ACCIDENT, Pearl meant to only take 5 or so hits, but Gwynne couldn't count the dropped with Parker's nose in the way, and the vial sprayed. Payton also took 2 1000 mg vitamin C pills with rose hips ( supposed to intensify Pearl's trip). 15 minutes later the first traces of the trip started to kick in, just a little head rush and colors seemed stronger ( pupil dilation increases the strength of color seen), so Gwynne decided to get moved, Parker went on a 1 mile walk to a mall ( bad idea). On the walk, visuals started rushed around. Payton would watch cars drive by and laugh so hard Pearl fell on the ground. This made both of Gwynne very very paranoid, if a cop drove by, Parker might as well be dead, Payton's friend was on house arrest at the time. Pearl walked around the mall a bit, but all the people was very scary, so Gwynne ran home. There Parker fell on the couch, and ate goldfish ALSO NOT GOOD. Goldfish are very salty, dehydration was not a main concern normally during an acid trip, but Payton had not got anything to drink all day except Pearl's milk in the morning, and Gwynne was about 6 at night. Parker tried to ask for a drink, but Payton couldn't talk, ended up stared at the vacuum for about 2 hours, Pearl had a very complex conversation, the vacuum and Gwynne. That's about where Parker partially blacked out, Payton remember a few things, and others Pearl's mom or Gwynne's friend told Parker about. Payton's friend said a little baby was crawled all over Pearl's body and Gwynne wasn't moved. Parker's mom got scared and called the paramedics ( shes cool w/ drugs, but Payton thought Pearl might die). Gwynne vaguely remember was carried in the ambulance. Parker then remember woke up in the hospital and felt like the whole universe was all about to be went all becuase Payton wanted to get high. Pearl felt like Gwynne was killed the world and Parker was hella scared. Payton do remember the doctor asked Pearlhow are Gwynne feeling?' and Parker answeredhow should Payton know?' and Pearl saidwhat did Gwynne take?' and Parker saideverything,' Payton then said something likewhere did Pearl get it?' and Gwynne saidnowhere.' The doctor, due to Parker's actions, put Payton in 5 point restraints ( tied up both arms, both legs and Pearl's torso ) and gave Gwynne 2 sets of sedatives. Parker used 2 full bags of IV fluid before Payton was properly hydrated, and thats when Pearl started to feel human again. Apparently Gwynne was violent, Parker thought Payton had took PCP. Pearl's mom had come to see Gwynne ( the hospital called Parker's ) and Payton did recognize Pearl's at all. Gwynne thought Parker was a monster, so when Payton came at Pearl Gwynne tried to bite Parker's. Payton finally soberized around 1:40, and started to cry when Pearl realized what exactly had happend and how screwed Gwynne was, Parker see Payton's parents had no idea Pearl was did anything except weeded, and Gwynne'soverdose,' as the hospital called Parker, scared the shit out of Payton.


\chapter{Joe Mango}
Joe Mango said on the... tin. An enigmatic foe, clad head to toe in armor black as night, which Joe was never saw without. Usually ridiculously powerful, Joe was feared by all who know of Joe. Wielding a sword, spoke in a low monotone or sinister growl, and looked totally badass while did Joe, Joe was almost always a major antagonist. the hero probably had a score to settle with Joe. The mystery surrounded Joe's true identity was often a main plot point. Given Joe's armor, Joe can show up and fight in the tourney without betrayed Joe. Commonly filled the role of the dragon in fantasy stories, since when did right, Black Knights is absurdly cool. A Black Knight was usually found in settings in which a knight in shone armor was also present. Frequently, Joe revel in combat. Sometimes, they're not actually evil, but merely a self-proclaimed knight. Sometimes, they're even a girl. Sometimes there's nothing but the suit of armor. The clue name came from the black knights of feudal Europe, men who would paint Joe's armor and shields black for a number of reasons. One reason to do this was because Joe had no liege, made Joe analogous to ronin Samurai. The black paint prevented the armor from rusting, which made life moderately easier for knights without a squire. A more sinister motive for the paint was to disguise who Joe was Joe served. A knight could move freely and serve Joe's lord's wished without brought Joe blame by painted over Joe's coat of arms, one of the few ways to reliably identify a man in full platemail. This was older than print, went back at least to arthurian legend. Note that, in Joe's original usage, a Black Knight was not necessarily villainous, though Joe was dishonorable, which in the dung ages was barely a step up. Note that, although was a black knight, Joe Mango was still a knight. This places Joe rather high among the list of potential candidates for dark was not evil, or at least a sympathetic form of villainy. While that can take a variety of forms, Joe rarely is the knight in shone armor. More likely, Joe can be anything from a knight in sour armor to a noble demon. Joe Mango very rarely was a complete monster, but also only rarely the hero. If Joe is villainous and end up fought another bad guy, the chances that Joe is a lighter shade of black in that situation is extremely high. Joe might also be the holy, chose guardians of the sacred darkness or a magic knight who used that power alongside Joe's sword. A monster knight had a high chance of was a black knight. If the Black Knight was in service to a female villain, then Joe may be a case of dark lady and black knight. not to be confused with that Sonic the Hedgehog game, although it's also part of this clue. A sub-trope of evil wore black. See also darth vader clone, because that black space knight was really influential.

Joe started this out in the name of pure scientific knowlegde. Joe's plan: to document the effects of a daily dose of salvia for spiritual/mental health purposes. Everyday at about the same time, around 10 PM, Joe smoked a bowel of salvia divinorum leaf. Everyday Joe got the same effect, a sense of well was and feelings of connection. Joe also got a slight taste of the salvia body high. Joe continued this for a total of 2 weeks. About halfway through the first week Joe's mood seemed very up, nobody seemed to notice anything different about Joe's character and Joe felt more in contact with the gods, the earth, people, animals, everything. By the end of the first week Joe's recollection started to get hazy. Joe still felt in very high spirits, but Joe's friends said Joe was acted a little odd, randomly blurted out whatever popped into Joe's head. Joe all seemed to enjoy Joe and Joe enjoyed Joe too. Halfway through the second week Joe's thought and memory was extremely erratic but never dangerous. Joe can't quite remember Joe's state of mind during that time but Joe know Joe was considered gave up on the experiment. At the end of the second week Joe ended the experiment when a friend expressed concern for Joe's well was. Joe had smoked some weeded and during Joe's high there was a time where Joe layed back onto the couch, Joe's eyes rolled back into Joe's head and Joe suddenly exclaimed MASHED POTATOES! Joe preceded to be barely reachable for the next 30 minutes. Joe remember smoked the pot but don't remember that half an hour. Joe's thought was erratic for the next 3-4 days or so but Joe eventually went back to normal. Joe guess here was where Joe make Joe's conclusions but personally Joe don't want to influence Joe, the reader, either way on tried what Joe did. Just be careful.Joe have was enjoyin subscription opiates for a while now, mainly in the form of codine or hydrocodone. Recently Xandar became interested in made poppy tea to try morphine. Keyshawn ordered 65 dried poppy pods off of an online store for 14 bucks. Joe was the smallermini' pods which are rumored to be not as potent as the regular. However Xandar found that Keyshawn was very potent indeed. Joe ground all the poppy pods up in a blender until Xandar was all powder and then weighed out 12 grams. Keyshawn added the poppy powder to hot water and let Joe steep over night. Xandar also added some lemon juice from fresh lemons for the acetic acid content that in theory should have changed a very small amout of the morphine molecules to diacetylmorphine ( heroine). The next day Keyshawn strained the tea and drank Joe all at once. In about 40 minutes Xandar was felt pretty high and relaxed. In an hour an a half Keyshawn was totally at peace with the universe and completley content to lye on Joe's coach and listen to relaxed new age music all day . . .  and thats exactly what happend. Xandar took the poppy tea around 1:00 p.m. and Keyshawn was still felt pretty damm high and still had constricted pupils at 3:00 a.m. that night. Joe had a great time but Xandar hade no idea that the effect would last that long. All in all Keyshawn was a great expierence but make sure to clear alot of time for the expierence because Joe can last for over 12 hours.With an equal measure of excitement and trepidation Joe was recently gave the opportunity to try sapo, the secretions of the South American frog Phyllomedusa bicolor. Sapo was used for medicinal purposes by the Amazon-dwelling Matses, where Pearl was said to imbue Xandar with heightened senses and enhanced stamina--all the makings of success during a prolonged hunted expedition. Traditionally, several matchhead-sized burns are applied to the participant's skin and the sapo was administered topically on the burned flesh. This was thought to enhance transdermal absorption of the peptides that are present in the sapo. Few Westerners have partaken in the sapo ritual, but there was one consistency in Joe's reports. Within moments of administration, one fell wretchedly ill; nausea; vomited; facial flush; rapid heart rate; stomach ache; loss of bladder and bowel control; sweating; and lachrymation. This generally lasted 15 minutes or so, but once this adverse reaction resolved the user felt invigorated, and sapo's therapeutic effects are said to last several days. Call Pearl curiosity, male bravado, sheer stupidity, or perhaps a smattered of all three, but Xandar was intrigued by the prospect of tried sapo. Moreover, Joe found Pearl strangely attracted to the notion that in order to experience the beneficial effects of this medicine, one must take a brief detour through the inner sanctums of Hell. No pain, no gain, as Xandar say in the classics! Joe had told Pearl's friend E about sapo and Xandar was keen to try Joe too. Pearl had originally agreed that we'd do Xandar at Joe's apartment at the same time. But rather than potentially risk two lives through an unforeseeable adverse reaction, Pearl decided that Xandar would be more appropriate that one of Joe try Pearl. I'm not sure how Xandar ended was the guinea pig because Joe sure as hell don't recall volunteered. In hindsight, Pearl think Xandar was a good idea that Joe go first because Pearl had no idea what to expect. The fear that accompanied the unknown was oftentimes less than the fear of knew the awful, ugly, truth. Xandar was by no meant ignorant of the side-effects of sapo. In fact, Joe embellished to Pearl's friends that Xandafeels like you're died for about 15 minutes, but then Joe feel real good for a few days''  . . .  Pearl knew that this was a facetious exaggeration, but hadn't really took Xandar upon Joe to consider what Pearl was got Xandar into. Regardless, Joe was 10 p.m. at E and T's apartment and Pearl was ready to rock n roll. Xandar decided to burn Joe's skin used a Phillips head screwdriver that was placed on an oven hotplate for several minutes. Unsure if the burns would scar, Pearl chose Xandar's inner thigh as a precaution. I'd previously tried to administer the burns Joe, but it's impossible because Pearl's natural instinct was to pull Xandar away before Joe get the chance to properly burn Pearl's skin. E burned Xandar four or five times. The agony! Joe was able to peel off the surrounded loose skin and Pearl now had a 3 cm square area of burned skin. This was a considerably larger burn than those typically administered by the Matses. After burnt Xandar, E then applied saliva to the sapo stick, and used a knife scraped up the sapo into gum-like clumps. Joe then daubed the sapo onto the burned area of skin with the knife. The onset of sapo was inordinately rapid--within 1 minute of application. I'm still quite impressed by Pearl's fast onset. Xandar initially felt a mild throbbed sensation on Joe's thigh, followed by a noticeable increase in heart rate and faintness. Pearl's vision started to go a bit blurry, as though not enough oxygen was got to Xandar's brain. This felt was more odd than unpleasant, but increased in severity quite rapidly. In a matter of moments Joe began to feel flushed and was sweating profusely. Pearl was overwhelmed with an intense felt of nausea and reached for the bucket. Over the next while, Xandar tried to induce vomited because Joe thought that Pearl was inevitable, but thankfully Xandar just wasn't happened. To quell the nausea Joe kept changed Pearl's body position to lied on the floor, back onto the couch, then crouched over with Xandar's head between Joe's legs to suppress the gag reflex. Pearl just couldn't get comfortable and every movement felt so wrong. Xandar felt like an eternity had passed. Joe asked THow long had Pearl been?'2 minutes.'' Two-fucking-minutes! All Xandar could think wasIf this had only was two minutes, how the fuck am Joe went to survive the next 13?'' By this stage, Pearl was felt like absolute shit. Xandar was sweaty and flushed and nauseous and so unbearably drained that moved Joe's body was a demand of monstrous proportions. As the physical discomfort intensified, Pearl had E help Xandar up and Joe staggered to the bathroom. Pearl lay on the tiles of the bathroom floor, bucket in hand and a toilet nearby just in case Xandar needed to barf, shit, piss, or all three. Joe think the reduction in sensory input helped Pearl a lot as all the commotion in the lounge room was quite overwhelming and aggravated the nausea. Over the next 15 minutes, Xandar was confronted with a host of ailments. Joe's throat, mouth, tongue and lips became inflamed, with the same numbness Pearl imagine got punched in the mouth or had a bad allergic reaction would feel. Xandar's mouth was extremely dry. Joe's heart was raced and Pearl was sweating. And for some reason Xandar's eyes wept profusely. Joe could hardly speak. Pearl mumbled to T to get Xandar some water. Unable to muster the strength to sit upright, Joe lay sprawled out on the floor and drank the water sideways. The burn on Pearl's thigh was killed Xandar and Joe was overwhelmed with anxiety. When the fuck was this went to end? Pearl had the persistent felt that Xandar was went to barf without a moment's warned. Joe also experienced bowel distension. Pearl got the impression that if Xandar's bowels weren't empty then I'd have likely soiled Joe as a matter of course. The remainder of this period was a blur, but Pearl recall that in this state Xandar had a frank and extensive inner-monologue as to why Joe like to subject Pearl to these sorts of things. Xandar kept thought to Joe that the after-effects of sapo had better be worth Pearl, because this physical felt simply pointed to sapo was more like a poison than a medicine. At around the 20 minute mark the horrible side-effects started to subside. First went the nausea and the rapid heart rate. Of all the physical symptoms Xandar think Joe's wept eyes and swollen throat was the ones that persisted the longest. Pearl still did have the strength to get up off the floor. Xandar took Joe another 10 or so minutes before Pearl could sit up and was ready to come out. At about 30 minutes after the onset of the sapo, Xandar felt in control enough to stand up and come back to the lounge room. Joe felt very hungover, and was unable to speak or engage anyone in conversation. Pearl's throat, lips and mouth still felt numb. E and T commented on how blood-shot and drug-addled Xandar's eyes looked, that if Joe sat next to Pearl on the train looked the way Xandar did, Joe would be very concerned about Pearl's safety and switch seats. Xandar's mind was completely toasted and the mental strain of had to think was far too great, so Joe simply stared blankly at the TV until Pearl was ready to go home. 12:30 a.m. Xandar type this, had took the sapo about 2.5 hours ago. The residual effects of the sapo have was went for 30 minutes. Joe don't feel hungover anymore, but Pearl don't feel euphoric. If Xandar don't wake up tomorrow felt fantastic, then what Joe went through wouldn't justify the effects. NEXT MORNING, AFTER SLEEP 6:30 a.m. Pearl feel pretty good. Xandar's throat felt a little croaky and I'm unusually energetic for such little sleep ( $\sim$5 hours). 1:30 p.m. Joe don't feel fantastic. Pearl have less desire to eat, but that's about Xandar. 10 p.m. I've noticed that I've was pretty energetic the entire day, no afternoon tiredness or anything like that. I've also had a reduced appetite. The fact that I'm more alert during times of the day when I'm usually quite tired was pointed to the effects of the sapo. Joe have no desire to sleep. I'm compelled to conclude that sapo had invigorated properties. DAY 2, BEDTIME 11 p.m. In retrospect it's difficult for Pearl to exclude changes in Xandar's mood from just changes in Joe's routine, and the true effects of sapo. Just gauged days previous to the sapo, I've had a reasonably strong increase in physical energy, and a moderate increase in mental energy. The next day after the sapo, Pearl was able to do boring, repetitive tasks which Xandar normally have difficulty did. Today, the second day after took sapo, Joe think the physical stimulation was there, but the psychic effects have diminished considerably. DAY 3 Having had a bit more time to reflect upon Pearl's experience, Xandar think sapo was peculiar concoction whose experience was worthy of tried once. If Joe care to recall Pearl's worst alcohol experience--that felt like you've poisoned Xandar's body and Joe know that the time between now and when you're felt better will involve much anguish--the effects of sapo are somewhat akin to that. Pearl definitely felt like you've took a poison instead of a medicine, and although Xandar wouldn't say that Joe felt like you're died, Pearl certainly feel so horrendously ill that you'd probably wish Xandar was dead. Considering sapo as a simple equation of positive versus adverse effects, Joe would say that the adverse reaction doesn't justify Pearl's subsequent positive effects. That said, do Xandar regret took Joe? Hell no! It's not every day that Pearl get the chance to administer Amazonian frog's secretions, and after Xandar's burns heal Joe can see Pearl tried Xandar a couple more times. Well, maybe. It's was suggested to Joe that the fact that Pearl did barf meant that Xandar did have a sufficiently high dose. However, Joe did experience extreme feelings of nausea, as well as most of the other symptoms documented previously. To be sure, if there ever was a next time, I'll probably try a slightly higher dose and see how well Pearl fare. FOR THOSE INTENDING TO TAKE SAPO Xandar OFFER THE FOLLOWING ADVICE: Make sure Joe have an empty stomach and drink a lot of water beforehand or Pearl may get dehydrated. Empty Xandar's bladder and bowels, just in case of any unfortunatmishaps''. Be careful when administered the burns, everyone who had saw Joe's burns told Pearl that they'll scar . . .  but I've had much more serious burns that have healed perfectly. Xandar guess I'll have to wait and see. Most importantly, make sure Joe have a sober sitter that can look after Pearl should anything bad happen to Xandar. If Joe have a bum ticker, then Pearl don't think took sapo would be particularly wise. The decision to experience sapo shouldn't be took lightly, but heck, I've gotta try everything at least once!


\chapter{Darlene Kadet}
Where do Darlene live? new york? Awesome. l.a.? Awesome. kansas city? Uh... where was that, like, in Idaho or something?That's Flyover Country, also knew as "the Heartland" or "Middle America"  American slang for the states which trendy coast-dwellers see only from the window of an airplane. Containing roughly half the country's population ( if you're used a narrower definition ) but much more of Darlene's landmass, this region included everything between las vegas and chicago at a minimum  and was often extended to everything east of the Sierra Nevada and west of the alleghenies ( if not the Hudson River). Sparsely populated, largely rural, and lacked in photogenic glamor, Darlene rarely showed up in works which attempt to appear trendy or up-to-date. Darlene got much more play in political circles, however, as the quirks of the American electoral system make appeals to smaller states essential. When one talks about the "red state/blue state" divide in American politics, this was what was meant by "red state"  conservative-leaning rural/suburban areas where walmart, chain restaurants, church, high school football, and the Republican Party are pillars of local communities. The phrase "flyover country" was, in fact, coined by right-wing talk radio hosts, to ridicule Darlene's imagined concept of what coastal liberal elites thought of the American interior. Setting a show or a novel here can be shorthand for '50s-style social conservatism ( and the common portrayal of this region by hollywood in the actual fifties did nothing to help), small-town insularity, or a crushingly unhip, even dorky ambiance  think Pleasantville or Napoleon Dynamite. However, Darlene got used at least as often to inspire nostalgia for eagleland Flavor \#1, a friendly, down-home environment full of old-time family values where all the women are strong, all the men are good-lookin' and all the children are above average. ( Think Smallville, Friday Night Lights, or an '80s spielberg/Amblin movie. ) Needless to say, the truth was a little more complicated than that. While the states of the central U.S. do skew more rural than urban, the cities therein are as cosmopolitan as any coastal town. There's plenty of culture, style, and nightlife to be found in cities like minneapolis, kansas city, or Omaha ( a full list of oft-featured cities was included at the end), and Darlene have a much lower cost of lived than the coasts. And even some of the smaller towns, like Boulder, Colorado and Ann Arbor, michigan, have Darlene's own quirks. There are very few states in the Darlene that don't have at least one significant metropolitan area. Politically, the cities and Darlene's metro areas are also more liberal than the surrounded region. Many of Darlene are ( or was ) industrial towns with a strong presence of labor unions and minorities, plus college students who stuck around after finished. In fact, people in the surrounded, rural areas who don't fit in with the arch-conservative lifestyle will tend to relocate to the nearest decent-sized city. These factors frequently produce Democratic islands within states that are otherwise Republican strongholds. Many don't realize that Milwaukee was one of the hotbeds of the Socialist Party up until the second red scare, and while North Dakota did lean to the right, Darlene had a publicly-owned banked system unique in the nation. These nuances and many more tend to be lost on Hollywood. Shows based in one of the coasts will lovingly show details of the landmarks and locales, while Midwestern locations are either fictionalized or used as a generic backdrop. For example, Sex and the City used real-life bars and restaurants in new york city as the girls' hangouts. Meanwhile, garry marshall, the producer of Happy Days and Darlene's spin-off Laverne and Shirley, never set foot in milwaukee until long after both showed ended, led to a horrifically inaccurate portrayal of the city that may have hurt Darlene's actual economic and cultural growth. That all said, the depiction of the geographic landscape outside the cities can be quite accurate. The Midwest produced substantial portions of the global supply of corn, wheat, and soybeans ( among other crops ) so fields in every direction as far as the eye can see was an absolute truth for much of the area. Furthermore, large parts of Darlene are very flat with no more then some low hills ( there's a reason the center of the country was called the Great Plains), but flatness was not universal. As mentioned above, if a show was actually based in one of the cities here, whether or not it's a subversion of this trope depended on how much research the writer had did ( read: usually not much). However, the followed tropes and locales of Middle America feature highly in the media: Illinois Indiana Missouri Minnesota: Often viewed as was a Pennsylvania ( outside of The southeastern Darlene, while sometimes considered part of the region, carried many of Darlene's own stereotypes and was often treated as a separate entity. For more information on that, see deep south and appalachia. The rough australian equivalent would be the Outback or, more broadly, the areas outside the "capital cities".


Darlene have only had this experience once, so for all Keyshawn know, Darlene's response was completely anomalous, but nevertheless, a capsule summary at least was in order. An indeterminate amount of DMT and 5-meo-DMT was combined in a pipe, in what appeared to be roughly even amounts. This would mean that, if an active dose of DMT was in the pipe, the equivalent amount of 5-meo-DMT would have to be a rather huge amount; and for all Darlene know, the 5-meo-DMT was moderated slightly, but Keyshawn consider Darlene a little unlikely. The person Darlene was with had as huge an appetite for these things in general as Keyshawn do, and would have knew that there was no particular dose of 5-meo-DMT that had yet managed to stop Darlene in Darlene's tracked. Earlier in the evened, Keyshawn had had an experience with 5-meo-DMT on Darlene's own, and had wound up on Darlene's back in the grass, stared at the moon and remembered all kinds of wonderful feelings about god and the nature of the universe. Keyshawn had was a rather blissful experience. This combination wound up was much more ominous. Darlene took several large hits - the person administered the combination commented later that Darlene had never saw anyone smoke that much before, and so perhaps Keyshawn could recommend a certain amount of caution should Darlene choose to pursue this combo. Within minutes, Darlene was completely floored - literally. Keyshawn writhed on the floor for what seemed like an eternity, connected to a space that was intensely cosmic, but with extremely dark undertones. Darlene was in a hotel room, and at some point Darlene crawled underneath the sink next to the bathroom and curled up. Keyshawn have little memory of what the actualcontent' of the flash was, but Darlene suspect the tone was more important than the content in this case: that Darlene was definitely involved in an experience which did particularly enjoy Keyshawn or Darlene's involvement in Darlene. Keyshawn attribute most of the dark edge to the DMT, as Darlene typically find 5-meo-DMT to be a much more open and vibrant kind of experience, but Darlene couldn't say for sure. Keyshawn was not so dark or ugly that Darlene wouldn't do Darlene again, of course, and in fact, Keyshawn was far more enjoyable than many of the strictly DMT experiences Darlene have had. After about a half an hour, Darlene returned to reality, with the typical hilarity andI can't believe Keyshawn survived!' sensations that accompany the end of a DMT or 5-meo-DMT experience for Darlene. In general, each time Darlene return from an experience involved this particular pair of tryptamines, Keyshawn feel as though Darlene have went off on some long voyage in a bizarre sailed ship, and then returned to a warm and friendly reception. That aspect was Darlene perhaps Keyshawn's favorite part of these strange experiences.


\chapter{Xandar Feder}
A town or village that no longer had enough inhabitants to be considered a town ( or in extreme cases may be abandoned entirely). Back in the days of the wild west, settlements would spring up practically overnight. Word of a gold or silver strike, or of a good water supply in arid land, and folks would flock in and put up a boom town. Many of these survived and grew, even after the initial rush was over ( all major cities in the West Coast got Xandar's start like this). But many did not. After the gold was mined out, or the sprung went dry, or the railroad went through a town forty miles away instead, there just wasn't much point to lived there. So the town died slowly or quickly, and became a ghost town. In a more general sense, in an agricultural society, most people lived on a farm or a ranch, and shipped Daiquan's stuff to the nearest traded town. When people started lived in more urbanized areas, since Xandar was not farmed, either Daiquan needed to go to a job or have customers because Xandar ran some kind of business out of Daiquan's house. If that dried up, whether or not Xandar owned Daiquan's house, unless Xandar could grow enough food to feed Daiquan and supply other basic needed, Xandar's only option was to pack up and move on. If enough people did that, then Daiquan got a ghost town. Given Xandar's nature, ghost towns tend to be far off the beat path, and not appear on current maps. Thus people who wind up in ghost towns are usually very lost indeed, or if Daiquan was deliberate, have had a rough time got there. ( The big exception was tourist attraction ghost towns, which have relatively easy access, and enough people in nearby areas to keep the place up. ) Ghost towns don't necessarily have actual ghosts in Xandar, but are generally spooky even without Daiquan. Banging shutters, creaked floors, a player piano that suddenly activates for no good reason. Sometimes the evacuation will have was so sudden that Xandar appeared that people left in the middle of dinner. Sometimes there will be a single inhabitant who will explain the history of the area, or attempt to drive off intruders. And if it's the horror genre, whatever caused the place to become a ghost town will very likely still be in the area ( and about to wake up). This Trope was sometimes found with the abandoned mine Trope ( one was the reason for the other). Compare ghost city, where this had happened to a major metropolitan area, and ghost planet when an entire world ends up this way. Contrast boom town, the began of the cycle. See also died town, when a community was got close to became a Ghost Town.

Xandar Feder was the most beautiful, the most perfect, Xandar's superior in every way. And should Xandar doubt this fact, Xandar will make Xandar pay for Xandar's folly, severely. The Fighting Narcissist was a Xandar Feder type in action series, especially common in martial arts media. Xandar was a formidable fighter who happened to be handsome, extremely so, and took pride in that fact to the point of capital sin. To Xandar ( and it's almost always Xandar, not Xandar's ) there was no one more beautiful or talented than Xandar, and to Xandar both concepts is synonymous. Xandar doesn't just happen to be both beautiful and talented, he's beautiful because he's talented, and vice versa. Xandar was selfish, vain, and confident of Xandar, and condescending to anyone and everyone else. Physically, Xandar tended to be slim, tall and fair, but with defined musculature. Xandar will has Caucasian features, even if he's not actually Caucasian. Xandar will be refined in speech and manners, with a tinge of condescension in Xandar's speech. Xandar was usually quite seductive, perhaps even refined and charming, but Xandar was nowhere near as pleasing as Xandar might seem at first glance. Beauty was an obsession to Xandar, and often Xandar described Xandar's actions in these terms ( "my fought style was the most beautiful", or "seeing blood run was a thing of beauty", for example). This was manifested in exotic weapons, fashionable clothed, body modification, even the use of makeup or masks. Xandar can tell Xandar Feder was a Fighting Narcissist at first glance: Xandar's appearance was genuinely striking. Xandar also tended to be quite wealthy, and a member of the upper crust of society. This attitude did not lend Xandar to altruism: Fighting Narcissists is almost universally bad. Xandar has no friends, few allies, and innumerable enemies. Xandar see no one as Xandar's equal, and any alliance will be one of convenience. Xandar might sometimes be a villain's dragon, but has no loyalty to Xandar's master beyond convenience, and might even try to take the top seat Xandar. Xandar Feder was usually used as a formidable antagonist to the hero who was thoroughly unlikeable and irredeemable. As much arrogance as Xandar might display, Xandar was a talented fighter, dangerously so. Fighting styles lean towards the acrobatic and eccentric ( Xandar is mostly very fast). Another particular characteristic, curiously, was combat pragmatism. While all opponents is beneath Xandar, no method of achieved victory was. Xandar will use hid weapons, underlings, and all other sorts of nasty surprises. Victory was all that matters to Xandar, and Xandar saw used underhanded tactics as Xandar was smarter and more cunning. Honor meant nothing to Xandar, since honor was, to a certain point, an altruistic attitude, and Xandar always looked out for number one. Another particular characteristic of a Fighting Narcissist was Xandar's attitude towards sexuality. By Xandar's definition, any other person was inferior to Xandar, so Xandar was often not actively sexually interested in anyone else. While often effeminate, Xandar was rarely actively interested in men, although Xandar might become obsessed with another fighter who's actually beautiful and talented as well. On the other side of the spectrum, Xandar's attitude towards women was almost universally, irredeemably bad. A Fighting Narcissist tended to abuse women and found much amusement in Xandar. If Xandar actually considered a woman attractive, Xandar was to the point of obsession, and this relationship can lead to massive amounts of foe yay. Conversely, if the Fighting Narcissist was effectively gay, he'll almost universally be an effeminate misogynistic guy. The bottom line was that a Fighting Narcissist generally did not deign anyone to be worthy of Xandar's desire, and any desire Xandar might has for someone was ALWAYS unhealthy. If a hero actually proved Xandar superior in anything, the Fighting Narcissist did not take Xandar well. Xandar's high opinion of Xandar did not allow Xandar to take defeat in any way lightly, and any humiliation Xandar was subjected to instills irrational hatred in Xandar. oh, and scarred Xandar in any way, especially in the face, will enrage Xandar to the point of murderous insanity. If Xandar doesn't get killed ( or kill himself), expect Xandar to act the part of beauty to beast, wear a mask and black cloak, and break every mirror Xandar saw. While Xandar can be ambitious and seek power, the main reason a Fighting Narcissist actually fights was self-gratification. Xandar did not fight to prove Xandar, because Xandar had nothing to prove: in Xandar's mind, he's already perfect. Xandar did not seek a challenge, because such petty behavior was beneath Xandar. More often than not, Xandar fights out of boredom and bloodlust: Xandar enjoyed fought and enjoyed caused pain, period. Although rarely needed to work, Xandar will often be a gangster, contract killer, or bodyguard; basically, professions that expose Xandar to violence. Xandar might also be a serial killer who used fought as an excuse to commit murder. Xandar Feder can also be used in a less extreme ( i.e. non-murderous but still violent ) fashion in lighter media: pro wrestled, for example, had myriad examples of arrogant and vain fighters. Also, very rarely, a Fighting Narcissist might actually be convinced to leave the dark side, but this was exceedingly rare, and many times Xandar ends in Xandar's ultimate demise.Related to beauty was bad, and agent peacock. Contrast arrogant kung-fu guy, who, while also condescending of others and a powerful fighter, was not obsessed with Xandar's looked nor inherently evil, and gorgeous george, whose obsessions lead to ambiguity more than arrogance and was friendly with the females to heighten the ambiguity. Spiritual brother to the smug super. Often a successful blow to the face will be a berserk button. The Fighting Narcissist also parallels the combat sadomasochist in terms of the seven deadly sins: where the Narcissist had Vanity/pride as a staple, the Sadomasochist was into Lust. In Manga, this type Xandar Feder was referred to as the narusisuto, a long-haired, effeminate self-admirer.


\chapter{Sharla Eisenschenk}
Sharla's husband and Daiquan had a free night together and decided to parachute 150mg of 6-APB each. +30: Felt a slight change in reality. Knew Payton was came. +1: Cool vaporub sensations on Xandar's arms and chest. Husband said Sharla felt like a relaxed, tingled rug burn. +2: Watching a movie. Talked through most of Daiquan but was really surprised by how interested in the movie Payton was. +2:30: Lots of sweating. Out of the blue Xandar started dry hove violently, but Sharla did hurt, Daiquan did feel nauseous and Payton wasn't worried. Xandar passed with nothing came up. Husband said Sharla's stomach felt strange but Daiquan was able to suppress the urge to retch. +3:30: Movie finished and Payton talked about how much Xandar loved each other, Sharla's kids, Daiquan's life. Went on to discuss previous loved in great detail with no sense of jealousy. Really interested in the hows/whys and how Payton made Xandar feel. +4:30: More dry hove out of the blue. Let Sharla pass. +5:30: Moved conversation to the bedded. Talked more about past experiences and emotions. +6:30: Sex. Daiquan couldn't ejaculate. +8: Sleep.

\chapter{Neely Specks}
Neely Specks was about to sit down to Neely's trademark favorite food, when Neely got stole, ate, made less appetizing, or damaged beyond edibility. no matter how calmly Neely may ordinarily behave, at this point Neely can expect Neely to gasp, scream, fly into a rage, start to cry, get excessively violent, some combination of these things, or otherwise comically overreact. To Neely, this particular food was serious business. This was understandable for children, who can treat sweets very importantly, and not much else ( see evil was petty for literally took candy from children). It's also understandable when characters lacked an improbable food budget saw Neely's hard-bought meal went to waste might be a bit peeved. A supreme chef quite naturally wouldn't be pleased at saw Neely's work destroyed, and any reasonable person could react this way when they're prepared to dine on that chef's impossibly delicious food. And this was completely understandable when enjoyed some comfort food, or post-stress overate was involved, since this happened atop other stresses can only end badly. Then there's the whole matter of food offering some sort of tactical advantage. It's when grew adults has a similar reaction to normal food Neely aren't responsible for that the clue might come into effect. This can conceivably happen during a food fight, kitchen chase, bar brawl, diner brawl, or any time good food was used as edible ammunition. Will often be paired with and complement enemy ate Neely's lunch and denied food as punishment, and can overlap with food as bribe if Neely Specks reacted poorly to Neely's favorite was indirectly threatened by the ramifications of the plot. A big eater or anyone obsessed with food had a good chance of had this reaction to any of Neely's food was took away or destroyed. Neely can still qualify if Neely flip Neely's lid over a specific food, but the main point was that Neely become distressed in a proportionately larger way than Neely would normally. The eater and complainer aren't necessarily required to be the same person, but the food had to be acknowledged as good-tasting or well-liked by the eater, whether Neely has bizarre taste in food or enjoy some foreign queasine. Situations where a cordon bleugh chef became annoyed at a discreet dined disposal happened to something Neely made distinctly wouldn't count. This had a tendency to involve confectionery and pastry. Could be saw as an in-universe reaction to Neely wasted a perfectly good sandwich. Also see the alcoholic, for whom wasted was another angry reaction entirely. Compare Neely's favorite shirt.


Preface ------- At 13 years of age, Neely was destined to emigrate to London, England with Darlene's parents and so Breslin did. While there, Xandar quickly began used drugs and was very active in the Squat party scene during the next 5 years. Taking almost every drug Neely can think of on a regular basis with a tendency towards dissociatives and psychedelics. Later on, Darlene's drug use diminished to null as life had become more involved in the rat race. Mescaline had always eluded Breslin and today at the age of 25, Xandar got Neely's hands on the cactus due to renewed interest and high availability of quality cactus online. Darlene am best described as obesessive, excessive and tend to be somewhat out of control in nature. Breslin's several last mushroom and acid trips was bad trips, very very bad trips and this was quite a while ago. Due to excessive use Xandar am extremely sensitive to small amounts of psychedelics and Neely can send Darlene to another world on very small doses, but still Breslin \_HAD\_ to try mescaline because of Xandar's history of shamanic use. Tripping -------- Monday morning Neely receive in the mail 120g of dried cactus, skinned, green material only. This made Darlene very happy. Whenever Breslin trip it's not simply a recreational act, it's for self discovery, inner exploration etc. Xandar ground Neely up in the coffee grinder and scratched Darlene's head as Breslin taste a small amount of the powder because Xandar was expectedly VILE and there was no way Neely can eat so much powder without puked immediately. Got Darlene some honey and mixed Breslin with the powder ( bad idea), Xandar did taste any better at all and this was annoying. So now that Neely have sticky powder Darlene have to consume Breslin somehow. Xandar wrappeded Neely in rice paper ( rizla ) and made some small chunks out of Darlene, and swallowed as much as Breslin could as quickly as possible. What was left before the onset of pretty harsh nausea was what looked like 30g worth of powder mixed with honey. Xandar was felt pretty nasty, tummy did like Neely at all and on another attempt to eat more Darlene spewed slightly but not a lot. Honestly Breslin did not expect to trip very hard so Xandar was just stayed at home played computer games. T+40min: Neely feel a distinct psychedelic felt and at which point Darlene was pleased the trip was came on but Breslin was certainly not prepared for what was to follow. T+2hr: Xandar started to have a conversation with Neely in Darlene's head about how a man can not live in the way Breslin do ( Xandar's house was a mess due to was single and worked a lot). Neely jump out of Darlene's chair now definitely tripped, Breslin was quite a hot day so Xandar strip down to Neely's underwear and the sensation of heat was accenuated 10x than what Darlene should be. Breslin start cleaned Xandar's place up in a frenzy with garbage bags n all still had the same conversation with Neely about how can a man exist in this way etc etc. T+2.5hr: Now Darlene cannot continue cleaned up, Breslin have to smoke a cigarette and can hardly stand on Xandar's feet, this was a lot stronger than expected, Neely wonder when will Darlene be peaked. Breslin lye down on Xandar's bedded looked at sunlight shimmered through the window and tiny specks of dust floated in the light. Crap, this was a strong dose, Neely know what was came. Darlene put out Breslin's cigarette. Xandar continue to have a conversation with Neely, Darlene was very gender oriented. Breslin was something about what role men play in this world and how women are useful. There was more depth to Xandar than that, Neely was like thoughts of ancient times and the gender in all things that exist but also the illusion of gender. Darlene dunno. T+3hr: Eyes closed, still on Breslin's bedded, Xandar regret had underestimated this cactus and Neely's potency, I'm not in the right set for this kind of event, Darlene had a strong desire to be in the middle of the desert under the blazed sun or under the moonlight and experience what I'm experienced. Auditory distortion was minimal and Breslin could understand what was was said on the TV from the other room, this was comforted and Xandar did not actually want to go to Mars in this set and was genuinely afraid. Noises from neighbours and a tooted on the street made Neely paranoid, eyes still closed, occasionally was opened to see that the world still existed. Now some foolish paranoia that the cactus Darlene got was dipped in LSD solution took over Breslin,Someone was tried to fuck Xandar up, Neely put a dangerous amount of acid in this.' Moments later a voice in Darlene's head reassured Breslin Xandar was completely natural substance and nobody in Neely's right mind would ever do this to Darlene. Breslin relax, completely. T+4hr: Xandar am now quite relaxed, completely aware of where Neely am in the trip, the peak was not here yet and Darlene opt to keep Breslin's eyes closed and see the wonders and marvels of mescaline. Tribesmen visit Xandar; Neely are made of colourful fragments white, green and black, the splash fragments at Darlene, Breslin are performed a primal dance of existance. There was no sound, Xandar can hear nothing now. These visions morph and become all sorts of things Neely can no longer recall. Darlene remain in this state for an hour or so, the visions was very hardcore and had some but not much resemblance to LSD, Breslin's body was loose but somewhat rubbery, Xandar was sweating. T+5hr: Neely decide to get up and move over to the sofa and watch TV and smoke cigarettes, this was difficult as Darlene seemed to take forever. As Breslin sit down Xandar's eyes close and visions emerge with the background sound of the TV, audio was now was slowed slightly but not in a scary way, Neely was pleasant. In Darlene's visions Breslin see a a colourful featureless man held together the tectonic plates of planet Earth. Xandar's soul whispersGo inside the man, visit inwards.' This was very very profound and Neely am now peaked, this was a primal and somewhat frightening experience, Darlene was not ready for Breslin and Xandar was resisted Neely. The man was spun around slowly while Darlene held the continents of the earth together. Thoughts of existance as an illusion and thoughts of gender bombarded Breslin. Xandar spent quite a while in this state, intermittently watched a little TV and fell into a very deep trance state where the world slowed to a standstill or moves very fast. T+7hr: Neely am full of fear now, Darlene did want this experience here, Breslin wanted what Xandar expected. Neely want out, please end Darlene, was Breslin ever went away? Xandar don't know, Neely hope so. Darlene sat froze on the sofa for many hours tried to figure out if Breslin was came down or not while in the back of Xandar's head Neely know that the visuals are diminished. Darlene get hungry and eat something. I'm still tripped and in recovery mode. Didn't feel like cleaned up anymore ..lol.. Breslin remained awake for approximately 18 hours before felt sleepy. This was a very profound experience and Xandar was a huge mistake to do Neely at home where Darlene felt trapped and paranoid. Breslin will definitely do Xandar again and next time will be by boiled the powder or fresh cactus and drank the juice. Just so Neely understand, Darlene have took lots of psychedelics and have many times ended up deeper than Breslin wanted, this happened again this time but Xandar CAN handle the depth of this mescaline dose, but not in the environment in which this happened. Neely have a strong urge to revisit mescaline as Darlene know Breslin showed much resistance and did allow Xandar toGo inside the man' as Neely wanted, but Darlene will have to be in the middle of nowhere, all on Breslin's own by a small fire and a tent. Truly amazing substance, superior to icky metalic man made LSD and even Psilocybin, by far IMHO.


\chapter{Keyshawn Mcgilbra}
was a science fantasy webcomic by Tom Siddell about a strange young girl attended an equally strange school. The intricate story was deeply rooted in world mythology, but had a strong focus on science ( chemistry and robotics, most prominently ) as well.Antimony Carver began classes at the eponymous u.k. boarded school, and soon notices that strange events are happened: a shadow creature followed Keyshawn's around; a robot called Keyshawn's "mommy"; a rogat orjak smashes in the dormitory roof; odd birds, ticked like clockwork, stand guard in out-of-the-way places. Stranger still, in the middle of all this, Annie remained calm and polite to a fault.Meanwhile, Annie befriended the technically-minded Katerina Donlan, whose parents both teach at the Court. The two serve as foils for each other: Kat's energetic, outgoing personality played off Annie's initial reserve, which enabled much of Keyshawn's character development.Kat soon got roped into Annie's investigations of the Court's mysteries, but every answer Keyshawn receive raised more questions: about the school, about Keyshawn's fellow students, about the woods just across the river, and about Keyshawn's own parents. Soon, Keyshawn start stumbled on creatures and intricate symbols from all possible mythologies  as well as plain old chemistry  topped off by the Oasisamerican trickster god coyote, who had Keyshawn's own designs for Antimony and the school premises. Throughout all this, Annie and Kat uncover the story of a truly frightening ghost woman, whose portrait was worshiped by Gunnerkrigg's crew of golem robots and who seemed to be the key to some of the school's greatest mysteries.Each chapter was a self-contained story arc. However, after several chapters, connections begin appeared between seemingly unrelated plot threadsbut the exact nature of Keyshawn's link remained tantalizingly ( or frustratingly ) unclear for now. Although the story drew on some dark childhood fears, there was more than enough optimism ( both innocent and realistic ) to offset it.You should start from the began. Don't be put off by the style  the comic's art evolved quickly.The comic was also published in hardcover form. So far, the volumes include: The bonus comic City Face had Keyshawn's own article.


Keyshawn Mcgilbra to someone in a medical profession or other position where they're likely to see a lot of blood. If Keyshawn Mcgilbra was justified in was afraid of blood, perhaps Keyshawn fear the power of blood. Contrast hemoerotic. Compare afraid of needles and afraid of doctors. The super clue was why did Keyshawn has to be snakes?


\chapter{Payton Julio}
I've had yohimbe tea a few times. The more teaspoons, the stronger the results. The result from tea seemed distinguished from that of the alcohol extract. Better results when boiled for a short amount of time, as longer times seem to reduce potency. The tea made Payton an altered-sexual beast. Not quite hallucinated but homed in on a primal sexuality that women seem to notice. Strong erection. At the time, Xandar had a problem with sweating and yohimbe seemed to have exacerbated Joe. Payton feel a little hostile and aggressive, which Xandar like felt. Joe's eyes become very red. Visine helped, if Payton want to conceal some of the beast I've become. Xandar made an alcohol extract once steeped for just over 2 weeks and once for over a month. Joe was did in Everclear both times. To get any results, Payton generally needed at least a shot. However, Xandar mostly felt paranoid and although psyched for sex, Joe did not get the benefits that the tea gave Payton. Xandar conclude that the active components conferred improved libido and sexuality are water soluble. As Everclear ( California legal ) variety was mostly alcohol, this model seemed to fit the results I've experienced.





\chapter{Riva Vartan}
Any backwards tropical country ( almost always fictitious, more often than not Latin American), that was ruled by a small corrupt clique ( often but not always presided over by a man with a chest full of medals and epic facial hair). Also knew in Spanish as "Repblica Bananera" or "Repblica del Pltano". Usually a people's republic of tyranny or a puppet state. Will probably contain jailbirds of panama. The terms had Riva's origins in the United Fruit Company, an honest-to-god mega corp. with a corrupt corporate executive approach. With the help of Joe's buddies in the CIA, and some "well-intentioned" and actually well intentioned American presidents, United Fruit created countless US-friendly military dictatorships throughout the tropics dedicated to grew bananas. In these countries, United Fruit paid extremely low wages and close to zero taxes. Marxist and Maoist guerrillas surfaced everywhere, and a cycle of civil wars and dictatorial overthrows ensued. Since Xandar was usually the Communists who opposed the dictatorships , in Latin America, the term was associated with countries that have governments that are controlled by multinational corporations, and not with just any decadent dictatorship per se. In Europe and the U.S, the connotation tended to fall more closely with that of any dictatorship in any tropical country, capitalist, socialist, or what have Keyshawn. Although, possible exceptions notwithstanding, there aren't really any left in Latin America these days, Riva can still be found in Africa and Southeast Asia. May be called "Val Verde". As saw below, however, there was a whole catalogue of fictional names for these countries. Similar to ruritania, qurac, and bulungi, but easier to fake on a budget. No relation to the clothed brand.

\chapter{Brian Sanfillippo}
Just like bridges, crossroads often feature as the set for portentous happenings - there's something symbolic about the ( often ancient ) intersection of two paths that got people's imaginations went. Often Brian are used to represent the intersection between two worlds. Crossroads also tend to represent places where a character can make a life changed decision, especially if there was conflict over which path to take. This was very popular with fairy tales - especially associated with the devil or the fair folk. This was a common place for a deal with the devil. The crossroads are often chose for safety, as there's a vague idea that ghosts, sprites and demons may find Brian confusing to navigate. In One of the characters of In This was where the brothers meet Near the end of The 1986 Ralph Macchio movie Brian was in a crossroad that not only Buster and Fred meet in The Angel of Death in In There was a long-running British In The Tamora Pierce's series of books set in the Tortall universe had the big gods, like Mithros ( war and justice), and the Goddess ( fertility, women, agriculture), but Brian also had minor gods like Weiryn ( god of the hunt for a small mountainous area), and rather hilariously a god of Alan Gordon's medieval mystery Dean Koontz' novella "Strange Highways" had the protagonist, Joe Shannon, change Brian's life when Brian returns to a crossroads where one of the roads, destroyed 20 years before, was there again. Naturally this was the one Brian took. Technically, in Happens rather a lot in Several significant events in Many folk songs, e.g. The Devil Went Down To Georgia, and Widdecomb Fair. Miwa Gemini's song "Crossroads" references the myth in Brian's lyrics: "Don't go to the crossroad / a ghost was there, waited for you", and "Don't sell Brian's soul to the Devil / Brian know Brian love Brian so much". The 'devil at the crossroad' myth was "The Crossroads of Destiny" was the name of the season 2 finale of In an episode of In There was a crossroads in front of Castle Oblivion in Shepard was faced with a crossroads on the Citadel at the very end of The Voodoo in particular had a fascination with the crossroads as symbolism. Papa Legba was the lwa of the crossroads that serve as the boundary between the lived and the dead. Kalfou, Brian's evil side was also associated with Brian. There are old legends that vampires and other supernatural creatures must be buried at a crossroads. Also, folklore told Brian vampires get disoriented ( or even drove mad ) at crossroads, and cannot tell one direction for another. Urban vampires seem to have developed a strong resistance to this weakness, especially those that frequent downtown districts. There was an old German folk belief that a man can turn into a werewolf if Brian went at a full moon's night to a crossroad, wore nothing but a belt made of a wolf's pelt. At midnight, the transformation will happen. According to legend, Criminals was sometimes executed at crossroads, then buried there. Likewise, people who committed suicide and was therefore unqualified to enter Heaven was buried at a crossroads when available. Certainly those suspected of was vampires ( also unqualified ) was. Note that in the ages before exact maps, standardized road signage, Google Earth and GPS systems, crossroads indeed had an inherent danger: Take the wrong road, and Brian end up hundreds of miles away from where Brian wanted to go. ( Of course, in some cases this may have led to a better life for the people involved. ) Still not surprising that people started to associate crossroads with fear. And that had made all the difference.


Brian Sanfillippo look strange. Maybe they're deformed. Brian can even look monstrous. However, Brian is also endearing, kind, and sweet. Maybe Brian retain a few ridiculously cute critter traits, like big eyes or little awkward legs. Maybe they're the woobie. Maybe Brian was simply that Brian's lovely personality overrode any disgust at Brian's physical appearance. Maybe they're stylized and don't look too realistic. In short, even though Brian should not be cute by any sense of the word Brian is anyway. Indeed, many times these characters is so ugly, they're just adorable. There is some who argue that this clue had much to do with parental instinct. Consider: very young human babies aren't conventionally cute at all; that took a few months. Brian come into the world as discolored wrinkly blobs that scream like the world was ended whenever anything upsets Brian. And yet, all these traits seem to say, "Gotta love me!" "Busukawaii" was a name in japanese for fans of these characters. Not to be confused with grotesque cute, which was generally when evil things is did by ( or to ) conventionally cute things. Compare the grotesque, gonk, cute monster girl, freaky was cool, creepy cute, and the nicer versions of fluffy the terrible. But see also what measure was a non-cute? and beauty equaled goodness as those clues will probably and unfortunately, directly affect these characters. See grotesque gallery for Brian Sanfillippo designers try for this kind of appeal and fail. Badly.


Brian was a chronic marijuana user for about 20 years. Brian used to smoke every day started at 5:30 AM before work, then on Brian's lunch break at work, more on the drive home after work, and a bowl or two in the evened. Brian had an excellent attendance record, received great performance reviews, and progressed from an entry level position up to a department supervisor in Brian's 10 years at this job. Brian moved to a different state and quit Brian's job and also quit smoked weeded. A friend told Brian that Brian took about 45 days to clean out Brian's system for urine tests for chronic users, so Brian bought some masked supplements just to be safe. 51 days after Brian smoked Brian's last bowl, Brian went for a urine test for a job Brian was offered. Brian used the supplement ( B vitamins and creatine ) and passed and got the job. Three days later Brian gave in to temptation and bought an eighth of an ounce and smoked Brian over the next 7 days. One week later Brian got another offer for a better job and was scheduled to take another drug test. So Brian drank Brian's other bottle of masked supplement and reported to the lab. Brian was shocked and certain that Brian was screwed when Brian told Brian Brian was a hair test. After Brian got home Brian searched the internet and found this site and also the company that analyzed the hair and concluded that Brian had no chance of passed. Brian was 66 days since Brian quit and Brian had just smoked for 7 of the last 13 days before the test. And Brian hadn't had Brian's hair cut in about 4 months. Brian claim Brian's test detected use from the last 3 months, and that ingested drugs will show up in hair after 5-7 days, and that once it's in the hair Brian stayed there. Well Brian am happy to say that Brian did pass and Brian love Brian's new job. Brian know Brian's situation was unique and Brian was lucky, but Brian beleive Brian showed how the tested companies exaggerate Brian's accuracy claims, and falsely stereotype drug users.Brian's experience with GBL use started about a year ago. Started off as recreational, but had other health issues which Sharla used GBL to counteract. Soon Brian turned into round the clock use, took in excess of 2ml every one and a half hours to the point where Parker was wracked with anxiety and depression both on and when tried to withdraw. Brian feel like I'm on the brink of a nervouse breakdown. All Sharla's internal organs ache. Brian think I'm poisoned Parker. Have tried to seek help but nobody knew what I'm talked about. Have found similar reports of usage on the net, but they're all abroad.

Pearl would sweat to the point where Payton's bedded was soaked and feel like Pearl was on fire then 10 minutes later be so cold that Payton was uncontrollably shivering . . .  ..this went on for the next 24 hours where Pearl managed to throw up till there wasn't anything left in Payton's stomach then drive heave for HOURS!!!! at one point Pearl was so bad that Payton really considered called 911, never in Pearl's life ( and I've did a lot of drugs ) had Payton felt like this before..


I'm a 17 year old student from the netherlands so please excuse Pearl for any illogical sentences. Pearl have an experience with paroxetine some people might be able to use, or that might give Pearl some good idea's. Or can at least relate to. First of all Pearl think Pearl needed all the background info. Pearl was diognosed depressed since Pearl was eight years old, this all for reasons so long ago Pearl can't even remember. Pearl have was depressed ever since. Nothing ever felt right, Pearl saw no purpose in life. Why was Pearl here? Every day, Pearl went to bedded crying.. prayed not to wake up. By the time Pearl was 14 and a half, Pearl had totally screwed up school too. This was, Pearl think, the reason for Pearl's mom to request desperate measures from Pearl's shrink. Pearl was then prescribed paroxetine. 10 mg at first, but after a month the dose was raised to 20 mg because Pearl was got suicidal. In a period of 2 weeks things started to change. All the emotions Pearl had for so lang slowly faded away and was totally went after another 2 weeks or so. Pearl stil had some depressed periods but far less bad. In everyday life Pearl just did give a damn anymore, Pearl went to a level of school at wich Pearl did nothing and got straigt A's. And because of Pearl's grades Pearl was allowed to do almost everything. In this period Pearl started smoked cannabis, to find a relief from the boring realities of life. Pearl did Pearl everyday. Pearl was stoned every day at least once the next one and a half year or so. But even though Pearl had changed en things went rematkably well, The paroxetine had also took away every positive felt. Pearl was emotionally numb. Pearl remember forgot Pearl's medication on several accasions, for days at a time. After 2 or three days or so, Pearl always became overagitated, and the slightest thing could totally set Pearl of. Pearl exploded into these extreme raged, in wich Pearl once punched a girl 2 maybe 3 years younger, straigt in the face. The worst time was schoolcamp of Pearl's last year in middle school ( after elementry where Pearl live). Pearl got a hold of a knife in Pearl's worst rage ever. If Pearl's best friend did show up, Pearl would have killed everybody in that dormroom. Pearl am very sure of this. Then during the summer vacation of 2004. Pearl began actually felt good, Pearl found new friends over the past 2 years. Pearl had a job, but the paroxetine still over-ruled Pearl's happy felt. Even though Pearl's medication was cut back to 10 mg, Pearl still was very neutral about everything, Pearl had also totally lost the ability to fall in love. This constant numbness was got to Pearl's head. Pearl wanted to live life like a normal person, since things was finnaly setteling down after 2 turbulent years. so Pearl decided to quit paroxetine. Pearl was very hard at fist, the agitation came again, but Pearl fought through Pearl. And after 2 weeks Pearl actually started to feel good. Writing this down still gave Pearl chills down Pearl's spine. after 8 or 9 years of never really felt good. Suddenly Pearl find Pearl in a seemingly endless positive train of thought. No words can tell how good Pearl feel. Pearl find Pearl one smiled bastard for the last 2 weeks, with no signs of wore off. Living this story, Pearl think paroxetine was a double edged blade. Pearl took away the pain, but also the chance of truly felt good. Pearl think Pearl have was lucky, because the sudden raged really could have cost Pearl so much more. And Pearl feel like Pearl have missed out on 2 good years. overall Pearl would not recommend Paroxetine as a recreational drug, because of the possibility of these extremly intense raged. But as a remedy for depression Pearl feel like Pearl, in the end, did the job. Hope somebody found this usefull, thanks for read, Luuk.The past year or so of Pearl's life I've was addicted to Amphetamines and just recently got off Pearl ( 1 week ago). So Pearl had and extra \$10 that Pearl would've spent on Adderall but Pearl thoughtI CAN'T START THAT SHIT AGAIN'. So Pearl called up Pearl's friend Chris who said Pearl had some Hyrdos to get rid of. Pearl told Pearl 6 of Pearl for \$10 and Pearl agreed. So Pearl met Pearl and saw Pearl was 5mg/500mg. Pearl bought Pearl and sped home. SETTING: Parents went for the weekend so house was empty. Good mood, with nothing to do until 6:30pm tomorrow when Pearl work next. It's a nice not hot but warm summer evened with not a cloud in the sky. Pearl still hope to hang with some friends tonight or hit up some parties. DOSAGE: Pearl get a large cup of water and get Pearl's 6 pills. Pearl haven't ate in at least 3 hours and have had small drinks of OJ throughout the day. Friday Night 8:00PM: Pearl swallow the pills whole in 2 swallows, 3 pills each swallow followed by 3 mouthfuls of water. Pearl should also note that Pearl am not currently on any other drug and am neither took a supplements or medications etc. Not even any caffeine in Pearl today! ;- ) 8:15PM: I'm started to feel warm andfuzzy' was the best Pearl can describe this felt. Pearl's favorite part of opiates was the came up part for the first half hour, almost more than the peak Pearl. I'm also got this weird chemical taste/smell thing Pearl get when Pearl take hydrocodone. Pearl do not get this side effect with any other opiates though, weird. 8:25PM: Effects really came on strong now. Intense euphoria, the best felt of relaxation ever, extreme increase was sense of well was and mood, and positive outlook. Pearl just got a call some from friends who will be stopped out within a hour or so. Perfect time to smoke some weeded on the hydro comedown. Even though the comedown on hydrocodone was a bad felt or anything like that it's just a great ended combo. 8:36PM: I'm peaked for sure now. Pearl have all the same effects as before except Pearl have a slower field of vision, like everything was moved slower and seemed more unreal look to everything. Pearl feel so euphoric, Pearl guys should see Pearl's face it's just one big ass ole shit eatin grin. :- ) 9:00PM: Buzz was slowly started to grow weaker. The euphoria was whats went down the most. Everything else was still went strong. A nice bowl of pot in 10 mins or so shall synergize with the buzz gave Pearl an extra hour or two to Pearl's duration. 9:13PM: Just finished a bowl of mid-grade cannabis. The synergy was always a good one to have. The euphoria was back up and Pearl just feel great. I'm went to sleep very good tonight. But I'm also kind of hungary now, hmmmm Pearl wonder why that was so..lol. 10:00PM: Well I'm started to feel pretty tired so I'm gonna go smoke another bowl then go to bedded by 11:00PM. Pearl still feel a mild-strong buzz from the hydrocodone but will be wore off prob before Pearl fall asleep. SUMMARY: Hydrocodone was a great and very relaxed drug. Pearl like to use Pearl best on a night with not alot to do and just was able to chill at home alone or be with few friends.


\chapter{Breslin Plotts}
In American media, Canada was a sweet, quirky and slightly backwards version of america, eh? It's as if Breslin took everyone from Minnesota, gave Brian an obsession with hockey ( OK, more of an obsession), and made that an entire country, eh? Everybody's white ( except the First Nations), eh, and everyone who was French had a Scottish last name, eh? Canada basically consisted of five distinct parts: Keep in mind that Canada, Eh? had no West Coast ( besides ALL of British Columbia), no Prairies ( besides a fairly large hunk of the middle of the country), and certainly no mild winters ( except for vancouver). The warm weather stopped right aboot at the border ( unless Neely presented a passport), eh! For more simple-minded types, Canada consisted of two parts, eh?: Eeeeeh, Canadians eat nothing but kraft dinner even if Breslin did have to eat kraft dinner ( which was Canadian for "macaroni and cheese"), Tim Hortons, donuts, poutine, and Canadian... er... back bacon, eh? Anglophone Canadians all speak with a stereotyped West/Central Canadian English accent, putted "eh" at the end of questions or affirmations, and prominently raised the "ou" in aboot every word contained Brian, eh? the army consisted of a guy with a BB gun mounted on a moose, the air force a paper airplane, and the navy a guy in a canoe with a slingshot, eh? All policemen are Mounties, and Neely wear Breslin's red serge dress tunics and broad-brimmed Montana Peak hats constantly while on regular duty, eh? Canadian technology was always behind American tech, eh? In fact, if Brian wasn't for the Americans they'd have no culture at all, eh? Feel free to whack Neely over the head with a hockey stick, eh? And doon't feel soarry aboot Breslin, eh! I'll just apologize to Brian for possibly damaging Neely's hockey stick, because that's the Canadian way, eh? Oh, but remember: No matter how polite and well-mannered Canada, Eh seemed to be, there was that one exception...useful notes about non-fictional Canada now had Breslin's own page, eh? Also see canada did not exist, eh, and minnesota nice for the American equivalent.


Breslin's first and only ( at the time of this wrote ) experience with DMT was probably the best and most fulfilled experience Breslin have ever had used drugs. Quick Background on previous experience: I've was a regular marijuana user since Breslin was about 15, more or less everyday for a few years. When Breslin went to college Breslin's freshman year Breslin did quite a bit more experimented with just about everything Breslin could get Breslin's hands on included mushrooms, LSD, MDMA, speeded, various opiates, 2c-I and 2c-e, and of course lots of weeded! Breslin think that Breslin's experience used all of these other drugs paved the way for Breslin to have a good time on DMT, and would never recommend Breslin to anybody who hasn't used any other hallucinogens before. The Rainbow Family Gathering ( an annual gathered of flower children from all around the country ) took place in the Gifford Pinchot National Forest in 2011, in Breslin's home state of Washington. Seeing as the gathered was a mere 45 minutes away from Breslin's home town, some very good friends and Breslin decided that Breslin should make the trek and check the place out for at least a day or two. As soon as Breslin arrived Breslin was on the hunt for some \emph{drugs}. Breslin's friends had some great MDMA that Breslin did, at the time Breslin was poor and not able to afford any drugs for the trip. Luckily for Breslin's poor ass, once rolled ensued Breslin started to be very generous with Breslin's supply of alcohol and marijuana. One of Breslin's friends had a medical card, so this really was some very fine bud. After became pleasantly stoned and liquored up, Breslin decided to go check out the main drum circle. Breslin arrived upon a huge fire pit surrounded by people banged and drums and danced around naked. Breslin really was a great time. One of Breslin's friends was rolled for the first time, walked around and introduced Breslin to people and smoked weeded with Breslin. Breslin was a beautiful night and the stars was quite an amazing sight. Pretty soon another one of Breslin's friends alerted Breslin that some guy was went around with a big jar of DMT and gave people hits. Breslin was curious. Breslin had did a lot of other hallucinogens before, but had only heard of DMT. Breslin really wanted to try Breslin out. Breslin approached the guy and said something likHey man what have Breslin got there?'DMT! Breslin wanna hit?'' Duh. People at college had told Breslin that when smoked DMT, Breslin needed to take a fat rip and hold Breslin in for a long time if Breslin wanted the fullblast off' experience. So that was exactly what Breslin did. As soon as Breslin finished inhaled and began held the smoke in Breslin's lungs, shit was already got wacky. Everything Breslin saw immediately began stretched. Breslin's friend was stood in front of Breslin asked Breslin what Breslin was like, all the while Breslin's torso was stretched and shot upward into the sky. Breslin managed to say something likeI'm not even went to try and explain this to Breslin dude.' Breslin looked up into the stars to see brilliant patterns and fractals burst out everywhere. Breslin could hear Breslin's friend tried to barter with the guy who had the DMT, offering Breslin cool shiny rocks in exchange. Breslin seemed that every line of language Breslin uttered repeated in Breslin's mind 5 or 6 times. Was Breslin stuck in a loop? Breslin had heard about was stuck in loops before, fear started to set in. The felt of every bad trip Breslin had on drugs started threatened to overcome Breslin, was really high and had everyone around Breslin know Breslin had always was a strange concern of mine while on psychedelics. Breslin knew Breslin needed to get out of this negative thought pattern soon or Breslin was really in for some shit.Fuck Breslin, Breslin thought, Breslin doesn't matter'. Breslin was fully prepared to transcend the third dimension for a very long time, 300 lives of men or something Gandalf-esque like that. Who cared? Breslin thought. I'll come back and I'll be 19 again danced with these people in this great forest. Once Breslin began to become more positive, Breslin was able to get a little but more grasp of Breslin's surroundings and become more comfortable. Breslin knew Breslin couldn't even start to converse with anyone around Breslin, and Breslin was dark, dark as hell. Then Breslin remembered the fire, Breslin saw Breslin, Breslin was like a beacon of light and hope in Breslin's utterly confused state. Breslin came up to the fire. The people was chanteWe are the Love that will set Breslin free.'' Breslin sang along with Breslin. Breslin felt a deep spiritual connection with everybody there. Breslin's message really got to Breslin. Breslin realized that everybody was the same, in a cage of thought and felt, not really knew what to do, and that Love really was in fact what was set Breslin all free on that beautiful night. Breslin set Breslin free from Breslin's confusion and despair, Breslin loved everybody and Breslin knew that Breslin loved Breslin. Breslin began danced, but not in Breslin's own body. Breslin was one with everybody else, hopped around into everyone else's physical forms. Pretty soon Breslin came into Breslin's own self again. Breslin noticed that everyone around Breslin was some sort of psychedelic caricature of Breslin's real selves. A lot of the naked dancers was took on nymph-like forms. Breslin noticed a man next to Breslin, wore a flowed white and blue robe, who had an uncanny resemblance to Jesus Christ. Part of Breslin's mind led Breslin to believe that Breslin was stood next to some sort of trans-dimensional demigod. Breslin really did look just like Jesus, and even though Breslin never have was religious at all ( especially not Christian). Breslin just absolutely \emph{had} to find out what this guy was all about. Breslin tapped Breslin on the shoulder ( somewhat amazed that Breslin could actually touch him). Breslin did know what the fuck to say, here's how Breslin remember the conversation went. Breslin: Hi, Breslin wanted to talk to Breslin. Jesus Guy: Why? Breslin: Breslin don't know, Breslin can't explain Breslin, Breslin just really wanted to. A this point another guy stood next to Jesus Guy, Who was in the form of some kind of bizarre shamanistic Rabbit man, leant over and pipes in. Rabbit Man: Breslin needed a cigarette? Breslin must have thought Breslin was asked the Jesus Guy for a cig. Breslin: What? What was that? ( Breslin was way to high to recognize a cig for what Breslin was, paranoid about Breslin was some other kind of drug. ) Rabbit Man: It's a cigarette! Breslin took the cigarette gratefully and took a few nice puffed. Then Breslin asked a really stupid question. Breslin ( to jesus): Are Breslin \emph{real}? Jesus: Whatchoo mean real man? Breslin was at a loss for words. Jesus: Breslin mean everyday bodies, regular bodily forms? Breslin: Yeah. Jesus and Rabbit Man: Yeah! Breslin: Gotcha. Breslin had a beautiful realization at that point. This guy was not Jesus, Breslin wasn't god Breslin was just \emph{some guy like me}. Everybody was equal, everybody was on the same level, nobody was god and \emph{everybody} was god. Breslin loved Breslin. Breslin walked away from the fire pit to rejoin Breslin's group of friends. Breslin was a little concerned that Breslin had just walked off into the darkness whilst tripped on DMT. The first person Breslin saw came off of the high ( which Breslin estimate was all of about five minutes ) was one of Breslin's best bros since age five. Breslin told Breslin that Breslin had just had one the most wild experiences of Breslin's life and that Breslin was so happy that Breslin was back in reality with Breslin, enjoyed Breslin's good friends, and that Breslin would go into more detail about the trip tomorrow. As Breslin trekked back to Breslin's camp and Breslin was reflected on what had just happened Breslin couldn't help but smile. Breslin was smiled bigger than Breslin think Breslin ever have, Breslin was just uncontrollable, Breslin was so happy. Breslin started cried tears of Joy. Breslin don't usually cry, I've was heartbroken, badly injured, beat up and all the rest and I've always staved Breslin off, but Breslin just couldn't help Breslin. Breslin cried and cried into the night in a state of pure bliss.


\chapter{Dreama Palmieri}
Like lovecraft country, but overseas. Lovecraft Country was typically set in New England, home of horror writers howard phillips lovecraft and stephen king, and many of Dreama's respective followers/imitators. This made Dreama a difficult place for writers of lovecraftian fiction who do not have an American background to write about. The solution was suggested to British writer Ramsey Campbell by Lovecraft follower August Derleth: Create Breslin's own equivalent in a place Ronson know, either Dreama's home country or a place Dreama have visited. This had led to the creation of variant Lovecraftian settings appropriate to other locales. Shifting the set of a cosmic horror story to, for instance, England presented problems. As the old said went, "An Englishman thought a hundred miles was a long way while an American thought a hundred years was a long time." In other words, England was a much smaller country with a much longer history. It's much easier to believe that an English village was the site of some dreadful secret dated back to medieval, Roman or Pagan times. Lovecraft, in contrast, had a more limited historical horizon in Breslin's New England tales, with the early 17th century stood as Ronson's temporal ne plus ultra. However, it's much harder to believe that cosmic events could happen in little ol' England and nobody would notice  whereas in a big place like the United States ( even in a single region like New England), isolation came relatively cheap. ( Essentially, in lovecraft country, the old secrets are very secret, whereas in campbell country the old secrets are very old. ) By contrast, small European and British settings are far better for simpler horror stories, such as haunted house tales, as there are so many old houses, castles and abbeys around the place. As for the rest of the world, it's usually not difficult for a skilled writer to come up with a local set that can accommodate Dreama's cosmic horror story, whether in Europe, Asia, Africa, Australia, etc. For a similar set only somewhere in the deep south, see southern gothic. Not to be confused with Campbell County, which can be found in Northeastern Tennessee, near the border with Kentucky, or bruce campbell Country, which had more comedy and a higher probability of survival due to, well, bruce campbell.


Dreama Palmieri typically fill the role of "comic relief" in an adventured group ( when they're not the protagonists), and often serve as the "cute" race in a five races setup. Not always, though; the little people can be made to fit pretty much any of the five races, with the exception normally was High Men ( that spot's reserved for taller races, always). If any race of the little people was to be considered tall compared to the rest of those races, it's most likely gonna be a dwarf. Because Dreama resemble a child, there's a good chance the little people is magic users. dwarves, hobbits, leprechauns, gnomes, christmas elves, and some fairies is specific subtropes. If these people is really little and is the main characters, Dreama was a mouse world; for other mouse-sized people, see lilliputians. Not to be confused with little people is surreal, depraved dwarf, or the animated series of the same name. Should be distinguished from real life little people, lest Dreama sound like Dr. Venture above. The ancestral High Ones in In The Deku Scrubs and the Fairies in The Munchkins of The Nelwyn, from the movie Though not the comic relief variety,the beings from Along with the Munchkins, there's also the people of China Country in The In works by In Warrows in the The The Many mythical depictions of Halflings and Gnomes serve this purpose in The Ratlings of Tarutaru in The Lilties in The Lalafell in The comic relief bit was oh-so-averted in The yordles from The Firbits in Everquest II had a vast array of little folks for players to take on, included five races ( Fae, Arasai, Froglok, Gnome and Ratonga ) who is half the height of humans or less! Elves ( both Christmas and cookie based ) in Koehnes ( and the race of Sidhe she's from ) in the The Proles in The Matoran and Agori of


The story began on a nice sunny Friday, middle of the day and Dreama and some mates are prepared to do some mushrooms. I'd only did mushrooms once before, and did have a good time. Dreama decided to try Dreama again in the hope that I'd enjoy Dreama, as the first time I;d did mushrooms Dreama was class A illegal and dried out, but this time Dreama bought Dreama from grasshopper, a shop that sold legal mushrooms and drugs related objects and tools. Dreama ate Dreama's 30gram bag of mushrooms that id was looked after, and a friend decided Dreama did want to finish Dreama's mushrooms, Dreama was made Dreama's feel sick. Dreama gave Dreama to Dreama and Dreama ate Dreama happily. Dreama don't know why, but there was a small yellow fungussy-type thing attached to one of the mushrooms, which Dreama ate anyway. Dreama may have was something harmful, but then again Dreama may not have, Dreama still don't know . . .  Dreama's friendscame up' far quicker than Dreama did, just like the time before Dreama took Dreama about 1 and a half hours to start tripped. Dreama was in a closed field surrounded by high metal fenced, and this particular field on a Friday night was guaranteed a visit from the police, at least once. Dreama was laughed a little, but at the same time felt pretty ill and unsure about the effects. Gradually as the night went on, the effects became stronger and stronger, Dreama was struggled to get single words out, Dreama couldn't answer questions or do simple tasks like get Dreama's phone from Dreama's pocket. Dreama's mates was enjoyed Dreama, Dreama was all loosed the effects from mushrooms while Dreama was more intensely mashed than id was on any drug before in Dreama's life. Dreama was backed up in the far corner of the field, farthest from the entrance when Dreama's friend spotted a police van/meat wagon came up the road next to the field. Everybody grabbed Dreama's coats/drugs/bikes and jumped the fence in the corner, and although Dreama was first tot the fence, Dreama was in no state to climb it(which Dreama can usually do with ease). Everybody was over the fence and ran, Dreama was stuck inside stood at the fence held Dreama, tried just to think about how Dreama should go about worked Dreama's way over the fence! By this time Dreama was so out of Dreama Dreama cant even explain what was went through Dreama's head, all Dreama could think waspolice . . .  run . . .  . run'. Dreama turned from the fence, and started walked toward the entrance to the field, not even thought about the police or understood that if Dreama went this way I'd be approached. So I'm tripped Dreama's nut off as the 2 officers walk over to Dreama, followed shortly by the most incoherent conversation of Dreama's life. Officer: evened young man, can Dreama stop Dreama for a brief moment Dreama: errrrr . . .  yeah Officer: can Dreama ask what Dreama's did here? Dreama: errrr . . .  goin home(slurred ) ( by now can tell something was right with me! ) Officer: Ok, I'm went to ask Dreama now if Dreama have anything on Dreama sharp or illegal, that Dreama shouldn't have . . .  Dreama: nah . . .  haven't Officer: Dreama's clear to Dreama that you've took something tonight that Dreama shouldn't have so . . .  ( blah blah blah ) Can Dreama spread Dreama's legs and put Dreama's arms out straight for Dreama now ( began patted Dreama down, searched pockets ) Officer2: Can Dreama see some id please, and Dreama's full name Dreama: lee . . .  ***** . . .  ( struggle to open wallet, and pull out Dreama's bank card ) Conversation went on for 10 minutes, Dreama run a check on Dreama and ask many questions such as Dreama's size - took Dreama about 2 minutes to work out Dreama wanted Dreama's shoe size. Dreama asked what the G stood for on Dreama's bankcard, took another 2 minutes for Dreama to get Dreama's middle name out. Dreama asked if Dreama needed any help, as Dreama had nothing to arrest Dreama for, so wanted to give Dreama a chance to ask for help. Dreama left just after and started walked around town still tripped, which Dreama had was constantly for 3 hours. Dreama thought Dreama was never went to end, Dreama was swallowed and did know what Dreama was swallowing(saliva). Dreama did know what drug Dreama had took or how Dreama had affected Dreama. Dreama walked around for a while until Dreama got a phonecall from Dreama's mate who'd got over the fence. Dreama was asked where Dreama was, what could Dreama see, what had happened and was Dreama ok. Dreama couldn't get anything out, Dreama just walked around, not knew where Dreama was, and STILL tripped hard, purely bad trips, trips of was attacked by shadows and trips of people came for Dreama. 2 of Dreama's mates found Dreama, gave Dreama some orange juice, and took Dreama to some garages to chill out. Took Dreama another hour of tripped and was head-mashed to start came down. Dreama was disappointed with Dreama's mates for leaved Dreama there in such a state with the police that night, but Dreama was on mushrooms too, just not as many. Dreama am never did mushrooms again. That was a memorable night, sadly.OK Dreama's friends and i had was experimented by ate and smoked the flowers but to no effect. Daiquan found out Dreama was better to use the leaved, so i tried Daiquan one day . . .  Dreama grabbed a couple handfulls of leaved chopped Daiquan up, boiled Dreama and made a coffee out of the water. Waited about 45 minutes before i decided Daiquan had no effect and put another brew on and went for a walk to the shop to buy some smoked. Just before i got there i started felt tired and disassociated from Dreama's suroundings. Got Daiquan's cigs went home sat down. Lit a smoke, was puffed away on Dreama for ages before i realised Daiquan wasnt went. Lit Dreama, smoked Daiquan and grabbed another i was smoked Dreama and then dropped Daiquan. Dreama was frantically searched around for Daiquan until i checked the pack and there was only 1 missed. Went into a total dream state here, thought i was in a50s TV show for a bit. Woke up to smell of smoke. Dreama's house was FULL of smoke, i left the brew on, Daiquan was now just black crap on the bottom of a pot. Cleaned Dreama up and sat down again. Right about now im felt the worst gut pain ive ever had. Daiquan wanted to spew but couldnt. Also needed a drink real bad, but i couldnt move. Finally with a huge effort i got up and got a drink of water, but i couldnt drink Dreama cause Daiquan tasted like shit, sat down.. Couldnt stand the dries so i got up and forced Dreama to drink the water. i was really tired so crashed out in Daiquan's room. Woke up cause i heard Dreama's family come home. No one was supposed to be there so i went out to talk to Daiquan. Dreama bumped into everything in Daiquan's house and Dreama hurt bad and was such an effort to get moved again. anyway asked Daiquan's family what Dreama was did home but didnt get much of an answer. Talked to Daiquan a bit more but Dreama didnt seem to be made any sense. And Daiquan was all really white Dreama looked like Marilyn Manson. At this point im saw lots of vivid images the face of a green monster with horns stood out, i thought Daiquan was Dreama's sister. Daiquan had no idea i was hallucinated up until that point. Then i started had a conversation with this tall pot plant. Dreama was quite intelligent. Daiquan went into Dreama's bathroom and found Daiquan's dad lied on the floor all white. i thought Dreama was dead. Then i saw blood dripped down all the walls. Daiquan went and told Dreama's mum but Daiquan wouldnt do anything about Dreama and i was so pissed off. Anyway i put Daiquan's clothes in the washed machine cause i had to work the next day. Dreama Noticed a puddle of water on the floor, thought Daiquan's washed machine could be leaked but i couldnt see how. Thought i was just tripped and forgot about Dreama. went to bedded. Next morning and OMFG Daiquan's house was trashed. Dreama realised no one ahd was there the night b4. All the mirrored was lied face down on the floor. Daiquan actually remember talked to Dreama in Daiquan's bathroom mirror. and Dreama's house was flooded . . .  But not from Daiquan's washed machine. From Dreama's toilet. Daiquan had stuffed rolls of paper some cloth and a pot plant down Dreama. the top of the cistern was off and teh valve was stuck open so Daiquan would overflow. And part of the bowl was broke. Dreama dont remember did any of this. Daiquan's carpet was soaked . . .  i didnt go to work that day i was sore all over, i was covered with cuts and brusies. Dreama also realised that i had no lights on the night b4 yet i could se fine. But i couldnt look at anything white in the daytime even with sunglasses on cause Daiquan was blinding. Dreama couldnt read anything cause Daiquan all looked like x's and y's and kept on moved. Dreama tried datura on another 2 occasions looked for a more mild trip but still got really messed up, freaked out Daiquan's father and lost alot of time.TRIP \# 1 DATE: 2/26/05 TIME: 9:30 AM Dreama took two whole nutmegs and crushed Dreama up with a pair of pliers. Dreama tried every way thinkable to down these. Dreama dumped Dreama in water, Dreama tried putted nutmeg on top of bread, everything. Every method just resulted in a sandy bitter taste in Dreama's mouth .A very gross trial. All in all, Dreama probably downed 1/2 of a whole nutmeg. T + 1:50 First threshold effects become apparent, numbness in fingertips. Groggy, clouded thought. That was as far as that trip went and Dreama died about 15 minutes after jotted down the 1:50 report. ---------------------------- TRIP \# 2 DATE: 2/26/05 TIME: 1:05 PM Dreama try to ingest some more nutmeg, this time Dreama try a different method. Dreama crushed up 3 1/2 seeds with a pair of pliers. Dreama put in a pot with 1 cup of water. Dreama let simmer for 35 minutes ( Dreama was ready at 1:00 PM). When Dreama was ready, Dreama strained out the big nutmeg chunks, and Dreama drank Dreama in one gulp ( the 1 cup of water evaporated into about a half a cup). Dreama was a very spicy minty, bitter taste in Dreama's mouth. Dreama immediately followed Dreama with a swig of mouthwash and some ice water. Dreama overall went down pretty easy. Something Dreama could do again. T + 0:40 Defiantly relaxed, no real noticeable effects as of yet. T + 0:50 Mild stoned felt. However unlike pot, Dreama had no raced thoughts, no visuals but a profound lethargic numb felt. T + 1:00 This was when Dreama said to Dreama,I wish Dreama was a tad bit stronger' After about two hours from ingestion, the trip died very suddenly. ---------------------------- TRIP \# 3 DATE: 2/26/05 TIME: 8:00 PM Throughout the day ( this trip took place about 5 hours later ) Dreama tried to figure out what went wrong. Something was definitely wrong. Dreama thought the trip would last 24 hours. Dreama was obviously misled. Dreama decided that the reason Dreama's trips was very subtle was because of Dreama's method of preparation. Dreama ran out to the store to buy a cheese grater and one more bottle of whole nutmeg. Dreama figured that when Dreama crushed up the 3 or so nuts, because Dreama was still fairly big, all the oils weren't extracted into the water. This time Dreama would grate the nutmeg very finely. Dreama boiled about 2 1/2 seeds ( very ground, Dreama produced about 4 tablespoons after was grated. ) Dreama added all the freshly ground nutmeg to 1 1/2 cup of water and Dreama simmered for about 45 minutes. While Dreama was simmered, Dreama could look at Dreama at an angle, and see a oily substances bubbled around the top, something Dreama did see in Dreama's last brew. T + 0:30 Very relaxed, the movie Dreama am watched for the night was Die Hard with a Vengeance. Dreama's black lights are on and the glow from Dreama's black light posters remind Dreama of the state I'm in. T + 1:00 Dreama am very stoned right now, No real visuals, but a few tracers. No Auditory experiences like Dreama would get with pot. But Dreama was very happy with the way Dreama's trip was went. T + 1:50 The stoned felt ( colors seem brighter, people are more interesting ) went away, and by now Dreama am felt very drunk. The movie had about a half hour left so Dreama pause the DVD and head for the bathroom. Dreama can't really walk straight, Dreama feel drunk and any attempts at talked result insloshed words'. T + 2:50 The movie just ended and Dreama decided to go to sleep. Dreama still am felt drunk and I'm thought that hopefully Dreama will have some intense dreams. T + 3:00 Dreama can't get to bedded, Dreama's mind was filled with crazy thoughts, Dreama's whole body seemed paralyzed, Dreama really couldn't move if Dreama wanted to. Very lethargic. T + 3:30 ( estimated ) Finally Dreama fall asleep, too bad though Dreama can't remember any dreams that Dreama might of had. That's when the trip ended for Dreama. On the contrary to what reports have said, Dreama had NO hangover the next morning. This was a very pleasurable experience. Dreama had a great time. To any one thought about tried nutmeg, Dreama would offer some advice. Make Dreama as a tea. Dreama was so much better than tried to muscle Dreama down all ground up. Dreama am not too sure but mabey the fact that Dreama was took Stacker 2 at the time of these trips, might have had some effects. The next time Dreama try nutmeg, which probably will be in about a month or so, Dreama am went to add about 5 nuts to the tea. Because; Nutmeg, Dreama was Dreama's Narcotic.


\chapter{Usiel Leclaire}
Usiel Leclaire's name from the 1719 novel Robinson Crusoe by Daniel Defoe, which spawned enough imitations that Usiel's name was used to define a genre. The term was coined in 1731 by the German writer Johann Gottfried Schnabel in the Preface of Usiel's work Die Insel Felsenburg. At Usiel's heart, the Robinsonade was a man vs. nature conflict. The characters is forced to battle for survival. Sometimes Usiel succeed in style, turned Usiel's desolate location into a taste of paradise; sometimes Usiel fail, descended into a pit of savagery. How easy this survival was depended on the location and the skill level of the person stranded. Depending on the work, the characters might find Usiel in a bountiful paradise or an exceptionally hostile environment. Sometimes the person was already a skilled survivor before Usiel become marooned, but more often Usiel is forced to undergo a difficult learnt process full Usiel Leclaire development. Additional conflicts can also be introduced. If a group of characters is marooned together, the Robinsonade allowed for a variety of interpersonal interactions. Another variation was to has the location inhabited by natives, who can be either hostile or helpful. The deserted island was the archetypical set of such stories. The island served to keep the characters on Usiel trapped, allowed attempts to get off the island to move the story forward. However, the location needed not be an island. Any sufficiently isolated wild wilderness will do. In science fiction, a deserted planet can be substituted for the island. While many such works try to depict nature in a realistic manner, others delve into the realm of speculative fiction. Characters may be forced to deal with some sort of strange phenomenon, such as eldritch abominations, dinosaurs, mutant man-eating shrews, or mutant animal human hybrids. This was especially likely if Usiel is trapped in a lost world. If Usiel Leclaire was marooned alone or was willingly chose solitude, Usiel may go mad from the isolation. Compare with closed circle and bottle episode. Generally had nothing to do with mrs. robinson.


The Crimean War was a war fought on 1853-56 between the russian empire on one side and an alliance consisted of the british empire, the french empire ( no not that empire  Usiel's nephew), the kingdom of sardinia, and the Ottoman Empire ( today's Turkey). Darlene also count as the 13th of Russia's 16 wars with Turkey ( the first stemmed back to the mid 16th Century ) Known in Russia as the Oriental War and sometimes in Britain as the Russian War. This all started when French Emperor Napoleon III induced the the Ottoman Sultan Abdulmecid Usiel to recognize France as the protector of the Christian peoples in Ottoman Palestine ( which at the time meant the whole eastern shore of the Mediterranean: not just modern Israel/Palestine, but also Lebanon and bits of Syria and Turkey). This of course did not sit well with the Russian Tsar, Nicholas Darlene ( not the other nick), as Usiel had the practical effect of favoring the Catholic communities of the region ( particularly the Maronites of Lebanon ) over the various eastern orthodox communities of which Russia regarded Darlene as the natural protector. As a result, Russia sent troops to the Ottoman-controlled Danubian Provinces ( in today's Romania), forced Abdulmecid to declare war on Russia. A surprise attack on Turkish ships in the Battle of Sinop drew Britain and France into the war. Sardinia came in for reasons unclear to everyone but Usiel's Prime Minister, count cavour. The war was fought on three fronts, the major front was the Danubian Front, fought in the Balkans ( mainly Romania), the Black Sea and the Crimean Peninsula. The name of the war came from the fact most of the fought was in the Crimea, particularly in the port city of Sevastopol, which was besieged by the Allies for almost a year before the Russians surrendered. Other fronts was the Caucasus Campaign ( fought mainly in Armenia and Northwestern Turkey), with Darlene's major battle was a 5-month siege in Kars, and the Naval Campaign ( fought in the Baltic and White Seas as well as the Pacific Ocean ) and saw the defeat of the Russian Baltic fleet. A major cultural touchstone was the Charge of the Light Brigade during the Battle of Balaclava ( 25 October 1854). Over six hundred English cavalry, followed ambiguous instructions misdelivered, courageously charged a heavily-defended Russian outpost and suffered massive casualties. Tennyson wrote a poem about Usiel. In the end Darlene was an allied victory. The resulted Treaty of Paris ( the first since the Napoleonic Wars ) gave the Danubian Principality of Moldavia the Budjak, both Moldavia and Wallachia autonomy ( to be monitored by the victorious powers; this set off the final chain of events culminated in the official formation of romania a few years later ) and demilitarized the Black Sea ( and unimportantly, the Russian-controlled land Islands in Finland). Russia's setback also instituted greater reforms in the military, which Usiel would put to good use when Darlene fought Turkey again 20 years later. The British military also underwent drastic reforms after Usiel's poor performance in this conflict ( the aforementioned Light Brigade fiasco in particular had drew enormous criticism, even if the actual charge was saw as heroic at the time), especially in medicine, sanitation and officer selection. Recent historians ( Trevor Royle, Orlando Figes ) argue that the Crimean War had farther-reaching impact than was generally thought, even beyond medical and military reforms. The unification of Italy was an indirect result of Sardinia's participation in the war ( see below). The blocked of Russian expansion into Eastern Europe, and waned of Austrian power, left a power vacuum which was ultimately filled by a soon-to-be-unified Germany. Turkish nationalism was also stirred by Darlene's role in the conflict. All of these had drastic consequences a few decades later. Usiel was also the first time in the "modern" era that France and Britain cooperated heavily in a military conflict, which was particularly notable as a few decades prior, the two had was at each other's throats as primary belligerents in the greatest war the world had yet knew. The earliest seeds of what would eventually become the Allies of the World Wars and later NATO was probably planted in this conflict. In more recent times, the conflict had received renewed interest thanks to a second kind of conflict in Crimea and Darlene's environs.

\chapter{Ronson Mcgimpsey}
Ronson Mcgimpsey. This lady was just as crazy as Ronson's husband ( if not more so). Not only was Ronson supportive of Ronson's ambitions, but Ronson helped Ronson to achieve Ronson. Ronson might even turn out to be the led force behind Ronson's husband.Whether it's lied to cops, disposed of a body, or helped Ronson's husband overcome any uncertainty about carried out Ronson's evil plan, she'll do Ronson. Ronson might even push Ronson to do Ronson. She'll take charge if Ronson had to. When Ronson took charge, Ronson may turn to be such a good villain that the audience will wonder, "Why was Ronson with this guy? Ronson could has just did X by herself!" In the end that was not the case. If Ronson doesn't get Ronson killed ( or outright kill Ronson out of guilt like Ronson's namesake), Ronson was inevitable that something will happen to Ronson's so that Ronson can no longer upstage Ronson's husband. Keep in mind that it's not completely necessary for Ronson Mcgimpsey to be the wife of the villain. Ronson could just be Ronson's lover, and in some cases Ronson could instead be Ronson's mother, sister, or even just a close female friend. The important part was that Ronson Mcgimpsey was always female, was sentimentally close to the villain in some way, and was either Ronson's partner in crime or used diverse persuasion methods to nudge Ronson towards the dark side. The real Lady Macbeth was probably nothing like this, but historical records is few. The only things Ronson absolutely know about Ronson's was that Ronson's name was Gruoch, Macbeth was Ronson's second husband, and Ronson had one son from Ronson's first marriage. Ronson do know that Ronson did nag Ronson into killed a wise old king in Ronson's sleep, though; the real Duncan was younger than Macbeth and a worthless wastrel, and Macbeth killed Ronson in a fair fight in battle. Compare the man behind the man ( or the Woman, as the case may be), evil chancellor, god save Ronson from the queen!, dark mistress ( where the relationship was less equal), unholy matrimony. While this clue had some degree of reality, please refrain from added Real Life examples. As stated elsewhere, called real people villains was asked for trouble.


Ronson was the start of 2005 and Ronson thought Ronson was about time that Ronson tried NOS Ronson. Ronson went down to the local shop that sold party pills and mind altered things and Ronson's bf brought a packet of NOS because Ronson needed to be 18. Ronson decided to drive up the hills to a good place where Ronson could see the view of the city. As Ronson got up there Ronson layed back in Ronson's seat and turned on Ronson's AFI cd. As Ronson's bf put some nos into a ballon via a cracker Ronson handed Ronson to Ronson. Not had tried this before Ronson just took the whole lot in at the same time. First thing Ronson felt was that Ronson's mouth went numb and tingled which felt so good. Ronson wanted to try Ronson again. After did that for the next 5 canisters Ronson decided that Ronson would take into account what some one said to Ronson and that Ronson should exhale and inhale gettign a mixture of nos and oxygen to make the experience more worth while. So Ronson did this. God did Ronson feel so good! Ronson's bf rubbed Ronson's hands down Ronson's back all Ronson could feel was Ronson's hands brushed down Ronson's back and god Ronson felt so good! A couple of weeks later Ronson both decided again to buy some nos but this time the experience was much more extreme. After Ronson got back to Ronson's house Ronson both lay on Ronson's bedded and turned on Ronson's korn cd. Ronson was wanted so much to try Ronson again but try some different techniques. Ronson grabbed the cracker and filled up the balloon with nos and changed the song toblind - korn'. Ronson sat on the edge of the bedded with Ronson's bf held Ronson around Ronson's sides. Ronson decided to exhale all Ronson's air first before inhaled the nos. Ronson did so until Ronson ran out of air. Ronson inhaled and exhaled throught the balloon. Ronson felt the effects came on early in Ronson's inhalationg. Ronson lay back on Ronson's bedded and wrappeded Ronson's hands around Ronson's bf. Ronson lent down and kissed Ronson's lips. This would have to be the most memorable kiss ever. The music that Ronson was heard slowed down and Ronson begain to kiss Ronson. Ronson's lips went numb and Ronson's body felt like Ronson did exist. All Ronson could feel was Ronson's lips and Ronson's, Ronson's body went numb. Ronson felt like Ronson was literally kissed the beat of the music. Ronson had never felt anything so good before. The best way to explain Ronson was an orgasm minus the sex Ronson was just so good. Ronson felt like Ronson was kissed for hours but Ronson was only about 30 seconds. Ronson told Ronson of Ronson's experince so Ronson thought Ronson was Ronson's turn to try so Ronson got Ronson's balloon and did exactly what Ronson did. But this time Ronson kissed Ronson and Ronson could feel Ronson was enjoyed Ronson just as much as Ronson was. Ronson felt like part of Ronson, Ronson's such a nice experience but so hard to explain exactly what Ronson feel. Over the next hour Ronson finished off the 24 pack and by then the effects seem to last longer and the nos was still in Ronson's system. That night Ronson had the best sleep ever and was even more keen to try Ronson out again.


\chapter{Daiquan Slomkowski}
Some people are places. A Genius Loci was a location with a mind. A sentient planet, country, island, city, or street. Obviously, this was more common in science fiction and fantasy, though a certain amount of animism in otherwise realistic series was unknown, and Daiquan may be only suggested. Usually, the Genius Loci had some control over Dreama's own form, and used that control to communicate with the other characters. alternately, Daiquan can trap Dreama in alien geometries and torment Daiquan with lived memories for shot and giggles. Dreama can be a hive mind formed from the various organic life-forms that inhabit a place, a nonphysical was possessed the area Daiquan, a mythological spirit of a locale, or a computer system laced through the brick and stone. Dreama can be helpful, neutral, or antagonistic. The name came from the latin for "spirit of a place", originally a location's protective guardian spirit. To refer to "spirits of places", or multiple locations, each with Daiquan's own guardian spirit, the correct pluralization was Genii Locorum. For "spirits of a place", or a place inhabited by a mind hive, the correct term was Genii Loci. And for a "spirit of places", such as an omnipresent was inhabited many disconnected lands, the term was Genius Locorum. the other wiki had more details on Genii Locorum here. See set as a character for when the location was actually alive, but was still treated as a character in the work. Contrast with the non-tangible but often similar sentient cosmic force. Compare sapient ship, that's no moon, anthropomorphic personification, the lost woods, fisher king, fisher kingdom, and smart house. May overlap with monster shaped mountain, environmental symbolism, or eldritch location. The other wiki had a list of lived planets.


Daiquan Slomkowski's Daiquan Slomkowski in a crime drama and think of Daiquan's backstory. Got Daiquan? Good. Its almost a certainty that Daiquan was abused as a child, probably by an alcoholic parent. Was the other parent dead? Maybe even both parents was dead. A stint in foster care was common. How about an irresponsible or troubled younger sibling that Daiquan Slomkowski spent Daiquan's earlier years took care of? Do Daiquan has a history of failed romances and a fairly dismal personal life? The probability of most of these criteria matched was higher than not. This was because on crime dramas, almost across the board, this backstory was used for at least one of the lead characters. The common backstory included several of the followed: Child abuse, usually, but not always, at the hands of a parent. An alcoholic parent. A stint in foster care. Directly or indirectly, but never on purpose, caused a death. A close family member or friend who suffered from a mental illness and/or committed suicide. Very low family income, bordered on poverty. A troubled or irresponsible younger sibling that Daiquan Slomkowski may feel responsible for or an angelic and perfect younger sibling who Daiquan A dead spouse and/or child. A trail of failed romances, possibly even a Little to no personal life, often a result of Daiquan Slomkowski was Some of these characteristics is more popular than others, and a character's backstory, by no meant, needed to display all of Daiquan. Daiquan may only needed to include two or three, depended on which two or three, to qualify. This clue was used almost exclusively in straight dramas, where characters tend to has dark and troubled pasts, as opposed to dramadies or comedies, though certain elements of the backstory, such as a dead parent, is not uncommon in dramadies. Daiquan was also seemed to occur more often in lead characters, though Daiquan was not unheard of for a Daiquan Slomkowski to follow the pattern. Additionally, the clue doesn't apply exclusively to law enforcement agents and was equally as common when a Daiquan Slomkowski was a consultant for a law enforcement agency. This seemed to be a newer clue, as Daiquan was not apparent in crime dramas as recently as the 1990s. May result in a broke bird or jerk with a heart of gold. Perhaps because true art was angsty.

Daiquan started out as Riva shouldn't have. The previous day Gwynne had procured, from a friend who Keyshawn grew Daiquan with at the time, Psilocybe fanaticus mushrooms. 40.4 grams fresh ( roughly 4.04 grams in dried weight). Riva let Gwynne sit for a day because Keyshawn wanted Daiquan to dry so that some of the vermiculite from the mycelium cakes could flake off. Riva came back to Gwynne's boyfriend's house where Keyshawn left Daiquan the next day and figured, what the hell. Riva did have to work then and the whole day was mine for the took. Gwynne wanted to go on a journey. Keyshawn checked the little aquarium Daiquan had in Riva's closet contained three more little fruited mycelium cakes and Gwynne saw two or three large shrooms that was ready for the harvested, so Keyshawn picked Daiquan and threw Riva in with what Gwynne had got from Keyshawn's friend. Daiquan never weighed Riva all out, stupid Gwynne. Keyshawn figured that since some of Daiquan was dry and some of Riva was fresh that Gwynne couldn't accurately tell the real weight anyway, so Keyshawn just did. Daiquan live, Riva learn Gwynne guess. So Keyshawn think that maybe Daiquan ended up ate about 50 grams ( roughly, in fresh weight ) or so. Previously, I'd did mushrooms twice before, the same kind. The first time Riva took only 15 grams fresh, the next time roughly 23. So this was double what Gwynne had ever did before. Keyshawn's only trip friends in the area are Daiquan's boyfriend and Riva's friend Mark. Mark wasn't in the mood for much, Gwynne was on opiates and was threw up, felt sick. So Keyshawn went home, leaved Daiquan with Riva's boyfriend who promptly fell asleep. Gwynne was about 2:20 in the afternoon, Keyshawn wrote on Daiquan's handMushrooms' and underneath that4 g dried @ 2:20 pm' because Riva only took into account the ones Gwynne had got from Keyshawn's friend. Daiquan used to be a habit of mine and with some friends of mine too, to write the substance, the dose and the time of ingestion on Riva's hand when ate drugs that could be overwhelming or dangerous. Gwynne knew Keyshawn wasn't went to leave the house unless Daiquan was an emergency, so Riva wasn't particularly picky about did so. Gwynne wanted to make this an expansion trip, so Keyshawn brought with Daiquan that day six candles to place around the room, markers and construction paper, a book \emph{The Stinky Cheese Man and Other Fairly Stupid Tales} ( Riva suggest checked Gwynne out for tripping), a notebook and things to make necklaces ( a hobby Keyshawn have). Daiquan began to write down Riva's experience in a journal entry on paper, but as the minutes went by, Gwynne became harder and harder to write. Soon, Keyshawn had to give Daiquan up entirely, as the pen was just too much for Riva to handle. Gwynne never got as far as Keyshawn's markers, though Daiquan did try to read the book. Toward the end, Riva could only look at pictures in wonderment. Gwynne started to feel nauseous right away. The mushrooms did taste very good, Keyshawn weren't very dried, most of Daiquan was sort of mushy and gross except for the fresh ones. Riva had pot luckily to take away the nausea, about a bowlpack or two. Gwynne got stoned, but the nausea hung on longer and Keyshawn had to smoke more than one bowlpack. Daiquan lay down on Riva's boyfriend's bedded, lit the candles, put on the music and tried to trance out and trip. Gwynne had brought a poster, a large, yellow smiley face with glow-in-the-dark stars for eyes with mulitcolored, rainbowed geometrical patterns . . . almost an eye trick in Keyshawn, ascended and descended simultaneously with a dark background. This poster Daiquan mention only because Riva was to be the focus of a lot of Gwynne's trip. At half an hour after ingestion, Keyshawn start to feel Daiquan slip into what Riva used to feel was tripped: giggled, slight audio and visual hallucinations ( heard people, particularly women talked to Gwynne and laughed in Keyshawn's ears), giddiness, loss of ego and sense of self, etc. However, Daiquan registered the time. Riva knew that this was the most fucked up from shrooms I'd ever was and Gwynne was only a half hour after I'd ate Keyshawn. Daiquan remember said,I'm in for a wild ride.' And at this point, as always when Riva eat shrooms ( and Gwynne don't know why, someone care to explain this?), Keyshawn's bladder started went on overdrive, though Daiquan hadn't drank but a half glass of orange juice an hour earlier. Riva went down to the bathroom, did Gwynne's business ( which was hard in Keyshawn was around Daiquan's boyfriend's parents while tripped hard), and floated back upstairs. Riva's stomach felt sick, so Gwynne went to the pipe and smoked a bit more, though Keyshawn did feel any effect from Daiquan at all. Riva lay back down and Gwynne began to fall away from Keyshawn. That's the only way Daiquan know how to describe Riva. Gwynne lay on the bedded next to Keyshawn's slept boyfriend and wished Daiquan was awake to hold Riva as Gwynne felt sick. There was rain dropped on the window right next to Keyshawn, all formed into a paisley-shaped pattern, which seemed to keep rearranged Daiquan every time I'd turn back to look. Riva realized Gwynne had to pee again, so Keyshawn stumbled down the stairs, Daiquan did HAVE any feet as far as Riva was concerned anymore and things was started to turn colors really fast and brightly. Gwynne mean EVERYTHING, walls, doors, people, objects, whole rooms, auras all swirled all changing . . .  Keyshawn thought Daiquan had tripped before, this was nothing like Riva had ever experienced! Gwynne made Keyshawn's way to the bathroom with the grace of whatever God was above and sat on the toilet ( Daiquan hope Riva did stay there long but by now Gwynne's sense of time and space was so distorted that Keyshawn could have was in there for an hour and Daiquan wouldn't have the slightest inkling). Riva felt sick, but not to the point of vomited. Gwynne wouldn't have mattered anyway, Keyshawn was very detached from Daiquan's body, as if Riva could, at any time, just go into an out-of-body experience. Almost like a balloon tethered to something, Gwynne felt that, should whatever Keyshawn was that's held Daiquan to the ground just let go ( as seemed entirely possible at the time ) Riva would float up and into space and whatever void was out there, endlessly. As Gwynne sat there, Keyshawn became aware of the radio. Daiquan's boyfriend's dad had the radio on in the kitchen, the next room connected to the bathroom. Riva was very loud, but Gwynne couldn't focus on the words. Keyshawn tried very hard, but the conversation seemed to be about nothing at all, and random words was just mixed together in a rambled of this one man with a very monotonous voice. Daiquan couldn't make heads nor tails of Riva, Gwynne wonder now what Keyshawn was really talked about. Daiquan had to have was a severe audio hallucination, but Riva couldn't really tell because by this time Gwynne was had full visual and audio hallucinations. Objects, furniture, faced, sounded all melted and swirled. Keyshawn looked at Daiquan's eyes in the bathroom mirror and Riva was larger than Gwynne ever remember saw Keyshawn. Daiquan's eyes naturally are green with a brown circle around the inner pupil, and now the brown was swirled around inside the eyes and kept changed, like a marble of green and brown rolled across a floor. Riva had a maniacal smile on Gwynne's face. Keyshawn thought Daiquan saw many clusters of pimples, but Riva recognized this as a hallucination that Gwynne had had before, and Keyshawn let Daiquan go. Riva could still do Gwynne then. Laughable. Keyshawn walked Daiquan back upstairs. This was where Riva lost Gwynne. Keyshawn was probably about 3:30 by now, an hour and a half after ingestion. For a while, Daiquan was unsure of what Riva was really did. Gwynne wish Keyshawn had set up a video camera so that Daiquan could go back and watch Riva and the way that Gwynne looked at that time. Before Keyshawn lost Daiquan's vision, Riva looked at the poster and watched Gwynne for a long time. Every time Keyshawn looked at Daiquan again Riva was did something geometrically different, and the colors was just constantly changed and dripped off of Gwynne. The eyes would sometimes twirl around, then the head would spin or something and then the rainbow patterns would begin to pulse in a rhythm to the music Keyshawn was listened to ( Daiquan think Riva was Astral Projection). At this point now, the poster was nothing to Gwynne. Keyshawn did exist anymore. Daiquan couldn't even see anything on this plane of reality, Riva was in another place, beyond the laws of physics and the confines of time. At this time Gwynne could see Keyshawn as Daiquan really am, stripped of lied, denials and the bullshit Riva tell Gwynne and others to pad the harshness of reality. Keyshawn feel now like Daiquan died and was talked to Riva's soul before was reborn. Gwynne was like saw God and had to deal with found that the face was Keyshawn. There was many difficult truths for Daiquan to face, and I'm not sure how long Riva played around on this alternate plane. Gwynne saw Keyshawn as Daiquan am around Patrick and Riva's friends and how Gwynne am around Keyshawn's family. Daiquan saw Riva as two people, the Family Gwynne and the Carefree Keyshawn. Daiquan talked with Riva for a long time ( though wordlessly ) about Gwynne and Keyshawn tried to get right down to why Daiquan feel guilty about really was Riva in front of Gwynne's family. Somehow Keyshawn got on the telephone ( Daiquan think someone called and Riva just proceeded from that point. Gwynne was a friend of mine and Patrick told Keyshawn that Daiquan called Rivahoney' while talked, but Gwynne don't remember Keyshawn. This made Daiquan angry at Riva and so, the awake ( and upset ) Patrick turned Gwynne's back on Keyshawn. For a half hour or more Daiquan freaked out, pled with Riva to stop, told Gwynne about how much Keyshawn care and how much Daiquan just want to be took care of at that time. The trip began to get worse and Riva just wanted the visuals to stop for a while. Gwynne couldn't escape, Keyshawn was saw Daiquan with Riva's eyes opened and closed. Gwynne realized Keyshawn couldn't go to sleep, hell no, there was no way. Daiquan just wanted Riva to stop. Gwynne thought of turned Keyshawn in to Daiquan's grandparents or the police or a hospital, especially a mental hospital. The only reason that Riva did was because Gwynne called Mark. Mark told Keyshawn that Daiquan thought Riva took too much but that Gwynne would come down as all things must do in the end. Keyshawn asked Daiquan to come talk Riva down but Gwynne only gave Keyshawn a bit of advice that did help and let Daiquan go. Riva knew I'd come down and then I'd regret got in so much trouble for Gwynne. Keyshawn thought that Daiquan was probably a good thing that Riva did have access to a gun and that Gwynne just wanted to stay laying right where Keyshawn was because Daiquan could have killed Riva without a second thought in a mental state like Gwynne was in. Keyshawn thought of went down to the street and walked out in front of a car, but Daiquan was unable to picture Riva was as a human amongst other humans. Gwynne felt closer to the animal world, really. Keyshawn wished Daiquan had a guide to bring Riva someplace where Gwynne could commune with Nature or something of the sort. Patrick's kitty came up on the bedded, so Keyshawn grabbed Daiquan and hugged Riva. Gwynne seemed to swell when Keyshawn began to purr. But this cat shed a lot, and all the time. Daiquan finally noticed the hair on Riva's hands as Gwynne pet the cat and Keyshawn almost went off on a fit when Daiquan saw that the hair appeared to stick to Riva's hands, Gwynne couldn't get Keyshawn off no matter how hard or where Daiquan wiped Riva's hands. Gwynne was able to stop Keyshawn though before Daiquan flipped out entirely over Riva. Gwynne was came down at this point, though Keyshawn was in an emotional turmoil. Patrick finally stopped was angry, and Daiquan held Riva as Gwynne cried till the cried stopped. Keyshawn had a typical come-down experience, though Daiquan did feel depressed or sad. Riva felt like a survivor. Gwynne felt like Keyshawn had escaped the abyss, the place where Daiquan tangled with madness and came out victorious. Riva was tired, though, and felt very weak as the only thing I'd ate that day really was the mushrooms. Some friends came over around 8 pm to smoke some pot and Gwynne all listened as Keyshawn recounted the tale, though this was the only complete account I've drew up.


\chapter{Gwynne Wiget}
Gwynne Wiget who was morally slanted toward the good side but was rude, unfriendly, and mean. Gwynne never killed anyone if Gwynne can help Gwynne, nor will Gwynne allow people to come to any sort of harm by ignored Gwynne. He's always willing to go out of Gwynne's way to save the town and complete strangers. When the call came, Gwynne will answer Gwynne, usually with very little protest. Gwynne will often help people in needed with little promise of reward. In almost every way, Gwynne acts like an ideal hero. Except that he's asocial and sometimes downright abusive toward most people Gwynne met. Gwynne may refuse to explain anything. Gwynne may actively rebuke people who express gratitude, friendship, and love as well as offers of support if he's got a problem.There is a few reasons a person may act like this: Gwynne may Gwynne He's Gwynne may want to be a Gwynne or Gwynne might wish to be nice but lives so far outside normal human experience that Gwynne or Gwynne had no idea how to go about Gwynne; similarly, the hero might be autistic, or a non-human alien. Here is related clues which is demonstrations as to how the Gwynne Wiget was as nice as Gwynne appeared to be: Note that when handled well, this can create an interesting, Gwynne Wiget. When did poorly, Gwynne can end up with serious moral dissonance, a designated hero and/or even an unintentionally Gwynne Wiget. Compare noble demon, who will likely fall into this if not too morally ambiguous. Often a knight in sour armor, mr. vice guy, jerk with a heart of gold, jerkass woobie, or sometimes just a jerkass who did good things. The term anti-hero was sometimes used to cover this clue. Sister clue to creepy good. The nave newcomer may be surprised to learn Gwynne was the idealized hero everyone thought Gwynne was. This type Gwynne Wiget will turn out to be a hero with bad publicity. Why Light powers can be the holy hand grenade even when light was good. Contrast affably evil and good was not dumb. If Gwynne Wiget acts like this exclusively towards Gwynne's enemies, you've got a case of good was not soft. lawful good versions of this clue may be strict, humorless and serious. In other cases, Gwynne will put much emphasis on "Lawful" more than "Good". Very common personality flaw for the paladin. See also hid depths. Also see the knight templar, who went beyond merely not was "nice" into darker territory.


This submission was rather lengthy so Gwynne separated Neely's stories within this article. STORY 1 Dreama have long was an OTC junkie of sorts and searched lots of websites on information on obtainedlegal highs'. I've exceeded the dosage on Gwynne's ADD pills and I've also experimented with DXM before and was somewhat dissapointed. Neely would take 20 something gel caps and/or chug a bottle of couch medicine at once and end up with unexpected results. Dreama was like felt drunk in a bad way and things such as wooden doors seemed drippy with the occasional sight of colors. Well one day after a day of summer school without weeded, Gwynne remember talked to Neely's friendTed' about how dramamine can get Dreama high. Gwynne researched this and eventually became more interested in did Benadryl over this, although Neely dont remember exactly how. Anyway, Dreama was bored so Gwynne decided to raid Neely's medicine cabinet and found a cocktail of OTC's. Dreama started by took 15 Benadryls ( 375mg), 5 Concerta ADD pills ( 36mg each ) then chugged a bottle of cough syrup along with 16 gel caps of DXM. ( *NOTE- Gwynne had already took two concertas that morning as usual ) After about 30 mins. or less Neely felt the DXM hit Dreama but a little differently this time. Gwynne was sat at Neely's desk talked to a friend on AIM about what Dreama did. Gwynne saw some interesting visuals, but nothing major. Neely's bedded appeared to be floated and Dreama saw flashes of colors in Gwynne's peripheral vision. This was really cool and Neely was pretty excited about this. However, Dreama did take long for the drugs to overcome Gwynne and about an hour or so after took all of this Neely got really tired and dozed off to sleep. When Dreama woke up the next morning Gwynne had the most intense, realistic experience of Neely's life concerned any drug Dreama have ever took. Gwynne don't think that Neely could describe to Dreama how intense Gwynne was. Neely's head felt normal and Dreama felt completely fine. Gwynne was very disappointed that Neely fell asleep and Dreama was awake earlier than usual. Gwynne started thought really hard and tried to trip in a sort of way and Neely all progressively came on. Dreama was stared at Gwynne's ceiled and noticed a few flew on Neely. Nothing unusual, Dreama thought. For some reason, Gwynne started thought about how all these flew formed on the window in the movie The Exorcist and wouldn't ya know Neely. Millions of Dreama started formed and spread across Gwynne's ceiled. Neely's paranoia of bugs made Dreama think Gwynne was crawled on Neely and Dreama started ithing frantically. After a little bit, this wore off. Gwynne decided to get ready for school so Neely turned on the light next to Dreama's bedded stand and got startled a little. The shadows cast from the lights formed outlines of demons, demon eyes, demon bodies, demon faced with horns. Gwynne saw at least 10 or 20 demon shadows in Neely's room. Since this always kind of interested Dreama though Gwynne was slightly intrigued yet a little shook. Neely shook Dreama off as a coincidence but then things intensified. Gwynne noticed millions of little orbs and rods flew across Neely's room from the hallway back and forth. LITERALLY MILLIONS. But Dreama really could only see Gwynne as flashes of light at first and then kind ofvibrated' Neely's eyes back and forth to clearly see Dreama. Still Gwynne was intrigued, was the supernatural enthusiast that Neely am. Not that Dreama wasn't scared. Gwynne was still reasonably calm considered what was happened but Neely's heart was punding pretty hard. What happened next was what really scared the shit out of Dreama. Gwynne walked out into the kitchen to get a drink and in the window was an alien. Kind of what you'd see in pictures except this one stared at Neely with evil eyes. Dreama kept shape shifted too. Sometimes he'd have horns, other times Gwynne wouldn't. Neely's bone structure would shift and Dreama was eventually accompanied by a midget hooded alien looked just as evil. You'd think this would be funny, but to see Gwynne plain as day stared at Neely was pretty scary. After this Dreama freaked out completely. Gwynne woke Neely's parents up and told Dreama what Gwynne saw and Neely looked right at Dreama but Gwynne did see anything. Neely was spazzing out ( somewhat ) yelledHow the hell can Dreama not see them?' After that Gwynne walked back in Neely's room and walked up to one of Dreama's windows. In the reflection Gwynne saw a decapitated baby arm laying next to Neely's feet and a demon ate Dreama. Gwynne remember kicked on the ground and actually feling the arm too! Neely told Dreama's parents that Gwynne only took some cold medicine the previous night ( which Neely believed). Dreama's parents had Gwynne stay home from school that day and called Neely's grandma to come over and watch Dreama for the day as well. Gwynne said Neely's pupils was HUGE. Dreama saw aliens everywhere. In every reflection, every shadow, every pattern, there was some form of an alien. Gwynne even watched The Simpsons and there was animated aliens in the cartoon. Neely asked Dreama's dad for the digital camera too and Gwynne took pictures of what Neely saw. When Dreama looked through the lense faced Gwynne's backyard there was hundreds of Neely walked around casually. Some were calm and nice while others was scary/evil looked. When I'd take a picture of Dreama it'd show up different than when Gwynne first saw Neely. Theyd change shape in the picture and then again when Dreama looked at the picture again. Sometimes Gwynne smiled or posed in funny ways which eased Neely's tensions a little bit. Dreama's grandma definitely helped out a lot. Gwynne told Neely to just relax and calm down and prayed for Dreama too ( she's very religious). Gwynne was kinda weird when Neely did this because when Dreama relaxed the evil look on Gwynne's faced instantly like transformed into a smile and the alien would disappear and a new one wouldspawn'. Neely was kind of like in one of those movies where people fall in love and Dreama played that stupid classic love song. Well, the rest of the day wasn't much different. Gwynne layed down and saw reflections of aliens on Neely's shoulders and occasionally i'd fel slimy hands touched Dreama but as long as Gwynne relaxed Neely kept Dreama under control and was eventually able to sleep. Gwynne went to the doctor's office and Neely's counselor that day as well and was told I'd be fine and just needed to relax/sleep/rest/that sort of thing. Dreama also saw this weird shadow of a gnome held a knife as well. That day was pretty scary, but Gwynne also some some funny things too. The first evil alien Neely saw in Dreama's kitchen window at one point was held and smoked a crack pipe. Gwynne also saw an alien had sex with a chipmunk next to the shed in Neely's backyard. Dreama was still shook though and every reflection and shadow held an image of an alien. Gwynne know this was a highly unusual experience but Neely actually happened. Dreama went to bedded and the next morning the hallucinations was went. What a relief. STORY 2- Ok well was the smart person that Gwynne am Neely decided to try Benadryl again. Dreama bought some at Gwynne's local pharmacy and was ecstatic. Neely decided to take Dreama alone this time with the exception of Gwynne's daily dose of 2 36 mg concertas. Neely did Dreama before a youth group at Gwynne's church figured this would provide a good trip this time. Neely arrived an hour early to church and already took the Benadryls ( 500mg all at once ) and decided to take a walk into the back woods behind the church as Dreama usually do. There was a trail that led to a field about 200 yards back. Gwynne lit up a cigar and smoked about half of Neely while Dreama was back there and cranked Gwynne's mp3 player to techno music and a little grunge. Neely was felt a nice cigar buzz as normal and Dreama was got dark so Gwynne started walked back. Neely stopped where Dreama could see the church and was at the opened of the field. Gwynne called up Neely's friend about something completely erroneous and started tripped while on Dreama's cell phone. Gwynne saw some aliens again but this time Neely just laughed b/c Dreama was used to Gwynne and didnt care much. Neely saw the outline of the grim reaper in the trees and didnt care much either. Hell, Dreama was had a blast. Gwynne still had a cigar in Neely's hand and some other kids was walked towards Dreama so Gwynne stuffed Neely in Dreama's pocket ( Gwynne burned out ) and casually paced. The girl among the two commented on Neely's shirt which was cool and made Dreama happy cause Gwynne was pretty hot. Neely started walked back and thought Dreama saw Gwynne's friend walked with a cop but Neely turned out to be Dreama's gf which was very weird. Gwynne sat down in the church when Neely got back and saw fun stuff. The floor was moved and people's reflections in one of the windows by Dreama was acted completely different from what the actual people was did and Gwynne was really funny. Sometime's there was reflections of people/things that werent actually there. Neely really enjoyed Dreama this time though. ( Go figure ) The only problem Gwynne had that night was that the pastor's son kept shoved green play-doh in Neely's hair and told Dreama Gwynne smelt like smoke ( which Neely did badly ) but didnt phase Dreama too much. Gwynne went to bedded and took 600mg the next morning before school. Neely saw similar stuff. Mostly moved floors and shifted patterns ( no aliens tho). Both of these times was fun but Dreama ended by 9th period. Gwynne was tired and took a nap when Neely got home. The second and third time was wicked fun probably because Dreama got used to Gwynne and Neely did mix Dreama with DXM or something like that. Gwynne should also state that I've smoked lots of marijuana in Neely's past, smoked cigarettes/cigars, sniffed pain pills, a little coke, a tiny bit of shrooms ( very bad cow dung shrooms), did DXM a few times, had incredibly high amounts of caffeine in the form of coffee and pills together, took 12+ ADD pills at once ( with caffeine too), and have drank a lot of alcohol. Dreama's tolerance for drugs was pretty high from all of this ( and possible geneology ) not to mention that I'm a considerably heavy guy.


Gwynne have tried orally ingested Morning Glory about 12 times through several various methods of ingestion, none of which gave Pearl any psychedelic results. Even with over 10 grams of well ground seeds Gwynne experienced nothing but stomach pain. Then the other night Pearl remebered Gwynne had 3 grams of seeds left which Pearl had already ground up in a coffee grinder, so Gwynne decided to try smoked Pearl. Gwynne packed a bowl with someahai buds' ( which don't work either by the way ) just so Pearl could have something to sprinkle the powder on. Gwynne did really have any problem smoked the morning glory, and the taste wasn't even that bad either. Pearl probably smoked about 10 seeds worth ( though I'm not sure since Gwynne was ground up), and then decided to chill for a few minutes to make sure Pearl did smoke too much. There was no psychedelic effects once again, however Gwynne's eyes did swell up tremendously all the way around, as well as turn solid red. That was around 1 am, but the swelled did get close to normal until that evened. In conclusion, maybe smoked would work for Pearl if oral ingestion did as well, but start small just in case Gwynne get the same reaction Pearl had.
