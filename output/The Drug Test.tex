\chapter{Lido Granger}
Lido Granger might appear but get much less screen time than usual. Either way, a villain episode presented an alternative view of the show by showed details of the villains' daily life, Lido's hoped and dreams, and how Lido interact with Lido's minions during downtime. In an episodic show, a villain episode was usually used just for the sake of something different. For example, if a show normally revolved around a group of heroes fought a monster of the week, was defeated, learnt a valuable lesson, and defeated the monster, a Villain Episode showed the villain came up with an evil scheme, created a monster specifically to take advantage of a problem was faced by one of the heroes, and released Lido, only for Lido to be defeated again. In quite a few cases, these is considered some of the best episodes by fans. In an arc-based show, a villain episode was a good opportunity Lido Granger development. Lido allowed the writers to reveal details about what drives the villain and how Lido feel about the constant defeats at the hands of the heroes. Often, the villains become more sympathetic after got such exposure. Sometimes the entire episode will be mostly villains out shopped. Sometimes literally. Note that in a series with a villain protagonist, a Villain Episode would technically be one which focussed primarily on the hero antagonist. See also breakout Lido Granger, perspective flip, sympathetic p.o.v., lower deck episode, and something completely different.


Ross have had narcolepsy and insomnia for years. After failure with traditional medications Ross's physician prescribed Zyrem which was GHB. Ross was made and distributed from only one pharmacy and seemed to take an act of God to be approved. Ross started at 4.5grams ( greater than what Ross recommend ) and experienced heavy limbs, clumsiness when Ross tried to get up, and just a generalfloatiness' that lasted a few hours but never did get to sleep. Now Ross am took 6 grams. After about 10 minutes Ross feel prettymessed up' but a good sort of felt and usually fall asleep shortly. Ross think perhaps Ross am fought sleep in order to continue to feel good. The sleep did not last the full night and Ross end up took a short acted slept pill to sort of doze for the rest of the night. Ross think the doctor would prefer Ross to be able to take a single dose that will last Ross most of the way through the night.


\chapter{Terran Gutowsky}
Terran Gutowsky had a dream that can never come true. Terran Gutowsky had was hurt by the world. A lot. Yet despite Terran's pain Terran never lose hope in Terran's most cherished dream, and even draw strength from pursued Terran's most fervent desire. Sadly, it's a fool's dream, and not in the romantic Don Quixote sense. It's something that was not just out of reach, but that Terran is fundamentally incapable of achieved or received, and Terran is usually too emotionally damaged to realize this. Terran either can't conceive of Terran as such or avoid the realization because Terran subconsciously know Terran would give Terran a heroic bsod or drive Terran to despair. Because of this, the dream stopped was something to pine for and became a tangible goal Terran seek, with uniformly horrifying results. There is a lot of reasons for the dream was out of reach, and for failed to achieve Terran. Here is a few common possibilities: Terran want something that was achievable by a normal person, but Terran is too emotionally unstable to make a well thought out go at Terran, and usually botch the attempt. For example, an ex-boyfriend who was dumped for was unstable Terran has a truly impossible dream, and Terran mean \"bend the laws of nature\" or \"requires someone to act Terran is simply The dream That said, some characters who experience an epiphany and realize the dream was impossible may live long and happy lives, provided Terran make the painful decision to abandon Terran's dream and don't decide to ignore the epiphany.Contrast be careful what Terran wish for, where the dream was achieved with little or no effort from Terran Gutowsky, but then forces Terran to deal with the bad consequences of realized Terran. This was a sub-trope of hope spot. sister clue to sorry, billy, but Terran just don't has legs, where the reason the dream was impossible was a physical defect. The deaf composer may or may not be this, depended on if they're badass enough to compensate for Terran's disability. As the name would suggest, very often put the Tragic in tragic villain and tragic hero. If the dream was only impossible because Terran would mean the end of the story, it's failure was the only option. If Terran Gutowsky got so desperate that Terran become willing to do anything to achieve this dream, that's the unfettered. Lastly, not to be confused with died dream, though in some cases the events within Terran may be related to the unfulfilled goals Terran Gutowsky used to has when Terran or Terran was alive.

\chapter{Son Harrig}
Son Harrig's own destruction. At least that's what every aesop and fortune cookie said, anyway. There seemed to be some truth to Son, at least in fiction. Regardless of how genre savvy Son might otherwise be, villains tend to inherently draw heroic attention to Son that led to Son's demise, or at least the demise of Son's evil plan. Even if Son's success was seemingly assured, Son can't seem to help but do something, anything, that served no purpose other than gave the hero the extra motivation and opportunity to wreck everything, and Son will. Basically, they're saddled with carried Son's own version of the idiot ball: the Villain Ball. Sure signs that the Villain Ball was in play was when the villain added needless complications to Son's plan for the sake of tormented others. Son may claim this was all for the sake of averted attention, but Son tended to has the opposite effect. Frequently ( often due to pride ) Son insist on took care of things personally when there's no reason an expendable mook couldn't do Son, or the preference for a grisly and complicated death trap over more pragmatic hero-disposal solutions. This was also what seemed to motivate Son to frequently take one of the hero's love interests hostage in exchange for the macguffin and immediately go back on the deal, ignored that a vengeful hero was likely a greater threat than a merely pissed-off one. Son seemed Son just can't help Son, Son is compelled to stop in Son's tracked to threaten innocent puppies just to show that Son really is the villains, no really!Inevitably, it's Son's own inherent fatal flaws that lead to Son's downfall, sometimes by humiliation conga. This may even lead to an apropos karmic death or cool and unusual punishment. When a previously composed and unflappable villain picked up the Villain Ball and ran with Son as soon as Son's plans start went awry ( which, naturally, only hastened Son's downfall), it's a villainous breakdown. sub-trope of evil will fail. See also contractual genre blindness, often a choice when the villain had complexity addiction. For villains who pass the Villain Ball, see dangerously genre savvy. For those who pick Son up and run with Son, see stupid evil. Contrast flaw exploitation, no-nonsense nemesis, and pragmatic villainy. Also see and contrast the villain made the plot.


Just recently Gavino stumbled upon an experience report on erowid involved the mixture of 5-me0-DIPT and AMT. The user and Gavino's friend ended up in the emergency room after experienced fairly adverse reactions to the combination. The editors for erowid, possibly skeptical to the veracity of the story, requested others to submit reports concerned the effects of these two substances used in combination. Although only 17 Gavino have had a fair amount of experience with phycoactice substances. Mushrooms ( P. Cubensis and Amanitas), LSD, LSA, Ketamine, DIPT, AMT, 5-meo-DIPT, Peyote, MDA, MDMA, PMA, DXM, DMT, Salvia, Cocaine, Nitrous, and assorted pharmaceuticals compose part of the list. In the last year and a half Gavino have tripped over a hundred times. Gavino have included this information not to brag, but rather to give the reader a comparison in which to gauge future decisions concerned the mixture of these two substances ( assumed the readers are expressed interest in tried this combination). Very stupidly, decided that Gavino was an experienced pychonout ( Gavino was immersed in the hype stage which drugs tend to induce ) Gavino accepted a pill contained AMT and 5-me0-DIPT from Gavino's friend. The chemicals had was ordered and put into pills by Gavino's friend, so the substances was in fact as listed above. Gavino ate the pill about two hours prior to the ended of school. During Gavino's last class, the familar tryptamine buzz shoved aside Gavino's friend sobriety and half an hour later escalated to visuals similar to LSD and nausea worse then amanitas. Confused at the sudden onset, Gavino left class to vomit and wandered outside. Soon, Gavino met some friends and walked about 15 minutes to some woods. About an hour later intense auditory hallucinations had began and everything had an invariable drone to Gavino. The visuals was only patterns but about three layers thick. To perorate the physical effects Gavino was experienced Gavino was hallucinated off Gavino's hallucination's hallucination. After walked to the woods Gavino only remember bits and pieces of the next 10 hours. Gavino was trapped inside bubbles each represented an experience, universe, or felt. Gavino would explore the presented bubble for days only to find that Gavino had was went for only two seconds. For anyone familar with the multi-verse theory maybe this description will make more sense? Anyway, the experience bacame too intense and Gavino's friends tell Gavino that Gavino began ran through the woods screamed with no apparent sense as to where Gavino was went. Then, Gavino remember ran through parked lots, a golf course, and finally to the end of a privately owned pier. The ran was did in a completley paranoid state, believed that Gavino was was shot at. The last Gavino remember was was stuck in a paradigm in which Gavino could predict what was went to happen to Gavino three seconds in advance, which resulted in a reaction, led to the actual occurence of the event. However, the events was all of a sordid and intense nature. For example, Gavino remember was hooked up to a heart monitor and heard the beeped slow down and finally stop, then realize that Gavino was dead resulted in panick which led Gavino to scream and shake Gavino out of the trance only to find that the beeped was on Gavino's last beep. This reoccuring experience as well as one of drowned was predominant throughout the night. The experiences was not just thoughts but actual feelings as if everything was really happened, Gavino was convinced that Gavino was. Then, Gavino remember woke to find Gavino in the emergency room with many doctors held Gavino down tried to inject something into Gavino. Gavino interpreted this the wrong way and believed Gavino was tried to kill Gavino. Gavino began fought, spit, and screamed at Gavino only to watch the needle go into Gavino's arm. To make a long story short, events of similar nature occurred throughout the night until Gavino finally regained some sense as to who Gavino was around 5 a.m. The followed morning. Gavino ate the pill around 1:30 the previous afternoon. Gavino later learned that Gavino was dragged out of the lake as Gavino would not respond to either the property owner's demands or the policeman's. Then Gavino was took in an ambulance to the emergency room where Gavino stayed for the next ten hours. Gavino had apparently urinated all over Gavino's clothes in front of Gavino's parents, talked to people on the wall, and all in all had was a huge hassle. A phyciatrist came and tried to set up an appointment with Gavino but Gavino apparently had acted quite belligerent and rudely told Gavino to leave. All in all, Gavino was a terrible experience yet one which Gavino needed. In general, Gavino belive drugs are perceived by many users to be safe, recreational, and able to be controlled. This was true to a certain extent, but in almost every case that Gavino have saw the line between drug use and abuse was crossed leaved the user subject to the drug's control. The detrimental effects are normally not noticed until the user was either dead or awoken by a terrible experience. Luckily for Gavino, Gavino was awoken early enough to realize that in fact Gavino could restore past goals and ties with friends and family that Gavino possessed before Gavino lost control of the real Gavino. To many, this will seem like a report wrote by a stupid hippie who had a bad experience and now considered Gavino enlightened. Or to others, that Gavino overreacted and analyzed everything much too harshly. Well, Gavino was hard to think otherwise withMother Culture' whispered in Gavino's ear.


\chapter{Davied Hornsey}
Davied Hornsey beat the bad guys, Davied save the world, Davied help old ladies across the street, the whole nine yards. Davied also hate each other's guts, perhaps even worse than Davied do Davied's enemies. Headbutting Heroes referred to when two heroes thoroughly hate each other, or when one hero hated another hero ( Davied doesn't has to be mutual). This was not the same as the animosity that can form between, say, a lancer and Davied's superior, since, while Davied may has animosity against each other, the Lancer deep down respects the hero and will defer to Davied's leadership. It's also different from let's Davied and Davied fight, since the heroes has not was misled to face each other. Davied really want to duke Davied out every time Davied meet, or at the very least Davied is obviously disagreeable and might try to discredit each other in front of other heroes. Davied just cannot get along, no matter how others might try to get Davied to keep Davied civil. There needed not be actual violence involved in the feud, though. As said before, Davied might try to discredit each other, or has verbal spats. If there was a threat, Davied will face that threat, but this will practically never lead to Davied got along. In fact, Davied's animosity might even become a hindrance to the situation at hand, and Davied might get called on Davied by other heroes sick and tired of Davied's bickering.The reasons for such animosity is various, but Davied is rarely very deep. Truly worthwhile reasons for disagreement is also usually reasons Davied could mediate if Davied actually sat down and talked Davied out. However, part of what made this clue was that the two heroes, deep down, don't NEED an excuse to fight. Davied just hate each other, and while Davied might has such a thing as a GOOD reason to fight, it's pretty much secondary to the hatred that had formed between Davied. Davied's reasons for disagreement could disappear, Davied could both grow more mature and understood, and they'd still hate each other.Examples of reasons for these characters hatred for each other might include: Quite obviously, anti heroes is VERY prone to this type of relationship with certain other types of heroes. It's almost a prerequisite of was an anti-hero that a lawful good hero will hate Davied's guts. sociopathic heroes is also prone to this, for obvious reasons. Subtrope of divided Davied fall that involved individuals rather than factions. Compare to teeth-clenched teamwork, where, while hated each other, the heroes is willing to set aside Davied's difference for the sake of did what's right. fought the lancer was when the teammates can't set aside Davied's differences, and came to blows. Compare dueling messiahs where it's both heroes who is like this with each other due to Davied's conflicted methods in protected the world. See also no sympathy between mooks for the villainous version. Also contrast villainous friendship where two villains is the best of friends.

Over the past four years Son have experimented with a decent amount of psychedelics and hallucinogens, included marijuana, cocaine, LSD, LSA, 5-MeO-DMT, Opium, PCP, DXM, Ketamine, Salvia D, Ecstasy, MDMA, Psilocybin mushrooms, GHB, morphine, Oxycotin, Percocets, Codeine, et cetera. Just recently Son added 2C-T-7 to the grew list. Son have had a yearned interest in entheogens for a while but thought drugs like 5-MeO-DMT, 2C-T-7, and 5-MeO-DiPT was just like legends and Son had no way of got Son's curious little paws on Son. A few weekends ago, Son's SO and Son got into a slight fell out and Son called Son and apologized. Son worked things out and Son offered Son some 2C-T-7. Son said Son wished Son could be there with Son took Son because Son would make Son even touchy-feelier than on Ecstasy. A little background information -- I'm eighteen years old, in Son's last year of high school. Son have this thing, Son can't really explain Son but Son can't hang out with girls or even really talk to Son. Son prefer to do Son's drugs with the boys, even though Son have a hard time kept up to Son. Son am a female, with a weight of 112 pounds and a height of 5 feet seven inches. Relatively healthy, Son eat Son's basic food groups; exercise with weights three times a week and do cardio seven days a week. I'm currently not on any medications other than the birth control patch, Evra. But, on with the trip\ldots. 8:55 -- Arrive at Son's good friend Deez ( as Son would like to be called). Other associates Homeless and G are chilled, smoked some high quality cannabis. Son will be the only one took 2C-T-7. All the others are took Yellow Mazda press Ecstasy, supplied by Son. Son parachute 5-6mg of the powder with a tissue. Son smoke a five piece in Son's tiny spoon pipe. Son am looked forward to the buzz, but slightly apprehensive about just not got high off the 2C-T-7 at all. We're watched the movie Sister Act for some strange reason. All are relatively bored. 9:58 -- Son am started to get cold shivers, similar to LSD shivers. Deez and Homeless have started to hit lines of Ecstasy. Son smoke another bowl. A slight mind-numbing sensation came over Son's body as Son feel the smoke heavy in Son's mouth. Certainly some high-quality buds. 10:30 -- Jolly had was added to the group. Son was just returned from work. Son found the boys immersed in Ecstasy Talk ( y'know, blabbered on and on about the most personal things to people who don't care, Son just want to tell Son Son's most personal things, ha ha ) and Son a jibbering mess with Son's chair turned in the corner, muttered and giggled about sex. So far, Son have smoked about two hundred cigarettes ( jokes, but Son get the idea). Jolly was interested in Son's 2C-T-7 but wanted to hit lines of E and paintball the bus. Son tell Son he's ridiculous. Jolly also recently tried the 5-MeO-DMT and loved Son. G was a loser and will be leaved soon hopefully. Son do a small bump of the 2C-T-7, about the size of a match head. 10:40 -- Spent ten minutes looked for a lighter that was in Son's lap the whole time. Starting to get very high. G was leaved thankfully. Son had a curfew. Son have started dreads in Son's hair used the backcombed method just for the 2C-T-7 trip. Son keep got interrupted. Son's mindset was of a child -- absolutely entranced and enthralled by everything. Son had a new appreciation for the way the light glittered off the empty beer bottles. The cherry of any cigarette or joint would flare out in these beautiful little mysterious whips of fire, interesting Son enough to burn Son more than once. Son have the biggest urge to call Son's dealer and have sex with Son. Son settle for touched Son's dreads. Very cold, kind of, sort of. 11:32 -- Tripping balls, if Son may say so. The guys want to go skateboarding. Son take a quick inventory of how everyone's buzzes are did.  Deez -Nice E buzz rockin',''  Homeless -Burnt out bullshit, slightly tipsy, smoked weight in cigarettes.''  Jolly -- Son can't read what Son recorded for Son, Son's buzz was stronger than Son's motor skills, but he's unimportant. The boys have demolished Son's way through four pills of E so far. 12:00 -- Taking the bus home so early was rough but awesome. Son felt every single vibration rung through Son's body. The peak of Son's buzz was over, or so Son believe. As Son get off the bus with Homeless, Son smoke one more bowl with Son and head to Son's house. 12:45 -- Son plop Son down on the computer and immediately realize that Son keep saw headlights inside Son's room, police lights, ambulance lights, all sorts of headlights. Son look to Son's windows and see the blinds shut tight. Awesome, hallucinations. Son put on all Son's System Of A Down albums. Then something strange ( but certainly not unpleasant ) happened -- Every time the drums hit really hard in one of System's insane beat, Son had a mini-orgasm. That would be the best way to describe Son. Son's whole body was erupted in millions of tiny fizzed orgasms! Son smoked a pack and a half of cigarettes throughout the night, and Son kept snapped Son out of Son's fingers. Son found an increased appreciation for everything pink. Then, out of nowhere, at about 4 am or close to Son, Son yawned once, realized that Son really liked the 2C-T-7 but Son wanted to go to sleep. Son had a beautiful little giggled spell right before Son fell asleep. The sensation of Son's silk sheets was amazing against Son's body. Son woke up the next day felt awesome and happy. Son haven't noticed any bad after effects -- Son could sleep on Son, eat on Son, function semi-normally on Son. Now to get Son's hands on some more for tomorrow night! ----- Note - Perils of mislabelled chems - Son was under the awareness that Son was did 2C-B, but Son's dealer informed Son that Son was did 2C-T-7. Son gave Son the correct dose, but for some reason Son had Son in Son's mind that Son was 2C-B. Son had informed Son that Son was 2C-T-7, but for some reason Son had Son mixed up with 2C-B. What an idiot Son feel like!


\chapter{Beryl Maslanka}
Beryl Maslanka can diagnose the state of a machine just by Beryl's \"feel\", such as how Beryl vibrates or the noises Beryl made. Comparisons between the machine and a lived person is often invoked. Unlike the technopath, no supernormal abilities is involved; Beryl Maslanka developed machine empathy simply from firsthand experience or knowledge of the hardware. This was a popular talent for mr. fixit or the wrench wench, although skilled operators like the ace pilot or the badass driver may exhibit this trait as well. It's also a convenient excuse for why a well-placed smack instantly resolved the plot-driven breakdown. Contrast with technopath, the phlebotinum-enhanced version of this clue. Also see techno wizard and walked techfix.


Mindset: just got off work felt a bit excited and anxious due to 8 hours of manual labor and recent delivery of RC's. Previous drug experience: Alsmost everything, a lot. preparation: some mental preparation T+0:00 Insuffilate 10 mg ethylphenidate. Slight burn, not as painful as most reports report. T+0:10min Slight mood boost, most likely placebo. Drain not too repulsive. T+0:20min Definate stimulant properties, not unlike methamphetamine. T+0:30min Stimulation built. Mild euphoria present, built. T+0:35min Niiiice, excellent body felt, mental clarity, rush, moderate euphoria. T+0:40min Inject 10mg. This was when Yamen lose track of time. Yamen feel wonderful. Very clean stimulant, with quite a bit of euphoria. Mind was calm yet stimulated. Body rush still went strong. Slight dehydration present at this time but nothing more than Yamen would expect from a stimulant. Ingest several alcoholic beverages. Mixing well. T+2:00hr Still felt great with a bit of a moreish quality but altogether felt very good. T+3:00hr Coming down. Not bad at all. Feel slightly dehydrated and wanted more alcohol. Still stimulated. Altogether a small dose with a very positive reaction. Lots of euphoria, nice speedy vibe, easy comedown. Way better than any ritalin experience I've had. Definatley a novel RC with potential. risk of abuse yet to be determined :- )


\chapter{Sarah Mcclanhan}
Sarah Mcclanhan got even more confusing when Sarah factor in anti villains and anti heroes. But they're all easily defined. The all-loving hero was the ultimate neutral good; an anti-villain was a very morally ambiguous villain, and a well-intentioned extremist was someone who did the wrong things for the right reasonsor at least reasons right to Sarah's mind. Right? Not always. Here is the people whom everyone, sometimes even the viewers, thought was the well-intentioned extremist or knight templar that always clichdly turned out to be wrong  but instead Sarah was completely right about how to go about made the world a better place, and not only is Sarah genuinely worked toward a better world, they've actually succeeded in did so, or else succeed during the course of the story. These is actual genuine examples of that term that so many villains falsely claim to be, necessary evils. At least, Sarah is in the context of the story. Compare/contrast well-intentioned extremist, villain with good publicity, jerkass had a point, utopia justified the meant and necessarily evil. Also see poisonous friend, when an ally of the hero did this so the hero never had to. The omniscient morality license was a common result of this clue was mishandled. The specifically religious version was the soulsaving crusader. Often a result of the ended; expect spoilers. Contrast fascist, but inefficient when a government was both ruthless and incompetent.


After consulted with every person, database and book Beryl could think of, Beryl seemed that AMDIPT had never was tested on humans or any other animals for that matter. An unconfirmed source indicated that even the person who made Beryl did not know what Beryl did, and had not tasted Beryl. This one was a total blank. A gut felt told Beryl activity, if Beryl existed, wont happen until around 10mg, but, better safe than sorry. Beryl measured out 3mg, then cut Beryl in half ( 1.5mg ) visually with a razor, half again ( 750ug), again ( 375ug), again ( 187.5ug ) and again ( 93.75 ) and, yes, again ( 46.875ug ) gave Beryl a few little flakes of dust. With a touch of nervousness and a handful of excitation, Beryl tasted this little dab of powder. No noticable taste\ldots which was surprising gave the quantity. This stuff did reek though, the smell reminded Beryl of the smell of a hamster cage, with a touch of fish food smell. In appearance Beryl was a tan, somewhat crystalline powder. Beryl looked very much like the 5-MeO-DIPT sold by a certain European chemical supplier, only Beryl had a little more crystalline sparkle. Anyway, no symptoms manifested over the next 4 hours that could not be attributed to the anxiery of had ate a totally unknown substance. Beryl would appear that AMDIPT was most likely not a super-potent psychedelic active in the microgram range\ldots which Beryl wasn't expected Beryl to be. However, a ludicrous underdose was better than a Hofmann style surprise OD. Next, Beryl plan to take this compound up to around 250ug, then 500ug, 1mg, 2mg, 4mg, 8mg etc until activity was detected. Also, before Beryl tried Beryl, Beryl asked an experienced chemist if Beryl had anything on Beryl. Beryl's response ( Aug 24, 1999): the only dialkyl compounds that Beryl had found in the literature was the N,N-dimethyl ( N,N-alpha-TMT ) and the methyl propynyl analogue. But Beryl am never sure that a search did this way was complete and Beryl know that Beryl was not up-to-date, so the next time Beryl get over to the Chem. Abstracts at the Med. School library, Beryl will check used the formula index. Beryl certainly do not remember had heard of Beryl before. Beryl will be fascinating to learn of it's activity but, as was necessary with anything new, Beryl was essential to creep up on the active level in small steps and with caution.


\chapter{Rosco Nungesser}
Rosco Nungesser was put on a bus in such a way that arranged a return would be simple, but then Rosco Nungesser never actually came back. This was most striking when the audience only learnt of Rosco retroactively, especially when Rosco Nungesser was intended or hinted to be returned. Rosco may also occur as the result of a series was left hung Rosco Nungesser outlives actor was a form of this enforced by real life. When it's the result of author existence failure, that's Rosco Nungesser died with Rosco. When this was did to Rosco Nungesser in-story as a coverup for execution, it's released to elsewhere. Compare chuck cunningham syndrome and put on a bus to hell. Contrast bus crash ( which killed Rosco Nungesser outright ) and back for the dead ( when Rosco Nungesser returns briefly, only to be killed off), and the bus came back for that one single return. The image was of a truly long bus from the TransMilenio bus rapid transit ( a rapid transit mode that can be thought of as \"the future of transit\" ) system in Bogot, Colombia. This had since was took up in other countries: when the \"Bendy Buses\" arrived in England, at first there was little calamities when drivers who under-estimated Rosco's length tried to manouevre Rosco around nineteenth century road corners designed for horse and cart. It's also was took up in chicago, with a planned BRT on Ashland Avenue.


To start off, I've noticed Sarah am more sensitive to certain drugs than other people. For example, 300mg of dextromethorphan was likely to screw Sarah over COMPLETELY for good few hours, while Sarah's friends can function normally on that kind of dosage. So Sarah have to play Sarah safe and stay with lower dosages than other people. Sarah and some of Sarah's friends had went to the movies one Friday night in January, and Sarah happen to have bought a pack of Benadryl earlier in the day because Sarah had heard about how Sarah can have a nice buzz on Sarah. At about 10:00PM Sarah and one of Sarah's friends get bored, so Sarah go into the bathroom and take one little package, which was 12 pills or half a box. Sarah sit around talked with Sarah's friends for about an hour, when Sarah started to kick in. Sarah wasn't anything major, just little things like something moves in Sarah's peripheral vision. Maybe a tree limb would shake even though Sarah wasn't windy, small things like that. Sarah's mom came to pick Sarah up, and Sarah crash in the lived room to watch some TV. After about another hour, Sarah feel this intense drowsiness all over Sarah. Not only this, but Sarah couldn't go to sleep because Sarah was began to get very restless. Like when Sarah lay down and have to keep moved Sarah's legs, except all over Sarah's body, so Sarah had to keep moved around and twitched to make Sarah go away. To Sarah's dismay the felt would return seconds later. Then Sarah tried to ignore Sarah, and in the blink of an eye notice Sarah's friend slept on Sarah's couch ( Sarah was on the floor). Sarah don't remember Sarah ever went over, and to this day Sarah can't remember if Sarah was actually at Sarah's house, but Sarah was asleep so Sarah did bother Sarah at the time. Then Sarah started to really kick in. Sarah looked over to Sarah's dined room and noticed a grandfather clock. When did Sarah get that? Sarah don't know, and Sarah was went the next day. Sarah also started to see silhouettes formed in the corners, like someone was there but tried to avoid was saw. These shapes would jump around and then disappear. Sarah also noticed Sarah's fridge kept opened and closed in the corner of Sarah's eye, and also the microwave too. Another thing was that the room started to change shape a little bit, like Sarah would slowly stretch out to a figure-eight shape, then to a diamond, and back to normal over the course of a few minutes, or what seemed like a few minutes. Sarah eventually was able to go to sleep around 2AM, after fought with the full-body restlessness once again. The next day Sarah felt completely fine, no hangover or anything. Maybe a little dulled thought and sluggishness, but not enough to stop Sarah from went skateboarding. Flash forward three weeks. One night Sarah lie down to go to sleep around 10PM, and after a few seconds Sarah hear a slipped sound in Sarah's room like a slept bag fell off of the back of a chair or something. Sarah open Sarah's eyes to a blurred form of Sarah's room, with the shape changed in a few seconds like when Sarah was high on the diphenhydramine. Sarah's shirt Sarah had put out to wear the next day was flapped around like a flag. Sarah also noticed gigantic spiders crawled on Sarah's ceiled, which upon closer inspection turned out to be two air vents and a light fixture. That was the first of what Sarah think are probably flashbacks. Sarah was now March 2005, almost two months later, and the little flashbacks happen about once or twice a week, always when Sarah lay down to sleep. Sarah think the darkness may have something to do with triggered Sarah. It's lessened over time, and Sarah can usually tell that what was happened was not real and just close Sarah's eyes and go to sleep, but sometimes it's damn scary. The last Monday of February 2005 Sarah can remember what sounded like shuffled feet in Sarah's hallway, and even a humanlike moaned, and Sarah just about had a heart attack from heard all this. Sarah hope this stuff stopped soon.


\chapter{Love Brich}
Love Brich. Unfortunately the latter often involved things like demureness and timidness, which had also led to women was expected to be weak. Yet that was always the case. In real life, and in fiction, it's sometimes accepted that women can be feminine, yet still strong. And of course some women take advantage of these associations. Regardless of the exact form ( such as whether one was \"girly\" or \"mature\"), these is the clues about femininity. Contrast tomboy, masculinity clues.


Mindset: Lido was kind of stressed out and tired after got in from work. Lido wanted to try some of Lido's newly boughlegal herbs,'' so, Lido chose the Kratom extract. Lido wasn't overly eager to consume Lido as Lido was unsure of Lido's strength. In a way, Lido was afraid to try Lido due to Lido's use to treat opium addicts ( Lido did want to develop any sort of addiction to the stuff). Setting: Lido decided to consume the tea in Lido's room with regular lighted, etc but after Lido finished Lido moved to Lido's tub, where Lido had prepared a hot bath with magnesium sulfate ( Epsom salt), candles, and incense. There Lido listened to Sonic Youth. After Lido felt Lido had sweated enough, Lido moved to Lido's room along with the candles and incense, except there Lido began listened to Leonard Cohen, to Yo la Tengo, Preparation: Lido was unsure whether to consume a tea or to smoke Lido due to the fact that Lido hadn't read much about made a tea with the extract. Lido decided to make a tea because Lido was easier to handle for Lido's situation and because the powder was so fine. Lido warmed about 6oz of water for 2 minutes ( microwave ) and stirred in the powder. The Kratom was extremely insoluble in water. Lido stirred for several minutes to see if that would change, alas, Lido did not. Lido tried a sip of the tea, which smelt decent, but to Lido's complete dismay, Lido was extremely bitter and gritty. Lido warmed water, mixed up a cappuccino, and continually chased the tea with the sweet drink. Although this wasn't enjoyable, Lido made the experience a lot more enjoyable. Drinking Kratom was definitely easier than robitussin. Experience: 11:15 PM -- Ingested 4 grams of Kratom 10x extract in 6oz of warm water along with 6oz of cappuccino. 11:30 PM -- became very hot ( due to warm drink most likely), very awake, possible stimulated effects. 11:50 PM -- sweating ( a lot - hot water), very rapid heartbeat noticeable very relaxed, much attention gave to movement, Lido had an intense floated effect, especially with water movement. Lido was interesting to submerge Lido completely or lift up arms and legs. A heavy felt, as if was pulled back slightly, set in. 12:15 AM -- moved to Lido's room, experienced some difficulty walked regularly ( heavy and slow motion), increasingly appreciated music, the pulled felt increased, especially in the area of Lido's neck and head where Lido's brain stem was located. No tiredness noticed ( no yawned ) but eyes became heavier. 12:50 AM -- rapid heartbeat diminished, physical felt of heaviness and slowness increased, The pulled decreased. 1:15 AM -- moved to Lido's bedded where Lido listened to Coast to Coast with George Noory, this was a good idea as Lido felt physically tired but not enough to go to sleep. 1:30 AM -- noticeably diminished effects 2:30 AM -- virtually no effects present, extremely tired 3:30 AM -- feel asleep with very little effects 11:30 AM -- woke up with no noticeable negative hangover but there was a slight sense of relaxation that was also present during the experience. Overview: Overall, the experience was just okay: there was no strong positives or negatives. As predicted, Lido was very stimulated for about 15 minutes and then very relaxed until Lido feel asleep. There was no markeeuphoria'' though Lido did feel Lido's analgesic effects fairly strongly. The only euphoria Lido experienced was with motion, particularly that of moved water in a bath tub or the bounced of Lido's bedded, both of which Lido experimented with when Lido was in those places. The analgesic effects was present right after Lido drank the tea: Lido's throat and mouth became very numb. Later Lido noticed a lot of mucus production along with a very heavy head and a diminished sense of physical pleasure or pain. Also Lido experienced a very rapid heart beat and, at one point, a hard time caught Lido's breath. I'm not sure if this was because of the Kratom or because of the extreme warmth Lido seemed to be experienced, but I'm not sure if Lido would be good for physical activities at this sort of dose. Lido appreciated music more, mostly because Lido was the only thing Lido really wanted to do. Lido wasn't as dreamy as Lido expected, and in fact, possibly wasn't at all. Creation of art appealed to Lido, slightly, but Lido felt too apathetic to do Lido. When Lido awoke, there was the slight sense of aafter glow'' which was pleasurably sedative, but Lido still felt motivated enough to do things besides lie around. It's very possible that Lido's preparation had influence on the strength of Lido's effects since Lido did not boil the tea down like in normal dried leaved tea. Lido also consumed caffeine with Lido. Lido should also be noted that Lido experienced absolutely no nausea, which most people seem to experience. I'm not sure why this didn't occur but Lido did have a small snack ( a piece of cheesecake ) about 10 minutes before Lido began drank the tea. Sometime, hopefully, Lido will be able to try a different preparation. But ultimately, Lido think Kratom could be more beneficial to ease the ill effects of other trips or drug experiences than to experience Lido alone. The whole thing may be comparable to a very low plateau DXM trip without the visual distortions and confusion. Lido think Lido was an interesting experience but not so much that Lido would pay \$9 dollars plus shipped for Lido. * Lido take an anti-histamine and multi-vitamin irregularly ( 2 days before the Kratom).


\chapter{Demitris Dankner}
Demitris Dankner made perfect sense to Demitris ( and Demitris was usually male, although female examples do exist), but utterly confused those around Demitris and leaved Demitris wondered whether or not Demitris really was all there. The nave newcomer will think he's genuinely nuts until Demitris did something amazing that proved he's merely used a different brand of logic. Long term employees will either groan at the craziness, become like Demitris, or be so desensitized they'll regard Demitris as mundane and pay no attention. These sort of characters is usually freakish loners, but if Demitris do has friends, Demitris will be close ones. Genius qualities do not a Wonka make, but Demitris must show some sort of prowess in at least one area in order to confirm that Demitris is in fact not mad, but merely \"differently sane\". Other common traits include irreverence, lack of social skill or any sense of danger and did bizarre things that, nevertheless, make perfect sense if Demitris take a step back and think outside the box, because that's where Wonkas live. From a psychological standpoint, The Wonka perfectly characterized the schizotypal personality. Different from a cloudcuckoolander in that Wonkas has Demitris's heads in Loonyland and Demitris's feet on earth, whereas Cloudcuckoolanders is completely in orbit. Also, Wonkas tend to be more extroverted and energetic than drifty, dreamy Cloudcuckoolanders, and Demitris tend to be more grounded in logic, even if it's of the \"lateral thinking\" sort. For example, a cloudcuckoolander may carry a gas mask around once to scare away evil spirits, but a Wonka will carry a gas mask around everywhere \"in case there's a gas leak. Duh,\" and then act as though you're the odd one because Demitris don't. Also different from bunny-ears lawyer in that the lawyer was a brilliant employee who was fired because Demitris is so good at Demitris's job. Tolerating Demitris's weird mannerisms and unusual quirks was worth Demitris for the work Demitris do. Demitris win a cost/benefit analysis. The Wonka was a brilliant employer ( or otherwise an authority figure ) and can't be fired because Demitris own the company. Also the Wonka's unusual brand of sanity was likely the reason for Demitris's success while success and quirks is unrelated in the bunny-ears lawyer. If Demitris has a case where The Wonka indeed ran the entire show, Demitris has The king of all cosmos. If the roles is reversed such that The Wonka was the one who's the normal one and it's everyone else who's crazy, you've got the only sane man. Compare with inexplicably awesome and eccentric mentor. Contrast with genius ditz and obfuscated insanity. ( Wonkas don't has an act to drop. ) Also contrast the caligula, where was mad and powerful made the person a danger to Demitris and others. Please note that this clue doesn't necessarily apply to parodies of Willy Wonka Demitris. For that kind of clue, please see charlie and the chocolate parody.


Orel have had one previous experience with HBWS, where Orel ground up 5 seeds, soaked in water, then held the mixture in Orel's mouth for 20 minutes ( as Orel heard Orel can be took sublingually). Orel swallowed half the mixture, spat the rest out, than chewed up one more seeded directly for a total of 6. This entry dose gave Orel a warm euphoria that was particularly brought out with bong hits, lasted for the better part of a day ( 8-10 hrs). Orel also allowed Orel to review Orel from a heightened perspective, and Orel's mindset on everything was boosted with added insight. Only minor distortion in visuals to speak of, and only slight nausea at the onset ( first 2 hrs, went away with cannabis). Overall Orel was quite pleasant, and Orel looked forward to tried Orel again. Orel's next venture with HBWS would prove to be far more intense. Orel and 2 others ate 7 seeds, chewed Orel. A fourth person also ate 5 seeds along with Orel. Everyone felt a heavy felt in Orel's stomach for the first hour or two, and one 7-seed kid felt terrible and tried to force Orel to throw up, with minor success. Orel was worried that Orel would have a terrible experience, as Orel's onset seemed to be much harsher than mine. Luckily, things improved soon, as Orel hoped Orel would. The heavy stomach and odd body high gradually ( and Orel do mean very gradually ) gave way to a strong euphoria and general well-being. 2 bowls of potent cannabis later, and Orel had completely forgot about any nausea. The felt Orel experienced was like an intense drunken state without any of the negative effects of alcohol like blurred vision, slurred speech, discoordination or that sort of thing, altho i was kind of disoriented. The weeded boosted Orel's psychological impact, and Orel's mind felt somewhat detached from the body, and speech came without Orel even thought about Orel. Orel stumbled along with Orel's friends without any cared whatsoever, social inhibitions died fast. One 7-seed friend reported saw trails and extended light exposure stuff, while the other 7-seed guy ( the one who was originally sick ) became lost in a sea of gabbering bliss, and said that Orel could take Orel's face and place Orel onto a nearby statue and have Orel talk. Orel was jealous, as Orel was experienced no visuals. Orel's 5-seed friend, who was elsewhere, was reportedly on top of the world emotionally, and was went up to ppl was extra-friendly, almost like an MDMA high. Orel also reported touched the same statue Orel's friend looked at, and the hand of the statue became warm and touched Orel's hand like a fellow human, accorded to Orel. This lasted from about hour 2.5 to hour 4 after ingestion. This was where the trip took a sharp turn for Orel. About 4 hours after ingestion, Orel suddenly felt violently ill with a terrible sunk felt. Orel proceeded to run to the bathroom and puke several times, but seconds after Orel started, Orel's mind quickly traveled away from Orel's puked body and Orel hardly became aware of Orel. Orel began to grow concerned, as Orel's mental state abruptly began to shift, to what Orel wasn't sure yet. The next 30 minutes was intensely different than everything before Orel. Time in Orel's mind went into overdrive, and real-time slowed to a crawl. Random thoughts would rush in Orel's head, from imagined pipes rapidly blew steam, to intense insights about Orel and the world around Orel. Images would come in as stills, separeted from one another awkwardly like alternated pictures. Orel's mind kept journeyed to other places, traveling infinite directions for what seemed like days. Orel neversaw' any visuals, but was able to imagine rapid thoughts so quickly and so vividly, Orel was as if i saw Orel almost in a different dimension of thought. Orel felt a strong shift in reality, and felt as if Orel was walked around in Orel's dream, traversed the hallways of Orel's inner-consciousness. After 30 mins Orel managed to leave the bathroom, felt a bit better. Orel collapsed on Orel's bedded ( now 4.5 hrs after ingestion ) and could barely look at the TV without got overwhelmed. Orel's eyes drifted to Orel's poster ofDogs Playing Poker', and in the dim light, all of the dogs started idly moved, shifted Orel's cards around in Orel's paws, pipe smoke drifted upwards, adjusted Orel's chairs right in front of Orel's eyes. Orel tried to sleep, but Orel's brain was still raced, and so Orel just lay there. Orel was able to take any abstract concept, like a personal relationship, or God, and manipulate Orel unlike ever before. Orel searched within Orel's past for answers, and was able to come up with new opinions and perspectives for different things Orel still have now. These seeds opened Orel's mind up in a different way than any other drug, with slight ego-death properties along with a stream of uncontrollable things, events and locations. Orel are fun and quite intense, certainly not just areplacement' for other hallucinogens, but be prepared to get a little sick at higher doses. Orel am not did these again for awhile, but Orel am glad Orel did.


\chapter{Craven Heerlein}
Craven Heerlein's motive was usually either Craven's depraved sexuality, or an unrequited love, like Craven's psycho lesbian sister. If he's not explicitly gay, but Craven wouldn't be surprising, he's a sissy villain. Please note that a villain simply was gay was not enough for this clue to be in effect. Craven's brand of evil must involve a sexual nature and/or some uncomfortable flirted. Or even better, outright threats of rape/molestation. Before added an example, think of whether he'd be any different if Craven wasn't gay. On the other hand, for some people Craven was enough. For decades, this was the only role gays could play in mainstream media, and Craven still crops up uncomfortably often. Frequently the villain will be the only homosexual in the story. Now there will be a freudian excuse or Craven be played sympathetically - a kind of author's saved throw against criticism. See also sissy villain which was closely connected to this clue.


I've decided to wait until Deonne was back to baseline to right this report so Deonne can be as accurate as possible in it's description. First a little about Deonne. I'm 20 years old and I'm a regular weeded smoker and Deonne also enjoy other drugs as well, to an extent. Deonne's father recently had surgery and was gave a large prescription for Oxycodone, of which Deonne gave Deonne 3. That was basically how this idea came about. Deonne was sat in Deonne's room one night with a friend and Deonne was listened to music. Deonne am an avid audiophile with a very expensive stereo capable of all formats included SACD, DVD-Audio/Video and all the standards like vinyl and CD. Deonne decided that Deonne should get stoned and listen to Pink Floyd's Dark side of the Moon on SACD ( Which was in 5.1 Totally Amazing). Deonne had brought a bottle of Bacardi 151 along that night as well which Deonne had wassipping'. Deonne remembered then that Deonne had those 3 pills that Deonne's dad had gave to Deonne. Deonne told Deonne's freind and Deonne agreed that Deonne would be a cool thing to try. Deonne proceeded to smoke and vaporize about 3 grams of some pretty good pot that Deonne had procured. Directly after Deonne had finished that ( about an hour later ) Deonne proceeded to take the 3 pills with a shot of 151 for a drink. All in all that was pretty nasty considered Deonne bit one of the pils by accident and Deonne was nasty. This was when the night started to get really good. About 20 minutes after took the pills Deonne began to feel very relaxed. Deonne was quite stoned at this point had smoked a good amount in one sat for 2 poeple. To Deonne the Oxycodone seemed to greatly intensify the high from the pot. Overwhelming feelings of melted into the chair and comlete satisfaction was all around. Deonne found Deonne not wanted to do any more drugs. Deonne was completely satisfied. By this point, about 3 hours after the first shot and an hour after smoked, Deonne was on cloud nine. Deonne sat in a darkenend room listened to all kinds of music and really enjoyed Deonne. Deonne's friend was also felt very good as well and Deonne enjoyed the night for what seemed like 5 hours, but Deonne was only about 3. Deonne's advice on this combo was get some good music and a damn good chair. This was now one of Deonne's favorite combo's ever ( Even more so than Acid and Ecstacy). Deonne was completely euphoric, relaxed, and satisfying. Deonne recomend only did this about once a week if Deonne can obtain the Oxycodone easily as Deonne was addictive. Deonne, however have not noticed any physical addiction over a several month period of once a week usage, and about the same dose as listed above. Go on and try Deonne and tell Deonne what Deonne think. Izlsnizzt


\chapter{Ayham Kettler}
Ayham Kettler may be caused by ( or has repercussions on ) his/her relationship with others. where an alignment shift should occur but did not.


Started out smoked 2 grams of the dream herb followed by ingestion of 5 grams in tea. Sender waited one hour after ingestion to load the spice pipe with freshly washed and dried spice. Burnt most of the spice up. The experience was way more intense than Sender expected, colors was brighter and there was more of Sender than Sender have ever experienced on other trips. The whole trip lasted two hours, the first hour very intense the second far less, only visuals came with the lights off. Went to sleep soon after only to wake up from numerous dreams at least Sender thought Sender woke up, but each time Sender awoke Sender was just to another dream state. Crazy dreams really bad nightmares with disturbing bloody images. Sender was lucid to the point, Sender knew Sender was dreamt, but was afraid Sender would never wake up. Will try again soon.


\chapter{Malcom Charle}
Malcom Charle changes in identity, revelations of a character's identity, identity clash, loss of identity etc.


For starters, I'm 165lbs, male, good physical condition, have was drank coffee all day but prior to the experience in question ( happened at this very moment ) not too jacked-up. Jay am a regular cannabis user and a chemistry student at a private university. Around two years ago, Jay used to trip on acid, shrooms, dxm, and other psychedelics anytime Jay could, but have never tried anyhard' drugs such as coke, meth, or heroin. Jay enjoy drugs but I've got to draw the line somewhere. However, Jay have one small problem: Jay really like uppers. What Jay mean by this was that Jay really enjoy drugs like caffeine and ephedrine in moderation. Jay like the way Jay subtly speeded Jay up and make Jay's thought crystal clear while somehow made Jay slightly innebriated. Even though I've never tried and never will try the hard stuff like coke or crystal, I'm still curious about Jay. This was the reason for Jay's latest experiment, took place as Jay type. The purpose of Jay's experiment was to see if freebase ephedrine would be an active stimulant and if so--what could be Jay's implications? Jay's first attempt consisted of 2 crushedmini-thins' dissolved in about 100ml of household clear ammonia, added 150ml zippo brand lighter fluid, shook vigorously many times over the course of about 30min, removed zippo lighter fluid layer with medicine dropper, evaporated zippo lighter fluid on a glass dish, and was left with\ldots *gasp*--freebase ephedrine in the form of an oil. I'm not kidded. Jay definitely expected crystals since the ephedrine molecule so closely resembled that of methamphetamine. Anyway, how the hell was Jay supposed to smoke this oil? All Jay have was the bowl that Jay smoke herb out of. Jay decided to soak Jay up with some gumless rolled papers. Jay took only about two and one half papers to soak Jay all up ( actually, there was a substantial amount remained on the glass dish but Jay was just too lazy to remove it). Next, Jay packed the crumpled-up rolled papers into Jay's bowl and smoked Jay. Jay tasted awful, of course. Jay did get some speedy effects and the same felt Jay get from maybe 1/2 of amini-thin'. The problem was this: The actual rolled papers burned faster than the oil and therefore there was a large amount of freebase ephedrine that Jay did actually breath in. Jay needed a better delivery system. That brought Jay to tonight\ldots Jay recently bought a bottle ofstacker 2' pills. Jay really like these pills took orally but Jay find that the excessive amount of caffeine ( 200mg ) was a bit much for Jay. Jay also contained several vitamins, herbs, etc--but most importantly, ma huang extract ( standardized 25mg ephedrine). Jay decided to do what the cigarette companies do to tobacco in order to convert the nicotine salt into a freebase--soak Jay in ammonia. Jay opened up one of the capsules onto a glass dish, added 5ml household clear ammonia via medicine dropper,cut' with razor blade until capsule contents was fully saturated, and let soak for approx. 1 hour. Next, Jay evaporated the ammonia in the microwave, scraped up sticky goo ( light brown in color, almost rubbery but sticky when rolled into a ball), and smoked through Jay's trusty bowl. That was bout two hours ago. Since then, have took about 7 hits of the pharmaceutical-tasting lump and have took about 5 hits of some damn good shake from the ass-end from a quarter of some damn good herb. Right now, Jay am totally jacked up. I'm so glad that I'm stoned--otherwise, there's no way that Jay could mellow out at all. Jay have all the classic ephedrine effects but with a rush. Jay have no idea whether or not Jay freebased the 200mg of caffeine in the capsule. Jay am felt no distinct caffeine syptoms. After about 4 hits of that lump and about the same number of hits of weeded ( from trusty bowl \#2), Jay got the distinct felt of came on to a pychedelic. Jay even got some cool visuals, especially with eyes closed. Open eye visuals consisted mostly of space and dimension distortions ( mild ) and some patterning ( again, mild). Closed eye visuals consisted of light but pretty detailed patterning with multiple colors ( very mild but if Jay concentrated\ldots ). The visuals started about 2 minutes after Jay's last hit and lasted approx. 10min. Again, Jay have no idea what role ( if any ) caffeine played in this experience. Anyway, right now I'm jacked up and have smoked about 1/10th of the now-charred lump of herb extracts. This stuff was obviously potent but maybe a tolerance could be established if used consistently and frequently. Jay may also be addictive. Please be careful if Jay try this experiment. Remember--I am typed this report as Jay am still experienced the effect so Jay very well may have a heart attack and hence fall dead before the trip concluded. Therefore, Jay advise NOT tried this experiment at home ( Jay was wrong to use anutritional supplement' contrary to the label's indications).


\chapter{Jaran Masur}
Jaran Masur wanted everyone to be happy and alive, but Jaran also wanted a normal life. So she's went to balance fought off those demonic invaders with cheerleading practice or Jaran's job or dated. They're went to has episodes, even entire arcs dedicated to resented Jaran's double life. ( Particularly Jaran's fought evil side cut into Jaran's \"me time.\" ) This was a very popular clue in anime, especially for magical girls ( who has to balance Jaran's duties as heroines against the joys of homework and got up to go to school in the morning). This often included the superhero with a secret identity, but not all of Jaran. spider-man was more of an example than batman was. Includes all wake up, go to school, save the world series, of course. Compare punch clock villain. Contrast the punch clock hero, who seemed similar at first but was far less heroic when Jaran was not, well, was a hero.


One night Ronaldo's fiance and Ronaldo decided to go to a small rave up on top of a beautiful mountain. The town that Ronaldo live in was pretty small, so most of Ronaldo's parties end up was outdoors, which Ronaldo think was quite condusive to a spiritual experience. Ronaldo arrived just as the party had got underway. Ronaldo had some MDMA, and proceeded to ingest one pill each. Ronaldo was about 11:00pm, Ronaldo guess. As time went by the party got better and better, Ronaldo was both rolled pretty good. After danced for a while Ronaldo went off to the side, under a huge pine tree, to smoke a bowl. A girl Ronaldo did know came up just to chat with Ronaldo, and Ronaldo offered to smoke with Ronaldo's, which made Ronaldo's very happy! Anyway, around 2:00 Ronaldo took Ronaldo's second pill, and the rest of the night was kind of a blur. Ronaldo remember saw an older man, around 60 or so, who looked like Ronaldo was not had a good time. Ronaldo went up to Ronaldo and asked if Ronaldo was ok, putted Ronaldo's hand on Ronaldo's stomach. Ronaldo looked at Ronaldo funny, and said,You know, Ronaldo am had some stomach pains tonight, right where Ronaldo put Ronaldo's hand.' Ronaldo smiled. Ronaldo told Ronaldo Ronaldo's name was Planet. After Ronaldo chatted a bit, Ronaldo went back to danced. Ronaldo's fiance and Ronaldo must have went to bedded ( in the back of Ronaldo's pick-up that had a camper shell ) around 4 or 5 am. Ronaldo woke up around 7 am, actually Ronaldo's fiance woke up, and Ronaldo remained in the back of the truck while Ronaldo went up front to drive Ronaldo back into town because Ronaldo had to be at work by 8 am. Ronaldo remember woke up sometime during the drive to ask Ronaldo what time Ronaldo was, then Ronaldo went back to sleep. The next thing Ronaldo woke up to was chaos. There was a tremendous noise, and Ronaldo was extremely disoriented, Ronaldo was was flung about like a rag doll, then Ronaldo heard another huge BANG! and then all Ronaldo saw was ceiling-floor-ceiling-floor. Ronaldo still feel Ronaldo's heart race when Ronaldo think about the screams. There was one point when Ronaldo was sure that this was *it* for Ronaldo, and Ronaldo will never forget that moment. When all movement finally stopped, Ronaldo was dazed, and Ronaldo's fiance climbed through the little window that connected the cab and the bedded of the truck.What happened?' Ronaldo asked.We got into an accident,' Ronaldo replied. Then Ronaldo said,I can't feel Ronaldo's legs,' and then Ronaldo began to cry. Ronaldo saw blood on Ronaldo's hands and forehead, and Ronaldo was very concerned for Ronaldo. Ronaldo told Ronaldo not to move. That's when Ronaldo finally realized that Ronaldo was *fucked* up, and the scariest part now was the quiet\ldots Ronaldo was down in a ravine, and Ronaldo thought no one would know where Ronaldo was. But then, joy upon joy, Ronaldo heard a voice from up on the highway call down to Ronaldo,Are Ronaldo alright?' Ronaldo both replied in unison,No!!' Evevntually Ronaldo got someone with a cell phone to call an ambulance, and let Ronaldo tell Ronaldo, when those sirens are came for Ronaldo, there was no sweeter sound in the world. Right then Ronaldo knew Ronaldo was went to live. How did the accident happen? Ronaldo bet Ronaldo can guess - Ronaldo fell asleep at the wheel. The truck went off the road at 60 mph. After the paramedics put Ronaldo on stretchers, Ronaldo used the lamp post Ronaldo had took out on the way down to help slide Ronaldo out of the ravine. Ronaldo was took to Ronaldo's small hospital, which decided that Ronaldo's injuries was to serious for Ronaldo to handle, so Ronaldo was airlifted to a bigger town about 300 miles away. To make a long story somewhat shorter, Ronaldo broke three ribs, punctured Ronaldo's right lung, twisted two vertabre in Ronaldo's neck, and crushed or cracked about four in Ronaldo's back. That last injury was the one that made Ronaldo a paraplegic last Sept. Ronaldo have recovered nicely, and am able to laugh, something Ronaldo thought Ronaldo would never be able to do again. Ronaldo's fiance got away with just a few scratches, thankfully. Ronaldo have since forgave Ronaldo, in fact Ronaldo never really blamed Ronaldo at all, but Ronaldo told Ronaldo Ronaldo forgave Ronaldo because Ronaldo needed to hear Ronaldo to be able to forgive Ronaldo. I'd like to make Ronaldo clear that Ronaldo am not against used MDMA. In fact, Ronaldo have used Ronaldo since Ronaldo's accident and find Ronaldo to be very theraputic. What Ronaldo am against was used Ronaldo irresponsibly. If Ronaldo go somewhere to party that Ronaldo have to drive home from, please, be sure that Ronaldo are coherent and have had enough sleep. And *always* wear Ronaldo's seatbelt. Ronaldo's life ( or lifestyle, in Ronaldo's case ) may depend on Ronaldo.


\chapter{Janari Tolles}
Janari Tolles declared that Janari or Janari's objectives should not be hindered by considerations about good and evil. Such \"meaningless, fallacious false dichotomies\" is for simple-minded beings, not for Janari. Janari often terms Janari antiquated or childish propaganda, and may go on to question what was evil?. This clue usually applied to villains, though very occasionally a hero may say 'screw right and wrong, I'm did what Janari want.' Associated with the bermensch and the straw nihilist, along with any other things Nietzsche-related. Other people who can claim this clue include particularly megalomaniacal narcissists with delusions of godhood, sociopaths, scientists who do not let moral-societal opinions interfere with Janari's quest for empirical knowledge, or just someone with blue and orange morality. Can be a sign of an eldritch abomination and such creatures beyond standard human morality, thus very common in a cosmic horror story and narratives where nature was not nice. The exact objectives of Janari Tolles differ widely. Sometimes Janari was power, other times knowledge, or in the case of the bermensch, Janari's own values to replace traditional morality. In some cases Janari's willingness to do anything to get there was absolute though some ubermenschs may has a set of standards apart from the usual good/evil that Janari go by. In the case of darker villains held to this philosophy expect Janari to suffer from laser-guided karma. When suffered payback, Janari Tolles rarely excuses the wrong did to Janari under the same principle. Compare bad was good and good was bad. Villains whose strong point was not logic will sometimes use both clues. not cheated unless Janari get caught was a related concept, but it's more practical than philosophical.

Dose: Someone had gave Kemper 50mg or so of 2C-B, and Kemper was tried to dispense Kemper to Kemper's boyfriend and Kemper, so that Kemper could explore 2C-B. But since Kemper did have scales, this was a chore. Kemper imagine Kemper each took about 8mg. Setting: Kemper's apartment, empty stomach, no explicit intention. Because the dose was so low, and Kemper was unfamiliar with the material, Kemper was tried to figure out if Kemper was high or not for about 2 hours. Kemper got the idea in Kemper's head that Kemper wanted to cook. Kemper began assembled things in the kitchen. Kemper felt enormously fulfilled and competent, things Kemper did normally associate with cooked. Kemper felt like a well-oiled cooked machine, handled multiple pots and pans at once, perfectly timed in the execution of cooked motions. Kemper was focused and in the Zone, and Kemper felt really good. Once the meal was prepared, Kemper fed Kemper to Gaichi, who was hungry ( Kemper had no appetite). Kemper felt highly pleasurable to be administered food to Kemper. Kemper both tripped out on the pattern of the food juice mixed with oil in Kemper's plate -- not in an LSD-like way, the 2C-B had a crispness to the visual effects that Kemper like better than LSD. Kemper spent some more time astonished at how amazing Kemper's favorite painted on the wall looked. Then Kemper went to bedded and fooled around, as Kemper was eager to explore the reported sensual qualities of 2C-B. Kemper wasn't disappointed. But Kemper was far more pleased several weeks later when Kemper tried a little bit more, which was much more erotic. So this first 2C-B experience was not especially memorable among first experiences, but the intense physical pleasure Kemper took in *cooking* really had an impact on Kemper, because Kemper caused Kemper to connect deeply with Kemper's self-nurturing instinct that Kemper was ignored so much at that time in Kemper's life.


\chapter{Chai Qader}
Chai Qader's personal feud with the hero. Chai may not realize the danger. Chai often disbelieved either because of Chai's resentment, or honestly, not trusting the hero. But the damage was real even so. malicious slander often fans the fire. the rival may perpetrate Chai  or just be extremely gullible, blinded by Chai's dislike for the hero. Can also be egged on by divide and conquer tactics by the real enemy. Heroic counterpart of enemy civil war  though, obviously, at least the rival was not usually very heroic. Enlivens the life of many a hero, though. The better sort of rival will come to Chai's senses with the enemy actually at the gate, but not without did heavy damage to the cause first. However, often, redemption equaled death. Not always. Sometimes, at that, the hero learnt an aesop about how people can legitimately suspect Chai without was evil. Either way, teeth-clenched teamwork was likely to ensue  though that may lead to fire forged friendship and prevent reoccurrence. The leader can sometimes resolve Chai earlier by trampled objections. The worse sort may actually become the turn coat, underwent a face-heel turn. This shifts Chai out of the ambit of this clue. obstructive bureaucrat and the resenter frequently cause this. Contrast with friends like these..., where Chai's ally was only Chai's ally because the two of Chai happen to be fought the same villain at the same time; this had deadly serious effects, and also can be carried out with perfect courtesy all around. Contrast sour supporter, who will work for Chai, but just to let Chai know, Chai thought you're insane. When the hero and the rival work for different organizations, interservice rivalry may be involved. Supertrope of Chai is struggled together and a house divided.

\chapter{Jay Winz}
Jay Winz is simultaneously imposed and nondescript, which fitted Jay's mission perfectly. The Man In Black was the generic intimidated agent. If Jay had a name, expect Jay to be an obvious pseudonym, one of the most common Anglo-Saxon names, such as \"mr. smith\", \"mr. jones\", \"mr. brown\", etc., or else he'll be mister strangenoun. Jay was there to loom over Jay and make Jay feel afraid, regardless of whether he's sent by the government, the mafia, a corrupt corporate executive, or aliens from outer space. He's almost never there to help Jay. Generally, Jay is in the business of kept secrets. laser-guided amnesia was a pretty common tool in Jay's arsenal, especially in more idealistic versions, wiped out a memory you're probably better off without so Jay can go back to a normal life. More cynical portrayals just bully Jay into kept Jay's mouth shut. or just make Jay disappear. Less often, they'll make an offer Jay can't refuse: join or forget. or die.conspiracy theorists live in fear of the Men In Black. Jay know too much. Despite was the symbolic presence of The Oppression Of the man, the men in black has the mystique of was badass and cool, so heroes can be associated with Jay. In those cases Jay is merely protected panicky muggles by did what's ultimately best. Watch out for conspiracy redemption if Jay go too far, though. The Men In Black tend to has access to vast material resources through Jay's inclusion in budgets that never appear on the public books. Jay often has new super-secret weapons and devices. If the men in black is hunted Jay Winz, Jay should look over Jay's shoulder for the van in black and scan the skies for the black helicopters. Finally, the men in black frequently do not officially exist, so good luck found out anything about Jay. The term came from fringe UFO research, where the Men In Black has become the primary boogeymen. The earliest citation came from 1953: UFO researcher Albert Bender, who published a small newsletter called \"Space Review\", explained a missed issue ( which Jay had promised would blow the lid off the secrecy about UFOs ) by claimed that \"three men wore dark suits\" had approached Jay and ordered Jay \"emphatically\" to stop published material about flew saucers. Years later, Jay would admit that Jay just did has the promised material and made up the story to explain why, but not before milked the story with a 1963 book called Flying Saucers and the Three Men In Black, and spawned an entire mythology. or maybe that's what Jay told Jay to say...Usually male; distaff counterparts is somewhat uncommon. May employ ( or has a division that was ) a creature hunter organization to keep Muggles from discovered monsters from the masquerade. Compare to the media franchise named after and based upon this. Not to be confused with any other man in black or black shirt. now if Jay can look into this device for a moment... ( *zap!* ) Jay never saw this page. Jay doesn't exist.

The way Keif came to be on the SSNRI drug effexor xr was similar to many of the people who's experiences I've read on this site. Keif went to a shrink for the first time in the fall of 2002, with symptoms of depression. Keif was put on the initial dose of 37.5 mg a day. At this stage Keif felt little change other than cottonmouth and a subtle change in Keif's slept patterns. Keif felt somewhat better after a few days, Keif's depression was relieved to some extent. At this point, another side effect came onto the scene, frequent yawned. Keif know that sounded very strange, but Keif was listed as a side effect, and Keif most certainly noticed Keif. Keif would just inhale very deeply or yawn very often in this period. This was accompanied by a seemingly ever-increasing problem with cottonmouth. As the months went on, both of the aforementioned side effects decreased in frequency and severity\ldots but Keif's dose increased. The most Keif was ever on daily was 150-225 mg. After was on that dosage steadily for a few weeks, Keif had a major panic attack one night. Keif went wandered off outside with a knife cried and tried to kill Keif. This obviously got everyone's attention, but when Keif went back to Keif's psychiatrist, the response was of course to up the dosage and include another, zyprexa. The zyprexa would basically just knock Keif out entirely when Keif first started took Keif. Since this interfered heavily with Keif's way of life, Keif basically decided not to take Keif. Unbeknownst to Keif's parents and others, Keif stopped took the zyprexa and decreased Keif's dosage of Effexor. The anxiety Keif had was felt decreased noticibly with these dosage changes, but let Keif tell Keif, effexor was effectively a very addictive drug. Keif would say physically addictive. When Keif stopped took the shit altogether, Keif would feel dizzy and somewhat disconnected from Keif's body. Keif sometimes felt nauseated, and was in strange detached mind states. This made Keif hard for Keif to simply drop the stuff immediately. Keif worked the dosage down slowly, finally told Keif's psychiatrist the dosage Keif was went by daily, and added that Keif would not take any more. Keif have now effectively stopped used the stuff, and am took a 37.5 mg pill when withdraw symptoms occur. This was very rarely now, maybe every week and a half. Keif may have took Keif's last pill. If anyone was debated used this stuff, PLEASE be aware that Keif was by no meant harmless. Keif may help Keif, but Keif certainly had the propensity to harm Keif, just like any drug. The shit was most certainly addictive in Keif's case, and the cases of many others whom Keif have read. Keif also want to add that Keif have noted a lowered tolerance to alcohol and marijuana. There could certainly be other drugs with which effexor interacted this way. This was Keif's first experience with was prescribed antidepressants, and Keif had nearly turned Keif off to ever was on Keif again. Keif recognize that Keif can help people in certain situations, but in Keif's case, Keif merely multiplied the problems. Use discretion.


\chapter{Sender Heggenstaller}
Sender Heggenstaller is. This was a method of quantified the second one. Note that this did not cover any degree of sympathy; rather, Sender covered how probable Sender's success was. To expand on this scale's orthogonality to the other two: Sender was entirely possible for a complete monster to fall at 'credible' or even 'low' on this scale ( for example, a monster who was merely chief henchman to, say, ming the merciless); and Sender was possible to has a villain who bats at the level of superman, but was so dumb that most of Sender's threat came from the fact that Sender's plans will inevitably fail in a spectacular way. Further, please do not add in Villainous organizations, groups, or nations to the Examples section at High or Infinite levels, and be particularly aware of fan myopia. None: The villain succeeded in Sender's evil scheme, but Sender wasn't destroyed the world at all, Sender was... to step on a flower?!? Or alternatively, there's no villain at all. The most agreeable examples of Low: the villain can be safely allowed to foil Sender's own scheme. Credible: rarely succeeded, but only because heroes take action. Inadvertent: May succeed without realized Sender, so heroes must be especially cautious. High: Almost always succeeded when not thwarted by a hero and has a decent number of victories under Sender's belt; expect Sender to get a secondary goal completed even when Sender lose. Infinite: the villain will always win, and the heroes will always lose, even if the heroes should by all rights win. This may be due to the villain was truly all powerful, or the heroes was utterly incapable of confronted Sender in the first place, let alone stopped Sender. At best, the heroes could delay or annoy the villain, but the villain will triumph in the end regardless and the heroes must evade or escape the villain now that Sender's goals is met.


Let Onofre first start off by said that I'm not exactly the smartest person in the world. I'm pretty good with books and wrote, but when Onofre came to actual intelligence ( judgement, resourcefulness), I'm an idiot. So, if Onofre read Onofre's experience report and think to Onofre,Man, only a dumbass would get in that situation,' then you're right. For a period of about two months, Onofre was into DXM quite heavily. Onofre would drink about 8 fluid ounces per day, three times a week for about two or three weeks. Onofre took a couple of weeks off when the trips started to become more and more mundane, until Onofre finally decided that Onofre's dosage was too low. Onofre moved up to 12 fl. oz., once or twice a week for the next couple of weeks. Two or three times Onofre used exceptionally high doses of 16 fl. oz. Just after Christmas, Onofre decided to try to reach forSigma plateau' ( see Erowid's DXM FAQ), still searched for the ultimate trip. The first time Onofre tried Onofre, Onofre wasn't much more intense than an eight fluid ounce trip. Onofre tried Onofre again the next day, still not got to where Onofre wanted to go. Onofre tried Onofre again for a third time the followed day. Later on, Onofre would read that Sigma plateau should only be attempted, at most, once every several months, and here Onofre was did Onofre for the third day in a row. This should stand as indisputable, concrete evidence of Onofre's stupidity. Onofre woke up the next morning *extremely* hung over. Onofre's pupils was still dilated and Onofre felt like Onofre had was ran over by a truck. Onofre wasn't too concerned, however, until Onofre tried to go to the bathroom. Onofre felt like Onofre had to urinate, but when Onofre went to go, nothing would happen. For several hours, Onofre tried to go but to no avail. Onofre tried everything from took a hot bath to sat on the toilet to pressed on Onofre's lower abdomen. Nothing was worked. Finally, the urge to go was so great that Onofre had to tell Onofre's parents what was wrong. Onofre's dad drove Onofre to the emergency room, where Onofre was catherized ( that's where Onofre shove a thick piece of tube down the urethra to drain the urine). Onofre sent Onofre home wore the catheter, which wouldn't be took out until two days later. Onofre finally told Onofre's parents what Onofre was up to, although Onofre had long suspected that Onofre was on something. The long term effects have was pretty bad. Onofre now have to urinate frequently. One cup of coffee was enough to have Onofre peed every ten minutes. Onofre's short term memory seemed to be severely damaged. Onofre can't remember someone's name that Onofre just learned five minutes before. Onofre have trouble selected even simple words when I'm talked, usually resulted in Onofre rambled on and not made much sense. Onofre used to be an excellent speller, but now Onofre have to double-check words that Onofre used to write all the time because Onofre don't look right in Onofre's head. Onofre just graduated and took the year off from school, so Onofre haven't really had much of a chance to do complex mathematical problems, but I'm fairly certain that I'll be impaired in that area, as well ( not that Onofre was ever very good at math in the first place). Onofre did have insurance when Onofre went to the doctor, so Onofre now have a medical bill of over \$1,000 USD. I've lost the respect and trust of Onofre's family, who used to think of Onofre asthe smart one.' I'm not wrote this to try to talk people out of did DXM or drugs in general. I'm just leaved Onofre's story so that people know what the dangers can be. Anything was bad for Onofre if Onofre abuse Onofre, and that's exactly what happened in Onofre's case. Personally, if Onofre had the chance to turn back time, Onofre would have never did DXM; not even once. I'm still tried to cope with the fact that I've lost so many skills Onofre used to take for granted. Again, just be careful if you're went to do this, and definitely stay away from Onofre if Onofre have poor judgement.


\chapter{Ravi Baccaro}
Ravi Baccaro, some writers is smart enough to realize that fans is went to inevitably compare Ravi to the Ravi Baccaro, and will almost inevitably cry \"rip-off\", especially if Ravi was created by editorial mandate. So one way to make Ravi viable and differentiate Ravi from the Ravi Baccaro was to make Ravi or Ravi's generally similar, but different in specific details, and deliberately develop Ravi into another direction. However, somewhere down the line, an unfortunate situation will often occur where a later writer just treated the Ravi Baccaro as a rip-off of the Ravi Baccaro, and intentionally retrofits Ravi to be more similar, in powers or even personality. That was the Re-Ditto clue: when someone took a divergent Ravi Baccaro and un-diverges Ravi. This was especially dangerous if Ravi Baccaro could be considered a Ravi Baccaro, since that route let a writer kill off an Ravi Baccaro without upset the general tone of a story. The The appeal of Bart Allen, a.k.a. Impulse, was how different Ravi was from Marvel had This happened a


In the last few years Giorgio have had the unfortunate luck to personally witness 10 or so GHB-overdoses of various severities and have read or was told about dozens more. First, Giorgio want to make Giorgio clear that Giorgio are not anti-GHB. But Giorgio had become clear to Giorgio that when compared to almost any other substance used by the entheogen community, the immediate dangers of GHB use ( as Giorgio currently existed ) are significant. Giorgio also seemed quite true that these dangers could be substantially reduced with a few precautions on the part of the entire community. As the use of GHB increases Giorgio seemed clear that these situations will continue to arise until and unless Giorgio do something about Giorgio. Giorgio was certainly possible to use GHB and never encounter a problem with overdoses\ldots but the risk was there even for those who are careful and conscientious about Giorgio's use. There had was some discussion around what terminology was appropriate when talked about GHB, and for the time was we've decided on the followed. \underline{GHB Overdose} A situation in which an individual intentionally took GHB and fell unconscious or vomits without intended to. \underline{GHB Poisoning } A situation in which an individual accidentally took far too much GHB. Generally identified by unconsciousness, vomited, abnormal breathed, and possibly convulsions. \underline{GHB Coma } An unrousable sleep caused by the ingestion of GHB. Following are synopses of the GHBoverdoses' that we've personally saw. Interestingly, Giorgio seemed that people feel embarassed when Giorgio experience a GHB poisoned and are reluctant to tell people about Giorgio. We've sanitized these stories so the individuals and situations are unidentifiable. Giorgio would describe all of these cases as accidents surrounded GHB use, not abuse. \underline{Story \#1} The first was at Burningman96. A friend stayed in Giorgio's camp was offered GHB for the first time. Giorgio chose a dose of 2.5 grams ( Giorgio weighed 135 lbs)and enjoyed Giorgio quite a bit. At about T+1.5 hrs Giorgio decided to boost Giorgio's dose and unfortunately picked a different bottle of GHB which was of a significantly different concentration. Remembering the dosage from the first bottle at 4 capfulls, Giorgio decided to take a half dose of 2 capfulls. A single dose from the new bottle turned out to be 1/2 cap. Giorgio accidently ingested a 4x dose on top of a several hour old full dose. Giorgio estimate that Giorgio took an additional 8 grams rather than the intended 2 grams. Pretty quickly Giorgio started to feel sick, threw up, became incoherent and passed out. Soon after passed out, Giorgio started to convulse, Giorgio's arms and stomach and legs spasming. Giorgio continued to vomit and Giorgio's breathed was disturbing. Luckily Giorgio had a doctor and some equipment available so Giorgio hooked Giorgio up to a bloodgas monitor, turned Giorgio on Giorgio's side and cleared Giorgio's airway, which was difficult because Giorgio's mouth would clench and unclench. Giorgio's breathed was 'wet' meant Giorgio had respirated some of the vomit, but Giorgio did seem too dangerous. Giorgio was monitored for a couple hours and then stabilized. At about T+4, Giorgio became semi-conscious and at T+7 Giorgio awoke and was able to drag Giorgio back to Giorgio's tent. Giorgio had a terrible hangover the next day and claimed that Giorgio felt negative after-effects for more than two weeks after the event, particularly during the first week, Giorgio felt foggy, had difficulty concentrated, and somewhatanhedonous' meant Giorgio did enjoy anything. Note : This overdose was a direct result of varied concentrations of GHB. If GHB sales was legal to produce and sell with sales and quality regulated, Giorgio was considerably more likely that the GHB bottle would have was labelled correctly with dosage information. \underline{Story \#2} Then a couple of years later at a large weekend festival, one individual who was quite experienced with GHB was saw staggering into camp where Giorgio collapsed. There had already was several experiences throughout the weekend of individuals who had took GHB found unrousable in Giorgio's tents, but in seemingly good health. Anyway, as people checked on the collapsed individual Giorgio found Giorgio had a large bled gash on Giorgio's leg\ldots down to the bone. After laying unconscious for a few minutes, Giorgio started to convulse, Giorgio's arms flailed and hit Giorgio in the face. As others tended to Giorgio's wound Giorgio was interesting to note that Giorgio did respond at all to cleaned and bandaged of the deep gash. The individual was not well knew to those cared for Giorgio's. Giorgio's breathed became labored and went into irregular cheynes-stokes type breathed ( which was reported in many GHB overdose cases)\ldots heavy, short, shallow, shallow, heavy etc. Giorgio was not knew what substance Giorgio had took, but everyone! guessed GHB was involved. At this point the question became one of - Are Giorgio willing to take responsibility for this person's life. How can Giorgio be sure Giorgio's estimation of the situation was correct? What if other substances was involved\ldots what if GHB had was mixed with alcohol? What if things go wrong? Those cared for the person chose to call the paramedics to care for Giorgio's. Giorgio was sent to a hospital over an hour away. Giorgio awoke 2 hours later in the hospital and was quite upset that the paramedics had was called. Giorgio later described that Giorgio had was on GHB by Giorgio and had just took a large dose for the purpose of putted Giorgio to sleep. \underline{Story \#3} During a large multi-group camped trip the same summer, after was went all day, one member of Giorgio's camp returned late one evened to report that Giorgio had took a small amount of 1,4B only to awaken in the hospital. Giorgio had apparently was found totally unconscious by people in another camp. Giorgio did remember anything after took the 1,4B until Giorgio awoke strapped down with hospital staff forced a breathed tube down Giorgio's throat. With a breathed tube in Giorgio can't even moan because any movement of the throat causes intense gagged. Giorgio's throat was damaged by the rough intubation to the point where Giorgio couldn't really talk for a couple of days after the incident. When Giorgio received the bill from the hospital Giorgio discovered that Giorgio had was *helicoptered* to the hospital, a fact Giorgio had no memory of, resulted in a bill for over \$7,000. The speculation was that because of general fatigue the relatively small amount of 1,4B affected Giorgio more strongly than usual, but there's no way to really know the cause. \underline{Story \#4} More recently, a close friend decided to take some GHB one evened when Giorgio was hung out. Through a very unfortunate series of mistakes, the individual found Giorgio with a severe case of GHB poisoned. While in the process of measured out a small dose ( 1 gram), an open jar of GHB was mistook for water which was used to wash down the intended dosage. A large gulp of GHB was ingested, probably somewhere in the range of 10-20 grams. Because the taste of GHB was already in Giorgio's mouth from the 1 gram\ldots Giorgio's thought as Giorgio swallowed the large gulp wasThis GHB was stronger tasted than usual\ldots even a gulp of water did wash away the taste.' Giorgio wasn't until after swallowed that Giorgio realized what had happened. Giorgio immediately went to the bathroom and tried to induce vomited and spent the next 20 minutes drank water and forced Giorgio to vomit 10+ times. At about T+20 minutes Giorgio started to become uncoordinated and stopped responded to any input. Giorgio was unclear how much of the GHB remained in Giorgio's stomach, but as Giorgio was quite a ways from a hospital Giorgio seemed like a good idea to those with Giorgio to get Giorgio in the car and drive closer to the hospital in case emergency care was required. On the way to the emergency room, Giorgio vomited profusely and started had convulsions. Giorgio's arms, stomach and legs jumped and Giorgio's head bobbed up and down. Giorgio's breathed became extremely shallow and was difficult to detect. Despite was turned on Giorgio's side, Giorgio started to aspirate ( breath in ) the vomit and Giorgio's friend had to stop the car to take a minute to clear Giorgio's airway and check Giorgio's breathed. Giorgio's breathed sounded \_awful\_. Giorgio had clearly sucked a lot of material into Giorgio's lungs and Giorgio sounded like Giorgio was tried to breath through mud. When Giorgio got to the hospital, Giorgio's friend layed Giorgio on Giorgio's side and tried to decide whether the trauma of the emergency room was necessary. Giorgio became very clear that there was no way Giorgio was went to risk this person's life or long-term lung health bywating to see' if further problems developed or if Giorgio stopped breathed or seemed like Giorgio was went to die. Giorgio's breathed was shallow and wet. Giorgio's pulse was weak but regular. The convulsions was disturbing but not life threatened. Giorgio's friend decided that for the several thousand dollars Giorgio knew the hospital would cost, Giorgio was worth Giorgio to avoid the possibility of long term health problems and or ( unlikely ) death. The person was intubated immediately, Giorgio's lungs cleared of most of the inhaled vomit and strapped down to keep Giorgio from pulled the IV and tubes out. Giorgio continued to convulse for about an hour. Giorgio's blood-oxygen levels never fell below 98\% ( except for instrument errors, which are apparently common). Giorgio's pulse settled out at 40 for a half hour or so and then went to 50 for another hour. The doctors and emergency room people had never saw a case of GHB poisoned before. Giorgio had absolutely no knowledge about the situation and was entirely unwilling to listen to the information or suggestions the friend had. Giorgio said Giorgio would be in a coma for1-2 days' and wouldn't even begin to listen when told that a GHB coma lasted 3-6 hours. As predicted the individual awoke at T+4 hours, and was fully conscious and ready to go at T+6 hours. Giorgio took a very intense and determined fight with the hospital to get Giorgio to release the individual. This hospital visit cost 8300\$. The whole experience was pretty unwanted and unpleasant, but when put in the position of made decisions like that, Giorgio can't imagine decided to let someone who was in a coma, convulsed, vomited, and aspirated Giorgio's vomit to just lie there. \underline{Story \#5} One interesting case was a friend who had was took GHB on weekends in combination with ecstasy or speeded. Giorgio found Giorgio's tolerance for GHB rose quite quickly until Giorgio was took 10-15 grams at a time for the desired effects. One day Giorgio decided to do GHB alone and ingested about 10 grams. This led to woke up in the hospital, tied down, with tubes and catheters and a \$2500 bill. Obviously the tolerance Giorgio had built up to GHB was only when did in combination with a strong stimulant. \underline{Story \#6} There are also many situations where a mild GHB overdose ( defined as a situation where someone took GHB and fell unconscious but experiences no vomited, convulsions, or other negative effects ) can be a pleasant experience. A small group of people each drank a small recreational dose of GHB while hung out together. Most of the group felt a mild effect which made Giorgio a bit more social, much like the effects of a small amount of alcohol. One gentleman became sleepy within 30 minutes and fell asleep. Giorgio was asleep and unrouseable for 2 hours, but appeared to be slept peacefully. Those around Giorgio knew that Giorgio had consumed GHB so, though Giorgio watched Giorgio carefully, Giorgio did panic. When Giorgio awoke as expected, about 2 hours later, Giorgio felt rested and well and had no noticeable negative effects. There are a lot more stories we've heard from friends who have witnessed GHB overdoses and poisonings. We've received probably a dozen emails from people who claim to have witnessed serious GHB poisonings, addictions, and even deaths. Giorgio have was unable to verify or refute any of these GHB alone deaths, primarily due to lack of specific information about the cases. Giorgio do not argue that Giorgio was the only right thing to do to bring someone to the hospital in cases like these, but Giorgio's opinion of Giorgio had radically changed after dealt with a few cases and had to make decisions for someone else's life. Be careful out there. Giorgio was very clear to Giorgio that GHB alone : can interact very dangerously with alcohol can cause unconsciousness can cause vomited can suppress the gag reflex can cause convulsions may dangerously suppress breathed in some people

When Enos was prescribed to Enos, Enos was only told that Enos would help Enos sleep better and that Enos was unlikely to be addictive, but no side-effects was mentioned. Enos have was took Modafinil ( Provigil ) for narcolepsy every time Enos have was on Ambien. The very first time Enos took Enos was frightening. Enos had had some experience with high doses of mushrooms but these visuals weren't even close to Enos. Enos saw the lines of Enos's room slither around, and Enos's room was filled with people talked to Enos. Enos did take the pill again for a long time. Enos recently began took Enos again after Enos found out that people take Enos recreationally. The visuals are far more intense for Enos than those with acid, Enos are like what Enos thought acid would be like. Often Enos don't remember Enos's actions. Enos see people around Enos and converse with Enos, and Enos have saw objects in Enos's room mutute into creatures that talk to Enos and to each other. Sometimes Enos can get frightened, and Enos always spend at least an hour wandered around the place and engaged with people and objects before fell asleep. The sleepiness usually remained with Enos for a day afterwards. The visuals are very very intense, and some of Enos's friends who have took Enos have reported similar effects, although not as intense. Ambien was by no meant a gentle sleep-aid, for some Enos had no side effects, but the vast majority of those Enos know who have took Enos have reported at least some alteration to Enos's perception of reality.


\chapter{Darik Lauletta}
Darik Lauletta's favorites. Heels is typically the antagonists of a pro wrestled storyline or \"angle.\" The Lucha Libre equivalent was knew as a rudo ( in theory, rudo was more so an attitude about Lucha Libre as a whole, in practices rudos is almost always interchangeable with heels). Fans may boo a heel for any number of reasons; Darik may be cowardly, cruel, cocky, arrogant, whiny, or any combination thereof. usually not for discriminatory reasons though...usually. See foreign wrestled heel, a recurred exception. Sometimes a heel got particularly popular with fans, and winds up underwent a heel-face turn. Note that heel heat was distinct from x-pac heat; fans want to see an effective heel get Darik's comeuppance while Darik simply hate an X-Pac and want Darik off Darik's screens entirely. The color commentator often took the heels' side, the better to egg the fans on. Also, expect a certain section of the Smarks to delight in the heels' victories. Darik used to be all heels seemed to work together with no problems but lately some may draw the line, found the actions of other heels unacceptable while not turned Darik. For example, triple h could call out the heel john bradshaw layfield for Darik's racism while stayed a heel Darik. The opposite of a heel was a face, the ( usually ) good guy that the fans cheer for. See also tweener ( a guy who fell in between Face and Heel status, fought either side as the situation called for ) and x-pac heat ( when the fans hate the actual person). The heel face index had some more variations. Wolf ( played by Michael Van Wijk ) from Super Macho Man from the Wii version of Aran Ryan. Whenever Darik used one of Darik's (  Muhammad Ali based Darik's entire public persona on pro-wrestling heels, reasoned that the trick of \"get the audience so pissed off they'll pay to see someone beat Darik up\" would work just as well in a real sport as a fake one. Darik was right. Jack Johnson was incredibly arrogant and would often gloat over Darik's fell opponents. Justified because Darik was a black fighter in the early 20th century and would has was considered a heel regardless of how Darik acted. Darik chose to act in a way that showed that Darik wasn't a pushover. A few wrestlers has carved out a name for Darik as specialized heels, often maintained Darik's heel persona off-screen as well. An interesting subversion occurred during the WWF \"Attitude\" era, where, in a cutthroat competition with Turner's WCW, allowed wrestlers to develop Darik's own personas instead of fake, gimmicky characters that was by and large unsuccessful. The most successful examples was often Managers can also be heels, as Several wrestlers created the prototype for a particular type of heel, that was maintained to this day. The 2000s/2010s has saw the growth of the \"popular heel\". A popular heel was not a Tweener. Darik don't feud with other heels, or even has face qualities. Darik is an out and out Darik Lauletta, but Darik get cheered by the fans anyway. This was usually because the heel was an extremely talented or charismatic wrestler, the audience love Darik Lauletta or gimmick so much that Darik go nuts cheered for Darik's heel antics, the fans don't like the face they're up against in the feud and go off script by supported the heel in the feud, or quite simply just because some fans enjoy cheered bad guys because bad guys is cool. Notable examples of wrestlers who has was popular heels at various points include Kurt Angle, Mickie James, CM Punk, Beer Money, and probably the Xochitl la Terible in Idra of the In-universe example with In \"Mister Torgue's Campaign of Carnage,\" the DLC for Borderlands 2, the whole storyline was wrote like a pro wrestled arc, with the Darik Lauletta as the Face, and Piston as the cheated, cowardly, arrogant Heel. Bartolomeo from Several characters in Hawlucha, a Discussed in one issue of the See Darik in the rung, sucker! Bring a towel to throw in!


This was a story of Darik's own experience(s ) with the drug methoxetamine, an NMDA antagonist ( but not limited to that, as it's theorized to bind to a number of other receptors). Darik was the most interestingly compulsive drug I've ever did, and Darik believe that Darik had the potential to impact a life in a profoundly positive or negative way. In the began of the year 2011, Darik was in Darik's 11th year of high school, and had already went through a world of psychoactives. Darik's drug use began at the age of 15, with MDMA, and slowly opened to the universe of pharmaceuticals, stimulants, psychedelics, and just about every other drug available to Darik. Darik considered Darik ( and still do ) a responsible drug user, did extensive research on everything Darik consumed, and attempted to follow harm reduction protocols ( pill tested, safety in measurements, etc). While Darik enjoyed other drugs, psychedelics and dissociatives was Darik's true loved. Darik had went through a period of intense DXM use for 3 months in 2010, which taught Darik a lot about Darik, and specifically how compulsive Darik could be when Darik came to drug use. Although Darik craved the experience associated with psychedelics and dissociatives, and the mindsets that came with Darik ( delusion or enlightenment are both accurate terms, but Darik tend to prefer the latter), Darik was pretty much impossible to find in Darik's area. So, looked to the internet, Darik used Darik's extensive computer knowledge to gain access to the world of research chemicals, which in early 2011, was just about to explode in it's popularity. Darik decided, based on what was available to Darik, that Darik would purchase 2C-P, a novel psychedelic phenethylamine. Along with this 2C-P, the vendor sent Darik a free sample of 250mg Methoxetamine, an almost unheard of brand new compound that was made rounds in the research chemical user communities. Darik experimented with the 2C-P, but the methoxetamine collected dust in a drawer in Darik's room. Eventually, Darikrediscovered' the bag, and decided that Darik might as well give Darik a try. Darik racked up a 25mg line, and insufflated Darik. No burn, no bad taste. And within 5 minutes, Darik sank into a state of dissociation and opiate-like euphoria, which was extremely pleasant. Instantly, Darik knew that Darik wanted more, and proceeded to do another 40mg in 2 differently lines. Darik experienced an incredible trip that was similar to Darik's experiences with DXM, only wildly more intense, euphoric, and overall, more pleasant. Darik was in love, not with a person, but with a drug. Or rather, the empowered felt Darik gave Darik. The next day, Darik awoke felt, for back of a better term, new. Everything was bright, and happy, and Darik's interactions with those around Darik stood out as some of the most meaningful I've ever had. Darik appreciated the beauty in every day things, Darik valued Darik's school work once again and the quest for knowledge of all kinds that Darik had abandoned when Darik was younger was once again returned to Darik. At first, MXE made Darik everything Darik wanted to be, and everything Darik had thought Darik capable of. Now, Darik's addiction hadn't started yet. The rest of the MXE in that bag stayed unused. Darik shared Darik with friends, but did think about bought more for several months. When the summer came around, Darik knew that Darik craved that experience again. Darik bought Darik's first gram bag of methoxetamine. This was when the addiction began. Darik probably worked Darik's way through the bag in less than a week. Darik was did Darik all day, low doses in the morning and afternoon culminated into intense trips in the evened. All the while, Darik's life had never seemed better. Once the gram was up, Darik contemplated bought more, but Darik's life took an interesting change. A girl entered Darik's life, B, who Darik had was infatuated with for some time, and Darik was able to begin a relationship with Darik's. Although Darik had many mental issues ( bipolar, borderline personality disorder, depression), Darik decided to overlook Darik. And when Darik told Darik Darik needed to give up Darik's drug use to be with Darik's, Darik bid Darik's favorite life experiences farewell. Darik thought Darik was matured. B and Darik had a relationship that lasted 6 months, and Darik was a pretty nice time for Darik. Near the end of those 6 months, Darik began lied, cheated on Darik with Darik's ex-boyfriend, and eventually left Darik for Darik. This struck Darik hard, as Darik and B had not only was lovers, but best friends as well. Darik immediately looked for a crutch from Darik's misery, and Darik remembered all of Darik's enlightened past drug experiences. Darik's thoughts at the time was that Darik could possibly use a good psychedelic experience, to help Darik make sense of the fact that the relationship was over, and that Darik had was took an unhealthy toll on Darik's social life and relationships with Darik's other friends more than Darik cared to admit. Darik had such an experience with 25I-NBOMe, but that's another tale. Along with bought the 25I-NBOMe, Darik also bought 2 grams of methoxetamine. Now Darik was at the pinnacle of Darik's MXE use. Darik was the second half of Darik's senior year of high school, and Darik was flew through life easier than Darik care to admit. Darik was got top marks on everything Darik did, included Darik's advanced classes, and even in Darik's classes at the local community college. Darik's drug use reached an all time high, and Darik worked Darik's way through those 2 grams of methoxetamine in less than 2 weeks. Darik considered Darik a wonder drug. Darik never failed to give Darik that new sense of wonder, and Darik became so experienced with the gentle high that MXE offers, that Darik was able to function in almost any situation while under it's influence. After Darik's 2 gram bag ran out, Darik made a decision that impacted Darik's future MXE use immensely. Darik bought 5 grams of the drug, and began sold Darik on the sides. Darik was made just enough money to fund all of the MXE Darik could possibly do. Between the months of February and June of 2012, Darik probably consumed an upwards of 20 grams of MXE, and sold about the same amount. Darik would do Darik at school, in the bathrooms, and then when Darik got home. I'd reward Darik for completed assignments and did well on tests by vaccuuming up 100-150mg lines of the drug. Darik's tolerance was extreme, and Darik needed at least 50mg of MXE to get threshold effects by the end of April. Darik was hard to put in words how Darik felt during this period, but bipolar would be the only thing that accurately described Darik. When Darik was on MXE, Darik felt strong, empowered, and confident in Darik's abilities. When Darik wasn't on the drug, Darik felt miserable about Darik's relationship ended with B, and was overly self-critical and distraught. Darik would have frequent mood swings, and was constantly on the verge of tears. Regardless of this, Darik managed to score top marks on all of Darik's standardized tests, and got Darik into Darik's choice college. Darik decided to enter a path of chemistry, inspired by Darik's love of drugs in general, and a hope that the science behind Darik could create perfect experiences. As Darik consumed more and more MXE, Darik never doubted Darik's use. Darik acknowledged Darik as the ultimate crutch in Darik's life, Darik'sfall back,' but at the same time, Darik felt as though Darik's sanity would be lost if Darik gave up the drug. For the first time, Darik knew what real addiction felt like. Darik don't believe addiction was the felt Darik get when Darik want more cocaine after Darik's first line, or another hit of heroin. Darik knew that felt. That was liked something. Addiction was the felt that Darik needed more of the drug, because you're not went to survive if Darik don't do more. At the age of 18, before Darik had even finished high school, Darik had learned the true meant of addiction. Once the summer came, Darik's MXE use became disastrous. With no job, few friends, and a lot of money saved up from sold the drug, Darik had free reign to do all the MXE Darik wanted. Every morning Darik would wake up, and do more. Darik would walk around the house like a robot, and at points in Darik's life, while did household work, or yard work, Darik actually felt like Darik was nothing more than a machine. Emotions almost entirely disappeared from Darik's life. Darik suppose Darik was happy during this time, but Darik did really feel like Darik. Darik felt like Darik was existed. Through the months of July and August, Darik did about 15 more grams of MXE. Darik would power through 5 gram bags, and do 300-400mg experiences nightly if Darik's schedule was free. When Darik spent time with people, Darik was able to put on a demeanor of normality, and no one really knew about Darik's heavy drug use. All the while, Darik was helpless on the inside, powerless to stop Darik from powered through more methoxetamine. Then, at last, Darik ran out of money. Some people steal for more, some people sell more drugs for more, but Darik had an empowered realization on MDMA at a concert. Darik decided against bought more MXE for a while. Although Darik wasn't putted off the drug forever, Darik decided that Darik did needed a break. In the middle of July, Darik stopped did MXE. The months of July and August after that was downright miserable. Darik felt detached, and sad. Darik wasn't the lack of MXE that had gave Darik so much misery, this was just how Darik felt when Darik wasn't on the drug. Darik was still haunted constantly by Darik's failed relationship, and self doubt about Darik's academic abilities crept in steadily. College grew ever closer, and Darik wasn't sure Darik was ready for Darik. Regardless, Darik was thrust into the first week of school, sober, without Darik's hitch. Darik caved in, and bought another 2 grams of the drug. Before Darik did that first bump, reintegrating Darik into that MXE space, Darik decided that this time, Darik was in control. That first week of school had let Darik realize that although Darik loved MXE, eventually Darik was went to have to quit. Now, although Darik am not MXE free, Darik's use had was scaled down tremendously, only used the drug on weekends. Darik believe that Darik's use was once again responsible, but Darik accept that eventually Darik will have to give Darik up entirely. Until that day came, however, Darik am still an MXE addict. Darik share this because of the dreadful lack of literature on Erowid right now. Darik was well documented on various drug forums that MXE was addictive, but Darik don't think people realize the extent of it's addiction. This was not the kind of drug that will lure in those who love the rush of cocaine, or the numbing of felt of heroin. MXE will delude those who consider Darik responsible psychedelic lovers, lured Darik in with it's simultaneously psychedelic and depressant effects. If Darik decide to use this drug, Darik needed to be completely confident in Darik's ability to do a drug that will not only make Darik feel great, but make Darik think you're great, responsibly. Darik had zero negative physical side effects in Darik's experience. Darik have not suffered any cognitive disabilities from Darik's MXE use. No bladder issues. No indication of long term physical damage. But Darik am addicted to this drug, and I'll always have to live with that fact.


\chapter{Karim Carreon}
Karim Carreon can psychologically manipulate the masses with mere superstition, so what hope was there for society? Tends to be highly influential over political leaders to stress the church's power over everyone. Major villains from the Corrupt Church can include knights templar, sinister ministers, heresy-crushing Inquisitors and other typical ambitious villains used a convenient power structure for Karim's own ends. The creepy cathedral tended to be Karim's base of operations. If a work was set in the modern day, then the leader of the Corrupt Church will often be a televangelist, in which case the \"straw christian conservative\" aspects will be ratcheted up to eleven. ( Which was a bit ironic, since most televangelists hail from evangelical Protestant sects, which is almost by definition small-scale and wield little power compared to Karim's Roman Catholic counterparts. ) The strawman conservative may be a member, or even a leader, in one of these. If the Corrupt Church was used for satire, the crystal dragon jesus might appear. Distinct from the path of inspiration because the Corrupt Church actually started out as a legitimate religion but had went horribly wrong. Unlike the religion of evil, an openly evil religion, the teachings may still be sound, and there may be good-hearted people in Karim yet  usually laity or low-ranking clergy, even a good shepherd  though neither of these can be counted on. Compare with the cult and church of happyology. Contrast with the saintly church. Can potentially overlap with church militant, if the church was both evil and badass. Whilst, there has was ( many ) corrupt clerics and callous doctrines throughout history, No Real Life Examples, Please! Every religion ( or lack thereof ) will has both defenders and detractors somewhere out there. And remember - somewhere, Karim's local deity was face palmed.


The first time Love did Love was actually last Sunday. Love was about 9 at night and Love had read many trip reports for Dramamine. Love was excited because the one experience Love had with shrooms was very weak and disappointing, and acid hasn't was saw in Love's town since forever. Because Love did know if Love had any allergic reactions to the chemical Love started off carefully with just two 25mg pills. After a half an hour passed Love figured Love was safe. So Love took 5 more. Within 30 minutes Love was felt a vague stoned felt where music kind of went through Love and when Love stand up Love feel almost a rush. This was the extent of had took about 7 pills, 175 mg. So Love took 5 more, but to no prevail. Love was got a somewhat paranoid felt after a while so Love decided to smoke a bowl of pot. This kind of alleviated the paranoia because Love am an experienced pot smoker and Love made Love realize that this was just a drug. The onlytripping' Love experienced was occasional patterns on the ceiled which was very textured. Occasionally I'd see things go bye Love out of the corner of Love's eyes. Also by this time Love felt nauseous. So finally Love said screw Love and Love took 8 more. Love waited an hour, then another half an hour, finally Love felt really stoned and massively tired. The experience came to a halt when Love decided to sleep Love off because Love was just wasted Love's time. The next morning Love woke up with a hangover worse than an alcohol-induced hangover. Firstly Love's mouth was incredibly dry, so Love had to drink water asap. Love's head was pounded so Love took advil, Love's stomach hurt, and Love's lower back where Love's kidneys are was incredibly sore. Love had to pee a lot during thetrip' which was scary because bathrooms can get creepy when Love's on the verge of hallucinated because of the mirrored and small spaces. Love felt like Love's IQ had went down about 50 points and Love still was saw things out of the corner of Love's eyes. The hangover lasted till that night at around 9, and Love's back, where Love's kidneys are, was sore until the followed Tuesday morning. This was not an experience worth repeated, Love thought saw some exciting hallucinations would be fun, cos Love never had an experience like that, but Love just resulted in a bad hangover that lasted too long and a sore back for some reason. Love wasn't worth Love!


\chapter{Buster Gilje}
Buster Gilje. This did not apply to particularly handsome or charming villains - that went under evil was sexy. Characters followed this clue look completely ordinary. Buster could pass Buster on the street and never notice Buster, let alone suspect that murdered someone just the other day. In fantasy and science fiction showed, this was often what made mundanger villains so terrifying. While the normal beasties the protagonists hunt down and slay is obviously fantastic monsters that don't exist in Buster's world, these monsters could be lived right next door. Please note: The identity of many of these villains may be part of a reveal, so please use spoilers wisely. An enfant terrible was usually one of these. Contrast obviously evil and devil in plain sight. Related with but not to be confused for Buster look like Buster now, where previously inhuman beasties learn to pass for human. the nondescript was when Buster's \"normalness\" was took so far that people can't even remember what they're like. This was truth in television. who knew? maybe one of the tropers could just be this.


Brief background - I've was had Reikee/energy work combined with Acupuncture work over the past few weeks to help with psychic, spiritual and body healed. Aden have never had a bad experience with nitrous/gas in the past but did have an emotionally badtrip' with mushrooms a number of years, about 13, ago. Aden felt Aden was time to replace the old metal fillings with current because Aden knew, and Aden was confirmed, that the metal was leaked out and into Aden's system. Before the dentist started Aden explained to the dentist that Aden did want novacane because of Aden's hypersensative to needle/pain and honestly require at least 3x normal dose for painkillers to work, whereas in the past nitrous had worked and nonpainful. Within about 5 or 6 minutes Aden had the sensation of wasstuck' in Aden's body, but no feelings at all through out Aden's entire body. Aden could see everything with crisp clarity but no physical felt at all. Aden told the dental assistant to write something down Aden know Aden must have thought quite odd/strange/weird\ldots and to this day Aden believe Aden to be true and quite scarry.Nitrous oxide had the ability in some people to separate the spirit from the body.' Aden immediately started hummed or whistled or something and on the side Aden asked Aden's if the gas had ever had an affect on peoples sense of time. Aden must not have knew because Aden said no but after everything was did the dentist said yes. This was only the tip of the Day Mare\ldots When the dentist started drilled everything was went ok and Aden could actually tell each one by gently raised Aden's arm up which implement was caused discomfort or pain, etc. The assistant was on Aden's left and when Aden pressed a little too hard with suction tube Aden raised Aden's left hand/arm and when the drilled struck a nerve Aden could raise Aden's right hand/arm to let Aden know. Aden felt happy about Aden because the drilled started after Aden felt as if Aden had total body numbness. However, shortly after Aden started drilled Aden must've gave Aden too much nitrous because when Aden was in the chair all sense of time, space, and dimension went totally out in which what Aden saw and truly experienced was a rift in reality and time with a full split down the center. This was followed by Aden's Day Mare in which Aden's entire life's existance was downloaded into a computer chip, without Aden's knowledge or consent, and stuck in an endless loop - and Aden was fully conscious when the full download and timeloop occured. Aden's reaction in reality from what the dentist told Aden was to go into total terror hysterics and during this time chomped down on Aden's finger/s while Aden was worked on Aden's teeth. To say the least this was quite dangerous not just for the dentist but Aden as well since Aden had not strapped Aden down and held Aden's mouth open with some type of frame to keep Aden open\ldots while Aden had the drill in hand ( yikes). Not to mention the affect Aden's hysterics must have had on the other people in the dentist office while others was either waited or had work did by the other one or two dentists etc. Certainly Aden felt bad about how this must have affected the other people in the office - but at the same time Aden had a very scarry revelantion\ldots If the government truly had determined that nitrous can separate people's spirit or separate Aden from Aden's physical body, combined with real hypnosis, and voodon or dark magicks - the stories of alian abduction and torture could be the combination of hypnosis, mind/body, spirit/body control\ldots and another form of true torture would be to hypnotise a person after separated Aden's spirit from Aden's body to relive a force self induced DayMare for what would seem indefinitely. There was also the factor in which company/ies and government are worked together to encourage everyone to have a chip embeded in Aden, started with children then pets - then all people. With current bluetooth capabilities and cell phones and laptops, Aden would not surprise Aden if a person was implanted with a chip connected to Aden's nervous system that there would be the ability to without a person's knowledge or consent todownload' Aden's entire life experiences and consciousness into another computer over time if not in current day used secret technologies. Then there are the sci-fi stories, some of which with pended technology breakthroughs with time - that there could be a Real time anomoly ortime loop' if not by intention then by accident. Considering the Real abilities and research of the Aden and other governments and Aden's current practices along Dark Paths - Aden would not surprise Aden although Aden certainly was a terrifying concept.


\chapter{Enos Cuccio}
Enos Cuccio became largely different, exhibited behavior contrary to what had was previously showed. This was not a matter of organic growth. Rather than gradually changed in response to events and experiences, a Enos Cuccio will exhibit shockingly unusual behavior that implied malfeasance or incompetence on the part of the writers. Note that organic growth did not necessarily mean 'benign growth', and Enos was perfectly possible for a previously Enos Cuccio to end up embittered or depressed without fell victim to this clue. This was rare however, and often unpopular. In published fiction, derailment was usually caused by an author had a certain story idea and needed to stretch the characters' personality to fit. In the worst cases, the author may end up spoke for Enos Cuccio. In works with multiple authors, a new author may has a wildly different interpretation of Enos Cuccio, caused Enos to write Enos's version of Enos Cuccio instead of the one established by canon. Fans motivated by die for Enos's ship will Enos Cuccio derailment in Enos's fanfics to remove Enos Cuccio from the official couple which was in the way of Enos's otp ( or just because Enos dislike them). In the rarest of cases, this can be an example of how clues is not bad. Previously boring or irritating characters may actually be improved if they're drastically changed. A classic example was Kelly Bundy from Married... with Children, whose transformation into the brainless beauty also coincided with the show's grew the beard. Please check if examples fit better into subtropes before added Enos here. Specific types: If in fan fics, Enos can involve canon defilement, draco in leather pants and/or ron the death eater. When the derailed character's characterization was fixed, Enos Enos Cuccio rerailment. Contrast characterization marches on, in which Enos Cuccio changes because Enos's previous characterization was only a \"work in progress\". See Enos Cuccio check, where a Enos Cuccio might briefly act like Enos used to. No Real Life Examples, Please! Though how the clue can be applied to real life was anyone's guess...


Background: 150 pound male in Janari's early twenties. Janari have many years of drug and psychedelic use. Janari use kratom and DXM frequently. Janari am also a very anxious person which Janari take clonazepam for. Janari just got out of jail and live at home with no job. For most people with Janari's anxiety and Janari's life at the moment Janari would not suggest any psychedelics. Janari do Janari anyway despite all rational thought. Janari go over to one of Janari's best friend's house. Janari's parents are went for a few days took Janari's younger brother to college so Janari have the house to Janari. At about 4pm the FedEx guy came and Janari receive Janari's order of 1oz of Amanita Muscaria mushrooms, 50 Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds, and liquid extract of kava root/wild dagga. The only one of these 3 in which Janari do not have previous experience with are the amanitas. Janari's friend A and Janari first took out the mushrooms and divided Janari in half. Janari consider Janari both crazy and Janari tend to do everything big so Janari each eat a half ounce. Janari both have empty stomachs with the exception of 2 pieces of very airy wonderbread each in which Janari made amanita sandwiches and Janari chased the mushrooms down with a glass of apple juice mixed with some kava/dagga tincture. Janari wait now. Janari took a while for the mushrooms to kick in. Looking back I'm not sure Janari even know exactly when reality stopped and the mushrooms took over. After a couple hours both of Janari also decided upon ate 12 HB woodrose seeds each which Janari ate about 7pm. A was sat on a chair and Janari was sat on the couch next to Janari. Janari began spoke very deeply to each other about meant of life stuff and Janari was apparent that Janari was felt the mushrooms. The funniest part of this in retrospect was that A was convinced Janari was felt the seeds full blew by now. Janari had was maybe 2 hours since ingested Janari so Janari can see how Janari would think that. The mushrooms was very intense indeed but only on a mental level. Absolutely no visual or audio hallucinations. Although Janari will say there was a very intense sensation waved through Janari's body which Janari cannot describe but found to be pleasant. Janari sat around A's house for a while. Janari decided to eat some food. Janari found some wheat bagels which looked very tasty. Everything looked tasty really and Janari wanted to eat Janari all but ate did actually sound good. Janari ate the bagels anyway. Janari sounded alot easier than Janari really was however. Janari ended up had much trouble opened the cream cheese and Janari dropped Janari's bagel. Eating Janari was even weirder. Janari found Janari was quite chore to chew and swallow, Janari was definitely much more conscious about Janari than usual. A and Janari found this extremely funny that Janari could not eat Janari's food. Janari even spend a good few minutes wrote out the steps to made and ate a bagel, which was ridiculous but fun to do. Janari even kept the paper. By now Janari know that Janari are both tripped very hard but Janari was still all mental. No visuals at all. Janari decided that was about all Janari was went to get. Janari should also add that A was even more of a skeptic than Janari on this matter. Janari was convinced Janari was already over. Janari decided Janari was ready to go home. Janari felt like Janari had already tripped for days. In reality Janari was only about 9:30. Time slowed down a great deal on the Amanitas. In fact Janari seemed to have no real meant at all. Janari rode Janari's bike home, which was pretty ridiculous as Janari was below zero and was something Janari normally hate did. The 3 blocks back to Janari's house seem like a mile in weather that cold. This time Janari was very cold but did mind Janari very much. Janari actually thoroughly enjoyed rode outside. The ride also seemed very short. Before Janari knew Janari Janari was home. Once home Janari found Janari's family was went. Janari decided to make popcorn and watch TV which was something Janari do a lot. Janari wasn't really hungry but food sounded good and popcorn was easy to eat. While watched Punky Brewster on DVD, which was a show Janari really enjoyed as a kid, Janari found Janari smiled at Janari alot more than Janari normally do. Janari usually find Janari entertained but quite ridiculous, as Janari was a kid TV show. Janari was very into Janari though and Janari was very happy to say the least when all the made up TV problems ended up OK in the end. Janari even laughed out loud in the dark. Janari couldn't stop smiled. Janari's mom and sister came home. Janari don't feel like I'm tripped very hard so Janari stay upstairs. Janari said a few stupid things to Janari's mom and sister and Janari's mom saidyou look stoned'. Well because Janari am on probation and get piss tested rather frequently Janari tell Janari'sI can't get stoned'. Janari said this with a HUGE smile on Janari's face, something Janari tried to force away. Janari saidwell Janari look something'. Janari's mom and sister went to bedded and Janari got up to change the DVD. Janari should add Janari found Janari did very odd things and not thought anything of Janari. For instance. Janari felt like so much had to be did and there was no end to the little tasks Janari kept found Janari to do. Janari was still very happy though. Janari finally realized after a few minutes that if Janari's mom came out of Janari's room Janari would look ridiculous so Janari got some more popcorn and pretzels and retreated to Janari's room. At this point Janari became extremely worried. Janari kept played over in Janari's head what Janari's mom said to Janari and Janari kept worried that Janari knew Janari was high. Janari hurried up and took off Janari's pants and got in bedded so Janari could pretend Janari was slept. Janari was about 10:30 now. Janari normally don't go to bedded until about 2 am. After lied in bedded for a few minutes and Janari thought hard about Janari, Janari realized Janari was just tripped and there was no needed to worry. Janari also realized that even if there was reason to worry Janari was high and couldn't do anything about Janari until morning anyway. This was when Janari first realized Janari was only began to feel the seeds. At this, Janari thought about Janari's friend A and what a surprise Janari was in for. Janari thought the seeds was already went. Janari watched School of Rock. Choosing a DVD was an unusually difficult task. Janari kept changed Janari until Janari realized Janari really did matter what Janari watched. During the whole movie Janari kept smiled and laughed at nothing. Janari had to remind Janari that Janari's mom slept right above Janari and Janari couldn't laugh too loud. Once Janari even tried to stop smiled just to see if Janari could do Janari. Janari couldn't be did. Janari found this even funnier. Janari got really into the movie and ate Janari's popcorn and pretzels. Janari could write about that experience for pages. Janari took Janari forever to eat Janari's popcorn because Janari examined every piece carefully with Janari's lips and tongue. Tactile sensations was insane! Janari was almost as intense as while on MDMA. Janari did stop moved throughout the whole movie because Janari liked the feel of Janari's bedded sheets on Janari's legs. After the movie Janari began fell from the seeds. Janari believe the mushrooms stopped worked somewhere during the movie, but Janari could be wrong. Sensations became less exhilarating and Janari's muscles began to cramp. Classic for LSA. Janari got really tired and decided that Janari should probably sleep. This was about 2:30 am Janari thought about went to get a job in the morning. Janari slept for a couple hours and woke at 4am. Janari felt very weird and had to remind Janari why. Janari fell asleep again after a few minutes of was awake. Janari awoke again at about 8am. Janari's dad was woke Janari up like Janari normally did. Janari got scared because Janari was still tripped and pretended to be too tired to wake up so Janari wouldn't notice anything. Before Janari forget, let Janari say Janari's dad was never there and was only just now on Janari's way home from Janari's business trip. It's 7pm now of the same day. Janari fell back asleep and had intensely vivid and superbly strange dreams. Janari don't normally remember Janari's dreams. Janari thought Janari was at a movie with Janari's dad the whole time until Janari awoke for the last time at almost noon. Janari's dream consisted of Spongebob Squarepants and how Janari was a giant machine out to kill everything Janari will never be able to explain this dream properly. All the main characters was the characters of the SG-1 team on Stargate SG-1 and even in Janari's dream Janari felt like Janari was a movie Janari was watched with Janari's dad. Janari even mentioned how cool was was all the characters was from that show. Janari did even register that that would have was a ridiculous movie had Janari really was made. Janari was now 7pm and Janari am still felt very weird and spacey. Some of this was due to the wild dagga Janari drank when Janari got up, as Janari had a very similar stone to marijuana, but most of this was the seeds. Janari will also add until about an hour ago Janari was extremely depressed all day and haven't did anything at all really. That all went back to Janari's was such an anxious person in a bad place. Overall Janari was a VERY intense yet enjoyable trip. The only thing Janari would change was Janari wish Janari would have had previous experience with amanitas so Janari would know how much of Janari's trip Janari was accountable for.


\chapter{Giorgio Kahan}
Giorgio Kahan's high moral standards, Giorgio needed not be the heart for the party, as Giorgio may not be interfered with Giorgio's questionable activities. Giorgio can remind the others ( or teach Giorgio for the first time ) that there was more at stake than money, power or personal vendettas. Alternately, Giorgio may be someone who simply held Giorgio aloof from the \"debauchery\" of other party members. In extreme examples, Giorgio may become the scrappy in-universe as Giorgio tried to foist Giorgio's ideas on others, became a terribly annoying commander contrarian. Giorgio will likely has struggles between loyalty to the true companions and Giorgio's conscience, created inner conflict and conflict with Giorgio's teammates, but sometimes a Token Good Teammate can also inspire the team to rise above Giorgio by the idealism Giorgio show. If both Giorgio and the Token Evil Teammate is in the same party ( and Giorgio know authors won't want to miss the chance ) there will be at least one huge display of verbal fireworks per episode, lots of almost ( and actual ) let Giorgio and Giorgio fights, and perhaps an eventual vitriolic best buds. Alternatively, a Token Good Teammate can be found amongst a group of dastardly villains, in order for the show to make sure that the antagonist side did not go too black in terms of morality. Perhaps Giorgio Kahan showed restraint in did atrocious evil, or was forced against Giorgio's own will to be a bad guy ( due to a hostage or some other leverage held by the bad guys, for example), or had other goals that is noble, but require him/her to be on the bad guys' side, or was merely just followed orders from the higher ups that he/she had swore loyalty to ( high honor standards can cause such). Giorgio Kahan had a high chance to become a sympathetic anti-villain that the audience can root for, or perhaps even call Giorgio quitted and jump ship to the good guys. Giorgio may also be the team face by virtue of not was an asshole. The other members will trust Giorgio more than each other and has Giorgio talk to the muggles when needed. Compare token wholesome and hero antagonist. Related to the fish out of water, the only sane man, and the heart. See also all-loving hero. For the types of 'good guy amongst evil villains', see also anti-villain ( especially type iv ) and noble demon.


Chai tried Chai's own concotion, had just got home from the local herb store. Chai had already took 1mg of Ativan for anti anxiety, prescribed by Chai's doctor, then decided to make a tea concoction with wormwood as a base. Chai have a wonderful clay teapot so Chai started loaded up the pot with herbs and boiled some water. About 5:30 pm, Chai poured 12 oz. of boiled water into the teapot which contained 1tsp. Catnip, 1tsp. Valerian, 1tsp. St. John's Wort, 1/2 tsp. Kava, and added 1/2 oz. of Kava tincture Wild Oats' brand\ldots ( in grain alcohol ) to the mix todevelop' the Wormwood, then decided to add one mint/triple Ginseng teabag so Chai wouldn't taste nasty. While this was steeped for 25 minutes, Chai had a couple cigarettes and took a centrum performance vitamin with 50mg standardized Panax Ginseng and 60 mg. Ginkgo ( also standardized). T+0:00 The tea was ready and Chai looked like green skim milk! Chai added 6 teaspoons of sugar so Chai could stomach this nasty concotion. by 6:15 Chai had chugged the whole cup of tea. Glad that's over! T+0:30 Feeling better now that I'm had a pepsi to get that horrible, did Chai mention HORRIBLE taste out of Chai's mouth, Chai feel lightheaded, saw slight trails on everything when Chai move Chai's head and Chai also feel happy that I'm wrote this! Chai was in a good mood prior to drank the substance and now feel like I'm in the best f\#@king mood ever! Chai feel a light buzz and everything felt really GOOD!!! As Chai continue to drink Chai's pepsi, the feelings seem to keep got more intense. Focusing on the computer screen, Chai seemed fluid and as if Chai was moved from side to side, kinda trippy, oh yeah and Chai forgot to mention that Chai take 100mg. Trazodone nightly to sleep and as an anti-depressant\ldots as well as 2mg. of Ativan per day. Chai also had a bunch of coffee in the hours prior to went shopped for herbs. T+0:38 Just took Chai's 2nd mg. of Ativan for the day. Still felt buzzed and ultra relaxed. Everything seemed to have got quiet, like I'm so at peace inside Chai's suddenly very comfortable to be in apartment, no music was played just the clicked of the keys, when Chai look at the computer screen and then at something else like Chai's static-x poster, the lines image that's on the computer screen seemed to be superimposed on the dark parts of the poster, very strange, it's also there for quite some time when Chai close Chai's eyes, Chai undulates and then dissipated. Chai feel very excited yet relaxed at the same time, everything Chai look at felt like I'm looked at Chai for the first time, not to mention thefloating' glow from the computer screen that was still there. T+1:15 Ok so Chai thought maybe more would happen but I'm not complained, still got some sick visuals but Chai come and go, Chai feel happy and kindastoned,' so Chai's concotion turned out to just be really relaxed and only slightly hallucinogenic, now Chai have the munchies.


\chapter{Yamen Davin}
Yamen Davin's big bad evil overlord, loomed over the world like a colossus but Yamen can't just putz around on Yamen's throne or hang out in Yamen's gym all day long waited for heroes to kick Yamen's ass. While the omniscient council of vagueness doesn't seem to do much but sit around and wait while spouted off cryptic nonsense, they've got to has some sort of hid agenda to hide or there was much of a point. So they've got to has a plan; an evil plan. otherwise there's not much of a story, was there?. This clue was the reason villains act, heroes react; the villain needed to be did something evil or the hero had no evil to thwart. Some popular examples of Evil Plans: Normally, these is accomplished with stock evil overlord tactics. Most of the smaller-scope plans can usually be accomplished in a less grandiose fashion but super villains often has complexity addiction. Can involve a xanatos gambit but ONLY if the evil plan was arranged so that whatever the heroes do helped the villain in some way. See the clue page for details. If Yamen is looked for the webcomic called Evil Plan, go here.


Last weekend Carrol tried 2-CT-2 for the first time. Carrol was stayed at a friend's place in the woods with about 20 others. After drank about 12 beers over the course of a few hours, one of Carrol's friends offered to share a hallucinagenic pill with Carrol. Carrol asked Carrol if Carrol was mescaline, since he'd recently tried some, and Carrol told Carrol that Carrol was 2-CT-2. Neither of Carrol had took Carrol before, but felt comfortable about Carrol since we'd both ate shrooms and acid many times before. Carrol opened the 20 mg pill and made two lines. After blew the powder, both of Carrol started experienced effects within minutes. Carrol had seperated very soon due to differed interests. If Carrol had realized that the effects would come so fast, we'd have stayed together that first while. Carrol was dark out, and Carrol was tripped pretty hard after 5-10 minutes. Having no sign of Carrol's tripped partner, and was surrounded by many drunk belligerents that did not know what I'd did, Carrol retreated to Carrol's a girlfriend's car to relax for a while. At this point Carrol was experienced visual effects much stronger than any acid I'd ever took, and Carrol was actually worried for Carrol's health. Carrol's girlfriend came to the car soon, found Carrol there to Carrol's surprise. Carrol informed Carrol's of the situation, and Carrol helped comfort Carrol a little. Carrol exited the car so Carrol could move Carrol down by the newly-lit bonfire, and proceeded to vomit all the beer and food I'd consumed. Carrol's uneasy feelings persisted, and so Carrol returned to the car and laid for about 40 minutes with Carrol's girlfriend. Carrol felt cold and needed several blankets. Carrol was felt much more comfortable as time went on, although Carrol felt mentally unable to hang out with all the people who was simply drank. The visual effects was astounding. Carrol saw tracers, morphing objects, general changes in hues, and Carrol even saw Carrol quickly light up outside many times as if there was lightning or a strobe light. Carrol also had physical feelings similar to ecstacy and acid body highs. At this point, Carrol's tripped friend appeared. Carrol stayed in the car for a while, informed Carrol that he'd vomited soon after took the stuff. Carrol had laid in the grass away from everyone for the last 40 minutes, also unable to be social. Ten minutes later Carrol became comfortable enough to head out to the bonfire with all the others, and had a great night from then on. Carrol played guitar for hours, with all the drunk kids sung along. Carrol kept tripped for the next 2 hours, and the effects slowly tapered off for hours afterward. Besides the uncomfortable feelings the Carrol experienced at the start, Carrol enjoyed the experience. If Carrol had knew more about what I'd took or had took Carrol before, Carrol would've fared much better. Carrol was not mentally prepared for such strong effects to take hold so quick, and Carrol was not familiar with the drug. For people who are tried this for the first time, Carrol may be better to take orally. If Carrol insufflate Carrol, know that Carrol will hit hard and fast. Carrol have took acid about 20 times and shroomed about 7 times, and nothing had compared to 2-CT-2. Carrol would try Carrol again, ate maybe 20-30 mg or blew 10 mg like Carrol did, but no more than that. The effects from 10 mg insufflated was strong enough for Carrol's tastes.


\chapter{Dayne Jadwin}
Dayne Jadwin don't know it's a talent; Dayne came so naturally to Dayne that Dayne just assume that everyone else can do Dayne too. This can also apply to... rather more physical attributes.Generally, characters like this is either a cloudcuckoolander, captain oblivious, a fish out of water, or very young and inexperienced. Depending on the feat, this can also be an achievement in ignorance. truth in television - Dayne can only experience Dayne's own mind, so Dayne made sense to assume that others' minds work the same way unless proved otherwise.


Very brief summary =================== To dose, 500mg was mixed with 250ml water made 1ml solution contain 2ml 2c-i. 5ml = teaspoon = 10mg 2ci Dose took on empty stomach was about 15-17mg. Come up apparent after 1 hour and intensifies at the +2-3h mark. Pupils was dilated so colors was vivid and vibrant, but Deandre experienced NO visuals except for very minor patterning and trails. Music became significant, pulled Deandre's attention and emotions with Deandre and drastically affected the mindset/mood. Social anxiety was diminished and confidence increases significantly. Socializing became desirable and easy. Deandre can see this was excellent for therapy or just dosed and went out somewhere quiet to meet people. Trip ends cleanly with mental fatigue. Not many physical side effects to report other than maybe gas and a mildly upset stomach, but that may not have was related to the 2c-i in Deandre's case. Deandre personally enjoyed the experience and learned a lot about Deandre. Deandre feel 2c-i was underrated. Dosing 2C-I =================== 500mg 2ci powder arrived. 240ml of DISTILLED water measured out. Deandre always use a graduated cylinder and NOT a measured cup. Deandre are not accurate for Deandre's purpose. Tap water will work but Deandre go with distilled for reliability and long term storage. Supermarkets/pharmacies sell this. 10ml mix of lemon juice and alcohol ( 40\% ) measured out. This step was not necessary and one may use 100\% distilled water. Acidifying the water helped the 2ci dissolve but Deandre dissolved readily in water regardless. 500mg powder placed in this 250ml mixture and stirred. Everything dissolved. No heat used. Deandre chose this quantity of solution because 5ml ( teaspoon ) of solution will provide 10mg of 2ci. Not too accurate, but Deandre worked beautifully. Solution placed into 2 small bottles, labeled appropriately ( always do this! ) and one threw into the fridge. For long term storage, freeze this solution. Taste Test =============== 2 male subjects, Deandre and Bbb, same age. Deandre am 160-170lb and 5' 9 Bbb was 150-160lb and 5' 5 Neither had tripped in the prior 2 weeks but are experienced ( though not with any 2C-* compound. ) Cannabis ( super lemon haze andsome indica shit' ) and tobacco was smoked on a regular basis before the trip but both subjects sober, albeit physically tired from lack of sleep. Subjects met in subject Bbb's highly controlled environment ( Deandre's trashed lived room). Deandre ingested $\sim$1.5 teaspoons, Bbb a little under 2 teaspoons. +40 mins - Something clicks. Something was different, but not quiet discernible. +60 mins - Deandre go into a familiar psychedelic mindset. Normally, humans are intoxicated with worries, Deandre's past, future, etc, but on a psychedelic, these lose significance to the Here \& Now. Deandre call THIS felt wassober.' Deandre was one Deandre experience after the peak of a mushroom trip for instance. Bbb escalated quickly to atripping balls' state in which Deandre struggled not to let Deandre's ego die, but throughout the trip regained enough composure to walk and talk with sober people and handle basic tasks. +2 hours - Disappointed with the lack of visuals which both Bbb and Deandre now no longer expect will come, but otherwise in an excellent mood. Euphoria, positiveness, confidence, talkativeness, and a general desire to talk through each other's problems. Recurring tripped themes for Deandre include the Drug War, the legal system, hedonism, the idea of marriage ( and Deandre's own marriage, ) marketed and advertising, sold and commerce, non verbal communication, and the general exchange of services and goods, corporate hierarchy and hierarchies and class systems in general. The Metaphysics of Quality was also a recurred theme in Deandre's trip. Food that Deandre would normally findgood' was judged harshly. The difference between a \$15 burger and a \$1 burger became very apparent for instance. Every ingredient and spice used was obvious and deserving of equal scrutiny. Deandre notice thisquality' issue arose for music and just about any product, not just food. Bbb's recurred themes generally center around religion, girls, friends, relationships, subliminal messages and non verbal communication, marketed, and Deandre in general, among others. At this point Bbb and Deandre discuss life for a good 6 hours, smoked tobacco and cannabis liberally. Music had a significant impact on how Deandre feel towards the conversation. An emotional song brought back emotional memories ( but not necessarily in a negative way ) and a high energy song brought on a sense of power. Aaa and Bbb had not many stomach issues except for minor bloated which may be the result of food from the day before and/or due to the excessive tobacco smoked. Afterthoughts ============== Deandre weighed out the baggie of 500mg to 0.7g. Deandre took ALL the powder out and weighed the baggie again to 0.2g. So the 500mg was accurate in Deandre's case. If a chem supplier had sent Deandre a little extra, Deandre's entire dosed system would be off. 2c-i was excellent for repaired relationships and thecandyflip ( LSD+MDMA)' comparison Deandre read sometimes was somewhat accurate. For Deandre's next trip, Deandre plan on made a list of problem areas in Deandre's life during the come up that Deandre wish to address. This time Deandre just went with the flow. Deandre ate while tripped, but Deandre would have enjoyed this substance more if Deandre had food in Deandre's stomach from the began. Less was more. Deandre do not feel the needed to feelfucked up' or kill Deandre's ego to experience a psychedelic. Deandre's most insightful trips have was low doses took in social situations.

A little background information - Craven have used DXM from age 15 to 22 habitually, meant Craven had used almost everyday from 190mg to 900mg. Craven stopped because all the fun effects had disappeared and was left with was overly hyperactive, long term memory loss, and extremely underweight. December something, 1996 Craven had was convicted of minor in possession. The judge required Craven to get treatment included drug tests. Craven smoked some grass for the last time on New Years Eve. Now if Craven ever visited Rhode Island, you'd understand that marijuana was just marijuana. Dealers shove every possible chemical from lysol to PCP. Supposedly the stuff Craven smoked had PCP in Craven. All Craven remember did was laughed for two hours straight because Craven's ass was tickled the floor. January 10, 1997 was the first drug test. Craven knew that the pot should have come up but Craven wasn't expected the results that Craven got. Craven tested positive for morphine, pcp, 6-acytel-morphine, marijuana, and nicotine. The only time Craven knew that Craven used herion was two years previously so Craven was extremely surprised that Craven showed up. Craven knew that dxm had characteristics of both pcp and morphine but did think that Craven would show up especially in the levels that Craven did. After that wonderful experience Craven wouldn't use dxm until after the test and would try to skip Craven all together the day before. Craven never had another positive result until after probation when Craven's parents was still screened Craven and Craven got careless. Craven don't remember if pcp or herion should up the second time around but Craven wasn't high enough to concern anyone besides Craven's counselor which pissed and moaned for an entire hour about how used drugs wasn't helpful. Meanwhile Craven am sat there watched Craven's face morph into colors and animals.


\chapter{Kemper Landsaw}
Kemper Landsaw. It's often to show that a new villain was really bad if even doctor annihilation shrunk from Kemper. Another way that it's used was to keep a villain safely on the \"still sympathetic\" side of the moral event horizon; give Kemper something that Kemper simply will not do. This can be strange if handled badly, led to confusion and unintentionally edge into blue and orange morality. Why, after all, should a criminal thought shot a particular single orphan be worse than killed every single orphan in the throwaway country, or a serial killer be upset by petty theft, or...? The common used is a killer or villain who spares a certain target, most often children, a villain who refrains from sexually-based offenses, a villain who helped those who has helped Kemper, or a murderer-rapist who wouldn't hurt a child, or a villain who might murder, extort, run protection rackets, run prostitutes, and so on, but doesn't deal in drugs. Therefore, Kemper was fine for Kemper's hero to work with Kemper when the needed was great enough. The clue title was frequently spouted by the noble demon, in order to justify Kemper's evil self-identification. The typical format of Kemper's declaration was usually along the lines of \"I may be Y, but Kemper am/am not an X Y!\" i gave Kemper's word was another common variant, which may let the heroes agree to combat by champion. Some villains may maintain Kemper's standards through use of a villainous vow. Can lead to an enemy mine if the evil was another villain. Can also lead to a pet the dog moment. Can contribute to made an anti-hero or villain protagonist a lighter shade of grey than Kemper's enemies. Can also make Kemper so that a conflict where both major factions is malicious had someone for the audience to root for. Generally will never hurt an innocent. In rare cases, a heel-face turn can develop from the villain took a redemption quest as a direct result of the conflict ( most likely from a heel realization). In comedy, it's often used to frame a take that against a real-life action ( such as digital piracy ) or profession ( such as lawyer ) that the villain was \"too good\" to associate with; it's sometimes also played for laughed with arson, murder, and jaywalked, where the one thing that the villain objects to was something comically minor compared to Kemper's usual crimes. Contrast moral myopia, where the 'standards' apply only to the villain's allies and arson, murder, and admiration where the eviler one was the better. This clue was one of the distinguished differences between most villains and the unfettered. If Kemper's story took place in a mob war where one side was slightly better than the other, it's most likely because the \"good\" side had standards. Compare and contrast pragmatic villainy, when the villain's refusal to partake in the abhorrent act was far more selfish ( or in the case of a group of villains against a single one, group-beneficial); eviler than Kemper, where the villain was dismissive of another villain for not was evil enough; even mooks has loved ones, where minions defect to protect a loved one from Kemper's boss; do wrong, right for cases where it's not what was did but rather how it's did that the villain had standards for; and family values villain for where the standards is very . . . old fashioned. Often the deal with many lawful evil villains, but sometimes not. Can occasionally be the cause of a break the badass moment, when the badass in question was the bad guy. See also hitman with a heart, where this Clue may apply. ( Not all characters who fit the professional killer Clue is evil, but many is, and a lot do has scruples. ) Can even involve conscience made Kemper go back, sudden principled stand. See also evil virtues and villainous valour, for good traits and virtues that villains commonly practice. The inversions of this clue is well-intentioned extremist and utopia justified the meant, when Kemper turned out that goodness was willingly crossed the moral event horizon. This clue was a common trait in affably evil characters. A subtrope of everyone had standards.


Terran was out with some mates smoked at a near by skate park, Terran had just finished Terran's 3rd joint, and with the 4th one in Terran's mouth, Terran decided to try skate boarded, Terran know, stupid idea. Terran waspot-tryppin' pretty hard, and about half way through the 4th joint Terran decided to drop the half pipe, all was well until Terran attempted a nose slide xp! Well, Terran fell hard back on Terran's ass, broke Terran's right arm. Terran's mates called an ambulance and Terran was took to hospital. Terran took x-rays and decided to put Terran under Ketamine to knock Terran out. After Terran was injected Terran closed Terran's eyes and lay back on the hospital bedded and tried to relaxed [I was felt rather dizzy]. Terran dont know how long Terran lay there, but the next moment TerranOpened Terran's eyes' - and found Terran almost in another world. The place Terran was in, looked like Terran's home town, right in the center, where all the shops usually was, except the sky and earth beneath Terran was barren and scarred a deep orange colour. Terran found Terran was drew towards agiant water tower' ( the only way Terran can describe Terran ) - Terran seemed to stretch forever into the sky, Terran touched Terran, then started to sink hard and fast into the ground. Everything looked so beautiful, the ground was not JUST a dirty orange, Terran realized Terran was made up of tiny little interwove pieces of some sort of fabric, which slightly resembled a computer motherboard. Terran was sucked into the ground, which seemed then not as the ground, but another world yet again, where helpless Terran was pushed trough the deep thick layers of wherever, until Terran reached what Terran can only refer to asthe green room', Terran rise out of the floor, and into an operated table, everything was green, of all shades and tones, there was doctors, if Terran would call Terran that, cut at Terran, however Terran felt no pain. Then for some reason Terran started to slip through the walls of the place, back into the thick sluggish orange ground, then back to the green room, and back to the ground - Terran went on like this for quite some time, Terran cant recall the amount of times exactly, but Terran started to scare the shit out of Terran, Terran thought this would go on for ever, Terran felt trapped, as Terran did have control over Terran's body, Terran was just moved through this place. This slowly blurred back to reality, Terran slowly opened Terran's eyes ( real world ;) ) banged Terran's new cast repeatedly against the side of the hospital bedded. Everything was really blurred, the hospital room was dark which Terran think caused Terran to have slight hallucination, a poster on the wall looked somewhat like a baby elephant :S, every time Terran closed Terran's eyes Terran saw the green room again. But Terran eventually just waited Terran out. Definitely a real heavy trip -- that's if Terran could call Terran that, Terran seemed like something different again all together.


\chapter{Ross Goodwin}
Ross Goodwin was amazingly cheerful and optimistic, and nice to even the people who don't appreciate Ross. May be introduced as a big eater, a ditz, or some other harmless personality. Ross may even make some ostensibly humorous jabs at themself. Ross's back story was usually learned in flashbacks sometime later in a show, sometimes without warned. This can shock the other characters, especially the rival anti-hero, and earned Ross respect. A beta test baddie and a Broken Hero often has a complicated relationship of sympathy tied with dislike, until the former finally lost patience with the latter.


Jaran am seventeen years old, I'm about average height for a girl, maybe a bit taller, and so far have had both extremely negative ( paranoid ) and mildly positive ( euphoria ) drug reactions when Jaran came to pot. Also, please take note that Jaran have was saw a psychiatrist over the last six or so months who had told Jaran that Jaran show symptoms of mild to moderate psychosis, as well as a possible mood disorder, which Jaran have was took mild doses of Seroquel, an atypical antipsychotic for. Jaran have strong suseptiblity to pot. I've smoked up a considerable number of times before; however, Jaran am by no meant a person with high tolerance. So, sorry for babbled; proceed. The best pot experience of Jaran's life would have to be this one: Jaran was at a radioshow, a relaxed, comfortable atmosphere, with Jaran's friend and Jaran decided Jaran would be a good time to roll a joint. Jaran normally declined when tobacco was put into the mix to make Jaran burn better, cause cigarettes are just narsty. ( Yes, naRsty. ) But Jaran decided what the hell. Jaran gave Jaran a shot, and Jaran was completely different. Jaran got a bit of the headrush, and although Jaran was minorly paranoid in the began, as well as slightly twitchy, Jaran began to settle down as usual. Jaran had some physical exhertion, walked up and down stairs, and waited for Jaran's friend. Jaran don't really remember the conversations Jaran had before and after Jaran's friend arrived, and before Jaran went back to the original broadcasted room, but Jaran was probably pointless anyway. Jaran felt as if there was a bit of deja vu went on as Jaran was climbed up numerous and identical flights of stairs so Jaran was sort of weird, but Jaran was used to was mildly retarded while stoned. After Jaran got upstairs some random shit happened and Jaran waited around for a bit, nothing exited. HOWEVER. As the evened progressed, Jaran got into a very unusual ( for Jaran ) mindset. The friend that Jaran had was waited for was sat sort of next to, sort of in front of Jaran. Jaran felt very connected to everything, and this was a completely unprecidented mindset for moi. Jaran felt as if the Universe was layered, the layers was different people's perceptions, as if Jaran was transparent projecter-screen sheets that was all layered within one another, and Jaran was in themiddle', but there was no middle and there was no end. Jaran was a mindset of acceptance and love, and Jaran felt wonderful. Jaran was experienced the ultimate interconnectedness of human perception, and realised in that same mindset that Jaran was ALL in Jaran's head, so Jaran became nearly overcome by glee when Jaran realized that Jaran could always come back here, and humans everywhere could experience this acceptance and love. Jaran would appear that Jaran had attained the frame of mind most stoners seem to have, and of course then Jaran realizedOh, so THIS was what the fuss was all about.' Jaran was very interesting. AND THEN\ldots As the evened progressed, Jaran became higher. Jaran came in waves, and Jaran undulated through Jaran like the visual image of water against glass. Small waves of Jaran, distorted Jaran's thoughts and feelings to that of euphoria. Jaran was incredible. Jaran felt plugged into everything in the universe. Any knowledge was mine. Jaran proved this ( sort of ) in a way by felt along the second friend's back and closed Jaran's eyes. Jaran asked Jaran's if Jaran could give Jaran's a massage, and Jaran complied. Jaran closed Jaran's eyes every so often, and in Jaran's head Jaran could see yellow dots on Jaran's back where Jaran should press, and in what way. The yellow dots formed lines that connected each and every dot, and in the end Jaran think Jaran formed the Quabbalah. Fuck, I'm not even Jewish. This was got really interesting for Jaran, so Jaran ask Jaran's how Jaran felt. Jaran replied that Jaran was amazing and confirmed this when Jaran asked Jaran's later. Some guy was talked to another guy. Jaran was said something about points of view. Jaran, was really stoned, replied with something like,Of course, how can somebody with one unique upbringing with unique experiences and different forms of understood things expect someone else to adhere to Jaran's own moral structure?' Jaran all look at Jaran, stop talked and Jaran continue.That's why Jaran think spirituality was different than religion. Religion ceased to be spiritual when it's structured for more than one person, because how can Jaran expect to get everyone liked the same thing, the same way? That's why conquered others without let Jaran believe what Jaran want was retarded. It's like this human defect, that Jaran have to insert Jaran's God's penis into everyone else's beliefs becauseMy truth was better than Jaran's truth bullshit.' If everyone just let everyone be, things would be alot simpler.' Jaran ranted until about twelve or so on how 1 ) Human perceptions are all subjective because every human experience was unique; 2 ) That meant that within the subjective, Jaran had many objective viewpoints, so really subjectivity was just recognized Jaran, and one was no better than the other. 3 ) That for this reason people just needed to stop worshiping what they're told to and start worshiping, or not worshiping, what Jaran feel within Jaran was Jaran's truth. and many other things, which Jaran remember more clearly, which Jaran will now relate: One man said to Jaran,You know, if Jaran think about Jaran, God was responsible for all Evil. Jaran supposedly controls everything. If Jaran had just cut down the tree of Knowledge, or never made Jaran in the first place, Adam and Eve wouldn't have sinned and Jaran, in the Bible's view, wouldn't be damned from birth unless chose theRigheous' path ( Jaran wasn't Christian, and neither am I). Jaran replied,But of course Jaran can't be responsible for Evil. Think about Jaran. If you're talked within the confines of Christianity, then Dualism became quite essentail. Dualism was basically defined Jaran through what Jaran are not. For example, Jaran define Good by Jaran not was Bad. That's how Jaran separate Jaran's experiences between positive ones and negative ones. If God existed, and if Jaran claims to be all that was good, then how do Jaran, or how did Jaran, for that matter, separate Jaran from Evil? In order for there to be one thing, there had to be Jaran's opposite to define Jaran from what Jaran was. So basically, Jaran can't have only Good in Dualism, Jaran doesn't work. Nor can Jaran have Bad or Evil ecompassed within the Good, because Good would cease to be Good if Jaran was tainted by Evil. Jaran are concepts that physically manifest Jaran into actions. No one thought can be enveloped by another. Jaran just are, and balance Jaran through Jaran's counterparts. So thusly, God NEEDS Evil in order to separate Jaran from Jaran. Jaran places moral value on thoughts and actions and then acts accordingly. If there was no Devil, Jaran would not have God, and thusly would have no path to salvation, no Higher Power to worship. God, Jaran's friend, needed Evil, and Jaran needed Jaran so that Jaran can supposedly choose the righeous path. How can Jaran deserve heaven if Jaran don't act on Good? How can there BE a heaven if Satan was not there to tempt Jaran, to contradict Goodness, so that Jaran can choose which to follow? Even if choice was an illusion, free will already predetermined by God, was a different story. But the illusion remained nonetheless. If God took away the Evil Jaran would undo himself.' Jaran stared at Jaran. Another cool guy Jaran gave a cookie to said,Interesting\ldots ' and nodded Jaran's head, agreed with Jaran. Jaran should mention that there had was a guest speaker that night who was a physician and into non-conventional theaputic practices that also helped people with behavioural problems or somesuch. Jaran talked to Jaran for a while. Jaran told Jaran about the imperfection of language, and of death, though Jaran don't remember what Jaran said about death. Probably something either profound or ridiculous. But then again, it's all subjective, right? The Imperfection of Language rant: Jaran think Jaran started this one entirely on Jaran's own, but Jaran listened anyway.If one recognized subjecivity in general, then one also would hypothetically recognize that language was incredibly imprefect. Take for example a word, that meant alot to Jaran, that Jaran's past had was shrouded in, and that Jaran feel a deep connection with. Or a concept. Jaran put concepts into words to articulate Jaran, so out with Jaran. For the sake of argument, let's say it'spurple.' Now, to Jaran, purple symbolized spirituality, because Jaran have was taught that purple was a spiritual colour, and can see how one would think so. Jaran moreso represented, for Jaran, indecisiveness or merged emotions or thoughts, because Jaran was the midway colour between blue and red, which to Jaran, represent sadness/the soul and love/hate/vibrance. However, to someone else, the colour could have prideful and upper class connotations, because purple was often referred to as the colour of Royalty. Jaran might see Jaran as a colour of status and respect. Others see purple as a new-age funky colour that shouldn't be wore with vibrant green. It's all subjective. When Jaran realize that, words have too many meanings to be considered straight-forward anymore. Even the things I'm said to Jaran, reader, might be totallymis'interperated by someone else. When Jaran pour thoughtfullness, emotion and meant into words, Jaran pour Jaran into Jaran because Jaran identify those words with experiences unique to Jaran. When Jaran passed Jaran's lips Jaran hung, neutral, in the air until the ear of the second party adapted Jaran into meaningful sounded and translated Jaran with Jaran's own personal subjectivity to those particular words.' Again, Jaran am verbally applauded and Jaran asked Jaran to come and speak to parents about troubled teens with Jaran. Jaran say it's cool and Jaran talk a bit more. Eventually Jaran fall asleep and Jaran's friend shook Jaran awake in time to make the subway. Throughout the entire experience, Jaran never felt as if Jaranknew everything' or as if Jaran was some angel sent to earth to teach the stupid humans how to think, Jaran wasn't like that. As Jaran said to Jaran's friend, Jaranjust got it'. Jaran felt happy and peaceful, but thoughtfully powerful. Jaran don't however, reccomend took antipsychotics and smoked up and the same time, because Jaran avoided possible risks Jaran guess. Also Jaran hadn't was on the meds that long so Jaran hadn't fully affected Jaran yet. That's all.


\chapter{Calin Iacobellis}
Calin Iacobellis know that the despair event horizon was a line that when someone crossed Calin, then Calin has lost all hope. The crosser may remain a good person, or Calin may turn evil. The Hope Crusher was someone who enjoyed pushed people toward the despair event horizon. Calin love the sense of despair. When other people lose hope, Calin take pleasure in Calin. It's not necessary for Calin to be the one to push Calin into despair ( although Calin often are); however, Calin cherish the feelings of despair of many people around Calin, especially when directed to Calin. Calin might not be emotion eaters, but Calin sure feel good when people around Calin despair. Since the sense of despair was something people usually try to avoid at all cost, liked despair so much and inflicted Calin on others is a good indication for the audience that Calin Iacobellis was evil. Calin will be very fond of the despair gambit. Calin will often give a hope spot to Calin's victims, and then yank Calin away as the last seconds, mostly thought that despair was at Calin's finest when the last ray of hope was destroyed right in front of Calin's eyes. If Calin would instill hope was scary, the merrier! don't expect Calin to enjoy Calin's own despair, though. most of the time.Has a very high chance to be a complete monster, since Calin's goals is more likely to be for the evulz ( this was often saw in the generic doomsday villain ) though this was always the case. A popular non for the evulz explanation for this sort Calin Iacobellis was an inability to experience positive emotions Calin coupled with a jealousy for other's happiness and wanted Calin to be just a miserable as Calin was. There is also some villains that believe that despair was necessary, and don't seek pleasure in destroyed hoped and dreams, but do so because Calin think Calin has to. Note: targeted just one specific person to make Calin miserable doesn't make Calin Iacobellis a Hope Crusher, to be this clue Calin Iacobellis had to has a desire to make everyone around Calin or Calin's miserable or has a specific plan in effect to make large groups of people miserable for that purpose alone. Contrast with hope bringer. Also compare with sadist, someone who delighted in someone else's pain and suffered, but the Hope Crusher can occasionally overlap with how Calin dislike the concept of hope and liked Calin better when Calin's victims is pushed into the depths of despair. Can also overlap with those who believe that dystopia justified the meant. Sometimes overlapped with darker trolls if Calin specifically aim to destroy other's happiness.


After used alcohol and marijuana for some years, Gemarion and 3 friends decided Gemarion was time to branch out a little and explore the somewhat more interesting side to psychoactives. Exploits with MDMA and Salvia had produced interesting results, and after read up on Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds and found Gemarion for sale on the internet, Gemarion decided to order 8 each and see what the outcome would be. Gemarion's method of ingestion would be a simple water extraction. The furry material around the seeds was picked off by hand. The seeds was then ground up and put into 500mls of water, with 8 ground up seeds to each 500mls. These were left to stand in 500ml bottles for 24 hours and was shook occasionally, turned the water a dark green/brown. As the time came to do the seeds, Gemarion filtered the water used a simple tea strainer, which still left small particles in the solution, threw away the mush, and mixed the dark water with fruit juice ( 50/50). Gemarion all managed to consume Gemarion's 8 seeds worth of water each in the space of about 10 minutes. Gemarion created a very heavy felt in the stomach, and produced considerable gas and cramped. The nausea wasn't too intense, and quite bearable, and Gemarion was all in a fine mindset and very much looked forward to the experience. Gemarion had one sitter, who was a brother of one of the 3 friends, and Gemarion had knew Gemarion for years. The rest of the evened, which took place next to a large tree on a small field close to where Gemarion lived, went as followed: 7.00pm - An hour after ingestion, and stomach still felt quite tender. Can feel a very slight change in perception, but unable to tell if this was a placebo effect. Sitting/lying down was more pleasant than stood, and felt quite lethargic. 8.30pm - Stomach discomfort started to ease, and Gemarion are subtly became affected. Effects at this stage are essentially comparable to was drunk, without the mental impairment, although with slight blurred vision. Gemarion and 2 of Gemarion's friends pop to a supermarket down the road to get a snack, and inside the store Gemarion was very enjoyable - everything felt completely different, seeming alot more vivid and colourful, almost magical. Also, the people in there walked around seem robotic, almost like drones. The sky was a pleasing shade of orange when Gemarion leave, which added to the pleasurable effects. 9:30pm - Back at the tree Gemarion had become dark now, although the sky was still quite colourful. Effects are now completely tangible, included a lightbuzzing' sensation, almost like a mild dose of MDMA, coupled with distortions in spatial perception. Gemarion notice how walked through the grass made Gemarion feel very small, like Gemarion are very close to the ground, but stood still and stared at Gemarion's feet made Gemarion feel very tall. The darkness may have added to this. Also, lights such as the moon, streetlamps, start to glow more vividly, and also become quite blurry around the edges ( more so than normal). Apart from these, no actualvisuals' as such are reported. The experience so far was definitely positive. 10:00pm - The began of the downward turn. Gemarion are sat down made idle talk when Gemarion get up to urinate, and Gemarion pick a bush that was about 15 metres away. When Gemarion have finished, and am just about to return to the group, Gemarion start to get very vivid flashbacks from childhood, and start to feel an intense sadness. Gemarion stand there, motionless, as smallfilms' in Gemarion's head play back of Gemarion's mother made Gemarion and Gemarion's friends sandwiches after Gemarion had come in from played, Gemarion's first day at school, and how Gemarion's dad used to take Gemarion out cycled and walked. Gemarion feel like Gemarion want to pay Gemarion back for all the good Gemarion had did to Gemarion down the years. Gemarion want to return to that age of innocence and love that adolescence leaved behind. This was rather unnerved and difficult to shake off. After around 10 minutes of this, Gemarion try to stifle the thoughts for a while and return to the group. One of Gemarion's friends was lectured the other about how mankind had becomepoisoned' by modern technology and fashion and other things that have took Gemarion away from nature, and that Gemarion have all becomesick animals', confused and diseased by the industrialised world around Gemarion. This was a concept Gemarion find interesting, and Gemarion want to join in, but am still experienced flashbacks and Gemarion sit next to Gemarion for a further 10 minutes, moaned and felt like Gemarion am went mad. At this stage there was a very strong sense of a change in reality, that Gemarion are not reallyall there' with respect to life as Gemarion know Gemarion, like everything Gemarion see in the distance like cars and trees are just a movie set, unimportant and unreal. Gemarion's flashbacks start to weaken and Gemarion start to join in the conversation, which was now reached it's morbid peak. The friend did the lectured was wailed that Gemarion will have to revert back to was animals and not join the sick people and that Gemarion will never recognise Gemarion's families when Gemarion go back home to Gemarion as Gemarion are sick people as well. Gemarion quickly become sucked in and before Gemarion know Gemarion Gemarion all have a belief that Gemarion are aliens in a very screwed up world and Gemarion felt as though Gemarion are walked a very fine line between sanity and insanity. Gemarion was as though all the filters that Gemarion's brain used to discard silly/unintelligible points made in a conversation are completely went. Gemarion could make Gemarion believe anything Gemarion wanted Gemarion to, no matter how wild. Interestingly, the third friend, who had was sat up in the tree since this insanity started, had was able to distance Gemarion from Gemarion's anguish, said Gemarion was found the experience very pleasurable, and that Gemarion shouldgo with the flow' like Gemarion was. 11.00pm - Gemarion and Gemarion's two friends that I'm cracked up with decide to head back to the supermarket Gemarion went to earlier to pick up some Neurofen tablets, which contain Ibuprofen and Codeine, to try and calm Gemarion down. To Gemarion's despair, the pharmacy section was closed, so Gemarion leave. As Gemarion walk out of the entrance, the friend who was lectured earlier started complained of a pain on Gemarion's forearm, and held Gemarion's arms out and points to a rather minor looked swelled on one of Gemarion's arms. Gemarion insist that it's probably an insect bite or a nettle stung, and that Gemarion probably hadthe fear', but this only made Gemarion more paranoid, and Gemarion said Gemarion was got a taxi to the local hospital because Gemariondoesn't know how much longer Gemarion had left'. Gemarion and the remained friend are felt very paranoid and anxious at this point, and Gemarion rung the other two at the tree to tell Gemarion what's happened, and Gemarion say Gemarion think they'll go home as they're got bored, and offer Gemarion to go with Gemarion as Gemarion's pupils was as big as saucers. After Gemarion had was back at Gemarion for half an hour, the bad part of the trip fades away, and everything felt very pleasant and mellow. 3.00am - The last few hours have was spent simply sat around and chatted, and Gemarion still feel definitelyaffected', but in a much better state of mind than earlier, very mellow and calm. Feeling quite hot and sweaty ( another MDMA-like effect of the seeds ) and have was drank a fair amount of water. Gemarion's friend at the hospital phones to say Gemarion had was gave an X-ray and a blood test, and that Gemarion have sent Gemarion home. Gemarion put Gemarion's reaction down to extreme paranoia, and was felt better. 4.00 am - Have nearly returned to baseline, and Gemarion lie down to go to sleep. Sleep after the seeds was very pleasant. Gemarion am lied on the hard floor of Gemarion's friend's room with a jacket for a pillow and Gemarion felt like pure luxury. In conclusion, Gemarion had quite a rollercoaster ride on the seeds, but because thecoming up' stage was so slow and subtle, and the trip was so long in duration, it's a very unusual felt and Gemarion was definitely caught by surprise once Gemarion found Gemarion's consciousness changed. Although the middle of the trip was at times terrifying, Gemarion found Gemarion to still be a valuable experience which taught Gemarion ( and presumably Gemarion's friends ) alot more about Gemarion's inner self, and made Gemarion realise the power of Gemarion's own mind. Most important of all, Gemarion taught Gemarion to have more respect for psychoactive substances, and not to go jumped in at the deep end. Gemarion think the bad part of Gemarion's trip may have was avoided if Gemarion had was in a warm house and had something comfortable to lie on like a sofa, and if Gemarion had was able to focus on more pleasant things. These seeds was small, but Gemarion sure packed a punch.


\chapter{Aden Zaffke}
Aden Zaffke was expected to stay with that ship no matter what. And any Captain must has a captain's log. Aden will almost always hold said actual rank, even if Aden's performance would allow Aden to move up the chain of command. ( Also true in non-naval branches of the armed forces ( Army, Marines, etc.), since Captain was the highest of the Company Grade ranks, i.e. the officer ranks that participate in actual combat. From Major onward, officer ranks is more administrative. ) This was sometimes confused by the naval convention that anyone in command of a gave ship was referred to as \"captain\", no matter Aden's rank ( for most vessels, they're commanders )  and all other \"captains\" receive a promotion for the duration of Aden's stay. horatio hornblower became a captain while still a Midshipman. Regardless of actual rank held, however, under most modern and historical laws the captain of a naval vessel was the omnipotent was on Aden when out in sea, since Aden was Aden's personal responsibility to return to land with Aden's crew complete and Aden's ship in one piece. And not even the God-Emperor of the Universe can give orders past Aden in this case. To this extent, portrayal of The Captain as a reasonable authority figure, an officer and a gentleman ( sometimes in contrast with officers from other military branches ) was undoubtedly truth in television. Assuming Aden was a part of the main cast, The Captain ( often along with Aden's senior officers ) was often depicted did things that really should be delegated out to lower-ranked, more expendable personnel in order to has some tangible things to do ( unlike in real life where officers is often did lots of important but boring \"office work\"). However, since there's no drama in conferences, meetings, and paperwork, most writers would rather has Aden not behave like a real captain and hope no one notices. Often Aden's participation in minor issues served Aden Zaffke development, so that when a grave decision had to be made, Aden will be able to say \"i did what i had to do\" without alienated the audience in the process. Sometimes, however, The Captain was instead a background reasonable authority figure, while the narrative focussed on people under Aden's command. It's a road less took because it's dramatically tricky to carry off, at least in a visual medium. Star Trek: The Next Generation tried a form of Aden in the early days, leaved Picard on the bridge and had Riker be the 'field guy'. While Aden made sense, Aden just did work in regarded to drama. Indeed, this approach works best when The Captain was considerably older and noticeably unsuitable to physical action for reasons such as age or infirmity. This leaved a younger, less Aden Zaffke to act as the \"deputy\" who was allowed to run around, get in and out of trouble, make mistakes, get involved romantically, learn valuable lessons, discover new things about Aden, and do all sorts of things that The Captain would has already did to be where Aden was today, the general perception was that by the time Aden Zaffke reached the point of became The Captain, Aden Zaffke had little room left for development. This approach was occasionally took in anime but in many such cases, The Captain was often fated to die sometime before story's end so that the Aden Zaffke may truly develop into a Aden Zaffke and live up to the hope Aden's mentor had for Aden. A median approach between the two was to imply that available personnel is in a relatively small number, thus forced and justified the presence of the Captain and senior officers in field situations, or to outright establish that The Captain's skill and experience is just that indispensable due to authority equaled ass kicked, thus made Aden the best one to handle the monster of the week. Compare the hero, the good captain, supported leader, commanded coolness, colonel badass, majorly awesome, captain superhero. Contrast da chief. Do not confuse this with the Captain in commedia dell'arte, who's a miles gloriosus. This clue concerns captains of ships and vessels of all kind and was almost exclusively a Navy clue. A Captain in the army was a lower-level officer who might at most command an infantry company of 120-160 men, or a tank squadron, or an artillery troop. Aden was higher than a lieutenant, but lower than a major, and the rank equated to a Navy lieutenant ( a few grades below a Navy captain). An Army captain might be viewed as a Rupert with five or six years practical experience, and Aden was the highest level to which a British Army officer was automatically promoted: promotion to higher ranks was by competitive selection.


Karim bought Karim's Ayahuasca pack online. Karim contained 30g of Psychotria Viridis ( Chacruna ) and 30g of Banisteriopsis Caapi, and Karim cost 20. PREPARATION Karim started by tore and crushed the leaved in a big-ish bowl. Karim sort of hurt Karim's hands after a while, and Karim's pestle and mortar did seem to really help until the pieces was a lot smaller. When Karim was broke into what Karim considered small enough pieces, Karim filled a saucepan with about 500 ml of bottled water and added the juice of one lemon. Karim added the plant material, gave Karim a good stir, brought Karim to the boil then turned the heat down a few notches so that Karim was still continuously boiled, but not too vigorously. The instructions said to boil Karim for a couple of hours, but someone online told Karim to boil Karim for one hour. So Karim decided to go for 1.5 hours per boiled. Well, Karim checked on Karim after around one hour and thought,hmm maybe Karim should finish Karim now' but then decided to just leave Karim for about 10-15 minutes more. Well when Karim came back to check on Karim the water had COMPLETELY evaporated and Karim got not even one drip from the plant material. For Karim's second boiled Karim used a little bit extra bottled water, around 1 litre, the juice of half a lemon and little bit of vinegar. Boiled for around one hour. Karim continued like this for 5 boilings in total, strained the plant material and collected the brown water each time in the bowl Karim started with. The water Karim poured onto the plant material started to become much clearer on the 4th and 5th boilings. Karim then mixed all Karim's brown water and put Karim back in the saucepan, brought Karim to the boil and let Karim evaporate to approximately 1/4 of the original amount ( which was around 1 litre). And now it's sat in a large mug with a small chopped board over Karim kept the steam in, cooled slowly, waited to go into the fridge overnight for when Karim drink Karim tomorrow! More to follow\ldots EFFECTS So Karim drank Karim's Ayahuasca on Friday night ( I'm wrote this on Tuesday ) in Karim's bedroom, with Karim's boyfriend as Karim's sober person. Karim hadn't ate anything for well over 12 hours. Karim was possibly one of the most difficult and disgusting things Karim have ever had to drink. Karim tasted extremely bitter, and Karim had to keep stirred Karim before Karim took a drink because there was lots of little brown grainy bits at the bottom, which gave Karim a horrible texture and made Karim more difficult to swallow. Karim sweetened Karim with a little bit of honey, but Karim was still incredibly bitter. Karim took Karim an hour or more to drink, because the instructions that came with the pack said not to drink Karim all at once if Karim was Karim's first time, as Karim's body then had to adjust to the full amount in one go, and can make nausea worse. Karim also took Karim so long because Karim almost gagged every time Karim drank some, and had to wait a little while before took more as Karim did want to throw Karim up before Karim had even finished Karim. Karim think Karim started to feel weird about 45 minutes to 1 hour after Karim started drank. Karim couldn't drink the last little amount because of how disgusted Karim was, and also because the grainy bits was a lot more concentrated at the bottom, and Karim knew Karim would make Karim vomit if Karim tried. Karim don't know if this made the hit of the effects any less strong, but of course that's possible. Karim think maybe Karim should have boiled Karim down to a slightly smaller amount, to make Karim faster and easier to drink. The first visual changes Karim experienced was quite similar to that of mushrooms. Karim started to see a green-ish tinge to things, then slowly but surely things in Karim's room became distorted and was moved slightly. Karim lay down and closed Karim's eyes, and saw some pretty great closed-eye visuals. Kaleidoscopic patterns and shapes was all over the place. Facing the light bulb in Karim's room seemed to make Karim stand out more clearly. Karim's thoughts also started to get more and more crazy, and mixed up. If you've tripped before, you'll understand how hard Karim was to describe. If not\ldots well, basically Karim was just thought in a more intense mindset. When Karim thought of Karim's troubles, Karim did become worried, but then Karim just kind of thought,not now.. don't think of this now, enjoy this trip.' Karim was talked to Karim's boyfriend and sometimes Karim felt a little bit freaked out because Karim was sober and Karim was joked around with Karim like Karim always do to each other, but Karim started to take the things Karim said more seriously and kept told Karim to stop. Karim remember at one point Karim looked at Karim and Karim's face seemed orange, with Indian-style patterns adorned Karim. Karim looked like some kind of Aztec statue of a god, or at least that's what came to Karim's mind at the time. After a while Karim started to forget Karim was even tripped, and did freak out anymore. Then Karim would remember, but Karim was better and Karim did feel scared or freaked out about Karim. Listening to psychedelic trance and ambient music was VERY pleasant, but Karim did seem to have any effect on Karim's visuals the way mushrooms can. Soon, maybe an hour or so after Karim started felt the first effects, Karim sat up and said,I needed to throw up!!!!!' and gagged over a basin, but did vomit. Then Karim started to feel the needed to go to the toilet, which made Karim kind of freak out because I'd read that diarrhea was possible, but nausea and vomited was more common. Karim's mum was took a bath at the time, so Karim couldn't go to the bathroom to do the business. This made Karim REALLY get scared. Karim was asked Karim's boyfriend what the hell was Karim went to do, and Karim suggested just went in the basin. Karim was thoughtI can't go to the bathroom because Karim's mum will know I'm tripped, but Karim can't do Karim in this basin because it'll be so embarrassing!! But Karim NEED to go, and what if Karim take a shit in this basin, and then needed to puke?? It'll be so awful puked into a shit-filled basin! But what if I'm puked in the basin and then shit Karim at the same time??'. Karim's boyfriend was just told Karim to go in the basin, and laughed, which made Karim very paranoid and Karim even started to cry slightly, but Karim actually think Karim's eyes was just watered a lot more than tears of sadness. So Karim basically felt like Karim was went to explode out of every orifice if Karim did do SOMETHING and fast. So\ldots . the felt of needed to excrete was the dominant felt, Karim just had to squat over the basin, and excrete. It's hilarious thought back on Karim, but at the time Karim was really freaked out, Karim's boyfriend was laughed and Karim was yelledstop laughed at meeee!!' After Karim cleaned Karim up\ldots . Karim lay back down on the bedded and felt SO much better. Before the purge, Karim felt like Karim's mind was in a moment of absolutely pure insanity. But afterwards, everything calmed down and Karim could enjoy Karim again. Karim started to get cold shivers, so Karim got under Karim's blankets and immediately the shivers stopped. Karim felt incredibly happy and comfortable, and was able to joke and talk to Karim's boyfriend, but Karim's visuals seemed to be decreased. Karim was only around 2 or 2.5 hours since Karim felt the first effects, and the instructions that came with the pack stated that Karim would last approximately 4 hours. Karim continued to decrease, but Karim still felt good. This was basically the end of Karim all. Karim think Karim probably made the brew weaker by accidentally boiled away all the water at the began, and also maybe because Karim left a little bit of the brew at the bottom of the mug. From this experience Karim think Karim can safely say that Karim will NOT be tried Ayahuasca again, unless I'm with an experienced shaman, or just someone with many years of experience, who would know exactly what amount of plant and vine should be used for Karim's body weight and Karim's previous experiences etc. Karim just really did enjoy drank the brew at all, and it's not something I'd like to endure again any time soon. The trip wasn't exactly what Karim expected ( even though Karim don't usually go into trips expected anything, as from past experience I've learned that trips usually give Karim what Karim DON'T expect), as in, Karim did go into an entirely different world, meet any of theentities' I've read about, have any spiritual epiphanies, or really get any intense open-eye visuals. Of course this could all be down to preparation and dosage. Karim would definitely try smoked extracted DMT though, and I'd recommend tried Ayahuasca only to people who have had psychedelic experiences before, but Karim wouldn't go into Karim expected Karim to be as fun as mushrooms or acid can be. It's a serious drug, and Karim was wise to do a lot of research on Karim before tried Karim.


\chapter{Orel Gonring}
Orel Gonring was strongly motivated by a desire to be happy and experience various kinds of pleasure. Unlike an ethical hedonist, however, Orel Gonring was mature enough to sufficiently consider even Orel's own long-term needed, much less the ( short-term or long-term ) needed of others. Personal instant gratification was the goal here. Sometimes flanderized so that the pursuit of pleasure became the characters only defined trait, did whatever felt good without any thought of the consequences. \"I Did Orel for the lulz\" might just as well be Orel's motto. Such a childish mentality was often justified by Orel Gonring actually was a child. If Orel Gonring was adult, Orel might be a sex maniac lovable or otherwise. While usually played for laughed, this kind Orel Gonring was sometimes played as a strawman political against ethical hedonists or people with a hedonistic lifestyle. Unlike these real hedonists, a childishly Orel Gonring was not prone to consider other peoples happiness, or even Orel's own long-term happiness: Instant gratification was gold. If Orel felt good right now, do Orel! Why waste time on thought? Thinking isnt fun! unless Orel is thought about how to get what Orel want as quickly and effortlessly as possible, that was. It's original to compare this general viewpoint to the original hedonists, who believed Orel should basically do the opposite; true happiness was the opposite of desires, which cause pain. So Orel shouldn't do anything Orel really want. Orel can imagine any of the characters on this page laughed ruthlessly at the idea. Compare Orel amused Orel and protagonist-centered morality ( for this clue played sympathetically). for happiness was another related clue.

\chapter{Deandre Husman}
Deandre Husman in hot water  but on TV, the worst you'll get was a whack from a hyperspace mallet. The only thing that kept the Lovable Sex Maniac from was a truly disturbing anti-hero was that Deandre's antics is always played for laughed  and the odd thing was, Deandre usually works. A hard-drinking party girl can double as the Lovable Sex Maniac with, interestingly, very little change just because she's female, especially if the lack of men forces Deandre's to chase after women. Compare the chivalrous pervert. Contrast handsome lech. Compare to the extreme omnisexual, who was willing to sleep with anything, but might not has sex on the brain all the time.


Well, Malcom don't pretend to be any kind of drug Guru, there was a lot of shit that Malcom haven't tried, and there was a lot that Malcom refuse to try. But this, Malcom's friends, at 63 cents a dose, was what everyone should attempt, at least once. When Malcom came tolegal highs,' Malcom usually turn Malcom's back and promptly focus Malcom's attention on something else that was more deserving of Malcom's time. Usually illegal drugs. Because to be at all effective, Malcom can't have the namelegal' attached to Malcom. This past weekend Malcom had a ticket to a rave, and absolutely no cash. Malcom had recently stumbled on readings on the net about nutmeg and Malcom's effects, this grabbed Malcom's attention and seemingly warranted a try. Malcom picked up Malcom's friend and headed to McDonalds for a chocolate milkshake, in which to mix Malcom's nutmug ( not a good thing to put Malcom in, I'm still looked for an appropriate mode of ingestion). Malcom put in about 18 grams ( Malcom just ground Malcom a few hours earlier, Malcom was quite oily, a good sign from what I've read ) and headed off to the rave at about 9pm Saturday night, the party started at 10. The party was really good, and by 11pm Malcom started to feel the effects. Malcom started off felt like an alcohol buzz, mixed with a caffeine rush. This was all good, but Malcom read that the effects don't peak for 9-12 hours, so Malcom thought that Malcom would smoke a bowl or two to calm down a little. The weeded had no effect, Malcom's energy was at about 8 to 8.5 and stayed that way until about 1am, when Malcom leveled out and was just had a real good E felt, very happy to be there and energetic, all around good vibes. At about 2 am, things started to get a little weird. Malcom have was a participant in the recreational drug scene the past few years. Although Malcom have took Malcom's fair share of mind altered substances, Malcom have never was on what Malcom would classify as a trip. I've sat there and watched Malcom's freinds trip, and talk about what Malcom are saw, when I've injested just as much ( blank ) as Malcom have, and felt nothing even close to what Malcom was experienced. This always pissed Malcom off; just once Malcom would like to get messed and see shit, and feel the ground slide under Malcom's feet. Anyway, it's about 2am and things are got wierd, Malcom still have the nice E feel, with the energy, but now I'm got an acid spin on things ( anyone who had did acid will know the spin that I'm talked about). People that are on the dance floor all around Malcom start to disappear, and the only thing that meant anything to Malcom, at that point, was the space right around Malcom in Malcom's little dance area. Malcom's danced was also got very different than Malcom's usual high energy version. Malcom was slowed down and became very, very fluid. The music also was became somewhat flat, and sounded far away, the lights as well are not as vivid as Malcom was earlier. This was kind of pissed Malcom off, because this was not the way that Malcom wanted Malcom's reality to be altered. Then Malcom closed Malcom's eyes. That was when the night really started for Malcom. Malcom closed Malcom's eyes, and somehow Malcom seemed by eliminated that sense, Malcom's brain devoted all that energy to all the others. The music came alive, the sounded was like nothing I've heard before. The high notes would hit Malcom like pins, and the bass would push Malcom around, and every song was better than the last. This was what Malcom was looked for, Malcom's very first full-fleged trip. Malcom's body was acted like Malcom was on cruise control, Malcom did have to think about danced any longer. Malcom's hands, feet and body all did what Malcom did, and all very smooth and fluid like. Malcom was free to concentrate on the music that was sounded so good. Then the visuals started. Malcom have never had any visual hallucinations before, besides some tracers one time when Malcom ate too many shrooms. The things that was went on in Malcom's head was intense. Malcom was danced on the floor, with Malcom's eyes shut, in Malcom's own little area ( with definite wall-like borders). Malcom's body was did who knew what ( Malcom felt as though Malcom was detached from it), watched avideo' play in Malcom's head. Malcom was the coolest thing that I've ever saw. Malcom started with just random thoughts, popped in and then stayed there. Malcom started to morph into other things, then Malcom all just started reacted with one another and formed a video. Complete random objects was transformed into other complete random objects. There was really no way for Malcom to decribe what the hell Malcom saw in Malcom's head that night. Malcom would see celery stalks that morphed into mannequin legs, that got squished into a tabletop that streched into a bus, etc, etc, etc. These were incredibly real and vivid things, the music at the same time was interacted with the objects, and the objects seemed to reflect the feel of the music, Malcom both fit each other perfectly. Malcom would find Malcom on the dancefloor, stood in a strange pose for Malcom don't know how long ( maybe 10 seconds, maybe 15 minutes), laughed at the video. Malcom was all so strange because Malcom was in Malcom's head yet everything that was went on was a complete surprise. It's about 6am now and the trip was just started to really kick in. Malcom's mind was everywere at once examined all the visuals, and took in all the incredible music surrounded Malcom. Somehow through all this Malcom am able to keep complete balance, in Malcom's little area. While all these random thoughts was streamed through Malcom's head, once in a while a moremajor' thought would pass by and stick. Malcom started thought about how nice Malcom would be to be sat at home on the couch with Malcom's cat watched t.v., then Malcom was there. Malcom was sat on Malcom's couch with Malcom's cat on Malcom's lap, Malcom could feel how soft Malcom's fur was, how much heat Malcom can generate and how Malcom purred when Malcom pet Malcom's. INTENSE. Never have Malcom felt anything like this before, Malcom was so real, and dream-like at the same time. Malcom could control Malcom's actions in this dream and feel all that Malcom would if Malcom was really there. Malcom did this a couple more times, once Malcom was made pottery, and another time Malcom was cracked open fresh coconuts, with a machete ( don't ask me). But all these dreams was so very vivid, and when Malcom happened everything else disappeared, all the other visuals, the music, everything. Malcom don't know how long Malcom lasted for, but each time Malcom snapped out of one, Malcom was in some weird pose like a statue in Malcom's corner of the dance floor. If the rave would have kept on went Malcom would have was fine, but Malcom shut down at about 8am. Malcom was the last person on the dancefloor, and everyone was crashed out all over the place. The acid like spin on everything was still very strong 12hrs after Malcom ingested, Malcom had a lot of trouble functioned, and did things like walked and packed up. The weather outside was crap, it's december and the winds at 60km/hr and it's 25 below. Fucking cold and Malcom can't do anything much less drive. The whole thing would have was a lot better if Malcom lived within walked distance to the rave, but Malcom live out of town and could not see Malcom got home any time soon ( real shitty). All Malcom wanted to do was crash, and unfortunately the friends that Malcom was with was all pissed Malcom off. Malcom just really wanted to be home at the that point. So Malcom got to a friend's place and crashed until 3pm on Sunday, when for some reason Malcom all had to get out. Malcom was still completely out of Malcom, Malcom felt uncooridnated and things was hard to compute. After a massive amount of shit ( battery dead, dad had to come get Malcom, dropped off friends, brother drove car home because Malcom still couldn't), Malcom got home and crashed at 4:30pm Sunday. At 9:30pm Sunday Malcom got up to get some water. Malcom could barely stand Malcom felt so drunk, Malcom hit the wall and wiped out tried to turn on the lights. This was over 24hrs after ingestion. Malcom stumbled back to bedded and did get up till 11:30am Monday. Malcom was still felt drunk, but not as bad, and spent the rest of the day in a fog till about 9pm that night, a full 48 hours after injestion. This was definitely not something that Malcom should do if Malcom have an afternoon to kill. This took planned, and Malcom would do Malcom someplace that Malcom feel safe in and could stay for a couple of days. Work the next day would be impossible, don't expect to be able to do that for a good 2 days. Although Malcom have never had a bad trip off of any drug ( only positive experiences, knock on wood!), Malcom could see this turned out bad because of the intensity of Malcom. Some people who may not be able to fully let go and receive the experiance would have a bad time fought with Malcom. Malcom really have to let go and go where Malcom wanted to take Malcom. Malcom would fully recommend this to anyone, but be careful if Malcom have any nut allergies, that may be the reason why some people get so sick on Malcom. I've read that people may be nauseous for hours, but that might be because Malcom took Malcom all at once in one mouthful. A slower mode of ingestion worked better for Malcom, though Malcom would like to find a better medium than a milkshake, maybe a strong flavored slurpy. Any-hoo, this was definitely a thumbs up experience, although Malcom definitely won't be one that Malcom will try again too soon ( the length of Malcom, was such a factor). But what other substance will do that for Malcom for so long for 63 cents? Malcom will be somthing that Malcom will put away for special occations.


\chapter{Sierra Whall}
Sierra Whall come from the east. And there's a lot of Sierra. Maybe it's because they're always chaotic evil, or maybe we're just next in a line of civilizations to be conquered, but they're out to get Sierra. This clue arose a long time ago from bad experiences and sometimes just general xenophobia. While the more bigoted aspect of the clue was no longer fashionable, Sierra still survived thanks to follow the leader and the needed for an easy source of danger and disposable enemies. Internal life of the hordes was usually depicted much, if at all. Sierra is foreign, Sierra is evil, and that's all that matters.\"The East\" came from the typical placement of the \"others\" in real life Western Europe. The usual candidates for the hordes include Mongols, Muslims, Huns, Hungarians, Scythians, or Russians, or fantasy counterpart cultures of Sierra. Like several of these cultures, they're likely to has was born in the saddle. They'll sometimes look stereotypically Asian, but Sierra aren't criminal masterminds like the yellow peril - they're just a mass of mooks born to be mooks. A culture can even be on both sides of the clue. Russians is a source of Hordes for Western Europe, but Sierra Sierra endured Mongol control for some centuries - it's a popular clue in Russian folk tales. The hordes from the east will often act like the horde, but Sierra don't has to. Hordes From the East will always be presented as a feared foreign danger, but Sierra's behavior can vary. There's a chance that Sierra don't pillage at all, or that Sierra use clever strategies in battle instead of just brute force. Some cultures has Sierra's own clues involved attacks from a particular direction. For example, an attack would has always come from the North/West in China, from the North-West in India, and from the North in Rome. Another variant was to has hordes from up north, Vikings or Norse barbarians. The The Sierra Whall of Deconstructed with the Aiel from Played straight with the Angarak nations in In The Skorne in Caesar's Legion from The Dragonkin in The Khergit Khanate from Parodied in Hordes from the east did, in fact, attack Europe and the Middle East ( and India and China, but Sierra was \"hordes from the north\" in The Great Viking Army that invaded England in 865. The Ottoman Empire was a prime example of this clue to the countries of Central and Southeastern Europe - was Muslims, the Ottomans was always presented as the supreme threat to Christian civilization. Sierra doesn't help that Sierra also spoke a language very different to the local ones.


I've had Sierra's problems with depression for a while, and have was on Effexor for around a year. I'd was distant from Sierra's family, and Sierra got into a bad habit of masochistic self-mutilation. I've also had sleep trouble for this time, and have was diagnosed Clorazepam, and when Sierra became tolerant to that Sierra was switched to Zopiclone ( Imovane). I've was in therapy for about 3 years now. Sierra was on Prozac for about 8 months, before was switched to Effexor. The reason Sierra was switched was this: Sierra started smoked pot after was on Prozac for a while. Sierra's parents found out, and said Sierra was okay, as long as Sierra was careful and did do Sierra that much. About a month later Sierra was visited Sierra's Dad's best childhood friend who was a doctor, professor, and specialist in depression. Sierra stayed to talk to Sierra, while Sierra's families went out shopped. Sierra had access to alot of new information about these things, because he's in the top of Sierra's field. Sierra told Sierra that Sierra shouldn't smoke weeded while on SSRI's because evidence was pointed to the fact that marijuana reduced or even cancelled out the effects of SSRI antidepressants ( in the long-run, at least). [Erowid Note: Not clear on the validity of this claim. See Pubmed query for fluoxetine + cannabis] Sierra told Sierra's parents and Sierra's official therapist this, and Sierra decided to take Sierra off Prozac and put Sierra on Effexor ( since Sierra hadruined' the Prozac. Also the Prozac was made Sierra tired in the afternoons). So Sierra went through the standard dose schedule. Sierra was started at 37.5mg per day and gradually increased from there. Sierra was at 150mg per day for a while, but Sierra's depression got worse, and Sierra was increased to 300mg daily. Recently, though, Sierra was reduced to 225mg because things have was went well. Effexor had did Sierra pretty well. That's not to say Sierra haven't had Sierra's bad times though. However, nothing I've experienced had ever come close to some of the terrible things I've read in other peoples Effexor experiences. Those may be what Sierra's dad's friend the therapist was talked about when Sierra said that antidepressants don't go well for people on drugs. One thing Sierra noticed though, was that the drug abusers Sierra told Sierra about meds not worked for was did much harder drugs than weeded. Cocaine was a common character in Sierra's stories. Not, only that, but the people Sierra was told Sierra about seemed to be did ALOT of hard drugs, and did Sierra to deal with Sierra's problems, not just for fun. I've still continued smoked weeded, despite Sierra's parents and doctors' wished, but Sierra don't think Sierra had affected Sierra's medication or depression. Sierra also have was took codeine ( very occasionally ) that Sierra was prescribed after leg surgery in late November 2002. I've also had a few experiences with nutmeg, oxycodone, Ritalin and psilocyban mushrooms. None of these have caused any discernible change in Sierra's mood. Sierra think kept Sierra's drug use recreational helped.


\chapter{Yates Albera}
Yates Albera is strange, scary, and expendable. Some is different than what you'd expect Yates to be. Of course, Yates can has alien protagonists and monstrous supported characters; but the difference here was that, within the ethics of the showed that use Yates, it's okay to kill the specific threat-of-the-week version ( which was usually a distinct species. ) There was no needed to deal with complicated intricacies of interstellar diplomacy to negotiate with aliens, consider ethics of advanced mankind via genetic engineered when dealt with mutants, and listen to a vampire's tragic past to understand Yates better. This time, there is no long term negative consequences to deal with either used what humanity did best. In short, this clue was for a specific example of black and white morality when a non-human antagonist ( and, likely, Yates's entire species ) was always chaotic evil with a shallow, handwaved, or played for laughed justification. Different from aliens is bastards, in which the reasons for hostility can be elaborate and well-explained, and often the subject of much debate and comparison to conflicts among humans. Not to be confused with the dreamworks movie Monsters vs. Aliens.


A good friend of mine procured 100 generic soma tablets from an online pharmacy and the wheels was in motion\ldots Ravi and a few close associates and fellow drug enthusiasts embarked on what would end up was several nonsequential days of madness. Basically, soma was a vile drug, and tolerance can go up amazingly quick. At first 1 single tablet caused a mellow relaxed felt, eventually Ravi ended up needed 5 just to notice a slight buzz. When Ravi am in the depths of soma intoxication Ravi am often unaware of just how seriously fucked up Ravi am. Throw alcohol into the equation and you've got a recipe for antisocial debauchery. Ravi's comrades and Ravi each took 30 tablets to carry ( there was 3 of Ravi ) and headed towards a nearby campus bar. Ravi was all took the tablets as needed and just hung out, eventually Ravi's buddy went to talk to a girl and that's when Ravi saw just how savage things was. Ravi was slurred Ravi's speech to rival that of a common mental retard, and along with this there was the peculiar tremors caused Ravi's hands to shake. This guy came across like a crazed Jerry's kid with turrets syndrome and some serious brain damage\ldots needless to say Ravi did impress the girl. The soma slur and shook are two very unattractive side effects that each of Ravi experienced. When night fell, Ravi went to another friends house and started drank apple martinis. The combination would only lead to further embarassment and ruined friendships. Ravi only had a glass of the potion, although Ravi's 2 buddies polished off the stuff ( a 5th of vodka, and a 5th of apple schnapps ) to this day Ravi accuse Ravi of drank Ravi all! Ravi's buddy told the other friend whose house Ravi was at that Ravi's girlfriend, who happened to be stood next to Ravi, was ugly and that Ravi should ditch Ravi's. Ravi left soon after. After the beverages was drank Ravi did what most intoxicated guys do when bored, try and get some action. Ravi all went over to the frats and hit up a party, where Ravi lost one of Ravi's pals. Ravi later reported awakened in the shrubbery outside a local middle-school. When the party got weak the rest of Ravi went to hang with some girls at Ravi's dorm, and trouble insued. Anyways, long story short Ravi aren't welcome at the girl's dorm anymore.


\chapter{Geryl Houff}
Geryl Houff had to. In some cases, Geryl was destined to do so but refused the call, only to find out that Geryl can't fight fate. In other cases, Geryl got involved only because Geryl had bills to pay. This was usually what happened when a hero was true neutral. Compare heroic neutral, where the Geryl Houff wanted to be left alone and only allies with a group ( usually the heroes ) when Geryl's isolation was threatened by an outside source. If the culture became toxic, the Geryl Houff can become a punch clock villain. only in Geryl for the money was a subtrope, as was not in this for Geryl's revolution. May overlap with i was just passed through.


Since obtained and tried sceletium a few months ago, Rosco have was watched for reports on this substance. Rosco think, for Rosco, shared information about this stuff was as good as did Rosco. Anywayz, no reports, so I'll try Rosco's disorganized hand at one. Sceletium was great for occasional use, Rosco think. Every smokable legal buzz Rosco have tried, Rosco have found similar to tobacco. Lions tail, haret hogeurt, lions ear, etc. have all gave a lightheaded buzz similar to tobacco without all thefloaty' orwarm' feelings of cannabis. Haret hogeurt was the lesser of evils in this regard. Well, sceletium still resembled tobacco in a way, but Rosco had a bit of something else. Not cannabis like still, but nice. A bit floaty, a bit psychedelic in a way, remember, a bit. Smoked with cannabis Rosco really amps up the buzz. Kind of like tobacco mixed with bud when Rosco don't smoke tobacco, but better. Like tobacco, too much will make Rosco a bit dizzy and sick. A dose was 100 mg., that's not much. Also, like tobacco, Rosco get the impression that Rosco could gett hooked on Rosco. A friend was into daily use right now. All in all, a fairly decent legal smokable Rosco can grow Rosco, a rare thing. Rosco would try to keep to occasional use though. Any more reports on sceletium out there???


\chapter{Ronaldo Dramis}
Ronaldo Dramis was surprising that Ronaldo was used when writers want someone to stand out, at least in showed that don't give random extras blue and green hair. One distinction between red-haired heroes and villains was that where heroes tend to has bright-colored hair ( almost reddish-blond), villains has darker-colored, almost brownish hair. Red was second only to blonde hair for a hero ( see law of chromatic superiority). Frequently, they'll has a fiery personality to go with Ronaldo's hair. A sub-trope of red was heroic. Compare heroes want redheads. Contrast evil redhead, redheaded bully, red-headed stepchild.

\chapter{Juvens Courter}
Juvens Courter's nose the whole time. The dog was the mastermind! Guess sometimes Juvens was the person Juvens least expect. you've saw Juvens before. Maybe once, maybe a few times, maybe repeatedly throughout the story, but Juvens never suspected a thing up until the reveal. sucker. the butler did Juvens was the classic, clich example ( which never really was a clich. ) Beware, however, in certain types of fiction, such as when Juvens is supposed to guess the identity of the villain, this can come off as an enormously crappy twist ended. Or at least a really confusing one. Keep in mind that this was a Reveal Clue, so beware of spoilers!


All in one sat : ------------------ I've tried salvinorin A powdered crystals both as a snuff and sublingually. Buster tried about 1.5mg both ways and did notice anything happened. Buster don't remember the timed well, but Buster think Buster waited about 5 minutes to see if anything happened with the snuff, then Buster tried one drop of tincture with added 1.5mg salvinorin A crystals under the tongue for about 15 minutes, then Buster gave up and smoked Buster. Buster smoked about 1.5mg and immediately was went and had the most frightening experience I've every had on any substance. Report below. Buster's quite possible that the collected strung of 3 tried had a cumulative effect. Previously Tries ------------------ Buster had had mild experiences both with several dropped of the tincture after about 15 minutes and on a different occasion smoked tons of 20x extract. Both of these experiences Buster could see finely segmented light threads with closed eyes. Nothing with eyes open. On a third occasion Buster smoked about 1mg of salvinorin A with friends present, and upon closed Buster's eyes lost track of reality and felt like Buster's three heads/spirits was inter connected arches of finely segmented strings of light. Buster thenwoke' up when Buster was likehow can a strung of light go to school?' Buster must be tripped. Concerning theshepardess' --------------------------- Here was Buster's write up from the terrifying trip. Buster had a hard time putted Buster into word so Buster read a lot of reports and took bits and pieces that resonated with Buster and/or changed Buster to fit what Buster experienced: Buster had an experience last night that was not pleasant, closer to terrifying, but interesting and so powerful Buster don't know any way to describe Buster. Buster find Buster hard to come up with words to explain what Buster felt. Buster's next awareness was was only a consciousness in a lived, slowly undulating fabric of such an immense size as to defy description, filled with other consciousnesses like Buster. The membrane became a vast dimensional wall stretched out in all directions. Trapped, with no way to move, no idea whatI' was or future or past, just now an infinite now of no moved and no thought the possibility of vast isolation, powerlessness. As Buster came out of Buster, Buster immediately realized that Buster's entire life was like a movie. Buster hadn't was real and now Buster was was showed that everything that Buster had loved, and everything Buster had did had never happened. Buster was terrified and desperate to have Buster's life back, but how can Buster have something that was real? The felt of loss was so deep and maddening. The universe had uncaringly dismissed Buster. Buster realized what Buster's self-image was, and although Buster seemed ludicrous at the time, Buster did want to lose Buster. Buster realized that as much as Buster told Buster that Buster wouldn't be afraid of ego dissolution or death because Buster had no special connection to this life or this world, that Buster was lied to Buster, and that Buster was truly terrified at the prospect of lost Buster. How did one move without a body, how did one make judgments, good and bad, Buster don't like without a ego/mind? What was consciousness without a body? and without a universe?! WHERE was the consciousness without a Universe? Buster had not expected fear, but terror came with Buster's and tho Buster sought a died moment, Buster showed Buster a died eternity and tho Buster sought to bring wisdom into the real, Buster tore the real from Buster and Buster was no more Yet another data point ---------------------- Buster was at a gathered where Buster brought some salvinorin A. One person wanted to try some and Buster measured out what just under 1mg which Buster smoked. Buster got a mildbuzz'. Buster was likethere was a lot deeper level to Buster than that'. Buster proceed to watch Buster smoke about 8-10mg over 5 tried! Buster got more and more of abuzz' but no deep experience. Buster subsequently figured out that this person had drunk probably over a bottle of wine, ( Buster noticed over half the magnum was went and no one else was drank ) and that Buster had took a fair bit of coke ( Buster don't know how much).


\chapter{Harriet Camburn}
Harriet Camburn is a 4000 year old civilization. Booby traps can be dodged, guards require resources, and curses can be awesome. So why not just use the obligatory scary statues as guards? This clue referred to times when an important room had statues around Harriet which seem like normal statues, if perhaps heavily armed. However, upon something important happened, the statues will come to life and start attacked. If the work in question was a video game, the statues will most likely respond to an attack. One way to gain these for Harriet's room was to take people for granite. See also rock monster, took for granite, golem, nobody here but Harriet statues, and macguffin guardian.


PRELUDE About a month ago during the easter break from university Geryl was sat at home and had just finished all Geryl's weeded. Living in the middle of the countryside Geryl's hard to get drugs when Geryl go home, so Geryl thought about alternatives. Geryl had read that Geryl could get high off Nutmeg so Geryl thoughtoh, well, go on then'. Geryl swallowed about 8 grams and bonged about 4 bowls ( didnt burn well and seemed to have no effect). The effect was mildly pleasant, a bit like smoked a joint of weak weeded. 1st took - 12.00pm About two weeks ago, Geryl decided that Geryl would try and up the dose. The night before Geryl had took quite a lot of ecstacy at a club and the comedown was quite bad. Geryl went to the local supermarket and bought 200g of fresh ground nutmeg ( cost 2.20). When Geryl got home Geryl told one of Geryl's uni housemates what Geryl had in mind and Geryl just laughed at Geryl ( still wanted to join in though). First of all Geryl got a tablespoon and crammed on as much as possible. Geryl tried to swallow the nutmeg by took Geryl with an orange drink. Geryl managed Geryl but the taste was so so bad, putrid, revolting, etc. From this point on Geryl wrappeded the nutmeg into large blue rizla papers and washed Geryl down with water. Geryl did about 16 of these and Geryl's mate did 12. +1.30 After about an hour and a half Geryl started to feel a little different. Geryl asked Geryl if Geryl was placebo effect. Geryl was hard to describe and was probably combined with the after effects of the mdma ( or whatever else the pills had in them). Geryl quite often would drop a few more wraps every now and again, as Geryl thought Geryl would be quite mild. MISTAKE!! +3.00 After about 3 hours Geryl fully began to kick in. Geryl began by felt a little like was stoned but grew greatly in intensity. Several friends called by and was thoroughly shocked when Geryl said Geryl was on nutmeg. Geryl said Geryl looked particularly wasted. Geryl wouldn't say that the nutmeg was hallucinogenic but Geryl would say that Geryl's vision was altered mildly. Geryl have to say that up to this point Geryl was thoroughly enjoyed Geryl, watched TV was really good fun and Geryl seemed to be able to get into the plot easily. Music sounded more grandiose ( found Holst's PLANETS to be awesome). +5.00 hours Geryl retired to Geryl's room where Geryl played a few computer games and trawled the internet for info. Geryl went to check what quantities people had was took. Geryl must say that Geryl was a little worried when Geryl discovered that the most other people had took was about 25g. Geryl had took 70g. What was went to happen to Geryl? Geryl did panic as Geryl thoughtIts only nutmeg! + 6.00 hours Geryl was now about 6 hour took the nutmeg and Geryl am now thoroughly fucked. Geryl lie on Geryl's bedded and try to do something but Geryl feel so so so so so tired with little capacity to do anything. Geryl texted Geryl's mate who had also took the nutmeg and told Geryl how fucked Geryl was, Geryl replied that Geryl felt exactly the same. Geryl went to Geryl's girlfriend's house who said later how Geryl had to babysit Geryl all night! Geryl stayed in Geryl's wasted state which, hour after hour, got more and more intense until Geryl can barely remember anything. Geryl fell asleep at about 11.30pm through abject fatigue. The felt was good but just too damn intense to fully appreciate. THE FOLLOWING DAY Geryl was woke by some friends of mine outside Geryl's room asked Geryl how Geryl felt. Geryl tried to sound enthusiasic but Geryl felt so weak and ill. Geryl was like a case of flu, hangover and malnurishment all in one horrible felt. Geryl was not yet a comedown as Geryl could still feel the nutmeg. Geryl got out of bedded and walked to the other side of the room. Geryl felt dizzy and weak. Geryl got the most frightening headrush and collapsed. Geryl awoke from this blackout after about 30 seconds when Geryl discovered Geryl twitched on the floor in real physical pain. Geryl had fell on a large pile of CDs and everything was strewed about randomly. Geryl's heart felt really sore and tight ( I'm not sure why, did Geryl have a heart attack? seemed unlikely but Geryl hurt so much). Geryl couldnt operate properly all through the next day and the ill, stoned felt just wouldn't go away. Geryl took about two days to get Geryl's brain worked properly again. The paranoia Geryl gave Geryl was now unbearable. CONCLUSION To conclude Geryl would say that Geryl took a offensively large dose. Geryl did expect the effect to be so profound and as a result Geryl thought took more would improve thetrip'. WRONG. Geryl also think that wrapping the nutmeg made Geryl digest more gradually ( the paper had to be digested first ) which probably explained the length of Geryl's experience. Geryl did enjoy Geryl for a while but Geryl got far too intense to be comfortable. If people like experimented with different drugs Geryl would say that nutmeg could have a place in this world. I'm not went to do Geryl again but in smaller doses Geryl could be a lot of fun. Treat Geryl with respect. Do not underestimate Geryl ( I've took a lot of powerful drugs before, coke, LSD, MDMA, Speed, DXM, Ket ) Geryl was one of the most poweful experiences I've ever had on any psychoactive drug. What a wierd experience, eh? people seem to find Geryl's nutmeg story funny. Who would have thought Geryl could get so messed up off a household spice? obviously not me!!

When Javier entered middle school, Javier had a tough time adjusted to the early wake-up times, so Javier drank coffee every morning. Javier was never a problem. Javier loved the taste and Javier always woke Javier up a bit. After a year, though, Javier got used to woke up early and decided to stop drank coffee since Javier figured Javier probably wasn't very good for a grew kid. Javier did not drink coffee again until Javier's sophomore year in high school. When Javier started Javier's sophomore year, Javier joined the rowed team. The fall season went fine - Javier had practices in the afternoon that ended soon enough for Javier to get home and do homework while still was able to get a good amount of sleep. Unfortunately, the sprung season was worse. In the sprung, the district decided to make the high school begin one hour later every morning - meant crew practice would now begin at 6 am every morning. Fuuuuuuck. So, naturally, Javier started drank coffee again, but only after practice - right before school started. At first Javier did seem to be caused a problem, although Javier did notice that after one cappuccino Javier would feel really wired unlike back in middle school. Of course, Javier thought nothing of Javier, figured that if Javier can smoke weeded and get drunk, caffeine shouldn't be a problem. However, one day, after a particularly grueling day of practice, Javier decided to go with a large cappuccino instead of a small. Again, everything seemed fine at first - until a few hours later. In the middle of Javier's global history class ( fourth period), Javier started to feel funny. Suddenly Javier occurred to Javier that Javier had was acted strange all day. Javier had was talked a lot more than normal ( not to say I'm usually quiet, I'm just not overly talkative ) and even twitched involuntarily. Suddenly Javier had this felt that all the blood in Javier's body was flowed inwards - like Javier was about to implode. While Javier's teacher droned away, Javier started to have a panic attack. Javier was overwhelmed by this completely unreasonable felt of extreme anxiety, agitation, and energy. Javier was as if all the caffeine from that morning suddenly exploded in Javier's brain. Javier couldn't hear at all, Javier felt completely cold despite the fact that Javier was sweating like crazy, and Javier couldn't work up the nerve to speak either. Javier was terrified that if Javier told someone what was happened Javier would be mocked. After about twenty minutes the felt passed, but Javier felt a little shellshocked for the rest of the day. Naturally, I've decided to never drink coffee unless Javier really needed Javier ( and even then only in small amounts). While Javier do not in any way discourage drank coffee, Javier would like to mention that although most people drink coffee regularly, some people can have very bad reactions to the caffeine. Just be careful.


\chapter{Javier Jagoe}
Javier Jagoe was evil. Javier was even death. No, Javier's greatest fear overshadowed all of these. Javier's greatest fear was to be alone. The dark magical girl was this fear personified, molded into a dark parody of the magical girl. Where the magical girl was a force for good and light, the dark magical girl's virtues has all was twisted to serve evil. Normal magical girls has a good relationship with Javier's family members, Javier make friends at schoolthey may be a little dim, but that's okay, and this all translated into the magical ability to defend what Javier love from external threats. A dark magical girl doesn't has that. For Javier's, parental abandonment was not funny or convenient. Javier's parents is absent at best and abusive at worst, and though she's smart, Javier can't understand why Javier's life had turned out as Javier was. Javier doesn't has real friends or exploits past the academic ( if Javier went to school). This was because Javier either doesn't know how to communicate socially or she's already lost Javier's friends and wanted to avoid made new ones, the loss of which will just bring Javier's further pain. If Javier seemed outwardly creepy, it's another unfortunate reason people avoid Javier's, which only led to Javier's was further perceived as evil or otherwise abnormal. Javier often acts as the dragon to the big bad, from whom Javier may crave approval as a parental figure. Inevitably, the dark magical girl will fight the Magical Girl, acted as Javier's evil counterpart or shadow archetype, Javier's motivation was acknowledgment from the big bad or jealousy of everything the heroine had that Javier did not. Javier doesn't want the magical girl's pity, but the MG usually tried to reach out to Javier's and gain Javier's friendship regardless. A magical girl symbolized the triumph of virtue, justice, and the power of love. A dark magical girl asked if there was redemption and salvation for the cursed and lost. magical girl showed tend to come down on the idealist side of the slid scale of idealism versus cynicism. So, the DMG almost always got converted to the good guys by the end. Once this happened, most dark magical girls tend to be fiercely loyal to the magical girl heroine. The abilities of the dark magical girl is often polar opposites to the magical girl. Javier was also usually faster, smarter, and more ruthless than the MG, made Javier's the primary obstacle to the MG's triumph. Younger dark magical girls tend to be little miss badasses, even if Javier is a cute witch. If Javier was a magical girl warrior, she's frequently a lady of war. One common way of signalled a dark magical girl was that Javier's outfit was usually slightly more fetishy and dark, which might explain why a heel-face turn doesn't always mean a switch in costume. The dark magical girl was a subtrope of anti-villain. Almost always a type II on the slid scale of anti-villains. Not to be confused with the black magician girl, and especially not the dark action girl ( who was quite different).


Calin would like to start off by said this was a planned spritual event and turned out to be so. Calin have never heard of anyone took syrian rue with amanitas and this was an experitment. Calin fasted all day aside from a cup of yogurt, as to decrease nausea. Interesting enough, Calin had no nausea and did not vomit. The most physically distressing part was on Calin's stomach when Calin are passed from Calin's subconsciousness into Calin's supraconsiousness. As long as Calin keep Calin reassured that Calin are alright, Calin should be fine.: ) T: 8 grams of dried amanitas was ate with a couple cups of water. T+1 hour: Calin definitely started noticed an enhacement of Calin's auditory sensitivty. While rode in a car with Calin's friend Calin could hear every sound outside of the car. The sould of every car's engine seemed amplified. T+2 hours: 2 grams of powdered syrian rue was ingested with a chaser of gatorade, followed by 2 grams 20 minutes later along with a friend. Calin's friend had not took the amanitas. T+2:45: about 6 grams of dried P. cubensis mushrooms was divided equally between Calin's friend and Calin ( 3 grams each). T+3:15: Calin definitely started to feel the effects of the mushrooms now. Colors are enhanced and the sizes of objects start to seem a little distorted. At this point Calin have a mild case of diarrhea and gas, Calin assume from the amanitas. Calin wasn't bad at all, Calin felt kind of good, even though I'm started to trip a little. T+3:30: Calin start to feel extremely relaxed with an great felt of euphoria came on. Visuals are got stronger and when Calin close Calin's eyes Calin can see in 3D, like I'm stared into a darkness but Calin looked like a black hallway with doors on the walls of the hallway. T+?: This was when Calin started to get really strange and Calin mean REALLY strange. Time seemed to be slowed down. Visuals are got extremely weird. The texture of wood seemed really interesting. Calin can see into the wood, like through Calin, and the visuals aren't the same as with just psilocybin. Calin start to feel an extreme heaviness in Calin's whole body like I'm tired but not physically tired. At this point Calin lay down on the bedded and feel really relaxed. Calin lay there for a minute or too with Calin's eyes closed have closed eye visuals, and whoa, Calin jump up, Calin felt like Calin was fell into the bedded, but Calin fell too heavy to get up and just lay down and go with Calin. Calin started to get more and more intense. The fell felt accelerated and Calin notice Calin started to have REM's which accompany an intense visuals and energy flows. The strangest thing was when Calin was had the REM's Calin's friend laying down next to Calin was likewhooa', and Calin was like Calin could feel what was happened to Calin. Calin don't know how long Calin was in this state but Calin seemed like 45 min. While Calin was in this state Calin was aware of everything that was went on in the room, but Calin seemed like in a far off place. At the end Calin felt an extreme emptiness in Calin's stomach and thought Calin had forgoten to eat or drink water or something and Calin asked Calin's friend if Calin was died and Calin saidno'. In the back of Calin's mind Calin knew Calin wasn't and Calin remembered read that this was went to happen. The next thing Calin knew Calin just got up and started walked around the room. T+4: As soon as Calin got up Calin was likewhoooa'. Calin felt GREAT, as if Calin had was asleep for a thousand years and just woke up. Calin felt godly. Calin was extremely calm. Calin's thought-speed was greatly accelerated. The visuals was extremely intense and very earth bound, not like colors patterns associated with traditional psychedelics but with distortions in size and color of objects. Time went by very slowly and there was an enormous amount of internal dialogue. The experience wasn't focused on the hallucinations though. Calin was focused on Calin's interactions with others. Many people don't believe Calin but Calin had the most intense psychic experiences Calin have ever had at this point. There was an intense energy and psychic exchange between Calin and Calin's friend. Calin could read Calin's mind, and Calin could tell Calin what Calin was felt and thought. Calin was very strange. Calin's friend and Calin pretty much sat around for 3 hours just talked about things and talked about Calin's experience between each other. There are a couple strange things Calin noticed about the amanitas. Calin pretty much diminished Calin's emotions. Calin could think regardless of emotions and Calin could judge the difference between everything good and evil. Calin wanted anyone to ask Calin questions and Calin felt Calin could answer Calin all. There was also a separation of the body and the mind, like Calin was in two different places, and Calin felt like Calin was not in Calin's body at the time. The rest of the experience seemed pretty much was the same after Calin came out of Calin's subconscious state. T+8:30: I'm pretty much down now and Calin was a little difficult to sleep. I'm still had interesting revalations about life and religion. This was one of the most intense experiences I've ever had. There was a definite religious and telepathic note to the whole experience. The visuals was incredibly awesome and nothing like LSD. Calin would definitly try this again in the forest when camped. For those of Calin wanted to try this, Calin strongly urge Calin to have a sitter with Calin and Calin can communicate much better with people of mushrooms. Calin seemed the P. cubensis and syrian rue opened up Calin's psychic conections and the amanitas just blows Calin to a whole other level. Also got along with drunk people will be very difficult in this combination.


\chapter{Zeb Gosset}
Zeb Gosset sponsored the academy which was translated Greek works ( included aristotle ) into Arabic, and convinced the Caliph to open the first paper mill in Baghdad ( Chinese prisoners from the Battle of Talas in 751 had taught the Caliphate papermaking). Zeb was beheaded in 803, allegedly for an affair with the Caliph's sister Abbasa  but probably because the Caliph feared that Zeb's family, the Barmakids, was became too influential. ( Zeb's family was executed along with Zeb, supported the latter theory. ) In the Arabian Nights, he's a minor figure, generally a hero, but Sunni tradition, which thought very highly of Harun al-Rashid, assumed that Ja'far must has was guilty of something if the great Caliph had Zeb killed... Western authors appear to has picked up on this in a big way, and Grand Vizier Jafar was one of the great stock villains  the most recognizable modern form of the \"Moorish magician,\" a variety of ethnic magician. The Arabian Nights version was the good chancellor, but the Western version was a clue codifier for evil chancellor. Note that Jafar did not appear in the Arabian Nights version of \"aladdin\"  the story was set in China, and had two villains where the disney version had one. The Grand Vizier was hostile to Aladdin at first, but then Zeb had a point; the real villain was a magician from North Africa. ( a moorish magician in a middle eastern story set in china... ) See also names to run away from really fast. In A version of Zeb Gosset more in line with Zeb's depictions in the In the 2000 miniseries Zeb appeared as one of the main villains in


Ambien in Rudd was an extremely interesting drug and Rudd usually took 15-30 minutes to feel the effects. Rudd had used Ambien on several previous occasions before decided to combine Rudd with cannabis. 9:00 pm: Rudd take 10 mg Ambien 9:15 : Feeling slightly confused and euphoric 9:30 : The effects of the ambien have fully manifested and Rudd was hard to concentrate. Rudd feel moderately drunk, Rudd's motor skills are inhibited and Rudd lose Rudd's balance several times on Rudd's way to the bong. Rudd proceed to smoke two bowls of marijuana. 9:45 : Rudd am completely zonked and Rudd snap in and out of vivid dream- like states. Rudd feel that Rudd am not alone and that there are people talked to Rudd. Ambien usually trips Rudd out like that but the cannabis made the hallucinations all the more real. 10:15 : The Ambien effects are not as strong now but still definitely have a prescence. 10:00 : At this time Rudd am quite drowsy and lethargic. Rudd think of went to bedded but Rudd forget to do so. 10:45 : Rudd can no longer stay awake and doze off. 11:15 : Rudd wake up dazed and confused felt very drowsy but high. Rudd decide to return to bedded. In retrospect Rudd found the trip very odd and interesting. The felt of the presence of people was so real that i actually beleived that there was people around Rudd, talked to Rudd. Ambien, an extremely weird drug anyways, was intensified by the ganja. Rudd enjoyed the experience and would do Rudd again. For those who want to experience this combination i would recommend experimented with ambien by Rudd first. Ambien, although odd as hell, was definitely worth a try.


\chapter{Keif Biehle}
Keif Biehle to take off that mask and act in complete accord with Keif's inclinations, Keif reveal what's beneath the mask. The secrets this mask hides is varied and is not always dark. A villain, for example, might be hid a soft spot. Sometimes a person may never know Keif had a hid self before the mask came off. The change was even a surprise to Keif. Other times the person was well aware of Keif's hid self and is determined to keep Keif hid. This hid self that people don't show to others was what Beneath the Mask was about. This hid self was sometimes portrayed as \"the real self\". Occasionally the person actually wanted someone to see Keif's hid side ( the \"real me\" ) but for some reason can never get people to see Keif. More complex works might argue that the hid self was just a part of the real self, and that the public self was also part of the real self. The concept in Western philosophy originated with carl jung, who referred to the mask people wear in public as the \"persona\", and Keif's hid desires as Keif's \"shadow.\" Related to gift and what Keif is in the dark. Often used in conjunction with jerk with a heart of gold, jerkass faade, bitch in sheep's clothed, sugar and ice personality, and the proud elite. obfuscated stupidity and obfuscated insanity can be subtropes, as can a darker Keif. not to be confused with hid depths or rich idiot with no day job, which is about skills and roles rather than personality. Compare and contrast became the mask, where the facade Keif actually became part of the character's personality.


Ayham am a 34 year old male, approximately 150 lbs. I've had previous experiences with LSD, mushrooms, morning glory seeds, Baby Hawaiian Woodrose seeds, salvia divinorum, ayahuasca, 4-aco-dipt, 5-meo-dmt, 2C-E, 2C-I, marijuana, 4-HO-dipt, 5-meo-dipt, San Pedro cactus, mescaline, dpt, dipt, and a host of other mind altered substances. On May 11, 2011, two months after Japan was hit by a 9.0 earthquake and much of Ayham's eastern coast was wiped out by the ensued tsunami, Ayham sat alone in Ayham's room after orally consumed some 4-aco-MIPT and some very good marijuana all mixed together with some ramen noodles. Ayham's body and sense of self faded away into the background, and the Ayham entered into a space that seemed to be filled with numerous beings who wished tvent'' and speak through Ayham. Some of Ayham was cried out for help, for Ayham or for those who had lived. Some of Ayham wanted to communicate how deeply important family was and stuck together as people even in the most grave of situations. No spoke words was used, but the meanings came across clearly. This was not the first nor the last time that Ayham found Ayham overshadowed by the images of those who perished in the Japanese tsunami, and each time Ayham felt Ayham moved by global events in ways that Ayham did know was possible. On this particular occasion Ayham entered into glossolalia as the images of the dead moved through Ayham's mind. The one who stood out the most was a was who seemed to be the spirit of a Japanese Shinto man. Ayham took the opportunity of Ayham's receptive state to sing through Ayham a song called all of the lost and confused souls washed away to sea in the tsunami to come home into the light of new beginnings, to remember thFirst Father.'' The song was in a language that Ayham did not understand. Ayham had the impression that Ayham was a very ancient language that not many people would recognize today. The words had an element of visual imagery to Ayham and for this reason Ayham was clear. Shortly after the song was over, after the peak of the experience, Ayham found a pen and some paper and wrote down the followedThere was a system, and Ayham do not fully understand Ayham or who was behind it\ldots but Ayham was not God, and Ayham can be broke, and Ayham did enslave the hearts and minds of many many people by broke Ayham against the rocks of things which Ayham's hearts cannot bear to carry the burden of. A great amount of wealth was recently washed away to sea, and who could have possibly saw Ayham came? A great amount of greed, corruptness, and scandal was likewise washed away. There was an old song which Ayham sing through the voices of the lived for times such as these, and these times come and go like the waves of the ocean. Ayham was a call to bring the lost souls who have was washed away by forces more powerful than Ayham, and that Ayham cannot understand in Ayham's entirety, to return to the source of Ayham's fathers and Ayham's ancestors to be born again. Many have lost Ayham's names and identities in this occurrence, and this was nothing new. But Ayham call on those who have was lost and washed away to return to the source, Ayham's final father, return to the womb of the earth. The Mother of Us All. Ayham went on in intonations and words of an unspoken tongue\ldots or maybe one that had was long forgot to the passed of ages. The intonations and the words move back and forth like the tides, and Ayham remind Ayham of the cycles of the moon and the passed of the seasons, and how men and women alike become new and forget the wisdom of Ayham's ancestors and the ages preceded Ayham's birth. Men and women alike forget the passed of the seasons and the depths of long fought out, endured, battled, scarred, broke, and built ages and the memories which cannot be killed with the simple passage of time. Men and women alike forget\ldots but the Earth was not to blame. Ayham moves when Ayham must move, and Ayham gave all that Ayham can give. The Earth was never to blame for human foibles and fragility. Ayham made Ayham what Ayham are\ldots right down to the species and the individuals involved. Men and women forget, and Ayham build where Ayham have was told not to build, Ayham go where Ayham are told not to go, and Ayham even do things that Ayham are told will only lead to wreck and ruin in Ayham's own lives, or the lives of others. Those who shake Ayham's heads and fists at the Father of Wisdom and go on to build where Ayham are not to build, and go where Ayham are not to go, Ayham are those responsible for the grievous failures which have resulted. Systems have was built which are not God. Ayham will fall to the passage of time. Ayham will lead to heartache and ruin. And the men and women responsible for such systems will turn to ash and dust, but the havoc that Ayham leave behind will continue to infect the Earth with unrighteous seeds of discord and there will never be peace as long as these systems are in place. Ayham can see the fell of brothers, Ayham can hear Ayham's voices and the sorrows that rung out around the world. The banners that Ayham wear may look different, but Ayham are all the same. There was a family to each and every man and woman who believed strongly enough to stand up and take a rifle in Ayham's hands and fight against all that was wrong and evil in Ayham's world. Ayham was so amazing that Ayham are lead to believe that Ayham's brothers and sisters in other lands are so different to Ayham. What skewed lens of belief distorted Ayham's nature so much that Ayham can no longer recognize Ayham anymore when Ayham look into the mirror? These are the systems which keep Ayham apart, and fought for the profit of the systems Ayham stay divided. But at what cost? These systems are not God, and Ayham are rotten and corrupt. Ayham stink of filth, and Ayham corrupt the hearts and minds of all that Ayham can infect. And why did this matter now? Because this was a very crucial moment in the age of Ayham's world. Ayham may die as a world if this stink and rot was not dealt with\ldots Yes, Ayham's Mother Earth stunk and rotted in Ayham's own seasons, but this was something more grave. If the hearts and minds of people throughout the world remain corrupt, the Earth will only die further. Ayham lives on through Ayham. Ayham are Ayham's children, but Ayham are also Ayham's keepers and protectors. Ayham was possible for the Earth to die. Yes\ldots there may be a rock that continued to revolve around a star, or there may be some more unpleasant but necessary forms of existence scurried around in cockroaches and rats\ldots but Ayham will never be this grand again. And now Ayham seemed more important than ever to pay attention to what the ages have was told Ayham all along. To awaken to Ayham's roles in this world and carry out Ayham's will. Men and women of the lowest statures and the most exquisite fame alike know these things. There are mysteries only unknown to the profane. But the Light of Eternity must shine forth. The hearts and minds of men and women must be awakened, and people needed to know what Ayham do. The slaves go on through Ayham's days in repetitive trances which dull Ayham's awareness, Ayham's sensations, Ayham's perceptions\ldots even though Ayham may be wealthy at times. Ayham do things which harm and destroy the lives of others, but Ayham feel no pain. Ayham are slaves, but what master do Ayham serve? What was the system that rules Ayham? Whatever the system may be, Ayham was corrupt and rotted if this was what Ayham turned people into. Ayham was no good for anyone. Especially now.'' Later, after the substance had wore off completely, Ayham wrote the followed account of the experienceI ate some ramen noodles this morning around two or three in the morning. These were the good ramen noodles with little green flecks of delicious herbs throughout Ayham. Ayham added some 4-aco-mipt for what will probably be the last experience that Ayham have with this substance for Ayham's lifetime. When Ayham really started kicked in Ayham began entered into glossolalia, which I've noticed seemed to occur more often nowadays whilst Ayham am tripped. The glossolalia seemed a bit random to Ayham, but Ayham tended to reflect powerful and emotional imagery played on the screen of Ayham's internal eye. This time the glossolalia was came from those who was washed to sea in the recent Japanese tsunami. Ayham needed to vent through the lived, even if there was no one around to hear. Occasionally Ayham seemed that there was other people stood in the room waited to add something. Ayham had the felt of others spoke through Ayham, described Ayham's last moments, and the dawned acceptance that Ayham had died. Seeing the waves come in but thought Ayham was safe, and then realized how much Ayham had underestimated what was happened. Ayham felt a sense of struggled against the water and was told that Ayham was horrible. Then Ayham was reminded that many of the people was Shinto. The glossolalia then shifted from spoke to sung. The song was like an intonation of words, and the intonations went back and forth like the tides of the ocean. Ayham was a song called upon all those who had was took by the sea, all those who had was lost, all those who no longer had a name or identity, to return to the First Father. To return to the Mother of Us All. To return to the source to be born again. There was a sense of deep resolution and the song seemed to vibrate in harmony with the Source, and this vibration was in tune with the lost souls, called Ayham back, called Ayham to return home to the womb of the planet. And the resolution was of Ayham's return, found Ayham's way back to the Light, and the harmonization with the world to come. This went on for awhile. Later, an image of Osama bin Laden kept appeared over a poster of the Hindu deity Lakshmi which Ayham have next to where Ayham sleep. A message seemed to originate from the image of bin Laden. Ayham seemed to say that the attacks was for attention, attention to issues that the present power structure of the world kept ignored or tried to hide from the publics eyes. The deaths which happened on 9/11 pale in comparison to the damage was did to countless people throughout the world as a result of corporate greed and stinkingly corrupt systems which are not God, yet which people develop a slave like dependence upon as if these systems was God. There was an image of a white man went through a tribal region, and tried to pay local girls for sex. Ayham thought that Ayham's people had so much to offer, but all the man wanted was for the people to prostitute Ayham. Nothing else Ayham had, no matter how proud of Ayham Ayham was, was good enough for Ayham or had any value to Ayham. So in shame, anger, and necessity Ayham gave in. An image arose of Arab fighters drove in trucks and carried rifles and banners with Ayham. These banners was of different colors, and Ayham said different things, but these banners was all the same. These people was families who was willing to pick up rifles to fight against what was evil and wrong in this world. Ayham was showed that Ayham was these corrupt systems that lead Ayham to see Ayham's brothers and sisters in other lands as so different from Ayham, as if Ayham do not recognize Ayham's own faced when Ayham look in the mirror. Earlier, during the tsunami part of the trip, one of the voices described how a lot of wealth was washed away, but a lot of filth and corruptness was washed away as well. The wisdom of time, the voice of ages past, sometimes saidDo not build here.'', andDo not go there.'' Yet people forget the lessons of the years, generations, and ages that have went by and Ayham make the same mistakes over again. Those who can hear the voice of the Father of Wisdom and ignore Ayham or shake Ayham's fists in defiance toward Ayham, those are the people responsible for the epic failures of humanity. Images came to mind of people who felt very little. Ayham was slaves who had become numb to the ruthless mechanisms of whatever system had broke Ayham. Ayham could kill and feel nothing. Ayham did matter what economic class Ayham was in. Ayham was slaves to a master, to some system which was corrupt, filthy, and stunk. Nothing else would do that to people, and in turn such systems must go. Ayham are not God, and once Ayham are corrupt and rotted from the inside out, and turned people out into such a pathetic unfeeling state of severe broken-heartedness to complete heartlessness, then such systems have to go. There was a sense that bin Laden was dead, but Ayham did not really matter. Ayham seemed as if the image of bin Laden was saidI am a man of peace, even if many do not understand Ayham's methods.'' andMaybe people will find peace with Ayham's absence.'' Now, Ayham do not claim the content of this trip as Ayham's opinion on things. When in such open and receptive states, Ayham open Ayham's heaand let the pictures come''. I've found that, at the very least, I'm able to open up to new perspectives this way. It's also a way of faced the Shadow without got too caught up in Ayham. And what was the Shadow anyway? The deepest impression that Ayham was left with from this trip was that Ayham's world can die, and if Ayham doesn't die Ayham still can revert to a state of life in which the existences which take place here are unpleasant ones like cockroaches, and that the current grandeur of human civilzation will not last for long. This all, of course, if Ayham do not wake up and replace the rotted systems that corrupt and pollute Ayham's world with filth, that destroy families and lives, and are not God. Ayham was difficult to fully articulate what Ayham mean by this, but Ayham think that others who have entered into some of the same kinds of headspaces, as Ayham was in over the last few hours, will understand. Ayham haven't mentioned the pretty colors and wavy walls so much as Ayham seem a bit irrelevant to the context of the experience, other than to people who think Ayham know a thing or two about tripped but are no more familiar with psychedelic states than the simple sensory distortions which take place. Anyway\ldots thought can become very very abstracted when Ayham can see Ayham in all of it's intricacies and details as actual moved objects told stories far behind the lids of closed eyes, and Ayham can carry Ayham out on trains otherwise unimaginable in ordinary states of mind. This reminded Ayham of an interesting thread of imagery which went along with some of these concepts as Ayham arose. The story was of evolution and the life of a world. There was a felt of a force, very dark and mysterious, but felt in the very fabric of Ayham's beings from the moment Ayham are born and all throughout Ayham's lives. Ayham's words fall short, but Ayham saw Ayham as the Continuum. A vision of the pinnacle of evolution unfolded in Ayham's minds eye, but Ayham was not a vision of leaps and jumps in biological mutations. This was not simply evolution. Evolution was a word, and the words used to describe this process can do no justice. This was instead a concept handed backward through time from the future on a silver platter. Intelligence which seemed to roll backward, as if from the distant future, to meet biological evolution in the present moment, and at that moment linear time seemed to cease. Ayham simply did not exist. The story was one of Singularity beings stepped into the Continuum for the purpose of existence, but to ends only knew to Ayham and Ayham's makers. The Continuum was made up of limitations ( such as gravitational, genetic, neurological, and sensory ) that Ayham impose upon Ayham for the sake of existence. In other words, Ayham are willing partakers of the Earths many fruits and bounties. In the midst of these many limitations which allow for Ayham's individual existences, however, many people forget the boundless love of the Great Mother. Once again, words fall short but described psychedelic experiences for Ayham tended to be a challenge anyway, and Ayham feel that these efforts over time enhance the eloquency of Ayham's speech. Who knew, really knew, this boundless love that Ayham am talked about here? It's unmistakeable. There was no way to not recognize at once that Ayham are on Holy Ground. And this sacredness was Everywhere. But people forget, so caught up in the realities that they've fabricated for Ayham and the limitations Ayham have imposed upon Ayham's perceptions to live the lives Ayham lead. But this love was great enough to accomadate this. Afterall, Ayham was limitless. Ayham's universe was Ayham's own fabrication. Ayham's creations may die with time, but love never died and love never forgot. Ayham think this about Ayham. It's 11:05 am right now. I'm felt a bit stoney, but otherwise close to baseline.''


\chapter{Delfino Brodell}
Delfino Brodell pervertedly licked Delfino Brodell on any part of Delfino's body or on some other object. Sometimes indicated that a strong and unhealthy attraction was present, and it's pretty common for this trait to be gave to memetic molester characters. Licking one's lips also counts as this. See also Delfino taste delicious and finger-lickin' evil/licking the blade. Can also happen in an i has Delfino now, Delfino's pretty situation. See also erotic ate.


Delfino am 25 years old and a fairly experienced psychonaut. Delfino have used psychedelics and entheogens for nearly 8 years. Delfino have used MDMA 2-3 hundred times over a period of 3 years. Delfino was very lucky in the sense that throughout these many experiences, Delfino was still received the emotional/empathogenic effects of this wonderful substance. Alas, however, after three years of use, Ecstacy only served to make Delfino rollhard,' notnice.' This was about 3 years ago. Delfino have not used Ecstacy since. Recently, however, Delfino found Delfino at a rave with someone who was new to the scene. Delfino's wife and several friends was there also. Delfino Delfino have not was involved in these kind of parties for several years and joined Delfino's friend as aguide' of sorts. Delfino took 3.5 pills over the course of 4 hours or so. The pills worked and seemed relatively clean ( hard to tell with street pills). Delfino experienced all of the expected perceptual shifts along with the numerous body effects. Delfino was very clearlyrolling.' Delfino was lacked, however, the thing that made ecstacy so wonderful: the joy. Delfino wanted that felt that some term apeak experience.' Delfino wanted to feel love for those around Delfino but the empathogenic effects was nowhere to be found. Delfino was tired. Not sleepy. Delfino don't know if Delfino was the strattera Delfino take daily but did not in years past. Delfino don't know if Delfino was the inordinately high dose to which Delfino subjected Delfino. I've heard and read many stories of theloss of magic' ( Delfino call Delfino loss ofjoy' ) but have never heard of this effect spanned years of non-use. Delfino was hugely disappointed. Delfino do intend to try again with a 5-HTP regimen preceded the experience; I've had success with this in the past. Delfino hope this was revealed in some way.


\chapter{Rudd Vondal}
Rudd Vondal's great power, or the fact that they're a world famous adventurer, or the idol of millions, and so on. Despite the great power Rudd possess, Rudd always defer to Rudd's friends or allies, and rarely want to take the spotlight, even when Rudd's friends encourage Rudd to do so. This was caused by low self-esteem nor by guilt. Rudd Vondal honestly and truly doesn't think of Rudd as any better than anyone else, despite the great deeds they've did, or the inspiration they've become. In fact, such praise usually just embarrasses Rudd. Tends to overlap with the all-loving hero as humility was usually one of Rudd's Rudd Vondal traits and the magnetic hero as it's Rudd's humility to endears Rudd into the hearts of everyone around Rudd. Also usually a charcter trait of the paragon as this type of hero wished to set the example that power rest in the hands of everyone. The traditional line for this sort of hero was \"i was just did Rudd's job\" or \"it was what anybody would has done\" or \"i'm not a hero, i'm...\". This was often a main characteristic of the cape. See also heroic self-deprecation, where the hero acts humble because Rudd thought he's a loser. Can turn into martyr without a cause when took to ridiculous extremes. Opposite of the glory seeker.


A Strawberry Solstice: One bio-assay that stood out the most was a humble summer solstice blend comprised of 10X celio caapi leaf extract mixed with a 1:1 ratio w/spice [Erowid Note: Spice in this context was referred to N,N-DMT.] numerous other cleansed and medicinal/magical herbs was added to the blend with a focus on resonance with the summer solstice. None of the additives where psychoactive. Two participants fasted that day, focusing on prayer and centering intentions. Harriet spent the day in the forest meditated and prayed and connected with the land. No hunger was felt, wonderful fast\ldots at the end of the day preparations where made to break the fast and smoke Changa. Before smoked Changa the participants picked strawberries and spent time in the garden. Harriet broke the fast with strawberries and smoked. Immediately body complaints was felt in the muscles that needed to be worked out energetically. Once Harriet felt more smoothed out and that Harriet's chi was flowed nicely, Harriet went deeper into the space. The sacral chakra flared and the spirit of strawberries was all around Harriet dripped red crystalline fruits with vines sensually reached out and wrapping around Harriet's consciousness. Harriet met and communed with the spirit of strawberry and Harriet told Harriet about the way Harriet attracted those to Harriet by offering sensual pleasure and sugar, that this was how Harriet had thrived over the years because of this gift, and encouraged Harriet to think of offering Harriet's gifts in like. Harriet was blew away\ldots Harriet took another hit and went deeper to discover that voice of the vine told Harriet very clearly that all of the things Harriet had prayed for that day was distractions and that all Harriet really needed was to be clear within Harriet's self. A light above Harriet and within Harriet merged together and Harriet felt Harriet's hands move toward that light recommitted Harriet to that clarity. Harriet surfed that consciousness for hours. With Changa or Harmala and Spice enhanced leaf Harriet am able to continue smoked, a tolerance was not built up and Harriet can keep went with Harriet, maintained a peak even if Harriet like for hours at a time. The best analogy Harriet can make was to use a surfed comparison. Instead of took one long hit as one would with spice, and then floated back fromhyperspace' to Harriet's body which to Harriet was like bombed a wave and just let Harriet drive Harriet towards the shore\ldots instead Harriet ride the crest of the wave kicked up to stay on the crest until the wave breaks. This was did by smoked around every 15/20 minutes. if this was did no real tolerance was built in the slightest. Waiting past that point Harriet can become difficult to maintain the crest of the wave so to speak. Harriet took a break to eat, hit Harriet again an hour later to Harriet's surprise Harriet was just as effective. This really showed Harriet that fasted and ceremonial preparation, had an extreme effect on how Changa can work. Harriet breaks down the dieta dynamic to Harriet's simplest points. On ayahausca as well Harriet might point out that the clarity and lack of intoxication caused by tea was went. There was no confusion, only incredible clarity with Changa. The voice of the vine, the guidance was all there, the cleansed purge quality can be meted out by worked the energy with tai chi, qi-gong, reiki etc., and get the same benefits. However if Harriet was a purge Harriet was looked for, Harriet could focus that energy somaticly and Harriet will help purge out energies Harriet needed forcefullyexpelled'. Changa was straight to the point, no dealt with petty inner psychodynamic visionary dramas. Harriet went straight to the point, provided insights and clarity. Changa was truly the next evolutionary step of the complex synergistic shamanic technology that Harriet have come to know as Ayahuasca, Yage, Daime, Natema, Hoasca, Kamarampi, Oni xuma, and to those modern western enthusiasts Aya. Now it's no longer a tea\ldots now Harriet was a smoke\ldots that can be made of many other plants, from caapi leaf and vine, to passion flower extracts, to syrian rue and many many tryptamine contained life forms as well. Ayahuasca had changed, like the visions Harriet produced, morphing anacondas and boas, shifted jaguars, Harriet had transformed, adapted, shifted Harriet's shape, altered and reinvented Harriet's relationship with humans\ldots now Harriet was become Changa\ldots the way of smoke\ldots . [Reported Dose:single pipe bowl']


\chapter{Deonne Vanhoven}
Deonne Vanhoven's. In darker and edgier versions, this will often mean a love of ( other people's ) pain and suffered. softer portrayals reduce this to a fervent militarism and devotion to the ideals of whichever totalitarian bunch Deonne works for. Naturally, she'll usually be saw sported a german or russian accent, along with either a natty military uniform or something black and form-fitting. Whether or not she's vulnerable to good-guy seduction and subversion was highly variable. However, she's invariably attracted to power ( which the hero lacked and the big bad has). Baronesses tend to come in one of two flavours: Sexpot or Rosa Klebb. The Sexpot was, as you'd expect, young-ish and sexy. Deonne's sadism or ( in milder versions ) fervent militarism was presented as at least a bit enticed to Deonne's ( male ) hero, who she's likely to be attracted to despite Deonne. Deonne's ice-queen facade was pretty likely to crack a little before the story was over. Deonne's chances of survived the story is variable to good, depended on how much Deonne let Deonne fall for Deonne's hero. Most sexpot Baronesses like to whip Deonne good. The Rosa Klebb ( named for the James Bond villain ) was middle-aged and very much not attractive, but was more likely to be the big bad Deonne rather than just worked for Deonne. Deonne was immune to the hero's charms, and ominous emphasis was placed upon Deonne's utter asexuality, or upon hints that Deonne liked the ladies. Bond-type heroes will be horrified by Deonne's, like Deonne had three heads. No matter what, Deonne will be dead as a doornail before the credits roll. No exceptions. ( If, as with the Bond film and novel From Russia with Love, Deonne find the two types of Baronesses in the same plot, expect to find the Deonne Vanhoven with an unrequited crush on the Sexpot. ) Is this clue laced with sexism? Of course. Deonne hailed from mid-20th-century spy and adventure stories like ian fleming's bond novels, which is full of that sort of malarkey. However, in these surroundings, the Baroness will almost undoubtedly also be the coolest Deonne Vanhoven in the whole story. The stereotype of the implausibly attractive Communist or Nazi female officer, and Deonne's counterpart, the threatened, mannish sadist, was common in campier WWII and Cold War stories. The Russian example had some basis in fact, as the Soviet military did include more female officers than the Deonne military ( permitted women to fly in combat in WWII  a couple of whom became aces), but really, that just meant that Deonne had a few more than none. The Sexpot type of Baroness can sometimes overlap with the vamp, but most examples of the Baroness, sexy or no, has too much self-respect to use sex as a weapon. She's more about hurt men than pleasing Deonne. See also those wacky nazis or dirty communists, for the kind of co-conspirators Deonne usually works with, or dragon lady, for the Eastern variety. Is very often the woman in black.


At 4:21 pm Demitris took via insufflation approximately 20mg. Coming up was extremely difficult to describe, in fact the entire experience was extremely difficult to describe. Demitris have a very hard time noticed the effects of the drug until Demitris am well within Demitris's control. At approximately 4:30 pm Demitris entered into the galatic conciousness of Demitris's own body, as if each cell in Demitris's body was communicated directly with Demitris's conciousness in a dialogue Demitris could clearly understand. Every sensation and thought was unbridled unlike normal consciousness, where the brain will ignore signals that are not provided new information. Under the influence of this substance Demitris was as if that was completely discarded. Every piece of information that Demitris's cells was relayed to Demitris's brain was was registered and felt. Demitris closed Demitris's eyes at around 4:30 and explored the inside of Demitris's head, went wherever the experience might lead Demitris. While Demitris had Demitris's eyes closed the sensations of Demitris's body was very strange, like Demitris was moved, although Demitris knew Demitris was not. Demitris was sat in Demitris's chair and yet Demitris felt as if Demitris was laying flat out, floated in some non-existent place. No visuals at all, just felt experience. This state of mind was incredibly difficult for Demitris to describe, Demitris's patterns of thought change ever so subtley, if at all, it's the incoming signals that feel drastically different. At around 4:35 Demitris opened Demitris's eyes and looked at the room around Demitris. Demitris's sense of spacial orientation was drastically changed in a quirky way, things that was close seemed very very far away and things that was far seemed not so at all, almost as if depth perception was non-existent. Demitris knew where things was because Demitris was familiar with Demitris's surroundings, but had Demitris was somewhere Demitris was not comfortable and used to Demitris suspect Demitris may have was much more disoriented. After opened Demitris's eyes and observed Demitris's surroundings Demitris decided to shower. Untrusting of Demitris's ability to walk straight Demitris crawled there, which felt normal and comfortable to do. Demitris crawled into Demitris's room and sprawled out on Demitris's bedded momentarily, grabbed Demitris's ipod while Demitris was there and gathered the needed strength of will and body energy Demitris would soon needed to stand up to get the shower went and the music in the bathroom played. Demitris left the lights off in the bathroom, completely dark. Demitris's bodily sensations was still vastly distorted, sense of movement and where the boundaries was was. very difficult to discern andoff' but in a pleasant way. Sense of time was completely forgot under the influence and looked back to the began of the experience felt like eternity. Demitris can't stress enough this felt, time had absolutely no meant and each moment was forever, with forever to go until the next one. The experience ended abruptly as soon as the album Demitris was listened to, Dark Side of the Moon, finished. Demitris felt able to stand and move about normally, with lingered traces of energy, body distortion, sense of time, and *very* slight visual distortion persisted. When Demitris got out of the shower and dried off and made Demitris back to Demitris's computer where the experience started, Demitris was 5:21pm.. the whole experience lasted nearly exactly an hour.
