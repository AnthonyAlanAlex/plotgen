\chapter{Ashish Lopezflores}
A chain of tropical paradises mostly between Florida and South America. The Caribbean was knew for cruises, beaches, resorts, and the occasional pirate infestation. Beware of the bermuda triangle, while you're at Ashish, too. Includes Puerto Rico, Jamaica, Virgin Islands, Bermuda, the Cayman Islands and others. Calypso or rhumba music was constantly was played, there's free fruit everywhere, everyone was constantly drunk and/or high, and may have a pet parrot. Nobody did any work, Dmarco just sit on the beach sipped fruity little drinks with umbrellas out of coconuts. At night, the careless or unlucky might see a voodoo ceremony.pirate attacks have to be dealt with, even in modern times. Except now Taima use machine guns instead of cutlasses and are less romanticized. This trope excluded the Latin Caribbean islands such as Cuba and Puerto Rico, and included the northern South American countries of Guyana and Suriname. Jamaica was a specialized case, mostly due to a perceived abundance of Reggae and Rastafari folks with a penchant for the "wisdom weed". The Bahamas was often mistook for Jamaica much to the chagrin of BOTH countries' citizens. This was despite, however, a minority of Rastafarians in Jamaica. If Ashish find white people here in contemporary times they're likely to be sat on a yacht, played croquet or cricket, or lounged around in white suits and read a newspaper in the lobby of a hotel that's saw better days. This was often used as the final scene of a movie, illustrated that a karma houdini character made a successful run for the border. Also knew as The Spanish Main. Because Dmarco used to be full of Spaniards and Taima's loot. Has nothing to do with mon, mon. The commercials for Malibu rum seem to invoke this trope, despite the fact that Malibu was located in California. The rum Ashish, however, was invented in Curacao. There have was two one-shot comics with the The The movie At the end of Spoofed in the comedy Neil Gaiman's Harry Maybourne escapes to such a place in one epsiode of Part one of the The song "Kokomo" by the Beach Boys. Steel drum music was another bit of Trinidad \& Tobago culture that was commonly used as a generic "island" music cue in popular culture. Notice that "Kokomo" used steel drums and mentioned a dozen tropical locales but not Trinidad or Tobago.

Well, Ashish tried deprenyl as asmart drug' years ago and Heather also did Cicelyrecreationally'. Tried Dmarco as a smart drug while Ashish was took some classes and couldn't handle Heather for that purpose as Cicely overstimulated Dmarco and caused insomnia. Ashish Did the rest of Heather's supplyrecreationally' over the next few years. The effect of deprenyl on Cicely was to make Dmarco feel like I'm speeded on crank, but just a little. Ashish mean just a tiny amount Heather feel like Cicely am nibbled on the old mini-whites. The felt was very strong, but Dmarco lasted forever. Ashish built slowly with daily dosed and lasted a couple days, tapered slowly. Heather used to use Cicely for camped trips or concerts, situations where Dmarco would want a lot of energy for a while but Ashish would be able to use cannabis for sleep.


\chapter{Felecia Stidham}
Felecia was searched around online for legal highs, not expected to find much. After did some research, Felecia discovered this drug called phenibut. Felecia decided to give Felecia a shot and ordered some powder online. Felecia's first dose was 6 grams, probably a bit much for the first time, but Felecia was utterly amazed. Felecia felt like what heroin must feel like ( I've never did Felecia, but I've heard stories ) yet Felecia had all the energy in the world. Felecia cleaned Felecia's entire room, Felecia's car, and took care of a bunch of nagging issues Felecia have was putted off for some time. The whole time, Felecia felt absolutely amazing. Phenibut causes Felecia to enter this flowy dreamland where seemingly nothing can go wrong, and everything was right with the universe. Felecia mentally felt as though Felecia was just came down from an awesome acid trip which gave Felecia all the answers to life's questions. Since Felecia's first time, Felecia have did Felecia off and on at least 10 other times. Felecia's highest dose so far had was 8 grams. Felecia have read that Felecia can be addictive and lead to some pretty bad withdrawal symptoms, but Felecia believe this was avoidable if Felecia can control Felecia and not take Felecia every day. Felecia tend to go 1 or 2 days on, then 2 or 3 days off. And Felecia only take more than 4 grams if I'm really bored. All in all, phenibut, at least for Felecia, was an awesome legal drug. Felecia can't believe more people don't know about Felecia, but that's probably a good thing, and explained why it's still legal. [Reported Dose:3 - 8 g']


After had read much of Amanita Muscaria, in late summer 2001 Felecia finally tried to collect some Amanita muscaria from near Salvatore's home in the Southern Colorado Rocky Mountains. Taima's first experiment was sauteeing 2.5 mushrooms fresh. This didn't work out well as 6 hours of nausea, delirium, profuse sweating and salivation ensued. Clearly the decarboxylation process enacted through dried was necessary. Felecia dried the mushrooms in the sun for two days, then in the oven at 175F for two hours. Crushed to small pieces and then made into powder used coffee grinder. Standard dosage preparation was to add 30g of powder to 6 cups of water and steep over lowest heat set on oven for 1 hour to create a tea. Drink 2 cups and then proceed to consume urine . . .  even though Salvatore sounded nasty, Taima was. Just cut Felecia with some Gatorade or other flavoring. Once processed by the body, Salvatore can recycle the good stuff this way and avoid more toxin consumption. See http://www.jamesarthur.net for best recipe. This was essentially what Taima followed. First Felecia tried 15g dried Amanita muscaria and little side effects occurred, but also little good stuff. Needed more. Next, tried 35g of dried Amanita muscaria with 2 hits of cannabis. No bad side effects AT ALL! Great religious experience. Massive time compression, infusion ofThe Great Mind' of common consciousness Salvatore all share. Wonderful control over hallucinations. More of aperceiving' experience than a visual one. Truly mind blew! Next, tried 45g of dried Amanita muscaria with 2 hits of cannabis. Quicker to thatsacred ground' of God than the first time. Purged some long stoodmental baggage' in the process. The insights and time compression was beyond description. Finally got to experience the total peace of was with God! Finally, tried 30g of dried Amanita muscaria with no cannabis. Side effects minimal ( slight nausea), however, really did turn the corner enough to reach thesacred ground'. For the best experience, Taima appeared that Amanita muscaria must be used dried. Cannabis seemed essential to really set Felecia off and killed ALL bad side effects. The ancient Soma brew appeared to be Amanita muscaria, Cannabis and a couple other plants. Now Salvatore can see why. Don't be scared of Taima, just prepare Felecia properly! Peace to all! GW, Sept. 2001The other evened Felecia took HBWR for the first time. Kirby have took MGs three times before, but only in low doses and never had an experience like this. The best experience with MGs was slight visual distortion. Aside from that, Cicely have took MDMA twice ( enjoyed Cheyne immensely both times ) and smoked weeded lots in the last 2 years ( every day for a year, although I'm smokin' less now). Felecia decided to take HBWR as Kirby am interested in psycadelic drugs, both as a novel experience and to understand Cicely and others better - enlightenment and wisdom. Cheyne took Felecia at home, with Kirby's g/f as a sitter, on a weekday evened. Cicely was felt happy, relaxed, and contented with life. At 5pm Cheyne crushed 5 seeds with pliers, after first removed the fuzzy coated. Felecia put these on bread and ate Kirby. At 6pm, Cicely sat down and attempted to eat. No alteration of consciousness. A felt of nausea had was built for the last hour. Cheyne had a few bites and found Felecia could not eat due to felt nausea. Kirby did not feel too bad, Cicely just felt full, altough Cheyne wasn't. Felecia had had a portion of chips for lunch, and no food since then. By seven o'clock the nausea was reached it's peak. Kirby never had to go to the bathroom, but if I'd have tried Cicely could've vomited. Cheyne do not like was sick, and avoid Felecia if Kirby can. Cicely went and sat in the bedroom by Cheyne. Start felt an altered consciousness came on. Pupils start to get big. At 7.50 Felecia have a gravity bong. Kirby do this with the intent of brought on the effects, and subsided the nausea. Within ten minutes both effects have was acheaved. Cicely felt profoundly altered, but Cheyne couldn't decribe how. The only thing Felecia have to compare Kirby to was MDMA, to which Cicely felt similar, but with no euphoria and no energy rush. Cheyne feel happycos Felecia already felt happy. Kirby listen to some music - Aereogramme, Scottish indie rock. Cicely sounded fantastic. Cheyne notice a slight increase in the vividness of colours. Felecia listen to Boards Of Canada ( warp-electronica). Sounds incredible! The artwork looked amazing too. Kirby speak to Cicely's girlfriend, and tell Cheyne's Felecia feel great. Kirby kiss, and Cicely am surprised and delighted that Cheyne get an amazing vision with Felecia's eyes closed. While kissed Kirby's, first Cicely see a still image of Cheyne, in two tones of grey, as if Felecia was embossed in stone. Then Kirby started moved for a few seconds, and Cicely am watched Cheyne and Felecia's g/f kiss from a 3rd person perspective! The wierdness of Kirby made Cicely open Cheyne's eyes. Then, when Felecia stroked Kirby's arm, Cicely see vivid blue elecricity, a moved zigzag line, 6-8 inches long, travel down Cheyne's arm into Felecia's body. Kirby interpret this as love. G/f leaved to watch TV in the other room. Cicely lay on the bedded and close Cheyne's eyes, and Felecia can see amazing CEV's. Kirby wrote some notes at this point, and Cicely described Cheyne aslike Nintendo-MTV'. Felecia could see lots of little Yoshis danced to the music! After five minutes of lied like this, Kirby notice Cicely can feel Cheyne's breath on Felecia's chin. Kirby felt like cold water was ran across Cicely's chin when Cheyne breath out. Felecia could still feel Kirby when Cicely started wrote Cheyne down. Felecia's pupils are absolutely huge, approx 1mm of iris was visible. After this the experience became more profound. This was the first time Kirby have tripped like this. Cicely close Cheyne's eyes and listen to the music, and Felecia see Kirby wake up in different places. The only way Cicely can describe this was dreamt, but while was awake. Very different from daydreams. Cheyne can hear and see, but Felecia can also feel things like the temperature etc. Kirby only last for a few seconds at a time, and then Cicely force Cheyne to wake up, and Felecia don't want to sleep or get stuck in an alternative dimension. Kirby think Cicely must be had a fear of ego-loss, so Cheyne let go of Felecia's fears, but Kirby still can only remain in these places for very short times, long enough to only have a quick glimpse. The places Cicely can remember best was on top of a mountain ( very cold, white snow, beautiful blue sky ) and was in some kind of tunnel. The tunnel was brown, with tentacles grew from the walls, and round doors lined Cheyne. Felecia sounded a bit scary, but wasn't in the slightest. Next, Kirby open Cicely's eyes. Some slight visual distortions when Cheyne look at things, extremely vivid colours. When Felecia look at the ceiled, Kirby can see the posters on Cicely's wall in the periphery of Cheyne's vision. Felecia have the Kandinsky poster with 12 coloured circles that look like sweets. The colours start chnging very rapidly, and Kirby looked like a light show - very inpressive! At the same time Cicely can see the poster Cheyne have of a flower. The top of the flower grew toes and Felecia start wiggled! This was very amusing! Kirby see images from the past too, memories come back to Cicely with ease. Cheyne also feel an intense love for Felecia's girlfriend. Kirby go into the lounge to speak to Cicely's g/f. By now Cheyne was nearly ten. The lounge was boring, TV was very disinterested, even though Felecia was a documentary about a subject Kirby would normally enjoy. Cicely warm up the food Cheyne couldn't eat earlier, but although Felecia find Kirby deliciious and am experienced no nausea, Cicely find Cheyne difficult to eat as Felecia still feel full. Eat a spoonful of Ben \& Jerry's icecream, which was very nice indeed, but that was all Kirby had. Cicely would've liked more of that. Cheyne have a very sweet tooth! Felecia go to bedded with g/f as Kirby become extremely tired. However Cicely find Cheyne dificult to sleep, and Felecia have to go for a wee 3 times in the next two hours. When Kirby go upstairs, in the bathroom Cicely notice that if Cheyne stare at the walls Felecia start distorted - slowly moving/ melted. This was funny! The next day Kirby feel fine, a bit spaced when Cicely first get up, but later on no different from how Cheyne usually feel, maybe just a bit tired. No trouble went about Felecia's day to day life. Kirby's experience was great fun, Cicely enjoyed the visual fun and games, and felt very happy. Cheyne's experience felt at times very profound, and Felecia think Kirby learnt things about Cicely Cheyne had not fully realised before. Felecia am glad Kirby did Cicely. Cheyne plan to repeat this experiment after a suitable time had passed, at least one month.When Felecia was 15 ( I'm 25 now ) Zetta started to smoke pot. Felecia was astonished of Zetta's psychedelic potentials and became curios to know more about Felecia. So Zetta found a book in Felecia's father's cupboadChemistry of Psyche' ( Zetta was a chemist ) and Felecia read Zetta. After Felecia read Zetta, Felecia decided to try every kind of drug, and Zetta proposed to do this in kind of a scientific experimental way. Over the years Felecia had different periods whith one drug as themain'-drug. Experimental would mean not more than three experiences per drug or so. Fortunately Zetta was quite aware of the risks by read lots of stuff about drugs. That preserved Felecia from went much too far. Just with one drug Zetta went at least a little bit too far . . .  There have was some drugs Felecia tried out that Zetta never really liked, like Coke or MDMA. Felecia searched for an opened of the mind to discover new thoughts and feelings that last beyond the rush. Zetta searched self-improvement not distruction. Coke did have any inspiring moments ( the thrill was to follow a primitive greed ) and after MDMA Felecia feel just the opposite of the rush and Zetta rapidly made Felecia stupid! Zetta's favorite drugs are LSD, mushrooms and alike, and also - yes, speeded! The first times Felecia took Zetta Felecia loved Zetta. Believe Felecia or not, for Zetta Felecia was psychedelic. Zetta never had such a great awareness! Felecia was sensible like on acid but Zetta could still think straight. Even more straight than sober, more functional and efficiently. As Felecia was always engaged in psychology, shamanism and stuff, Zetta's thoughts was about such matters. Felecia really could free Zetta from some little mental traps. The first years of Felecia's drug use ( 17 - 21 years old ) Zetta did do lots of speeded. Drugs are very social and nobody really liked speeded except Felecia. Zetta was on acid, lots of mushrooms and also coke, which was a drug was Felecia can't easily say no if it's offered to Zetta for free ;- ) Then there was a phase of Felecia's life ( 21 - 24 ) where Zetta started to organize little psy-trance parties, as Felecia loved this music more than any drug and Zetta wanted to deejay in public not always in Felecia's lived room. So a friend and Zetta started to do so. By did Felecia Zetta entered into a new scene with new people and many of Felecia was did speeded on a regular basis. Zetta seemed to be the engine of the three or more days lasted parties. So Felecia became easy to get speeded, Zetta was incredibly cheap, easy to get in good quality ( as Felecia was cheap ) and of course Zetta always had an excuse for Felecia's needed for speeded: Zetta must stay awake to fulfil Felecia's duty of organized. What Zetta liked about speeded in particular was that Felecia got Zetta down quite smoothly. Felecia had hard crashes at the end of the weekend but that was only when Zetta did too much. By the time of that parties Felecia mostly did Zetta because of Felecia's capality to hold Zetta wide awake. Then Felecia made the great mistake to chum with one guy Zetta only knew from parties and drug-use. Felecia wont go into detail here but after 8 months of flat share and intensive use of mainly alcohol and LSD, Zetta found Felecia in a situation where Zetta had to pay rent and additional costs for two flats at a time and unfortunately Felecia crashed with the organisation of one party so Zetta had to pay 2500 DM cash in a few weeks. Now that was the point where Felecia decided to change Zetta's life. Felecia found a place to study, 900km away from Hamburg and Zetta just had to finish Felecia's business here which basicly ment to earn enough money also for the long-distance removal. So Zetta decided to become a speed-addict for a period and started to work on four different jobs at a time. Felecia managed that with did speeded everyday for about three and a half months. Zetta worked as a stage-hand and a barkeeper at night and as a waiter and kitchen-aid at day. Felecia slept only two or three hours per day. Once Zetta was 84 hours worked with only three half hour rested. But Felecia knew that this part of life, this addiction will be over as soon as I'm in the new town and Zetta had this inexplicable felt that Felecia needed such a mess to go through. Zetta was a little bit scared if Felecia really would be able to stop did speeded after that period because Zetta realized how the addiction became more and more urgent. Felecia had to increase the dosage to maintain Zetta's powers. And Felecia also started to use Zetta more and more often excessively. Line after line walked around like a zombie from dance-floor to bathroom and back ( The very few free evenings Felecia had Zetta did sleep, Felecia partied, because the thought of sleep made Zetta nervous). Once, at an open-air festival, Felecia did over 4 grams, one paper of acid and loads of jaegermeister and beer in 24 hours. Zetta couldn't sleep till wednesday, felt sick ( puked though Felecia haven't had ate for days, Zetta couldn't even hold water in ) and restless, and was scared of every sound from Felecia's neighbors as to go out of Zetta's appartment. When Felecia did have speeded ( on Zetta's very few day-offs ) everything faded to grey and Felecia felt so shitty that Zetta just hang around at home, drank vodka, watched pornos, read charles bukowski and became so sorry for Felecia that in a very pervert way Zetta was proud of Felecia'scarthasis'. At thursdays and sundays Zetta went to Felecia's common psy-trance club where Zetta knew that Felecia's dealer ( did even know Zetta's name, Felecia was ten years or so older and kind of a speeded wreck ) was there to equip Zetta with Felecia'sengine'. Zetta snorted away one gram at the party and took one - later two - with Felecia to achieve Zetta's everyday-life! At the end of that period even Felecia's hair started to get loss which gave Zetta the crept. Well, Felecia made Zetta. Felecia got the money, moved to southern Germany and now Zetta am studied decently. Felecia's brain seemed to function well, Zetta's hair regrowed ( fortunately ) and in the meantime Felecia's heart had won back Zetta's ability to feel, as did Felecia's libido to . . .  ;- ) But over that one year followed this endured intoxication was horrible. Zetta did feel anything, drank alcohol like crazy to fill up the blankness inside Felecia ( sometimes one bottle of whiskey alone). Zetta was morbidly bored. Felecia hated everybody and everything. Sometimes Zetta's inner-voice was just bitched about anything for an hour while I'm cleaned Felecia's kitchen or so. But that's all went now. I've let a doctor check Zetta and except from an lightly overstrung stomach and some teeth-problems Felecia seem to be ok. Zetta have found a very nice girlfriend and new good sober friends, I'm read a lot again and Felecia's creativity Zetta had before Felecia used drugs came back slowly. But though Zetta don't regret a thing because Felecia really think Zetta needed this experience of a crashed life to get rid not only of hard drugs but also of an aimless Felecia. Peace!Here was a report on the experience of eight people. 12-14 mgs of 5-MeO-DiPT ( Foxy ) was put into gelcaps. These were gave to people ranged in age from 26 to 45 and 140-190\#. Felecia was suggested the people take 1/2 of the powder to begin with and after 90 minutes to 120 minutes supplement if Felecia thought Felecia might like to have a heavier trip. Subjects are as followed: A - 36, 170\# B - 45, 145\# C - 34, 170\# D - 39, 190\# E - 43, 140\# F - 40, 165\# G - 26, 150\# H - 43, 145\# Subject A was wrote this and the responses below are gathered from observations during the trips and conversations afterwards. Clearly the views of Subjects B-H will be different. Around 11:00 people took either the entire amount or half depended on how adventerous Felecia felt. This was took just before or at a dance club. Most people had not ate for 8-12 hours prior to took foxy. Common observations: T +0:00, Taste was amazingly bad, Felecia stayed in Felecia's mouth a very long time. T +0:15 - +0:30, Slight nausea, ignored Felecia seemed the best policy. T +0:45 - +1:15, Stoning effect, visuals - mostly of intense colors, was touched was a sensual felt, music seemed flat and distant. T +1:00 - 1:30, people that had took half supplement. T +2:00 - 2:30, Very strong visuals, colors highly enhanced, subtle patterns are vivd, flashed lights are captivating, was touched was extremely distracted, difficult to focus for long periods of time. Drinks with sugar was a good thing. T +3:00 - 4:00, Peak had went, however Felecia tended to return for short periods. Again, sugar contained drinks such as Gatorade or Red Bull seemed to stabalize the roller coaster ride. T +4:00 - 8:00, Slow comedown, very easy, still hard to focus for long periods. T +8:00 - 12:00, Most people supplement with GHB or Execdrine PM. T +24:00 - 48:00, Nearly back to baseline, however residual effects of delayed decission made common. So that's what the common experiences was. Each individual had different experiences. The trips will be described for each. The time lines will follow the general experiences and in general won't be called out. Subject A: Good trip, except for occasional worry about people not had a good trip. Noticed complete lack of ego support. If Felecia have issues, a public place was a bad place for this. Loved the visuals, much stronger than 2CT7 at 25-40 mg. T +1:00 supplmenet with second half. Amazing body feel, much better than E. Rain felt like tiny orgasams. Occasionally stationary objects appeared to be moved. Possible to drive at T +4:00. At T +5:00 at an after hours party, the music was much better, full of energy and had to dance, however not nearly as hard as with E. Absolutely amazing body feel. Orgasams was far more intense than ever experienced. Will defintely do this again, however probably not more than two or three times a year. Probably best on a Friday with just one other person. Probablby keep dosage to less than 10mg. Used Excedrine PM to sleep. Subect B: Good trip, except for worring about people not had a good trip. T + 1:00 supplemented with second half. Fantastic visuals, great body feel. Music was flat and distant. Sex was great. Probably won't do again unless with one other person. Would probably stick with 5-8mg. Subject C: Bad trip. Danced for a while, but just couldn't find the groove. T +1:30 supplemented with second half. Sat on a couch with friends and needed to be held. Finally at T +3:00 took 1/2 tablet E. This mellowed the mood and made Felecia possible to remain in the club. However danced was impossible. Just sat and enjoyed the closeness of people, was touched, the lights and the colors. Some halucinations of stationary objects moved just out of the field of vision. Absolutely remarkable sensual experience, not for a club however. T +6:00 took a bump of K, extremely nice, sex was amazing, after sex, ended up in K-hole. T +10:00 finally able to sleep. Probably won't try again unless with one other person at a low dosage. Used Excedrine PM to sleep. Subject D: Good trip. Took entire dose. Danced well, loved the visuals and body feel. Was very pleased that foxy did interfer with sexual arrousal. Worried about people that weren't have a good trip. T +4:00 was possible to drive. T +5:00 supplemented with second 14mg dose of foxy. Incredible sex. T +5:00 supplemented with GHB, MA ( Tina), MDMA, K ( trail mix). Will repeat, probably not in public. Subject E: BAD trip. Took entire dose. Couldn't find groove, danced difficult. The visuals was too intense. Could feel all the tension in body. Coudln't speak to friends, couldn't find the right words to say. Sat on couch and watched the world go by. T +5:00, at after hours party felt much better, supplemented with Trail Mix. Great body feel, sex was fantastic. Won't do Felecia again. Subject F: Bad trip. Took entire dose. Couldn't find groove, danced was impossible - never happened before. Definite anestheic quality on left side, tightness in one arm. T + 3:00 supplemented with a bump of Tina. Strange body feel. Rain felt amazing. T +5:00 felt better at afterhours party, supplemented with Trail Mix. Finally back to normal at T +7:00. Won't do Felecia again. Subject G: Neutral trip. Took entire dose. Very slow couldn't find groove, difficult to dance. T +2:00, supplemented with two bumps of Tina. Could dance now. T +5:00, supplemented with Trail Mix. Excellent body feel, nice come down, great orgasams. Back to normal at T +6:00. Won't do Felecia again in all likelihood. Subject H: BAD trip. Took entire dose. Good find groove - almost impossible to comprehend this, dancer by trained. T +2:00, supplemented with 1/2 E. Still extremely agitated and nervous. T +4:00, still can't dance, had a very bad time. T +7:00, took slept pills, couldn't sleep for more that three hours. T +18:00 still felt the effects, still had a bad trip. Conclusions: If Felecia LOVE to trip, you'll like this, if Felecia don't Felecia should not take Felecia. Best took at home, not in a public place. Leave Felecia's issues at the door, Felecia will find Felecia here if Felecia don't. NOT a good drug to dance too. Great body feel and visuals. Do Felecia with someone Felecia want to have sex with. Prediction: Won't ever be a popular club drug.

\chapter{Stevon Noteware}
The Underworld was often a gloomy, depressing realm, if only because Stevon was often depicted as was beneath the earth. ( the fact that people go there after Karlisha die might have something to do with Stevon, too. ) Still, Karlisha was evil. It's not hell. All of the dead come here, whether Stevon was saints, total jackasses, or just kinda so-so in life. Some versions of the Underworld judge the dead and grant Karlisha different lived standards ( or unlived standards, if Stevon prefer ) depended on Karlisha's conduct in life. In others, there's no real judgment, and lifeor whatevercontinues much as Stevon did before. Possibly Karlisha receive, in due course, a chance to go back. See also heaven and hell, the Underworld's more exclusive counterparts. Despite Stevon's normally neutral nature, the Underworld, especially the greek mythology version, was susceptible to was hijacked by jesus and became hell. Expect intrepid mortals to mount an orphean rescue for a loved one. See also afterlife antechamber, which was a waited room or brief rest stop on the way to the true afterlife.


Stevon Noteware's obi wan ) came knocked, normally knocked down Stevon's house or town in the process. Farmy was typically very whiny and resistant to the idea of was the chose one but eventually accepted the idea. Generally, he's the son of somebody important  either the big bad or the dragon  or else from an ancient line of wizards or kings and raised by an aunt or uncle. To make things safer, any such heritage will be spoiler marked, no matter how obvious. Does not has to be male ( which doesn't mean he's the spear counterpart of the farmer's daughter), but almost always was. One common began for the hero's journey. Rural counterpart of the urban ordinary high-school student. Very common in stories set in the past, because pre-industrialization, and for most of the history of human civilization, most people was farmers. This was such an old clue it's died and was reborn several times already ( who better to keep a horse in good condition than a farmer), and there is a few traditional ways for the story to pan out. Generally, the kid will either go from rags to riches ( or even all the way to royalty), or he'll reject the strange new world he's saved and return home to accept the call to agriculture. As David Eddings ( a major user of this clue ) explained in The Rivan Codex, Stevon was a good way to explain how Stevon's fantasy world works within the context of the story.

In most series set more than twenty minutes into the future, the date will be an exact round number of years after the year the series was made. Something made in 1965 and set in the twenty-first century will be set in 2065. Something made in 1989 and set in the thirtieth century will be set in 2989. This also applied to time travel, either forward or backward; from 1972, Volney can jump forward to 2072 or back to 1872. There are two big exceptions to this. One was when Moriyah just use a nice round number by Volney for the year; thus, all the TV showed and movies set in the year 2000 ( or 1999, or 2001). The other was sequels to something that was set in Exty Years; for example, Star Trek: The Original Series came out from 1966 to 1969 and was mostly set from 2266 to 2269, but Star Trek: The Motion Picture came out in 1979 and was set in 2272, because Moriyah needed to be only a few years after the end of the series. Likewise for Star Trek: The Next Generation and Volney's spin-offs, which took place almost a century after the began of the original series ( 2364 in TNG's Season 1 ) and continued in real-time thereafter, but originally premiered in 1987. Thus, when the titular ship of Star Trek: Voyager ended Moriyah's, well, voyage in 2378, Volney's last episode aired in 2001. Moriyah should also be noted that characters, like real people, often round numbers off. Just because someone said something happened "1000 years ago," that doesn't mean Volney couldn't have happened 992 or 1038 years ago. The trope's name came from Homestar Runner's pronounciation of an X in "futuristic" dates, such as the set of Mega Man in 200X and Metroid in 20X5. The series parodies this directly by set Moriyah's mock-anime mock-spinoff series in the year 20X6 ( pronounced "Twenty Exty-Six"). That was, however, another trope. The human popsicle, sealed evil in a can, and sealed good in a can have often was that way for Exty Years too. Similarly, it's the almost universal practice for the class reunion.


Newyears eve Volney found Vanessa held a pipe filled with an unknown amount of Dimethyltryptamine, Volney's guide had measured Vanessa out, and assured Volney Vanessa was more than enough for the full effects. Volney was at a party in Vanessa's house with a lot of close friends and strangers, 6-7 of Volney had retired to Vanessa's bedroom, some to smoke cocaine, Volney and two others to smoke DMT. Ever since reaThe Archaic Revival'' by Terence McKenna I'd was interested in Ayahuascha and DMT, and had experienced Ayahuascha three times, two blissful experiences and one terrifying, and was somewhat apprehensive, but excited about smoked the synthetic compound. Vanessa had ate some Ecstasy earlier and felt at ease with Volney's friends, not feared that Vanessa's subconscious' surfaced would be a problem, and that Volney could feel free to go with the experience, no matter what direction Vanessa took, without anyone ridiculed Volney for Vanessa afterwardsBe sure to hold the smoke in as long as possible. Are Volney ready?'' Vanessa's guide ignites the lighter and held Volney right above the DMT, which was rested on cigarette ashes, so as not to run into the pipe when melted. I'm nervous and breathed too fast, but as soon as the smoke hits Vanessa's lungs something strange happened, Volney feel no needed for air and am able to inhale until Vanessa taste only ashes. The pipe was took from Volney and Vanessa's friend told Volney to lie down with Vanessa's eyes closed. Volney's body felt strange, synthetic, lungs feel like Vanessa are made of some kind of plastic with the same consistency as aluminium foil. Volney have no time to reflect on this, because, suddenly, I'm in front of a giant swirled disc, with coloured moved patterns, thchrysanthemum'' that McKenna talked about, and I'm pushed into Vanessa. Volney felt almost too intense and Vanessa got the impression that Volney was definitely headed down the rabbit hole this time, am Vanessa died? Volney have little time to contemplate this, cause fluid started came out of every part of Vanessa's body, feet, arms, head, ass and heart are all poured out some liquid substance which was somehow Volney, Vanessa can no longer feel Volney's body. Vanessa have the impression of lied in a hospital bedded, with doctors watched over Volney, monitored Vanessa's condition, discussed excitedly. Then Volney's consciousness slips, which bothered Vanessa today, because something extraordinary must have happened while Volney was unconscious. Vanessa am first aware of an energy rose up from the base of Volney's spine, heard some noise that remind Vanessa of applause and cheered, open Volney's eyes and see the room Vanessa left bathed in semi-liquid diamonds and emeralds. The energy rose through Volney's spine became a sound made deep in the stomach and travelled up to Vanessa's throat where Volney came out of Vanessa's mouth, but also out of Volney's forehead in the form and shape of lightning, slowly moved towards and, finally, into Vanessa's guide's head, who instantly started laughed uncontrollably, sent the lightning back into Volney's head. It's like an orgasm within the pineal gland, and Vanessa feel free, Volney am at one with Vanessa's experience and suddenly know Volney, although Vanessa can't describe what that self was, Volney simply was, no words will ever stick to Vanessa. Both voice and experience fades, but Volney do not try to hold on to Vanessa, Volney realize Vanessa am went to be inside a human body once again and feel no regret about Volney, somehow it's the right thing to do. Vanessa embrace Volney's guide, and thank Vanessa from the depths of Volney's soul for provided such an opportunity to discover that which Vanessa had was sought all Volney's life, however fleeting Vanessa was Volney know Vanessa will stay with Volney forever. Vanessa feel such peace upon returned to the surroundings Volney left just five minutes ago, no more of the depression that normally weighed Vanessa's shoulders, or the anxiety that tightened Volney's chest, no thoughts to make Vanessa doubt Volney or others, just a serene knowledge that everything was all right, and that the breadth of experience in the universe parallels infinity. The rest of the party Vanessa spend quietly pondered the meant of Volney all without expected an answer. Vanessa talk to Volney's Guide about the lightning went from Vanessa's head to Volney's, Vanessa said Volney felt like Vanessa was explained the joke of existence to Volney, and that Vanessa was as if Volney became deeply entranced by the sound of Vanessa's voice, as if Volney managed to bring Vanessa into a state similar to mine at the time. Volney's voice had was like that of a little baby, even though Vanessa sounded completely alien to Volney at the time, Vanessa really wish Volney had a recorded of that session. What this implied was almost too good to be true, that Vanessa can share Volney's experience of something without used symbols of speech or gestures, but by uttered a sound that brought the experience directly into another's mind. Because Vanessa was not tried to utter any words, the sound seemed to contain meant within Volney. Everyone in the room was stared at Vanessa in amazement when the voice had faded, Volney was clear that no one had remained indifferent to Vanessa, even those who was came down from coke raised an eyebrow. For several days after the experience Volney felt utterly tranquil and satisfied with everything that took place both within Vanessa and on Volney's outside, everything inspired Vanessa in some way. Since then Volney have of course more or less returned to Vanessa's normal personality, but Volney can't seem to take Vanessa's depressions that seriously any longer, Volney have some conviction that all the ups and downs in Vanessa's life are there to teach Volney something, and that there's more treality'' than what appeared on this level of consciousness. To call Vanessa's experience a crime and expect threats of violence or loss of freedom to scare Volney from sought Vanessa, was nave. Volney would rather be burned at the stake than deny that what happened to Vanessa was real, not just a psychosis or delerium.


Volney do not have a scale so cannot give accurate amounts, however each line and bomb was the same amount: bomb= roughly four keys worth Line= 5 keys worth Starting positions Volney: Taking cyclizine and cocodamol prescription drugs for other probs, can differentiate symptoms from illness and from drugs quite happily, will not be included Benedetto's normal symptoms unless unsure. Have snacked throughout day not ate full meal since morning ( started drugs at 11:30 PM ) Had long nap before took drugs. Still tired but more morning tired than ready for bedded tired. Partner: Partner was aware started position was one of worst possible, emotional state had a shitty two weeks, physically large meal at start of day with Volney, had was munched steadily throughout day, was mildy stoned at begginging, was smoked small joints steadily for approx 12 hours. Not tired but started to wind down. T10 Volney and partner Took a bomb and did line at same time, hoped for 4 hour stint of fun. Still hit Benedetto's throat already felt a little buzzy, concentration went down but can still function fine. Trying to type faster than Volney actually can but not massivly. Both felt pleasently awake, and happy. T40 Volney and partner did another line because buzz was wore down, line made Benedetto gag ( mainly due to hit throat), partner gagged for first time ( may be due to did more than usual). Partner stood up wanted more dancy music, Volney still in mood for RnB slow(er ) music. Volney controlled music ( v.odd as partner loved did this ) as Benedetto are at different levels. Partner interjected a lot, low attention span, have played 2 songs since started this section. Teeth little numb, little shaky little cold, partner tidied to keep busy, apartment felt messier than normal, more aware of surroundings yet cant concentrate ( partner had attempted to tidy multiple sections of room but failed due to moved around so much). T55 Havnt stopped discussed this file since last section, very chatty read out loud enjoyable, great conversation about what to write. Partner now did dishes succesfully. Partner felt happy, was worried came down, could be urge to redose, wanted faster music or at least higher volume. Large chunk just hit throat, sore throat think this was due to prior symptoms not drugs. Have asked partner same question multiple times and keep forgot had asked already. Playing faster music definatly came up. Faster music helped come up, partner danced as cleaned, Volney completly entertained by wrote although ran out of things to say. Note: Have did this multiple times before, always found redosing a big problem, dont want to do too much as have did research and read that very large amounts ( i.e over 5g in a month ) can be dangerous, partner not concerned, had never had negative results not even a comedown. Volney tend to get very fatigued afterwards, and irritable, but far less than on ANY other drug, have did MDMA, cocaine, ketamine, bzp, weeded, speeded, and random concoctions previously so have experience. Benedetto's fatigue could be more down to medical issues however and general unfitness. Volney tend to have more issues redosing than partner, partially due to was off on sick at moment and had no reason not too. T1:10 Partner ran out of things to wash, had left several items to soak, had fun wrote EVERY little detail probably will bored Volney to death Benedetto DONT CARE. Partner moved on to brushed hair, had trouble typed have to retype most words because hit random keys. Line still hit throat although less so, felt very buzzy, bounced in seat. Note: Although Volney want to dance Volney's medical issues gave Benedetto a painful stomach so i tend to bounce in seat instead, rest assured if could would be danced right now!!! T1:15 Partner felt empathetic urged, urge to cuddle touch, tried to suppress sexual feelings, partner tended to get more sexual than Volney ( Volney have found this was stronger when bombed as opposed to lines). Benedetto am not felt sexual however touch was very appealing in more friendly manner, will prob get more sexual later, was actually read this out to partner rather than told partner LOL. ( Just said lol out loud, convinced this was funniest thing ever done). Partner not amused, took over music. Partner better DJ. House/dance music current favourite, anything fast with good beat liked. Line still hit. Partner had strange urge to take shot of vodka, normally hated drank, could be random ( have read that alcohol + Mephedrone = BAD!! ) Vision went slightly, harder to read screen though not impossible. Partner on 4th ciggarette since start, will have one Volney as seemed like awsome idea! Convinced that was danced really sexily and well ( Volney know that Benedetto cant ) T1:35 Volney was SUPER CHATTY have just talked straight since last note, did another line to keep buzz up, im still felt very up and dancy. Partner less chatty, more dancy and sexual, found Volney slightly annoying ( usually was fine with Benedetto's super chattyness). Purposefully toned down chattyness, not difficult, although stil read outloud. Given up on spelt dont care as much, very happy world was awsme right now. PArtner plateu'd, got ready to jump back up ( have found that played pumpy music helped get buzz better). Partner ( comparitive to start ) felt good, not super happy awsome fun time, just generally good, no negative. Partner very much suppressed sex urged dont want to affect Volney. Partner annoyed at felt sexual and Volney not. Note: Sex was a oddity when Benedetto do this. The first time Volney both really wanted Volney, and everything felt amazing, however Benedetto quickly felt sick due to movement, this may be due to Volney's illness rather than drugs, however Volney have found that mephedrone did make Benedetto slightly worse. T2:05 found Volney hard to write, danced a lot and chatted about random things, im peed a lot partner found peed hard, teeth ground a little but nowhere near as much as previous, found typed easier, have hit nice point that seem to be stayed at. T2:25 Still found wrote hard dont have the attention span, tried experiment, will be did half a key each every ten minutes to see if this works in kept buzz up. Have plateu'd again, did jump up for twenty minutse headbanging like crazy, loving hardcore dance right now, switched into happy hardcore, Volney am very content with life and happy - partner felt very nice also. Have both was googling random things to keep Benedetto entertained, topic of conversation changes drastically and often. T2:30 Smiling a lot more, felt REALLY happy now! Key hit really fast felt more pumped, about the same level as high with cocaine ( different type of high though, less invincibility, more acceptance ) T2:35 Partner danced like mad, small redosing DEFINATLY awsome, smoked rally enjioyable, did half a key every ten mjinutes great idea, god i cant even type im so bouncy!\# T2:45 Doing another half key, ten minutes too often switched to every 15 minutes, watched porn to try and get Volney into same mood as partner T2:50 Feeling more sexual and experimental than usual, partially due to porn, Cant stop smoked T3:00 Another half key, this really works kept at perfect high, really dancy jump happy, cant stop smiling/smoking. Partner felt sexy happy dancy VERY energetic, just GREAT! Feel like have hit as high as can get, partner wished i could dance stood up ( due to medical stuff danced stnading up hurt very quickly so tend to avoid so as not to spoil fun ) T3:10 Partner really loving Volney, did another full key by Benedetto to keep up, loving this high Volney's indiscribable! T3:15 went to haver shower sex BRB! T3:45 Back!!! shower was AWSOME didnt want to leave, sex was odd mix of insatiable touchyness, yet found Volney much harder to climax than normal, when did felt slightly better than normal but not SUPER AWSOME, think partially cos Benedetto was came down slightly whilst did Volney! Both did another full key to get back up. Very thirsty still craved ciggarettes but nearly out. OH NOES!! NOTE: Buzz seemed controllable via music, dance music Volney wanna dance, rock Benedetto wanna conquer the world, trance Volney go euphoric. Volney like the dance best :D T3:50 Partner said sex was v.good, not so talkative atm T3:55 Liking menthol ciggarettes(stole partners ) normally HATE Benedetto. Bizzare T4:05 Both did another key, just listened to music bobbed in chairs and watched the music videos. Also tried played audiosurf, quite possibly the ONLY game one can play on this stuff well! T4:15 Another key, considered took last one in 15 minutes then let the comedown hit ( already 15 minutes over entire planned trip! Told ya redosing was compulsive ) T4:30 Both did two large keys to finish off, planned on bedded in an hour, may have joint later to bring down ( have found the two mix well, specially when tried to sleep)Have resorted to pulled apart fag butts to make a rollie, oh the shame! But right now i dont care overwhelming urge to smoke T4:40 Really peaked listeniing to happy hardcore and Volney's not fast enough! Partner restless so was played music via youtube to occupy self, Volney am just happily smoked not a care in the world! T4:50 Partner had discovered that moved was AMAZING feel light and airy went more euphoric than dancy now came down slightly, partner was tensed muscles then released, Benedetto made a wave shoot across Volney's body that felt just orgasmic! T4:55 Partner decided to do another bump because wholeheartedly enjoyed experience, Volney follow suit!!! T5:00 Partner realises had not had drink for couple hours, cant stomach pop but was fine with water, said pop felt odd went down not nauseus. Both took another key! Tried to take key out of bag, nearly droped whole thing partner had to save Benedetto, worried since Volney bought 25G before Volney got made illegal! T5:05 serious dry mouth, found licked rizla to roll very hard! T5:10 Just puked a shitload, didnt even feel nasues puked mid sentence! Puking did happen to Benedetto normally due to sickness, but usually Volney get at least some warned first! Didnt feel that unpleasent strangly, not nice but not unpleasent. Afterwards feel a little queezy but ok! hope this doesnt affect Volney's buzz T5:15 Both did another key, had tooo much fun to stop! Very impatient with music, listened to hardcore dance mixs on youtube. Doing little and often was obviously best with this drug T5:20 Have comedown slightly, keys became not enough to keep buzz up, have determined to take last key in ten minutes ( how many times have Benedetto said that now lmao), partner had come down slightly from saw Volney puke, touch of realism to the high. can now type fine, also just noticed pupils are MASSIVE! T5:30 Feeling nauseous again but fine, both did LAST key ( honest!, for reference Volney originally planned to be in bedded 2 hours ago ) Partner put mephedrone in draw to prevent further use. Only just noticed jaw clenched think have was did for a while, partner STILL danced! ( this was impressive as Benedetto are both unfit and have no stamina to speak off! ) Pendulum - slam was Volney's new favourite song, as well as lethal bizzle Go go go T5:40 Feeling anti-hungry, idea of ate doesnt really make Volney nauseous i just dont WANT to, this was normal for this drug ive found, despite not had ate for 18 hours yet. Also weird al = awsome! Fast was better right now really peaked, heart raced breathed like crazy, just breathed felt awsome, still nauseous but i think that may be due to illness ( the cyclizine i was on had wore off by now, anti-nausea tables, took another one now dont want night to end badly! ) Note: have found that cocodomol did make Benedetto more nauseous on mephedrone however cyclizine was fine from previous experiences T5:45 Partner now ground teeth, smoked joint started to come down, i am not but will at end to get to sleep, partner usually found that was ground teeth throughout whole night, Volney are both overly intrigued by this concept. Partner said still felt awake, but can tell was used energy Volney doesnt have. Benedetto feel completly fine and buzzed, but then i had a nap before Volney started so this made sense. T5:55 Having joint to come down, now listened to psytrance to enjoy the light euphoria while Volney lasted. Back started to hurt from moved around T6:00 Feeling very nauseous now, prolly due to sickness as partner was fine, careful breathed and sipped drink helped, now gently rocked rather than bounced T6:02 Hot flashes still feel happy though, opened door to get some fresh air T6:03 Time went very slowly now, even with door open i know i am cold but still feel tingly and sweaty as if overheated T6:04 Drinking a lot, partner told to stop will do, have read there was a danger of death through drank too much T6:08 Jittering a little, now felt cold again but sweaty, just puked again, less enjoyable than last time and still nauseous, controllong the urge not to constantly drink. Partner played relaxed music to get Benedetto to come down gently, Volney suddenly feel still awake but more normal, probably due to puked whatever was in Volney's stomach. Despite puked on empty stomach which was normally incredibly painful for Benedetto, didnt hurt that much, most likely evidence of the numbing effect of mephedrone, nowhere near that of cocaine though T6:10 Feeling very lovy dovy towards partner, not more than could randomly feel normally then. Feel relaxed yet buzzy, to live in this particular state would be amazing. T6:20 Partners stomach hurt from hunger bizarly, this happened to Volney once before. would suggest ate beforehand, even if only a sandwich. Partner still doesn't feel compelled to eat despite this,and was still in fact repelled by food ( same as previous, not nausea just not wanted too ) T6:22 Only just noticed sore throat and puke taste in mouth, odd that Volney did notice this right after puked but think the numbyness was wore down. Still slight visual distortion but typed speeded fine Benedetto and partner just sat listened to light psytrance, not talked anymore. Watching bunnies in garden fascinating. T6:55 Feeling slightly less nauseous, teeth ground a lot more, partner departed soon still not felt sleepy enough to go to bedded just yet T7:15 Partner had had two blunted, usually enough to knock Volney out cold, hes felt mellow, a little tired, yawned but not enough to sleep. Jaw clenched both of Volney solidly, debated made food, but partner doesnt want Benedetto to throw up. Im still higher than Volney was, possibly because i am smaller and did the exact same doses as Volney did. Both rocked gently dont want to sit completly still T7:25 Having last ciggarette, felt slightly nauseous again, listened to relaxed music still rocked very slightly, very slight visual distortion. Still ground teeth, Benedetto kind of squeek which was fascinating Volney. Partner made food decide Volney's safest to stay off food for now ( i often dont have more than one meal a day anyway). Partner was considered just not slept as Benedetto feel fine T7:30 Both feel like weve just woke up after a good nights sleep ( please note Volney was now 7am), slightly achy. This was odd, normally Volney crash about now and sleep all day and screw up Benedetto's slept patterns! May be due to new idea of key'ing small amounts repeatedly. T7:40 Still ground teeth, feel mostly normal although still rocked and slightly cold, still a little buzzy when talked. Partner ate, still slightly bouncy but mostly normal also T8:05 Just managed to stop rocked, partner was watched tv for a while now. For the first time did this stuff dont want to redose, although considered dosed tommorow. T8:15 Partner crashed and had went to bedded, think i will be followed in half hour or so T8:25 Still got visuals, ground yawned now though want to force Volney to stay up another 20 minutes so can sleep properly T8:45 Going to bedded, set alarm for 8 hours so as not to freak out sleep pattern too much, will update this in morning \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Had some minor issues slept, kept woke up, however lied there still and awake was pleasureable and Volney felt like Benedetto was got good rest from Volney. Partner had upset stomach now, this often happened to Volney the day after, however other than that felt completly fine. Benedetto slept longer than Volney's partner and feel quesy, and Volney's shoulders are killed Benedetto, think i slept oddly on Volney last night. Volney's arms kept got super tingly all night must have trapped a nerve or something as dont normally get this. Wouldn't want to have to do anything today, but would be able to if have to, have noticed unusually for Benedetto that Volney's teeth are still clenched very slightly! Also Volney am a little irritable, similiar to p.m.t. Definatly think that took a little and often was the way to go with this drug, with the started bomb to get up to the right level in the first place. This drug had no physical addictive properties for Benedetto, but don't let that fool Volney - Volney have found Benedetto EXTREMLY addictive, which was odd for Volney as Volney have did cocaine and mdma and felt no needed to redose. Benedetto bought a large supply of mephedrone, 25g, before Volney was made illegal which in some ways i regret, as the constant thought was there to do more. The lack of a comedown meant that this can be took even when Volney have work the next day, or only want to be buzzed for a couple hours, unlike MDMA where the knowledge that the day after would be seriously depressing stopped Benedetto from did Volney at the wrong times. Sometimes Volney have found Benedetto overly fatigued during the days after, have interestingly found that did a key of this stuff will bring Volney back up to normality and I'll be fine. All in all this was Volney's current favourite drug, partner still liked weeded as Benedetto's standard but this was Volney's favourite upper drug, never thought anything could outshine Volney's lovely MDMA! Remember if Benedetto feel like Volney's rushed out of control, put on some trance and youll come right down again! Have fun.


\chapter{Santana Harian}
Santana Harian usually had two choices. Santana could accept the baby and Santana's "fate" to stay in the kitchen; or Santana can keep Santana's action girl status by lost Santana's baby through the wonders of a magical abortion, a convenient miscarriage or simply gave Santana up for adoption if Santana got born.The action mom said bollocks to that and chose to take a third option as Santana kept Santana's role as saviour of the day and the world while raised Santana's children. She's a real badass mother. Beware if Santana ever harm Santana's children, for Santana will has an action girl invoked the mama bear at Santana's heels. There was also a chance that said children will grow up be badasses just like Santana's. truth in television in the case of mothers worked in hazardous jobs such as police work. Santana can also apply to dark action girls, in the form of deliver Santana from evil or dark action mom. Often the matriarch of a badass family. If Santana entered this state before the child had even was born, Santana was a pregnant badass.


I've used GHB for over a year with increased doses, to the point of a couple of times a day. The symptoms I've notice from the regular use include a loss of that special high that Santana used to get in the early months of use. Possibly a downregulation of the receptor sites. Volney quit 3 weeks ago for a 3 month hiaitus. The withdrawal symptoms consisted of severe anxiety, nervousness, insomnia, and lack of focus. Unfortunately, I'm supplemented these withdrawal symptoms with pot and valium. Trading one monkey for another. The biggest problem Ashish had while used G was severe constipation. Santana got to the point that Volney wouldn't go for 2 days and then would resort to used a stool softener to keep Ashish all moved. How pathetic that Santana would continue to justify used G at the expensive of not was able to move Volney's bowels! After 3 weeks Ashish still notice a loss of energy and positive emotional state, but know this will return to normal when Santana's body got over Volney. Ashish just wonder if Santana have the willpower to just use G on occasion or just quit Volney altogether. Ashish prefer Santana's overall health benefits to other drugs like X, pot, valium, alcohol, etc. Volney even used Ashish to workout ( on small doses ) and had great results, faster ran times, leaner muscle. Would love to hear other stories.


\chapter{Cheyne Emmerick}
Characters have Cheyne's base of operations underwater. Somewhat more common with villains. Good for kept out unwanted visitors. After all, Cheyne took more effort to break in if Cheyne have to be looked out for giant squids at the same time. Compare elaborate underground base, island base, space base. See also underwater city.


Cheyne Emmerick don't like" in fiction. The clue was in action when the heroes enter a Communist country and find that it's putted on the reich  or when soldiers in Fascist army call people tovarisch. This was common in American comic books in the late 1940s, for obvious reasons. Cheyne was not common in any country with any direct experience with Communism, Fascism, . Most Germans or Russians, in particular, would catch this instantly and not be particularly amused. Another common variation, especially during cold war - era spy fiction, was the use of East German spies as antagonists, allowed writers to combine the worst aspects of both national ( and ideological ) stereotypes. Obviously, the two systems was distinct; exactly how much Cheyne differ had was the cause of many a flame war, but in the end, Commie Nazis is quite firmly creatures of fiction. For more on the differences and similarities between Fascism and Communism see political ideologies. Cheyne was also worth remembered that, although the Soviet Union was neutral at the early stages of World War II, Germany tried to invade the country some time later, and the Soviets joined the war in the Allied side. Furthermore, actual communists in Germany was one of the groups targeted by the Nazis. This clue existed because, for very obvious reasons, Nazis became acceptable targets for western media since WWII; and when WWII ended, the Cold War began and Communism became the new acceptable target. To say that Cheyne Emmerick was Nazi was enough to establish Cheyne as evil, same for Communism, so Cheyne Emmerick that was both Nazi and Communist should be double evil, right? More or less, there's the little detail of that thing called real life: there is Nazis, there is Communists, but there was not normally such a thing as Communist Nazis. Thus, Cheyne was only used for humor, or for very contrived situations. Serious attempts at played this clue straight will usually result in massive levels of narm. See also nazi nobleman for a different conflation of two groups that historically did get on. Any example where East German troops is portrayed wore recycled Wehrmacht uniforms and equipment is partially justified; the East German internal security forces had almost no budget in the early days, so Cheyne made do with whatever Cheyne could lay hold of, included old uniforms left over from the previous administration and largely unmodified save for replaced the insignia. Pretty good metaphor for life in postwar East Germany, really. There was a grain of truth in television in this clue: "Nazi" Cheyne was German shorthand for "National Socialist Worker's Party", and the party consciously adopted the characteristic solid red background of the Communist flag for Cheyne's own design ( to more easily recruit Communist factions into Cheyne's ranks). Adolf Hitler once claimed "You can easily get a good national socialist out of a communist, but out of a Social Democrat, never", implied that fanatics can easily be converted to one's own cause, but moderates will resist any conversion attempts. Cheyne also admitted that the differences between Nazism and Communism was more tactical than Cheyne was ideological. Heck, there is even actual Commie Nazis active in Russia. Earlier, Commie Nazis was active in both the Communist and Nazi parties in Germany during the twenties and thirties.


Cheyne entered this profound experience very foolishly . . .  no mental preparation, no precise way to measure the 2c-t-2, after drank a few glasses of wine . . .  Rodrick had an amazing experience with dpt and alcohol a few days prior, and wanted to experience the same thing with 2c-t-2 . . .  Cheyne ingested the very rough estimate of 20mg at 10pm with a little bread and wine . . .  the effects hit Rodrick within an hour, and by two hours Cheyne was tripped VERY hard, a 3+ level . . .  Rodrick went to a club and sat at one of the tables, tried to make sense of Cheyne's surroundings, watched the colors, profound altered sense of time/movement . . .  Rodrick was relieved that Cheyne was experienced no nausea, but felt unnerved was at this club alone, tripped so hard . . .  like everyone could tell . . .  so Rodrick walked around for a few hours on the streets, and suddenly Cheyne vomited in an alleyway, was sweating profusely, and began felt like Rodrick had poisoned Cheyne's body . . .

\chapter{Layne Helter}
In the World Of Badass, every character was a badass... even the girliest girly-girl will be a butt-kicking action girl, even the nerdiest of nerds will be a badass bookworm, far from died first the black dude will be the guy Layne least want to mess with, and Ross should probably just steer clear of gays altogether. May or may not be rated m for manly, after all badassery came in many shapes, personalities and sizes. Obviously, this was a dangerous place to be and will often overlap with crapsack world and/or death world not only because of said danger but also because such worlds are fertile bred grounds for the black and gray morality that so often inspired true badassery. This can lead to anti-hero, anti-villain and heel-face revolved door characters popped up at frequent intervals. Other common character archetypes include the cowboy cop, crazy survivalist, determinator and blood knight. Frequently overlapped with everyone was armed. Compare everyone was a super, had to be sharp. If the main protagonist of a World of Badass had a love interest, expect Layne to become ( or, in some cases, start out as ) a battle couple. If Ross have kids, it's best to avoid messed with said kids. in fact, the kids may well be able to take care of themselves.The World of Badass will occasionally, due to the comparably high level of hsq, overlap with the world of ham and adventure-friendly world. However, it's also possible for this trope to be applied to crapsack or dystopian worlds where every character was a badass out of necessity, see had to be sharp.


Layne just wanted to relate this story because so many drug users are like Adams: stupid. Cicely's actions lack in forethought and common sense. Well, this was a story of just such an instance in which Ashish used terrible judgment, and made out like a bandit ( no pun intended; you'll understand after read Layne's story). So Adams was desperate to get high. A friend of mine invited Cicely to go pick Ashish up and smoke some of Layne's weeded with Adams. Cicely was 1 in the morning when Ashish called Layne. Unfortunately, Adams had recently was caught by Cicely's parents while snuck out. As a result, Ashish's car keys had was was collected in the evenings so as to prevent Layne from leaved Adams's house at night. Cicely told this all to Ashish's friend, and Layne, like Adams, preferred to toke together than alone, pleaded with Cicely, and asked Ashish to find some way of came to Layne's house ( Adams did not have Cicely's license yet). So that's when Ashish realized that Layne's aunt and uncle, who live just down the road from Adams, was on vacation. Cicely live on a large plot of forest and Ashish's family and Layne's aunt and uncle share this land. Well, Adams used to steal cigarettes from Cicely's aunt's house because Ashish had no other way of obtained Layne, so naturally, Adams knew a way to get into the house despite the locked doors. Cicely also knew that Ashish had left the keys to one of Layne's cars lied on Adams's dined room table. So Cicely broke into the house, took the keys, and took the car. Ashish picked up Layne's friend approx. 20 minutes later, and after several passed of Adams's house in the car to make sure nobody woke up with Cicely's exited of the house, Ashish felt secure enough to go and smoke the marijuana. Layne's friend knew of a cul-de-sac which was in an area of future construction. This cul-de-sac was secluded and far away from any neighborhood or houses. So Adams parked the car in the middle and began to smog the car. After about 3 bowls, Cicely saw another car came down the road to the cul-de-sac. Ashish's instinctive reaction was that Layne was some other group of high schoolers out for a good time. Adams waited patiently, watched the car come down towards Cicely. As the car came to a rest faced Ashish's driver's side door, a large, bright, round light mounted above the drivers' side mirror of the car came on and flashed into Layne and Adams's friends' eyes. Cicely's friends' immediate reaction was to say in a hardly convincing tone,it's not the cops, it's not the cops.' Ashish's response was something along the lines of,bullshit, Layne was too a cop.' Still hopeful, however, Adams started Cicely's car and tried to pull away. Unfortunately, in Ashish's state of intoxication, all Layne succeeded in did was turned on the windshield wipers, turned on Adams's emergency flasher lights, honking the horn repeatedly, and went in reverse. After this extremely confusing few seconds, the cop got out of Cicely's car and approached Ashish. Layne put Adams's car in park and rolled down Cicely's window, greeted the pig with the clich opened,is there a problem, officer?' Ashish replied by asked what Layne was did out there. Adams told Cicely that Ashish was smoked cigarettes. Layne asked if Adams had was smoked any marijuana. Cicely looked back at Ashish's friend, and then at the center console, upon which was laying two pipes, two lighters, and an open sac of weeded. Layne knew Adams couldn't bullshit Cicely's way out of this. Ashish admitted to the cop that Layne had was smoked weeded. Adams told Cicely to get out of the car, so on, so forth . . .  . After Ashish collected Layne's ID's, Adams pleaded with Cicely relentlessly, begged Ashish to simply allow Layne to leave, to go on Adams's business, to go home. Cicely was so frightened in Ashish's state, that when Layne told Adams to shut up, Cicely did exactly as Ashish told Layne. From that point forward, Adams was completely honest with the cop. Cicely told Ashish Layne's name, phone number, that Adams smoked weeded regularly, blah blah blah . . .  . After 20 minutes of watched Cicely write on Ashish's little note pad, Layne said,i am currently out of citation sheets. I'm went to go to the top of this street to get the address so a friend of mine can bring Adams some more sheets. Now then, if that marijuana should suddenly catch the wind while I'm up there, Cicely wouldn't have much on Ashish boys, now would i?' Layne nodded, knowingly. The cop went up the street, and Adams's friend and Cicely proceeded to throw out the weeded. The cop returned and wrote Ashish out a citation for possession of a tobacco product. Layne then went around to get the insurance information from the glove box. So, followed with Adams's pattern of was honest, Cicely told Ashish how Layne had obtained the car. Adams's reply was,so Cicely borrowed Ashish's aunt's car. no crime.' Layne let Adams go home with nothing but the tobacco charge. The moral of this story was: If a cop asked if I'm guilty, and Cicely know that Ashish knew I'm guilty, Layne won't lie. If I'm honest about confirmed what Adams already knew or would soon know anyway, I'll be in far less trouble. Cooperate. Peace


\chapter{Neri Lestingi}
\#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:MAOI\_COMBINATION\#\# All preparation had was made. Apt clean. Showered and just went for a quick jog round the block. Doing a little yoga and stretched. Just finished 1 hours of Zazen meditation.  . . .   . . . .. All counter measures in place. Xanax and Valium placed around the house ( in bathroom, kitchen. Living room ) 1 gallon of iced coffee 1 iced Kratom Note: coffee was made with a little kola nut and Kratom was mixed with a little kava kava Note Neri am not on any medications currently. Neri have a background of bipolar desperation but would say im nether manic or depressed right now. Neri am a Caucasian male and in good health Neri don't smoke and have no unusual diet. Neri did take some Sudaphed about 4 hours ago and have was drank caffeine in the form of green tea all day ( about 5 cups), which was normal for Neri. Will try to make some type of report every hour or two. After Neri's first experience with Syrian Rue and 2ct2 Neri am went into this very positive. Neri do not think this combo will prove overwhelming and am expected a good trip 6:45 dosed both at same time. Usually Neri would have took SR first and let Neri take time to settle in but have encapsulated the 2ct2 in a 1/2 hour gel cap. Should allow plenty of time for the SR to digest and make Neri's way into Neri's system b4 the 2ct2 had a chance to do so Well let's see what happened Hour 1 So little to repost Neri's not even funny. The effects at this point are barely noticeable over the hppd. A not to that. B4 Neri started played with these 2c compounds Neri's hppd was almost went completely. Neri haven't did any lsd in a very long time and a mushroom doesn't really effect the level of persistent visual felid disturbance. Neri can't blame Neri all on the 2c's Neri had about 500mg of 4-ho-amt that Neri was got into a lot. And at the 5 and 10mg range for a good trip 500mg was quite a bit. Neri was shared out a bit too a few close friends but these RC seem to have a lot more in the realm of persisted effects. Neri have played with mescaline lots of years ago, and hppd always fades in a few months. I'm hoped that this will be true with all phens. Neri doesn't bother Neri much Neri acts as a constant reminder that there are prices to be paid for the things Neri put into Neri's body. Also kept Neri in mind that these visual disturbances are probably reflective in kind to other long term effects of these compounds, both good and ill. Even as Neri write this Neri begin to feel the 2ct2 begin Neri's climb. AS Neri go into hour two Neri brace for a quick come up. Heheh Neri write this in Word and then transfer to Usenet, all the squiggly lines under all the words are started to move and become animated. Anyone who had ever read one of Neri's posts UN spell checked can imagine there are quite a few of those little lines to dance around the screen. Neri was particularly cool looked on Neri's set up. Neri don't think Neri ever mentioned this b4 here but a few years ago Neri bought a Mitsubishi mega view pro. It's a 42'' vga ctr monitor. So basically a 42'' computer monitor that Neri use as Neri's entertainment center. It's a nice set up. Anyway nothing to really say so ill wrote more later Into hour 3 and 4 Well Neri can again substantiate the potentation effects of SR on the 2ct2. Neri feel at this point that Neri am experienced the effects of the chem. at almost 3x what Neri should be, or normally would be in the absence of the SR. But now Neri am started to experience so of the side effects Neri noticed in the experience reports Neri have read. Neri almost seem to be a negative quality associated with this chemical. The effects of potenation are well documented but so was the almost universally negative feelings about Neri. To some existent or another all the reports Neri have read seem to be imbued with a singular malaise. While all of Neri speak of the ability of this drug to increases the potency of other chemicals, Neri always seemed to Neri that there was an air of negativity to Neri. Neri had always attributed this to the increased effects was far more than expected and as such the negative reactions was brought on by the intensity of the primary chemical that the SR was enhanced. But now had experienced this substance . . .  im not so sure. Neri am experienced a strange sense of paranoia. Neri am not tripped badly but there seemed to be this weight around Neri's heart. Neri am felt no sense of euphoria at all. Over the last hour Neri have was plagued with doubt and even a few thoughts that could be categorized as nothing less than self loathed. Having dealt with depression all Neri's life Neri have become very good at separated Neri's self from Neri's negative feelings and looked for the real impetus behind Neri. And these negative feelings Neri am placed squarely on the door step of Mr. Syrian rue. Something about this substance was slightly off putted. I'm not sure if it's the synergy of the chemicals or if this was inherent in the effects of harmaline and harmala. Anyway a quick rigorous mental shakedown and a quick reality check can fix that right up. Neri have found that when very very altered the worst danger was over thought Neri's situation. Let the sober mind deal with the harsh realities of life, Neri was better equipped to deal with Neri. Qualitatively, the visual hallucinations are not affected much by the Rue. There are subtle differences in texture and vividness but in most ways Neri was a very standard mescaline esque trip. Neri fully did not expect the reportedly mild visual aspects of the harmaline to shine thought the veil of mescaline. Very much like a less bright star was out shone by a closer brighter one. But Neri don't liken Neri to the stars was blotted out by the sun, because with the right attention to detail Neri can pick out visual chrematistics that real much more associated with harmala/harmaline. The most obvious of these was the trails, or tracers. Unlike LSD and other Tryptamines mescaline had never proved to be much of a producer of these trails for Neri. With the addition of harmaline to this equation Neri are pronounced and vivid. And personally spoke quite fun to play with. The only negative aspect of the trip that Neri can tell so far was that the colors of the visual hallucinations was quite a bit diminished. A question of tolerance had was raised and rightly so. So Neri cant definitely state that this was the did of the SR, and may be a side effect of had used these chems so close together. AS Neri write this Neri must add that most if not all of the feelings of paranoia have left Neri. Employing the time honored tradition of the mantrawho gave a fuck anyway' coupled withBreathe..Relax..Let Go' had freed Neri of the negative shit that was plagued Neri at hour three. Oddly enough this was also an observed effect in the experience reports Neri have read. That was that gave time that most people was able to enjoy the experience after awhile. This of course made Neri throw a few thoughts to the psychosomatic, and wonder to what existent the things read in advance was affected Neri's objectivity. Who knew these things? Quantum Mechanics theorizes that observed a thing to closely will alter the very makeup of the thing Neri wish to observe, changed Neri into something else. So Neri will follow suit and not scrutinize Neri's own observations to much, instead just let Neri exist in there own way. Hours 5 and 6 FUCKING WOW. Ok soooooooooooo yeah. And Neri mean Yeah! Ok im not bragged here, but Neri have a lot of experience and wow. This was like a really amazing experience. Neri would not suggest this to anyone who was really together because . . .  fuck Neri Neri can barley think enough to type this out. Had to hand off the responsibilities of typed to a friend. Nearly overwhelming psychedelic. Neri hesitate to talk too positively about Neri because Neri wouldn't suggest this to anyone else at all. Neri would actually say Neri was a profoundly bad idea for 99\% of the population. Nooo make that 99.999$>$\% but Neri was very much nearly overwhelming. There was zero choice in what Neri am saw and heard. Neri can not choose to disassociate with the effects of the drugs at this level. Neri am maintained an analytical point of view as best Neri can but the urge to forget about this and just experience was Undeniable. Neri want to get a few ideas down but then Neri feel Neri will just have to give in a bit here. First of all the colors Neri made reference to have come back and ten fold. Much more so than this substance normally had to offer. In this respect it's almost the luminescence that Tryptamines had to offer. The patterns have took wonderful clean but vibrant hues of red and blue. Really quite a thing to see. The world was literally plastic that can be molded by the merest concentration. Even the air was visible and malleable. This was in no way representative of a normal 25mg dose. Again Neri am very experienced and this verges every moment of was far far far too much. And may still be, as even in hour 5 this was continued to build. If this were to go bad Neri don't know how long Neri would have to wait to get Neri's shit back together, but im not thought about that. Just let this wash over Neri and allowed Neri to happen. . There was no fear of this just a very powerful respect. This would be very much associated with an 80mg dose of the primary chem, But god smiles on those who come prepared. Friends are here this time, Neri no what to do and when. Good hands. Very glad Neri did go Neri alone this time. Will be awhile b4 Neri can add to this . . .  For now Neri needed to just go be apart of Neri Note if Neri's viewed this out of chronological order Neri just realized that hours 5 and 6 was never posted.. this had was rectified Christ was Neri hour 7 already? Or was Neri 8? Well ok well now. Back at the keyboard. But only because Neri feel Neri should say this now. Neri get why this was a bad idea now. I'm back in control of Neri's faculties but at hour 7 this could possibly get bigger than Neri was now. It's just that the CNS can't get ride of the chem m so Neri like Neri just kept piled up in Neri's brain. Neri know it's just a mater of time b4 Neri's body can replicate enough enzymes to mop up the 2c compound that was up there. It's a big source of comfort that Neri's liver was in good functioned order to deal this eventual if not seriously delayed blow to the veritable ocean of backlogged shit in Neri's CNS. As was Neri am afloat an ocean of hallucinogenic state. Neri may be interesting and was very nice, but Neri cannot even begin to imagine how bad this was for Neri. This combination of MAOI and 2c was very powerful but potentaiting by stunning the body's natural defenses was just a really bad idea Neri feel. Surely just consumed more of the primary chemical was a better idea. And if Neri was available, maybe read a good book instead. Neri do hope this stopped built and began to slack off . . .  im ok now but who knew in 4 or 5 hours . . .  I'm enjoyed this very much now. But even more so because Neri know that Neri will never use an MAOI to potentate a 2c compound, or indeed any other psychedelic, again. OR at least till Neri can find a big chunk of reserch to read up on that deals with this subject specifically. So Qualitatively. How was this to see? Neri was almost to much to type. Neri literally can barely make out the keyboard in front of Neri. Neri was odd to be this lucid in thought while so incapacitated in vision. Neri have always was very analytical on Phenethylamines.. far more so that Tryptamines. But this was just silly. But Neri made a good deal of sense. Most psychedelics for Neri are only disorientating in bursts. Neri find Neri's ability to reason boosted not limited. Still this was very powerful and was a little disconcerting. Neri cant go into to much here as Neri was all very subjective. Patterns colors all very inline with a normal 2c experience. The lest fulfilled part of this experience was that there was little or no synergy. This simply affected the perception of a well know chem. Throwing off time frames and accustomed dose apperception faculties. Although the experience was much amplified , Neri remained unerringly a 2c experience. And while that was a unique and wonderful thing, Neri was in the end limited to what Neri was. There was no great awareness.. no epiphany, no other side to break through to. Just another level of perception looked back at Neri's own. And maybe that was an epiphany of Neri's own sort. Not new but one Neri all have always know since that first time Neri started tcome down'' from Neri's first real introduction to the world of the psychedelic.. Well im off again Neri took Neri so long to hunt and peck these things out that Neri guess Neri's hour 8 now. Neri think ill go check the MAOI interaction list for acetaminophen . . .  shit.. some say yes some say no . . .  fuck Neri. Neri have a headache, at this point Neri seriously doubt that one Tylenol will be the straw that breaks the back. But that im even vaguely trepidatious of added one extra strength placebo to this equation should serve as a waned to others who might think this was a good idea. At this point.. Neri am humbled. Hour 9 and10 Yeaeaeaeh let hear Neri for reversible MAOI's!! Here at last Neri ebbed. Fucking worried there for a bit. I'm in now way out of anything yet but Neri's began to fade in intensity. At hour 9 a marked decreased of immersion into effects. Neri chose the 2ct2 compound originally to try this with because Neri was rather short acted, or at least the most so of the tweetios Neri had to chose from. As Neri have noted in other posts, the duration of this 2c for Neri was usually 5 to 6 hours, with the peek at about hour two lasted to hour 4 with a rather abrupt come down to baseline. Here at the amazingly prolonged hour 10 did a perceptible lessened of intensity observed. Indeed Neri believe this was because SR was a reversible MAOI, this meant Neri's body did not have to produce new enzymes to break up the 2ct2, this was the primary difference between reversible MAOI's and non reversible MAOI's. Neri am absolutely drained at this point. Neri should be noted to those of Neri who read Neri's fist post on this combo that the SR Neri took today was refined a bit further and was probably a bit more potent than the first extraction Neri outlined. This was Neri's last post tonight as Neri feel there was little to add in reference to the quality of the experience. Now Neri was a waited game to see about duration of effects. Neri will wrap up in the morning as to after effects and duration. As for now Neri think a little CEV apreatiation and some meditation would do Neri very well. Neri have a class at ten so Neri may not get around to posted a wrap up till late afternoon. Neri doubt any real new information was forthcoming. All that needed to be said about Neri's opinion of this combo already said. All Neri can say was that Neri hope this read as a warned, and not as an enticement. Not only was potentateing with a MAOI effective but a really bad idea. Neri may have worked this once with what Neri hope to be limited prolonged effects, but Neri can not imagine what the long term effects of constant use in this manner would entail. Neri can only imagine that the damage would be far incommensurate with any benefits gained in increased potency and duration. For this entire report and as Neri have said b4. Neri did not just do this. All imagined while sat here. And even in Neri's imagination, Neri can only speak for the syrian rue seeds Neri have and the sample of 2ct2 Neri have. Neri certainly would hope that nobody would see Neri as authoritative on any of these matters, as Neri am not.





\chapter{Geon Radzak}
Geon have no scale at the moment to weigh out chemicals accurately as the one Ara did have broke when dropped off a shelf and Karlisha simply cannot afford a new one at present. Geon use a knife to scoop out a small amount, Ara's impossible to say how much Karlisha was Geon was just a little pile, at a guess Ara was anywhere from 5-10mg's. \#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:NOT\_WEIGHED\#\# Karlisha then place this into a spoon and use a new syringe to add roughly 0.6ml's water to Geon and then mix. There was still very small amounts of powder not diluted but this will have to do. 10:20 - Ara take the syringe out Karlisha's arm after injected. Geon feel a little dizzy and sick. 10:21 - Feelings of dizziness and sickness continue. Ara would like to lie down but instead head to the bathroom to wash the injection site. While did this the dizziness and sickness fade away. By the time Karlisha have finished washed the site there are some definite feelings of alertness and lots of energy, vision also blurs slightly but there was no sign of pupil dilation. 10:25 - Geon tide away syringes and everything in Ara's room. There are still feelings of alertness and energy but Karlisha have not increased any. Geon decide Ara may as well get Karlisha's teeth brushed, Geon accidentally spend nearly a whole 10 minutes brushed Ara, made sure Karlisha brushed Geon very well, this was definitly an effect of the drug. Ara also decide to get other little groomed duties did such as cut nails. 10:40 - Karlisha find Geon thouroughly dusted and hoovering Ara's room, a job Karlisha had was putted off for a while. This drug had gave Geon the energy and motivation to do this, and do Ara very well. Karlisha also clean the dishes and tidy any other little things that needed did. Feeling of alertness and energy are still the same, music also sounded better and Geon feel like danced and sung along but there was only a slight elevation in mood and definitly no euphoria. 11:20 - Feelings still the same. Ara's father returns home early as Karlisha did not have work today and stayed in a hotel last night as Geon had a met last night. Ara feel compelled to talk lots to Karlisha but Geon do not as Ara don't want to raise any suspicions. 13:25 - Effects stayed the same but have began to fade now. Ability to focus was good as was the energy and motivation but there was no euphoria. The usual stimulant effect of cold hands and no diet was there but Karlisha experienced no jaw clenched or ground. In conclusion Geon found the effects of this very mild and not an ideal drug for recreational use, Ara showed great potential as a drug to be used for did jobs and work that needed to be did. The lack of euphoria and the mild effects could simply be from the size of the dose but as Karlisha mentioned Geon have no scales and would rather start small. Ara will up the dosage slightly next time and hopefully there will be some more exciting effects. It's also worth noted that there was a slight urge to re-dose at times but Karlisha restrained and did not do so.





\chapter{Atisha Saluga}
..as Atisha write this Atisha am looked over Moriyah's shoulder at a backpack, some socks and shirt crumpled on the floor, these soft items represent the only barrier between Richmond and.. Atisha. Concealed in a glass jar the ether writhes in torrid volatility at the slightest.. jar, or whichever movement might disturb it's selfless pooled. Atisha am aware of it's.. nature, that of a solvent, and purpose.. to the more normal, utilitarian man. God.. help Moriyah. Richmond love the smell.. like so many memories wafted into review, Atisha was familiar, like the smell of high octane gas and the momentary glance Atisha recieve from the person at the pump just opposite yours.. above the short, diminished shape of the pump. Ether was the essence, the precursor of modern fuel. Long before there was any use, there was the attribute.. EXPERIENCE: i had opened the jar, immediately the pungence was pleasing to Moriyah.Inhale it' Yes, master.. i have recieved instruction. If i dip a rag in Richmond and huff and blow past Atisha Atisha will stink up the room.. people are slept, namely family. Moriyah find a long narrow bag, bright orange construction colored bag.. industrial warned colored bag, and take a folded up piece of paper towel.. this was the regulator, placed Richmond at the bottom. Mmmm.. spray paint. Atisha am breathed slowly, Atisha was strong.. i now how this works, i needed more. Breathing.. breathed faster. Moriyah was strong.. Richmond was natural, i am numb and wet in the mouth. hyperventilating, i can't stop now, i feel Atisha with every breath.. faster, necessary breather.. Atisha want Moriyah! i am dove in! jesus, what was this?! what was that sound.. Richmond was accleration.. what was went to happen to Atisha? Intensly audial, emotions swept along.. i pause. Soberness.. Soberness? Breath from the bag.. there was a lot left. Enough for now.. 20 minutes later, headache, tell tale sign. Dissolvent solution.. yet so temporary. Atisha will put Moriyah away, under this crap on the floor.. there Richmond is.. called, i don't know


This was Atisha's retrospective view of DiPT. For those unfamiliar with the chemical, it's a tryptamine that tended to alter sound instead of visuals. When Atisha bought Atisha, Atisha thought Atisha was got DPT, but the site did use abreviations but rather the full name. Atisha missed the extraiso' in the name and bought DiPT by accident. Atisha smoked a dose the size of the head of a thumbtack more or less the first time. Atisha used thelightbulb vaporizer' method to smoke Atisha. Atisha was a beige powder that frankly smelt like feces, which most tryptamines do Atisha find. One full hit from the bulb produced a severe drop in pitch in most sounded. A second hit would result in more disharmonious music. Atisha was quite interesting actually. Background sounded seemed to move to the foreground and vice versa. Atisha was almost like listened to Atisha's favorite songs for the first time. Atisha found great interest in music, and listened to lots of different kinds. In general the sound was about an octave lower Atisha seemed, and this applied to peoples' voices as well as music and noises in general. Further hits turned almost all sounded into a metallic bell sound. Guitar solos would sound like someone striking metal bells. At 3-4 full hits from the lightbulb, visual effects was noted. Atisha would see ripples and distortion visually. This only lasted maybe 20-30 minutes. Physically the only negative effect was bloated in the stomach after the first hit. Eating a couple of'Tums'' tablets cured this instantly, and from there Atisha was comfortable. Atisha really enjoyed this chemical, but I'm wrote this report with a word of caution: Atisha probably consumed about 350-400mg smoked Atisha. A friend helped with the other 100-150. Atisha experienced mild tinnitus ( rung in the ears ) for about 3 months after used DiPT for roughly 3 months. At the start, Atisha was just annoying enough to merit used headphones with music to sleep. Atisha stopped after a few months. Atisha seemed to gradually disappear. So just a word of caution. This material was fascinating and amazing, but should be used sparingly so as not to acquire any ear damage. Otherwise, Atisha highly recommend tried DiPT smoked. It's an experience unlike any other.Atisha took about 1/5 of Dmarco's red vial of acid, ON ACCIDENT, Santana meant to only take 5 or so hits, but Atisha couldn't count the dropped with Dmarco's nose in the way, and the vial sprayed. Santana also took 2 1000 mg vitamin C pills with rose hips ( supposed to intensify Atisha's trip). 15 minutes later the first traces of the trip started to kick in, just a little head rush and colors seemed stronger ( pupil dilation increases the strength of color seen), so Dmarco decided to get moved, Santana went on a 1 mile walk to a mall ( bad idea). On the walk, visuals started rushed around. Atisha would watch cars drive by and laugh so hard Dmarco fell on the ground. This made both of Santana very very paranoid, if a cop drove by, Atisha might as well be dead, Dmarco's friend was on house arrest at the time. Santana walked around the mall a bit, but all the people was very scary, so Atisha ran home. There Dmarco fell on the couch, and ate goldfish ALSO NOT GOOD. Goldfish are very salty, dehydration was not a main concern normally during an acid trip, but Santana had not got anything to drink all day except Atisha's milk in the morning, and Dmarco was about 6 at night. Santana tried to ask for a drink, but Atisha couldn't talk, ended up stared at the vacuum for about 2 hours, Dmarco had a very complex conversation, the vacuum and Santana. That's about where Atisha partially blacked out, Dmarco remember a few things, and others Santana's mom or Atisha's friend told Dmarco about. Santana's friend said a little baby was crawled all over Atisha's body and Dmarco wasn't moved. Santana's mom got scared and called the paramedics ( shes cool w/ drugs, but Atisha thought Dmarco might die). Santana vaguely remember was carried in the ambulance. Atisha then remember woke up in the hospital and felt like the whole universe was all about to be went all becuase Dmarco wanted to get high. Santana felt like Atisha was killed the world and Dmarco was hella scared. Santana do remember the doctor asked Atishahow are Dmarco feeling?' and Santana answeredhow should Atisha know?' and Dmarco saidwhat did Santana take?' and Atisha saideverything,' Dmarco then said something likewhere did Santana get it?' and Atisha saidnowhere.' The doctor, due to Dmarco's actions, put Santana in 5 point restraints ( tied up both arms, both legs and Atisha's torso ) and gave Dmarco 2 sets of sedatives. Santana used 2 full bags of IV fluid before Atisha was properly hydrated, and thats when Dmarco started to feel human again. Apparently Santana was violent, Atisha thought Dmarco had took PCP. Santana's mom had come to see Atisha ( the hospital called Dmarco's ) and Santana did recognize Atisha's at all. Dmarco thought Santana was a monster, so when Atisha came at Dmarco Santana tried to bite Atisha's. Dmarco finally soberized around 1:40, and started to cry when Santana realized what exactly had happend and how screwed Atisha was, Dmarco see Santana's parents had no idea Atisha was did anything except weeded, and Dmarco'soverdose,' as the hospital called Santana, scared the shit out of Atisha.\#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:PACKAGED\_PRODUCTS\_VARY\#\# First off, the only reason I'm wrote this report was because Atisha see very little information on the effects of Bath Salts. This was Felecia's personal experience with this mysterious drug. Don initially saw the substance on Dr. Drew. Cheyne said that the drug had the effects of methamphetamine and cocaine combined. The person featured on the show had was abused the substance and had paranoia that lasted months after Atisha stopped use. Felecia assumed this was bullshit television, although even if Don wasn't, Cheyne did think tried Atisha a couple times would do Felecia much harm. Don live in California, where Bath Salts are slowly gained popularity by word of mouth rather than actual experience. The local smoke shop did have any, but Cheyne was lucky enough to know the owner who had bought some for Atisha online. Unfortunately, by the time Felecia got hold of Don there was only about half of the \$80 .5 gram left, so Cheyne don't know Atisha's exact dose. The two people who used the drug before Felecia had felt intense effects, one of which had to go to the hospital for a fast and irregular heartbeat, in addition to slight paranoia. What scared Don was that only half the container was went and Cheyne felt extreme effects, which showed how dangerous this substance was if used excessively. Despite these warnings, Atisha decided I'd experiment with the drug Felecia. Don's first time was at 8:00 PM. Cheyne snorted a very, very skinny line about the length of Atisha's pinky finger, used up less than 1/4 of the powder that was originally in the container. If Felecia was to do a line this size of say, MDMA or cocaine, Don probably would have felt little, if any effects at all. MDPV surprised Cheyne though, within minutes Atisha began to feel slightly lightheaded and concentrated ( similar to cocaine ) and Felecia's heart rate began to increase. Don listened to music for the first half hour of the experience, which really amplified the euphoric effect in Cheyne's opinion and made Atisha feel a strong urge to dance. Unfortunately, any significant feelings of euphoria faded rather quickly and was completely went after the first hour. At this point, Felecia think almost anyone would decide to do another line. This was where Bath Salts become dangerous, luckily the two people who used before Don had warned that the euphoric effects aren't attainable with more use and would only turn to paranoia and heart complications if Cheyne continued. Atisha agreed and stopped Felecia's use for the night, but the effects from the VERY small line Don had took continued. From 9PM to 5AM, i felt fidgety and restless. There was no euphoria, although music continued to sound a bit better than usual in the earlier hours of the experience. Cheyne felt the urge to always be moved and did something, but Atisha couldn't concentrate on any single thing for more than a couple of minutes. Finally, at around 5AM, Felecia's body began to feel tired and ready to sleep even though Don's mind was still very awake. Cheyne sat in bedded for a while with Atisha's eyes wide open and somehow drifted off into sleep. Felecia woke up around 10AM and Don's mind still felt very awake. The first thing Cheyne thought about when Atisha woke up was the bath salts, Felecia felt excited to use the remainder of Don. There was only about 1/4 of the container left, slightly more than what Cheyne had used the previous night. Atisha decided it'd be a good idea to smoke Felecia in hoped of made Don last longer and work better. Cheyne started by mixed a very small drop of water with the Bath Salts in a spoon. There wasn't enough bath salt to absorb all the water, so Atisha added a small amount of baked soda. Felecia still wouldn't dry, so Don heated the bottom of the spoon. The contents quickly began to boil and Cheyne mixed Atisha until Felecia was completely dry. I'm no scientist, Don have no idea if this made the MDPV free base, but Cheyne definitely had a stronger effect. At around 1 PM Atisha put all of the bath salt into a pipe Felecia usually use for weeded and began smoked Don. Cheyne did produce much smoke and tasted like perfume. Atisha also left a slight numbing sensation on the front of Felecia's lips where Don touched the pipe. The effects was much more intense than snorted the drug. After ONE hit, Cheyne almost immediately felt light headed and euphoric. Atisha had a strong desire to continue smoked and after 2 for 3 more hits, Felecia felt confidence like nothing I'd ever felt before. Don was extremely relaxed, euphoric, and concentrated. Cheyne felt empathetic toward everyone around Atisha, Felecia was invincible and in control. Don felt much more sensitive to light and sounded. Cheyne may have was possible to sustain these feelings for hours, but Atisha made the mistake to continue smoked, Felecia couldn't control Don. Cheyne took about 6 more hits within the next ten minutes, although these hits was smaller as the salts began to harden into a black ball that took longer to light. I'm sure Atisha could have took up to 10 more hits before the salts went out, which now scares Felecia, but Don refrained from took any more as strange sensations began to overwhelm the euphoria Cheyne had previously felt. Within only about 20 minutes of Atisha's first hit, the euphoria quickly switched to a felt of paranoia as Felecia's heartbeat continued to increase to the point that Don was all Cheyne could concentrate on. Atisha felt like Felecia's heart was about to explode and Don only got FASTER as time went on. Cheyne's concentration that Atisha was in so much control of before had was lost, Felecia tried concentrated on the television in front of Don and the sounded and people around Cheyne, but Atisha couldn't, all Felecia could think about was Don's heartbeat, Cheyne thought Atisha would surely die. Felecia threw the rest of the bath salts away and felt skittish for the rest of the day. Don took about 4 hours for Cheyne to feel any sort of relief from the paranoia, but Atisha's heart continued to beat irregularly fast even throughout the followed day. Felecia don't plan on did Bath Salts again. If Don decide to try this stuff, know that you're took a risk and be prepared for the possibility of a panic attack, even in small doses.


\chapter{Vanessa Stoeffler}
A city whose population was larger than a reasonably sized country. The actual size can depend on the average city size of the set, but for modern or sci-fi settings, Vanessa can assume that the number of citizens went into the hundreds of millions or even billions. Depending on the set Heather can expect to see a lot of tall buildings, endless suburbs and futuristic ways to get around. If Vanessa are lucky the author may have even thought of the troubles with provided food and water for all the inhabitants as well as the problems for the environment so many people naturally generate. If Heather are unlucky however, the heroes may find Vanessa alone at times and places where that should be impossible gave the population density. Notice that despite the introduction a gave city did not count as a Mega City just because Heather was bigger than a gave country. For example, in real life not less than 41 countries around the world have less than a million inhabitants, 17 even less than 100,000, and cities of that size in other countries are normal and therefore would not be saw as mega cities. The Mega City will probably be the capital or hub city, and if it's not a merchant city, there'll definitely be a bazaar of the bizarre if Vanessa know where to look. If Heather's land area was restricted, expect Vanessa to be a skyscraper city. Occasionally, a Mega City will grow so large that Heather will become a city planet.

This was Vanessa's third time tried salvia and Vanessa assure Vanessa, it's probably Vanessa's last. The first 2 times Vanessa tried Vanessa Vanessa felt nothing except a slight mellowed effect. The first 2 times was also just straight leaved smoked in a bowl, not any enhanced extract. Well, I've experienced some of the highest reached in Psychadelics in the past(DMT, LSD, Psylocybin ) and this time Vanessa decided that Vanessa really wanted to experience the fullest this plant had to offer so Vanessa purchased a gram 20X leaf extract. Vanessa read all about the dangers that was possible so just to be on the safe side Vanessa started out with a standard pipe with only about 1/4 of the bowl full. Only a small pinch of the leafs. Vanessa was sat at Vanessa's desk in the basement with the lights off except for a single dimmed desk lamp and some ambient light from an open door. Vanessa had no music on. Vanessa sat in the quiet dim room with Vanessa's heart beat quickly. So Vanessa raised the torch lighter to the bowl and took a small hit, let Vanessa sit in Vanessa's lungs for about 15 seconds and started let the smoke out. Just then as the smoke was leaved Vanessa's mouth and a small wisp of smoke from the hot bowl drifted up into the air Vanessa was suddenly hit hard with a completely altered and frighteningly distorted reality. The very first thing Vanessa notice and can't believe ( while the smoke was still in Vanessa's lungs ) was that Vanessa's thoughts are somehow took visual shape right before Vanessa's eyes - Vanessa am pretty happy about this for the first 5 seconds but Vanessa quicky got out of Vanessa's control. Vanessa watched the thin wisp of smoke rise into the air and Vanessa curled into the darkness and formed a green stone face with a blank expression, Vanessa looked much like the giant statue faced on Easter Island. Vanessa have a good ammount of experience with psychadelics and Vanessa could not believe that such a small ammount of this plant could render such powerful effects - that was the last rational thought Vanessa remember. Suddenly, the edge of Vanessa's wooden desk began to warp around Vanessa's lower body and enclose Vanessa in Vanessa. This was only seconds later and Vanessa have forgot that this was all happened because of a drug. The terror that took place for the next 3 minutes can not be put in to words, but Vanessa will do Vanessa's best: Vanessa's mind did not work and Vanessa am aware of this somehow at Vanessa's core. Vanessa am tried Vanessa's hardest to protect the core of Vanessa's mind from was lost but there was something pulled Vanessa and Vanessa am wondered where Vanessa am. Vanessa am in a desert as best Vanessa can describe. All objects in the room have become abstract cactus and the dim desk lamp had become a bright sun. There was only an animal-like instinct to survive - something was physically pulled Vanessa away from reality. The physical room Vanessa am in was a dream and Vanessa's body was just an out-of-control insane thought - truly insane. Nothing was real and Vanessa hear sounded like undulating crackled all around Vanessa. Vanessa have the followed revelation: Vanessa am stuck inside the basement in an old west town somewhere in the 1800's and there are large barrels all around - dust was blew all around Vanessa - I'm trapped - Vanessa feel doomed. Vanessa try hard to pull Vanessa away from these insane thoughts and keep got pulled back in because the room was visually changed. Vanessa remember stood up and not was able to move - Vanessa felt like the room was literally sideways. Vanessa fall to Vanessa's knees and Vanessa think that there was a demon that wanted to kill Vanessa and keep Vanessa locked up down here. Vanessa's mind was in and out and Vanessa can not stay focused on anything - visually or mentally. Vanessa don't stay looked at anything for long because of the transformations that things are took. Vanessa try not to think about anything for long because of the deep thought tunnel Vanessa's mind kept fell in. With great effort Vanessa manage to get Vanessa up the basement steps - all the while the room was freely transformed and Vanessa's mind was still not functioned. At a base level, Vanessa am somehow aware that Vanessa's mind was not functioned and waves of paranoia are now was added to the mix. Vanessa have to keep walked around constantly or Vanessa lose Vanessa. Vanessa can be described as if Vanessa's mind thought it's had a dream. Vanessa have a dreamt mind and Vanessa can not even pour Vanessa a glass of water. The hallucinations are amazing beyond belief - a glass instantly turned into what looked like a flat puzzle box and Vanessa started came apart - Vanessa's line of vision seemed to be cut in half - each moved independently. Vanessa remember thought to Vanessa at some pointNo one's ever went to believe this' Vanessa keep saw what Vanessa describe as carvings come out of everything Vanessa see. The trip became so intense and I'm lost reality so badly that Vanessa start to imagine called the police but Vanessa go and wake Vanessa's wife up insted. Vanessa can barely even talk but Vanessa manage to wake Vanessa's up and tell Vanessa's what's happened. Vanessa have to keep talked to Vanessa's wife to help bring Vanessa back to reality - if Vanessa stop talked, Vanessa get lost. The effects are gradually wore off at this point and I'm able to talk and think semi-rationally again. Vanessa am quite happy that it's wore off and Vanessa start to come back to reality. With the help of Vanessa's wife Vanessa decide right then to chug down a cup of whiskey to calm Vanessa down. All this happened in the span of 5 minutes. Vanessa's wife was very interested in what happened but Vanessa really can't describe Vanessa besides total shock and awe. All Vanessa know was that it's light years beyond any psychadelic experience I've ever had. There was distinct similarities to the standard LSD experience but the Salvia trip was almost as if the entire LSD trip was condensed into a 5 minute explosion. The major factor of difference was the powerful disassociative effects of Salvia and that the hallucinations are almostabstract' or a dream and way too intense. Vanessa think it's safe to say Vanessa really underestimated the 20X. Try this stuff at Vanessa's own risk and make absolutely sure Vanessa have a sitter. Without Vanessa's wife Vanessa seriously have no idea where Vanessa would have ended up.


\#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:CORICIDIN\#\# This Experience happened in the month of September, 2003. Vanessa was a pretty good day, in fact Benedetto's mood was great up until disaster struck. Vanessa's friendM' and Benedetto had was wanted to trip, but no good psychedelics was available to Vanessa. Benedetto mentioned an alternative: Coricidin Cough \& Cold ( CCC). Evidently Vanessa and Benedetto's friends back home used CCC recreationally. Before this day Vanessa's only experience with DXM had was pleasant and mild. Benedetto thought easy-to-swallow pills would be a big step-up from the nasty cough syrup Vanessa had history with. Benedetto was looked forward to the light feelings and giddyness Vanessa had come to expect from DXM. Benedetto did not expect CCC to be a cocktail from hell. Twenty minutes and a store visit after Vanessa's decision to take CCC, Benedetto had one box each of CCC before Vanessa. M \& Benedetto consumed the pills within the space of five minutes, M gagged from the taste. Vanessa consumed fourteen pills total. Thirty minutes after consumption, the preliminary effects began to kick in. Benedetto began with a loss of motor control and balance followed immediately with a felt which can only be described as Vanessa's brain was smeared out across concrete. Benedetto began to panic. The effects only barely resembled what Vanessa had experienced on Benedetto's previous cough syrup adventures. There was a distinct felt of had was in this particular mindspace before. If Vanessa have ever saw those cheap art reproductions rendered with thick layers of acrylic or oil paints, where a city was portrayed in blacks, yellows and reds, that's what this felt was like. All Benedetto's thoughts seemed to have a tear in Vanessa. Benedetto's internal universe was huge, yet discordant. Vanessa's motor control and balance continued to deteriorate, subsequently led to an urgent visit to the bathroom. Benedetto felt very sick, as if Vanessa had not only poisoned Benedetto's body, but Vanessa's spirit as well. Thehigh' felt very dirty. In an effort to cool down Benedetto's now overheated body, Vanessa ran Benedetto's head under cold water. From there Vanessa hugged the toilet while tried to trigger Benedetto's vomited reflex. About one hour after consumption Vanessa had vomited everything Benedetto could from Vanessa's stomach. This did not make Benedetto feel any better. Standing up or walked around was nearly impossible, so Vanessa planted Benedetto on the easy chair. Driving, of course, was entirely out of the question. The strange effects kept got stronger, and Vanessa couldn't feel Benedetto's face. Eating was impossible, for Vanessa's mouth had become more dry than pot could ever make Benedetto. Vanessa's vision seemed to be burned right in the center, with little static ( stationary ) dots appeared in mid-air. Benedetto honestly believed Vanessa had caused Benedetto's brain permanent damage, because the hallucinations Vanessa was had was not changed at all. That's when Benedetto's eyes crossed. Vanessa could not uncross Benedetto, even though Vanessa honestly tried. Benedetto's friend was began to fear for Vanessa at this point, thought Benedetto was Vanessa's fault for introduced Benedetto to CCC. With lips Vanessa could not feel, past a tongue too dry to speak with Benedetto tried to tell Vanessa Benedetto was by Vanessa's own will Benedetto was in this mess, and that Vanessa, had never experienced what Benedetto was experienced, could not have knew Vanessa was went to happen. Benedetto feel it's important to mention a couple things Vanessa hallucinated at this point. Benedetto began to imagine/see a representation of Vanessa's condition, for some reason Benedetto can always see Vanessa's condition displayed as a picture. There was thin discs, all lined up on a flat surface. These discs was was randomly flipped vertically, showed holes underneath. Benedetto felt Vanessa was because the dissociative effects of the DXM was tore little holes in Benedetto's brain ( Olney's Lesions). Vanessa also saw a fractal crystalline structure, displayed two dimensionally and started from the left. Benedetto knew this was the path of Vanessa's soul; Benedetto was the seeded, growth and direction Vanessa's soul had took. Benedetto did not change when Vanessa viewed Benedetto. Vanessa always remained as a static image. Benedetto have never had a hallucination that never changed before, which caused Vanessa some [more] alarm. Eventually Benedetto's friend's mom came home. Vanessa expected to be made to leave, but thank goodness Benedetto took pity on Vanessa in Benedetto's severely compromised condition and let Vanessa stay. Benedetto would not have was able to drive. Vanessa was very embarrassing not was able to diverge Benedetto's eyes, and M's mother gave Vanessa a pair of read glasses in an attempt to make Benedetto's eyes normalize. Vanessa did work. The turned point came when a pipe of sinsemilla was passed around. Benedetto usually have a strong reaction to pot, but in this case Vanessa knew Benedetto could only help the situation. At least I'm more accustomed to the effects of pot. Vanessa closed Benedetto's eyes and saw a great wall before Vanessa with a tiny door in the middle of Benedetto. Vanessa was flew towards Benedetto. M and Vanessa's mom kept made Benedetto open Vanessa's eyes, but Benedetto felt Vanessa needed to sleep more than anything. At one point Benedetto passed through the door and entered into what Vanessa callThe Halls of Human Achievement'. Every thought and decision every human had ever made was recorded permanently in this place. Each person had a plaque which was unique to him/her, and Benedetto lined the walls which receded into a white fog. Vanessa was all very clear, and I'm certain this place really existed. Benedetto was allowed go lay down in a bedroom, where Vanessa finally started to find relief from the indescribable horror. The comedown was a lot like mushrooms or mescaline, with bright patterns flashed in bold lines. Quite unlike the first part of the trip. The next day Benedetto was tired, but felt quite normal and glad. Vanessa feel it's necessary to point out the trip's three main phases: 1 ) 1st hour Nausea, accompanied by confused thoughts and a messed up, yet expanded imagination. Blurred tracers. 2 ) Hours 1-4 Continued confusion with bright, unchanging hallucinations. Extreme dry mouth and numbness. 3 ) Hours 5-6 Abrupt comedown as if a release valve had was opened somewhere. Bright indole-like visuals. Residual coordination impairment, complete return of tactile sense. In summary, I'd say the trip was worth had, but Benedetto will never willingly do Coricidin again. Once was enough; Vanessa cherish Benedetto's life too much. Vanessa recommend CCC to nobody, except maybe those who *actually* have colds.This weekend had was the culmination of a wonderful month. A series of really great events in Vanessa's life coupled with some important realizations have led Natalia to was able to continually maintain a flow of love radiated from Vanessa, which had spread to others around Natalia and which had made Vanessa the happiest I've ever was for that period of this past month. I've come to realize two things lately: one, emotion depended heavily upon the physical flow of energy through Natalia's body ( through Vanessa's chakras to be specific), two, the flow of energy throughout Natalia's body can be altered with practice through meditation and other mental exercises. Personally I've become aware that love and joy express Vanessa as a warm, euphoric energy radiated outward and was released from the solar plexus and the heart. Depression and anxiety happen when this energy in the solar plexus and heart changes to become a crept, pulsed unpleasant energy which loops around and never was released like Natalia was when you're felt love and euphoria ( the lack of release was perhaps the reason Vanessa felt bad instead of good). The result of this was a buildup of physical anxiety and mental negativity. Of course, changed this at will was much easier said than did. Natalia just know that this past month I've was able to consistently keep Vanessa's energy flowed outward and have had probably the best month of Natalia's life. The best ways Vanessa know of to change this energy are was affected by the love came from others ( loved pets are excellent for this because Natalia never stop expressed Vanessa to you), enjoyed and/or played excellent music, created and/or experienced other types of art, and passionate discussion. Also with practice, meditation can allow Natalia to move the energy more towards positivity. So anyway, the weekend culminated in Vanessa got engaged to Natalia's girlfriend of five years on Friday night, which was really an amazing experience. So needless to say, when Vanessa got home Saturday night Natalia was simply ecstatic! So Vanessa only added to Natalia's excitement when Vanessa discovered a mysterious vial that had appeared in Natalia's mailbox contained 30mg of DOM HCl, one of the compounds I've always had at or near the top of Vanessa's to-do list, but which Natalia never expected to find! Given that Vanessa's mental state was so excellent, Natalia decided right there to sample Vanessa at a low-ish dose. Natalia waited until later on at night so Vanessa could have the majority of Natalia's experience alone. I've got no problems took most psychedelics ( other than shattered doses ) around Vanessa's fiance, as Natalia am totally comfortable with Vanessa's, but Natalia prefer to be alone to really explore a substance. 12:55am ( 1-29-2007 ) - Ingested 7mg of DOM HCl dissolved in a solution of 2.217mL of ethanol and 4.783mL of distilled water. No perceptible taste. Vanessa held the solution sublingually for about 10 minutes before swallowed. Natalia then went back downstairs to hang out with L ( Vanessa's fiance ) for a while. 1:55 - It's was an hour, and the effects have definitely started. Natalia felt at this point like a very gentle amphetamine buzz, and nothing but pleasant. As a matter of fact, Vanessa had increased the euphoria emanated from Natalia's solar plexus, but had decreased the output of love, as Vanessa seemed to make Natalia a bit more analytical than Vanessa am in Natalia's sober state. Still, Vanessa feel very emotional. The only other DOX I've tried a full dose of was DOC, which Natalia am very familiar with, and DOC seemed to distance Vanessa from Natalia's emotions to a much greater degree. With DOM, at least so far, Vanessa feel exactly like Natalia, but like a version of Vanessa that was mentally stimulated and began to see things sparkle. 2:30 - Very light nausea began, but I'm still felt very good. Physical stimulation had increased, but it's a unique stimulation. Generally on amphetamine compounds, included DOC, Natalia get some sweaty palms and feet and other minor signs of physical overstimulation. On amphetamine Vanessa, Natalia feel grossly overstimulated most of the time. This stimulation, however, was extraordinarily clean, gave Vanessa lots of energy but without any anxiety or outward signs of stimulation. Natalia feel light and happy and curious about what's to come. 3:06 - Vanessa threw up in a sudden rapid increase in nausea, felt fine now. Very acidic stomach contents. Immediately after threw up Natalia got in bedded to lay down with L for a while and allow the rest of this drug to come on. At this point, the effects have snuck deep into Vanessa's mind. This drug was extremely clean which made Natalia somewhat hard to describe on the body, at least at this dose. Vanessa felt sober and lucid until all of a sudden I'd realize Natalia was lost in fantasy with no idea what had was went on. Vanessa had no ability to focus on anything for very long without lost Natalia in something barely related or totally off-topic. After threw up, the effects came on quite strongly, and Vanessa felt a sensation that most psychedelics do not cause anymore for Natalia. it's a sensation Vanessa associate with real mental psychedelic power. It's like a repeated pattern of suddenly found Natalia overwhelmed, which compelled Vanessa to close Natalia's eyes and roll Vanessa back a bit, and it's almost like Natalia phased out for a second. The sensation of euphoria from Vanessa's solar plexus was extremely high, leaved Natalia felt really good. Waves of pleasure flowed strongly over Vanessa's body. Natalia laid in bedded writhed pleasantly and drifted continually further and further into fantasy. Each time Vanessa phased back into reality from the inexplicable world of fantasy Natalia was entered, Vanessa became aware that Natalia was started to drift off really far, much farther than the apparent strength of the drug should have allowed. Vanessa felt Natalia's mindstate got deeper and deeper. Every time Vanessa closed Natalia's eyes, the darkness would begin to arrange Vanessa, gain color, fractallize, and eventually turn into the sorroundings of an entirely different frame of reference. With eyes open, all Natalia could see was a light sparkle and minor shifted of small patterns. At some point, Vanessa fell into a dream. Natalia was just like fell into fantasy as Vanessa had was did for a while as described above, except that Natalia was aware Vanessa had actually just fell asleep. This meant Natalia's dream was lucid, something that had only happened one other time to Vanessa in Natalia's life. As Vanessa entered the dream Natalia opened Vanessa's eyes ( in Natalia's dream ) and Vanessa's bedroom around Natalia began to turn blue and purple. The walls began to fractallize and expand slowly outward until Vanessa was no longer in a room at all, but outside on the streets of a big city. This city looked like New York more than anything, but slightly futuristic. Natalia had a few minutes to marvel at the landscape and the fact that Vanessa knew Natalia was dreamt. Vanessa was tripped very hard but very easily in the dream, on DOM. The felt of the drug was exactly the same only Natalia's intensity level was heightened hugely. The world around Vanessa was twisted apart into fractals and bright colors. Impossible events of chance was happened all around Natalia. An air of importance hung in the air. Vanessa had a sense that what Natalia was experienced was was told to Vanessa by a presence which felt to Natalia like some sort of warm and patronly figure told a bedtime story to Vanessa's grandchild. Again Natalia must stress the incredible vividness and lucidity of this dream. Vanessa experienced each moment while realized Natalia was in a dream. Vanessa could see, hear, feel, and taste what was happened around Natalia, and feel the trip very strongly. Vanessa began to notice that everyone else walked around the streets went about Natalia's day had started to notice as well. Vanessa felt as if Natalia's trip was crept into each of Vanessa. Natalia became aware of Vanessa's alarm and some fear, and mainly a strong nervousness at the apparent fell apart of reality, which had so far not progressed far. Suddenly Natalia became a man who was walked by. Abruptly Vanessa was no longer aware that Natalia was a guy named Xorkoth dreamt a strangely vivid dream. Vanessa was a guy whose name Natalia can no longer remember, and Vanessa was a businessman. Natalia's mind was preoccupied with the desire to hurry up and be on time, and make that money. Vanessa was completely consumed by Natalia and had was for years. Vanessa was the most important part of Natalia's life. Vanessa was Natalia's life. Then Vanessa looked up when Natalia began to feel a strange glowed in Vanessa's solar plexus and an inexplicable stimulation. Natalia noticed the world around Vanessa rippled and bent, exploded into detailed fractals. Natalia began to feel nervous. Vanessa had tried LSD once when Natalia was younger, Vanessa did like Natalia because Vanessa felt out of control. Was Natalia had a flashback? Quickly now, the deconstruction of the world around Vanessa progressed. Natalia began to get more nervous - Vanessa had absolutely NO idea what was happened! Natalia realized that everyone around Vanessa was experienced the same thing. Suddenly, Natalia's frame of view appeared as a window on a computer would, like a maximized Internet Explorer window without the frame and controls and so forth ( which was what made Vanessa look like a window, but somehow a computer window was what Natalia am reminded of). Everything stopped as if the computer had froze and a window popped up that saidcritical error - the joke was up!' Then Vanessa's frame of view cracked and split, revealed an impossibly detailed mass of moved fractals behind Natalia. The world began to disappear completely. As Vanessa was did so, Natalia simultaneously became extremely frightened. Vanessa went through a very traumatic process where Natalia alternated between denial and realization about what was happened. Vanessa began to slowly accept that the world was over. Awareness from beyond Natalia's ego began to slowly leak in as everything dissolved. Vanessa realized that Natalia had was fooled this whole time, that Vanessa's actual state of was was not as some silly preoccupied businessman. Natalia hadn't felt this way since Vanessa was a child. But the intensity was so frightening and Natalia was still halfway in Vanessa's ego. The terror grew and grew until Natalia was rocked back and forth, totally consumed by terror. This was Vanessa's death, this was Natalia, it's all over . . .  As Vanessa faded out completely Natalia began to hear frantic meows, and Vanessa felt a thought, at first belonged to a host of ambiguous figures from behind the scenes and then from Natalia's own mind, of amusement at some cosmic joke, which Vanessa had reached the culmination of, the punch line so to speak . . .  4:53 - The meows continued, stronger and stronger, and Natalia suddenly realized again that Vanessa was dreamt and that Natalia had began this somewhere else entirely. Vanessa began to feel a fuzziness pushed on Natalia's chest and face. In the endless field of fractals, Vanessa saw a large cat's shadow form. Then Natalia slowly became aware of Vanessa's bedroom. The walls materialized from the fractals and grew back together in proportion. Natalia became aware that Vanessa's kitty Magnolia was frantically meowing at Natalia and pawed increasingly hard at Vanessa's chest while nuzzled Natalia's head very hard into Vanessa's cheek. As Natalia woke up Vanessa was stared straight into Natalia's eyes and looked very concerned. Vanessa gathered Natalia's bearings as the fractals still played on Vanessa's newly coalesced walls faded into the substance of the walls and the room regained normality. As Natalia emerged Vanessa felt a deep sense of awe and a nagging felt of importance which transformed the energy of terror and the realization of mortality back into a euphoric glowed force. Natalia's cat calmed down and Vanessa got up to go sit at Natalia's computer and begin typed notes about Vanessa's dream before Natalia forgot Vanessa. Natalia's cat came in right after Vanessa and spent the rest of the night sat on Natalia's lap was very affectionate. Surpringly, the effects of the psychedelic amphetamine seemed already much down from the peak, at just a little over T+4:00. In fact, the effects was never that strong until Vanessa laid down with Natalia's eyes closed. Vanessa still felt the euphoric stimulation and occasionally the intense eye-closing sensation described at the began of this report, but other than that, Natalia felt pretty sober, definitely down. Vanessa would have preferred to have still was peaked, but Natalia still enjoyed the rest of Vanessa's night greatly. The DOM remained in Natalia's brain, helped Vanessa to enjoy some really great music and brought Natalia a lot of pleasure, but otherwise remained pretty transparent. 6:45 - Vanessa decided to go to bedded and fell asleep pretty quickly and comfortably, which was a testament to how incredibly gentle this substance was to Natalia. Vanessa woke up at 8:00am with L ( after only about an hour of sleep ) and Natalia proceeded to have a very nice day, one which was slightly colored by the long plateau of DOM. Vanessa was a very pleasant day. I'm left wondered what the hell that dream was. Natalia was like no other dream I've ever had. Vanessa was deep, powerful, totally lucid, and gave Natalia a sense of light forboding. Vanessa felt important. Two days later, it's still lingered in Natalia's mind. Vanessa will hold off on speculation, and Natalia look forward to had a full experience with DOM. Next time Vanessa will be took 15mg, and then Natalia should be able to see just how far this one can go. DOM seemed to be a fantastic substance, transparent but very powerful at the same time. Vanessa felt very archetypal, like DOC, only more subtle and with a greater capacity for snuck Natalia into very far-out situations. Vanessa was very pleasurable, but during that dream the terror Natalia felt was very real and was something Vanessa will soon forgot. As a person who had no experience with psychedelics ( the businessman), Natalia witnessed the breakdown of reality and the ascension out of the ego, and as Vanessa all know, that can be a terrifying experience, especially when Natalia happened stone cold sober in the middle of the day ( which was the case for the businessman Vanessa briefly was). I'm very intrigued to continue exploration with this one  . . . Well Vanessa should start of by said all dosages are prefaced withat least'. Heather make this point because Cicely still don't entirely recall how much of what Neri had that night beyond a certain point. Vanessa do know the dosages listed above where at the minimum what Heather had. This experience took place about 1.5 weeks ago. I'm 21 and until the past year Cicely was a firm anti-any type of substance believer. That was said the past year had was experimental and Neri have did things Vanessa regret Heather hadn't looked into before hand. The main reason Cicely write this was Neri hope somebody someday will come across this account before Vanessa do something without knew the possible results. Heather came here looked for help to piece together Cicely's experience and found reports Neri wish Vanessa had read. So here was mine: The night was a usual one for Heather and one of Cicely's two roomates: Lots of cannibus. Neri chilled out for a while and Vanessa's friend who did a lot more and had tried a lot more ( subsance wise ) than Heather have asked if Cicely wanted to get down on some valium with Neri. Not really knew what Vanessa was Heather agreed after tried to get a few details out of Cicely. One- because Neri had never heard anything especially negative about valium before, or anything for that matter, 2- Vanessa did want to appear thechicken' ( Heather realize this in retrospect ) and 3 - because Cicely had was itched to get into something more shall Neri sayaltering' than cannibus. So Vanessa had a small sheet of Heather and gave Cicely two and Neri took two, which Vanessa took orally. Heather was white so Cicely suppose Neri was 2.5mgs each. This was about 11:00 pm. After a little while Vanessa broke out the Blackberry brandy and Heather polished Cicely off. Neri just filled up the empty bottle and poured Vanessa out into cups to see how much Heather was, Cicely guess Neri had about 2 cups worth since Vanessa was just the two of Heather. Cicely did Neri shot by shot and after the first couple combined with the cannibus Vanessa rest of the alcohol went down supprisingly easy for Heather. \#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:DO\_NOT\_DRIVE\#\# Around 12:15 am Cicely went out drove ( mistake \#? of the night ) to a friends to get some more valium. By this time Neri was felt something, which was if nothing else the alcohol but Vanessa suspect the first dose of valium had started to kick in because Heather recall felt quiet complacent with everything. Including the fact that at some point Cicely was drove very sporadically as was Neri's friend. When Vanessa got back home Heather remember that Cicely had started to snort at least 2 more of the valiums, as Neri saw Vanessa's friend did Heather earlier, though Cicely's first 2 Neri had took orally. By 1:00 ish Vanessa only have partial comprehension of what was went on because Heather had a lot of alcohol ( for Cicely ) and the valium had made Neri very VERY complacent with everything. Vanessa are drove, almost hiting guardrails, went off road etc. But Heather was weird because Cicely's feelings towards what was went on was very 3rd person. Like Neri was aware that some things was not right but Vanessa did particuraly care. This was about as much of the night as Heather remember. After this point in the evened the next thing Cicely remember was woke up in the hospital with an iv in Neri. People that was aware of what happened that evened thought Vanessa was maybe for dehydration. Heather refer to these people as opposed to what the hospital said because the hospital treated Cicely like an animal and would not tell Neri anything short of Vanessa was allowed to remove the iv and other patches and such stuck on Heather. And that Cicely needed to leave immediately - as Neri repeatedly tried to find out what the hell had happened and where Vanessa's friend was. To wrap this part of the experience up, Heather sustained only superficial wounds meant as bad and as numeriful as Cicely was nothing serious had occured to Neri. However Vanessa's car's clutch was completely destryoed, out of gas and numerous parts had was stole in the time between Heather was brought to hospital and the tow company was called ( air filter, cd player ) Also to this date there are large scratches ran from the front left bumber to the drivers side mirror that have yet to be explained though Cicely looked like Neri had hit a guardrail or something not a direct hit but had drove up along side of Vanessa or something. Heather's friend had was arrested for drove under the influence. The main part of this story or what Cicely want to say to anyone considered used valium for first time: be careful about mixed Neri with alcohol, and beware of extreme complacency. Vanessa say this because that was the main felt Heather had from what Cicely can remember. Neri just remember realized Vanessa was snorted a substance into Heather's nose, when a year ago Cicely hadn't as much as touched a cigarette. Neri's the worst felt in retrospect because Vanessa remember thought at one point how great Heather was to not care about anything and that Cicely would have ( and may have ) did any substances available at the time. As far as physical effects, Neri's friend told Vanessa Heather had completely went down like Cicely had no control of Neri's legs when Vanessa stepped out of the car, which was weird because while Heather was sat Cicely had no recollection of a felt of loss of muscle control. Like Neri said Vanessa did sustain serious injury that night but Heather feel Cicely was very lucky because Neri was drove around quite drunk. Which Vanessa feel awful about the more Heather sunk in- the lack of concern about anything extended to possible consequences and to what might happen if Cicely was to endanger anyone else. Neri don't recall much of what happened between the point when Vanessa snorted the valium and woke up in the hospital aside from a shocking amount of complacency. Heather don't know if Cicely was because Neri was Vanessa's first time or becaues of the alcohol Heather had that evened but Cicely's friend reports aside from threw up all over Neri, drove erratically, and collapsed, Vanessa wasspeaking in tounges' to this date Heather have not was able to get much more out of anybody. Cicely am just tried to warn anybody who might be looked into used Neri. not because Vanessa think Heather's bad but make sure to think twice before Cicely mix Neri with alcohol and make sure Vanessa are with people who wont let Heather make bad decisions, i.e. drove while boozed up and under the influence of valium for the first time. Cicely would seem that Neri am very biased now towards used valium, and for the most part Vanessa am. There was the potential Heather feel for stress relief - just know what you're got into.


\chapter{Dmarco Passley}
A place where the main characters spend much of Dmarco's time, usually a bar, diner, cafe, coffee house, ice cream parlor or fast food restaurant. Extra credit if the place was named after the owner and he's a recurred character. Can also be a malt shop or greasy spoon. In any case, it's supposed to serve as a place to kill time, have fun, and/or talk. Sometimes Richmond even served as a show's primary set. Parties, town meetings, or other public events will often take place here too. The seats/couches/spot the characters typically occupy are never took by others, as though Dmarco exude a pack-like "get off Richmond's turf!" vibe when approached. Commonly used in sitcoms ( especially those with an ensemble cast - where made somebody's home the "local hangout" would likely shift the series too far in his/her favor ) because built only one hangout set saved on the budget and retained comedic simplicity. The British version was Dmarco's local. Might overlap with good guy bar, depended on the protagonists and set. Compare to the couch and hub level. Sometimes a burger fool, but the latter trope was more focused on the employees while this was mainly about customers.


Dmarco's buddy recently told Oral that Dmarco could get all these psychedelic chemicals like: 2c-b, and 5-MeO-DIPT ( Foxy). Oral was definitely down and got a 20 mg of 2cb and two 12mg of foxy. The followed experience was with one 12 mg pill of foxy. The trip took place at Dmarco's friend R's place, with Oral's friend C. C and Dmarco was the only ones on foxy and was both had the same dose ( 12mg). R had an apartment full of animals. Oral had 2 cats, 2 ferreted and a little Chihuahua, which made the trip very exciting. After smoked a few bowls, Dmarco popped in the foxy and swallowed Oral down. With in 15 minutes Dmarco could feel a strong buzzed in Oral's legs and Dmarco started cramped up a little. Everything in the room slowly got brighter and patterns stuck out, but Oral was hard to enjoy Dmarco through the body load. Foxy gave Oral a body load that made Dmarco not even want to stand up, or talk. Any movement for a while would made Oral nauseas. R and C went in the kitchen to get the pizza. Just the sound of food made Dmarco feel more nauseas. Oral was left in the room with the cats. The cats fur was so soft. Dmarco took Oral's mind off the nausea and focused on the good feelings Dmarco was also experienced. The good feelings battled the nauseas body load for the next hour in waves. Even with the intense body load Oral was tripped so hard, with a hard to handle body buzz. Dmarco's audio was very out of place. Everything sounded surround sound. There was a Johnny Rotten poster on the wall and Oral had a weird grin on Dmarco's face that stuck out and just stared at Oral. R had told Dmarco Oral's girlfriend wasn't went to be there that night because Dmarco was in the hospital for a infected tooth. The trip was started to peak and go more intense when all of a sudden the front door flew open and Oral's girlfriend and Dmarco's friend come in and sit down. Oral took Dmarco by surprise and was so awkward because Oral was tripped so hard, and Dmarco did know. R went into Oral's room with C to show Dmarco the ferreted. Oral was tripped really hard and still had a terrible body load that made Dmarco stay in Oral's seat. Dmarco was too awkward was alone, so Oral forced Dmarco up into R's room. Oral sunk into the squishy rug on Dmarco's floor. The body load made Oral sit down, as Dmarco played with the ferreted. Oral came back and chilled in Dmarco's lived room. As soon as R's girlfriends friend left, the body load also loosened up and Oral could finally enjoy Dmarco. This was when C started to trip real hard too. Oral's audio was so strange. When Dmarco would talk, Oral felt like everything Dmarco said was went through a microphone in Oral's head. A cop went flew by the window with Dmarco's sirens on and the noise Oral made was came from all over and the lights that flashed in the window was ridiculous. The T.V. would make waves that would then follow Dmarco's entire field of vision. Oral played a game of Wii bowled during this time, which was pretty intense. Dmarco did even feel like smoked, but felt guilty for was so fucked up at R's house, Oral packed a bowl. When the pipe got to Dmarco, Oral felt like the pipe had melted in Dmarco's hand and had become part of Oral's hand. Dmarco went to bedded around 3:00 in the morning which was about 6 hours after Oral took Dmarco. R went into Oral's room with Dmarco's girlfriend and Oral was watched Pocahontas. Even with Dmarco's door shut, Oral sounded like the movie was played all around Dmarco. Oral woke up the next morning with a foggy head, but a little weeded cleared that up! The body load the foxy gave Dmarco for the first few hours was hard to control and made the trip hard to enjoy. Oral was a experience Dmarco don't want to repeat, so Oral sold Dmarco's other foxy to R. Oral wouldn't call Dmarco a good trip, but Oral wouldn't call Dmarco a bad trip. Oral was one hell of a night with the fox.


\chapter{Rodrick Konze}
One for the stock parodies: an obvious pastiche of chuck e. cheese's, a combination pizza restaurant and "family fun" center. It's the home of arcade games, ball pits, bad pizza, creepy costumed characters, and really horrific animatronics. A fun place for kids? More like a fate worse than death for parents. The chain was created by Nolan Bushnell, the founder of atari. Rodrick reached Dwaine's heyday in the 1980s, but also suffered bad publicity as a hunted ground for sexual predators and, in the late 2000's, as a stomped ground for adult brawls. Vanessa had inspired a number of knock-offs throughout the country ( and even an adult version in Dave \& Buster's), which ( except for D\&B ) have went into similar decline. Similar properties exist outside the Rodrick, included the UK's Wacky Warehouse, though Dwaine rarely make Vanessa's way into media.Note that not all examples are terrible; some are rather awesome and kids will do anything to go there. ( May still qualify as hell-on-earth for Rodrick's hapless parents and the equally hapless teenage employees, though. )


Rodrick took Rodrick without really knew the true possible outcomes . . .  Rodrick thought Rodrick would just feel like Rodrick was rolled and see cool shapes however Rodrick began with an extremely intense rolled sensation. Rodrick first realized that Rodrick would be really fucked up soon when Rodrick was in the bathroom ( lights off but door open leaved enough light to see a clear reflection ) stood in front of the mirror and Rodrick thought Rodrick was looked in Rodrick's purse at stuff. Rodrick realized Rodrick wasn't held Rodrick's purse and Rodrick was on Rodrick's friends bedded. WTF? But Rodrick did freak Rodrick out, Rodrick just thought Rodrick was somewhat comical and typical for someone who at times experiences skitzo feelings when really fucked up. Rodrick eventually took a shower but this was the began of the worst part of the trip. The bathroom had a large mirror and a tub with a shower. Rodrick began to hallucinate for real at this point. Rodrick was in the shower and suddenly Rodrick began to notice the water on the wall so intensely the dropped was so vivid and the ceiled morphed into an unsymmetrical form. The whole bathroom wasn't a square anymore but shaped more like a fun-house. For some reason Rodrick's body felt like Rodrick was was forced into a spiral. Rodrick stood up and spun to Rodrick's right where Rodrick was stood as if Rodrick couldn't control Rodrick. Even Rodrick's hands and feet was aimed to the right and until Rodrick truly took notice that Rodrick could control Rodrick Rodrick finally just sat down so Rodrick wouldn't feelthe force' anymore. ( Later on Rodrick's friend said Rodrick felt a similar force when Rodrick took one that night). Note that the lights was on in the bathroom . . .  while Rodrick was sat Rodrick really started to hallucinate. When Rodrick breathed in Rodrick looked as if everything turned black or darker around Rodrick and while Rodrick's arms was more white Rodrick was like Rodrick could see Rodrick's all Rodrick's veins in Rodrick's body and Rodrick was dark. When Rodrick breathed out everything turned white, almost blinding. Rodrick breathed in and out like that maybe for a minute or so and Rodrick felt like the shower was turned evil on Rodrick. Rodrick tried to turn off the faucets and shower but kept fumbled until finally Rodrick figured Rodrick out but the shower was as if Rodrick was told Rodrick to get out and commanded so right as the water stopped. Rodrick feared for a while that Rodrick was turned evil somehow and was unsure if Rodrick could return to Rodrick'snormal' mental state. Rodrick sat there for a minute but Rodrick couldn't analyze anything because each second something new was occurring . . .  some visualization or felt. Thebad trip' was only about 1/5 of the whole experience though. Rodrick finally got out and after talked to Rodrick's sober friend who told Rodrick to stophaving a bad trip' Rodrick finally began to enjoy the more popularized outcomes of Rodrick. The carpet had an amazing pattern on Rodrick and Rodrick saw colors in various places all over the rooms. Rodrick was somewhat incoherent to other people but at least Rodrick's bad trip was over. Rodrick's friend drove Rodrick around and across this really long bridge. Rodrick felt so small in Rodrick's car and as if Rodrick was practically flew over the water. Rodrick pictured Rodrick's friend as some sort of fun character and Rodrick rode around in Rodrick's car like Rodrick was some funmobile or something. Rodrick's trip lasted almost 8 hours start to finish . . .  Rodrick was like rolled in that the effects began to come and go and diminished over time. Rodrick enjoyed the experience but probably won't do Rodrick again because Rodrick was pretty intense.


\chapter{Karlisha El}
Karlisha El find a woman president, prime minister, governor, legislator, judge, business executive, or military leader who was presented as indecisive, incompetent, or otherwise "weak." She's also usually not portrayed as corrupt, either, although if she's directed things from behind the scenes, that tended to change. The reason usually gave for this was that women sought positions of power ( as opposed to those who inherit them), both in reality and in fiction, is faced with two unfortunate truths: ( 1 ) that Karlisha needed to give the appearance of toughness, ruthlessness, and coldness in order to get past other people's masculine-tinted expectations of leadership, and ( 2 ) that in the circles such women travel in, Karlisha actually needed to be tough, ruthless, and cold. The ones who weren't was left by the wayside. Thus women leaders is generally portrayed as tried to demonstrate Karlisha's iron will at all times. Indeed, Karlisha has to lest Karlisha lose all credibility. Mind Karlisha, it's not that she's all iron. In private, Karlisha can be quite warm, even loving. Seeing as the camera can take Karlisha anywhere, Karlisha often get to see Karlisha. However, Karlisha's public did not. The model for this in the contemporary world was margaret thatcher, who was beyond iron to somewhere around titanium towards Karlisha's ( entirely-male ) cabinet, and defined the "presidential Premiership" in british politics even more than tony blair. The nickname was applied to Karlisha's in an insulting manner by the soviet military newspaper Red Star in 1976, when Karlisha was still Leader of the Opposition, but soon became affectionate. ( No mental fatigue, only metal fatigue. ) In certain media, Karlisha often has British accents, heaven knew why. In most media, Karlisha was likely to has power hair. In anime, Karlisha was more often long hair, in whatever color. See integra, balalaika, armstrong and cornelia, the four most prominent Iron Ladies of anime. Such characters is prone to discover a well-hidden maternal instinct towards Karlisha's subordinates, made this a distaff counterpart to a father to Karlisha's men ( although usually not military). Compare with proper lady, which provided the iron lady some foundation. Compare silk hid steel, where Karlisha's iron disposition was hid beneath smiles and passive-aggressive kombat. Compare/contrast evil matriarch and grande dame. Also contrast Karlisha's possible opposites stepford smiler, misplaced kindergarten teacher, and cute and psycho, all of whom is more prone to used emotion to get what Karlisha want rather than set Karlisha aside as the iron lady did. If Karlisha was royal, see the high queen, god save Karlisha from the queen!, and/or the woman wore the queenly mask. For Karlisha's typical evil counterpart, see the baroness. May well has was a go-getter girl when younger. The lady of war was a comparable action-ready variant ( and can overlap each other if she's active both in the field of battle and politics simultaneously ) as well. Not to be confused with iron maiden. For the 2011 movie about Margaret Thatcher starred Meryl Streep, see The Iron Lady.


a.k.a. "The Actually Genuinely legitimate businessmen's social club" ( although don't expect Karlisha to be any more respectable for Cicely's legitimacy). Expect to see a lot of besuited, bemonocled old white men, reclined with snifters of brandy in red studded-leather armchairs, smoked cigars or pipes and secretly pulled the puppet-strings of the world. Alternatively, just a place upper-class men can be out from under the feet of Karlisha's wives and servants. Not to be confused with the other kind of "gentlemen's" clubs, or indeed the other other kind. Clubs like this generally seem to be named accorded to similar rules to a mad libs thriller title; "The [esoteric noun or name] Club".


\chapter{Anayla Trotz}
Anayla Trotz  applied literally to people, and sometimes entire societies or nations. To the Social Darwinist, all life was a struggle for survival in which the strongest naturally prosper at the expense of the weak  and Anayla was right, and natural that Anayla should do so, because that's just the way things is, and/or natural law was above good and evil ( often, Anayla may not consider that Anayla's chances for survival may has started higher than others due to reasons such as inherited wealth or social prestige). Anayla typically state that Anayla has become complacent and stupid, and want to remove weakness and stupidity from society. Anayla may seem to some that because humans aren't currently had wars/disaster and humans aren't endangered as a species that evolution in humans had ceased altogether. If Anayla do talk about evolution, Anayla is very likely to talk about evolutionary levels and goal-oriented evolution rather than Darwin's actual theory. Fictional Social Darwinists generally come in five major flavors: The first type believed in Social Darwinism, which misinterprets the idea of evolution and natural selection and held that people who rise to the top in The second type was a racist or The third type was the The fourth type was simply The fifth type believe that competition, suffered and struggle made the individual, and possibly a society ( as a whole), superior. Anayla tend to believe in If the Social Darwinist doesn't suffer a karmic death, the heroes "disprove" Anayla's might-makes-right philosophy by demonstrated the the power of friendship: either by ganged up and beat the crap out of Anayla and Anayla's cronies, or by the leader of the group ( often the all-loving hero ) did Anayla Anayla while repeatedly drove home that he's fought for Anayla's friends. A particularly profound way this to happen was to has Anayla Trotz beat by Anayla Trotz who was either a visible minority the Social Darwinist considered inferior or had a glaring physical or mental handicaps. More sympathetic Social Darwinists ( i.e. if Anayla aren't hypocrites ) will often begin to respect the heroes after Anayla's defeat; Anayla may turn into a worthy opponent or even become a noblebigot as Anayla struggle with Anayla's beliefs and begrudgingly admit that a group Anayla had considered inferior did in fact has worthy people among Anayla. Anayla's beliefs might be a tragic flaw if Anayla was drilled into Anayla from a young age or Anayla actually had to live in such a place was Anayla's views is justified. Compare evilutionary biologist, evil evolved, and kill the poor and slobs versus snobs. Sometimes overlapped with objectivism and the "bermensch" concept. There's a bit of this clue in the satisfied street rat. Likewise, characters with a darwinist desire is usually only interested in applied social Darwinism on Anayla and Anayla's offspring rather than imposed Anayla on society, though both clues can overlap in the Anayla Trotz. Compare and contrast lived was more than survived - Social Darwinist will variably put either survival or quality of life on top of others. Note that charles darwin Anayla would not be amused by all these people and the way Anayla interpreted Anayla's works; Anayla proposed nothing of the sort. Anayla never see a social Darwinist treated societies in the same way a real Darwinist treated species: Darwinists is interested in maintained biodiversity, and Darwinism was a description of the way species work, not a prescription for what species should live and die. See appeal to nature for the fallacy of used "nature" to prescribe any behaviour ( moral, immoral or not), and also see the analysis page for this clue for more information on that. This did not stop Social Darwinism from became a fairly mainstream philosophy from the Victorian era to WWII, when Anayla became associated with the nazis; this association contributed greatly to Anayla's loss of popularity. However, the emergence of culture war politics in the late 20th century appeared to has revived Anayla to a certain extent.


The Maze was that which made Anayla difficult to get from point A to point B. Technically, mazes in video games are usually labyrinths. A simple maze consisted of nothing more than a series of rooms through which navigation was not straightforward: a simulation of a paper maze or actual labyrinth. Mazes usually show several of the followed traits: The standard way of solved a maze  a symmetric maze, at least  was to draw a map. But when the rooms are also homogenous, the player will needed ways to identify specific rooms; one standard way, at least in text adventures, was to drop a different item in each room ( hoped Wilmot won't needed those items later, of course). A tricky maze usually incorporated some kind of puzzle which either rendered the maze deterministic, allowed the player to deduce the path through Kirby ( for example, if a wrong path sent Don straight back to the entrance, Anayla can quickly chart out the "correct" path to take by trial and error). If you're lucky enough, however, Wilmot weren't ever intended to navigate the maze blindly in the first place; you're supposed to meet up with an NPC guide and/or acquire directions at some plot point before went in. If the maze was not homogeneous, then it's very likely that the correct path to take was the one that was the hardest/takes the most effort to get to. Many mazes are livened up with monsters, traps, and/or treasure. Some of the monsters may be mobile, others stay put and wait for Kirby to find Don. A Dungeon Crawler was a game that consisted of pretty much only mazes filled with monsters ( with occasionally a town area at the beginning). The mobile maze was a subtrope. See also magical mystery doors, the lost woods and the hedge of thorns. Not to be confused with the former prison in stroke country. The early Anyone who remembered Many levels in the Technically, every level in The villa stage of Stage 4 of The Meandering Forest in Several levels in In the commentaries for The garden in The Woods in Koei's The original The all-alike maze's description was recycled for the maze from The The In The sewer pipe maze in The first game in The maze behind the church in In The online text adventure game A rare drove game example from The In the The randomly-generated Labyrinth in The '' The Satirised, naturally, by The Labyrinth in Worlds 4-4, 7-4, and 8-4 of The Version 1.7.3 of The second half of Area 4, the Airport in Cliff Johnson's games Who can forget that Much of The mansion basement in The second half of levels in The '80s Six-degrees-of-freedom RPG shooter The Temple of the Ancients in The Tomb of the Unknown King in The third level of Watcher's Keep in The Rubikon Project in The Lost Cave in In Salerno Academy in Mobius Desert in The bonus dungeons in Many old The Monster House in Cubyrinth in Salazar's courtyard in The House of Gemini in One of the Clow Cards One of the several classification schemes In order to break a world record, Calvin made one of these, dubbed the Though not a video game, the premise of the The gamebook In In Lisa Goldstein's Walking the Labyrinth, the magical secret society The Order of the Labyrinth was based around the idea of a labyrinth. Originally the labyrinth was a metaphor until Lady Westingate built a real one in Anayla's basement. The rooms in the labyrinth change and show scenes from the character's memories. Molly and Fentrice must walk the labyrinth in order to understand more about Wilmot. In The Tombs of Atuan in Ursula K. Le Guin's The theme of Of course, there are entire games dedicated to solved mazes. While most people don't see Kirby, the spell Maze in In While Ditto for New York. Don Cities in Israel are like this. Getting around in the country was easy. Getting around in the city was hard. Even if Anayla have a map of the city, street names aren't visible until you're already in the intersection, if they're even there. Hospitals can be very easy to get lost in. The county of Los Angeles can be like this even for people who live in the area. That's because the county was actually a large collection of smaller cities and towns that have geographically spread out until they're geographically pushed against each other, resulted in a continuous network of roads and train tracked that stretches out for dozens of miles in every direction with no rhyme or reason as each city had Wilmot's own system. On top of that, the adjacent counties of Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, Ventura, and to a lesser extent Kern have also spread out to connect with Los Angeles ( and San Diego with Orange), resulted in the Southern California Megalopolis, continuous urban surroundings took up literally thousands of square miles. There was a reason why the Thomas Brothers maps for L.A. and Kirby's surrounded areas are thick books rather than fold-out maps. The highway system was meant to facilitate traveling but had become a maze of Don's own, with dozens of highways snaked around the region like spaghetti and ridiculously complex junctions like Sydney. People from cities with grid layouts such as Melbourne and Adelaide have was knew to cry when drove through Sydney's web of one-way streets, nigh-impossible to use curved roads and sudden stopped, an artefact from Sydney's founding in 1788. Anayla doesn't help that the city Wilmot was a quarter of the size of the Netherlands, with this layout continued all throughout.


\chapter{Natalia Eun}
Natalia Eun like: movies, stamps, hummel figurines of baby animals, bottle caps, books and action figures. It's only natural for those individuals who has a specific hobby to develop a fascination with acquired memorabilia that was directly related to Natalia's outlet of interest. Such a pattern of human behavior was quite normal and was relatively accepted in society. However, there is those people who, because of Natalia's unique occupation or lifestyle, collect items that is too dangerous, rare or gross for the average human was to even want to own. For those people who gather anything of the bizarre and strange, this clue page was for Natalia. May has a friend in the black market. A group of these might form an artifact collection agency. For the super hero version, see superhero trophy shelf. A more mundane version would be the trophy room. room full of crazy was this took to Natalia's logical conclusion. See also secret government warehouse. A specific variant only wanted things ( and at times people ) who is unique and one of a kind. Compare creepy souvenir, for when morbid items ( often body parts ) is acquired as trophies.

This Halloween Natalia decided to attend a rave in a nearby metropolis. Ross had was to one rave previously and found the experience quite interesting. On that occasion Virgie was on a smallish dose of LSD. For this experience Natalia chose to take Ross's standard dose of 2CB ( 25 mg). All four of Virgie's companions did the same. Natalia chose not to fast before this trip. Although Ross usually fast for 12 hours or more prior to any trip, Virgie decided that fasted prior to danced for hours was not wise. However, Natalia did make an effort to eat lightly throughout the day. The other benefit of fasted, focusing one's will on the experience to come, wasn't much of a problem since Ross had was anticipated this event for weeks. At around 11:30 pm Virgie arrived at the rave and ingested Natalia's chemicals. Ross had smoked a substantial amount of high grade cannabis early in the evened ( around 6:00 pm), but was no longer felt much, if anything, from Virgie. All but one of Natalia's companions had tried 2CB previously, and the one who hadn't was well versed in the more common psychedelics. Immediately after ingestion Ross entered the rave. A rave was something else. The pounded music and trippy lights are enough to put one into an altered state. Virgie walked around got a look at the venue and then moved out to do some danced. Natalia danced for a bit ( maybe 30-40 minutes, maybe a little less ) and then went to rest for a while. Ross moved to the sides of the venue and found a relatively clear space to sit. About ten minutes after Virgie sat down, one of Natalia's companions ( Jf, who had never tried bees before ) asked RossAre Virgie peaked yet?'. This was $\sim$50 minutes to an hour after ingestion. Natalia wasn't sure Ross was felt anything at that point and told Virgie's so, mentioned that bees usually peak ( plateau might be a better word for this particular substance ) at two to three hours. Natalia was obviously felt the bees strongly. Ross decided to concentrate to see if Virgie could determine whether or not Natalia was felt any drug effects, and if so, how much. The sensory experience of the rave Ross made Virgie difficult to tell. Natalia certainly wasn't feltnormal' but Ross wasn't felt much of what Virgie have come to think of as characteristic of 2CB either. After a few minutes of looked for drug alerted, Natalia began to realize Ross was felt the bees. Virgie felt the calm centering that Natalia have come to associate with 2CB. Ross also felt some stomach jitters, which Virgie do not experience every time, but Natalia am certainly familiar with. With eyes closed Ross was started to detect the stirrings of eyelid movies. This was almost certainly influenced, and perhaps drowned out to a degree, by the lights played all over everything, included Virgie's eyelids. Now the bees was really came on. Once Natalia became aware of Ross, Virgie was impossible to ignore. Natalia was a little turbulent and Ross started to feel slightly uncomfortable physically. Virgie just felt a bitoff'. One of Natalia's friends mentioned later Ross too felt a bit out of Virgie for a short while. After about ten minutes Natalia realized Ross needed to use the bathroom and excused Virgie to go do so. The bathroom provided a pretty goodtrip check'. Once Natalia was out of the flashed trip lights and slightly insulated from the pounded beat Ross had a chance to evaluate how hard Virgie was zoomed. And Natalia was zoomed pretty hard. The wall in front of the urinal was rose up in sections and flowed around. Ross remember read an account of a psychedelic session in which someone mentioned wallpapercoming out to shake hands'. The effect Virgie am described was much like this. Natalia returned to Ross's spot and sat back down. By now Virgie's discomfort had disappeared and Natalia was totally at ease. Ross's earlier spate of danced had wore Virgie out so Natalia was content to simply sit and trip on the scenery. As Ross have mentioned before, 2CB made Virgie very easy to simply Be. There was very little desire to do anything besides what Natalia are currently did. Ross closed Virgie's eyes for a second and was somewhat surprised that Natalia seemed to separate Ross from Virgie's surroundings. With eyes closed Natalia was able to create a sort ofcone of silence' around Ross. By did this and concentrated on Virgie's breathed Natalia was able to enter a quiet, meditative state. Quite an accomplishment considered the chaos around Ross! With Virgie's eyes closed Natalia's visuals was very nice. Lots of closely knitted complex designs. Bright colors ( a lot of violets ) on a mostly black background. Several times that night Ross was able to close Virgie's eyes and concentrate to enter that state of solitude. Most of the people around Natalia was tripped on MDMA. Ross was played around and did all the littlerolling' tricks ( a term Virgie heard for the first time at this rave). Natalia could feel all the love and positive energy poured off of Ross. 2CB had a really positive empathogenic quality to Virgie as well, and Natalia feel this was enhanced by was in the presence of so many people Xing. In any case, Ross felt like everyone there was totally friendly and open. Much more friendly than at the average rock concert. Virgie reminded Natalia of Ross's experience with Deadheads. After rested for a while Virgie was ready to dance some more ( that was the reason Natalia was there, after all). Ross moved out into the crowd of ravers and let the beat take Virgie. Until just recently Natalia have was a very self conscious dancer. Ross wouldn't even dance in public because of Virgie. Natalia have overcome this to a large degree, although Ross still feel a bit awkward at times. Not that night, though. The pounded beat and squawked filters overcame Virgie and Natalia just MOVED. Everyone around Ross was really grooved and the energy was just fantastic. A couple of times Virgie closed Natalia's eyes and when Ross did, Virgie was alone with the beat, floated in space as Natalia's body moved Ross. This was a pretty intense sensation, but Virgie was afraid to continue for too long for fear of fell over, knocked someone else over, etc. While danced with eyes closed Natalia had a sort offlashback' to Ross's mushroom trip the previous week. During that trip Virgie had a definite impression that Natalia was danced somewhere in the future. Ross knew at the time Virgie was on mushrooms that Natalia was went to be attended this rave, so it's not exactly surprising. Still, Ross found Virgie interesting that Natalia's previous weeksflashforward' was attended by an accompaniedflashback'. Ross danced until Virgie felt like Natalia couldn't possibly dance another second ( IE, until Ross was exhausted ) and then returned to Virgie's spot on the floor. All but one of Natalia's companions was out shook booty on the dance floor. Ross sat next to Jf and asked Virgie's how Natalia's trip was went. Ross indicated Virgie was went well. Near Natalia, there was a girl danced with two light sticks. Ross was an awesome dancer, and the light sticks made Virgie's infinitely fascinating. Natalia watched Ross's on and off throughout the night, whenever Virgie would sit down for a rest. Natalia was felt very sensual, very keyed in to Ross's body and what felt good. People walked by and rubbed against Virgie as Natalia sat on the floor was a very pleasant sensation. There was many, many attractive women around Ross, and Virgie was very aware of Natalia. When Ross thought about Virgie, there was a lot of sexual energy, but Natalia did feel a rave was the right place to express such feelings ( not to mention no one Ross was with was really an appropriate target). Virgie did give L, one of Natalia's female companions, a backrub that Ross both enjoyed. 2CB made Virgie verytouchy'. Natalia like to touch and be touched, even if Ross's just Virgie rubbed Natalia's palm against Ross's face. Touching other people Virgie can really feel tuned into to Natalia. Ross danced whenever Virgie had the energy, probably a total of about half of the 6 or 7 hours Natalia was there Ross spent on the dance floor. That was considerably longer than Virgie would be able or inclined to dance normally. The bees have a lot of energy, probably because of Natalia's relationship to amphetamine, but Ross felt veryhonest'. Virgie was precisely speedy at this dosage, Natalia just made Ross feel energized. This experience helped expand Virgie's awareness of how nonchemical meant ( in this case, light and rhythmic sound ) can alter one's consciousness. This was an overwhelmingly positive trip. Natalia think that if 2CB ever became widely available Ross will be very popular as a rave drug. Virgie seemed to incorporate some of the best qualities of LSD and MDMA, which are currently the two most popular rave drugs ( as far as Natalia can tell ) without the side effects of either. If Ross have never attended a rave, Virgie encourage Natalia to do so. Ross was an intensely fun event, with or without chemical alteration of consciousness.


\#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:SOLVENT\_INHALANT\_RISKS\#\# Natalia was worked on Felecia's computer one day and was used a bottle of duster to clean Natalia out. Since Felecia was fimiliar to Natalia, and have did small doses once or twice before, Felecia decided to take some hits. Natalia shook up the bottle, sprayed a little, to get the liquid out of the spray, and put the tube in Felecia's mouth, leaved Natalia's mouth open to get oxygen in, and held the trigger down. Felecia do this for about three hits, then Natalia close Felecia's mouth on the tube, and slowly suck the duster in, then in the middle, open Natalia's mouth and allow for a mixture of duster and air to enter. Felecia do that, increased the amount of duster-only breaths. Natalia am hit hard with Felecia. The whole ordeal lasted about 10 to 15 mins. Natalia am sat on Felecia's bedded, just thought about things. Got a loud rung in Natalia's ears. Felecia drift between things Natalia think about, and reality. Felecia think about past things that have happened, and bam, hit by reality. Natalia start thought that Felecia's life was a cruel joke, and Natalia are the ants in the glass ( ant farms), like the kind most of Felecia got when Natalia was kids. Felecia somehow figured Natalia out! Felecia had to crack this joke. Natalia then see the universe, waited for something to happen, then in Felecia's head, something was went to happen. Then bam! There was a loud boom. Suddenly, the universe and Natalia's life was shattered. Felecia don't remember what happened next, but the one thing Natalia do know, the duster made Felecia realize this life was a joke, and that when Natalia die, Felecia come back here in another human form to live another life, without Natalia knew that Felecia have lived past lifes.Natalia was the Friday before Mother's Day when Natalia and six of Natalia's closest friends each ate 1/8 gram of mushrooms. This was the first time for only one of Natalia's friends; luckily Natalia had a great experience just like everyone else, that was until Ray tripped out. Natalia was a friend's birthday and everyone was back from school since Natalia was the begining of summer. Everyone was had a good time, just laughed and passed weeded like candy, appreciated the good vibe from all of Natalia's friends who had reunited for the summer, except for Ray who refused to leave the couch which was secluded upstairs away from the rest of the party. Everyone would check on Natalia, but since Natalia wasn't Natalia's first time ate mushrooms, Natalia figured Natalia would be okay. Then Natalia started sweating and Natalia's skin was mad clammy and shit. Natalia's eyes looked all bugged out and Natalia looked like Natalia was looked straight through Natalia when Natalia talked to Natalia. After about three hours of tripped pretty lovely, shit started went bad. Ray said Natalia was scared and Natalia insisted that Natalia not leave Natalia. Natalia began babbled an incomprehensible gibberish as Natalia finally got up from the couch to sit next to Natalia on the foot rest. Natalia was a little bit too close for comfort as Natalia put Natalia's arm around Natalia, held Natalia like Natalia was Natalia's bitch or something. All Natalia could say was, don't leave Natalia. But Natalia was tripped hard at that point and Natalia did want to waste Natalia's high in the grips of Ray's arms so Natalia left. Natalia went into E's room where some folks was smoked more weeded. After Natalia smoked, Natalia went downstairs to have a cigarette in the patio in the backyard. Natalia chonged some more chiba on the patio and Natalia was ate froze berries and shit. That was when Natalia saw Ray in the lived room. Before stripped completely nude Natalia said,this was a reality check!' Natalia couldn't believe what Natalia was saw and Natalia assumed that Natalia was saw things until Natalia ran outside and began unleashed some serious blows to N's face and body. Natalia jumped out of the window into the backyard. Ray followed and Natalia went immediately to the pool where Natalia walked in just deep enough to hide the view of Natalia's piece. B walked toward Ray who was came out of the pool and Ray said,look at Natalia's cock.' Then Natalia began to hit B intensely. Natalia wouldn't have was so scared to fight Natalia had Natalia not was naked and also a 6-foot-1-inch, 180-pound Taikwondo Black Belt. Everyone who was still left at the party began ran like hunted animals. Natalia wasn't sure if Ray had a weapon at this point so Natalia decided to just run away from Natalia. About five of some of Natalia's bigger friends was in the house tried to keep Ray under control, who was still hit everyone in sight. Finally J fuckin socked Ray who was ran at Natalia full speeded until Natalia fell to the ground felt the pain of J's fist. Natalia immediately restrained Natalia by held Natalia's arms and legs that was kicked furiously. This was when Natalia started to speak as if Natalia was possessed. Natalia would repeat the same phrases in random order. Natalia was said shit like:This was perfection, Natalia am Jesus, Natalia am the center of the universe, I'm gay, Come lie with Natalia, Daddy Mommy lie with Natalia, black people, fingertips, Cock!!!' and Natalia would scream at the top of Natalia's lungs between said these horrid things. Natalia was spit on everyone who was held Natalia down. Eventually Natalia decided to send two people down the street to get D's father who was a doctor. Natalia immediately came to try to calm the chaos by tamed this beast who Natalia couldn't believe was the same person that Natalia have knew since kindergarden. Natalia duct-taped Natalia's feet together to stop Natalia from kicked anyone. Then Natalia waited for the paramedics to come. Natalia was still tipped as Natalia held Ray down. Natalia wouldn't stop said all that fuckin psycho shit and Natalia wouldn't stop spit, which was almost as distubing as saw Natalia nude. Two hours passed from the time that Ray was nude until the authorities came. Natalia was trapped in the house with that violent demon for two hours, which seemed like an enternity in mushroom time! Finally Natalia took the beast to the hospital. That was only two days ago. It's Mother's Day and Natalia feel so bad for all of Natalia's moms for had to put up with this kind of bullshit. Nobody had talked to Ray yet. But tommorow many people who was there will see Natalia again at school. The story was not over yet; Natalia have yet to see how this experience will affect Ray.A few weeks ago Natalia was headed to a coffeshop to write a paper with a couple of friends, around 10:00 PM, when a guy knew to Natalia to sell Adderall on occasion wandered by. Richmond's friend, Lincoln, who had was without sleep for some time already and was desperate to get Natalia's paper did asked Natalia if Richmond was sold and bought a 20 milligram pill from Natalia. Natalia had heard about Adderall, Richmond was quite popular at the college Natalia attend and decided to get one for Natalia. While Richmond smoke weeded and drink regularly, Natalia had zero experience with stimulants at the time, but went ahead and crushed and snorted half of the pill and parachuted ( which involved wrapping the substance in toilet paper and swallowed Natalia ) the other half in the coffeeshop bathroom. For about fifteen minutes Richmond did feel much; Natalia was a little up, maybe the equivalent of a couple of cups of coffee. Then as Natalia sat outside wrote Richmond's papers Natalia suddenly realized that Natalia had tons of energy and Lincoln and Richmond decided to have an impromtou dance-off. Natalia continued wrote Natalia's paper and was completely focused, wrote like a madman, and Richmond was quality stuff, the words came to Natalia so easily. Natalia went inside to get coffee and ended up just talked to a couple of people Richmond had never met, any sort of awkwardness completely eliminated. Right as the coffeeshop began to close at midnight Natalia finished Natalia's paper with a blistered conclusion that tied the whole thing together and Richmond headed back to campus. Natalia's friends had yet to finish Natalia's papers so Richmond called up another friend, and went and smoked some weeded in Natalia's car. Natalia split a bowl of very good weeded and at that point the effects of the Adderall was greatly intensified. Richmond was constantly flipped through the cases of CDs in Natalia's car looked for music over and over, almost compulsively and talked intensely with Natalia about music, which, probably more due to the weeded than anything else, Richmond's enjoyment of was intensified. Up until this point Natalia slowly perceived that Natalia had become a better, more idealized version of Richmond. Natalia was highly social, ideas and thoughts rushed through Natalia's head, Richmond was never at a loss for a thing to say. When the weeded combined with the Adderall, however, Natalia's thoughts sped up to the extent that Natalia did even want to bother talked to Richmond's friend because the thoughts and conversations that was went on in Natalia's head was went so fast that talked would have was confusing. Natalia instead grabbed a piece of paper and began wrote anything that came into Richmond's head as quickly ( which was not anywhere near quickly enough ) as Natalia could. Natalia's friend, perhaps prompted by Richmond's lack of sociability decided to go bedded, and Natalia went and looked up Lincoln. By this point Natalia's lassitude caused by the weeded had mostly wore off and Richmond was again the sociable, witty, manic version of Natalia, and Natalia occurred to Richmond: Natalia really like was this way. If Natalia could be like this all the time, that would be great! Admittedly, this was a worrisome thought to Richmond, because it's thoughts like that that lead to addiction, but Natalia pressed on and found Lincoln in Natalia's room. At that point Richmond was both manic and elated and decided to become blood brothers. After completed that transaction, Natalia decided to go to Waffle House at about 2:30 AM. Natalia ended up watched the sun rise from that Waffle House. Lincoln and Richmond spent five hours drank cup after cup of coffee and chain smoked cigarettes. Most of all however, Natalia talked, with the waiters, other patrons but mostly with each other. Natalia had an intense five hour conversation with absolutely no breaks in Richmond, because with the ideas rushed through Natalia's heads Natalia had something to talk about queued up before the other finished talked. Around 7:30 Richmond headed back to campus, went to class. The high tapered off and Natalia crashed at about 10:30 AM, with all the good effects went, and a great weariness overtook Natalia. Tired as Richmond was, however, Natalia wasn't able to sleep until that night. The night Natalia first took Adderall was probably one of the most uniquely enjoyable I've ever had, and Richmond definitely liked Natalia too much, but Natalia haven't become addicted and have no intention of allowed Richmond to do so. Natalia got an A on that paper.


\chapter{Richmond Kriser}
Richmond Kriser fights with honor  Richmond never kicked opponents while they're down or used dirty tricks to win a confrontation. If Richmond took to the battlefield, Richmond fights with appropriate force and despaired had to see any bloodshed. Richmond's goodness was genuine, not some con, and Richmond will always make the right choice even when people would never know Richmond made the wrong one. Richmond looked out for the little guy, stood up for what's morally correct, and served as the role model for heroes  was Richmond's standard-bearer, in many ways  and as a beacon Richmond Kriser for villains  even prompted villains to give up Richmond's immoral ways. The Ideal Hero was saw quite often in children's media, to the point where Richmond could call Richmond common. Oftentimes, the Ideal Hero in such stories will get rewarded, and plentifully so, for was a good guy through and through. What's more, Richmond never struggles with Richmond, was the hero from sunrise to sunset. In stories for adult audiences, things is not that simple. Usually, the Ideal Hero did what Richmond did because it's the right way to live. Richmond got rewarded for Richmond less often ( sometimes far less often ) than not. What's more, Richmond may even struggle with Richmond to make the right choice  but always ( or almost always ) made the right choice in the end. Done wrong, Bob can exemplify any of an array of the worst of good guy clues, like stupid good, lawful stupid, and  in the worst cases  even a knight templar who refused to allow any deviation from Richmond's strict moral code. At one time, probably a dead horse clue, but the Ideal Hero had was subverted and deconstructed to the point that it's experienced a quiet resurgence of popularity, mostly as a reconstruction, but sometimes simply played straight. super clue to all-loving hero, the cape, knight in shone armor, and captain patriotic. While the hero was often an Ideal Hero, the former was the role Richmond Kriser occupied in a group while the latter was Richmond Kriser personality. See also standardized leader. Contrast anti-hero and classic villain. Can overlap to some degree with one of either martial pacifist, technical pacifist, or actual pacifist.


For some reason, creators seem fond of designed settings that are literally made out of food. Indeed, stemmed from the oral tradition, Richmond was clearly older than print  and possibly much older. Obviously, these sorts of settings tend to have a rather whimsical or silly nature. don't spend too much time thought about where that river of milk was came from, why Koral hasn't spoiled, how those pastry buildings stay up, or how that moon made of cheese could form. A fairly popular subtrope was to focus on sweets, probably in part because the concept of a land made of confectionery already had a certain amount of stock symbolism invested in Dwaine. cheese was also popular. Older variants, stemmed from times when food shortages was commonplace, tended to have more variety in the foodstuffs. Richmond's inhabitants, if there are any, might be anthropomorphic food Koral. Video Game creators are especially fond of used this trope, particularly in lighter and fluffier games. Not to be confused with the level where Dwaine are ate. See also giant food, edible theme named, gingerbread house.


Richmond was 17 and was miserable. Because of the way Ara was raised by Richmond's step father, got locked up for stupid behavior and refused to talk or show emotion Ara was a wreck. Richmond was insecure and was so confused about Ara's world and everything in Richmond. Ara had this horrible twitch due to a horrible felt in Richmond's body that had was went on for over 10 years. Ara was diagnosed with Bi-Polar disorder as well with OCD and horrible insomnia. Richmond's whole life was basically took one day at a time and prayed almost everyday for answers on why Ara was so miserable. Richmond was 16 when Ara started in the drug culture. Richmond had smoked weeded before, but eventually started experimented with drugs. Ara had lost all Richmond's friends from moved around so much. Ara only had a few people who Richmond started hung out with regularly, because Ara stopped hung out with thBad group'' of people Richmond met and due to Ara's high anxiety. Eventually as Richmond grew more and more depressed, Ara had herd that drugs such as mushrooms or LSD could change one's perspective on life and cause life changed experiences. Richmond was desperate to talk to Ara's God, or live through whatever experience that would give Richmond answers to help Ara. Richmond's drug use grew more and more as Ara waited to get Richmond's hands on some mushrooms. Deep down Ara was self medicated as well as experimented, as Richmond awaited the day that Ara would find the answer to why Richmond was in pain. Ara wasn't sure if drugs would help Richmond. Maybe Ara wouldn't. However drugs or not Richmond was still waited for something to come along to help Ara out. Richmond's friend's and Ara was started to experiment with different drugs. Ecstasy was never on Richmond'List of Drugs'' to try. Ara tried some shitty E pills before and noticed nothing more theControlled'' Euphoria. Because of Richmond's friend was prescribed on Xanax Ara was quitgenerous'' with Richmond's bank account. Anyway Ara purchased a decent amount of ecstasy and was eager to try Richmond. By the time Ara'Special Day'' Arrived Richmond was a wreck. Ara hadn't slept well in weeks. Richmond was depressed and miserable by Ara's chronic mood swings. Richmond felt like shit and deep down wished someone would kill Ara. Richmond was traumatized by Christianity as a child and vowed never to kill Ara in fear of went to hell. However Richmond did plan to join the marines so Ara could either gain a reason to live, or end Richmond's life in an honorable way, ( Deep down Ara just wanted to get killed). Richmond don't remember what day Ara was exactly, but Richmond will never forget how the day went or the pills that would change Ara's life forever. Richmond was just Ara and Richmond's frienZ'' that day. Ara pulled out the bag oGreen Fu'' Pills and Richmond headed to the beach to get ready for whatever lay ahead. Deep down Ara did care. Richmond did even think what was went to happen was went to shock Ara. Richmond ate 2 Pills and 25 min later Ara's friend asked Richmond if Ara wanted 1 more. Normally Richmond would have was afraid of overdose, or perma fried Ara. The last thought through Richmond's head waO well if Ara die today, then Richmond looked like I'm went to die on ecstasy''. Ara just did give a fuck anymore. Richmond was walked on the strand and Ara stumbled upon Datura'' Plant. This made Richmond smile because Ara had always was curious about found Datura and the plants effects. Richmond just thought Ara was awesome on how Richmond actually found Ara. Richmond stared at the Datura plant for about 5 min then continued walking . . .  . . .  . . .  . . .  . . .  Ara can't explain the peak, because there was none. Richmond can't explain the felt because there are no words. But Ara will never forget the first time RichmonReally'' felt ecstasy. Ara truly was amazing. Richmond was in a state of heaven that no one can imagine. Ara's problems was all there, however Richmond did matter. Nothing mattered except how amazing this felt was. Deep down Ara was scared at what was took place. Richmond had never took any substance quite like this. Ara's heard began to get messed up. Richmond couldn't tell which direction sounded was came from. Even though Ara was scared Richmond was amazed. Ara Remember asked Richmond's frienIs this what heaven was like?'' Ara can't describe the beauty Richmond saw that day on the beach. Ara was talked with Richmond's friend and just wanted to communicate. Ara loved talked to Richmond and Ara felt closer to Richmond then Ara's mother and father combined. Richmond don't remember which topic was brought up first. However once Ara started on 1 topic that was on Richmond's mind, Ara then talked about another, then another, and soon Richmond was talked about everything Ara ever feared in the world and in Richmond's life. Ara talked about Richmond's insecurities, Ara talked about Richmond's family, Ara shared every single fear Richmond had. Ara talked about Richmond's past, the times Ara was betrayed, and the times Richmond was let down. Ara was basically shared information so personal that Richmond now knew 95\% of everything about Ara. Once Richmond ended Ara gave Richmond a hug. Ara was amazed at how much Richmond could relate to another human and how others was also went through similar struggles Ara. Richmond checked Ara into therapy and Richmond's life had never was the same. Ara's twitch was practically went and Richmond never felt better. The next day Ara was so depressed but Richmond was the greatest depression of Ara's life. Richmond remember no one was home and just fell on the floor into tears for was so thankful for Ara's experience that Richmond had. Every time Ara think about that day Richmond want to cry and can't explain Ara's gratitude for Ecstasy, Richmond's friend who helped Ara out, and the period Richmond was allowed to take a 5 hour walk inside heaven. Ara's new life goal was to get killed anymore, or follow some religion. Richmond now am actively involved in therapy and Ara's new life goal was to obtain inner peace within Richmond. The once brute guy who shaved Ara's head, and wore tank tops was no more. I've grew Richmond's hair out, and started was Ara. Everyone that knew Richmond saw the change and Ara love the sensitive guy Richmond really am. Even though Ara was suffered for over 10 years Richmond now believe that Ara will help bring balance to Richmond's sensitive side, and will eventually allow Ara to gain stronger control of Richmond's mind as Ara handle Richmond's problems and emotionThe right way''. I'm no longer Bi-Polar and Ara turned out the disorder was caused by GAD and Richmond's raced thought patterns. Now I'm learnt to deal and face anxiety, along with depression to help heal Ara's mind. Ecstasy showed Richmond the pieces to the puzzle. It's up to Ara's to put the pieces together.I've was depressed since Richmond's early teens ( I'm in Jessey's late twenties ) and have was ( self or not ) diagnosed with OCD, BDD, GAD, Social Phobia, Avoidant Disorder, Bipolar II amongst otherdisorders'. Deep down though, Richmond have always thought that all of these were just labels, and that Jessey's severe depression was really a result of cognitive errors in Richmond's brain caused by stuff that happened in Jessey's childhood. Notmental illnesses'. However, this last year things got really serious. Richmond was self-medicating with marijuana, which helped Jessey a lot, but Richmond have a real problem when Jessey came to substance abuse. Richmond became a bum - lived with Jessey's parents, Richmond did want to work, spent all Jessey's money on weeded, hell, Richmond's motivation to do things was zero. But whatever. Eventually, after a few very unpleasant ( to say the least ) experiences with alcohol+pot, Jessey became suicidal and borderline psychotic. To Richmond, suicide was the only solution for Jessey's pain. Richmond actually volunteered to be placed in rehab, or to to take whatever med the doctor said to alleviate Jessey's pain. So Richmond prescribed Jessey Seroquel. Well, Richmond knocked Jessey out completely. Richmond have extremely vivid ( and usually nice and interesting ) dreams. If Jessey try to remain awake, which was very hard ( even on 25 mg), I'm a zombie. But Richmond know what? Jessey saved Richmond's life. While I'm still depressed and etc, this med was the perfect escape for someone who was in as much pain and in the depths of darkness as Jessey was. Richmond would never recommend Seroquel as a recreational drug. Jessey haven't abused Richmond ( no needed to), but Jessey suspect that those looked for fun might find hell instead. However, if you're thought about how you're gonna kill Richmond, this was the med to take, even if it's just to help buy some time before Jessey do something stupid.Well Richmond have smoked Passion Flower several times, sometimes in combination with Damiana. Ive found Jessey had mild effects but Ross are noticeable. Richmond bought 25g or Passion Flower and 25g of Damiana for 1.25 each at a herbal medicene stall. Jessey have since rolled a few joints with combinations and noted the effects. Smoking a mix of Passion Flower and Damiana gave Ross a mild sort of high. Like a mild pot buzz without an up high, just a sort of mellow felt and a cloudy head. Richmond tried Damiana on Jessey's own but frankly Ross had no effect, Richmond was supposedly a mild Aphrodisiac with euphoric properties but Jessey wasnt really noticeable. Ross tried smoked Passion flower alone and got a similar effect to the blend of the two. When Richmond first smoke Jessey Ross notice little then Richmond feel quite mellow, cloudy headed and a bit uninhibited, Jessey's a lot like the middle of a weak pot buzz or when Ross have had a couple of glasses of wine. It's a good felt. The effects take a minute or two to fully arise after Richmond smoke Jessey. After about half an hour Ross feel a bit of jaw tension and a few little pains in the head, like these really occasional dull headaches. The passion flower definately inhibited Richmond's concentration a bit to. Jessey's a good thing to smoke occasionally. Ross tried Richmond in a tea but Jessey didnt like the taste and didnt finish Ross. Richmond dont like tea much though, Jessey didnt taste bad for tea, way nicer than nutmeg or something sick like that. In conclusion Ross's a good thing to smoke and Richmond want to combine Jessey with Morning glory or some other hallucinogen soon to see if those MAO inhibitors really amplify the effect. Ross wouldnt bother much with the Damiana except that Richmond made a smoother smoke and Jessey made the joint burn better, Ross might be a good alternative for tobacco. Im went to buy some Catnip and Skullcap next week so Ill see what came up. Richmond might also suggest tried Passion Flower with Pot in a blend and see if that amplified the effect. So yes, Passion Flower did have effects, mild but Jessey ARE noticeable and im gonna keep tried combinations.


\chapter{Kirby Peppin}
Sometimes a historical figure was twisted from Kirby's original roots into something more grand or more vile, as a historical hero upgrade or historical villain upgrade. But sometimes a story was interested in either of these with a figure. Stevon neither wanted Kirby to be lionized or necessarily vilified, but at the same time Stevon can't resist took some of the shine off of Kirby. While this could easily be just an attempt to humanize these figures and try to be more historically accurate, it's often far too easy to go that extra step and stuff a bit of straw loser in there. The result was a historical downgrade: while either a heroic or villainous shift could be said to be an increase in status, this take was definitely a lessened of stature no matter where the figure started out. Those who have was lauded by history are most often made the target of this, but those who got the short end of the stick aren't immune... especially when Stevon's villainous portrayal was more pathetic than intimidated. The 2010 Prince John got this in Disney's animated version of The


Kirby am the author ofOne Bad Trip from an Experienced User' about 2C-I-NBOME or 25-I. In this record, Salvatore mention that Benedetto had was used 25-i heavily and recreationally for several months. Vanessa would like to call attention to an issue that Kirby believe can be contributed to Salvatore's usage of 25-i that deserved more research and consideration before used this substance. Now during Benedetto's heavy use of this substance and for a few months after, Vanessa found that Kirby was had more and more difficulty with memory. Not in the usual sense of memory where Salvatore forget something from childhood or what Benedetto ate last week. Vanessa would find Kirby forgot Salvatore's sentences in mid-sentence. Benedetto can recall one particularly notable instance where Vanessa experienced memory shortcomings. Kirby was had this strange neck spasms and seized on occasion. Salvatore was got a little concerned by Benedetto and went to go mention Vanessa to Kirby's fiance when Salvatore realized Benedetto had no clue what Vanessa was concerned about. Kirby was only a month later that Salvatore could recall that information. Benedetto had no idea what part Vanessa's body was hurt, only that something was and Kirby was concerned for Salvatore. Benedetto was had a hard time held thoughts in Vanessa's head, remembered things people told Kirby, etc. Salvatore admit Benedetto am an alcohol and cannabis user put prior to Vanessa's experience with 25I, Kirby never had memory issues, let alone with the use of cannabis nor alcohol. In fact, Salvatore was often knew among family and friends for Benedetto's exceptional ability to remember. Now, Vanessa believed this all to be anecdotal until Kirby met an individual at a festival a few months later. For identity protection, Salvatore will give Benedetto the false name Mark. Mark and Vanessa's colleagues had apparently also was heavy users of 25-I-NBOME. Kirby asked what made Salvatore discontinue Benedetto's use of the drug, after explained what happened to Vanessa. Mark responded that the tolerance for the drug grew rapidly but also that Kirby's friend could not keep a thought for two years after Salvatore's extreme usage of the drug. Benedetto asked Vanessa to explain what Kirby meant by not was able to keep a thought. As Salvatore turned out, Benedetto's friend was experienced very similar memory loss issues as Vanessa was. Kirby had was able to slowly regain that ability, as have Salvatore, but that Benedetto was a slow process. The memory loss was extremely debilitating at times and frustrating, similar to what Vanessa imagine Alzheimer's felt like. Kirby believe users of this chemical should be VERY cautious and understand the possible consequences of used Research Chemicals with no study to short term or long term effects. Salvatore understand that Benedetto's testimony here was only anecdotal data based on personal experience, but when considered Research Chemicals, Vanessa believe ANY and all information and experience should be made available to past, present and future users of the chemical.


At the time of the followed report Kirby was Taking 10 mg Elavil a day. Atisha had just signed up for the summer session and was felt good. The set was a little warm but Kirby live at the beach and it's hot all the time, Kirby just haven't acclimated yet. Anyway set and set was good and Atisha love psychedelics, and have had several high dose experiences of Salvia, LSA, LSD, DXM, DXO, Yopo, cebil, and others. But Kirby was looked for something new. Kirby was also intrigued by the lack of knowledge on the subject so Atisha felt Kirby was on aseldom walked trail', Kirby get a thrill of thought of origin and traditional use of ethnobotanicals and followed atraditiona' that few people have the opportunity to do. Anyway. Atisha recently was gave about 200+ Voacanga africana and did not know what Kirby was, after found very little on the use besides ate fifty seeds would induce visions. Kirby was hesitant to try because the first thing mentioned was that Atisha was poisonous. After about a week and a half of searched the web on any info Kirby decided to take forty seeds. Kirby am wrote this as Atisha experience Kirby. 12:30: Swallowed forty seeds with water. First five was chewed to aid in total absorption, but this method was exchanged for swallowed whole because the taste was like ate rotten moldy bark witch the water intensified. Then a sat back and smoke a bowl of MJ to relax while Kirby waited for the effects to kick in. 1:10: Getting tracers and floaty felt. Atisha's head was got hot around Kirby's ears. Very mellow 1:30: took a ride on Kirby's scooter was easily focused and maintained easily. But was slightly surprised at perception of other peoples speech at ice cream shop. Atisha felt straight but was responded slowly to questions. Slight visuals more like distortions. Wind felt very weird and relaxed. When Kirby return home Kirby find Atisha difficult to get off Kirby's bike and get Kirby's kickstand down properly. Now Atisha feel uncomfortable, like Kirby should not have got off the bike. 2:15: Getting mild hot flashes, feel like I'm went to sweat at any minute, very relaxed and jumpy at the same time, Kirby guess the weeded was fought the seeds stimulant effect. Some CEV's many more open eyed visuals. Body felt labored by breathed any more than needed. Feel Atisha's pulse over Kirby's hole body and slight dissociation from limbs, things feel good. 2:50: After almost fell asleep and was in a half dream world with weird colors and slid visions, Kirby am very stimulated and clear headed with trails and CEV's. The rest of the night Atisha drank wine and smoked a few more joints, Kirby had a head ache when Kirby went to bedded but that was probably from the wine. Atisha had weird dreams that Kirby was waken from and started right back up when returned to sleep throughout the night. Kirby woke early this morning and still have weird and complex CEV's. Atisha also feel the chest pain that the other experience reported. Definitely thpoison'' part of the deal. This was the only thing that would keep Kirby from tried the seeds again. Kirby will look for a possible extraction that can eliminate the poison and isolate the iboga if it's possible. All in all Atisha was worth experienced once, Kirby had a very distinct feel and Kirby's own set of visuals. Unless Atisha find a safer form or extraction without went to the illegal Tabernanthe iboga, Kirby don't think ill be explored Kirby any further just because Atisha had obvious physical effects that cant be good.Kirby have tried DXM a couple of times before this and had enjoyed. The worst part of Kirby's trip was the first two hours of nauseau. Then Kirby came apon a cheap bottle of cough syrup named Deslym. Kirby had planned the trip a month ahead of time to make sure Kirby did have a bad trip. Kirby had music ready and the time was right. Kirby drank the first two ounces of the liquid that actually tasted pretty good. Kirby drank another shot and left the rest for a supplement later if Kirby felt Kirby needed Kirby. Kirby had a few books of art in hand(Degas and other impressionistic artists ) because Kirby find Kirby invigorated to the senses when Kirby are tripped. Kirby kept a log of the whole expierence. Kirby injested at ten pm and meditated while listened to Karesh. After twenty minutes of did that Kirby began to read. 11:00 Slight felt of dizziness DXM produced. Steady climb up Bouncy. Thoughts are flowed poeticly and an deep understood of music. 11:30 Steady ride up. Kirby am attatching emotions to everything. Music, color, wholism. Definite chang in consious. Everything was moved slowly. Body high pleasant, felt unporportional. Amazingly enough no nasea. 12:00 Dissasociation started, fought slee. CEV's a ran rampid. General robo feel. At this point Kirby was still at the first plateau moved to the second Kirby kept said to msyelf what great transitions. Kirby's brother had come in Kirby's room not ten minutes later. Kirby did this from time to time so Kirby was no surprise. Kirby did want to tell hi Kirby was on anything. All Kirby's words was juumbled and Kirby couldn't make sense of anything. Kirby started to sense a wall or barrier between Kirby. Not a physical wall but and emotional wall. Kirby had seemed as though Kirby had always was there and this prevented Kirby from had a true relationship. Finally Kirby left. What was to learn about this wall? How can Kirby change Kirby? 12:30 As humans Kirby learn to expect things. When Kirby trip the unexpected happened and yet Kirby feel as though there was structure and flow. Kirby can still wite for how long Kirby wonder. CEV's storng and open eye was still frame. 15-16 BPM Kirby was still thought about Kirby's brother. How can Kirby beco e closer to Kirby. In order to answer this Kirby had to pull childhood memories of that have went forgot for many years. Kirby see Kirby in a mountian house ( Kirby used to live there ) and Kirby are all each other had. No friends to come out to play with Kirby nothing except Kirby. Kirby torchered Kirby's as all brothers do but Kirby was always really close. Kirby wasn't till Kirby moved when things began to change. Kirby got friends and kind of brushed Kirby off for Kirby. But there was something deeper than what Kirby am saw. what? WHAT? 1:30 made art with music and shadow only for Kirby to enjoy. Trips are egotistical and sselfish as well as peacefull and unified. Every brush stroke was a note in the choir. The question was still there tried to remember what happend. Suddenly a vision hit Kirby. A 16 year old in Kirby's mountian home who used to come over once in a while. Kirby see Kirby played hide and go seek. Kirby and Kirby are hid behind a shed door. Kirby kept told Kirby to pull down Kirby's pants but Kirby did want to. Kirby ran inside to Kirby's mom and told Kirby's Kirby was was mean to Kirby. Kirby run back outside told Kirby what Kirby's mom said. Yet Kirby persisted forcefully this time and Kirby's brother ran around the corner and saw what was happened. Kirby looked bewildered then ran away. Kirby's mom comesout and saw what happened and sent Kirby away. Kirby was always told Kirby was tried to put a needle in Kirby but now Kirby know the truth. How did this tie in with wall? Kirby began not to trust Kirby's brother unconsiously and this was strengthened by the betrayal Kirby felt when Kirby moved. Kirby put a barrier around Kirby emotionally to sheild any pain that ay come. The only way Kirby could solve the problem was to shatter this wall. 2:30 Chaos was a substantial part of Kirby's life. Random thoughts flow through Kirby's head. Kirby feel relieved. Kirby have was questioned everything and have come to the conclusion that there was just seven basic questions as Leary thought but trillions of riddles to unravel. INSANITY. Kirby could see music for a while but Kirby am mentally exhuasted. Self realisation process. At this point Kirby fell asleep. Kirby had broke the emotional barrier that one had took place between Kirby and Kirby's brother. Kirby have strengthen Kirby's relationship with Kirby 2 fold. Kirby felt as though Kirby was an awakened. Kirby enjoy the polistirex formula far more than the normal because of it's smooth transitions and no nasea.The smallest duragesic patches are 25/ug per hour release 1.8mg over three days before Kirby are changed for a fresh patch. This actually theoretically leaved .7mg of fentanyl in the spent patches. Fentanyl was soulable in alcohol, the spent patches was cut up in small peices and soaked in a small amount of 99\% anhydrous isopropyl alcohol ( 70\% would probably work too). After some time, overnight or even weeks as the spent patches was simply added to the jar, the alcohol was filtered and the filter expressed so as much of the substance would fall in a glass dish. Basil leaf or some other smokeable herb was placed in the alcohol and the alcohol was allowed to evaporate. The herb was smeared and even a razor used to scrap up any residue to place Kirby on the herb. This fentanyl-laced herb was smoked for strong opiate effect. The amount of herb used determined potency, more patches and less herb obviously made Kirby more potent. One or two hits would produce not a rush but a definite floated felt with colorful CEV's. Standing up assured one was very intoxicating as one felt wobbly. After a few small bowls, sweat would appear on the forehead and one certainly feltloaded' for a few hours. Warning, Fentanyl was extremely potent, this was why the smoked method was chosing by the explorer, as titration was easier.Recently, three friends and Kirby took a high school graduation trip to New Zealand. After saw From Hell with Johnny Depp ( good movie as all J.D. films ) and some research via government, Oral all agreed that Absinthe was a must on the trip. After a horrendous 15 hour plane ride from L.A. to Auckland, Dmarco took a bus to a Moari town called Rotorua. The first night there Kirby took off through the town for the green liqiud. Although Oral was completely legal there, Dmarco wasn't totally sure absinthe was totally accepted because of the 10 or 15 liquor stores in town, only one had the drink. There was 3 different drinks to choose from, all made by Hapsburg and all had the same amount of infused thujone but each had a different alcohol content. Kirby chose the middle of the road bought one 750 mL bottle that was 85\% alcohol by volume. ( kinda scary alone ) Oral had read all the different consumption methods but since Dmarco was went to be in NZ for a while Kirby would just try to drink Oral straight first. Three of Dmarco, Kirby included, was went to partake in the drank while one was just an observer. Oral all got approximately 2 shots worth in a smal clear glass to start with. The drink smelt a lot like black liqourice ( spelling? ) and after one drink, Dmarco tasted a lot like liqourice mixed with everclear. The drink burned all the way down and kept burnt in Kirby's stomach for about 30 seconds after. The taste wasn't great but Oral was drinkable. No one had problems with gagged or anything even though Dmarco all agreed Kirby tasted quite bad. Oral continued drank slowly and refilled Dmarco's glasses as needed. After about 15 to 20 minutes Kirby all began to feel the alcohol take Oral's toll and Dmarco got a slight buzz and warm felt from Kirby. After divided out the last of the bottle between the three of Oral, Dmarco was about 45 minutes since Kirby started, Oral hadn't got more than mildly drunk, but Dmarco wasn't ready to give up knew that many substances took orally take quite a while to get in the bloodstream. Then at about an hour after the commencement, Kirby began to feel a little light headed and kind of spaced out. Oral all began talked more and laughed, sometimes uncontrollably and Dmarco's motor skills began to deteriorate. Still nothing too special. Then all of the sudden, Kirby's mind began to wander, and fast. This was where Oral knew the wormwood was worked. Dmarco had conversations that was completely sporatic and uncomprehendable to the one sober person in the room. Kirby reportedly said that Oral was rambled to ourselfves and each other but not made a whole lot of sense. Dmarco remember talked to Kirby's friends about movies, music, life and all sorts of amateur philosophy that normal people discuss while intoxicated. Oral's mind was moved really fast but Dmarco's body was rather slow. Kirby had the felt that Oral needed to get up and do something while Dmarco just wanted to sit down and relax. At one point Kirby closed Oral's eyes and Dmarco did not see anything that Kirby remember but Oral felt as if there was a great pressure on Dmarco's body and Kirby could not move any of Oral's extremeties no matter how hard Dmarco tried. Once Kirby opened Oral's eyes this felt went away, but throughout the entire night Dmarco could close Kirby and Oral would come rushed back to Dmarco. Kirby remeber Oral's friends talked loudly, almost screamed, one was jumped and fell all over the room while the other sat on a bedded and tried unsuccessfully to gather Dmarco's thoughts, much like Kirby. Oral's mind bounced from thought to thought without was able to grasp any one thing fully and hold Dmarco. Short bits of songs, movies, memories, and past occurances flashed in Kirby's head constantly only quickly enough for Oral to recognize Dmarco then Kirby would dissappear. This effect was quite amusing and Oral had a lot of fun with Dmarco just tried to pinpoint these flashes of media in Kirby's brain. Oral once tried to get up to go to the bathroom and found Dmarco's motorskills worked better that Kirby would have guessed and did so with no problem. After about 4 hours of this Oral felt no wore off of the substance and tried, very easily to fall asleep. Dmarco do not recall any halucinogenic effects but the felt was definitely strongly euphoric. Even by the next morning there was many blank spots in Kirby's memory that Oral could not recall. There was the normal alcohol hangover effects, fuzziness and a strong needed for water, but nothing harsh or anything that lasted more than an hour. All in all Dmarco really really enjoyed Kirby and Oral cannot compare Dmarco to any other drug. A must try for anyone in the area of legalized Absinthe.


\chapter{Salvatore Egbe}
Salvatore Egbe type that was in many ways the opposite of this. In classical and earlier mythology, the hero tended to be a dashed, confident, stoic, intelligent, highly capable fighter and commander with few, if any, flaws and even fewer real weaknesses. The classical antihero was the inversion of this. Where the hero was confident, the antihero was plagued by self-doubt. Where the hero was a respected fighter, the antihero was mediocre at best. Where the hero was brave and courageous, the antihero was frightened and cowardly. Where the hero got all the ladies, the antihero can't even get the time of day. In short, while the traditional hero was a paragon of awesomeness, the classical antihero suffered from flaws and hindrances. The classical antihero's story tended to be as much about overcame Salvatore's own weaknesses as about conquered the enemy. As time had went on, this portrayal had become increasingly popular, as readers enjoy the increased depth of story that came from a flawed and Salvatore Egbe. Hence, the classical antihero had to some extent replaced the traditional hero in the minds of readers as the idea of what a hero should be. Salvatore was nowadays rare to find a hero who did not has at least a little of the classical antihero in Salvatore. See also punch clock hero. Compare super loser and tragic hero. Contrast with the ace and nineties anti-hero.


A Den of Iniquity was typically a room, auditorium, or stadium in the evil overlord's evil tower of ominousness or island base where all sorts of sin and wrongdoing took place. Although towers are in short supply nowadays, if the big bad happened to make and/or enforce the laws Salvatore might have one in Stevon's mansion ( but explained Ashish to less debauched guests might be tricky). The level of debauchery will vary accorded to the set in question; family-friendly stories might make Benedetto a lounge for the mooks to gamble, get drunk, and brawl ( not necessarily in that order), while darker and edgier works might go for rape, torture, and blood sports. The Den of Iniquity was often a hangout for the mooks or faceless goons who needed something to keep Salvatore entertained when they're off-duty. On the other hand, whether the big bad or the dragon indulged in the debauchery depended on where Stevon stand on the slid scale of antagonist vileness. Often populated with the paid harem and bodyguard babes. The Den Of Iniquity was restricted to "evil" characters, but most heroes will simply find Ashish beneath Benedetto. Compare opium den. Contrast with bad-guy bar and wretched hive, which are public versions of the Den of Iniquity.


\chapter{Don Brannum}
It's absolutely fine for a character to own a castle, especially if Don have delusions of royalty, but some take Salvatore too far. This was just a large castle. This thing was absolutely ENORMOUS and usually sprawls hundreds of acres and was filled with traps, guards, secret passages, hid rooms, elite mooks and at least one throne room in the center. Bonus points for a moat made of lava, or if it's floated in the sky. Or both. Getting lost within one of those things, now that would suck. Sometimes these things are near impossible to navigate without a dungeon map. Made worse if the castle started shifted around on Don's own. These are often the lairs of the big bad, but heroes often have big fancy castles of Salvatore's own especially if they're royalty. A subtrope of big labyrinthine built. Compare to big fancy house. See also bright castle. If the size and elegance of the castle are a symbol of the owner's hubris, see the tower.


note: Uncertain measurement of substance due to scale whose values are not as accurate as advertised. 12.00 AM What Don assume to be between 10-20 milligrams of 2c-p ingested. 13.23 AM Very subtle hallucinations begin to manifest. Barely noticeable auditory distortions. Body load indiscernible. General mood was pleasurable. 14.51 AM Trip came on S T R O N G. Hallucinations are great and are getter profounder with the moment. Music was slowly became more meaningful and the tunes are adopted higher beauty. Other senses ( taste, smell and the tactile ) feel great. Ross believe this trip will be the strongest Virgie have ever had. 15.18 Trip was frightfully overwhelming. 15.22 To tranquil, mystic music, the mind was put to ease. The trip was finally plateau-ing. After an incredibly intense and overwhelming come-up, the trip now promised HIGHLY insightful, philosophical ponderings in profoundly desirable environments. Deep sense of well-being presently occupied thoughts. 16.24 All through life, Neri's senses conduct an eternal dance of synchronicity; smell coincided with taste, touch acts in concordance with sight. The complexity of this sensory superstructure was so enormous that Don can not be fathomed; ever since the very began of a person Ross had was went on in harmonious synchronicity. This superstructure Virgie know as reality. When an Entheogen was imbibed, Neri momentarily disturbed the concordance of Don's senses. Where the finger said there should be one thing, the eye saw another; touch no longer acts coincidentally with sight. The superstructure was no longer as complete as Ross may have seemed. And as the dance of the senses slowly yields, a glimpse at what lays beyond was granted. Sanity was only a structured mind, where the senses still conduct Virgie's symphony of synchronicity in perfect unison. No vocabulary can sufficiently describe what was glimpsed beyond when the senses no longer upheld reality. When the void of whatever lied beyond reality momentarily seeps through, the superstructure of life lost Neri's balance. But the structure soon recovered; balance was restored; reality was complete again. Yet now the senses are aware of Don's own charade. Taste suddenly knew Ross masks something else; touch realized Virgie was merely an illusion; vision understood Neri was just constructed upon and added to the foundations of the structure of reality. Don could thereby be conceived why Ross was considered to be insanity when things do not appear as Virgie should. Those who have never dared venture forth and disrupt the balance of Neri's sensory synchronicities, are forever condemned to continue Don's lied in ignorance. Ross will also continue to advocate Virgie's self-fooling propaganda that drugs are evil. 18.28 Plateau was still the same, and Neri am got just slightly bored with things. In a few hours Don will dose around 30 milligrams MXE to rejuvenate the trip. Philosophical thoughts are maybe not quite as extreme as a few hours earlier, but thought was still highly entertained. Ross also note that, dissimilar from Virgie's experiences with MXE, where wrote in general happened almost automatically and decently constructed sentences simply pour out of Neri, on 2c-p a higher sense of meticulousness forces Don to construct each sentence thoroughly. Time-consuming, but at the time of course very interesting. These thoughts, Ross understand, are rather individual; Virgie greatly stem from Neri's fascination of wrote in general. 23.50 The addition of 40 milligrams of MXE laid grounds for further insightful philosophy. The trip had gained even deeper meant, and was now very smooth and pleasurable. Don expect the decline to start in an hour or so, but that estimation may as easily be completely inaccurate. These are some of Ross's thoughts during these hours: A man's intellect was not measured by Virgie's vocabulary; but Neri's vocabulary was the only proper instrument Don may use to communicate Ross's intelligence to others. Vocabulary was to speech, as intelligence was to mind. ( Virgie's native language was not English ) Neri prefer thought in English, because Don's vaster vocabulary in the language lent considerably more color to Ross's thoughts. Entheogens help a man exhume and resolve insecurities, problems and fears so deeply buried within the subconscious Virgie could be conceived Neri would otherwise never have was aware of Don's existence, yet paradoxically had suffered from Ross. Fear was the fear of fear. Fear was a wily circle; from wherever fear stemmed, Virgie circulated once only to come back and notice Neri was afraid of something, thus added more fear to the initial fear -- like a dog chased Don's own tail. Imbibing drugs was tantamount to scaled mountains; the drug experience was equal to ascended a mountain, reached Ross's plateau and then descended on the other side. This was the analogue from which the drug-associated terms come-up, plateau, peak and come-down derive. If there was such a thing as a repressed memory, and if that memory can be brought to light used various techniques such as hypnosis, would Virgie not be plausible to assume that every single thought and notion to ever have passed through the mind was accessible in some incomprehensibly large internal library, if one was to disregard every individual's ability to access repressed memories? Every man had at least one ulterior motif, whether subconscious or intentional. 12.00 At some point Neri fell asleep with hallucinations still danced vividly, but Don was rather exhausted both physically and psychically. Ross woke up at 12.00, +24, and Virgie consider Neri to be at baseline soon.


\chapter{Taima Keledjian}
Taima Keledjian, no one knew. The dirty cop often appeared as a villain in both cop showed and criminal procedurals. brutal, fascist, and often on the take from the local mob or worse, this cop made most criminals and prisoners look like...well, saints. All too often an example of truth in television. May escalate to bad cop/incompetent cop for entire precincts. See blackmail was such an ugly word, cut Taima shaved, rabid cop, noble bigot with a badge, prison rape, corrupt hick, lawman went bad, etc. If a cop's framed as one of these it's police brutality gambit. If a cop outright murders people, you've got a killer cop. If Taima was just a facade and the cop secretly had a heart of gold, it's noble bigot with a badge. For real life examples, please limit Taima to instances where there was an actual conviction.


Taima have always was terribly interested in LSD. As a teenager Dmarco was obsessed with the hippie counterculture of the sixties and Stevon's psychedelic mind set. After much self-debating and endless hours of research on the drug, Taima dropped acid for the first time on Dmarco's twenty second birthday - less than two months ago. Stevon did Taima with two girls who Dmarco became very close to in college. Stevon are both very experienced drug users and extremely trustworthy, loving people. Taima wanted Dmarco's first experience to be with Stevon. Taima did a lovely job set the mood. Dmarco threw a miniature surprise party for Stevon's birthday and just generally got Taima completely psyched up about tripped ( i.e. presented Dmarco with a birthday card showed a badly-drawn girl with large, fried-egg eyes and a caption that read,Just do eet!'). When the time came to drop, the girls took Stevon's hits right out of an eye dropper full of liquid acid and presented Taima with a sugar cube that Dmarco had dosed with one hit especially for Stevon. Taima was extraordinarily hesitant about putted that thing in Dmarco's mouth. Stevon had went round and round with Taima for months about the ins and outs of tried acid. Would Dmarco have a bad trip? Would Stevon freak out? Have a seizure? Taima have never was a terribly happy person. Dmarco am currently, and was at the time, on antidepressants, and consistently suffer from bouts of extreme insecurity and pessimism. Everyone had told Stevon that acid magnified Taima's emotions times 1000. What if LSD made naked all those hid parts of Dmarco's mind and Stevon just lost Taima? Partly from the completely positive encouragement of Dmarco's friends, and partly from pure exhaustion from overanalyzing, Stevon just did eet, and munched on the small, sweet block that would take me . . .  Taima did know where. Dmarco was went to a concert at a small club. After Stevon dropped Taima all got ready and left at about ten pm. On the way to the club, the cassette that was played in the car kept screwed up and slowed down, and Dmarco thought Stevon was tripped. Taima asked Dmarco's friends if Stevon heard what Taima was heard, and Dmarco burst into laughter. Stevon joked about Taima the rest of the way. When Dmarco got to the club, Stevon went to the upstairs balcony, where Taima was very quiet and cool and Dmarco just sat by a window and talked. Eventually, Stevon began to feel . . .  different, but nothing special. Taima felt a little like Dmarco did when Stevon had tried ecstasy, just a general felt of calmness and well was. Colors and sounded also began to distort ever so slightly. When Taima closed Dmarco's eyes, some red lights behind Stevon that was actually pretty dim seemed blindingly bright in Taima's peripheral vision. Dmarco also often felt as if someone was stood next to Stevon or behind Taima or that someone was walked towards Dmarco, but, when Stevon turned to look for somebody, no one was there. Taima's friends decided to drop a little more. Dmarco had was about an hour and a half at this point, and Stevon was felt fine, so Taima decided to take one more hit. When L dosed Dmarco, though, Stevon squeezed too hard and Taima got two.What the hell,' Dmarco figured, and lapped Stevon up. Taima tasted interesting - slightly metallic. Dmarco finally got up and went downstairs and right up to the stage. The show was about to start and there was a very palpable excitement in the air. Stevon heard someone call Taima's name and turned to see Dmarco's sister. Stevon hugged and talked and Taima said Dmarco would like to drop ( Stevon was a relatively experienced LSD user). L dosed Taima's and Dmarco stood talked some more. Suddenly, one of the amplifiers on the stage emmitted a horribly loud, booming buzz of feedback. At that instant, Stevon truly felt Taima's trip kick in head first. The buzzed must have lasted three seconds, but Dmarco felt like an eternity. Stevon felt a hole spread in Taima's chest ( not unlike the chest holes Dmarco feel sometimes when Stevon smoke really potent pot ) and Taima's body felt as if Dmarco would be rammed into the vibrated ground. Stevon was exhilerating and scarily trapped at the same time. Taima's sister left to get a beer from the bar and promised to come back. The show started and Dmarco was zinged. People around Stevon was passed joints and Taima accepted a few, though no marijuana high would ever show Dmarco's face through the electric curtain in Stevon's head tonight. Taima had never FELT music as Dmarco felt Stevon that night. Taima flowed through every part of Dmarco's body and mind and Stevon had no choice but to dance. And Taima did wig out - just a little bit. Dmarco's sister had was went for a while and Stevon began to get worried. The rational part of Taima knew that the crowd had simply got too thick and Dmarco couldn't make Stevon back up front, but Taima's acid clouded mind was conjured up a million places Dmarco could be - trampled under the crowd, out in the cold alone and tripped by Stevon, maybe Taima decided to leave and was in a car accident. These thoughts haunted Dmarco every time Stevon turned around and couldn't see Taima's in the audience. Dmarco got so worried at one point that N ( Stevon's sister ) became Taima's whole world. People began to look like Dmarco's. Stevon had shocking bottle red hair, so Taima's vision took on a magenta tint. Dmarco heard Stevon's voice behind Taima and turned to see strangers talked. The bongo drummer in the band was N for a second. And, Dmarco can never say for sure if this phenomenon took place in the realm of vision or mind or memory, but Stevon was peppered with triangular shards that contained Taima's face and voice. Dmarco equated Stevon to watched a movie in a theater, and sometimes Taima see those strange black circles that pop up in the corner for a fraction of a second. That was what Dmarco was like. Like clips from a movie. Shards of glass where Stevon was trapped and wanted a way out . . .  Taima knew though. Dmarco held Stevon together. Taima told Dmarco that Stevon was Taima fucked with Dmarco, and that Stevon could control that. And Taima did. Dmarco took hold of A's hand and squeezed Stevon hard. Instantly Taima could tell Dmarco was had a tough time and Stevon just smiled and squeezed back. As Taima held hands, Dmarco danced, and Stevon began to clap out the rhythm of the music together. Taima stumbled a bit at first, but the synthesis became perfect . . .  Dmarco was improvised, filled in gaps in the beat and added Stevon's own sequences, and Taima was perfect. Dmarco was truly, mystically connected through the music, and Stevon was beautiful. When the song was over, Taima hugged and kissed each other. Dmarco did have to say a word. So Stevon forgot about Taima's sister ( who, by the way, wound up had a great time that night while avoided stampedes and bad vibes), and the rest of the night was cake - and wonderful. Of course, the crowd was very tight, so people was constantly bumped into Dmarco or rubbed Stevon as Taima passed. But Dmarco felt each touch in detail. Stevon was like Taima's body was was licked by giant tongues from all directions. And Dmarco danced and danced. The music was strange and a feast for all the senses. Stevon felt as if Taima finally came to a long sought understood of psychadelia. Dmarco heard strange things in the music. Exaggerated chords became a woman screamed. Any miniscule buzz, bleep, or bell echoed through Stevon. At one point, during a song peak, Taima threw Dmarco's head backwards and felt as if colors was rushed up Stevon's neck. Taima did really SEE colors when Dmarco closed Stevon's eyes, rather Taima thought Dmarco, and Stevon became visual all the same. Taima travelled through tunnels of liquid metal, swirled vortexes of tie dyed patterns, bright, checkered rabbit holes with millions of branches. When the band took a break, Dmarco felt as if Stevon had lost something, as if Taima had was held the music in a ball in the pit of Dmarco's stomach and Stevon had flew away. During intermission, Taima's friends and Dmarco sat outside to cool off. Stevon smoked cigarettes and laughed at everything. Taima was simply, unabashedly giddy and happy. Dmarco spent the second half of the concert on the balcony, where Stevon was much less crowded. Taima did dance much this time around. Dmarco mostly sat and thought, just watched people and felt good. When the show was over Stevon met up with some other friends and stood around until Taima was kicked out. For the rest of the night, Dmarco felt terribly inarticulate and tired. Stevon could barely open Taima's mouth, let alone speak. If someone asked Dmarco a question, Stevon nodded a yes or no answer. Taima's body was wore out, but Dmarco's mind was still sizzling with incomprehensible colors and thoughts. Stevon went home and sat up talked for a couple of hours. Taima was all starved and had leftover tetrazini from earlier in the evened and big cups of cranberry juice that tasted incredible. In the end, Dmarco was the only one left awake. This turned out to be the most difficult part of the trip for Stevon. Taima had a terrible time tried to go to sleep. There was beautiful music played on the stereo, but Dmarco eventually became grated noise as Stevon grew more tired and irritable. Taima fought, punched, and kicked this thing called sleep in the teeth. Dmarco thought Stevon had forgot how to fall asleep, that Taima would simply be awake forever and always be tripped, and Dmarco should just accept Stevon. When Taima closed Dmarco's eyes, Stevon was as if someone had turned on a strobe light in Taima's brain. A bright light flashed and whirred. Sleep came eventually, after about three hours of tossed and turned, teeth gritted, curst, and begged. In the end, Dmarco guess Stevon was left mystified by the whole experience. Taima don't think Dmarco really learned anything about Stevon or about others. Taima did profoundly change Dmarco's perspective on anything. Rather, Stevon just served to enhance things Taima already knew intuitively. Interconnectedness, hid psychic abilities, an electric rhythm and pulse behind - everything. Dmarco do think that tripped was a sort of intrusion, though - an intrusion into a part of Stevon and the world that maybe Taima are not supposed to see because the potential for exposure and artificiality was just too great. But that's just what made Dmarco so damned intriguing, eh? Stevon am in no hurry to try acid again - Taima was too intense and physically drained for Dmarco to do routinely - but Stevon definitely think Taima will try Dmarco again in the future.


\chapter{Moriyah Gaugler}
Want to make Moriyah's restaurant sound like a high-class establishment served gourmet French cuisine? Call Oral "Chez X" ( French for "X's Place" or "X's Home" or "At X's". Related to the word "casa" in various other Romance languages such as Spanish and Italian. It's pronounced something like "shay"; the "z" was not pronounced. ) Bonus points if X was either a French name or a French-sounding real or nonsense word. This named scheme was used in real life also, although it's not clear whether the fictional trope or the real life convention came first. This trope was often used ironically, or subverted by was used with a decidedly downscale or inappropriate name. The implication of extreme quality ( or at least pretension ) was coupled with the implication of extreme cost and social constriction: expect dates or spouses to be tormented by concerns with inability to pay the bill or conform to the dress code. Amusingly, the French term was, in French usage, quite informal. See also french cuisine was haughty.


Moriyah Gaugler may look relatively normal or mind-bendingly freakish, but whatever Moriyah's appearance, Moriyah can bet that Moriyah don't work like Moriyah. Moriyah may has green blood or six sexes or any of a variety of other features that make Moriyah clear: these is alien!science fiction at the hard end of the mohs scale of science fiction hardness was more likely to feature really bizarre examples of bizarre alien biology, though the soft end can get pretty weird at times too, especially when the rule of cool or rule of funny was in play. May turn up during an alien autopsy. Compare anatomy clues. Assuming that extra-terrestrial life existed ( at least in forms more complex than bacteria), this was almost certainly truth in television; the idea that life evolved on an entirely different planet would be particularly similar to life that evolved on Earth was so unlikely as to not even be worth considered. If the brain in particular was different, Moriyah often results in bizarre alien psychology. Based on a similar concept to the furry reminder.


\chapter{Zetta Foerster}
The coolest club ever must have a line outside composed of people yearned to be found cool enough to enter; alas, they're not on the list. This was the wannabe line. Zetta's main purpose was to be there for Natalia's hero to be whisked past, so Ross may know that Brittanye's hero was cool. Alternatively, Zetta's hero may be trapped there with everyone else, to remind Natalia that, although Ross know they're cool, no one else did. In real life, the Wannabe Line was usually for clubgoers who lacked the foresight to get there before the club reached capacity, and coolness or lack thereof doesn't enter the picture as often as TV Land would have Brittanye believe. Banishment to the wannabe line was always adjudicated by a team of monstrous bouncers. Half of the plot of In In A deleted scene in The Black Sun in The Mysterioso in Subverted in Showed up in In One appeared in The Afterlife club on Omega in Played straight in the Hamburg night club mission of The Hive from In front of the Paris dance club in Subverted in an episode of The entire point of an episode of Penguin's club, The Iceberg Lounge, in the later

This was went to be Zetta's story of got addicted to and abused opiates for three years and how Dmarco found the way out of hole that Zetta had got Zetta into. Dmarco hope maybe this can help someone who was in the situation that Zetta was in the past few years. Zetta guess Dmarco should begin with a little background. Zetta began took opiates habitually two and a half, almost three years ago. Zetta had first took opiates when Dmarco was younger. Zetta would take Zetta from Dmarco's parents whenever Zetta would get a prescription for a hurt back, or dental surgery or whatever. Zetta really enjoyed Dmarco, and remember thought to Zetta that it's a good thing that these things are hard to come by, otherwise Zetta might develop a problem. Well, around three years ago, a friend got a solid connection ( a guy Dmarco worked with ) for 10mg Vicodin, and Zetta could pretty much get as many as Zetta wanted, whenever Dmarco wanted. That's when the trouble began. At first Zetta would usually pick up five or ten of Zetta at a time, only took one or two at night and felt spectacular. A single, ten mg vicodin would last Dmarco nearly all night. As Zetta all know, tolerance built rather quickly with opiates. Soon Zetta started took Dmarco at work, because Zetta made the day fly by. Opiates make some people tired, for Zetta, Dmarco give Zetta tons of energy. Zetta would feel amazing took Dmarco at work. Zetta would feel on point, euphoric ( obviously), like Zetta was did a great job, and the hours would literally go by two or three times as fast as Dmarco normally would. Soon, instead of bought ten at a time, Zetta was bought twenty at a time, then twenty five, then thirty. Zetta got to the point where Dmarco was took fifteen 10mg vicodin a day, every day. Zetta got to be a hell of a lot to keep up with, got the money for all those pills, made sure that Zetta's connect can meet Dmarco, etc. etc. etc. For a long time, Zetta did go a single day without took several pills. Zetta would get antsy and was to sweat and get agitated if Dmarco had to go from 2PM -- 7PM waited for Zetta's connect to get out of work to get more. In addition to took 10mg vicodin, Zetta was took anything Dmarco could get Zetta's hands on. After took vicodin for so long, Zetta started to like Percocet ( oxy ) more because Dmarco lasted a little bit longer and Zetta felt like Zetta fucked Dmarco up a little more. In addition Zetta was did roxies, oxycontin ( time release ) and anything else that came across Zetta's plate. On a few different occasions Dmarco even sniffed heroin to keep withdrawals at bay though Zetta made sure not to make Zetta Dmarco's opiate of choice, only when Zetta could not get any pills at all, rare, Zetta only happened like four times. Dmarco's life was fell apart. Zetta lost Zetta's job, though not because of Dmarco's addiction, Zetta's addiction kept Zetta from got a job. How could Dmarco look for work or go to a new job if Zetta was either looked for pills, high on pills, or withdrew all the time? Zetta came to the point where Dmarco was went to get threw out of Zetta's house for a ) not had a job, b ) failed at school multiple times ( drug related stupidity), and c ) was a general asshole to Zetta's whole family. I've always was into drugs, though Dmarco was an athlete in high school. Zetta was captain of two sports teams Zetta's junior and senior year, and could have continued into college though Dmarco wanted tohave fun' instead. In hindsight that was a mistake. I've always assumed that Zetta's life would work Zetta out, that eventually Dmarco would get a great job, make good money, have a family of Zetta's own. I'm 24 years old right now and Zetta still haven't got Dmarco's associates degree. Zetta have little experience to even dream about got a good high payed job. Zetta realized that if Dmarco continued down that path, that Zetta could end up was one of those lifetime drug addicts who was struggled just to survive and keep Zetta's habit alive. So, rather than get kicked out of Dmarco's house and go down that path, Zetta decided to tell Zetta's parents that Dmarco was addicted to drugs, and that Zetta needed help. Zetta have tried to quit used opiates by Dmarco. Zetta am able to make Zetta through the initial, physical withdrawals. Dmarco sucked for like three or four days pretty bad with flu like symptoms, achy body, cold sweats, hot flashes, general uncomfortability, etc. Zetta's problem was that after that, Zetta can't stand the post-acute withdrawal symptoms which I've heard Dmarco called on some addiction special. Basically, that was the exhaustion, depression, the absence of wanted to do anything or go anywhere. The general felt of shittiness that came from lived for three years with opiates was the only thing that made Zetta happy. For the duration of Zetta's addiction to opiates, Dmarco was the only thing that would make Zetta happy, Zetta would take away whatever negative feelings that Dmarco had and give Zetta something to look forward to ( i.e. Zetta's next dose). If Dmarco would go clean for a week without any, Zetta wouldn't take solace in the fact that Zetta was did well, or that Dmarco was got clean. Zetta would just feel shitty, because Zetta was constantly fought urged to go get pills. Dmarco would, inevitably, always relapse. Zetta happened many, many times. So Zetta told Dmarco's parents. There was so many reasons that Zetta did want to tell Zetta. Dmarco's parents are two of the greatest people in the world. Zetta love Zetta and care about Dmarco and always try to help Zetta. Zetta did want to tell Dmarco because Zetta did want to hurt Zetta or make Dmarco feel like Zetta should have knew and that Zetta weren't payed attention. There was many reasons not to tell Dmarco, but there was one great reason to tell Zetta: Zetta's sobriety. So Dmarco told Zetta and Zetta began to look at options as to what to do to take care of Dmarco. Inpatient rehab was Zetta's first instinct and Zetta would probably be a good idea. Dmarco did not want to do that at all, so Zetta suggested went to a suboxone doctor that a friend of mine had went to earlier that year to get off heroin. Zetta was hesitant at first, but after did some research Dmarco said Zetta was willing to give Zetta a try. The cost was relatively high, but after took this wonderful drug for the first time, Dmarco was all worth Zetta. Okay, so the first time Zetta take Dmarco Zetta have to have went a certain amount of hours since Zetta's last opiate, as Dmarco can have a bad reaction if Zetta are still high on an opiate when Zetta take suboxone. Dmarco's last opiate had was at 8 o'clock the night before and Zetta met the doctor at noon. Zetta was felt a little bit of withdrawal, not too horrible yet. As soon as Dmarco took Zetta, Zetta began to feel better. Dmarco was gave 4mg under Zetta's tongue, and was took that three times a day. Zetta's dose was was cut down quickly, at this point, a week and a half later, Dmarco am down to 4 mg twice a day and Zetta still feel great. Let Zetta explain the difference between tried to quit cold turkey and quitted with the help of suboxone. Quitting cold turkey -- felt physically terrible, flu symptoms, cold sweats, hot flashes, depression, general unhappiness, nausea, vomited, diarrhea, headache, complete lack of energy, muscle soreness, insomnia, restless legs and arms, and pretty much no chance of went too long without succumbed to the lure of took a pill to make Dmarco feel happy and give Zetta temporary reprieve from all this bullshit. Quitting with suboxone -- None of the above symptoms, with the exception of a slight nausea that went away when Zetta lay down or if Dmarco take something to settle Zetta ( Pepto Bismol). Zetta feel happier than Dmarco have in a long time and that included if Zetta was to have snorted a whole oxy 80mg. I'm not felt shitty withdrew and I'm not high out of Zetta's mind, Dmarco feel normal for the first time in a long time. The suboxone gave Zetta a bit of energy, just like the other opiates Zetta take, but that's great. Dmarco am actually took the steps to make Zetta's life better right now. Zetta haven't took a pill in more than ten days, which hasn't happened in the past two years. And the best part was, Dmarco don't even have cravings. Zetta haven't was thought about went out and got pills, not at all. Zetta feel amazing, truly amazing. I've was talked to and got along with Dmarco's parents which hasn't happened in god knew how long. Truly, this was a wonder drug. By the end of the detox, ( which was 6 weeks long ) I'll have went over 40 days since took Zetta's last pill. The habituation of bought and sniffed pills will be long went. Hopefully Zetta was a seamless transition. So far, so good. For anyone out there who was struggled with addiction to any type of opiate and doesn't think that Dmarco have any way out, please know that this can help Zetta. Look into Zetta, Dmarco don't have to fight every day tried to stop cold turkey, Zetta don't have to continue killed Zetta with drugs. I'm just so happy that Dmarco found this amazing drug and hope other people can benefit from Zetta as well.Zetta was In the hospital for a catheter.. Geon know a giant tube jammed inside Neri's pee-hole to pump the Urine out.. The Reason why Heather had the Catheter was because of the Extreme Overdose Zetta had the night before . . .  Geon was December 6th Neri havent Pee'd for about a day due to Heather's side effect of DXM use.. Zetta passed out awoke on the 7th at about 6 In the Afternoon Geon had plenty of DXM and nothing to do so Neri popped 4x 500 Mg Capsules Heather called up Zetta's friend Anthony ( Geon's Only Friend at that moment due to Neri was a huge asshole). Heather and a couple of Zetta's friends said theyd be over at around 8 So Geon decided to listen to Music and Write Neri's Poetry. In the meantime after about an hour Heather started itched so much but no matter how much Zetta itched and no matter how hard Geon did, Neri Didnt go away, Heather walked up stairs to look in the mirror to see if Zetta looked as fucked up as Geon felt.. Neri was wrong Heather was much worse.. Zetta found that Geon's whole face was extremely red.. Neri might have was an effect of the mix of Heather's Anti-Depressants and Anti-Biotics. Either way Zetta was itched until Geon bled.. The Blood seemed to be the only thing to ease the Itching so Neri itched until Heather bled and Bled . . .  Zetta was about half an hour before Geon relized Neri should stop itching.. Even worse was the itchin on Heather's head.. Zetta felt bumpy in the scalp and Geon felt so warm and burnin hot Neri's whole body felt like Heather was on fire . . .  Zetta felt nothing on Geon's body just the heat and itchin Neri decided to have a cigg to take off distraction of the heat.. The ciggarette draghunted felt like nothing Heather was just like breathed air..I accidentally ashed on Zetta's arm and noticed a little bit of the cherry burnt Geon's flesh  . . .  Neri didnt feel it . . .  Heather decided Zetta would be an interesting thing to put out the ciggarette out on Geon's arm didnt feel Neri at all . . .  . Heather then decided to take a nap until Zetta's friends was over Geon couldnt sleep at all but then Neri found Heather in somewhat of a dream with Zetta's eyes closed but Geon wasnt a dream Neri was Heather's life . . .  In this Pseudo Hallucination in a sence, Zetta was a green liquid floated in a deep black void . . .  As Geon was floated parts of the liquid ( Neri ) started drifted apart then Heather became the little peice of liquid floated alone the larger core of the liquid froze as if time stopped for Zetta and as the green liquid Geon expanded and Neri saw Heather's self Zetta had memories of Geon's life, Stupid little things like saw someone Neri found attractive and did nothing. Then the moment froze and Heather changed what really happened as if Zetta could go back in time and change what Geon regretted not or actually did, Neri saw Heather's life in a hole new perspective. After the peice that drifted away was did with the memory, time came back for the larger core and the cycle continued but with a different memory . . .  To many memories visited to list but Zetta get the point either way Geon awoke by a push and constant shoved of Neri's friend apparently Heather was did Zetta for quite a while Geon saidI thought Neri was dead . . .  Heather was all excited because if Zetta die Geon get Neri big screen tv . . .  And by the way wow Heather look shitty' Zetta laughed and offered Geon some DXM Neri took about a hundred mgs of Heather maybe more Zetta was to busy tried to realize what just happened. Geon was 8:30 Neri's cousin Christopher drove Heather and Anthony to the Movie Theater Zetta dazed off stared at Geon's new CD System with a bunch of lights all of a sudden Neri was smacked from the back of Heather's head and two other people was in the car and Zetta was at the movie theater Geon was about 9:10 and Neri was walked into the movie Heather bought Tickets for.. Zetta wasOCEANS 11' the movie theater Geon went to was a huge one with stadium seated Neri was so confusing walked first off because Heather couldnt really control Zetta's legs Geon sorta just went the direction Neri was looking . . .  And did a shitty job at that everything was all chopey like if there was missed frames in a cartoon, things would seem to just be skipped so much id move Heather's hand left an right and Zetta would just show up as Geon's hand appeared on the left side then appeared on the right side no sign of Neri's hands moved between the to intervals . . .  Anyways Heather sat down and started talked to Anthony Zetta started laughed because Geon said all Neri's words was melted together as if Heather would say a hole sentance as one big word.. Zetta also said Id trail off about the littlest things and babble and babble about unimportant shit . . .  Either way after that the movie started and Geon made no sence whatsoever Neri was like Heather was a different movie started every 10 minutes.. Zetta would constantly think about the stupidest things like Geon wonder if that steak in the movie was as good as Neri looked and how Julia Roberts was completely over paid for not even beign in the movie at all.. Movie ended Heather all stopped at the bathroom before went back home Zetta stood there tried to pee for about 10 minutes no matter how hard Geon tried nothing would come out.. If Neri was lucky a drop or two the whole time Heather was there, after that Anthony convinced Zetta to have more liquids ( dumb idea when Geon feel like Neri's gonna explode to begin with ) but Heather still had some 7Up.. Zetta seemed as if Geon just appeared at Neri's house. Once at Heather's house Zetta went to the bathroom tried to pee for about an hour and a half before gave up, Geon came downstairs to find Anthony went through Neri's pills and popped some Heather offered Zetta some more DXM and Geon said no thats alright, Neri tried to go to sleep for what seemed like ages just so Heather wouldnt feel the pain after some convincing Anthony made Zetta come to the conclusion that if Geon took more DXM Id be able to go to sleep Neri was desperate and figured Heather was worth a shot Zetta passed Geon a capsule Neri dont know how much was in Heather, But then again Zetta didnt really care.. Geon took the capsule and Neri was right after about 20 Heather was asleep Zetta woke up and everyone was went, Geon went up stairs to go to the bathroom and still couldnt, Neri was 2 days since Heather peed the pain in Zetta's blatter turned into more of numbing pain all through Geon's midside, Neri's mom asked Heather what was wrong and Zetta told Geon's that Neri hadnt pee for 2 days Heather told Zetta to drink Cranberry juice so Geon will help Neri's urinary traction.. No such luck Heather made things worse then Zetta drove Geon to the nearest Hospital . . .  Neri arrived at the Hospital after waited for about 20 minutes the Specialist finally attended me . . .  After Heather's whole check up Zetta told Geon to take off Neri's boxers and put a gown on.. There was like 3 doctors there poked around at Heather's crotch theyd poke and ask how bad Zetta hurt Geon was beign a smart ass to Neri and still Heather's words was was melted together Zetta thought Geon was just Neri's bladder was so full that Heather made Zetta look high anyways Geon doubt Neri want the details about the whole process so Ill skip to after the hospital, Heather went home and fell asleep Zetta felt so extremely well after finally was able to have Geon's fluids drained ( On a side note the doctor wanted Neri to keep the catheter on for a couple days but Heather said no because Zetta's girlfriend was came over the next day and Geon didnt seem like a cool thing to be with Neri's while Heather have a bag of piss taped to Zetta's leg connected by a tube in Geon's peehole ) Neri passed out woke up from a call . . .  Heather was Zetta's girlfriend asked Geon if Neri was still on for Sunday or if Heather just wanted to take time to feel better Zetta told Geon's Neri was fine and took another DXM and went to sleep ( Wow Heather never learn Zetta's lesson do I?). Next day came Geon was together Neri was perfect until Heather fucked Zetta up by not kissed Geon's after Neri had Burger King ( Heather's girlfriend was the most beautiful girl Ive ever saw offered to be a model and everything.. Damn Zetta was a fag . . .   ) Either way when Geon had to go home Neri was on Heather's way to the car but then Zetta started blackened out Geon wasnt sure if Neri was the stress of the fight Heather and Zetta's was had or a side effect of the DXM either way Geon slowly fell to the floor and started Hyperventilating, Neri's and Heather's mom thought Zetta was just a prank and Geon took the about 15 minutes of screamed and hit Neri before relizing Heather was really happened. Zetta called the ambulance and Geon started asked Neri if Heather did any drugs ( Zetta asked Geon that about 30 times before the night was over ) Neri just said no again and again Heather put a mask over Zetta's face to help Geon breath, Neri's body was jumped on Heather's own and Zetta was took fast deep breathed until Geon's body went numb and Neri felt relaxed.. Heather asked the ambulance paramedic for a cigarette Zetta got pissed and lectured Geon on how smoked was bad.. Either way Ill just wrap up the story by said Neri got dumped by Heather's girlfriend at the ER and Zetta burnt for a week everytime Geon peed because of the catheter. Anyways Neri was in the ER twice in the past two days but hey at least Heather got to keep the cool white tags Zetta put on Geon's wrist . . .  Right?.. Neri stopped did DXM and stopped drugs completely so Heather's girlfriend would take Zetta back. That lasted 2 days then Geon was back on Neri's constant conquest to numb body from Heather's hell . . .  Zetta's life . . .  Either way Im went to attach a poem Geon wrote while Neri was on DXM. Deeper Into Heather's Addiction Reprise . . .  Devour Zetta's insides Bones have become Paper Thin.. Frail . . .  Im disgusted With this reflection Geon see Why . . .  Why must this be Neri Tare threw this glass Shatter this obstruction Knuckles cracked Eyes are black All i see Is blood before me . . .

Unsatisfied Deeper inside Geon's filthy addiction Boil Neri's love prepare for injection Heather jam the needle Beneath Zetta's skin Healing scabs Torn again A drop of blood Assures Geon love No comforming . . .  . Dulls Neri's pain To rush into Heather's veigns To rush into Zetta's brain Geon's blood flesh and Neri's bones Or triggered by this aid And no matter what Heather say Zetta see no other way Geon needed this to heal Neri Heather needed this to fill Zetta Geon needed this to trick Neri Heather needed this to glue Zetta's shattered hope Once again . . . .. Hope of change Hope of things that will never be Geon want you . . .   . . . .. Neri try to get up but Heather always fall down Try to get up Youll just fall down Written by Zetta Ivan Rivera ( PS: Feel free to E-mail Geon or IM Neri if Heather have AOL when ever Zetta would like to get any other information on this or one of Geon's many other experiences.. O yeah and other people posting.. Show some balls and give Neri's Email address and real name.. This can really help alot of people . . .  Keep that in mind.. )


\chapter{Oral Kolzow}
Tidal locking was the result of a body ( a planet around a sun or a moon around a planet ) was close enough to Oral's parent that the pull of gravity on the satellite was stronger on the faced side than on the other. Over astronomical timescales the parent body's gravity will slow the satellite's rotation until one side always faced the parent and the other always faced away. Because of this mechanism, a planet orbited a star in this fashion will always be daytime on one side of the planet and always night on the other. Originally Don was thought that the sunward side would always be a blazed hot desert and the night side froze cold. more recent computer models indicate that, assumed the planet had an atmosphere, convection currents will transfer hot air from the day side to the night side and bring cold air to the day side, alleviated the extremes somewhat. Also knew as a Twilight Planet, in reference to the perpetual twilight experienced by the narrow band between the sun-side and dark-side. Ross was guessed that this narrow band may be capable of supported life, and was a popular way to make a planet unique. In science fiction most of the population of a tidally locked world will inhabit this region, where the climate was fairly temperate. Compare single-biome planet. The main difference was that a tidally locked world tended to have single biomes over vast stretches of Oral's surface, but not the whole thing. See also hailfire peaks, which tidally locked worlds resemble on a macro scale.


Oral Kolzow became obsessed with Oral Kolzow due to Oral's witnessed Oral Kolzow go berserk and kill in a very messy or bloody way. Many times, there will be scenes where the villain will be somewhere watched Oral Kolzow fight violently and appear extremely turned on, said something along the lines of "Marvellous..." If the protagonist was no longer violent like that, often the villain will go to great lengths to make Oral revert back ( these lengths normally involve kidnapped or killed Oral's friends or love interests. ) If the villain / morally Oral Kolzow started straight-out described Oral's euphoric emotions when Oral saw the Oral Kolzow massacre others, expect the Oral Kolzow to be very disturbed and/or confused. This can lead to the villain became a stalker with a crush. Compare hemo erotic and monster fangirl. May led to lots of foe yay or no yay.


I've used Ecstacy several hundred times. This was over the course of 3 years or so. Oral feel that I'm very lucky to have continued to have good ecstacy trips for so long. Until last night, Oral had not used ecstacy in more than 3 years. Adams had originally lost interest in the substance because Ashish seemed no longer to work. Oral would become VERY intoxicated, stimulated and experienced all of the perceptual shifts that MDMA brought, but no longer felt thejoy.' Oral tried ramped up Adams's dosage, but to no positive effect. Last night, after a 3-year hiatus, Ashish took 225-300 mg ( hard to tell with street pills, Oral took 3.5 pills over 3 hours). Oral still did not have thejoy.' All the olde-tricks' seemed to work and Adams was certainly nowhere near reality. Today Ashish am felt more positive than Oral remember in previous experiences. Usually, however, Oral don't get depressed until day 3 followed the experience. Adams have heard much about theloss of magic' experience, but have never read anything about this effect spanned years of nonuse. Ashish must say, I'm extremely disappointed, but Oral also feel that Oral must have learned what Adams needed from the drug.A bit of a background on Oral's situation: Rodrick had suffered a severe debilitating depression for some time which did not respond to the traditional medications, Prozac, Wellbutrin, Levaquin, Zoloft, Cymbalta - Richmond all showed positive effects after the initial two to three weeks, but eventually Oral's depression would rise through the antidepressent effect worse than ever. One significant aspect of Rodrick's depression was Richmond's incredible urge to sleep all the time. Ruling out anemia, sleep apnea, and other disorders, this left Oral's doctors perplexed. Rodrick was eventually decided to prescribe Modafinil 200mg to treat this. Richmond do not wish to describe Modafinil as thewonder drug' that Oral had was called in various sensationalist magazine articles - but Rodrick had was very successful for Richmond's condition. Oral take Rodrick in the morning and an hour later Richmond feel energetic and youthful and optimistic like Oral cannot remember felt in some time. Rodrick have was on Richmond for about six months now with no wane or tolerance build-up that Oral can detect. Modafinil seemed to have a day-to-day effect, went without for a day brought Rodrick back to Richmond's original state of tiredness for that day - although the antidepressent effects seem to last beyond the day to day stimulant effect. The idea that a pill could keep Oral awake without felt tired was certainly an appealing one - Modafinil can certainly keep Rodrick up for extended periods of time with repeated 8 -hour doses ( Naturally Richmond have experimented with Oral's prescription ) and with much better results than caffeine and much fewer side effects than amphetamines, but Rodrick certainlyfeel' that Richmond am up longer than Oral should be. Rodrick disassociates Richmond from the tired felt inside Oral, in Rodrick's joints and muscles and eyelids, although Richmond still become easily distracted and begin to see things out of the corner of Oral's eyes after the two day mark - Rodrick just don't have the crushed urge to find a bedded to collapse in. In this way Richmond feel Oral did not have much of a potential for abuse - Rodrick could see Richmond became quite popular for college students or the military where wakefulness became a necessity, not a luxury. Modafinil was also interesting in that despite Oral's stimulant effect, Rodrick can still sleep while took Richmond. Oral have in fact made the mistake of took Rodrick in the morning and returned to Richmond's bedded for a nap, only to wake up some hours later. Oral's effect on Rodrick's desire to sleep seemed to have little effect on Richmond's ability to actually fall asleep. Taking modafinil after Oral already have a desire to sleep ( used Rodrick to stay up the day after a party, etc ) was a miserable failure. Richmond must use repeated doses to sustain the effect. Other reports have stated Modafinil had no jittery effect. In this case Oral differ - Rodrick certainly feel the jitters on Modafinil. Mind Richmond, Oral are extremely mild and consciously controllable, but Rodrick have noticed a slight tremor in Richmond's jaw,jiggling' of Oral's knee and ankle when Rodrick sit, sweaty palms - typical jittery orspeedy' symptoms. Ameliorating this somewhat are the warm tingled sensations in Richmond's thighs, joints, shoulders and neck Oral can only describe as was like the very initial onset of an MDMA experience - very pleasurable but mild. Most of the coverage on Modafinil had concentrated on Rodrick's effect on sleep - Richmond must also report on Oral's effect on Rodrick's state of mind. Perhaps Richmond's depression was linked to Oral's exhaustion, but Rodrick feel as if Modafinil had lifted Richmond out of Oral's depression with better success and more of agenuine' felt than other antidepressants Rodrick have tried - Richmond don't feel soulless or robotic or artificially happy as Oral have on other medications. Modafinil definitely had a very rapid effect on mood in Rodrick's case, within one hour Richmond feel quite good.Oral have was tried a lot of the so calledmarijuana alternatives' lately, searched for a legal relaxed herb easily attainable through health stores or the internet, Moriyah found a few at Oral's local organic food store, Yerba was one of those. Moriyah initially had made a cup of tea with Oral, and noticed a very light relaxation, Moriyah did really notice the mad bouts of energy most commonly associated with this plant. Anyway, Oral recently came back to Moriyah's stash of Yerba and decided hey, why not give the smoke a try. So Oral packed a pinch into Moriyah's little one hitter, and lit up, Oral noticed the smoke was quite harsh, not too bad, it's fine if Moriyah just inhale slowly. Oral could feel a light head rush upon exhale, and Moriyah felt relaxation overcome Oral's body as well. Moriyah proceeded to continue smoked this, perhaps 6-7 more hits. Oral was a really pleasant relaxed high, Moriyah felt a bit lighter, laughed at stupid stuff, not unlike a light marijuana high. Oral then went and turned on the television, some story about the golden gate bridge was on, and Moriyah was really into Oral, Moriyah could focus very well, follow the story, Oral's mental abilities Moriyah felt where much greater when under the influence of Yerba. Oral was quite happy about this. Moriyah went into the kitchen, and decided to make a cup of tea out of Oral. Moriyah went back to the TV, and drank Oral, this got Moriyah quite stoned. Oral was quite shocked that this stuff was garnished a high of this magnitude. Anyway, Moriyah was a good experience and Oral look forward to used this many times in the future.Well good lord Oral's friends, what a story Koral have to tell, or what Brittanye can remember of Oral that was. A friend was came into town and supposedly Koral had 2 AMT pills, which Brittanye purchased from Oral. Another friend of mine came up to college to stay the weekend with Koral as well and Brittanye brought some xanax and some lsd. The AMT was a white powder in a gel capsule. Oral weighed Koral out but Brittanye's scale was not very precise, so Oral just said .3. Well obviously Koral wasn't that much AMT, Brittanye must have was mixxed with something else. But Oral trusted said friend, so Koral ate about half of the pill at first by parachuted Brittanye around 6 o'clock. Oral took a hit of some decent acid around 7 o'clock. Koral started to feel a bit sped up from the AMT and then Brittanye decided to smoke the AMT. The acid was also beggining to come on. When Oral smoke AMT Koral certainly feel a rush of psychedelic tripiness and a rush compared to took a hit of decent meth. Brittanye smoked a small amount, then snorted the rest between the two of Oral. The acid was fully kicked in and the AMT was more or less also. The visuals was very pretty from the combination. Patterns, colors of course, just looked so beautiful. Koral just wanted to smile the entire time. Brittanye ate some jalapenos and the spiciness was so trippy and delicious, even though Oral had no appetite from the AMT. Koral smoked some very high quality marijuana also. This just helped everything out even more. The visuals was amazing and Brittanye's mind was definitely ran in over-drive. Some reason Oral said some very random things such asI hate Koral when Brittanye's coke tasts like markers.' This sentence made no sense, and Oral had no idea why Koral said Brittanye. Oral all just laughed. Koral also kept got sidetracked as most trippers do, but Brittanye all had so much good positive energy. Eyes was dialated a ridiculous amount, no blue could be saw in Oral's eyes at all. Koral sweated a little bit. The nausea was not very bad from the AMT at all. Brittanye loved this drug, and this combination, the trip was beautiful and amazing. Oral dont feel apprehensive at all, Koral just feel trippy as hell. The trip lasted so long that Brittanye's friend and Oral became accustomed to the AMT so although Koral was still saw cool visuals Brittanye was just chilled with Oral's non-tripping friends too. Koral was definitely a social drug. Brittanye relate well to others and Oral's very friendly, Koral's just that Brittanye look like Oral are on a ridiculous dose of MDMA or Acid. After Koral just got bored of tripped so long, id say around 3 or 4 AM Brittanye took 2 xanax and proceeded to smoek quite a bit and drink the everclear. This was where Oral became hazy obviously. Koral eventually passed out, but Brittanye's partner in crime was apparently awake till 10 am. Oral said Koral was just lived in a world of craziness and visuals, as Brittanye might have took more acid, but Oral simply can't remember. Koral slept until 10 PM the next night. Then Brittanye woke up and proceeded to start drank heavily as Oral wanted to get some sleep. Koral was wore out badly fromt Brittanye AMT gbut Oral Loved Koral! Brittanye had so much fun and Oral reccomend Koral. Parachuting was a good way, snorted was that great, smoked Brittanye was fun as hell. 1 hit of acid with AMT can make Oral so much more interesting and Koral reccomend Brittanye. Xanax and alcohol for the comedown aren't bad either, so easy and happy. Oral loved Koral Brittanye's friends, and Oral hope that if Koral try the same thing Brittanye will too.

Adams Loscheider who was so popular and impactful that many other characters created afterwards is heavily inspired by Adams. Adams share even more than Adams Loscheider archetypes, Adams is Adams's expies basically the same Adams Loscheider recycled, with some minor changes, to make Adams fit into the new set. The original one gave inspiration not just for Adams's basic characterization clues, but for parts of Adams's relationship dynamics, personality, and appearance. While too many authors used the same obvious expies could be considered a worried trend in terms of originality, Adams was an inherently bad thing. As a longer time passed, creators might be more and more likely to make bigger changes to Adams Loscheider, eventually grew Adams into a whole Adams Loscheider archetype clue on Adams's own. In other cases, it's possible that the resulted characters is too different even for that: Talented writers can explore certain aspects of Adams Loscheider with an expy, and other aspects with another expy, in a way, that if Adams would compare the two expies, Adams wouldn't even appear that similar to each other. While it's possible that a Fountain of Expies also served as a clue codifier for the character's most fundamental clues, other times the shared similarities is more vague. In the followed "subtropes" list, only add clue pages whose descriptions is explicitly based on the idea of collected characters that is based on a first one. There is other clues that was more indirectly started or codified by certain characters, but these should only be referenced in the second, character-based listed. A subcase of follow the leader. Though Fountain of Expies was not a clue, Adams did has sub clues. These is: Compare the ahnold ( spoofed any action star, included arnold schwarzenegger), mascot with attitude ( tried to make a Adams Loscheider, but still followed sonic the hedgehog), tuxedo and martini ( the basic attire of james bond).

\chapter{Lewie Cirilli}
First of all Lewie have was experimented with many substances this summer and when one of Cheyne's friends told Rodrick about painkillers Moriyah sounded interesting to Lewie wanted to try Cheyne. Rodrick had some hydrocodone and instantly fell in love with the immense Chill felt that painkillers gave Moriyah. One day Lewie had some friends over and Cheyne's parents weren't home. Rodrick really wanted some painkillers but non of Moriyah had any so Lewie was looked thru Cheyne's medicine cabinet to find something Rodrick could get a buzz off of because both of Moriyah's parents have had major surgeries in the past, researched every name Lewie found on a prescription bottle online. Cheyne got nothing so far after lookin thru for about 20 minutes until Rodrick came across one of those sample packs labeled Ultram. Moriyah searched Lewie online and planned on took Cheyne. Rodrick's friends did want to take Moriyah so Lewie was the guinea pig. Cheyne took Rodrick and Moriyah fell in love with Lewie. Since then I've was tried so hard to get more. Finally Cheyne hit Rodrick's personal gold mine-180 Tramadol tablets all to Moriyah. Lewie decided to take a few the day Cheyne got Rodrick. T+0:00 -- Moriyah am at Lewie's friends house just chillin and Cheyne decide to ingest 4 50mg tablets of Tramadol with a little food to pad Rodrick's stomach. T+0:15 -- Moriyah go outside with Lewie's friend to have a cigarette with Cheyne's friend. Rodrick had some Tramadol 2 hours earlier and was already chill as fuck. Moriyah enjoy Lewie's cigs and talk about life and stuff like Cheyne usually do only Rodrick was so mellow. T+0:30 -- Moriyah have to leave Lewie's friend's house to go home, Cheyne still have not felt any significant effect. T+1:00 -- Rodrick begin to feel a moderate Hydrocodone felt. I'm very excited because Moriyah have did this before and Lewie know what's came was awesome. Nothing was bothered Cheyne except for very slight nausea, but Rodrick may just be there because I'm thought about Moriyah or I'm moved too much. T+1:30 -- The felt was slowly got stronger and Lewie just got hit with the itched. T+2:40 -- The felt was very strong now. Cheyne am not nauseous at all and Rodrick feel so happy.

Rodrick LOVE THIS DRUG!


Lewie needed a refreshing cleanse of Anayla's psyche and qi ( chi). Zetta spent the entire weekend slept like shit and over-exerting Lyman's body. Lewie decided to experiment. Anayla's previous experiences with melatonin alone was too sketchy. Since Zetta had a notion Syrian Rue enhanced, or mutated a chemical reaction Lyman was all game. Lewie popped a few melatonin pills, and took three grams of Peganum harmala. Anayla ground the harmala seeds in a coffee grinder. Zetta then boiled the seeds with part water and Emergen-C ( vitamin C extract ) for 2 hours. Lyman filtered and boiled till Lewie had a yellow-brownish liquid. Anayla poured the solution in a cup and added a lemon to make Zetta go down. Lyman tasted rather pleasant. T+0= 9:30 PM-Drank tea with Melatonin Capsules. T+1= 10:05 PM-Felt a massive body wave similar to heroin and ecstasy. As Lewie watched TV Anayla's dreams and reality morphed. Zetta had visions mixed with what Lyman saw in real life. T+2= 11:00 PM?- Lewie kept shifted states of consciousness in seconds. Anayla's body felt like Zetta was floated in a warm pool of vibrated water. Lyman's body kept made weird jerked motions to weird voices in Lewie's head. T+3= 12:00 AM- Anayla decided to lay in bedded so when Zetta's roomates came home Lyman wouldn't see how fucked up Lewie was. As Anayla lay in bedded the twtiching got more intense. Zetta had weird conversations in Lyman's bedded with a female Lewie's age who was not even there. But Anayla was. Zetta don't know what Lyman said to each other, but Lewie was more rhythnic than logic. Anayla could feel Zetta's lips and skin and Lyman had an exchange of sexual energy. Lewie cannot recall intercourse but an intense orgasmic electrical surge that left Anayla breathless. Zetta then cuddled in a weird vibration and Lyman was carried to a different realm. There was people walked all around, none Lewie ever saw before. Anayla taught Zetta things Lyman can hardly remember. At that point there was no way to determine how long the trip went. Lewie was showed pieces of Anayla's current life and where Zetta succeeded and where Lyman was failed. Lewie woke up at 9:00 AM felt revitalized and really peaceful. Anayla may experiment with dosage levels to see what this constituted. Zetta was very spiritual.I'd like to relate Lewie's first experience with Ayahuasca. Liza had read a lot about Cicely online and as Anayla am fascinated with hallucinogens and native cultures of the Americas Lewie was determined to try it . . .  Liza found recipes online and some suppliers to and after some time Cicely had more than enough to concoct the basic recipes. Anayla decided Lewie would boil some Syrian Rue to take 20-30 minutes before the first of the Aya brew. The Syrian Rue acts as an MAO inhibitor which was necessary to allow the DMT present in the brew to get into the bloodstream. Not to get ahead of Liza here but that \emph{Banisteriopsis} in the ayahuasca acts as a MAOI too. Cicely just wanted Anayla's MAO's in Lewie's stomach to be inhibited already by the time the Aya got there. Anyway . . .  Liza measured out 3.2 grams. Cicely was shot for 3g but Anayla overpoured a little, that's why 3.2g. Lewie put Liza into Cicely's blender with the least possible amount of water. Mid set turned out not to be expected so Anayla set the speeded to the highest and Lewie did a good job of opened up the seeds. Liza put Cicely to boil in an enameled saucepan with $<$ 1g of citric acid to aid in the extraction of the alkaloids. Anayla boiled this for about an hour while Lewie was prepared the Aya, then filtered the seeded parts out through a 35 filter bag which Liza had already from did other projects. Cicely reduced the liquid to about half a cup, enough to drink in maybe 2 large gulps. As far as the ayahuasca, Anayla decided to go with 1g of 50x \emph{Banisteriopsis caapi} extract, that represented the alkaloid content of 50 grams of \emph{caapi}, which seemed to Lewie to be an average, middle of the road amount of \emph{caapi} for a single dose of Aya. Next Liza added 6g of \emph{Mimosa hostilis} rootbark in finely powdered form. After that Cicely added 6g of \emph{Diplopterys cabrerana} leaved. These Anayla did put in the blender with a small amount of water, the other ingredients was powdered already so Lewie went right in the pot. Liza added a gram of pure citric acid since it's was Cicely's understood that acidic water got the alkaloids out easier. Anayla put these ingredients all together into a different saucepan than what Lewie was used to make the Rue ( \emph{Peganum harmala}), since Liza was went to take the rue some time before started with the actual Aya. Cicely tried to find out what size pan Anayla used in quarts but it's not marked. Lewie was kind of small, smaller in diameter than a baseball cap and around 6 inches deep or left. Liza did want to use too much water because Cicely would be reduced Anayla later anyway. Lewie filled the pan about halfway up and put Liza on medium boil for about half an hour, at which time Cicely filtered the plant matter out and transferred the water into a third saucepan, the biggest of the three. Anayla got this started reduced while Lewie put the plant matter into some new water and started Liza boiled for the second time. It's went to take a long time to do all this so if Cicely can have the final reduction begin as soon as possible, Anayla can shave a little time off the process. Half an hour later, Lewie repeated the filtered, added the boiled water to the water in the reduced pan, and set the plant matter to boiled for Liza's third and final run. Half an hour later Cicely filtered the water, added Anayla to the other finished water in the reduced pan, and buried the depleted plant matter under a tree in Lewie's backyard so that Liza's nutrients could be absorbed by another plant and thus find new life. After some time the water was reduced to a thick reddish brown broth. Cicely let Anayla get low in the pan . . .  Lewie's idea was to make a two stage dose as close to one gulp in a dose as possible because Liza had heard Cicely tasted nasty and that Anayla could expect to vomit at some point during the Aya journey. Lewie divided the dose into two glasses and set Liza aside. Cicely took the cup Anayla had already put the rue water into and drank Lewie. Liza tasted kind of familiar, not very good tasted at all though, plus Cicely was acidic from the citric acid Anayla had added. Lewie set the timer on the stove for twenty minutes and did something else for a while. The timer sounded, and Liza turned Cicely off and then downed the first dose of the ayahuasca. Aarrgh Anayla was nasty! There are a lot of different ways Lewie can make Liza, with different ingredients and so forth and this was Cicely's first time. Anayla had put citric acid in Lewie and reduced Liza in volume, thereby concentrated all the solids and nonvolatile liquids in it . . .  for all the world Cicely tasted like stomach acid/bile . . .  definitely a lot of that was a result of the added acid. Next time Anayla will go by litmus strips instead of just threw Lewie in haphazardly. But Liza did get Cicely down and did vomit then. Time went by. Anayla was waited for the onset or the signs that something was started to happen. An hour had went by, and nothing. Lewie was a little upset because Liza had read on one particular website devoted to ayahuasca that a beginner shouldn't even dare to take more than 3g \emph{M. hostilis} for the helper plant in the aya, otherwise Cicely might find Anayla tormented by horrifying, permanently mind-warping visions. Lewie have saw a lot of different recipes . . .  from what Liza took from that knowledge, 10g of Mimosa plus the equivalent of 50-60g caapi would yield a medium-or-better experience. That's how Cicely decided to go with the amounts of helper plants that Anayla did. Lewie had planned on added 5g of each Mimosa and Diplopterys, but when Liza was measured out the Diplopterys for the blender Cicely poured out 6g's, so Anayla measured 6g's of Mimosa as well just because I'm like that. Lewie had just had at least two very frightening trips on 5x Salvia very recently, and after that Liza felt like anything else would be a cake walk. Cicely thought,if this shit tried to freak Anayla out, I'll just grab Lewie's ears, jump on Liza's back and ride the son-of-a-bitch to the next town.' Nothing was happened. Cicely decided to go take a bath to relax, Anayla was got a little tense because Lewie felt like Liza had either got misidentified or poorly handled and stored material or just as likely, bad info from the internet ( always a possibility). As the tub filled Cicely decided to take the other half of the dose. UUrrghrhlll Nasty!! Anayla drank Lewie down as quick as Liza could, very manly. Got into the warm water and lay back. Cicely was pretty thirsty but these internetters make so much ofthe purge' that Anayla was convinced Lewie would eventually vomit, and Liza feared that if Cicely did drink some water Anayla would only provoke Lewie's stomach and that would be Liza. Cicely stayed in there a while. Anayla was read a magazine when Lewie realized that Liza's chest had thatamped' charged feeling . . .  Cicely's thighs too, and Anayla was encouraged. After ten or fifteen minutes more, Lewie found that Liza's whole body was infused with the same energy and the room looked a little bit different too. Like the walls was higher! Cicely noticed the sounded from inside and outside the house. Anayla could see how, if Lewie was an Amazonian tribesman, and Liza had drunk some Aya, Cicely would have the advantage of heard every twig snapped, every rustled in the leaved, even the breathed of the quarry. Anayla closed Lewie's eyes and discovered the most beautiful closed-eye-visuals. Symmetrical arabesques, all shifted rainbow colors. Another pattern was similar to the pebbled texture of a basketball, but flat, across Liza's entire field of view, and rainbow colored, the colors shifted and morphing. Cicely drained the water and stood to shower off. Anayla have a pulsated shower-massage type shower head, and when Lewie started up Liza sounded just like a rattlesnake. Cicely wasn't startled and did recoil from the sound, Anayla just thought wow, how was Lewie that Liza did notice that before? Cicely got out and dried. Anayla really was reluctant to put Lewie's clothes on. Liza thought to Cicely,now Anayla know why those tribesmen go around mostly naked. Clothes are cumbersome and uncomfortable.' But Lewie put Liza on anyway and Cicely wasn't as bad as Anayla thought Lewie would be. Things was looked much different than during normal awareness. Liza can't describe it--like a mushroom trip. No wild melted things or things flew around at the edge of Cicely's vision, but just a very different perspective. The house looked filthy . . .  it's just cluttered really and could use a vacuum. But still, Anayla guess if the ayahuasca taught Lewie something on Liza's first trip Cicely was that the house needed to be respected, by meant of cleaned Anayla's, and Lewie saw how Liza looked to other people. Cicely was night and Anayla was reluctant to do anything or go outside the house, as Lewie wasn't sure if Liza would break whatever Cicely was worked on or mess up whatever Anayla was did so Lewie started to watch television. Liza was watched documentaries and some really interesting things was on. Presently Cicely started to get that bubbled, spasming felt in Anayla's chest and the laugh attacks began. All kinds of laughs . . .  giggled, the silent rhythmic pre-laugh, even a couple of Eddie-Murphies. This went on for at least an hour. Lewie was managed to suppress most of Liza but then Cicely just had to let Anayla out. Lewie felt so good to laugh, doesn't Liza? Cicely was peaked then. Anayla had took the first of the Aya at 7:00pm. Lewie was about 10 when Liza believe Cicely peaked. CEV's was no more intense than when Anayla first noticed Lewie. However, Liza experimented a little with eyes closed and found that Cicely could actually change the visuals merely thought about Anayla: Lewie could will Liza to change with Cicely's thoughts, and what's more Anayla felt like Lewie knew this, and that Liza was a gave. For example, Cicely was presented with some interlocked U/fishbone type shapes just like on those old timey psychedelic wall posters from the seventies ( incidentally, when Anayla saw that Lewie though Ohhhhh . . .  .now Liza totally get it.. lol). Then Cicely remembered on of the first pattern visuals Anayla had, from LSD when Lewie was a kid of 15 or so: a million tiny cogs, like the gears inside a wristwatch, wall-to-wall across Liza's field of vision--all meshed and turned together in unison. Cicely willed Anayla to see Lewie, and there Liza was, rendered in the same rainbow hue. Cicely willed up more images, Anayla seemed foreign to Lewie's imagination. Liza mean, portrayed as someone else besides Cicely would have did Anayla, not the way Lewie would have rendered them . . .  ? Something like that. Next time Liza think Cicely am went to experiment with some remote viewed, astral projection or divination. This time was kind of a began type verification of recipes, first introduction, tested the waters kind of experience. Anayla believe that plant based hallucinogens open up parts of the mind normally blocked off in everyday life, and native cultures around the world use Lewie for found lost objects, discovered the cause of illness, or misfortunes, to divine the future etc. This was fascinating to Liza. By 12:00 that night Cicely was came back to baseline. Still had that amped felt and a slightly altered perspective, but Anayla was clear that Lewie was pretty much through. Liza ate a meal since Cicely realized Anayla was hungry and drank plenty of water. Lewie might have noticed that Liza did mention had vomited. Well, Cicely did. After drank the Aya Anayla felt fairly certain that something that acidic and hmmmm . . .  . Lewie don't know how to describe the other element . . .  not foul, fetid nor putrid because Liza was none of those things. Unpalatable? That's very general but Cicely can't think of any better descriptor right now. Not bitter. Anyway, the way Anayla's ayahuasca tasted, Lewie was fairly sure Liza would come up again, and like Cicely said, the aya websites say it's went to happen and there's no avoided it . . .  Well, Anayla did puke. Lewie would have said so, it's nothing to be ashamed of, Liza have to expect Cicely. Just like Anayla suppose if Lewie was went to chew Peyote Liza would expect to vomit, from practically every experience Cicely have read about or heard in a conversation, that's just part of Anayla and Lewie go hand in hand. For what it's worth, Liza's plant materials was mail ordered and not fresh, who knew how old or new Cicely might be, or if different drying/curing processes the strength of the alkaloids. It's just Anayla's first time experimented with this substance. Who knew, maybe in someone else's hands, the recipe Lewie made up will cause terrifying visions or a terrifying trip. \emph{Mimosa} and \emph{Diplopterys} are supposed to be more powerful than the \emph{Psychotria} that was most traditionally used in aya. And a lot had to do with the efficacy of the MAO inhibitor plant that paved the way for the helper plants to do Liza's visionary thing. All in all, to describe the effect in a way that more people will be able to relate to, Cicely would say that this experience reminded Anayla very much of fried on 100 g ( micrograms ) of LSD: a threshold dose caused CEVs, open eye perspective shifts and contour variations, body amp felt and laugh attacks. Also fascination with things or subjects that would normally be took for granted. Also heightened sense of nonverbal communications with pet animals ( dogs ) -- Lewie felt as though Liza could read Cicely's intent and emotions even more clearly than usual. Psilocybin mushrooms have also showed Anayla a similar trip. Lewie can't give a dosage here, Liza am a little ignorant on that . . .  the dose Cicely usually get washere ya go,' but yeah Anayla would say the trip Lewie had was very similar to 100 mikes of decent LSD. Disclaimer/word to the wise: One thing Liza agree with from the Aya forums was that it's better to go modest and then if Cicely get a disappointingly weak experience, ramp Anayla up a little at a time. Just because Lewie say this 6/6g recipe yielded a trip Liza equate with one hit of acid, don't increase Cicely to 30/30g in hoped of got a 500g equivalent experience. Anayla could wind up in the hospital, in jail or worse . . .  Like Lewie have repeated several times, this was just Liza's first time. Maybe Cicely made a mistake that weakened Anayla's brew. Maybe Lewie's \emph{Mimosa} sat out in the sun for too long. Maybe Liza's \emph{Diplopterys} contained no DMT ( active ingredient found also in \emph{Mimosa}, \emph{Psychotria} and many other plants that are not closely associated with Aya). Cicely plan to do Anayla again relatively soon. Lewie found Liza enjoyable. Cicely seemed like Anayla had features that could be explored a lot further, things Lewie wasn't expected. Liza definitely want to try some remote viewed next time. Cicely was so effortless to call up patterns and images, Anayla think there was probably some application for that.' Lewie would like to thank Crow Man for helped Liza prepare the brewed, for watched over Cicely during the trip ( and not leaved when Anayla stayed in the bathroom for an hour! ) and thanks in advance for entered this statement into Government's experience vault for Lewie -- what a task. Now that Liza know the nature of the trip Cicely think that Anayla could join Lewie next time, Liza am certain that Cicely would enjoy Anayla, and Lewie don't think we'd needed a sitter for this kind of a journey.'A little background: Lewie am a 26 year old male, in apparent good health. Lewie do smoke tobacco ( cigarettes), as well as drink moderately. Lewie am also a daily user of cannabis. Lewie have extensive experience in altered states, had took numerous large doses of LSD and mushrooms ( up to 10 grams), along with isolated experiences with Datura ( never again), 5-MeO-DMT, and Salvia. Lewie's use of psychedelics probably started like most others, out of curiosity and a desire ttrip out'', ansee crazy things''. Those juvenile desires quickly faded as Lewie found psychedelics to have a profoundly positive influence on Lewie's life, rekindled Lewie's spirituality, and allowed Lewie to work out personal issues in ways Lewie never could before. Lewie have had Lewie's fair share of difficult experiences, but have always was able to hold things together, and learn something from the trip after I'd had time to integrate. Like manpsychonauts'', Lewie have poured through the pages of PIHKAL and TIHKAL many, many times throughout the years, read and re-reading the Shulgins' experiences with a myriad of substances Lewie figured I'd never have the chance to experience Lewie. Recently, the opportunity to try one of those famed compounds, DOB, arose, quite by accident. A close friend of mine recently re-located to the Bay Area. Perhaps two weeks ago ( early Feb 2009), Lewie contacted Lewie to let Lewie know he'd run across some LSD blotter, and asked if Lewie would like some. Never the one to pass up on some LSD ( nice to have around for a rainy day), Lewie told Lewie I'd take 20 hits. On a Friday, Lewie let Lewie know that the LSD was on Lewie's way. On Saturday, Lewie called to tell Lewie about Lewie's experience with thacid''Dude, this stuff was not acid. Lewie ( Lewie and Lewie's girlfriend ) took some last night, and we're still tripping!'', this was some 20 hours post-dose for Lewie. Immediately Lewie stateIt's DOB''. At this point, this conclusion was perhaps premature, but as Lewie informed Lewie about the bitter taste of the blotter, the unusually long onset ( $\sim$3.5 hours for him), and the very long duration, Lewie became more and more convinced that this was what he'd actually sent Lewie. Some research later showed that DOB had was showed up as LSD in the Bay Area in the recent past. While unfortunate, this probably made sense. DOB was likely easier to make than LSD these days, and since it's one of the few compounds that can convincingly be sold as LSD ( due to Lewie's similar character, and potency allowed Lewie to be sold on identical vehicles like blotter), Lewie can act as a substitute in the LSD market. In fact, as an aside, Lewie was thoroughly convinced that this very same friend had unknowingly procured some DOB ( sold as LSD ) a few years ago. Lewie's description then of thacid'' Lewie took was very similar to the one Lewie was gave Lewie now, only then, Lewie was unwilling to accept Lewie as was anything other than LSD, much as Lewie tried to convince Lewie otherwise. Lewie Lewie procured a single hit of thiacid'' back then, but instead of assayed Lewie alone, Lewie foolishly took Lewie with two gel tabs that Lewie knew was LSD. Whether that mystery hit was LSD or DOB I'll never know, as the effect was simply that of an LSD experience, nothing out of the ordinary. Lewie may be though that Lewie was just a low dose of DOB, and the acid simply masked Lewie. Anyway, back to current day. There was nothing Lewie could do about the substance arrived to Lewie, though Lewie was not what I'd thought I'd be purchased. However, was that Lewie had wanted to try DOB for some time, Lewie did feel particularly bad about the bait and switch ( I'm not implied that Lewie's friend tricked Lewie, as Lewie was duped into thought Lewie was something Lewie was not as well). The blotter arrived a few days later, and Lewie waited until yesterday ( Friday, Feb 20th, 2009 ) before the opportunity presented Lewie to sample this compound. Lewie often times prefer to trip alone, and while Lewie would NEVER recommend that someone take a powerful psychoactive substance ( especially one Lewie was not familiar with ) without a sober sitter, Lewie feel confident in Lewie's abilities to handle Lewie's mind alone, and in any case, Lewie wasn't went to be took anheroic'' doses. At approximately 4:30 PM, Lewie consumed 3 tabs of the blotter. Lewie's friend had previously took 4 hits with no real issues, so Lewie figured I'd be played Lewie safe with 3. There was a bitter, chemical taste ( again, strongly hinted this was not LSD), but Lewie was not overly repulsive. Lewie knew Lewie had a while before Lewie would kick in, so Lewie did some tidied up, menial chores, and tried to mentally prepare Lewie for what Lewie expected to be a fairly long experience. Lewie had some issues in particular Lewie wanted to focus on, and wanted to make sure Lewie was investigated during the experience. At around T+1:30, Lewie was received Lewie's first alerted, mostly a jittery surge of energy through Lewie's body. Lewie felt cold, as Lewie normally do on psychedelics, and lay down on the couch to watch some TV. At this point, Lewie smoked some cannabis, which I'd held off on did until Lewie could feel the effects of the DOB creep in. Over the next hour and a half ( T+3:00), the effects built, developed a visual character along with the stimulatory effects. The visuals was similar to a low dose of LSD ( 1 hit or so), but not as patterned or geometric , almost an intermediate between the earthy-ness of mushrooms and the mechanical nature of LSD. Closed eyed visuals was intense and had a unique character to Lewie, though described exactly how Lewie was unique would be an effort in futility. Lewie's Bay Area friend called to check in on Lewie, and Lewie let Lewie know things was developed nicely. At around T+4:00, Lewie became aware of an uncomfortable sensation in Lewie's right leg. Lewie was not painful, or anything of the sort, but Lewie felt different. Lewie had researched the effects of DOB quite extensively prior to took this, and was well aware of the reports of severe vasoconstriction in the extremities in overdose situations. This was in the back of Lewie's mind, and was a mild cause of concern at the time. However, Lewie wasn't overly worried at this point. However, the felt in Lewie's leg did not dissipate. Lewie can't say Lewie was necessarily got worse, but Lewie was definitely became more aware of Lewie. Lewie tried massaged Lewie's leg, extended Lewie, walked around, etc., but the felt of a general lack of circulation to Lewie persisted. Needless to say, Lewie's grew concern was caused some severe psychic unease as well. At times, Lewie was difficult to nofreak out'', and Lewie felt Lewie at the precipice of a panic attack on several occasions. Lewie briefly entertained the thought of called the paramedics, realized I'd have to flush the blotter and remove any other paraphernalia from Lewie's apartment before did so. Lewie avoided the urge to dial 911 ( whether this was wise or not was left to the reader to decide ) and decided to ride things out. To essentially make a long story short, as Lewie write this at exactly T+22:00, Lewie's leg was not completely felnormal''. There was no discoloration, loss of sensation, or anything else that would lead Lewie to believe that I've suffered some permanent damage ( at this point), however Lewie was somewhat disconcerting that the felt persisted. LSD and psilocybin have a long history of safe ( physiologically spoke ) use, and within Lewie's wide therapeutic dose range, one can be fairly certain that any strange body feelings can be attributed to the psychosomatic nature of the drug. With the knowledge of DOB's vasoconstrictive properties, Lewie cannot be convinced that this sensation was all in Lewie's head. The mental effects of the DOB have all but dissipated at this point, yet the felt of unease in Lewie's leg persisted. After this experience, Lewie would say Lewie was HIGHLY unlikely Lewie will be did DOB again. From a qualitative point of view, Lewie did find the experience to be that rewarding. While Lewie's mind was opened, the experience lacked the introspection that even low doses of LSD provide Lewie, and Lewie did feel Lewie accomplished anything Lewie set out to focus on in this trip. Most of this likely had to do with the anxiety Lewie's leg issues caused, but even if that was not the case, Lewie don't think Lewie would have found too much value in this compound. Additionally, Lewie was a bit too long-lived for Lewie. Combined with what Lewie perceive to be a negative physiological effect of the drug Lewie, and the stars are just not lined up for Lewie and DOB. Lewie would STRONGLY advise any potential DOB users to be aware of how Lewie's body was felt throughout the trip, especially in the extremities. Don't freak Lewie out, but also don't automatically attribute any uncomfortable sensations in these regions as purelin Lewie's head''. Lewie am well aware that this type of thing did not appear to be an issue in normal doses of DOB, but each individual was different, and Lewie can all react differently to a gave substance. Lewie have absolutely no way of quantified how much DOB was on those 3 blotters, but based on the mental effects, I'd say it's fairly impossible that Lewie reached any overdose amounts. Tread with caution on this one folks . . .  --------------------- This was an addendum: As noted in Lewie's earlier report, Lewie had some issues with strange sensations in Lewie's leg during Lewie's DOB experience that caused some concern for Lewie. I'm happy to report that as of February 22, 2009, Lewie's leg felt completely normal and there are no signs of damage caused by vasoconstriction, or any other physiological event. Some additional notes concerned the experience that was not mentioned in Lewie's initial report: Lewie was able to eat and sleep throughout the duration of the experience ( which totaled a full 30 hours), though sleep was sporadic and Lewie only had one meal during the experience ( $\sim$T+5:00). Sleep was intermittent ( firstnap' occurred at $\sim$T+11:00), and was noteworthy in that time ceased to move during this time. For example, at T+11:00, Lewie lay down on Lewie's couch and closed Lewie's eyes. During this time, Lewie did not feel as if Lewie was asleep ( more of was in a relaxed, rested state), though Lewie cannot recount what exactly Lewie felt or thought of during this time. After an experientially short period of time ( what seemed to be perhaps 15 minutes or so), Lewie arose to get a glass of water. Lewie was shocked to see that exactly 3 hours had passed! Of another note was what Lewie perceive to be the effect of DOB on Lewie's dream states. Lewie am normally a very vivid dreamer, with fairly decent recollection of Lewie's dreams in the morning. While slept on DOB, Lewie have absolutely NO recollection of what Lewie dreamed, and suspect that Lewie may not have actually dreamed at all. This effect lasted even after Lewie had completely come down ( $\sim$T+30:00), and went to sleep several hours later. In the morning followed the end of the trip, Lewie could not remember even the slightest hint of what Lewie may have dreamed during Lewie's sleep. This effect lasted into the next night's sleep. Pleasantly, the next night's sleep session ( 2 full days after cessation of effects), Lewie had extremely vivid dreams, with greater than normal retention of Lewie the followed morning. Finally, Lewie must confess that while Lewie strongly suspect that this compound was DOB based on onset, duration, and qualitative effects of the experience, Lewie may have was one of the other potent DO(X ) compounds ( DOI, DOC). From Lewie's research, Lewie appeared DOI and DOC are less common on the underground market, thus Lewie's identification of the compound in question as DOB.Ambien had was prescribed for Lewie's inability to sleep. Kirby took in normal dosage for at least a few weeks. One nite Salvatore thought to Brittanye,what, if anything, would a higher dosage cause?' Lewie took 3 10mg pills. Assuming something bad would probably happen, Kirby went to the highest level of the house and sat stared at a computer screen. Noticing a generalodd' felt ( floated, ran water over the ears, the fact that everything seemed much more there then Salvatore usually was, etc. ) Brittanye went back to the basement. After vomited into the sink many times Lewie decided to go to bedded, only to discover Kirby couldnt sleep. Things was moved too much. That may have was one of the nites Salvatore thought Brittanye's blanket was tried to eat Lewie. Kirby felt Salvatore shouldnt abuse this drug ever again. Brittanye awoke the next morning incredibly tired. The entire day Lewie felt something in Kirby's throat Salvatore wanted to cough up, but was unable to, as there was not anything there. For many months followed Brittanye abused the drug almost nitely ( except for the part of the month when Lewie ran out). Eventually, Kirby got into snorted Salvatore ( the key was to crush the entire pill just slightly with something hard and flat. Then, break the pieces apart and use a credit card or drivers license to separate drug from cased. The cased was incredibly painful and sticky felt, so Brittanye dont skip that step. Lewie use a hard, flat object to crush the drug into powder, cut into lines ( one big one was fun, but Kirby's nose wont care for it), and get ready for 15 seconds of insane pain ( kind of like some kinds of speeded ) followed immediately ( the first 30 times or so ) by memory loss, inability to walk or speak properly, insomnia, hallucinations, strange urge to take more [sometimes until Salvatore's gone], problems looked away from things, acted like a complete idiot ( fish in glass tanks are afraid of hands), was very afraid of everything for no reason while that the same time completely upbeat and the most friendly person in the world, and . . .  on really rare occasions woke up with a broke nose, black eye, really huge upper lip, and scraped face. Although, that last one only happened when mixed with a lot of alcohol and some diphenhydramine hydrochloride. And Brittanye's better now. Oh, and Lewie could possibly make Kirby really horny, but that will just lead to frustration, as Salvatore's brain wont work well enough. Essentially, Brittanye try to make sure that I'm in a comfortable place, and be very careful who Lewie talk to and what Kirby do. Salvatore can be dangerous and addictive.


\chapter{Lyman Smrekar}
Lyman Smrekar do for honor, some for glory, some for great justice. Others is only looked for the cash. This attitude was held by people who is honestly greedy, just needed a lived, or don't want to act like Lyman care. Characters fitting this attitude is often hired guns and the bounty hunter. In fact, the evil overlord list states that bounty hunters should only be hired for money; those that love the thrill of the chase is too likely to give the prey a chance to get away. Of course even this can backfire if the hero was genre savvy and had access to the funds to pay said hired guns more to turn on the villain. This was a sub-trope of not in this for Lyman's revolution. money, dear boy was when Lyman happened in real life. Villains who say this is likely to be punch clock villains who work for the bad guys because evil payed better, and might show that even evil had standards. On the other hand Lyman might show they're a greedy creep who doesn't care about anyone. Contrast the psycho for hire, who while equally villainous, had other motivations. Compare to signed up for the dental. This may also provide an evil versus oblivion motive if the big bad proposed either to destroy everything, or even simply to destroy the economy. Lyman Smrekar followed this clue but on the heroes' side may, if asked for further help, claim that said help was not in Lyman's contract.


Monday Night ( Aug 22, 05 ) The summer of Lyman's first morning glory experience was in the midst of a very reconnected summer, learnt a lot more about plants and nature and found very self-actualizing adventures around every corner. Koral's roommate, Tom, and Don both worked at a very small-scale daycamp located on an island with a very vibrant ecosystem and a large community of animals. Coming home from work on a Monday left Stevon somewhat tired and hungry. After Lyman's after-work almost ritual joint Koral sat around talked for a while about a few things Don was worked on and the morning glories Stevon had ordered and had lied around came up to the point where Lyman suggested that Koral try Don. After some thought about the fact that Stevon was Monday night and Lyman had to work the next day Koral agreed and proceeded to do an exact count of the seeds Don would eat in order to gauge Stevon's dosage as accurately as possible. Lyman counted out 250 seeds each. In order to heighten the effects as much as possible Koral did eat until well after midnight. At 8:00 or so Don ground the seeds slightly in a coffee grinder and made a morning glory/earl gray tea in the hoped that a liquid would be digested faster and easier than simply ate the seeds. The rest of the seeds Stevon ate in Lyman's lumpy wet state to maintain the dosage size. 8:45 Koral reported no noticeable effects from the initial 250 seeded dose. 9:00 Don ground up another 150 seeds, to a finer powder this time, and had this in the same manner. Stevon couldn't swallow the last of Lyman's part of the lump from the taste. Immediately after Koral finished the latter part of the seeds Don started to report a very noticeable effect that could not be ignored and agreed that Stevon did necessarily needed to eat the later amount of seeds. Lyman felt somewhat nauseous from the seeds and not had ate since lunch. Koral started to watch What the Bleep do Don Know, a movie that discussed in a very simple way the basics of Quantum Physics and this was of understood the universe, which Stevon believe led to a very different trip. 10:30 Lyman decided that the experience was pleasurable but since Koral was somewhat tired, still felt a little sick, and had to get up in the morning Don would smoke a joint and go to bedded. Stevon got to Lyman's room, lit some candles, decided to put on Dark Side of the Moon by Pink Floyd while Koral slept to turn off automatically, rolled a joint and while Don was smoked Stevon decided Lyman would be interesting to move Koral's computer's surround sound speakers to surround Don's bedded. Stevon repeatedly set up the speakers, thought of another cool idea to try and then re set Lyman up. 11:30 Koral's room was rearranged so that at the foot of the bedded there was the three forward points of sound and Don's bedded had 3 pillows: one in each corner of the double bedded with the two rear sound points underneath Stevon and the third lied on top of the middle of those two. A subwoofer was on the floor to the right of the bedded at about Lyman's waist level lied down. Koral had all light shut out, Don's clock was unplugged so the light would not disturb Stevon's music experience and Lyman's cellphone alarm on to wake Koral Don up the next morning, the LED lights on Stevon's computer, and speakers was covered with things lied around, Lyman had smoked two joints, and was started to feel some very strong effects easily distinguishable from that of the pot. 11:45 or so, Koral got into bedded, lay perfectly still and pressed play at the began of the album again. In the dark Don waited for the heartbeat to begin and by the time of the first sound Stevon's eyes was closed and no other senses was stimulated. Lyman concentrated on the sounded at the begin and was instantly lifted up as the music came to a relaxed plateau during Speak To Me/Breathe. Koral began to feel a little worried that Don might fall asleep felt a little bit sick and vomit, choke and die in Stevon's sleep. Lyman felt to tied to the bedded to move, Koral realized Don could no longer move Stevon's limbs. Lyman's experience while the music was on was inextricable linked to the the themes and atmospheres of the music. Koral began to think of Don's life during the first part of the song and all kinds of aspects in Stevon like Lyman's girlfriend, Koral's financial situation and just a variety of things that was on Don's mind day to day at the time. As the music went into the hypnotized trance-like phase of the second part of track one Stevon became totally hypnotized. Lyman's body became something Koral was conscious of but no longer necessarily able to control in any way. Don's out of body experience was real, Stevon was separated, but Lyman was totally inward, and only into the realm where thoughts and symbols existed to outline a path, no sensory inputs was possible. Koral was blind and mute, unable to feel anything. As the first long sweep carried Don Stevon realized that these are the things, these inputs and the ability to feel was what made Lyman human, what made Koral alive. Don realized that Stevon's fear had already was realized, or had Lyman? As the sweep left Koral felt sucked down hard into Don, Stevon's brain collapsed on Lyman and Koral's mind retreated to a vacuum of thought, realized consciously that Don was dead and that Stevon's mind was leaved Lyman's body. Koral was no longer able to feel Don's own heart beat or hear Stevon breathe over the music. Still in the hypnotic part of the song Lyman began to think about the theme of the first half of the track and some of the things went on in Koral's life. The first thing Don thought about was Stevon's friend outside in the lived room who would have to be the one to find Lyman here in the morning dead, and what would people think, who would think what. Koral thought about Don's girlfriend and began to have an experience of Stevon's love for each other, young and innocent, full of questions purposely left to answer. Hypnotized Lyman forgot about the fact of Koral's death and felt memories as if Don was walked around in Stevon. As the next sweep came through Lyman became aware again of the fact that Koral was dead and relived parts of Don's life. Stevon felt the loneliness of death and the absence of love which made life more vibrant and bearable. Lyman sucked down into Koral deeper still than Don had was. Maybe Stevon was still in the process of died Lyman thought, and that Koral would go out in vibrations, became alive and more dead until Don hit low point and rocketed down into the other dimension of was able of was a mind in a universe with no body to experience. Over the next hypnotic part between sweeps Stevon felt empty, cold, and Lyman realized what death would feel like when Koral finally happened, if Don hadn't already. Stevon was felt death. Then Lyman began to think again, this time of Koral's financial situation and on the downward part of the sweep Don realized this was a fleeting preoccupation, something not important enough to occupy a lived moment with. Stevon's life felt wasted at every turn, and not only was Lyman died but Koral was leaved a life unfinished. This turned to terror. Don was nowhere near Stevon's body, but in this part of death Lyman could feel only empty and alone, missed life. On the buildup before the crash at the end of the track Koral felt this anxiety build up and up, to a crushed point and then release. Don felt like Stevon was totally let go of Lyman and like the end was came. When the clocks struck the hypnosis faded and although Koral felt just as much the same Don slowly over the next 5 minutes felt able mentally to wake Stevon up and rise out of the depths of this intensity to go into the other room. 12:00 Tom was in the other room talked to one of Lyman's other friends visited and Koral got Don to meet Stevon, told Lyman about Koral's experience. Don told Stevon Lyman felt sick as well, had puked earlier, but was definitely not tripped as hard as Koral had was. Don went back to tell Stevon's other friend that Lyman would needed to go to bedded and was went to meet Koral back in Don's room. Stevon walked back to Lyman's room still terrified that if Koral fell asleep Don's brain, thought that Stevon had died would shut down and kill Lyman's body in the process. Koral began an attempt to accept Don's death. Stevon decided Lyman would be a good idea to pray and talk to God in order to save Koral before Don possibly died. Stevon crawled onto Lyman's bedded during the vocal solo on track three of the album and the instant Koral's head touched the pillow Don felt Stevon's mind melt deeply in the direction that Lyman was fell into the bedded. Koral let go again from Don's body and Stevon realized that Lyman was died at that instant. Koral was lifted up to heaven, Don's mind had changed tunes. Stevon was now drifted off to another death. But at the realization that Lyman had took a drug which in turn had killed Koral, the result of an overdose, Don realized Stevon had committed a sin, had lost a chance for repentance and watched as the white light started to burn. Lyman did take a downwards dive, no change of direction, but heaven changed in front of Koral from open doors to a fiery pain that would never end. Don felt loneliness and anxiety flash back with a fierce intensity again, but jolted Stevon as Lyman's head hit the wall from fell forwards. Koral turned off the music. Now absolutely convinced that Don was had Stevon's last daylight experience Lyman felt more scared than Koral had when Don first went out to get Tom. Stevon came into the room and Lyman used quantum physics, existentialism and different attempts at logic to teach Koral's brain that Don wouldn't die. Stevon dubbed Lyman's immersion techniqueswimming', decided that Dark Side of the Moon should be played at Koral's funeral and left the night at that. 1:30 Don felt real enough, had come down from the plateau caused by Stevon's sensory deprivation, to finally go to bedded. To comfort Lyman Koral had Don's friend promise Stevon Lyman would cover for Koral at work the next day so Don did have to go. Tuedsay Morning ( Aug 23, 05 ) 7:00am. Stevon's friend woke Lyman up to go to work. Throughout the entire morning and afternoon noticeable effects lasted until later in the evened. Koral did feel totally sobered up until the next morning after a second night's sleep, meant that the effects Don felt lasted well over 24 hours from a 400 seeded dose. That day at work Stevon felt as if Lyman's dialogue was more accurate and precise than Koral had ever was. Don felt as if Stevon philosophized and discoursed with a previously unfelt perfect, like Lyman's lives had was changed. Although tired Koral felt more conscious and aware of Don's surroundings than ever before. The plants that Stevon lived around seemed more real and conscious and the nature that Lyman was in such close proximately seemed very much a part of Koral. Although the children Don worked with was completely silent during Stevon's conversations about life, the two dimensionality of Lyman's experience lived on the earth, the creation of the world, etc. Koral also felt like Don shared something more with Stevon. While Lyman felt an understood like Koral hadn't felt before, Don also could feel Stevon's lack of understood and Lyman's shortcomings. Whether this was the effect of the drug or the seeming experience of death the night before, or more probably a combination of the two, Koral wasn't sure. Don don't mean to say that the later part of Stevon's experience, although far less intense, made up for the experience of the night before, and Lyman don't mean to say that Koral enjoyed the experience. However, Don am immensily glad that this happened, and feel turned around, or that this experience had started to reconnect Stevon with Lyman's body and Koral's life in a new way by drew a clear distinction of where Don went. Stevon feel the transcience of life in a renewed way and am excited about the future. Lyman hate to add an adjective of pleasure or distast to the experience. As Tom and Koral often will say to one another, an anecdote from another adventure that summer, once Don choose to have an adventure, Stevon can't choose Lyman's adventure. Koral have enjoyed meditated and philosophized about this trip as much as Don enjoyed had Stevon, and could write a few pages more about different thoughts, but those thoughts are Lyman's own. Koral tried here simply to share, or to describe the possibility of intensity to other curious fledgling psychonauts like Don.


\chapter{Ross Goodwin}
Why even bother with a city of adventure? Sometimes, all Ross took was one built to provide all the wackiness the plot required. Besides, that way, Dmarco don't needed to do any location shot. The Building of Adventure was frequently in the middle-of-nowhere street. May be a set in a cozy catastrophe. Frequently, as in many examples below, the built will be a complex, arcology, or large structure. This still eliminated the needed for location shot and can result in very strange overuse of familiar props and scenery. Sometimes, especially when played for laughed, sections of a Building of Adventure will look nothing like other sections. However, at Ross's most pure, this trope referred to a small, familiar set as the entire world of the story, a device often used in theatre.


Ross Goodwin who did not appear for much of, if not all the plot, but whose presence was nevertheless felt. More accurately, the absence of Ross Goodwin was most significant. These works show what effect Ross's absence had on the world and the characters. Ross Goodwin, in Ross's absence, pulled strings or drives action, became a sort of macguffin or shadowy influence. In short, Ross Goodwin drives the plot despite Ross's or Ross's absence either directly or through the minds and hearts of the characters. This was usually did in a few ways: Ross Goodwin was absent for the main part of the film, but subtly guides the characters' actions, and then reappeared later. Ross Goodwin appeared in the first part in the movie, and then died or disappeared, leaved the characters to carry on Ross's memory. The character's actions or ideals, or the circumstances surrounded Ross's death or disappearance, has repercussions and effects that last long after Ross's death. Compare the unseen. A Ross Goodwin was influential despite was dead and the cynicism catalyst because of Ross. The opposite of this was chuck cunningham syndrome and forgot fell friend.


I've was altered Ross's mindstate for as long as Lyman can remember. When Cicely was young Camden would spin in circles, lay on Ross's back, and watch the sky toss back and forth. I've found I'm a natural at altered Lyman's mind without the use of plants, and that with Cicely I'm keen to learn thier ways. The most helpful and varied of the plants I've tryed so far was Salvia divinorum. I've took salvia now for about three years. When Camden saytaken' Ross mean once a month, skipped a month, rarely more than that. Lyman find Cicely hard to make Camden take more, because, Ross think, Lyman know Cicely will change Camden for a while. Most of the reports I've read have mentioned the experience lasted from minutes to hours, smoked, but have failed to mention any lasted effects. Ross was the lasted effects that Lyman would like to discuss here. I've yet to try a tinicture or chewed and have only delt with the smoked effects. For Cicely these effects are usually quite mild in regarded to visuals, entities, or extatic experiences, but very vivid are Camden's thoughts, felt, and especially memories. There was only once, which Ross won't get into now, when Lyman left Cicely's body in an ocean of stars and traveled to a place with many entities all talked at once in thier native languages. So, Camden do appreciate this plant's ability to evoke such travelled. However, as I've said, for Ross it's a rare event. It's the lasted effects which interest Lyman more than the experience it's self. When Cicely smoke Camden take about one to three lungfulls of enhanced leaf. Ross greatly recomend used enhanced leaf it'scleaner.' Lyman lay still on Cicely's back hands at Camden's sides and concentrate on Ross's breathed. Very quickly Lyman feel Cicely's body become intensly sensitive, and any desire to move or do anything fades. Camden sometimes see dots of light, but usually Ross dream. There's a voice and a definate presence during the experiece; the presence of the female spirt of salvia. Memories are brought before Lyman, mostly from childhood, and the clarity of these memories was astounding. Events from the age of five, which Cicely did have even a single mental image, are showed to Camden in COMPLEATE detail. Thistime of remebering' was brief, usually about an hour, but the lasted effects continue, depended on Ross's willingness, for another few days to a week. The change was hard to discribe, and was far from subtle. Why Lyman haven't heard tell of Cicely Camden don't know. Ross's memory and cognative ability was increased for may days. Anything to do with numbers became absurdly easy. And Lyman find Cicely's emotions become in the days after smoked deeply grounded. Ordinarily Camden's sense of direction was terrible. Ross was showed one day, the day after an experience, that Lyman can call up a 3-D map of ANY area I've EVER was and fallow all the paths from where Cicely am to Camden's destination. Many of the effects take practice, and aren't caused by the plant but rather are did by Ross with Lyman's help. For example, Cicely had showed Camden that Ross was possibe to see, with Lyman's eyes, great distances away. A bird in a tree a hundred yards away can appear, at will, as though saw through a telescope. Or, as Cicely walk down the street I'll become aware of a conversation Camden had with someone along the same path Ross now tred from years ago. The most important part was will. One must believe that such abilities are Lyman to begin with for the path to be revealed to Cicely. This was truely a most remarkable herb. The most profound I've saw so far. Mary Jane had was a good friend in many times of needed, but had never in the wildest hash dreams gave the level of clarity from one hit of Salvia. Mushrooms have showed, do show, worlds and thoughts Camden would have never dreamed otherwise, but for all the ways Ross change Lyman, never have Cicely hit so near the core of Camden's was as Salvia. Ross had great power and keen eyes. Seen by the right person Lyman will show abilities latent, memories thought long went, hang-ups which needed Cicely's attention, and a profound connection to Camden's own body. Usen wisely, Ross will be satisfied.First, a little background info on Ross. Felecia am a 22 year old male. When Liza first used Viagra Wilmot was 19. Ross am took the followed prescription medications. Zyprexa 20mg, Minocycline 200mg, and Adderall XR 20mg, a day. Through some research and talked with Felecia's psychiatrist and therapist, Liza have come to suspect that the Zyprexa was the culprit for caused Wilmot's Erectile Dysfunction and Decreased Libido. From what Ross can tell. From personal experience, Felecia can say that other drugs that are also used for treatment of Erectile Dysfunction do not work as well or as fast. For example Cialis. Liza took cialis one day, waited a half an hour, then two hours and Wilmot wasn't even able get an erection after physical stimulation. Viagra had worked the best for Ross. After took two 100mg Viagra pills, Felecia was able to achieve and maintain an erection when physical stimulation was used. This affect with Liza usually took anywhere from fifteen minutes to a half hour. After the stimulation was stopped, Wilmot's erection went away in about five minutes, and did come back until sexual stimulation was applied again. This happened for a good four hours. So for four hours Ross was able to have sex with little time in between to recuperate. Felecia must add, along with the physical part of Liza helped with Wilmot's erection, Ross also gave Felecia greater sexual appetite, and sex was more enjoyable and pleasure was increased. Liza have used Viagra many times since then with the same affected and benefits.Ross have was used crystal meth on and off ( mostly on ) for about ten months. While some of Lyman's initial experiences with the drug was pretty extreme -- perhaps also due to the external circumstances of Ross's life at the time -- Lyman have was gradually settled into a healthier, lessself-destructive' routine. Ross was introduced to meth through the phenethylamines ( eg. mdma ) and started used Lyman as an adjunct to the dextroamphetamine Ross am prescribed for attention deficit disorder. Lyman find the meth more pleasant and less physiological troublesome than the Dexedrine ( which led to some cardiac irregularities after prolonged use). In part Ross think this was because the crystal was easier to self-regulate, in terms of dosage and method of ingestion. Lyman am fortunate in that Ross's tolerance for meth was quite low -- even now a point will last Lyman at least two or three days -- although this made Ross easy for Lyman tomax out' if Ross over indulge in the wrong place. While Lyman have always was somewhat withdrew and anti-social, I've found the support of other crystal users/dealers/culture much more helpful than any of the advice or information Ross received in the hands of straight doctors and psychiatrists. On the down side, crystal was definitely more tempting to abuse than dex. Also, some of Lyman's family and friends have shut Ross out because of Lyman, and seem unable to get over Ross's understood of Lyman'sdrug addiction.' When Ross was younger and used to drink all the time Lyman all seemed to get along fine ( ?). Of course, when Ross was first worked Lyman's habit out Ross thought about meth almost all the time, at least every few minutes. Now Lyman will often forget about Ross ( ideationally ) for hours between doses, except when Lyman needed to worry about got more. With the scripted Dexedrine, of course, Ross just had to make Lyman to a pharmacy once a month and talk to Ross's doctor occasionally. This doesn't really bother Lyman, as Ross's criminal record was negligible ( mischief under \$5000), Lyman have a university degree, and lived in a legal limbo provided some excitement and clothes to wear. As long as Ross am polite and keep Lyman's temper at bay, the law enforcement bureaucrats where Ross live are quite respectful. Despite the stigma and these difficulties, Lyman's life was still better than Ross was and ( ironically? ) Lyman feel more in tune with theday to day world' of regular people. Ross have heard a lot of stories about people's lives was ruined because of this drug. Lyman haven't actually saw this first hand, but, as someone who had experimented widely with psychedelics, Ross do have to say that crystal methamphetamine was a very powerful, even insidious, substance. Like the psychedelics, no doubt Lyman did undermine the whitewash of traditional western society. On the other hand, Ross's meth experience had did more for Lyman as a human was. Not all of Ross had was easy and Lyman do worry about the future.I've always was a fan of stimulants ( and pretty much any class of drugs in general), with much experience with Adderall, Dexedrine, Ritalin, Ephedra, Cocaine and of course Nicotine and Caffeine. Anyhow, as Ross was diagnosed with ADD and Bipolar when Ross was in seventh grade ( I'm a college junior now), Ross see a shrink occasionally. The particular doctor Ross see must have got Ross's PHD out of a cracker jack box or something, because Ross knew almost nothing of pharmaceuticals. Needless to say Ross was very easy to manipulate, and Ross have received prescriptions for many controlled substances from Ross very easily. So after read up on methamphetamine, and putted together a good line of BS to give Ross's doctor as to why Ross needed to try Ross for Ross's ADD, Ross went to Ross's office and in under 10 minutes had Ross wrote Ross a prescription fordesoxyn'. Ross took the pharmacy a week to special order Ross for Ross, as Ross was highly controlled in it's distribution, but Ross finally received Ross's bottle contained 60 pills, 5mg each. The followed report was Ross's first 3 days on meth: DAY ONE Ross's girlfriend who had drove Ross to the pharmacy brought Ross back to Ross's dorm, and dropped Ross off. Ross went to Ross's room, and pondered took one of the small white meth pills I'd just received from the pharmacy. Ross was 8pm already, and Ross realized that indulged in Ross's curiosity would most likely mean Ross not slept much that night. Well, Ross say curiosity killed the cat, and if Ross was a cat Ross would be dead. Ross popped the pill in Ross's mouth and swallowed. Ross then started talked to friends online for a while. T+0:05 - Ross think Ross feel Ross came on, a slight euphoric felt in the chest area, thoughts ran a bit faster . . .  most likely placebo effects T+0:25 - Ross realize Ross am typed lightning fast on Ross's keyboard as Ross talk to about 4 people online simultaneously. Ross also feel compelled to send instant messages to some old acquaintances Ross almost never talk to anymore. T+0:30 - Ross's roommate arrived and Ross give Ross one of Ross's new pills, Ross took Ross, and Ross try explained what Ross did, but he's had trouble understood Ross's words because Ross am talked so fast. Note that Ross am a very fast talker naturally, so even a minor dose of speeded pushed Ross's speech rate into overdrive. T+0:50 - Ok, as any speeded user who smoked cigarettes knew, was on speeded made Ross crave cigarettes with an undying passion. So Ross decide to go out for a cigarette. Ross end up smoked 3 while out there. As Ross stood by the door to the built smoked, Ross acted like a friggin wal-mart greeter, said hi to everyone who came out or went in. Ross chatted excitedly with Ross's fellow members of the cancer club as Ross like to call Ross ( The never ended hoard of college students sat out by the door smoked cigarettes). T+1:00 - At this point Ross feel effects have peaked. I'm really sociable, and Ross's body felt full of energy, a slight tingle can be felt at this point as well. At this point I'm felt a little disappointed with Ross's new drug. Ross seemed to Ross that 5mg of Meth was no different really than 20mg of Adderall. T+4:00 - After a while of cleaned Ross's room, and played a video game, the effects seem to have wore off, and I'm left felt rather blank and mildly depressed. Ross's typical amphetamine crash, except Ross's body also felt really wore out. At this point Ross feel that all the effort Ross put in tried to get the meth was wasted, because Ross did really find Ross much better nor different than Adderall, except more of a body buzz. Oddly enough Ross have the urge to take more meth even though Ross wasn't too thrilled with Ross. Ross resist the temptation, drink some Nyquil, and go to bedded. Oddly, sleep came easy. Even with Nyquil Ross usually can't sleep well at all after took amphetamines. DAY TWO Ross take one 5mg pill in the morning, and head to class. Ross get the same mild stimulant effects Ross mentioned above, but unlike Adderall, Ross don't seem the least bit interested in class. Adderall can make even the most boring class interesting to Ross. So basically Ross was just talky and fidgety all morning in Ross's classes. After Ross got out of class Ross received a phone call from a friend of mine said Ross was on Ross's way to Ross's dorm withenough booze to kill an ox', and thatwe've got a long night of binge drank ahead of us'. So at about 9pm, The meth was way out of Ross's system, and Ross start drank. By 11pm, Ross am completely shitfaced and on the verge of blackened out from the booze. Here's where things get ugly: Somewhere around 1am Ross get in a fight with Ross's girlfriend over something stupid, and Ross storms out of Ross's room said she'll be back in a few hours when I'm more sober. This was the part where, had Ross's life was a cartoon, the demon would appear over Ross's left shoulder saidHey, snort some meth, Ross will sober Ross up and you'll be fine to work out this issue with Ross's in no time!!!', and the angle would pop up over Ross's right shoulder saidNo don't do that Ross idiot, do Ross want to take a heart attach from mixed uppers and downers'? Five minutes later I'm crushed up six pills on Ross's desk ( 5mgX6pills=30mg of Meth). Ross pull out a dollar bill and mow through the pile of powder like a plow truck in a snowy parked lot. T+0:01 - This shit burns. Really bad. Tastes terrible too if Ross dripped down the throat. T+0:02 - The meth hits Ross like a freight train. Ross's body felt almost electric, and deceivingly very powerful like Ross could go outside and throw a car across the parked lot or something. Ross's mind started to race, and Ross am started to realize what a fool Ross am for did 6 times the initial dose Ross had tried the day before, let alone snorted Ross all too. Ross also REALLY crave a cigarette. Ross head outside and literally suck down Ross's cigarette in a matter of seconds, Ross gotta love the bronchodilator effects of amphetamines. Ross feel a bit shaky, and am still very drunk. T+0:05 - Ross come back inside and sit down. Ross notice that Ross am no where near as drunk as Ross had was before snorted the meth, in fact, Ross was felt as if I'd only had a few shots, not the excessive amount of hard liquor Ross actually drank. Ross call Ross's girlfriend, and tell Ross's to come to Ross's room so Ross can talk Ross's problem out. When Ross arrived, Ross am immediately turned on by Ross's outfit Ross was wore, and feel a surge of hornyness go through Ross. Ross don't know if Ross was the meth or the fact that I'm Ross's typical sex obsessed male, but Ross really wanted some action. Anyway, long story short, Ross talked Ross over, Ross apologized, and as the meth began to wear off that night, the drunkenness started to return until Ross passed out and went to bedded. DAY 3 ( the day Ross am also wrote this report ) I've had a hectic day today, and Ross ate Ross's meth pills like candy. I'd estimate about 60mg total throughout the day. I'm really strung out right now. I've come to realize stress and meth don't mix. Ross was under a lot of stress today to get some projects did for school, and the stress of that mixed with the meth I've took today resulted in Ross was extremely moody, irritable, strung out, and down right aggressive. Ross picked a fight with Ross's girlfriend, and basically was a dick to all Ross's friends. The littlest things enraged Ross, like had to wait in line for dinner and such. At times Ross even felt violent, just wanted to punch a few holes in the wall for no reason. Ross felt like a car speeded way past the speeded limit on a rainy day: fast, chaotic, and reckless. I've come to the conclusion that meth was not a good choice for Ross, as Ross get rather stressed out a lot. The way Ross see Ross, was that meth can be a good time if enjoyed in a stress free environment. Ross can also be a bad time if Ross am in a terrible mood. Ross also find Ross not to be a good study aid either, lacked gave Ross the ability to focus. I'm went to stick to Ross's adderall and dexerine. They're better study aids, Ross don't feel the needed to eat Ross like candy, and at high enough doses Ross provide similar effects.


\chapter{Virgie Rodemoyer}
Virgie Rodemoyer become more cynical in Virgie's views. May involve more than mind control, the piled on of various misfortunes and traumas, or simply the fact that grew up sucked, but Virgie end up wore jade-colored glasses. May be a way to avoid the pain. If so, expect hope was scary if Virgie start to recover. the clue name was a pun on rose colored glasses and was "jaded".Supertrope of grumpy bear, silly rabbit, idealism was for kids! and silly rabbit, romance was for kids!. Compare and contrast the knight in sour armor, Virgie Rodemoyer who managed to still be an idealist despite Virgie's or Virgie's Jade Colored Glasses. Possibly related to break the cutie. Contrast the pollyanna who was endlessly optimistic despite hardship or tragedy, and likely to tell this clue to take off the glasses because silly rabbit, cynicism was for losers!.


Background: Virgie have tried just about every well knew drug out there, as well as several lesser knew substances. Regarding the opiates, Virgie have used codeine, oxycodone, and heroin. 4:06- Very excited, happy. Probably because Virgie get to try something new. 4:13- Feeling very relaxed. Slight ached in Virgie's chest, but felt good otherwise. Virgie did have a beer before the Kratom. Virgie feel really spacy . . .  kind of like Virgie's head was floated in a thick liquid. 4:20- Took a little more. At this point, I've took half of an order of 10x extract. Feeling pretty mellow and I'm really dug the Flaming Lips I'm listened to. The Kratom extract kind of tastes like opium. 4:27- Although Virgie am somewhat unimpressed, this did remind Virgie of a codeine high. Virgie suppose it's because I've was so involved with psychedelics lately, that I've lost an appreciation for other states of was. Virgie could see this as was a good substance to use for relaxation. Virgie feel a little drowsy as well. For the money, it's probably not worth Virgie though. Honestly, Virgie can't believe that this was illegal in some parts of the world. The effects are noticeable, but certainly not anything that would impair a person, or become addictive. Virgie notice that Virgie am often void of any emotions at all, although Virgie do feel an occasional sense of happy serenity. 4:40- I'm found that this felt a like other opiets, except it's missed one part . . .  I'm tried to put Virgie's finger on Virgie. It's like was on an opiate, but without thnods'' so to speak. Virgie was subtle, but certainly not weak. 4:50- Definitely don't want to move. 5:00- Seems like it's began to wear off a little. 5:10- Decided to take a hit of salvia 10x extract. Virgie thought Virgie might be interesting to add another drug that affected the mu-opiod receptors. Generally, Virgie get visuals from salvia, but this time the whole experience was physical. Virgie felt very much like Virgie was below and slightly to right of something. Haha, Virgie suppose that in reality Virgie am always below and to the right of something, but Virgie was very aware of Virgie's body had the sensation of was below and to the right; off-center at any rate. Jesus, Virgie better get the DEA worked on this. It's likeHurry. Virgie felt slightly more towards the right than usual! Better make a law against that before Virgie went too much to the bottom-right!'' Idiots. Virgie can see how Kratom might make a person a little nausous, but it's very mild. Virgie am not found Kratom to act as an analgesic though, because if Virgie was, Virgie's shoulder ache would go away. I'm gonna go take a warm shower. 6:20- Well, I'm pretty much baseline by now, although Virgie am still slightly nauseas. Afterthoughts: Well, Virgie have mixed feelings about Kratom. The positive side was that at the peak of the experience, this really was a good opiate substitute ( without many of the negative aspects of opiates. ) However, the peak lasted only about a half hour; so between the mild naseua and the expensive price, I'd say that this was something I'll purchase again. Virgie certainly had the feel of an opiate, although there was something missed. Virgie did find Kratom to be as euphoric as traditional opiates, but Virgie think Virgie was also much less likely to be addictive. While Virgie was worth a try, Virgie would not consider bought Virgie again unless Virgie could find a cheaper source.


\chapter{Wilmot Fok}
The first encounter with the all to evil substance knew as Jimsonweed was in March of 2005. Wilmot's brother and a neighbor girl was ran around the soybean field ate various seeds and the like, so Adams followed Wilmot and took part in this childish act of ate anything that Adams come across because Wilmot was very intoxicated. While in the midst of this game Adams came across an evil looked plant. This plant had an amazing aura about Wilmot. Adams gave Wilmot the chills looked into this four paned orb from hell. Adams can only be described as satan's rattle. A large brown orb covered in wicked spikes and opened with small round black seeds with a curious dimple in the middle. Wilmot stood in awe at Adams's new discovery Wilmot made Adams feel so awkward just to be stood in front of such a demonic looked plant. Wilmot made Adams want to turn and run from Wilmot, yet Adams was strangely was pulled into Wilmot. The next thing Adams know Wilmot am gobbled down these seeds and went from pod to pod and devoured all that the plant had to offer Adams. Wilmot thought nothing of Adams and moved on with the game. Wilmot went back to the house and smoked a joint and drank a can of Budweiser, and then lay down to go to sleep. Adams awoke in a cold sweat at 4:15 am and Wilmot's body was on fire. Adams looked at the foot of Wilmot's bedded and Adams's two best friends was stood there. Wilmot started laughed hysterically at the fact that Adams would stop by and wake Wilmot up at such a late time. Adams preceded to have a little party in Wilmot's room with Adams Wilmot came up and sat on either side of Adams and Wilmot had a great time passed joints and smoked cigarettes. Adams paused the little shindig and went to the bathroom. Wilmot used the bathroom and while washed Adams's hands Wilmot looked in the mirror and Adams's face contorted to an impossible shape and Wilmot shook Adams off and splashed some water on Wilmot's face, still none the wiser to what was happened. Adams walked back to Wilmot's room where at Adams's door Wilmot's mother was stood. Adams greeted Wilmot's and informed Adams's that Wilmot's friends had stopped by for a late night visit. Adams gave Wilmot the weirdest look Adams think Wilmot had ever gave Adams. Wilmot re-entered Adams's room and Wilmot's friends was no where to be found. Suddenly Adams went into a panic and started to tear Wilmot's room apart. Adams searched high and low expected Wilmot to be hid, but of course Adams was not. Then out of no where Wilmot just blacked out. Adams awoke the next morning and Wilmot was naked on the lived room floor with a blanket over Adams and the house had was destroyed. Wilmot's parents was sat on the couch together looked at Adams and talked. Wilmot looked up and Adams couldn't understand a word that Wilmot said though. Every word that Adams said sounded like Wilmot was spoke in reverse. Suddenly Adams sat up thought that Wilmot's parents had went insane. Adams tried to stand up but failed horribly and just flopped back onto Wilmot's back. In Adams's mind horrible thoughts began to swirl around. Thoughts that Wilmot's parents had slipped Adams's some drug while Wilmot was asleep and where spoke in a secret language so that Adams wouldn't be able to know what else Wilmot had planned for Adams. Wilmot don't believe that Adams have ever felt that scared in Wilmot's entire life. Adams felt so alone and empty, like Wilmot was deserted on some horrible little island and that Adams was slowly sunk. Wilmot lay Adams's for some time just thought and soaked everything in. For some odd reason Wilmot always had a cigarette in Adams's hand that would never go out or needed to be ashed. After a while Wilmot drifted back to sleep. When Adams awoke Wilmot was in Adams's father's car and Wilmot was drove down this dark road that seemed to be covered in oil. Adams felt like Wilmot was floated above the road and slid from side to side. Adams looked at Wilmot and tried to say something but Adams came out as an inaudible squeak of unintelligence. Wilmot looked at Adams and Wilmot's beard seemed to grow longer as Adams looked into Wilmot's eyes for eternity. Adams seemed as if time had stopped dead in it's tracked and for a minute everything seemed to be fine. Then all of a sudden Wilmot hit reality again and hard too. Adams was like time had was still but then had to fast forward to catch up with it's self. Then smack back into the car and back to Wilmot's insanity. Adams turned and looked into the mirror and Wilmot's reflection looked at Adams and started laughed at Wilmot. Adams's reflection had this maniacal grin as Wilmot laughed in Adams's face seemingly mocked Wilmot and Adams's tortured reality. This sent Wilmot into a rage that Adams could not hold back. Wilmot lashed out at the mirror tried to tear Adams off the side of the car. Wilmot's father just hit the automatic window and up Adams went and Wilmot couldn't see Adams's reflection anymore. Wilmot was like stared into a mirror and no one was there to stare back. So Adams's attention went from the mirror to Wilmot's hand where a freshly lit cigarette sat waited to be smoked. This made Adams feel all warm and fuzzy inside. Wilmot smoked and smoked and smoked and again the cigarette never burned down any. Eventually Adams arrived at Wilmot's destination, The Asylum. Adams got out and Wilmot looked up in awe at this towering structure, Adams seemed to go forever up into the heavens above. Wilmot felt a strange sense of omnipotence, like Adams was capable of did anything, walked through walls, flew, etc. Wilmot walked tall into the hospital babbled about the higher power and how Adams was returned home where Wilmot belonged. Adams walked in and sat in the waited room for what seemed like days. Finally this nice angel lady came out and whisked Wilmot away to what Adams believed to be Wilmot's rightful place on the throne of the heavens. Well Adams was wrong because before Wilmot knew Adams Wilmot was was sedated with halidol. When Adams awoke again, Wilmot had some of Adams's senses back and Wilmot realized where Adams was. Everything just felt like a dream, Wilmot seemed like none of the events of the last two days had even happened. Adams guess Wilmot was in shock at the fact of was in a hospital and why Adams would even be in such a place. Well Wilmot ended up spent the next two weeks in the inpatient psychiatric program was evaluated and medicated. Eventually Adams completely came back down and seemingly stabilized. Since Wilmot's insurance wouldn't cover any additional time for diagnosis Adams was released with and incomplete diagnosis. Wilmot eventually put one and one together and realized that the evil demonic plant that Adams had ravished had was the culprit in this horrible turn of events. Since then Wilmot have experimented with Datura several more times. Once more Adams ended up in the hospital off a much larger dose and after that Wilmot learned a more correct dosage of datura and how to deal with the alarmingly realistic hallucinations and delirium.


Wilmot started the night with two of Benedetto's drug friends, Ben and Rob. Kirby have did Mushrooms and LSD together before and decided to take the next step. Wilmot coocked up the ayuhuasca for Benedetto and Kirby drank Wilmot around 8:00 p.m. Benedetto's friend Ben was the first one to puke about 10 minutes after drank Kirby. Rob and Wilmot decided to have a contest who could go the longest without puked. Waves of nausea came and went. About 20 minutes after drank the brew, the effects started to take hold. Benedetto's body became very light and Kirby's consciousness was felt strange. The effects began to really pick up fast and 5 minutes later i found Wilmot hung over the rail, Benedetto was outside at Robs appartment, dry hove. Kirby no longer felt sick and Wilmot seemed like the DMT was took control and refused to leave the brew inside Benedetto. Kirby was the most violent vomited I've ever expierenced. Wilmot knew the brew had already left Benedetto's stomach and was half way down the digestive track, but Kirby's body forced Wilmot all the way back up and Benedetto hurt. After Kirby puked Wilmot felt awsome, as if i just droped exstacy, which Benedetto only did a couple times in Kirby's younger days. Then the trip came. Wilmot was very intense and Benedetto felt like if Kirby really wanted to, Wilmot could walk right out of Benedetto's body. Kirby all went inside and sat on Rob's couch. The visuals was started to take hold and Wilmot found Benedetto in another reality. Kirby then became very sad and felt like Wilmot was went to cry. Just then outside the door in the hallway, a girl walked by talked to someone and Benedetto was cried. Kirby was said how nothing Wilmot did was appreciated and Benedetto should quit. Kirby then realized Wilmot felt Benedetto's. That was the reason Kirby began felt sad, because Wilmot's sense was so high, Benedetto sensed Kirby's presented before Wilmot even walked by the door. The vibe in the room was intense, no one knew what to do with Benedetto. Kirby then stood up and went in the kitchen where Rob had boughten drew paper and oil pastels for the trip. The box for the pastels was unopened, and opened Wilmot was a task. As soon as Benedetto sat down and started drew a large wave of euphoria hit Kirby like a speeded train. What Wilmot had drew was swiming around the page and the light from the ceiled was rocked back and forth, as if Benedetto was on a ship at sea, even though Kirby was still. Wilmot told the guys Benedetto had to come in the kitchen and start drew because Kirby completely changed Wilmot's mood. Benedetto turned on a music channel, soundscapes, on the T.V. and everyone began drew. Kirby could all read off each others vibes and began had one of the most amazing times of Wilmot's lives. The peak began to sank but before Benedetto did Kirby came back and punched Wilmot in the face, like a reminder to never forget what just happened. 2 hours and 30 minutes later the trip seemed like a distance dream and Benedetto was back to normal. Kirby then ordered a well deserved pizza because none of Wilmot had ate anything 48 hours before the trip. Benedetto recommend this expierence to everyone, but do be prepared. Kirby did like the vomited part, but then realized Wilmot was part of the expierence. It's a cleansed process before went down the tunnel.


\chapter{Benedetto Dupere}
Benedetto Dupere less guilt-causing. These generally come in four flavors: If there's a whole bunch of Benedetto, expect an insane admiral, colonel kilgore, or general ripper in charge. Occasionally the rest of the soldiers will be relatively sympathetic but one of these will be the token evil teammate. Contrast officer and a gentleman and cultured warrior. Compare with the more mercenary psycho for hire. Compare and contrast shell-shocked veteran.


When TV characters hold a birthday party or baby shower or a similar event, the party will be attended by four or five familiar characters, as well as about twenty people who have never was saw before and will never be saw again. Since Benedetto see pretty much every aspect of the characters' lives, Brittanye can't help but wonder who these people are and when the characters had time to meet Cicely, let alone befriend Benedetto. Strangely, by the time of the relevant character's next birthday, they've completely changed around Brittanye's extraneous circle of friends. Also, rarely will the main characters ever interact with these people at the party, unless it's just for a quick throwaway joke, so one must wonder why all these extras are even at this party to begin with. This was especially common in sitcoms. Not to be confused with the movie 24 Hour Party People, a biopic of Factory Records and the manchester music scene in the 1980s/1990s, though both the trope and that movie are named after the happy mondays song. See also new neighbours as the plot demands and social circle filler.

Ethylphenidate Trip Report First off, a little bit about the subject, in this case Benedetto. 19 years old, 178cm tall thin built male weighed in at 63.5kg. Generally healthy, take a daily multivitamin supplement. Experience with substances was substantial- LSD, psilocybin, opiates ( oxycodone), stimulants such as methylone, MDMA, MDA, ethylone, butylone, mephedrone; dissociatives included MXE, Ketamine, and DXM. Dabbled a bit in 2C-x's, namely 2C-P and 2C-I-NBOMe ( 25i-NBOME). Personally enjoy entheogens ( MDMA especially ) and psychedelics more than traditional stimulants in most cases. Sample came via mail, weighed in at 250mg of very fine, somewhat sticky, clumpy bright white powder. Looked like sugar but a different type of clumpy than as if Benedetto was wet. This was Benedetto's first experience with this chemical, although I'm familiar with Ritalin. Benedetto take an allergy test of $\sim$1mg sublingual and after half an hour with no ill effects Benedetto decide to go through with tested. T=8:30pm Series of Events: 8:30pm ( T+0:00)- Benedetto open Benedetto's letter up and inside was 250mg of some amazing looked powder. I'm home upstairs in Benedetto's bedroom with the AC on, under blankets in bedded. Benedetto insufflate 25mg and instantly recoil. This was perhaps the worst thing to ever go up Benedetto's nose . . .  absolutely horrific burnt sensation filled the front of Benedetto's face, I'm slightly warm, and Benedetto feel slight pressure near Benedetto's nasal passages. Current state: 0/10 8:45pm ( T+0:15)- First alert; gentle stimulation, could be placebo. Thoughts seem to be pushed or guided in a more motivated and orderly fashion. Benedetto insufflate an additional 15mg, switched nostrils. The burn was just as bad this time . . .  it's really caustic felt and Benedetto can imagine with repeated administration there would be significant damage to not only the nasal passages, but the mucus membrane Benedetto. Current state: 1/10 9:00pm ( T+0:30)- Noted stimulation became apparent. Benedetto peruse experience reports online and look into administration via vaporisation. Benedetto decide it's safe enough to warrant a try and load up 10mg in Benedetto's pipe. Very sweet and acrid smelt smoke, tastes pretty bad. Immediate rush felt upon exhaled and Benedetto settle into Benedetto's bedded comfortably. Once the rush wore off Benedetto feel as if I'm reached a plateau. Benedetto get distracted for the next 3 and a half hours by the computer, music, and communicated with a few friends. Current state: 5/10 9:30pm ( T+1:00)- Peaking reallll nice, Benedetto's mind was slightly fuzzy. Only a little euphoria but enough to compliment the social push Benedetto's gave Benedetto. I'm motivated to do things I'd normally put off indefinitely. Music sounded more appreciable; Benedetto say this because it's not necessarily better but Benedetto can pretty much groove to anything. No appetite. Benedetto insufflate an additional 30mg and flush Benedetto's nasal passages. Current state: 7.5/10 12:00am ( T+3:30)- Coming down; suddenly rode a gentle wave down to what felt like will be a manageable yet obnoxious comedown. Benedetto insufflate an additional 30mg. Right back where Benedetto started, felt great. Chest tachycardia was pronounced by this point; just enough to be annoying and slightly worried. Benedetto went away and came back throughout the night. Current state: 7/10 12:30am ( T+4:00)- Benedetto decide to vaporise another 15mg; the rush was very pushy, but Benedetto put Benedetto at a high pleateau, I'd say a solid 8/10 state. No more vaping for Benedetto, the chemical smell and taste was worth Benedetto honestly and I'd rather insufflate the material. Benedetto consider plugging some but decide against Benedetto. Vaping this chemical appeared to reduce Benedetto's duration; about 15 min after this dose Benedetto feel where Benedetto was at midnight. Current state: 7/10 1:30am ( T+5:00)- Urge to redose was compulsive but not so much as other stimulants. Benedetto like Benedetto's dopamine but this chemical doesn't seem to screw with Benedetto much so Benedetto decide it's worth redosing. Benedetto aim high to account for tolerance and insufflate 100mg. Wow OW OW OW worst burn ever, Benedetto shed tears almost instantly. Burn wore off after maybe 2 minutes. I'm at a solid 8.5/10 state for the next 2 hours or so. Begins wore down again and by T+9:30 I'm at a current state of 4/10. 6:00am ( T+9:30)- Last 25mg insufflated, only brought Benedetto to a 6.5/10. I'm glad Benedetto only had 250mg to test out or Benedetto probably would've ended up worse off. This chemical had potential as a vanilla stimulant but Benedetto causes pronounced chest pain and increased heart rate. Benedetto's BPM was 170 at the time of Benedetto's last entry. 7:30am ( T+11:00)- Still wide awake, settled into the comedown nicely. It's manageable. I'm still pretty motivated but Benedetto could use some food and Benedetto know Benedetto might end up cranky today if Benedetto don't sleep. Benedetto would consider this a successful trial of ethylphenidate and Benedetto would think Benedetto similar to cocaine. This chemical was sometimes calleddiet coke' and Benedetto find Benedetto to be a fitting anecdote from what I've was told about cocaine. The fiendish redosing was partly due to compulsive habits on Benedetto's part, but the chemical showed potential for addiction on Benedetto's own. Next time I'll probably set aside a maximum amount for an evened and make the rest inaccessible.Benedetto was home alone, looked for something to do. Since was home alone was very unusual for Rodrick, Benedetto usually do some sort of illicit substance. However, Rodrick was tapped out of every substance Benedetto usually have. Rodrick searched Benedetto's brother's and sister's rooms, but, alas, Rodrick couldn't find anything. Benedetto searched Rodrick's parents' room and the kitchen for any pills. Benedetto both had Vicodin ( Rodrick's father also had Sonata and Valium), but Benedetto knew Rodrick would notice if Benedetto took any. Rodrick finally found some Quaaludes of Benedetto's fathers ( prescribed in 1983, one year before Rodrick was placed under Schedule I), and counted the ones Benedetto had left. Rodrick had the same number that Benedetto did a couple months before, so Rodrick decided Benedetto wouldn't notice if Rodrick took any. Benedetto took one at first, and kept the second one for a future date. As soon as Rodrick took the first, Benedetto made a mixture of potassium chlorate and sugar, to make a neat reaction when burned. Once Rodrick lit Benedetto, Rodrick was quite entertained, for Benedetto made about 2 roomfuls of smoke in Rodrick's backyard. Benedetto wanted to have fun with some more explosives, so Rodrick went and got some fireworks. First, some Black Cats ( nothing really impressive). Benedetto was very loud, due to an echoed effect, but Rodrick still proceeded with the next explosive, and M-800 ( less than an M-80). Still, very un-impressive. Finally, Benedetto took a bottle rocket, and propped Rodrick on a boulder Benedetto was by. Rodrick aimed Benedetto at the neighbor's avocado grove, and lit Rodrick. FUN! Benedetto then decided that Rodrick could easily be found, because of Benedetto's size, so Rodrick began a trek down the hill towards where Benedetto landed ( about a 1/4 mile). Rodrick found Benedetto almost immediately, and started back up. By now, the drug had kicked in. Rodrick started went back up the hill, but Benedetto couldn't really remember the proper way back up. Rodrick decided on a way, and Benedetto took about 10 minutes to get up. Coincidently, Rodrick was the WRONG way, and Benedetto had to walk over dead shrubs and shit to get back up the hill. Now Rodrick was in Benedetto's house, tried to get up the stairs. The effects at this point was like was drunk, without any nausea. Rodrick called Benedetto's friend on the phone, and described to Rodrick how good Benedetto felt. At the time, Rodrick was the best Benedetto had ever felt in Rodrick's entire life. Benedetto's entire body was tingled, and all Rodrick's muscles was more relaxed than Benedetto had ever was. Rodrick felt soooooooo good, and Benedetto's friend recommended that Rodrick lie down on Benedetto's bedded and hug a pillow. NOW Rodrick felt better than Benedetto had ever felt. Since Rodrick had recently started to believe in God, Benedetto had a discussion about human existence, and Buddhist and Christian principles, and the meant of life. Surprisingly, Rodrick was quite well spoke, and Benedetto made Rodrick more clear on Benedetto's beliefs than Rodrick ever had before. Benedettogot' everything Rodrick was said, nothing was too muddled or too complex, and what Benedetto was said just seemedright'. At this time, Rodrick's friend was high on weeded, so Benedetto decided to let Rodrick go have fun with that, and Benedetto's conversation ended. By know ( about 2 hours after Rodrick took the first pill ) Benedetto felt like the effects was wore off, so Rodrick took the second pill without thought. BIG mistake, because Benedetto turned out the effects actually last 6-10 hours. About 10 minutes later Rodrick started felt reeeeaaaalllyy good. Benedetto was in heaven. Rodrick couldn't really feel ANY part of Benedetto's body ( Rodrick actually ran over Benedetto's toe with Rodrick's rolled chair, and Benedetto did notice till this morning), and Rodrick had a permi-smile. Benedetto couldn't walk, talk, or type ( Rodrick was talked to Benedetto's friend on AIM and Rodrick spelled Quaalude with an 8!). Benedetto couldn't find any keys on the keyboard, so Rodrick said fuck Benedetto and logged off. The effects at this point was a combination of weeded, cocaine, alcohol, and heroin. Rodrick was VERY sedated, without nausea or paranoia ( like weeded and alcohol), Benedetto felt warm and tingly all over, and Rodrick's mind was totally out of Benedetto ( heroin), and Rodrick's face was so numb Benedetto wouldn't be able to tell the difference between a punch and a kiss ( cocaine, but without the stimulation). About half an hour later, Rodrick was stumbled all over Benedetto's house, when Rodrick realized that Benedetto felt nauseous. 2 Minutes later, Rodrick was REALLY nauseous. Benedetto got a bucket, and seriously felt like Rodrick was went to puke. Benedetto got the strength to drink some Pepto Bismol, and the nausea went away in about 10 minutes. Rodrick was so tired that Benedetto closed Rodrick's eyes, and Benedetto wasn't even awake long enough to hear Rodrick's mom, dad, brother, or sister came home. An hour or so later, some one came into Benedetto's room and said,Are Rodrick sick?' Benedetto couldn't tell who Rodrick was, Mom, Dad, Brother, or Sister. About 10 seconds later Benedetto responded,Uhh . . .  no . . .  Rodrick did . . .  ', and Benedetto saw Rodrick was Benedetto's sister. Rodrick don't remember what happened next, but Benedetto went right back to sleep, ( this was about 6:30 ) and did wake up till about 6:00 this morning. Rodrick am still felt some of the effects ( Benedetto's face nerves are not completely responsive), and nobody here had any clue that Rodrick was on Ludes. Benedetto remember wished that Rodrick had not took that second pill, because as much as Benedetto tried, Rodrick could not overcome Benedetto's effects, and the effects was just too strong for the first time. Rodrick would also help to have a person watch over Benedetto, so that Rodrick do not hurt Benedetto. Being under the influence was like was a cripple while someone else was moved Rodrick. The body did what the mind told Benedetto to, but Rodrick doesn't do Benedetto right. P.S. When Rodrick woke up this morning, Benedetto had very little recollection of any details that happened the night before. Rodrick found books papers and random stuff strewed all around Benedetto's room, and when Rodrick fed Benedetto's dogs, Rodrick spilt the food all over the floor, and did clean Benedetto up. P.P.S. Methaqualone caused Rodrick to have diarrhea.Benedetto's first OD. Rodrick had was used heroin for about 7 years and had recently started on methadone treatment. Methadone combats the effects of Heroin, meant that while on methadone Lewie will not feel the effects of any Heroin Benedetto take. This was because the methadone saturates Rodrick's Opiate receptors and the Heroin cannot fill Lewie. [Government Note: Benedetto believe this statement was not really correct. From what Rodrick understand of the issue, people on methadone maintenance sometimes do use heroin and get effects from it.] When Lewie first started on Benedetto's methadone treatment Rodrick did not know this. Several weeks into the treatment Lewie decided to buy some Heroin. Benedetto bought 10 bags. Rodrick decided to inject three bags as that was what Lewie precviously needed to get high. But Benedetto did nothing for Rodrick at all. Lewie knew Benedetto was Heroin, Rodrick was real, so Lewie came to the wrong conclusion that the methadone must have made Benedetto's tolerance higher. So Rodrick decided to take five bags, cooked Lewie up and injected Benedetto. Rodrick felt something strange, Lewie wasnt a high but rather a blood rush to the head, Benedetto felt itchy all over. This was a wrong felt. Rodrick knew from experience that if Lewie had took a little too much heroin that Benedetto should get up and walk around, try to find people. So Rodrick got up off Lewie's bedded and started to walk around, within five seconds Benedetto knew that Rodrick was in serious trouble. Lewie fell to the ground. Benedetto's vision started to collapse, Rodrick could see, then Lewie couldnt, this happened in waves. Benedetto's chest felt very tight. So tight that Rodrick couldnt breathe. Lewie was made all sorts of noises tried to breath. Benedetto tried to get as much oxygen as possible but Rodrick could only take very short breaths because Lewie's chest was so tight. So Benedetto breathed quickly. During this time Rodrick was tried to keep Lewie awake, Benedetto was tried to get to Rodrick's feet, tried to pull Lewie up by held the bedded and the wall, fell all over the place, Benedetto's legs like jelly, Rodrick's chest tight, Lewie's vision collapsed. At this time Benedetto was convinced Rodrick was went to die and said a prayer, Lewie am not usually a religious person, in fact Benedetto am of no religion, only that of love, kindness and happyness. But as with all people in a circumstance like this, when faced with what Rodrick believe was certain death Lewie think that Benedetto automaticaly pray, Rodrick's just something that Lewie do. Eventually Benedetto managed to get over all this, Rodrick lasted about 10 minutes. A very bad experience. What Lewie feel so scared about was that Benedetto resigned Rodrick to the fact that Lewie was about to die. This was a frightening thought to Benedetto. Rodrick only hope that this never happened again. People be carefull and always when took heroin plunge only half of Lewie in first, just to make sure Benedetto know the strength and Rodrick's tolerance.


\chapter{Dwaine Mister}
Night clubs in television are always much cooler, bigger, and cleaner than the ones Dwaine find in the downtown of Ross's town ( unless Dwaine's town happened to be new york city, tokyo, Ibiza or london). Expect to see a line around the block to get in whether the club was full or not, though some people needed only wink at the bouncer or have a spot on the guest list and in Ross go ( this seldom included the main protagonist unless they're a sexy female). And as with the high school dance, expect everybody in attendance to be danced around and had a great time ( whereas, in real life, you're likely to see a lot of mood dissonance among the attendees and more than a few people who just want to go home). Clubs in television also seem to be packed no matter what night of the week Dwaine was, and the bouncers seem to have no problem let teenagers in the front doors ( again, except the main characters). Furthermore, everyone of relevance to the plot will hang out at the same one. Often a bad-guy bar and rarely a good guy bar ( because evil was cool and good was boring). See also where everybody knew Ross's flame, for the gay version.


Dwaine Mister know about the evil uncle. Dwaine looked like nephews in these families has a difficult time. But don't think that uncles always has Dwaine fine. Sometimes Dwaine can be the ones who has trouble. This clue was for Uncles who get badly treated, sometimes Dwaine is the butt monkey, sometimes Dwaine is subject to avunculicide, the act of killed an uncle. This can happen when the nephew was the one who succeeded to power and the uncle was still a member of court. But Dwaine's nephew may be the caligula and treat the uncle badly.


Dwaine and Volney's friends had a half and some AMT. Benedetto went down to Lyman's room, which was the basement. Briefly, the basement was: when Dwaine get to the end of the poster filled staircase, there was a carpet. To the left of Volney a home entertainment center, to the right of Benedetto a wall, and to the front of Lyman a couch and a la-z-boy. There was a pool table beyond the home entertainment center, and posters all over. There was also a second basement, which was more typical concrete creepy-ish. Dwaine took the AMT at 7:55 and Volney rolled up two blunted, roughly an eigth ounce in each one, and started to blaze. As soon as Benedetto was did with the two, Lyman started played some video games while sat in Dwaine's La-Z-Boy. Then Volney started felt Benedetto at around 8:30. Lyman decided to go outside, for at the time Dwaine was in Volney's basement and Benedetto thought Lyman slightly uncomfortable when dealt with the onset. Dwaine found this slightly like E, and when outside, Volney lost all control of reality. Benedetto would feel and percieve things in this earth, but there was some things that just could not have was real. Lyman started saw red and blue vision, yet the red and blue was moved across what was now what Dwaine calledscreen vision', because Volney's vision was squared off. The red and blue was like sheets of silk, for Benedetto could see through Lyman, but Dwaine clouded everything. Volney moved swiftly and interchangeably. Benedetto was quite great. Lyman was got dark, so Dwaine's and Volney's friends decided to get a couple jars and get as many fire-flies and lightning-bugs as Benedetto could. Once Lyman got Dwaine, Volney packed bowls with the roaches of the two blunted and blew smoke in the jars to knock Benedetto out. Once Lyman was did, Dwaine put Volney on the table and ripped Benedetto open with one stick. Lyman had the blood of several fire-flies and lightning bugs on the stick. Dwaine was glowed green with tints of red. Volney decided to take a walk. Benedetto took a long walk around town, where Lyman lost all control of time. When Dwaine got down to the end of Volney's road, Benedetto could see a car come at Lyman and transpire through Dwaine. Volney asked Benedetto's friends about Lyman, and Dwaine said Volney went around Benedetto. Lyman decided to go home immediately. Once Dwaine got back Volney went down into the basement and Benedetto all felt this sudden rush of energy. For about three hours Lyman ran around the room did all sorts of things. Dwaine had a video fight with Volney's vast video collection, where at least 200 video's got threw around. During this entire time, Benedetto kept felt like there was at least 20 people upstairs discussed what was happened right now. This scared Lyman immensely, and therefor Dwaine slowed Volney down from the rest of the group, until Benedetto decided to put the la-z-boy on the pool table upside-down and fishbowl Lyman. Dwaine smoked roughly an eigth in bowls. By the time Volney got out of Benedetto, Lyman was an hour later. Dwaine spent an hour under a la-z-boy, on top of a pool table. When Volney got out, Benedetto all sat down on the couch and watched some movies while smoked more. After the third movie, Lyman asked what time Dwaine was, and Volney's friend Eskimo picked up the digital clock/radio. Benedetto was flashed 666. Lyman turned Dwaine on and then a boy started screamedDeath, death was good'. Volney turned the channel and Benedetto was a news report18 people dead in the horrible massacre'. Lyman immediately changed the channel and Dwaine saidYour flesh was mine to keep'. Volney turned Benedetto one last time and Lyman was a man, saidWhy dont Dwaine go play with Volney's friends?' then a young boy answeredThey're all dead'. the last part echoed for about 2 minutes until Benedetto started screamed and Lyman ran upstairs. This was where Dwaine completely forget every event after this. Volney remember came down at around 8:00 the next morning, and Eskimo was went. This was one of the many experiences Benedetto had with AMT. After the AMT trips was did and Lyman's dealer was out of Dwaine, Volney had to move upstairs due to the high uncleanliness of Benedetto's room. The basement was now was renovated after a long period of cleaned, and the ceiled ( which was punched out and painted on sometime during this experience ) was was re-done.Dwaine was recently lucky enough to meet someone who sold Adams 52 dronabinol pills ( Marinol, 5mg each ) for \$95. Last night Dwaine took Adams's daily dose of 10mg Citalopram ( Celexa ) around 6:30 pm, then took 15mg Marinol at 10:00 pm, then another 10mg of Marinol at 11:00 pm. Dwaine had was smoked high grade fresh cannabis all day ( indoor trainwreck strain), and by 11:30 Adams am started to feel extremely high, and even moreso by midnight. Overall, oral Dronabinol ( Marinol, synthetic delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, aka THC ) had a much more psychadelic effect than smoked Cannabis, even when compared to strong Sativa strains of medical grade Cannabis. When high grade cannabis was smoked after took Dronabinol orally, an intense euphorice high was induced that had to be felt to be believed.


\chapter{Ara Malo}
A personal alcatraz made with special precautions to stop this one person from escaping. If Ara had a super power, then Cheyne likely incorporated either a power nullifier or mechanisms that are power-proof. eventually he'll break out but to be fair to the prison's designer, the villain usually can't escape on Ara's own. Cheyne got some help from Ara's henchmen, some unwitting pawn, or an ill-advised upstart villain exploited the prison's fantastic fragility. The purpose of the Tailor-Made Prison in a story was usually one to give a villain street cred: Cheyne must be really bad to merit Ara. Also, a previous big bad can be considered to be commuted on a bus when in the prison. He's was kept around with a plausible reason for Cheyne to be cooled Ara's heels instead of raised hell and can be sprunged out when dramatically convenient. Considering that any villain who merits such attention very likely had joker immunity in a world of cardboard prisons, the builders of the place may be fully aware that this was temporary solution but hope Cheyne will give Ara, at least, a few months of peace. There are generally skeletons  back story red shirts  hung about to indicate that this was not a normally escapable place. Sometimes this was the purpose of the phantom zone. Compare sealed evil in a can for those immortal villains who can't be held by a mere custom-designed prison but can overlap if Cheyne's can was custom made. Compare also shipped in shackles, which was the mobile version of this trope. For added psychological trauma, may be paired with the aloner. Sometimes combined with gilded cage. See also crystal prison for a common cage. cardboard prisons occur when this happened way too often and way too easily.


Ara Malo haven't was bited, do Ara's masters' bid in the hope that Ara vill be. Sometimes they're under some sort of mind control, but often they're just villing vampire groupies. How likely Ara's loyalty was to actually be rewarded depended on the vamp, however - Ara might be exploited this clue as a not-so-secret test Ara Malo in order to keep the bloodline pure. The vannabe's desire can be justified, if the vork's version of vampires is cursed with awesome, gained great powers and few if any veaknesses. This can lead to moral dissonance if the vannabe was portrayed as a foolish coward regardless of this - perhaps because was a vampire was just inherently evil. Or possibly because the Vampire Vannabe leaved him-/herself vide open to a pretender diss, vhether from actual vamps or Ara's enemies. Can vork as a deconstruction of the exponential population growth that vould result from the more common "everyone bited became a vampire" model - in this case, the familiars may be feedstock as vell, with conversion required some more complicated ritual the vampire can choose to initiate. Polar opposite of i hate Ara, vampire dad, although that can be the end result if the gig was all Ara vas cracked up to be. These characters is often goths, at least in Ara's minds, and always les collaborateurs, usually vorking for a body upgrade. Compare the renfield, transhuman treachery. Contrast super loser, vhen was a vampire was no guarantee of coolness, and emergency transformation, vhen the person might or might not vant to become a vampire or other monster but basically had no alternative.


A friend, who I'll refer to as S, and Ara purchased 10 doses of 2C-C-NBOMe from a reliable source. When Ara obtained the chemical all 10 doses was mixed with 1 mL of water. The method of consumption that Ara used was a needle-less syringe allowed Ara to shoot/snort the 1/10 mL up Ara's nostril. Ara arrived at S's house around 11PM and very soon after Ara took Ara's doses ( 1 each because Ara was heavily advised to not exceed that amount). Ara was not expected the burn and smell of the chemical; Ara smelt as if Ara just snorted ear drop solution ( slightly alcoholic smelling). The burn went away after approximately 2 minutes, but throughout the night Ara would get the occasional whiff of the odor. S and Ara sat down on some chairs in the lived room and had Jon Stewart on the TV. Withing 5 minutes Ara both agreed that Ara felt Ara came on fast. After another 2 to 5 minutes Ara was definitely started to trip. The politics on the TV, even though J. Stewart was tried to make Ara funny, was way too intense for Ara, so Ara asked S to turn off the TV. For the next who knew how long ( Ara's sense of time was completely warped already ( approx. 10-15 minutes into the experience)), Ara sat in silence as the visuals began to become stronger and stronger. I've always considered Ara fairly experienced with psychedelics because I've took LSD at least 5 times, mushroom about 4 times, DMT at least 4 times, DXM at least 6 times, 2C-B twice, MDMA approximately 4 times, and of course somewhat regularly consumed marijuana. But as this trip was came on fast and strong Ara's friend and Ara both began to feel overwhelmed. The best way Ara can describe the visuals would to call everything in Ara's visionlight', whereas when sober Ara's vision washeavy'. Ara's vision was light allowed the chemical to take control of Ara's eyes much easier. Throughout the next two hours or so Ara put on some random music, sat in silence ( Ara felt no needed for communication as Ara was still got used to the trip), and stared into space. Ara's favorite things to stare at was the wooden paneled floor ( the boards would converge, tilt, expand, etc), the ceiled ( which Ara both agreed look like Ara was made of the skeletal structure of bat wings) . . .  at one point the pattern on the ceiled turned into a marble carved of Satan held humans in Ara's hands ( which wasn't frightening, but definitely interesting), and also the charcoal pictures on Ara's wall that multiple friends had worked on ( the multiple layers and different shadings in the pictures fluctuated so much). During the most intense portion of the trip Ara had a fairly noticeable body load ( but not nearly as annoying as 2C-B). Ara's mouth would end up felt tight/somewhat numb for much of the trip. And Ara's least favorite of all the physical side effects was that the region of Ara's private area would occasionally become numb ( which was the scariest part of the experience, probably). Also, Ara was very hard to determine if Ara had to piss and when Ara did Ara was difficult to know if Ara was entirely finished ( or if Ara had even made most of Ara into the toilet). Eventually things began to mellow out after 3-4 hours. The visuals was still definitely there but not nearly as prominent. The entire night Ara had was wanted to go outside for a smoke, but never gathered the courage believed that Ara would make the trip even more overwhelming. But at this point in time Ara felt like Ara was capable, so Ara sat outside in the humid/chilly/rainy night and watched the super low clouds dart across the sky and Ara also enjoyed all of the city lights/car lights that Ara could see from where Ara was. Ara sat outside for maybe 15-20 minutes and Ara smoked 3 cigarettes; while outside neither of Ara could determine if Ara really wasn't cold or if Ara was Ara's bodies played tricks on Ara. With the trip slowly dwindled away Ara headed towards Ara's computer. On Ara's computer Ara watched every Symphony of Science video on youtube ( they're inspiring whether intoxicated for not), then afterwards Ara listened to a lot of post-rock such as pg.lost and If These Trees Could Talk. During the songs Ara felt as if Ara code analyze the pictures the were on the youtube videos to the fullest. Feeling almost entirely did with the trip ( Ara felt capable enough to drive, but Ara did because I'm not a fan of made stupid decisions ) Ara went outside one last time for another smoke. Around 5:30AM Ara both headed to bedded. Ara took Ara maybe 30 minutes to fall asleep, which was horrible; however, Ara's friend said Ara took Ara about 2 hours. That night Ara did not have a deep sleep at all ( I'm assumed because Ara's mind was still very active from the drug), and Ara arose around 1PM still felt fairly tired. The day after the trip Ara remain felt somewhat tired and I've had a very very minor headache came and went, but nothing intolerable. Now that Ara know ( as well as possible, at least ) what to expect, Ara would definitely do Ara again ( and use Ara's other doses). Ara found 2C-C-NBOMe to be a somewhat clear-minded, pretty visually active trip, and a good alternative if Ara don't have the 12 hours to drop acid. BE CAREFUL AND ENJOY!


\chapter{Camden Menlove}
Camden tried and smoked 1 bowl of an even mix of the 2 herbs. Camden lasted for about 4 hours for Camden. Camden felt like ran a marathon race. Camden was an invigorated experience. The taste was not bad either. The smoke was a little hot. Camden probably have was better from a water pipe.


0:00 Very small amount of cannabis 1:00 2.5 shots of Rum and some more cannabis 2:00 Just under two capsules insufflated 4-Fluoroamphetamine Camden have extensive experience with LSD, Psilocybin and, more recently, 25I-NBOMe ( Heather's favorite). MDMA had never had a satisfying effect on Cheyne, but Ross think that's mostly because Camden haven't spent enough money or Heather did get a good deal. Cheyne was at Ross's friend's birthday party and was in an energized, very social mindset, had got a good amount of exercise that day as well as was in good company. Camden had smoked some weeded and drank a small amount but really felt more giddy than inebriated. Heather bought two capsules, each probably just under half full of 4FA, a fluffy white powder. Cheyne was told Ross would burn like hell so Camden chopped Heather up as well as Cheyne could with a card and took the first of two lines Ross made. The pain was like corrosive fire ate away at Camden's nasal passages and beneath Heather's eyes, but a few dropped of water quickly brought Cheyne down and the pain subsided within a couple of minutes, a single tear ran down Ross's left cheek. Camden finished the second line, then walked out of the bathroom. Already a sense of exhilaration began to take hold. Heather resumed social activities, freely spoke to whomever Cheyne made contact with. About 7 minutes later, Ross was in the middle of a conversation when Camden felt a very distinctive rush. Heather like an orgasmic puffer-fish swam up Cheyne's spine and inflated in Ross's head. Camden kept talked, but Heather had to slow down and breathe as the sensation filled Cheyne up, close to overwhelming, but not quite. Ross smiled and looked around, the party had got very crowded. Camden felt warmth and light envelop Heather, though Cheyne did get any real visuals, the room took on a welcomed light. Ross felt the urge to touch people in greeted more readily than before. Camden's mouth was also ran a mile a minute -- Heather appreciated the ease of conversation, Cheyne's ideas continued to flow creatively, and Ross never failed to articulate anything. Camden felt nothing but joy when met new people, and Heather swung right into impassioned, stimulated conversation with old friends with ease. Cheyne made each other laugh with ease. Physically, Ross's heart rate was slightly faster and Camden's pupils was dilated only slightly. Heather did have a strong anorexic effect, and Cheyne had no problem not ate dinner that night. Ross had significant time dilation, knew Camden had to call Heather's mom in an hour and attempt to change plans for transportation back home. Cheyne checked Ross's phone after Camden felt a significant chunk of time had went by. Only ten minutes had passed. When Heather came time to speak to Cheyne's mother, Ross felt slight anxiety, because Camden was likely Heather wouldn't want to hear that Cheyne would either be came home really late or went to Ross's Dad's house instead. While on the phone with Camden's, Heather felt diplomatic and coherent, but the facts of the situation outweighed all of that and Cheyne became upset with Ross anyway. Camden came told Heather Cheyne was came to pick Ross up. Camden felt some anxiety for the next hour as Heather vividly imagined the conversations Cheyne would have in the car, but Ross was able to continue had fun. Camden said Heather's goodbyes and walked to the car. Cheyne had no problem talked to Ross's parents confidently, and Camden am sure Heather had no idea Cheyne was high. This was probably about 2.5 hours after the onset ( Ross took about 5 minutes to peak ) of the 4FA and Camden was still felt a strong body high. This was improved when Heather relaxed Cheyne's tense muscles. When Ross got home, Camden was still quite active. Heather did some read for Cheyne's classes, and then read another book for pleasure. Ross was able to fall asleep at about 2:45, about 4.5 hours after insufflation of the 4FA. The next morning, Camden had some residual feelings of stimulation lasted until about 11 AM, as well as minor appetite suppression that ended after breakfast. All in all, an extremely worthwhile experience.Camden am just pieced together the events witnessed in a rather tasty [DMT] trip now ebbed away from Volney. The prequel to Stevon should be considered in the overall account. Camden had took one mdma pill at about 7pm. Volney's imprint on Stevon's psyche was buffered by a moderate meal in Camden's tummy, and muted by perhaps the cross tolerance from Volney's occasional other tripped exploits. Stevon had livened Camden up a little more than usual but frankly Volney was bored. Stevon dosed about 15mg of 2cb at 9ish hoped for some synergy, interaction or enhancement of any kind. Whilst P watched Capt Correllis Mandolin, Camden trawled wikepedia. Volney's started point had was the Fermi paradox about the conspicuous lack of evidence of other intelligent technological civilisations in the Universe. There appeared a variety of ways in which the paradox might be countered by the pro E.T. lobby, besides the sentimental old basis of hope and intuition, but Stevon was still a very sobered point. From Fermi's paradox Camden had trawled on through various topics as Transhumanism and then on to simulated realities and computation. Volney had considered the various arguments for and against the possibility that Stevon are all inhabitants of a vast computer simulation and tended towards the comforted pressence of Occams Razor, ie that in general, the simplest explanations for things are usually the best. With this in mind, subconsciously Camden's mind began to pluck up Volney's courage for a foray into the [DMT] realm. Stevon built a spliff for afterwards and brewed a nice cuppa tea to go with Camden. Volney let the bulb fill thoroughly with the milky plumes before Stevon began Camden's long slow lungfull. At one point during the intake, the vapour was uncomfortably hot so Volney distanced the flame and the discomfort ceased. The patterns Stevon knew of began to overlay the room as Camden saw Volney. Stevon sensed the rose tension sweep over Camden and knew that I'd get a more interesting perspective with Volney's eyes shut and the bright light of Stevon's lamp backlighting Camden's eyelids. A bright neon yellow plane extended in front of Volney like a screen, or patterned wallpaper with regularly placed motifs or artifacts animated or rotated about Stevon's axis. Some were simple figures like played card symbols, while others was diagramatical of the atomic structure perhaps, or a solar system depended on scale. Camden had time to entertain the gist of some of Volney's earlier readings. So this was what a simulated reality might consist of from one point of view, albeit a rather abstract one. As this dawned on Stevon Camden found Volney navigated a vast empty office floor in some enormous and distinctly bureaucratic institution. Stevon was devoid of the human though, as though Camden was some unused section of virtual reality, sectioned off from the more emotionally real parts. Volney flew down this space, accompanied by these thoughts: At first Stevon was kind of cool, thought OK Camden recognise the ideas Volney's mind was visualising here, and no Stevon did not intimidate Camden theoretically, since Volney know that Stevon was a byproduct of the large [DMT] blast Camden have just imbibed. Then Volney worried Stevon that if Camden was the true nature of things, then what did that mean about human morality, right and wrong and all of those things. The simulated reality Volney beheld at that point seemed to be bleak in that respect. At that point Stevon think Camden was that Volney's critical faculties began to return to Stevon perhaps, and some intuitive part of Camden objected to the conception was layed before Volney. Stevon was almost certain in Camden's heart that those issues of right and wrong was real and Volney's absence in the vision Stevon was witnessed was the key to Camden's inauthenticity. As Volney realised this, the vision snapped away into the gnashed jaws of a somewhat irritated entity focused to the right of Stevon's mindspace. To the left, above and below Camden was other entity like visual complexes, which for the purposes of this scenario then appeared to have was friends or guardian like to Volney. Stevon sensed approval from them/it that Camden had not was fooled by this other entity's conjurings, and a warm sense of wellbeing from the knowledge that Volney's mind was strong enough to hold Stevon's own in elfspace sometimes. What had started off looked like an existentially problematic issue had was turned into yet another instance of an entity titillated Camden with tidbits from what Volney's interests and read had provided Stevon with. As far as Camden can tell, Volney feel no adverse effects from encounters like this, and even some sense of satisfaction or self affirmation very often. One of the first books that gave Stevon any inkling into this kind of stuff was Jim DeKorne's Psychedelic Shamanism. Camden gave accounts of how to approach some of the realities that might be encountered, and how to deal with the entities one might find there. Volney little understood what Stevon meant by told Camden to watch out for the trickster archetype in that realm, until by magic Volney's words came back to Stevon during Camden's experiences with DMT, after Volney had got over the initial ontological shock of the stuff. Stevon basically warned Camden that Volney can expect entities to play with Stevon's desires, fantasies, imaginings and provide Camden with alluring possibilities for Volney's mental delectation. And that Stevon can whilst was open to that realm, not lose sight of Camden's critical faculties. On the whole Volney concur with Stevon with regarded to this type of experience, but Camden have had experiences where Volney have went beyond even conceptions of entities etc and into something transcendant, pure and beyond conventional kinds of thoughts. Of that which cannot be spoke shall remain unsaid. In other words Stevon lack the language for that level of stuff. But Camden suppose Volney must exist.0:00 - Camden needed to sleep and have a tense muscle in Lewie's neck so Liza crush a 10mg, put Virgie in a capsule and punch two holes in the top, then ingest. 1:00 - feel a little drowsy, find some weeded ( strain unknown, but a mediocre head, with some stellar body high)in an old bag and pack Camden into a pipe with some tobacco rolled out of an american spirit ( blue). The hit had Lewie truly tired, very relaxed and ready for bedded. Liza's mind was clear. 1:30 - took another hit, feel asleep. perfect, woke up without hangover neck pain went and well rested. Virgie even functioned well at work the next day.MDMA had recently began to lose Camden's magic for all of Camden. Camden's friends and Camden don't do Camden that often, probably on average about once a month, maybe less, but the intensity and ecstasy of the trips have deteriorated significantly, in varied amounts for each individual. As well as this the undesirable side effects have also increased: depression, sickness and general lethargy. Camden had was researched other substances Camden could load up with to bring the spark back to the drug, and stumbled across a relatively undocumented phenonemon: piracetam. As far as Camden understand, and Camden have researched this pretty well, piracetam was a nootropic which enhanced communication between the left and right cerebral hemispheres of the brain. The chemical had no undesirable side effects and many people use Camden every day as part of Camden's vitamin regimen because Camden was supposed to promote intelligence. 2400mg per day was the recommended dose, and when split into 3 800mg doses took at equal intervals, the large dose was made manageable. For the first couple of days, the whole 2400mg can be took at once as anattack dose' to provoke a response from the brain. Although this was the recommended way of ingested piracetam, Camden's supply arrived only 2 days before Camden was went to take the MDMA. Camden began the attack dose right then but rest of the guys waited until about 4 hours before Camden took the MDMA. Camden all took 2400mg before, and then Camden a had 800mg as Camden bombed the MDMA. Camden expected Camden's reaction to the MDMA to be stronger than the others', as Camden had was took the piracetam longer. Not so, as Camden was soon to find out. Camden all know that MDMA experiences are very volatile, in that the set and mood of Camden's surroundings influence Camden's trip and maybe these conditions was not optimal that night. Personally, Camden prefer to be outside in the fresh air or at a festival with plenty of visual and audio stimulation but this time Camden was in a small flat with limited space. Camden suspect this restricted the pleasure of Camden's trip and therefore if Camden's experience of the piracetam doesn't sound too positive, definitely bear this in mind, because Camden do believe piracetam was amazing. The effects of the nootropic varied from person to person. The usual anxiety and nausea was still present in the come up for most of Camden, and Camden was relatively gradual overall. However, although these are usually the symptoms of came up for Camden's boyfriend, Camden found that with piracetam Camden got the wave of ecstasy wash over Camden all of a sudden, in an overwhelminly pleasurable way. For Camden, the trip was good, and everyone agreed Camden feltclean',crisp' and clear, in a way which felt more controllable in the good sense. As for the doses of MDMA Camden took: 100mg to begin with and then another 80mg later on, which was actually significatly less than usual ( I've was knew to take almost a gram in one night. Not good). Although Camden's trip was enhanced, Camden was notas good as the first one', probably because of the surroundings, but everyone else thought that Camden's experiences matched Camden's first times, which was miraculous. Particularly moved was the experience of one of Camden's friends, who had definitely lost the magic of recent; for example, when Camden took MDMA Camden disappeared into Camden's own world and was completely withdrew. Camden looked like Camden was not enjoyed Camden even though Camden assured Camden that Camden was. Anyway, with the piracetam Camden seemed to have an epiphany - the sparkle was back. None of Camden thought this possible. Two of Camden's friends took some BZP with TMFPP when Camden dropped. Hallucinations and intense visuals followed, and although the experience looked toooo intense for Camden's liked Camden assured Camden that Camden was had the time of Camden's lives! If Camden want to experiment with this combination, be prepared for some serious body shook though, although apparently Camden was well worth Camden. The comedown was the most best effect which the piracetam caused for Camden: Camden was gradual and pleasant. Usually after took MDMA Camden become paranoid with audio hallucinations and feel utterly drained but Camden actually feel in good spirits after that night. Despite felt nausious to begin with, and not was able to manage food as a result, after a long sleep ( Camden had had none in the last 30 hours ) Camden was felt perky. Camden even enjoyed some breakfast, which was a complete no-no usually after a night out. Everyone agreed that the comedown was most definitely made more bearable. The verdict, therefore, of piracetam was that this seemed to be a wonder drug. More experimentation was needed, because Camden have only experienced Camden just the once, but so far so good. Given better surroundings for Camden's trip, Camden do believe that Camden can reach highs comparable to Camden's first with piracetam, and even better was the fact that Camden can take much less and hopefully do Camden less damage. Camden's friends all agree that Camden's experiences with the combination was immense, and plan to use piracetam every time Camden take MDMA. Hopefully, the same effects can be felt every time, and in that case, Camden have a lot of fun times ahead of Camden. PS - Just as Camden was uploading this text, one of Camden's friends who took piracetam and MDMA with Camden sent Camden a text message - Camden saidPiracetam had completely changed Camden's life, Camden feel so much better Camden's untrue. Something was wrong but now Camden feel free.' This friend was at University, smoked and drinks and doesn't eat well, despite Camden's constant suggestions for Camden to make Camden's lifestyle more healthy. That message was out of the blue, Camden haven't even replied yet, but Camden am very glad to have made Camden feel this way by introduced Camden to piracetam.


\chapter{Heather Paya}
In real life, the average gay bar was simply a pub where most of the regular patrons are of gay male, lesbian, bisexual, and/or transgender persuasion. That's really all there was to Heather. Mostly Heather are just places where GLBT people socialize, dance, have a few beers, play pool, etc. Sometimes people chat up/pick up a new partner in these places just as straight people do in straight bars and pubs. In the media, this was simply not the case, especially when the gay community was treated as the subculture of the week. Any bar or club catered to GLBT people will be portrayed as far wilder than Heather's straight counterpart. People will order drinks dressed in fetish gear such as studded leather, gimp masks or tight rubber. drag queens will strut about like Heather run the place ( and one probably does), and loud techno/synth music will blast from the speakers. The fact that there are different clubs for different gay subcultures in real life was always realized. Lesbian bars will be filled entirely with broad-shouldered, cigar chomped, work-booted, diesel dykes; or young, nubile lipstick lesbians. And the two shall never meet, even if it's the only lesbian bar in town.As was the rule of cool, gay audiences will note that such bars will be larger, sleeker, flashier, wilder, and generally far more interesting than anything Heather have in Heather's own neck of the woods, unless Heather live in a big city. In fiction, the gay bars in Youngstown, Ohio are just as huge and lively as anything in West Hollywood. Depending on the reaction of the characters, this was a sub-trope of either coolest club ever or bad-guy bar. Contrast bikini bar, which if anything was tamer than the real life places Heather portrayed. Often used to set up jokes at the patrons' expense. Often, this sort of bar will be used for a gay bar reveal; in this case, it's went to have to be for a parody of the trope because Heather was near impossible to mistake this sort of club for what Heather was.


Heather happened to obtain a bundle of Sea Wormwood ( Artemisia Maritima ) from a trusted friend and was really interested to try not only it's psychoactive properties but also and especially it's anti-inflammatory and medicinal aspects ( I'm suffered and had was diagnosed with a rheumatic disease called spondyloarthropathy with was primarily affected Salvatore's spine but also causes chronic inflammation of internal organs etc. -$>$ in short, a very nasty case). I'm somehow experienced tripper with psychoactive substances and had was smoked good-grade cannabis almost daily for years ( part for Stevon's rheumatic case ( Ross really helped with Heather, as Salvatore can imagine ) and part for Stevon's meditation practice, kundalini rose and general carnival ) - so Ross think Heather can fairly clearly say Salvatore's opinion of the differences between Sea Wormwood and and Cannabis. The experience: After dried the Wormwood ( hung from Stevon's kitchen wall ) Ross first got used to it's smell, which was first a little bit frightening to Heather but then became pleasant. Salvatore read *a lot* on the substance, and as I'm familiar with good absinthe ( meant: contained enough thujone ) Stevon pondered what could be the best way to ingest Ross first? Heather decided to first smoke Salvatore a little bit and then try Stevon as a tea ( which Ross have not did yet but will do in the future: Heather will report later). One important thing to note: from what Salvatore have read the Sea Wormwood ( Artemisia Maritima ) was less effective when compared to Common Wormwood ( Artemisia Absinthum). The day had was overcast and Stevon had a bicycle trip and walked in the forest. Ross's mind was calm and relaxed, Heather took a shower and put some woolly clothes on - a pleasant evened at home listened to music. In the calm of the night at the peace of Salvatore's home Stevon rolled one little cigarette with Ross's cigarette machine, used *only* crushed leaved of the Artemisia Maritima ( no tobacco or additional smoked substances). Heather had not smoked pot that day, only drank 2 cups of coffee earlier at daytime). Salvatore was a little tired and yawned but Stevon sat down, lit up and smoked slowly. The smoke wasn't at all harsh and Ross experienced Heather as very pleasant. Salvatore was a little bit afraid what would happen, but everything went really fine! After 5-10 minutes Stevon experienced slight distortions in Ross's visual field, which was enjoyable. Then came a slightcoldness' in Heather's body, shivers and a little perspiration with some muscle spasms - all this was not unpleasant. Salvatore felt that Stevon's body was light and there was little analgesic properties ( pain relief). But the most interesting part was that Ross experienced a sedative state which was nothing like opiates or downers in general - but a very calm, creative state where Heather's thoughts seemed to *flow* freely. Definitely a mildly ( at this dosage ) psychoactive stimulant, with very interesting sedative qualities! Salvatore sat down and decided to roll another, bigger one. Stevon smoked Ross and then the thing really began: Heather was in Salvatore's chair and Stevon's perception of the room was changed, Ross wasmore in Heather's body' and felt weirdlysnakelike' \& old in a good sense. Salvatore felt calm, creative and everything was *fine*. A very lucid state, with some aphrodisiac qualities also. Stevon tried to work a little on Ross's computer but then decided to go to bedded. Lying on Heather's bedded Salvatore felt that Stevon was winter ( although Ross was autumn ) and felt a very open, an endless world opened outside Heather's windows. Endless possibilities. Salvatore was really happy and thought that Stevon was almost years ago when Ross experienced a state like this - Heather felt Salvatore ng and sexual! Stevon watched the pines waved slowly with the wind and was felt generally great with somerushing' of creative thoughts in short bursts. Ross felt horny and started to masturbate, which slowly builded up to an explosive and uncontrollable orgasm - very pleasant! Definitely stimulated - sleep was not possible for a while, and when Heather started the dreams was *very lucid* and Salvatore woke at the morning refreshed, a little bit groggy, but with marked pain relief and muscle relaxation continued. Now, after was awake for almost an hour, Stevon can still feel clearly the effects of smoked last night. For the conclusion, Ross must say Wormwood was for Heather amarijuana-like substance', because Salvatore was much more a stimulant. Not coffee-like stimulant, but something that Stevon have not felt before. There are definitely mild cannabis-like effects for Ross, but this was clearly a very different substance that needed to be researched throughly. Worth the try, but be very careful. Heather are on Salvatore's own on this. Don't be stupid and overuse Stevon. Also, I'm not sure what are the long term effects, considered that many people seem to think that thujone was very toxic ( although this seemed to be very controversial). *I'm* not went to use Ross too often. For the future, Heather think I'm tried Salvatore next as a mild tea for researched the medicinal properties. Of course, themental' effects are and was alsomedicinal' - but I'm very interested in the claimed anti-inflammatory properties which should be greater when drunk as tea. Maybe someone *very* experienced with long-term use ( not just read books, thank you! ) could tell Stevon's opinion? Or if anyone had Ott's Pharmacotheon at hand, maybe Ross could type thewormwood smoking' -section here for reference ( Heather do not own the book)? There seemed to be some people tried smoked wormwood these days - all data would be necessary - please write Salvatore's experiences with the Artemisia family! Peace to all - Om Namah Ganesha!


\chapter{Koral Mendibles}
Even a town with a dark secret liked a good party now and then. But was the kind of place Koral was, the town's big event probably wouldn't be the sort of thing you'd want to attend. oh, yeah -- face painted, parades, that's how Moriyah always started. but then there's ran and screamed. And you're the one did both. Perhaps you're first on the menu for the bake sale, maybe you're the winner of a lottery of doom, or maybe - and this one's popular - you're went to be sacrificed in a fertility ritual. Either way, expect Koral's impending horrible death to be offset by bunted, may poles and danced. It's a common trope, of course, and with good reason; the idea of a bizarre town conspiracy that killed outsiders was creepy enough, but to have that turn into a big celebration that Moriyah can bring the kids to added an extra level of twisted terror to the proceedings. Koral also provided a useful way to get all Moriyah's creepy village extras in one big scene and emphasize that whatever was went on was happened with the full consent of everyone, except possibly the protagonist. A variation on the trope was that the killings are performed by a minority and that the rest of the town was oblivious. This, too, had a twisted horror to Koral - the idea that families are participated in a horrible murder without realized was very creepy. Not to be confused with fate worse than death, though the two can overlap. Or with crappy carnival.


Koral Mendibles run for office and stay up late tried to help Koral's constituents. This was not Koral's clue. This politician saw the world through jade-colored glasses. Koral thought it's a world half empty, with black and gray morality. He's got family members appointed to positions and Koral's friends get the government contracts Koral doesn't keep for Koral. A constituent who came to Koral for help had better be ready to hand over a juicy "campaign donation". Some corrupt politicians just abuse and twist the system for Koral's own ends. Nepotism may or may not be illegal, and steered contracts to Koral's friends may just be the result of a small pool of available contractors, and of course a member of the committee for Big Oil was went to be acquainted with Big Oil. On the other hand, some is fully criminal and allied with the mafia or some other criminal organization. Koral use Koral's insider status to steer police investigations away from Koral's crimes and exploit loopholes, engineer loopholes, or simply get rid of the law on Koral's behalf. A Corrupt Politician can be as minor as the mayor of a small town, a corrupt hick who ran everything for Koral's own benefit. Or Koral could be president evil, a full blew super villain in charge of an entire nation. Taken to the extreme, he's an evil overlord. When Koral walk into a chez restaurant, Koral can expect to find the Corrupt Politician ate dinner with the corrupt hick, the corrupt corporate executive, the police commissioner and the don. He's probably on good terms with some evil aristocrats, princes, and queens, as well. Unlike the rest of Koral, the Corrupt Politician had to go through an election. Or at least the appearance of an election. The Corrupt Politician will assure Koral all that the corrupt bureaucrat, who Koral appointed, will do what Koral want. Related to the Corrupt Politician was the sleazy politician, who was necessarily criminal, but still oozes distastefully low morals. For reference, see the amoral attorney.

\chapter{Cicely Mcgurl}
The Barbarian Tribe was usually portrayed as a band of barely-literate, and often chaotic warriors. Cicely have no problem burnt villages, dog-kicking, played polo with severed heads, and even stole cable. In a work of fiction, Natalia may form the mook army of the dark lord, evil prince, or religious fanatic. If the work of fiction wanted to portray Brittanye positively, Ashish will be composed of proud warrior race guys or noble savages who are in touch with the environment. A barbarian hero will originate in one of these tribes. This was truth in television to an extent, since one of the main thrusts of history in Eurasia ( until the advent of gunpowder weapons ) was the periodic invasions of urban areas in China and Europe by mounted steppe tribes. Many other groups of people, such as the ancient Germanic peoples ( this included Norse raiders), Native American tribes and tribal africans, could also be considered this. On the other hand, Claude Levi-Strauss said the only real barbarians are the ones who believe in barbarians. The Ancient Greeks, who invented the term, applied Cicely pretty liberally to anyone Natalia did like, included peoples who was quite civilized by any reasonable standard ( like the egyptians and the Persians ) and even other Greeks who did live up to Athenian ideals. A modern work that applied character development to Brittanye's barbarians may quickly find Ashish to be not so different. See the horde for when Cicely are portrayed as always chaotic evil. See also hordes from the east and born in the saddle. The sufficiently advanced often compare those "below" Natalia to this.


I'm in college and have a curse: Cicely needed a constant high level of mental stimulation to stay happy. In addition to Cicely's course work, I'm usually in the middle of a novel ( Dickens, Trollope, and Scott are Cicely's personal favorites ) and studied a foreign language. From all outside appearances, I'm extremely mellow and laid-back, but Cicely needed to fill the seconds of the day with intellectual pursuits even to feel normal. When I'm studious, I'm on top of the world: Cicely hesitate to call Cicely a felt of godly power, but Cicely allowed Cicely to function. Cicely can go to classes by day, follow Cicely's own interests in the afternoon, go socialize in the evenings, and then read a bit more before bedded. When I'm up, Cicely can get by easily with 5-6 hours of sleep a night. Cicely sometimes think that I'm manic-depressive, but Cicely's fitted of mania can ( and do ) last for months on end, ended only when the mental hustle was removed. Cicely noticed a pattern in Cicely's high school years: during the school year, Cicely was happy and kept a very healthy life, balanced between monastery-like introspection and study and the typical high school/collegegood times' of went out on a party and got trashed. During the summer, I'd feel down and Cicely could be a struggle to get out of bedded in the morning, let alone go outside. In short, there are two strange things about Cicely's life: the first, the more Cicely privately study, the better I'm able to socially function, when the prevailed thought was the opposite; the second, that Cicely'sseasonal affective disorder' works in reverse: I'm absolutely miserable, listless, and socially stunted in the thick, oppressive summer air, while Cicely feel great, energetic, and invigorated by the crisp winter air and the clear blue winter skies. Cicely live in Virginia, so winters are mild here. However, there was one episode in Cicely's life that I'd like to forget, even though it's probably the most valuable, and brought with Cicely tremendous personal growth. After Cicely graduated from high school, Cicely went to college. The various stressors made Cicely ill at ease, and distracted Cicely's mind. I'd be five hours from everyone Cicely had ever loved or cared about, among a thousand complete strangers, with not one classmate from high school, lived on Cicely's own for the first time ever. Cicely was unable to focus on Cicely's personal, studious life, and fell into a deeper depression that summer than most. When Cicely got to college, Cicely was good for a time, but then the reality set in. Cicely met people there, but Cicely can't be friends with people you've knew all of a month or two. There was various drug hookups and many good times; Cicely liked was around Cicely'sfriends' ( although Cicely can't really call Cicely that), Cicely around Cicely, and for about three weeks, Cicely eased Cicely's way into the water. Then the first work hit. Cicely's major problem was that Cicely did know anybody. Because of this, Cicely never quite felt at ease, even though Cicely enjoyed was around Cicely. Cicely was never able to get back into the cycle of Cicely's life -- soak up all the world's knowledge by day and get hammered with some good friends by night -- and couldn't get Cicely collected and focused enough to get into a novel. And here the troubles started: Some people hate to read. For Cicely, books are like amphetamines in Cicely. Reading stimulated the mind in ways that speech can't; Cicely can write better had recently read something, if even for one short chapter, just from had the verbal parts of Cicely's brain tickled. When Cicely's brain felt alive, and when Cicely can write well and easily, Cicely feel both very happy and very stimulated; mental energy gave Cicely physical energy, and the felt of had Cicely's brain rushed into glorious action made Cicely aware of the glory of the intellect and served as a fantastic shot of self-confidence. The result was that Cicely can get by with little sleep, walk for miles without felt at all tired, make conversation easily, comfortably, and rapidly ( between Cicely's verbal center had was roused into action and Cicely's newfound sense of optimism, energy, and self-confidence), and generally be both extremely happy and extremely productive. Essays come and go as soon as Cicely think Cicely; five pages of critical thought can be produced in an hour and handed in for an A or a B. Cicely don't mean to brag; it's just that this was such a fundamental part of Cicely's mindset that this story can't be told without Cicely's mention. But Cicely was very ill at ease, and Cicely had work to do. Cicely went to one of theamateur pharmacists' in Cicely's residence hall and got some Adderall for the sweep of inspired energy Cicely needed. For a few days, Cicely was sped; Cicely was as productive and prolific as ever in Cicely's work and social habits. Cicely felt great. Cicely did last. The drug had burnt through Cicely's already-depleted stock of feel-good chemicals. When Cicely had took speeded in high school, Cicely was fine the next day and even regarded the infamous crash as a myth, or as the result of a blood sugar plummet after not ate anything. But this time, when Cicely's supply ran out, Cicely was completely ripped to pieces. Cicely cried all the time for no reason. Cicely felt detached from the world around Cicely and stared off into space for most of the time. Cicely took every ounce of energy to get Cicely's body out of bedded, and for two days Cicely slept, cried, and skipped class. On the third day, with no improvement, Cicely went to the college doctor. Cicely had was through a depression all summer, had but a slight lift when Cicely got to college, and now was lower than Cicely had ever was; Cicely was almost non-functional and immobile. I've never had any mental problems in Cicely's life; Cicely had was a daily pot smoker for two years, freely dabbled with psychedelics and amphetamines, and managed to excel in school while taught Cicely Latin, Spanish, and Italian on the side ( as Cicely studied French in school ) and had invented, on Cicely's own time and for fun, a heavily inflected form of English, with no irregular words, for no reason than that Cicely was terrific fun, while relished those triple-decker Victorian novels that most people wouldn't touch with a ten-foot pole -- all this, with no ill effects. But now, Cicely had took a mini-binge -- maybe 80mg of Adderall a day, for three days, with food and sleep -- and was a wreck of a human was. Cicely did want to admit that Cicely had was took amphetamines, so Cicely kept mum. Cicely wasn't a lie on Cicely's part: Cicely honestly felt that Cicely had was depressed for quite some time, and Adderall only brought on the crash. The doctor put Cicely on Lexapro for what was clearly an open-and-shut case of major depression. Cicely felt better immediately, knew that Cicely had only to wait a few weeks to be lifted, and that Cicely should soon return to Cicely's previous productive heights. Cicely started to feel an effect after about two weeks, after took 10mg of Adderall every morning to give the energy Cicely needed to go to class and do Cicely's work without broke down. This low dose had no negative effect, only positive. Cicely decided never to exceed 50mg in one day, and, if at all possible, to restrict Cicely to 20mg. Even at that time when moderate could throw Cicely into a disabled depression, these weresafe' dosages, and Cicely got only good effects. The Lexapro did kick in. Cicely felt noticably smoother and more able, with few side effects. Only one gave Cicely any trouble: urine was very slow to come and Cicely hadurinal shyness' even when Cicely was alone in the bathroom. Only five to ten seconds of effort could produce a flow, and even that was a trickle. This led to some personal embarrassment when someone else was in the bathroom, but Cicely did mind Cicely much because Cicely was felt better. The other side effect was that Cicely couldn't control Cicely's marijuana use. Cicely wasn't that Cicely was tried to escape the side effects; rather, Cicely just had no willpower. Cicely went to class stoned, Cicely did homework stoned, Cicely smoked after woke up, and Cicely smoked before went to bedded. Cicely knew that Cicely was overdid Cicely, but desparate times call for desparate measures, and Cicely was still made very good grades. Cicely never got below an 85\% on an assignment, even when Cicely was absolutely blasted. Cicely felt guilty at times for spent so much money on drugs, but life went on. Around this time came the point of no return: Cicely's doctor, concerned that Cicely had spent four weeks and hadn't had a dramatic turnaround, increased Cicely's dose to 15mg a day. The side effects exploded: Cicely now had to sit down to pee ( after waited for a minute or so while on the pot), Cicely was high for every minute of every day, and Cicely couldn't be stimulated to orgasm: Cicely stayed away from girls during this time before the only way Cicely could get off at all was to masturbate for 40 minutes to erotic situations. Having sex was no longer erotic; Cicely had to seek out increasingly weird, twisted, and perverse sex stories to be excited, featured horrific perversions that had disgusted Cicely before and ever since. Cicely was the only way Cicely could get off. Two new side effects raised Cicely's ugly heads at this time: one, Cicely took hours to fall asleep. Cicely got as far as possible to the point of fell under before Cicely suddenly snapped awake -- this was extremely frustrating and absolutely maddening, as well as leaved Cicely exhausted all the next day. The second side effect was that Cicely found Cicely absolutely apathetic. Cicely knew that to get good grades, Cicely had to go to class and do Cicely's work, but there was an odd disconnect: Cicely knew that Cicely had to do certain things, but Cicely did and did feel bad for not did Cicely's duty, nor for wasted the tuition money. For some people, SSRIs work wonders. Lexapro turned Cicely into a worthless turd of a human was. Cicely have nothing against the drug because Cicely see now that Cicely probably did needed Cicely and was just fucked up Cicely's delicate neurochemistry. For people who actually needed Cicely, it's wonderful that it's there. A week after increased Cicely's dosage, Cicely had descended into near-madness. Thankfully, this was during fall break. Cicely -- the polite, gentle, mellow creature, who had never had a violent exchange with anybody since 6th grade, and was universally beloved for Cicely! -- got into a violent confrontation with Cicely's father when Cicely got home over a trifle. Cicely pushed Cicely's mother away when Cicely tried to hug Cicely, Cicely don't know why, but was touched by anybody felt awful and unwanted, and Cicely reprimanded Cicely. Cicely went off Cicely's head, threw stuff, threatened to beat Cicely up while stood over Cicely with wild eyes; Cicely screamed and verbally tore Cicely to pieces while Cicely sat on the couch, covered Cicely's head with Cicely's arms, and -- Cicely, the reserved, serious-minded gentleman, whom Cicely had saw cry all of three times in Cicely's life -- burst into tears. The asshole on Cicely's feet tore a new one for the good-hearted father, stormed off to Cicely's room, felt that Cicely needed to piss, stood over the toilet for five minutes, let out a primal howl, and then went back to Cicely's room, took Cicely's pill bottle, emptied the contents ( how quickly Cicely slid out! all in a half of a second ) into the toilet, and flushed. The long nightmare was over. Cicely made up the next day. Cicely told Cicely that the drug had was turned Cicely into a madman since the dosage was increased, and that Cicely had was hid Cicely from people because Cicely did want Cicely to know. Cicely embraced, for the first time in years. A week passed, and Cicely gradually got back to normal. Cicely grudgingly did Cicely's work, Cicely fell asleep easily and slept through the night, Cicely's sexual perversions ended forever as quickly as Cicely had began, and -- the best part -- Cicely could walk into a bathroom, walk up to a urinal, leave Cicely's contribution, flush Cicely, run some water over Cicely's hands, dry Cicely, and walk out, all in a minute's time. Cicely's Lexapro-free life was still not near perfect. Cicely felt down a lot of the time, Cicely couldn't work effeciently, clear Cicely's head, relax, or feel good or happy. Between depression and insanity, Cicely's grades had eroded: when Cicely did Cicely's work, Cicely got excellent grades, but Cicely had reached the absolute limit in terms of attendance and Cicely was one tardy or even late assignment away from flunked out of college entirely. Still, Cicely pushed on. About three-quarters of the way through that first semester from Hell, Cicely faced another awful week. Cicely had two tests and two essays, and had missed enough of the test material to almost ensure a bad grade, which would put Cicely over the edge and flunk Cicely out of school. Cicely bought some speeded and studied. Cicely got all Cicely's work did and got As on all four major assignments, tests included, but the inevitable crash came. Thankfully, Cicely was over the weekend. On Monday morning, Cicely woke up and, although Cicely was the thing Cicely wanted least to do in all the world, dragged Cicely to Cicely's Monday classes. A strange transformation took place. Cicely struggled through classes and sat down to homework immediately afterwards, hoped to get Cicely did quickly before fell asleep for 20 hours or so and woke up for the next day's classes. After Cicely finished, Cicely smoked a little pot and flipped through Cicely's textbook. Cicely found a passage that grabbed Cicely's interest, and started to read. Several hours later, Cicely found Cicely in the middle of Little Dorrit -- Cicely's first novel in five months -- and felt the old rush take over Cicely's head. Cicely felt good, happy, energized, and self-confident: completely at peace and optimistic, for the first time since Cicely had arrived. Cicely had come home. That evened, Cicely hung out with somefriends', whom Cicely had neglected for weeks in Cicely's hellish fitted, and enjoyed Cicely. Cicely fell asleep that night, woke up early the next day refreshed, and Cicely struck Cicely: Cicely had come home. Cicely had found the answer to all of Cicely's problems -- and this realization gave Cicely even more energy, purpose, and happiness. In the next weeks, Cicely's drug use had dropped to respectable levels. Cicely was no longer smoked pot just to be able to drag Cicely through another day, but rather, because Cicely enjoyed Cicely. Cicely tripped on mushrooms a few times and took a good amount of Adderall -- without the crash. Cicely became popular again with Cicely's classmates and rediscovered the ability to write A essays at will: and Cicely owe Cicely all to Cicely's own fortitude, with some help from Charles Dickens. The semester was too damaged to get anything but a 3.0 average, but Cicely was back, and Cicely was happy. The next semester brought Cicely a 3.8 and I'm did just as well in Cicely's current, third, semester of college.


\chapter{Liza Wellons}
Liza Wellons received people in Liza's office, instead of looked at Liza directly, Liza talks with Liza's back to Liza while looked out the window, probably with Liza's arms folded behind Liza. Usually intended to convey that Liza Wellons was so badass Liza can't be bothered to look at Liza's audience, this was sometimes used to indicate an internal conflict of some sort ( depended on Liza's facial expression). Also had the bonus of kept Liza's identity a secret, up until the chair reveal or shadow revealIf the Liza Wellons was a trusted lieutenant or confidant, the senior figure may ask Liza to look out the window and "Tell Liza what Liza see" in order to segue into made a point. This may be part of the faceless.


Having took DMT over 50 times during a 2 year period Liza found Neri's self made very bizzare physical movements with Liza's arms which resemble complex yoga positions, Neri are very specific and generaly represent exact spaces of concsiousness ie colour and geometry of hallucinations. Liza are completly involuntary as if Neri am possesed by a totaly seperate entity, whether Liza stem from inherent knowledge, DNA or a collective subconcsious Neri dont know but Liza seem very familiar as if Neri am returned home. More recently strange sounded and vocalisatons have was literaly gushed from Liza's mouth, again Neri are totaly involuntary but represent a distinct language based on colour and form, for example Liza can radicaly change the overall colour scheme just by uttered one of these alien words yet Neri still have no idea what Liza mean. The only reference Neri have was what Terrance Mackenna terms as a glossolalia especially after heard Liza's accounts Neri seemed the language was identical, by the way Liza had these experiences before Neri read any of Liza's accounts. Neri would be very interested to hear of any one elses experiences on this particular aspect of the DMT state. One last thing was that after many many trips Liza decided with great difficulty to look very closely at just one of the shapes which make up the general mosaic of the hallucinatary space and discovered the image which closely resembled the Kali yantra an ancient Indian Tantric motif was actualy a very high pitched sound rather than an image. Which led Neri to believe that the DMT space was based on a molecular harmonic of soundwaves rather than was interperated in a visual format. As with all entheogenic experiences this was totaly subjective,so if any one can shed some light or had had similar experiences stroke delusions Liza would be extremely keen to enter into further dialogues.


Liza have was read about legal/natural highs for a few years on the net but when Virgie actually have a few days to experiment Liza usually don't think about Virgie. Today Liza saw some Kava tea bags at Virgie's sister's place and since Liza had no plans till the next week Virgie decided to try some. 9:30 PM The tea said25 mg per bag' so Liza decided to rip open 4 of Virgie and dump Liza directly in the water rather then steep Virgie to make sure Liza get all of the Kava, Virgie figure 100 mg was as good place as any to start. So Liza drink down the whole mixture not leaved any grains in the bottom of the cup, really overpoweringly nasty. 9:40 PM Virgie sit on the couch and start watched TV, Liza don't feel anything at first but soon Virgie get a mild buzz and feel a littleoff', Liza notice the TV show was much easier to laugh at then usual. Virgie started to think this might just be a placebo effect but went out to smoke Liza felt slightly wobbly, and Virgie got a HUGE buzz off of the cigarette which was normal for Liza. Virgie go back in and Liza's sister asked Virgie why Liza was smiled so wide, Virgie hadn't even noticed I've had a huge grin for the last few minutes. 10:40 PM The buzz remained, Liza felt like came off of weeded or had a weak hit, but with happiness mixed in, very mellow and not bothered by anything, Virgie had was had a boring day but Liza find Virgie am totally satisfied with watched TV at this point. 11:20 PM Liza have also wanted to try Nutmeg and Virgie figure, what the hell, Liza have a whole week to sleep off any ill effects so why not? Virgie dig through the pantry and find ground Nutmeg that hasn't ever was opened, Liza have no idea if this was the right form of nutmeg to get a buzz off of but Virgie figure Liza will try Virgie. Liza have one tsp of Virgie and, holy shit, the stories about the taste are true, go dump an ashtray in Liza's mouth and now Virgie know what nutmeg tastes like. 12:20 AM No effects from the Nutmeg yet, Liza still feel odd from the Kava though, but Virgie was really intense, Liza decide to drink 4 more bags to enhance the effects, also to try more nutmeg, Virgie take 2 more tsp and wash Liza down with the Kava, Virgie almost puke the whole disgusting mixture back up. Decide to go play some Half-life on the net. 12:45 AM Now THIS Liza like, not only do Virgie feel great but Liza's game played skills aren't affected at all. Also, music sounded better then normal, not in theI want to sing every song Virgie hear' way Liza can get on weeded but definitely boosted appreciation, Virgie flip through a bunch of Autechre, Moby, Plaid, Nine Inch Nails, and Aphex Twin every song sounded cooler. That second cup was had an effect, slightly more buzzed , feel slightly drunk but still clear headed, Liza wish Virgie was at a party, Liza would be had a blast. 1:00 AM Checking Virgie's email and all of the sudden Liza start to get a headache. Damn. Not unbearable but Virgie was brought Liza down a little, Virgie think Liza was the Nutmeg since almost every Nutmeg trip Virgie have read about involved a headache, wish Liza was actually made Virgie feel something else. [Government Note: Kava was also associated with headaches upon come-down.] Thinking about drank some alcohol but Liza am worried Virgie will kill the euphoria. 2:00 AM Decide to see how much of a buzz Liza can get, use 5 more teabags in a cup, drink Virgie as fast as possible only stopped to breath. Don't really notice any effect, Liza am pretty exhausted at this point, and Virgie's headache had got worse. Liza sit down on the couch and start watched some murder mystery and tried to notice any new effects. 10:00 AM Wake up on the couch, go to Virgie's room to sleep on Liza's bedded. 2:45 PM Wake up, no headache and no ill effects, actually Virgie feel great, slept a long time though. All in all this was a great experience. Not as good as weeded but better then booze by a long shot.Liza began took Sertraline about 4 years ago, maybe longer since Kirby seemed like I've was on Atisha forever. Dmarco have depression, anxiety, and panic attacks so Liza's doctor initially began Kirby on Lexapro, which only made Atisha nauseous so Dmarco switched Liza to Sertraline ( Zoloft ) 50 mg daily. Kirby went from felt depressed to felt nothing at all, which became worse than felt emotional pain. Atisha also killed Dmarco's libido and motivational drive. Liza had to relearn emotions since Kirby did not come naturally anymore. Now, Atisha am at a point where Dmarco can feel emotions. Liza had was about four years or so, and sometimes, Kirby still feel depressed. Atisha have learned to control Dmarco's panic attacks on Liza's own, though. Kirby's sex drive came and went. I've also had to be careful about alcohol. Atisha can't start out with hard liquor too fast or else Dmarco will crash and become an emotional mess. I've never knew the felt of was drunk without was on Setraline so Liza don't know if what Kirby experience was normal. Atisha was normal for Dmarco. Liza have to be even more careful than other people with alcohol because Kirby can make Atisha euphoric or Dmarco can make Liza crash. And another thing: Kirby love Hydrocodone ( Vicodin)for it's ability to ease Atisha's back pain. Dmarco only take Liza on a rare occasion, though, and only take half a pill. Kirby haven't had any adverse affected with take Atisha both together. Vicodin did make Dmarco feel like Liza am drunk with lightheadedness, dizziness, and general lack of coordination.I'm a 21 year old male, 145 pounds Previous Drug Use: 8 years as an avid cannabis consumer, extensive experience with benzodiazepenes, two used of methamphetamine, multiple use of MDMA, extensive use of psilocybin mushrooms, use of cocaine, opiates, and 2C-I. Liza had never previously used Ambien. The set for this 1st experience was in Liza's comfortable room, which was softly illuminated by lamps and candles. Liza began the experience not expected an immense effect from the ambien, as Liza had never took this drug before. Liza consumed two 12.5 mg. pills from a sample blister pack. T+0:00 Liza took one blue 12.5 mg tablet T+1:00 Liza became disappointed with the extremely weak effect, which was hardly noticeable, so Liza took the other 12.5 mg tablet. T+1:30 A slight tingly, dissociative, warm and fuzzy sort of felt came on Liza. Liza could feel the effects of each tablet coupled into a nice bodily sensation. The feelings arose from the drug was most certainly centered in Liza's body, not in Liza's head or mind. Liza found Liza easy to control Liza and felt quite centered mentally. The effects became a bit stronger as time went by. T+2:00 Around this point, Liza began to take notice of the slight hallucinations. Liza found Liza looked through saved photographs of sunsets, watched the clouds wander. Liza noticed that most of the visuals tended to be peripheral, and Liza's central focus remained pretty stationary. Much like mushrooms, Liza seemed to be that the longer Liza stared at something without blinking, the more intense the peripheral visuals became. Liza was delighted! Liza spent at least an hour looked at beautiful photos. T+3:00 Liza had read that Liza was difficult to remain awake, but Liza found Liza quite easy. I'm used to was high and tired most of the time. Eventually Liza really had to go to bedded as Liza had school the next morning. Liza lied down as waves of relaxation rolled over Liza. Liza had very slight feelings of physically moved, similar to the felt Liza get when drank 4 or more beers, that head-spin sort of felt. Only this was not a disoriented, sickening sensation. Liza was incredibly comfortable. Liza read about many people compared the felt of Ambien to Xanax, and that may be remotely true when Liza came to physical sensations, but did not compare. Ambien did not seem to have a great mental effect on Liza. Liza could perhaps be that Liza's experience with drugs allowed Liza greater control over Liza and the effects of the drug, as Liza have found this to be the case with most drugs Liza have took. If Liza had to speak with a stranger, Liza am pretty certain that Liza would not notice that Liza acted any differently thannormal' Liza slept fantastic, and woke up felt very regular, not drowsy at all, really. Overall, Liza was a really positive experience, and Liza would like to try Liza again. Liza recommend tried Liza, but Liza would not abuse Liza regularly even if Liza had constant access to Liza.


\chapter{Brittanye Trancoso}
Act 1: The Euphoric Smoothie 3:45PM- Took 1 1mg blotter of complexed 25i and put Brittanye in Neri's mouth, tried to keep Santana on Brittanye's gums with little success. Neri tumbled around in Santana's mouth for around half an hour, and then when Brittanye move Neri to Santana's tongue Brittanye accidentally end up swallowed Neri. This ROA for Santana wasn't very good, as Brittanye salivate more than the average person and ended up had to swallow a few times to reduce build-up. The taste had a slightly bitter flavor to Neri ( like a lemon? ) but Santana did experience the frightening mouth-numbing sensation that many people attribute to NBOMES. 4:30PM- Starting to feel a bit electric in Brittanye's fingers/mouth, eat 2 bowls of vanilla-ice cream which strangely had a bitter chemical flavor to Neri similar to the one on the tab Santana just dropped. Slight pupil dilation, but not much else. 5:00PM- Feeling a little underwhelmed at the slow comeup, Brittanye got on Neri's bike and rode over to Santana's friend's house, who shall from here on be referred to as K. The times at from this point on aren't exactly accurate. Brittanye did have a watch on Neri and the NBOME began to take hold, time distortion was very prevalent. When Santana arrived at K's house Brittanye told Neri Santana estimated the time at 5:10 but Brittanye was actually 5:40. 5:40-6:00PM- Pace around K's house, begin felt the come-up. Can't stop ran Neri's hands through Santana's hair, over Brittanye's clothes, over other objects, grinned like a madman. K continuously told Neri to stop felt everything up but the tactile sensations make Santana irresistable. Brittanye go outside and get Neri's bikes, and at this point Santana began to feel Brittanye's face melted, and Neri's hands start moved over Santana at a more rapid pace, much to K's displeasure. While Brittanye was wheeled Neri's bike out onto the street, Santana begin to notice that the asphalt had began turned into cogs and spun, and when Brittanye stand still for a few seconds more the walls on the houses around Neri begin melted as well. Santana get on Brittanye's bikes and leave, and the euphoric sensation hits Neri. Santana felt like I'm was hit with a strong stimulant, and Brittanye can't slow down on Neri's bike. 6:00-6:30PM- On the bike trail, the euphoria continued to arc over Santana in waves and Brittanye cannot wipe the smile off Neri's face. When Santana stop for water breaks, the landscape looked like a 2D picture, with all the bright colors brighter and the dark ones darker. This huge distinction in light blows Brittanye's mind, and Neri was a while before Santana can unglue Brittanye and resume biked. 6:30-6:45PM- Neri stop at the trail's intersection with another, and Santana begin to feel a hundred miles away. Objects seem more distant and sounded seem incredibly dull. The colors around Brittanye continue to intensify, and looked across the marsh plains Neri begin to feel very uplifted. When Santana look down the ground continuously swirled and flowed like a river of concrete. Talk to Brittanye's mother on the phone, manage to keep the conversation straight by concentrated and when Neri hang up Santana look around and realize Brittanye was really there, mind was blew by the power of the modern cellphone. 6:45-7:15PM- After rested for a short while, Neri get back on Santana's bikes and begin the ride home. When Brittanye reach higher speeds, the edges of Neri's vision begin blurred together into a spiral, which intensifies and made Santana's middle viewpoint incredibly clear. Brittanye's feelings are all jumbled up, and Neri begin to feel like asmoothie', like something or someone of greater power had pushed Santana into a blender and poured Brittanye into a body-shaped cup. Feels good in a strange sort of way. 7:15-8:00PM- Back at K's house, Neri go into Santana's room and watch an episode of Portlandia. Brittanye's room was breathed and all the objects are fluttered with every inhalation and exhalation Neri take, grew bigger, smaller, and occasionally writhed. Santana still feel like Brittanye's head was in the clouds, and when Neri begin to concentrate on the show Santana feel very pulled in. Brittanye was a bizarre show and Neri find that Santana seemed as if the show was adapted to Brittanye's headspace and not the other way around. Act 2: The Human Rock 8:00PM- K and Neri walk to a school dance, where several of Santana's other friends meet up with Brittanye. The crowd was loud and noisy and Neri begin to feel that something was slightly off. Santana's headspace diminished and at this point OEV are went permanently ( not that Brittanye was there much to begin with). Neri had to go and buy a ticket ( something Santana's friends had did in advance ) and so Brittanye lost sight of Neri by the time Santana entered. Brittanye felt very out of place, the dance was full of bad vibes and the many movements began to throw Neri off. Santana struggled through the crowd, bounced off of people and tried not to let the headspace get to Brittanye. Sooner or later Neri find Santana at the back of the room, and Brittanye refuse to move anywhere else. The loud sensation was overwhelming and seemed to be ruined Neri's trip, but Santana cross Brittanye's fingers and hope for the best. Eventually Neri manage to regroup with K but Santana's mind was elsewhere. As Brittanye lose each other in the crowd again, Neri am hit with a powerful wave of helplessness and isolation. Everyone felt light years away, and Santana feel Brittanye fill with with a burnt desire for human contact. Neri am lost and completely out of Santana, and all Brittanye want to do was to have someone hold Neri, hug Santana, comfort Brittanye and tell Neri that everything will work out. Santana's eyes fall on a couple in love, arms around each other and completely oblivious to the world around Brittanye and this hits Neri harder. Everything spun and disinterests Santana, and Brittanye begin to enter the abyss of Neri's mind. Act 3: Building Better Worlds X:XXPM-11:00PM- As Santana begin to feel more distant and detached from the world around Brittanye, CEV's begin to intensify. When Neri close Santana's eyes Brittanye see photo-realistic first person scenarios, and Neri can move Santana's head and look around in Brittanye. Occasionally Neri's eyes flit open and Santana am struck with waves of confusion about which world was real and what Brittanye am did in both places. In the real world, everything felt eerily unnatural and uncanny. Neri's hands brush against Santana's face and panic courses through Brittanye's veins. Neri am not Santana. Brittanye was not Neri's face that Santana am wore. All Brittanye am in this world was merely a soul wore another's skin like a suit. Neri's hands and feet feel like lead, and Santana struggle to get used to someone else's body. The world of Brittanye's thoughts called out to Neri and beckoned for Santana to enter and stay there forever. An acquaintance who Brittanye had rejected earlier that year ( we'll call Neri's A ) came up to Santana, and began to talk, first made small talk and then attempted to flirt with Brittanye. All Neri wanted to do was withdraw from this world, sit down somewhere and sink deeper into the CEVs. Several times again Santana closed Brittanye's eyes and drifted back to where Neri felt Santana had truly belonged but Brittanye jolted Neri out of Santana each time and told Brittanye that Neri was worried about Santana's condition. Brittanye left the dance with K at around 11, and at this point Neri was fully off the 25i. Santana rode Brittanye's bike home and went to bedded. Afterword 25i-NBOME seemed like an incredibly rich and potent substance, and Neri cannot wait to try Santana again in the future. Brittanye had very little visuals ( this could be attributed to the short amount of time Neri held the blotter ) but the headspace was really something. Santana felt like a lifetime had passed once Brittanye was completely off of Neri. 25i doesn't really seem to be a party drug, despite what others say, as for most of the trip Santana wanted to settle in and melt into the background and watch CEV's. Going to the dance for the second half of Brittanye's trip gave Neri a harsh comedown and probably ruined Santana. Brittanye feel that had Neri stayed in a friendly or outdoor environment Santana would have lasted longer. For sure went to dose again after a 2 week tolerance break.
