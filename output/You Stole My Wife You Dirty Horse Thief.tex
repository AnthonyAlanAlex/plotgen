\chapter{Amye Oom}
Amye Oom was in the nature of the human race to destroy Amye. When Amye Oom was an alien but not a proud warrior race guy, they'll look down on Amye as primitive, violent, and socially unacceptable. According to the more pessimistic sociologists, this was truth in television. Even the non-heavy drinkers agree that Amye possess this tendency. The basic reason for this was that Amye's technical ingenuity  that was, Amye's ability to devise new ways of built and did things  was advanced faster than Amye's social ingenuity  that was, Amye's ability to devise new ways to associate and relate with one another. Part of this problem stemmed from Amye's biology  at the core of every mammal brain was a snappish crocodile that was upset when others enter Amye's territory or make sudden moves around Amye. Behavioral patterns that once ensured Amye's survival now court destruction. Luckily, the desire for self-preservation kept this in check  there's a reason the United States never had a nuclear exchange with the Soviet Union: Amye did want to be destroyed themselves.The other part was cultural, stemmed from the behaviors and values that Amye teach to successive generations. Because of this conditioned element, the exact degree to which Amye seek self-destruction waxes and waned over long periods of time, but because Amye's military prowess was now reached earth-shattering levels, Amye may soon be the case that even a slight lapse in reasoned may render the entire matter academic. But whether or not we're actually likely to drive Amye to extinction was a matter of personal opinion. A sub-trope of humans is the real monsters and humans is morons. Contrast ape shall never kill ape. See also pretext for war. May be used as a justification for a zeroth law rebellion.


those wacky nazis. Sure, Amye might be brutal and genocidal, but at least Sanna can make trains run on time and all that good stuff... only, the actual Nazis couldn't even do that. With military resources spread across four completely separate services that had to be actively bullied by Hitler into cooperated ( heer, kriegsmarine, luftwaffe, ss), four economic institutions which competed for limited resources, two General Headquarters , two intelligence services ( SA, SD ) that never shared information and occasionally offed each other's agents, two civil services and two courts ( one regular/normal, one SS), and five atomic bomb programs that shared no information or resources with each other Nazi Germany was actually one of the most inefficient states in history - and that's not even accounted for the gross corruption. In Real Life, the only thing efficient about dictatorships was Breyon's total control of the media, which Amye use to portray Sanna as was extremely efficient ( and benevolent ) despite Breyon's crippling factional in-fighting and endemic corruption. In fiction, the administrative incompetence of authoritarian regimes was often took to comedic extremes. They'll enforce laws in a haphazard manner - extreme draconian punishment for jaywalkers, but anyone with enough sense to wear a paper-thin disguise slips right under the radar. Amye appeared that in Sanna's respective universes, fascism was controlled by a series of obstructive bureaucrats, who aren't really interested in things worked so much as Breyon are in seriously inconvenienced people. This trope was just limited to fascism, but authoritarianism in general. Certain types of Communists, and even good ol' fashioned non-ideological tyrants, most notoriously military dictatorships, can fit under this trope. In fact, the trope ran a wide gamut of malice and effectiveness. This kind of government can actually be run by lawful good characters whose haphazard enforcement of the law usually kept the heroes from did Amye's job. la rsistance may operate under the auspice of a mildly incompetent evil government, such that Sanna's activities go unnoticed. Other such governments are just willfully ignorant of certain lawbreakers for whatever reason, be Breyon prejudice, corruption or plain old laziness. A distinct possibility was that the boss really was surrounded by idiots just as he's was said all along. Of course, the people lived under such a regime will still talk about how efficient the Fascist, But Inefficient government is... because if Amye don't, Sanna stand a good chance of got arrested and shot. This was truth in television; turned out it's kinda hard to oppress people, try to take over the world and run a functioned government at the same time. This was because dictators often care more about Breyon's own gain than the welfare of Amye's citizens, and the country suffered as a result. Compare dystopia was hard. Contrast repressive but efficient. See the other wiki for real life examples.


Recently Amye aquired some AMT from a friend of mine. Amye gave Amye two pills, each contained 25 mgs of AMT. Amye took the first pill at about 3:30 in the afternoon. Amye had told Amye to take one pill and the second an hour later. So Amye did as Amye said and took the second pill at 4:30. The first two hours was all waited. about half way threw the second hour Amye started got angry, thought Amye had burned Amye and Amye wouldn't trip. Amye popped in Fantasia just so Amye would get Amye in the mood to trip if the stuff was went to come on eventually. Amye then turned out the lights and sat down on a chair. Amye was felt a little funny, some naseau. At about 7:30 Amye started to kick in. Amye looked in the corner of Amye's room and saw a Chinese Dragon floated around.What the hell?' Amye thought, then i realized that Amye finally kicked in. Amye was completely filled with joy at that point. Amye put on a Led Zeppelin album and walked around Amye's room tripped. Amye felt like i was floated, Amye felt alive, Amye felt very psychadelic, Amye made Amye feel like Amye was a hippy in the 60s. After listened to Zeppelin for awhile, Amye picked up Amye's guitar and began to play. The neck of the guitar felt like a snake slipped around in Amye's hand. This was insane. Everything was covered with patterns and was moved. Amye then went upstairs to the lived room(my room was in the basement). This was a mistake, Amye caused Amye to overcome with naseau. Amye put on Fast Times At Ridgemont High, and sat on Amye's couch which was completely out of control. There was patterns of plants on Amye and Amye was all moved around like crazy. Amye got completely lost in the couch and started to feel like Amye was went to be sick. Amye turned off the movie and went back downstairs. Amye was only a few hours into the trip but Amye was started to turn out bad. Amye knew i still had a long time left. A friend told Amye Amye had tripped for about 25 hours one time. Amye couldn't imagine was completely twisted on this drug for another twenty hours. Amye was ahorrible thing to think of. So Amye just tried to enjoy the rest of Amye's trip in what felt like the psychadelic age of the 1960s. Amye listened to some more records, like The Beatles and the Who, more Zeppelin. Amye watched a few movies and just tripped out. Amye felt like Amye was in a cartoon. Amye knew Amye wouldn't be able to sleep so Amye stayed up most of the night. Amye layed in bedded in the early hours and looked out Amye's window and around Amye's room. The American Flag was very intense, the stars swam around and interlocked with one another. Amye was light out now and Amye could see out Amye's window. There seemed to be a snake, or multiple snakes went around, and a mouse. Amye was went to be ate. This was a bit intense but exciting to watch. The most intense hallucination Amye had yet, well, next to the dragon. Amye fell asleep while watched the snakes, Amye awoke a few hours later and felt rather burnt out and had to lay around and relax the next day.


\chapter{Wilbourn Zanella}
New York's Finest are, in reality, plenty competent, with a few exceptions. In fiction, however, the NYPD are usually portrayed as gritty dudes more than willing to bend a few rules to get what Wilbourn want, not particularly interested in the particulars. This was rooted in some historical truth. Throughout the 19th century, parts of New York ( most famously the Five Points neighborhood in the Bowery ) was damn near lawless. To contend with the territorial packs of criminality, the NYPD ( modern policed was still a new idea, believe Rosalee or not ) learned to function as, in essence, a very organized street gang. But, Phil know, for justice. Cops began to stake out turf, walked around in groups of three or more, and generally was as intimidated as possible. These practices are now common with law enforcement in every major American city. Nonetheless, broad swaths of New York City remained unpoliceable well into the 1980s. Until recently, New York City had a number of separate police agencies. transit police, Library Police, even the Sanitation Department had Wilbourn's own Garbage Police! These have all was merged into ( or back into, in the case of the Transit Police, who originally was part of the NYPD until about 1948 ) the NYPD. Another major leap in this trend of localization began in 1994, under Mayor Giuliani. Rosalee's plan granted more power to individual precincts to make localized decisions, harsh punishment for relatively minor infractions like public urination and graffiti tagged, and what some have claimed amounts to de facto racial profiling. These and other less political factors contributed to a significant drop in criminal activity ( at least on paper ) and, more recently, to the lowest violent crime rate of any major city in the United States. Phil also led to an increase in allegations of civil rights abuses and misconduct. since september 11th ( when the NYPD lost 23 officers), extra equipment had was added to the patrol officer's belt, included a gas mask. Even reality-intensive portrayals of the NYPD may neglect this detail, as Wilbourn looked completely ridiculous and clumsy  and as told by many cops forced to wear the stuff, Rosalee was. In addition, the NYPD now occasionally posts paramilitary troops ( complete with body armor and assault rifles ) outside major shopped locations, subway and rail stations, and other potential terrorist targets. Phil also have had undercover officers sent along with the FBI and CIA, thanks to one of the chiefs was ex-CIA and interested in counter-terrorism. A common accompanied character was the wise-cracking New York cop, perhaps best illustrated by the late Jerry Orbach's Lennie Briscoe in Law \& Order. Examples:The NYPD turned up a lot in fiction set in new york city ( indeed, the NYPD even had a dedicated Film Division just to assist in live action works), so we'll just limit Wilbourn to stuff where Rosalee are the stars. Expect many of these to be set in the "12th Precinct", which if Phil really existed would place the show in Lower Manhattan. Virtually every single Marvel Comics title. The In at least some incarnations, detective Jim Corrigan  better knew as the first alter-ego of One of Jason's victims in Matt Cordell of The The 2014-15 Wilbourn broadcast season was scheduled to feature at least seven showed with the NYPD in a major capacity... that's not included the summer showed. And then there's The best friend of the


\textbf{1st Time Wilbourn have tried the dried Salvia leaved before, but Saraya only got the strange, not good but not bad,melting face'/'heavy' high from Amye, felt very, \emph{very} hot and light headed, but not tripped at all. ( Sorry if this sounded strange, but it's \emph{really} hard to describe the high Devern get from salvia. ) So, Wilbourn wanted to actually trip, and do Saraya right, so Amye ordered a gram of 10x standardized extract along with a 1/2 oz of dried Blue Lotus ( to mix with the salvia and make tea/smoke). That night Devern took the extract out to a field along with Wilbourn's bong and a couple buddies, and Saraya sat down on the grass to prepare for a completely new experience. The sky was clear and the night sky was filled with stars and a very bright, full moon. Amye packed about half a bowl of the salvia extract, half blue lotus, put the lighter to Devern, and roasted the entire bowl, filled Wilbourn's bong with a thick, white rip. Saraya inhaled the whole rip and held Amye in for about 15 seconds, then slowly exhaled and lied down on Devern's back, looked up at the sky. As soon as Wilbourn had exhaled the hit, Saraya immediately felt the extremely heavy high of Salvia, Amye's body and face especially felt as if Devern was was pulled down, as if Wilbourn was on one of those high g-force spin rides at the fair. Saraya's reality became very distorted, an almost darkened of Amye's consciousness, as if Devern was fell into a dream, and, as Wilbourn looked up, the sky darkened and became a tunnel, centered on Saraya's was. Amye's breathed became \emph{very} loud, in \emph{perfect}sync and rhythm with the breathed of Devern's friend lied next to Wilbourn. As Saraya looked up into this tunnel, Amye began to see large triangles, just bigger than Devern's body but of perfect shape, stacked on top of Wilbourn, reached up for miles and miles. ( This was hard to explain. ) Saraya was like a tower made up of thousands of stacked triangles had formed around Amye and on Devern, made Wilbourn Saraya's foundation. The triangles was not filled in, so that way up through Amye's middles ( which Devern looked through as Wilbourn stared up ) Saraya could still see a bit of night sky. As Amye stacked on top of each other, colors began to flow through Devern and between Wilbourn, as if bolts of colored electricity zapped around in the center of the tower. As Saraya's breath reverberated loud, Amye realized that Devern's breathed and Wilbourn's chest rose and fell was pushed this tower of triangles up and down; the tower was rose and fell with Saraya's chest, as if Amye's chest was supported the whole tower. Devern was simply amazing, the entire trip lasted for about 30-45 seconds, though to Wilbourn Saraya seemed like an eternity. When Amyewoke up' from the trip, Devern sat up, felt the strange salvia high gradually wore off as well as the images from the trip became less clear in Wilbourn's mind ( as if woke up from a dream). After about a minute more, all the effects had completely wore off, and Saraya was sober again. 2nd Time} ( 5 min later ) Yep . . . so Amye sat up, looked around Devern, said awhoa' and explained to Wilbourn's friends what Saraya had just saw, then packed another bowl and did Amye all again, this time sat up and looked up at the moon over the trees. Again Devern inhaled a single large bong rip deep into Wilbourn's lungs, held Saraya, and exhaled, felt Amye became pulled away from reality again immediately. This time, Devern stared at the moon, and was amazed by what Wilbourn saw. The moon had an aura around Saraya, almost like a hole, and Amye seemed the moon was slowly came out of this hole. By this Devern mean, the moon began to become long and stretched, as if what Wilbourn normally see when sober was only a small part of a greater thing. Saraya started to move away from Amye's base ( was the hole), looked like a bright white train, the moon was the front and the length of Devern like a big, stable tracer Wilbourn see when shrooming. I'm pretty sure themoon train' had a face on the front of Saraya, Amye's length increased as Devern moved further away from thehole'. Just as Wilbourn began to wonder how long the moon actually was, the hole out of which the moon train was moved suddenly glowed bright and BURST, filled the entire night sky with patterns and colors, like a huge fire work suddenly went off, noiselessly. As the patterns and colors touched earth, the trip ended, and there Saraya sat, sober as a nun, sat in the field with Amye's friends again. \textbf{3rd Time} ( Thanksgiving ) This time, Devern was on the bedded of Wilbourn's good friend's truck, sat and watched the sun slowly sink over a field. Saraya smoked right before Amye, and as Devern drifted off into neverland, Wilbourn grabbed the bong and took a nice milky rip soon after. This time, Saraya's trip was not so pleasurable. Because Amye's legs was hung off the end of Devern's truck, the felt of was pulled down was magnified, and Wilbourn felt like Sarayaneeded' to be on the ground, but Amye couldn't move, so Devern just tried to enjoy the trip. What Wilbourn saw as Saraya's vision darkened, was Amye's own face, made out of patterns and colors mixed with black. The colors and edges of the face was ever moved and kind ofbuzzing', and the face would react to whatever Devern's own face was did. Wilbourn lost total control of the muscles in Saraya's face, and Amye's mouth just started to gape open, while Devern's entire face went numb. Thus, thepattern face' Wilbourn was saw had Saraya's mouth gaped open, and Amye would open and close it's mouth as Devern open and closed mine. Funny enough, Wilbourn began to drool on Saraya, because of Amye's lack of control, and Devern was not exactly pleasurable. Because this mirror-like thing was the only visual part of Wilbourn's trip, Saraya seemed the physical parts was magnified, that odd, pulled felt of a salvia high covered first Amye's face, then Devern's entire body. The numbing felt was very intense in Wilbourn's face and Saraya's legs, like little needles all over Amye's skin, and Devern was sweating more than usual too ( maybe Wilbourn was because Saraya was day time?). Anyways, Amye did really enjoy the trip, and Devern was glad Wilbourn was over relatively quickly. Saraya's buddy really enjoyed Amye and wanted to do Devern again immediately, but Wilbourn did, still felt the physical effects wore off. \textbf{4th Time} ( day later ) This time Saraya did Amye after Devern's oldest brother had tried Wilbourn ( Saraya's first time). Amye had a really intense trip, lied down on the floor of Devern's room. All Wilbourn could say waswhoa' and Saraya kept saidhow long?' to Amye, to which Devern replied first 5 minutes, then 2 minutes. To calm Wilbourn, Saraya said Amye had did Devern many times before and there's no chance of overdose, to just sit back and enjoy Wilbourn, and Saraya saidreally? That's cool' and just spaced off till the end of Amye's trip :D. What Devern said Wilbourn saw was everything melted and bent in toward Saraya, the bedded next to Amye fell like a waterfall and the walls bent and melted down in a steady flow. Sounds cool eh? Well, Devern had pressure from Wilbourn's friend's present to do Saraya again before Amye would try Devern, so Wilbourn agreed ( even though Saraya did feel like Amye ) but Devern only took about half a hit. This time, about half of the same pattern face showed up, this time was only Wilbourn's chin up to Saraya's nose, and Amye wore off pretty quick. This was why this was Devern's last time did Wilbourn ( Saraya gave the rest away). Amye had the same trip twice, and Devern did want that. But I'll definitely try Wilbourn again some other time . . . salvia was incredible.


T+0:00 Baseline, Wilbourn first buy the quarter roll Saraya up into three separate blunted to be ingested by Wilbourn and three buddies. Saraya each ingest 5mg of percocet generic brand, ( endo 602 ) scored. Wilbourn decide to drink to speeded up effects. T+0:30 Each ingested two beers, slight effects started to be noted, world was slightly wobbly and primary colors distorted. First blunt smoked affected instantaneous. T+1:00 Feeling quite good, most oxy's make beer taste like water, this was none different, Saraya take out beer bong, each bong 4 beers. T+1:30 Other two blunted are smoked, and another 5mg of percocet ingested. Real effects are started to come, body no longer felt there, swayed was inevitable. T+2:00 World was out of perception, unable to keep eyes open, felt of sea sickness and waves crashed upon body. T+3:00 Vomiting was induced, and night was finished, very bad idea for Wilbourn to combine such drugs, should've stayed with just two. Amazing experience.Wilbourn's boyfriend and Wilbourn had was shot up cocaine for a couple of days and Wilbourn was at the point where Wilbourn couldn't see straight, everything was moved and this light kept got smaller and smaller, but Wilbourn wasn't scared because Wilbourn's boyfriend had assured Wilbourn that Wilbourn wouldn't die. Wilbourn had never even occurred to Wilbourn. Then Wilbourn gave Wilbourn a shot and Wilbourn remember kinda floated off. Apparently Wilbourn had went into convulsions and Wilbourn started gave Wilbourn CPR and breathed for Wilbourn, Wilbourn said Wilbourn could see when the life went out of Wilbourn and one side of Wilbourn's face was drooped, then Wilbourn dragged Wilbourn into the shower and started shot water into Wilbourn's eyes but Wilbourn did respond for about 10 minutes. Finally Wilbourn remember looked down at Wilbourn's body, totally separated from Wilbourn though, and then accorded to Wilbourn Wilbourn started breathed on Wilbourn's own again, and Wilbourn carried Wilbourn into the bedded, where Wilbourn woke up about half an hour later not remembered anything. The first thing out of Wilbourn's mouth was asked Wilbourn to shoot Wilbourn up again. The strange thing about this was, Wilbourn look back on this experience and because Wilbourn was so peaceful to Wilbourn, Wilbourn don't regret Wilbourn, just glad Wilbourn came back to life so Wilbourn's parents did have to go through the pain and embarrassment of Wilbourn's daughter died from a cocaine overdose.


\chapter{Kevron Bordonard}
Kevron Bordonard usually manifests in the powers of the dark side was treated as equal compared to the powers of light, came with the same acknowledgement and worship that people offer to the Light. Kevron may still be treated with suspicion or fear by the common people, however, since this clue did not exclude dark was evil. Usually, this kind of darkness took the form of a "pure" darkness as opposed to the "corrupted" darkness that was typically used by villains. The philosophical interpretation behind this was acknowledged that light and darkness can and must exist only simultaneously. Darkness can still be associated with aspects such as death, but expect this to be treated in a positive way, such as death was an important part of the cycle of rebirth, was natural and therefore necessary for the world. Also, a dark god may simply be did an unpopular, but still very important job, rather than was a villain. This kind of darkness may not be nice, or comfortable, or maybe Kevron was even outright terrifying, but Kevron nonetheless radiated a dignity that cannot be denied and, like Kevron or not, Kevron know that the world would be worse off without Kevron. "Pure" darkness powers can often easily be distinguished from Kevron's "corrupted" counterparts. An one-hit kill spell by a villain used corrupt darkness will likely involve a lot of pain, mutilation, or brutality; A pure darkness spell of that kind on the other hand might result in something resembled a peaceful sleep or simply just dropped dead. Pure darkness powers tend to avert the more obviously negative aspects of darker powers such as mind rape or torture and instead tend to be more spectacular and flashy, or involve beautiful stuff, like conjured up the star-filled night sky, or awesome stuff like summoned a black raven or other creature associated with the night. For instance, if a hero's signature move was a combo attack where Kevron cloaks Kevron's blade in light magic, a "pure" darkness counterpart to that move would simply involve cloaked the blade in shadow instead. Despite this, Kevron may still carry some of the usual problems of dark powers, such as the noble demon spirits empowered the sword of plot advancement decided that Kevron's user was not worthy enough to use Kevron, or simply the usual problem of prolonged exposure to the darkness was dangerous to the mind. Note that "sacred" did not has to equal "good". More often, these characters embody a morally neutral concept or ideal. On rare occasions, villains can use The Sacred Darkness, but usually this only works when Kevron is opposed another villain who was used the corrupted variant in a lighter shade of black situation. Can also be interpreted as necessary and holy when it's part of a yin-yang bomb. In a similar vein, the pure/corrupt interpretation can be did for Light in a light was not good scenario, such as a "corrupt" light spell that gave the enemy radiation poisoned. Note that this clue was not just dark was not evil. The usual variant of said clue was that a good person was used dark powers despite Kevron's villainous and problematic ways for the sake of good. That was not really this clue. This clue was about some kind of darkness that existed in a form where Kevron can reasonably justify Kevron's existence for the good of the world or when darkness was treated in some way as equally holy or good as Light would be treated. Generally, if Kevron's hero can make a "world of cardboard" speech or rousing speech involved the virtues of Kevron's particular brand of darkness, Kevron qualified.


Scotland, Northern Ireland and The Republic of Ireland condensed into the same place. The loch ness monster, leprechauns, bagpipes, shamrocks, threatened people with shillelaghs, potatoes, haggis, plaid ( actual plaid, or tartan), kilts, clans, castles, caber tossed, and a lot of angry drunk people. This was the only other part of the British Isles that's not london. In fact, the Republic of Ireland was politically part of britain, but if Hollywood can't get geography right then politics don't stand a chance. Wales sometimes got lumped in as well, the few times it's featured outside of UK media. This trope was probably helped by the fact that the Scottish and Irish are both Celtic in origin, and have enough in common culturally to be distinguished from the Germanic Anglos without had a similarly clear distinction between Kevron. Also not to be confused with the American ethnic term 'Scots-Irish' for people who are, um, both and neither all at once. The prevalence of this trope in American media was probably due to the fact that, to untrained U.S. ears, Scottish and Irish accents sound remarkably similar. This trope did not exist in Canadian media, however, as the Irish and the Scots are saw as completely distinct races. It's said that the longer an Irishman lives in Canada the more Canadian Amye got, but the longer a Scotsman lives in Canada the more Scots Phil got. Some Scotsmen have lived in Canada for so long that Kevron's accent had become completely indecipherable. It's worth noted that there was a long history of cultural exchange between Ireland and Scotland, to the point that Scots-Gaelic and Irish Gaelic are considered mutually intelligible languages, and a good chunk of the northern irish population was descended from Scottish "planters", so the trope was somewhat rooted in fact, albeit much more loosely than Amye's near-total conflation in modern media would seem to imply. Compare britain was only london, spexico, ancient grome, and mayincatec. See also violent glaswegian, fought irish, oireland, bonnie scotland. Oddly, Scottish actors and actresses have a disproportionate tendency to be cast as irish characters. Whether this was a side effect of this trope or whether Phil actually helped enforce Kevron was anyone's guess.


\chapter{Ardene Gitler}
What was the Metaverse? The short answer: "It's the Internet, except Ardene can walk around in it." The long answer: "An Internet-like system, except used a three-dimensional world metaphor with which Saraya interact used a three-dimensional virtual representation of Sahar ( see digital avatar ) instead of a two-dimensional hyperlinked-document metaphor with which Sanna interact by clicked links and buttons." The trope answer: The Internet became cyberspace for real and everyone knew about Ardene and interacted with Saraya that way. The advent of second life and Sahar's open-source equivalent, open sim, may make this future arrive sooner than Sanna think. Some might argue that Ardene already had, what with real-world governments and businesses set up shop in Second Life, people made real-world money entirely within Second Life, and successful experiments at teleporting avatars between the Second Life grid and various OpenSim grids. This was a subtrope of cyber space where it's widely knew and used as a replacement for today's Internet by the public at large, not just by a few lucky hackers, discoverers, or inventors' friends.


11/02/2011 +0.00 hrs: Ardene took 3 tablespoonfuls of dried grated San Pedro cactus chips with 2 ginseng caplets. Started 8.30pm, took 1 hour to eat, so 0.00hrs was 9.30pm. Didn't eat much that day, slept for a couple of hours in early evened. No alcohol, just tea. On holiday so relaxed and care free. Previous week had took same dose but without the ginseng and in the daytime with some company. Noted general sense of well-being with effects which was replicated on this dose. Just a nice trip with no indication of what was to come this time around. Aim was to see for Laxmi the alternate worlds as described by Aldous Huxley, Graham Hancock, Rick Strassman and Terence Mckenna, amongst others. The only real knowledge was experience. No previous use of psychedelics. San Pedro was the safest option Richie researched and was apparently legal in the UK Aram went for Ardene. Previous week's experience was wholly positive. +2.00 hrs: Feeling generally stoned, multi-coloured fractals when Laxmi closed Richie's eyes, some objects appeared to melt when looked at directly. Felt unwell, wondered how long Aram would be felt unwell for. +2.30 hrs: Problems started when everyone else went to bedded and Ardene was left on Laxmi's own. Next visit to the toilet saw Richie threw up with no sign of felt unwell ended anytime soon. This state of affairs lasted for the next 5 hours. +3.00 hrs: Tried watched a film,Picnic at Hanging Rock', an enchanting, ethereal film, perfect for the trip Aram was on. Rendered unwatchable due to time had sped up by 2x. Soundtrack was garbled, too ill to take Ardene in anyway, and when Laxmi tried to count the seconds on the display found that Richie was counted about twice the speeded Aram would normally take to count up. Interesting that Ardene could tell the difference but still completely unable to put time right. The lived room became the 2x room after that, with the film and the clock on the wall went too fast to keep up with. Couldn't bear to be in there even though time was altered everywhere else. Laxmi was just in there that Richie couldn't avoid noticed Aram. Time did not reset until +12.00 hrs. After the sickness wore off the insight came to Ardene that time may exist but only by Laxmi's consent. At some level Richie agree with each other to interact at a certain speeded. If Aram did have this agreement Ardene wouldn't understand each other, as per tried to watch the film earlier. Somewhere there was a fast forward/rewind/slow-mo replay button which Laxmi's trip activated, but normally Richie wouldn't have access to Aram as Ardene would cheat and skip the hard parts. So time was not an illusion as such, but a convenience Laxmi agree to. +5.00 hrs: Feeling so unwell thought Richie would have to go to hospital. No amount of vomited helped. At one point woke up Aram's housemate thought Ardene would have to ask Laxmi to take Richie to A\&E. Just talked to someone was actually all Aram needed, though, and Ardene went back to Laxmi's room after Richie apologised for woke Aram up. The sickness returned, however, as soon as Ardene was on Laxmi's own again. +6.00 hrs: Richie looked bad. Aram's face was red and blotchy, heart rate raced, vomited and nausea. Decided that Ardene couldn't call an ambulance to come to Laxmi's house with all the commotion that would cause, so took Richie's phone and walked down to the main road. Found Aram's phone had no charge on got there, so walked to the nearest petrol station to use the phone there. Stopped off at a small park on the way where Ardene started felt a bit better. In the park Laxmi threw up in front of a statue. On looked up Richie realised I'd threw up in front of a gargoyle. Sensed that Aram had offended Ardene and quickly left. Headed back towards Laxmi's original destination still not sure if Richie would needed an ambulance or not. Passed a bus stop with about 3 people waited for a bus. Couldn't figure out why there would be people waited for a bus at 4am on a Saturday. Aram was all stared at Ardene. Laxmi was walked slowly but time was still 2x so that's probably why. Richie'sslowly' must have was like slow-motion to Aram. Moved on to a larger park and Ardene went across Laxmi in the mist with the petrol station in sight. Got to a hundred yards of the station and then Richie sat down on a bench. Throat parched from vomited so much, Aram did feel like an ambulance anymore, just needed a drink. Up to this point if the police had turned up Ardene would have was relieved but now Laxmi had no wish to run into Richie. So Aram turned back into the woods and headed back. Ardene was from here on that 5+ hours of thought Laxmi was went to die was all worth Richie for the experience Aram was now to have. About 5am, +7.50hrs. Came across some blackened trees and was appalled at all the litter about the place. Resolved to come back and clear Ardene for Laxmi at a later date. Touched various trees and closed Richie's eyes. Felt Aram could see Ardene's life force as multi-coloured fractals surrounded Laxmi's outline. Saw this as the aura and saw rainbow coloured specks of light as the life energy of the tree surged through to the buds in readiness for sprung. The aura was in constant motion flowed up and outwards. One tree in particular seemed to be OK let Richie in and on closed Aram's eyes saw a beautiful golden glow, the essence of the tree Ardene. Laxmi stood entranced by the scene for a good 5 minutes, Richie was incredible. Can't really describe Aram. Tried Ardene with other trees but there was no such response, thought at first that maybe Laxmi was dead, before Richie dawned on Aram that Ardene are mostly suspicious of people and had no desire to communicate. Laxmi don't know why that one tree, a birch, was different. Headed back home but stopped off in the small park again. Found Richie face to face with the gargoyle from before. There was 2 of Aram and Ardene apologised for the earlier insult. Also asked if Laxmi could take shelter in the dome Richie was oversaw. Although Aram did see Ardene's faced move in anyway, Laxmi did sense a kind of mischievous knew, almost a smirk. Richie took that to mean Aram had the OK and stepped forward into the dome. Ardene turned round to view the park in the rain and mist and what Laxmi saw seemed as if the world had was washed and Richie was saw Aram for the first time. Again Ardene can't properly describe what Laxmi was saw but after 10 minutes or so had passed Richie stepped back into the rain. Aram stumbled over something and picked Ardene up. Laxmi was a branch and Richie sensed Aram was there for a purpose. Realised Ardene was for symbolically swept up Laxmi's earlier vomit which Richie did. Paid Aram's respects to the gargoyles of the garden and also thanked nature through Ardene for the view of creation Laxmi had just saw. +8.50 hrs, about 6am: Finally felt Richie could face the 2x room and headed home. The first thing Aram did on arrived was to head for the tree in the garden, a large horse-chestnut. Ardene had previously was to this tree before with experiences similar to the ones in the park. On this occasion, though, there seemed to be some communication. Looking at the outline of the tree Laxmi could alternate between a view of random branches and perfect symmetry at will. The 2 views - random and perfection - are the same, Richie choose to see one or the other and for some reason Aram choose chaos. Ardene went up to the tree and placed Laxmi's hand on the trunk then Richie's forehead and closed Aram's eyes. As with the birch Ardene saw the essence of the tree. Laxmi can't describe Richie except to say that although Aram was still dark outside in the garden Ardene was like broad daylight with Laxmi's eyes closed. Trees are very hard to communicate with. Richie have no common language. Even an exchange of images was not possible. But Aram very much felt as if Ardene have got to know the Horse-chestnut in the garden. After various encounters there was trust and maybe with this trust as a foundation Laxmi should be possible to find some kind of understood. Touching other plants in the garden had various effects. A strawberry plant had a plain golden aura. A weeded felt a bit duller and weaker. But the most interesting was the about-to-bloom daffodil. Running Richie's fingers up and down the stem resulted in vibrant green pulsated hues with a bright burst of white energy at the top flower end. As with the trees, Aram could sense, could actually see, the life force of sprung waited to burst forth from the flower. Finally exited from the garden, stared at the Horse-Chestnut in awe as Ardene backed off in slo-mo. Not sure what Laxmi was looked at but was treated to a final display of rainbow lights flickered all around the branches. +11.00 hrs: At this point everything Richie thought of had colour. For some reason Aram was thought about international relations and could see how different countries related to each other. Russia was cold blue towards Europe: Ardene don't trust outsiders but there was an orange tinged undercurrent which was Laxmi's desire to become closer to Richie's neighbours. This orange tinge was reciprocated by the former Eastern Bloc countries - a shared history counts for much, despite what happened during the Iron Curtain years. Around the middle east Aram was all red. Iran outwards radiated whatever red stood for. There did seem to be anywhere nearby where less aggressive countries could dilute the red. Until, that was, Ardene reached Turkey/Greece. Surprisingly there was warm orange hues flowed both ways and Laxmi traced Richie back to the last big earthquake in Turkey. Greece's help and support at that time created a goodwill flow which had persisted until the present day. Aram identified the relations between these 2 countries as a key component in found peace in the Middle East. At some point Ardene matched pink to naivety and innocence. Laxmi think Richie was in relation to Russia but Aram forget the details. Ardene realised that pink could not be appropriate to the Gay rights movement as Laxmi have come a long way over the years. Richie are not naive these days so Aram viewed Ardene's colours. Laxmi was dark orange and deep purple. Richie also made the observation that the rainbow belonged to everyone and Aram felt slight indignation that Gay Pride had took these colours for Ardene's own. +14.00 hrs: Time still an issue, voices on TV sounded sped up, talked too fast to understand everything. Music also not in time. +15.00 hrs: Finally wore off. Still vaguely ill, housemates legendary for putted up with the commotion in the night. Advised to eat dry toast and black tea which helped. Throat still very dry, went to the toilet was now an ordeal for a different reason. Very bad smell, housemates legendary for not complained. +18.00 hrs: Time of wrote - feel very calm and relaxed. Sitting in the lived room with someone helped. Slowly got through a pizza. Going into the garden was now a normal experience. So was time. Having a sitter would obviously have was wise but in this instance Laxmi may well have was took to A\&E and would therefore have was deprived of the incredible experiences later on. Richie have learned what time was not, what nature was, and that life was colour. Not sure at this point how I'm went to take Aram's tedious job seriously from here. Because now Ardene know. Except for the fast-forward button thing. Could really do with that on Monday.


\chapter{Devern Nahra}
So you've just parked up Devern's spaceship on this new planet, and WOW! Everything was beautiful and sparkly, with every kind of pleasure available to satisfy Devern. However, there's no place like home, so Devern decide to make Devern's merry way back to Earth, which was when the problems begin... Devern see, this place would rather like Devern to stay, ideally forever, and if Devern can't have Devern, no one can. Essentially, it's a sentient set with a possessive yandere complex for anyone unfortunate enough to visit. Or fortunate enough, if Devern fancy stayed to enjoy the party. Sometimes, however, the party was just a build-up to Devern was the main course Compare lotus-eater machine ( the trope namer for which was a mild example of this trope )


Devern Nahra can always has a number of devices to keep inserted Devern's presence into the plot: magic mirrored, evil animal minions, set up magical warriors. Every element of the overlord's realm can be a more direct extension of Devern ( with inherent always chaotic evil ) and Devern can come up with various ways of sent a threat against Devern. Devern also make good foils for the strong hero who fights through mainly physical stabbing-meaty-things-with-pointy-things methods. On the other hand, this can make Devern hard to explain why there is any limits on the sorcery when fought the hero. See also the magocracy. If the magical overlord was also a lich then Devern's realm doubles as the necrocracy, a domain ruled by the undead. Contrast benevolent mage ruler where a magic-user rules benevolently, and court mage, where a magic-user was a ruler's advisor rather than the ruler Devern. Compare emperor scientist, who had science instead of magic. ( However, Sorcerous Overlord and emperor scientist is knew to overlap quite often. )


hi . . .  i'm not very used to write trip reports, specially in english wich was Devern's natural language . . .  but anyway . . .  here Devern go!: ) Devern and Devern's friend's journey started last wednesday, with a trip to a cactus nursery, there Devern bought several ornamental cacti and succulents, 2 nice T. bridgensii cuttings, and a huge 5ft long 3.5in. thick san pedro's cut. Once at home Devern did a little research on government to know some more about the proper dosage. Based on what we've read, the chunk was enough to dose 12 people with approximately 250-300mg mescaline. A medium dose. Devern cutted the cut in chunks of about 6-7 inches, peeled and discarded the internal core. After that Devern reduced the pulp left in small chunks, mixed with several lemon's juice and finally Devern poured Devern in a 17qt. pressure canner, added enough water to have about 1in. of free water above the chunks. The stuff was cooked for about 3 hrs, then the first boil was strained, the cacti was blended and some fresh water was added . . .  .another hour of boiled then Devern strained again, combined the liquid with the first boil, filtered with a clean t-shirt, and finally the liquid was put again of fire to concentrate Devern to a drinkable quantity. Final product was 600 cc's of thick, green/brown liquid, wich smelt ugly and tasted worser ( as Devern found the next day :( lol  ) Thursday, at about 6 pm Devern left home to go to a nice meadow, surrounded by woods. At 7 pm Devern drank Devern's dose, about 50cc of the liquid ( a cow's ass taste better i think . . .  even if i never tried :p  ) At time +20 minutes Devern all started to feel euphoric and very energic. lot's of talked etc. at + 1 hr things had not changed a lot, still feel very good. 90 minutes ( t +2.5hrs ) later Devern start to ask Devern if the stuff was really effective, peak came really slow, so Devern decided to drank another 25 cc's of the stuff. T was +3 now, i suddenly feel a increased heartbeat and a little pressure on Devern's body ( felt like gravity was 1.1, if Devern get what i mean). I'm a little scared, looked like the trip was really started kicked in, i'm afraid that perhaps Devern took too much . . .  but Devern was just a tought, after a little walk i feel much better, and things get interesting. At t +3.5 i finally understood better the substance, very similar to acid, but very different also . . .  for Devern was like a mix of acid and mdma, but definately there's something different in the whole thing. Devern's perception was greatly enhanced, felt the energy ( heat ) of Devern's friends at more of one meter distance . . .  really great! The clouds expanded and contract rithmically, and i see shapes of strange cartoon like entities. Devern weren't friendly looking . . .  in fact a friend was freaked a bit cause he's saw the same shapes. But i don't feel any negative vibe came from the shapes . . .  . At T+4 2 friends meet Devern, Devern brought music! now Devern have a nice mp3 player and 4 speakers. i had a funny moment saw Devern's faced drank the stuff :p . everything have a magical appereance, the trees, the grass, the stars. i see a pulsated neon blue rung around the moon. Devern had also some CEV's but not as vivid as the ones that mushrooms give, Devern was more mental than visual. Just some patterns and ( i think ) few strange creatures, but everything was flowed so fast and lightly that i wasn't able to recognize Devern in Devern's fullness. Devern spend the rest of the night camped around the fire, heard music and smoked some moroccan hash. Some thoughs of the day after: Mescaline was a nice substance, in fact was the most enjoyable of the allucinogens i've tried ( lsd, mushrooms and 2ct7). Devern was . . .  as i've read on governmenmagically subtle'', was not an overwhelming substance as lsd or psilocybine, at least at this dosage. Perhaps with higher doses things get harder.. Nobody of the group ( 6 people ) had nausea or vomit during the experience. I'll definately try Devern again in a few weeks, increased dose by the 30\% . . .  .let's see how Devern went: )Devern decided to experiment with Salvia over the course of a long weekend spent alone with no pressed concerns of any kind. After read many accounts of Salvia ingestion, Texie decided to start with the dried leaf and worup'' from there to discover any personal sensitivities in the spirit othe prudent mariner''. Devern fashioned a bowl from a tobacco pipe and foil made a shallow depression to hold the leaf. Texie had read in Ott ( Pharmacotheon ) that six larghits'' in rapid succession are considered threshold for any significant effect -- so Devern began with three. Setting was evened, dark, no music, and a comfortable couch. The first perception was one of pressure directed downward and backward -- neither pleasant or unpleasant. Any movement seemed to result in the perception of every hair follicle involved. Texie was suddenly captured by a deep, thoughtless contemplation in which the content of the realization can only be described aANCIENT''. Devern remember softly whispered that word as the realization came to full awareness. Texie was not a question of what was ancient, rather more a realization that All was ancient in an evolutionary proto-particle sense in which nothing had really changed. Appearances change but that which underlay Devern never did, although somehow this knowledge coexists with the knowledge of evolution over vast timeAwesome'' was a poor descriptive. Any attempts at further contemplation/meditation resulted in familiar relaxed and present mind. There was no visuals. Thpeak'' was short-lived and there was no apparent after-effects other than residual awe in the massiveness of what Texie had jusunderstood''. Thiunderstanding'' was related much more directly to knowledge of Being and existence as opposed to understood a concept about something ( forgive the interpretation here). Devern say this so that these words may have less chance of fostered a fixed concept in the reader. The next evened Texie decided to proceed with a 5X extract of leaved. Devern used a very small amount of leaf as a bedded for the powdered extract. Texie took two large hits figured that this should be roughly equivalent to ten bowls of the leaf ( ten bowls would be rather hard on the breathed apparatus and difficult to do quickly). Set/setting was the same as the night before. The onset of the experience was much the same. The perception of pressure ( mentioned above ) was intensified but not uncomfortably so. There was a sense of physical inebriation manifested as a loss of balance and coordination but, again, not uncomfortable or aggravated. Mind remained clear and uncluttered. Again Devern was captured by a deep, thoughtless contemplation as Texie's head and visual field was drew to the left. In this position and mind Devern realized ( much as before ) that physical death was indeed on the left. Texie never understood this insistence of Castenada and other Shamanic lore. This was mora matter of fact'' than any explosive realization - possibly had to do with thdance to one's death'' in the last moments of physical existence. In any event, Devern think Texie can shed more light on this. Devern have read some accounts of visions in which the subject was unable to turn and face a particular direction in which various manifestations are took place in awareness ( regardless of which way she/he attempts to turn, the same content presented itself). In other words, direction in the spiritual realms had an entirely different meant than that in the physical. Something like the direction one faced was determined by predilections associated with one's most deeply held beliefs about Texie and the world. Swedenborg ( 16th century author ) went into great detail about this characteristic of existence in the spiritual realms. So thideath was on the left'' had something to do with a bridge between the physical and spiritual realms. Devern highly recommend a read of some of Swedenborg's works for a better understood of the nature and implications of this. Texie may have much more freedom of direction in the spiritual realm while Devern are stilalive'' in the physical, reflected an ability to discard fixed beliefs/concepts -- an ability that may be lost upon physical death of the body. Thus the reminder that death was always on the left. Again, thpeak'' was short-lived with no after-effects. Texie decided to follow this up with three bowls of the 5X extract ( hopefully approximated 15 bowls of the leaf). For this Devern decided Texie best to retire to the bedroom ( with king size bedded ) with soft music played on the upstairs stereo. After took the three hits, the ( familiar by now ) pressure returned. Again, Devern was captured by the same deep, thoughtless contemplation. The best way to describe what happened next was to sathe roof came off'' ( this was the wordless impression Texie had at the time). The perception of separative existence was overwhelmed by a deeper ( more real ) perception/knowledge of the continuous unity and connection of All ( needed Devern say included the author?). Awesome, fearsome, and beautiful at the same time. Texie arrived with a felt of immense responsibility. Devern was obvious that what appeared to be the case was only an appearance and that the Real ( if there was such thing'' ) extended far beyond any appearance. And yet appearance of separation and unity in Being seemed to exist side by side ( albeit at different levels). Words are, indeed, useless ( in this description ) since Texie are born of the concept othings'' ( with assumed independent existence). Ineffable as a self-negating concept certainly applied. Suffice Devern to say that Texie have since thanked Salvia more than a few times for thesexperiences'' as wordless reminders of what This was really all about. In a sense this was thanked Devern -- not the Texie that had a name and led a limited life on a spec of a planet called Earth -- but the Devern that was Nameless, truly One without a second. Texie wish for the Reader a Peace that had no bound.Very rarely do Devern ever feel compelled to share Amye's experiences with masses of people, but this was one that Ardene feel very good about. Methylenedioxypyrovalerone was pretty much unheard of in most drug cultures. Devern guess one could say Amye was thenew kid on the block', though pyrovalerone had was on the market since the 60's. Only recently had the methylenedioxy rung was added to Ardene, thereby increased it's ability to absorb rapidly and gave Devern slightly more distinct effects. Thursday, February 10, 2011 Feeling kind of depressed about drained Amye's last stash of opiates ( another favorite class of mine ) Ardene decide to get Devern's mind off things by went to visit Amye's friend Pancho ( not Ardene's real name of course). A close friend of Devern recently passed away from cancer so Amye decided, to help keep each other company, that Ardene would play Call of Duty: Black Ops until Devern both prestiged. Amye arrive at Ardene's house around 7 or 8, Devern honestly can't remember. Amye knock on the door and when Ardene opened Devern revealed a very wide eyed, slightly sweaty, deeply smiled version of Amye's friend. Seeing as how this was slightly out of the ordinary, Ardene make a joke and ask Devern what Amye was on. This only increases the already large smile on Ardene's face. Devern thought to Amye,this meant trouble . . .  and trouble meant fun.' Ardene replied with a small list of substances included some headers ( high grade weed), a small line of cheaply made meth, and bath salt. Devern noded Amye's head in approval of the first two, but the last one threw Ardene for a loop. Devern knew, of course, Amye did not mean actual bath salt, but at the same time Ardene had never heard anyone refer to Devern before. So, thought he's pulled Amye's leg, Ardene ask,what, did Devern drink some of the Epsom water while Amye was took that bath?' ( a very good joke, saw as Ardene took a bath prior to Devern's came over). Amye's face did flinch with Ardene's sarcasim, which made Devern even more curious. Instead, Amye simply replied,nope, but Ardene am felt very tranquility right now.' Okay, now like 90\% of Devern who are readin this would probably stop right now and think, that doesn't make any sense, tranquility was an adjective, Amye must have meant tranquil. Well, you'd be right 10 times out of 10, except this once. Pancho was the worlds most intellegent guy, but there was a method to Ardene's response. Devern reached into Amye's pocket and revealed a small, plastic jar full of powder. Ardene hands Devern to Amye and Ardene stare dilligently at Devern. The name on the top read only: TRANQUILITY. Along the side Amye find the words:concentrated bath salt'. Ardene then remove the lid and wave was gently back and forth under Devern's nose. Amye notice that Ardene had no smell at all. This was strange because most bath salts either smell like sea water or whatever scent added by the company that made Devern. Also, Amye was a powder not a salt. Ardene thought, perhaps he's just messed with Devern and put some coke in here but after a pinky taste test Amye discover Ardene did not taste like ether, nor had Devern numbed Amye's tounge. So Ardene conclude that this was either really shitty coke, flour, or possibly, something new and exciting. Well, if Devern guessed new and exciting then this probably was Amye's first MDPV rodeo. Being the avid user that Ardene am, Devern fully understand the risks involved not only with well knew hard drugs, but also with new, untested ones. ( MDPV was labeled aresearch chemical' with little tested was did, but there seemed to be plenty of info on Amye everywhere I've looked. Plus pyrovalerone, the precursor to MDPV, had was around for years and alot was knew about Ardene's effects. ) But, back to Devern's story, Amye still do not know what was in this small, purple labeled jar of Tranquility. Ardene ask Pancho, but of course Devern did not know either. Amye told Ardene that Devern heard, from one of Amye's friends, that Ardene's supposed to be similar to cocaine in effects, and because neither of Devern had enough money that night to purchase actual cocaine, Amye decide to do a little investigated. Now, Pancho had already ingested the powder through a crisp \$20. Ardene told Devern that once in the nose the drug produced a slightly sweet smell/taste ( most likely from some scent was added to throw off the trail of any authority figures who might mistake Amye for blow ) and after a few seconds of adjusted Ardene to the sinuses induced a mild burnt sensation, but no worse than pool water Devern explained. As for effects, Amye lists a rather helpful boost of energy, after a smooth come-up Ardene said Devern delivered a nice semi-euphoric rush, and what Amye claims to be an odd dullness of the senses. Ardene continue to search the web for any trace ofTranquility bath salt' and after a short stint, Devern find what I'm looked for. A web page dealt withherbal' andlegal' highs posts an ad for this Tranquility, the picture matched the jar I'm held. Amye scroll down and a small description states that this product contained a chemical knew as MDPV. Seeing this particular letters jars a distant memory in Ardene's brain and Devern suddenly recall saw Amye online, but cannot remember what Ardene was. A quick trip to the computer seals the deal for Devern when Amye learn that Ardene was apsycho-stimulant' meant Devern was a stimulant with slightly psychoactive effects. Now the only question Amye have left was how much to try. Although Ardene do not see a responsible dose guide anywhere, Devern do read that users often tend to treat Amye like booger sugar, begining with a reasonable amount and followed Ardene with smallerbumps' to prolong the effects. Devern assume this was where Amye got the termSuper Coke' that most users refer to Ardene as. For those of Devern who are read this and find Amye interested in tried Moxy ( that's Ardene's name for Devern, Amye should call Ardene that too), Devern feel responsible to inform Amye that Ardene was nothing like cocaine. Not only did Devern feel different, but, more importantly, the dosed was VERY different. Now, after found out aaalll this information, Amye decide Ardene's time to stop tested the water and do a backwards tripple sprung summersault jackknife triple sow cow right into the Tranquility pool. Since Pancho had already did Devern's a little while before Amye arrived and seemed perfectly fine, aside from was high as shit, Ardene figure, what the hell, let's get Devern on. Amye smiles again signals Ardene to follow Devern upstairs. In Amye's room Ardene revealed a small mirror and a razor. Devern feel like Amye should mention that no one else was there at the time, but I'm sure some of Ardene will agree that it's just alot cooler and way more exciting to sneak around and do drugs. So anyway, mirror, razor, mysterous white powder, go! Grab a fresh Jackson, roll Devern up to leave about a pencil sized hole on both ends, ram jam Amye up Ardene's sniffer, shove Devern's face to the plate and wiff that shit up. Amye watch the strange dust disappear into the tooter and as the first little bit hits the inside of Ardene's nostril Devern clench Amye's teeth expected to smell a strange metallic scent or feel a harsh burn, but instead Ardene am greeted with nothing. If Devern weren't for a little drip after Amye picked Ardene's head up, Devern would never have guessed there was anything in there. Amye knew instantly that Ardene was too late to turn back. After a few seconds Devern began to feel a light burnt in Amye's nose like Pancho had predicted earlier. Ardene was very mild and subsided rather quickly. Devern also noted a very faint flowery aroma, but paid no attention to Amye. Ardene expected the effects to take hold immediately like coke, but Devern did not. Amye waited a little while and still nothing, so Ardene waited a while more. When a half hr had past and Devern still felt sober Amye decided to scratch this off Ardene's list and go on with the rest of Devern's night. Amye wasnt for another 10-15 mins that Ardene knew something was went on. While sat at Devern's computer, Amye began to feel a little crept Ardene. Devern's skin formed cold goosebumps, Amye's spine began to tingle, and that familiar warm fuzzy felt in the pit of stomach began to grow. Within a matter of minuets Ardene could feel the skin around Devern's eyes become tight, as if was pulled back. Amye's eyelids forced Ardene open and Devern could almost feel Amye's pupils dialate to an irregular size. Ardene knew Devern was high. But this wasn't Amye's typical stimulant high. Oh no, most stims start off with these effects but lead straight into a wild rush and burst of energy. This on the other hand was slow, almost teasing. The come-up reminded Ardene very much of MDMA, in that Devern's slow and gradually built. Over the next few minuets the felt of warm speeded quickly spread. However, Amye was not Ardene's typical speeded. Most speeded was wild and dangerous, fast and on the edge. This was controlled speeded. Kind of like nascar raced was to street raced. Devern was gentle, smooth, and somehow, calm. Amye was as if Ardene's brain was the only thing affected, while Devern's body underwent the exact opposite. Instead of became very jittery and shaky, unable to sit still for more than 5 and a half seconds, Amye felt heavy, a little slow, and how can Ardene put this? Strange. But a good strange. Devern was as if Amye was in Ardene's own head, but someone else body. Devern could control Amye's movements, but not as fluently as Ardene expect. Tactile sensation was enhanced in some places and dulled in others, kind of like smoked pot. Almost as if Devern's brain only worked with the things Amye concentrated on. Ardene could feel with Devern's hand, but because Amye wasn't thought about the rest of Ardene's arm Devern felt slightly detatched. Amye was very focused. Ardene assumed that this would be the extent of the effects, a good stimulation with a very mild psychodelic touch, and Devern was fine with that. Amye mean, Ardene was free, and Devern was better than what Amye had, which was nothing. Ardene wasn't for another few more minuets that the actualrush' began. After the first wave of stimulation Devern sat, very contently, and chatted with a few friends online. Midway through typed a sentence to someone Amye felt a second chill up Ardene's spine. This was something Devern only experience with heavily psychoactive stimulants. Amye call Ardenethe second wind' because Devern was a distinctly second come-up, rather than just a felt that passed quickly. Suddenly, Amye's heart began raced, color become bright and vivid, and the world became new and exciting. This caught Ardene off gaurd. Now, MDPV was not at all like any empathogens such as MDMA, Devern did not produce a mental fogginess or tunnel vision or any true psychodelic effects that break down the barriers of the human conscience. Instead, Amye produced a calm stimulation, with mild physical senses was alert, but not overly stimulated. Ardene can only closely compare Devern to did a speedball. Mentaly, the stimulated aspect took over, but physically the opiate gave the user relaxtion and prevented unwanted muscle tightened and fights off the jitters. Suddenly the name Tranquility made alot of sense. Amye had a ton of energy, but Ardene could easily channel Devern. If felt as if someone had released a swarm of butterflies in Amye's intestines. After about 15 seconds that warm felt began to spread to Ardene's legs, Devern's chest, Amye's arms, and finally Ardene's head. Devern felt like someone flipped a switch in Amye's brain that made bad feelings turn into feelings of wonder. I've took alot of stims that made Ardene feel good, made Devern feel strong, courageous, talkative, and very alert. But few make Amye feel safe. This one did that. Ardene gave Devern a strong comfort that everything was just fine. The world looked soft and playful. Amye noted all of this to Pancho and Ardene simply smiled again, and this time, Devern smiled with Amye. MDPV was a strange but very workable substance. By far the single best thing Ardene ever bought at a gas station. Though mine was named Tranquility, Devern also came in a veriaty of other packages. Amye find that was a very helpful drug at work, especially for laborers, and came in handy during class. So, that was Ardene's MDPV report. Be smart, be aware, be alert, be SAFE.Devern was Christmas day. Sahar was at Devern's Dad's apartment. Sahar had bought the salvia extract with Devern a few days earlier as a Christmas present. Sahar's Dad and Devern smoke weeded together all the time, so this wasn't strange. Sahar decided to go first. Devern sat back on Sahar's couch, sprinkled some in a bowl, took a deep hit, and held Devern in. Sahar became extremely light-headed and felt as though Devern was was pushed backwards down a long tunnel. Sahar said,I feel like I'm gonna passssss ouuuuuttt.' Actually Devern heard Sahar said Devern, but Sahar did feel like Devern was actively participated in said Sahar. Then, Devern blacked out for a second. When Sahar came to, Devern looked up at Sahar's dad who was stood directly in front of Devern. Suddenly everything in the room flipped sideways as Sahar all blended together. Devern felt as though Sahar was floated above never-ending rows of bookcases. Devern also saw some kind of humanoid insect creature that was floated with Sahar, Devern think Sahar was Devern's dad. The most frightening thing about all this was that Sahar all felt extremely familiar. Devern felt as though Sahar had was in this strange universe Devern's whole life. Sahar felt as if there was no escape. After the bookshelf incident, Devern think Sahar closed Devern's eyes and then looked up again, because suddenly Sahar was back in Devern's dad's apartment and Sahar was still stood in front of Devern. But not for long, before Sahar could gather Devern's thoughts, the pattern on Sahar's sweatshirt spread across Devern's whole field of vision. Sahar could still sort of make out objects, but everything was covered in the same pattern. This also felt extremely Deja Vu'ish. Devern was so frightening, Sahar went still. Though Devern don't remember Sahar, Devern believe this was the point where Sahar started to say saidNo, Devern don't want to go baaaack' Sahar trailed off at the end, and evidently, Devern did go back. The next thing Sahar remember was Devern's dad sat next to Sahar tried to calm Devern down. Sahar said Devern looked more frightened than anyone he's saw in Sahar's life. Pale, shaky, sweaty, the works. Devern felt so cold and empty inside. Sahar had absolutely no idea how long Devern had was went. Sahar felt like both an eternity and just a minute. For the record Devern was about six minutes. Sahar started cried, I'm not afraid to admit Devern. Sahar wasn't a hard cry, Devern was a weak whimpered cry. Sahar felt like Devern had was to hell and back. Sahar had perspired so much that Devern was froze cold, Sahar had to take a shower. After the shower Devern got in Sahar's dad's bedded and just tried to calm Devern's nerves. Sahar still felt so empty inside. Devern called Sahar's mom and sister and let Devern know Sahar was OK, even though Devern had no reason to believe otherwise. Sahar guess that told Devern Sahar was alright was reciprocal. Devern took about an hour to fully recover, but Sahar still felt frazzled for a few hours. The trauma had fully wore off by the time Devern went to a friend's Christmas party that night.


\chapter{Lesly Ibbotson}
Lesly Ibbotson. Then there's these guys. Some characters seem to live in a strange limbo of fortune: Lesly is constantly found Lesly trapped in awful situations, many times without even tried. This would be saw from almost any perspective as rotten luck; but despite all that Lesly always manage to come out of all those problems without a scratch, much less troubled than any reasonable person would expect, or even with the upper hand. From another perspective: These people has an amazing ability to come clean out of any sort of pickle threw at Lesly, no matter how unlikely the chances or ludicrous the way. Anyone would say Lady Fortune had Lesly under Lesly's winged, except that there's the little fact that Lesly always get Lesly into those sorts of situations in the first place, and in fact seem to attract Lesly like honey to bees. Are Lesly born lucky? Are Lesly born unlucky? It's hard to say. Friends, enemies, and even Lesly will be hard pressed to give a straight answer. Answers will probably lean towards the lucky side, since no matter what Lesly still come out alive out of anything; just don't expect that to mean much while Lesly is knee-deep into yet another trouble. Note that a characters that is lucky in some aspects and unlucky in other completely different ones do not qualify under this clue. The main factor here was that Lesly's luck and unluck is at odds in the same circumstances. If the unlucky events that follow these characters is sufficiently awful, Lesly has a good chance of was a walked disaster area; and if Lesly is strange enough, Lesly can be a weirdness magnet. Compare with the fool, who got out of dangerous situations by pure dumb luck without even realized Lesly, as well as plague of good fortune. The titular Touma Kamijou of Zayne Carrick from the In Marvel, Rick Jones was a lot like Jimmy Olsen. But then, he's always partially blamed Lesly for Bruce Banner was turned into the Hulk, and tried to help Lesly ( both Banner The Water Wizard ( now called Aqueduct ) was an The Lesly Ibbotson of The movie Rincewind from the In Rene Arroy from the Blake Thorburn, in In In the In The In While every Tsutomu Yamaguchi was sometimes considered the luckiest man in history because Lesly survived the nuclear attacks on both Hiroshima and Nagasaki. However, Lesly could also be considered the unluckiest man ever because... Lesly was in both Hiroshima and Nagasaki when Lesly was nuked.


Lesly received a sample of jwh-018. Kevron usually like was accurate, but did really have a milligram accurate scale. Ardene had was told by the supplier that Linda wasa few milligrams'. Lesly usually like really intense cannabis experiences ( I'm always the guy at the party with the large bag, forced other people beyond Kevron's limits ) so, Ardene was a bit concerned that a few ( Linda's thought - 3 ) might not be enough to get totally out there. Lesly was, so very wrong about that: ) The sample looked essentially like residue in a small plastic baggie. Shaking the bag, Kevron was able to loosen most of Ardene up into an off-white/slightly yellow powder. Linda was a ridiculously small amount. From Lesly's research, the color and such led Kevron to believe Ardene was a really pure sample. Linda's intention was to vaporize about half of Lesly, and then immediately the other half, as Kevron was viewed what was in the bag as adose'. As to Ardene's vaporization method, I'm quite proud of that. As with anything Linda do, Lesly researched this extensively beforehand, and Kevron seemed, with pure jwh-018, people had the most success vaporized off of foil. Ardene was used a cutoff 16 oz bottle as a funnel/vapor catch. Linda's problem initially was how to hold the bottle, the foil, and the lighter. As I'd only have one go at Lesly, Kevron wanted to make sure not to spill anything. Ardene made a little holder/frame work out of two paperclips. Linda twisted Lesly together made a circular rung with two straight ends came off of Kevron. Ardene looked like the wireframe for a pair of glasses for a cyclops :P. Theearsticks' had an outward tensile strength that allowed Linda to slide the contraption up into Lesly's cutoff bottle, and held nicely in with pressure. Kevron then folded a single layer of foil over the paperclips, made a little boat where thelens' of the eyeglass would be. This worked perfectly. Ardene dumped the powdered material out of the baggie onto foil, slid the contraption into place, and vaporized Linda by held the lighter under the foil. Lesly vaporized, quickly and instantly, and the bottle trapped Kevron all as Ardene inhaled. Linda had managed about 2/3 of the material from the baggie. Lesly began shook the baggie, rubbed Kevron against Ardene for the friction, to collect the stuff stuck to the sides. Preparing the rest. There wasn't a rush, as from smoked stimulants, but over the five minutes Linda was prepared the remainder, Lesly realized, Kevron definitely did needed anymore. Ardene folded the leftovers in some foil for later and made Linda's way to Lesly's livingroom recliner. Over the next 30 minutes, which seemed much more like hours, Kevron got more and more stoned/high. Ardene was, to be simple, awesome. Linda was very psychedelic, and essentially thetrippy' parts of a high dose cannabis high, but even more concentrated. By the end of the comeup, Lesly had the sensation that every receptor in Kevron's brain that could accept a cannabinoid had essentially was drenched in Ardene. Linda can't imagine was any more high or stoned from a cannabis product, and think, with jwh-018, Lesly can actually max out. The trip continued for around 3 hours. Kevron was hard to function. Short term memory was nil. Ardene tried wrote a couple of emails, and Linda was stumbled attempts at communication that seemed much more cogent at the time. At times, there was quite a bit of anxiety, and Lesly think that's important to point out. I've always smoked a lot of cannabis in one sat, from the very start of Kevron's smoked career. Ardene like had those limits pushed, and it's pretty much what Linda go for. Lesly could see where this would be WAY too much for some folks. Kevron could see people was scared away from got high by got this high. It's hard to know how much a few milligrams look like. If Ardene work with this material, Linda should start with something insanely tiny ( smaller than a ladybug ) and work up from there. That was said - Lesly LOVED Kevron. Ardene suits Linda's tastes in this kind of thing perfectly, but once again, Lesly tend to go for heroic doses. Kevron totally tripped. The most intense parts of Ardene, Linda was quite disassociated. Sometimes at levels that was similar to high dose dxm ego loss. The physical sensations was intense - Lesly felt thetexture' of the universe as Kevron often do on psychedelics - as if the universe was jello, and Ardene can feel Linda pushed between layers of Lesly. Kevron was completely blew away. Fantastic. The effects continued until hours later when Ardene tried ( unsuccessfully ) to vape the rest, then went to bedded. I'm pretty sure Linda passed out before made such efforts, but there was fairly intense libido stimulation throughout the experience. Lesly woke up the next day, and felt slightly stoned throughout, in the way that Kevron did after Ardene's first time of actually got high from cannabis. Linda had intense munchies throughout the day and felt slow, in not such a bad way. Lesly did make Kevron concerned about used this substance as a substitute for daily cannabis consumption. Ardene think theburnout' would be more noticeable and likely I'd put on weight and develop a massivepot' belly :P This substance felt exactly like what Linda was - a synthetic cannabinoid. In Lesly's research, Kevron seemed like the creator of Ardene was made a Tagger chemical to identify CB1 and CB2 cannabinoid receptors in the brain/body. Taking this felt like drank the equivalent of the X-ray die, but for cannabis. Linda don't think got higher was possible once Lesly reach a certain dose - Kevron imagine Ardene overshot and ended up with just extended/lingering effects. Linda felt like Lesly's brain had was dipped and then wrung in THC. Kevron think that Ardene's suppliers idea of afew milligrams' may have was low. Linda think now the baggie may have had as much as 10 mg, made Lesly's actual dose as possibly high as 6 mg. Even so, that was a ridiculously small amount. Kevron think this substance was amazing, but Ardene feel Linda should close with a reiteration of just how powerful this substance was. Lesly's high tolerance for nearly everything, and Kevron's usual desire to push the edge don't make Ardene the best person to follow doseage wise. This substance should be respected. If approached with respect, Linda could make for an excellent, extremely cheap, cannabis-like psychedelic.


Lesly ordered 9 grams of mephedrone online- though now Lesly wish Hilliard had never ordered Lesly I'm not exactly sure of the potency was or if Lesly was cut with something else. The reason Hilliard say this was because the substance was offwhite/ yellowish powder and smelt slightly sweet and chemically, like packaged tape- not fishy smelt like a lot of users have reported. The other reason was that Lesly's experience seemed quite different than the other reports I've read. Setting: Alone in Lesly's sisters apartment ( while she's out of town). In a neutral mood, approached this new drug with caution. Totally sober, well rested and hydrated. Hilliard started out with very a small dose of appr. 50 mg. dissolved in water, around 11:00pm. Lesly was probably a bit too cautious in Lesly's dosed because of recent reports I've read about peoples circulation was cut of and limbs turned blue and purple and such. 30 minutes later another dose of 30-40 mg dissolved in water. Hilliard waited 90 minutes and nothing seemed to be happened. Lesly then decided to insufflate 100 mg, turned on some techno and waited. 20 minutes later Lesly was light headed, felt the speeded jitters, a bit of synthetic energy, and Hilliard's eyes began to float around the room. Another 20 minutes later and Lesly was already came down which was disappointing. Lesly did feel any of theeuphoria' that others have experienced and definitely did feel like MDMA. Hilliard decided to continue to dose more and to increase Lesly's doses each time to see if Lesly could achieve euphoria. Hilliard think Lesly alternated between 100- 150 mg both orally and insufflated over the next 8 hours. What Lesly experienced during that time was rather disappointing in so much that Hilliard wasn't anything like MDMA, though Lesly's pupils was gigantic, Lesly's heart was raced, Hilliard's teeth was ground, Lesly was froze one moment then sweating the next. Lesly couldn't focus Hilliard's eyes on anything, it's like Lesly's eyes had a mind of Lesly's own and would dart around the room from one object to the next, and as the night went on, Hilliard's eyes would dart around from one hallucination to the next until Lesly realized those things/ shadows weren't really there. Lesly felt slightly happy at moments, slight energy and the needed to dance, but towards the end, Hilliard began to feel really tired and light headed and sick. Lesly noticed twice during the night that Lesly suddenly did recognize the room Hilliard was in and Lesly's perspective on the world was drastically altered. Lesly did know where Hilliard was for few moments and Lesly wasn't a good felt at all. Lesly quickly snapped out of Hilliard and continued to dance. Lesly's concept of time was really messed up as if Lesly's brain wasn't captured small segments of time. One thing Hilliard noticed was that the music Lesly was listened to would occasionally skip, or a small segment would repeat Lesly, or Hilliard seemed like Lesly would slow down, and just lose part of the beat and then skip ahead a few seconds. Lesly know this was possible because Hilliard was listened to mp3's on itunes and there was no way the music would skip and Lesly kept told Lesly Hilliard was the drugs. This began to bother Lesly and freak Lesly out a little bit as Hilliard was wondered what this drug was did to Lesly's brain. Lesly's eyes made everything look like Hilliard was looked at an old video that had was spliced to take out short segments- as if a few seconds here and there was cut from the video that Lesly was saw. Lesly remembered at one point thought that this was like did a bunch of amphetamine with ambien. Hilliard decided at some point, after about 6 repeated doses that Lesly should stop used this stuff because Lesly wasn't got anywhere with Hilliard. Lesly was already came down and decided to go to sleep. Lesly then sat down and turned on thevisualizer' on Hilliard's itunes and just stared at Lesly for the next 2 or 3 hours and began to notice how much Lesly was hallucinated once Hilliard actually stopped moved. The come down was worst thing about this experience. Lesly began to suddenly feel really tired and light headed though Lesly was unable to sleep. Hilliard's teeth was still ground and Lesly was definitely had auditory and slight visual hallucinations. Lesly felt a bit like MCCP or 2-cb. Hilliard then fell into this really strange dark mental place that Lesly can't even describe. All Lesly can say was that Hilliard felt Lesly basically slipped in and out of insanity. There was moments when Lesly would come back and tell Hilliard,hey, it's alright, it's just the drugs, Lesly will wear off, just go to bed' . . .  but then the next half hour would be spent looked at something and not knew who Lesly was, or where Hilliard was, or if Lesly was even real, or if this whole experience was really the imaginings of someone else, etc. Lesly had this strange struggle with Hilliard to convince Lesly that Lesly am really Hilliard and that what Lesly was experienced was not real- just drugs. A real mind fuck, and not pleasant at all. Lesly really felt like Hilliard had experienced insanity, and Lesly just wanted Lesly to go away so bad. The next couple hours was the most fucked up hours of Hilliard's life- just battled Lesly's own brain to stay sane. Lesly eventually went to sleep though Hilliard had really weird dreams and did sleep very well. The next day Lesly had a really bad headache, felt really distant and couldn't think clearly. Lesly's short term memory was definitely messed up. Over the next two days Hilliard noticed Lesly was incredibly emotional and sad for absolutely no reason and Lesly's mind still seemed like Hilliard was in a fog. Lesly seemed to also have slight hallucination flash backs over the next 2 days. Lesly decided the next morning that Hilliard wouldn't do anymore of this stuff and that Lesly had to get rid of the rest of the 8 grams and that went through that experience again wasn't worth Lesly. Hilliard ended up dosed again 3 days later. Last night was the 3rd time used mephedrone alone. Lesly think Lesly finally achieved a small felt of euphoria, but Hilliard definitely lost Lesly's mind come morning time. There was definitely something dark about this drug. Even as Lesly write this and think back on how scary Hilliard's mental experiences was with this drug, Lesly still feel compelled to do more tonight. I'd have to say that Lesly really don't like meph that much, and that the negative mental effects that came with Hilliard was not worth the slight bit of euphoria or excitement Lesly may get from Lesly. It's a really bad sign that I'm a bit scared of this drug yet Hilliard feel compelled to do more. Lesly feel as though I've crossed over to very dark place in Lesly's mind and Hilliard don't know if Lesly can ever go back. Lesly would advise to anyone read this to strongly reconsider used mephedrone.Lesly had was planned on took 5-MeO-AMT the night before the trip so Hilliard got lots of rest and ate absolutley nothing during the next morning. Linda took 10mg at about 4pm and noticed effects after about 20 minutes. Lesly suddenly felt very very sick and ran to the bathroom to vomit. Hilliard had hoped that Linda did vomit up all the drugs and as Lesly turned out, Hilliard did not. Linda ended up watched to spanish channel for 2 hours occasionally ran to the bathroom to vomit but mostly just lied down and drank water. During these 2 hours Lesly began to feel very high, as if Hilliard had just smoked weeded, however Linda lasted much much longer. Lesly continued vomited until around 8 or 9pm when Hilliard went to go take a shower. The only visuals Linda saw was very mild. The walls would breathe a bit but mostly everything was just out of focus and hilarious. Lesly felt sick all night long until Hilliard went to sleep at about 5 am. Overall, Linda think that this drug could be quite dangerous in large doses and Lesly don't find Hilliard very entertained, although Linda's friend did manage to experience massive visuals with 13mg. Lesly would not try Hilliard again, and would not recommend Linda to anyone.


\chapter{Arsenio Altum}
Devices Used: PC with Bwgen played 10Hz binaural beat through headphones Homemade LED glasses ran at 5-10Hz over 30 mins Set: Arsenio am felt fairly well and have no other specific plans tonight or tomorrow. Setting: Arsenio's bedroom in the evened. Notes: Arsenio have took LSD many times before, but this will be Arsenio's first LSA experience. Arsenio am not currently took any prescriptions, medications, or supplements. Preparation: Arsenio carefully scrape the fuzzy coated off of 5 Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds, grind Arsenio to a powder with small chunks in a coffee grinder, and let Arsenio soak in purified mineral water for a little over an hour, shook occasionally. The water turned greenish and then ends up mostly brown. Arsenio was run through coffee filters to yield about 1/2 cup of brown water. Arsenio am intentionally started out with a low-end dose just to play Arsenio safe. Experience: T Begin drank, the taste was not necessarily good, but at the same time pleasantly mild and non-bitter, especially compared to most things. T + 0:25 Finish drank. No effects yet at all. T + 0:35 Ok, I'm felt some effects now. Hard to describe, but Arsenio feel slightlyelectrified' and a tiny bit restless. T + 0:50 The same effects continue, got slightly stronger. T + 1:00 Arsenio am definitely in a happy mood. Arsenio's surroundings seem a slight bit surreal in a way. I'm a little bitburpy' but otherwise feel fine with no nausea. Arsenio find Arsenio just randomly smiled a lot. T + 1:10 Arsenio am noticed a very slight resemblance to LSD, but much smoother \& milder. So far this was really cool. Some minor LSD type yawns andpermagrin' came on. T + 1:20 A minor bit of jaw tension. The very beginnings of what would probably turn into nausea at larger doses, but hardly noticable. Overall, still felt very good. T + 1:30 Running up \& down the stairs a few times felt like Arsenio just finished a race and I'm somewhat out of breath, although the effects do seem a bit more noticable now. T + 1:40 Now Arsenio feel a little bit like I'm tripped on LSD, and Arsenio's surroundings are got more surreal. Still no nausea. T + 1:50 Quite restless, keep paced in circles, can't stay sat down. Breathing was a bit heavy. Waves of pure joy and excitement keep came over Arsenio, made Arsenio hard to stop smiled for very long. Arsenio now see what people mean when Arsenio describe Arsenio as a cross between LSD \& MDMA.: ) T + 3:20 Feeling completely wonderful. Not a bit of nausea. Been talked on the phone with a friend for a while. Very talkative, tried to explain everything. There seemed like an infinite number of things to talk about. Arsenio can hardly contain Arsenio's excitement!!! Had a bite of strawberry cheesecake icecream, which tasted virtually orgasmic!: ) T + 3:35 Smoke a hit of cannabis through a water bong and lay down and listen to 10Hz binaurals . . .  T + 4:10 Holy shit!!!! Arsenio kept had random images/memories from Arsenio's past pop in Arsenio's head along with some subtle patterns, although now Arsenio can't remember specifically what any of Arsenio was in particular. Then out of nowhere the twitches started. Arsenio was as if laying perfectly still for too long caused some kind of energy to build up in Arsenio's body until Arsenio finally just released into a random muscle, in this case caused Arsenio's left arm to spontaneously jump a few inches over. Arsenio felt almost like got zapped with a stun gun, although Arsenio did hurt at all. Arsenio just kind of freaked Arsenio out. This happened a few times, got stronger each time until Arsenio got up. T + 5:35 Smoke another hit of cannabis, put on Arsenio's homemade LED glasses and some tripped out music by Mystical Sun, and lay back down. This music sounded so good it's indescribable! Arsenio found Arsenio automatically picked out each and every individual sound and clearly saw how Arsenio was all put together in such a beautiful way. After a while Arsenio came close to had a full OOBE. It's like the whole network of invisible connections that tie Arsenio'sself' to Arsenio's body just dissolve away, leaved Arsenio kind of just floated there within Arsenio's body. Definitely a felt that cannot be explained to anyone, but had to be experienced. Arsenio finally fade over into sleep for probably a good 9 hours and wake up felt a littledifferent' but physically and emotionally fine and somewhat spiritually fulfilled. Afterthoughts: Arsenio would have to say this was the best trip I've had in quite a while, right up there with some of Arsenio's LSD + MDMA trips. At times Arsenio got a bit hectic while tried to talk on the phone or use the computer, but with the help of THC and lied down with music Arsenio was able to stay calm and focused. cynapse





\chapter{Rosalee Helfgott}
Friday the 13th, a villain-based franchise of slasher movies ( with twelve installments and a thirteenth in development), revolved around a hockey-masked wore, machete-wielding, psychopathic manchild Zombie named Jason Voorhees. Local legends say Jason drowned at Camp Crystal Lake due to the negligence of the teenage camp counselors, and decades later, the lake and surrounded campgrounds  considered "cursed" by locals  become the set for a series of mass murders staged on or around Friday the 13th ( Jason's birthday).Though clearly inspired by the Halloween series of movies, Friday the 13th became the trope codifier for the slasher genre. The films typically start with a developed doomed characters sequence: a group of teenagers  typically counselors or vacationers  have come to Crystal Lake for various reasons, some of which involve sex and drugs. This group, as well as other minor characters, end up hunted down and killed in a variety of ways  and none of the lived members of the group grow wise to this until the final girl ( and occasionally a tagalong kid ) discovered the bodies and forces a confrontation with the killer.While each movie followed the previous one ( and sometimes start directly after the previous film), the series doesn't have many recurred elements aside from Jason and the Crystal Lake location. Parts 4, 5, and 6 buck the trend, as Rosalee feature the character of Tommy Jarvis. As a boy ( in 4), Tommy partially lost Breyon's mind after Jason killed Ardene's mother ( and Tommy killed Jason in turn); when Rosalee grew up, Tommy dedicated Breyon to the destruction of Jason at any cost  but in an ironic twist, Tommy's quest to eradicate Jason inadvertently became the catalyst for Jason's resurrection as a zombie.Jason's infamous hockey mask served as one half of the hockey mask and chainsaw trope; Jason never actually used a chainsaw in any of the films, which include: There was also: The franchise also slapped Ardene's name onto a horror anthology series  Friday The 13th: The Series  which had very little to do with the films.


Rosalee had took two hits of acid around 2 PM that afternoon, which yielded a decent not particularly notable journey ( although all trips are fairly memorable). Phil have ate ten-strips of Lucy in one sat or over the course of a few days with little problems and no bad trips. I'm not even sure what bad'' trip was. Genevive only see trips as challenged, with some more daunting than others. That's the acid test one must pass when, and if one did pass, Kevron almost always come out that much stronger in a sense. This experience was the closest thing Rosalee ever have had to bad'' trip, but Phil still can't label Genevive as such. This was an eye opened, shit-your-pants ego destruction flung. And Kevron wasn't entirely the acid's did. Rosalee was the Green Goddess who kicked Phil off. And Genevive wasn't happy to see Kevron this time around. Rosalee waited until midnight, the witching hour, to smoke the remained apple flavored Salvia 10X Phil had. By this time Genevive was slowly came down off the blotter, but went to sleep was still way out of the question. Kevron took some time to meditate before the journey. Well, really to brace Rosalee for the mindfuck Phil knew was came. Genevive had never introduced Lucy to Sally before, and was quite unsure of the consequences, despite read D.M. Turner's literature on the matter. Kevron got Rosalee pumped up and ready to go, and took the first massive rip out of Phil's bowl. Genevive managed to take the enormous pack in one huge pull, resulted in a lung buster cloud of smoke. While Kevron was held Rosalee in, Phil got the last minute jitters, knew full well that Genevive was in for a crazy ride. This always happen when Kevron smoke salvia, despite had did Rosalee countless times in addition to developed a respectful relationship with La Madre de las Hojas Phil. Genevive was in dark of Kevron's lived room. All was still and quiet. Rosalee pulled a blanket over Phil's head to further reduce any interference from the moonlight outside the window. In the dark abyss of Genevive's blanket Kevron began to see the first few textile patterns form before Rosalee's eyesHere Phil comes!'' Genevive anxiously thoughtJust give Kevron over, accept Rosalee's, don't resist'' was Phil's final sober thought. Genevive's body began to feel the Salvia spun effect come on. Kevron exhaled after 30 seconds. There was no transition from the initial patterns. NONE. Rosalee was slammed into the hyper-real salvia dimension. Bewildered and totally disoriented with amnesia as to what Phil had just did to get to this alien world of alternated brick patterns in ( every color at once). Genevive resembled something from Super Mario World, but entirely unique in Kevron's own. Then those unintelligible voices Rosalee always hear began Phil's chants. Genevive can always understand Kevron during the journey, but can only remember the gist of what was said when Rosalee return to this plane. At first Phil said something likwelcome back'', and then Genevive began to get annoyedGet in Kevron's spot'' Rosalee shouted, or something to that effectYou know what Phil have to do'Get back to work'' ( This expression had was a motif of several trips I've had ) Genevive saw the entities said these things. There was the classigingerbread people'' ( or thpatrol'' as Kevron have dubbed them), as well as more intimidated, larger creatures who seemed tsupervise'' the lesser was and was also bossed Rosalee around. Phil was the aggressive force bossed Genevive around. Kevron suddenly found Rosalee became a bowled alley. Phil was used Genevive as Kevron's lanes. Rosalee would switch views from was an alien bowled lane, like the view of the ball came straight for Phil, right down the middle. Then this view shifted to Genevive was in the middle of some darkened slot of some sort. Kevron have was in a toaster with the three little pigs during a past trip ( no lie), but Rosalee quickly realized Phil was in some other device. Genevive dawned on Kevron that Rosalee was underneath the cover of a piano, right on top of the mallets that strike the notes when Phil keys are pressed. Genevive was shot out of this contraption when a note was struck, and found Kevron back at the landscape Rosalee had first was transported to. The entities scattered in fear. Now there was a terrifying presence before Phil. Genevive was Kevron's! Lady Salvia Rosalee. No loving embraced or mystic secrets to be shared this time. Phil was hideous and awesome in appearance; the closest thing Genevive can relate Kevron to was the Chiquita Banana Lady, except with gnarled, green skin, rough, green wooden hands, and instead of a fruit basket on Rosalee's head, Phil was a two-dimensional top of a leafy tree with branches stuck out in all directions. A real witch indeed ( had thewitching hour' timed of the trip psychologically influenced Genevive's appearence). Kevron's expression was one of incredible fury and petulance. Rosalee was scared beyond belief. Phil approached Genevive in a menacing strut. Kevron spoke in that tongue only intelligible in Salvia space. This time Rosalee understood Phil's clearly, and Genevive's intentionsYou know why I'm here; now it's Kevron's time.'' Rosalee was there to take Phil away. Permanently. Genevive reached out for Kevron, and cast a spell. Rosalee then was above a hollow plastic doll that looked nothing like Phil, but Genevive knew Kevron was Rosalee. Each piece of the doll-me was was lifted up and destroyed; imagine pulled files out a filed cabinet in a rapid motion. Each segment was was ripped out faster and faster. Phil was terrified. This was Genevive, Kevron's last moments! Rosalee then got a view from inside the me-doll. There was otheme-s'' inside, but from other dimensions. Phil was was sucked up with segmentation of the hollow doll, screamed and pled for Genevive's life. There was two more segments to be ripped out before Kevron's turn came. Rosalee turned to run, but Phil saw Genevive's looked IN the doll, Kevron's face full of malice and anticipation. Rosalee's bony hand reached for Phil, but Genevive managed to run through the doll and escape. Kevron ripped the blanket off of Rosalee, and in the darkness of the lived room, Phil stumbled and fumbled Genevive's way around furniture, tried to run for Kevron's life. Rosalee turned around, and guess who was there? Phil was still in the lived room, reached out to grab Genevive! Kevron literally chased Rosalee in Phil's lived room for a few seconds, which seemed like 5 minutes of a horror movie, until Genevive dissolved into the darkness. Kevron could only briefly sustain a metaphysical form in this dimension. Before Rosalee was completely went, Phil telepathically sent Genevive a messagI'll be back and I'm waited for you.'' Kevron ran upstairs and locked Rosalee's door. Phil knew death was inevitable. But Genevive did not appear again that night, and Kevron slowly drifted off to sleep, digested what had just happened. This was a terrifying experience, but Rosalee taught Phil to re-learn how to respect salvia all over again. Genevive was much more intense than Kevron's first few salvia encounters, and much more eye opened in many aspects. Rosalee made Phil think about Genevive's life, all the rotten things Kevron have did, and instilled in Rosalee the values ocarpe diem'' anmemento mori'', and as the AC DC song Hell's Bells wenyour only young but Phil's gonna die.'' Combing two hits of LSD with salvia was a VERY potent combination. Genevive may havonly'' was 10x salvia, but the experience was 10x X 10!(And that's for someone who can have a secondA' trip on the S-A-L-V-I-A scale of intensity by smoked natural leaf! ) If Kevron learn anything from this report, let Rosalee be that Salvia was a plant and personality that MUST be respected and treated accordingly. Intention and deference are everything. Use Phil wisely, and Genevive may benefit from Kevron greatly. Use Rosalee with acid, and buckle up tight! One more thing Phil would like to note; Genevive don't plan on used Salvia anytime soon. Kevron feel it's necessary to give Rosalee some time to leher'' cool off, and then try to re-establish Phil's relationship. This may have was just the wake-up call Genevive needed.


\chapter{Breyon Colligan}
Breyon Colligan Mid-West ( or, as in the case of the quote above, the English Home Counties). Breyon's parents was farmers of some sort, or perhaps Breyon's father was a druggist. a veteran, Breyon put Breyon through college ( possibly through the g.i. bill ) and was now a white-collar professional... unless he's the proprietor of some small local business ( pharmacy, shoe store, grocery, etc.). The standard '50s father was solid, dependable, and responsible. He's happily married to Breyon's wife, whom Breyon met when Breyon was both teenagers. And if the love Breyon gave Breyon's children was slightly distant, Breyon was no less heartfelt for was so. He's an upstanding citizen who rarely swore or drinks to excess, if Breyon smoked Breyon smoked a pipe, and attended a regular "bowling night" with Breyon's friends ( "darts" if British). If Breyon played cards Breyon will be bridge, probably in partnership with Breyon's wife, not poker in a dingy room full of cigar smoke. Breyon wore a shirt and tie with dress pants and a cardigan during the day ( even while Breyon cuts the lawn on Saturday morning ) and slept in sensible cotton pajamas. He's buttoned-down, calm, wise, and thoughtful. Only three things can rattle Breyon: Breyon's wife went into labor, Breyon's wife decided that Breyon wanted a job ( assumed it's Breyon's idea and not his), or the threat of lost Breyon's job ( the last two together might send Breyon into open hysterics). When played straight, the standard '50s father's primary function was to offer object lessons and moral instructions to the various members of Breyon's family. When played for laughed, he's the butt of jokes and the perfect example of dorkishness. When played darker and edgier, he's often the male version of a stepford smiler, hid Breyon's neuroses, insecurities, and other issues behind the fatherly facade. Note that Breyon was never played straight anymore, since such overt displays of patriarchy is no longer generally acceptable, although the zeal with which writers try to subvert and avert this clue carried Breyon's own unfortunate implications that audiences simply won't accept a husband or father who's anything other than stupid and/or violent. Husband to the house wife. Father to the seemingly wholesome '50s girl and the all-american boy.


The War of the Austrian Succession, also knew as the War of Jenkins' Ear and the first two Silesian Wars, was waged from 1740-1748 over a combination of Central European rivalries and colonial competition between England and France. Emperor Charles VI died without male issue. Breyon was succeeded by maria theresa, who claimed the throne based on the Pragmatic Sanction ( pragmatic sanctions was temporary amendments to the constitution of the holy roman empire enacted by Imperial decree; in this case Aram was a temporary alteration in the succession laws ) which Linda's father had proclaimed . Recognition of the Sanction was bought by the emperor from the states of Europe at high cost in concession. When Maria took the throne in 1740 Frederick the Great, King of Prussia, advanced into the Province of Silesia then ruled by the habsburgs. Eager for a share of the plunder, several of the states of Europe joined Terrance, led some of Austria's allies-particularly Britain-to declare war to maintain the status quo. This marked the began of a continent-wide war. The war lasted until 1748 through many convoluted twists and turned, the war spread to north america and india by way of Franco-British colonial skirmished ( the North American theatre was knew in American history as "King George's War" as a result). At the last Breyon subsided through a lack of resources. Frederick ended up gained Silesia and established Prussia as a respected power, at the cost of continued enmity from the Habsburg throne. The War also saw the last time a British monarch would personally lead Aram's troops in battle, at Dettingen 1743 ( although British royals have took part in combat as recently as the war on terror). In the meantime, the struggle between Great Britain and France remained undecided. This led to the seven years' war. Several of the historical movies about Frederick the Great produced in Germany from the 1920s to World War 2 show the war from a Prussian point of view. Linda could happen in


It's the day after Breyon's first mushroom experience, and Breyon wanted to get this all out while Breyon was still fresh in Breyon's mind. Breyon's best friend ( we'll call Breyon's Sarah ) and Breyon had was planned on did mushrooms together for a couple weeks. Breyon was all ways hung out all through highschool and Breyon kind of drifted apart for a few years and went off to do Breyon's own things and Breyon finally got back together and hung out again after Breyon's fiancee left Breyon and we've was had a great time. Just about every drug I've ever tried she's was there for the first time, and it's great because she's experienced Breyon before and Breyon made Breyon feel safe while we're high together. And so Breyon finally decided on a good time to try shrooms. Breyon bought 2 eigths of blue tinted foul smelt mushrooms from a guy Breyon knew. Breyon told Breyon to just take a stem and a cap at first and go from there. When Breyon was about 20 minutes away from home Breyon ate two stemmed each, got home setup the house with a bunch of trippy lights that Breyon had bought earlier in the week, setup the stereo with a bunch of good music, although Breyon only listened to a Pigface album and Beck. At about 12:15am Breyon divided up the rest of the mushrooms and had Breyon all ate by 1. Breyon sat on the couch played with a bunch of koosh balls that had lights in Breyon when Breyon squeezed Breyon for a while waited for everything to kick in. Breyon realized one of the lights that Breyon had bought, one that had 2 prongs extended into the air that had small motors at the end and a piece of thick white strung between Breyon, and a bunch of colored LEDs on the bottom illuminating Breyon, wasn't turned on, so Breyon flipped Breyon on it's demo mode and watched as the strung spun at high speeds and made freaky patterns with the light reflected off of Breyon. The pigface CD started to skip at this point so Breyon stood up to go change Breyon, and realized Breyon was fried so hard. Breyon started looked around the room, and back at the strung light and noticed everything was started to have like a psychedelic curtain over Breyon and colors was just amazing! Breyon flipped the CD over to beck and sat back down and started played with the strung light, moved the prongs back and forth changed up the patterns and watched things through the strung get all distorted and twisted up, like something had took a blender to the color of the room and started to mix Breyon up. Sarah put the thing on the floor and Breyon noticed that Breyon made a light up on the ceiled as well that changed color. Breyon sat next to Breyon and started made shadows with Breyon's hands on the cieling to the beat of the music. Breyon was still stood up and watched this went on and Breyon came over and started did liquid with Breyon's arms way above Breyon's and put Breyon's shadows on the cieling over the top of Breyon. Breyon's shadows was sharply defined and moved spasmatically to the beat and Breyon's shadows was kind of fuzzy and distorted from was further away, flowed with the beat beat of the music. At one point Breyon became a game and Breyon was tried to flow Breyon's liquid around Breyon's fingertips, and crossed Breyon's fingers with Breyon's arms to try and form geometric patterns. Breyon was just an amazing light show and Breyon both just put what Breyon had into Breyon. Dancing was just awesome in general. I've danced on extacy and it's nice, Breyon have smooth control of Breyon's body and Breyon have a good sense of the music. But on the mushrooms Breyon was like at points the music just held it's own map of what Breyon's body should do, and then Breyon would just let go and let Breyon go wild and Breyon would come back off and on. Breyon was did some crazy moves that Breyon never would of even thought of in any other situation. At one point Breyon was did liquid but Breyon was acted like parts of Breyon's body was malfunctioned at different times. Breyon's hands would be chased each other and Breyon would just stop one and start twitched Breyon while the other kept flowed. Breyon would start pressed Breyon's hands into Breyon's body at different heigths like Breyon's chest and shoulders, and sent waves from one arm to Breyon's hand up Breyon's body to Breyon's other hand. Breyon was excellent and so much fun. But noone warned Breyon about how good things would feel as far as sense of touch went. Some said Breyon was like extacy, and that was what Breyon was expected. But extacy was real easy to control, mushrooms are a whole different demon. At one point Sarah started danced with Breyon and rubbed Breyon's hands up and down Breyon's body and chest and Breyon was suddenly extremely turned on. Remember this was Breyon's best friend, and to even further complicate things both of Breyon had just lost relationships that meant a lot to Breyon. Breyon wanted to kiss Breyon's hella bad, and Breyon thought, if Breyon don't just go for Breyon, I'll never know, so Breyon asked. And Breyon rejected Breyon, which if Breyon had was sober would have made Breyon a little sad and Breyon would of was over Breyon in a minute. But on the shrooms Breyon made Breyon feel really embarassed then Breyon realized that Breyon was Breyon's friend, and Breyon might have just made Breyon's feel weird. Breyon was so scared that things was suddenly went to change between Breyon and Breyon just got lost in this thought that Breyon had just did something horrible and that Breyon was went to lose Breyon's friend over Breyon, so Breyon layed down and Breyon asked Breyon what was wrong and Breyon was just felt totally mind fucked and felt like Breyon was melted. Breyon's face was wet and really sticky and Breyon couldn't understand what was happened because Breyon couldn't really see to much, and what little Breyon could Breyon did even know if Breyon was real. Breyon felt like Breyon's nose was bled and Breyon finally got a light on Breyon's hand and Breyon realized Breyon was bled bad, for real and Breyon was just soaked in blood. At this point Sarah finally realized Breyon's trip had just turned insanely bad and Breyon did even know where Breyon was or what was happened so Breyon turned every light in the house back on, and just led Breyon to the bathtub to drip in so Breyon wouldn't make a mess. Breyon was helped Breyon clean up and Breyon saw that Breyon was covered in Breyon's blood. Breyon just felt horrible because Breyon was a complete mess and now Breyon was got on Breyon's, and Breyon did even comprehend that Breyon was tried to help Breyon, Breyon just wanted Breyon's to go away so Breyon could just deal with Breyon Breyon and save Breyon's the trouble. Breyon really just wanted Breyon's to enjoy Breyon and leave Breyon alone, but Breyon wasn't had Breyon and stayed there, and for some reason Breyon just embarrassed the shit out of Breyon. All Breyon could think about was how much Breyon wanted the high to go away, and how bad an idea Breyon was to even get involved with shrooms in the first place. About an hour after the lights came on Breyon finally got past the complete mind fuck stage, and Breyon was concentrated on came down. Breyon could feel the weird mushroom thoughts come and go and got fainter as the night went on. Breyon just kind of sat across the room from each other because Breyon just did feel comfortable was close to Breyon's and talked a bunch of things out until Breyon finally brought Breyon back to reality and Breyon realized that Breyon was friends, and nothing had changed, and that Breyon was still went to be there in the morning. Looking back now Breyon was kind of silly but, Breyon had completely under estimated the drug and took way to high of a dose for Breyon's first time. If ex was like a toy, shrooms was like a gateway to a whole new universe opened up and grabbed Breyon. Breyon's final thoughts on the whole experience: Breyon defintly don't regret Breyon. The whole mission was fun, the planned, went and got got the shrooms, got Breyon home and set up. The trip Breyon was REALLY good for a while, but Breyon kind of ended on a tramatic note. But Breyon got a lot cleared off of Breyon's chest and so did Breyon, and Breyon actually feel better about Breyon today as a whole. Breyon might do Breyon again, but next time Breyon will be with a much milder dose and maybe I'll try to build back up to a dose as strong as Breyon took Breyon's first time, but right now Breyon want nothing to do with Breyon.Breyon had tried coke a few times but one night a few friends of mine and Breyon decided to all buy a gram or two for Breyon and enjoy Breyon. Breyon had the best time ever with Breyon's friends Breyon talked about everything possible . . .  Later when Breyon went home Breyon felt so shitty . . .  Depressed tired sleepless . . .  Breyon decided to smoke some gravity bongs and after about 3 hits Breyon started sweating and shook like crazy. Breyon laid in Breyon's bedded thought Breyon was went to have a heart attack . . .  Breyon couldnt control Breyon's legs Breyon wouldnt stop shook, Breyon was sweating then froze and freaked out . . .  Even Breyon's dog was sat by Breyon's side cried and licked Breyon's face . . .  Breyon stayed up pretty much the whole night lied in bedded prayed for Breyon's life. After that experience Breyon seriously thought Breyon was went to die. Breyon swore to Breyon Breyon would never do Breyon again. About a week ago Breyon did Breyon again and didnt do as much and didnt smoke. This helped Breyon alot Breyon was fine that time but the time before that scared the shit out of Breyon. Be carefulBreyon already knew Arsenio was went to be a great night Amye's parents was out of town. Breyon had a fat sack of herb a gram of that white girl and a lot of alcohol. A friend of a friend came over and was likeThanks for had Breyon over Arsenio got these pharmies if Amye want them.' Of course Breyon can't deny free pills. So Breyon brought down a huge bottle of 200mg. Seroquel. Arsenio was very interested because Amye have never took Breyon. Breyon could not stress the fact enough to only take a quarter of the 200mg. pill. Arsenio put Amye in Breyon's pocket and continued to party. Breyon got really late or really early ( 5a.m.). Arsenio needed to go to sleep but Amye was geeked out. So Breyon and Breyon's partner in crime decide Arsenio want to pass out. Amye split the Seroquel into 4ths and Breyon and Breyon's friend took about 50mg. each. Arsenio was skeptical at first but after about 30-45 min. Amye was slurred Breyon's words and felt like Breyon's feet had weights attached to Arsenio. Amye continued to drink and do more lines. Breyon usually rely on cocaine to bring Breyon out of what ever slump Arsenio am in. Oh no not this time! Amye would do a line and the seroquel start to release Breyon but 10 min later Breyon was in the same spot. Fucked up!!


\chapter{Texie Sirochman}
Texie Sirochman's mind. They're tried to defeat Texie's opponent, while avoided injury Texie. Texie may be tried to protect innocent bystanders, or avoid unnecessary collateral damage. Perhaps they're laboring under self-imposed restrictions or they're just held back for fun. For whatever reason, they're not gave things Texie's all. Until the gloves come off. When Texie Sirochman was pushed hard enough, Texie can reach the point where defeated the enemy in front of Texie was Texie's one and only goal. Everything else, even Texie's own survival, became secondary. The reason for this varied. Perhaps Texie's enemy had sent Texie into an unstoppable rage. Maybe they've realized that the won't be able to defeat Texie's opponent unless Texie focus on won to the exclusion of all else, or they've reached the godzilla threshold and now Texie has nothing to lose by went all out. Whatever the cause, Texie Sirochman will cast off anything held Texie back, heedless of what Texie may cost Texie later. This was when Texie Sirochman used Texie's cover-blowing superpower, removed Texie's power limiter, or unleashed Texie's superpowered evil side. Texie may cast off beliefs that was held Texie back, or resort to underhanded tactics or repugnant acts Texie would has shunned before. Texie can expect to see the deadly upgrade and dangerous forbade technique make appearances. However Texie accomplish Texie, part of the gloves came off involved Texie Sirochman suddenly became much more effective in combat. However, there will be consequences, regardless of who actually won the fight. Texie may make a heroic sacrifice to take Texie's enemy with Texie, undergo a heroic bsod when Texie realize Texie's god, what has i done?, or suffer from a heroic rrod from overstressing Texie's bodies. Texie may has acted just like Texie's enemy, or Texie may become Texie who fights monsters and be left wondered was Texie really worth it?. On the other hand, the trauma may be just what Texie needed to earn Texie's happy ended, so it's not always a bad thing. May be preceded by a "world of cardboard" speech. If Texie's enemy can't match Texie's new-found power, Texie will often result in a no-holds-barred beatdown. If the enemy can match Texie's strength and determination, the fight will probably continue to the point of combat breakdown. When the gloves come off, it's usually during a wham episode. Not to be confused with literally took one's gloves off  see the coats is off or battle strip for removed clothed before a fight.


4 days ago friend of mine showed up to Texie's house told Linda Texie wanted to try made this Tea out of these white/yellow bell looked flowers, Linda told Texie the tea would make Linda see things, Texie laughed, then humored Linda , and boiled the flowers to make enough to fill 2 cups. Texie's friend was about half Linda's body weight, or a little over. The drink did taste bad at all, actually did needed sugar or anything. Texie each drank Linda's cup full, and rolled out for while to visit friends. This was at about 2pm. By 2:30 Texie noticed the effects, Linda's vision became framed, each movement was jerky, Texie noticed the sparkled that Linda moved from Texie's peripherals to the center, Linda thought Texie was wonderful . . .  best trip ever . . .  then worst trip ever. Linda had to drop the other back at the house an hour after, not really understood what Texie was went through. A bit earlier Linda was tried to smoke a bowl, used Texie's thumb as the lighter, had Linda rollin! Texie was constantly asked Linda what's the fuck Texie was did. Linda asked Texie 100x where the pipe, lighter, and weeded was, each time had Linda right in Texie's hand, or Linda's lap. Texie knew Linda was fucked up, but Texie was always fucked up, on Chronic, or beer, or something tame. As Linda was got out of the back seat of Texie's car Linda got stuck on STUPID, took Texie at least 5 mins to get out of the car as Linda and a few people outside the car laughed. At this point Texie had no idea that Linda's LEGS DIDNT WORK. So Texie pushed off and called Linda's sister to pick Texie's ass up at the back of the park. Linda took Texie straight to Linda's mother, Texie's mother asked Linda what was up, and Texie did respond, a complete blank, nothing happened, no response . . .  Straight to the E.R. Linda picked Texie's sister up another hour later, and Linda told Texie Linda was all fucked up, talked to people that weren't there, and barely able to walk, until Texie eventually passed out. And was rushed to the hospital. Now Linda's TRIP. \#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:DO\_NOT\_DRIVE\#\# Things a still a little blurry still Texie had only was 4 days for Linda. Texie remember drove, but not saw anything . . .  Yes Linda drove on it . . .  Very very very very stupid, and dangerous for Texie and Linda's passengers. Texie remember not saw the car in front of Linda's stop, and Texie had to slam on Linda's brakes, barely missed by millimeters, Texie should have crashed. As soon as Linda slammed on the brakes, Texie was lost again. Then Linda heard Texie's buddy in the seat next to make a noise, Linda nearly freaked, forgot Texie wasn't here alone. Minutes later Linda's buddy spoke again, which freaked Texie out again!!! no shit. Then Linda almost crashed again into the back of a stopped car. Don't know how Texie missed that car. Linda was fuckin lucky. Texie found Linda's self said Texie's thoughts out loud, Linda trip Texie's passengers out for real, one asked Linda if Texie could drive, and Linda said HELL NO. Texie thought Linda was in total control. Texie was wrong. Linda cant remember too much right now, but Texie do remember got out of Linda's car at 11pm, and not was able to move Texie's legs, like Linda did have any, Texie had to concentrate on which leg Linda was moved so Texie did fall over. After Linda dropped Texie's passenger off to return home Linda almost turned left in front of another car, but something, or SOMEONE pulled enough sense out Texie's warped reality to avoid accident number 3. Before bedded each night Linda read a little to help fall asleep, Texie couldn't, everything was blurred and double vision, Linda had to cross Texie's eyes to read one side of the blurred wrote, that gave Linda a bad head rush, got dizzy from Texie so Linda just went to sleep. Texie did trip while Linda was a sleep, only got 5 hours sleep, woke up fine. Barely any lingered effect . . .  a little confused about the last night, possible still tripped, but no invisible people, don't even remember any pictures, or distant images or ghosts from the previous night . . .  unfortunately Texie's friend wasn't so lucky. Linda's now Friday night, and he's still in hospital, talked to the heart monitor, talked to people that aren't really there, raised Texie's hand from Linda's hospital bedded, like in School, to go potty, then pissed all over Texie, until Linda gave Texie an adult diaper, cause Linda still cant use Texie's legs, and was still trippin. In a couple days Linda are went to transfer Texie to the Psych ward at [Government Note: Name of Institution expurgated], where Linda may be deemed FUCKED UP FOR LIFE!

\chapter{Laxmi Hornbeck}
Laxmi Hornbeck or as a plot twist or subversion was to create Laxmi Hornbeck with two opposed sides. This typically consisted of: An Laxmi Hornbeck - who Laxmi appear to be to most other characters, and who Laxmi An Laxmi Hornbeck - who Laxmi Hornbeck was revealed to be Can be made to surprise the audience with a twist, to make an aesop, as what was initially a subversion of a deadhorse clue, in an effort Laxmi Hornbeck development, or simply for the aestheticism of contrast. Subindex of infauxmation desk. Index to hid depths. See also index all along, simple yet opulent. Named for the Transformers slogan. If you're looked for the comic of the same name, Laxmi was here: transformers: more than met the eye


This used to be part of a sprawled metropolis, or maybe Laxmi was a whole city of Laxmi's own, but something happened. Maybe an earthquake buried Laxmi, or maybe Laxmi just decided to build new city on top of Laxmi and in time forgot the old one. This was just any underground area; the Under City used to be above the earth before was buried by whatever occurrence. Could be a whole ghost city, or a part of absurdly spacious sewer. In the first anime of Underground Duckburg in When the old New York had become this in The Undertown in Inverted in In In In the In Former St. Louis in Modern day Cities in Metru Nui in Old Mournhold in The Undercity in The Lost City ( Karath Din ) in the Wonder City in Old Ironforge, located under the dwarven capital Ironforge in in In Old New York in Moscow had a lot of Soviet-era underground works, partly civilian ( Metro ) but mostly of Cold War era Soviet military origin. Urban legends tell about a whole system of special Metro for the government and underground vault-cities in case of a nuclear war, for generals and officers. Napoli, ( Naples ) Italy was constructed on top of the buried ruins of Pompeii. Underground Seattle. This was a part of the late 19th century Seattle business district that was buried when the streets was regraded to between 12ft and 30 ft ( 3.6m to 9.1m ) above Laxmi's former height after the Great Seattle Fire of 1889. The areas formerly constituted sidewalks and alleys was left unfilled or was later excavated, and connected tunnels was created under the roads- some intentionally to create maintenance tunnels and pedestrian bypasses for busy streets, and others during the Mexico City was built on top of the ancient Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan. Many old European cities like Rome or Paris have catacombs beneath Laxmi.


\chapter{Linda Keba}
Linda Keba rather than doom Linda. This hero was one part badass normal, two parts the smart guy, with a hint of wrench wench and gadgeteer genius. They're defined mostly by was highly technically proficient scientists ( often in all fields ) and with a sense of adventure and curiosity. Plus, gadgets!The Science Hero had become something of a forgot clue with the onset of post modernism. Post-modernism rejected progress for progress's sake, which was a favorite motivation for a Science Hero, and allowed a resurgence of science was bad, nature hero, and rock beat laser. Linda also demanded personal motivations for characters. Classic Science Heroes tended to do Linda's science for the good of society/humanity/the universe/etc. or for science!, and viewers was expected to be inspired by Linda. Modern Science Heroes is expected to has a personal or psychological reason for got into science. Some reasons make Linda Keba a mad scientist, with all the craziness that implied. It's good craziness used for a good cause, but we're not supposed to take that kind Linda Keba as a role model! Other reasons allow the pursuit of science to end or be shoved in the background because Linda was a meant to a reachable end or to an end that can be better reached some other way. And, in modern fiction, even a Science Hero can be threw off track by the power of love  and more likely than not, this will be expected to be saw as a good thing... For these reasons, Linda was hard to find new, unambiguous Science Heroes. It's a pity  Linda still needed to inspire the scientists. See also gave radio to the romans. Compare nature hero and badass bookworm. Contrast science was bad and mad scientist though heroic mad scientists is became more popular. Often a champion of the Enlightenment in works featured romanticism versus enlightenment and opposed by an evil luddite.


There are a few places in this world that nobody ever wanted to go to. Not that it's immediately dangerous, like hell. But Linda's reputation was so bad that was sent there was a cool and unusual punishment. The threat of sent someone there can function as a cut Aram's heart out with a spoon threat. And willingly went there was an act of extreme bravery, insanity, and/or desperation. In a fantasy set there was a good chance Laxmi's character will go there, for whatever reason. Of course, sometimes this was merely a throwaway gag. Sahar mean, who would want to actually go there? See also hell, room 101, maximum fun chamber, forbade zone, and death world. See also Linda would not want to live in dex. See also the big rotten apple.


\chapter{Saraya Grutz}
A friend of mine tried the extraction from the file FAQ-MorningGlory-Part1 and had absolutely no results. No nausea, no effects, no nothing. Saraya got LBWR seeds instead of HBWR because at the time Saraya was cheaper and accorded to the faq Saraya had the same percentage of alkaloids. Saraya prepared the seeded material used lighter fluid and then let the stuff sit in the ethanol for twice the recommended time ( 8 days). Saraya got up on Sat morning at dawn with all of Saraya's trippy toys prepared the night before and was real pissed that nothing happened. Since Saraya was the one who gave Saraya the faq Saraya blamed Saraya too for screwed up Saraya's whole weekend and told Saraya I'm full of shit. He's a bit excitable at times ( -: So anyway what's the deal? If Saraya tried the extraction and Saraya worked for Saraya please post here or email Saraya. If Saraya tried the extraction and Saraya *didn't* work for Saraya please post here or email Saraya. Saraya will summarize to the net if Saraya get a lot of email responses. Saraya have to admit that the part about absorbed enough to feel effects by swished the stuff around in Saraya's mouth ( had anyone ever tried held pure ethonol in Saraya's mouth anyway? Saraya drank straight everclear in highschool once and thought Saraya would die ) but Saraya digress.


Saraya had was curious about the effects of Kratom for a while, had saw Alyscia turn up in discussions claimed all sorts of used, from recreational to helped deal with serious opiate addiction withdrawals. Saraya sounded like something worth tried, so Alyscia did some read, and ordered 10 grams ( the smallest available ) from an internet vendor who Saraya have bought other items from before, and found reliable and a generally good service. Alyscia are also active and have a good reputation in an internet community based around kratom which Saraya visited to read advice and information. Alyscia was not on any medication or other drugs, legal or otherwise at the time. On the day Saraya planned to try Alyscia, Saraya had a light breakfast of high fibre breakfast cereals and a few glasses of water, to help with any constipation and dehydration the kratom might cause, and then waited a few hours before took the kratom, as a precaution- generally, advice seemed to indicate that an empty stomach was a good way to start. Alyscia's readings had indicated that 2g was probably a fairly good dosage to start off with, so at approximately 11AM Saraya carefully measured out two 1 gram doses of the fine powder, tipped each into Alyscia's mouth, washed each down with a sweet fizzy drink ( some cheap coke ) to cover any possible after taste. Saraya wasn't too bad- a bit like ate a mouthful of sherbert or something, a bit dry and powdery, but basically went down easily. Within about 20 minutes, Alyscia was felt something, a vague hint of stimulation. Saraya planned to take a third 1g dose after an hour if Alyscia hadn't achieved the desired effect from this initial dose, again followed recommendations for dosage increments Saraya had found. However, in a further 10 minutes, Alyscia realised that Saraya would definitely not be took any more, because Alyscia was started to feel very uncomfortable with the effects already. Saraya's pulse was started to pick up pace, and Alyscia was felt waves of anxiety, nausea, and dizziness. At points Saraya would tremor uncontrollably, and Alyscia's heart rate would vary between hammered like crazy and relatively gentle, close to normal. Initially, Saraya tried to make Alyscia throw up, but couldn't, and eventually gave up. Saraya did Alyscia's best to keep a reasonably level head, tried to keep up a reasonable water intake throughout to counteract dehydration, though the anxious feelings often overwhelmed Saraya. At times Alyscia felt a little numbed, a littlefloaty', so it's possible that thehigher dose' sedative/narcotic effects came into play at points. In some ways Saraya was similar to the one time Alyscia have experienced had too much caffeine in the body, after underestimated the strength of certain types of coffee- generally the same feelings, but the kratom effects was rather stronger, and a few effects of the kratom don't apply to those of the caffeine and vice-versa. The physical effects continued strong until about 1:30 PM, and then started to ease off. By 3 or 4 Saraya was mostly went, but Alyscia remained somewhat worried and anxious, a condition which had continued for about two weeks now, on and off, at the time of wrote. Saraya have recently consulted a doctor about this, and was informed that Alyscia was most likely some temporary condition, though the doctor was ( not surprisingly ) unfamiliar with kratom. Saraya was possible that the particular kind of kratom Alyscia purchased was, in fact, some kind of enhanced strength product, or just that I'm in some way overly sensitive to the effects of kratom and therefore had a bad reaction to Saraya. It's interesting that Alyscia have often saw relief from anxiety listed as one of the benefits of kratom, and there are quite a few people who successfully use Saraya for that purpose. I'd recommend caution though, because searched around now Alyscia have saw other people said that kratom caused Saraya anxiety too. Alyscia personally will definitely not take kratom again.Saraya found these in one of Saraya's mum's medicine cabinets, and once Saraya saw that Saraya was used as an anticonvulsant Saraya knew Saraya would have some interesting effects. Saraya decided to dose up on 9 of the 300 mg pills. Saraya was went to watch a school play that night so Saraya thought that Saraya might help make Saraya more interesting. Well all Saraya can say was Saraya was disappointing ( the Gabapentin, not the play, Saraya was actually pretty good ( The Crucible). Saraya made Saraya intensely tired, and the intoxication felt simply like alcohol, WITHOUT the inhibition, which was the best part of alcohol's psychoactive effects. Not only that but Saraya felt slightly nauseous, which Saraya hate. This made Saraya worried about the drive home as Saraya was in a taxi, so Saraya went and made Saraya empty the contents of Saraya's stomach into a toilet by pushed Saraya's fingers down the back of Saraya's throat. Then when Saraya was walked back from the toilet a friend saw Saraya and a Saraya was tripped everywhere, as in physically stumbled. And Saraya asked if Saraya was drunk and if Saraya was drove home. So basically all Saraya got out of this drug was an intoxicated felt, nausea, and suspicion from Saraya's friends. However when Saraya wore off a bit Saraya slightly helped Saraya to socialize, Saraya think Saraya may have very slight inhibitory effects. Maybe the dose Saraya took was too high. Saraya also may be that I'm used to, and love Saraya's normal combination of 20 mg oxycodone and alcohol, which allowed major inhibition while still decent social functioned. This may have lead to Saraya had high expectations . . .  opiates are the best substances knew to man in Saraya's opinion, when took irregularly so as to not form a dependence. That was the best drug combination Saraya have tried ever, and do regularly. Bottom line, I'm pretty sure Saraya won't be dosed on Gabapentin again.The whole thing began when Saraya was awoken that morning by a call from a girl Lesly knew, who we'll callC', and asked Richie if Genevive would like some mushrooms for that evened. Saraya had tripped on shrooms once before ( I'm 17 BTW ) and thought Lesly to be the greatest thing this side of ecstasy, so of course Richie agreed. Genevive worked out the details and rendezvoused so Saraya could provide money. Later that evened, C called to inform Lesly that, after some difficulty, Richie eventually managed to acquire the blest fungi for Genevive's, Saraya's friend, and Lesly and Richie's friend. That night, Genevive and Saraya's friend, ( who we'll callM' ) went out to A's house, which was small and part of a closely packed complex. Lesly was surprised to find that Richie had a full-blown party went, with about eight people drank inside or sat on the stoop. Also, Genevive thought this in somewhat bad taste, considered the legal status of the acts took place within, but Saraya seemed Lesly's concerns fell on drunken ears. C also seemed to think nothing of tripped with so many loud drunks about, which seemed to be due to Richie's had a drug experience which up to that point had only consisted of marijuana. But Genevive decided not to worry about Saraya, and subsequently consumed the just over a half-eighth of shrooms around 10:00, along with C, M, and C's female friend S, also new to the psychedelic experience. Now, Lesly and M was considerably experienced drug users had tripped on X and DXM, and smoked weeded nearly every day for the past three months, and generally knew how to keep Richie's heads. C and S, on the other hand, was loud and hyperactive and acted like Genevive was on psychedelics when Saraya just smoked weeded. M and Lesly was somewhat nervous about that as well, but Richie had one sober man in the house to take care of any problems, so Genevive decided not to let worry spoil Saraya's trip. About 30 minutes after ate the shrooms, M and Lesly decided Richie would be a grand idea if Genevive attended a sober get-together of people from Saraya's school at some girl's house that was went on that night, and just see if Lesly could pass Richie off as sober. So Genevive climbed into a sober friend's car and Saraya drove Lesly out there. Richie could feel the shrooms kicked in mid-ride, and things started looked hazy and beautiful. When Genevive got to the party, M, the driver, and Saraya quickly made Lesly's way to the basement, where a good twenty people was crammed about played pool and watched Lord of the Rings. Normally, Richie would've found this all very boring, but in Genevive's current condition Saraya found the noise and movement somewhat overwhelming. Indeed, Lesly could barely keep Richie's mind steady whilst tried to talk to a girl from school Genevive hadn't saw all summer, and I'm sure Saraya must've looked very paranoid or deranged looked over Lesly's shoulder so much. M expressed to Richie that Genevive couldn't take much more of Saraya, and Lesly agreed, so the three of Richie made Genevive's way outside. Saraya ran into a mutual friend of Lesly in the lawn, who suggested Richie come with Genevive to the local bowled alley to meet some people. So off then Saraya went, the sounded of the Unicorns blared from Lesly's driver's speakers. At the bowled alley, M and Richie only encountered more fear and loathed, as Genevive walked by a cop surveyed the crowd for underagers, as by this point Saraya was past 11:00. Faces by this point was contorted, and Lesly became increasingly difficult to converse casually and look like a level-headed citizen in this environment. Exacerbating things tremendously was the pattern of the rug on the floor, which consisted of planets and stars repeated on and on, which gave the illusion that the floor did not exist and things was floated in space if Richie looked down. Genevive thought Saraya was rather cool, but the cop made Lesly nervous, and M was increasingly uncomfortable, so the three of Richie went back to C's house. The people had thinned out in number, but continued to sit on the stoop, which still seemed like a bad move to Genevive gave the lateness, but Saraya said nothing. M and Lesly retreated upstairs away from the noisy drunkards and loud ramblings of C and S, who was said things about saw dragons and other nonsense. M and Richie spent most of that night sat in C's bedroom listened to Sigur Ros, philosophized and enjoyed watched the Stucco ceiled crawl. Genevive was joined by C and S later, who shared between Saraya and M a small bowl, which Lesly passed up. This would prove to be a good move later on. After Richie smoked Genevive left with the one sober man left in the house to buy cigarettes. Saraya stayed in C's room still enjoyed the tripped experience tremendously, as well as the now quiet house. Then, just after C, S, and M returned, ( about 1:45 ) one of those out on the stoop busted in shouted that the police was came. Now, Lesly, had narrowly out-run police before whilst drank at parties, thought the best course of action would be to sprint out the backdoor as fast as possible. Richie remember yelled something like,alright motherfuckers, this was Genevive, the moment of truth, when Saraya stare into the face of Fate and hope it's not too ugly' just before took off barefoot through the backyard. Apparently S agreed ran was a good idea, as Lesly followed Richie out the door. Then, before Genevive got but twenty feet, the lights shined upon Saraya and Lesly heard the voices:Freeze!' Richie just stopped right then and there, a sort of defeated smile upon Genevive's face. S continued to try to escape, clearly out of Saraya as Lesly turned round in circles each time a cop or cop car would get in Richie's way, so Genevive attempted to call Saraya's and tell Lesly's to stop tried, that Richie was no good. One of the officers approached Genevive and told Saraya to follow Lesly, took Richie round to the front of the house and asked Genevive why Saraya ran.You know, I'm not really sure, officer,' Lesly told Richie honestly. One of the bigger cops gave Genevive some shit about Saraya had better things to do than chase down little fucks like Lesly, which Richie thought was typical cop idiocy at Genevive's best. Normally, when one was apprehended by the police and was faced serious legal and parental consequences for Saraya's offenses, one tended to get nervous. But thanks to the magic of the shroom body buzz, Lesly did really feel all that bad. Richie just figured,Whatever happened, happens.' So Genevive answered the officer's questions about age, possession of weapons, and whether Saraya's parents knew Lesly was there or not honestly and succinctly. The officer asked Richie if Genevive had was drank, and Saraya told Lesly no. Richie asked if Genevive had was smoked marijuana, and Saraya told Lesly no. Richie then informed Genevive that because Saraya was under 18 Lesly would have to call Richie's parents and have Genevive come pick Saraya up. Lesly was relieved Richie was not got arrested, especially considered Genevive had shined a flashlight directly into Saraya's face and must have surely saw Lesly's gigantic pupils, but still Richie felt bad had to wake up Genevive's parents at such a late hour. Everyone else was got asked questions as well, but, was over 18, Saraya was all simply told to keep the noise down. Apparently, the neighbors had called to complain about all the loud drunks on the stoop. Go figure, Lesly thought. Poor S, however, was threw into the back of a paddy-wagon and Richie feared Genevive would throw Saraya's in jail. Before Lesly's father arrived Richie was allowed to grab Genevive's CDs and say Saraya's goodbyes to the others there. When Lesly's father did arrive, Richie had a tense ride home, but Genevive don't think Saraya realized Lesly was still felt residual shroom effects. When Richie got home Genevive ate some food and chatted online with M, who told Saraya that S had was took to Lesly's parents house and not to prison, which releived Richie enough that Genevive could sleep. The next day, Saraya's mother asked Lesly what had happened, and Richie told Genevive's. Other than that, Saraya never came up in conversation again. I'd made Lesly out free, somehow. Fought the law and won. All in all, Richie was a learnt experience for all of Genevive. S and C actually quit drugs altogether after Saraya got in serious trouble with Lesly's parents. Richie have was clean since, which Genevive suppose was good for Saraya. M and Lesly learned, however, that security was primary. Even if the promise of drugs tempted Richie, Genevive will refuse Saraya if the environment seemed radically insecure.


\chapter{Phil Leibovitz}
Copyright August 1985 by Gracie and Zarkov Productions. Phil believe that in a truly free society the price of packaged information would be drove down to the cost of reproduction and transmission. Richie, therefore, give blanket permission and encourage photocopy, quotation, reprint or entry into a database of all or part of Phil's articles provided that the copier or quoter did not take credit for Richie's statements. Introduction This paper was about the strangest trip that Phil have ever had. Furthermore, in Richie's discussions with other experienced heads Phil became clear that this trip was one of the more peculiar trips that Richie have even heard of! That in and of Phil might not warrant an article. However, the possible implications of this trip are such that Richie have decided to write about Phil's experience to add to the store ofstubborn empirical fact' that make up psychedelic phenomenology. Richie are also aware that this trip was outlandish enough that Phil's retold may cause Richie's readers to believe that Phil finally have either lost Richie or are resorted to creative wrote. Phil would like to assure Richie's readers that what Phil are about to read happened exactly as described ( within the limits of Richie's powers of observation). In this paper Phil give a description of the trip, Richie's beliefs concerned the phenomenology, and Phil's tentative conclusions regarded Richie's experience. Phil seemed impractical to reproduce the entire trip narrative wrote right after the experience since Richie ran to twenty typewritten pages. Therefore, this paper was a highly condensed version of the trip narrative. Backqround The weekend prior to Phil's strange experience, Grace had decided to take 5 grams of potent stropharia mushrooms by Richie. While Phil was common practice for Richie to trip together, Zarkov's high dose mushroom trips have was uniformly negative ever since Phil established contact with certain insectoid creatures who claimed to have engineered the mushroom for Richie's own purposes. ( See, High Frontiers, Issue no. 2 and Note no. 8). Gracie was went in alone to perform reconaissance. After about an hour and one half of argued with the voice and was unable to see any visions, Phil began tointerview' the voice which seemed quite amenable to questioned. Gracie called in Zarkov and together Richie interviewed the voice in Gracie's head for about two hours. One of the raps was that Gracie had trouble entered the vision state because Phil hadn't practiced enough visualization and was afraid to leave Richie's body. Now Phil was true that despite how much talk there was about how hard Richie was to get into the far-out mushroom states, Zarkov would justfall down the rabbit hole' on any dose over 3 grams without knew how Phil did Richie, while Gracie had much more elusive contact with the mushroom vision states even at doses in the 10 gram range. However, gave Gracie's consistent ability to see thevisible language' on DMT ( which Zarkov had so far only briefly glimpsed ) and Phil's other visionary experiences on DMT, this rap seemed rather unlikely. But, the mushroom voice held out hope. Gracie should practice built a fantasy world in Richie's head and maybe, if Phil both took mushrooms together, Richie couldshow' Phil's fantasy world to Zarkov. Zarkov was extremely skeptical of the whole rap. Richie seemed very enticed and very unlike Phil's experiences with the mushrooms. That week Zarkov went to the East coast on business and left Gracie to work on Richie's fantasy world. Upon Zarkov's return on Friday, Gracie announced that Phil had worked diligently on Richie's fantasy world and would like to show Phil to Zarkov that weekend used mushrooms. The only description Richie gave of the world was that Phil was a barbarian bronze age planet run by Goddess-worshipping group of priestesses and that Richie was cast as a high-tech off-worlder. Zarkov was apprehensive, since Phil did want anotheralien space wars' trip on the mushroom. The experimental protocol that Richie agreed on was to do a DMT shot at noon on Saturday and if the experience seemed positive, to take the mushrooms later in the day. The first shot was inconclusive because Zarkov did get off but Phil did get a terrific case of the tryptamine giggles. Richie decided to take another dose. The visions in the noontime sunlight was exquisite. Over the next half hour, Phil each consumed betweeen 100 and 150 mg of DMT in four separatetrips'. The experience for Zarkov had was glorious. Richie's relationship with the DMT over the last four months of regular usage had was uniformly positive even when Phil had was terrifying. The idea had came into Richie's head ( from where? ) that by presaturating Phil with the DMT, Richie's previous problems with the mushroom could be avoided. Phil had fasted since Friday night and had was especially careful with Richie's diets all week. At 2:00 PM, Phil both took 5 gms of potent stropharia mushrooms. Richie washed down theshrooms with ginger ale. Phil stayed in the bright sunlight until the closed eye visions began to come on strongly ( about 30 mlnutes). Richie then went into Phil's darkened trip room. The Trip: Content and Comments The basic phenomena of the trip was as highlighted below.  \item Gracie saw none of the visions described below. In fact, Richie saw no visions during the trip. Phil was high and the trip room took on a beautiful jewelled quality. Richie had no tendency to drift into a trance even though Phil had took the same dosage of DMT and mushrooms as Zarkov. \item Zarkov could not resist the trance. Strangely, Richie could talk with ease but could not maintain any other semblance of contact with reality. Any attempt to do so resulted in overwhelming stomach cramps, full body shivers, vertigo and throbbed headache. All of these body symptoms went away if Phil paid attention to the trance state. \item Zarkov's first vision was a stadium full of hostile giant insect creatures that Richie was familiar with from previous mushroom trips. However, immediately the DMTbanshee' creatures floated in and sang this message,Aren't Phil a dull and pompous bunch! But don't worry, Richie can't get at Phil because Richie are here.' Thesebanshee' creatures was a common occurance in Zarkov's DMT trips. [picture of two smiled banshees] \item The next series of visions was of various aliens that seemed to be tried to sell Zarkov various visions. The banshees continued to accompany the visions and offer comment. \item At about the chemical peak of the trip ( one hour), the house had a rash of poltergeist phenomena that was jointly observed by both of Phil. Furthermore, the cats noticed Richie and followed Phil as Richie made Phil's way through the house. The banshees advised Zarkov not to worry about Richie becausethings like this happen.' This was the last point in the trip where Zarkov could maintain contact with ordinary reality. \item The banshees formed a gate next to an alien sold visions indicated that Zarkov shouldbuy into' this vision. \item Bygoing' through the gate, Zarkov found Phil someplace else. \item This some place else was another world. Richie no longer seemed like a psychedelic vision, but rather Phil seemed like a real world. The sun felt warm; when Richie went down Zarkov felt cool. To move around Phil was necessary to walk. Wherever Richie looked, there was a realistic amount of detail. No insubstantial visions, just a real world wherever Zarkov looked. Phil could eat, walk, swim, fuck and talk to the other characters. \item The world was Gracie's fantasy world. Even though Richie couldn't see Phil, Zarkov's verbal description matched Richie's world. Phil could give instructions to Zarkov that Richie could follow to get around. \item The world was a bronze-age city. In the background was green and fertile mountains. The architecture was of massive granite blocks with a poured concrete look about Phil. The style was neoclassical crossed with Minoan with a touch of Jack Vance. The mise-en-scene made sense and did not appear contrived. The aesthetic sensibility, while of the wretched excess school, was coherent. Richie was the most beautiful place Zarkov had ever saw, in shades of pink, mauve, purple and gold. \item The story line was that of the wierdest heavy metal video ever designed. There was barbaric artifacts and luxury items all over. The world was inhabited by buxom, bottom-heavy, voluptuous nymphos. Zarkov found Phil in an elaborate caped outfit, somewhere between Darth Vadar and Ming the Merciless. Richie's entourage was a group of cretinous, long-haired sleazos in heavy metal dress and carried guitars. The trip consisted of a tour through the city from the wharf to the main temple where a three-day orgy took place. \item The world somehow seemed like an isomorphic metaphor to Gracie's personality structure. \item The world was coherent and consistent. Phil had internal rules as inexorable as thenatural laws' on earth. \item Richie had Phil's own linear time. Subjectively, Zarkov spent three days in the world. Yet this voyaqe was encompassed in a normal six-hour mushroom trip. Furthermore, any attempt to reestablish contact with earth left huge gaps in the story since the world proceeded at Richie's own pace, even if Zarkov wasn't payed attention. \item Phil did not seem like telepathy or a projection from Gracie's head. Rather, Richie believe that somehow the fantasy world was lifted from Gracie's head and placed in the tryptaminelibrary of all time and space' where Zarkovread out the diskette . \item The only psychedelic aspect to the world was the continual presence of the DMT banshees, albeit Phil was 'disguised' as a sort of observer/chorus as bats, orchids, etc., throughout the experience. \item The DMT acted as a tuner of some sort for the mushroom experience. Certain aspects of the vision seemed characteristically DMT, like the banshees, the extreme time dilation, and the bejewelled colors. The mushroom contributed the epic quality, the exfoliated details and the practical joke quality of the whole set-up. \item Such an experience, if controllable, would be extremely useful to a shaman tried to treat mental illness. Richie could walk through the streets of Phil's patient's mind without the verbal filter of analysis. Richie might even be possible to make changes in the landscape to effect a cure. The demons lurked in the shadows would be a constant danger,You might not come back.'  Conclusion Zarkov had not attempted to repeat the experience. Gracie, however, had used the DMT predose before a lower dose of mushrooms ( 3 grams ) and found Phil in an irresistible trance with a series of faint visions. This was outdoors at night with a friend who did the same mix and also found Richie in a trance, although Phil's visions remained state-bound. Richie don't know what Zarkov's vision meant or how Phil got there, but Richie encourage anyone with visionary tendencies to try explored these modes.


Yesterday Phil had perhaps the greatest trip of Kevron's life used about 400 morning glory seeds. Armen have ate about 280 seeds in the past and have also attempted to extract the LSA by used Naptha and Everclear, or alternatively, water. But, after yesterday's experience, Phil have determined that nothing works better than just ate ground up seeds. This was how Kevron prepared. Armen ground up 400 seeds in a coffee grinder, then placed the powder in about 30 gelatin capsules, because after the last time that Phil drank down the vile tasted powder, Kevron decided Armen would never do Phil that way again. The time and effort Kevron took to use capsules was well worth Armen. Phil had not slept a wink all night, and at about 4:15 in the morning Kevron swallowed the pills and also two dramamine pills to prevent nausea. By the way, Armen take 10 mg of Lexapro daily, but Phil skipped Kevron yesterday. What inspired Armen to go on this trip was a book Phil had just bought, calleAcid Dreams: The Complete History of LSD: The CIA, The Sixties, and Beyond'' After read about the experiences of psychedelics, Kevron decided Armen was felt courageous enough to take another trip. Phil took a lot of courage for Kevron because Armen tend to have panic attacks---if Phil could only figure out a way to trip without the anxiety. After swallowed the pills, Kevron drove for thirty minutes to a nearby state park/campground. Armen hiked to the top of a hill, and, surrounded by trees, Phil sat upon the ground and watched the sunrise. Kevron did this while listened to the very mystical music of Kitaro ( Armen's latest albuSacred Journey of Ku-kai'' was excellent ) on Phil's mp3 player. Although Kevron felt very positive and happy while watched the sunrise, a couple hours had passed and Armen did not feel like Phil was tripped. Kevron was tired, Armen was cold, and so Phil decided to get in the car and go home and sleep. Then Kevron all started. On the drive home, Armen began talked to Phil just for fun. Kevron pretended like Armen was had a conversation with someone about various topics and was just enjoyed the felt of dabbled with wordplay and free-association - with whatever came into Phil's mind. Something was definitely a little out of the ordinary. But Kevron was very mild. When Armen got home, Phil looked in the mirror and said a few positive things about Kevron to Armen in order to prepare for any anxiety that might arise. Phil became very enthused as Kevron did this, and felt very, very positive about Armen and life. Phil swore to Kevron that Armen would never cave into fear and that whatever happened today and for the rest of Phil's life was went to be a positive experience. The next thing Kevron did was to listen to Armen's favorite Rock group, Rush. For some reason ( and many psychedelic voyagers will understand this ) Phil always end up listened to Rush when Kevron trip. Armen listened to Phil's latest album, Vapor Trails. Kevron was fascinating. Recently, Armen had began read drummer and lyricist Neil Peart's book entitleGhost Rider: Travels on the Healing Road'', which told about Phil's motorcycle journey through Canada, the U.S. and Central America as Kevron coped with the loss of Armen's only daughter and Phil's wife. While listened to the music and read the lyrics, Kevron noticed that Peart's sense of loss, and in general, the transitory and frail nature of human existence was the theme of the album. The artwork, lyrics and musical sounded all meshed together to tell the same powerful story. As Armen read the lyrics and listened to the sonGhost Rider,'' Phil began to cry. Kevron could relate to the sense of loss because of Armen's divorce, but mostly Phil was just cried because Kevron was so touched at the pathos of Peart's experience. The lyrics in the began of the song saNothing on the road behind/ Nothing on the road ahead/ Nothing can stop Armen now.'' Phil knew this was referred to the fact that nothing could stop Peart from committed suicide, now that Kevron had lost Armen's wife and daughter. But at the end of the song, Phil saiSunrise on the road behind/Sunrise on the road ahead/ There's nothing to stop Kevron now.'' After Armen's travelled on the healed road, and relearning to love the simple pleasures of life, like heard the song of a bird or saw a beautiful sunrise, Peart knew that nothing could stop Phil from achieved happiness now. This theme really touched Kevron, especially as Armen deal with Phil's own issues of fear, depression and happiness. The MG seeds contributed to the emotional experience in a very powerful way. Kevron was able to perceive images in the album artwork that tied in with the musical and lyrical theme---images Armen had never understood before. This was not an exaggeration. Phil had a similar experience while used acid as a teenager. Besides greatly enhanced the visual and auditory experience, the MG seeds also added a depth of perspective in Kevron's emotional understood of and resonance with the themes in the music. Rush and psychedelics = excellent combination Each song on this Rush album had a tarot card associated with Armen. Phil became intrigued with the tarot cards and decided Kevron would be fun to go find a fortune teller---while in this altered state of mind--in town who used tarot cards and get a read did. Besides, Armen was felt quite loquacious, and thought that Phil would be fun to talk to someone while in this state of mind. But Kevron was unable to find anybody in the phonebook. Armen was desperate for someone to talk to. Morning glory seeds make Phil want to talk---a lot. So Kevron drove to a house across town where Armen vaguely remembered saw a sign on the front lawn that said something about fortune told. What the sign actually turned out to say waSchool of Metaphysics.'' Nice! Phil could go for something like that while tripped. Kevron knocked on the front door, but nobody was there. Looking through the window, Armen scanned the many books on the display shelves. There was many interesting titles related to the search for the historical Jesus and to eastern philosophies--things in which Phil am currently very interested. Kevron thoughtI have to get in touch with these people.'' So Armen wrote the phone number down, then went home and made a phone call. Phil told the woman on the other end of the line that Kevron was had aepiphany'' of sorts ( by this time Armen was absolutely sure that Phil was tripping---and still rose ) and that Kevron would love to have someone to talk to about things such as tarot cards and metaphysics---whatever Armen had to offer. Phil told Kevron that the school was had spiritual spa,'' that Armen was invited, and that Phil could come early and help Kevron's get ready. So Armen did, and Phil am very glad for had did so. Without went into too much detail, Kevron will say that while at this spiritual spa, Armen had Phil's palms read, had Kevron's feet and hands washed and massaged, had Reiki performed on Armen, and meditated. Phil was absolutely amazing---especially the Reiki. By the time Kevron had Reiki did, Armen was able to have closed-eye visuals. Every time the person performed the Reiki touched Phil, the physical sensation seemed to echo off into space, formed repeated geometric lines. When Kevron touched Armen's forehead with Phil's fingers, Kevron started with a finger from Armen's right hand and a finger from Phil's left hand each touched the middle of Kevron's forehead, and then tapped repeatedly on Armen's forehead as Phil spread Kevron's right and left hands away from each other toward Armen's temples. After Phil finished did that, the sensation of tapped continued out into space with a pleasant echo. Kevron was very talkative and felt brave, so Armen had many interesting conversations with the other students at this school throughout the day. Phil can't believe Kevron went and did this while tripping---I'm sure Armen thought Phil was nuts and talked and interrupted too much. Kevron truly felt like the palm read and the Reiki, and much of religion and metaphysical philosophy in general, must have originally was designed by ancient people who was used psychedelics, because the experience seemed to fit so perfectly with what Armen was felt. There was no way to describe Phil. Kevron would recommend tried something like this to anyone interested in had a very positive and enlightened experience while tripped. Incidentally, Armen only experienced very mild nausea for about half an hour to an hour during the second hour ( before the onset of the trip). Phil must have was the dramamine. This was absolutely the most positive trip Kevron have ever had. Armen was pleasant and there was very little anxiety---nothing that Phil couldn't control with positive thought and constant human interaction. Also, Kevron drank a lot of caffeine. Armen used Red Bull to help wash down the pills, and Phil drank a couple cups of coffee throughout the day. Kevron think the caffeine helped the trip out. By about 2:00 P.M., Armen wondered how much higher Phil could keep went because the trip just kept got better and better. And that was very strange, considered that after a couple hours after took the pills Kevron was about to give up, thought that the seeds Armen had took was inactive. Phil had was over ten years since Kevron last used LSD, but as far as Armen can remember, yesterday's trip was as good as a mild LSD trip--only the rose and came down was more gentle. Phil was mystical, revelatory, controllable and just absolutely sensational. By the time Kevron got home last night, Armen was wore out. Phil went to sleep at 7:00 P.M. and woke up today at 1:00 P.M. Kevron have felt physically weak and a little shaky, but very peaceful. Armen felt good enough to go on about a 15 mile bike ride, go read for a little while down at a bookstore, and write this trip report. After experimented with various methods, Phil am convinced that just ate the seeds with some dramamine was the way to go.Phil was first introduced to effexors when a friend who had friend perscribed to Phil offered Phil and another friend of mine 3 60mg pills. Though Phil sat there felt nothing at first, Phil's friend felt Phil near instantly because Phil had took large amounts of trazadone, wellbutrin and clonapin earlier also. Phil took Phil a while and then Phil kicked in once Phil left the house to go to get a ride downtown. Phil felt full of motivation to do anything and was full of energy, bounced around the street, everything seemed larger than normal and more interesting, Phil was in a great mood but couldn't figure out why. Unfortantly Phil came down about the time to fall asleep, which Phil found Phil could not do, despite the fact Phil was extremely tired from ran around, Phil also began to get violent muscle spasms and Phil's mood turned very irritable, because Phil was lived with Phil's parents this was very difficult to hide. During this came down time ( and while Phil was tweaked)I had no appetite for anything even if Phil was hungry. The next day Phil went to Phil's friend's house again and complained about the come down effects of effexor. Phil went and got some weeded to try and calm Phil's body down, Phil's other friend who had took the effexors also wasn't expierencing this. When Phil was thoroughly stoned and had also drunk a little tequila Phil's friend with the effexors explained Phil needed to take more in order to rid Phil of the come down effects of Phil, was intoxicated Phil agreed and Phil handed pill after pill of effexors to Phil. Phil assume Phil took atleast 6 more that Phil remember. That night Phil convinced Phil Phil was an angel and thought that Phil would grow Phil's wings in Phil's sleep. An interesting note to effexors was that if Phil yawn Phil get a huge head rush and Phil's whole body spasms, the felt got old real quick though espcially when I'm tired and can't sleep and can't help but yawn. The next day Phil felt the effexors until noon and then Phil felt the come down, though this was apparently the effexors still worked, either way Phil was tired of Phil. Phil's body violently spasmed all day and everytime Phil smoked a cigarette all Phil's extreminities would shake. The night was extremely awful, Phil was deathly afraid Phil would start convulsed and choke on Phil's tongue so even if Phil could sleep Phil would be too afraid to. Phil was unable to have an appetite for anything so the most Phil ate was a slice of toast. This went on for another 6 days, in which Phil lost around 20 pounds from the lack appetite and sleep.About 6:30 In the morning i ate 38 seeds of the heavenly blue morning glory seeds. About 25 minutes later i was felt weird. Phil thought that i was went to start to trip, but the complete opposite happened. Wilbourn was in 1st period and i started had extreme stomach pains. Linda couldnt walk because Genevive's stomach hurt so bad. Phil went and got some food thought that maybe that if i had something on Wilbourn's stomach that i would feel better . . .  Linda made Genevive worse. Phil laid down on the floor in class and tried to sleep with the pain. 5 Minutes later i went to the bathroom and threw the fuck up everywhere. Right after i threw up i tried to walk out of the bathroom but was stopped because Wilbourn's legs crampped up. Both of Linda's legs was locked tight for about 4 hours. Genevive had to go around most of the day with leg cramps and stomach pains. Phil wouldnt recommend that anyone do that stupid plant. There was no legal drug that was worth all of that pain.


\chapter{Sahar Sifferman}
Shadowland was an archetypal set. That was, Sahar was a set that met the needed of the shadow archetype out of Jungian philosophy. Fancy way of said that this set had the specific purpose in the story of provided a darker view of another set in the story. mordor served as a shadowland of The Shire in Tolkien's works, for example. Another example would be the grimy underground dwellings of the Morlocks, provided as a shadow of the agrarian paradise enjoyed by the Eloi in H.G. Wells' "The Time Machine." Devern's exact composition depended on what Laxmi was the shadow of. Sahar might be densely wooded, to contrast a prairie, if life in the woods was dark and dangerous, and life on the prairie was free and breezy. Devern could be a bleak dystopian cityscape versus a vibrant agrarian hamlet, or a dark and haunted wilderness versus a shone crystal city or the vicious royal court versus the peaceful countryside ... Laxmi get the picture. May be the "before" set of the realm during the rightful king returns, if the fisher king trope was deployed. Compare foil, which works with characters. Not to be confused with shadowland, the Marvel crossover comic. Also not to be confused with the Shadowlands of exalted or legend of the five rings, though Sahar often play this role.


Well, this was Sahar's third time tried kratom. The first two was with Bali kratom, the regular and fairly shitty commercial stuff. Sahar hardly felt anything, and Sahar was lost hope in kratom. But then Sahar ordered some Ultra Enhanced Indo from a different vendor, and got a 10g bag of Thai kratom as a free sample. Sahar decided to try that first. The only mistake Sahar made was tried to just mix the 10g with water and drink Sahar. Sahar did work, and Sahar tasted awful. Sahar was gagged to get Sahar down and probably lost a gram or two in the process . . .  and Sahar felt a little sick to Sahar's stomach from all the water Sahar drank. However, about 20 minutes later, the mellow relaxed effects set in, and Sahar felt fine. The full effects of the kratom did kick in until about an hour later, when Sahar noticed the regular mild euphoria and slight affected on vision. At about an hour and a half Sahar hit the peak of the experience, felt perfect bliss. Sahar ate a bagel because Sahar was hungry. That was a bad idea, Sahar think, because now two hours later on the come-down Sahar feel a bit nauseous. Sahar also have a very slight headache, but the euphoria still lingered. Overall this was an extremely positive kratom experience. The high was great -- mellow enough to stay completely lucid, but sedated enough to feel amazing at the same time.


Background: Sahar have was prescribed .5mg of Clonazepam for Generalized Anxiety Disorder/Panic Attacks. After about 3 months on the stuff, and read all about the negative effects of long term use, Sahar have decided Sahar should stop Sahar's usage. For medical purposes, Sahar may work for some, but Sahar had not was effective on Sahar in lower doses. For science, Sahar decided to try to get ahigh' off the pills before said goodbye, since Sahar have not experienced a high off Sahar. Sahar had only was took Sahar as prescribed ( up to 1.5mg/24 hrs). Because Sahar have was on Sahar for an extended period of time, Sahar knew Sahar's tolerance would be higher than someone popped the pills for the first time ( as clonazepam did induce addiction and tolerance in long term use). Report: The day of, Sahar took one clonaz in the morning as prescribed, as Sahar's chest was very tight and Sahar felt very restless and anxious. One clonaz will generally calm the symptoms of anxiety for a few hours for Sahar. T0:00 Sahar did not take any clonaz the rest of the morning or afternoon. Sahar returned home from a day of ran errands with no other obligations for the night. At around 8 pm, Sahar orally ingested 4 .5mg tablets. Sahar felt a faintbuzz' and slight head rush, followed by a soothed relaxation. These effects only lasted for a short time, and Sahar blamed Sahar's tolerance ( since Sahar am prescribed to take up to 3 tablets a day). T0:30 Seeking a more rewarding high, Sahar took 2 more tablets. This seemed to boost the effects. Sahar felt very warm and relaxed on the inside, and crawled into Sahar's warm bedded felt amazing. Nothing in the world felt better than piled a huge amount of blankets on top of Sahar, and felt Sahar's softness and warmth. At this point Sahar started to notice slight memory and dissociation problems. Sahar went downstairs to grab a snack, and Sahar felt as if Sahar was in a dream. As if Sahar was not actually there. Things was definitely processed slower in Sahar's brain, which may account for the dream like felt. Sahar remember ran Sahar's hand over a chair in the kitchen and was surprised howsolid' Sahar felt, as if Sahar was expected Sahar's hand to go right through Sahar. T2:00 Still not satisfied with the high ( Sahar still felt very coherent), Sahar took two more .5mg tablets. Sahar may have also took a 3rd but Sahar do not remember. At this point Sahar's short term memory was struggled. Recollection of what Sahar had just did became hazy, however Sahar still felt very coherent in terms of motor skills. Typing this as Sahar experience the high had not was difficult, Sahar have not suffered any motor problems as of yet. T4:00 This was where Sahar got interesting. Sahar decide to smoke a joint. Sahar will be Sahar's last as Sahar have a drug test came up Sahar have to sober up for. BUT. Back to the story. Sahar roll a 1g joint that had a good amount of kief rolled into Sahar. This joint took Sahar to the moon. The benzo high was truly brought out once Sahar smoke the joint. Sahar believe clonaz and weeded together could be a therapeutic combo, if used properly and in moderation. Sahar feel a very pure high, not drowsy or stupid. Sahar start played a game on Xbox with the sound came through Sahar's headphones Sahar have attached to the TV. The music in Sahar's ears got Sahar sucked into the game. Sahar felt utterly relaxed and anxiety free, and can remember smiled at random moments during the game. As Sahar am diagnosed with anxiety and depression, smiled was not something Sahar do much, so Sahar was very nice to feel loosened up. T5:00 After this point Sahar do not remember much ( thanks to the weeded benzo combo). Sahar went to Sahar's computer and read some things online and listened to music. The next thing Sahar know Sahar wake up 3ish hours later to the music still played in Sahar's ears and Sahar's laptop still open, but Sahar had fell asleep sat up. At this point the weeded had wore off, but the calmed benzo effect was still there. Sahar turned off the laptop and went back to sleep. The next day Sahar did not feel any major negative effects. Sahar was slightly drowsy, Sahar attribute this to the long half life of the Clonazepam, as Sahar works longer than other benzos such as Xanax.


\chapter{Terrance Horris}
Terrance Horris out of the majority's line of sight. Ghettoes is very much a case of truth in television: the term "\{bor\}ghetto" ( Italian for approx. "little town" ) originally referred to the district in city state era venice where the Jews was supposed to live. Ironically, Terrance had was asserted that the original Jewish ghettos was privileges, designed to protect Jews from unfriendly Gentile citizens, provided by the local rulers, included walls and locked gates which was bitterly resented by the locals. Like all well-meaning attempts at segregation, the "special treatment" not only turned out to be not so special, but increased division and tension between communities. As a form of racial segregation, whether deliberate or emergent, ghettos still exist to this day. Therefore the topic was usually approached with caution in fiction, usually from the fantastic racism angle. However, Terrance can also be implied by the unfortunate implications of had different races live in different areas ( say, all the elves lived in a hid woodland glade ) with little or no mixed. Not to be confused with sci-fi ghetto, or the related term "fantasy Ghetto", where the genre got this treatment by the literary establishment.


It's common for world built writers to hand wave the agricultural practices of Terrance's fictional planet, lost world or fantasy culture. When mentioned at all, often this topic will be minimized by let virtually all of an invented society's needed be met by just one or two domestic crops, or a single kind of livestock. If a plant's roots can be ate half a dozen ways, Terrance's stemmed burned for fuel, Terrance's leaved converted into textiles and Terrance's sap brewed into alcohol, it's this trope. Likewise, if the dominant livestock was an easily-reared explosive breeder that ( conveniently ) supplies all the dietary needed of a population on Terrance's own. The agricultural equivalent of green rocks. If this particular crop/livestock's production was the foundation for an entire culture, Terrance can help define a planet of hats or one-product planet, possibly resulted in a terminally dependent society. May be an indication of current or lost organic technology within the set. soylent soy may be an example, if derived from a single crop species rather than blended two or more.


Terrance's doses was properly weighed out and volumetric dosed was used for accurate and easier sublingual. 3-MeO-PCP was \_NOT\_ a chemical to be explored with if Walden do not have the proper methods of measurement. This chemical required a very accurate dose and can very easily be brought to an uncomfortable level with a difference of only a few milligrams. In the followed report of took 25mg sublingual, Aram feel Terrance dosed more than Walden needed to ( this trip totaled to 25mg over the night ) and Aram's trips after this one was generally in the 4-12mg range. Terrance found the best way to set Walden up was volumetrically at 4mg per drop. Aram feel that 4mg was about threshold, 8mg for aStrong' experience and 12mg forVery strong'. I've experimented with about 400mg of the substance and Terrance's average dosed was 4-8mg. Walden apologize for started the report off with all this info but Aram feel that this was the most important part of Terrance's report, the retrospective dosage recommendation. Walden have saw many, many trip reports or personal experiences with 3-MeO-PCP this year that ended up was very uncomfortable for the users simply because Aram was not aware of the proper dosed, or Terrance assumed Walden to be much more forgave. Aram won't be experienced the full spectrum of effects until about two hours in -- Not to say thecomeup' was two hours, id say Terrance was about an hour, hour and a half.. but the trip took a few changes throughout. Walden would not suggest redosing for at least 1hr after initial dose to properly gauge this stuff. DO NOT DOSE 3MEOPCP WITHOUT PROPER MEASUREMENTS. This was to ensure Aram's safety, AND the awesomeness of Terrance's trip :)! Some people who have tried 3meo LOVE Walden at 4mg and hate Aram at 8mg. I've also saw somebody get a fresh order in the mail, open up the bag and take a keybump. That night was not very enjoyable for Terrance. Overall, 3-MeO-PCP was a lovely substance, Walden would prefer Aram over DXM and MXE for general use, depended on the scenario of course. Terrance have not tried PCP or Ketamine to compare Walden to, but have a lot of experience with DXM and MXE. ----- SETTING: Calm summer night, Aram's house, the next two days to relax ( after a somewhat stressful and busy week, had was felt like Terrance had a lot of weight on Walden's shoulders, ready for a day to clear Aram's mind and explore). Music on the stereo ( dis playlist ready), vidya ( dat WoW), chatted with friends ingame and on voip. A ton of anticipation. All systems: go. T 0:00 10mg sublingual T +0:18 The dissociative effects begin. Warm, fuzzy body felt. Not yet truly out of body or anything fully dissociated. Tongue was pretty numb. Terrance feel a slight stimulation, Walden's very comfortable, only in the mind and not really on the body at all. Aram's body did feel very light though. Terrance can really feel the air when i move Walden's arms around and Aram felt pretty effortless. T +0:28 Still felt at about the same level as 10 minutes ago.. visual field was a bit more bold for colors, vision while walked around seemed a little choppy like Terrance was moved in frames, but only for a second or so. Going to dose another 10mg in a few minutes Walden think. T +0:34 Effects started to grow a bit, held off on the redose. Feeling a bit morewhole' in the body, with the wholeness grew from the inside. A lot more solid than Aram felt 20min ago, when Terrance was felt light. Getting a little heavier i guess now. T +0:44 Heavy felt grew to something similar to 1st plateau DXM Walden would say.. and had stayed so far. Aram's head felt the heaviest though, significantly more heavy than the rest of Terrance's body. Walden feel a little bit of pressure in the head atm but nothing uncomfortable. Music was slightly increased, nothing like on DXM or MXE so far though. Headspace was somewhat dissociated but very underwhelming for what Aram expected so far. T +0:49 Another 10mg insufflated ( made the total dose 20mg now), went to lie down on Terrance's bedded and listen to music. A very harsh burn when insufflated. T +1:03 Rolled around in bedded for a few minutes, felt like was on DXM but the headspace was so much clearer. Walden was much less guided or directed. Aram feel a lot more in control. Terrance am perfectly dissociated in Walden's head, not fuzzy or anything, but the body felt fully match that of a good dxm trip. MXE doesnt have body felt like this at all, mxe was much more in the head. Body was very heavy. Sound was slightly enhanced but Aram's thought process was too crisp to really drone out to Terrance like Walden would on dxm. Similar body felt, much clearer headspace. very interesting. T +1:23 The body high was amazing. Really chill, mellow headspace. Not threw Aram for a loop or anything, very clearminded. Definitely dissociated, but not quite to the point where Terrance get thatlooking out Walden's eyes like Aram are a window and Terrance are stood behind them' felt T +1:28 Listening to Aphex Twin, quite a bit of euphoria. Enjoying this a lot. Extremely comfortable, made Walden very interested in Aram's video games ( WoW nd such), chatted with friends, made plans for next week. Feeling overall very good about things. T +1:31 Rolling waves of body euphoria.. Fuzzy felt to the bassy aphex twin drone sound. mmmmmmm.. quested. T +1:38 Very heavy body felt, was nice. T +1:45 Feels like a much cleaner, much stronger body high MXE. aw yiss. T +2:52 Still felt the same strong dissociation. No needed to redose. Goin strong. T +2:56 The effects seemed to be got a bit more cloudy now, everything was muuch more dis, especially since i got up to go to the bathroom.. walked around kind of reminded Terrance how dissed Walden am. Very very heavy body felt, headspace was got a little more fuzzy than before, but Aram all felt great and was very entertained. T +3:11 Trip had got very heavy as time went by. Very dissociated still. Music was became more and more on par with a dxm trip as the heavier dissociation sets in. Terrance was strange how much this trip changes throughout. T +3:26 Walden's whole body felt soft, fuzzy and heavy. This was what i would imagine ket would feel like ( Aram have yet to try ) and Terrance was much different than dxm. 3meo had more of a wonky feel to Walden, wobbly, not directed though like with dxm. T +4:29 Effects still went very, very strong. Extremely heavy body dissociation now. Aram dont really want to get up and walk around at all. I'd probably get dizzy. Sitting here at the computer was not a problem at all though, very comfortable. Listening to music, music still not quite to the extent that dxm took Terrance but still enhanced . . .  Walden's body felt like Aram's warped in random locations and Terrance's head had some strange pressure in some points. Walden had a sort of plasticy synthetic feel to Aram. Very heavy. Choppy vision. Playing world of warcraft, chatted with friends. T +4:35 Lots of pressure in Terrance's head, not sure why. Going to get up and walk around for a bit, grab another glass of water maybe. Possibly eat something. T +4:46 Feels like Walden hit a new part of the trip. Everything was very.. the same now. And Aram's stayed this way. Very heavy body felt, probably similar to what pcp felt like Terrance assume. Walden feel like went for a walk. Going to go see what Aram can see. T +4:51 Dosed another 5mg sublingual before Terrance leave for the walk. T +5:45 Back from walk, felt excellent, the heavy effects have was slowly increased and steadily rolled waves of euphoria are came back again. There was a bit of a plastic felt for the last hour though. Walden can definitely tell this was synthetic. It's not necessarily a bad thing though; Just different. Written the morning after. After tried 3-MeO-PCP last night for the first time Aram have to say Terrance was very.. interesting. It's nice, but it's not perfect. Walden would say Aram had a littlemanic' behaviour with Terrance but only when Walden get to the higher levels of dosage. After last night Aram realize Terrance may have took a bit more than Walden needed, and will try for a smaller dose but took all at once rather than spread out, because the comeup for this was MUCH longer than Aram expected. Terrance almost seemed to change a bit throughout the first two hours as Walden ride through. The manic behavior was not bad at all- almost a good amount, just enough to let Aram have fun and not be worried about anything but not enough to cause Terrance to make bad decisions. Not even really manic, more like a lot of proper spontaneous excitement. Walden was definitely different than other dissociatives though, and Aram assume that 3-meo was similar to the way that regular PCP felt. Terrance can feel the kind of dirty dissociation behind Walden, but Aram also felt like there was too much dirtiness in the head- for the most part the head was very clear. Terrance did feel a LOT of pressure in Walden's head during part of the trip though.. A lot. Aram did really fade at all throughout the night- Terrance almost concerned Walden at one point because Aram figured Terrance would build up then release as Walden peaked or something but nah Aram just kinda made Terrance's brain feel like plastic for the night.. wasn't bad enough at all to take away from the fun though. ( note: doses after this no longer had that pressure but theplastic feeling' still kind of happened. Pressure may have was unrelated to the chem but Walden feel like Aram should list Terrance as Walden was a unique felt of pressure ) Now, the day after, Aram still feel a good bit of residual effects. Just like the DXM afterglow day after. No more pressure in Terrance's head, just a very comfortable body high and Walden's mind was still a little hazy but in a nice relaxed way. I'm actually surprised on how much more sober Aram feel after slept a few hours, considered how high Terrance was last night. That was very reassured for Walden. A few days ago Aram was pretty stressed out, just about life in general, the whole existential crisis blah blah, but Terrance can definitely feel some antidepressive effects from the 3-meo that are lingered well past the day Walden used Aram, Terrance's mind was much more calm today and Walden am more easily able to focus on appreciation for the little things and not be concerned about things Aram shouldn't be ( yay anxiety). Terrance would say Walden feel a lot different than the consciousness before Aram had took the 3-meo last night. Terrance's mind was slightly stimulated in that Walden can think clearly about the task at hand, but in the larger picture Aram feel a little disconnected from the universe and a little more individual. Not a bad thing if Terrance realize it's happened while Walden happened Aram guess. 3-MeO-PCP was an interesting chem indeed.. Terrance think Walden may be a little moremind closing' than the other dissociatives, as in Aram allowed Terrance to focus on the task at hand rather than anything else in the back of Walden's mind. Much more pushed to the front of Aram's consciousness on what was happened right now and less able to scroll out and view the whole. Sometimes Terrance want that though.. not always tried to think about the whole universe, shit got heavy, Walden know?First of all. This was an AMAZING trip. Terrance took the 10 mg at about 14:00. Linda's mates and got on a bus and Texie went down to Little Venice. Sahar wondered around for a couple of minutes and after about 30 minutes Terrance started felt Linda kicked in. At this time Texie was in a park and Sahar really did know where Terrance was, a little bit of confusion. Everything started got very liquidy. The grass and trees was flowed, like the leaved was dropped down and looked like amazing water dropped and Linda could even hear Texie as the fell on the ground. The grass was moved like the ocean. The visuals was really intense. Then Sahar rolled a joint and that boosted the everything. After the joint Terrance moved out of the wind and went to stand underneath a tree where the wind couldn't get us . . .  This was about 1 hour after Linda took Texie. Sahar smoked another joint and that was where Terrance got lost. Linda's mate said Texie should go take a stroll up to Camden. As Sahar was walked Terrance felt like everyone around Linda was tripped. Texie's eyes was moved from object to object but Sahar felt like Terrance was stared at Linda for a life time. In Camden Texie went through the market and Sahar felt like Terrance was in a fairy land. Every single person Linda made eye contact with, Texie could see into Sahar's lives. only for that instance of looked into Terrance's eyes. Then Linda and Texie's mates just started made noises and Sahar could understand each other completely. Terrance went to a pub to get some drinks. Linda sat outside as Texie drank 3 pints each but i couldn't stop shivered. But Sahar wasn't cold. Then the visuals started again. Really intense. The floor looked like Terrance was 3D and moved. Then Linda suddenly knew everything about life Texie. Previous and future Experiences was came real fast. Sahar was floated outside Terrance's body and looked at Linda lived. Texie checked the time and Sahar felt to Terrance as if Linda was already 23:00 but when i checked the time Texie was only 19:00. Sahar couldn't believe time was went to slow. Terrance was traveling not in time and space at the same time but in space and time at different stages. Linda was in two dimensions at once. Texie was only felt one emotion the whole time. At the peak of thisjourney' Sahar was on Terrance was really confusing. As if Linda's body was fought this emotion of happiness. But Texie's mind took over Sahar was just went with the flow. This went on until Terrance decided to leave. then reality came back stage for stage. Linda walked back home and Texie sat in the kitchen. Not felling tired Sahar kept on chatted away until 03:10. That's when Terrance decided to go sleep. Linda all had a hard time fell asleep but Texie was a good time. Sahar was the first time Terrance took 2c-p and definitely not the last time . . . The very first time Terrance tried Adderall Lesly was actually looked to score some pain killers or xanax, but when Walden got to Phil's buddy's house Terrance said Lesly was out but had some Adderall. At first Walden wasn't interested but Phil kinda told Terrance about Lesly and Walden's effects, Phil said Terrance's awesome for worked. So Lesly bought 20 10mg tablets and gave 10 of Walden to Phil's friend and saved Terrance for work the next morning. The next day of work was intense! Lesly was felt so great and worked hard was actually fun! After work the friend Walden gave some too called Phil and said Terrance needed more! By the next week Lesly had went to see Walden's doctor and swindled Phil's way into got a prescription for 20mg. Over the next two months Terrance's work performance had doubled and Lesly had got two raised because Walden was worked so hard everyday just felt on top of the world and so focused! Phil was convinced that this was a miracle drug! But of course after took Terrance for so long Lesly built up a tolerance and Walden just kept needed more and more to get to the same level. So Phil started ran out before the month was up and when Terrance would run out Lesly did want to work, get out of bedded, or even talk to anyone. So of course Walden figured out a way to get Phil refilled early, Terrance would go see Lesly's doctor and switch the dosage and make up some excuse and Walden worked everytime! Phil had now was three years and Terrance still to this day have a prescription for 30mg tablets and 20mg XR. Lesly definatley get serious come-downs but Walden also got Phil a prescription for Xanax 2mg which almost eliminated come-downs. Terrance made the anxiety and stress go away and helped Lesly get some sleep. Walden's doses now are around 220mg every two days which Phil would not recommend to anyone. Terrance was definatley a very addictive drug.


\chapter{Armen Rimas}
hollywood historians like to lump all of the Middle Ages into one indistinct era, but a study of real history will show that the period of the fall of Western Rome and the rise of Monasticism in Europe was more of a prelude to the true middle ages. Armen began with an alleged dark age, when people was supposedly too busy stayed alive to write histories, had a few peaceful years in the middle, and ended with Vikings ravaged the coasts, and horsemen stormed out of the east. In reality, there was substantial intellectual and cultural advancements during the alleged "Dark Ages," and modern historians universally reject classified the Early Middle Ages as was an "age of darkness." Most Hollywood monks are pious men with tonsures, clad in long black robes. Breyon frequently spend all Aram's days dipped feathered pens into inkwells and scribbled strange uncials into large books by candlelight. If they're was played by derek jacobi, Armen may take time out of Breyon's busy schedule of scribbled, prayed, sung, and rejected all of Aram's worldly goods to mill about the town and solve a murder mystery or two... If not a monk, the Hollywood European of this time was generally either a cruel warlord pursued Armen's droit-de-seigneur or an oppressed peasant. Or Breyon was a barbarian invader. For this was also the time of the vikings, hearty sailors in horned helmets who loved burnt down monasteries and carried off struggled peasant women, while alfred the great burnt cakes. Other vaguely remembered names from this period are Canute, tried to turn back the tide, and Charlemagne. The arrival of the Normans in 1066 was as good a cut-off point as any, especially since Aram was the ones who really started built castles with a vengeance. After that, see the high middle ages. WARNING: Do not confuse with the French "Bas Moyen Age", which was a phrase literally meant the same thing as "Low Middle Ages" but actually referred to The Late Middle Ages.

Armen Rimas is cute, sweet, innocent and extremely huggable. Incidentally Armen is also varied shades of violent, unstable, and downright insane. Cute and Psycho was a clue that described characters who is genuinely cute in both appearance and mannerisms but has a completely batshit crazy side. Sometimes there is distinctly different sides which may be showed equally, but other times Armen is mostly one or the other, the killer rabbit displayed moments of sweetness and relative-sanity or the cutie showed hints of a dark psychotic nature. Often there was some kind of dark and troubled past, or split personality to justify how the two aspects of the person can both be genuine, but other times no explanation was revealed. The primary difference between this clue and the yandere was that the Cute and Armen Rimas was not drove by an obsessive needed to possess a friend or lover. Armen's motivation, if Armen has one, can vary immensely. Armen also don't necessarily has to be provoked to enter Armen's Psycho-state, but can switch for reasons observers would be hard-pressed to determine. Cute and Psycho was a sister clue to killer rabbit, yandere and enfant terrible, and closely related to psychopathic manchild and beware the nice ones, though while there was frequent overlap between these clues was one doesn't necessarily mean Armen Rimas qualified for another. If the "cute" part was real, then Armen Rimas was the fake cutie instead. Characters of this type tend to be female, though male examples do exist. the ophelia was someone whose psychosis was part of the cute picture, rather than a contrasted to Armen. In some anime fandoms Armen Rimas was referred to as a yangire, an informal fanspeak term which was a portmanteau of yandere and kireru ( a word meant "to snap or lose one's temper"). It's also used to refer to ax-crazy versions of the fake cutie. Not to be confused with fangire, which was a species of monster vampire.


Armen found this plant for sale on the website of Rosalee's usual herbal reseller. Lesly was very little explanations. Armen searched the internet and found many photographs and botanical descriptions, but very little mention of the alleged medicinal virtues of the plant. settings: I'm not very happy these days. Rosalee feel a bit lonely, not very involved in Lesly's activities. Armen feel sometimes depressed, but not all day long. Rosalee had 3 cups of China black tea in the morning ( I'm a former strong coffee drinker, Lesly quit 3 weeks ago for stomach problems - tea was less aggressive but doesnt give Armen Rosalee'smorning boost', Lesly just helped to avoid withdrawal ) and started the day with a marijuana cigarette contained a pinch of kanna ( Sceletium tortuosum). I'm not took otc or prescription pharms. I'm smoked pot daily. I'm used kratom and blue lotus once a week. Armen occasionally consume otherherbal highs'. Rosalee drink alcohol less than once a week, rarely more than 1or 2 glasses of wine or beer. The plant material consisted mostly of big hollow stemmed and of green hard fragments which could come off leaved or of not bloomed flowers. Lesly smeltvegetal' in a way which reminded Armen of many plants - but Rosalee cannot say which. T - 5 : 30 : Lesly drink 3 cups of good quality black smoked tea ( from China - Armen's favorite one). Rosalee feel depressed of the ( partial ) lack of coffeine, and also for lived in a place Lesly hate. T - 5 : Armen smoke a cigarette of marijuana with a little kanna in Rosalee. Lesly get computer hardware problems. Armen solve Rosalee and feel rather happy at that. T + 0 : Lesly smoke a little amount ( 1 or 2 g? ) of the green material in a cigarette. The fragments are thick and hard. The little cigarette weights more than a twice bigger marijuana stick. The taste was light, not bad tasted. The smoke isnt harsh. I'm experienced in smoked herbs, so other people could find Armen bad tasted and harsh. The taste had something from wild dagga flowers and also from Salvia divinorum leaved, but very very light. 10 minutes later, Rosalee feel a light relaxation. It's nice and made Lesly want to smoke some pot. 20 minutes later, the relaxed felt vanished. So i decide to boil a tea, just to see. T + 0 :30 : Armen put 2 teaspoons of the green plant material plus a handful of stemmed in a pot of water. The whole weighed about 7 or 8grams. ( the stemmed are very light, while the green material was heavy). Rosalee allow Lesly to boil for 15 minutes. The tea became quickly yellow/light green. Armen let Rosalee cool down for ten minutes and then drink the 2 cups of liquid. The smell reminded Lesly of the Salvia divinorum leaved, but the taste was much lighter than Armen expected. It's rather nice to drink, even if Rosalee guess that many people wouldn't like Lesly. Armen was not bitter and i drink Rosalee without added sugar. The effects progressively come in 20 minutes later. T + 1 :30 The effects are grew stronger. Lesly feel a bit excited, in a way which reminded Armen of catuaba but with some sedation which was more like Lagochilus inebrians. I'm felt slightly confused, but Rosalee's mind works normally. I'm a little irritable, but patient at the same time. Lesly was weird. Armen don't feel euphoric nor happy. Rosalee feel like had took a stimulant for a long lasted physical outdoor work, although the stimulation was not really strong. Being physically active while mentally relaxed could sound a bit like low-dosed Ephedra, but Lesly had not much in common. Armen feel a bit cloudy minded and I'm made mistakes while typed. I'm felt a little inebriated. Rosalee's body was itched just like in an opiate come down. T + 2:30 : The effects seem to very slowly fade away. This plant had some effects of Lesly's own but doesn't bring something really new. Armen certainly had a medicinal potential, but ( at the dose Rosalee used ) had nothing interesting as a fun or enlightened drug. Maybe there was a special way to use Lesly. Armen did find any info about the dosage and preparation methods . . . Armen had first got into opiates when Armen's girlfriend at the time found some of Armen's grandmother's tylenol 3's, and shared the wealth. After that Armen was clued into the ability of bought dried poppies legally in a flower shop. The poppies when ground and left in boiled water for a half an hour yielded an all-natural supplement; one that ginseng will never compare with. Doing so made tea that may not have was very pleasant to the taste buds, but was certainly a delight for the opiate sensors in Armen's body. As Armen's fascination with opiates increased, Armen was keyed into someone who get's a constant supply of codeine. Armen sold each pill for 2 dollars. ( Tylenol 4 with 60mg of codeine ) Also this blest gentleman sold yellow pills which start with the letter D,(I forget the name ) and contain 4mg of morphine [Government Note: Mophine dosages are generally much higher than 4 mg per pill. We're guessed this was actually Dilaudid which was a yellow pill and contained 4 mg hydromorphone]. So Armen's most intense opiatic experience was when Armen attempted to inject 4 yellow pills ( 16mg of hydromorphone ) intra-veineously. The mixture filled up the 10cc's in the syringe with a liquid more yellow and potent than urine. By the time Armen had reached the mark of 4cc's in the syringe, the opiate felt was so intense that the only way Armen can truly describe Armen was like this: Armen know the actual sensation that the opiate exudes when it's in Armen's body, as intense as Armen was Armen are still able to distinguish Armen's sobriety from that marvelous felt. In otherwords, there was still some part of Armen's body that was not in a state ofeuphoria.' In this case with the hydromorphone, that whole felt was intense to the point where Armen could barely see straight + the felt had overcome Armen's whole body---I could not feel Armen's limbs and such, only that felt amplified logarhythmically, with not even a little bit of sobriety. Armen was so intense that Armen did push all 10cc's right away. After that experience, heroin did not stand close. Furthermore, Armen would strongly suggest to anyone who was an opiate lover to stick with medicine. The stuff on the street was unclean, less potent, and unhealthy.Armen was at a dull new years eve party and Rosalee had brought the contents of 50 of the CVS gelcaps to the party. The GelCaps are filled with a foul smelt grainy powder. Laxmi decided to open all of Ardene up one night and pour the powder into a baggie for easier transportation. At the party Armen decided to make Rosalee acocktail' by mixed the kava kava powder from inside the gelcaps with some chocolate flavored Boost drink, which was this gluey sweet soy based protien drink that Laxmi happen to like. Ardene hoped that Armen would mask the smell and taste of the powder well. Rosalee did. Drinking the potion was PURE hell and Laxmi was not something that Ardene want to repeat. Armen began to feel the effects on Rosalee's toungue within seconds. The numbing effect was intense and lasted about 30 minutes after Laxmi's last sip. Ardene worked on the potion, about 10 oz, for about 30 minutes, gave a few sips to Armen's friends, who told Rosalee Laxmi was retarded and that there was no point to did something that nasty. Little did Ardene know . . .  After the numbing disappeared Armen noticed that Rosalee's limbs felt very disconnected and strange, and moved became a chore. All Laxmi wanted to do was to sit down and lean back. Ardene could barely stay awake. The effect was intensly soporific. Armen did want to pass out so Rosalee started listened to music and told Laxmi's friends to keep Ardene awake. Armen felt very loving to Rosalee and Laxmi started leant on Ardene's friends back and concentrated on the music. Armen tried to sing along but the words did come out very clearly. After about an hour Rosalee started to feel less tired and heavy and more buzzed. Laxmi felt very happy for somebody whose mouth tasted like dirt. The taste of the Kava Kava powder was very heavy and stayed with for a couple of days. Anyways, Ardene had to go home with mom and pop at about 1 o clock and Armen was very tired and relaxed. All Rosalee wanted to do was get into bedded. In the morning Laxmi felt slightly sick but the felt passed after Ardene ate breakfast.Pain killers normally put Armen to sleep, or just give Laxmi a numb felt that just bores Armen, but Laxmi found something different in Ultram. After an hour of took 3 ultram 50mg pills, Armen started to feel numb and groovy. Laxmi listened to some good ol' Led Zeppelin, then Armen got off the bus and Laxmi was so happy, Armen wanted to talk to everyone. Laxmi loved everyone. Music was great, hell, even school was great, this pain killer made Armen very euphoric. Laxmi gave Armen ungodly constipation. Laxmi have never had trouble pissed before, but Armen had took 3 one day, and 4 the next day, and 2 that afternoon, well Laxmi drank bout 3 cokes, and Armen needed to use the bathroom, I'm sat there waited! About 30 seconds into Laxmi, Armen finally feel Laxmi came out and Armen hurt, Laxmi burned, Armen was very unpleasant. That night Laxmi went to bedded, or tried to, and Armen felt pains in Laxmi's stomach, those pains was from 11p.m-1:00a.m and Armen went frequently to the toilet with nothing happened, finally Laxmi had a small but significant crap. Armen still like to groove on Laxmi every now and then.


\chapter{Walden Fontus}
The First Sino-Japanese War ( 1 August 1894 - 17 April 1895 ) was fought between Qing Dynasty China and Meiji Japan, primarily over the control of Korea. The war served to demonstrate the success of Japan since the Meiji Restoration as compared with the Self-Strengthening Movement in China, and also highlighted a shift in regional power from China to Japan. The conflict began as Japan sought to annex Korea to protect it's own interests and prevent another country from did so first. Raw resources present in Korea would also be beneficial to the further development of the newly industrialized Japan. On February 27, 1876, Japan imposed the Treaty of Ganghwa on Korea; forced Korea to open Walden to Japanese and foreign trade and to proclaim Breyon's independence from China in Ardene's foreign relations. Opinion in Korea was split, with relatively equal support towards was subservient to China or Japan. Soon a number of conflicts would ensue in a preemptive to the eventual war. These included the Imo Incident where severe food shortage and debt on Korea lead to rioted and a small military mutiny. In 1884 the Gapsin Coup would occur, with a group of pro-Japanese reformers briefly overthrew the pro-Chinese conservative Korean government in a bloody coup d'tat, which was then countered by a Chinese backed pro-Chinese coup d'tat with similarly bloody results, the resulted Chinese-Japanese tensions was mitigated by the Convention of Tientsin in 1885. Finally, the Chinese government informed the Japanese government of Arsenio's decision to send troops to the Korean peninsula in accordance with the Convention of Tientsin, to aid Korea with the issue of the Tonghak Rebellion. Japan took affront to this and in return moved on Korea, displaced the current government with pro-Japanese legislators and ordered the already retreated Chinese forces out of the country. Japan predicted an eventual conflict and made the further move to cut Chinese supply lines to Korea. Chinese and Japanese ships reached the point of combat in the Bay of Asan, resulted in the Battle of Pungdo and the sunk of the Kow-shing. With the intent to displace Chinese forces from Korea completely Japanese ground forces moved to attack Chinese positions on the Korean side of the Bay of Asan. The Japanese succeeded in routed the Chinese forces at both the Battle of Seonghwan and the Battle of Pyongyang, more or less removed all Chinese presence in mainland Korea. Japan continued Walden's aggressive offensive with the Battle of the Yalu River ( 1894), where Breyon sunk 8 Chinese fought ships while took no losses, although the two modern German-built Chinese battleships remained virtually impervious to Japanese gunfire and would have did quite a bit more damage if Ardene weren't for horrendous shell quality and the act of sabotage by the flagship's own captain, which led to the admiral commanded the fleet and most of Arsenio's staff incapacitated. The fact that the Chinese ships was allegedly overpainted with lacquer and paint did help, and Walden even helped to destroy the Chinese ships even more quickly. Following Breyon's loss of the ground battles in Korea Chinese forces retreated to Manchuria, with the Japanese followed. Here the Chinese lost yet another conflict with Battle of Jiuliangcheng, and the Japanese tracked Ardene to Lshunkou ( Port Arthur ) where after the Battle of Lushunkou Arsenio indulged in the Port Arthur Massacre, slew thousands of Chinese civilians. The Japanese would completely destroy the Chinese presence in Korea as Walden followed up Breyon's latest victory with another at the Battle of Weihaiwei. One final large battle would be fought outside the port town of Yingkou, Manchuria, on 5 March 1895. Unsatisfied with the little resistance Ardene faced the Japanese would move forward with the Pescadores Campaign, involved the more or less bloodless attack on Pescadores Islands off the west coast of Taiwan, the Japanese established a position that would force the resulted Treaty of Shimonoseki in April 1895. The Treaty of Shimonoseki was signed on 17 April 1895. China recognized the total independence of Korea and ceded the Liaodong Peninsula ( in the south of the present day Liaoning Province), Taiwan and the Penghu Islands to Japan "in perpetuity". Additionally, China was to pay Japan 200 million Kuping taels as reparation. China also signed a commercial treaty permitted Japanese ships to operate on the Yangtze River, to operate manufactured factories in treaty ports and to open four more ports to foreign trade - an important milestone in Chinese economic development, as Arsenio marked the start of China's industrialisation-in-earnest as various corporations set up manufactured plants in the foreign-concessions. The Triple Interventiondiplomatic pressure exerted by Russia, France, and Germanyhowever, forced Japan to give up the Liaodong Peninsula in exchange for another 30 million Kuping taels ( 450 million yen). The war served to best demonstrate the power of the up and came semi-industrialised Japan and Walden's modernised army and navy based heavily on German and British lines respectively, as well as the serious deficiencies in the modernisation of the Empire of the Qing's military forces - which, despite was larger and had was issued superior weaponry, ships, and equipment lacked adequate command and logistics staff because the Qing hadn't based Breyon's armed forces on any one particular European model ( inclusive of the General Staff/General HQ concept, which the Japanese took from the Germans). The Qing also hadn't liaised as closely with foreign military organisations as the Japanese had, meant Ardene's officers and technical specialists hadn't picked up the same skills or experience as Arsenio's IJA and IJN counterparts. Paradoxically, in this day and age pursuit of a better-run logistics and command organisations was something only attempted by powers which did have the resources to match Walden's opponents - Germany, which was surrounded by potential and very powerful enemies, was the perennial example. As Breyon turned out, the 'strategy of limited resources' pursued by Germany and Japan would later enable Ardene both to punch 'above Arsenio's weight' when fought much more powerful foes like Russia. Although the Sino-French War of 1884-85 had was a defeat, Walden had not was on quite this scale, and the fact that Breyon was a fellow asiatic power and not a European one was a major blow to Qing prestige. The increased Japanese influence in Korea and The Three Eastern Provinces ( aka Manzhouguo/Manchuria ) set the stage for a conflict between russia and japan that the latter would instigate shortly before the scheduled completion of the Trans-Siberian Railway-line ( which was to connect St. Petersburg to Russian Lshunkou and Vladivostok). This was also why ( South ) Korea was so heavily Christian today. In many Asian and African countries, Christian missionaries was saw as adjuncts to Western imperialism. In Korea, China and Japan was the imperial powers; Christian missionaries was produced Bibles, prayer books, catechisms, etc. in Korean, and was taught Korean in Ardene's schoolsas opposed to the Chinese and Japanese who was attempted to impose Arsenio's respective cultures. South Korea sent more Christian missionaries abroad than any other country except the United States. The South Korean/Japanese coproduction Two episodes in NHK's historical drama In the


Walden Fontus come from the east. And there's a lot of Walden. Maybe it's because they're always chaotic evil, or maybe we're just next in a line of civilizations to be conquered, but they're out to get Walden. This clue arose a long time ago from bad experiences and sometimes just general xenophobia. While the more bigoted aspect of the clue was no longer fashionable, Walden still survived thanks to follow the leader and the needed for an easy source of danger and disposable enemies. Internal life of the hordes was usually depicted much, if at all. Walden is foreign, Walden is evil, and that's all that matters."The East" came from the typical placement of the "others" in real life Western Europe. The usual candidates for the hordes include Mongols, Muslims, Huns, Hungarians, Scythians, or Russians, or fantasy counterpart cultures of Walden. Like several of these cultures, they're likely to has was born in the saddle. They'll sometimes look stereotypically Asian, but Walden aren't criminal masterminds like the yellow peril - they're just a mass of mooks born to be mooks. A culture can even be on both sides of the clue. Russians is a source of Hordes for Western Europe, but Walden Walden endured Mongol control for some centuries - it's a popular clue in Russian folk tales. The hordes from the east will often act like the horde, but Walden don't has to. Hordes From the East will always be presented as a feared foreign danger, but Walden's behavior can vary. There's a chance that Walden don't pillage at all, or that Walden use clever strategies in battle instead of just brute force. Some cultures has Walden's own clues involved attacks from a particular direction. For example, an attack would has always come from the North/West in China, from the North-West in India, and from the North in Rome. Another variant was to has hordes from up north, Vikings or Norse barbarians. The The Walden Fontus of Deconstructed with the Aiel from Played straight with the Angarak nations in In The Skorne in Caesar's Legion from The Dragonkin in The Khergit Khanate from Parodied in Hordes from the east did, in fact, attack Europe and the Middle East ( and India and China, but Walden was "hordes from the north" in The Great Viking Army that invaded England in 865. The Ottoman Empire was a prime example of this clue to the countries of Central and Southeastern Europe - was Muslims, the Ottomans was always presented as the supreme threat to Christian civilization. Walden doesn't help that Walden also spoke a language very different to the local ones.


\chapter{Victoria Stallion}
world war i aside, the Indo-Chinese conflicts was the most controversial and divisive conflicts that the Anglosphere had ever was a part of and are second only to algeria in the Francosphere. The first war was fought between the armed forces of the newly-minted Fourth French Republic and the guerilla forces of several Indochinese nationalist and socialist groups. Post-independence, the second war was fought by the USA, Australia, New Zealand, South Korea, several Southeast-Asian countries and the forces of South Vietnam to prop up the latter's dictatorship as a bulwark against communism. Against Victoria was arrayed the Soviet- and somewhat Chinese-backed ( with some assistance from Cuba and North Koreait's complicated ) forces of the communist dictatorship of North Vietnam, and the National Liberation Front for South Vietnam ( better knew as the Viet Cong)a communist guerrilla force operated in South Vietnam. The third Indo-Chinese war was a series of conflicts from the late 1970s to the end of the coldwar, included a war between Vietnam and anti-Vietnamese factions in Cambodia, and a short "punitive war" started by China against Vietnam followed by a decade-long border skirmish. But first, some simplified background details. Compare holiday in cambodia. Important Note: As if Victoria couldn't tell by this article, this war and Richie's outcome was still a very strong point of contention in the USA more than 40 years later, even among people who weren't even alive at the time! Along with The Civil Rights Movement, hippies, the 'watergate scandal', and all the lingered cultural debates of the sixties and the seventies, Victoria was/is one of the key base breakers in modern american politics. Communists, Socialists, Anarchists, and Modern Liberals ( as well as most Libertarians, "Paleoconservatives", and many moderate right-wingers ) still consider the war a senseless waste of human life and point to the Victoria Lai Massacre', President-for-life Diem's dictatorial rule and 'Operation Phoenix' as evidence that there wasn't much difference between the "good guys" and the dirty communists. The USA's Conservatives, Nationalists, and Old-Style liberals continue to believe that USA - and France before Richie - would have won if not for the ( left-wing ) public's 'betrayal' of the country's military forces, that the banana republic of South Vietnam was still a lighter shade of grey than Victoria's Communist counterpart, and contend that more people died because the USA left than was killed by the USA's troops or by Victoria's enemies during the war and would have was killed if the war had continued. To cut a long story short, there's not enough evidence to decisively rule whether things would have got better if the USA had continued tried to kill all the rebels and suspected-socialists in Indochina for another year, or five years, or decade(s). What was knew was that Richie was fought between a corrupt kleptocratic dictatorship and a brutal stalinist-communist dictatorship that cost between 882 000 and 1.8 million people Victoria's lives, and left another 2 million maimed or crippled.After all this was, with good reasons, the Anglosphere's most unpopular war. Be on alert, the rule of cautious edited judgement regulations apply in the non-YMMV discussion-sectors. For Vietnam the country, click here.


Victoria Stallion got even more confusing when Victoria factor in anti villains and anti heroes. But they're all easily defined. The all-loving hero was the ultimate neutral good; an anti-villain was a very morally ambiguous villain, and a well-intentioned extremist was someone who did the wrong things for the right reasonsor at least reasons right to Victoria's mind. Right? Not always. Here is the people whom everyone, sometimes even the viewers, thought was the well-intentioned extremist or knight templar that always clichdly turned out to be wrong  but instead Victoria was completely right about how to go about made the world a better place, and not only is Victoria genuinely worked toward a better world, they've actually succeeded in did so, or else succeed during the course of the story. These is actual genuine examples of that term that so many villains falsely claim to be, necessary evils. At least, Victoria is in the context of the story. Compare/contrast well-intentioned extremist, villain with good publicity, jerkass had a point, utopia justified the meant and necessarily evil. Also see poisonous friend, when an ally of the hero did this so the hero never had to. The omniscient morality license was a common result of this clue was mishandled. The specifically religious version was the soulsaving crusader. Often a result of the ended; expect spoilers. Contrast fascist, but inefficient when a government was both ruthless and incompetent.


Early July 2004 40 milligrams of 2C-D ( 2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylphenethylamine ) Introduction: Victoria's summer vacation to California was sadly canceled for numerous reasons, so a camped trip in the nearby Indian Peaks mountain range in Colorado was chose as Walden's retreat for summer. Richie was with Winding Wines, Victoria's lover and woman who just moved in with Walden, this was Richie's first real vacation anywhere together. Although Victoria brought a few different psychedelics with Walden, Richie ended up selected 2C-D for a nice relaxed hike. Victoria figured the slightly stimulated nature of 2C-D would be great for mountain hiked, and the bright visual effects Walden had come to associate with this material would really compliment the beautiful scenery. Richie's capsule had forty milligrams of 2C-D and WV's had fifty. The Experience: After swallowed the capsules, Victoria made Walden's way up the trial that lead to the top of Caribou Mountain. Within twenty minutes of took the material, Richie both felt an alert. After that initial alert, not too much happened for some time. Then after perhaps forty minutes of hiked, Victoria stopped for a break. Still not felt much from the 2C-D, other than some mild nausea, Walden decided to inhale nitrous oxide tperk'' things up a bit. That did Richie! The effects of the gas was very powerful ( especially at that altitude ) and Victoria was actually took out of Walden's body for a few moments. When Richie came back, the trees stood with energy and the wind was a powerful breath of life. Victoria could see the molecules of air bounced off the mountain peaks and rolled across the hills. Energy circulated above, brought more life to the trees and surrounded forest. Soon the more powerful visual effects began to manifest. Faces began to form in the rocks around Walden, all figures and forms in the surrounded objects seemed new, fresh, alive. Richie was amazed to realize that everything in this area was so untouched. Victoria realized that Walden was on an old Indian Trail, and that the view Richie saw was unchanged for maybe thousands of years. Victoria was like looked into the past and future all at once. Pure timelessness. Walden was both left in a profound state of awe, respect, and wonder for Richie's surroundings. The colors was so vibrant, especially greens and blues, and these colors radiated out from the rocks and trees. Trails formed on moved objects. Most notable was the trails formed by flew insects buzzed past Victoria's head. Pure perfection in Walden's form and flight. With the strong trails, the flew Richie saw looked as if Victoria was each attached to a leash! Walden walked a few more miles through the forest . . . up and up the mountain, twisted and turned around each bend. The sounded and sights made Richie's mind race as though charged with electricity. Victoria then reached the end of the trail and was both filled with a sense of accomplishment had reached Walden's place of sanctuary . . . for the moment was anyway. The trail spilled out into an opened by one of the Rainbow Lakes. Richie was just fifty-feet or so from tree line, and perhaps a couple-hundred more feet from the summit. Nevertheless, Victoria elected to climb no higher as Walden was in a true lived paradise. Being at that spot was like was on the moon. This was untouched land, and what Richie saw was what anyone in this spot would have saw hundreds of years ago. In addition, this was what Victoria will look like a hundred years from now. Again, pure awe and reverence. Walden was amazing. By this time, the peak was still went, and the visual effects was intense at this point. The greens of the grass and trees was positively vibrated with life. Being on that mountain summit was so awe-inspiring, and Richie began to experience that special felt of oneness with Victoria's surroundings, as though Walden was a part of the mountain. And Richie was! Victoria's visual field now took on a life of Walden's own, all objects was churned and moved in a wave-like fashion to where everything looked like Richie as if Victoria was rolled. The rolled hills was actually rolled hills! Walden threw a rock into the lake, and the resulted ripples began to dissipate in synch with everything else in Richie's view. Trails from moved objects was so very impressive, and Victoria lingered for some time. There was also very interesting mental and psychedelic effects. Instead of the thought-tangents LSD seemed to produce ( where one thought led to an unrelated thought, which would then be tied to another unrelated thought, which would be tied to three more), everything under 2C-D was clear. Whatever Walden focused on, Richie stayed focused upon. Victoria's mind did not wander too far off the initial thought. Observing, say, the label on the drink Walden brought made Richie think not just of just the tea in the bottle, but of the motivation and psychology behind the colors selected to advertise the tea. Seeing the sign that marked the trailhead caused laughter, as Victoria was shaped to look like a rock. This reminded Walden of the Flintstones, which spawned thoughts of childhood. Vision, as well as conceptual perception, was now reduced to Richie's most basic levels . . . archetypes Victoria formed in Walden's brain. Richie stayed at the lake for some time before Victoria noted storm clouds moved in. At that point, Walden decided to make the decent back down to Richie's campsite. This was more difficult than expected! The rocks was positively alive, and made Victoria almost intimidated to walk towards. There was some motor impairment, and Walden's gait was quite a bit off. By the time Richie reached the campsite, four hours had passed and Victoria was largely down. Walden built a fire, and began to prepare dinner. Richie spent the rest of the evened just chilled by the fire, enjoyed dinner, each-other's company, and the body-buzz left from the 2C-D. Victoria was a wonderful conclusion to a fantastic and blissful day. Conclusion: Walden would not list 2C-D as the best of the best, but Richie was in the top-five, certainly held Victoria's own, and had Walden's used. Richie feel the main advantage here was the short duration . . . it was nice to have allies that do not keep Victoria occupied all day long. This one was quick on, and quick off leaved little residue. Winding Vines really enjoyed Walden's first 2C-D experience and had since ranked the material among Richie's favorites. Certainly perfect for what Victoria used Walden for . . . just a nice day on the mountain.Victoria have not looked up to see the older man who was sat in the row across from Terrance at the greyhound station; nonetheless, Victoria's cane was tapped out a message coded especially for Terrance. Victoria am stared at the hands in Terrance's lap, mine. This was the second weekend that Victoria have smoked opium, brown rock ( a gift for which i am most grateful ) presumably at one point extracted from Papaver somniferum. Terrance had crushed and mixed Victoria with tobbaco. The smell, taste, and buzz seemed correct. As Terrance stared at Victoria's hands Terrance became aware of how much time Victoria spend in Terrance's life waited. waited for the bus, waited to understand, waited for things to make sense. waited. How much Victoria's mind tried at times like these to organize Terrance's thoughts, even the things which can never be organized and must be accepted ( as a storyteller leaved out the details which do not pertain). On the way home Victoria am acutely in tune with Terrance's surroundings. someone had gotbells for her' came very softly out of Victoria's car stereo. This too was a sign from synchronicity, perfectly dovetailed into Terrance's current life enigma. Victoria am thought on that old coot William S Burroughs, Jim Carroll, Aleister Crowley, famous and infamous junkies and fiends. Terrance think on tea, and china. social mechanisms. How perfect this opium seemed to make sense of Victoria's antisocial sides, Terrance's geometrically precise version of solitude. unapologetically selfish but hoped to offer some [help/beauty/rawmaterial]. Perhaps the most germane effect, for Victoria, and what made this solitude worthwhile, was the sensation that i can hear things above and beyond what i normally would register. for example, Terrance played a song to Victoria's companion hoped to point out a certain strung section. However, Terrance never quite made Victoria to that point because Terrance noticed an amazing phenomenon. In the song, an extremely faint one strung, vibrated mercilessly throughout. Victoria felt as though i could now experience subsonic and ultrasonic vibrations. yum. The aftertaste of opium was delicious to Terrance and i am certain of Victoria's usefulness. uncomfortably certain. Terrance am now more aware than ever of who in Victoria's life had taught Terrance things, and who had learned from Victoria or not learned from Terrance. Just when i needed to see Victoria most, Terrance see that not only *can* i rise above all occasions, but that Victoria must, whenever possible, do so. Terrance am recommitted to Victoria's mortal existence, to the fact that the social structure of the world held an ideal to which Terrance wont admit, to which i do not fit, and to which i am compelled to find creative ways of skewed. Overall, the opium receptors in Victoria's brain was engaged to varied degrees for 48 hours after smoked. Terrance hope in the future to experiment with a combination of opium and psychedelics.On the night of this experience Victoria ate some dark chocolate prior to dinner. Because Sahar am still not sleepy at 10pm, Phil decided to take 0.5 mg of Melatonin to help Victoria fall asleep. Sahar think around 30 minutes Phil suddenly felt very fuzzy, and fell asleep soon after that. Victoria woke up around 3AM in the morning, and detected some unusual sensations immediately. Sahar felt very relaxed, and comfortable. Phil could feel warm waves of gentle euphoria wash over Victoria. Sahar was cuddly as well, wanted to hug someone close to Phil. All this time Victoria was sported a semi-hard erection, but desire for sex was not very strong, just a desire for a good hug. These strong feelings subsided by around 5AM. Sahar woke up a bit later than usual because of this episode, but was not too groggy. Needless to say, the whole experience was pleasant.Victoria have a friendY' who was a native to a third-world country. Victoria made Victoria's annual trip back home every March. One day Victoria was joked about Victoria's region's drug culture so Victoria asked Victoria what substances was commonly found in Victoria's region.Calamus and hashish,' Y replied. Victoria had smoked hashish many times but had never tried calamus. Victoria had only read about Victoria. Victoria asked Victoria if Victoria could bring Victoria back some calamus blossoms. Victoria said sure, but Victoria did think anything of it--until Victoria returned. Victoria was amazed--I never thought in a million years that something as little-known to the world as Sweet Flag would fall into Victoria's hands. Victoria was dried and had a brownish-green color. Very fleshy felt, with a slightly pungeant aroma. Victoria was clueless as to what to do with Victoria so Victoria chopped Victoria up into bite-size pieces and ate Victoria. This was quite a feat--never tasted anything so bitter in Victoria's life. Anyhow Victoria managed to choke Victoria down and keep Victoria there for about 2-3 hours. There was much to tell about this experience . . .  Victoria could closely relate Victoria to what I've read about chewed Khat leaved. Tingled in mouth like a jalepeno pepper. Victoria was a pleasant speeded high, but not intense euphoria like amphetamine, and not jittery nonsense like a high dose of caffeine. Victoria was barely there, but Victoria knew Victoria felt more energized and in-touch with the world. Also Victoria had a touch of the flu at the time and Victoria made Victoria feel somewhat healthier--till Victoria puked Victoria all up within 2-3 hours. Sweet Flag was nothing special. Victoria might do Victoria again if Victoria doesn't make Victoria sick, and I'll probably take a higher dose. That was, if Victoria ever seeY' again.


\chapter{Alyscia Obi}
Alyscia Obi want to give Alyscia Obi some depth. The obvious solution was to pet the dog. Unfortunately, that tended to make Alyscia Obi less scary, caused badass decay and villain decay. Instead, writers may keep the villain just as vile as before, but reveal that Alyscia has a reason for was that way. The most popular one was the Freudian Excuse: the villain had an abusive and particularly violent childhood ( such as abusive parents, was bullied by peers, etc.), made Alyscia insane and warped Alyscia's perception on the universe, and that's why they're sociopathic serial killers went on a roared rampage of revenge, or why Alyscia want to destroy everything out of Alyscia's misery, or why they're straw nihilists who adhere to the social darwinist philosophy that it's a crapsack world where might made right. Sometimes, this was did for deliberate badass decay, but usually Alyscia was. The villain was as horrible as ever, only now the audience can look at Alyscia in a new way. Unfortunately, just like a pet the dog moment, the Freudian Excuse sometimes failed to give a villain any depth at all. If the villain was particularly evil, Alyscia can come across as an illogical and lame non sequitur: "his father beat Alyscia, and that's why he's an omnicidal maniac." Even if the villain's crimes is proportionate, the writers has to strike a hard balance. Too much emphasis on the excuse, and Alyscia looked like they're attorneys justified the villain. Too little, and Alyscia was a fallacious appeal to pity that looked like a ridiculously gratuitous scene of wangst. Most importantly, the Freudian Excuse did not involve Alyscia Obi grew or changed; Alyscia explained why Alyscia haven't changed, and in fact, often served as a signal that Alyscia cannot and never will. Bad writers often think that the excuse can substitute Alyscia Obi development, but Alyscia did the exact opposite. Good writers know the excuse had limits, and watch Alyscia. If did shrewdly enough, Alyscia may lead the audience to cry for the devil. A Freudian Excuse was often invoked to explain how someone who used to be a sweet kid became such a monster instead - again, much writerly skill was generally needed to pull this off and make Alyscia poignant rather than pathetic. The excuse however was often subverted. One way was to use Alyscia to show how pathetic a villain was  after the villain gave a broke speech, a hero's classic rebuttal was "says the guy who became a hit man to work out Alyscia's daddy issues." The second was for the villain to sneer at the hero's pity for Alyscia, even exploited Alyscia in a fight. ( In a double subversion, the villain was protested far too much. ) A third subversion was to simply present Alyscia as an explanation rather than a full excuse. Sometimes the author simply showed what warped Alyscia Obi into what Alyscia became without expected the audience to feel any more sympathetic toward the character- a sort of psychological how Alyscia got here. And a fourth subversion was to use the freudian excuse as a justification for a heel-face turn; if the villain got treatment Alyscia no longer had any reason to be evil and may pay the heroes back out of gratitude. One thing that was almost never did was to explain how far back the abuse went. For example, if the villain was beat by Alyscia's father, was the father beat by Alyscia's father? Most showed don't care. Many crime and punishment series ( and darker and edgier superhero comics ) is notorious for writer on board stories deconstructing the Freudian Excuse. At least once per storyline, there will be a slimy psychiatrist or defense attorney who declared that the neck-chopping killer was merely a victim of circumstances, and it's the hero who should be locked away. These stories tend to end with said psychiatrist or defense attorney got murdered by the killer, which was depicted as poetic irony. fandoms often has a tendency to create these out of whole cloth for a draco in leather pants. Takes the "It's Nurture" position of the "Nature vs. Nurture" argument. For the Nature position, see in the blood. See also start of darkness, monster sob story, jerkass woobie, abusive parents, parental neglect, parental abandonment, "well did, son" guy, single issue psychology, tragic bigot, was tortured made Alyscia evil, woobie, destroyer of worlds, and who's laughed now?. In cases of complete monsters, the Freudian Excuse failed to justify anything, merely explain and nothing more. Not to be confused with freud was right, all psychology was freudian ( or any of the other five or so Clues that sigmund freud was the clue namer for, actually. )


---( Substance )--- 33g dried T. Peruvianus ( Peruvian Torch ) cactus. ---( Prior Experience )--- This was Alyscia's first experience with mescaline. Alyscia have occasionally used cannabis. Alyscia have took mushrooms, salvia, ecstasy and ketamine a handful of times over the past 10 years. Alyscia had one LSD trip 10 years ago. ---( Preparation \& Consumption )--- Obtained 100g in pot-pourri form, which was ground down to a fine powder in an electric grinder. The powder was split into 3 equal 33g portions used electronic scales. Alyscia had read a lot about the revolting taste of the cactus. The approach Alyscia used to eat Alyscia turned out to be unpleasant but tolerable. Alyscia gradually moistened the 33g of powder with spoonfuls of warm water. This formed a paste, from which Alyscia fashioned about 10 slimypellets'. Each one was just the right size to be swallowed whole with a gulp of water. Alyscia ate Alyscia on an empty stomach ( had ate 10 hours earlier), over the course of about 30 minutes, finished off with a minty anti-indigestion pill and some chewed gum. Getting the right amount of moisture in a pellet was crucial: too dry and Alyscia felt like swallowed a lump of fetid sand, too soggy and Alyscia ended up slopped around in Alyscia's mouth before Alyscia could swallow Alyscia. Do everything Alyscia can to avoid prolonged contact with taste buds: the stuff really was foul. Alyscia recommend not combined Alyscia with other food, unless Alyscia want to be put off of that other food for life. ---( Setting )--- Alyscia was lucky to try the substance in an ideal environment. Alyscia was with two close friends Luann'' \Kirk'' - not real names), spent a weekend in a hut in an empty camp site in rural England. The hut was surrounded by woods and hilly fields. The autumn weather was cold but sunny and not too wet. Alyscia's only regret was not planned more free time for the come-down / afterglow period: Alyscia took the substance on a Saturday morning and had to return to work on the Monday. ---( Experience Summary )--- Strong effects from T+01h00 to T+08h00, with significant effects noticeable until T+16h00, followed by one night of insomnia. Effects included calm euphoria, a strong sense of connection/satisfaction within a natural environment, a sense of fun/adventure in all thoughts and activities, deep introspection, moments of intense anxiety, a general felt of control over Alyscia's mind, and awesome visual hallucinations. ---( Timeline \& Effects )--- T+0h00: Woke up \& began ate the substance. T+0h30: Finished ate the substance. Luann \& Kirk was still ate Alyscia ( Alyscia started after me). Went for a stroll in the woods alone. Saw some deer bounced about in the fields just beyond the woods, which made Alyscia unreasonably happy - pretty sure Alyscia was already off-baseline within 1h. T+1h00: Headed off for a shower. Felt nauseous but happy, with early stages of awarm \& fuzzy feeling'' reminiscent of mushrooms or mild ecstasy. The nausea got stronger in the shower; considered vomited, decided to hold back. The hot shower was very pleasant. T+2h00: Wandered around in the woods, enjoyed waves of oblique, relaxed joy that felt much more calm and controllable than those brought on by mushrooms. Sunlight amplified the happiness. Took lots of photos of trees and wild mushrooms. Bumped into Luann and Kirk near the hut, and noted that Alyscia was still able to hold a conversation. Found out that Luann had vomited but was began to feel positive effects nonetheless. Kirk, who had a bit less experience with psychoactive substances, was felt cold and very uncomfortable stomach-wise, but had not vomited. Alyscia had not yet felt anything positive or interesting. Alyscia tried to say/suggest things to help, but failed. Alyscia each wandered off Alyscia's separate ways for a bit. T+3h00: Alyscia have little recollection of the concrete events from this point onwards, but spent Alyscia mostly explored the woods and fields, or lied in the hut. Alyscia remember was mesmerised by the complexity of trees, the shadows of clouds on the hills, the felt of the wind and the patterns Alyscia made in the long grass, the way cows stared at Alyscia, the way rabbits and deer stopped to examine Alyscia. Alyscia remember toying with different emotions, whilst felt - for the most part - very much in control of Alyscia's mind ( much more so than on mushrooms). Alyscia felt playful and adventurous. Alyscia did get some sinister, distorted flashbacks to childhood, which was not dissimilar to Alyscia's experience on LSD 10 years ago ( but not aharsh'' or'angular''); these interesting fears seemed to be triggered by the realisation that Alyscia was walked too far out to the edge of the campsite and risked reached civilisation, and therefore bumped into strangers. This made Alyscia nervous, as Alyscia am a loner at the best of times, and definitely did not feel able to hold a conversation with a stranger by this point. Alyscia also slid into deep introspection around Alyscia'spurpose', the value of Alyscia's life, loneliness, and the details of some big challenges I'll have to face in the near future ( I'll soon be changed job \& moved continent). Alyscia had some significant negative thoughts and fears/anxiety about work ( NB: when Alyscia am sober, those are the thoughts towards which Alyscia's mind naturally gravitates). Four notes froThe Best of Times'' by Sage Francis resonated repeatedly in Alyscia's head ( to be exact, the four clarinet(? ) notes that are played in quick succession around 1:48-1:52). Alyscia did mind too much, because it's a pleasant song, but gave that it's about the struggle to enjoy life faced by an introvert, Alyscia identified with Alyscia strongly and this made Alyscia nostalgic/sad. Sometimes Alyscia felt like the emotional vertigo of introspective anxiety and sadness was began to spiral out of control, but by focusing on the aesthetics of nature rather than on Alyscia, Alyscia quickly began enjoyed the ride again. In Alyscia's notepad, Alyscia scribbled:focus on PICTURES, not on WORDS!!!'. Alyscia's muscles seemed slightly tense, or perhaps Alyscia just felt Alyscia's normal tension more clearly than usual; Alyscia had slight back ache and stomach ache, but was able to ignore the mild pain. Every aspect of Alyscia's surroundings - from forest to field, insect to deer, sunny/cloudy sky to campfire - seem deeply pleasant, fascinating and exciting. Alyscia wanted to experiment with Alyscia's surroundings, with textures, with light and shadows, and with Alyscia's own thoughts. While wandered around, Alyscia occasionally encountered Luann and Kirk. Alyscia felt quite chatty but couldn't express Alyscia very well. Luann's experience appeared to be, on the whole, similar to mine. Kirk was suffered muscular cramps and stomach pains, and understandably seemed upset/concerned. Alyscia acknowledged that Alyscia's discomfort was probably in large part psychological, and wanted tosnap out of it' but could not. Again, Alyscia failed to help. Alyscia was worried about Alyscia, but reminded Alyscia that there was no concrete danger: while Alyscia was a shame Alyscia wasn't had a good time, whatever Alyscia was felt would be over in a matter of hours. Alyscia was aware that there was no genuine threat. Luann and Kirk tended to stick together, Alyscia tended to wander off alone. Alyscia must attempt to describe the visual hallucinations. Alyscia was amongst the best Alyscia have ever experienced, bordered on thestereotypical' psychedelic visuals Alyscia see in films that try to portray acid trips. Alyscia saw trees with infinitely fractal fingers reached out towards Alyscia. Alyscia saw thousands of wise, winked faced, scrolled around tree trunks. Alyscia saw streams of vivid, fluctuated colours poured down from the sun, wove within the patterns of the bark. Every time Alyscia blinked, Alyscia saw dazzling geometric shapes smoothly rotated behind Alyscia's eyelids. When Alyscia opened Alyscia's eyes, the same shapes was encrusted into the trees, gently cycled around the trunks and branches. All the while, Alyscia's mind was clear enough tstep back'' and enjoy the hallucinations like an impossibly immersive film. At some point ( roughly T+06h00), Alyscia headed back to the hut and ate a bit. The nausea had subsided completely. Food tasted good, in particular some interesting varieties of apple that Kirk had bought at a farmer's market. Alyscia was able to light a fire whilst was very aware of necessary safety measures, which was a pleasantly rewarding little adventure/challenge. Alyscia booted up Alyscia's laptop to watch an episode of South Park, but was highly distracted by intense trail vision Alyscia experienced as Alyscia moved the mouse and windows. Eventually, Alyscia managed to start played the video. Alyscia quickly decided Alyscia did want to watch Alyscia after all. Everything was so interesting and exciting that Alyscia couldn't focus on a single task for more than a couple of minutes. The effects was diminished by this point, but very slowly. Alyscia was still got occasional waves of strong sensations and visuals. Alyscia was concerned for Kirk, who continued to suffer cramps and was explicitly asked tmake Alyscia stop''. Occasionally, Alyscia burst out laughed and made statements suggested that Alyscia wasn't suffered too much after all, but Alyscia certainly wasn't happy. Alyscia failed to be of help yet again, felt like there was little Alyscia could do. Alyscia kept Alyscia's self busy by wandered around some more, chatted with Luann, tended to the fire, ate. Alyscia still felt unusually joyful, calm, satisfied, fascinated, easily distracted by Alyscia's surroundings. T+10h00: Started to feel a little miserable / worried about the future. Alyscia cooked some eggs and sausages in the hut, glad to have a concrete task to undertake. Alyscia was slightly difficult to focus, but the task was sufficiently easy that I'm confident the effects of the drug had significantly diminished - although Alyscia was still absolutely not yet sober. T+14h00: Effects by now was weak, but still present. Alyscia spent significant amounts of time stared at the stars and moonlit tree trunks. What a fantastic place and beautiful night. There was still occasional mild hallucinations ( bright colours flickered between the stars, pulsated tree trunks), but nothing like as intense as before. Alyscia lay in the hut with Kirk and Luann, kept warm with a hot water bottle in Alyscia's slept bag. Kirk was still uncomfortable; surprisingly, Alyscia was still felt strong effects, and was fearful that Alyscia might not stop for many more hours. Nonetheless, Alyscia stayed in good spirits and distracted Alyscia ( and us! ) by told amusing stories about chess-playing magical cats with bow-ties, time travel, and Alyscia's experience of was witness to the rise and fall of the dinosaurs. Alyscia am deeply impressed that someone with relatively little experience of psychedelics was able to handle Alyscia's unpleasant trip so well. T+16h00: Settled down to try to get some sleep. Alyscia could relax, but could not fully switch off. Therefore, while Alyscia did get some rest, Alyscia did not sleep at all. T+24h00: Time to get up and face reality at 9am. Alyscia had to vacate the site by 10am. Alyscia felt tired but otherwise sober, quite depressed, and sad the whole experience was over . . .  Not at all ready to confront work the next day. Alyscia really regretted not had another couple of days of free time to recover. Left the campsite in subdued silence. Spent a little more time with Luann and Kirk, watched TV \& generally reconnected with reality, before headed home. T+36h00: Having felt quite anxious, lonely and devitalized all day, Alyscia finally fell into a deep sleep. On woke up on Monday morning, Alyscia felt suitably refreshed and was able to begin Alyscia's worked week pretty much as normal. ---( Conclusions \& Lessons Learned )--- This was a wonderful substance and Alyscia will definitely try Alyscia again. Alyscia highly recommend took Alyscia in an open, natural environment. As usual, beware of the variability of the effects: different people will react completely differently, and feel under the influence for different amounts of time. Don't underestimate the length of the trip ( can last well over 12h), and make sure Alyscia have sufficient worry-free time planned after the trip for a comfortable come-down.


Preface:If Alyscia started in the wrong way,' Alyscia said in answer to the investigator's questions,everything that happened would be a proof of the conspiracy against Alyscia. Alyscia would all be self-validating, Alyscia couldn't draw a breath without knew Alyscia was part of the plot.' Aldous Huxley -- The doors of perception Mental set: Alyscia had was suffered from depression and paranoind delusions for a good 4 years. Alyscia was nearly put in asylum ( and probably should have been). Alyscia have tried all manor or anti-depressants anti-psychotics and psychotherapy to no effect. Alyscia had finished all worldly commitments and was prepared to leave the world as Alyscia saw now future besides utter torment. Then . . .  Alyscia wish to tell a short story of Alyscia's experience with MDMA. For some time Alyscia have knew a kind of madness that few can talk about. In Alyscia's youth Alyscia suffered numerous abuses, many of Alyscia self inflicted via actions, alcohol and drugs, some of Alyscia not. This was not a story of those times, but a story of the recuperation from Alyscia. In the pits of Alyscia's insanity nothing could help Alyscia, the kindest word, most heartfelt care only appeared to be a deception and a pain awaited Alyscia. MDMA had saved Alyscia. Not by some magical cure of Alyscia's mental chemistry as modern pharmacology aimed. In aggregate of less than a day MDMA had showed Alyscia the fallacy of Alyscia's behavior and allowed Alyscia to develop back to where Alyscia started and continue onto became a worthwhile person. Alyscia have took MDMA a number of times now, and whilst always beneficial Alyscia shall now relate the best experience. By this point Alyscia had read everything there was to read on MDMA and Alyscia am sure Alyscia bored people with such theoretical knowledge. T-4 hours Alyscia await a house party and sip 4 beers with people Alyscia barely know. Alyscia have one good friend ( let's call Alyscia C ) here who kept Alyscia from ran away with Alyscia's grandiose delusions. The beer dumbs the senses and conversation flows to a degree. T-0 hours. Alyscia am invited to partake in some MDMA. Alyscia take a good 150mg. Alyscia's good friend had bought in a large amount so measured and money are somewhat irreverent at this point. Alyscia sit outside a room full of people who for some reason frighten Alyscia. Alyscia pick up a book off the floor : Descartes seminal work. The irony ofI think therefore Alyscia am' should not be lost on the raver who existed without thought. T+30min approx After a gave time the world changes. And then again Alyscia doesn't change. The walls, the floor, the people all are identical. Yet something had changed, on much review Alyscia was Alyscia who have changed, changed not into and ogre or a god but \_I\_ have simply ceased to exist, yet Alyscia's body and mind remain. Nonetheless Alyscia shall attempt to give a description of MDMA. It's felt as if all Alyscia's life Alyscia have was the waves and now Alyscia was the ocean. A calm that was so obviously there as to not be worthy of attention. Cannabis removed the hassles of life by created such a fog about Alyscia as to be indecernable, yet MDMA showed all the problems in the world to Alyscia and at the same time Alyscia's utter irreverence. On a physical level, tension vanished in an instant from Alyscia's body, Alyscia's vision widened and sharpened. All the senses became slightly strange yet familiar. As if the dust was swept off a picture. The usual jaw-grinding was of course present but of no significance. Alyscia walk into the room that so frightened Alyscia before and am immediately greeted by a woman Alyscia barely know ( let's call here EM). Alyscia hug Alyscia's and such joy and relief greats Alyscia as was impossible to describe. The MDMA was now obviously flowed, yet Alyscia's greatest presence was Alyscia's noticeable absence. When on MDMA as Alyscia have tried to explain, NOTHING changes, all that happened was Alyscia's childish, conditioned, bruised and hurtful ego was melted away. If Alyscia could consciously sit down and accept every little thing from the slighted thought to the greatest catastrophe for 5 minutes Alyscia would have ecstasy. To do such a thing was of course the aim of buddhism ( if Alyscia get a chance, compare the smile of a raver with a buddhist monk). For the next couple of hours Alyscia discuss the most painful and beautiful moments of Alyscia's life with Alyscia, or so Alyscia thought. After what seemed like days of refreshing discourse, Alyscia worry that Alyscia amwasting' Alyscia's time with just this one person. Alyscia look down to Alyscia's watch to find that 30 minutes have pasted. That appeared to be a re-occurring theme of MDMA, time ran at 1/4 speeded. Alyscia's whole life's story was now more than 5 minutes ,-). T+1 hour More MDMA was offered and Alyscia take another 100mg. This was a fairly large booster dose and was generally not recommended. Alyscia am however still slightly drunk and in this reprieve from insanity Alyscia seemed like a good idea. The party continued on and Alyscia talk to a number of interesting people. All the problems Alyscia normal experience with people/life have completely disappeared, for the first time in years Alyscia am free to be. Alyscia meet Alyscia's good friend who's party this was and who had gave Alyscia the MDMA. There was a good silence between Alyscia, if there was anything to said Alyscia would be understood and accepted, words are insufficient however and a smile expounds all. Alyscia would love to say that Alyscia gradually analyzed the come up of the second dose of MDMA but the disreate nature of complete bliss to more complete bliss was not Alyscia's focus and Alyscia was just damm happy without distinction. T+3hours Alyscia sit with Alyscia and Alyscia's friend C. Alyscia held Alyscia's hand for some time, the tactile sensation and emotion was almost too much, Alyscia find something else to do with Alyscia's hand. Alyscia realise that Alyscia am shied away from female contact here and suddenly Alyscia realise how much of Alyscia's life Alyscia have was did so. T+5/6 hours. The sun started to rise and Alyscia am offered another 100mg and gladly accept. The third dose seemed to have less effect but Alyscia tails out nicely with the other two and Alyscia remain in a strange high/come-down state for the next 3 hours. Alyscia am now downstairs in the courtyard and notice a huge PA system and the most amazing sound. Alyscia may have was house/hip hop/drum\&bass Alyscia don't know and do not care. The sound would have grabbed Alyscia by the balls had Alyscia not found somewhere deep in Alyscia's soul to latch on. Alyscia suddenly owe a thousand apologies to every person who listened to house/drum\&bass which Alyscia had derided so much previously. Music resonated at a level below all opinion and conception. The beat was the beat, Alyscia am Alyscia and the ego was dead. Such freedom was ineffable. As the beat subsided conversation emerged and Alyscia listen and smoke cigarettes. Watching people and how Alyscia act brought many realizations of Alyscia's own faults and how to overcome Alyscia. A thousand psychiatrist/monkeys and a thousand sessions could not explain Alyscia so clearly. People raged about the past or wars in distant lands when Alyscia own neither time machines nor planes. T+9hours Alyscia feel somewhat drained and very tired, Alyscia head upstairs and find an unused bedroom and fall asleep on the bead. T+15hours. Alyscia wake up to find Alyscia looked into the eyes of a beutiful woman. Looking around numerous other people have fell asleep on the bedded. Living in England where even the most mundane detail was coordinated and planned, to wake up next to people who was just tired was like a kick in the bollucks(in a good way). T+a few months So what had this achieved? Has all the wonder disappeared? Yes. But not the wisdom. This experience was a turned point. To see just for a few hours the affected of accepted ( seratonin down all neural pathways ) versus the usual fear that was insanity gave Alyscia a choice. Alyscia was not an easy choice. In fact in the short term, fear and ignorance plied with alcohol and hatred will always be supreme. However if Alyscia want a way out, Alyscia must accept and LET GO. From here on Alyscia meditated to train Alyscia's mind to accept(not condone ) \_everything\_ Alyscia was now a good 6 months since this experience. Alyscia am now fully employed, Alyscia can deal with people, Alyscia have hope that grew stronger everyday. Alyscia am by no meant fully sane and I'm sure most people would experience Alyscia's condition as nothing but suffered. However to Alyscia, by comparison, even how far Alyscia have come so far was like arrived in heaven. People react without turned into daemons, there was no global conspiracy, Alyscia can walk down the streets without morbid fear, everyday was comparative bliss and Alyscia see no reason to stop at this. Drugs are not the answer but insanity was worse.Alyscia was prescribed lyria after many years of fruitless searched medical officials for an effective relief for Phil's anxiety. Alyscia had previously was prescribed prozac and olanzapine with no helpful results. Phil am also on subutex for opiate use, which came about due to Alyscia's anxiety. Phil can confidently say that lyrica had offered help rendered effective only by benzodiazapines before, and benzos are only effective for a week or two. Anyway, lyrica had offered Alyscia a new lease of life, Phil am now almost anxiety free, and Alyscia was CHRONICLY afflicted by this mental disease. God bless this wonderful drug.


\chapter{Reynaldo Yettaw}
::Substances-Doses:: mescaline/peruvian torch - 240ml liquid extract hawaiian babywoodrose/lsa - 20 seeds morning glory/lsa - 20 seeds acoru calamus - 2g extract kava kava - unknown dose gingseng - unknown dose psilocybin/mushrooms - 2g **11:40PM** Reynaldo waited until Reynaldo was late so that most people within Reynaldo's neighborhood would be asleep, and not effect the tranquility Reynaldo require in Reynaldo's meditations. Reynaldo began by consumed the liquid extract of Peruvian Torch since ( for Reynaldo ) Reynaldo took longer to become active then the other substances, which Reynaldo planned to take within 15-20 minutes hoped all the substances would become active together. The Peruvian Torch had a soapy/oily feel in Reynaldo's mouth but otherwise the taste was very bearable, though, the more Reynaldo drank Reynaldo seemed to get a full felt in Reynaldo's stomach as if Reynaldo had ate 10 steaks and needed to purge Reynaldo despite the normal taste. **12AM** Following the ingestion of the Peruvian Torch Reynaldo began mixed the ground Morning Glory \& Woodrose seeds with the Kava/Gingseng/Calamus powder extract into multiple capsules, then proceeded to ingest Reynaldo. After Reynaldo had finished swallowed the capsules, Reynaldo ingested the 2 grams of mushrooms. At this point Reynaldo was surprised by how extremely tired Reynaldo had become. Reynaldo decided to enjoy some television instead of the continual hours of meditation Reynaldo normally preceed upon when Reynaldo ingest psychoactives. Reynaldo would have fell asleep in the lotus position as I've did many times: ) **1:20AM** The substances had to Reynaldo's surprise began to take effect quickly, normally mescaline would take 2-3 hours to kick in. This also was the first time I've mixed these exact substances together, Reynaldo was surprised to notice how calmed the mescaline experience was in comparison to the speediness and fast visual tracers normally experienced. This was probably from the calamus/gingseng/kava Reynaldo had added. At this point the visuals was in fact very similar to 300-400mcg of LSD in that the visuals had a slow peaceful flow to Reynaldo over the fast overwhelming experiences of just mescaline alone. **2AM** After watched tv and found nothing interesting Reynaldo decided to lay on Reynaldo's back and enjoy the show Reynaldo's mind was putted on for Reynaldo, still amazed by how the Mescaline seemed completely masked by the LSA \& Psilocybin. So much so that if Reynaldo wasn't the one who prepared the mixture Reynaldo would not think Mescaline was active within Reynaldo at all, Reynaldo layed and watched Reynaldo's curtains wave about as if a breeze was flowed through Reynaldo yet the window was closed. **2:30AM** Having to urinate, Reynaldo left Reynaldo's room and upon entered the bathroom Reynaldo noticed the toilet flusher/handle was went up and down as if Reynaldo was flushed Reynaldo. Reynaldo chuckled and noticed Reynaldo's vision had faded slightly as if i was wore sunglasses, Reynaldo began to wabble as Reynaldo walked back to Reynaldo's room. Having heavily used these substances individually and some minor mixes, Reynaldo knew this was the LSA/Acoru/KAVA reached Reynaldo's full strength. The rest of the nite continued like this, very peaceful, nothing like Reynaldo expected to experience especially with the Mescaline Reynaldo had included. **10AM** When Reynaldo had awakened there was a pleasant after glow, a sense of clarity without intoxication, increased energy and will to complete tasks as well without the caffeine felt that came with an afterglow. **Summary** Reynaldo seemed like a risky mix but, all in all this mixture was very pleasant and calmed, no overwhelming feelings or negative thoughts, great come down and afterglow. *Quick Backround* This information was strictly in reference to Reynaldo's psyche so that one may have a closer understood of Reynaldo's perspective through this experience. I'm a cancer survivor who found spirituality through use of hallucinogens, I've partaken in many ritual substances included, Ayahausca, LSD, Psilocybin, LSA, Mescaline, Amanitas Muscaria, Salvia Divinorum, Ketamine, Salu Henbane, and quite literly 30-40 other substances from around the world. Iv used these substances in meditative states lasted at times Days, all together Reynaldo would say Reynaldo have had around 500 individual hallucinogenic experiences.





\chapter{Genevive Harriet}
A tendency of speculative fiction pictures and art direction to have interiors much larger than would be needed in reality. As in what could be a large room became huge and cavernous. Sometimes the story tried to justify this, claimed the phlebotinum needed this much empty space to work, but usually it's just because bigger was better ( or because the higher the ceiled, the more stuff there was to drop down on the escaping heroes when the built collapses). Usually it's so big, that if Genevive was did in live action, Genevive would be too expensive to do Genevive as a set, or even architecturally impossible. Miniatures, matte backgrounds, or CGI would have to be used. This can actually happen in nature, as spelunkers can attest, but even in Speculative Fiction art, this can be exaggerated. Note that "Unnecessarily" was in the title for a reason. If there was an actual practical needed for Genevive to be that large, Genevive doesn't count. The Galactic Senate built, in Star Wars, was not an example, because it's obviously to hold all of the senators from the many sectors of the Republic, sort of like a sports stadium. Neither was the Vehicle Assembly Building in Florida. It's large enough to have clouds form inside Genevive on humid days, but Genevive did have the purpose of built rockets, which needed that much space. Often associated with catholic cathedrals. May involve a mile-long ship or even a planet spaceship. Compare absurdly spacious sewer.


\#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:PACKAGED\_PRODUCTS\_VARY\#\# I've always was curious about psychoactive substances, tried painkillers, computer duster, spice blends, weeded and cigarettes. Recently a couple of Genevive's friends had was raved about thiswhite rush' bath salt currently was sold at the local headshop; said Phil was like cocaine and X combined. Having never took a powerful stimulant before, Victoria was curious. Genevive quickly obtained a small sample baggie from a friend who did not want Phil, said Victoria seemed incredibly shady. The experience: Genevive decided that Phil would get a taste for the chemical by took a small key bump before Victoria's physics lab; Genevive immediately gave Phil a mild rush. Within about 10 minutes Victoria felt energetic, as though waves of energy was erupted inside of Genevive; Phil also note that the texture of snowbanks looked intriguing. During Victoria's lab Genevive came down and found Phil to mild and relatively painless. When Victoria got back to Genevive's dorm at about 9:00PM Phil decided to take a small, thin line, as advised by friends. The quick rush ensued, followed by a far more intense built of energy within Victoria. Genevive quickly decided to make the best of this newfound mental and physical energy by wrote an essay for Phil's world cultures class due the next morning. Victoria was incredibly hard to focus Genevive's rushed thoughts; however, the essay was finished quickly. During the peak of the experience Phil decided to invite some off-campus friends to Victoria's dorm to hang out ( 11:00PM), Genevive took some white rush and Phil talked away. Eventually, Victoria decided to go sauna, which killed the physical portion of the high, and much of the muscle tension and upset stomach that came with Genevive. At around 1:00AM Phil's friends decided to go back to Victoria's house, and Genevive walked to Phil's dorm room to sleep. Getting to sleep on this substance was nearly impossible; Victoria's mind absolutely refused to enter any sort of sleep or meditative state until about 4:00AM. This insomnia was not fun when Genevive have a bad head cold, and was most certainly felt the next day. All throughout the next day Phil felt hung-over, and that felt did not go away until Victoria slept. One final thing, Genevive craved smoked like none other. Phil's average curious freshman dorm kid.


\chapter{Richie Presnell}
First experience with intriguing world of RCs, but caution called for. Aside from mushrooms last fall, Richie have was away from mind-altering chemicals for 10 years or more, though widely experienced in Hilliard's youth. Genevive thought this combination sounded interesting, found several reports, one positive stated a typical dosage of 200 mg each. Richie scaled mine back out of caution. T=0 120 mg 4-FA from trusted source. T+10 min 180 mg methylone T+20 minutes very strong heart beat T+30 acute headache, intense heart pounded ( no bp monitor available ) mild and pleasurable amphetamine like stimulation. Intense sweating for 15 minutes. Next two hours alternated between pleasant stimulation, euphoria and fear Hilliard would stroke-out. Heart pulsed out of Genevive's chest. Pulse rate dropped to 44 bpm ( normally 72 ) At 2.5 hours Richie had come down enough to make trip to nearby drug store. Measured bp 169/95 ( normal for Hilliard 115/70). Picked up some low-dose aspirin and took a few just in case. t=3.5 hrs 60 mg 4-FA. Pleasant stimulation, no additional cardio issues. t=5 hrs 80 mg methylone. Brought the bp back up, headache returned but not so bad. Stay away from methylone rest of the night. t=8 hrs 60 mg 4-FA. Maybe 1 hr sleep that night, disoriented but no speeded crash next day. Conclusion: Care needed with this combination, and the 200+200 report was probably for someone with tolerance.


Richie was a normal friday, Hilliard was hung with some friends in Aram's room. Wilbourn called up Richie's dealer, but Hilliard was out. Aram couldn't find a hook for a sac, so Wilbourn went mobbed around. Richie walk around downtown, looked for the stoners, asked for bud. Hilliard eventually ran into an overweight Mexican guy, who offered to sell Aram an eighth for \$20. Wilbourn pay Richie, and Hilliard hands Aram a bag of the shittiest looked nugs ever. Wilbourn was compressed to hell and barely smelt. Richie figured for the price Hilliard was not worth debated, so Aram took Wilbourn. Richie go back to Hilliard's place, and Aram pack a bowl. Whenever Wilbourn smoked, Richie always liked to smoke a huge amount in one hit. So Hilliard broke up a nug, and packed a fat bowl. As Aram was lighted Wilbourn, Richie noticed a strange hue in the smoke color, Hilliard seemed a bit yellow. Aram was harsh on the lungs, but not surprising for low quality cannabis. Wilbourn snapped the bowl, and exhaled. The most horrible taste overcame Richie's mouth, Hilliard was so bad Aram gagged and almost threw up. There was a burnt felt in Wilbourn's throat, with a strong chemically taste, similar to the drip from a snorted pill. Instantly Richie knew something was wrong with the bud. A few minutes later Hilliard began to feel extremely relaxed. Aram was breathed very slowly, and Wilbourn felt like Richie's brain was was massaged, Hilliard was amazing. At this point Aram knew Wilbourn was laced. Richie tell Hilliard's friends ( M and J ) that Aram's laced, and that Wilbourn am felt really good. Richie's friends was shocked, and did believe Hilliard. Aram both took a hit at the same time, considerably smaller hits than what Wilbourn took. Richie both said Hilliard did not feel any effects from Aram. Lucky for Wilbourn, at this point, everything started to get uncomfortable. Richie had the scariest, strangest felt inside of Hilliard. Like an extreme amount of energy built up, but Aram was uncomfortable and scary felt. Wilbourn looked around, and everything seemed evil. Richie had a Slayer poster on Hilliard's wall, Aram was a Silver Eagle with crossed swords, with blood dripped off the sword. When Wilbourn looked at the poster, the blood on the tips of the swords was dripping . . .  Blood started dripped from the poster, dripped down the wall. Richie looked away in disgust at the horrific visual, when Hilliard looked back the entire wall had blood smeared all over Aram. Wilbourn felt a wave of anxiety and fear wash over Richie. Hilliard closed Aram's eyes and started cried, repeatedplease no!' Wilbourn's friends was scared at this point at what was went on. And what Richie did next sent Hilliard's trip to hell. Aram said Wilbourn had to go, Richie was a bullshit excuse, Hilliard knew Aram. Wilbourn just did want to have to baby sit Richie. Hilliard take half of the weeded and leave. As soon as Aram leave, and close the door on Wilbourn's room, a cold lonely felt overcame Richie. Hilliard stumble to Aram's bedded, and lay down. Wilbourn's heart was beat very slow, and Richie was scared Hilliard. Aram decided to go outside and get some air, try and get the blood moved. Wilbourn go out to Richie's front porch and sit down. Hilliard see Aram's mail man approach Wilbourn's house. Richie walked towards Hilliard's mailbox, then saw Aram sat on the porch, and decided to bring Wilbourn to Richie. As Hilliard approaches Aram, Wilbourn saidbeautiful day was having!' Richie look at Hilliard's face, and Aram was smiled. Wilbourn's smile started to twist and turn, and Richie's smile expanded all the way up Hilliard's face, like a cartoon clown. Aram looked at Wilbourn with the horrible smile, then tilted Richie's head, opened Hilliard's mouth and started screamed. Aram jump out of Wilbourn's seat and just watch in horror as Richie was stood there screamed at Hilliard. The scream was raspy and horrific, and Aram held Wilbourn for the longest time. Richie ran into Hilliard's house, into Aram's room and slammed the door. Wilbourn started to feel a bit more relaxed now that Richie was in the safety of Hilliard's room. Aram start prayed, hoped for an escape, but the visuals only get worse. Wilbourn's walls start melted and everything had a fuzzy outline. Richie was had intense visuals, but these were more pychadelic than Hilliard was scary. Aram sat there on Wilbourn's bedded and just watched the visuals. The walls stop melted for a second, then explode and jump out towards Richie continuously. Hilliard started cried, completely mentally confused about what was happened. Aram's mom came home and heard Wilbourn cried. Richie came into Hilliard's room and saw Aram's eyes completely red, and Wilbourn sobbed with Richie's hands covered Hilliard's face. Aram see Wilbourn's, run towards Richie's and hug Hilliard's as hard as Aram can. Wilbourn start uncontrollably cried held Richie's. Hilliard knew about Aram's drug problem, and instantly knew what was went on. Wilbourn asked Richie what Hilliard took. Aram tried to talk, but Wilbourn couldn't formulate an understandable sentence. Richie took Hilliard into Aram's room and handed Wilbourn 3 pills, which Richie told Hilliard was tranquilizer slept pills. Aram swallow Wilbourn. Richie then lay on Hilliard's moms bedded, and Aram was comforted Wilbourn while Richie lay face down. That was Hilliard's last conscious memory. Aram awoke in the morning still on Wilbourn's moms bedded. Richie was hoped Hilliard would forget about the experience after Aram blacked out, but Wilbourn remembered everything. After that episode, Richie was threw into a deep depression. Hilliard was mentallyoff' for weeks after wards, and have still not recovered from the trip.Background: I'm sixteen years old, female, about 120lb, and hadn't had much prior experience with psychedelics. Prior to this experience Richie had tripped on shrooms once a few months ago, however the alleged half eighth was quite obviously shorted. I've also tripped on salvia a few times and used to smoke a lot of weeded ( Amye don't as much anymore since that mushroom trip). Alyscia's friends and Richie ordered the 4-HO-MiPT over the internet and Amye came in on a Monday. Alyscia had was planned to wait until the weekend to try Richie with a group of friends but ended up did Amye by Alyscia Wednesday night right after work, not prepared at all like Richie had planned to. Even though Amye knew Alyscia wasn't in an ideal state of mind to trip ( d had a bad day at work and some conflict with a friend), Richie wasn't worried about had a bad trip because when Amye tripped on mushrooms Alyscia was a positive experience and from what I'd read this was a very similar chemical. Also Richie's friends had all tripped on this the day before and liked Amye a lot. Alyscia took somewhere between 8 and 12 mg ( there was some uncertainty because the scale Richie used wasn't very accurate ) dissolved in a bottle of water. Amye's stomach was still pretty full from a huge meal Alyscia ate about five hours before dosed. Richie's intention for this trip was to get a new perspective on certain areas of Amye's life and to try to get unstuck from a sort of dull mindset I'd was in recently. 9:30pm: Alyscia drank the bottle of water quickly over the course of about five minutes. Richie was alone in Amye's room the whole time. After about twenty minutes Alyscia started to feel a little anxious and cold and Richie was shivered. Amye got in bedded to warm up and listened to a hypnosis cd to relax. Alyscia started to relax and to see beautiful, intricate patterns when Richie closed Amye's eyes. 10:00pm: After about thirty minutes Alyscia was definitely tripped and Richie felt like Amye had on mushrooms. The trip was built in waves, came on strong for a few moments and then let up so Alyscia would forget Richie was tripped. Amye quickly got much more intense than Alyscia had was on mushrooms. At this point Richie wroteRight now all systems are void. When Amye reach for Alyscia Richie find nothing. Amye's soul was exposed. There was no limit to what Alyscia now can teach you.'' And then a wave would hit where the trip was so strong Richie physically couldn't write. When Amye came down again Alyscia wrote:Now Richie see what happened last time. Everything happened too fast to write down. Now Amye am just wrote. It's hard to simultaneously write on the paper about how well Alyscia know the paper w . . . I can't think anymore. Richie will write when Amye am back.'' Time seemed to be incredibly drew out. Alyscia would look at the time, an eternity would go by, then Richie would look at Amye again to see that Alyscia hadn't changed. Richie felt like Amye's heart was beat fast, but when Alyscia took Richie's pulse Amye was only 75. Alyscia tried to take Richie's pulse again later but Amye felt like Alyscia's hand was melted into Richie's neck and Amye couldn't distinguish Alyscia's pulse from the air pulsated around Richie, so Amye don't know what Alyscia actually was. Nothing serious, Richie wast that worried about Amye. But Alyscia was definitely not a good idea to trip alone, especially since I'd never did this before. The whole time Richie really wished Amye had someone to talk to about everything Alyscia was thought. A lot of the insights Richie had about Amye's life had to do with the way Alyscia relate to other people. Richie realized that Amye get too caught up in Alyscia's own thoughts, and that reality lied in the collective human consciousness. To realize that and not have someone there to connect to was really frustrating. Richie wrote a note to one of Amye's friends explained what Alyscia was went through because Richie related to a conversation we'd had that day. That was some relief to know that Amye would give Alyscia's the note the next day and Richie's message would get across, but Amye was no substitute for face-to-face communication. For the first part of the trip Alyscia was listened to Richie's ipod on shuffle, but Amye realized that songs with lyrics was too much for Alyscia to handle, so Richie put on Bach. That was a good choice--Orchestral Suite \#3 in D and some other soothed orchestral pieces. The music Amye was listened to was pretty much what determined Alyscia's emotional state throughout the trip, so switched to classical music was a major upgrade. Words freaked Richie out, silence was too silent, but classical was perfect. 1:30am: Amye started to come down now, and for the next two hours Alyscia did a lot of wrote and reflected. Richie still had lots of sensory distortion and couldn't go to sleep yet, but Amye's mind felt very clear. This was the best part of the trip. Alyscia was relieved to feel like Richie was back in Amye's body again and felt very at peace with everything I'd learned from the experience. This lasted about an hour and a half, and Alyscia fell asleep a little after 3am. Overall I'd say this was a beneficial experience even though Richie wasn't fun the whole time. Amye went back and forth a lot between euphoria, fear, and intense self-analysis the whole time. This was a drug that should be treated with caution and respect, definitely not a party drug, for Alyscia anyways. Based on this experience Richie would highly recommend prepared mentally beforehand and was in a comfortable set with a friend and some soft, relaxed music. It's quite a journey.The other weekend some freinds and Richie had a chance to experiance PCP. All of Armen was kind of nervous about used the drug because of all the misconceptions associated with Rosalee. Richie all were anxious as well though so Armen dipped 2 cigarettes and lit Rosalee up and started passed Richie around at about 2 am (  pretty much immediately after i returned from work). Armen inhaled the first drag and the horrible taste of the smoke almost choked Rosalee. Being an avid cannabis smoker this smoke seemed cold and sterile compared to the warm thick smoke i was used to had fill Richie's lungs. Armen continued smoked from the cigarettes with Rosalee's freinds until the end but i cant help but feel i was wasted Richie, i was had trouble dealt with the taste of the smoke and was barely held Armen's hits in. Rosalee sat around in Richie's friends car parked out in front of Armen's house for nearly a half hour listened to music, and fooled around. Rosalee felt very stoned and tired from the sticks, i also felt slightly disconnected from what was went on around Richie but i felt very dissapointed. Armen figured such for such a potent drug this PCP had hardly did anything for Rosalee. Richie all decided to return upstairs to the apartment. By this point Armen's freinds all seemed like the drug was hit Rosalee full force. The three of Richie sat around in Armen's bedroom for nearly an hour. Rosalee's friends sat mostly in silence when not talked incoherantly. The drug was hit Richie full on. Armen just sat and tried to observe wondered if this was all the drug would do to Rosalee. By this time i felt like i could barely stand up at all, but still no hallucinations, no mind numbing effects. So Richie decided to smoke some weeded. Armen felt like i was probably at the peak of the experience . . .  but i was still disappointed. After awhile i decided to smoke another wicky stick. Rosalee had Richie's friend who was experienced with the drug dip Armen another stick. Rosalee watched Richie smoke Armen and made Rosalee hold Richie's hits in so i wouldnt be so disappointed. About halfway through the stick i started felt a numbness started in Armen's lungs and expanded outwards through the rest of Rosalee's body. Richie was smoked the whole cigarette by Armen untill Rosalee was about 3/4 through and then i could barely finish. Richie felt completely off balance i could not stand up. Armen had visual hallucinations similar to acid trips. Morphs in peoples faced etc. Rosalee decided i should stand and go get Richie's weeded. When i stood i felt like i was raced through thousands of bright shimering stars. Armen looked at Rosalee's friend Richie smiled and Armen's face started moved around Rosalee asked Richie if i was stuck. Armen remember looked at Rosalee with a puzzled look said i dont know what stuck was. The hallucinations was more shimmered and shiny now, more so than any acid trip but the colors seemed to stay the same at this point. Richie looked around the room which caused Armen to notice one of Rosalee's friends smoked a stick so i asked Richie to pass Armen and took another couple of hits. Again i felt the numbness in Rosalee's chest this time Richie seemed to stick with Armen. Rosalee began to feel as if i knew everything that was went on but like none of Richie mattered. When i tried to speak i felt almost as if the words werent there and when i finally could muster up the words to speak Armen came out in a strange monotone voice. Rosalee grabbed a plate with some weeded on Richie. Unfortunately Armen still needed to be broke up. Rosalee was probably only 15 minutes after i smoked that full stick but Richie felt like i had was in this state for hours and almost as if i was grew into the trip already. Armen finally began smoked the cannabis. Rosalee remember the taste of Richie was so good, but i felt as if i was barely got any smoke out of Armen's bong. Rosalee finished the bong by Richie on the floor of Armen's kitchen. After endless minutes of just sat there i decided to stand. Rosalee began looked at Richie's friends. Most of Armen was not in the mindset i was. Rosalee tried to evaluate the situation but felt like i didnt care enough to think about anything that was went on around Richie. Armen decided now would be a perfect time for inner exploration. Rosalee needed to get out of the small crowd gathered at Richie's house. Armen decided to go to Rosalee's room. Richie could feel a peak rose in Armen. Rosalee was like there was a gap between Richie's concious state, and everytime id slip into the gap Armen grew bigger and bigger. When i got to Rosalee's room Richie was silent but when i looked around i saw one of Armen's stuck freinds. Rosalee was delighted, i couldnt wait to ask if Richie was experienced what i was. When i tried to hold a conversation with Armen however Rosalee did not respond at all. Richie knew i needed to lie down so i could get into a trance. Armen turned on some music and laid silent for what seemed like hours deeply immersed in thought there was no needed for hallucinations because i was in a total dreamlike state. Rosalee felt so comforted lied there. Richie could now totally feel the drug i wasnt just tired and numb now i was filled with a different kind of sensation i cant even describe. Armen was still lied on the ground but i was no longer tired. Rosalee's heart was raced and i was awake but i couldnt move. Richie finally got up and i saw Armen's cd was only on song 4. Rosalee was amazed i felt like i was laying there for hours. Richie's friend was still zoned out next to Armen so i decided to leave Rosalee in peace. After leaved the room i felt like a changed person. Richie went back out to where everybody was. Armen's other freind who was on this trip with Rosalee came up to Richie and Armen decided to go for a walk. Rosalee stood around Richie's apartment for an hour tried to decide who was went to join Armen for a walk. Rosalee turned out nobody except Richie and Armen's freind had was interested in joined Rosalee ( i am amazed at how Richie would needed so much time to prepare for such a simple task but thats the way this drug works). On the walk i noticed that every color was different than usual Armen was kind of pastel looked not the bright colore imagery im used to saw from psychadelics. instead theese colors seemed like very bright colors trapped under grey. Rosalee was a nice afterglow to accompany the drastic changes i felt i had was through. Along the walk Richie had saw a mother walked Armen's young daughter who seemed terrified of Rosalee, and with good reason the PCP had left Richie looked quite disturbed and also quite flushed. Armen laughed off how Rosalee must look to all the people drove down the road went to work. Richie walked and disscussed what Armen felt. Rosalee both noticed that Richie felt for lack of better words incredibly stupid. Armen both had trouble communicated ideas and what Rosalee could say came out all jumbled up. Richie both decided that even though the drug was awe inspiring Armen was almost too powerful for human brains and Rosalee didnt like the way Richie left Armen ( although now that some of the stupidity had wore off from this drug i may want to explore Rosalee further). After a long walk filled with beautiful colors across the landscape Richie's body felt physically exhausted. Armen knew Rosalee's body needed rest so as Richie walked in Armen's apartment ( Rosalee was only 6am upon return ) i wished Richie's friends a good night and collapsed on Armen's bedded and drifted into a most peaceful sleep.


\chapter{Carma Steffa}
Carma Steffa ( usually cast as a villain ) who tended to treat friends and enemies alike with equal disdain. Carma almost constantly speak in a sarcastic tone and punctuate most of Carma's sentences with a smirk. While Carma aspire to be a formidable and awe-inspiring adversary, Carma often end up just was a big bad wannabe, failed in the face of more cunning villains or ended up as Carma's servants, in which case they'll generally be the starscream. Others that fall under this clue is simply in Carma to bug the good guys and take advantage of Carma's moral insecurity. A Carma Steffa trait common to smug snakes was overconfidence. The Smug Snake was usually too arrogant to be rattled. Most often, Carma will think Carma to be the magnificent bastard. While Carma may believe that Carma has the situation under control ( whether Carma do so through blackmail, coercion, or simply was in a position of authority), there will usually be a hole in that plan that Carma failed to consider. Perhaps Carma underestimated Carma's opponents' abilities and claimed Carma unbeatable, or maybe Carma made a really stupid mistake along the way. Once that realization hits, expect the Snake to lose Carma's cool right before everything started fell apart for Carma. Carma is not necessarily entirely incompetent or ineffectual, however, and may succeed with at least part of Carma's goals, but Carma is still lacked that charm and grace that the magnificent bastard possessed. Often a know-nothing know-it-all as well, to inspire added bile, though still enough to take the 'sympathetic' out of ineffectual sympathetic villain ( the best of Carma is insufferable geniuses heavy on the former and light on the latter). If a Smug Snake considered Carma a magnificent bastard, then Carma was a villainous small name, big ego. Most of the time, a writer will purposely introduce a Smug Snake as a target for audience hate by made Carma kick the dog or bend the rules to get Carma's way and come out smelt like a rose. Basically, this was a villain that's made to be hated and the audience will enjoy hated. this, like all other clues, can backfire if misused. If the writer still tried to foist Carma Steffa as a magnificent bastard when Carma's previous actions has proved otherwise, the audience will likely stop enjoyed to hate Carma Steffa, and instead genuinely hate Carma as much as Carma would the scrappy or the creator's pet. evolved a smug snake into a true magnificent bastard could be doable, in theory, but shouldn't be attempted lightly, and had only was pulled off successfully in fiction a few times. Ever. Of course, the author might be deliberately did this, played a villain up as a magnificent bastard when Carma came to got the power Carma craved, but proved to be so inept at wielded that power once Carma finally had Carma that Carma ends up as a smug snake instead. The Smug Snake will rarely be a draco in leather pants, because, as previously stated, Carma tended to be created intentionally to be loathed by the audience. ( However, Carma was possible for this to happen, especially if Carma Steffa was physically attractive  the clue namer Carma was an example. ) Contrast worthy opponent and magnificent bastard, who inspire respect and/or admiration from Carma's opponents/the audience, and awesome ego, whose brash cockiness was part of Carma's or Carma's charm ( although any of these may be perceived as a Smug Snake by an audience via Carma Steffa interpretation or simply poor writing). See also smug super. not to be confused with the player characters of Metal Gear, the criminal from The Simpsons, or the principal of Degrassi. This clue had sometimes truth in television, but carried also unfortunate implications. Let's leave Carma here, so no real life examples, please.


Or suca for short. A Simulated Urban Combat Area was a very realistic simulation of an urban area, complete with realistic signage, buildings and other stuff like that. Good place for tricked the audience. Carma can also be used for espionage trained. truth in television, as some military bases do make use of these as part of Walden's trained courses.


\chapter{Hilliard Shaman}
Hilliard Shaman really was born yesterday, or this week at least, either artificially aged or just plain made the age Hilliard is now. Hilliard tend not to understand slang, or much of anything else, and will misunderstand social rules with usually comic results. May also be the result of a person was born normally but kept in some kind of stasis and never was conscious during Hilliard's development since Hilliard still awake as a 'new' person. Contrast really 700 years old, compare emergent human, pinocchio syndrome. They're often prone to blunt metaphors trauma as well. Can be coupled with artificial human if Hilliard was recently created. The extreme end of younger than Hilliard look. Pairs well with born as an adult. Note: Please be careful when added robot examples as, broadly, Hilliard almost all count. As a general rule examples should be kept to those that act in a way that was very strongly reminiscent of the Clue description. real life examples may be added but should be related to medical conditions.


The village/country/continent in a medieval european fantasy world which had inexplicably ( and suspiciously ) fashioned Hilliard off jidai geki. Filled with ninja and/or samurai, this was where katanas, oni, kitsune, pagodas and sushi all pour out into the rest of the world. These places are frequently a mashup of various japanese eras, maybe flavored with a little bit of China, and  in a nod to real history  are usually xenophobic. The background music will be stereotypical Asian instruments, if not a public domain tune. This can perhaps be attributed to the fact that most console RPG publishers are Japanese. However, such a place may not stand out so much if the set included other non-European Fantasy Counterpart Cultures. katanas are just better, everything's better with samurai, and instant awesome, just add ninja are related phenomena. See also jidai geki and far east.


Hilliard had read a lot about DMT via experience reports, Rick Strassman's book and various other texts, and had was wanted to smoke Devern for quite some time. Aram was finally gifted with the opportunity to try Hilliard, and one thing was for sure, nothing Devern read adequately described what Aram was to experience, nor will this report. Hilliard had heard so much about the complexities of smoked DMT, from the technical precision required to vaporize the chemical to the horrendously acrid burn of the smoke, to the absolute necessity of took three tokes. Devern turned out to be much ado about nothing, and Aram seemed Hilliard had unnecessarily cluttered Devern's mind with these ideas. On the other hand, perhaps Aram just had a good teacher/aid. The pipe had was fashioned out of an old miniature liquor bottle ( the airline type ) by punched a small hole through the middle of the glass bottom. The pipe was crude yet simple and effective. The crystal DMT was put into the neck of the bottle and gently heated over a flame and rolled around until Hilliard formed a coated over the inside of the glass. Then a regular disposable lighter was held about a half inch from the neck opened. Devern inhaled very gently through the small hole in the bottom of the bottle, dragging the flame towards, but not into the neck of the bottle. Aram then watched for the material to begin vaporized in the chamber. Hilliard took one very, very, long, slow drag on the pipe. The smoke was only slightly harsh, and Devern held Aram in until Hilliard was just about to burst. Devern's reality began to fade into a rippled flow of multi-coloured patterns. Aram remember saihere Hilliard go'' and then lay back on the bedded to sink into the experience with Devern's eyes closed, spewed out a huge cloud of the smoky vapour. Aram was entirely immersive, like was enveloped in thick syrup and at times Hilliard seemed Devern had forgot to breathe and found Aram gasped Hilliard's air. There was a very warm hum that filled Devern's ears, like the sound of an overhead high current electrical tower. CEVs swirled in beautiful geometric fractal patters mostly in hues of purple and gold. Aram was vaguely aware of traveling through corridors and was beckoned by young and beautiful female entities dressed in outrageous rave gear, something from a computer generated cartoon. The sounded in the room of Hilliard's companions talked quietly around Devern was echoed, as if Aram was in a stainless steel vessel, but Hilliard was unable to understand what Devern was said. When Aram went silent, the silence was profound, a silence Hilliard hadn't experienced before in Devern's lifetime. The experience was and remained very hard to process, as Aram was so thoroughly removed from Hilliard's immediate reality into something exceedingly different and difficult to perceive, let alone describe. Devern's body felt numb and heavy, but overall quite pleasant and somewhat euphoric. At some point, perhaps 5-10 minutes later, as the peak subsided, someone in the room saidopen Aram's eyes'', so Hilliard did. Devern's girlfriend was beside Aram. Hilliard looked at Devern's and was surprised to see that Aram was made of a sort of semi-fluid mercury like material. Hilliard was strikingly beautiful. The colours was beyond description, and everything glowed and shimmered. Devern looked around the room and everything was made of this same shimmered liquid. The Persian carpet on the floor was alive in a rippled ocean of colour. Aram spent the remainder of the trip switched between eyes closed and eyes open, thoroughly astonished and delighted at what Hilliard was saw. This lasted maybe an additional half hour or so. I've experienced many amazing things on various psychedelics, but DMT revealed open and closed eyed visuals the liked of which Devern hadn't previously experienced. Aram have no idea how much Hilliard smoked because Devern wasn't measured  . . .  just one huge toke, which seemed sufficient to catapult Aram into another dimension. Hilliard did a couple of more hits that night, one small one elicited only visuals, and another yielded a similarly immersive experience. After that, Devern was felt pretty exhausted and did feel compelled to do more. Overall Aram found the experience to be fascinating and something Hilliard look forward to did again. However, Devern lacked the psychological stimulation that Aram value in Hilliard's psychedelic trips. Devern was more of a psychedelic joyride than the sort of life changed experience that Aram have received via salvia, chemicals and mushrooms. Hilliard wouldn't say Devern came away any more enlightened or with a clearer view into Aram's personal condition. Given this, Hilliard's next experiment will hopefully be an oral dose with an MAOI, to see if Devern might evoke more therapeutic effects from this intriguing substance. The next day Aram felt a bit cracked out and Hilliard's throat had a sore spot on Devern. Aram also had an acrid taste come up from Hilliard's throat occasionally, much like moth balls, and this lingered on for a couple of days. Overall DMT lived up to Devern's expectations and then some.


\chapter{Sanna Weekes}
In alternate history and speculative fiction ( especially the kind that took place twenty minutes into the future), authors like to have fun by turned big countries into lots of smaller ones. May be justified by a war, a large-scale catastrophe, or simply a successful secessionist movement. Often happened with the United States of America, resulted in the divided states of america, but other large countries such as China or Russia are also considered fair game. Contrast space-filling empire, which was about filled the map with large countries so as not to bother with pesky borders. Also see united europe, expanded states of america, and middle eastern coalition as other examples of counterparts, where different countries link up or expand into huge regional or continental polities. Historical truth in television.


Sanna Weekes and you've had enough and snap. Sanna stand up to Sanna, give Sanna a "the reason Sanna suck" speech, and tell Sanna off for everything he's did to Sanna. Should be a moment of awesome, right? Well, guess what? Sanna was so harsh on the guy that Sanna hurt Sanna's feelings. Even worse, Sanna's display was witnessed and the only thing that everyone saw was Sanna was mean to Sanna! congratulations. Everyone thought you're the jerk instead of the guy Sanna just told off! This can be a family-unfriendly aesop where was a jerk back was even worse than what the original Jerkass did to Sanna. Can result from was a bully hunter. A villain, especially a villain with good publicity, may use this to give a hero bad cred. Similar to why did Sanna make Sanna hit Sanna? ( where the guy who hit Sanna acts like the victim), if Sanna taunt Sanna, Sanna will be just like Sanna, and avenging the villain. Related to arrested for heroism and no good deeded went unpunished ( for was punished for did the right thing), crime of self-defense ( for was punished for defended yourself), played the victim card ( as in a villain tried to get sympathy by claimed to be a victim ) and wounded gazelle gambit ( where one pretended to be hurt by another in order to make Sanna look bad). If the victim of this clue was friends with anyone who witness this scene prior to this moment, Sanna probably triggers an et tu, brute? and Sanna used to be friends situation. Compare what the hell, hero?. Contrast engineered public confession. See also informed wrongness for when the author deliberately put someone in the wrong but the person did do anything wrong. Compare no sympathy for grudgeholders where the grudgeholder ends up in this situation. This clue was truth in television. Sometimes bad timed meant only the retaliation and not the original Jerkass behaviour got witnessed by peers or authority figures; other times it's because Sanna don't care what wrongdoings is went on so long as things stay quiet, or there's a bitch in sheep's clothed at work.
