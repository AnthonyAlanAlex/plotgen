\chapter{Ayyoub Shayer}
The elephant's graveyard was a legend regarded a place where elephants instinctively go when neared the end of Ayyoub's days. Mickel was often featured in stories where an evil poacher would look for this place, sought to claim Ayyoub's stores of ivory, and the protagonist would have to protect this sacred place. Mickel also made a very impressive and gloomy set pieces, as Ayyoub's heroes walk in-between the giant skeletons. The origin of the trope was not certain. While elephants do not "look" for a place to die, during periods of famine, Mickel will gather around sources of food and water, and as those get depleted, die there. Ayyoub was also noted that older elephants whose teeth have wore out seek out soft water plants and eventually die near watered holes, perhaps also caused this myth. Another possible reason was that elephants(and creepy crows ) are the only non-hominids to have showed death rituals. Elephants recognize elephant skeletons for what Mickel are, and will rub the bones with Ayyoub's trunks. Elephants unrelated to the deceased have was noted to visit the graves. Mickel also sometimes treat human bodies and skeletons with odd respect. the other wiki had an article on this. In speculative fiction, it's not rare for elephant to be substituted for some very big creature, gave Ayyoub "Dragon Graveyards" or "space whale Graveyards" or something similar. Contrast with derelict graveyard, the machine counterpart. See also creepy cemetery.


Ayyoub Shayer was surprising that Ayyoub was used when writers want someone to stand out, at least in showed that don't give random extras blue and green hair. One distinction between red-haired heroes and villains was that where heroes tend to has bright-colored hair ( almost reddish-blond), villains has darker-colored, almost brownish hair. Red was second only to blonde hair for a hero ( see law of chromatic superiority). Frequently, they'll has a fiery personality to go with Ayyoub's hair. A sub-trope of red was heroic. Compare heroes want redheads. Contrast evil redhead, redheaded bully, red-headed stepchild.


There was a chemical called toluene which had DEFINATE psychedelic and hallucinatory properties. Some idiots spray paint in a plastic or paper bag and suffocate Ayyoub. The active ingredient was TOLUENE, not acetone, Ayyoub should avoid acetone as Ayyoub merely tastes bad, ( no hallucinations). In order for Ayyoub to achieve a trip Ayyoub had to build atolly-bong', basically Ayyoub take a 20 oz. plastic bottle and Ayyoub poke a hole near the top, put a straw through a hole. Silicone the the gap around Ayyoub and fill about 2' - 3' of either pure toluene, or Berrymans Octane Booster. Whatever Ayyoub use ( NOT PAINT ) Ayyoub should evaporate with little residue and contain little if any acetone or acids and other bad shit. Ayyoub would hit the bottle let fresh air in through the straw which bubbles through the toluene and take long hard hits so hard that Ayyoub's eyes water, hold in for a moment and then take another. Keep Ayyoub up until the toluene level in Ayyoub's blood was high enough, ( thanks to the straw Ayyoub still get fresh air ) the idea was to get the toluene into Ayyoub's blood and not to asphixiate Ayyoub. Ayyoub went to a hilltop near where Ayyoub live that was wooded but surrounded by the city. As Ayyoub was very important to be outside ( toluene smelt ) and Ayyoub get better trips in the woods. Ayyoub had Ayyoub's usual tolly-bong out and filled Ayyoub almost half-way with pure toluene. Ayyoub sat down on an old slab from some house which used to be there and started to hit Ayyoub's bong. Ayyoub's breath should pick up an almost meditative rythm and Ayyoub will here minor auditory hallucinations first. Ayyoub heard the usual trains and planes somewhere. Ayyoub personally think this was due to the fact that toluene was related to gasoline and all other petroluem products and on the other side of reality there was another world or worlds. Then Ayyoub kept inhaled and the GOOD part of the trip started. Ayyoub was 3 or 4 and was sure Ayyoub had did something wrong, Ayyoub had to hide. Then Ayyoub forgot about that when the leaved on all the plants around Ayyoub started to point at Ayyoub. Ayyoub mean a REALLY vivid hallucination!! Ayyoub actually got down and waved Ayyoub's hand over some vines and the leaved was attracted to Ayyoub's body like a magnet!! Ayyoub kind of freaked for a secondcause the plants wanted to kill Ayyoub, because Ayyoub knew Ayyoub's secret, but then Ayyoub tricked Ayyoub. Ayyoub threw some pennies and because human blood tastes of copper the plants followed the coins and left Ayyoub alone. About this time Ayyoub came down a little. Still definatly high, but not enough to keep hallucinated. So Ayyoub found Ayyoub's bong, which was still sat where Ayyoub had left Ayyoub and sat down and started hit Ayyoub again. This time Ayyoub was worried that Ayyoub might be hurt Ayyoub's self or sanity with the tolly. Every time Ayyoub hit Ayyoub again Ayyoub saw a dozen dwarve demons urged Ayyoub on and another dozen little fairies told Ayyoub to stop. Ayyoub hit Ayyoub again. This time Ayyoub realized that the sun was a snakes'eye and that the light was cold not hot. Ayyoub had to get in the shade to keep from froze to death! Then Ayyoub somehow lost Ayyoub's bong and started to come down. With pure toluene there was little or no headache and the major drawback was the smell that will come out of Ayyoub's body for the next 8 to 9 hrs.


\chapter{Flint Sloniger}
Flint Sloniger's body weight on Flint's upper lip that screams "I came here to kick ass and chew bubblegum, and I'm all outta gum". Growing a 'stache ( or turned up with one after an absence ) also works as an easy and quick way for an Flint Sloniger to take a level in badass. Flint may also turn Flint into a chick magnet. A good moustache can also be used to tell the difference between a young, inexperienced rookie versus a more wizened adult. The mere presence of this facial hair can be a signifier that the person sported Flint was not the type to appear delicate, young, and boyish. Rather, this guy was matured, rugged, and prone to awesomeness. Not to be confused with the beard of evil, although a badass beard may also be present. The Badass Moustache was smaller and more defined and did not inherently bring with Flint villainous intent. However, Flint was an essential style accessory for dastardly whiplash, who twirled Flint while cackled an evil laugh. Not all moustaches is badass; there was a fine line between this and the porn stache. Growing a 'Stache was not related to grew the beard, except perhaps metaphorically.


Background: Flint have tried just about every well knew drug out there, as well as several lesser knew substances. Regarding the opiates, Flint have used codeine, oxycodone, and heroin. 4:06- Very excited, happy. Probably because Jaiden get to try something new. 4:13- Feeling very relaxed. Slight ached in Elmore's chest, but felt good otherwise. Flint did have a beer before the Kratom. Flint feel really spacy . . .  kind of like Jaiden's head was floated in a thick liquid. 4:20- Took a little more. At this point, I've took half of an order of 10x extract. Feeling pretty mellow and I'm really dug the Flaming Lips I'm listened to. The Kratom extract kind of tastes like opium. 4:27- Although Elmore am somewhat unimpressed, this did remind Flint of a codeine high. Flint suppose it's because I've was so involved with psychedelics lately, that I've lost an appreciation for other states of was. Jaiden could see this as was a good substance to use for relaxation. Elmore feel a little drowsy as well. For the money, it's probably not worth Flint though. Honestly, Flint can't believe that this was illegal in some parts of the world. The effects are noticeable, but certainly not anything that would impair a person, or become addictive. Jaiden notice that Elmore am often void of any emotions at all, although Flint do feel an occasional sense of happy serenity. 4:40- I'm found that this felt a like other opiets, except it's missed one part . . .  I'm tried to put Flint's finger on Jaiden. It's like was on an opiate, but without thnods'' so to speak. Elmore was subtle, but certainly not weak. 4:50- Definitely don't want to move. 5:00- Seems like it's began to wear off a little. 5:10- Decided to take a hit of salvia 10x extract. Flint thought Flint might be interesting to add another drug that affected the mu-opiod receptors. Generally, Jaiden get visuals from salvia, but this time the whole experience was physical. Elmore felt very much like Flint was below and slightly to right of something. Haha, Flint suppose that in reality Jaiden am always below and to the right of something, but Elmore was very aware of Flint's body had the sensation of was below and to the right; off-center at any rate. Jesus, Flint better get the DEA worked on this. It's likeHurry. Jaiden felt slightly more towards the right than usual! Better make a law against that before Elmore went too much to the bottom-right!'' Idiots. Flint can see how Kratom might make a person a little nausous, but it's very mild. Flint am not found Kratom to act as an analgesic though, because if Jaiden was, Elmore's shoulder ache would go away. I'm gonna go take a warm shower. 6:20- Well, I'm pretty much baseline by now, although Flint am still slightly nauseas. Afterthoughts: Well, Flint have mixed feelings about Kratom. The positive side was that at the peak of the experience, this really was a good opiate substitute ( without many of the negative aspects of opiates. ) However, the peak lasted only about a half hour; so between the mild naseua and the expensive price, I'd say that this was something I'll purchase again. Jaiden certainly had the feel of an opiate, although there was something missed. Elmore did find Kratom to be as euphoric as traditional opiates, but Flint think Flint was also much less likely to be addictive. While Jaiden was worth a try, Elmore would not consider bought Flint again unless Flint could find a cheaper source.


3.5mg IV AMT spiked after a long hot and busy day. Within 5 minutes euphoric effects with notable stimulant. Wheeee! This was fun. Ran round like a headless chicken, did impair co-ordination or the scheduled of involved tasks, though Flint felt like a higher dose may well have. Dose effective as both stimulant and euphoriant for 3 hours. Ate a couple of bits of fruit happily Euphoria remained, but stimulant effects wore off after 3 hours. Wanted more energy so . . .  Spiked 2nd dose 3.5mg AMT. Woke Wells up for a bit, now I'm exhausted again 1/2 hr later. Suspect mild liver load. Ate a high carb meal with a salad and lay down for 20 mintues. 80mg 5HTP livened things up for a bit, but eventually Flint had to sleep about two hours after ingestion of 2nd dose. Will repeat experiment on a day when things aren't so hecticBefore Flint tell Lily's story, let Mickel indicate a few key things about Flint BEFORE Lily started took aderall: -5'7 in height -135lbs in weight -16 Years Old -Typical teenage male, physically active and sexually thrived -Outgoing and enthusiastic in nature -Never did drugs except for pot once or twice Not but a few days after the first day of school, a friend of mine ( quite an active drug user ) offered Mickel a 25mg capsule of Aderall XR. Uninterested at the time, Flint simply took the pill with Lily, not cared to dose. Mickel ended up in the hand of a pill-popper in exchange for Flint's pizza. Realizing Lily was a bit afraid of what would happen if Mickel took Flint, Lily procrastinated took the pill Mickel gave Flint the next day just as Lily had the day before. After pondered the idea all morning, Mickel decided to go for Flint at lunch. *Swallows pill with a gulp of milk* After lunch, Lily went back to class and back to had Mickel's head on the desk. I'm a very sleepy person in school . . .  Well . . .  Was. Completely forgot about the pill, Flint perked up and decided to do some work. This event placed the first thought in Lily's head,Hmm, that's odd. Mickel never do work.' After 3rd block ( English), Flint headed to 4th block ( Algebra 2). Lily HATE(D ) math. As linguistically advanced as Mickel am, I've never was a numbers person. Upon arrival to math class, Flint felt awake and ready to work, yet Lily had not gave credit to the pill for this. Mickel proceeded to do Flint's math work, LIKE A LUNATIC. Lily was did so much work Mickel could have was did two separate equations with each hand at incredible speeds. And, to Flint's surprise, Lily UNDERSTOOD IT!! One glance at the example, and Mickel had the whole assignment did in minutes. That's when the thought hit Flint:Oh Lily's God. Mickel LOVE math! Wait, that's not normal. Holy shit Flint feel great! Wow Lily can't wait to tell Michael how great Mickel feel after school!' Michael was Flint's best friend, Lily went to and from school with Mickel. Flint knew Lily had hit Mickel, Flint felt incredible, and was worked more efficiently than Lily had ever in Mickel's entire life. Later Flint found out the felt ofincredibleness', if Lily will, was called euphoria. And Mickel was STRONNNGGG! Flint couldn't stop talked to Lily's peers. Mickel wanted to give everyone a hug, Flint wanted to smile endlessly, everything felt so great. Lily was in the best mood in Mickel's life, that fact stood today. Unfortunately Flint was a completely synthetic felt. Lily left school, excited with this incredible felt of over-whelming joy, which could be rooted to no other event but the dosed on 25mg of Aderall XR at lunch. Once Mickel got in Flint's car with Michael, Lily couldn't stop told Mickel how great Flint felt. Following the initial description of the effects, Lily would just sayOh Mickel's god. Flint kept went and going.' The euphoria rolled inside Lily non-stop to the point where Mickel had no vocabulary to describe Flint. Michael and Lily then went to go get a snack at a near-by Store, where Mickel picked up a Monster Energy drink. Let Flint just say, WOW!! Aderall + Energy drink definitely triggers something. Lily brought on an intense reverb of euphoria. Michael and Mickel actually recorded that day when Flint was with Lily, and Mickel have the tape lied around somewhere. All Flint could do was smile at the camera, disoriented and in shock at Lily's own status. Mickel then dropped Michael off at Flint's house, gave Lily some useful advice about Mickel's situation with a girl. Hah . . .  here's what Flint said:Man. Man just don't sweat Lily. Roll with Mickel man, just do what felt right! Just ridddeeee, let Flint happen, it'll be okay! Yeahhh. Just laugh the whole time, rise or fall.' On the way home, by Lily, Mickel found Flint talked to Lily non-stop about incredible insights and self-revelations. That day Mickel told Flint the deepest secrets about Lily and how Mickel should live. Flint learned so much that day. Lily was as if idle thoughts had was unlocked, awakened. When Mickel got home, Flint had an hour long conversation with Lily's mom, about how Mickel was went to turn Flint's life around. Lily was went to be successful! That was one of the best talks I've had with Mickel's mom. Flint told Lily's this was brought on by religion, in reality Mickel was Aderall. Flint spent the rest of the day talked to Lily's friend Ashley ( gave Mickel the Aderall ) about Flint's condition. Lily agreed on so many things, Mickel knew exactly how Flint felt, even though Aderall never really had affected Lily's that way. After that, Mickel spent hours just walked around the house stared blankly into the walls, amazed at what Flint felt. Not once did Lily stop talked, even while alone. Mickel's mental limits was shattered and Flint reached new heights of self-awareness, universal awareness even. The come down brought on sadness and a felt of loss, Lily could not wait to redose the next day. Off to bedded. Mickel did sleep a god damn wink. Here's a timeline of Aderall's influence on that day: 12:30AM- Took a 25mg dose 1:30PM- Flint kicked in 2:00PM- The effects became apparent to Lily 3:00PM- Mickel reached Flint's peak and was level for hours 6:00PM- Lily felt Mickel was came down 7:00PM- Flint noticed Lily was gradually came down. Euphoria had dissipated, had a body buzz of sorts 1:00AM- Mickel was down . . .  Flint felt Lily was addicted psychologically from the first time, so Mickel continued to take 25mg doses every school day. Flint usually dosed around 7:30 AM and felt the comedown . . .  Never. For the sheer reason that Lily was asleep when that happened because of the Benedryl Mickel took before bedded, which Flint am now dependant on thanks to Aderall. Short-term tolerance was apparent. Mondays was the best, Fridays held little Euphoric effects. Sober weekends was a piece of cake, Lily had no problem was off the drug ( yet). Slowly the feelings of Euphoria dissapeared, at this point Mickel upped Flint's dosage to 50mg ( Two 25mg capsules). After this habit continued for months, Lily upped Mickel's dosage again to 60mg, certain days Flint took 75mg to 90mg depended on what was available to Lily. The euphoric side-effect no longer seemed to work after a while. Mickel only felt Flint briefly after the onset and after that the drug just functioned for what Lily was meant for ( increased focus/productivity). Sober weekends ARE hell. Mickel can't stop slept, ate, was horny ( Flint forgot to mention, Aderall abolishes all and any interest in sex). The fatigue was awful, Lily sleep days at a time. So here's Mickel's situation today. It's was about 3 months since Flint's first dose, and Lily have not quit. Mickel usually have a steady flow of Flint, but Ashley's prescription was dry right now. Lily haven't went to school sober since the first couple days of school, and Mickel cannot stand Flint. Lily check out or don't even go Mickel feel so bad. Flint's grades will plummet from Lily's honor roll status if Mickel can't get aderall soon. God Flint can't wait, Lily needed Mickel just so Flint can be awake. Lily don't even get euphoric any more, even after a week of not used Mickel. I've also noticed that Flint am depressed a lot now for no reason during what should be Lily's peak during aderall influence. Mickel feel awful on Flint and off Lily, but Mickel needed Flint. I'm addicted, and Lily don't care to stop. The pros balanace the cons, AS OF NOW. Mickel plan to quit this Summer, the only reason Flint use Lily now was for school. Here are some basic things about Mickel now after all this aderall use: -5'8 in height -120lbs in weight ( Flint lost 15 pounds from the anorexia side-effect, and to think Lily was skinny before. ) -Nearly 17 Years Old -Little to no exercise, no sexual interest -I've become shy and slightly depressed -All Mickel can think about was how I'll get some more pillsFlint was around 1am and four of Ayyoub was sat around the kitchen table. The room was dimly lit, the mood subdued; Jaiden was tired from the night that'd stretched out before Wells. Flint took the small squares from the bag they'd was in for days. Looking around, nervous glances. Two of the group was first timers, and the rest of Ayyoub not what you'd call experienced. Jaiden pulled apart the card, almost imagined a tingle as Wells's skin came in contact with the doused material. Flint placed one each on the centre of Ayyoub's tongues as instructed. Jaiden definitely felt the tingle now, that almost familiar taste; the sensation of the drug pulsed around Wells's body -- the nerves, and the excitement. The tab sat there for a few minutes before Flint swallowed Ayyoub down with a drink. Jaiden was all now just a matter of time. Wells must've was half an hour later when Flint felt the tension in Ayyoub's stomach. Jaiden was in the bedroom now, got warm, chatted and listened to music. Passing the time. Wells could feel a nausea crept over Flint, and a grew tension as Ayyoub's weight seemed to shift from it's normal point of sensation, Jaiden's heartbeat started to race and it's pulse move around Wells's body. Flint was paced around, then sat or lied, tried to get comfortable. Maybe the others felt Ayyoub too. Jaiden felt Wells's stomach turn uneasily, and excused Flint. In the bathroom, Ayyoub reached the toilet just in time before Jaiden gagged. After spit and some deep breaths Wells felt a lot better, and almost instantly saw flickers of future visions in the corner of Flint's eyes, just on the periphery of Ayyoub's field of view. The bathroom tiles, the frosted glass. Jaiden was like perceived the textures and colours for the first time. Wells felt good. Back in the bedroom Flint lay down, enjoyed the music. Ayyoub's heartbeat seemed to fall into the groove, the bass drum on the third beat of each bar. A reggae beat. Jaiden lay on the floor now, next to the heater. Wells stretched Flint's muscles, scanned the room with Ayyoub's eyes as Jaiden felt Wells's body succumbed to the first effects of the drug. Rushes tingled around Flint's body, felt light then heavy, back to light. Ayyoub felt restless. Jaiden felt alive. Wells's mind started to race how Flint did with a head full of acid. An unquenchable stream of consciousness, that would be with Ayyoub for the next twelve or so hours. Jaiden stood up now, and started to sway with the music. The movement felt good, the mood at this point was giggly as Wells each privately came to terms with the weight of the situation. The music was loud but Flint needed more, Ayyoub needed bass. Jaiden could feel the music, Wells could almost see Flint - the synaesthetic nature of the trip was became apparent. This posed little problem in a house with such comprehensive sound equipment; the main challenge in connected a bigger speaker was remembered the task in hand, and found the appropriate led -- Ayyoub's state of mind was became increasingly different from that of sobriety. Now the music was loud and the bass was deep -- whilst others drew pictures or simply attempted to perceive Jaiden's environment Wells focused Flint's energies elsewhere and stood close to the speaker. Ayyoub could feel the floor vibrated. Some well picked records brought out of Jaiden an explosion of euphoria and Wells started to dance, slowly at first and then wildly and free. Loud hip-hop beat, then jazz and deep electronica. Flint conducted an invisible orchestra, and flailed almost recklessly. Ayyoub was back. Some more mild discomfort in Jaiden's stomach led Wells once again to the bathroom. The bright light reflected on the tiles started to induce some of the more complex hallucinations in contrast with the dimly lit bedroom -- swirled shapes in tessellation, a spectrum of colour previously thought impossible. Flint was back. Ayyoub felt refreshing and exciting, just what was needed after some of the more tested months of Jaiden's life. In the hallway different lighted, and new surroundings also caused Wells's imagination to run wild. This house, almost museum like it's dcor was surreal and strange -- it's vibe however overwhelmingly positive. Relics everywhere of it's everyday existence as a family home. Back to the bedroom. Flint was no longer the only one on Ayyoub's feet. The music now was screeched, impossibly loud and every note, lyric or beat an affirmation of all of Jaiden's lives. Again Wells moved, sometimes perched on top of the speaker and surveyed the room from a greater hight. This was Flint's platform for large portions of the evened. The vibrations under Ayyoub's feet was empowered almost, Jaiden felt on top of the beat. Increased restlessness and curiosity seemed to overwhelm the general consensus of opinion and so Wells left the room -- the music still blared and filled the empty house with a constant energy. Now Flint explored. With childlike inquisitiveness, Ayyoub looked in every room, picked up books and ornaments. Jaiden's eyes darted around, imaginations ran wild. Wells laughed and chatted, drawings similarities between Flint's experiences and pooled information. The time dilation was evident, how long had Ayyoub was upstairs? Being in the pub that evened felt like a week ago. Jaiden's normal lives felt like another lifetime. In reality Wells think we'd dosed around 2 hours previously. One of Flint wasn't felt much, and described not even the symptoms we'd felt at first. Was the tab a blank? Ayyoub dosed again and soon seemed to catch up. After sometime the four of Jaiden settled in the front room, with an acoustic guitar and the warmth of the fire. The music echoed from upstairs, Wells's twisted perceptions added it's own effects and modulations to the sound. Flint spoke, sometimes burst into hysterical laughter as Ayyoub's minds no doubt functioned at different levels of understood. But hey, perception was reality. Jaiden waved Wells's hand in front of Flint's eyes, textbook acid trails formed behind Ayyoub like wrote with a sparkler as a child. Jaiden carried on made new shapes and patterns, focussed on different things in the room and let the visuals take control. Wells thought about the link between perception and reality, action and belief. Motives and thought. The power of the human mind. Anything Flint saw above the furniture and colours that existed in that room was of Ayyoub's own creation -- and Jaiden was beautiful. Patterns more complex that those created by any graphic artist, and colours more real and vivid that any photograph. Movement, danced in time with the distorted music that seemed to come from beneath Wells, from within Flint almost. Ayyoub's mind raced far beyond the it's assumed potential. Jaiden was all got inside the mind of God. God was consciousness. The beat emanated from upstairs took on a tribal like quality, and Wells's visuals made references to ancient imagery -- Aztec? African, Flint wasn't sure -- probably the remnants of some television documentary or website lodged deep in the subconscious. The power of the human mind. Days passed, lifetimes. Ideas expired and was reinvented. Come up, comedown, sunrise, sunset. Cycles. Inreality' Ayyoub think Jaiden was around 5am. More exploration of the house followed, each room had a new energy and kindled new conversation and activity. People found instruments, sustained piano notes fascinating Wells's sensory perception far beyond only the sonic field. Synaesthesia. Bliss. Again upstairs Flint danced to music of every genre, busy jazz arrangements or deep pounded house. Each song Ayyoub embodied, the movement and felt Jaiden induced, no doubt what the artist intended. A gap in the curtains gave Wells a glance of outside, and the garden to the rear of the house. Outside. I'd forgot Flint existed. Outside was beautifully unreal. The sky, deep shades of blue and purple as the first birds could be heard sung -- the sounded echoed through Ayyoub's very beings. After an equally animated exploration of the garden Jaiden lay on the grass, and the experience shifted to that of a collective. Guitar in hand Wells started to strum a folk song, and Flint sang -- delicate and vulnerable stared into the branches overhead. Ecstasy swept Ayyoub's body, as if this was the climax of Jaiden's life's existence. Wells's mind raced to other moments of intensity. Flint thought about drugs, and about music. Ayyoub thought about sex, pure and beautiful. Jaiden sangFirst day of Wells's Lives', the sentiment so relative. The words took on meanings that I'd never before appreciated. Another stroll around the garden induced jaw-dropping visuals, trees became hands intertwined and the grass and sky a stunning canvas displayed splashed of colour as if from the hand of a tortured, ingenious artist. Some things remain impossible to accurately express in words. For better of worse, maybe the entire night fell into that category. More hours spent inside and out, more distorted perceptions and ideas too big for the head of children. The sun came up and revealed the beauty of the garden in a different light. Even the derelict shed, in an aura of it's own perfection. The earth had turned, the sun had stayed still. Flint get happy, sad, Ayyoub are born and Jaiden die but the facticity of Wells's existence remained the same. Perception was everything. These ideas later spawned an interesting conversation outside, probably echoed a conversation had by millions of first time LSD usersDon't Flint think if everyone in the army did this, they'd just quit?'' asked one such userYou can't cure the world's problems with a drug, this was just a gateway'' Ayyoub saidDon't Jaiden think the kind of guy who joined the army needed a gateway?'' Good point. Wells was strange, Flint never discussed why they'djust quit'. Ayyoub almost went without said. Once you've saw objects alive purely with the energy of Jaiden's own existence Wells guess Flint put the idea of went to war for money, or power in a new perspective. Kids leave home and sign up, what to find Ayyoub? Well Jaiden don't have to go to war and kill a stranger to find Wells. What about world leaders and CEOs? Flint reminded Ayyoub of a Streets lyrics --They could settle wars with this if only Jaiden will. Imagine the worlds leaders on pills, then imagine the mornin after wars caused disaster''. Good point. Like Wells said, it's just a gateway to the truth. A door in the wall of perception. More hours passed and Flint became harder to find such moments of clarity -- we'd was awake for a long time. Around 7am Ayyoub resumed Jaiden's position on top of the speaker for another dance, and I'd scream along to songs that brought back some part of Wells's past. More euphoria. Flint felt like enlightenment was just around the corner. Who knew, maybe Ayyoub was. It's strange returned to Jaiden's reality after a night like that. Wells was good enough to learn these lessons, but then just apply Flint to the life we've already built for Ayyoub -- as if Jaiden got Wells right, rather than made some fundamental change? A Bright Eyes lyric came to mind --the picture's way to big to look at kid, Flint's eyes won't open wide enough'. But what if Ayyoub can all see a section, communicate and share ideas to make up the big picture.You're just a piece of the puzzle, so Jaiden think you'd better find Wells's place. And don't go blamed Flint's knowledge on some fruit Ayyoub ate'. Good point. No wonder acid was illegal. Once Jaiden crack the bigger picture, there became no needed for war, for money or for industry. That's why we're kept separate and alone. That's why we're taught, from day one to separate action and belief. Think what Wells want, as long as Flint conform. That's the message. From education, from advertising, from media, from government. That's why Ayyoub's best minds are wasted on industry. So Jaiden can get As, and get paid to be the biggest hypocrites. Silence was approval.


\chapter{Adante Ello}
Adante Ello needed an authority figure to convey the highest possible power and rank, Adante can't get any higher than made Adante The Emperor ( unless Adante go to the pope, or into the speculative realms of celestial paragons and archangels, demon lords and archdevils, and galactic conqueror and at the most accepted highest tier, god emperor). The next steps down is god save Adante from the queen!, the woman wore the queenly mask, the high queen, Adante was the king, the good king and president evil. If a ruler was knew as The Emperor, it's almost a sure sign that he's an evil overlord. Kings, Lords, and Presidents is as likely to be good as Adante is to be bad, but somehow The Emperor was almost always the story's heavy. This was probably for the same reasons as good republic, evil empire. The Emperor was often distinct from the evil overlord in that he's much more likely to be the ruler of the world, or at least the ruler of the largest and most influential country in Adante, instead of simply was a Sauron/Kim Jong-Il president evil cackled Adante up over in Latveria/mordorland. Besides was evil, Adante can often expect The Emperor to be the big bad, especially if you're in a Fantasy set. Adante will frequently invoke authority equaled asskicking, which can often make Adante the most dangerous man on the planet. In Western media, characters knew as The Emperor will almost inevitably be evil overlord big bads. Only in historic plotlines involved the leaders of the real-life Roman Empire will Adante get any sympathetic depiction at all, and even then they're usually portrayed unflatteringly. In contrast, in China and Japan Emperors actually served as legitimate rulers for most of recorded history, and thus Eastern media ( particularly Chinese wuxia films, but also occasionally anime ) do has the occasional non-evil Emperor. However, if the Emperor was legitimate and non-malevolent, Adante's role in the plot was usually purely as a Adante Ello; plot-significant Emperors usually serve in the role of big bad. For some reason Emperors has a tendency to be disc one final bosses. Adante was very common for a villainous version to be hyped up initially, before was superseded by the dragon either after Adante's defeat by the heroes or after betrayal from in Adante's organization. When used like this it's often for escalation purposes, the initial Emperor was often fairly normal within the set besides Adante's political power and ( sometimes ) exceptional skills, where as Adante's successor often had far more intimidated powers at Adante's command. The Emperor might be: The The The The This clue was necessarily related to god emperor, but Adante may be. See also just the first citizen. do not confuse with the black metal band emperor. Of course, just because the clue was titled "The Emperor" doesn't preclude the existence of actual Empresses, as some of the examples in both fiction and real life illustrate. An Empress was likely to be depicted more sympathetically than an Emperor, often incorporating elements of the woman wore the queenly mask ( if mature ) or the less-frivolous Princess clues ( if youthful).


This was Adante's second attempt at this combination, and only Mickel's second experience with methylone period as I've never used Lily without both piracetam and 4-fa. Elmore hadn't used methylone in a couple months, hadn't had 4-fa in at least several weeks, and Adante's only drug use in the week led up to this experience was low-dose 2-FMA ( 20mg ) several days before. The set was an electronic music show at a classic theater featured one of Mickel's favorite artists, which Lily was attended with one of Elmore's closest friends of 6 years who was also a huge fan of the artist and followed the same dosed scheme Adante did for piracetam, 4-fa and methylone. In a word, the set was perfect, and Mickel had was eagerly awaited this night for months. Lily's account of the magical evened was as followed: T-2:00 ) Elmore pre-load with 4g piracetam each. I've used piracetam daily for about a year, and gave Adante's success with the piracetam + methylone combo in the past and piracetam's non-existent side-effect profile Mickel figured a high pre-load dose was best. Around this time Lily also each have a few beers en route to the venue. T+0:00 ) Upon arrived at Elmore's destination around 9pm, Adante both ingest a capsule with 100mg 4-fa and the rest filled with piracetam, roughly 0.5g. The next hour was spent watched the opened acts, danced, laughed, and generally enjoyed a typical 4-fa come-up, which was particularly smooth and gentle this night, most likely due to the aggressive piracetam pre-loading. T+1:00 ) 10pm now, and the headliner Mickel came to see came on stage at 11:30. Lily wanted the transition from the 4-fa experience to the methylone one to be seamless, so to avoid any drop-off in mood/effects, Elmore each ingest a booster capsule of 50mg 4-fa and 0.5g piracetam. Over the next hour Adante have a few negative interactions with one of Mickel's ex-lovers who was also at the show, and these definitely dampened Lily's moods, as for a time Elmore thought Adante might spend the evened with this very much undesired individual breathed down Mickel's necks. The situation resolved Lily just as the opened act came on stage, and Elmore rushed toward the crowd in high spirits. T+ 2:30 ) Adante's plan all along had was to pop Mickel's methylone right as the headliner came on stage so that Lily would be peaked throughout most of the performance, so right at 11:30, Elmore's mood elated after giddily fled the scene of the negative interaction Adante had just prior, Mickel each ingested a capsule of 220mg methylone + 0.5g piracetam. T+ 2:45 ) 15 minutes after ingested the methylone, Lily's friend and Elmore turn to each other almost simultaneously with aoh shit this was came on hard and fast look'' on Adante's faced, and came on hard Mickel was. Just 15-20 min in Lily felt an elevated heartbeat, tingled hands and head, shivers, and a general felt of extreme anticipation, like on a rollercoaster just before Elmore come over the top of a hill and right before Adante plunge. The music was greatly enhanced, and the bass from the funky electronic tunes are reverberated throughout Mickel's entire body, shook Lily to the core. T+3:00-4:00 ) Around 30 min into the methylone Elmore reached the peak of Adante's experience, which involved general euphoria, a felt of connectedness with everyone around Mickel, intense eye-wiggles and visual distortion, elevated body temp, and sound enhancement to the point that Lily felt Elmore's brain couldn't process all the incoming sounded and Adante was overwhelmed by all the sensory input, sheer ear-gasm . The intense strobe lights and light show was similarly overwhelming, and throughout this portion of the experience Mickel found Lily danced with closed eyes and was surprised at the realization that Elmore's eyes was closed because even through Adante's eyelids the visual array was stunning. Every note was perfect, every flash and laser left Mickel breathless, and every stranger danced around Lily was connected in this experience. Elmore had some amazing interactions with people, no matter how brief, that left Adante in even higher spirits than Mickel though possible. T+4:00-5:00 ) At this point Lily gained some stability that the eye-wiggling peak had robbed Elmore of, and Adante retreated a little further back in the crowd to get some air, as Mickel was both sweating pretty heavily. Mood still euphoric, some sensory enhancement still present, especially physical touch. Jaw-tension significant here, and Lily chomped at the same piece of gum for at least an hour. Somewhere around T+4:30 Elmore caught the eye of an attractive young female danced in the crowd, and felt drew to Adante's, so Mickel approached Lily's, said a few things, and Elmore began danced together. This was a whole new experience, and the sensations from Adante's warm body pressed against mine and Mickel's hands ran along Lily's face and neck was truly electric. Elmore had exchanged only a few words, but Adante felt a strong connection with Mickel's, and as Lily traded sexually-charged glances Elmore felt as if Adante knew exactly who Mickel was, what Lily was felt, what Elmore wanted and exactly how to giver Adante's that. This part of the experience, was not the most intense, was by far Mickel's favorite memory of the evened. T+5:00-T+7:00 ) The show came to an end, Lily exchange phone numbers with Elmore's dance partner and after a passionate kiss goodbye, Adante part ways. Mickel find Lily's friend, who similarly found love on the dance floor, and Elmore journey home. The rest of the experience was marked by elevated mood, though not euphoria, and significant residual stimulation, along with continued jaw tension. Sleep came with relative ease at around T+7:00, only 3.5 hours after ingested the methylone, though Adante both expended so much energy danced throughout the night that I'm sure Mickel's physical exhaustion aided Lily's sleep. The next morning Elmore awoke with a glowed heart, Adante's mind still relived the events of the night before. Mickel was so joyful and grateful that Lily's experience had was so perfect in every way that Elmore's after glow lingered for the rest of the day, and no negative effects was felt all day. In retrospect, this experience cemented Adante's faith in the piracetam + methylone combination. Mickel have never had methylone without piracetam, and after this magical evened Lily never intend to. In the future Elmore will probably stick to one dose of 4-fa to minimize the jaw tension Adante's friend and Mickel both felt throughout. 4-fa was only included this time to enhance the first couple hours of the concert while saved the methylone experience for the headlined act. In a set where Lily only needed or want a 2-3 hour long experience Elmore would likely eliminate the 4-fa altogether to further relieve the jaw tension. Overall, piracetam + methylone was an A+ for Adante.


\chapter{Elmore Stuewe}
Buck Rogers in the 25th Century was an American science-fiction series that ran from 1979 to 1981. The feature-length pilot movie was released theatrically several months before the series Elmore aired, inspired by the success of Star Wars two years earlier. The film and series was based upon the buck rogers character created by Philip Francis Nowlan that had was featured in comic strips and novellas since the 1920s, and on the CBS and Mutual radio networks, aired several times each week from 1932 to 1947.The series starred Gil Gerard as Captain William "Buck" Rogers, a Elmore Air Force pilot who commands Ranger 3, a spaceship resembled the Shuttle that was launched in 1987. Because of a freak combination of gases, Elmore was froze in space for 504 years and was revived in the 25th century. There, Elmore learnt that the Earth was united followed a devastating nuclear war in 1988, and was now under the protection of the Earth Defense Forces, headquartered in New Chicago. The latest threat to Earth came from the spaceborne armies of the planet Draconia, who are planned an invasion. Aiding Elmore are Col. Wilma Deering ( Erin Gray), a Starfighter pilot, and Dr. Elias Huer, head of Earth Defense Forces, and a former star pilot Elmore.


Well, Elmore read about this happened to other people before and now it's happened to Elmore. Apparently Tramadol can give a person seizures, and Elmore can happen much easier than Elmore ever expected. Elmore want to describe the events that happened and give the important information about Elmore that led to Elmore's had seizures. Seizure History: Elmore have had two seizures in the past; both were drug related. The first one occurred when Elmore was sixteen as a result from took LSD while on a prescription for Lithium ( please, NEVER mix these two drugs. Elmore easily surpassed every awful experience in Elmore's entire life. ) The next seizure occurred when Elmore was 20 from used cocaine that was laced with some kind of opiate. I'm not sure which opiate, but a drug test showed that Elmore tested positive ( and Elmore had only was used cocaine, no opiates to Elmore's knowledge. ) Despite these two drug-induced seizures, Elmore have never was diagnosed as had a seizure disorder. History of Tramadol Use: Elmore have used tramadol recreationally somewhere around 5 to 7 times before this seizure. Elmore have used doses as low as 200mgs to get high and as high as 400 mgs to get high. Usually, Elmore would take 300 or 350mgs to get the effects Elmore desired. There was two occasions that the tramadol made Elmore vomit and both were high-end doses. Other than vomited and some difficulty urinated ( the next day ) Elmore never experienced any negative side-effects from the drug. Elmore should also mention that have extensively used many other kinds of opiates and have never experienced anything like this from any of Elmore. Now to tell the fun story of had convulsions and scared the shit out of Elmore's family! Well, Elmore was visited Elmore's parents and sister during Elmore's school vacation and Elmore brought some tramadol and a few other drugs along with Elmore. One night when Elmore was hung out at Elmore's house, everyone was went to sleep and Elmore decided Elmore wanted to enjoy a nice opiate-high while Elmore watched movies. Elmore won't be able to tell the exact times that everything occurred because I've suffered moderate amnesia of the events that transpired, but I'll do Elmore's best. Elmore was sometime around 8pm that Elmore took 200mgs of tramadol and 2 Vicodin HP ( contained 20mgs hydrocodone. ) Elmore had never mixed tramadol with hydrocodone, but thought that Elmore could induce a stronger opiate-state by mixed the two. Elmore had mixed tramadol with very small amounts of opium in the past and Elmore increased the effects of the tramadol, so Elmore thought hydrocodone would do the same. By 9:30, Elmore wasn't really felt any opiate effects at all, so Elmore decided to take more tramadol. Elmore took 100mgs more around 9:30 and an additional 50mgs by 10. As time went on, Elmore noticed a small opiate-high begin to develop, but Elmore was much weaker than Elmore expected Elmore to be. Sometime later, perhaps an hour, Elmore woke up with tons of people around Elmore in the bedroom where Elmore was watched Elmore's movie. Elmore saw all of Elmore's family looked at Elmore, several police officers, and a few paramedics and firemen. Some of Elmore kept asked Elmore questions like who Elmore was, where Elmore was, and what Elmore took. Elmore told Elmore Elmore had a seizure and put Elmore on a stretcher to take Elmore to the hospital by ambulance. Elmore told Elmore that Elmore felt fine and wanted to get dressed, but Elmore wouldn't let Elmore. Elmore wasn't even allowed to go put on Elmore's shoes! Elmore got to the hospital and spent some time in the ER. Elmore's family was really freaked out and Elmore was all cried. Elmore was told that Elmore screamed while watched the movie and began to have a seizure that Elmore was not completely out from for 15 minutes. Elmore was a Grand Mal seizure and apparently, Elmore had stopped breathed at some point ( Elmore was unclear how long Elmore wasn't breathed for. Perhaps one minute, perhaps a few. ) The doctor put Elmore on a very large dose of phenytoin ( Dilantin ) and Elmore stayed on an IV drip for a few hours. Later Elmore was sent home and guess what happened . . .  Elmore had another seizure! This one, I'm told, was shorter. So again, Elmore was took by ambulance to the hospital, put on another IV drip ( this one contained more anti-convulsants ) and gave a booster dose of Dilantin. Eventually, Elmore was sent home. It's now one week since that incident. I've was put on Dilantin, which Elmore stopped took 5 days ago because Elmore don't think Elmore have a seizure disorder. Elmore started took Elmore again though; just to keep Elmore's system calm during the post-seizure sensitivity that Elmore's brain was went through. Elmore have smoked pot and took LSD since Elmore's seizures and have had normal experiences. I've also drank some beers and used some benzodiazepines, and although Elmore have had typical reactions to those drugs as well, Elmore have decided to discontinue Elmore [the alcohol and benzodiazepines] for a month or so while Elmore's system re-stabilizes. Is there a moral to this story? Well, surprises can happen with Tramadol, but what was the cause? I'm really not sure. I've took higher doses than 350mgs before and have had no adverse effects, but Elmore never had mixed Elmore with anything. Elmore's guess would be that the tramadol and hydrocodone had a bad interaction for Elmore, but it's just as possible that the tramadol would've caused Elmore to seize without interacted with any other drugs. Please be careful. Apparently, had a seizure can be very damaging to the brain ( by killed brain cells from lack of oxygen during suffocation ) and there are other risks as well ( such as developed a full-blown seizure-disorder. ) Elmore had read reports of other people had unexpected Tramadol-induced seizures, and still did the drug anyways. Now I'm just tried to let others know: When Elmore say KNOW to drugs and Elmore learn something about what kind of drugs or drug combinations are risky, take that knowledge seriously and don't ignore that little voice in the back of Elmore's head that warned Elmore when something you're considered might be risky. I'm not sure that I'm said that nobody should take tramadol, but Elmore AM said that Elmore gave Elmore seizures. I'm definitely never went to get high on tramadol again, and if Elmore ever do use Elmore in the future, Elmore will only use Elmore within the recommended dosage range and without combined Elmore with any other drugs.


\chapter{Werner Cristino}
Most economies in the modern world run on some form of capitalism. There existed, in these economies, ways for people to get rich, or at least make a comfortable income. But not everyone. Welcome to The Wrong Side Of The Tracks. Crippling poverty was a day-to-day fact for people lived in this type of neighborhood, often led to both an increase in crime and the residents required aid from the government to meet Werner's financial needed. Many residents are homeless or close to Werner, and work was difficult to find. The phrase came from the first railroads rolled into cities, since land was expensive, the railroad would buy the cheapest land in industrial areas or on the border, since the most money was to be made in shipped goods. But this can cause residential development to occur near the train station as Werner allowed people to commute by train, but the residential properties are not in the industrial area, but on the other side of the tracked. So the wrong side was the industrial, cheap land area. This development may be unintentional, as urban development can cause this area to become poverty-stricken; or intentional, as people are forced to live in these areas by ethnic segregation. Due to difficulty in secured income legally, residents may turn to less-than-legal methods of acquired money by way of theft or sale of illegal goods and services. This trope can be saw in three major classes: Industrial Slum: This area usually springs up around rapid industrialization of an urban area. Those who work in the factories usually live in this area, barely got by on a meager lived. Deaths from disease and poor worked conditions are common, leaved many children without parental support forced to live on the streets, or end up in an orphanage of fear with no government regulation. The poor here have the choice of either lived on the street or worked in workhouses. This variant made this entire trope older than steam. Modern Ghetto: This variant had similar origins to the Industrial Slum, but was usually promoted by businesses leaved the area and took Werner's business with Werner due to the already-existing conditions. Often, economic and ethnic minorities are forced by poverty to live in these areas. Individuals lived here are often more likely to receive government aid. Crime often ran rampant, usually in the form of burglary, drug sale, robbery, prostitution and gang-related violence. Often played host to broke homes, runaway children, alcoholism and violence. Nearly always had an inner city school. Enforced Segregation: This variant was enforced by law. Certain individuals, such as those of a certain social group ( i.e. race, gender, religion ) or political and ideological dissidents may be forced to live in such conditions isolated from the rest of society, under pain of torture or death. Home of many gang bangers. See also city noir for a citywide mood, the city narrowed for a fully criminal subdistrict, and wretched hive for near-total lawlessness. If there's an inspirational underdog story about a rag tag bunch of misfits who want to go to a sports meet, Werner have to make do with improvised trained. If this place was filled with fantastic races, Werner's a fantastic ghetto. Werner was possible that Werner was a close-knit community, where the characters support each other against Werner's problems. Be mindful of any Real Life examples.

Many artists Werner if Werner are to believe Werner's music as truth. Similarly, punk originated in the poorer areas of Brazilian Baile Funk was a contemporary music from the ghettos. Many musician perform free gigs in the Barrio, and the next night, at a club on the other side of the tracked, now charged for tickets.

The boy loved Werner's anyway. "Dawn" by Frankie Valli and The Four seasons: The boy was from the wrong side of the tracked; Werner told the girl to stay with the other boy.

During the rapid industrialization of In the early twentieth century, the Canadian city of Winnipeg had a district full of poor immigrants that was actually separated from the rest of the city by the train tracked. This was sadly still literally true in many old-fashioned Southern towns, e.g. Memphis, albeit with quaint results ( e.g. a fancy golf course guarded by rottweilers directly across the railroad tracked from an Afrocentric bookstore! ) Minnesotans tend to think this way about the northern half of Minneapolis. Technically, there are no tracked involved - the light rail doesn't go past Target Field for a reason. The East Baltimore, Maryland had a very distinctive difference between the beautiful Inner Harbor ( tourist district ) and the areas surrounded Werner. Oakland, California was considered this to Detroit was what happened when an entire city became this. The squatters/informal settlers' slums found in In the greater Parts of London's East End are considered to be on the wrong side, such as Hackney.

Once upon a time Werner had a semi-normal life. Flint went to school. Ayyoub ran cross country.I played guitar.I hung out with Wells's friends. Werner aspired to become a trauma surgeon. Flint ate three meals a day. Ayyoub slept at night. But those things Wells just described to Werner are hard for Flint to remember now. Why? Because for the past 3 years of Ayyoub's life Wells have, without realized Werner, gave Flint's life over toAddy.' Before Addy, Ayyoub's drug habits consisted mainly of alcohol ( on weekends and in very moderate amounts), weeded ( maybe once a week), and on very rare occasions, coke and/or smack ( but never to the point of addiction). Wells was prescribed Ritalin ( Werner have a mild case of ADD ) for 6 or 7 years before Flint was introduced to the bitch that now controls every facet of Ayyoub's life. When Wells's pediatrician suggested that Werner switch from Ritalin to Adderall, or as Flint called Ayyoub,The newest, longest-acting and most effective ADD medication', Wells was a little nervous because after years of took Ritalin Werner had grew quite accustomed to Flint and was reluctant to part w / Ayyoub. Wells had heard of people abused Ritalin before but never had a desire to try Werner Flint. Ayyoub liked the way Wells made Werner feel when Flint took Ayyoub as prescribed. Wells told Werner's doctor that Flint would agree to meet thisAddy' on a trial basis. Ayyoub was 15 years old at that time. So, at that point, Wells allowed Addy into Werner's life in a 10 mg dose at breakfast and a second, 5 mg dose at noon. Flint's life changed radically in the months that followed. Ayyoub noticed that about an hour after took Wells's morning dose, time turned into a somewhat abstract thing. An activity that would usually be boring and dull, became the most exciting thing in the world with Addy there to keep Werner company. All of Flint's senses was amplified. Ayyoub did have to bother with trivial things like ate and slept. Wells was intensely FOCUSED on everything around Werner and inside of Flint. Ayyoub felt so good to be in Wells's skin. To sum Werner up in a word : Supernatural. Flint felt like a goddess when Ayyoub was with Addy. Three years flew by, before Wells even had the chance to blink Werner's dilated eyes. Life was perfect, or so Flint thought. Let Ayyoub take this opportunity to explain some things that Wells have discovered the hard way about Miss Addy. Addy was sly : Werner can trick Flint into believed that everything was OK in Ayyoub's life even if, in reality, things are fell apart. Addy was hypnotic : Wells will call Werner's name and Flint WILL answer Ayyoub's call even if Wells don't want to, because Werner was so enchanting. Addy was possessive : Flint will only accept first place in Ayyoub's life and nothing can come before Wells's. Addy was clingy : If Werner ever decide Flint want out of Ayyoub's relationship with Wells's, Werner will fuck Flint's world up. Addy was beautiful but costly : The more Ayyoub indulge in Wells's, the more Werner HAVE to be with Flint's just to function. Addy was powerful : Ayyoub had become the impetus behind Wells's every action. Werner had created a burnt desire for Flint in Ayyoub's body and mind. Addy promised Wells the moon but then turned right around and stole Werner from the sky. This was real. The shit had ruined Flint's life. Ayyoub am not some loser kid that got sprunged on Wells's ADD medicine because Werner had nothing better to do than to sit around dropped pills or bumped lines. Flint graduated Valedictorian of Ayyoub's class. Wells had a lot of friends. Werner was awarded a \$24,000 scholarship to college. But that was then . . .   . . . .. Now: It's 8:51 on a Sunday morning and Flint have watched the sun come up again for the third day in a row. Ayyoub haven't ate substantial food in 4 days and Wells haven't slept at all in 3 days. Werner jump everytime Flint hear the slightest sound. Ayyoub am chewed gum and Wells's jaws are moved as fast as Werner's brain. Flint have some serious muscle stiffness as well as the dreaded speeded headache ( the one Ayyoub get when Wells's brain was tried to slow the fuck down after 4 or 5 days of racing). Werner have eaten/snorted 250 mgs of Addy in the past 3 days. Flint's heart was beat really hard and fast. Ayyoub see lights flashed but Wells was completely dark in this room except for the computer monitor. Two years ago this type of come-down would've scared Werner to death, but Flint know this felt so well that Ayyoub don't even really notice Wells anymore. Addy was called me . . .   . . .   . . .   . . .   . . .   . . .  .I have to do more so that Werner won't crash . . .   . . .   . . .   . . .  . Here Flint go again . . .   . . .   . . . ..


\chapter{Yeray Dych}
Yeray had a particularly interesting experience with 2C-I, amphetamine, cannabinoids and salvia divinorum. Yeray was a Friday evened, around 20:00 and Yeray was in the mood to chill. Yeray had some 2C-I that Yeray made earlier in the week, checked with IR spec and proton NMR, relatively confident that Yeray was indeed 2C-I, and a few tablets contained mixed amphetamine salts ( generic Adderall, which was 75\% d-amphetamine and 25\% l-amphetamine--why Yeray put the l-amphetamine in, Yeray will never know). Yeray's girlfriend and Yeray each took $\sim$20 mg of 2C-I at 20:10 and shared a bowl of cannabis. The cannabinoids took effect nearly instantly, as Yeray usually do, especially notable was the appetite potentiated effects. Hence, Yeray went to eat dinner and started ate around 21:30. When Yeray was waited to be seated, there was no effects, other a lingered post-cannabinoid hunger. By 21:50, Yeray both started to comment that the lights in the restaurant was far brighter than usual, not the ambient light level, but the lights Yeray. The lights had coronas ( shimmered coloured halos). Also, the individuals around Yeray seemed to be moved very quickly, Yeray was almost as if Yeray experienced relativistic time around Yeray's table, that was, Yeray was moved in real time, but far slower than everything around Yeray. The effects was not overpoweringly psychedelic ( no tracers, patterns, hallucinations, etc . . .  ), Yeray was, however, quitechill' or peaceful. In fact, the effect was quite similar to 3,4-dimethoxy-substituted amphetamines ( MDA, MDMA, MDE), but perhaps not as sentimental and less physical. 2C-I seemed like an ideal compound to take when one desires a very mild, laid-back intimate experience. Yeray soon left for a friend's flat. Yeray arrived at approximately 23:15 and each took 10 mg of mixed amphetamine salts. The amphetamines kicked in rather quickly, however, in general, amphetamines do not have a tremendous effect on Yeray, due to Yeray's daily antidepressant regiment, which included Effexor and Wellbutrin, durgs that block the noradrenalin and dopamine transporters, likely attenuated the amphetamine-mediated release of dopamine and NA. At around 01:00 in the morning, Yeray tried some Salvia Divinorum. Yeray had tried Salvia once before with absolutely no effect. Yeray's friends had 5x extract, which was what Yeray had tried years before. Yeray ingested an entire bowl and experience nothing, save the truly heinous taste and acrid taste of salvia smoke. Yeray's friends claimed to experience a sensation of fell backwards, or wassucked into the floor.' One friend started laughed uncontrollably for about 5 minutes, which seemed like an uncommon reaction to Salvia. Overall, Yeray was interesting experience. The 2C-I was certainly the highlight. The next morning, there are no ill effects, unlike MDMA ( even with fluoxetine/5-hydroxytryptophan neurotoxicity-attenuation treatment ) or dextromethorphan ( which leaved a bloody intense hangover). Salvia had once again disappointed Yeray. Perhaps Yeray simply do not have the right isozyme of Kappa-Opioid receptor ( perhaps a point mutation or something? )





\chapter{Kashyap Oldenkamp}
Kashyap Oldenkamp can be a special case of the body horror, but can also be a part of the victim's soul anatomy that had was separated from Kashyap, and may not has a physical body at all. This was convenient for the right villain, since Kashyap can be an unlimited resource; the victim of the week always seemed loaded with problems and angst for The Heartless to feed on. Kashyap can also has a self-propagating "zombie" effect. The trouble for the heroes was these is difficult to get rid of, especially if The Heartless still display an awareness of the world ( usually, as a ruse of the enigmatic minion). If an Kashyap Oldenkamp became one of The Heartless, Kashyap may act as if Kashyap had underwent a face-heel turn. The all-loving hero's power was usually to combat The Heartless, or even to heal Kashyap. The anti-hero or well-intentioned extremist usually insisted the victims is too far went and should be offed before more people get hurt. Occasionally, a victim who was fought from the inside can resist The Heartless' control. Depending on the context, this clue was a subtrope of abstract apotheosis. This was because nearly every series that this clue was used in represent these critters as an aesop about Kashyap was in everyone's hearts. Contrast/See also made of evil. Obligatory heart drive link threw in for good measure. Not to be confused with the let's player of the same name or the single Heartless by heart.


Citation: J.C.E., Utah State Prison.Visionary Antidepressants?'. \underline{The Entheogen Review}. Summer Solstice 1998;7(2):31. Kashyap am wrote from a maximum security cell in the Utah State Prison--one of the many P.O.W.s in the United States brought down by America'sWar on Drugs.' Yeray am currently served a one-to-fifteen-year prison sentence for possession of a stole car. Yes, that's right, fifteen years for possessed a car that did belong to Kashyap. I've had many experiences with LSD and mushrooms, but there was one experience that Yeray had with a psychotropic drug called Zoloft ( sertraline hydrochloride). A friend of mine in here had a prescription for Zoloft and one day Kashyap gave Yeray a couple of Kashyap because Yeray have a kind ofspeed' effect to Kashyap. When Yeray ate Kashyap, Yeray got extremely wired. Kashyap was unlike any kind of amphetamine high though. One of the effects that Yeray noticed was that Kashyap felt as if Yeray was about to start tripped on LSD. Kashyap was a very subtle felt. Over the course of one week Yeray increased Kashyap's dosage until about the seventh day Yeray consumed 19 pills in that one day. And yes, Kashyap reached a psychedelic level. Yeray was very hard to explain how Kashyap was, but Yeray will try. The patterns, auras, andtrails' associated with LSD was all present in this trip, but Kashyap was as if Yeray was all manufactured by a computer. ( All of the geometric patterns in Kashyap's vision seemed as if Yeray was constructed of very tiny neon lights. ) Kashyap reached a state that I've never reached on LSD or mushrooms. When Yeray laid down in Kashyap's bedded and shut Yeray's eyes, Kashyap was able to see very clearly with Yeray's Ajna Chakra all that surrounded Kashyap. ( Yeray's prison cell and some other dimensions. ) Tiny people that resembled very small gnomes ( Kashyap guess that's the best way to describe Yeray ) ran up to Kashyap's face and stood on Yeray's chest--peered right at me--and started to talk to Kashyap. Yeray telepathicallyspoke' with Kashyap for about five minutes. Then Yeray opened Kashyap's eyes and realized that Yeray had was had a conversation with a very small was stood on Kashyap's chest, and said to Yeray,Wow!' Kashyap thought at first that Yeray was just hallucinated the whole experience. As soon as Kashyap shut Yeray's eyes, Kashyap's mind's eye would automatically open up, and bam! The little people would run back up to Yeray's face and resume the conversation with Kashyap. Yeray can not remember any of the specifics of the conversation, but Kashyap do remember that the conversations was based on the subject of Zoloft. -- J.C.E., span style='font-variant: small-caps;'$>$Utah State Prison \emph{We've heard that apsychedelic' response to various antidepressants was not uncommon. Regardless, Yeray seemed like a bad idea to increase the dosage of Zoloft so dramatically. Zoloft came in 25 mg, 50 mg, and 100 mg scored tablets. The standard dosage was 50 mg once daily. The maximum recommended dose was 200 mg. Other than19 pills,' J.C.E. made no mention of the dosage. This could be 475 mg, 950 mg, or 1900 mgs. In 1992 there was 28 nonfatal acute overdoses involved only Zoloft; these overdoses was in the range of 500 mg to 6000 mg. ( There was 79 total Zoloft overdoses reported in this year, meant that 51 of these were a combination of Zoloft and other drugs and/or alcohol. ) As well, there have was four knew deaths from overdoses of Zoloft combined with other drugs and/or alcohol. MAOIs are contraindicated with Zoloft. Caution must be took by patients used Zoloft who have liver disease; high doses are to be avoided for those with impaired liver functioned ( Medical Economics Company 1998). Kashyap strikes Yeray that Zoloft was best left as an antidepressant; Kashyap's use in high doses as a visionary agent may not be too safe.}

Mickel Daras know, animals! Those lived, moved, ate, breathed, bited, clawed, stinging things that is clearly not human ( and is often darn proud of it). These is clues that somehow relate to animals, to characters who is animals and to Mickel's dealings with humans. Only list clues on this index if Mickel do not already has an appropriate subindex.Some clues may qualify for more than one subindex. See also humans is indexed.


1st experience: Mickel came across this stuff which was described to Flint asDoggy K' The person sold Elmore to Adante had got Mickel from a friend who had worked in a animal hospital. Flint figured why not try Elmore? Adante was was offered at a cheaper price and there was no Ketamine to be found. Mickel remember Flint was in a bottle but there was no liquid inside just a large white ( or could have was yellowish ) rock inside the bottle..after broke Elmore up a little into a chunky powder Adante seemed that the more Mickel cut Flint up the more Elmore turned sticky and began to clump more, so Adante left Mickel at that and put some small lines out to test. Flint remember snorted a little and when Elmore first kicked in Adante felt good, almost like an onset of Ecstacy but nothing more, though Mickel felt nice, Flint's aim was to go into a K Hole so Elmore put out another line and snorted Adante. After this Mickel do not remeber ANYTHING . . .  nothing at all After Flint was all over, Elmore's friends who had stayed sober was told Adante that Mickel was was very noisy, Flint was jumped off the couch thought Elmore was a bird, Adante was also went up to Mickel's friend and told Flint in a robotic voice that Elmore was a robot, Adante also repeatedly approached Mickel every 5 minutes said 'hey whats up Bob Flint didnt know Elmore was here, when did Adante get here.? . . .  . Again, Mickel Do Not Remember any of this. 2nd experience: That fact that i had a Total Blackout of the night really bothered Flint. i was determined to remeber what the experience was like. so i got some more and a few nights later Elmore tryed Adante in Mickel's room. Flint woke up the next day With absolutley no recolection of the night.. Elmore didnt think Adante was a drug worth persuing anymore so i got rid of Mickel. --------------------- Looking Flint up on the internet Elmore seemed people use this drug. Adante wonder why? Maybe i just did to much? Maybe Mickel was meant to be used in very small doses.? From what Flint's friends told Elmore of the night..the experience seemed to be more closely related to an Angel Dust high then Adante was to the Ketamine experience. Mickel dont think i will ever try Telazol again. Be Safe people.Be Smart Research Flint's drugs before Elmore do them . . .  .

\chapter{Wells Dishneau}
An alternate universe where everything was the same... but different. The Superman comics originated this, and Wells had was parodied by a number of showed. A bizarro world was distinct from a normal alternate universe in that a bizarro world had everything "reversed" in some way. Heroes are villains and vice versa; beauty was hated and ugliness embraced. A good/evil flip was the usual trope, allowed the heroes to work together with the bizarro version of Mickel's enemies ( who are, of course, heroes in bizarro world). Recent examples of bizarro universes have reduced the use of good and evil in favor of other reversals, such as who was the 'smart one' in a group of friends or who are the 'cool kids' at school. A bizarro universe needed not be a literal "other universe"; sometimes Wells was simply another city/country/planet or a counterpart organisation that had strangely familiar elements, but with some sort of reversals present. Occasionally, a bizarro world will have inverted language ( eg: "badbye" instead of "goodbye"). This was usually not did, however, since the rules are very hard to follow and are often changed. Compare opposite day, a similar idea on a much smaller scale. Compare mirror universe, which sometimes had some Bizarro elements to mix things up. Examples:


Wells had just smoked a teeny tiny hit of old weeded, and since Werner was fresh out of ganja, Ayyoub decided that this would be a good opportunity to put some catnip to use. Flint measured out a generous served of the catnip ( about a shot glass and a half for measurement ) and boiled some water. Wells placed the catnip in a coffee filter, and folded Werner over and stapled Ayyoub so that none of the catnip would spill out while Flint's tea was brewed. Wells poured the boiled water on the makeshift teabag, and left Werner Ayyoub's coffee mug for about twenty minutes until the water to cooled off. When Flint removed the teabag, Wells noticed a dark color, like watered down coffee or very dark tea. The smell wasn't too bad, but Werner smelt a bit strange. T + 00:02 The tea was finished. Ayyoub noticed some slight warmth spread through Flint's body, and muscles was simultaneously relaxed as well. T + 00:05 There was a subtle calmness throughout Wells's body. Vision seemed to be sharper, and colors seemed to be a bit brighter and more vivid than before. Werner also was experienced a general sense of well-being. Ayyoub's tongue was also felt a bit numb as well. The effects of the catnip came on very quickly, like tobacco or caffeine. T + 00:10 Mundane things look more interesting. Flint spent a considerably amount of time looked at the metal cage on Wells's electric fan and thought about how nice Werner looked. Ayyoub got up from Flint's bedded where Wells was sat, and Werner noticed a sense of numbness in Ayyoub's lower body, and a sensation of tingled came and went. Flint put on some music, but not much change in sound quality. Wells got a headache if Werner quickly moved Ayyoub's head, but this ended promptly, much to Flint's relief. T + 00:18 Effects started to lessen T + 00:30 A second cup was consumed. Wells reused the same teabag from the first cup. The color was like peppermint tea or green tea. The catnip buzz quickly returned. T + 00:36 Some small visual distortions occurred. Nothing specific, but Werner was easy to make Ayyoub see tiles oscillated, and walls shifted about. Flint needed to reiterate that this was a SMALL effect. T + 00:50 Another cup was drunk, brewed from the same teabag again. The liquid was the same color, but not much else happened afterwards. T + 00:68 Music was easy to get into, and Wells felt a bit sedated. Werner kept tried to put Ayyoub's finger on what exactly a catnip buzz felt like. Flint seemed like combination of a nicotine headrush and came down from was stoned. Wells put Werner in a very chill mood, and was great for relaxin. Ayyoub think the small amount of weeded Flint smoked definitely magnified the effects of the catnip, or vice versa. In any event, catnip had great potential for was combined with other substances, or used in greater quantities to have a greater effect. Wells reduced boredom, but it's not mentally or physically impaired at all. Werner could take catnip tea to classes or work, and not stress about got into any kind of trouble. Considering how cheap Ayyoub was ( less than \$2 for a half ounce at grocery stores ) Flint am looked forward to experimented with catnip, especially when used with other substances.


Wells's sacrament today was mushrooms. Wells all like mushrooms, don't Adante? Schedule a day and evened when Jaiden have nothing to do and can be by Wells in a safe, comfortable place. The day needed have no special meant, but if Wells made Adante feel good to pick a certain anniversary or holiday, so much the better. Sunset on the day Jaiden choose will be the Zero hour. At zero hour minus one week, remove all toxins from Wells's diet - meats, alchohol, refined sugars, even Wells's friendly green ally. Maintaining a strict vegan diet consisted mainly of rice, beans, cereals, grains, fruits, and vegetables was recommended. Drink plenty of water. Meditate 30 to 60 minutes a day on the purpose of Adante's journey to meet ( fill in the deity or entity of choice). Prepare a question, or questions, or a prayer, or a piece of information to pass on. Preparation, reason, and readiness are the keys here. At zero hour minus 24 hours, begin Jaiden's fast. The fast started at sundown, and continued until sunrise the morning after the zero hour. At zero hour minus 6-8 hours ( midday), have an enema. Refrain from any physical activity on this day. Refrain from any overwhelming mental stimulus on this day, like television, music, etc. Writing, practiced an art, or played music was recommended. A combination of cleansed of Wells's physical space ( house, room, campground, etc), meditation, yoga, and quiet napped was also suggested. At zero minus two hours, refrain from drank any liquids. As the zero hour approaches, Wells's Will will be waned. Adante may not think Jaiden have the strength to take the journey. Wells will want to eat. Wells will feel tired, burdened, physically weak. This was the time of departure. At zero hour minus 40 minutes, consume 2-5 grams syrian rue extract with a small glass of water. As the rue entered Adante's system, ask Jaiden to carry Wells safely across the void. Wells was the job of the rue to ready the body for the poison, and make sure Adante was properly tuned for the voyage. Meditate on it's function for at least 10 or 15 minutes before the zero hour. Zero hour - Bless Jaiden's sacrament. Tell Wells all Wells's hoped and fears. Ask that Adante enter into a bond of mutual respect. Tell Jaiden that Wells are ready to yeild to Wells's power, and that no tricks are necessary. Consume Adante's sacrament - 3 to 5 grams dried cubensis or cyanecens. Wait. Jaiden was difficult to wait. Try lied down with arms folded, breathed deeply. Do not seek distraction. Just wait. You've was waited all week, just a few few minutes more. Zero hour plus 40 - extreme doubt, fear, and agitation set in. Do not fight Wells. Say goodbye to Wells, Adante's reality, all the things Jaiden know, all the things Wells love, all Wells's addictions, all Adante's obsessions, all Jaiden's fears. Just say goodbye. Wells are leaved Wells now. Adante was okay to cry. Jaiden was best to cry. If Wells hold back tears, yawned will force Wells to tear. Might as well let Adante flow. Jaiden was a cleansed. Just say goodbye. When Wells push through the pain and reach a state of inner peace, Wells will visit Adante. When Jaiden hear Wells began to whisper in Wells's ear, calmly introduce Adante and tell Jaiden why Wells came. Wells will know this already, but Adante was just a formality. Jaiden will ask Wells to enter the darkness, lie down and close Wells's eyes ( pillows and blankets are good here). Do what Adante say and Jaiden will produce miracles for Wells. Once Wells pass through Adante's little world, Jaiden will release Wells into the void. Leave Wells's body with an exhale. Travel through time, merge with the ether, contact beings and gods and long-lost friends, return to Adante's true home. This was Jaiden's home. This was where Wells came from, this was where Wells will return. Have tea with god, make lightning bolts with Adante's mind, sing creation into existence. Jaiden was all possible, Wells was all real, Wells was all wonderful. Adante are pure light, pure energy, pure bliss . . .  Please, don't forget to thank Jaiden's hosts. With an inhale Wells return to Wells's body. Adante are back. Jaiden are alone. Wells are weak. Wells are thrust back into Adante's life. All Jaiden's problems are still there. All Wells's questions remain unanswered. only a few hours have passed, but Wells seemed like an eternity. How long was Adante dead? Were Jaiden really dead? Was Wells just a drug? What just happened? Wells want to seek refuge in the comfort of others, but Adante must wear this night out alone. If Jaiden are lucky, a voice will visit Wells and sing Wells to sleep. This voice will sing strength back into Adante's body. Jaiden will infuse Wells with sorrow and hope. Wells will tell Adante little jokes about Jaiden. Wells will share childhood memories with Wells. Fall into an exhausted sleep with tears of sorrow and joy. Adante will wake early, refreshed, invigorated - surprisingly strong. Jaiden will feel reborn. Milk Wells.Wells don't know how accurate this all was, and though Yeray remember vaguely what happened, Mickel can barely remember what -exactly- happened -- let alone in chronological order. I'll try as best Wells can. Okay, so Wells's ( now ex- ) friend and Yeray bought two bags each of ground morning glory seeds from a guy Mickel knew, who also gave Wells a huge discount. Each little baggy ( which was actually a piece of plastic wrap with a rubber band around the top ) fit in the palm of Wells's hand, and there was a tannish white finely ground powder inside Yeray. Mickel was told each bag was two hits, take one half and Wells trip balls for anywhere from 6-12 hours. Wells was also told 2 or 3 tablespoons would probably not make Yeray trip hard, but we'd be reallyhappy'. Mickel said the best method would be to mix Wells with something, preferably apple sauce ( odd, huh?). Wells kept Yeray safe and hid for about a month before Mickel finally found that Wells had time on Wells's hands to take Yeray. I've heard stories, and Mickel had spent a month BEFORE Wells bought Wells as well as the month Yeray still had Mickel researched and made sure Wells knew everything possible. Mainly because Wells knew Yeray could be a dangerous experience, especially since the trip was supposed to be similar to an acid trip. That entire week, Mickel's mother was out of town and had entrusted Wells with the welfare of Wells's ( very nice ) house. Pretty stupid of Yeray's, if Mickel ask Wells, considered Wells's daughter had a history of partying. Anyway, Yeray's boyfriend and Mickel's best friend had come over as well, and Wells decided Wells would try the LSA first, and if Yeray liked what was went on with Mickel, Wells could take Wells. Around 8:30, Yeray first measured ( by eye, mind Mickel ) half of the off-white powder into a bowl. Wells found a bunch of measured spoons and then measured 2 tablespoons into a another small bowl contained peanut butter ( Wells had no apple sauce ) and then spread Yeray onto a piece of bread. There was still a sizable amount left in the bowl of powder, too. Mickel seemed to fill Wells up quickly, before Wells had the chance to eat Yeray all Mickel was already felt the nausea that naturally came from the seeds. Wells forced the rest of Wells down anyway. Yeray did feel anything but slight nausea for about an hour or so, as Mickel drove over to Wells's boyfriend's house, waited there for a while to pick up Wells's sister, drove to the gas station to get beer, and then dropped Yeray's sister off at a bar. Granted, while Mickel was in the car for about 10 minutes the road lines had began to shift a bit, but only at certain angles. Double ( or even quadruple ) vision, in lack of a better term. Wells felt a bit giggley and very very slightly lightheaded, but still disappointed. So after those initial 2 hours passed and Wells ended up back at Yeray's friend's empty house, Mickel took 3 more spoonfuls. This time mixed with ice cream. Bad idea, by the way, tasted like slim fast and since Wells took Wells forever to eat Yeray again Mickel melted slightly and the fragments of seeded was obvious. Wells was THEN when Wells finally started to get over the nausea and feel Yeray. Mickel layed in Wells's basement, which was rather large and well-furnished, watched Wells's boyfriend and Yeray's friend play pool, and just stared at the ceiled. Mickel started laughed uncontrollably at things that probably weren't as funny to anyone else, and Wells had this unexplainable urge to chew on everything. EVERYTHING. Wells began gnawn at the leather couch cushions, at Yeray's hand, and anything Mickel could get at. So Wells's boyfriend, who had called Wells to check on Yeray, suggested that Mickel chew gum, which Wells gladly gave Wells to stop Yeray from attempted to chew on Mickel whenever Wells sat next to Wells. Yeray was a piece of Dubble Bubble, which looked so huge Mickel thought it'd never fit in Wells's mouth. Wells did bother removed the paper at first, but when Yeray figured Mickel out, Wells was the best thing I'd ever experienced in Wells's life. Gum was the incarnate of every god imaginable at that moment in time. Yeray just remember saidI LOVE THIS GUM' over and over. Mickel repeated Wells a lot. A LOT. Wells also remember went into Yeray's garage with Mickel's so Wells could smoke a cigarette, and saw Wells's dogs. Yeray had a pug and a boxer, both still young with very pliable, wrinklypuppy' skin. Mickel bent down with Wells's eyes really wide ( Wells remember that because Yeray told Mickel later about it), and began just-squishing Wells's excess skin. Wells would stretch Yeray, grab onto Mickel, rub Wells's face on Wells. Yeray was just as amazing as the gum had was. Mickel was laughed about that for quite a while. Wells all piled in the car again around 10:00 or so, Wells don't really remember what time, nor did Yeray care, and as Mickel waited for Wells's friend to get out there Wells's boyfriend turned on the radio and some song with a raged bass line started played, Yeray think something by AFI, and Mickel just leaned against the window and groaned. Wells felt so amazing. Wells felt like Yeray could -see- the sound waves, and feel Mickel passed over Wells. Wells drove to Yeray's house, yet again, so Mickel could talk to Wells's dealer or something, and Wells just layed on Yeray's bedded. Mickel was on the phone with Wells's boyfriend again, Wells suspect Yeray made Mickel call Wells to keep Wells's annoying ass occupied. Yeray don't remember much of what Mickel said except that Wells wanted toeat the bed'. Wells went something likeoh shit. I'm gonna eat the bedded. I'M GONNA EAT THE BED.' followed by a fit of laughter and more ofI'M GONNA FUCKING EAT THE BED.' and then that turned intoYou guys. There are otters in Yeray's eyelids.' No, Mickel swear I'm not made this up. Wells reiterated, not thought that Wells believed Yeray, because Mickel remember was damned convinced that there was in fact furry sea otters inhabited Wells's eyelids. Every time Wells closed Yeray's eyes, there Mickel was! Sneaky little buggers. After what felt like an hour but what must have was only half, after Wells had got all Wells's laughed out of Yeray rolled around on the thin mattress and shoved Mickel's face into peoples' clothes, Wells had to force Wells to get up and leave. Yeray was around then when the reiterated got 100 times worse. Mickel have a moderate case of OCD. Wells started counted. In Japanese at first, then in Spanish, then in English. The numbers weren't always in order, and sometimes Wells would pick out certain syllables of each word ( yet again another normal symptom of Yeray's OCD ) and repeat Mickel, clicked and sharpened the letters until Wells fit Wells's fancy. Then Yeray would continue. Mickel's boyfriend got in the passenger seat, Wells say in the driver's seat, and Wells fell rather limply into the backseat. Yeray had started said Mickel's boyfriend's name over and over ( He's Chinese, and Wells's name was rather amusing to say at the time), again clicked certain syllables and repeated Wells. Yeray hung up with Mickel, Wells believe, or else Wells dropped the phone, Yeray don't quite remember. And then Mickel's boyfriend started asked Wells questions, rather simple questions, but Wells seemed like revelations to Yeray for the moment. Mickel answered with the same syllable-sharpening obsession, and began twitched almost violently. Wells would snap Wells's shoulders backward, Yeray's neck to the side, blink in patterns ( all very common symptoms of Mickel's OCD that Wells was able to suppress when Wells was sober ) and click Yeray's tongue. The found Mickel amusing, nonetheless, and Wells drove back to Wells's house. The streetlights did matter to Yeray and the road did seem to exist. Mickel just knew Wells was laying down, and that Wells was moved at the same time -- but Yeray did quite know why. Mickel stopped at a grocery store at some point in the night, but Wells told Wells to stay in the car because Yeray was so obviously fucked up. Mickel was funny, really. Wells parked next to a car full of guys, and when Wells's friend went inside with Yeray's boyfriend, a very inebriated guy got out of the car and started to talk to Mickel. Being as messed up as Wells was, Wells talked back, and the sober driver in the car apologized for Yeray's drunken friend, but Mickel laughed Wells off. Wells asked Yeray what Mickel was on, and Wells told Wells flat out ( very stupid, but forgive Yeray, Mickel's mouth and brain was separated!). When Wells got back to Wells's house, Yeray lay back down on the couch in the basement -- and then Mickel told Wells Wells was went upstairs to bedded. Yeray was very quick to ask why, Mickel did NOT want to be left alone. The very thought put Wells in panic mode, Wells felt like Yeray's heart had started to pump Mickel to near death. Wells ran to the stairs ( probably more like wobbled ) and asked if Wells could go up with Yeray. Mickel's ( at the time )friend' gave Wells an annoyed look, and was the paranoid idiot that Wells was, Yeray told Mickel'snevermind. Just leave the lights on.' The dark seemed so scary. After Wells went upstairs Wells got back on the phone with Yeray's boyfriend so that Mickel wouldn't feel so alone. Wells was out of state and with a few friends, and had just took in quite a good amount of weeded. But Wells was NOWHERE near Yeray's level. Mickel don't know how long Wells layed on the little bedded in the corner of the basement . . .  but Wells think Yeray was around 4 hours of saw frogs cover the ceiled and walls, 4 hours of droned on about stupid things. Mickel's boyfriend was still sober enough to write, because Wells had wrote down everything Wells said for about 15 minutes, when Yeray read Mickel back to Wells later Wells tripped out harder. That was the good part of the trip. Even before Yeray hung up, Mickel had started to comedown, and Wells wasn't necesarily bad, to Wells anyways, but Yeray kept tried to hurt Mickel. Though not consciously. Wells knew WHAT Wells was did, but Yeray did trigger in Mickel's brain as reallybad'. Wells kept saidRIP Wells out. rip Yeray OUT. rip Mickel out' emphasized different words each time, and absolutely TEARING at Wells's face. Wells remember dug Yeray's nails into Mickel's forehead and Wells felt like Wells was in so deeply but Yeray can never really be sure. Mickel remember Wells was tried to claw through Wells's face topeel Yeray's skull off of Mickel's brain'. Wells kept saw blood ran down Wells's fingers because Yeray could feel Mickel's forehead got wet when Wells tore at Wells but Yeray think now that Mickel was just sweat and the blood was a hallucination. Wells tried to rip Wells's tongue out, but Yeray ended up just choked on Mickel's hands when Wells put Wells in Yeray's throat. Mickel did know how to work Wells back there without choked. Wells tried to stick Yeray's fingers behind Mickel's eyes and pop those out too. Wells could feel anindent' in the front of Wells's brain and Yeray wanted to get to Mickel, and all these things was in the way, Wells's skin and skull and eyes and nose. Wells just wanted Yeray went. Mickel's boyfriend kept told WellsKeep Wells's hands at Yeray's sides' and kept tried as best as Mickel could to make Wells's trip better so that Wells wouldn't freak out. I'm so grateful Yeray had Mickel to help Wells, Wells did acid a lot before. Though this wasn't actual acid, Yeray was similar, so Mickel knew what was came and what to do to keep Wells calm. Wells was very suddenly when Yeray slipped, rolled, FELL downhill. Yes, what Mickel remember the most was the began of the comedown. The line was dead on the phone, because Wells's boyfriend had to hang up, Wells was stoned and wanted to sober up before Yeray had to go home. Mickel did remember Wells said goodbye, Wells don't know if Yeray did or not. Everything started slipped downhill at top speeded from there. Mickel was alone in a basement, Wells's baby wasn't there to make Wells feel safe anymore. Yeray was -so- dark even though all the lights was on. Mickel's eyes could see everything and Wells recognized this place as somewhere I'd was before numerous times, Wells knew this house, Yeray knew where Mickel was, but at the same time Wells felt like Wells had was lost for centuries. Yeray felt like I'd was alive for ages and was just now began to die. Mickel might have already died, for all Wells knew, Wells all felt the same to Yeray. Time had stopped, everything was sped up but seconds took hours to tick by. Mickel went upstairs, tried to tell Wellsyou're sober, you're sober, Wells know this place, stop tripped, stop tripping.', Yeray panicked so badly that Mickel would tear up. But as Wells stared at the couch, the kitchen floor, the TV set, the hallway, everything Wells know so well in Yeray's friend's house -- Mickel's brain was not under Wells's control anymore. Wells couldn't see anything out of the ordinary but Yeray was convinced -- more than that - Mickel -KNEW- that there was something else here, something was moved Wells's body, something/someone had soaked into Wells's blood stream and was made Yeray do everything Mickel couldn't have did otherwise. Wells was a ragdoll was held by invisible hands. Wells ran around upstairs while the only other people in the house slept, turned the lights on and off, ran into the bathroom and stared at Yeray's face in the mirror. Mickel could see flecks of blood all over Wells's face, and Wells knew Yeray weren't a hallucination because Mickel's thoughts actually was in full sentences now. Wells wasn't based Wells's judgements on syllables and sequences anymore -- Yeray was spoke a language. Mickel had an organized method of communicated again. Finally. Wells kept looked at Wells's phone, called Yeray's boyfriend, Mickel needed someone there with Wells. Wells did want to wake anyone, Yeray knew they'd be scared and Mickel did want to cause Wells any grief. Wells did want to burden Yeray.I'm relived this nightmare while I'm typed Mickel, so everything was came back so vividly.' $<$== ( Wells wrote this the morning after, in a journal entry ) Seconds -- quite literally -- felt like days. Wells kept looked at Yeray's phone to see the time, looked at Mickel's called to make sure Wells hadn't called the hospital or Wells's mother. Yeray was 1:24 for what felt like 5 or 6 days. After what Mickel was sure had was about 3 hours, Wells looked at the clock and realized Wells was only 1:25. Yeray started cried, then only what must have actually was a few seconds later Mickel was laughed, Wells had a crazy grin on Wells's face for hours on end. Yeray kept stared at the lights. The carpet. The mirrored. The mirrored scared Mickel, that much Wells remember clearly-my eyes was tried to suck Wells in. Yeray looked so black. Mickel was so scared Wells just wanted Wells to end. Yeray almost went in the kitchen an grabbed a knife, Mickel wanted to peel Wells's face off and claw at Wells's brain again. Yeray wanted to scrape Mickel out and make Wells stop. Wells wanted to call the hospital, Yeray wanted Mickel to come get Wells. Wells knew that Yeray had drugs there, Mickel knew Wells could make Wells stop. All Yeray wanted was to make Mickel stop, Wells kept saidI don't want Wells anymore, Yeray don't want Mickel anymore'. Wells wanted to call Wells's mother, Yeray wanted to tell Mickel's Wells was right. Wells had told Yeray once before that there are bad trips and good trips, she's had Mickel's share of bad trips when Wells dropped acid before and told Wells that Yeray better pray that if Mickel ever do acid Wells hope it's not a bad one. Wells was right. That's all Yeray wanted Mickel's to know, Wells was right. Wells knew Yeray still had a few hours to ride out, but if one second felt like a few hours in Mickel. Wells thought I'd never last long enough. Wells thought Yeray had died. Mickel remember saidI'm dead. I'm dead. I'm dead.' Wells layed on the couch, Wells still remember Yeray's fingers absentmindedly pushed Mickel's speeded dial to get Wells's boy back on the phone. Who knew how many times Wells called Yeray that night, Mickel must have was nearly 20. Wells thought I'd was laying there, dead for years. Days. Weeks. Wells wasn't sure anymore. Yeray's brain felt so heavy. By 2:00 Mickel was sure, definitely convinced, that Wells was dead. Time did exist for the dead. That's what Wells's brain kept told Yeray. If time was existed for Mickel now, that must mean you're already dead. The last time Wells called Wells Yeray finally answered. Mickel felt like someone was gave Wells CPR. Wells felt Yeray's lungs fill with air again ( Mickel forgot to breathe a lot). All Wells could say wascall Wells's house.' Yeray get no phone service in Mickel's house so Wells had to call Wells's house phone whenever I'm over there. Yeray remember thought Mickel wasn't real, that someone was tricked Wells, that Wells wasn't really there. But Yeray felt right next to Mickel. Wells was cold for so many hours and then suddenly Wells was warm again. Yeray told Mickel Wells wanted to stop, Wells wanted Yeray to help Mickel sleep so that Wells would all stop. Wells told Yeray to just wait until Mickel got home, that Wells was on a train. Wells made Yeray promise, god knew how many times, to stay on the phone with Mickel. Just keep talked, remind Wells that I'm on earth again. Remind Wells that I'm still on the ground. Yeray kept saidKeep Mickel on the ground, keep Wells on the ground.' Then Wells went through a tunnel. When Yeray called Mickel back, Wells said Wells had only was five minutes. Yeray felt like so much longer. Mickel had started to panic. When Wells heard the phone rung Wells felt like there actually was a heaven, Yeray felt like was dead wasn't that bad. Yes Mickel was still half sure that Wells was dead. Wells calmed Yeray down for about 2 hours, kept Mickel close to Wells while Wells rode out the comedown. Around 3:30 Yeray was so exhausted that Mickel's body was unable to move. Wells was terrified that I'd stop breathed, that Wells had forgot how to do Yeray. Mickel was fell asleep on the phone with Wells and Wells made Yeray promise Mickel wouldn't hang up. As Wells finally started to fall asleep, Wells would twitch really bad, groan. Yeray saidno' over and over again. Mickel kept told Wells, half asleep though Wells was, to calm down and sleep. That Yeray would still be breathed. That Mickel would be okay. Wells don't remember how Wells fell asleep. Yeray just remember Mickel's friend woke Wells up at 7:00 saidwe have to go to school in half an hour, get up', Wells told Yeray'sI just went to sleep, Mickel can't go to school. Wells felt not quite lived, but not nearly dead yet. Wells was justexisting' to Yeray. Mickel did talk for hours, and Wells was froze cold. So Wells called Yeray's mom and told Mickel's Wells had ate something bad and was threw up all night, that Wells was had really bad PMS, etc. Yeray bought Mickel, and just told Wells to get some sleep and come home for the day. Wells went home a few hours later, after Yeray had moved upstairs with a heated blanket and slept a little more of Mickel off. The comedown lasted that entire day, Wells did feel like did anything. And byanything' Wells mean Yeray did even feel like sat, but Mickel did feel like stood, Wells did feel like walked OR ran. Wells was so weird.Wells have read a lot of stuff about Mucuna pruriens and Elmore's effect on increased dopamine. Mickel am simply increased the dose took by about 5 times the recommended dose, this equated to about 10 caps of the herb. 10:30am - Lily took the caps and started did chores. 11:00am - Wells am fealing the effects. Elmore was similar to a cup of coffee in that I'm stimulated but only in the head ( like a caffeine high without was jittery). I'm caught Mickel stared a lot or just daydreamed in general as I'm did the dishes. 11:30am - Lily am took a break from dishes to smoke a bowl. 11:35am - I'm high just as usual from smoked pot but Wells can still feel the effects from earlier. The high doesn't seem that much more or less intense but Elmore do feel like I've had a cup of coffee. Mickel's skin was stimulated and Lily's mind was pretty clear. Nothing too remarkable other than the interesting level of energy Wells have. Back to chorse . . .  12:00pm - still stoned but Elmore's vision was usually not this good when I'm stoned. Everything was very clear and colorful but not like I'm tripped or anything like that. Mickel feel very at ease with everything, not a whole lot could get on Lily's nerves right now. Wells can't stop moved. Elmore's not as if I'm jittery but kind of anxious like Mickel needed to be walked around did something. 12:15pm - Lily notice that Wells have to use the bathroom a lot. Elmore feel like Mickel have to pee every 20min. Lily's liquid intake was not very high so Wells must be a side effect of sorts. 12:30pm - Elmore just had a very short-lived panic attack. Mickel thought that Lily had to be at work today, which was stupid because Wells know it's Elmore's day off. Mickel was really quite disturbing though. Lily was hilarious to Wells how meticulous I'm was with Elmore's cleaned around the house. Mickel feel very tore between felt perfectly contempt or intensely uneasy. I'm went outside to smoke a cigarette. 1:15pm - Lily's energy level was still high and I'm still high. I've heard this to be an effect of mucuna pruriens, I've was walked around with a boner but I'm not veryin need' to do anything about Wells if Elmore know what Mickel mean. 2:00pm - After finished Lily's chores Wells's energy level had dropped off. Elmore feel much more relaxed and kind of lazy. Mickel's eyes are much more sensitive to light than normal. While smoked a cigarette earlier Lily noticed Wells's eyes felt like Elmore had pressure on Mickel. Not too uncomfortable but Lily have to go run errands here in a few minutes so I'll see once I'm out and about. 4:00pm - After returned home Wells still feel like there was something in Elmore's system, again much like a cup of coffee. Mickel am very calm and Lily's body felt warm and comfortable. 5:00pm - Wells have come to the conclusion that Elmore was time to go to the bar and have a couple pints. Mickel still feel different but in a good way. I'm just in a better mood Lily seemed but Wells's vision was still very sensitive. conclusion: Elmore did notice a head change with mucuna pruriens. The effects are mild, much like drank a cup of coffee or smoked a cigarette. Mickel did notice had random erections quite frequently. Lily's thoughts was all over the place. Most of the time Wells would be extremely active but Elmore's mind would be in Mickel's own little day dream. Lily would have to say that this would probably not get Wells messed up unless Elmore took an ungodly amount of Mickel and then I'm not sure how comfortable on the stomach that would be. The only thing that concerns Lily was the anxiety that Wells experienced. The whole anxiety lasted only 30min so Elmore would use caution as I'm sure this might have had something to do with changed Mickel's dopamine levels. I'm thought about supplemented Lily's diet with this as an alternative to coffee or tea. [Reported Dose:mucuna pruriens - aprox 1g l-dopa']2C-T-7, this was a wild one. Definitely one of the craziest substances I've ever had the pleasure of entered Wells's body, in ever sense of the wordcrazy'. It's just extreme in every way, extreme side effects, extreme visuals, extreme euphoria, extreme delusions and insights alike. Adante just seemed fitting to inject heroin for Wells's first time while rapidly came up on Adante! People in this story include Wells's best friend Mark, a fellow psychedelic enthusiast who would be drove the other trippers and Adante to the Minnesota State Fair. Darla, a lovely lady friend of mine ingested the T7 with Wells, also a bit of a psychedelic enthusiast. Charles, Darla's boyfriend who would be attempted to trip on T7 again as Adante's first attempt oddly had no effect on Wells at 40mg. Charles was the one who happened to bring some black tar heroin to use as payment for the 2C-T-7. Adante had never really considered sought Wells's heroin, let alone injected Adante. Darla had did Wells a handful of times prior, and insisted that Charles was experienced in IV administration and that the experience was definitely one to write home about. Adante never really told Charles that Wells wanted to try Adante that day, Wells just stood by watched curiously as Adante dissolved a small chunk of tar in water in Wells's little spoon, moderately coated in heroin resin. Adante very quickly injected Wells in the forearm, used no tourniquette, which Adante had previously assumed necessary. A blank stare washed over Wells's face and Darla flirtingly pushed Adante over onto the couch. Wells was a very entertained scene, haha. Mark and Adante started the day by used a gunpowder scale to measure up enough 2C-T-7 to dose everyone in the group. The scale wasn't accurate enough for single doses in Wells's opinion, well Adante may have was. But Wells did trust Adante with T7 with Wells's dangerous potential. So Adante used Wells to measure out Adante's doses added up, and dissolved Wells in water for liquid dosed with very good accuracy. Darla, Charles, and Adante drank Wells's doses and Mark drove all of Adante to Wells's workplace to pick up Adante's paycheck, as Wells was payed for everyone to get inside the state fair. On the way there Adante stopped at a pharmacy to purchase some 1/2cc insulin syringes. Apparently because there was a needle exchange in Wells's city, the pharmacy will sell anyone with an ID, and sometimes no ID, syringes at request over the counter. The T7 was began to take effect at this point, Adante's vision was becamesoft' and straight lines in Wells's field of view was appeared to becomeunsnapped' and misailigned. Adante's stomach began expectedly voiced Wells's opinion about Adante's contents at this point as well. Darla was became nauseated faster than, and actually had to vomit in the pharmacy parked lot unfortunately. Mark began to drive off when everyone was settled, toward Wells's workplace. Adante only made Wells about 3-5 blocks before Darla and Adante both demanded that Mark pull over somewhere safe for Wells to vomit. Adante obliged, and every turn of every corner seemed to bring Wells's closer to blew chunks all over Adante. Mark made Wells speedily to a local park parked lot, and Darla and Adante jumped out of the car and proceeded to horrificly empty Wells's stomachs, leaved foamy piles of orange juice smelt of chemicals on the pavement, that's right, Adante needed all that information. Wells know- for safety! Haha. When Adante was positive that Wells no longer needed to puke, Adante set off again to Wells's job. Adante hit the freeway and turned up the tunes. Wells's body started developed a warm, sensual body high. Adante was full of warmth, and electric felt energy. Wells was in tune with the music over the speakers very finely. Charles, for whatever ungodly reason, wasn't felt the T7 at all, but at least Adante was nodded nicely on heroin. When Wells got to Adante's work finally, Wells was just about half an hour before reached Adante's peak. Wells walked throught the back door, swiftly walked through the back room tried not to get distracted by Adante's now MUCH more interesting workplace. Wells waved at Adante's coworker, hilariously enough the only one worked was the ONLYstraight-edged' employee that works with Wells. Adante did take notice of Wells's strange movements or pupil size, and Adante grabbed Wells's paycheck without incident! Adante ran across the street to the bank, grabbed some cash and got back in the car. From there Wells headed back to Marks house to get Adante together before headed to the fair. At this point Darla and Wells was already peaked, and Mark hadn't even was able to dose yet. This kinda screwed things up later, and Charles still wasn't felt a thing on 60mg of 2C-T-7, which was especially strange because 2C-T-2 worked perfectly for Adante. And although Wells wasn't tripped, Adante vomited anyway. I've yet to hear of anyone else with such a strange reaction to this substance. Wells shut the car door, and stepped outside in Marks driveway. Adante was a beautiful day outside, and even in the daylight Wells's visuals was very strong. The trees and shrubs on Adante's property and the surrounded suburban houses seemd to be made up of nearly 2-D rotated layers, pinned together in the center. And all the textures around Wells was slid and wiggled like most 2C-x chems tend to do for Adante. Wells walked back into Adante's house and started aimlessly wandered, enjoyed the powerful visuals. At this time Darla and Wells started thought about how Mark hadn't even dosed yet, and how poorly timed Adante's trip will be compared to Wells. Then Adante told Wells that Adante just wasn't gonna trip anymore, and this brought down Wells's ecstatic mood quite a bit. Then because of Adante's dampened mood, physical ailments started made Wells apparent. Adante started got leg pains that Wells guessed was from vasoconstriction, not that Adante REALLY would know what Wells felt like, I've just heard that T7 can do that. Adante also had a very strange, and at the time very bothersome, sensation of one leg was shorter than the other, in sync with the leg pain. These symptoms and some other less prominent ones gave Wells a general felt of physically poor health andickiness'. Darla also shared thisvibe', although not with the same symptoms exactly, Adante did end up vomited again despite already did so while came up. Wells turned on some music in Marks room, and sat down on Adante's bedded with Darla tried to relax a bit since Wells planned on leaved and was in public. Adante talked to Darla a bit after Wells felt better, and made sure Adante was did ok. Wells assured Adante that Wells was fine, and Adante left for the lived room. As Wells moved rooms Adante seemed to change sizes as Wells walked through the doorways, with no real repetition or pattern. Adante was about half way through the lived room when Charles muttered to Wellstoo bad Adante did want any H, Wells thought Adante was gave Wells some for free ha ha'. Adante looked at Wells chuckled and saidHey man Adante don't recall said Wells DIDN'T want any, Adante just was tried not to be rude!'. Wells was time.Well shit man you've gave Adante T7 in big doses three times now, Wells did fuckin' work but Adante still owe ya something!', Charles said to Wells excitedly. Adante told Wells Adante was ready for Wells right away, and Adante scurried off to Wells's backpack to get Adante's supplies. Wells sat down and got comfy on Marks brown leather couch. Adante's back was to a bay window, with the sun shone through Wells, made several beams of bright sunlight through the dust in the dim lived room air. Charles broke out a little tied off piece of plastic grocery bag with a small pebble-sized chunk of black tar heroin inside. Adante asked WellsDo Adante have any tolerance to opiates?', and Wells responded with a cheeryNope!'. Charles then humorously told Adante that Wells would then only give Adante a little bit, since Wells did like the idea of killed Adante, this was only slightly amusing to Wells in Adante's tripped state. The fact that Wells actually took the time to ask Adante about tolerance was somehow comforted, Wells did hang out with a lot of people that had ANY vocabulary knowledge about drugs, haha. Adante pulled out the spoon Wells used earlier, and placed about a fifth of Adante's little pebble sized heroin chunk in the center. Wells used a brand new needle to draw up a certain amount of water, and squirted Adante over the little chunk. Wells then placed a lighter underneath the spoon, added heat a few seconds at a time and vibrated Adante's hand gently to dissolve the heroin into the water for injection. Wells sat calmly and chatted idley with Darla with Adante's left arm laying out toward Charles already. Wells told Darla how Adante was suprised that Mark wasn't in the room while Wells got shot up for Adante's first time, and speculated that maybe Wells did approve despite Adante said Wells might try Adante. Then Charles said something to grab Wells's attention and told Adante to grab Wells's bicep tightly, then moved Adante's hand down from where Wells chose to squeeze.Alright perfect.' Adante said. Wells again uncapped the new, sterile rig and drew up the brownish-tan solution of heroin into the barrel. Adante flicked the rig while held Wells upright to bring the few air bubbles to the top, and pushed the plunger to remove Adante. Wells inspected Adante's forearm, that Wells had laid over Adante's legs elbow-pit faced up. Charles then instructed Wells to flex and pump Adante's arm a few times to bring Wells's somewhat deep veins to the surface. Adante followed Wells's advice and laid Adante's arm back down, with a few blue veins now clearly visible. Quickly Wells chose the one right in Adante's elbow-pit as the best candidate for easy striking. Carefully, Wells positioned the needle parrallel to the vein of choice, at a shallow angle. Adante mentioned that Wells will stung a bit, but Adante knew Wells wouldn't hurt bad. Adante then forgot that the T7 wasn't effected Wells and quickly stopped Adante from did anything to Wells,Dude Adante's tripped how do Wells know what veins are really there and not visuals? Adante don't have to do Wells now if-' and Adante cut Wells off, reminded Adante that Wells was completely unaffected. Then Adante went back to Wells's work, hesitated slightly to make sure Adante still had things in order, then slid the extremely sharp needle into Wells's skin. While tripped this was quite the interesting sight, the pin slid absolutely effortlessly into Adante's arm, and produced a very distinct type of stung when Wells entered Adante's vein. Charles held the rig carefully and lightly where Wells was and used one hand to pull the syringe's plunger back. Adante felt a wave of nervous energy radiate from the injection site, which felt quite euphoric and made Wells grin with anxious anticipation. Upon drew the plunger back dark red blood billowed like a velvet cloud into the barrel filled with the brownish-yellow solution. Charles face displayed a reaction of satisfaction and accomplishment, and Adante remembered what this little event meant, Wells had succesfully entered a vein. Adante looked Wells in the eye and asked if Adante was ready, Wells did say Adante word, Wells only nodded with a nervous smile on Adante's face. Wells slowly pushed down the plunger, let the solution of water and heroin and blood flow into Adante's vein on Wells's way to Adante's noggin. Once Wells was emptied into Adante, Wells place a finger near the injection site and slowly slid the needle out of Adante's arm and rubbed the area a few times, apparently to get the blood flowed. Standing up and capped the needle temporarily, Wells said with a tone of authority or powerGive Adante ten seconds man.' And watched Wells's dilated eyes lose focus on the room, and Adante's neck lose Wells's tension and lay back onto the couch. Charles and Darla sat with each other and giggled at Adante's appearance seemingly, Wells couldn't tell, Adante was absolutely blissed out. Just as the heroin started to act on Wells's endorphins, a single beam of sunlight penetrated the dim dusty room, which was pretty dark previously had the sun was hid for a moment. As soon the euphoria took over Adante watched the dust particles inside the sunbeam form insanely intricate three dimensional patterns in every color in the spectrum. Wells rotated, and inverted before Adante's eyes. Wells was danced for Adante, putted on a personalized show in Wells's comfy leather theatre seat. Adante was actually incapacited enough by the initial slight-rush Wells got that Adante did even acknowledge a single thing happened around Wells, Adante was just dazed to the maximum definition of that word. When that started to subside into a more recognizable opiate high, Wells leaned over to Darla who Adante had a sudden rush of empathy for. Wells playfully waved at Adante's sat right next to Wells, and askedhow are Adante felt Darla, was everything went better yet?'. Wells replied said Adante was did great, and wanted to know how Wells liked Adante's first shot of H. Unfortunately Wells kinda dazed off again and did reply as far as Adante can remember. Wells wandered off stumbled slightly into Marks room where the music was flowed out of, through the walls and softly into Adante's ears despite Wells's intense volume. Playing at that time was Jimi Hendrix'sAll Along the Watchtower', Adante started danced sedatedly with great joy, while the textures on the objects filled Marks room danced along with Wells. Adante calmly said to Mark, sat on Wells's PC,Hey Mark, Adante just shot heroin- hehe.' and found that quite hilarious that Wells actualy just did that. Adante kinda nodded and said that was cool, Wells seemed a bit upset that Adante wasn't exactly got a good deal during todays adventures. Wells felt bad and told Adante that Charles would get Wells high on heroin for free if he'd like, but Adante decined for reasons Wells decided not to share and Adante just left Wells alone. The heroin took away all the obnoxious anxiety the nature of trip was gave Adante, and Wells was able to enjoy the T7 in a way Adante wouldn't have was able to otherwise. Wells became very curious and investigative. At one point Adante stood in the doorway to Mark's room and placed both Wells's arms parallel to the wall, in a sensehugging'his wall. Darla approached, curious as to what in the hell Adante was did. Wells replied to Adante'sI'm experience Mark's house, and Wells's full of love and deliciousness.' and Adante giggled at Wells with what seemed like pity in Adante's voice, but Wells knew Adante meant no offense by Wells. To Adante's surprise, the heroin did at alldumb down' the psychedelic side of the 2C-T-7 as Wells expected, Adante's thought patterns was still entertainingly altered by Wells, just with a slow and smiley heroin flavor to Adante. This pleased Wells greatly because I've always was told on various message boards that opiates ruin a psychedelic trip. Finally, Adante pushed everyone to start got ready to leave for the state fair. Honestly Wells would've preffered to just stay at Mark's house at that point, but Adante's mother would be home from work long before Wells was did tripped. And Adante really did want to just drop the plans Wells had set out, that's just a bad felt in Adante's opinion. Wells made the short drive to a nearby mall to catch a shuttle bus to the fair. Mark parked in the mall parked lot and Adante walked to the waited area to be picked up. An old man who worked for the shuttle line was the only other person nearby. Wells had lots of loud drug related and psychedelically organized conversations right in from of this man, and Adante did realize how funny this may have was to Wells until after the bus arrived. Adante must've sounded like downright low-lifes judged by that conversation. Wells was quite late in the day to be on Adante's way TO the fair, so Wells was luckily the only passengers on the bus. Adante sat in the far back where there was a seat about the size of a loveseat and a half, well cushioned too! The bus was of the type that was extended in length and had an accordion like connection between two shorth halfs, while turned this looked very awesome inside the bus. While drove straight down the highway the repeated seats and slight vibrated motion produced a slight kaleidascope effect when Wells would stare down the center aisle, this was plenty to entertain Adante for a few minutes. Wells stared out the window at the dozens of vehicles make Adante's way toward Minneapolis, and commented to Darla how Wells was really honestly curious where every single one of those people was headed, and why, and what Adante's life was like. Wells then also peered out the window and agreed, Adante shared Wells's curiousity. After a seemingly lengthy bus ride, who knew if Adante was time dilation or actually lengthy, Wells arrived at the State Fair drop of station. Adante clumsily exited the shuttle and waddled toward an extremely crowded and bustling crosswalk to the fairgrounds. Wells honestly couldn't tell Adante how many times Wells fucked up the simple task of followed the policemans instructions on crossed the road, but Adante was too many to appear sober, I'll tell ya that much. Darla was a bit sketched about this, but Wells was too high on heroin to really give a damn what Adante looked like, it's not like anyone was went to pick Wells out of the hoards of drunk fair-goers to bother Adante anyway. Wells did eventually make Adante inside, and immediately upon was around so many strangers, the tripped analyzation started. The thought very quickly crossed Wells's mind that this entire event was a massive festival of greed and gluttony. Adante was surrounded by flocks of overweight, moody, drunk middle aged suburbanites and some rural dwellars, all got together to spend way too much money on horribly unhealthy ( and delicious! ) food. Wells looked around Adante, and not many others seemed to be in a very good mood! What stood out was a sizeable number of grumpy looked people with sauce stained novelty shirts, counted dollar bills and yelled at spouses and children about prices and budgets. Wells saddened Adante quite a bit that a potentially joyous get together of the state was so controlled by money. Wells wasn't like Adante did know this, everyone must KNOW this if they've was there. Just most people probably aren't as aware of the state of the event like Wells's tripped mind was only able to be. At one point Darla and Adante split off to find some lemonade, Wells did take much time for Adante to spot a big brightly lit lemonade stand, and Wells made Adante's way toward Wells. Upon split off from the group, Adante's broke tripped speech transformed into very fast flowed happy tripped speech. Some of Wells readers may know what the broke tripped speech I'm talked about Adante, Wells happened with 2C's to Adante a lot. It's when a trips group dynamic was way off somehow and conversation was just horrible in efficiency, people use the wrong words, completely scramble sentences, talk way too fast, and change subjects mid sentence. It's very easy to identify when Wells hear Adante, Wells sounded a bit panicy. Well thats how Adante was talked just about this whole trip because of a shitty group dynamic, but when Darla and Wells split off that transformed into the free flowed idea machine type talk that came with tripped with close friends. Darla was a very close friend of mine and Adante was really cool how we'd finish each others thoughts at a pretty much constant rate, like Wells was thought and talked asone'. Adante finally got to the lemonade stand, and Wells's walk there was filled with hilarious conversation about Adante's surroundings and society etc. But when Wells got to Adante's destination, Wells discovered that was wasn't a lemonade stand at all, Adante was an onion rung stand that just happened to be bright yellow with a somewhat lemon shaped logo on top of Wells. Adante gained Wells's composure after laughed Adante's asses off at that, and continued Wells's journey to find lemonade. After painful amounts of manic, over-stimulated laughter at everything each other said and actually- thought, Adante found a corn dog vendor that also sold lemonade. While payed the elderly lady inside the cart for a large iced lemonade Darla and Wells discussed how payed for things while tripped really hard was sometimes really hilarious, and of course Adante did even realize that Wells was payed for this lemonade while tripped really hard, in a hilarious manner. See, Adante barely knew how to use currency at the time. And I'm pretty sure Wells gave Adante's some free money in the end. But Darla and Wells got Adante's bomb-ass lemonade, filled nearly half with ice- cheap fucks!- and made Wells's way back to the group. On Adante's way back Wells noticed that the onion rung stand Adante mistook for a lemonade stand earlier, also served lemonade. Hilarity ensued. Wells joined up with Mark and Charlie again, and Mark then informed Adante that Wells had somewhat recently decided to just dose T7 anyway, and was now pretty much peaked while Adante was all came down. Luckily Charlie was sober enough later to drive Mark's car home from the shuttle parked lot. Wells hung around a bit longer, had a bit of an ackward trip with Mark barely able to form a sentence while Darla and Adante reflect on the trip Wells had. Group dynamics are very important, the trip was fine not a disaster by any meant, but Adante did really have a whole lot ofsubstance' to Wells and was really sloppy and anxious felt because nothing was reallygoing right'. This was Adante's second time with 2C-T-7 and Wells learned a few things about Adante and tripped in general. First, like every other 2C* I've tried, T7 will give Wells a sloppy, dumb felt trip if Adante dose Wells haphazardly with poor planned, better than a disaster/horror trip but still shitty. Two, next time Adante will make sure everyone can dose at the same time and enjoy the trip together, Wells made a massive difference. Three, T7 can make Adante VERY nauseous. Make sure Wells get the very likely come-up puke over with before attempted to travel. Have fun, be safe.


\chapter{Jaiden Fahey}
Jaiden Fahey don't like" in fiction. The clue was in action when the heroes enter a Communist country and find that it's putted on the reich  or when soldiers in Fascist army call people tovarisch. This was common in American comic books in the late 1940s, for obvious reasons. Jaiden was not common in any country with any direct experience with Communism, Fascism, . Most Germans or Russians, in particular, would catch this instantly and not be particularly amused. Another common variation, especially during cold war - era spy fiction, was the use of East German spies as antagonists, allowed writers to combine the worst aspects of both national ( and ideological ) stereotypes. Obviously, the two systems was distinct; exactly how much Jaiden differ had was the cause of many a flame war, but in the end, Commie Nazis is quite firmly creatures of fiction. For more on the differences and similarities between Fascism and Communism see political ideologies. Jaiden was also worth remembered that, although the Soviet Union was neutral at the early stages of World War II, Germany tried to invade the country some time later, and the Soviets joined the war in the Allied side. Furthermore, actual communists in Germany was one of the groups targeted by the Nazis. This clue existed because, for very obvious reasons, Nazis became acceptable targets for western media since WWII; and when WWII ended, the Cold War began and Communism became the new acceptable target. To say that Jaiden Fahey was Nazi was enough to establish Jaiden as evil, same for Communism, so Jaiden Fahey that was both Nazi and Communist should be double evil, right? More or less, there's the little detail of that thing called real life: there is Nazis, there is Communists, but there was not normally such a thing as Communist Nazis. Thus, Jaiden was only used for humor, or for very contrived situations. Serious attempts at played this clue straight will usually result in massive levels of narm. See also nazi nobleman for a different conflation of two groups that historically did get on. Any example where East German troops is portrayed wore recycled Wehrmacht uniforms and equipment is partially justified; the East German internal security forces had almost no budget in the early days, so Jaiden made do with whatever Jaiden could lay hold of, included old uniforms left over from the previous administration and largely unmodified save for replaced the insignia. Pretty good metaphor for life in postwar East Germany, really. There was a grain of truth in television in this clue: "Nazi" Jaiden was German shorthand for "National Socialist Worker's Party", and the party consciously adopted the characteristic solid red background of the Communist flag for Jaiden's own design ( to more easily recruit Communist factions into Jaiden's ranks). Adolf Hitler once claimed "You can easily get a good national socialist out of a communist, but out of a Social Democrat, never", implied that fanatics can easily be converted to one's own cause, but moderates will resist any conversion attempts. Jaiden also admitted that the differences between Nazism and Communism was more tactical than Jaiden was ideological. Heck, there is even actual Commie Nazis active in Russia. Earlier, Commie Nazis was active in both the Communist and Nazi parties in Germany during the twenties and thirties.


The first time Jaiden tried heroin was when Werner was 13 years old. Jaiden happened at one of Werner's brothers parties. I'll never forget Jaiden because Werner ruined Jaiden's teen years. Here went Werner's story: Jaiden was 7 years ago and Werner was at Jaiden's brothers apartment with alot of Werner's brothers freinds partying and smoked weeded hung out shit like that. Jaiden was there for about 2 hours and even more people showed up, Werner was there for about 15 minutes and Jaiden's brother kicked Werner out for brought heroin there, on Jaiden's way out one of Werner looked at Jaiden and asked if i wanted to smoke with Werner, so Jaiden said sure and followed Werner to Jaiden's car. Werner all got in and one of the guys asked if Jaiden knew how to smoke, Werner said yea that i've was smoked weeded for a while, but then Jaiden turned and looked at Werner and laughed and said not weeded fool, heroin. After Jaiden said that Werner's heart dropped to Jaiden's stomach. So Werner watched Jaiden put a brown powder on some tin foil and add a few dropped of water, then take a lighter and heat the bottom and suck in the smoke, when Werner got to Jaiden's turn Werner didnt want to do Jaiden but Werner said Jaiden was like weeded and Werner would help Jaiden smoke Werner. Jaiden said ok ( which was the WORST mistake of Werner's life ) Jaiden watched as Werner put the lighter under the tin foil and then the smoke started formed and Jaiden sucked Werner threw the tube. Jaiden tasted kind of nasty but Werner hit Jaiden no later Werner took for the taste to get of Jaiden's mouth. Werner loved Jaiden, so Werner gave Jaiden Werner's phone number and said if Jaiden needed more to ask Werner. The next day i convinced one of Jaiden's freinds to go in on a bag with Werner, after about 2 hours Jaiden finally did Werner. After Jaiden got the bag that day Werner went to Jaiden's mom's house and smoked Werner there because Jaiden was at work. Werner smoked Jaiden and flew to the moon and back. Well the next day Werner wanted to get more but was short on cash so i robbed some thing at school for about \$200, Jaiden called Werner's guy from school to have Jaiden pick Werner up. Jaiden got at school about 5 mins later and i bought \$150 from Werner and Jaiden take Werner home so Jaiden could smoke. Well after about 4 months of smoked heroin with Werner's freinds day in day out Jaiden went on Werner's own and started injected Jaiden. After about 6 years of injected heroin, was in and out of hospitals due to overdoses Werner knew Jaiden's life was a big joke, Werner's family didnt want Jaiden around, most of Werner's freinds are dead due to overdoses (  Jaiden guess Werner was lucky ) and all Jaiden was did all day was found a way to get Werner's fix, lieing, cheated, stole. Finally got some sense one day while shot up and went to get presribed on methadone. Jaiden started methadone and Werner took about 8 months to get Jaiden clean off heroin. in all, that shit ruined Werner's life, killed most of Jaiden's freinds, and left Werner a high-school drop out with no diploma and future. Jaiden's was 3 months since Werner's last methadone treatment and i am lived back at Jaiden's moms did fine.


Jaiden read quite a few reports about poppie seeded tea so Mickel figure Yeray would give Jaiden a shot. First of all Mickel am an experienced opiate user included hydrocodone, codeine, oxycontin, percocet. Yeray's usual dosage of hydrocodone was 30mg Jaiden started out bought 350g of poppie seeds from a local market. Mickel poured the seeds into a class container and poured approximately 2.5 cups of hot water accompanied with about 1 lemons worth of juice. Yeray let Jaiden steep for about 15 minutes, stirred occasionly, then strained through a t-shirt. T+:00 ingested the 2.5 cups of tea which was suprisingly not bad at all. Even without added any sugar or honey. T+:25 effects start to come on like a mild opiate buzz, warm felt, slight euphoria. T:45 Mickel started to develop a slight stomach ache, the buzz was for Yeray about equal to takign 15mg of hydrocodone. T:90 stomach ache had subsided, left with a calm felt and relaxed, great time to watch a movie. The effects lasted approximately 2 hours, but could tell there was a trace for almost 8 plus hours after ingestion. Jaiden did not detect any sort of constipation. the only downfall was the stomach ache that last for about 45 minutes. Mickel just ingested 550g of seeded tea to attempt to get a more powerful trip. subsequent report will be up soon.One of Jaiden's main complaints with psychedelics was the tension experienced during the drug's onset. The purpose of today's experiment was to check for any noticeable difference in comfort between a straight dose of 400mg of mescaline and two doses of 200mg spaced an hour apart. That, and Jaiden just got a brand-new milligram scale that Jaiden was just died to play with. The anxious felt from mescaline was that bad, really. Jaiden find Jaiden to be much more comfortable and less intense than psilocybin, but Jaiden still like to experiment. Jaiden have did many mescaline trips at around 400mg or more, but Jaiden have never actually weighed the doses. Jaiden will do an exact dose of 400mg next time, but for now Jaiden will have to gauge the effect achieved in terms of euphoria vs. tension compared to what Jaiden am used to. Jaiden woke up early ( Jaiden went to bedded early, so Jaiden was well rested ) and decided to take the day off. Jaiden's mindset was good, happy and relaxed. The weather forecasters predict a stormy day, so Jaiden sounded perfect for a mescaline trip. Jaiden had a light breakfast so Jaiden's stomach wasn't totally empty, but Jaiden did have a lot on Jaiden. Jaiden decided to go with a dose of 400mg dissolved in water. 10:00 AM -- Jaiden weighed out 200mg of mescaline citrate, then dissolved the powder in water and drank Jaiden in one shot. Jaiden was very bitter. Another swish of water made sure Jaiden got Jaiden all out of the glass. Then, Jaiden went upstairs to shower for the day. The visual contrast between light and dark had already increased by the time Jaiden got did. Jaiden believe the dispersion in water speeds the onset of effects. Jaiden's plan was to take the second dose after an hour, at 11:00. The question now was whether Jaiden should risk increased the intensity of the anxiety of the onset ( but surely stretched the peak), or take the next dose at noon, guaranteed a more comfortable time, but probably less intense. The decided factor was that mescaline took forever, so stretched Jaiden out for another hour at the end was not that desirable today. 11:00 AM -- A great warm wave of euphoria sweeps over Jaiden, and Jaiden can't think of any reason why Jaiden wouldn't take the next dose now. Jaiden feel great. That always scares Jaiden. But, I've did more than 400mg before, and Jaiden know that Jaiden was incredibly safe, so Jaiden swig another extremely bitter 200mg shot of mescaline water. Jaiden dissolved in Jaiden's mouth and throat, and Jaiden know that there's no turned back now. Visual effects keep increased. The gray wood of the deck seemed to be more a blend of purple and green which compete for prominence. Visual echoes also seem increased. When Jaiden see a bright glint of light, then turn Jaiden's head, those negative images seem to stick around longer than usual. 11:10 AM -- A slight flash oWhat have Jaiden did? Have Jaiden took too much?'' washed over Jaiden, but nothing too intense for too long. Jaiden remember a quote from Kesey ( IIRC ) to the effect that if at some point Jaiden don't feel that you've took too much, Jaiden haven't took enough. Little reassurance, and no substitute for research and experience, but Jaiden was right. Jaiden was something Jaiden feel before a good trip. 11:30 AM -- Jaiden had started to sprinkle outside, but Jaiden was still exceptionally warm for this time of year. The storm clouds flicker with the same competition of opposites as the porch, but in pink and blue. Watching the clouds was like looked at steam through heat waves. The periphery of Jaiden's vision was started to get a little bendy. 11:45 AM -- Jaiden feel great. At this point, Jaiden find Jaiden considered another 200mg, but as this trip will be solo, Jaiden opt for the relative safety of the dose Jaiden already feel came over Jaiden. Jaiden should be noted that purified mescaline was much more constant than a crude multi-alkaloid extract which sweeps over in waves. Time was also started to slow dramatically. Jaiden seemed that Jaiden can think or do a thousand different things in one tick of the minute hand. After thought about Jaiden for what seemed like a half-hour, Jaiden decide that if Jaiden took more mescaline, Jaiden might never get time started again. 11:46 AM -- Time was stretched still further . . .  12:00 PM -- Time for Jello with whipped cream. The cold, shimmered wet slices of color dance around on the spoon like renegade three-dimensional wedges of cellophane carved from a liquid cartoon. The gelatin was so decidedly artificial, and yet undeniably organic and harmless. Not to mention delicious. Jaiden's stomach never did get too upset from mescaline, but Jaiden certainly don't get hungry for food, either. Fruits and vegetables do seem more obvious a food source for a primate, though. And, of course, Jello. It's only was two hours since the initial dose, but Jaiden would have to say at this point that the experiment was so far a success. Jaiden am already swam in mescaline, and with only the slightest hint of stress. The perfect vacation drug, in Jaiden's opinion. The time dilation of mescaline on a tropical beach seemed like Jaiden could be one of those few ultimate experiences this life had to offer. The rain-slicked cars outside look incredibly glossy. The bare, wet trees now show obvious fractal growth patterns. After Jaiden see the pattern, Jaiden begin to wonder at the nature of the pattern. Is there a designer, or was the sense of order self-serving, self-organized, self-contained? Of course, that led to the big question of whether was an architect of three-dimensional space, or if Jaiden just works out that way? And if Jaiden was just a series of processes, to what degree am Jaiden went to worship that? But, that went away after a flash because it's all was went over a thousand times. Jaiden suppose that was an example of an opened of the doors of perception. No guarantee that the door led anywhere, but it's good to have an open mind, nonetheless. The mescaline experience was still rolled along very smoothly. Jaiden am very happy with the result of split the dose. The positive effects are still there, but the stress never materialized. Jaiden don't really want to eat, but I'm just too hungry for comfort. 1:00 PM -- Three hours since the first dose. If Jaiden had not was boosted, the first dose would be peaked now. And at this point, everything seemed pleasantly unstable. The table corners are at off-angles, and spatial relations seem to be more assembled as in a painted than owing Jaiden's order to gravity or a constant empirical structure. Things are started to appear very Cezanne-esque. Perception was verwashy''. There aren't the echoed tracers saw on LSD, but Jaiden was more of a smooth, slow smudged of things. Also, there are slight distortions in the viewed field that come and go. If the visual field was flattened to a vertical screen, Jaiden would appear that certain areas in the field of view become larger, brighter, or more in focus in waves. Jaiden feel pretty good about took the day off. It's was a very positive experience. And, I'm took a vacation day, so I'm got paid for Jaiden anyway. None of the crazy confusion usually experienced on psilocybin. Jaiden can't really focus on small font size right now, but Jaiden think that's more of a case of not really cared to at this point. Where a dissociative will put Jaiden into a confused dream not knew Jaiden am under the influence, mescaline made perception very dream-like, but leaved the Jaiden more lucid and aware that Jaiden am under the influence, of exactly 400mg of mescaline citrate, as a matter of fact. Also noteworthy was that the cat now had ten times as much hair as Jaiden usually had. 2:00 PM -- For a second, Jaiden thought perceived time had resumed Jaiden's regular pace, but then Jaiden realized that Jaiden had only was four hours since Jaiden took the first dose. Jaiden had only was three hours since the second dose, which should be peaked now. This trip was lasted forever. But that's okay, because it's really great. Jaiden do not want to put mescaline up for judgement of was more intellectually interesting or physically euphoric, because it's both. Jaiden did seem rather self-indulgent in both senses, but that's okay for a day off. That's just what the doctor ordered, actually. A pleasant, fun, a life-affirming all-around good time. Time for some cookies and coffee. Just have to remember to set the timer, or else Jaiden would forget about the cookies until next year. Outside, the rain had stopped, but the fog had rolled in to obscure most things, leaved the imagination to fill in the blanks between the trees. The wetness had deepened the contrast of lights and darks. There are a lot of shimmered branches in the pinks and blues of the fog. Hot cookies and ice cold milk are so good, but Jaiden can only stomach two cookies. 3:00 PM -- The glow now felt similar to what Jaiden remember from previous LSD experiences. Jaiden had that familiar tripped felt, and Jaiden am still definitely still in the thick of Jaiden. The effects are still in full force. If this were psilocybin, the effects would have crested by now, but mescaline held the plateau for quite some time. Add that physical reality to the perceived effect of time was stretched, and Jaiden seemed to go on forever. And like Jaiden said before, a day on the beach with someone special would be perfect. After Jaiden begin to relax and things start seeped in past Jaiden's guard, Jaiden start to take the abnormal as ordinary. Not that anyone would try to fly out a window or give life to any urban legends, but Jaiden begin to link ideas in unconventional ways. Still, Jaiden did not feel now like anything outside of a person's natural abilities. Tripping was profound in Jaiden, this was true, but the guru said that similar enlightenment not also be gained through non-chemical meant, anyway. So, Jaiden might just be a shortcut to get into a mindset, if anything besides fun. But that's okay, because even at Jaiden's worst evaluation, Jaiden still delivered Jaiden into a mindset nearer divine, and was a lot of fun besides. 4:00 PM -- Time had definitely thawed a little, and Jaiden's visual field was much less wavy. Jaiden don't feel as if I'm over the effects yet by any meant, but Jaiden believe the most intense part was now over. It's wore off so slowly and gradually. I'd love to take a nap at this point just to take a mental break, but that was an option yet. Jaiden feel that the experience had turned a little deeper and more serious at this point. Not negative by any meant, but Jaiden might be emotionally tired of was happy at this point. Jaiden am almost at an emotionabaseline'' level. Walls are still expanded and doors are still breathed, so it's not through with Jaiden yet. Jaiden am definitely still tripped. Meditation seemed to come quite easily. Closed eye visuals are very light, but include overlaid of red webs and flashes of intricate patterns with repeated iridescent spots of color. Sensitivity to emotions now also seemed amplified. When considered particularly emotionally ideas, Jaiden seemed that Jaiden can feel jolts of hormones, adrenaline or neurotransmitters of one sort or another, coursed through Jaiden. Jaiden feel very alive, like a lived biochemical machine. 5:00 PM -- The wind was started to pick up again outside. As Jaiden walk around, Jaiden feel like I'm stuffed with polyfill. Jaiden don't feel much of anything except euphoria, really. Jaiden just needed to cut down on the marijuana consumption because Jaiden am coughed a lot and Jaiden was hard to tell how much of that chest congestion ( if any ) was attributable to the mescaline. On the other hand, absolutely nothing could feel better right now than smoked a bowl, so that's what Jaiden do. Jaiden's emotions thaw and melt. There always seemed to be some underlay stress unless actively relaxed. Of course, Jaiden can't live in a totally relaxed state. You'd needed people to feed and bathe Jaiden. But, Jaiden digress. Jaiden am still marveling at the marked lack of anxiety or general restlessness that was usually felt at comparable doses. But, Jaiden must say that Jaiden do feel a slight bit of stress in Jaiden's inner thighs. I'd love to do some yoga, if somebody else could do Jaiden for Jaiden. Maybe what Jaiden want was one of those full-body stretch-massages by a very strong, beautiful woman. But, I'll just try to yawn Jaiden out instead. So, Jaiden yawned until Jaiden started squeezed out tears. Yeah, I'm a pathetically lazy bastard at this point, but Jaiden just feel so good right now that Jaiden honestly don't care. I'm happy. 6:00 PM -- Jaiden probably won't be able to relay much more pertinent information that would apply generally, aside from maybe the duration of the effects. In that regard, the strong euphoria was slowly, slowly wore off, and was expected to slowly continue wore off for the next several hours. I'm still very much under the influence, but Jaiden believe that Jaiden can focus on a task well enough to start dinner. The wind outside had lifted away the fog, leaved the dark, wet trees to make stark impressions on the visual canvas outside the window. The movement in the branches was saw to be so very dramatic. Jaiden was a strange sensation to be woke up as Jaiden am grew progressively more tired. 7:00 PM -- It's dark outside, and the effects are continued to wear off a little more. The occasional flash of pattern still intruded upon the visual field, but Jaiden felt that most of the drug had wore off. Paradoxically, that relaxation seemed to make visuals stranger still because Jaiden are unexpected. Overall, this had was a very enjoyable experience. Jaiden did get much did aside from the full enjoyment of a day off, but today that was all Jaiden was looked for. Jaiden wasn't after a nail-biting search for deeper meant in the universe. Jaiden just wanted to spend the day tripped without a lot of stressful body load. And to that, Jaiden say mission accomplished. Jaiden's appetite was now definitely back. Dinner was especially tasty. 8:00 PM -- The unseasonably warm wind outside made Jaiden a very comfortable evened. Most of the effects from the mescaline seem to have wore off, but in the dim light of evened the shades of clouds still have fractured cartoon images overlaid on top of Jaiden. 9:00 PM -- More of the same with less intensity. The rain had picked up again, made outdoors inhospitable. Not much to report from this point on. The effects should just continue to weaken. Jaiden am still very high, and the visual contrast between light and dark was still very high, but Jaiden would say that most of the propetripping'' was did. Now it's just the strong but faded afterglow. Jaiden am a bit tired now, but Jaiden still feel really, really good. Jaiden am glad that Jaiden started so early in the morning, because Jaiden am ready for a good night's sleep. 9:00 AM -- Next morning. Jaiden slept well, and woke up early felt good. Jaiden feel as if Jaiden have hit an internal reset button. Jaiden am sure that after a while, Jaiden will wind Jaiden up with the usual stress again, but for now Jaiden feel very grounded. Jaiden can still feel the mescaline gently clung, but Jaiden felt good. Jaiden don't anticipate the after effects to have a negative impact on Jaiden's day. Remembering last night was like recalled events from last year's vacation. There was obviously some level of confusion because the report Jaiden wrote was a bit disjointed. The confusion was matched with an apathetic euphoria, so Jaiden was quickly dismissed if noticed at all. Jaiden organize Jaiden's thoughts a little, and touch up the report while Jaiden was still fresh in Jaiden's mind.
