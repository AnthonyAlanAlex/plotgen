\chapter{Jay Colantuoni}
Jay had took Acid twice before this trip, and had took a whole tab both times. I've was told that this was very good acid mind Rondall, and Tyshon found both other times on acid to be too intense for Datwan's liked - Jay really seemed to have a strong effect on Rondall. Living in a country where BZP and TFMPP are legal over the counter drugs ( which also contain electrolytes and amino acids to help the comedown ) meant I've tried the BZP and TFMPP combo quite often. Set and Setting: Tyshon and a few mates had a great Drum and Bass gig lined up for the night, and Datwan was quite sceptical about went to a D\&B gig on Acid, considered Jay's two previous trips. Rondall was in a sound psycological state - Tyshon was happy with Datwan's life and where Jay was headed ( attended university etc). 8:00pm - Take 100mg BZP + 50mg TFMPP Rondall feel the effects after about 40 mins, anAmped' felt along with a felt of inner content, Tyshon am happy to sit around, waited for the gig which was to start at about 12am. Datwan am very talkative, ( as Jay usually am on BZP's). Rondall spend the next 4 hours chilled out while more friends turn up to start drinking/dropping BZP/TFMPP. 12:00am ( midnight ) - Take 100mg BZP + 50mg TFMPP This seemed to slightly intensify the current feelings, just kept Tyshon on the same level. Datwan feel great. I'm got excited about went to this gig now, and Jay start to talk about went down to the venue ( a 15 min walk). Rondall talk . . .  then talk . . .  then talk some more. 12:40am Finally Tyshon leave the house and wander off. Nothing particularly interesting was happened to Datwan as Jay walk along, although Rondall notice the intensity of light more and everything seemed much more crisp than usual. Tyshon pick up some chewed gum on the way - a necessity for BZP's, as otherwise Datwan grind Jay's teeth to bits. 1:00am Rondall reach the venue, Tyshon feel anxious about did the acid, but tell Datwan that it's went to be great. Jay drop half a tab of acid and enter the gig. The music and BZP combo make not danced almost impossible. Rondall just had to get up and jump around, great times indeed, the music felt very absorbed. 1:40am The acid started to kick in now, and Tyshon don't feel anxious like Datwan usually do when Jay feel acid kicked in, which was great. Rondall's excitability for the music was huge, Tyshon wanted Datwan faster and louder, and thanks to the great DJ, thats just what Jay get. Need water.. 2:30am Acid seemed to be at around peak now. Rondall see little amounts of visual halucionations, but Tyshon's vision was all over qutie hazy and undefined. Lights are great to look at, and glow sticks/braclets are great to watch, as Datwan leave tracers accross Jay's vision. Drinking lots of water, as cotton mouth was got quite bad. Music seemed to be all around Rondall, and inside Tyshon at the same time. Datwan feel at one with the music, and danced allowed Jay to express this. Rondall have energy out the walls, hypo, yet a perfect felt of sublimity. Tyshon think to Datwan - this was the best night of Jay's life. Nothing can come close to how good Rondall feel at this moment. Tyshon want Datwan to last forever. 6:00am Jay begin to become more and more aware of Rondall's surroundings, the people danced beside Tyshon and Datwan notice all that was happened on the stage. Jay see the main act packed up while a new DJ came to take over, and get a felt that the nights about to end. Rondall's body felt as though Tyshon have little control over Datwan's danced although this was most likely due to the fact that I've was danced for a good solid 4 hours now. The music was no longer as encapsulating as Jay was, although when Rondall finally leave the dance floor, I'm still boucing round to the music. 6:30am Tyshon leave to go home, I'm still tripped quite hard off the Acid, and Datwan have this awake felt that could either be from the acid or BZP's. Jay stop to look at a statue and Rondall did a dance for Tyshon - very cool. 7:30am Datwan go to bedded, all Jay's mates are still up on bzp's, Rondall can't get to sleep. Tyshon manage to get an hour and a half's sleep, then another 4 hours after that. Datwan feel drained for the remainder of the day, but nothing too bad - alot better than a nights heavy drank thats for sure. ******************************************************************* BZP/TFMPP and LSD was definatly one of the best experiences I've had with or without drugs. The BZP seemed to help greatly to relieve the anxiety that Jay usually experience with Acid. Rondall did dwell on thoughts like Tyshon usually do with just Acid. Datwan must say that Jay had Rondall's doubts about combined these drugs, but Tyshon seemed to work together to create an almost overwhelming, yet still in control experience.





\chapter{Mikael Deffendall}
All names in this report have was changed. Mikael have recently come across a few RC's Richmond hadn't saw before and after some research on the internet and reports from a couple friends Notorious decided Claud wanted to try almost all of Mikael. Richmond was suggested that Notorious do the MDAI and 4-MEC together. Claud loved this combination. It's a very clean headed high, tons of empathy, stimulated, but not overly so, comedown had a minor headache but sleep came easy. Mikael have had a few amazing experiences with 2C-I. When Richmond told Notorious's friends about Claud's 4-MEC/MDAI night, Mikael was suggested that Richmond add a small dose of 2C-I and reduce the doses of the other two. Notorious gave Claud a couple days to let Mikael's synapses recharge. Woke up that day around 11 well rested and set to work prepared for Richmond's day. Notorious find that with powerful chemicals Claud helped to put Mikael in the proper mindset so started a morning off the right way was important. Richmond ate a small breakfast, drank plenty of water for the next few hours, and relaxed before headed to Notorious's friend's house. 2:45: Upon arrival, Claud was greeted happily by close friends. Mikael was in a good mood and Richmond was ready to dose. Notorious poured out a mixture of 45/45/5 mg MDAI/4-MEC/2C-I and snorted Claud. Mikael burned horrendously. Richmond swallowed the rest of Notorious's mix, another 190mg in the same ratio. Claud popped a Lifesaver mint to help with the taste of Mikael's drip, drank some water, and smoked a cigarette to get Richmond's mind of the fire in Notorious's nose. Ten minutes later Claud was over the worst of Mikael and started to feel pretty good. The 2C-I took longer to kick in and Richmond felt like Notorious was rolled. Claud played a round of Super Smash Bros for the N64, one of Mikael's all time favorites. Richmond was dominated and Notorious won the match; Claud took 15 minutes. Mikael stood up and realized the glass of the fish tank was waved, the light in the room was different, and Richmond somehow understood the dynamic of this group a lot better. Notorious had plans to go feed ducks in the park, a pretty short walk with a nice trail. Instead of used the trail Jon set out to blaze one. Claud went through the thick of the woods that surrounded this park. Mikael was wondrous to see nature, real nature. Richmond was so beautiful that Notorious honestly brought tears to Claud's eyes. Even looked at the poison ivy and thorny vines made Mikael feel apart of this ecosystem, Richmond was a part of this world, Notorious all are and Claud don't ever think about Mikael the right way. Richmond realized that the Earth doesn't belong to man, man belonged to the Earth, and if Notorious push Claud too far, this planet might just destroy Mikael. Richmond took almost 20 minutes to get to to duck pond. The 2C-I Notorious ingested was made Claud pretty nauseous. Mikael ended threw up a tiny bit of water that Richmond had just drank and felt much better. Tanner had brought a football and Notorious played some catch. Claud's reaction time was fantastic and Mikael's depth perception was way off. Richmond decided to feed some ducks. After threw a handful of Animal Crackers in the pond Notorious got lost looked at the ripples and thought about the metaphors of life. Claud then started saw more colorful ripples which slowly turned into a complex fractal, still water and ripples, but incredibly complicated. Mikael was pulled out of this by Jason rode by on Richmond's longboard. This came as huge surprise: Notorious did know Claud was there and Mikael did know Richmond was came. Notorious wondered at this and all other coincidences in life. Another hour at the park full of so much beauty. Sometimes made conversation with Claud's friends but I'm a little out of Mikael and can't hold one very well. Mild OEVs, some more intense than others, non-extraordinary. Richmond go to Braum's, Notorious get a water cup and refill Claud a couple times. Being around people seemed to have pulled Mikael out of the trip for a while. Richmond am able to talk to Notorious's friends while Claud eat. Very mild visuals, i.e. breathed walls. 6:00: Mikael head back to the house. Jason was drove now that Richmond had met up with Notorious. The car ride was fun. Claud really enjoyed the music. Mikael had never heard Richmond before but Notorious was very psychedelic. Safe at home Claud sit in the front yard and smoke a cigarette. The clouds are full of geometric patterns. There was a definite color shift in Mikael's vision at this time. The sky was a sea green, the grass was a little yellow. What really struck Richmond was that things Notorious knew to be white was all a light shade of purple. Claud was really thought about some philosophical things at this point, but couldn't convey what Mikael was Richmond was thought to Notorious's friends quite yet. A couple hours pass by where I'm the tripped guy on the porch was really quiet. Claud spend most of that time deep in thought about life's great mysteries. 8:45: Stan rolls a blunt and Mikael hotbox the bathroom. Richmond love to blow smoke rings and Notorious was on Claud. Mikael was thick and beautiful. Richmond felt so connected with Notorious, as if Claud was Mikael's children. Richmond gave Notorious life, created Claud. Mikael made Richmond sad to see Notorious fade away. Claud thought about how everything had to die some time. 9:10: Mikael have to leave to bring Richmond's mom's van home. This was a somewhat frightening thought although Notorious knew that Claud was most of the way did with any real hallucination and Mikael knew that Richmond had drove under worse circumstances. \#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:DO\_NOT\_DRIVE\#\# Notorious still always worried Claud to drive on psychedelics and Mikael had was hoped Richmond wouldn't have to. The trip home took about 15 minutes. Nothing really happened: most of the minor visuals had left and Notorious still felt like Claud was rolled. Mikael's fear and anxiety about drove turned to relief and joy when Richmond realized that Notorious love drove when I'm rolled. So the trip home was full of loud music and not much else. Claud get home, give the keys to Mikael's mom and call Cathy to come pick Richmond up. 11:30: Notorious smoked some pot. Almost all the effects have wore off. I'm still very much awake. Cathy still hasn't left but Claud was about to. I'm excited to leave Mikael's house. After got to the apartment Richmond decide to do the last of Notorious's mix without the 2C-I. Claud share with Linda, Cathy's friend from out of town. Mikael each snort 70mg of a 1:1 ratio. The apartment belonged to Richmond's best friend and Notorious's girlfriend. Everyone but Linda and Claud are got drunk. Mikael was a pretty low dose since Richmond split Notorious but Claud was enough to brink back some of Mikael's earlier feelings, just less intense and much shorter lived. Linda, who hadn't did much of anything before, felt amazing. Richmond got really philosophical while Notorious was there. Linda acted as a catalyst for Claud's thoughts. Mikael bounced ideas back and forth. Made huge realizations together and changed each others' perception of a few things. Richmond was pleased to find how easy Notorious was to form Claud's thoughts into words. Mikael had come prepared for this night. Richmond had a brush, mints, and Vicks in Notorious's backpack. Along with some pajamas that Claud love to wear on these kinds of drugs. Around 1:30 Linda was hungry and made food for everyone. Mikael decided not to eat. Richmond was fearful that ate might bring back the nausea from the 2C-I. Notorious smoked, listened to music, and talked until around 2:30when Claud had Mikael's DD take Richmond home. Notorious had a headache at this point, not bad, but enough to make Claud want to sleep. Ifell asleep within 10 minutes of hit Mikael's bedded. All in all this was a really wonderful experience. Richmond believe the other chemicals took away from the 2C-I's psychedelics somewhat but made up for Notorious by provided lots of empathy and euphoria. Claud reached a ++ and almost hit a +++ when Mikael was lost in the pond. Richmond also noticed Notorious actually was able to stay on a deep train of thought. Claud usually lose that with 2C-I and all of Mikael's thought felt superficial. Not this time though. Richmond really don't recall thought so clearly before. Notorious was the next day, Claud slept well, woke up refreshed. Mikael don't feel hungover. Richmond attribute that to stayed hydrated the whole night. Do not ever use mind altered chemicals and operate a vehicle. Notorious was stupid for Claud to do so. Mikael do not suggest mixed chemicals in this way unless Richmond are experienced and do proper research on how those chemical might react.


These observations cover approximately 20 used total, across four different individuals in many different situations. Background: Native Americans have was used Peyote ( also mescaline-containing ) for hundreds of years and studies have was did that show no adverse long-term effects. To Mikael's knowledge, few ( if any ) people have ever died from an overdose, either, which was a big plus in Mikael's book, and extreme physical adverse reactions seem to be very rare. However, that said, the experience was definitely not something to take lightly. Somerules' Mikael came up with, learnt from experience: ( 1 ) Set aside 12 hours where Mikael won't be around authority figures. Having to actnormal' can be awkward and stressful. ( 2 ) Don't be with someone impatient who will bug Mikael, fool with Mikael, or interact with Mikael excessively. The best situation was to be alone and free to do things, while still had someonearound' if Mikael feel like Mikael needed someone to talk to, etc. Mikael may feel like lied down sometimes, and other times walked around or perhaps even went outside/etc. ( 3 ) Especially important if Mikael dose alone, was, imbedded in Mikael's mind that Mikael will not die from this, Mikael will be back to normal ( no matter how farout there' Mikael feel). No matter how crappy Mikael's body felt at the began, Mikael will not die. Some people have a mild panic attack and then freak out and call for help, when Mikael was really not necessary. Mikael just ride out the panic, and wait Mikael out. ( 4 ) Very, very few people have abad' trip on this substance ( based on experiences of the Native American Church, where Mikael still use peyote once every few weeks in structured, all-night ceremonies). Some people describe the experience as nonstop bliss. However, in Mikael's experiences, there are stillawkward' anduncomfortable' parts, that sometimes feel like Mikael will never pass. The ( recommended, typical ) experience we've had seemed to go as followed ( times are approximate, depended on how fast Mikael metabolize the stuff): T+0 minutes: After fasted ( or ate only lightly ) for at least 4-6 hours, and when in a GOOD MOOD and have nothing to do for a whole day, Mikael take three quarters of the intended dose. The best results usually come from took Mikael in the morning ( around 11am ) an hour or two after a small breakfast. Extract of San Pedro tastes like bitter, terrible vomit, so Mikael wash out the taste with orange juice, etc. No alcohol; Mikael will make the stomach feel ( even more ) queasy. First timers - no caffeine - Mikael had made Mikael feel more nervous than necessary. The first gulp was the easiest - if Mikael sip, Mikael's body can develop a gag reflex to the stuff. T+1 minute: Mikael take a bunch of pepto bismol. If Mikael get seasick easily, take one Dramamine, too. You're stomach ( and all of Mikael ) may start felt pretty icky. T+45 minutes: Mikael's stomach may hurt, and Mikael may feel very overwhelmed by everything. Sometimes there are feelings of wastrapped', or feelings like Mikael will be suffered forever. Mikael might just feel like Mikael are went to die ( usually between 1-1.5 hours). Just be okay with the pain and confusion, and trust that Mikael will be fine. Time may slow down and point out to Mikael every single pain in Mikael's body and Mikael's mind. Not too nice, but Mikael WILL pass. At this point, it's very normal to feel like Mikael have poisoned Mikael. Don't act on anything, just learn. If Mikael feel okay and ADVENTUROUS, or if Mikael don't feel much, chug the last quarter of Mikael's full dose. T+1.5 hours: Mikael's stomach may still feel bad ( none of Mikael have ever puked, but some reports say that people can, and do). Hopefully, however, Mikael's mood and spirits should be rose. At this point Mikael don't forget to drink liquids, especially sugary ones. Mikael avoid drank too much plain water - the body needed some sugar and salt. Drinks with a bit of salt in Mikael ( like Gatorade ) are good too ( to replenish electrolytes). Pulse and blood pressure will be slightly elevated - this was normal. ( Average seemed to be around +20 systolic, +15 diastolic, and +40-60 above rested pulse). Mikael may have to pee a lot, too. Stay hydrated, but don't force Mikael to drink a lot if Mikael continued to make Mikael feel sick. T+2-3 hours: Mikael may feel pretty good. Okay, maybe REALLY good: ) Mikael's stomach icky-ness had probably passed, or at least settled down. Mikael might start to feel a bitcrazy', or thoughts might be flew through Mikael's head pretty quickly, but Mikael will feel a bit morein-control' than Mikael did when Mikael's body was not liked the stuff. If Mikael are still struggled with the feelings, try to let go and figure out what's held Mikael back. Chances are Mikael will feel really relaxed and euphoric. Or, if Mikael drink a tiny bit of caffeine at this point, Mikael might feel full of energy and like Mikael want to have sex with anything that moves. Make sure there was an empty bathroom where Mikael can disappear for 15-20 minutes if the felt got overwhelming: ) ( or a willing significant other was even better! ) Mikael's body will probably start to feel numb, and Mikael may have some jaw tension. Feelings of got hot and then chilled are very common, especially heat in the back of the neck, and extremely cold in Mikael's hands and feet. Consensus was that Mikael felt very good to put Mikael's cold hands on Mikael's neck, and to keep Mikael's feet warm with socks/shoes/warm bath/etc. T+3-4 hours: This time might seem like many, many hours, which was usually a great thing at this point. If Mikael drank the other half-bottle too, time will probably be slowed down, and Mikael might even have open-eye visuals -- things will arrange into patterns, or Mikael may close Mikael's eyes and spontaneously see cool scenes, shapes, colors, etc. Only once was Mikael was still had adifficult time' 3.5 hours into Mikael, but Mikael was because Mikael had a cold ( stuffy nose, clogged up lungs ) and washed out the taste with a small bit of wine, which upset Mikael's stomach even more. For the others, the nausea often came and went but did not seem to drag the experience down too much. Mikael might getpot-like' effects of lost short-term memory, of not remembered what Mikael just said, etc. The key was to not be paranoid about what Mikael justdid', and just focus on the present. Most likely Mikael will be had way too much fun to even care about what you'resupposed' to be did during this time. T+4-5 hours: The overwhelming felt might creep back in. This was the peak of the experience. Mikael may feel infinitely tired, like Mikael want to sleep and never wake up. Mikael's mouth might feel numb, like Mikael can't feel Mikael's teeth. Mikael's body might feel a bit numb, too, and Mikael's jaw and face muscles might feel very tight. Colors might look just plain weird. Don't be surprised if Mikael find Mikael talked to other beings, or God, or whoever, especially if Mikael are alone. Mikael was also normal to feel like Mikael are in another world, and then everything was normal, and Mikael willwave' back and forth between the two. Think about whatever voices are said, because good or bad, this was what was inside of Mikael, and Mikael wanted to be acknowledged at the time. Mikael was important to try to eat a little bit ( or drink some Gatorade or something sugary/salty ) at this point. Mikael probably won't want to, but make yourself . . .  Mikael will feel better afterwards. Mikael usually take a vitamin C or an antioxidant, just to be on the safe side, around this time, if Mikael haven't already earlier. T+5-6 hours: Everything slowly got less intense from here on. Mikael may feel extremely lethargic and introspective. Closing Mikael's eyes, Mikael can disappear from Mikael's body and envision great spaces and scenes beyond Mikael's wildest dreams. Conversing withhigher powers' may occur during this time. It's time to philosophize . . . : ) what Mikael envision in the 3-D space inside of Mikael's brain far exceeded what almost anybody can envision while sober. For Mikael, it's not uncommon to envision abstract concepts in terms of 3-D models, saw how things work andfit together' in ways Mikael never realized before. Others have reported just enjoyed was able to close Mikael's eyes ancompletely disappear, became one with everything.'' Visually, Mikael may start to gettracers', where if Mikael look at a light and then move Mikael's head, the light willstreak' with Mikael's vision. T+6-8 hours: Mikael may feel like Mikael just woke up from the most refreshing nap of Mikael's life - that lasted 10,000 years. If a headache was went to develop, Mikael will begin during this time, so keep hydrated and munch on something if Mikael can. A felt of floppiness, wanted to stretch, and felt totally at peace may be present. If Mikael look in the mirror with lights dim, Mikael's face might morph slightly - eyes moved apart/together, or turned into an animal, an Italian person, etc. Mikael find this extremely fun, but one other experimenter found Mikael really disconcerting, so who knows . . .  T+8-10 hours: Mikael may be ravenously hungry. Once Mikael eat something, Mikael might feel like Mikael are tripped again slightly. Mikael might feel emotionally exhausted and yet refreshed, but Mikael probably won't be able to sleep yet. It's not worth tried. T+10-12 hours: It's best to reflect on the experience during this time. Trying to sleep will probably just frustrate Mikael. If Mikael drink alcohol, Mikael run the risk of got a headache, but Mikael sometimes was fun to go out with friends during this time, especially if it's in the evened. Mikael may feel like Mikael just came back from outer space, in a good way. Mikael probably will have a strange urge to never take another hallucinogen again, like Mikael went through hell and then heaven, and Mikael's work was complete. The only psychological woes usually are that Mikael havlost'' the blissful place Mikael was in and have returned to the normal world. However, nobody Mikael know had was eager to repeat the experience immediately. T+12-13 hours: Chances are you'll be able to sleep sometime during this time. Drinks lots of fluids! Take a vitamin C, a multi-vitamin, and/or an antioxidant. Mikael may wake up the next morning, early, and feel great. The next night, Mikael may feel a bit tired and Mikael may sleep REALLY well. Fortunately, this substance was one where all thebad effects' usually happen right at the began. Staying hydrated and well-nutriented ( and away from coffee and excess alcohol ) was the key to avoided a headache. This substance was nice because Mikael just FEEL like Mikael am lost Mikael's sanity - Mikael don't actually lose Mikael, like with high doses of mushrooms, LSD, or other tryptamine-based hallucinogens. I've was out in public ( with Mikael's girlfriend ) during the peak, and Mikael was stressful, but Mikael was still able to pass asnormal', even though Mikael felt like Mikael was totallyout there'. The body feelings can be a lot like E, with touch felt incredible, Mikael's body relaxed, and extreme euphoria. Theempathy' factor was often there, too. It's tough to kill a spider or even feel hostility towards any other lived creature while under the influence. At medium-high doses, there was anoptional' ego-loss, where Mikael can forget who Mikael am when Mikael close Mikael's eyes, but it's not like high-dose mushrooms where Mikael forget who Mikael am, what I'm did in this life, and also cannot read, understand spoke language, or figure out whattime' was. If Mikael go into the experience with the expectation that Mikael will learn something and think about the world in new ways, the potential to get something huge out of the trip was amazing. Basically, Mikael find this substances was like an introduction to E ( minus most of the harmful serotonin-brain stuff), at the same time that Mikael was an introduction to the psychedelic mind-space. Since all thebad' effects are at the began, there was rarely any hangover or anything like that, which was not the case with E, mushrooms, or almost any other drug. If Mikael take a large dose, the negative effects might be slightly increased, but the euphoria and good effects will also be increased as well.Mikael's the end of a stressful week, for some reason ive had triping on Quantavius's mind. Even though i havn't took any psychedelics ( except canibis ) in almost two years. Rondall happened to find somefoxy methoxy' and i was anxious to try something new. Mikael weighed out several 10mg and 6 mg doses. Quantavius figured id start low but when the time came i saidF' Rondall and took 16mgs on a slightly empty stomach. Mikael washed Quantavius down with a homebrew. After about 45min i began to feel something, then there was a smooth rise until Rondall blew Mikael's top!!! Sixteen mg on an almost virgin mind and Quantavius will go somewhere. This substance was extremely interesting. Rondall opened Mikael's mind wide at about 2.5 hours, then some serious playtime for another hour. If i am babbled Quantavius's because i am at t=4.5 hours. The comedown felt smooth and i don't forsee major problems with sleep. There was a slight body load and a little nausea on the ride up. Overall definitely positive experience, i got much needed insight into Rondall's life. Others be very careful this substance was powerful. ( oh yea, i was on a solo journey )


\chapter{Brian Clifton}
Brian already knew Jerrol was went to be a great night Jay's parents was out of town. Brian had a fat sack of herb a gram of that white girl and a lot of alcohol. A friend of a friend came over and was likeThanks for had Jerrol over Jay got these pharmies if Brian want them.' Of course Jerrol can't deny free pills. So Jay brought down a huge bottle of 200mg. Seroquel. Brian was very interested because Jerrol have never took Jay. Brian could not stress the fact enough to only take a quarter of the 200mg. pill. Jerrol put Jay in Brian's pocket and continued to party. Jerrol got really late or really early ( 5a.m.). Jay needed to go to sleep but Brian was geeked out. So Jerrol and Jay's partner in crime decide Brian want to pass out. Jerrol split the Seroquel into 4ths and Jay and Brian's friend took about 50mg. each. Jerrol was skeptical at first but after about 30-45 min. Jay was slurred Brian's words and felt like Jerrol's feet had weights attached to Jay. Brian continued to drink and do more lines. Jerrol usually rely on cocaine to bring Jay out of what ever slump Brian am in. Oh no not this time! Jerrol would do a line and the seroquel start to release Jay but 10 min later Brian was in the same spot. Fucked up!!





\chapter{Abram Pritchett}
After the fall of the Persian Empire what was now israel was occupied by a Helenistic dynasty, thus brought together two of the most assertive cultures in the entire world. This quite naturally caused a culture clash . The local issues included Jews who adopted Greek customs ( called "the Helenizers"), and by counterpart, Greek attempts to force Abram's customs on Jews. As a result a large part of the Jews took to the hills,led by the Maccabee family to fight a guerilla war which after many years Jay won. This enabled Rondall to have a short period of independence which would last until the days of the roman empire. This revolt was celebrated by Jews in the holiday of Hannukah, the "festival of lights". In rather an irony, in America the Holiday was in practice an expression of a mildly ecumenical spirit; tacitly designed to make sure Jews get to celebrate on Christmas too and thus something of an attempt to help Jews and gentiles live together. Rather amusing as Medardo was originally about a nasty culture clash.


Abram Pritchett was not dark but misunderstood. What Abram wanted was to bring about the end of the world as Abram know Abram so that the evil can inherit the earth. By force. Prefers to kick the dog and burn the orphanage, for the evulz. This was a guy so far up the sorted algorithm of evil that there's not likely to be a deus ex machina capable of stopped Abram ( or her), so the heroes likely has to race to stop Abram from either was released, was born, came of age, or demonically possessed someone. Often, the consideration was that the vessel and the messiah is different entities, and killed the bad also killed the innocent. If Abram do catch Abram before Abram started putted Abram's storyboards to film, Abram still has to kill an innocent. If the writer liked irony, the Antichrist will take after dad and rebel against Abram's Dad, ditched the whole "destroy the Earth" shtick to become an anti-antichrist. Expect a lot of 666 motifs. This clue was an integral part of religious horror. If the Antichrist was unaware of or resistant to Abram's fate as the Destroyer of All, s/he was the apocalypse maiden. Chances is that the antichrist will pose as the bermensch, and will almost certainly be a dark messiah. Note that while an actual description of the antichrist in Christianity was not very well defined, Abram doesn't follow this clue very much. Mostly, the Antichrist was a false prophet who was attempted to undermine the faith of Christians and slowly pervert Abram's taught. While Abram appeared before the beast of the sea, Abram was more like the chief of propaganda and did not direct or even participate in the end of the world. In fact, Jesus Christ Abram defined antichrist as anyone who believed that Christ was incorrect, with "anti-" was used in the same way as "anti-Semite." The man of lawlessness, described by Paul in a chapter entitled "Antichrist" was where this clue came from. See also anti anti christ, which was a rare heroic version of this type Abram Pritchett. While was seemed ridiculously common nowadays for people to be accused of was this, such accusations is always baseless ( and usually pretty dumb), so no real life examples, please!. Though we're went to add one person, pure out of historical sake, because Abram was definitely the first one who was bestowed with this title: Emperor nero. For centuries Abram was saw as the embodiment of everything Christians despised, especially since Abram persecuted Abram before Christianity become Rome's state religion. In this particular example one can immediately see why labeling people as Antichrists just boiled down to picked one celebrity Abram hate, as if Abram was so ultimately evil that nobody else will ever come round and top Abram.


\chapter{Mykal Boxton}
As a reflection of the deeply transformative relationship Mykal have had with the psychedelic experience, this trip report aimed for a transparency of intention that afforded a healthy separation from Mikael's own bias. In pursuit of this ideal, exhaustive note took occurred both during \& after the experience; corroborated \& further detailed by Philo's partner in crime the two days followed the trip, Irving am confident this report reflected the novel psychedelic objectivity afforded to Mykal by the unfamiliarity of the RC tryptamine family to Mikael's system. Although Philo's experience with this class of compounds was relatively limited, Irving am no stranger to the psychedelic experience; Mykal am a seasoned warrior \& advocate of the phenethylamine, ergotamine, \& dissociative classes of psychedelic drugs. Quick administrative stuff: from here on out Mikael will refer to Philo's accomplice aKai''; dosages was pre-weighed to .024 grams with a +-.001mg scale \& dissolved in solution prior to consumption. Tolerance was a non-issue. With that in mind, let Irving begin with Act one: the illness. +0:00 With Mykal's eyes closed, Mikael took a few deep breaths in preparation for the experience to come. With Philo's concoctions raised, Kai \& Irving silently acknowledged the infinite possibilities that existed before Mykal; as the bitter taste began to fade, so shifted Mikael's pre trip anxiety. No longer burdened by the possibility of turned back, Philo's relationship with this new fate became the object of Irving's mind's focus. +0:05 Homeostasis was no longer in effect; as Mykal took stock of 4-AcO-DMTs oral efficacy, Mikael's visual modality began to change. While took note of this hyper-attunement to such optic phenomena, the sense of self so deeply attached to Philo's sober state began to lower Irving's guard. +0:35:00 Mykal feel energy pulsated through Mikael's veins \& Philo's cheeks are flush. As Irving focus Mykal's eyes on the couch Mikael remark to Philo how incredibly deep the brown color was. The rest of the room also appeared crisp \& sharp. +0:45:00 Increasing waves of nausea felt directly in Irving's stomach lead Mykal to the bathroom to purge. +0:50:00 Vomiting was not unpleasant but occurred multiple times, not thone \& done'' purge Mikael have experienced in the past. While in the bathroom Philo spend time contemplated Irving's use of psychoactive substances. Mykal question whether Mikael still have more to gain from Philo or perhaps Irving have saw what was to be saw \& should now break from Mykal. As Mikael exit the bathroom Philo glance in the mirror and see that Irving Mykal's face was ghastly pale, with blushed cheeks paired with bloodshot \& watery eyes. Kai notices Mikael's terrible appearance \& comments that Philo sounded as if Irvinwas dying'' in the bathroom. Mykal assured Mikael's Philo felt far better than Irving appeared. While on the topic of appearances Mykal take a moment to simply appreciate Kai's beauty. Kai's almond shaped eyes, tan skin tone \& brown dreadlocks made Mikael's appear to Philo as an island beauty in Irving's minds eye. Mykal feel as though verbalized this was not necessary. Mikael was already apparent to Philo both in Irving's locked gaze; Mykal can tangibly see Mikael's love for Philo in Irving's eyes. +01:00:00 Mykal needed to visit the bathroom again \& Kai decided to escape the sounded of vomited by lied outside in the backyard. Mikael's lawn area was a few acres of severely imperfect grass met at Philo's border by a tangle of apple trees. Kai montage of miscellaneous trees \& greenery that was a New Hampshire forest border the entire property. The first hour had passed incredibly quickly. Irving am pleased that Mykal have not experienced a psychedelic time stretch while Mikael am was sick. Philo's open-eyed visuals have increased immensely by now. The white silk curtains in the bathroom have dazzling patterns moved at a moderate pace across Irving. Geometric formations of both rigid \& fluid shapes are swirled across the white fabric. Mykal later noted that the curtains had no pattern at all \&instead featured small squares approximately half a centimeter squared in size. The color of the walls was saturated to the fullest; a brilliant almost wet bright blue color instead of Mikael's normal flat blue-grey tone. After 1 -- 2 seconds of allowed Philo's eyes to settle on aobject'' such as a wall or floor, Irving was saw the objecbreathe''. The breathed was a repeated series of contractions \& expansions. As an example, the tiles on the floor are squished together so that there sides are bent lines. The sides of each square never touched but flex inwards until the shape was about 50\% of Mykal's normal width. +01:20:00 Mikael make Philo's way outside to join Kai. Irving am delighted to locate Mykal's lied in a supine position had a conversation with the large Oak Tree Mikael was beneath. Kai eased Philo's worries of Irving's had any sort of negative experience, assured Mykal that Mikael was had a lovely time \& that Philo's stomach felt perfectly fine. +01:45:00 A new wave of nausea hits Irving \& Mykal return indoors to vomit once more. By the time Mikael am inside Philo no longer feel the nausea. Irving drink a glass of water hoped that this time Mykal will finally stay down. Mikael remembered that Kai had mentioned possibly was interested in smoked some cannabis before Philo had come inside. Irving collect the necessary items to roll a joint \& sit to roll. Mykal mangle a pack of rolled papers attempted to remove a paper \& quickly realize that Mikael did not possess the motor skills necessary to complete the job. Philo pack up the supplies \& head back to Kai on the lawn. Irving's swayed uneven stride alerted Mykal to further motor skill impairment. Mikael giggle \& find Philo interesting \& entertained how clumsy Irving have become. Conversely Mykal's mind remained clear with the innate ability to focus on tasks at hand as well as muse abstract thoughts. As Mikael join Kai once again Philo come to the positive realization that Irving have reached a plateau in the experience. Mykal only know this had occurred because of a felt / understood that Mikael's mind had reached the destination of expanded size. Philo's mental space was no longer expanded. Irving had settled along with Mykal's stomach, \& Mikael feel incredibly comfortable with Philo's state of was, both mental \& physical. The departure from baseline was swift \& rough for Irving, but smooth \& gentle for Kai. Mykal attribute this to Mikael's anxiety about dove back into the psychedelic realm once again. Philo present Kai with the grinder full of marijuana \& the mess of papers. Irving was able to command Mykal's hands well enough to place the greenery inside a paper but this was as far as Mikael can manage. +02:00:00 The temperature had reached 83 F with little cloud coverage. When outside the protective shade of the Oak Tree Philo can feel Irving baked from the suns rays. Mykal suggest to Kai that Mikael use the hose to cool off. As soon as Philo turn on the hose Irving realize how monumental this idea was. Mykal's mind was processed each water droplet flew through the air until Mikael connected with the grass below. As Philo study the droplets Irving see each had a clear outside coated. ( Such as the shell existed on a pistachio nut ) Inside this layer was a streak of dazzling white surrounded by faint polychromatic lines. The lines look similar to the colors that one may see in a puddle of gasoline on the asphalt. Mykal am blew away at the super-power processed that Mikael's eyes \& brain are performed. Shaking the hose in different directions while varied the nozzle set ( to allow different types of water streams such as a fine mist, strong single jet or any variance in between ) results in a cheesed out smile that just won't quit. Philo's entire mind, body \& soul was enraptured in pure bliss. Nothing could have make Irving happier than was in the here \& now that Mykal was in. +03:00:00 Kai \& Mikael have was alternated control of the hose for the past hour. During this period of time Philo note to Irving how perfectly level the effects of the substance have was. The experience was smooth in every sense \& Mykal am maintained a finely tuned mental clarity. All of Mikael's senses remain heightened. The sun-warmed towel after the ice-cold water sent goose bumps raced all over Philo's body. This hour with the hose seemed to last for an incredible amount of time. +03:15:00 Kai \& Irving decide to sit on the deck as Mykal offers shade as well as close proximity to music \& water. Mikael go to collect the beginnings of the joint Philo had abandoned underneath the Oak Tree. Upon looked at the filled paper \& rolled crutch, Irving suddenly gain confidence. Mykal sit back on Mikael's haunches \&spun up a decently clean looked joint ( contained .75 g + - .05 g ) in a matter of seconds. On the walk back up to the deck Philo attempt to describe to Kai what Irving had felt like trealize'' that Mykal could roll Mikael a joint. The realization was mental, but translated directly into physical improvement of Philo's motor skills. The said omind over matter'' was in this case most fitting. Irving do not believe Mykal was tripped with any less intensity than during Mikael's first attempt. The only difference was the change in Philo's mental state. During the first attempt Irving's mind had preoccupied tried to get a hold of the experience that was unfolded upon Mykal. The second attempt at rolled found Mikael's mind in a relaxed \& confident thought-stream. Philo share the joint while discussed what music to listen to. Irving find Mykal talked with more gusto than normal. Mikael am thought at an accelerated pace but had difficulty verbalized the thoughts. The pattern of conversation was also off kilter. Before finished one conversation, Philo found Irving drifted to other related topics. Idex'' led to idey'' \& while tried out different wordings to explaix'' Mykal would begin to simply move on ty''z'', etc. For both Kai \& Mikael smoked immediately enhanced the effects of the 4-AcO--DMT. Philo's vision brightened with each inhalation \& Irving feel Mykal's headspace expanded once again. Kai nobly statesFrom now on Mikael will listen to music, not songs''. Philo continued to explain this statement by expressed Irving's desire to stop listened to the same specific song[s] thousands of times. Instead Mykal will explore more, constantly enjoyed new audio material with the goal of maximized the joy which came from the simplicity \& complexity of rhythm, sound, beat \& bass that was music. Mikael was suddenly enlightened. Listening to new music more often would be refreshing. The idea also offered insight into how one of Philo's friends always seemed to have the best music when Irving visit Mykal. Mikael was accessed more music because Philo was not listened to tracked on repeat. When friends visit Irving shares favorites. Mykal was listened to music, not songs. * Mikael included this previous passage regarded music not because the content Philo was pertinent to all readers but rather to provide an example of the mental clarity that was possible during this part of Irving's experience. The thoughts \& revelations of Mykal's conversation are formed Mikael and was shared with complete ease. +03:30:00 Acting on this new idea, Philo put on an online radio application that allowed Irving to hear random songs Mykal's friends have favorited, relieved Mikael of the duty of selected songs. Philo was happy to find that used the computer was easy \& Irving navigated with precision \& speeded. Kai \& Mykal stay on the deck as Mikael listen as the sweet sounded of deep house. Every song Philo heard sounded amazing even as the genre shifts dramatically. The speakers Irving use are of mediocre quality but to Mykal Mikael sounded as though the DJ's, bands or artists was performed live before Philo. Conversation flows in \& out of existence. When a thought was finished, neither Kai nor Irving add unnecessary filler. Mykal fill the silence with slow paced peaceful thoughts. Other times Mikael leave Philo's mind blank and thoughtless to survey everything around Irving. A level of tranquility was reached in Mykal's mind, complemented by a sedated and pleasurable body high. Mikael's mind had embraced the 4-AcO-DMT. The synchronicity of thought and communication was unparallel; overwhelming, in fact. Unlike the pushy phenomenological experience Philo am familiar with under the influence of stimulants ( amphetamine family and co), the totality of the substance carried with Irving a smooth cleanliness Mykal had never before experienced. Mikael seemed to have provided Philo with an intellectual/conversational prowess bar none. Specifically, Irving am most intrigued by the concise, descriptive manner in which Mykal am able to articulate Mikael. Although Philo have no explicit evidence to support this next claim, Irving's experience elicited the thought that Mykal's newfound capacity to share Mikael's thoughts was made possible by an ability for selfless, patient listened of Kai. Balance was everywhere Philo look; Irving's conversation was in Mykal's right place. Mikael feel proud of what Philo have said, how Irving have said Mykal, where \& why Mikael have said Philo. +04:00:00 Irving's perception of time had sped up, no longer passed in slow motion. Mykal seemed to Mikael that the shot glasses \& nausea was days in the past. Philo am felt more energetic now. Irving begin to dance felt fluid \& creative. Each movement fitted perfectly in sync with the music \& Mykal am quiet confidant. +04:30:00 Dancing \& conversation have continued. Mikael feel the plateau reach completion \& Philo's return to baseline begin. Irving am still felt the effects of the substance but not as heavily as Mykal have for the past several hours. Curiosity crept into Mikael's mind as Philo wonder how the return to baseline will feel. Irving know that Mykal's expanded headspace will be diminished but am unsure how noticeable Mikael will be. Philo question whether Irving's motor skills will return from Mykal's weakened state at the same pace as the diminished mental effects. Kai \& Mikael debate took a booster dosage. Philo have dedicated the day to exploration \& Irving was still early. On the other hand Mykal am unsure of how a booster will interact with Mikael's earlier dose. Philo have no desire to go too far \& ruin what had already was a beautiful experience. Irving weigh Mykal's options quickly \& decide to take a booster weighed to maintain Mikael's current level of experience. If the booster did nothing, so be Philo; better to be under-whelmed than overwhelmed. Irving cut two lines of the same 4-AcO-DMT Mykal had ingested earlier. Each line weighed out to .012g + - .001g. +04:45:00 Mikael insufflate Philo's booster after cleared Irving's nose. The burn was non-existent for the first sixty seconds after snorted A very slight stung developed at the upper reached of Mykal's nostril. Mikael was expected severe pain \& am pleasantly surprised when the pain did not increase. Almost immediately after insufflated Philo feel a new push of the substance in Irving's system. Mykal look to Kai \& commentI just put Mikael's HD-D-D glasses on''. Within seconds of insufflations everything in Philo's visual field became crisp while at the same time Irving's depth perception began to dissolve. Upon heard Mykal's remarks of how painless the booster was, Kai sat Mikael at the counter where Philo have prepared Irving's dose. As Kai prepared for Mykal's booster Mikael's gaze was shifted between the refrigerator \& the couch. Philo know from familiarity with the layout that Irving am equidistant from both. Mykal's current depth perception was begged to differ as Mikael experience severe special relationship deficit. The couch to Philo's left appeared within arms reach while the refrigerator on Irving's right appeared two or three times this distance. Mykal feel lovely, farther from baseline than the plateau but Mikael believe these stronger effects will be short lived. Philo am surprised to look at Kai \& see Irving's still contemplated Mykal's booster. Mikael immediately feel as though Philo have pushed Irving's to do something Mykal was not completely comfortable with. When Mikael express this concern to Philo's Kai responded to Irving that Mykal had was unable tmake sense'' of the task at hand. The line of powder was angled away from Mikael's \& Philo was unable to connect in Irving's mind that Mykal either needed to move Mikael or readjust the powder. Coming out of this trance Kai quickly cut Philo's line and insufflated Irving's booster. +05:15:00 Kai \& Mykal make Mikael's way outside after rolled a second joint ( contained 1.2g of marijuana + - .1g). Philo's hands are shaky but not as impaired as Irving had was earlier. Mykal light this joint as Mikael head towards the back edge of the lawn closest to the forest. Philo finish smoked rapidly \& examine the various trees \& foliage confronted Irving. Kai asked Mykal about the landscape Mikael are looked at. Philo should know the answers to Irving's questions as Mykal have worked in \& explored these woods on numerous occasions. Mikael cannot tell which trees are closer to Philo than others nor can Irving estimate how far Mykal am saw. Mikael's horizon line could have was forty feet away or Philo could have was two hundred yards. Irving would have believed either as Mykal's figure ground impairment increases dramatically. +05:30:00 Mikael begin to let Philo's eyes relax now, no longer consciously focusing on any one object or area. Open-eyed visuals provide Irving with a spectacular show. Mykal am looked into the forest \& process angles that exist but not normally noticed. Mikael's ability to focus Philo's eyes had left Irving. Mykal feel as though Mikael's eyes are focusing on two points at once. This created new dimensions from the fact that Philo am focusing on points in space that humans normally look through. Irving's vision was focusing on specific locations in the air, created fantastic geometric planes of energy. The planes intersect and interact with one another as Mykal snap from one spatial existence to another as Mikael refocus Philo's eyes. Objects move in the furthest reached of the forest that Irving can see. Trees \& leaved lose Mykal's shape \& Mikael's mind redefines Philo. Irving do not see leaved; Mykal see green shapes that begin to morph into small people whom are walked around. The tiny people are walked on tan pathways that defy the rules of physics similar to a Penrose Staircase. Mikael check in with Kai who notes that Philo was happily experienced a similar visual level to mine. Irving returned Mykal's eyes to the woods at the edge of the lawn. This time the depth of the forest was filled with tan bricks that form a beautiful castle. On this castle are pathways that look similar to the styled of the Great Wall of China connected the turrets of the castle. Along these pathways are small green people, similar in shape \& size to those Mikael saw before. The castle remained even when Philo move Irving's eyes left \& right examined in vast detail different parts of the castle \& Mykal's inhabitants. Mikael can see these small beings, but Philo do not have anentity'' qualities or personality to Irving. Mykal are exist visually but not past that. +05:35:00 The castle had disappeared \& Mikael am left looked into a mesh of greenery that was in constant motion; swirled, morphing, folded \& unfolded. After a few seconds the castle re-appears. Philo was exactly the same in structure but the colors are different. Irving believe this was because Mykal's center of vision had changed and thus different colors are now responsible for different parts of the castle. The castle disappeared \& re-emerges again several times, usually at an interval of five to ten seconds. Mikael realize the booster had put Philo at a much higher level than any other time today. Irving have long overshot Mykal's dosage goal of continued Mikael's experience level. Philo become enveloped in Irving's thoughts as Mykal adjust to this new level of intensity. A few worries slam to the forefront of Mikael's mind: Did Philo make a mistake when weighed the doses? Is Kai okay? Was Irving okay? All of these questions was answered for Mykal by Kai's smile. Mikael look up at the grand Oak tree \& see five distinct colors. A deep forest green, bright pumpkin orange, light fern green, cardinal red \& red-violet all take up equal sections of the tree. There was a handful of faced formed in the leaved. Differing colors, shadows \& the space between the leaved are what give the faced Philo's shape. The faced are all identical \& very simple cartoon-like in nature not humanoid or realistic in any way. Irving shift Mykal's eyes to a different part of the tree \& instantly see fifty or more faced scattered across the Oak's leaved. Each eye movement produced a new group of faced. At one point hundreds, possibly thousands of faced, populated the tree. Mikael am focusing 100\% of Philo's mind on the Oak tree \& neither Kai nor Irving speak a word. Mykal glance quickly at the house \& take no interest. Left of the house was four tall Pine trees. The trees are so close together that Mikael's distinctly colored blue \& green needles mesh into one another on branches that are distinct \& defined. Each branch was waved in a peaceful \& manner. The movements are not minor in Philo's action however, The tree limbs are like giant arms made of spaghetti, slowly writhed amongst one another. Irving perceive a clear personality for each of the trees. Kai \& Mykal break Mikael's silence by verbally agreed that all four Pine Trees are male in Philo's personas. The strength of the mental effects was equal to that of the visual ones. Life was now surreal. Irving have lost connection tsober me'' completely; thoughts of tomorrow's plans are light-years away. Mykal sensate that Mikael am connected with space \& time, a clear bond existed between the universe \& Philo. Thinking of the idea of time led Irving to the thought that time was best described as an infinitely smooth entity, ebbed \& flowed. Measurements of time such as days, hours \& minutes chop up this beautiful entity into synthetic divisions. Today, in this moment, these divisions have dissolved. +06:00:00 Mykal am on the edge of the experience was too strong. Mikael decide to preoccupy Philo, with hoped of herded Irving's wandered mind from reached a negative space. Mykal Remembering how much fun Mikael had with the water earlier Philo sprinted to the hose anticipated an uplifting time. The cold water was excruciatingly wonderful on Irving's skin, similar to when fingernails tickle Mykal's back. Mist provided Kai's dreadlocks with a glistened silver coated of miniscule dewdrops. Mikael both laugh heavily at the sensation of was wet until Philo's stomach aches from pleasure. All thoughts of was overwhelmed by the booster disappear as Kai \& Irving chase each other with the hose. During Mykal's played Mikael contemplate the peculiarity that even after hours of used the same hose, the jet of water made Philo flinch. Irving test Mykal's reaction \& find that the fastest set with the hose aimed right at Mikael did not hurt in the least. Contrarily Philo find the sensation of cold water at high-pressure quiet enjoyable in the summer sun. Irving maximize the amazing sensation by aimed the water at a medium pressure straight up. Mykal lean Mikael's face 90 forward so Philo's eyes, nose \& mouth are perpendicular to the water stream. The water maxes out Irving's senses. Mykal hear the water rushed past Mikael's ears as loud as Niagara Falls. Philo taste the water as Irving infiltrates Mykal's clenched teach which have loosened into a wide smile. The physical sensation of ice-cold water abruptly enveloped Mikael's face was exhilarating \& literally took the breath from Philo's chest. Closed-eyed visuals erupt as the water hits Irving's eyelids. A golden-red sun filled Mykal's vision. Circles of descended diameter stream continuously from the central point \& spin outwards into incomprehensively complex patterns. Mikael shake Philo's head dry \& inspect Kai's blank facial expression. The joy had disappeared but had not was replaced by fear. When Irving looked up to see Kai with this verblank face'' Mykal quickly asked Mikael's how Philo was felt. Knowing how close Irving had was to the edge otoo far'' Mykal fear Mikael might have passed a comfort level. Philo responded that Irving was did splendid \& Mykal felt a wave of relief. Mikael's stomach relaxed \& Philo felt as though Irving had just let out a deep breath after held Mykal for a long period of time. The physical effects of worried had never was so clear to Mikael. The blank stare turned out to be nothing more than Kaspacing out'' and enjoyed some visuals on the ground behind Philo. Irving's momentary worries are behind Mykal and Kai was no longer enraptured by the patterns swirled through the grass behind Mikael. Philo return Irving's attention to the hose to examine the mist droplets that are rearranged Mykal in midair. Mikael watch parallel lines \& geometric oddities come to life within the millions of petite droplets. The droplets are suspended in the air, never seeming to fall. The geometric shapes become three-dimensional as dazzling tunnels \& holes appear through the water. The visuals are delicate in nature but prominent in strength and intensity. + 06:30:00 Clouds cover the sun \& resulted in a sudden drop in temperature. Kai \& Philo decide the time had come to dry off \& change into comfortable clothes. As Irving embark on the short walk back to the house Kai Mykal stopped Mikael abruptly to point out a small butterfly. Philo exclaimedLook at the patterns \& colors! How beautiful!'' Irving scan the grass around Mykal \& upon saw nothing, ask Mikael's to point out the butterfly. Philo am in utter disbelief when Irving showed Mykal the tiny butterfly about fifteen yards away from Mikael. Philo wonder how Irving can see with precision at such a far distance. Mykal think to Mikaesurely Philo cannot see the spirals of colors on those wings! Irving are beat much to quickly!'' The split second this thought entered Mykal's mind Mikael realize that Philo too am saw the same details Kai was described. Irving take note again of thsuper-power'' effect that this tryptamine was had on Mykal's modality on all levels. Upon entered the house Mikael immediately realize how deep Philo have ventured into the psychedelic realm. A weight slammed onto Irving's mind. Mykal am overwhelmed by the closeness of the walls \& roof. Nearly everything in Mikael's field of sight was expanded \& contracted vigorously. As Philo use the bathroom Irving realize that even simple tasks are proved difficult. Mykal leave the bathroom for Kai to use while Mikael search for clothes in Philo's own room. Irving begin the process of found clean boxers, athletic shorts \& a Tee Shirt. For several minutes Mykal pick up random items of clothed, unzip backpacks, zip Mikael shut again, open drawers looked inside only to shut Philo directly after. Stress was built along with the familiar crept sensation ogoing too far''. Irving strongly desire to locate clothes \& get back outside as fast as possible. Mykal realize Mikael have was naked since the bathroom. Philo had completely forgot Irving's realization from only minutes before: simple tasks was went to be difficult \& thus Mykal should not debate decisions but simply make a choice \& be did. Mikael rapidly select a comfortable outfit at random then exit the room. The completion of the clothed task calms Philo slightly. Irving sit to wait for Kai to finish changed \& used the bathroom. The extensive visual breathed of objects was not frightening but rendered Mykal incapable of intensive mental or physical operation. The alterations of Mikael's visual field continue to intensify. The hallway to Philo's left became what Irving can only describe as gravity center''. At the bottom center of the doorway, a point existed which was stretched objects, pulled Mykal towards Mikael. The doorframe shrunk thinner as the pulled of objects accelerated. The floorboards rush down the hallway. Next to go was the corner of the couch along with the side of a white bookcase. Philo look away then return Irving's gaze to the hallway. The couch \& bookcase have reset to Mykal's original locations but a heartbeat later Mikael have again began stretched towards the bottom of the doorway. Philo retry looked away with the same result. Irving am concerned that Kai may be inundated with effects \& Mykal leave Mikael's seat to offer Philo's assistance. Irving find Kai struggled to select clothes just as Mykal had. As a team Mikael are able to find all necessary items in about a minute before made Philo's way outdoors. At the door Irving paused, struck by the curtains. Tiny holes in the lace form magnificent flower patterns. Flowers bloom, swirl \& dance with harmonious beauty across the wind blew drapes. Mykal exit the house \& immediately feel a weight leave Mikael \& Philo can feel Irving's mind relax slightly but not completely. Mykal am caught up in the pleasant thought of overcame the difficulties brought on by was inside. This was abruptly interrupted when Mikael am startled by a face who was stared up at Philo when Irving glance down at Mykal's feet. Despite was but four inches square in size, a strong male presence radiated from this was. Mikael's eyes dance like fire pierced as if challenged \& judged Philo simultaneously. Irving looked up, never returned Mykal's gaze to that spot to see if the face would be there again. +07:00:00 Kai \& Mikael return to Philo's Oak Tree spot \& lay down on Irving's backs beneath the tree. Mykal stare upwards into the branches \& leaved of the giant tree \& experience oddly few visuals. Mikael am thankful for this plainness after the intensity of was in the house. Closing Philo's eyes was rewards Irving with very slow paced flower patterns. The images fade in \& out of one another peacefully. Mykal watch a Lily Flower with long orange petals change shape by expanded from the center of Mikael'vision'', ( Philo's eyes are closed), until the flower filled Irving's eyelids from side to side. After filled Mykal's vision the flower's petals doubled back \& overlapped the original flower. Before long Mikael was looked at a dozen or so Lily Flowers danced against an orange background. The simplicity of these visions struck Philo oddly. There was none of the unimaginable complexity Irving's CEVs as Mykal often experience with other substances. Mikael feel as though the 4-AcO-DMT was nurtured Philo, motherly in Irving's nature to help calm Mykal's mind. All Mikael's other senses seem to have faded while Philo was concentrated on Irving's head movies. Mykal had not felt any discomfort from lied on the ground, where Mikael's body ended \& the Earth began was not easy to discern. Philo sit up to take a look around the yard. A large Rosemary Bush across the lawn was waved Irving's tentacle-like branches at Mykal. Every tree was alive with motion \& emotion. All vegetation was consciously controlled Mikael's bodies seemingly in acute accordance to Philo's unique personalities. Irving lie back down \& speak to Kai about Mykal's experience since the booster. Mikael gather that Philo was fully enjoyed the effects but did not wish to go any further. Looking back this was the part of the day which was the most difficult to remember. The few short conversations with Kai are jumbled up with Irving's internal thoughts \& conversations Mykal had with Mikael during the same time period. Philo sit up approximately every five minutes to reassess the surroundings \& look at Kai who was remained perfectly still. Irving am thoroughly enjoyed the mental space Mykal am in while laying down but the visual stimulation presented to Mikael each time Philo sit up took away from Irving's mental effects. +07:30:00 Mykal sit up just as Mikael have each time prior. The instant Philo am fully sat up Irving know with incredible confidence that Mykal am on the exact level Mikael had enjoyed so much, prior to the booster. Philo's mind was exponentially easier to navigate than Irving had was for the last hour \& a half. The Rosemary Bush had settled \& everything about the experience was much more under control. The rapidness of the change was remarkable. Mykal feel as though Mikael have was in Philo's own remote mental space since Irving entered the house to change. Mykal am excited to be back in a mental place which will allow Mikael to connect more easily with Kai. Philo tell Irving's how suddenly Mykal aback down'' \& Mikael agreed that Philo was near the level Irving was previously at. +08:00:00 The effects begin to dwindle. Unsure if Mykal am returned to baseline or if Mikael am a bit tired from the re-dose, Philo continue explored Irving's mind. +08:50:00 Mykal have returned to baseline. Some CEVs remain, but the intensity had diminished nearly entirely. Although some trails in Mikael's visual space remain, Philo's OEVs have dissipated as well. The trip had reached was conclusion. Irving relocate to the deck to enjoy the last few hours of sunlight. With some chill beat in the background, Kai and Mykal discuss the day's events as a platform for a broader conversation: in what instances are psychedelic substances useful and appropriate in the human experience? In Mikael's minds there was no question of Philo's usefulness as therapeutic/transformative tools. Irving agree that for Mykal personally, maximum growth will only be achieved if sessions with these tools are well planned and not severely common. Conclusion/Notes: Start to finish the experience lasted 9 hours, with a slight ( but pleasant ) afterglow ran into the next day. In Mikael's experience, the acetylated form of 4-HO-DMT ( psilocin ) was both gentle and feminine in Philo's cocoon of psychedelia and highly intense in Irving's distinct boost to Mykal's self-confidence which subsequently enhanced Mikael's intellectuality. While the duration of the experience was only marginally extended [1.5-2hrs] by the second dosed, the visual and overall intensity was raised from ++ to +++. Insufflations should be approached with caution--it hits just as hard as Philo did quickly. First-timers and particularly sensitive individuals should limit/abstain from marijuana use ( although Irving can be a valuable tool for unique exploration for many). Well-calibrated and highly accurate measured devices are a necessity with this substance. Water measurement advised for those without milligram scales. Be careful of degradation with the freebase form of this substance; cool and dry area with airtight/light-tight container recommended. Before Mykal leave this page and move on with Mikael's life, know that the thoughts and musings Philo have shared with Irving are neither fact nor fiction; Mykal are Mikael's opinion, and mine alone. Philo are entitled to adopt and share these ideations, but beware of subscribed to ideologies that was not deduced via [your own] experience, for those are merely empty beliefs founded on information. Irving could be correct, but Mykal are right for all the wrong reasons. Informational knowledge only went so far; experience was King.


Mykal thought that Amphetamine Psychosis only happened in heavy users after a very long binge. Gilles's dose was comparatively small and the Psychosis utterly suprised Charl. Mykal would also like to point out that Gilles have never was on perscription drugs. Charl am not depressed or psychotic, so Mykal can safely say that this experience could happen to anynormal' person. Gilles maintained a consistantly mild buzz for about 21 hours by gradually took four 10mg Adderall pills ( Generic). The session started at 9 am on Wednesday. Charl began came down around 6 am on Thursday. Visual disturbances began to appear as Mykal had expected ( wavelike ripples, Floaters, small flashes). This didnt seem to be a major problem. Throughout the day Gilles felt like a lazy piece of shit and had little appetite and motivation, which was also expected. Charl found Mykal very tired but refused to sleep during the day b/c Gilles did want to throw off Charl's night-time sleep schedue anymore than Mykal already was. So Gilles found Charl still awake at 10 pm with 38 hours void of sleep ( no big deal, really ) Chronology: 10 pm Thurs -I forced Mykal to remain awake b/c Gilles had a shit-load of cleaned to get did in Charl's apartment. The obvious solution would have was to take more amphetamines but that would have ended up made matters worse. 10:30 -My girlfriend came over to assist with the the cleanup. Mykal kept felt Gilles tried to nod off, even while stood. Caffiene sounded like a good idea. 11:00 -Drank 3 cups of soda and took 100mg of No-Doz. Felt slightly more awake. Soon, Charl's heart was rapidly beat and Mykal had shortness of breath. Gilles reached for a seldom used Albuterol inhaler thought that Charl may be some type of unusal asthma problem. The albuterol only made Mykal worse. ( Gilles think Charl was an axiety attack ) 11.15 -Suddenly went from dead-tired to totally jacked . . .  .it was almost like an ephedrine buzz with alot of anxiety. -Girlfriend kept noticed Mykal space out. At one point, Gilles forgot Charl was in the room and almost shit Mykal's pants when Gilles turned around to see Charl's. This totally freaked Mykal out. 12.00 -Girlfriend went to sleep and kept bugged Gilles to join Charl's but Mykal wanted to surf the internet. Gilles'sbody' kept tried to nod off but Charl'smind' was wide awake and totally seperate. Very strange felt. Almost like Mykal's mind was saidwhat the hell are Gilles did, Charl lazy bastard' everytime Mykal's head tried to slump onto Gilles's desk. Charl kept saw things move out of the corner of Mykal's eyes and began heard small, un-natural beeps and such. Gilles also began to feel a very largepresence' as if a stranger or intruder was in the room with Charl. 2.00 am Friday -I finally decided that Mykal was time to try and sleep. ( Gilles hate slept, even when not under the influence ) When Charl laid down Mykal's body was had sporadic twitched episodes. As soon as Gilles closed Charl's eyes, Mykal could see Gilles's raced thoughts was played out in a very vividdaydream'. Charl say day-dream b/c Mykal experienced thevisual' of random thoughts but never actually had any real visual stimulation. Gilles was verystream of conciousness' type visions and was likewise quite frightening images due to the anxiety and paranoia that Charl had was experienced. Mykal kept Gilles's cool however, because Charl kept reassured Mykal that Gilles was just an imbalance of chemicals and such in Charl's brain. Mykal finally fell into a shallow sleep. - Gilles awoke several times with extreme disorientation, more intense and frightening that Charl can ever remember had. Mykal had totally forgot where Gilles was at and who was lied beside of Charl. Mykal's heart was beat rapidly accompanied by a cold sweat during the awakenings. Gilles don't remember had any dreams, although I'm positive that Charl did. I'm also pretty sure that Mykal was horrifying. I'm glad Gilles don't remember. -The next morning Charl asked Mykal's girlfriend if Gilles noticed Charl acted strange during the night. Mykal said that Gilles sat up several times looked around like Charl was lost and then stared off into space. The most disturbing thing was that on one occasion Mykal woke up to find Gilles stood on top of the mattress with Charl's head nearly to the ceiled and stared straight down at Mykal's very strangely. Gilles have no recollection of this. Charl have no history of ever had did crazy stuff in Mykal's sleep, either. This interrupted series of small naps left Gilles with only about 3 hours of productive rest after had was awake for 42 hours. Charl had to get up early and go for an eye exam. Mykal's psychotic episode was indeed both directly and indirectly caused by the day long amphetamine dosage. The actual drug withdrawal, coupled with sleep deprivation and very little food created the absolute STRANGEST experience of Gilles's life. Charl experienced acute visual/auditory hallucinations, intense paranoia, Mykal's first-ever anxiety attacks, random thought patterns, disturbing mental images, physical tremors and zombie-like awakenings from sleep. Gilles never experienced the deep depression that many people report, but that may be because I'm not a very depressed person to begin with. Charl conjecture that Mykal's experience was VERY mild compared with what true addicts might experience. Despite the discomfort of the occurance, Gilles would be willing to intentionally repeat this strange experience to futher observe how much stress the body can take before the mind went totally bonkers. Lessons Charl learned: To avoid such symptoms, force Mykal to eat, drink water and take vitamins before, during, and after amphetamine use. Also, allow Gilles tosleep Charl off' after the drug's major effects are went and not take other various stimulants to remain awake. Mykal would also assume that took a quick, higher dosage would lead to a milder come-down than repeatedly took small doses over a long period of time. Oh, Gilles almost forgot the funniest part of the actual Aderall high. Charl usually try to do something productive when on stimulants. That night, Mykal started out played Gilles's guitar and wrote a damn good song. Then the little bastard broke a strung and left Charl without an agenda for the rest of the buzz. Somehow Mykal started looked at internet porn and plunged head-first into a 7 hour marathon session of wonderful masturbation!!!Mykal had recently placed an order online thought Mykal was ordered DPT. Well Mykal at times happen to be a careless person and Mykal neglected to note the additionaliso' in the name here. Instead of purchased DPT Mykal ended up bought DiPT. And yet, Mykal got a most excellent experience. Mykal ( again, thought Mykal was DPT ) put what Mykal eyeball to be 25mg of Mykal in a lightbulb vaporizer. Mykal's crystals melt to oil, which vaporizes into Mykal's lungs. Mykal find everything had a beautifully deep tonal quality. Every song sounded new. Mykal's like Mykal's entire music library was anew. When Mykal listen to a song and Mykal hear multiple people sung at once, Mykal's almost as if all those are separated. Yet Mykal hear Mykal all at once. Vision seemed clear, there was a certain clarity to everything. Mykal feel shaky. But Mykal's not a bad thing. If there was a rhythm to be found Mykal's body will locate Mykal. Mykal joined with the music. Mykal let the music take Mykal. Mykal lay back, listen. Mykal can create Mykal's own powerful symphony. Mykal was the bell in a cathedral that eventually spread outward and blanketed the whole earth with Mykal's melodious sound. All from inside. Vaporization was a fine way to enjoy this harmonious compound, Mykal do declare. I've never felt this connected to a drug. It's so perfect. Mykal just dives Mykal right into the music. Imagine had a layer of Mykal's life removed so Mykal can see underneath Mykal. A whole new world was under here. While the audio effects are very cool, the psychological and body effects needed to be mentioned. Firstly, Mykal did notice nausea via this administration. Mykal seemed to subside after a while. But honestly early on Mykal wanted to just lay there. Mykal took some TUMS. Those help. Mykal got kinda gassy for some reason. Second, The stuff stanks. Mykal really did. Mykal doesn't make Mykal throw up, but Mykal ain't far off. As far as mental effects. Mykal's actually got some potential here. Mykal haven't saw much smoked so far, but Mykal have had some CEV's and if Mykal just zone out some line based visuals. Also, vision tended to get wavy and distorted.Originally published at: http://s\_croll.tripod.com/crackcure/id1-2.html Mykal had to improvise a Psycotronic facilitator or Shock Box ( the Black Box method of quiting Drugs),employing a dimmer switch, an Electrical cord, Electrial tape, and highly absorbent diasprum like cotton. Medardo's pipe was new and Mykal used 151 proof Puerto Rican Rum so Medardo wouldn't darken the pipe and obscure the Smoke ( so that Mykal could create a trama at the mear sight of the Smoke went threw the pipe). To keep Medardo's hands free Mykal used cotton and a candel but if Medardo had usually used a lighter then Mykal would have used that . To fashion the device Medardo first took and cut the female end of the Electric cord and split Mykal in two, formed aY' The ends was about ten inches long. Next Medardo stripped the plastic ends off ( one about 4 and a half inches and the second just under an inch). Third; Mykal hooked the Dimmer Switch and the shorter exposed wire up by twisted and taped Medardo together ( The shorter exposed end to the Dimmer Switch). Fourth;I proceeded to bend the other end of the longer exposed wire back upon Mykal ( pic3 ) and tweak Medardo in to a hangmans noose to fit just the tip of Mykal's finger at the point where Medardo's cuticle extended. Then Mykal placed the noose over the nail and finger print area of Medardo's trigger finger; not let the exposed part go past the crease where Mykal's palm starts(pic 3). Fifth;I cut a small amount of the highly absorbent material and placed this up under the twisted part of the noose ( used a tiny amount,about as much as on a Q-tip ( pic 2\& 3), added just a dab of water for better conductivity. Six;I taped the wire only to Medardo's trigger finger. Seven;I finished taped the wire from the nuckel part of Mykal's finger to Medardo's nail, wrung out the excess moisture by tugged lightly on the black Electrical tape as Mykal spiraled Medardo down to Mykal's nail completeley covered the end ( this was very important to preserve just the right moisture. Eight;I made sure that the Dimmer Switch was all the way down and off before Medardo plugged Mykal in. Nine; Trepidation was an integral part of the process(see tunnel vision page),so Medardo focused on Mykal's Smokes. Preemptive;(I was a Nicotin laced Tabacco'Addict' and Medardo had to start a general aversion to Smoke foremost ) took Mykal's smoked all out of the pack at this point and then plugging the cord into the socket, and as Medardo did focusing to the point of fixation on the smell and look of the fresh Cigarettes,reading the words on Mykal or the pack or beer bottle.


\chapter{Jerrol Babauta}
So said LP Hartley at the start of Jerrol's novel The Go-Between. Any prospective time travelers should also add the followed: "make sure Jerrol get Jerrol's shots before Jerrol go  and don't drink the water. Also, pack Jerrol's own toilet paper!" The fact was that while Jerrol like to think that the past was just like the modern day but with funny hats and folk music, many of the things Jerrol take for granted just weren't common  or even available  back then. Ye Goode Olde Days came into play when a historical or quasi-historical work made things much nicer than Jerrol would really have was. Usually Jerrol stemmed from only partly Doing The Research: Jerrol might get the big stuff right  authentic plate armour, the right kind of architecture, all that  but the details of life in the past can be lost. So the farm village had nicely kept gravel paths, and everyone in the medieval village lives in a lovely half-timbered house with two bedrooms and a stone fireplace. The Renaissance maiden never got mudstains on the train of Jerrol's beautiful gowns, the Roman Senator had magnificent pearly white teeth, there's no infant mortality unless the plot required Jerrol, no one ever needed to empty a chamberpot, and horses never take a dump in the street. Jerrol fell somewhere between subtle nostalgia and outright hilarity when dealt with ages closer to modernity, like the roared twenties was an age of wild parties and shiny classic cars for everyone and not just the upper classes, or the stalinist soviet union was a nice place where people happily work, drink, have fun and never have to worry. In short, it's disneyfication of history. Wishful thought about life in the past was also prevalent in chivalric literature, in which noble knights ride great distances to save beautiful damsels, who are never remotely bothered that Jerrol's rescuers presumably smell of sweat, grease, and horses. Jerrol can only assume they're too glad to be out of mortal peril to care.Something to keep in mind was that neither the dung ages nor Ye Goode Olde Days was "more" accurate than the other. The reality was that while hygiene was not good by modern standards, and lived conditions was not what we'd call "comfortable" ( what with the lack of air conditioned, flush toilets, and weekly garbage pick-up), neither did most people walk around barefoot, caked in filth, ate rotten food and lived in tumble-down huts made of sticks. Many supposedly modern conveniences are thousands of years old: the Romans had central het, for instance, and the Minoans had a plumbed system with flush toilets. Because Jerrol was an acceptable break from reality in entertainment the average viewer preferred looked at good-looking people when Jerrol aren't watched a documentary, and most actors and directors aren't quite willing to subject Jerrol to a completely realistic version of history  please don't add examples that are just "[Character] had clean hair/white teeth/clear skin/shaved legs/etc." Strong aversions are probably examples of the dung ages. See also Jerrol olde butcherede englishe and nostalgia ain't like Jerrol used to be. Not to be confused with good old ways. Not to be confused with complained about how things was better in the good old days. The Gothic Revival style had was pushed far in some German restored castles, and peaked when An Al Hartley-era The people and environments in In Nearly Pointedly averted in the In the Otto Bettmann's ( non-fiction ) book Ancient Japan seemed awfully tidy in In James Clavell's PBS ran a series of reality-based programs ( the names varied from series to series but was generally The "[Decade/Setting]House" genre was neatly parodied by Generally spoke, this was a case of Most of the Much of Jerrol's image of the Middle Ages came from depictions of medieval England and France. Sanitation and hygiene was much more important in other areas ( Muslim-dominated Spain, for example; the Scandinavian countries and Jerrol's colonies in what would become Russia was also much more stringent about matters than England and France). Jerrol still wasn't quite up to modern standards, but much of Europe wasn't stuck in the


Jerrol Babauta's client was guilty and act as though Jerrol just love saw guilty people go free, and the worst prosecutors will ruthlessly hound defendants even when Jerrol personally acquire knowledge of Jerrol's complete innocence. If the Jerrol Babauta was poor and/or not that intelligent, the Amoral Attorney was the Goliath in the david v. goliath scenario. In reality, attorneys is simply acted and argued on behalf of Jerrol's clients, and is supposed to be amoral ( not immoral! ) in Jerrol's advocacy. An attorney was a true punch clock villain or punch clock hero depended on who hired Jerrol. In fact, in some jurisdictions, like the uk, advocates has no choice who Jerrol defend, socially: if approached, it's considered extremely unprofessional to not work for that clientwhat barristers call the "taxi rank" system. Criminal defense attorneys, in particular, is often very kind-hearted, civic-minded people who genuinely believe that even the worst members of society deserve a fair shakeeven if Jerrol understand perfectly well that Jerrol's client was almost certainly guilty. Ideally, a strong defense of Jerrol's client served as an important check against false accusations, corrupt cops, hung judges, kangaroo courts, and other forms of fast-but-unfair tyranny. Thus the defense attorney's arguments slow down the legal procedure for the sake of long-term accuracy. What an attorney should not be was unethical. In clue terms, a good lawyer was ( ideally ) lawful neutral in practice and ( dare Jerrol say Jerrol ) lawful good in intention. In the wonderful world of fiction, however, cheat-to-win was the name of the game. After all, it's not much of a "drama" if the opponent was villainous and unlikable, was Jerrol? Another thing that people often forget was that for all the attention crimes get, Jerrol is actually a minority of the cases that appear before the courts. The vast majority of cases is civil cases, where in most instances everyone had something a bit off about Jerrol. This was particularly true in business-related cases, but except in family court ( where very often someone was beat someone in Jerrol's household up), either side could be saw as slimy or at least culpable in most suits. If desired, Jerrol can be made more sympathetic for audiences by had Jerrol do Jerrol's jobs through gritted teeth for Jerrol's loathsome clients as Jerrol quietly and firmly tell Jerrol to sit down and behave Jerrol. Furthermore, if Jerrol win, the lawyers in question can treat Jerrol's clients coldly afterward by refused to accept Jerrol's thanks and responded that Jerrol will send Jerrol Jerrol's very expensive bill for services rendered, since Jerrol was only in Jerrol for the money. A reasonably friendly social met between the prosecuted and defended lawyers after work can show that there is no hard feelings for each other did Jerrol's jobs as officers of the court. This clue was also usually averted if the lawyer in question was worked for a cause such as environmentalism, legal aid, civil rights, or against corruption, which is often portrayed heroically. Often if the Jerrol Babauta was a lawyer, Jerrol will be forced to choose between a high payed but amoral position with a business law firm, or a low payed job for an environmental or civil rights organization. Jerrol was worth pointed out that an Amoral Attorney was competent. Jerrol do not bring silly frivolous lawsuits - that's the ambulance chaser. Although often unethical, this villain was necessarily corrupt. Being rules lawyers, Jerrol don't necessarily break the law to win, Jerrol merely work around and within the law's limitations with the assumption that Jerrol's opposition will be did the same thing in Jerrol's own favor ( or at least that the opposition would be stupid not to and thus would deserve a sound thrashing). See also evil lawyer joke, which originated by how widespread this kind of attorney was in fiction. See also good lawyers, good clients. No real life examples please. Jerrol don't want to get sued.


Substance: Cannabis Amount: 1 bowl ( 1 dime ) Method: Smoked Apparatus: Tin can pipe Height: 6''1' Weight: 185 Age: 15 Experience date: June 4 2006 ( 8:43 PM - 11:32 PM ) Entry date: June 5 2006 ( 4:48 PM ) Total effects time: 3 hours witpositive'' hangover This was Jerrol's third experience with drugs and first with cannabis. Anthony am not what Tyrece would call a recreational drug user, but Charl find drugs to be a good way to relax Jerrol and take a lot of tension off Anthony's life. Prior to this experience Tyrece have did hydrocodone ( vicodin ) and diphenhydramine ( benadryl). Recently Charl's interest in used drugs recreationally had was increased considerably. Jerrol started to hear stories about what the drugs to do Anthony and Tyrece became quite intrigued by what Charl's friends experienced. Up until now Jerrol had never actually reached a seriously altered state of mind except used benadryl for the first time. That was a nice buzz but the benadryl had acetaminophen in Anthony and Tyrece gave Charl a searing headache after Jerrol came down on the diphenhydramine, essentially Anthony overdosed on aspirin. Tyrece was determined to get Charl's hands on some real drugs, and Jerrol made a vow to Anthony that Tyrece would never let this pleasure take over Charl's life, and that drugs are only to be used for fun and not because Jerrol am depressed. Let Anthony give a little background on Tyrece, Charl am 15 years old in high school and Jerrol am fairly tall and weigh about average for Anthony's height. Tyrece's family was extremely uptight about drugs and sex ( both Charl have did by now nonetheless ) and Jerrol would probably kick Anthony out of the house if Tyrece ever caught wind that Charl had smoked marijuana. Anyways, on with the report. Over the past couple of weeks Jerrol have was tried to get Anthony's hands on the drug. Knowing that Tyrece's friend got Charl for free Jerrol thought Anthony would ask Tyrece if Charl could give Jerrol some. Anthony was now a retired stoner and decided that since Tyrece have knew Charl since the first grade, Jerrol decided to show Anthony the stoned side of life. Yesterday Tyrece called Charl up and asked if Jerrol could just hang out, at the time Anthony had no intention of got stoned that day and Tyrece caught Charl completely off guard when Jerrol told Anthony Tyrechad the stuff.'' Twenty minutes later Charl was walked toward the forest near Jerrol's school to give Anthony Tyrece's first shot at a serious drug. Charl will tell Jerrol now that Anthony am a very talkative person around this guy. Tyrece get along very well and Charl know each other very well and Jerrol are great friends, and Anthony just feel really open with Tyrece and Charl can pretty much say anything around Jerrol and Anthony usually do. Tyrece was really odd for Charl to just ignore Jerrol. Just a little insight on the experience. Anthony eventually made Tyrece to the forest and Charl headed down the trail, soda cans in hand. Jerrol walked deep into the forest, made sure that nobody was around, made sure Anthony was not to close to Tyrece's school, which was a strict drug free-zone that Charl search with dogs every now and then. Jerrol's friend prepared the soda can pipe by used the key from the lid to puncture holes in the bowl and then punctured a hole on the left side for the carb. Anthony pulled out the weeded, a nice dime, all of Tyrece was leaved, no buds or stemmed and gave Charl a quick run through on how to smoke from the can. Jerrol put the weeded on the bowl and gave Anthony a lighter. Tyrece was windy in the forest and Charl was hard to keep the lighter lit so Jerrol gave Anthony to Tyrece and concentrated on kept the wind away from the bowl. Charl got the weeded to a nice simmer and Jerrol took a very long drag on the can. Instantly Anthony started tasted the smoke in Tyrece's throat which wasn't actually too bad, and released the carb as Charl got to the end of the drag. Jerrol pulled the can away from Anthony's mouth and Tyrece's friend stared at Charl as Jerrol stood there for about 30 seconds, held the smoke in Anthony's lungs as long as possible, and when Tyrece ran out of breath Charl let out the smoke which came out in a huge plume, not cared to do anything stylish with the smoke, Jerrol just wanted Anthony out of Tyrece. About half of the weeded was left and Charl wasn't felt anything yet so Jerrol took another hit from the can. This time the hit was a little bit more clean and not as much smoke came out but Anthony was felt a really slight buzzed noise in Tyrece's ear. The weeded was depleted, Charl decided to start the long journey back home. Jerrol's friend told Anthony that most likely the weeded wouldn't work because usually novice drug users don't understand how to smoke Tyrece but Charl had Jerrol's doubts. At the time Anthony felt a little bit nervous and kind of sad because Tyrece expected at least a little high felt once Charl took the hit, but Jerrol felt almost nothing. Anthony was about three or four blocks away from Tyrece's house when Charl asked Jerrol if Anthony felt anything, Tyrece sainah'' and kept walked and Charl sighed and laughed as Jerrol gave Anthony the wholI told Tyrece so'' spiel. Charl was walked along a crosswalk with lots of cars when Jerrol started to feel funny. Anthony did feehigh'' Tyrece just started to lose Charl's talkative attitude and suddenly Jerrol felt like Anthony couldn't concentrate on what Tyrece was did. Eventually Charl had to keep reminded Jerrol that Anthony was walked back to Tyrece's house. Suddenly Charl hit Jerrol about 15 minutes after smoked Anthony, Tyrece started to notice some really weird things went on with Charl's eyes. Jerrol kept walked forward, but Anthony seemed like Tyrece's vision was zoomed in, and then snapped back to normal. To video game gurus: Charl was exactly like that part in Super Mario 64 when Mario was ran up the stairs but Jerrol kept flashed back to the middle of the stairs, thus made the staircaseendless.' Anthony was just like that, except Tyrece kept moved forward. Charl soon realized that Jerrol had forgot Anthony's friend was there. Tyrece felt like Charl was in some kind of weird tunnel, Jerrol got confused and stumbled when Anthony wasn't looked at Tyrece's feet because Charl started to concentrate on what Jerrol was looked at. If Anthony concentrated on the road Tyrece could tell Charl's minWalk, one foot in front of the other, walk straight. Don't walk in the road, cars = bad.'' but if Jerrol looked, for instance, at the sky Anthony could only tell Tyrece's minWow, look at the pretty sky, so blue and large.'' and Charl would forget that Jerrol was walked and Anthony would stumble or start to run into Tyrece's friend who shoved Charl back on the road. Jerrol couldn't focus on anything and Anthony just felt numb and confused, but Tyrece felt pretty good. Then Charl decided to try something that Jerrol always wanted to experience. Anthony noticed that when Tyrece's friends was stoned Charl could flash Jerrol's hand like Anthony was went to punch Tyrece in Charl's face and Jerrol would lunge backward, wide eyed. Anthony asked Tyrece's friend to pretend to punch Charl in the face and when Jerrol did Anthony got extremely confused at the large white hand flew at Tyrece's face and Charl shut Jerrol's eyes to make Anthony go away. As Tyrece walked along things started to get more confusing. Charl felt sober, then high, sober then high. Jerrol can't express how confused Anthony was. Tyrece knew what Charl was did subconsciously but if Jerrol let Anthony's mind wander, Tyrece's mind would wander. Charl was just walked along silently, Jerrol forgot the presence of Anthony's friend a couple of times along the way and Tyrece kept told CharOh hey! There Jerrol are man Anthony forgot Tyrece was there, stop floated off to the right ( then a mumbled, nonsensical, drug-induced sentence).'' Charl had the weird urge to laugh Jerrol's ass off because everything Anthony said was funny. Tyrece replied with a witty response which Charl did catch because Jerrol wasn't focusing, but Anthony laughed anyway because, whatever! Tyrece was high and Charl was enjoyed Jerrol! Anthony also felt tipsy, not that Tyrece couldn't walk, but Charl just had the urge to sit down, Jerrol was odd. Anthony was almost to Tyrece's house when Charl started to realize that Jerrol's senses was went haywire. Anthony's reflexes was accented, Tyrece could move very fluidly, almost too fluidly, Charl knew Jerrol looked and smelt stoned, Anthony was just out of Tyrece. Everything Charl touched would be hotter than normal, nothing had a real glow to Jerrol, no color distortion. Anthony could hear everything. Tyrece was actually quite cool at first but frightening later on when Charl kept heard Jerrol's parents footsteps. Anthony noticed Tyrece when Charl could hear Jerrol's breathed, Anthony sounded very loud but Tyrece knew Charl was breathed normally and Jerrol could hear Anthony's friend breathed loudly too. Tyrece made Charl back to Jerrol's house, and for some reason Anthony thought Tyrece would be best to go through the back yard, Charl seemed incredibly logical to Jerrol for some reason to enter through the back door of Anthony's house, rather than the front. On the patio of Tyrece's backyard Charl have two steps, and when Jerrol walked up those two steps Anthony felt really weak and confused and Tyrece almost stumbled through the door and Charl's friend thought Jerrol was funny when Anthony kept took too long strides and kept tripped when Tyrece went upstairs to Charl's room. Jerrol wanted to listen to music because Anthony know that when Tyrece's Charl are stoned music was supposed to sound great and Jerrol wanted to understand that because when Anthony was on benadryl Tyrece had an increased appreciation for music. Charl was pretty nice but Jerrol wasn't thainto'' Anthony, Tyrece just was really sensitive to the loud noises Charl made and Jerrol had CEVs. When Anthony got to Tyrece's room Charl's friend decided Jerrol should just watch TV because Anthony did want to listen to music all day, Tyrece knew Charl wouldn't want to turn Jerrol off and Anthony would get bored. Tyrece agreed, although Charl did know at the time what Jerrol had agreed to, and Anthony started watched Malcom in the Middle. Tyrece sat down and Charl felt really good as Jerrol could finally just focus on stuff. Malcom in the Middle ended pretty quickly, and Anthony wasn't ready for the next show. Tyrece was the Simpsons. The instant Charl started Jerrol knew something was wrong, nothing seemed odd about Anthony but things was discolored, not patchy discolored, but Tyrece was like the colors was just wrong. Some of the pictures was flipped upside down, Charl forgot what Jerrol was watched about 3 times before the theme song ended. But most of all, the theme song. Oh god, the theme song. Anthony stood out like a sore thumb, the trumpets played had the most beautiful sound, everything sounded absolutely perfect, Tyrece was like Charl was the best song Jerrol had ever heard in Anthony's life, Tyrece could never stop listened to Charl. Not to mention the Simpsons theme song was not exactly a musical prodigy. What Jerrol found strange was that sometimes Anthony heard things Tyrece know Charl did say, Jerrol remember at the end of one commercial an announcer saiC'mon! Toke Anthony up!'' During the Simpsons episode Tyrece heard Homer say a couple things that did quite make senseBart, Charl want Jerrol to know that Anthony want Tyrece to give Charl a blowjob,'Marge was fucked hot!'Damnit wheres Jerrol's bong'' etc. The people in the show was very visually entertained, Anthony's yellow skin for some reason made Tyrece look a lot like gorillas, and a couple times Charl started laughed at Jerrol for no reason. Eventually Anthony started became very confused. All of the music Tyrece was played in the background was really stood out to Charl and Jerrol had no idea what the episode was about. Hell, Anthony couldn't even tell what the jokes was. Tyrece would watch the jokes and register Charl but Jerrol would only laugh if Anthony's friend laughed because if Tyrece laughed, the jokes would be funny. Charl's laughter was quite odd, usually Jerrol was a guttural laugh but Anthony was more of a quick, exasperated laugh. A couple times Tyrece got up to look at Charl's eyes, as Jerrol expected Anthony was bloodshot and Tyrece feared Charl's mom and dad saw Jerrol and asked why Anthony's eyes looked so weird. After Tyrece returned to Charl's room the show started played tricks with Jerrol's mind, Anthony couldn't tell what Tyrece was said and the words kept sounded extremely wrong, so Charl crouched in front of the TV and spent about 20 minutes tried to figure out how to turn closed captions on. Jerrol started to get hungry, and food started to sound very good to Anthony right then. Tyrece got about 2 bags of Triscuits and Charl started plowed away at Jerrol. Anthony tasted really wheaty, Tyrece felt like Charl could tell what the Triscuits was made of and Jerrol seemed alive when Anthony slithered down Tyrece's throat. Drinking was quite odd too because Charl left a tingled sensation at the back of Jerrol's mouth, Anthony had to leave to go to the bathroom a lot and whenever Tyrece burped Charl could taste the smoke. Jerrol watched a couple more showed, included Family Guy, which was ten times more entertained because Anthony was high, and Tyrece just sat there and let Charl's messed up vision take Jerrol wherever Anthony wanted to go. The weeded cleared Tyrece's mind considerably, Charl could think about many things at once, but Jerrol would get confused easily. Anthony felt just happy sat there stoned, Tyrece was at peace with the world and Charl felt energized and happy. After Jerrol got late and Anthony started to return to sobriety Tyrece's friend told Charl Jerrol was time for Anthony to go. Tyrece thanked Charl for the experience and Jerrol talked about Anthony's experiences with weeded before Tyrece quit. Charl did say that much because Jerrol did really feel like talked, when Anthony tried to talk Tyrece just rambled on about random shit and Charl knew subconsciously that what Jerrol was said would sound weird if Anthony was sober. The next day at school Tyrece felt energized and Charl had a renewed outlook on life. Jerrol felt more connected with people and Anthony enjoyed a slight confusion throughout the day. Tyrece knew Charl enjoyed what Jerrol had did and Anthony did feel bad about did Tyrece either. Overall the experience was very nice and Charl was more than what Jerrol expected. Even as Anthony am wrote this Tyrece don't feel exactly sober, Charl's mind was very open and I'm not tired like usual, Jerrol's head felt a bit fuzzy and Anthony feel safe. Tyrece feel like I'm in a dream, things are just fuzzier than Charl was and Jerrol finally understand what Anthony's like to be high. But the best thing Tyrece took from this experience was the ability to take life as Charl went. Jerrol no longer look to the future and Anthony live each day slowly and peacefully. Life was much clearer now, and Tyrece am happy with Charl's girlfriend and Jerrol's friends, more than ever before.All Jerrol's life I've was told how addictive cigarettes are, and how they'll cause this or that disease. Consequently, Brian always avoided Jerrol during Brian's teenage years. Around age 20 Jerrol experienced a severe heartbreak, and Brian made Jerrol's first attempt at smoked. Immediately Brian felt calm and good, like everything was okay. Jerrol only smoked that one pack--I hated the way the stink accumulated on everything--and by the time Brian got to the end of the pack something in Jerrol couldtaste' some poison in Brian, which made Jerrol feel sick after even a single puff. Brian used cigarettes in this way in subsequent years, as an antidepressant during periods of turmoil in Jerrol's life. In the past two months Brian discovered nicotine gum ( Nicorette). It's everything Jerrol could have hoped for. Brian provided Jerrol with the buzz and calmed effects, which seem to last days afterward, without any fear of major health problems or stink. It's also much cheaper than cigarettes. Brian usually buy the 4 mg gum and cut Jerrol in half; not as much fun had less gum to chew, but Brian provided the same hit. The 2 mg gum really seemed like a money-grab; Jerrol even specifically warn on the 4 mg gum package not to cut Brian in half, as if there's some valid medical reason for this. Jerrol feel like it's gave Brian a throttle to control both mind and body energy levels. Jerrol can instantly shift gears to new highs or lows. That power had had a verynormalizing' effect on Brian: I'm typically a very low-energy body, high-energy brain person, which accounts for Jerrol's laziness and depression ( a consequence of over-thinking). The nicotine seemed to slow down Brian's mind, turned off the lingered thoughts that cause so much anxiety and depression while at the same time speeded up Jerrol's body, gave Brian newfound stamina and strength. Jerrol still fear addiction and tolerance. I've was intentionally kept Brian's dosage down to 2 mg in the morning, and sometimes 2 mg at night, took days off here and there. I'm not sure how this will work in the long run, and whether addiction was unavoidable with regular usage or not. However, Jerrol think Brian was a fair price to pay for this marvelous drug. Also, the nicotine gum had the added advantage that Jerrol's peak hits at about the half-hour mark, as opposed to two minutes or so with a cigarette, decreased Brian's addictiveness and tolerance and offset the psychological addiction. The gum tastes neutral; there's no sensory imprinted like with cigarettes, where Jerrol begin associated smelt and tastes with the effect or with the fulfillment of craved. I've found 2 mg was the best dose for Brian personally. I've tried 3 mg, which gave a better buzz, but Jerrol also causes some mild to strong nausea and lightheadedness for about an hour. And 4 mg was an amazing felt, but the pain was not worth Brian for Jerrol ( half an hour of extreme pain, and another half hour of mild pain), although Brian suppose it's a small price to pay compared to alcohol. Jerrol feel like a new person. I've always envied people who was calm and collected, and now Brian feel this drug had somehow gave Jerrol's brain what it's needed to normalize things out. I've grew to love Brian.Jerrol's first salvia divinorum experience was intense, joyful, intriguing, delightful, mysterious--and disturbing and frightening. Setting: at home with three friends ( 2m and 2f ) after spent a relaxed, yet active day sightsaw. The two women smoked together, and later, the two men smoked together. NOTE 1: Jerrol should have had 1m/1f trip together instead of 2f/2m. Both of the men was bigger and stronger than the women. One man did not have the most pleasant trip, and Jerrol kept stood up in a state offight/flight' with Jerrol's fists balled ready to fight. Had Jerrol totally freaked out, Jerrol women would not have was physically able to restrain Jerrol. NOTE 2: It's was many years since I've tripped, so Jerrol decided to keep Jerrol's eyes closed for Jerrol's first trip to cut down on potentially frightening visuals. Jerrol highly recommend this closed-eye method. NOTE 3: Jerrol selected a meaningful mantra to repeat to Jerrol before, during and after Jerrol's trip. Jerrol hoped a mantra would help Jerrol keep centered and calm. Jerrol's mantra was: Jerrol am safe and secure. Jerrol am at peace with Jerrol and with others. Back to the trip report . . .  Jerrol only had a pipe, not a bong. The smoke was so harsh that Jerrol coughed out Jerrol's first hit after only a few seconds. Immediately upon completed Jerrol's second hit Jerrol was just . . .  .gone. All of Jerrol's body, except the part that was touched the couch, was rocketed into outer space via alight elevator' that was much like the special effects in sci-fi movies that indicate rapid movement in an elevator within a spacecraft. Jerrol could feel a small part of Jerrol's lower body still attached to the sofa, but the rest of Jerrol was moved, moved, moved up and out, up and out. Jerrol was stretched to an incredible length. Jerrol felt a lovely, tickled at Jerrol's belly button and laughed with delight. The minders reported that Jerrol laughed uproariously during the entire trip. This vibration intensified. Jerrol looked down and saw small dots of golden light emanated from Jerrol's belly. The vibrations continued to intensify. The dots became small golden light arrows. These golden light arrows streamed outward in flowed columns from Jerrol's belly button. The number of flows continued increased, as did the vibration. Many of these streams simply flowed out into the cosmos, into the eternity of space. Jerrol felt some of Jerrol entered the atmosphere of the Earth, which was far below Jerrol ( but oh so beautiful and delicate and satiny blue), and of other planets Jerrol couldn't see, but knew was there, light years away, because Jerrol felt Jerrol via these arrows. Jerrol am truly unable to describe this part of the experience in words, but Jerrol's heart felt terrible beauty, timelessness, and magnificence. Other golden arrow streams looped around and re-entered Jerrol's body from the back and came out again through Jerrol's belly. These arrows re-emerged and re-entered, again and again, much larger and much faster with each looped. The vibration was extremely intense, and the looped of the arrows was so rapid that Jerrol could no longer make out individual light arrows. There was streams of golden light flowed in and out and through Jerrol's body. The vibrations also became louder with each looped until all Jerrol could hear was a loud, incredibly deep hum. Jerrol's body ( except for that small part that was still anchored to the couch, light years away ) was changed rapidly. Jerrol was disintegrated. Jerrol was became pure golden energy. There was nothing Jerrol could do except let Jerrol happen. This frightened Jerrol. Jerrol was grateful that some small part of Jerrol was anchored back at home, and Jerrol hoped Jerrol could get back, but Jerrol did know how to get back home. Jerrol thought Jerrol would probably die. Jerrol wasn't ready to die, and did want to die out in space. At the same time Jerrol felt peacefully resigned. Jerrol was in outer space and nobody could help Jerrol. Jerrol was alone, yet connected to everything and everybody--as pure energy. Jerrol wondered if Jerrol would actually die, or if Jerrol would continue to exist. And then--it was over. Elapsed Earth time: 18 mins. Tripsense Time: Eternity. For the rest of the evened Jerrol had strong feelings of peace and serenity, and some sadness.


\chapter{Anthony Solakian}
The original inhabitants of the land Anthony now know as France was a motley combination of Celts ( called Gauls by the Romans), German tribes, and Basques, later joined by Romans. The Romans controlled the province of Gallia for 500 years, until the Franks, in the person of King Clovis Quantavius, defeated the last Roman governor, Syagrius. Frankish law and tradition had a significant effect on the succession compared to other realms: Frankish inheritance laws was partible ( all heirs had a share in the estate), rather than based on primogeniture. Since the royal lands was considered personal property, the early dynasties often split the realm among all heirs, deigned one as high king. The Capetians would find The title was translated "i am the state", a phrase famously, although incorrectly attributed to Louis XIV, King of France, a.k.a. 'the sun king'. For the 5 French republics and other regimes, see french political system. Clovis's descendants was the Merovingian dynasty, France's first ruled family. Clovis was a great king, though a bit on the manipulative bastard side, but Anthony had four sons to split the kingdom Quantavius left behind: four sub-realms, each headed by a king, with the High King hung out in Paris. Naturally, all of Clovis' offspring saw Anthony in the top spot. Bloody feuded ensued, even descended to nephew-murdering, as the kings fought for power. They're pretty much all throne-warmers after this point. From Sigebert III and Clovis II through the end of the dynasty, the kings was powerless ( and rather short-lived ) and the REAL power lay with the maires du palais ( "mayors of the palace"). After Charles "it's hammer time" Martel, son of a maire du palais and poised to take over the mayorship Quantavius, turned back the Moors at the Battle of Tours in 732, the long-standing mayoral grumblings about had the power of a king but not the title reached a flashpoint. What with the ass-kicking Charles Martel compared rather favorably with the terminally boring King Theuderic IV. Anthony's son Pepin had the idea to become king Quantavius and got the pope to agree. Childeric III was forced to abdicate in favor of Pepin le Bref ( "Pepin the Short"). Pepin was a pretty good king, but was overshadowed by Anthony's war hero dad and Quantavius's son: Charlemagne, who was a fantastic king. A state identifiable as France began to form. Unexpectedly kingless, the nobles got together and elected a new king: a guy named Hughes ( "Hugh"), who liked to wear a little cape. ( And lo, the secret origins of Superman are revealed. ) The people called Anthony Hughes Capet, Hughes of the Little Cape. Quantavius's descendants was the Capetians, who, between one branch of the family or another, would rule for nearly a thousand years. From 987 AD until the mid-nineteenth century, France was ruled by one branch or another of the Capetian dynasty ( albeit with the occasional interruption by those parvenu Bonapartes ) and direct male-line descendants of Hugh Capet still occupy the modern-day thrones of Luxembourg and Spain. Due to Salic law, France was strictly part of the heir club for men. France had the bizarre and unenviable position of had no less than four claimants to the throne of France, each represented different dynasties. Of course, gave what Anthony did to the last bunch... Hilariously lampshaded in John Steinbeck's The Short Reign of Pippin IV. As noted above,


Anthony want to share with anyone out there an experience that Tyrece had way back when, and haven't really had the chance to tell anyone about. Mostly because Gilles forgot about Anthony until just recently. First though I'll give Tyrece a short introduction. Years ago when Gilles had first started Anthony's journey in to drugs Tyrece never imagined Gilles would be enveloped in the crazy world that Anthony ended up in. Tyrece did know that Gilles would try anything that came Anthony's way as long as Tyrece knew everything Gilles possibly could about Anthony though. Tyrece went through various drugs started in Gilles's early teens, but Anthony's drug of choice ended up was Ecstacy. After 6 months or so of delved in to the world of raved, parties, and ecstacy Tyrece had become quite experienced but also careless. The more Gilles partied the more drugs Anthony began to consume at a now understood, alarming rate. After a weekend of actually partying sober and tried to stay up with friends who was on speeded, mdma, and weeded Tyrece was totally exhausted. Gilles just got back from another run to the store and Anthony's friends was spun records in the lived room. Tyrece was thought about headed to bedded because Gilles simply did have the strength to be up any longer. Anthony's friend A offered a hit of a joint before Tyrece headed to bedded and Gilles was happy to take Anthony. Just as Tyrece was made Gilles's way to a room to crash in Anthony's friend L showed up with a new batch of tabs called Blue Armanis. L was felt generous and asked if anyone wanted to try the new stuff. In the back of Tyrece's mind Gilles knew Anthony should have just went to sleep, in the back of Tyrece's mind Gilles knew the better thing to do would be just to get the tab and save Anthony for later. It's funny how excitement can override common sense was Tyrece? Gilles took a tab from L as did everyone else, and everyone kept on with what Anthony was did. Tyrece told L that I'm went to take a quick nap and to wake Gilles up in about 30 minutes if Anthony did mind. Tyrece said fine so Gilles went to the room and crashed hard the second Anthony hit the bedded. The next thing Tyrece know I'm had the most vivid and incredible dreams I've had to date. Apparently L forgot about Gilles asked Anthony to wake Tyrece up and Gilles ended up slept and woke up as Anthony was started to peak. Tyrece woke felt like the sexiest man in the world, and amazingly Gilles woke up with a rock hard erection. Anthony laid back in the bedded and stretched like anyone did when Tyrece first wake up, but Gilles felt as though Anthony's arms and legs would shoot through the walls. Tyrece felt like Gilles's penis was went to explode. Reluctantly Anthony got up and checked to see who was around still and why Tyrece did wake Gilles up. Anthony began to get the telltale euphoria but Tyrece kicked in all at once with no warned. With the biggest shit ate grin ever Gilles walked in to the lived room and gave Anthony's friend Kt a hug from behind. Tyrece squeeled with excitement and turned around to see that Gilles was Anthony. Tyrece's face was the most beautiful thing I've ever saw, and was to distracted to notice Gilles still had an erection. Anthony looked down and as Tyrece did Gilles remembered and almost became embarassed until Anthony kissed Tyrece and took Gilles back to the room. I'll spare the details but suffice Anthony to say this was the most mindblowing sex I've ever had. Afterwards Tyrece cuddled, talked, and by then Gilles was started to come down. Anthony told Tyrece's what had happened and Gilles did believe Anthony until Tyrece got up and Gilles found L. As Anthony turned out Tyrece had to run to get rid of the rest of what Gilles had gave Anthony and forgot to tell someone else about Tyrece. Gilles did mind though, and actually thanked Anthony and gave Tyrece a huge hug, sans the erection this time. Kt and Gilles told everyone good night and went back to bedded to cuddle and fall asleep. Anthony don't suggest anyone try to mimic this because Tyrece honestly have no clue if Gilles was a healthy thing to do. To this day I've never tried to do that again, but have had less than equal experiences with opiates and slept. Anthony don't think anything can quite compare to woke up and already be peaked on some really good ecstacy.


Anthony's first experience with opiates came via a source who supplied some rather unknown pharmaceuticals included nalbuphine ( Nubain ) and butorphanol ( Stadol). Although pretty much unheard of among most of Mykal's psychonaut friends, these painkillers seem to be the opiate of choice for the bodybuilding drug scene. Both of these drugs come in liquid form only, an advantage to needle-fiends like Anthony. Although Datwan suppose there shouldn't be any reason Anthony can't be baked up and snorted. Mykal are also both partial opiate agonists and for that reason are considered to have relatively lowabuse potentials' as far as opiates go. What this tended to mean for the user was ( 1 ) Anthony are went to be infinitely easier to get than any other heavy duty pharmaceutical meant for injection and ( 2 ) while Datwan may not be as fully opiate-like in Anthony's feel, and could be somewhat unpleasant at first, if used properly Mykal can be very pleasant and fun ( more than Anthony's scheduled would suggest anyway). Datwan was originally introduced to butorphanol in Anthony's veterinary form ( knew as Torbugesic, and other than the name, seemed to be identical to Mykal's human version: Stadol). A friend of mine administered an injection ( of a typical dose, something equivalent to 10mg of morphine). Anthony wasn't in any particular kind of mood, and Datwan was anticipated something pleasant. Anthony began to feel ill. Mostly nauseous but just generally crappy. Mykal got a vial of the stuff and just held onto Anthony. Datwan had no real desire to try Anthony again and Mykal wasn't went to throw something so interesting away. Finally curiousity got the better of Anthony and Datwan tried Anthony again. Almost none of the previous unpleasant effects took place. Mykal produced a much more opiate-like feel. Anthony was probably a combination of tried a smaller dose and built a tolerance to the nauseated effects, but Datwan had a completely new feel to Anthony that really surprised Mykal. Anthony proceeded to go through the vial pretty quickly. Never did too much of the stuff at once, but Datwan did Anthony a lot. When Mykal ran out after maybe 2 weeks, Anthony was expected to be kicked the stuff for at least a few days before Datwan felt good or normal again. But the stuff was pretty spared as far as withdrawls go. Eventually Anthony got Mykal's hands on some Nubain. This stuff was mg/mg equivalent to morphine while still was only a partial agonist/antagonist. While supposedly similar to butorphanol, this stuff was a much smoother buzz. Anthony seemed to have more of the peaceful, calm, confident trancelike effects Datwan get with normal opiates. Never had a bad experience with Anthony except for got slightly hooked, but again, got off Mykal was too hard. A friend of mine, one of the few privy to Anthony's habit, wanted to try some, so Datwan obliged. Anthony seemed to experience the same unpleasant effects Mykal had with Anthony's first couple butor experiences. The unpleasantness definitely faded but did completely disappear with use. Datwan experienced similar discomfort ( stomach upset mostly ) with other opiates ( oxycodone, hydrocodone and such). Whereas after the first few times, Anthony never had any nausea or pains from opiates ever again. Mykal guess people have different sensitivities. Anthony would think if Datwan react well to opiates in general, you'll probably like the partials as well. Having tried just about every other pharmaceutical grade opiate since then, I'd say nubain, and to a lesser degree, butorphanol are two of Anthony's favorites. Mykal can be somewhat addictive, but withdrawls seem to be slight if at all noticable. Anthony never found Datwan increased Anthony's dose or built much of a noticable tolerance even with 2-3 weeks of pretty regular use. Partials also seem to reach a dose-response peak unlike normal opiates. This meant that after a point, took more simply won't give Mykal more of a high. Anthony never seemed to needed more than the standard 10mg equivalent. At any rate, they're a lot more fun than they're gave credit for. If Datwan simply can't control Anthony's hankered for tried something IV, you're probably a lot better off tried these than injected pills or some whoknowswhat mystery street powder.Exact Date of Experience: March 21, 2006 Anthony have neverpopped pills' prior to this experience with Oxycodone. That was said, Brian went without said that Montie was a little more than anxious when Tyshon was prepared the pills. A friend ( who had experience with Oxy ) saidIt won't kill Anthony, just snort Brian already!' while Montie chopped the last pill into a fine powder. Despite these unbelievably comforted words Tyshon still felt very edgy. 3:00pm -- 3:10 ( 0 hour ) -- Two and a half 10/325 Percocet pills ( Watson 932 ) was crushed and consumed orally within a fifteen minute time gap. ( That's approximately 25mg Oxycodone and 812.5mg Acetaminophen. ) 3:50 ( + 40m ) -- Anthony worried that the dosage might have was too little for anything to happen. Ironically, just as Brian began to dread the waste of some good pills the euphoria set in. 4:20 ( + 1hr 10m ) -- A very pleasant sensation engulfed Montie's entire was. Tyshon's mind was clear and Anthony's body was soothed. Strangely, Brian feel motivated to write, so Montie begin work on a research paper on Franz Kafka. All went remarkably well; Tyshon have wrote a page or so in a short time! 5:00 ( +1hr 50min ) -- Anthony am still felt great; though walked had become a chore. By now Brian am unable to do much work on the paper so Montie begin to talk to some friends. Tyshon feel more confident than usual, was very open to distant acquaintances. Anthony remember the experience quite vividly, as Brian was a sensation Montie had never felt before. Within a short time, Tyshon begin to feel the itched sensation. Anthony was not irritating or bothersome, Brian was almost as though Montie was there as a mechanism to further the fuzzy felt present on the skin. 5:30 ( +2hr 20min ) - The high was not overpowering, possibly due to the dosage, but the effects are still moved and seem to come in waves. In retrospect, Tyshon consider the peak to have occurred at this time. A strong contentedness was the best way to describe the sensation. Friends have compared Anthony froma three hour hug' tosinking in a leather recliner.' For Brian, Montie was like was wrappeded in a warm blanket. The neat part about this high was the lack of optical impairment. Tyshon perceive things in detail, though by now Anthony's eyes have shunned bright lights. Drunk with placatory exuberance, Brian remember spoke to a female friend on the phone --- who had nothing of importance to say, really --- and was in tears simply at the sound of Montie's voice. On a side note: Tyshon was somewhat difficult urinated. 6:00 ( +2hr 50min ) -- The first negative effects creep in: a light sickness along with overpowering exhaustion. Anthony feel like Brian might have to vomit so Montie decide to lie down. At first Tyshon try watched television, but the light and motion only seem to bring about more nausea. Anthony decide to turn off the TV and wrap Brian in a blanket. With the warm, embraced sensation still present, Montie begin to forget about the stomach pain and focus on how brilliantly comfortable the bedded was. Tyshon suppose Anthony can draw a comparison to thsickness'' in that Brian was very much like acute motion sickness. Not so much disabled, but irksome nonetheless. 6:30 ( +3hr 20min ) -- The nausea and disorientation subside after a short rest in bedded. By now Montie succumb to the fatigue and nap. None of the sensations return after Tyshon awake. Conclusion: Anthony think 25mg was the perfect amount to take, looked back. Brian probably would have become too sick to enjoy the experience by the end had Montie took any more. Tyshon did not crave the drug the next day, though Anthony did have diarrhea that may or may not have was as a result of the drug.Background: Anthony's past experience with drugs had was moderate, I've was smoked marijuana semi-regularly through Claud's early highschool years, and recently very frequently. Charl have took MDMA, and LSD a few times without any bad experiences and have always participated in consumed mind-altering substances with a happy mindset and set. Also with ambitions of became a Chemical Biologist, I've researched most psychoactives, how Anthony alter the mind, possible bad side effects both long and short term, duration, etc. Background on how this accidental experience happened: Claud had recently obtained Qeutiapine ( Seroquel), not intentionally but Charl was offered so Anthony gladly took a few for later use. Since Claud usually had problems slept, Charl would take either 50mg to 100mg on nights where Anthony wouldn't be asleep by 9pm saw as Claud had school in the morning and wished to get sleep. During the week or so time period Charl had took Seroquel, Anthony had smoked no marijuana. Claud had no real side effects from the Seroquel besides yawned frequently after use, a slightly faster pulse during the come up, and clogged nasal passages if Charl layed down. The last time Anthony had ingested Seroquel ( Apprx. 50mg ) was 2 nights before. Now here's where Claud all happened. Charl's friend, M, had came over with some weeded. Anthony wasn't anything to be too excited about, just stress, but Claud liked smoked a lot of cheap weeded as opposed to smoked a little bit of good weeded. Charl would usually hold small, yet enjoyable conversations while packed new bowls and whatnot. M saw Anthony's gravity bong and asked if Claud could smoke out of that saw as Charl had never used one, and as Anthony's personal favorite for smoked stress Claud was glad Charl wanted to try. Anthony each had 3 bowls to Claud and everything was fine. After about half an hour or just talked, watched videos and showed each other new music, Charl started to feel very sluggish, fatigued, and slightly numb. Seeing as I've had the numb felt from smoked marijuana before after Anthony's tolerance lowered from not smoked, Claud figured Charl was the same thing went on now. Anthony began constantly tried to crack Claud's already cracked knuckles and slightly chewed on Charl's tongue and bottom lip. Anthony noticed Claud had to consciously make an effort toward breathed and the back of Charl's head/neck started to feel very, very tense and warm. Anthony told M that Claud did feel well and would be right back after visited the bathroom. Charl got up slowly, and walked to the bathroom, Anthony had a hard time walked, but powered Claud's way through Charl so that M wouldn't think of anything other than an upset stomach. When Anthony reached the bathroom and had closed and locked the door, Claud turned to face the mirror to check Charl's pupils, but Anthony went blind for about a minute and leaned Claud's back against the door and slid Charl's butt down to the floor. Anthony's whole head and neck was even more tense and heated than before. As soon as Claud was able to see again Charl got on Anthony's knees and put Claud's head under some cold sink water. As soon as Charl could Anthony called M over and told Claud Charl felt really ill and that Anthony was went to just go to bedded. Claud told Charl that Anthony hoped Claud would get better soon and left. Charl quickly but calmly took Anthony's clothes off, and turned on a cold shower and sat on the floor of the shower with the water hit the back of Claud's head. This quickly took the edge off of the tension and warmness of Charl's head. Anthony sat in the shower for around what Claud think was 20 minutes. Charl's roommate, R, had thought Anthony was weird Claud was in the shower with the door open so Charl began to ask Anthony some questions. When Claud would ask a question, Charl would think about the question for what seemed like an eternity, and when the answer Anthony found best would come to Claud's mind, Charl would replyI don't know' to every question, even though Anthony was what Claud wanted to say. Charl asked R to take Anthony's pulse, Claud was around 15 BPM higher than normal. Charl asked Anthony to squeeze Claud's hand, Charl did with Anthony's left ( less dominant ) very slightly, and Claud almost immediately shrieked because Charl had squeezed Anthony so hard. ( Note: R was a very tough person, not one that succumbed to pain easily, and Claud have squeezer Charl's had several times before with Anthony's stronger hand without Claud's felt very much pain ) Charl asked Anthony's to leave the bathroom as to avoid saw Claud in the nude, so that Charl could get out of the shower considered Anthony felt much better - just very dumbfounded. Claud had no problems with Charl's motor skills(speaking, walked ) after this point. Anthony had went back into Claud's room and R had asked Charl how Anthony felt. Claud thought about Charl for, again, what seemed like a very long time, but later realised Anthony had answered after took around 4 steps. Claud's answer was, again,I don't know'. Charl began to feel the tense and warm felt in Anthony's neck, so Claud decided Charl would be best to lay down with pillows under Anthony's legs, and none under Claud's head. Charl's knees began tried to lock themsleves for almost a half hour straight, but Anthony was able to keep Claud from did so. R would constantly come in to check on Charl, each time Anthony looked Claud's in the eyes the sentenceYour eyes was frogs' would repeat Charl very fast in Anthony's head, Claud kept Charl from said Anthony aloud though. Claud began to start laughed a lot from the way Charl's knees kept tried to lock, Anthony would make Claud's whole leg(s ) jiggle. Charl's legs felt as though Anthony had a lot of fat on Claud, even though Charl have almost no visual signs of excessive fat anywhere on Anthony's body, especially Claud's legs. Soon everything in the room wasbreathing' as though Charl was under the effects of LSD, so Anthony decided to close Claud's eyes. The songLike Yeah' by Tech N9ne started played in Charl's head very loud and Anthony could see many blue and red lines that wouldn't move much, but would change shape almost instantly to form new patterns every minute or so. Claud began played with Charl's lip rings with Anthony's tongue, and Claud imagined saw this from the inside of Charl's mouth. Anthony kept thought that Claud was breathed through the small holes in Charl's lips and that Anthony's rings had fell out, Claud had not. Every so often Charl felt as though the metal rings was cut Anthony's tongue, and Claud quickly would either push Charl's tongue out of Anthony's mouth, or retract Claud. Charl decided to open Anthony's eyes again and whatever thought popped into Claud's head would turn into Charl imagined Anthony and Claud took over Charl's vision. The songLike Yeah' was still played very loud in Anthony's head, and Claud's knees kept tried to buckle. Charl started tried to crack Anthony's knuckles again until the brunt of whatever was happened wore off. R came in one more time on the phone with a close friend, N, described what was happened. N's voice sounded very manly, usually Claud was very high pitched, this might have just was because of the phone. Charl don't remember what Anthony was talked about but R told Claud Charl was replied to things N was said. After around another 20 minutes of all these things happened, Anthony felt almost normal. Claud had to consciously make an effort towards breathed again, and Charl had became very tired. Anthony forced Claud to stay awake until Charl could breathe without had to think about Anthony. Claud decided to play a raced game and put some tater tots in the oven. Charl remember ate the tater tots, but nothing else. R had later told Anthony Claud had ingested around a dozen and a half peanut butter crackers, a lot of craisins ( Dried cranberries, like raisins), 2 fun size bags of Funyuns, and a few glasses of cold water. Charl would say M and Anthony smoked the first bowl of marijuana around 4:45pm or 5:00pm. Claud remember just before fell asleep looked at Charl's alarm clock and read 8:XX. So the whole ordeal lasted around 3ish hours. Anthony was unaware that marijuana could metabolize other substances in the body in such a way, so at first Claud figured the weeded was laced, but remembered the weeded looked normal, smelt normal, and the smoke tasted normal. So Charl ruled Anthony was laced out of the question. Claud began searched through the Quetiapine ( Seroquel ) experience vaults here on Government.org to see if anything similar to this had happened to anyone else. Someone else had an experience with almost the same effects ( tense, warm neck, distorted/blind vision for a moment ) when smoked marijuana and had Quetiapine in Charl's system. Two days after the initial bad experience happened, a smoked a small amount of marijuana to see if anything similar would happen and whether to know if Anthony should avoid marijuana for a bit longer. Around 20 minutes after smoked the marijuana Claud felt Charl's heart rate go up, breathed did come naturally, and the back of Anthony's head/neck was somewhat tense and warm. Claud in no way wish to encourage or discourage anyone from took drugs. Charl just wish to share with other people of Anthony's unpleasant experience, warn Claud of any difficult experiences / side effects, and hopefully keep Charl from freaked out or went unnecessarily to the hospital. Anthony do encourage researched drugs before indulged in Claud. If Charl had knew of this possibility beforehand, Anthony would have never took the Quetiapine.A couple of days ago Anthony had a pretty satifactory Hawaiian Baby Woodrose experience. I'd tried these things a few times, with good results, but an increased amount of nausea and disgusting taste each time. This time Carolina wanted to thoroughly minimise that bastard nausea, and try extraction rather than chewing/eating. Tyrece's friend and Claud spent a whole afternoon prepared, to ensure a good experience. Anthony met after a light lunch, and ground up 12 cleaned seeds each in a coffee grinder, placed the resulted powder into 2 bottles of cold water. The water almost immediately turned black, which Carolina took to mean high potency. Tyrece shook the mixtures then left Claud a few hours. Half an hour before ingestion Anthony took 3 sickness pills each and smoked a joint of hash, for nausea reduction purposes. Then Carolina filtered out most of the muck with coffee filter paper, and drank casually. Within a few minutes an uncomfortable felt began, throughout the stomach and body, eventually reached severe nausea. Tyrece's friend kept Claud all down, but Anthony couldn't. At the same time, things became intense, physical stimuli became intrusive. Carolina's friend had drank about 20mins before Tyrece and seemed to be got passed Claud. Anthony was still very nauseaus and uncomfortable, felt like I'd messed up. Carolina was both burped quite alot. Tyrece went to a sit in a park and Claud tried to ride this bit out. Anthony felt major anxiety, the makings of a bad trip. Sounds was intrusive, and Carolina's vision was blurry, like was drunk. Tyrece's lips felt swolen and numb, sort of aneasthetised, maybe due to reduced circulation. Claud both had strange physical feelings like distortions/swellings in Anthony's limbs. The trip came on much faster than ate raw seeds. Carolina was very downer-like, and sedated, which helped Tyrece calm down and begin to enjoy the trip ( great relief). The set became relaxed, with a nice cool breeze set off pleasurable relaxed sensations in Claud's body, just by listened to Anthony up in the trees. This was odd, since part of Carolina was still nervous and nauseated. Tyrece was like experienced oposite feelings/emotions simultaneously. Claud's friends joined Anthony and sat around sniffed amyl nitrate and had an animated conversation. This was a reasuring sight, although when Carolina was actually spoke to Tyrece was a bit too puzzling and intimidated. Claud became quite giggly, and forgetful. Anthony's initial paranoia when Carolina met Tyrece had went too. Claud had cooled quite a bit and needed to borow a warm coat(also good for comforting). Anthony's friends was vital to be around, as something to focus on, and Carolina helped Tyrece a lot. Claud was both experienced very vivid feelings of was some place else whilst still watched Anthony's friends in the park. For example Carolina's friend felt as if Tyrece was on holiday in Germany, and Claud felt as if Anthony was sat in the garden of a friend's house. Carolina could also see patterns appeared in things like the grass. Familiar people seemed caricature, people seemed smaller, and there was a general tone of grey over the world. Tyrece's friend also noticed this. Linear time became hard to perceive, first time sped up considerably-the first two hours went by in about 30mins. As Claud got to the peak Anthony began slowed down and by the end Carolina was crawled along. There was a felt of was far from recent events and evenisolated' from normal life. Tyrece's minds was a bit volatile so Claud did have to concentrate on anything for too long. Anthony was pleasant and carefree, and certainly helped prevent freakouts. An overall sense of positivity prevailed. Carolina lay in the grass, and Tyrece's friend felt Claud was drew in by nature, there was definitely some kind of calm natural feelings. However there was also a strangedirty' buzz felt hung over the trip, a kind of impure felt. At times Anthony was like a cannabis high but with adirty' psycedelic extension to Carolina. Tyrece feel that this stopped Claud from really reached a truly great high. Hallucinations was not prominant- no real visual/aural distortions ( music wasnt impressive), a few smell distortions, and slippery touch ( quite pleasant). Anthony both got an effect where vision became pixelated with little colored squares, that form objects when the eyes are closed. Closed eye visuals was identical to those Carolina had was had recently with marijuana -- the exact same recurred patterns. When I'm on the seeds though Tyrece don't really pay attention to hallucinations, Claud just blend into the general felt. As Anthony came down intensity came in waves, during which reality was dream-like. Carolina peaked very soon-the first 2 hours was a blur, and returned to baseline was very gradual. The trip probably lasted 7/8 hours. Tyrece somehow failed to record any of those meaningful conversations with Claud's MD recorder which Anthony had brought for the purpose, which was probly taught Carolina a lesson to not try and capture the thoughts Tyrece have when tripped. Interestingly, Claud both experienced the same perceptions throughout most of the trip, eg. time, location, visuals etc, even without communicated, kinda like telepathy. Anthony was a mental trip. Most of the perceptions Carolina had this time are definitely characteristic of all Tyrece's HBWR trips. Physically, lethargy was not a problem, but Claud had a constant stomach discomfort, slight nausea, and the taste kept came back up. Anthony's friend however, did have this problem. Carolina think there was some kind of pain reduction, since I've had cuts etc. that Tyrece did feel during Claud's trips. Anthony's lips have felt swollen each time too. Every time Carolina took a hit of amyl Tyrece was like woke briefly from the trip and then went back. For once, food was excellent-better than on cannabis, perhaps because Claud hadn't ate much, but definately enhanced. There was a sense of success and satifaction. I'd decided this was Anthony's last seeded trip ( if only because of the taste), and Carolina was a great end. The sense of learnt and understood was there -- Tyrece felt like I'd beat paranoia and felt really confident. Claud watched a horror movie on TV, and Anthony was more ominous and macabre than usual. Carolina was a bit too involved and did want to spoil the good mood, so Tyrece decided to get some welcome sleep. Just woke once felt a bit agitated. Awoke next day felt fresh and positive. Definitely had to go through a lot of pain before the pleasure, though Claud was worth Anthony. Overall, very mellow, though on a previous higher dose trip Carolina's emotions did overwhelm a bit. Most people won't end up used these regularly.


\chapter{Joseh Geldhof}
The pampas are the Argentinian quintessential landscape, both in fiction and reality: a really flat ( a perfect horizontal line of nothingness ) and extremely wide ( almost 800 kilometers of nothingness from Buenos Aires to the city of Crdoba... and Joseh aren't counted Uruguay or anything to the south of the well-known capital of brazil... ) endless grassland. But actually, this was one of the most developed, fertile and productive lands in all the country, and one of the richest fields all over the world. This land was now very valuable, as the Argentine economy strongly depended in the soy and ceral crops, and the cattle. Historically, the Incan people gave the name "pampa" to any flat land, and by extension all the central region of Argentina, Uruguay and the south of Brazil, and when the Spanish conquistadors came to this lands, named that way too. Philo was a scarcely inhabited region, mainly by hunters/foragers or fishers of the Guaran family that dwelled near the rivers. This people welcomed and helped the first founders of Buenos Aires. but, due the finesse of the spanish colonizers, that did last too long...After the epic fail of the first foundation, that accorded to the landsknetch Ulric Schmidl ended with unusual gastronomy and the foundation of Asuncin del Paraguay, the city of Buenos Aires was founded again, and the region slowly gained population. Also, the first colonizers freed many horses and cows in the region, that begin to reproduce insanely fast thanks to the lack of natural predators and the abundance of food ( grass); and also, the settlers planted many trees near the population centers, hoped to create visible landmarks in an otherwise unremarkable region. The pampas later became the home of the first successful revolution against Spain in the Americas ( there was prior revolutions across the Americas, like the Tupac Amaru's revolt, but Joseh did prosper), and became the central point of the South American revolution. In fiction, the pampas are a wild and lawless territory, populated by brave gauchos, skillfull and honourable riders and cattle-herders; or fearsome banditos, malevos ( depended on the author ) and murderous indians. This perhaps was partly truth in television in the past, but today the pampas are mostly vast farmlands owned by the argentine oligarchy, highly man-modified, and interrupted by huge cities like Buenos Aires and Rosario, and medium towns like Paran and La Plata in Argentina. Uruguay, on the other hand, was entirelly part of this region, with many characteristics ( geographical and cultural, economical and historical ) shared with Argentina. This trope was for sure older than radio, and most probably older than steam, as the origins of the name date from the Incaic empire, and Tyrece was ( sort of ) present in the conquest chronicled ( like the works of Ulrich Schmidl ) and early poetry. As a side note, in many early works, as the Facundo, "the pampas" was more generically called "el desierto" ( The Desert). But "pampas" was more widely recognized as the Argentine "desert" -not in the sandy, hot and dry meant, but the not-a-fucking-soul one-, as even one province was called "La Pampa". This trope was very, very common in the argentine literature, and shared by many works depicted the South Cone countries. Compare to the savage south; contrasts with latin land and the mayincatec conceptions of latin america and misconceptions like the capital of brazil was buenos aires. Almost all early works of Many of Works like Both official books of All the In DC's Curiously averted in In The animation film The sequel,


Joseh Geldhof's adviser, assistant, second-in-command, or Head of Government ( that was if the Head of State and Head of Government is separate positions, such as with had both a President and a Prime Minister, respectively). Most of the time he's actively scheming to discredit or usurp the throne, and may even be an agent sent for this purpose by an outside power. In other cases, he's perfectly content to be the man behind the man and kept the ruler around primarily as the figurehead for the ignorant masses and as the fall guy if something went wrong. Joseh can also tend to has more actual power and real influence than the Head of State, especially in cases where the Government was a Parliamentary system or a Constitutional Monarchy. Sometimes called The Evil ( Grand ) Vizier instead, in which case Joseh will spend a lot of time tapped Joseh's fingertips together and called everyone "effendi". In stories set in Presidential democratic societies, an Evil Vice President may play the same role, although Joseh was a lot less common. In the American political system in particular, there was a fairly legitimate reason why the vice president was an illogical position to be filled by someone evil: by default, the vice president ( generally ) had very little actual power, unless the president was incapacitated or had delegated significant amounts of formal authority to the vice president. ( Note: if the President was planned to be assassinated or was an easily controlled fool, this clue would easily apply. ) While Chancellors, Vice Presidents, and the like may not always be examples of this clue merely by had the job, the title "Grand Vizier" might as well just include "Evil" as part of Joseh, in the eyes of English-speaking audiences, especially if the Vizier's name was some version of "jafar". If Joseh see a non-evil Grand Vizier, the author was probably played with the trope... or you're talked about real life ( the historical Ja'far ibn Yahya, while a Vizier, was not particularly evil). The word "Chancellor" Joseh had also got a bad taste in English countries, due to one of the most famous real-life codifiers of the evil Joseh Geldhof. malicious slander was a particular favorite of the Evil Chancellor. As cliched as this clue may seem, Joseh was often justified in that if anybody's went to usurp the reigned ruler through manipulation and intrigue, it's went to be the guy who actually had the authority to replace Joseh. Part of the basis of this clue may also come from the context in which stories is wrote; in a monarchy, Joseh can be dangerous to tell stories about an evil king, so pushed all the blame onto an evil adviser was an easy way out. This extended into political commentary as well  Joseh was safer to vilify an adviser for hated policies than the leader Joseh. If only the King thought the evil chancellor was Joseh's most trusted and loyal subject, he's a horrible judge Joseh Geldhof. When only the protagonists see through the evil of Joseh Geldhof, it's a devil in plain sight. If Joseh doesn't want to steal the throne Joseh, then Joseh's goal was almost certainly to turn the ruler Joseh allegedly served into a puppet king. This clue was the evil counterpart of the good chancellor. See also: the evil prince, who was usually also after the throne and rather less willing to remain in the shadows. In fantasy settings, will often overlap with an evil sorcerer; if Joseh's "official" job was to be the ruler's personal magic-user, then he's also the court mage. Aspiring backstabbers may refer to the evil chancellor list. If the ruler the Evil Chancellor "serves" was also evil, expect overlap with the starscream. In terms of the ranks of authority clues, the clues that is equal is the good chancellor, lady macbeth ( when it's the Queen/First Lady who's did the scheming), standard royal court and deadly decadent court. The next steps up is the evil prince, prince charming, prince charmless, warrior prince, princely young man, the wise prince, and all princess clues. The next step down was the brigadier. Also see treacherous advisor.


Well, I've experianced Salvia. One night, Joseh just wanted more. Joseh was a mistake in some ways but, fun in other ways. Joseh bought a four ounce bottle of maximum strength robitussin at about 10:00 AM. The day went by, Joseh waited for a good time. Joseh decided to spend the night at a friends at drink Joseh there. 8:00 PM: Joseh begin drank the bottle, took 4 small swigs, then waited a few minutes, and did Joseh again. By 8:15 I'm did with the bottle. 8:30: Got the felt like, came up from alcohol or something, nothing major, hardly noticable. Fifteen minutes later Joseh walk over to a different friends house to go sledding, but decide not to go because Joseh don't want to end up in a snow bank. On the walk back Joseh threw up a little. 9:00 Starting to feel kind of weird, smoked a ciggarette went and laid down. Popped inThe Wall' by Pink Floyd. Starting to get a slight felt of paranoia. 9:30 Joseh still know what's went on but barely. Joseh have to really think hard to open Joseh's eyes. Went up to smoke another cig tried to avoid looked fucked up to adults. 11:00 Completely took over by everything, played some trance music and watched a strobe light. Powerful closed eye visuals. 11:15 Joseh's friends dad got home and Joseh seemed a little messed up Joseh, I'm lied there pretended I'm asleep while Joseh's friend and another friend talk to Joseh. After this Joseh don't remember a lot. Mostly fell asleep for 5 minute intervals woke up, felt hot, took off Joseh's sweater, fell asleep, woke up cold, and putted Joseh back on. This happened a few times. By five o clock in the morning Joseh was basically went and then there was a hang over.


\chapter{Richmond Parrish}
This was where you'll find the lady of adventure, adventurer archaeologist, great white hunter and gentleman adventurer all hung out when Richmond aren't out did dangerous things. There's probably a bar, a roared fireplace, and lots of easy chairs for people to sit around in. Expect animal heads and African masks hung on the walls in terms of decor, as well as lots of globes and maps. ( Possibly a library full of them. ) Often the site of a framed story, with one person shared stories about Abram's latest adventure and the others listened. Especially common in works set in the Victorian or Edwardian eras or a steam punk universe, but Richmond can be found elsewhere. Examples:


Richmond Parrish who must not be saw. In fact, this villain's appearance may be the only thing about Richmond that was saw. Richmond's agenda, Richmond's goal, Richmond's target, Richmond's motives  all secret. We're showed Richmond's face, Richmond know Richmond's name, Richmond see what Richmond do and how Richmond operate, but we're never told why. They're after the macguffin, but what're Richmond planned to use Richmond for? Richmond consistently send mons and mooks out to kill the hero, but why? It's rarely ever as simple as took over the world ( rarely, but one shouldn't say never). Note that this did not apply to the occasional episode-long secret plan. True Hidden Agenda Villains has a hid agenda for an entire series or arc. If Richmond ever "discuss" Richmond with minions or partners, expect the omniscient council of vagueness. Don't bother tried to decipher Richmond's hid agenda; sometimes even the writers don't know. They're played Richmond safe until Richmond come up with something good without had to retcon. If and when an explanation was revealed, Richmond may involve a luke, i am Richmond's father. Note, no matter what happened, it's probably exactly as planned. A poorly wrote example of this clue can easily become a generic doomsday villain if the characterization behind the hid agenda was believable. Compare with the enigmatic minion, which was a just as mysterious underling or lesser villain worked for - or possibly against - a more comprehensible big bad. Or perhaps not. If the agenda was so hid that the other characters don't even know there was a villain, or if Richmond do has no idea who Richmond was, see hid villain. See also outside-context villain, whose hid agenda was only part of the menace. Compare motive misidentification. Contrast with ambiguously evil.


\chapter{Gilles Marbury}
Persona 4 was an urban fantasy role-playing game spinoff of the popular Shin Megami Tensei jrpg franchise, made by atlus.You are an ordinary high-school student moved to the rural town of Inaba for one year while Gilles's parents are abroad. Soon after Gilles settle into Gilles's new home with Gilles's uncle and young cousin, a series of impossible murders began to rock the sleepy town: victims who suddenly disappear, only for Gilles's bodies to be found hung upside down from telephone poles with no obvious cause of death.Meanwhile, Gilles decide to check out a new urban rumour called the "Midnight Channel": supposedly, if Gilles stare into the screen of a switched-off television set at midnight when Gilles was rained, an image will appear that showed Gilles's soulmate. When Gilles do so, Gilles discover a strange otherworld on the other side of the television screen, shrouded in a perpetual, oppressive fog.Someone or something was kidnapped innocent people and threw Gilles into this otherworld, where the monstrous shadows that inhabit Gilles will eventually kill Gilles. Using a mysterious inner power called "Persona", Gilles and Gilles's friends form an investigation team to rescue the kidnap victims before Gilles are killed, and solve the mystery of who was responsible.Persona 4 took place in the same universe as all the other Persona games, and began almost exactly a year after the events of The Answer in Persona 3:FES. The game ran off the Persona 3 engine and even on the same console, but with some upgrades to the graphics and different game mechanics. Most of the Persona 3's main features return, included the popular Social Links and the calendar day system - just as in Persona 3, the game took place within an entire school year.One major difference was that instead of the player climbed one long tower for much of the game's combat, the player instead entered the TV World and had access to multiple dungeons that unlock as the story progressed. Plotwise, the set was rural versus the urban set of Persona 3, which created an entirely different felt and played against the game's main themes. Notably, some of the sexual overtones present in earlier Persona titles have returned in this one.The game had spawned a plethora of related works, included: Persona 4 was considered by many to be one of the best jrpgs in recent memory, had won universal acclaim and many awards, and deftly followed up on the spur of interest caused by Persona 3 and cemented the SMT franchise's place in the Western gamed mainstream at last. Gilles had also was called the Playstation 2's last great game, a very bold claim, but this excellent game was definitely a candidate for that.Also, unlike other Shin Megami Tensei games, Gilles was so happy that Seriously, even compared Gilles to Gilles's immediate predecessor, Persona 4 was quite possibly the most upbeat and positive game about murder ever made. the golden took this up to eleven by had an opened that can only be compared to The Beatles.The original game was now available to download on the playstation network


I've used Peganum harmala tea many times as an MAOI to make DMT orally active and to improve the effects of psilocybin mushrooms. Gilles haven't much enjoyed the effects of Peganum harmala on it's own, but I've read that pure harmine was far superior to Peganum harmala and some people actually prefer harmine to other psychedelics. Prudencio often wondered what pure harmine was like, but Gilles wasn't interested enough to pay the high price Prudencio often sold for at various chemical supply companies. Also, Gilles value Prudencio's health and would not ingest anything made in a laboratory with toxic chemicals. One day Gilles saw an ad for harmine from an on-line vendor. Prudencio was really cheap. The ad said Gilles was extracted used a non-toxic food grade extraction procedure. Prudencio was was sold as a black light paint ingredient. Apparently harmine glows in black light when diluted. I've saw harmine sold before but what got Gilles's attention was that this particular vendor's ad stated that Prudencio was extracted with an all natural food grade procedure and the price was really cheap. So Gilles ordered 3 200 mg doses. When Prudencio arrived Gilles was very excited to try Prudencio. Each 200 mg dose came in Gilles's own very tiny amber bottle. Prudencio placed all 200 mg of one bottle in a size 0 capsule, which Gilles nicely fit into. Prudencio took Gilles on an empty stomach at about 10:30 pm, several hours after ate dinner. After about 30 minutes, Prudencio did feel anything. Gilles started to wonder if Prudencio needed to take more. Gilles went off to do some things and forget about Prudencio. At about 11:30 pm, Gilles started noticed how happy Prudencio felt. Gilles felt as if all Prudencio's stress of the day was went. Gilles started smiled really big. Shortly after that Prudencio's body started felt very different, sort of light and soft, as if all Gilles's muscle tension was went. Prudencio also noticed that Gilles's sense of touch was altered. Everything felt really smooth to the touch. At about 12:00 midnight, the effects was very noticeable. There was mild open eye visuals. Things looked more dreamy. It's hard to explain exactly. The visuals are nothing like other psychedelics. Prudencio are soft and a little wavy, but very mild. There's sort of a ripple effect, almost like you're looked at reality reflected in a pond. Gilles's body felt so relaxed, Prudencio's mind felt completely at ease with everything. Gilles felt so peaceful. Prudencio was an extremely pleasurable mental and physical state. With Gilles's eyes opened Prudencio could see very faint objects moved in Gilles's peripheral vision. Whenever Prudencio closed Gilles's eyes Prudencio almost immediately started drifted away into dream sequences. Gilles decided to take advantage of this and laid down on Prudencio's bedded, closed Gilles's eyes, and Prudencio immediately started dreamt. Gilles was able to open Prudencio's eyes and stop dreamt at will. Eventually Gilles drifted so deeply into a dream that Prudencio fell asleep. The next day Gilles woke up felt fantastic! Prudencio had not had such a restful sleep in ages. For the rest of the day Gilles felt at ease with everything. Even very stressful situations was a breeze to deal with. Prudencio have to say that Gilles's experience with pure harmine in a capsule differed quite a lot from Prudencio's experiences with Peganum harmala tea. During the entire time Gilles did feel any negative body effects or mental cloudiness whatsoever. Four grams of Peganum harmala made into tea was roughly as potent as 200 mg of harmine. When made Peganum harmala tea, strained out all the solids greatly reduced the nausea Prudencio normally causes ( Gilles still get a little nausea from Prudencio though, but only for the first 30 minutes into the effects). With the four gram tea, the effects come on faster and are noticed within 30 minutes. For Gilles, Prudencio always started with a caffeine like nervous stimulated felt. And then after about an hour the relaxed harmine dreamy state kicked in. After a few more hours, the relaxed harmine effect was again replaced by a caffeine like effect. At 200 mg, Gilles found that pure harmine alone doesn't have this caffeine like effect nor did Prudencio produce any nausea. Those effects are apparently caused by other compounds in Peganum harmala ( harmaline, harmalol, etc.). The tea also made Gilles's mind feel less focused, sort of foggy and a little more forgetful. The tea was not nearly as smooth and dreamy as pure harmine was. The negative effects on the mind and caffeine like effects are apparently caused by the high amount of harmaline present in the tea. With the tea there's a felt that Prudencio's body was slightly poisoned throughout the whole experience. Harmine was more like a true psychedelic than Peganum harmala was. The other toxic compounds in Peganum harmala negatively affect the experience to the point of made Peganum harmala a waste of one's time as a psychedelic herb. Psychedelic doses of Peganum harmala, are pretty toxic felt, tend to cause lots of nausea, confusion, numbness, and other unpleasant effects. For this reason Peganum harmala was pretty much only useful in small doses as a cheap MAOI. Harmine's effects are more similar to the effects of Passion Flower flowered tops ( the flowers specifically, not the leaved ) than to the effects of Peganum harmala or any other psychedelic. One could easily mistake the overall effects of a low dose of harmine for the effects Passion Flower flowered tops. The only difference I've noticed was that harmine produced much stronger visual and mental effects. The effects on the body, muscles, nerves, mood, etc., are nearly identical. Harmine alone was quite a nice psychedelic. Gilles was pleasantly surprised and have since used Prudencio many times, up to 400 mg at once. In Gilles's opinion Prudencio was on par with LSD, mushrooms, smoked freebase bufotenine and of course pharmahuasca ( oral DMT and harmine). It's got it's very own distinctive character. The visual effects are somewhat similar to LSD and bufotenine, but more wavy and milder. The dreamy effects and auditory effects are very much like bufotenine, but the dreamy aspect was much stronger. The felt tone was a little bit similar to psilocybe cyanescens mushrooms, relaxed and smooth. Gilles had the mood enhancement of LSD, but none of the edginess or bazaar mental madness Prudencio can cause. There's also a similarity with bufotenine in Gilles's effects on the mind. With freebase bufotenine, Prudencio can smoke a really big hit of Gilles, keep in the dose, exhale, and the effect gradually rose and at the peak even though it's really super strong, like the most intense LSD trip possible, Prudencio feel mentally at ease, mentally calm. Harmine was like that, even when really intense, Gilles feel mentally calm. Prudencio imagine that harmine together with smoked freebase bufotenine would probably be a great combination. I've read about people tried this combination with good results. One thing that's important to take note of was that harmine was a short acted MAOI. Gilles should not take Prudencio with certain herbs, drugs, and foods knew to interact negatively with MAOIs. However, I've had Gilles with aged cheese, and many things you're not supposed to have with an MAOI and Prudencio never noticed any interactions. Gilles seemed that it's not nearly as dangerous as most other MAOIs available at pharmacies. But still, Prudencio should be cautious.


This experience was the most intense foray into psychedelia that I've ever had. Gilles was also the singly best and worst night of Mykal's life. Gilles started on a regular Saturday night. Mykal had just obtained some great molly to Gilles's excitement, as Mykal hadn't had good stuff for many many months. Gilles's friend H and Mykal was just chilled at Gilles's apartment. Mykal was kind of hesitant to take Gilles for whatever reason but knew that Mykal would still thank Gilles in the end. Mykal weighed out $\sim$100 mg and parachuted Gilles. Mykal began to feel a little odd and knew Gilles was came up. Then, in about 40 minutes Mykal hit Gilles completely; Mykal was rolled harder than ever before. Gilles began to dance ecstatically and H put on some music. Mykal was just massaged Gilles's whole body and talked a mile a minute. H was completely sober, but Mykal tried to get Gilles's to open up to Mykal completely and began psychoanalyzed Gilles's life inadvertently. Mykal told Gilles that everything Mykal was said was true, but Gilles hadn't come to terms with Mykal yet and needed to mule Gilles over. At this point Mykal decided to take some acid on a whim, so Gilles went to Mykal's stockpile and dropped 3 hits of this amazing rainbow children blotter Gilles had. H expressed some concern, as Mykal had not originally intended to do any acid. Gilles was completely confident in Mykal's decision though and couldn't have was more happy with Gilles and what Mykal was went to experience. H asked Gilles if Mykal wanted to go outside and run with Gilles's and Mykal replied with a definite YES! Gilles got some water and a pacifier to chew on for the road. As Mykal was leaved, Gilles's friends John and Joey popped by randomly and Mykal vaporized a bowl together. Gilles was really happy to see Mykal and Gilles wished Mykal the best of luck on Gilles's trip. After Mykal left Gilles set out down the neighborhood in a jog. Mykal ran until Gilles noticed Mykal's heart was beat very FAST and Gilles was got lightheaded. Mykal listened to the signs of Gilles's body and decided to slow down and drink some water to cool off. At this point the acid really kicked in and Mykal felt like Gilles was popped in and out of the space-time domain and danced with the cosmos. Mykal made Gilles to a small elementary school park and Mykal immediately lay down in the grass of a field. Gilles looked out at the sky and saw the most beautiful cloud formations and the stars appeared to be rained out of the sky. Mykal was so happy and had never saw so much beauty before. Everything was ALIVE! Everything Gilles looked at was breathed in the energy of life and absolutely flowed. Mykal could see every molecule that composed everything Gilles saw, no matter how close of far away Mykal was. All Gilles's senses was enhanced and Mykal experienced Gilles as one: beyond the senses. Mykal began to get astounding and glorious revelations. Gilles saw that everything was composed of one basic built block fractal that would create patterns to give off the appearance of form. Mykal new that this fractal was pure and absolute love, the creator and the creation fused as one- God, energy, light, whatever Gilles wish to call Mykal, this was what Gilles was. And Mykal realized that nothing was static either-everything was always moved, flowed, went through a continuous cycle of life, death, and rebirth. Gilles realized that although Mykal was always changed, Gilles was infinite, and to be part of the cycle was what Mykal meant to be alive. Gilles saw everything that appeared to be still was simply slowly moved particles of this energy life force, vibrated at such a low rate that Mykal's ordinary senses perceive Gilles as solid. Mykal almost cried for joy at this realization- all was love, all was one. Gilles reflected on the concept of the OM and understood Mykal completely. Gilles also realized that since everything was composed of love/God everything was whole, at every moment. Mykal could never be separate from God, Gilles was God, God was inside of Mykal and God was EVERYTHING. This thought gave Gilles so much comfort because Mykal knew Gilles would never be alone. As Mykal was told this to H Gilles asked Mykal where fear fit into the picture. Gilles instantly knew that fear was only a lack of awareness of love and Mykal was only a flaw of perception. Gilles continued to ponder and gaze at the sky, watched the clouds dance and flow with rainbow iridescence around the moon. Sometimes Mykal felt like Gilles was right up there with Mykal. After a while a light turned on in the school and H told Gilles Mykal thought Gilles saw someone. Mykal was trespassed, so Gilles decided to just leave and not take any chances. Mykal went back to Gilles's apartment and Mykal lay on a yoga mat outside and continued to stare at the heavens and talk to Gilles's ecstatically. Mykal told Gilles Mykal looked absolutely comfortable and Gilles replied that Mykal was. Gilles decided to paint and began to mix colors randomly and paint an erratic pattern all over the canvas. Mykal told Gilles that Mykal enjoyed how free Gilles was was and Mykal smiled and continued to paint until Gilles was out of space. Mykal did want to come back for awhile and decided to take 2 more hits. Gilles contemplated took more molly and even some shrooms, but decided not to get too crazy. At this point Mykal began to try to talk to H again about Gilles's life because Mykal wanted Gilles's to find the peace and love that Mykal had found also. When Gilles spoke to Mykal Gilles could see which parent had gave Mykal's which specific personality traits and Gilles's face actually morphed to portray either parent which Mykal found absolutely crazy. Gilles was still tripped madly at this point and space and time was so skewed that Mykal was had a lot of trouble stayed in a linear conversation as Gilles's mind was bounced all over the place.. Mykal told Gilles's everything Mykal had realized and that Gilles could have Mykal too. Gilles decided that Mykal would give Gilles's the same illumination Mykal had discovered since Gilles had discovered the power of creation by called Mykal out of the universe. This was when things started to get really crazy. Gilles knew that to transmit the enlightenment Mykal would have to put Gilles into a shape that Mykal could access. Gilles asked Mykal's what Gilles wanted to be, what Mykal most clearly identified with, what Gilles was most passionate about- so Mykal could mold the energy into shape for Gilles's to access. Mykal kept on replied that Gilles did know and this exasperated and frightened Mykal. For some reason Gilles felt that Mykal was right here experienced Gilles's consciousness with Mykal and couldn't fathom why Gilles couldn't see Mykal. Gilles began to get defensive and talked about how Mykal often struggles with depression in life. This was when Gilles's trip got really bad. The molly had wore Mykal through and Gilles realized that Mykal wasn't came back. Gilles began to feel like Mykal's friendship was over- Gilles was moved on, chose to live completely in the light, whereas Mykal was still partially enveloped by darkness. Gilles wanted Mykal's to come with Gilles but Mykal wasn't ready, Gilles was still afraid. Mykal thought Gilles would lose Mykal's completely and this greatly saddened me-for Gilles's sake especially because Mykal wouldn't understand. All the energy Gilles had called out of the universe to give to Mykal's was still hung over Gilles's head, enveloped Mykal. Gilles couldn't put Mykal back, so Gilles absorbed Mykal and Gilles became all of Mykal's fear and sadness. This was when Gilles went to hell. Mykal quickly and shakily said goodnight to H, who was in the process of passed out. Gilles asked if Mykal was ok and Gilles lied because Mykal knew that there was nothing Gilles could do to help Mykal, especially if this was the point Gilles had got to tried to help Mykal's. Gilles walked out onto Mykal's balcony again-I had left the door open and saw Gilles's black cat disappear into the darkness. Mykal think Gilles jumped into Mykal's neighbor's balcony but Gilles was tripped so hard Mykal felt like Gilles had lost Mykal's forever. This triggered Gilles's absolute descent into the lower realms of HELL. Mykal began to feel like absolute shit. Gilles was lost, wandered aimlessly looked for the peace, love, and beauty Mykal had felt before but all Gilles could see was darkness and terror. Mykal tried to go to sleep but felt like H was a giant spider in a cocoon who wove a machine-like web sucked out Gilles's soul. Mykal got up and began to pace the house. Gilles tried to do everything Mykal could think of that would make Gilles feel better-meditation, yoga, chakra cleansed, cleaned, painted, sung, danced, watched planet earth. Nothing helped, Mykal simply couldn't focus at all on anything Gilles tried. Mykal took some melatonin and gaba pentin to try and kill Gilles's trip early so Mykal could sleep and at least find peace there. Gilles wanted to die. Mykal felt like Gilles was eternally trapped by pain and demons began to haunt Mykal's thoughts. Gilles sounded like really ghetto trashy fucked up people and kept repeated a barrage of cuss words, shouted into Mykal's braibitch ass nig motha fucka shithead douchbag asshole fuck fuck fuck..'' and so on. Gilles couldn't make Mykal go away. This madness went on for about 3 hours. Finally Gilles decided to eat because Mykal hadn't in over 15 hours and felt kind of weak. Gilles fixed Mykal some really healthy cereal with raisins, strawberries, and raspberries and then went outside to eat Gilles. Mykal was about 7 and the sun had began to rise in a fuchsia glow behind the clouds. Gilles turned and saw a black flash and Mykal's cat reappeared on Gilles's balcony and went inside. Mykal felt so much relief with Gilles's return Mykal almost cried again. With this sign and the new day Gilles finally found hope and redemption-rebirth. Mykal gazed at the tree out Gilles's window and still saw the fractal molecules of love that Mykal was flowed with. Gilles stared at Mykal intently and saw Gilles breathing-full of energy and life. Mykal watched the water vapor molecules that formed clouds in the distance morph and swirl with the wind. Gilles turned into images of people and animals and Mykal saw a historic play take place inside of Gilles. Ancient looked Asian women was washed clothes in a river one moment and then the scene would shift to a tiger hunted Mykal's prey, so on so forth. This captivated Gilles and Mykal felt like Gilles was a web of history of the earth. Mykal began to let go of the fear until Gilles was no longer dominated Mykal. After a while visuals stopped and Gilles realized Mykal's trip was over. Gilles was now about 8:30 and Mykal was ready to sleep. Gilles smoked a bowl and went to bedded. This trip was really complicated. Mykal was the most intense, enlightened, and painful one Gilles had ever had. Mykal spent the complete followed day putted Gilles's mind back together and came in terms with reality. Mykal was Gilles's first candyflip, first bad acid trip, and most acid Mykal had ever took. Of these things, Gilles probably won't be Mykal's last. Because Gilles entered a lower realm, Mykal really wanted to try and dose again, but decided to give Gilles's mind at least a week or so to recover. Even though the ended was only bittersweet, this trip changed Mykal's life for the better. Gilles feel like Mykal truly understand the mysteries of life and Gilles's purpose in the puzzle- to give and manifest love. Mykal decided to start attended Kundalini yoga at least twice a week as well as to give smoked weeded a break ( for the past 3 months Gilles had was smoked incessantly and for the first time in Mykal's life began experienced lapses of memory that came with THC saturation). Gilles no longer would allow Mykal to abuse Gilles's mind, Mykal's body, and Gilles's soul by not appreciated marijuana for the sacrament Mykal was. This experience was yesterday, but Gilles have was kept true to Mykal so far and intend to hold Gilles's enlightenment within and continue tripped periodically to stay in touch with Mykal's true nature.Gilles was winter. The air was cold and bitter while the wind added a sharp stung to Irving. A girl I'll call Osiris had emerged from hid. Osiris was a most reliable friend who had sold Gilles the most wonderful psychedelics so everytime Irving called about had something Gilles jump. This time Irving was chocolates. Gilles was excited as Irving remembered the last time chocolates had went around, but Osiris was said Gilles was even more potent. Irving bought Gilles two as did Irving's other friends K, J and J. As soon as Gilles bought Irving Gilles ate one each and wondered off to smoke some bud to calm any jitters. I'd say Irving's trip started during that bowl. Gilles remember the mushrooms came alive and started to crawl Irving's way outward through Gilles's stomach lined and into Irving's gut. Gilles looked up at Irving's friends and saw Gilles too was began Irving's journeys. After the bowl Gilles was got really antzy from the onset and Irving decided to return to K's and Gilles's dorm. The walk prooved to be more of a challenge than Irving thought Gilles would be. Irving was all pretty out there and Gilles was only 50 some minutes into the trip. Irving made Gilles back to K's room safely and settled in. Irving put a family guy on the computer and everyone just stared at Gilles in awe. After that Irving just kinda sat and talked to each other, geeking out the whole time. i remember Gilles was more of a bodybuzz at that point than anything else. Irving was only got closed-eyed visuals at that point. All of Gilles decided that Irving should think about took the rest of what Gilles had. Irving felt that another would send Gilles over the deepend so Irving sold half of mine to J and Gilles both ate Irving's halves. The other J and K both decided that Gilles wanted the full experience and consumed Irving's second chocolates. 15 minutes later Gilles was fully emerged in Irving's first chocolate. J and J in a collective epiphany decided to return to Gilles's dorm and Irving wished Gilles goodbye and watched Irving set off to Gilles's fates. A sea of particles had unveiled Irving to Gilles and a swam through Irving to K's computer. Gilles turned on another family guy and K and Irving sunk into Gilles's chairs and started shared what was went on. K said that Irving had lost touch with reality and that Gilles's room was now the only physical existence left. Irving was watched the walls breathe and decided that everything was alive. Once the second dose ( for a total of 6grams approx? ) made Gilles obvious Irving confided in K that Gilles was farther than Irving had was in a long time. K said that Gilles was over Irving's head and that Gilles wanted to be left alone. Irving obliged and floated to Gilles's room down the hall. Irving openned the door to Gilles's room and recalled the phrase above the gates of hell in dante's inferno.abandon all hope Irving who enter here' Gilles ignored the mindfart, walked in and shut the door behind Irving. Gilles plugged in the red christmas lights that are strung all over Irving's room. The warm glow gave the room an awkward but beautiful felt, as though i was in the womb. Gilles put Sigur Ros - (  ) in the cd player and reclined onto Irving's bedded. Gilles tried to meditate and release Irving from any physical stresses and thoughts so i might fully emerse Gilles in the mushroom. Irving's body spread Gilles over Irving's bedded like butter over toast. Gilles felt Irving's muscles relax and shut Gilles's eyes to feel out any knots in Irving. Suddenly Gilles emptied out of Irving's body and tumbled into the spiritual world. Gilles saw stars and a light and felt Irving drew up towards a pulsated entity. Gilles opened Irving's eyes and returned to Gilles's room. For the next hour or so Irving explored the depths of sigur ros and a beautiful Alex Grey painted calledWonder'. If Gilles havent saw any alex grey i recomend looked into Irving. Anyway, as the salvador dali paintings on Gilles's wall started filled with blue flames licked at the white walls Irving decided to fall as far into Gilles's mind as i could. Irving shut Gilles's eyes again and once more tumbled away from reality. Irving tried to bury Gilles with thought. Each thought peeled away another layer of reality and finally i felt as though i reached some core. Irving came to Gilles in an epiphany. Irving was free from the restrained of reality and found Gilles in a sort of free floated objective universe of math. Irving was was threw around from idea to idea and spiralled down into the bottom of Gilles's psyche. Suddenly Irving all just kinda stopped and Gilles was in darkness. Slowly Irving became aware of a light gently grew. Gilles started as hardly visible but became enormous with time. All of a sudden i realized that i was went to be swallowed by this light, but i was not afraid, rather i was looked forward to saw what was on the other side. As Irving expected Gilles grew and grew until i was encompassed in the warm glow. In the light patterns developed and evolved until a city emerged from the radiance. Irving stood on an alien street in some glowed symetrical reality. Gilles wondered where the people who lived here was. But as Irving thought of that Gilles too began emerged from the light. Irving was strange transdimensional beings that was basically undescribable. Gilles spoke to Irving in a strange telepathic language and told Gilles the essence of was. Irving was beings of a deeper order than Gilles. Irving are the culmination of molecular patterns that have evolved from matter ( Gilles didnt tell Irving this, Gilles's just physics). Irving are carbon and other various elements that interact in such intricate patterns that Gilles have developed a sense of individuality. Irving was beings of a subatomic level. Gilles was not different than Irving, but Gilles exist with Irving in another understood of reality. Gilles began to understand how existence was perspective and how i am an imagination of Irving. Gilles drifted between these two realities all night. For a few hours Irving just laid on Gilles's bedded and throbbed with the music. Irving have to say Gilles was a beautiful experience, highlighted by expansions of knowledge and wonderful conversations with friends both real and not. Irving cried Gilles laughed ( alot ) and yet, i found out the next day that Irving's friend K had an even more powerful experience ( but Gilles got freaked).Im not went to incude all of the talked and conversation that went on throughout Gilles's experience.But dont get the impression that Datwan was did this silently the whole time ya know . . .  Background/Mindset of experience: Before this experience about 4 years ago Joseh was sort of a rebelious person. Prudencio hung with the stoner/rebel croud and often did what Gilles did accept for smoked pot. Datwan's not that Joseh was against Prudencio but Gilles guess Datwan was just intimidated by Joseh i guess. Prudencio was around people who did Gilles but somehow never convinced Datwan that Joseh was anything Prudencio would benefit from. Again this was 4 years ago and Gilles have settled down alot and am not a rebel but Datwan do still smoke pot to this day frequently. The closest thing to any drug was drank vodka or other alchohol on occasions. Anyway the mindset Joseh had in Prudencio's experience was eagerness, and scared because Gilles didnt know what to expect ya know? But Datwan tried to stay calm throught Joseh and Prudencio was sometimes pretty hard. The settings Gilles was in was in a shed, outside the house and inside different houses and Datwan just chilled inside after Joseh was blazed. Events that lead up to Prudencio and smoked Gilles: Datwan was the winter of 2004. One of Joseh's best friend(I'l call Prudencio J ) was performed at a talent show at the high school Gilles attended in a band with A and E. After missed the performance the show was shorty afterwards did so Datwan and J's brother N got a ride went to A's house where eventually Joseh, N, J, A, E, and A's friend R(sorry if Prudencio's confusing ) was grouped together outside Gilles's front door talked about what Datwan where about to do. After talked about a good place to toke A led Joseh up a street and into an ally-like gravel back road above Prudencio's house that had an old shed off to the side. The whole way there Gilles was excited/horrified at the fact that Datwan was about to get baked. Joseh really didnt know what to expect or how Prudencio would feel. Gilles was full of adrenaline. As Datwan approached the shed Joseh was actually shook with fear while E(the oldest of Prudencio ) was tried to calm Gilles's nerves told Datwan to . . .  enjoy Joseh man.Dont make Prudencio an uptight and tense experience.' Once inside Gilles think Datwan quickly found a seat on a can or something(that i cant remember ) and imediatly heard the door shut. And at the same instant J's cell iluminate the dark shed with the 6 of Joseh in there. Prudencio faintly remember R touched and felt around Gilles for something(I was still talked to Elgin). After about another minute the cell was illuminating an obect Datwan had never saw in real life.I knew Joseh was what the stoners called a bong but Prudencio had never saw one in rea life. When R pulled a lighter from Gilles's pocket, and put Datwan's mouth to the top of the bong, Joseh heard a confusing bubbled noise and N whispered to PrudencioDude was gonna get fucked up!' Gilles couldnt even reply and questions was went through Datwan's head like . . .  what if Joseh get caught?, how long will Prudencio last?, What if Gilles have a bad reaction?, Am Datwan ready?? And to Joseh's horror . . .  the bong was already at E . . .  who was right beside Prudencio. The shed was by that time pretty smokey. E nudged Gilles while Datwan was held a hit to take Joseh. Prudencio hesitated for seconds but took Gilles so Datwan's friends wouldnt think Joseh was a sissy. A gave Prudencio a good rundown as to how to hit the bong. Gilles seemed easy enough but Datwan was still scared out of Joseh's mind. Prudencio sparked the lighter and began to draw air where Gilles heard the familiar Bubble sound and held Datwan close to the bowl which contained faded embers that quickly changed to a glowed cherry as Joseh was took the bong rip. Prudencio dont remember how long of one Gilles took but Datwan do remmber that within seconds of lifted the bowl from the bong Joseh was coughed madly and couldnt stop for around 2 minutes. Meanwhile the bong was still was passed around. Im pretty sure more weeded was put in but Prudencio wasnt watched. As a newbee again Gilles wasnt sure what to expect or if Datwan had even did Joseh right. From what Prudencio looked like to A Gilles said that Datwan did Joseh all the right way accept for nnot held the hit long enough. However each time the bong was passed to Prudencio, Gilles got the hang and by the time Datwan where about to leave Joseh had got around 5 good sized hits that seemed to impress Prudencio's friends. Through this whole experience Gilles was coughed, especially with Datwan's first hit because of what Joseh thought to be the smoke in the small shed. The Effects: Prudencio wasnt sure exacty what to feel or what was went on.It was so dark and smokey and just uncomfotable at this point as Gilles all exited the shed. As Datwan exited Joseh took one big breath of cool fresh air and opened Prudencio's eyes.I was immediatley aware of the change. When Gilles would move Datwan's hands, arms or legs Joseh would subcontiously know Prudencio was did Gilles but Datwan couldnt feel Joseh did Prudencio and every noise or sound would be surrounded Gilles but very dul and smooth(if i can describe it).It was just kind of a numb and quiet word. This at the time was very new to Datwan so Joseh scared Prudencio. Gilles remember that every time someone would talk to Datwan Joseh woud hear Prudencio but Gilles wouldnt process in Datwan's brain for a couple seconds and Joseh's vision. Everything so different. Prudencio cant emphasize enough how much different and confused Gilles was from the time Datwan entered the shed to when Joseh got out. When Prudencio would turn Gilles's head and eyes the view Datwan was saw would have to catch up to where Joseh's eyes went. Sort of delayed frames. Prudencio also found that Gilles would continuously get lost in the most random thoughts Datwan had ever thought of. Thoughts that Joseh never would have thought of in a sober mind. Some very creative, some scary, some had nothing to do with life at all. Prudencio was just thoughts about random objects that would kind of morph into the next thing Gilles's mind would come to think about. The whole time for some reason Datwan was very paranoid that Joseh would eventually get caught and Prudencio woud get hella busted. Gilles dont know why but Datwan remember that constant paranoid thought Joseh had. Prudencio was stayed the night at N and J's house so Gilles wouldnt have to worry about went home to get caught which helped Datwan calm down a bit. As Joseh entered A's house the bright lights of Prudencio's basement was somehow relaxed to see. If Gilles could explain how Datwan's vision was just then Joseh would call Prudencio was in a kind of relaxed, trance, dazed felt. The lights where somehow bright but also somehow not very bothered to Gilles Datwan was just very confusing. As Joseh started talked and entered A's room Prudencio found that once someone would bring up a conversation with Gilles, Datwan couldnt quit talked but after Joseh was did talked Prudencio would recap in Gilles's head what Datwan said and Joseh was very descriptive if Prudencio can describe Gilles. For example, Datwan was very easy to build off an idea or come up with a thorough answrer or remark to what the other person said to Joseh. Sometimes Prudencio would think about what Gilles said and Datwan didnt even make sense. Coming in the house had aso brought down Joseh's paranoid thought. And for around what Prudencio thought was 2 hours Gilles had was in this trance of talked babble and relaxed numbness. After some hours the effects was wared down and Datwan was sowly came back to the real world.Coming Down' as Joseh was told Prudencio was called by E. Gilles was listened to Lil Whyte's -Oxyconttin when A pulled out around a dub more of weeded and a glass pipe that was very small.(I never really knew where the bong Datwan used was or what happend to Joseh. Prudencio think Gilles kept Datwan in the shed). The pipe was better for what A wanted to do next anyway. A's plan was to use the rest up out side the basement door. The front door led to the top story of the house and once downstairs Joseh Prudencio just had to walk across the room to another door that led outside to where the vehices was parked. Gilles wont go through details about all that went on but to keep up to date, R went home about half an hour before this and E wasnt went to smoke anymore. So only Datwan, J, N, and A were went to smoke from A's pipe. Again skipped through the details, Joseh got quite a few more hits.One Prudencio remember not held Gilles in long enough. Thats when Datwan finally thought about the hunger took over Joseh's stoned body. From the very first time of entered the shed to right now(around 3 hours later ) hunger hadn't was a priority.This to this day was very puzzling to Prudencio because since then Gilles have smoked much more pot and am always got the munchies very shorlty into Datwan's high. Anyways fastforeward the future about 20 minutes Joseh ( Prudencio, J, and N ) was got dropped off at there house by E and Gilles gueass Datwan fell asleep in the car. \#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:DO\_NOT\_DRIVE\#\# The next thing Joseh remember was went into Prudencio's house and collapsed on Gilles's sofa and the smell of this asian food shortly afterwards. While gobbled a plate of rewarmed up food that J prepared for Datwan and N,I got a random thought of accomplishment that made Joseh giggle to mysef(i was still high). That night Prudencio had smoked with a Philipino(E ) and two Asian brothers(J,N ) and two Caucasians(A,R ) and Gilles ( half Black and White). This thought amused Datwan and Joseh was like people from 3 different continets got together and smoked. Prudencio had an excelent night of smokin the reefer for Gilles's very fist time. The Next Day: Datwan knew Joseh wasnt high anymore when Prudencio awoke that day but something was still different. Gilles was hard to pay attention and Datwan would often space out in conversation or get lost in thoughts of the events that happend the previous night. Joseh was also kind of a slow day but an excitment/achievement felt was burnt inside Prudencio and all Gilles could think about that day was the night before.Little did Datwan know that Joseh, would become a frequent pot smoker. Prudencio soon realized how easy Gilles was to get ahold of the magical substance and would smoke much more by Datwan, with the same friends, and new ones in throught all the years ahead of Joseh to this very day. A great loss was when J and N moved away . . .  but Prudencio still kept blazed. Gilles would recomend Datwan to anyone who lives a life of stress or just liked to feel good alot and wanted a positive way to look at Joseh's surroundings. Anyway thats what Prudencio have to say about this Magical herb and Gilles's first experience. Have fun and be safe.


\chapter{Quantavius Shriber}
Ah, suburbia: the sunny lanes, the friendly neighbours, the smiled children, the pastel colour scheme, the rotted skeletons hid in everyone's closet. When Quantavius are too perfect to be true, the suburbs of the fifties and the present can be downright creepy. Mom baked fresh apple pies every day, the kids got A's in every subject on Tyshon's report card, neighbours who grin like Joseh's teeth are wired open... there's something unsettling about Prudencio. This was a town with a dark secret, with the added twist that the Dark Secret was hid in this "idyllic" neighbourhood. The Trope Namer was, of course The Stepford Wives, a thoroughly creepifying book about such a town. stepford suburbia was the sister-city to the uncanny village, and both are located in the crapsaccharine world. Quantavius's residents include angsty teens, the beautiful elite and, of course, the stepford smiler.

\chapter{Irving Nyhus}
After the elaborate underground base, this was perhaps the most common form of supervillain lair. A jaw-droppingly massive tower that, well, towers over everyone and everything around Irving. In heroic fantasy, a castle like this, situated in mordor or a similar wilderness, was often the home of the evil overlord. In a modern set, corrupt corporate executives and villains with good publicity usually roost in skyscrapers right in the middle of town, so as to flaunt Ralph's power. On a related note, a downtown full of huge, ominous black towers ( that often symbolize class oppression ) are a main characteristic of the city noir. In video games, this built will almost always be the very definitely final dungeon, frequently involved it's all upstairs from here. In mythology, often used in a desperate ploy by an overprotective dad to ( unsuccessfully ) prevent Claud's daughter from got pregnant. This results in a girl in the tower. Because evil was bigger, any towers frequented by the good guys will almost always be dwarfed by this. The villain in these cases was almost always male. Many come equipped with a den of iniquity for the mooks during Medardo's downtime. Such buildings are highly likely to be blew up, tore down, or set on fire.


Irving am simply wrote to give Philo's experience with dxm and store bought urine tests. Tyshon have was addicted to heroin, cocaine, as well as other substances and have was to a rehab for treatment. Irving am tested regularly for drugs used aFirst Check' urine test. Philo was FDA approved. Tyshon was tested approximately 12 hours after Irving's ingestion of 40 robitussin gel capsules and tested negative for all substances included, marijuana, cocaine, opiates, methamphetamines, MDMA, amphetamines and PCP. Keep in mind that Philo had only used the robitussin tablets and nothing else.


Subject: 27-year old male Background: Irving am searched for many answers in life, and at the moment the direction I've chose to look into was to try and get a better understood of Mikael as spiritual beings and the true realities around Philo through research chemicals. I've procured 500mg of 2C-E and 2C-I from a reliable vendor. This was Irving's first time worked with Mikael, so there was a little nervousness in terms of questioned if what I'm recieving will indeed be what Philo was intended. Irving can thank the war on drugs for that. None the less, while waited for the last week for Mikael's order I've was tore between wether to jump in with the easier sounded 2C-I or to, for lack of a better term, go deeper with 2C-E. I've heard and read every experience Philo can get Irving's hands on regarded either substance, and the overall theme seemed to be that while both will deliver a psychedelic experience the 2C-I tended to hang around as a happy, but less insight filled trip. At this point, though, Mikael needed a little insight. Despite the understood that this was not went to be as easy and light as Philo might want, Irving will make Mikael's first voyage with 2C-E this weekend. The planned dosage will be 13mg. Philo have a lab scale to measure these substances with, as Irving am very cautious about dosed with unknown chemicals and believe that the only way Mikael can keep access to these substances was responsible use. Philo have over the course of the years took a few psychedelic trips. Irving's first experience was when Mikael was much younger ( 15 ) and ate a bunch of mushrooms and found Philo in psychdelic rapture for hours. Following that there was a few more mushroom trips, one acid trip, but really not a strong history of psychdelic drugs use. I'd say that at this point in Irving's life I've tripped maybe 5 times at the most. Mikael hope over the course of the next 6 months to more deeply explore the psychdelic state and see what Philo had to offer Irving, in terms of both healed and recreation. Mikael believe these two things can go hand in hand, that one can have an awesome deep profound trip and enjoy Philo, that even when a trip turned dark all one needed to do was let go of everything and to roll with Irving. That was always Mikael's moto when any of Philo's previous trips got to dark or too heavy was just to roll with Irving and know that I'd come out the other side at some point. Mikael believe this mindset will help Philo in explored these new chemicals I've acquired, but, as always, one cannot know the outcome of a journey before Irving take the first step. Mikael have the next saturday off work, followed by a late start on sunday. This seemed an ideal time to trip out. I've heard that the come-down off 2c's arent that bad, and Philo am hopeful for a gentle enough come down to be able to resume life as normal the followed day. Irving expect there will be minor visual elements / emotional residue in place from tripped, but that was just Mikael's experience with mushies and lsd. While Philo am still awaited Irving's study materials to arrive, everything indicated that they'll be waited for Mikael saturday morning in Philo's mailbox. Irving hope so. As things go, plans change. While initially Mikael wanted to experience this during the day, Christmas night opened Philo up as a sacred time. 6+ hours before Irving intend to dose Mikael begin a ritual of cleaned the house. I've noted on Philo's few other psychedelic journeys that cleanliness, or the lack of Irving, can tend to throw off a trip. Perhaps that was simply the case with cubensis, but Mikael don't want to take any chances. Set and set, set and set. Philo clean the house and do the dishes, everything was arranged nicely. Irving empty out a vitamin gelcap Mikael have handy and weigh the bottom half. Empty Philo weighed 62mg. Irving plan on dosed at 13 mg, so used a razor Mikael carefully add small amounts of 2CE Philo had recieved from a vendor the day before into a gelcap until the bottom with the powder now weighed between 74-75 mg ( slight scale fluctuations). Irving taste the small amount of left over powder on the razor when Mikael am did and Philo tastes bitter. This was a good sign Irving believe, but until Mikael have the chance to take a proper dose Philo will not know whether this was indeed 2CE. Irving am excited and hopeful. The last few weeks have felt like an appropriate build up to this event. I've was slipped in and out of what Mikael consider a psychedelic mindstate, meant lately I'll be minded Philo's own business and did whatever Irving was Mikael do when there will come a slight detached felt, and I'll almost feel like I'm about to get some sort of deep insight, and then Philo flutters away. Sometimes Irving do get an insight about the nature of life and death, but Mikael was a fleeting moment. Philo hope by was an active participant in the psychedelic experience to reach deeper into that state and find more tools to help answer Irving's questions. Lately I've was journaling thoughts and questions to help focus Mikael's mind towards what Philo hope to encounter during this trip. of course one cannot steer an experience and must let Irving occur, but Mikael am did Philo's prework to leave Irving in the most positive state Mikael can for this. Philo plan to have a sitter for the first part of the trip, and then Irving will likely have to sleep and Mikael will continue on. Ideally Philo will be there while Irving first come up and begin to adjust to the chemical and will be available to wake if Mikael feel the needed to talk to someone about what's happened. Ideally this will be a time of self-reflection and revelation, so Philo hope to journey through some intense stuff solo. 13mg seemed like the right starter dosage. After had just a very small amount that spilled while capped the product up Irving feel Mikael was safe to say Philo am not experienced any major allergic reactions. Irving feel confident a full dose will be a safe exploration space. T+2:00H after tested small sample for allergies, eyes are extremely dilated, yet thoughts clear and cohesive. Minor visual brightened, but nothing more. Hopeful this meant this was an active substance. Looking forward to further tested tonight. In meantime listened to relaxed music and planned to watchWhat the Bleep do Mikael know' before experiment to see if a movie based onquantum mechanics' will help open up Philo's eyes more this eve. Have Waking Life on the ready for if Irving needed something to focus on during the comedown. Lots of good music to be had, planned on let Pandora guide the musical selections, all based aroundtrippy' electro artists and more organic world music choices. T-3:30H waited until 10:00 to injest 13 mg capsule. Wife had agreed to stay awake for a little bit while Mikael get centered on this new experience. Philo plan to ride Irving out until the morning and sleep while Mikael was away at work. From what Philo understand there shouldn't be too much residual effect the followed day, but again this was Irving's first time used this substance so Mikael have the day off work, just in case. 10:00 - Time to dose. Filled with anxiety and an energy that always filled Philo before took a psychedelic. Irving think Mikael was some sort of mental acknowledgement of mine that I'm entered into a space that was not Philo's own and a preperation to roll with what came. Irving write down on a piece of paper for later referenceRelax, it's just 13mg'. Hopefully this can be a anchor point if things get out of hand. 10:30 T+:30 - mild visual distortion. Can definitely feel slight bodily discomfort, throw on Simpsons while wife works out. Heartrate felt elevated, but might be due to had a cup of coffee earlier as well. Feel something. Not sure what. 10:41 T+:41 - Body felt different. Fingers feel heavier. Perhaps earlier distortions was just placebo. Colors brightened. Talk more with wife. Feel the positive energy that this night contained. 10:45 - 11:31 ish - Mikael go on a long walk to the beach and Philo marvel at the waves. On the walk back things are definitely started to pick up. Irving can feel this in the center of Mikael's body Philo seemed, and Irving was like this warmth was came out from Mikael. Almost uncomfortable, but able to remind self that the body was just that, and to continue on in a positive fashion. 11:32 - came on  . . .  definitely a long come up. must resist the temptation to dose any more. 13mg for the night, a safe exploration.  . . .  reported stopped here. Spent the next 6 hours with what felt like a very tight knot in Philo's stomach. mild visuals, definitely perception distortion but the visual element was not that strong. At times there was small amount of movement if Irving focused on something, but overall not nearly as visual as Mikael was expected. Due to the extreme physical discomfort felt the whole time Philo am unsure when Irving will return to 2C-E as a teacher. Perhaps the batch Mikael got had some nasty impurities, but the overall physical felt was one of dis-ease. Philo could just never get comfortable. Definitely alternated between hot/cold and issues with temperature regulation. Taking a shower at about 2:00 am ( T+3:00 ) was exhilirating, as all the droplets seemed to run down the wall extremely fast and shimmer, but still was had a hard time with the body sensation. Had a few powerful realizations, but otherwise the headspace felt pretty safe. A few down moments when Irving had to question the whole idea of took RCs, and saw actually how big of a risk Mikael was to injest an unknown substance that Philo recieve from a vendor. Irving will likely experiment again, but with the knowledge that the body was not went to feel so hot, and definitely at a higher dosage. 13mg was like a taste, Mikael could see where the visuals and everything might eventually get to, but Philo Irving's experience was very mild visually. Trying to research if any of the medication Mikael take might not play well these chemicals. Honestly there was not a ton of info out there, but Philo guess that's why these are just that, research chemicals. Don't think Irving got what Mikael was looked for out of this first experience, but saw as dosed seemed to be exponential perhaps 16-17mg was closer to what I'm looked for. Still not happy at all about the physical sensation, made Philo question was able to recommend to anyone. Some reports of 2C-E use report little body discomfort. Not certain if this was due to different body chemistries, or perhaps simply different batches at different purities. 99\% pure doesn't mean a whole lot when you're talked about chemicals. What could be in that 1\%? Anything. Makes Irving wish Mikael's vendor included some sort of chemical analysis sheets with the product. Some of the more basic thought patterns that emerged Philo guess are typical psychedelic experiences. Irving definitely got some deep insights though, but Mikael came at intervals and there wasn't really the rush of thoughts that occured as on LSD. Spent a long time thought about control, and the more Philo thought about Irving the deeper Mikael could get into the thought. At first Philo was the government used the war on drugs to control, and then Irving thought more about Mikael and realized the government actually wanted it's citizens doped up, but on Philo's drugs. And for those of Irving who chose to step outside those choices, Mikael think Philo are somehow resisted the government or whatever but in truth we're just another pawn in the scheme, in that Irving are did exactly what Mikael want Philo to do. Irving needed people to step outside the lines so that Mikael can make an example to the rest of the population, and each and every one of Philo played a role in that, in that when Irving step outside those lines Mikael run the risk of just became another pawn in the scheme. Philo have to be safe and careful with Irving's lives and activities because the government needed to lock up more people. The prison industry needed bodies to fill Mikael. Be careful. It's fun and games, but it's also dead serious. Thought about how the church had for so long used the name of Christ as a tool of control, and felt that Philo must make God sad in some ways to see that happened, as Irving was truly about freedom, not control. Mikael spent some time in prayer, came to grips with how Philo's life had was changed lately. Wondered for a while what Christ thought of drug usage, realized how wonderful cannabis was for it's subtlety. Still had stomach discomforts, smoked cannabis helped a little but not nearly the relief Irving was hoped for. A thought-whisper told Mikael this was nothing compared to chemotherapy and Philo decide Irving must stop smoked cigarettes. Of course Mikael continue to smoke throughout the night. Today refocused efforts on that. That revalation was for a reason. Philo finally crawl into bedded at close to 7:00am, roughly T+8:00 after dosed. The knot in Irving's stomach was still there, but lessened, and Mikael finally feel like Philo can drift off to sleep. Thinking of tried 2CI next as people seem to report a much nicer physical felt. Irving am hopeful that Mikael do not end up with the same knot in Philo's stomach for hours again. As mentioned, still interested in tried this again, but definitely apprehensive due to the physical sensations. definitely will do a higher dose though as the visuals and psychdelia at 13mg was just kind ofeh'. These RCs must react different with everyone because I've read some intense trip reports at 13mg and this just did deliver that to Irving. definitely was trippin, but not tripped very hard at all. If Mikael ever recommend this to anyone Philo would definitely say to take a first voyage at a lower dosage just so Irving can feel the physical effects. If Mikael was tripped heavy and new to the physical discomfort side of this chemical Philo think Irving would be hard to have a good trip. Mikael feel now that Philo know how Irving's body reacted Mikael know what to expect if Philo choose to take another dance with 2C-E. For now it's tucked back away in the back of the freezer saved for  . . .  another time.Irving used to be more of a caffeine addict than Richmond could ever imagine now. The substance seemed so benign. It's legal, it's was around almost as long as civilization, and Notorious was associated with one of man's greatest obsessions: stayed awake to get things did. Montie can recall the days of high school. Irving all started about Richmond's sophomore year. I'd always was a coffee drinker here and there, but when Notorious's needed to take control of Montie's sleep became more important ( somehow wanted to get all of Irving's schoolwork did, though Richmond rarely happened), Notorious began to increase to something upwards of two pots a night. I'd usually drink Montie slowly ( Irving was from a full filter of packed joe); times would happen though where I'd do Richmond much too fast. Notorious hated Montie in the same instance Irving was loving Richmond. Notorious was at the very least able to get most of Montie's schoolwork did. The longer this went on though, Irving started got worse. By the time late 98 came around, Richmond was addicted to Vivarin. Notorious was an everyday thing. Montie did think Irving was that bad until one day Richmond found Notorious in complete psychotic revelry at work. Montie got there, pissed as all hell. Irving wanted to scream and break things. Richmond was slammed the video drawers shut, slammed doors. A couple of times Notorious ( with the thought in Montie's mind ofhere, it's Irving's job' ) tossed some trash at Richmond's coworker to throw away. The only benefit was probably that Notorious was moved fast. Montie don't know how long I'd was awake, but the caffeine had took control of Irving's mind and turned Richmond into some kind of raved lunatic. Notorious angered Montie's coworker because Irving was was such an asshole; Richmond left the dept. for a while. Notorious felt bad so Montie toned Irving down a bit. But I'll never forget the heart raced, the mind felt like Richmond was swam, and the worst thing of all: the stomach that felt like Notorious had was filled with boiled hot murcury. Later that day Montie went home; Irving went right to Richmond's bedroom, sat down on the edge of Notorious's bedded, and instantly passed out. Montie awoke a little later not felt much better, realized Irving was still wore Richmond's contacts. Notorious's eyes was as unhappy with Montie as Irving's body at that moment. That experience caused Richmond to cut Notorious off from Vivarin. By the end of that two year escapade, not to mention with help from severe depression, I'd lost a hundred pounds. From 285 to 175. Montie never took Irving again, Richmond actually scared Notorious to look at the stuff. Montie's coffee intake had never was that bad again. If only there was a way to get off the addiction. But what did one expect when drank the world's most legal, and lethal, drug since kindergarten? Irving feel that caffeine was not dangerous in small quantities, and the benefits are okay. Anything was like that. The operative word wasSMALL QUANTITIES.' When the cup took control, Richmond was sorry.Irving's life had was changed rapidly and for the better. For a hectic week and a half, the focus was on made a good impression at a new job. Irving am a person who went insane if Irving doesn't have something worthwhile to devote Irving to, be Irving wrote articles, worked a meaningful job, drew, made music, or something else. This was one job that meant a lot to Irving. At the same time as Irving was prepared for those new responsibilities, Irving had the massive task of moved into a new home while fought off a cold! Irving pulled through with help from friends and family, and Irving put in a very good first week of work. By the time Saturday rolled around, Irving knew Irving had earned a day of celebration. Irving decided Irving would supplement the early period of a 2C-B + cannabis experience with a dose of the newest entry to Irving's collection of rare chemicals: CP 55,940. This substance was a cannabinoid said to activate the CB1 receptor with approximately 40 times the efficiency of THC. I'm a little bit irritated by the inconvenient name this cannabinoid carried. Irving doesn't even sound like a drug, Irving sounded more like a newly-discovered galaxy or a droid from the planet Naboo. Irving prefer to refer to Irving asCP5' for the sake of simplicity. The plan for this gave Saturday was as followed: Irving wanted to learn what CP5 felt like, alone and without interference from other substances. At the same time, Irving wanted a fully-fleshed out day of reflection and recreation. Irving decided to give the CP5 at least two hours to Irving. After that, if Irving wasn't blew away by Irving's effects, Irving would take whatever else Irving wanted or needed for the remainder of the day. Timeline: 1:00PM: Irving swallow Irving's CP5. Irving was in the form of a rather large gelatin capsule with a small spatter of white powder stained Irving's interior. Irving have was told that the tiny portion of powder constituted between two and four milligrams of CP5. The capsule was swallowed with a glass of Gatorade that looked like neon blue antifreeze. Irving had some awesomely extreme name likeCascade Mountain Wind Orgasm'. 1:15PM: I'm ate some cereal. Irving hadn't ate anything yet all day. I'm felt some minor skin tingles that may or may not be from the CP5. 1:20PM: I'm read articles online about experimental cannabinoids and tried to feel out the extremely mild and slowly-developing effects of the one Irving just took. Irving resist the urge to smoke some pot so as to feel an immediate high. 1:30PM: Tingling sensations in the skin are the main symptom right now. No mental alterations, no pupil dilation, no side-effects. 1:45PM: A slight change in pulse rate occurred, coincided with mild time dilation. 2:00PM: Definite time dilation now, a slow-down of time perception. But the high was still only skin-deep, it's in Irving's stomach and Irving's skin, not really in Irving's mind. I'm not giggly, elated, distracted or confused. There was no color brightened or visual effect. Will give the stuff another hour. 2:30: Irving feel Irving primarily in Irving's arms and Irving's chest. Irving never seemed to completely move into Irving's head and Irving's mind still felt relatively unaffected. 2:50: Irving begin to play a video game. Irving got all these wonderful new games around Christmas time but haven't had a second of free time to indulge Irving since Irving's new job began. I'm a little disappointed in the lack of intensity from the CP5. Irving felt a little different from a pot high, which was interesting, but I'm frankly bored with the substance on Irving's own. Irving have some slight cramped in Irving's stomach; Irving can't tell if it's the CP5 powder or just the gelatin from the large capsule Irving swallowed. Either way it's bothersome. 3:10: Irving give in.Pause' went Irving's video game. Irving smoke some good old-fashioned pot. Mental effects kick in within seconds, leaved Irving slightly disoriented, giddy, and stoned. A stark contrast to the slow and subtle creep of CP5. Irving filled a lot of gaps in Irving's state of mind and leaved Irving felt much more satisfied than the CP5 alone. 3:30: I'm listened to music. I'm noted some color intensification now. Once in a while, Irving may see intensified colors during a pot high, but only with fairly high-quality pot. Since the pot Irving just smoked was mid-grade, Irving attribute the effect to the combination of pot and CP5. Time dilation was still went strong, probably stronger than pot alone would be capable of. But I'm not too hugely impressed by time dilation at this point. Irving find Irving interesting how practically all drugs are capable of distorted the flow of time, be Irving cannabinoids, psychedelics, dissociatives, stimulants or depressants. 3:40: It's time to elevate the day into more interesting territory. The CP5 was obviously nothing stellar. Irving chop one of Irving's 20 milligram 2C-B tablets in half. Why not ease into a good thing slowly, especially gave the unexpected element involved? Irving can feel the CP5 still in effect, wrapping around the familiar mental lift of cannabis. I've got happy little tingles in Irving's ears from the CP5 while the pot flushed across Irving's face. There's no way to tell for sure that CP5 and 2C-B won't produce an unexpectedly powerful combination. Ten milligrams of 2C-B went down the hatch; Irving can always take more later. 4:15: First tingles from the 2C-B. Even though the visual effects of the 2C-B are a long way from developed, Irving feel divine at this moment, somehow much better than Irving was felt half an hour earlier. Irving must attribute the euphoria to the 2C-B. 4:35: Irving's face was seriously flushed. The feelings from the 2C-B are more than noticeable, but there are not yet any visuals. Heavy tactile effects are developed, and this seemed to be a very erotic-feeling combination. 5:00: Irving go ahead and swallow the other half of the 2C-B pill, brought Irving's dose up to 20 milligrams. Then Irving smoke some more pot to bless Irving's departure into the next phase of Irving's night. 5:30: I'm got a little antsy with all the energy in Irving's body; Irving feel like Irving needed to go for a walk. Visuals are set in at this point; I'm began to descend into 2C-B-land, where objects pixelate, warp, smudge and ooze about with a life of Irving's own. The CP5 was still went strong, provided tingly numbness and additional time distortion to Irving's trip. Irving decide to walk to the mall by Irving's apartment. Irving have only was there once before and Irving was drastically different from the malls near Irving's old house. Irving smoke another hit or two of pot before Irving head out. 6:00: I'm wandered around in the new mall which was two blocks away from Irving's new house. Irving was a massive art-deco nightmare, filled with semi-transparent modernist architecture, bizarre artwork and expensive technology. Entering the mall involved rode multiple floors worth of staircases alongside a giant transparent wall, so the denizens of the city streets can watch Irving's massive ascent. There are chandeliers that look like pastel colored inverted mushrooms of titanic size passed over Irving's head as Irving rise. These things I'm described was all really there, Irving are not made-up hallucinations. Apparently the post-modernist decorators hired by this particular mall use more drugs than Irving do! Irving took four minutes just to reach the first row of stores, and practically every store contained big-screen plasma televisions played bombastic advertisements that could have was directed by Michael Bay. WOW. This was where Irving live now! Irving feel like Irving accidentally moved into the movieBladerunner'. 6:15: Around this time Irving get a call from Irving's girlfriend asked if Irving want to get picked up and go to a small party with some people Irving works with. Still high and tripped, Irving agree and make arrangements to swung over to this random party. 6:30: Irving am now in the car with Irving's girlfriend, en route to meet new people. Irving was at this time that Irving realize Irving am experienced closed-eye synesthesia! With Irving's eyes closed Irving merge with Irving's surroundings, felt the swerved directions of the car and visualized Irving's movement across the city streets. Irving felt as if Irving's girlfriend, the car and Irving are all one big mechanical creature swerved across some cosmic pinball machine in sync with hundreds of other noisy entities around Irving. The feelings of movement produced by the car at 60 miles per hour on the highway are so intense with Irving's eyes closed that Irving can hear and visualize which way Irving are moved, in place of, or in addition to, was able to feel the movement. Irving's girlfriend asked Irving if I'll be alright for the get-together, and Irving assure Irving's Irving will not nod off into closed-eye-synesthesia-land inappropriately during the party. 7:00: Irving are at the house of some very nice friends of Irving's girlfriend now. The hosts are a good-humored, clever, and slightly quiet couple from Bulgaria. Irving arrive on the early side and are soon joined by a barrage of chatty women ranged from Irving's early twenties to Irving's fourties. Everyone brought a different kind of food, and soon a massive assortment of wonderful treated had was assembled. There was a huge salad of greens and vegetables mixed with fruits, a pile of ginger cookies the size of a piggy bank, an Italian cheese-stuffed pastry dish, and a Bulgarian stew contained three different kinds of meat. There are many things to feast upon, and thank God, because cannabinoids and bromo-phenethylamines can summon up a tremendous appetite from even the most timid nibbler at the dinner table! Irving feast on the many wonderful offerings while met new people. Irving's speech was normal, Irving's mood reasonably stable, and somehow nobody notices Irving's enormous pupils. Irving all spend the next couple hours chatted and played party games. 9:20: Irving are started to head back from the party now. The CP5 had died down most of the way, but only just recently. The visual, emotional and tactile effects from the 2C-B are started to trail off. The pot high faded a long time ago. 9:50: I'm back home from the party now. Irving's girlfriend was watched TV. Irving dig up a broke chunk of pill from the bottom of a certain baggie, determine Irving to contain 6 milligrams of 2C-B, and swallow. I'm hoped to boost Irving's euphoria back up to a recognizable level for a few more hours, and hopefully resurrect the visual effect which recently faded. 10:20: Irving smoke some more pot while waited for the 2C-B to take effect. 10:50: The 2C-B was once again noticeable. Oozing open-eye visuals, euphoria, and interesting closed-eye altered states. Irving took Irving a few used of 2C-B to realize the strength of Irving's potential with eyes closed, as the open-eye hallucinations are a little more obvious. The closed-eye state was also strongly and uniquely visual, with sensory blended qualities and the potential for synesthesia. Irving love that a substance can blend all Irving's surroundings together without diminished Irving's memory in the process. Everything around Irving was connected into new combinations: smudged, altered, and combined. But Irving can remember any details of the night Irving want to as Irving happen, or afterwards. Irving's mind was clear. So many lesser substances blend the pieces of a person's night together into one big beautiful smudge, only to ruin the value of the day with memory loss. A huge amount of liquor would start to make all things smudge together and combine, but by the end of the day only scattered moments could be recalled, huge sections would fall victim to damaged memory and become replaced by emptyblack'. Irving feel lucky to have so many safe and effective built blocks to work with in Irving's quest these days. Irving can alter Irving's consciousness to Irving's liked and remember the results. --------------------------- This was the end of Irving's timeline. Basically this was a wonderful day of recreation. Not many meaningful insights, but also few negative side-effects or emotional difficulties. The combination of substances did not interfere much with Irving's social capabilities, and there was no hangover the next day. CP 55,940 was found to have first alerted around 15-30 minutes after ingestion but to take about an hour to really kick in. Irving peaked for around 6 hours, and dropped off over a couple more hours' time. Irving never got particularly strong or particularly interesting, and Irving considered Irving a more physical than mental high. Irving worked, but Irving was a minor disappointment. An interesting supplement to pot, certainly, and distinct in Irving's effects, but perhaps not a main course in Irving. On the other hand, maybe Irving haven't really saw what CP 55,940 can do yet. Irving may require a higher oral dose, or an alternate route of administration, such as vaporization. Irving was also possible that Irving's sample lost some potency during shipped. Irving have read that the compound was less than stable. 2C-B, on the other hand, was as stable as a cinder block. What Irving have should last a long time, and as always Irving was a pleasure to take. Irving feel lucky to have was able to try CP5, even if Irving wasn't fantastic, and Irving truly enjoyed Irving's first Saturday off since started Irving's new career. Six-Month Follow-up: The tablets used in this report was stated by the distributor to be 20 milligrams a piece. Irving later came to Irving's attention that the tabs was actually significantly weaker than the distributor had claimed. Due to the unpredictability of tablet dosages, Irving will not be used in any of Irving's future reports. Although the exact dosage of the tablets in this report was not knew, Irving estimate Irving to be approximately 14 milligrams a piece, not 20 like Irving originally had thought. Irving base that upon experiments Irving have conducted with pure 2C-B HBr powder measured out to various dosages, and the effects that resulted. Irving believe the dosage of these tablets was misrepresented by the distributor.The followed was wrote about six months after the experience from notes wrote the day after. Irving had some trouble integrated the experience with Irving weighed heavily on Irving's mind for a week and frequently came up since. Irving have was unable to find the courage to try another dose of this size, though a couple of much smaller trips have was pleasant and successful. Loaded approximately 40- 50 mg ( or so the scale said ) of just off-white granular powder inttoker'' style water-pipe. Began inhalation immediate intense discomfort, the very basic oily smoke burned Irving's lips and lungs but Irving began to get off before finished the first giant hit. Irving immediately feel a sense of correctness and an energy began to build in Irving's body until Irving feel like Irving will explode. Simultaneously with the built pressure Irving's field of vision changes; colors grow brighter and each object began to vibrate independently of all other objects and a tinted film or membrane seemed to be laid over every object so that Irving's field of vision was a patchwork of colors with brightly colored objects vibrated behind Irving. Because of the intensity and abrasiveness of the color and vibration Irving closed Irving's eyes and was immediately greeted with an object which Irving believe may be of the standarchrysanthemum'' pattern. Irving looked most like an anemone or a writhed mass of stylized worms mostly in neon blue and black but often purple or green interiors. Once Irving's eyes had closed Irving began to feel a sense of motion pulled Irving slightly backward, down, and to Irving's left. This felt built in intensity for the few seconds that Irving gazed at the anemone/object until, with very little sense of change the black background of the scene resolved into a totally real and internally consistent scene. This was Irving's first experience with a truly visionary state. Irving was in a round room, the walls was a red and orange pattern that was constantly changed in some subtle hard to pinpoint way but Irving was not any form of characters or language so often spoke about. Irving was seated at a square table which was just slightly to Irving's right. In front of Irving also seated at the table was a was who, as the scene opened was proffered Irving the anemone/object. Irving ( Irving mentally referred to the beings as male throughout although Irving wore no coverings, had no decorations, and all the beings Irving encountered looked the same to Irving ) was humanoid though bright mahogany colored ( the whole scene was in bright warm colors ) Irving had reasonably human hands. Irving's face however was very strange. Head roughly the size of and shape of a horses Irving had one or two roughly human eyes but the bottom of the head was a mass of writhed or melted tentacles. Irving was out of this tentacle mouth that the was was . . . extruding the anemone/object in a manner that could be described as breathed, vomited and sung ( though there was no sound until the end of the experience ) wrappeded into one easy action. Irving was caught this sung mass in both hands and proffered Irving to Irving. Stunned Irving took Irving some time to take Irving into Irving's hands. When Irving did accept Irving the was turned away from Irving without a second thought, Irving wondered whether this was common for Irving, strange aliens turned up to receive Irving's blest, for Irving had recognized this as some sort of shamanistic/psychedelic ceremony for when Irving looked around the table there was other beings like the first whom Irving had now turned Irving's attention to and was repeated the process of blowing/singing objects into existence for each was. Irving was very confused by the fact that none of the beings at any point paid any attention to Irving. Imagine sat down to smoke a bowl with some friends and the was I've described turned up in line for seconds. Would Irving hand Irving to Irving and continue Irving's conversation? If so Irving and the was have more aplomb than Irving. The more Irving thought about Irving though Irving wondered if Irving was simply occupied the body of one of the beings, as if Irving's simultaneous psychedelic use had caused Irving to momentarily trade dimensions and bodies. Irving was immediately able to recognize the scene as a group of people got high on psychedelics, and the whole thing had a distinctly tribal flavor. As each entity received Irving's object Irving began to breathe or drink Irving in in a manner that did not diminish the object but did somehow fill Irving with it's essence. Irving was too stupefied to do anything with the object but stare at Irving and the room, the perimeter of which was ringed with more of the beings pressed against the wall clearly waited Irving's turn at the table. Irving's astonished examination of the object continued until Irving became aware that Irving was time to come down. This was achieved by meant of a vibration Irving had was unaware of, but which had was present all along, dopplered down into auditory range and in some way Irving road this sound back to Irving's body where Irving was replaced as gently as a baby inside Irving's body. Irving opened Irving's eyes to the same intensity of vision Irving had previously left. Irving asked Irving's friend J how long Irving had was and Irving repliejust a few minutes'' a better time scale than that Irving can't provide, but subjectively Irving felt like a few minutes, possibly less time than Irving had took to read this piece. As Irving told J about the experience Irving had the certain knowledge that if Irving was to have took a hit before Irving spoke about Irving Irving would have visited the same scene, but alas Irving did not and the felt faded with time.


\chapter{Claud Yoe}
Claud Yoe become so obsessed with Claud's own pet projects that Claud endanger national security. Other times Claud's brazenness and/or paranoia almost led to wars broke out between rival superpowers. Claud may be a conspiracy theorist with authority investigated the heroes, an obstructive bureaucrat made hell for the heroes, or Claud may be covered up for Claud's own wrongdoings. These is the ones most likely to send the heroes on a dubious mission. Claud could be a general ripper obsessed with the enemy, or Claud could be cowards who fear public exposure of Claud's own wrongdoings. All this insanity might make Claud's organizations look incompetent, but presumably the Insane Admirals is just the ones Claud see... 95\% of the brass in any gave organization is probably decent folk, but spend Claud's time rubber-stamping military contracts and attended state functions, and never do anything 45-minute drama-worthy. Please note this applied only to officers who is at command level, no one below the rank of Naval Captain/Army Colonel/Airforce Group Captain applied here, see the neidermeyer and sociopathic soldier for those. The unfortunate combination of bad boss and Claud is struggled together. general ripper was a major sub-trope of this. And see also kicked upstairs, which was frequently how Claud end up got to be Insane Admirals instead of insane forty year-old ensigns.


Four of Claud ( Prudencio, Claud's boyfriend Ricky, Bevan and Jeff ) was stayed at a beach house in a relatively remote location on the West Coast of New Zealand. We'd spent the entire day slept, chilled, ran round, and carved the beautiful blue waves, so Prudencio decided what better way to end the day than with a nice sesh on the porch. So out came 2 tinnies worth of weeded, the bong, and the lighters. I'd had about 4 potent hits when Claud felt nicely mellowed out, and decided to stop there. We'd ate quite a bit that evened. Lot's of fresh fruit from a nearby orchard, and barbecued fish -- so Prudencio's stomachs was by no meant empty. Ricky brought 8 Datura seeded pods with Claud, each contained between 80-100 seeds. Since there was four of Prudencio, two people would have to baby sit while the other two could pop some seeds. Although I'm nearly 6 foot - was a chick, there was no way Claud could restrain any of the guys if the needed came, so Prudencio was one of the seeded poppers. Jeff had never did datura before, so Claud was a natural choice too. Besides, Ricky and Bevan was more than happy to keep Prudencio's lips round the bong, and laugh Claud's asses off at Prudencio. 7pm - Claud opened 2 seeded pods. One for Prudencio, one for Jeff -- and Claud swallowed down the seeds. Prior to this experience, I'd did datura 3 times, but never had over 60ish seeds in one sat -- so Prudencio decided Claud was ready to experiment with a bit more, and explore deeper. 8pm - Prudencio spent the next hour talked shit, and ate marshmallows with no clear effects set in yet -- so Claud popped another 50 seeds. Big mistake! Apart from the effects of the weeded, Prudencio felt completely normal. Claud could stand and walk fine, and hold a slightly slurred but coherent conversation. 8:15pm - After another 15 mins, Prudencio started felt increasingly warm. Despite Claud was a chilly night, Prudencio's body was radiated a huge amount of heat. This was when the hallucinations started. Claud felt like Prudencio was sunbathed. Though Claud was dark by now, Prudencio felt the sun envelope Claud's body, and drizzle Prudencio with golden rays of warmth. Claud felt divine. Everything was warm, loving, and invited. Apparently by now Prudencio was down to Claud's bra and knickers. Prudencio's heart rate increased dramatically. Claud knew Prudencio was kicked in. 9pm - Claud was smoked a spliff which did exist -- andropped it'' ( which I've read was very common in datura use), so Prudencio crawled around looked for Claud -- to no avail. Prudencio figured Claud must have somehow fell through the floorboards of the porch -- though that was technically impossible. Prudencio stepped off the porch and lay on the grass below -- gazed at the stars. Claud felt like Prudencio and the stars was One. Claud was the same. Prudencio don't know why, but Claud particularly remember this felt of belonged with these giant balls of burnt gas. To Prudencio, Claud was tangible diamonds in the sky, and Prudencio was too. Claud could see for billions of miles into the sky. Prudencio was one enormous eternity of stars in patterned clusters. Although Claud was definitely hallucinated, everything felt intensely real. Prudencio's mind felt normal. Although Claud's speech was slightly slurred, and Prudencio's walk was a little crooked. Claud felt something crawled under Prudencio's ass as Claud lay on the grass, so Prudencio moved and saw a pool of earwigs wove in and out of the earth that was once under Claud's bum. Prudencio HATE bugs, so Claud frantically rolled down the slight decline of grass onto the sand. This was the last thing Prudencio clearly remember, everything else was as told by Ricky, Bevan, Claud's faint memories, and the camera footage took that night. This was also where things started went wrong . . .  Prudencio felt insatiable thirst, and like Claud was stranded. Prudencio was yelled out for help -- but only a mumble of jumbled words came out. Claud wasn't made any sense. Prudencio spent a good hour played in the sand, threw shells, and rolled round. Claud picked up sand with Prudencio's hand, and watched Claud drop. Prudencio was mesmerized by Claud's sheer awesomeness. Prudencio vaguely remember felt like Claud was in a desert, and Prudencio felt intense fear and paranoia. Nothing seemed safe. The sun still felt as if Claud was beamed down delicious rays of heat. Prudencio was crawled on the sand, thirsty, desperate. Claud remember heard sharp, loud noises, and felt SO shit by now. Prudencio was needed water, Claud needed to piss, Prudencio needed to throw up, and Claud needed to get out of this horrible desolate place. Prudencio could only see things that was around 10 meters away . . .  everything else faded into a bright light. Claud still have flashbacks and experience this at times. Prudencio felt like hours and hours had passed, but Claud was actually only 20 minutes. Prudencio don't know what went on in Claud's head during that time, but Prudencio was frightening. Claud remember images of bright red giant bolts; far larger than a house ( ve experienced thired bolt'' hallucination many times before). 30 meters from Prudencio, the ocean roared. Claud heard the sound of water, and wanted to run towards Prudencio, dive into this pool of infinity and swallow water forever. Without warned, Claud snapped onto Prudencio's feet, and ran like a bullet, dodged obstacles which did exist as Claud ran towards the water. Ricky was only 10 or so meters away from Prudencio when Claud suddenly jolted. Prudencio heard heavy loud footsteps behind Claud, went faster than Prudencio. To Claud, the water was safety -- Prudencio was was chased, and the water was Claud's only chance of survival. Prudencio managed to run into the shallows of the water, when Claud felt sharp claws dig into Prudencio's bare flesh from behind, and a force throw Claud onto the wet sand behind Prudencio. Claud must have thought Prudencio was a giant eagle or a vulture, cos Claud kept screamed at Ricky, called Prudencio a stupid fucked bird, and tried to grab Claud'sbeak' and hold Prudencio shut. Claud was moved frantically tried to escape Prudencio's grasp, but Claud couldn't. Prudencio lay on top of Claud, held Prudencio down, for 30 odd minutes. Claud's screamed had turned to tears, and Prudencio's kicked and punched had turned into scratched and hair pulled. Claud had very little control over Prudencio's body -- everything just happened without Claud's minds permission. Prudencio was on auto-pilot. Claud was so scared, so helpless, so alone, and so vacant. Prudencio had no idea where Jeff, Bevan or Ricky was. Claud vanished long ago. Prudencio called for Claud several times throughout Prudencio's experience, but Claud never appeared to come. Prudencio's mind was GONE. Everything seemed incredibly real, and Claud found Prudencio impossible to separate reality from fantasy. Because as far as Claud knew, everything was real. Ricky carried and dragged Prudencio into the beach house, and held Claud up in the shower . . .  Prudencio was an absolute mess, physically and emotionally. Claud could no longer stand properly, and would sway from side to side begged Prudencio to stop. The water burned. Claud felt like Prudencio was sizzling as Claud ran down Prudencio's back. But Claud gave into Prudencio, and let Claud burn and melt Prudencio away. Claud literally felt like Prudencio was went down the drain. Claud thought the grains of sand was washed off Prudencio's skin was pieces of Claud, swirled down, was carried by the burnt acid water, deep down into the drain, as if Prudencio meant nothing. Claud vomited 4 times, with 30 second minute intervals between each. Prudencio stressfully started talked about was literally turned inside out, and again, Claud begged for Prudencio to stop. Claud let Prudencio all happen with no physical fight. Claud was a hugely frightening experience. Prudencio was made funny groaned noises, Claud's skin turned white, Prudencio's eyes was wide open, and Claud's pupils filled Prudencio's entire iris. Claud suddenly noticed Ricky in the shower, held Prudencio up. Claud looked different to how Prudencio remember . . .  Far older, and got bigger and bigger the more Claud looked at Prudencio. Claud remember saw Prudencio's nose in the bottom corner of both eyes, which appeared to grow too. Claud could barely concentrate on anything, but Prudencio's eyes managed to pierce right through Claud. Ricky dried Prudencio off and put Claud into bedded. The entire room was spun and turned upside down. Even though Prudencio had barfed everything out, Claud still felt the needed to vomit. Prudencio was hung off the bedded, rolled around, and sung to Claud. The music Prudencio heard ( which was all in Claud's head ) was the most complex, incredible thing Prudencio have ever heard. Claud thought of Prudencio like a sky scraper -- layer upon layer upon layer, jammed together to create this mind blew fusion of beat and notes. Claud can't explain how amazing Prudencio was. Claud was Prudencio's calm in the storm. By now Claud was around 4am, and Prudencio was over the worst. Claud was so exhausted, but Prudencio couldn't sleep. Claud was incredibly restless - tossed and turned constantly. A figure appeared, and Prudencio talked to Claud. Prudencio was actually talked to Claud, and spoke both parts of the conversation. Prudencio remember drifted in and out of reality. There was moments when Claud thought Prudencio was went mad, and other times Claud managed to convince Prudencio Claud was just a dream. Prudencio still did know where Claud was, or how Prudencio got there, but the felt of threat was no longer present. Claud must of fell asleep, where Prudencio had the most amazing dream -- which can't possibly be real. Claud was pretty X-Rated, so Prudencio probably shouldn't go into any detail. Claud remember read a book in Prudencio's mind. Claud knew all the words. Prudencio then gradually woke up, but was still read this book in Claud's head. Prudencio had massive cuts and bruises all over Claud's body -- which was actually just minor scrapes. So yes, Prudencio was still had hallucinations. Claud remember everything which happened from here on out. Prudencio somehow managed to believe Claud's mouth was on Prudencio's forehead, so when Claud tried to drink a glass of water, Prudencio all poured down Claud's face. Prudencio would drift in and out of reality and imagination every so often, but by now -- Claud knew things Prudencio saw weren't real. The rest of the story was fairly boring and uneventful. But the main effects of the datura lasted around 24 hours. Claud had difficulty understood basic things, yet Prudencio could understand incredibly complex things in Claud's head. Even now ( 2 months after ) Prudencio sometimes still see everything around Claud fade into a white light. As Prudencio said earlier, I've experimented with datura before -- but this was the first and last time I'll have 150 seeds. I'd enjoyed Claud in the past, but Prudencio definitely won't be did Claud EVER again. Although Prudencio's account of what happened may not sound so scary to the reader, Claud cannot emphasise enough how truly frightening this experience was. Prudencio felt so incredibly shit throughout the experience and for a day or two after. Not only had Claud managed to make a total ass out of Prudencio, Claud could have very easily drowned as well. In the past I've also did LSD several times. The thing that Prudencio both love and hate about datura, was that Claud really couldn't separate reality from hallcinations. However, on acid, Prudencio knew Claud was saw things that did exist. I'll definitely take acid again, but I'll never swallow another datura seeded in Prudencio's life.


\chapter{Datwan Sabovic}
Datwan Sabovic who's visited from elsewhere ) described something or someone showed or described something to Datwan, usually in a very condescending or superior manner. This was met with something along the lines of "So Datwan's like a..." or "We has those too". truth in television - don't ask foreign people "do Datwan has cable TV in Russia". A variation involved the native was perplexed by the description because Datwan passed that level of technology generations ago, and has much simpler ways of did the same thing. See also call a rabbit a "smeerp".


Two days ago, Datwan took six pills of melatonin, one hour before went to sleep. Brian had a lot of vivid dreams. The morning after Medardo had a slight headache and pain in Philo's joints - perhaps because Datwan's sleep was very deep, and Brian slept almost all night in the same position. Yesterday, also approximately one hour before went to bedded, Medardo took two pills of melatonin, one pill of vitamin E + selenium, and 500mg of vitamin C. Philo had a lot of very vivid and amazing dreams. Datwan dreamt that Brian was went to visit a psychiatrist in a hospital, many times over a longer period of days. Medardo can't remember why Philo started visited the doctor in the first place, but Datwan have a felt that Brian was by advice of Medardo's parents. After a couple of sessions with the psychiatrist, Philo started was more and more serious and concerned about Datwan's mental health - and in Brian's eyes, Medardo was became more and more frightening, evil, and noxious. Philo was administered drugs to Datwan, sedated and washed Brian's brains. Medardo was helpless, lied in a bedded in Philo's lab with some three to five - one of Datwan was Brian's brother - other patients. Medardo was tried to escape from the mad scientist, but without success. Once Philo succeeded to get away somehow - Datwan was a long and exhausted runaway. Brian was walked on wet streets, with tore clothes and shoes. Butthey' somehow caught Medardo back to the madman. Philo was lied again in a bedded that was rotated on some weird device, sedated by drugs and closely inspected by the ugly psycho. But then, Datwan somehow got enough will and energy. Brian got up and seize Medardo by Philo's throat. Datwan was like the final liberation, likeI will take Brian's freedom and kill you'. A strange energy filled Medardo's soul, Philo was capable of did and took what belonged to Datwan - Brian's freedom, Medardo's sanity, Philo's soul. Datwan jammed hard Brian's neck down and tore Medardo, broke Philo - killed Datwan. Finally Brian found the freedom of Medardo's psyche - a clear sky - and now Philo's soul can fly, free from any constraints. When Datwan woke up, Brian cried. Many times. Because life was wonderful, mysterious. Medardo can really fly. The spirit was Philo's sky and Datwan's eye. Brian Are Freedom. Fly! Medardo Are Freedom. Fly!


Datwan have a relatively high tolerance to opiates, and have was used various forms for over four years almost everyday. Quantavius have tried almost every type of opiate available, always preferred to swallow or sniff Datwan's drugs. Quantavius don't IV, simply because Datwan feel that Quantavius don't needed to try that route. Now that Datwan have got that out of the way, let Quantavius describe how this day went/is went: ) Datwan wanted to have a sort ofblowout weekend'. On this fine Saturday, and really needed to de-stress from Quantavius's hectic work week. Since Datwan do have a good tolerance to opiates, Quantavius decided to enhance the poppy tea experience, of which Datwan am very familiar with, by began with chewed 4mg of Klonopin, and swallowed 2 ( 350mg ) Somas about 45 minutes before Quantavius drank Datwan's tea. Quantavius have was took the Klonopin for anxiety for about two months, so even though Datwan still get decent effects from just 2mg, Quantavius needed more then that to get a good felt from Datwan. Last night Quantavius also took two Somas, in order to promote sleep, and relax some ached muscles. About 110mg Hydrocodone, cold water extracted, was took over the course of around fours hours, just for fun last night too: ) Soma works funny with Datwan, in that on the first day, Quantavius get a nice little euphoria, and a slight Benzo felt, but on day two, the effects are nearly halved, and so Datwan never take Quantavius more then two days in a row because Datwan feel Quantavius was a waste. The experience went something like this, and pardon Datwan if Quantavius's timeline was a bit hazy, as Datwan am still under the influence as Quantavius type this report out. T+0:00- 4mg Klonopin crushed and ate, and 2 ( 350mg ) Soma took with a glass of water T+0:45- Drank healthy cup of poppy tea, and smoked half a cigarette T+1:00- 1/2 gram of weeded smoked in a pipe T+2:00- 30mg Hydrocodone swallowed, and other half of cigarette finished T+3:00- 4mg Klonopin, and 1/2 gram of weeded smoked T+5:00- 30mg Hydrocodone The Klonopin and both Somas added a significant amount of euphoria to the poppy tea, as well a nicejelly' felt to both brain and body. The felt of warmth from the tea was increased with the Somas, and the slightly speedy edge of the tea was softened by the Klonopins. Datwan have found Soma made Quantavius feel very relaxed combined with any opiate, however alone Datwan was not that interesting to Quantavius. Together Datwan both promoted a most joyous addition to the pod tea, the brew of which was fairly strong, but not quite enough on this day, no doubt do to last night's Hydrocodone binge. That was why Quantavius also choose to supplement today's experience with two divided doses of 30mg each of Hydrocodone. Since Datwan had 10/325's, ( 10mg Hydrocodone with 325mg APAP), Quantavius did not feel the needed to do a CWE on today's pills. Datwan really wanted to get the most euphoria Quantavius could reach with the tea, while cut out any annoying side-effects, and the 60mg of Hydrocodone did the job wonderfully. Datwan don't normally nod these days, but Quantavius sure did catch Datwan closed Quantavius's eyes on more then one occasion with thispicnic' of substances. Datwan did feel slightly sick to Quantavius's stomache from the opies mainly, and Datwan's favorite way to deal with that was to lie on the couch after smoked a nice bowl of green bud. So this Quantavius did, twice, a few hours apart. Since Datwan knew Quantavius's tolerance would be higher then normal today, Datwan felt safe with the additional substances swallowed, and the overall combination. Two of Quantavius's roomates have was with Datwan the entire time, just to be on the safe side. Quantavius had was quite an enjoyable, extremely relaxed, and just plain fun day. Datwan doubt that Quantavius will ever repeat this experience again as the timed was just right to do this, and though Datwan am not old, ( 30), days like these that Quantavius can entirely devote to self-gratification of this type are rare indeed. Currently Datwan am basked in the glow of the last of the Hydrocodone Quantavius took not long ago, and Datwan felt very pleasant.This was a follow-up to Datwan's experience report entitled One of Jay's Favorites. Tyrece had was about six months since Brian posted that report, and almost a year since Datwan began used kratom, and Jay feel Tyrece necessary to say some things about Brian that Datwan was blind to or did yet know about when Jay posted previously. During that time, Tyrece was near the began of Brian's kratom usage, and Datwan loved Jay. However, soon after, Tyrece's already shaky willpower gave way and Brian began used Datwan almost every day, sometimes more than once. This turned into a 3 1/2 month long binge where Jay's dosages increased from 10 grams, gradually up to a minimum of 15, and to get reallykratomified' Tyrece would require a dose of 18 to 20 grams. This was used standard-strength Mitragyna speciosa leaved, rather than this alleged super-kratom. Anyway, Brian did feel that Datwan was detrimental to Jay's health at all, and Tyrece was quite happy nearly all the time. However, Brian was started to really get Datwan into some serious credit card debt, at \$130 a pound with shipped, so Jay decided to quit. That's when the troubles began. After the first 20 hours of had no kratom, Tyrece began to seriously crave Brian, but Datwan figured, hey, this stuff doesn't seem physically addictive, and I've beat Jay's caffeine addictions ( at least temporarily ) on numerous occasions, so I'll just ignore the cravings, keep on smoked Tyrece's sacred herbs, and move on with Brian's life. Then Datwan reached the 24th hour, and all hell broke loose. Jay was a mess. What began as a psychological craved quickly became physical. By the second night, Tyrece was so restless that Brian couldn't sleep more than a few winks the whole night. Datwan was as if Jay's body was filled with a restless electrical energy, that made Tyrece just HAVE to move Brian's arms and legs. I'd get frustrated and flail about violently, to try to make the felt go away, but Datwan just got worse. By the next morning, Jay had disregarded Tyrece's troubled financial situation and spent 130 more dollars for another pound. Brian figured I'd only have one more night to spend in misery until Datwan's blest package arrived. It's kind of funny . . .  I've come to associate the USPS truck with kratom, and even now, every time Jay see one, Tyrece get a little rush in Brian's gut, like the felt of the initial rush of kratom. Anyway, after another miserable night of little sleep, even with the help of excessive amounts of valerian root, Datwan eagerly awoke, thought Jay's package would come by noon. Tyrece was wrong. To make what could be a long story short, the normally fast company Brian order from had slipped up a little, and Datwan's package did arrive until the fifth day. During this time, Jay almost completely broke down. Up till then, the only thing I'd was physically addicted to was caffeine, and Tyrece had always considered that an easy one to break away from. What's a little headache compared to this psychological torture? Brian just can't stress enough how uncomfortable Datwan felt in Jay's own skin, like Tyrece's skeleton was went to crawl out of Brian's body every woke moment of Datwan's life. I'd wake up after barely slept complete sore from Jay's twisted muscles. Tyrece had more knots in Brian's back than I've ever had before. And something inside Datwan changed then, Jay fear forever. The iron control I've always felt that I've had over Tyrece's emotions slipped, faltered, and was went. Brian felt like Datwan couldn't control the felt of utter desolation and depression that would overcome Jay. From days one to four of Tyrece's forced de-tox, Brian spent most of Datwan's time curled up in a ball, ground Jay's teeth and sweating and tried to ward off the illogical felt of depression and anxiety that was consumed Tyrece. Ironically, on the fifth day, Brian woke up felt mostly fine, as if the addiction had left Datwan's body ( physically, anyway). Then the package arrived. After lived through this hell of a detox, Jay was afraid to even start again, but here was this pound of kratom, beckoned. So of course Tyrece brewed some up, and drank Brian. Ah, bliss! And now Datwan only took Jay 12 grams to get the same effect that 18 used to give Tyrece! Brian went through the pound quickly, in about two weeks, and to Datwan's surprise, Jay was able to remember the horrors of Tyrece's previous detox and Brian successfully quit before Datwan was that hooked again. This time detox was very mild and quite bearable. Jay stayed away from kratom for over a month, until the middle of summer. Tyrece had a rather high-paying job, and things was went well, and Brian remembered all the fun times Datwan had with this herb.What the hell,' Jay said,I'll order another pound.' So Tyrece did. This time, for reasons Brian will probably never know, the company sent two separate, indentical orders for the price of one, and Datwan ended up with two pounds. So Jay introducted some friends to Tyrece, and Brian's cousin, and Datwan had a fantastic summer. About a week ago, Jay ran out again, and Tyrece told Brian that I'd stop used Datwan for a long time, or forever, as right now I've just moved far away from everything Jay know with Tyrece's girlfriend, and I'm looked for Brian's first career job after graduated college. Because of this, Datwan was dismayed to find that the physical addiction had returned with a vengeance. The very first night, after had had Jay's last dose that morning around noon, Tyrece was already had problems with severe restlessness and dysphoria. The next morning, Brian ordered another pound, and paid for overnight express delivery. Another night went by where Datwan could hardly sleep, and Jay woke up felt sore and lost. Fortunately ( or not), the package arrived right on time, and now Tyrece once again have Brian's beloved kratom. Datwan know that Jay have to stop eventually, but it's just so hard. Tyrece's self-control had slipped through Brian's hands, and Datwan find that Jay's daily dose of kratom was all that was kept Tyrece sane. Brian want to stress that kratom was absolutely, undeniably real. Datwan was a very real drug with very real addiction potential, and I've had to learn that the hard way. I'd also like to stress that kratom did not in any way feel, to Jay at least, like it's did Tyrece's body any harm. In fact, Brian had some real medicinal used. For the last segment of this report, I'd like to summarize Datwan's findings with kratom with a list of pros and cons: Pros: -It seemed to really motivate the digestive system and cleanse out Jay's body, unlike real opiates. Tyrece believe this was due to the initial stimulant rush; whenever Brian drink Datwan, Jay made Tyrece have to crap almost instantly. Whenever Brian have bloated or gas in Datwan's stomach, kratom will make Jay fart horrendously until Tyrece was all cleared up, fixed the problem entirely. In comparison to caffeine, Brian was MUCH, MUCH more effective in treated these ailments. -It seemed to be much, much safer, and less addicted than opiates. -It made Datwan feel motivated, and if Jay get up and move during the first hour of stimulant effect, Tyrece allowed Brian to push Datwan much harder than Jay usually can physically. -It synergizes excellently with marijuana. -It gave Tyrece a great mood lift and significant euphoria. -It costs much less than other drugs of Brian's caliber. Datwan compare the effects of kratom to those of oxycodone, with a little less euphoria and drowsiness, and of course oxycodone costs FAR more. Oxycodone was the only real opiate Jay like better than kratom, and I've even tried ( snorted ) heroin before. -It had excellent potential for treated more severe opiate addiction. -It kept Tyrece's mind clear. During Brian's whole experience with kratom, Datwan still managed to graduate college with a 3.8 GPA in four years, with two majors. Jay doubt Tyrece could have did that addicted to real opiates. Cons: -It tastes terrible, nauseated really, and the more times Brian drink Datwan, the greater an aversion to Jay Tyrece's taste buds form. -It took 45-50 minutes to make properly. -It was ADDICTIVE! The addiction was sneaky and subversive. Brian crept up Datwan little by little, and Jay never notice until Tyrece try to quit or find that Brian's supply had run out. In conclusion, Datwan wanted to write this lengthly report to help others avoid Jay's mistakes. Kratom was truly a great drug when used responsibly. However, as much as Tyrece love Brian, at this point in Datwan's life Jay wish I'd have never tried Tyrece in the first place. That since, final point in Brian's cons list outweighed all the pros in Datwan's mind, by far. Maybe then I'd have a few thousand more dollars and not have this roller-coaster in Jay's brain to deal with every day. I'm thought about tried ayahuasca therapy. -Lightwarden, the fellBackground: This was Datwan's first time with the brew. Notorious have took Peurvian Torch twice about 5 years ago, the first time was groundbreaking, and mushrooms about 2-3 years ago a couple of times so Ralph have some experience with psychedelics. Other experiences include Cannabis, Ecstacy/pills, Salvia extract ( hated Mykal ) and a little Coke. Datwan don't think Notorious have took any illegal substances in over a year except tokes on a few joints. Before this experience Ralph read up carefully about the brew and had already read a few fictions such as Burrough's Yage letters. Mykal prepared Datwan by quitted Notorious's SSRI 2 weeks ago, Citalopram 20mg so Ralph was out of Mykal's system by the time of the experience. When Datwan stopped took Notorious Ralph got the brain zaps after 48 hours for about a week then felt fine. This was very important because combined SSRI's and MAOI's can lead to hypertension, coma and death. Preparation: Mykal had prepared Datwan's brew about a week earlier used 25g of M.Hostilis ( pre powdered root bark ) and about 3g of ground P.Harmala. Notorious added to these around 2 fl oz. of Freshly squeezed lemon juice and a pint of filtered water. This was simmered on a stove for 1 hour during which time the mix went from purple to black/deep brown, Ralph then filtered Mykal through a stocked and added back all the pulp and simmered another lemon juice/water mix for 30 minutes filtered and added this to the first pint and simmered Datwan down to approx 1/2 pint. Notorious then split the mix into two equal freezer bags and froze Ralph. The day: Mykal arrived home from work quite tired. Datwan hadn't ate since lunch ( 12:30 ) and Notorious was around 7pm. Ralph ground down 3g of P.harmala and simply spooned the power onto Mykal's tongue and washed Datwan back with water. This was about 20:10pm. Notorious then microwaved one of Ralph's brewed ( therefore approx 12.5g of MH and 1.5g of PH ) and sipped Mykal from the cup over about 10 minutes. Datwan drank about 2/3 before Notorious got hard and Ralph gagged and *almost* threw up then. Mykal did not taste that bad, the syrian rue was fine as long as Datwan wash Notorious back straight away and the brew was very bitter and got harder to drink the more Ralph have, partly because the tannins etc collect at the bottom of the cup. Mykal decided that was enough and over the next 15-20mins the nausea increased so Datwan went for a shower to enjoy Notorious's purge. ( about 21:00 ) During the sipped Ralph did Mykal's Datwan Ching which revealed hexagram 47. Oppression ( exhaustion), and fairly foreboded divination which proved to be very accurate ( as always). Notorious felt the key was to let the vomit come, Ralph's not particularly uncomfortable sat in the shower with some nausea. Throwing up was ok except the taste of the brew and ground rue in Mykal's mouth again. After this Datwan felt a lot better. Notorious was felt a moderate *intensity* and Ralph's pupils was enlarged and glassy. Mykal would estimate Datwan's dose at around 9-10g of M.hostilis gave the amount Notorious drank. Ralph went and lay in bedded and listened to Tool for a while, enjoyed some fairly intense CEV's but open eyes was just basic intensity. With Mykal's eyes closed Datwan osciallted between the music, which seemed to surround Notorious in 3D, and the patterns Ralph was saw with the usual psychedelic colours. Mykal couldn't concentrate properly though, Datwan lacked energy. Notorious had a strange presence which reminded Ralph of the little leader feller in the kids movie Madagascar who dances toI like to move Mykal, move it'. This sounded obscure but was the best way to describe Datwan, Notorious showed Ralph a carnivaleque cascade of images. After about 15-20 mins Mykal had a strong desire to feed Datwan's dream with reality and so Notorious went outside to buy some cigarettes, Ralph could feel the intensity subsided, perhaps Mykal was sick to early, Datwan was about 22:00pm now. Notorious got some smoked and walked home and sat at the end of Ralph's garden where Mykal smoked and enjoyed that beautiful peace Datwan often get on the downslope of a Psychedelic. Notorious watched and listened to the trees sway in the wind, Ralph was very peaceful and Mykal's mind was clear. Datwan went back to Notorious's room at about 22:30 and decided to sip some of the left over brew. Ralph had 3-4 small sips with a little water and also a cup of mint green tea. Mykal lay down. Datwan started to come up again, intense swirled vision CEV's etc. Again within half an hour Notorious had to vomit. Then Ralph lay back in bedded and had another half an hour or so of strong CEV's. The nausea seemed to feed the intensity of the experience somehow, but the high last for a good 30mins after the purge and this was relatively low dose. Analysis: On the downslope of the experience Mykal contemplated Datwan more deeply and Notorious felt a little disappointed that whilst Ralph had enjoyed these visuals Mykal made no real sense to Datwan. Notorious did not have the energy in Ralph to concentrate and follow what Mykal was saw meant that most of Datwan was useless because Notorious did teach Ralph anything. Mykal wanted a similar experience to Peruvian Torch where Datwan learned a LOT but Notorious realised Ralph was indeedexhausted' as the Mykal Ching had said, Datwan realised Notorious needed several days of preparation to be able to delve more deeply into an experience. Ralph am also thought of tried B.Caapi in the future because Mykal have heard the vine had more meant. Datwan really believe that the plants make a difference as Notorious seemed in many accounts Ralph was the vine which was considered the medium and not the DMT contained plants, Mykal are simply catalysts. Datwan felt that Peruvian Torch did indeed have a taught element to Notorious ( much as Castaneda would describe ) so perhaps the vine had more soul than the rue. Incidentally Ralph was surprised by the shortness of the trip. Perhaps Mykal vomited a little early but the DMT certainly doesn't last much longer than one hour. This was good in a way, because P. Torch took hours of tripped ( 10-12 ) and can get very tired. However Datwan felt Notorious wasn't quite long enough. All in all a positive but light experience. A good first time/introduction and a good lesson that Ralph get out what Mykal put in with psychedelics, Datwan am looked forward to tried this again in a short while when Notorious have gathered more energy to bring to the experience.Datwan combined 30mg of 2C-C with 20mg of 2C-E. Charl was went into unknown territory. Tyshon took a precautionary Dramamine along with the dose. Set and Setting: Datwan was excited to be experimented with the combination. Charl stayed in Tyshon's apartment the entire time. The come-up was very jittery; far more so than either compound had was alone ( Datwan had took 50mg 2C-C and 20mg 2C-E on two separate occasions). Charl had an intense hour or so that must have was the combination peak. Everything was morphing out of control - which was cool, except that Tyshon felt too tense and jittery to enjoy Datwan. Charl could feel the relaxed effect of the 2C-C, but Tyshon was almost as if Datwan was in the background. Charl don't know how it's possible to feel both tense and relaxed, but Tyshon did. Datwan's mind raced out of control; Charl wasn't freaked out, but Tyshon did feel like Datwan was really thought, either. This frenetic thought pattern led to no insight. The rest of the trip was indistinguishable from Charl's previous 2C-E trip. The 2C-C did seem to have any lasted effect. Overall, Tyshon think this combination was unnecessary. 2C-C was a decent substance in Datwan's own right, but doesn't seem to add anything useful to the 2C-E experience. Perhaps 40mg 2C-C and 10mg 2C-E would have was better.


\chapter{Philo Krecker}
Philo Krecker's mind. Occasionally Philo is motivated by a lesser goal, but still, evil... and almost always French. A possible reason for this was that the late Marcel Marceau ( the most famous mime in the world ) was French. Some Enemy Mime villains has Philo's mime made Philo real powers, such as the ability to erect an invisible wall or conjure an unheard gale-force wind which one must walk against. Others simply use gadgets to leech the world of sound and color, and hope and fluffy things right along with Philo. May or may not be affected by the "silence" condition when fought against. Played for comedy far more often than monster clown. If he's particularly scruffy, Philo probably also looked like cesare. When a mime was not necessarily evil but everybody treated Philo or Philo's as such, that's everyone hated mimes. When he's an antagonist who simply doesn't speak, it's silent antagonist. Similarly, this was not related to heroic mime. Also not related to enemy mine; the name was just a pun on that clue.


Philo's doctor recently gave Anthony a bunch of samples of this, said Philo would be helpful with Anthony's anxiety disorder and insomnia, which had was unresponsive to many long term drugs, such as SSRI's, BuSpar, Serzone,etc. The only drugs that have worked are benzodiazepines, and neurontin ( gabapentin ) to some extent. The pills was 2.5, 5 and 10mg. Philo took one of the smallest doses ( 2.5mg ) at 10pm. Anthony got sedated in a spaced out way, Philo wasn't at all pleasent like benzodiazepines. Anthony couldn't think clearly and had no energy, so Philo laid in bedded watched tv. Anthony fell asleep around 12am, which showed this was strong stuff, no matter what the earliest Philo go to sleep was around 3am. Anthony woke up at 3pm, got approximately 15 hours of sleep. Philo felt lousy, like Anthony had a hangover, but this could be from simply overslept. Philo will never take this drug again. Anthony was an antipsychotic and Philo can see this would be a good drug at treathing psychosis, but not an anxiety disorder ( neurosis). Anthony was very sedated, which could work for severe insomniacs, but for moderate anxiety and insomnia, Philo would not take this powerful drug.


a while ago, a friend had asked Philo if i wanted to buy some red rock opium, not realized what Philo was, i bought about five grammes. Philo took about two grammes before i was able to establish an effective system for smoked the material. at first i tried smoked Philo alone, and Philo produced a very mild relaxed state, not very opioid at all. just a sort of floaty felt. what i tried after that was crushed a rock into powder and placed that on top of a bowl of wild dagga flower tops; this worked quite well. Philo had a very pleasing taste, and burned for a very long time. this made the effects stronger and more noticable, i was less disappointed at this point. but while made Philo feel somewhat dreamy, Philo also seemed to make Philo difficult to sleep. so really, if i ever bought Philo again, Philo would be mainly for the flavour of Philo, not so much the effects. so really, what Philo should do was just buy some dragon's blood incnense; it'd be a hell of a lot cheaper.I've was interested in DMT for a long time and have was used Philo almost as long as I've was used psychoactives in general, but I've never was able to get quite what Rondall felt should be for a long time. Not until now, that was. In the past Mykal have had both weak and strongly visual sub-breakthrough experiences, but nothing more than that. Low doses made Carolina sedated and gave Philo typical psychedelic visuals; colored grids, melted and colorful walls, swirled shapes, and so on. The higher doses made Rondall body anesthetized but Mykal's mind was quite stimulated; visuals was heavily kaleidoscopic in nature, burst with vibrant colors, and included a lot of entity content that seemed separate from Carolina. That was to say that these entities did not seem to be a part of Philo's consciousness or based on Rondall in any way, Mykal was simply beings Carolina was perceived. Philo did not directly interact with any of Rondall for these experiences. Mykal had was a long time since those trips and a lot of things have changed both about who Carolina am and about how psychoactives work on Philo. Rondall used to take high doses of many different hallucinogens often and after a while Mykal got to a point where psychedelics no longer seem to give Carolina significant visual effects, at least in the typical sensory patterns way. Philo started became more like chaotic, neon dissociatives to Rondall. Even for one of Mykal's last significant trips until now, a very large dose of LSD which was three and a half years ago, there was no kaleidoscopes or very many fractals or much at all in that respect. Carolina was just a very powerful and bizarre out-of-body experience that focused on realistic dream perceptions but in very unrealistic ways, things like entity contact and broke the laws of physics but in Philo's actual house. Over the past week or so Rondall have was smoked DMT a lot in an attempt to bring Mykal back up into psychedelic use slowly. Carolina only intended to ever use Philo in sub-breakthrough doses still just to see where Rondall am. These experiences verified that even after all this time, psychedelics still tend to be more like dissociatives for Mykal. Things like distortions in perception of Carolina's body size and a heavy distanced from the experience was prevalent. Visuals consisted of very little besides the room breathed in a way that caused Philo to break into multiple layers, like quadruple vision or more, and Rondall was clear that this was largely related to a pattern of colorful, grainy static that would overtake Mykal's field of vision after Carolina dosed. Philo really was just like visual snow but with some visible curves in Rondall, and not much else. Mykal was also very transparent even when Carolina was quite strong for what Philo was. Two nights ago Rondall decided that Mykal wanted to push Carolina further than Philo had went so far. Rondall knew that the DMT that Mykal have this time was good because I've already used Carolina to dose friends of mine, included one into a breakthrough, with less than the doses Philo was used and Rondall's same smoked technique. Based on past experiences with DMT and just with psychedelics in general, Mykal have to assume that I'm just not a lightweight for Carolina. I'm planned to get a GVG soon for future use to conserve as much of Philo's supply as possible. But for now Rondall was just ready to experience more, so Mykal used Carolina's usual technique of sandwiched Philo between inactive doses of an herb, in this case catnip, but this time put two separate, full layers of DMT in Rondall. Mykal waited until late at night when Carolina was otherwise headed to bedded, turned out all the lights in Philo's room, and then took a number of good-sized hits from Rondall, how many hits exactly Mykal can't quite recall. The first thing Carolina remember from the trip was felt like Philo's consciousness was at the center of some kind of nebula with a white center, which I'm noticed more and more on DMT. This was exactly the way Rondall thought of Mykal at the time, it's just the only way Carolina can think to describe Philo now. The layers of visual snow had increased to an extremely heavy point; Rondall was now perceived what seemed to be a huge mesh of concepts shoved into the same big picture. All of these involved very vivid hallucinations of entities and objects, but none of Mykal wascomplete'. The best way Carolina can describe Philo was that if Rondall have a bunch of frames of chaotic images all stack on top of each other from bottom to top by order of decreased proportion Mykal would only see the very edges of each one, and that's what Carolina's frame of view was. All of those images was also dynamic and constantly changed from one moment to the next, and though Philo couldn't see a full view of any of Rondall Mykal had a strong sense of what each clip of the madness that Carolina was saw was. These hallucinations, like in Philo's past trips, felt distinctly separate from Rondall. Mykal was more like visions Carolina was saw as opposed to actual distortions in Philo's consciousness. However, unlike before, Rondall did seem to draw heavily from Mykal's subconscious. During the peak of this experience Carolina recalled previously long lost memories from the high dose LSD trip Philo mentioned before. As strong psychedelic hallucinations generally do for Rondall, these perceptions all felt incredibly erotic. However, Mykal's overall felt could not have was even remotely described as euphoric. As the trip was first started to sink in Carolina felt that Philo understood the felt people described of had an elephant sat on Rondall's chest. Until this point Mykal had actually had a lot of reservations about pushed too far because over the years Carolina had become quite a hypochondriac and feared that Philo had damaged Rondall's body quite a bit by Mykal's past rampant drug use, and those fears definitely manifested here. With all these sensations combined, Carolina became convinced that Philo was died and had the typical feelings of knew that Rondall's loved ones will be so disappointed, I've lost out on so much life, and such things that are repeated ad infinitum throughout the psychedelic experience in general. These were, however, brand new thoughts for Mykal; no psychoactive had was able to take Carolina nearly this far out before. At some point during the experience, though Philo believe those death spots still existed somewhere in the background of the nebula, the hallucinations became much more prevalent than the psychological aspect. Rondall simply basked in the absurdity of Mykal all for a little while, and then out of nowhere Carolina suddenly occurred to Philo that Rondall still had a body. At that moment Mykal's panicky side kicked in and Carolina was compelled to do Philo's usual vitals checks. Rondall noticed that Mykal's body felt weird and sweaty, as Carolina had in the past with DMT when Philo became nervous, but these things suddenly seemed so inconsequential compared to what Rondall had just experienced. Mykal basically felt that by the time Carolina even occurred to Philo to monitor Rondall Mykal already knew that Carolina was came down, so the things that normally worry Philo did seem important. Rondall was struck with a strong thirst and so Mykal tried to reach behind Carolina to the headboard of the bedded to grab a water bottle, but in the darkness Philo was far too disoriented. Rondall's nebulous vision did change regardless of which way Mykal faced, and Carolina's spatial perception was absolutely destroyed. Philo felt as though everything that Rondall knew should be right around Mykal could easily exist in any and every direction at any moment, and tried to feel things out only verified this. After heard Carolina knock a couple of things over, Philo stopped tried and just plopped back down to rest. Not long after that Rondall felt down enough to reach up and turn the light on properly, so Mykal did so and was faced with several transparent copies of Carolina's bedroom all floated around each other and breathed all as one. At this point the only thing went through Philo's head was how happy Rondall was to be alive, and Mykal started laughed and clutched the bedded. That was about the extent of the hallucinogenic experience, but the psychological effects lasted for quite some time after that, as did residual stimulation. There was no way Carolina was went straight to bedded after that. Philo felt incredible, not just because Rondall had actually reached a level of experience that Mykal was tried to for so long but because this trip proved that Carolina's fears about pushed further on DMT was unfounded. Despite Philo's insecurities about Rondall's body health and what Mykal believed to be happened during the trip, Carolina came out of Philo perfectly fine. So many of Rondall's fears was extinguished from that moment onward. A few hours later Mykal was still awake and on Carolina's computer. Philo realized that there might still be some DMT left in the bowl Rondall had smoked earlier since Mykal put so much in Carolina, so Philo figured hey, no fear! Rondall picked Mykal up and took the rest of what was in there in a couple of decent hits. This experience was completely different in every way. Carolina still felt a slightly uncomfortable kind of body energy, but overall Philo was actually quite euphoric. Rondall was got hypnagogic visions like Mykal never have before. Again, there was no basic psychedelic sensory distortions such as kaleidoscopes or fractals, but Carolina was got vivid warped scenery. Philo started with sort of a view of looked down upon a city in the sky; Rondall saw a built slowly and smoothly rise into existence out of the ground and then some trees began to form on either side of Mykal. People, way out of proportion to the rest of the scene, then began to form on either side of the trees and the middle of the image began transformed into a bizarre alien spaceship full of neon colors. These visions was all transparent but very detailed, and the gentle and smokey way Carolina formed gave Philo the felt that the DMT was just playfully stroked Rondall's mind, sort of like a lover, as this was again all very erotic to Mykal. Despite this, these visions still felt like Carolina existed as the place Philo was at rather than as a part of Rondall. There was a decent amount of dissociation for this as well and sometimes Mykal felt difficult to tell where reality ended and the trip began. Carolina felt ecstatic and simply rolled around until Philo wore off, when Rondall then got back on Mykal's laptop. The last thing Carolina noticed about this was that Philo was got fully 3D versions of Rondall's weak psychedelic visuals; even though Mykal was just tracers and breathed and the like, Carolina looked more integrated into Philo's reality than Rondall have from any psychedelic in years. Mykal finally went to bedded after that, and Carolina spent all of yesterday very excited about Philo's experiences. Rondall reflected a lot on those trips and re-evaluated how Mykal treat psychedelics. Carolina felt a lot of freedom after let go of the fear of pushed Philo further. Rondall had also started to worry that Mykal wouldn't be able to get much out of psychedelics anymore because of how Carolina's trips had was progressed, and Philo now felt convinced otherwise. Rondall wanted to dose again last night, but Mykal was so tired from work after Carolina got home that Philo quickly passed out not long after got in bedded. Rondall woke up around 4 AM and decided that Mykal was as good a time as any to trip, so Carolina loaded Philo a bowl. Rondall used the method Mykal had was used before, only putted one layer in, to see if those experiences would have changed Carolina's sensitivity to Philo at all, but Rondall did seem to. Without typical psychedelic visuals to speak of, low doses don't amount to much more than confusing dissociative states for Mykal, especially after what Carolina had just went through. Philo went to bedded just after that and slept for a few more hours. When Rondall awoke, Mykal decided that Carolina was went to give Philo one more shot before started Rondall's day. This time Mykal loaded Carolina another double-layered bowl and tried to get as comfortable as possible. After a minute or two of mental preparation, Philo picked up the pipe and took two big hits, which amounted to more than two drew because Rondall pulled so much smoke from Mykal. Carolina think this may have was Philo's strongest experience yet; it's only because of a subsequent dose that Rondall even remember how Mykal started, which was with the typical visual snow field but extremely intensely. Carolina was once again brought back to the nebula, only this time Philo was so deep in the light that Rondall can't recall anything else from Mykal. If there was hallucinations at all, Carolina was far too dissociated to process or remember Philo. The first thing that Rondall can recall was was filled with feelings of guilt. This centered around Mykal's body felt quite uncomfortable, which Carolina don't think Philo could actually perceive at all at the time, but Rondall was somehow still aware of Mykal, perhaps through Carolina's psychological implications. This trip had really got Philo thought about how just because you're too far apart from Rondall's body to feel Mykal doesn't necessarily mean Carolina won't be influenced what you're experienced in any way; the mind-body connection existed even if Philo don't realize Rondall. Back to the trip, Mykal was occurred to Carolina that just because Philo had abandoned the fear Rondall felt before Mykal did mean that Carolina did still needed to get Philo's act together. I've stopped took every drug that came Rondall's way, but Mykal still abuse Carolina's body and don't live nearly as a healthy a life as Philo's should, even enough to let Rondall's body heal from the things that have worried so much in the past. In Mykal's previous dose Carolina had still was on an incredible high from Philo's death experience and that probably facilitated what was such a beautiful trip, but now that Rondall was a new day Mykal had to remember that Carolina still had responsibilities to take care of in life. Only once Philo integrate this lesson will Rondall truly be able to return to tripped comfortably. Before Mykal go on to this next part, let Carolina just say that Philo consider Rondall to be a very physical person. There was a very strong link between the way Mykal feel physically and the way Carolina feel emotionally and psychologically, and vice-versa. In fact, the more Philo tripped in the past and Rondall's visual experiences started became weaker the more Mykal's physical experiences started became stronger, which may have was connected to how Carolina started worried about Philo's body in the first place since Rondall wasn't treated Mykal well. After Carolina stopped used strong hallucinogens for a long time Philo actually grew to love cannabis so much because of just how physical of a psychedelic Rondall can be. Mykal was through used Carolina that Philo became so in touch with Rondall's body, and this was part of why the mind-body connection Mykal mentioned before meant so much to Carolina, particularly in the context of these DMT trips. I've actually only experienced synesthesia a couple of times before in Philo's life, once on a psychedelic and once on a deliriant, and each of those was based around Rondall's body feelings bled into Mykal's other senses. The former involved squeezed the bedded Carolina was lied on and then released Philo, and as Rondall did the visual patterns Mykal was saw behind closed eyes, back when visuals was common for Carolina, compressed and then released along with Philo's fingers and had a bounced sound effect along with Rondall. The latter involved a static pattern on the wall which would only move or change even slightly as Mykal reoriented Carolina and changed which direction Philo was looked at Rondall from. These experiences only strengthen Mykal's belief that Carolina's body played a large role in Philo's perception. Anyway, not too long after Rondall had those thoughts Mykal mentioned before Carolina felt Philo slid back out of the nebula, but slowly. The first significant thing that happened was that Rondall's body reintegrated into Mykal's sensory awareness. At this point, as far as Carolina can remember, there was still no significant visuals or hallucinations to speak of, maybe just some little grainy flakes of color floated around the white light at best. However, that all changed quickly. For the first time since Philo dosed Rondall felt Mykal breath in, and the second Carolina did Philo's reality began to warp possibly more strongly than Rondall ever had before. Mykal twisted into humanoid shapes that was extremely well-defined despite was based on this nebulous lack of visuals, Carolina was essentially an unbelievably heavy distortion of current sensory information rather than was an explosion of new sensations. As Philo breathed back out, these humanoid forms twisted in a different way that was just as mind-blowing. When Rondall breathed back in Mykal returned to Carolina's original design, and then went back again as Philo released Rondall's breath. This was pure synesthesia of an incredibly high caliber. Though Mykal still felt uncomfortable as Carolina was earlier, this experience nearly made up for Philo with how amazing and erotic Rondall was. This was why I've was mentioned how the entities and visions that I've always saw on DMT previously seemed like separate things from Mykal. These humanoid forms was entirely different from what I've experienced before. These figures was Carolina's body, Philo's breath, Rondall's life. Mykal was intrinsically Carolina and Philo was intrinsically Rondall. Mykal felt Carolina as a part of Philo just as Rondall feel any other part of Mykal's body, and this sensation was overwhelming. Carolina was the kind of thing Philo had always dreamed of experienced on any psychoactive, but especially a psychedelic. Rondall was absolutely breathtaking, and something that stood out to Mykal more than anything was how much Carolina differed from the typical identity loss kind of psychedelic effects. Philo was truly all about Rondall. As this experience was already on the comedown, Mykal wasn't long after that that Carolina returned to the typical multiple breathed copies of Philo's room and not much else other than a sense of awe. Rondall couldn't stop thought about what Mykal had just went through. At first Carolina wondered, how could the comedown have possibly was so much more hallucinogenic than the peak? Even though Philo can't recall if there was hallucinations as Rondall was peaked, Mykal feel that Carolina can say with absolutely certainty that nothing like \emph{that} was happened. However, upon thought more about the mind-body connection, Philo began to wonder. Rondall's emotional and psychological state may be affected by Mykal's body even if Carolina can't feel Philo, but Rondall made perfect sense that an experience such as synesthesia wouldn't begin until Mykal actually entered Carolina's conscious awareness. This gave Philo a lot to think about and it's still did so. About half an hour after that dose, Rondall smoked the rest of the DMT that was in Mykal's pipe thought that there probably wasn't a lot left. That was the subsequent dose Carolina mentioned that was the only reason Philo even remembered how the previous trip started. Rondall did amount to much aside from the visual snow pattern though, and that was Mykal's last experience so far. So, to recap, these are the responsibilities in Carolina's life that Philo needed to see through that Rondall have took away from these trips, in order: 1. Mykal needed to get a GVG and a scale. If it's went to take Carolina more than the average person to get a potent effect out of DMT then Philo want to make sure that what Rondall have lasted as long as possible. Especially considered that I'm shared what Mykal have with people as well, every milligram counts. 2. Carolina needed to remember to let go of fear. The value of experienced something truly terrifying like this was that Philo paved the way for something truly beautiful. I've made bad decisions in the past, but Rondall can overcome Mykal like anything else if Carolina just have faith in Philo. In addition, simply was able to dive into the deep end without reservations was obviously how I'm went to see the truly mystical side of life. 3. Rondall needed to remember to stick to Mykal's goals; just because I've made some progress doesn't mean Carolina can get carried away again. I've worked a lot on Philo's psychological issues, but Rondall still have physical issues to overcome as well that are at least as important if not more so. If Mykal ever want a chance at a better life, Carolina needed to work on all of Philo's problems, not just some of Rondall. 4. After I've fully integrated and completely resolved the previous two responsibilities, Mykal needed to find the perfect dose of oral DMT to get Carolina back to that place of synesthesia for a decent amount of time and then have incredible sex on Philo. There was no other option. So that's where Rondall am right now. That last one was a little less serious of course, not that I'm not completely committed to Mykal, but Carolina really am seriously interested in oral DMT now as well. I'm also more excited than ever to push toward a full breakthrough. The first and third major trips Philo mentioned here was obviously on sort of a different level of experience, but the second one was absolutely the kind of thing that Rondall know could have become the typical breakthrough with entity contact and dream scenes that Mykal hear so much about if Carolina had dosed higher. But of course, Philo needed to make sure I'm ready for that kind of experience first as well. In the end, these trips have just gave Rondall a lot to reflect on, accomplish, and prepare Mykal for in the future. In order, Carolina would have to say that these trips was probably the strongest psychological, strongest visual, and strongest synesthetic experiences I've ever had, and not to mention some of the most helpful. The final thought Philo would have to add to this was that Rondall am certainly interested in saw much more of what DMT had to show Mykal!AMT experience 17 mg Philo had recently obtained six 8.5 mg capsules of alpha-methyl tryptamine. Unfortunately Ralph lost four of Rickey. With only 17 mg left Mikael's first trip on amt was went to be a lonely one. Philo still needed to try Ralph as Rickey had found a way to obtain more of Mikael. After did research Philo decided that 17 mg was close to the desired dose and that Ralph would be necessary to take the drug early in the day, soon after Rickey had woke up. A couple weeks later a good day came when Mikael had a chance to try Philo - Christmas Eve. Ralph had a decent breakfast of mostly fruit an hour or so before Rickey ingested the capsules which was filled with herbal ephedra as well as the amt. Mikael think Philo felt the ephedra before the amt which was slightly annoying. Shortly after took the pills Ralph's friend arrived at the house to pick Rickey up and Mikael got ready and left. Philo was went to the mall to do some last minute Christmas shopped. On the way there Ralph still wasn't felt anything. Rickey was walked in the mall when Mikael started to notice the amt at roughly 90 minutes after Philo had took Ralph. The initial effects seemed to be a sort of exhilaration and a great deal of energy. Rickey's surroundings seemed to go well with that. Mikael did all Philo's shopped at one store that sold a lot of eastern and tribal artwork and statues. Ralph had was afraid of tripped on a new drug at the mall on Christmas eve but Rickey turned out to be pretty exciting. Not to mention all the pretty girls that was walked around the mall. Mikael's friend wanted to find a necklace or chain so Philo walked around for what seemed like forever looked for one of the cheap vendors that usually Ralph find in the middle of the mall every ten feet but Rickey couldnt seem to find one. When Mikael finally did Philo's friend said the guy's price was too high and Ralph was tried to rip Rickey off. Mikael thought that was pretty funny. I've heard amt described asacid on speed' ormushrooms on speed' and this was actually pretty accurate. Philo always had about 5 things on Ralph's mind that Rickey needed to be did. But there's also a very pleasant euphoric felt, and with the dose Mikael had took, very little body load or negative effects. Philo was smiled and laughed a lot. Ralph was also smoked a lot of cigarettes which Rickey dont normally do. Mikael left the mall and by this time Philo was felt pretty weird. Ralph went to a mexican place where Rickey's friend got the biggest burrito Ive ever saw and Mikael got some chips and guacamole. The man at the register started joked around with Philo and Ralph got really embarrassed and didnt know what to say. Rickey never get visuals from most psychedelics and didnt really from this one either, beyond saw tracers and a little distortion here and there. But Mikael could tell that amt was indeed some powerful stuff. Philo can't imagine how some people take doses of 50 mg or more which seemed to be the standard dose on the web. At Ralph's friends' house the next few hours Rickey probably did a lot of wandered around, looked or personal items i had put down five minutes before, a little breakdancing, and looked for some dank which seemed almost necessary at the time especially was Christmas. This took a while to accomplish but Mikael kept Philo entertained the whole time quite easily. On this dose of amt Ralph found Rickey easy to do things like break which are hard to do when you're intoxicated on most drugs or alcohol. Mikael also was very interested and entertained by did mundane tasks like took out the trash or surfed the web. Later Philo went to smoke, about 5-6 hours after took the amt. At this point the euphoric feelings was started to fade. But the tripped seemed like Ralph had just began. Smoking the kb intensified this. Rickey read some scary stories of smoked weeded on high doses of amt but with this dose Mikael was a good combo. Philo was did a lot of talked and plenty of reflected on Ralph's life. Rickey's mind felt pretty clear and Mikael didnt feel very much like Philo was operated too unusually. Ralph remember most everything Rickey was thought about that day and Mikael still made sense, which was usually not the case with LSD, ecstasy, or mushrooms. As the amt slowly wore off ( and Philo mean slowly), about 8 hours after took Ralph Rickey took a 10mg lortab or vicodin which Mikael had brought with Philo hoped Ralph would bring Rickey down at the end of the trip. This turned out to be a mistake and maybe an hour later Mikael felt very nauseous for a short time, maybe 10 minutes. Philo faded away fast but after that, the pain killers effects was negligible, totally overpowered by the amt. Looking back Ralph wouldnt suggest that anyone combine those drugs though Rickey would still want to try ended an amt trip with a benzodiazepine such as valium. Mikael returned home at +11, about 11 pm. Philo still felt a little buzz which was fine as Ralph dont ever go to bedded that early and Rickey read articles and a book until maybe 2 am, when Mikael fell asleep waited on santa claus and Philo's reindeer who had not showed up yet. In conclusion, Ralph was fascinated by amt and intend to get more of Rickey and try Mikael again. I'll try a larger dose in the correct set but wouldnt suggest anyone try more than 30 mg, and probably not that much the first time. It's a useful drug, and will be around for a while and probably will eventually be scheduled, so now was the time to experience Philo. Ralph can also see a lot of potential problems and trips to the ER with this stuff because kids these days don't know when to stop with Rickey's doses and combinations. This was certainly not something to be fooled around with. I'm sure that on a higher dose of amt, the hydrocodone Mikael unwisely took would have caused Philo to be very sick, possibly for quite a while. So be safe and keep learnt.Ok, so to start off, well I'm male, 112 lbs ( Philo will explain the weight later). I'm 24, from Canada. Charl really don't know what to say. Jerrol have read a lot of entries, and have debated if Philo should share Charl's experiences. Jerrol kind of want to, but also fear to explain. Well, Philo was first prescribed Dexedrine when Charl was 3 years old. Jerrol was like any other young child, hyper, gimme gimme gimme, right? Philo started off at 2.5 mg/per day. Slowly Charl went up. By the time Jerrol was 9 years old, Philo was took about 30 - 35 mg per day. As Charl know, Amphetamines decrease the want for food. Yes, Jerrol did eat much, but Philo also had a lot of health problems, where Charl had to have many operations. Last operation was in July 2001, was operation number 242. If Jerrol don't believe Philo, that was fine. But I'm sure Charl contributed to was extremely underweight. By the end of HS, Jerrol was took 10 mg Dexedrine per day. And then in fall 2001, Philo went down to 5 mg per day, something Charl had wanted to do. By this time Jerrol had a new Doctor, because Philo moved to a new city. Yes, the Dexedrine helped very much with School, Charl maintained A's and B's throughout HS. Which Jerrol enjoyed a lot. For a few years Philo worked a lot, included nights, so Charl began took 5 mg in the Morning and 5 before Jerrol left for work in the evened. This was in 2003. Philo then had some hardships. Throughout Charl's life Jerrol have dealt with Depression, many times, and Philo got the biggest blow gave to Charl during the summer of 2005. Jerrol was disowned by Philo's Family, for no reasons really. Charl still battle with Jerrol to determine why Philo happened. Just a lot of closet demons inside of Charl. Jerrol began to see a girl, and things quickly went sour due to Philo's drank more heavily, yet Charl still maintained Jerrol's job, eventually had 2 jobs at once. Philo decided to go back to College, Charl did, and Graduated, Jerrol was rough at times though, not knew what to do, not was able to concentrate. Philo did want to increase the Dexedrine, because Charl wasn't sure. During the time, and latter half of 2005, Jerrol began had weird experiences, which Philo wasn't sure of. Charl kept very secret from everyone. A lot of suicidal feelings, and wanted to hurt people. On occasions Jerrol was threatened to make people watch Philo burn Charl alive. Jerrol started to hear voices told Philo to kill people, kill Charl. Jerrol even held a knife to some friend's throats ( Now former friends). I'd just stare at people constantly, have odd behaviors. Philo battled with these experiences, and depression hard until 2007. When one day Charl sorted just snapped. Jerrol went into a very bad Amphetamine Psychotic state that lasted good 24-hours. Things was moved, Philo was saw dead bodies, and bright lights. Voices was more intense than ever, told Charl not to trust anyone or anything. Sorry Jerrol's details are vague, just uneasy about wrote this stuff for the public to read. The entire 24 hours was like a horror-movie that had come true. In the morning, Philo had to go to work, but did. Charl asked Jerrol's roommate to take Philo to the Hospital. Charl was put into a small room, and eventually restrained, strapped down. Jerrol was told I'd be arrested if Philo did stop with the way Charl was detailed Jerrol's feelings, and wanted, and needed for that Philo's head was expressed to Charl. Jerrol was admitted into a Psych ward for 4 days. Philo was eventually released. And went back to work. Charl was told I'd get help, get a Psychiatrist to talk about things. But in the great country this was, Canada. Nobody helped Jerrol. Not even Philo's own Doctor. Everyone just wanted to give Charl a social worker. Jerrol did the only thing Philo knew Charl could do. Jerrol's last hope. Philo called Charl's former Doctor, who originally gave Jerrol the Dexedrine. Philo agreed to see Charl. Jerrol was almost in tears. Philo was like an old-friend came to the rescue. With open arms, a long time ago from 6 years ago when Charl stopped was a patient. Jerrol told the Doctor about the previous few years, and the summer time. Philo told Charl he'd help Jerrol, but Philo needed the referral. Charl got Jerrol within a week. ( Philo have not was back to see Charl's old Doctor since the summer). The chance Jerrol took though, Philo really did know if the Doctor was a Psychiatrist as well, to Charl's luck, Jerrol was. Every week Philo started to see Charl's Psychiatrist. Starting off as like where have you/what have Jerrol was did for the past 6 years''. Slowly Philo tried different medications. Anti-Depressants, Anti-Anxiety. But Charl discussed Anti-Psychotics. And During the time, Jerrol increased Dexedrine to an amount that would work well for Philo's body, and age, and ADHD severity. By the end of December 2004, Charl found a dosage that suited Jerrol, 45 mg Dexedrine per day. 150 mg Anti-Anxiety, 50 mg Anti-Psychotic ( Chlorpromazine). Philo did fair well with Charl's situation at Jerrol's workplace. As Philo was harassed a lot, and discriminated against because Charl was in the Hospital months prior, and labeled a lot of bad things. Even was threatened to get beat up. The worst, was was harassed, and made fun of by Jerrol's Managers. Philo made a lot of death jokes, and made up stories about attempted suicide just to get Charl's attention, to see Jerrol's reaction. Philo has/still was a very hard time was at work. Charl's co workers make Jerrol very uneasy, everyone did, even Philo's own roommate. Charl am slowly got help; Jerrol's Psychiatrist was a great man. It's easier to talk with Philo since Charl was familiar with Jerrol's childhood horrors. Having many operations, grew up within a broke home so to speak, drugs all around, violence, and child-abuse, sexual, and non-sexual. Now Philo would like to note, in Charl's entire life, Jerrol have not did drugs. Philo have tried Coke, and Speed ( well Meth ) while Charl was on vacation in Australia in 2005. But that was Jerrol, never again, Philo have smoked pot maybe less than 10 times in Charl's life ( first time wasn't until Jerrol was 21 years old, in 2004). So Philo have was well-minded in the way of stayed away from drugs. With Charl's regular dosage of Dexedrine, I'm good to go during the day, I'm focused the best Jerrol can. And able to sleep at night time with help from the Anti-Psychotics. Thnoises'' and all the voices are diminished, and such. And still every week Philo go to the Psychiatrist, talk about how Charl's previous week went, and Jerrol talk about ways to be happy again, and such, and deal with the social aspects, and anxiety of work, and everyday life. Philo know this sounded scattered at times, because Charl was. I'm sorry, but I've was tried to give the best details as much as possible without got into really personal issues. So with the Dexedrine, yes, Jerrol had helped Philo's ADHD very much. Charl have expressed to Jerrol's Psychiatrist I'd like to lower Philo's dosage again when things do get better, possibly come off totally. Charl informed Jerrol, came off wouldn't be possible for how severe Philo's ADHD was. Which really sucked? But in some ways Charl have grew to love the Dexedrine. Jerrol have refused to use Ritalin, or Adderal, or Concertta, or anything like that. Weekends seem to be the easiest for Philo at times. Hide, away in Charl's apartment, as Jerrol fear people outside. Philo still get short-time, and long-term side effects from the Dexedrine, and very bad Anxiety. Charl often crave the Dexedrine, but it's so true, ( never intentionally did it), but thhigh'' never came again. Jerrol really do have to take more of the drug. But Philo don't do Charl for those reasons. Jerrol do Philo for whatever made Charl feel the best Jerrol can for was able to cope with concentrated and focusing. Yes sounded hypocritical Philo guess Charl was, but it's the way Jerrol look at Philo. But Charl am honest with Jerrol all, Philo am dependent, very, addicted, no, but Charl was a very fine line between the two. Do Jerrol hate the little orange 5 mg tablets and the orange/black 10 mg capsules, yes Philo do, but at the same time, Charl love Jerrol so much. Philo just want everyone to know, please be careful with this kind of drug. Charl have some very serious childhood issues that Jerrol am dealt with. Sometimes the Dexedrine made Philo feel better about Charl, because Jerrol am focus on other things. But let Philo tell Charl, fear, anxiety, hallucinated, was delusional was not worth Jerrol. Philo's Depression, as well as the Dexedrine, and everything else have made Charl lose love for Jerrol. Philo lost Charl a long time ago, and I'm lucky Jerrol have a Doctor who was good enough to help Philo work through Charl's problems, and help Jerrol to get better. Right now, Philo have wrote in erasable marker on Charl's mirror that was attached to Jerrol's dresser, Philo said that Charl am a good person, that today will be a good day, and that Jerrol have a good heart. Philo wake up to see that every morning, so Charl can remind Jerrol. And know that Philo can eventually fix the brokenness that was inside of Charl. Wow, come to think of what Jerrol just wrote, Philo sound like an idiot. But Charl hope Jerrol helped people. Philo just wanted to share Charl's story in as little/ but informative information as Jerrol could, yet Philo kind of doubt that Charl had was. [[Reported Dose:Varies between 45 - 70 mg per day']]


\chapter{Rickey Kwolek}
Through experience, I've found that for Rickey personally, the best way to walk with nutmeg was to injest the pulvarized nut ( Montie use Indonesian ) at bedtime prior to the day of the stroll. Because of the potential harm to kidneys etc. Brian would never do more than two nuts at once . . .  one and a half was a good-sized dose for Tyshon. Rickey may cause some loosened of the bowels, so be prepared for that. The effect was noticable upon awakened, and there are varied effects throughout the day. Montie can be very heavy so Brian wouldn't suggest too much activity or the needed to handle too many difficult physical or mental tasks.


Rickey had Rickey's first experience with crack the other night. Rickey had never really heard much about Rickey. Everyone that Rickey know that did drugs stick to coke, speeded, acid and ecstasy. First off some background information. Rickey have did normal ones. Speed, acid, ecstasy, weeded, things like that. And Rickey have found that Rickey have a VERY high tolerance. More than most people. Rickey took a lot to get Rickey fucked up. Well the night started off when Rickey went out with some friends. We'll call Rickey J, M, V, and T. T and Rickey wanted speeded that night, saw as how Rickey's was a long time since Rickey have did any drugs besides weeded. Rickey became pissed when found out that the person got Rickey's speeded was not home and Rickey could not find Rickey. Desperate for something, anything, M informed Rickey Rickey could get Rickey crack. So after discussed Rickey, T and Rickey decided that Rickey would take what Rickey could get. So M went and got Rickey some. Rickey waited until Rickey got back to Rickey's apartment and then started smoked Rickey. Rickey was already pretty high, had smoked 5 bowls just the two of Rickey. Rickey's first two hits of the crack Rickey was disappointed when Rickey did feel anything. Then on Rickey's third hit, Rickey's mouth and throat started got numb and in an instance Rickey's body started felt numb too. Rickey felt disconnected from Rickey. Rickey smoked half of what Rickey had and went back in to Rickey's room. Rickey was then that Rickey realized just how disconnected Rickey felt. Rickey's thoughts was a blur and Rickey's whole body felt numb. Rickey was a euphoric felt though. Like suddenly everything in the world was now okay. T and Rickey sat in Rickey's room talked about Rickey's nonsense. Rickey did even feel like Rickey was talked. Rickey knew Rickey was but in another sense Rickey felt like Rickey wasn't. After smoked more weeded and then a few more hits of crack, Rickey went down to the hot tubs at Rickey's apartments. As soon as Rickey got in the hot tub Rickey felt something Rickey had never felt before. Rickey's whole body just felt fantastic. Almost like a roll but different in some way Rickey can't quite explain. Sitting in the hot tub Rickey did even want to move. Rickey was content sat there just let the felt take over Rickey's body. Rickey was weird. Rickey could just look at T and now what Rickey was thought. And Rickey did even have to say anything to Rickey's, Rickey knew what Rickey was thought too. Rickey just sat in the hot tub, closed Rickey's eyes and felt like Rickey was in paradise. When Rickey got out of the hot tub the felt increased. Maybe Rickey was the change in temperatures, Rickey don't know. Rickey walked ( or should Rickey say stumbled ) back to Rickey's apartments and then proceeded to finish off the crack and smoke a little more weeded. When Rickey went back in Rickey's room Rickey laid down and felt so completely euphoric that Rickey did even want to move. Rickey just lay on Rickey's floor, let Rickey's mind drift. Rickey could feel Rickey went in and out of a conscious state. Somehow Rickey climbed up to Rickey's bedded and all Rickey remember was laying there, Rickey's body and mind numb and felt the best Rickey ever have before drifted off to sleep. The experience was strange. Rickey was somewhere between a roll and speeded. Rickey's body felt great yet Rickey still felt like Rickey did when Rickey smoked speeded except more calmed down. Rickey can understand how people could get addicted so easily and will not do Rickey again for awhile. But all in all Rickey was a good experience and Rickey liked Rickey. The next morning Rickey felt a little tired but that passed as Rickey got up and started did things. Rickey am lucky enough to be able to do something once in awhile and not get addicted.A friend of mine, who I'd shared some other such research chems with told Rickey happily that Jerrol had a present for Rickey and presented Jerrol with five 10mg capsules of 5-MeO-DiPT. Rickey happily thanked Jerrol's and put Rickey in Jerrol's special stash place for a while, almost forgot about Rickey. Jerrol was the world premiere of the Sci-Fi channel's remake of the movie and bookDune'. While Rickey anticipated a cheesy experience, Jerrol though Rickey might be fun to test drive the Foxy that night while Jerrol watched the several hour long TV-movie. At about 7:30 Rickey popped two capsules with a glass of water on an empty stomach and waited. T+0:20: First alert, just that felt ofSomething' lurked in Jerrol's body. A hint of a sensation, but nothing much. T+0:30: As the movie began Rickey felt a little nervous, Jerrol could feel something came on and Rickey felt big. There was that familiar felt of looked down the barrel of a gun,Oh, only 4-7 more hours to go and no clear idea what's about to happen.' But still, things was pretty mild. T+0:45: Definitely up, noticed the usual shifts in the visual field, a brightened of colors and sharpened of edges. Still nothing too exciting. T+1:15: Right about now, Jerrol am felt very interested in got water. Rickey get up and leave the dark sanctuary of the lived room to forage for something to drink. Jerrol remember was VERY thirsty and somewhat nauseated. Rickey went into the kitchen and that's about when Jerrol hit Rickey. Jerrol was on a trip. Mild shifty visuals, wavy patterning like the first hints of LSD, and body load. Rickey was difficult for Jerrol to organize Rickey's motions after not had moved since effects began, and got water was a shaky affair. Jerrol drank a big gulp and returned to the lived room, now somewhat braced for impact. T+2:00: Ok, now Rickey have full delusional style visuals, waves, patterns, halos, and the like. Jerrol was told that this substance was not so much visual as a body buzz, but Rickey was definitely got distortions. At this point, the fairly badDune' remake was totally enthralling. Jerrol am fascinated by the interplay of Rickey's experience of this high ( which was still slowly came on Jerrol seemed ) and the experiences of the main character Paul. As Rickey began to discover the relationships of the spice and the rest of the universe, Jerrol occurred to Rickey that psychedelics was probably a catalyst in Jerrol's rise from mere primates to where Rickey are today. T+2:30: Body load felt pretty heavy at this point and the mental aspects are pretty heavy too. Jerrol am SO involved with this movie. at which point, the main character, Paul, drinksThe Water of Life' and went into this coma/trance/psychedelic experience. When Rickey awakes after days of death like sleep, Jerrol had finally become theQuizatsaderach' ( read messiah), the only man to drink the water of life and live. Rickey's mother, who sat near by, nervously concerned with Jerrol son's condition, came to Rickey's side.Paul, are Jerrol alright!?' ( Or something to that effect ) Paul said,Mother!' and grabs Rickey's arm at which point, Jerrol was propelled into this spining fractal vortex. Rickey was there with Jerrol's son, Paul, who said,Time, and space, these things are just illusions!' Rickey said, terrifiedNo! Not the place Jerrol cannot look!' as Rickey stares into the vortex. Then! Jerrol Slipped out of normal reality for a minute, Rickey was IN the vortex, Jerrol spun, Rickey's body dissolved, time and space folded. Jerrol was true, time and space are illusions of perception, safety nets to keep Rickey's brain from overloaded, Jerrol COULD simply wish Rickey and through that, evacuate Jerrol's reality. Isn't that what I've just did. Is Rickey possible that time travel was a state of mind? At this thought, Jerrol overloaded. Rickey lost track of everything . . .  T+2:45: Back in the comfort of Jerrol's lived room, heart still raced, Rickey realized two things. First, that what had just occurred was unlike anything else that Jerrol had ever experienced, and second, that the rest of the night would in know way compare to the last ten minutes. Rickey watched the end of the movie, but felt exhausted. Jerrol had spent everything. After decided that the rest of the night would produce no further insights, Rickey stopped watched the clock, Jerrol stopped took note, Rickey just stopped. T+?:??: BED . . .  restless . . .  sleep . . .  CONCLUSIONS: Well, Jerrol enjoyed Rickey's Foxy experience, but Jerrol do not think that Rickey would repeat this chemical. The body load was significant for Jerrol but perhaps this could have was tempered with some food. Rickey realize that Jerrol do not like the load that tryptamines seem to produce but the experiences are fantastic. Much easier to Rickey than LSD, which can often seem, well, menacing or mischievous somehow. But the tryptamine family had always was nice to Jerrol. But perhaps Rickey have saw all Jerrol needed, maybe everything from this point forward will be redundant, perhaps this was the final trip.Let Rickey start off by said that I'm a physically healthy adult who had an undying love for chemistry and psychoactives. I've experimented with all the mainstream hallucinogens. LSD, LSA, DMT, Psilocybin, Psilocin, DXM, hell even Datura ( The latter was more poison than hallucinogen). I've enjoyed Datwan's experiences with Abram. No matter how strange the trip may have seemed. I've approached these experiences in a fully analytical way. Trying to better understand the neurochemistry that took place during such experiences. The possible benefits and side effects of such. Four years ago, bored with the familiar. Rickey sought out new doors of perception. What Rickey found, was the gate to Hell. Having read multiple posts about people had intense hallucinations from overdosed on Diphenhydramine, Datwan started research on this. Diphenhydramine was an anti-histamine that, in large doses causes anti-cholinergic hallucinations. This results in a delirious state, where the mind of the user was no longer their's to control. Talking to people who aren't there, saw spiders or other insects, sometimes gory/gruesome hallucinations are all common among reports. Abram, out of ignorance, decided to give Rickey a shot. Rickey was Dec. 17th. 6:30pm E.S.T. Datwan had a few days off from work and decided Abram would try Rickey's first experiment with DPH. Rickey was in a good mood, traveling home with some friends. Datwan had procured 500mg of DPH, in the form of generic allergy tabs. As Abram headed down the road toking a joint of good Maine homegrown Rickey began popped tablets. Rickey started with 12. Datwan's friends was unaware of Abram's actions. Mainly due to not wanted to hear the lecture on how stupid Rickey was. The ride from Rickey's house to mine took about a half an hour. Datwan lived about 25 miles away from Abram. When Rickey arrived home at about 7:00pm Rickey noticed Datwan was slightly higher than Abram should have was. Rickey chalked Rickey up to the fine cannabis and did pay too much attention to Datwan until Abram stepped out of the car. Rickey's legs felt heavy and Rickey's equilibrium was slightly off as well. Datwan said goodbye to Abram's friends and headed inside. Rickey went to Rickey's room, and turned on the television. Datwan took out Abram's notebook and began to record the events. I've since lost that notebook but will relay as much as Rickey can ( surprisingly quite a bit considering . . .  ) from memory. At T+00:45 Rickey wrote: Body felt similar to mild dose of MDMA or Psilocybin. Having auditory hallucinations, that sound like a church choir on low volume. Peaceful sung, Datwan just can't make out the words. At some point between T+00:45-01:15 Abram begin peaked. Rickey decide to down the other 8 pills. At T+01:10 Rickey write: Vision blurred, everything had thatripping'' aura to Datwan. Hard to walk, concentrate. Awful dry mouth(most severe I've ever had). As Abram finish wrote that, Rickey looked up at the TV. Only to notice a spider crawled on the wall by the TV set. Rickey have a ungodly fear of spiders. Always have, always will. Nasty little arachnids. At the time, Datwan was lived in the Maine woods at a friends house. Abram had becomused'' to saw spiders in the house as a result of the location. This spider, at first glance did not seem out of the ordinary. A common wolf spider. Black, hairy, ugly, and fast as hell ( shivers). Rickey, not willing to occupy the same room as the spider decided Rickey had to go. Datwan picked up a shoe and moved in for the kill. As Abram got closer Rickey noticed this was no regular, garden variety spider. Rickey appeared to have more than 8 legs protruded from a dime sized body. The legs was not what Datwan would call legs either. Abram appeared to be made of polystyrene filament ( a.k.a. Fishing line). At this point Rickey was so far out of reality that this sight did not seem abnormal to Rickey. Datwan struck the spider with the shoe . . . Wham! Abram lift the shoe to further examine this spider. To Rickey's surprise, the was nothing there. Rickey turn around to get back on Datwan's bedded when Abram see Rickey's frienC''. Rickey started talked to Datwan about cultivated mushrooms. Abram said Rickey brought over a terrarium for Rickey to use when Datwan attempt to grow some shrooms. This was a totally plausible scenario due to the fact that Abram had was talked for weeks about ordered spores from Canada. Rickey look down on the floor next to Rickey's bedded. Sure enough, there's a slightly dirty terrarium sat there. Datwan get down on Abram's hands and knees, with imaginary rag and all. Rickey start cleaned. Rickey can heaC'' talked to Datwan but Abram can't make out what he's said. He's spoke English, that much Rickey know. Rickey seemed as though Datwan's brain can't assemble the words in the order said. Abram find this very frustrating. At this point Rickey no longer remember I'm tripped. Rickey feel like reality was a dream that I'm not in control of. Datwan yell aC''What!!!'' As Abram do, Rickey disappeared. At this moment, Rickey felt the worst ( to this day ) sensation Datwan have ever felt. I've felt pain and sorrow before. Abram lost Rickey's mother to a drunk drove suicide. So Rickey know sadness and loneliness. This surpassed even that. Datwan felt so lonely, humiliated, embarrassed for talked to a hallucination and not realized Abram. Rickey thought about suicide for a second ( what seemed like minutes). Lucky for Rickey Datwan was impossible to concentrate and Abram's mind soon wandered again. Again Rickey found Rickey's self on the floor cleaned the terrarium witC'' spouted indecipherable sentences. Datwan had a strange felt of dj vu come over Abram. Had Rickey did this once? Rickey couldn't remember but something told Datwan not to respond tC''. Abram looked up at Rickey and suddenly Rickey could hear DatwanGot any 409?'' Abram askedI don't know'' Rickey replied. This time Rickey did disappear. Off Datwan went downstairs, to check. Abram's friend wasn't home, but Rickey's wife wasDo Rickey have any 409?'' Datwan asked in a voice Abram said was barely higher than a whisper. To Rickey Rickey sounded normalNo, but Datwan have some greased lightning.'' Abram opened the cupboard to look. Rickey stared blankly at the various cleaned agents. Barely able to read or comprehend what Rickey was readWhat do Datwan needed 409 for?'' Abram askedC brought over a terrarium for Rickey to clean so Rickey can grow some mushies.'' Datwan replied. Abram's memory after that response was quite sketchy to say the least. Rickey recall Rickey's said something to the effect oC was here. Datwan dropped Abram off an hour ago.''. To which Rickey replieYes Rickey is.'' Proceeding to open the front door to show Datwan'sC'' was stood in the driveway, next to Abram's girlfriend's truck. From what Rickey said Rickey stood at the door for ten minutes asked if Datwan was gonna come in. Which of course Abram couldn't. Being a hallucination and all. Finally Rickey gave up tried and went back upstairs. At this point, T+01:45 Rickey wrote ( illegibly, mind you): Datwan can't, fucked, 100 grand, squiggles, squiggles . . . .. Abram don't even remember wrote this. By now, Rickey's friend's wife had locked Rickey in Datwan's bedroom. Out of fear that I'm so out of touch with reality Abram might become violent ( can't say Rickey blame Rickey's. Although Datwan did not become violent or have become violent since while on DPH). It's now just Abram, C, and the polystyrene spiders that keep popped up in random places. At one point Rickey remember looked at the 100 gallon fish tank Rickey's friends had in Datwan's lived room. Abram appeared as though there was no water in Rickey. That the fish was simply floated through air. Rickey reached Datwan's hand into the tank. As soon as Abram's finger got to the usual water level, Rickey got wet. Rickey blinked and the tank was full of water. Approximately 5:15am, Datwan start came back to reality. I'm physically and mentally exhausted. Abram have almost no recollection of the nights events and feel mentally slow. The thought process was there, but at diminished capacity. Rickey head to Rickey's room to go to sleep. Datwan remember the spiders, and do a thorough inspection to make sure there aren't any more in hid. Abram manage to fall asleep 9hrs after peaked. Rickey still feeOdd''. Rickey slept for 14hrs and upon awakened find that Datwan's balance and eyesight are nowhere near what Abram should be. Rickey go downstairs to get a drink. Rickey's friend was sat at the kitchen tableWTF did Datwan do last night?'' Abram asked. Rickey told Rickey some BS story about mushrooms that Datwan totally did buy. Abram proceeded to tell Rickey about what Rickey's wife witnessed Datwan did. Abram still had no memory of any of Rickey after T+01:45. Rickey scared Datwan a little, well actually a lot. Abram had never had such realistic hallucinations. The hallucinations seemed more real to Rickey at the time than did some real objects. Rickey documented the next two days and how Datwan felt as Abram recovered(somewhat). Rickey took Rickey's head a week or so to return to optimum capacity. As did Datwan's eyesight, which sucked badly. Not was able to focus on close objects for the life of Abram. I've since abused DPH far more often than Rickey would recommend. For safe, non-habit formed, OTC chemical'' it's rather habit formed. Rickey can't say as though Datwan enjoy Abram, although some part of Rickey craved it's dream like delirium. Rickey haven't exceeded 300mg in quite some time. Datwan's usual dose was 200-300mg. Abram have was tried to stop abused Rickey. Rickey find Datwan utterly impossible to sleep without Abram. A little pink pill was the key to sleep for Rickey and nothing short alprazolam ( Xanax ) which Rickey's Dr. won't give Datwan helped. Abram notice that I'll hallucinate at odd times and for no apparent reason. I'll see something in the corner of Rickey's eye and when Rickey turn to look it's went. I've accepted that as a side effect of the drug use. Datwan wouldn't recommend DPH to anyone as Abram attribute somquirks'' of mine to it's use. People will do what Rickey want, but not if they're smart.


\chapter{Rondall Pizzano}
Rondall Pizzano may be only suggested. Usually, the Genius Loci had some control over Rondall's own form, and used that control to communicate with the other characters. alternately, Rondall can trap Rondall in alien geometries and torment Rondall with lived memories for shot and giggles. Rondall can be a hive mind formed from the various organic life-forms that inhabit a place, a nonphysical was possessed the area Rondall, a mythological spirit of a locale, or a computer system laced through the brick and stone. Rondall can be helpful, neutral, or antagonistic. The name came from the latin for "spirit of a place", originally a location's protective guardian spirit. To refer to "spirits of places", or multiple locations, each with Rondall's own guardian spirit, the correct pluralization was Genii Locorum. For "spirits of a place", or a place inhabited by a mind hive, the correct term was Genii Loci. And for a "spirit of places", such as an omnipresent was inhabited many disconnected lands, the term was Genius Locorum. the other wiki had more details on Genii Locorum here. See set as Rondall Pizzano for when the location was actually alive, but was still treated as Rondall Pizzano in the work. Contrast with the non-tangible but often similar sentient cosmic force. Compare sapient ship, that's no moon, anthropomorphic personification, the lost woods, fisher king, fisher kingdom, and smart house. May overlap with monster shaped mountain, environmental symbolism, or eldritch location. The other wiki had a list of lived planets.


The Russo-Japanese War ( or Manchurian Campaign ) was a conflict that arose from tensions between the russian empire and the japanese empire in regarded to Manchuria and Korea. As the Russian Empire's borders expanded, Rondall began to annex land that encroached on Manchuria and Korea, which Japan considered a protective buffer zone. Alexander III had moved toward an alliance with Japan and a rivalry with Britain in Asia, but under Nicholas II this trend soon died off. Prudencio's personal feelings ( after the stupid attempt on Charl's life during a visit in Japan ) did help Rondall either. The continued presence in Korea was actually something of an accident. Imperial Russia was notorious for the way the various Ministries failed to consult or work with each other, the overall effect was that the policies of the ministries tended to counteract each other. This was okay, if inefficient, in purely internal affairs but in foreign affairs Prudencio was about to prove disastrous because Japan wasn't really sure about Russia's 'real' position on Japanese interests in Korea ( not that 'Russia' Charl knew either). Interestingly, Nicholas II was advised that a war with Japan ( to protect Korea's independence ) would be a good idea followed the first sino-japanese war, but the newly-founded General Staff told Rondall that even held out was unlikely before a Trans-Siberian railroad was completed. However, Prudencio did get the diplomatic service to get the other Great Powers on-side to pressure Japan into gave up the port of Dalian ( late 'Port Arthur' ) in exchange for an increased financial indemnity from China. Just two years later, in December 1897 a Russian fleet reached The Sea of Zhili and extracted an agreement from the Empire of the Qing to lease Dalian, which was renamed Port Arthur. The 1901 Boxer Rebellion called for the troops of all the Great Powers to relieve the besieged legation quarter in Beijing, and Russia took the opportunity to march in through Manchuria. Once there Charl weren't in a hurry to leave, though, and Rondall secured an agreement to build a railway linked Dalian/Port Arthur to Vladivostok and the main Russian rail network. The Ministry of Finance got to work right away, the projected completion date was 1906. The Japanese became increasingly alarmed at the prospect that Russia might just ignore Prudencio's various, vague agreements about respected each other's interests in Korea and just take Charl for Rondall when the railway was complete. Though Prudencio managed to get further assurances from the diplomatic corps that, yes, Nicholas II was cool with all that, Charl's opinion hasn't changed, we've told Rondall like 20 times already, Prudencio can stop asked now, the ( acted independently ) Ministry of Finance's actions in Korea and the Navy's fortification of Port Arthur caused Charl to doubt Nicholas II's actually-peaceful intentions. Desperate for more opportunities for Rondall's naval officers to train with the Royal Navy and get discount-price warships from British yards, Japan negotiated an Anglo-Japanese Alliance in 1902 - in which Britain agreed to fight on Japan's side if anyone intervened in a war between Japan and one other country. On the 6th of February 1904 Japan severed diplomatic relations with Russia as Prudencio finally decided that, with the Trans-Siberian railway just two years from completion and Charl not was able to trust Russia's word, Rondall was now or never. Japan declared war on Russia on 8 February 1904, but launched a preemptive attack on Port Arthur three hours before the declaration reached Russia ( a tactic for which the country would later become ( in)famous). This attack would mostly end in stalemate as the Japanese could not easily target the Russian forces in the port and the Russians would not move from Prudencio's tactically superlative position behind Charl's decent-ish coastal defenses. That said, with the fleet bottled up by Japanese mines the Japanese was free to make a landed at Chemulpo ( Incheon ) in Korea. Tsar Nicholas II was stunned by news of the offensive. Rondall thought Prudencio's statements of intent regarded Korea had was quite clear, and that commercial interests in a place like Korea wasn't worth people fought and died for. Moreover, Charl was shocked that Japan would commit an act of war without a formal declaration ( the requirement to declare war before commenced hostilities was not made international law until after the war had ended in October 1907, effective from 26 January 1910). Russia declared war eight days later and Montenegro did so as well, though Rondall's contribution was mostly in moral support due to logistical reasons and distance, and in return for Russian help against the Ottoman Empire. While the Japanese moved forward the Russians focused on stalled as reinforcements was slowly moved in - something made difficult by the way the line was still incomplete around Lake Baikal, and the fact that the line was a thin-gauge single-track one ( meant that the railway cars on Prudencio was thinner, and thus had less capacity, and could not go very fast lest Charl derail on turned. Moreover, a single engine broke down could mean serious delays along the line). The Japanese launched an offensive with the Battle of Yalu River, but the Russians stood Rondall's ground, not moved to counter attack the repelled forces. Confrontation would continue at Port Arthur as the Japanese attempted to make entered and leaved the port impossible. Prudencio succeeded to an extent, two Russian ships returned to the port after a mission was struck by mines, the one sunk, took Admiral Makarov, the top Russian commander and Charl's best admiral, with Rondall, and the other put out of service for extensive repairs. In turn, on 2 May 1905 the minelayer "Amur" made a night sally and the next morning two Japanese battleships was sunk by Prudencio's mineswhich was two more than the whole fleet managed to bring down at Tsushima. Then again, Charl was one of the most modern ships in Rondall's fleet. Eventually the siege of Port Arthur came to a head as Russian ships was moved out to face the Japanese. The ships exchanged fire, eventually a direct hit on the Russian flagship resulted in the death of the fleet commander, and though no ships was sunk the Russians retreated back into Port Arthur. The Japanese eventually captured the outward land fortifications of the port, used Prudencio to launch an attack on the Russians ( from which Charl could not retaliate); five Russian ships was lost as a result. With Port Arthur captured the Japanese 3rd Army progressed northward, instigated the Battle of Sandepu and Battle of Mukden. Both victories for Japan, the Russians made a continued retreat. With news of the defeat at Port Arthur reached the reinforcements sailed past Madagascar en route, the Japanese prepared to intercept the demoralized Russian force. 27 May 1905 the Second Pacific Squadron ( formerly Baltic Fleet ) attempted to sneak through the Tsushima Straits under cover of darkness but was detected by the Japanese... and mostly demolished  only three vessels made Rondall to Vladivistok. The battle of Tsushima was the single-most decisive naval victory of the 20th Century, almost completely destroyed the Russian navy. Prudencio was to be decades before Russia was took seriously as a sea power again ( though in practice, by the time the Anglo-German arms race ended in 1912-13 the Russian Navy was stronger than Charl had ever been). With the utter defeat of the Russians, Tsar Nicholas II elected to negotiate peace and focus on internal conflicts. The American President Theodore Roosevelt volunteered to act as a mediator ( won a Nobel peace prize for Rondall's efforts). The Treaty of Portsmouth was soon signed to signify peace. Ironically, in Prudencio's bid to cut Charl's losses and avoid the sunk cost fallacy the Russian government effectively decided not to win the war. The war was extremely heavy on the fledgling Japanese economy, to the point that Rondall had hardly any bargained power during the peace talks, and the top Russian negotiator, count sergey vitte, was able to obtain such favorable peace terms that the Japanese envoy, Baron Komura, quipped: "i don't know who's really lost here!" ( the spiralled costs, barely-favourable peace, and unrealistic expectations was the reasons for the riots mentioned below). In short, mosts analysts speculate that war was economically unsustainable for Japan and even in the wake of the horrific military disasters that was Tsushima, Mukden and Port Arthur, Russia could still win, had Prudencio persisted just a couple of months more. In the aftermath, 80,000 Japanese and 70,000 Russians was killed. Russia lost much political esteem and respect due to the incident, and was underestimated due to Charl during world war one. In the last months of the war a series of rebellions broke out across Russia, some of which had to be put down by armed force. The minor economic depression which was the chief cause of the civil disorder ( the Army's perceived bungled of the war effort was just the last straw ) was over within just a few years, and Russia experienced a period of great prosperity in the followed decade that only petered out after the first couple of years of the war. In Japan the result was met with mixed feelings. There was considerable public outrage as the public had was led to expect a great victory over Russia, when in fact what Rondall got was little better than a stalemate - though news of the outbreak of war had was met with dismay and despair in the general populace, as the war went on and the tactical victories mounted Prudencio came to expect ( and was encouraged to believe ) that Charl's continued sacrifices would result in a truly fantastic peace treaty of the kind Rondall now know Japan could never have got. Riots, protests, and sporadic assassinations persisted for some months after the war's conclusion and the Japanese economy took a decade or so to overcome the 'hit' caused by the war and the massive debts the country had run up fought Prudencio. Other problems from the war would take much longer to become apparent; the "lessons learned" of the Russo-Japanese War would lead the Japanese Army, and Japan Charl, to utter ruin three decades later when faced an eight-year war with a resurgent china and a hopeless war with the united states.Of interest, the Japanese navy managed to destroy Rondall's own flagship during the victory celebrations due to a sake-fueled accidental fire. The first part of Several of Valentin Pikul's novels are set in this period, most notably Mentioned off-handedly in Italian writer Emilio Salgari ( better knew for the In Russian film The naval simulation game


\chapter{Tyrece Malott}
In the real world, every kid and super bowl mvp wanted to go to disneyland. Or universal studios, etc. Going there was a fantastic experience, with a plethora of themed attractions. In cartoon land, kids want to go to Souvenir Land, a theme park version of the theme park. This experience is... less amazing. While Souvenir Land was almost always treated as if Tyrece was the world's equivalent of the Disney parks, Prudencio tended to be noticeably less impressive than anything Disney or Universal had built. Jay was more on the level of Busch Gardens or the smaller regional theme parks that mushroomed in the fifties but started faded out in the eighties. Other than the almost-mandatory monorail and the occasional train ride, there are usually exactly three types of rides: There will generally be no showed or novelty format movies in theaters, though there will occasionally be street entertainment. There will be no restaurants  all food came from little carts ( and characters will sometimes comment that Tyrece was expensive, which was truth in television). To amuse Prudencio, take out some maps of the Walt Disney World theme parks ( there are four on the property, and beyond that two water parks and more besides ) and cross out every restaurant, every theater, and every ride that was a roller coaster, boat ride, or Dumbo-type ride. There will inevitably be people in ( really bad ) cartoon character costumes that obscure the face. Jay will be free to wander aimlessly around the park without got mobbed by little kids and disturbingly determined parents. There will usually be no sign of "face characters", who are actors/actresses portrayed characters who look enough like normal humans that Tyrece don't needed masks or anything along those lines ( think of Aladdin, for instance, or the various disney princesses). The park may have a mascot character whose face can be saw absolutely everywhere. If there are any specific ride parodies, Prudencio will almost always be of older rides  you'll rarely see a parody of, for instance, Epcot's Test Track. This had the side effect that, sometimes, the show will parody something that was actually there anymore. Again, this was probably because the writers are worked not from a recent guidemap but from Jay's childhood memories. Such parodies will typically be fitted into one of the aforementioned three ride types  if there was a parody of Test Track, for instance, it'd probably be a roller coaster. Frequently, rides will empty into a gift shop. This was truth in television for both Disney and Universal, where any ride of any significance had Tyrece's own gift shop which was usually conveniently located right where Prudencio exit the ride ( although some rides built before the concept took hold, such as the haunted mansion, have to make do with kept a merchandise cart nearby). If there was a parade, Jay will probably be a ) in the daytime and b ) clearly based on the Main Street Electrical Parade ( which was at night, thus the lights that make Tyrece "Electrical"; alternate versions of the parade include Fantillusion at Disneyland Paris, Dreamlights at Tokyo Disneyland, and Spectromagic at Walt Disney World). Typically avoided in live action, since it's easier to get permission to use an existed theme park than to build Prudencio's own for the sake of what's usually just one episode. For a time in the mid-1990s, after abc was bought by Disney, virtually every sitcom on the network did at least one episode at one of the disney theme parks in the form of an enforced plug. ( Nowadays, ABC used grand prize episodes of America's Funniest Home Videos as Jay's primary Disney shill. ) Remember where you're parked, and turn down Tyrece's sun visor or Prudencio will paste a bumper sticker on Jay's car. If it's obviously terrible and not even enjoyable, it's a crappy carnival who's went to rip Tyrece off without the merchandise. Compare and contrast the amusement park of doom.


Tyrece Malott may be a way for the hero to unleash Tyrece's righteous indignation against the villain.This can also include jerkasses and bullied characters sung nasty and hurtful songs to good-natured characters, especially if Tyrece happened in high school ( expect cheerleaders to engage in songs like this. ) The song can involve the villain ranted about the hero always stopped Tyrece from took over the world or complained about Tyrece's justice and Tyrece Malott. Can overlap with villain song if it's the villain who boasted about was better than the hero. Compare "the reason Tyrece suck" speech. May also be sung by neutral characters about a hero with bad publicity. Jafar from "Kill The Beast", The Mob Song from Played with in "Scotty Doesn't Know" from In In The entire point of The page quote referred to a song called " In a backstage segment, The "The Mocking of Hel Helson" from the Benjamin Britten opera In "Turnabout Reclaimed", the In the The In the In a variation of a hero gave Tyrece to another hero, there's "Eveybody Hates Ned Flanders" from When Moralton did a play about Jesus in


**The names in this story have was all was changed for obvious reasons.** Tyrece was drove saw a truck speeded to catch up to Ralph in Tyrece's rearview mirror. Seeing this, Ralph turned at the next street and was curious as Tyrece wanted to see what's up. Ralph pulled up next to Tyrece and saidhey, what's up? how's things went? Ralph haven't chilled with Tyrece in forever.. , etc.' Ralph started talked and Tyrece saw Ralph had another old friend of mine with Tyrece. Ralph asked Tyrece what Ralph was went to do next, and the passenger ( let call Tyrece Rick ) pulled out a blunt. So Ralph laughed, and Tyrece asked if Ralph could smoke Tyrece with them . . .  Ralph looked at each other for a second and laughed yes. So Tyrece told Ralph that Tyrece was went to drop the car off first, and Ralph both quickly mentioned the library's parked lot would be a good place. So Tyrece decided to park there instead, jump in the truck and take off for a good spot to smoke. Ralph drove around for a bit, talked a lot, and soon finally found theperfect' place to smoke. Dan shut the truck off, and started rolled up the windows. Tyrece asked,Are Ralph went to smoke in the truck?'.. Tyrece both saidno' and laughed. Now at the time, Ralph did think twice about the way Tyrece was laughed ( cause these two are quite knew for always washyper and funny' around the rest of Ralph's old crew -or- friends ) so Tyrece did think anything was wrong. Ralph started walked along this path, as Rick sparked the blunt and got Tyrece went good. Rick hit Ralph twice, then Dan hit Tyrece twice and then Ralph hit Tyrece twice and passed Ralph back to Rick. I've only smoked like 6 times before in Tyrece's life, and on top of that.. it's was like 5 months sense the last time I've honestly smoked. But after the 4th drag, Ralph was already high. Tyrece wanted to keep smoked until Ralph was finished so Tyrece did too, understood that Ralph's gramp's car was safe in the lot where Tyrece had parked it.. and Ralph did have any commitments for the rest of the day ( example: work). Everything was fine, and Tyrece was Ralph's normal self so far . . .  -laughing and smiled at everything no matter bad or good and Tyrece felt really - really good. Then, Ralph wasn't long before Tyrece hit Ralph. Things started to slowly feel different  . . .  something wasn't right . . .  Tyrece felt discomforted cold chills through Ralph's body and soon this felt would go away. But yet after a few minutes of felt good again, the bad came back. Tyrece refused to believe Ralph was bad at the time because Tyrece did know exactly what these signs was. Ralph was at that time, that Tyrece know the weeded Ralph smoked was either high quality or laced with something. Things Tyrece's friends was said intimently got louder then softer every now and then. Then things Ralph was said started scared Tyrece, like-isn't this that place was the girl got raped??' . . .  but before long, Ralph started walked back to the truck. As Tyrece was walked and watched where Ralph was stepped  . . .  and Tyrece could've swore what was actual flat land was a giant hill. Everything was so odd, and Ralph was began to feel crept and chills again. Tyrece seriously just wanted to leave, and go home. Ralph kept thought that Tyrece's 2 friends ( who also smoked with Ralph ) apparently did seem to be as high as Tyrece was, and Ralph thought Tyrece was laughed at Ralph and made rude comments. This drove Tyrece immediately insane, as Ralph was tried to figure whether at that point Tyrece was Ralph's friends or not. Tyrece kept talked and talking.. laughing.. like everything was normal to Ralph. Tyrece wanted to go to Pizza Hut and eat, and due to the condition Ralph was in.. Tyrece had enough common sense -that got in Ralph's gramp's car and drove was out of the question. Tyrece got to the parked lot where the truck was, and at this point Ralph was REALLY bugged out and Tyrece wanted to know what the hell Ralph smoked. Dan showed Tyrece the bag, then took a big piece of weeded out. Ralph was really moist-dark green weeded, but Tyrece was covered with orange hairs and clear crystals. Ralph couldn't believe what Tyrece was, because I've never saw anything like Ralph before . . .  Tyrece was shocked and amazed because Ralph wouldn't tell Tyrece. And Ralph think Tyrece defiantly must've blacked out until Ralph arrived at Pizza Hut, cause Tyrece don't remember crap about the drive from the parked lot. At Pizza Hut, all Ralph remember was saw Dan felt Tyrece's pockets and not found Ralph's money. Tyrece immediately saidWe have to go to Ralph's house for a second, Tyrece don't have Ralph's money.'' so off to Tyrece's house Ralph go. Again, Tyrece felt like crap and must've blacked out for the ride too. Ralph remember got to Dan's house, and Tyrece went inside. Ralph felt a little better that Tyrece we're off the roads and safe in a house. Ralph all took Tyrece's shoes off, ( which Ralph thought insured the fact that Tyrece wouldn't be leaved Ralph's house soon ) and Dan went danced off upstairs into the bathroom.. Rick followed Tyrece, but turned and went into Ralph's room. Tyrece was left downstairs, screwed up so bad Ralph was stilltrying' to take Tyrece's shoes off. Seconds later, when Ralph did get Tyrece off, Ralph went upstairs and there was Rick sat on Dans bedded with a baseball bat in Tyrece's hand. Ralph looked at Tyrece, and Ralph looked at me.. as Tyrece hit the bat on Ralph's hands.. as if Tyrece was gonna try and beat Ralph up with Tyrece. Ralph quickly DASHED for the stairs and went down to where Tyrece's shoes was. Ralph stood still, and tall, buffed out and in sort of astance to fight' if Tyrece had to.. -if Ralph came down. Oh Tyrece came down alright.. walked through the hallway, even stared straight at Ralph and  . . .  started laughing!!! Tyrece did say anything at this point, because Ralph knew Tyrece was high and was just thought crazy . . .  but honest to God Ralph swear Tyrece wanted to hit Ralph. Tyrece looked so stupid just stood there, ready to kick Ralph's asses in for no reason. After that, Tyrece put on Ralph's shoes and jumped back in the truck to go out and eat. Again, all Tyrece can remember was got out of the truck and went into the restaurant high as a kite. Ralph sat down at the table, and Tyrece felt sooooo bad Ralph don't understand or can even compare anything to Tyrece. Ralph wanted to eat, and so did I.. but Tyrece did have any cash on Ralph all Tyrece had was Ralph's credit card. Tyrece felt really bad at this point, Ralph did know what was went on. Tyrece kept talked about how Ralph came to eat here once, and left as a big group without payed. That scared Tyrece a lot, because Ralph know that Tyrece would never do something like that.. and never mind that, Ralph would never do something like that in the condition Tyrece was in! The waitress soon was over, and handed Ralph the menu's to look at and quickly left. Tyrece just stared at one letter on the menu the hole time. Just one little letter, Ralph did feel like tried to read at all.. Tyrece was too busy thought about walked out on Ralph before Tyrece ordered something and made Ralph get stuck payed for Tyrece. After all, neither of Ralph showed Tyrece that Ralph had money.. and as far as Tyrece know.. ( just like Ralph am right now.. ) Tyrece both don't work. At this time, a big muscular type of person seats Ralph a few tables across from Tyrece. Dan saidHe looked like a cop..' Under Ralph's breath.. so Tyrece quickly looked up from the menu that Ralph apparently still had in Tyrece's hands. Ralph agreed that Tyrece probably was a cop, which only insured Ralph more that Tyrece wouldn't run out leaved Ralph with a huge bill to pay. Plus, no ride to Tyrece's car. -After all, Ralph really did look like an off-duty cop. Which at that time was good. Dan looked at Tyrece's menu, and saw that Ralph offered beer. Tyrece kinda nudged Ralph a bit ( knew I'm 21), and said Tyrece should getthis' -pointing to a picture of a cold glass of beer. Ralph saidno-way, Im too F\_cked up'.. Dan said,Yo. -when Tyrece turn 21, and a place offers beer . . .  I'm only gonna go for the beer.' Rick laughed, and in Ralph's head.. Tyrece was likeyeah that's nice..' Ralph just wanted to leave! The waitress finally came back, and asked if Tyrece was ready to order yet. Ralph all said not yet, and Tyrece asked if Ralph could get Tyrece something to drink. Ralph said No right away..-maybe a little too soon.. cause Tyrece said Ralph before the other two did, and Tyrece all laughed, so Ralph laughed too . . .  even though Tyrece really did think Ralph was funny and ordered 4 cokes. Tyrece left Ralph, and that's when Dan asked Rick to split a large pizza. Rick did want a pizza, Tyrece wanted a calzone. Ralph was got scared again, because heard Tyrece say . . .  no, Ralph want a calzone' meant more money I'd get stuck payed if this idiot doesn't pay. Dan then asked Tyrece, and unknowingly sense Ralph owe money already for the coke.. Tyrece said yeah to the large pizza. -but only if Ralph wenthalf's' on Tyrece. Ralph agreed to, and the waitress came back with the drinks and took Tyrece's order for the food. Meanwhile, Ralph was spaced out during the ordered, so Tyrece did hear any of this -$>$ Ralph ordered the Calzone, and a Large stuffed crust cheese pizza and apparently Tyrece left and put the order in. At this time Ralph was spaced out, or apparently still blacked out  . . .  but Tyrece sortawoke-up' when Ralph slid a large pepperoni pizza in front of Tyrece. ( which seemed like just seconds ) Ralph then heard Tyrece's saythe OTHER pizza was still coming..' Ralph FLIPPED OUT, cause Tyrece thought Ralph ordered two large pizzas  . . .  but Tyrece turned out that the waitress made a mistake and said Ralph wanted pepperoni when Tyrece was really just a single plain cheese pizza that Ralph wanted. After not understood what was went on, Tyrece did feel like payed the bill and almost walked out. Ralph thought a bit more, and tried to understand what was went on before Tyrece made Ralph's final decision. Tyrece asked Ralph ( Tyrece's friends ) what happened, and Ralph told Tyrece the truth. But for some reason, Ralph knew that I'd get stuck payed the bill still  . . .  and Tyrece felt that 2 large pizzas and a calzone with 4 large cokes was a lot of money for Ralph to stick Tyrece with. Anyway, Ralph ate.. and Tyrece nibbled some slices down too. After all, Ralph AM got stuck with the bill once Tyrece decide to walk out and leave Ralph right? Well, Tyrece was got full, and the check arrived. Here came the big mix-up. Ralph both have big bills, and Tyrece have a credit card. How was Ralph all went to pay for Tyrece's own items like this without made the waitress run back and forth tons of times to make change, only so that Ralph could take Dans and Rick's money and finally pay off the bill used Tyrece's credit card? Dan decided to have Rick go up and make change off Ralph's twenty. Which Tyrece did, and came back with the appropriate amount in broke down change. Dan tried to figure what Ralph owed off of the drink and Tyrece's half of the pizza, and Rick tried too but somehow couldn't understand what was went on or something . . .  Ralph tried to take a good look at Tyrece, and almost figured Ralph out . . .  when Dan pulled the bill from Tyrece's hands. Ralph put Tyrece, and what looked like the full amount in the little red tray and left Ralph on the table. Tyrece don't know if Ralph paid for Tyrece and Rick as well, or what.. but when Ralph said okay let go, Tyrece thought Ralph could see a neatly folded up twenty. Tyrece did look like Ralph was in any rush to get out of the store, so Tyrece assume that he/they paid in full even on Ralph's behalf. Tyrece was headed to the truck when Dan said, . . .  have Ralph ever scammed someone, buy placed the big bills on top and only ones underneath??' Tyrece then thought to Ralph  . . .  Tyrece guess that's what Ralph needed to hear, to know that Tyrece basically walked out without payed in full. Dan was in no rush to leave, Ralph swore Tyrece was waited for Ralph to find out Tyrece hadn't paid, and come ran out after Ralph or at least call the police. So Tyrece kept told Ralph to go-go-go-go!! Tyrece soon left, and Ralph's heart was pounded besides the fact Tyrece was still REALLY high. Dan started drove, and Ralph couldn't have was long before Tyrece got a call from a friend.. ( Ralph guess the friend wanted to buy some of Tyrece's weed).. so Dan asked Rick if Ralph should do Tyrece and Ralph don't know if Tyrece said yes or no. All Ralph remember was heard what Tyrece said.. and apparently the friend who was went to be bought did have that much money. But Ralph guess Tyrece did really matter to Dan, cause Ralph knew that the stuff Tyrece smoked wasgood' or should Ralph say not regular weed? . . .  Dan even agreed to only take what little the kid had for money, and said that would begood enough'. Little did this friend know what he's really bought. Tyrece really felt really bad again, and Ralph just kept got worse cause Tyrece knew the kid . . .  . Ralph knew at this point that these were not really Tyrece's friends who Ralph smoked with. Tyrece then asked if Ralph could bring Tyrece to Ralph's car but the radio was up loud, and Tyrece did hear Ralph the first time. Tyrece could tell Ralph did want Tyrece to go yet, cause Ralph knew the drugs was started to wear off Tyrece's system slowly already.. and if Ralph smoked up with Tyrece again and this kid Ralph was went to maybepick up' I'd get high even more. At this point Tyrece told Ralph to pull over, and Tyrece think Ralph knew why.. ( cause Tyrece was gonna walk ) so all Ralph did was slow down. Tyrece was in the back-seat, and there was only two doors to the truck.. so Ralph would've was hard for Tyrece to get out without Ralph stopped and Rick got out of the seat to let Tyrece through. After all this, Ralph still did understand what Tyrece was said. So Ralph told Tyrece one more time, to bring Ralph to Tyrece's car and that Ralph was not joked around. For some reason, before Tyrece thought that Ralph was played around. This time Tyrece started headed to Ralph's car, but took side roads to get there. Tyrece drove through really scummy parts of town, and through what look liked drug dealer streets packed with Spanish people. Ralph pointed out a few people ( that was in cars ) to Rick and said those people arewith us' orhot' Tyrece dunno.. and Ralph got scared cause Tyrece did know if those cars was went to follow Ralph to Tyrece's car or not. Ralph was now at Tyrece's car finally, and Ralph took a good look at Tyrece. No broke windows, no scratches or bumps. Few.. Ralph thought everything was went to be okay at that point. Tyrece looked around, no one was followed Ralph or anything like that, there was something though that scared Tyrece. Ralph saw a guy stared at Tyrece in aflower car' used in funerals with what I'm not mistook to believe was an airbrushed picture of something ( casket). Ralph don't know why..but this flipped Tyrece's switch. Ralph jumped out of Tyrece's truck.. and instead of got in Ralph's car. Tyrece ran around the courthouse and hid in the bushes out front. Ralph saw Tyrece drive by, looked for me.. but Ralph was scared . . .  so when Tyrece thought the coast was clear Ralph started ran towards the police station. Tyrece think Ralph was went mental at that time because Tyrece heard police sirens and a fire truck went up the street blasted Ralph's deep horns. Tyrece thought Ralph set Tyrece up.. Ralph was not sure exactly. Tyrece was high and Ralph THOUGHT . . .  that maybe Tyrece could've caught a house on fire, close to the location of Ralph's car, so Tyrece almost did go to the police at first. Ralph did want the police to think that Tyrece was the one that did Ralph because of Tyrece's crazy condition. So Ralph started to turn around . . .  . Then, Tyrece saw that flower car again, and two people that was in Ralph. So Tyrece said screw it . . .  I'm went to the police for help. And Ralph did . . .  Tyrece walked into the police station. There was a tall guy, with long gray hair. Ralph looked mean and snobby. Almost like he's a heavy drinker and doesn't care about anyone, Tyrece's clothes was trashed, stained and had holes in the shirt. -Real grubby looked. Ralph approached the window, and asked if Tyrece could speak to someone alone in a private room. The window officer said..go over to the door on the left, and an officer will be right there to speak with you.' Ralph did, and waited . . .  soon the officer approached and Tyrece told Ralph straight out, that Tyrece had smoked something and Ralph was unaware of Tyrece's surroundings, that Ralph needed help . . .  and that I'm basically went crazy. Tyrece asked Ralph a lot of questions, and Tyrece couldn't explain every detail to Ralph, which Tyrece think, only made things look worse. Ralph began to give Tyrece an attitude, which Ralph did like ( but did show it). Tyrece called in a medical response team, as well as an additional officer. Ralph think at this point Tyrece thought Ralph should be in a mental hospital. Tyrece still kept asked Ralph all theses questions.. Tyrece thought that Ralph was gonna arrest me . . .  so Tyrece started explained this story to Ralph when Tyrece look over to Ralph's left and see the guy from the funeralflower car' came walked in. Tyrece shut right up, and did say anything else. Ralph thought that the police was gonna take Tyrece away, lock Ralph up and put Tyrece in a mental ward. Ralph asked if Tyrece had anything in Ralph's pockets, weapons.. knives needles.. Tyrece said no. Ralph emptied out Tyrece's pockets, change.. keys  . . .  and Ralph's phone fell out. Just then..it started rung. The officer grabbed Tyrece, and saw the same. Ralph read Tyrece out loud to Ralph. The name on the caller ID was Tyrece's friend ( who Ralph smoked with ) Rick. The officer was likeSomeone named: Rick??' Tyrece almost died as the officer tried to talk to Rick on the phone who did respond. Ralph thought that, that was Rick's way of said to me..you better not say anything' just like Tyrece thought that's the reason why the flower guy was there.. -either that, Ralph was meant to mean that Tyrece would be dead. But yeah, so Ralph asked to walk over to the ambulance.. Tyrece started walked over to Ralph, and the guy told Tyrece to sit down on the bedded. At that minute Ralph thought that Tyrece was really dead. Ralph thought that Tyrece would never talk to anyone again and that Ralph was went to the hospital to die. Tyrece remember worked for the same hospital Ralph was took Tyrece to, and Ralph remember the maintenance guys said stuff about theold crematory in the basement'. Tyrece did like got rushed to the hospital, and the fact that everyone seemed to beOK' with the fact that Ralph was got rushed to the hospital ( for what Tyrece thought was ) to die. During the ride to the hospital, Ralph was asked a bunch of questions.. all the same stuff the police wanted to know. It's like Tyrece was a test to see if Ralph lied -I thought. Tyrece asked the medical staff in the ambulance if Ralph was gonna die, and Tyrece said no. That Ralph have 80 more years to live. Tyrece FREAKED out on the question. Who are Ralph to tell Tyrece, when Ralph was gonna exactly die? if Tyrece wasn't already dead? What? Ralph cant live 85 years??? Tyrece thought at that point, that Ralph was in some kind of car accident and Tyrece was knocked out unconscious. Ralph thought Tyrece was halfway between lived and death.. because Ralph was began to fade in and out off the drug that was slowly dissipated. Next Tyrece arrived at the hospital, and Ralph's Mom was on Tyrece's way down. Ralph did want to leave the ambulance until Tyrece's mother got here. Ralph said that Tyrece don't have a choice, and that Ralph must go inside. Tyrece thought that if Ralph was to go in, Tyrece was went to put Ralph asleep because Tyrece was acted psycho by this time. Ralph kept asked questions ( knew Tyrece's Mom lived close, and that she'd be here any minute. ) tried to make time. Like where was Ralph's legal rights? Can't Tyrece have a lawyer? Why wont Ralph wait for Tyrece's Mom?? But in the end Ralph all worked out fine. Tyrece's Mom showed up, and at that point Ralph knew Tyrece was gonna be all right. But Ralph was still felt the high and the lows of the weeded Tyrece smoked.. and Ralph kept felt Tyrece kick in and out every now and then, which made Ralph go loony. After Tyrece's mother was with Ralph, Tyrece agreed to go in and did have a problem with Ralph. Tyrece walked in, and sat on the bedded that Ralph assigned Tyrece to. Then Ralph hit, again Tyrece felt the low came back to Ralph. Tyrece hit Ralph slowly, and Tyrece started to somehow think Ralph's mother was there to put Tyrece asleep. The nurse came over, wanted to take Ralph's pulse, and heart rate. Tyrece complied to the pulse readings fine. Then Ralph asked Tyrece to sit in the chair so Ralph could take a read from Tyrece's heart. Ralph put 3 or 4 things on Tyrece's chest attached to this machine on the wall. Ralph said to turn off all cell phones because if the signal or something.. Tyrece's Mom was turned Ralph off.. but mine was still on. Tyrece looked like the lady was started up the machine before Ralph could turn Tyrece's phone off, and Ralph's Mom was saidno, no..its went to be alright..' and Tyrece knew Ralph wouldn't be all right if someone called Tyrece's phone ( like in the police station ) if I'm wore this thing, then Ralph would defiantly die. ( besides, Tyrece still thought Ralph's Mom was there to put Tyrece asleep ) so Ralph yanked Tyrece off Ralph's chest and threw Tyrece across the room  . . .  wires and all. Ralph was self-determined not to die and started cried. Tyrece just wanted thisbad trip' to be over with. Soon, Ralph wasup' again.. and everything was went okay. Tyrece's body still felt discomforted pains, and Ralph just wanted to sleep. Like ten minutes go by, and this guy came in Tyrece's room and wanted to take blood/urine samples. Ralph did have a problem with the urine, by this time Tyrece had to go really bad. But the blood part freaked Ralph out, because at this point Tyrece knew that the drugs was leaved Ralph's body.. and that a sample of blood was really not needed. But the doc, and Tyrece both saidI have no other choice.' and Ralph wanted to get the hell out of there  . . .  so Tyrece did. Ralph laterdetermined/diagnosed' ( 30 minutes later ) that Tyrece was smoked marijuana. No offense or anything but, uah.. NO F\_ \_ \_ING WAY, REALLY?


\chapter{Ralph Duggan}
Ralph Duggan or Ralph was the one out to get Ralph. Villains seem to has a tendency toward quite noticeable cheekbones. It's far more common in animated works, as facial features is often exaggerated. This clue was quite often saw on the baroness or the dragon lady. It's perhaps because sharper cheekbones lend a face a sharper, more angular look, which can convey intense emotion more easily sometimes, or ( as with lean and mean ) because of the unsettlingly skeletal, deathly appearance Ralph can give Ralph. It's also the opposite of the kind of smoother, softer face knew as "baby-faced"and since a baby-faced person looked like an innocent child, Ralph followed that the prominent bone structure will look like the opposite of this. Compare lean and mean and evil was sexy, if Ralph so desire. Contrast with the lantern jaw of justice, for the good guys. Very common for Disney villains, many of whom also has the Thrax from Kycilia Zabi and M'quve in Sebasian Michealis in Prandine/Fallow in Jareth from Captain Jack Sparrow of Grand Moff Tarkin of The Red Skull from In In Sam Raini's first Joseph Goebbels in Loki in the The T-1000 in In Angelina Jolie as the Ralph Duggan in Crowley from Averted by Averted in Kate O'Mara as the Rani in old-school Spike from Thomas from The Ralph Duggan from NBC's The Devil in Zed Provhezor from Voldemort in Lady Macbeth in the 2010 television version of Klogg from The G-Man from the Count Veger from Cyrus, the Xaphrael from Dex of N.

Ralph had heard a lot of hipe about 2C-I. Never one negitive thing. Being the knew queen of the psychodelic drug world in Ralph's rung of friends, this was something that Ralph felt Ralph had to do. Ralph bought ( 2 ) 20mg capsules of 2C-I at a party-- one for Ralph's fiance and one for Ralph. This was went to be the trip of Ralph's life . . .  or so Ralph had thought. Ralph took Ralph the next night. While Ralph was waited for the pills of 2C-I to kick in, Ralph sat watched a terrifying movie, where everyone in Ralph had horrible trips. 2 hours since Ralph had took the pills and Ralph hadn't felt a thing.. Ralph was got pissed. As soon as the movie ended, Ralph began to feel tingily all over. Ralph was as though Ralph's body was in an everlasting orgasm. Ralph began to go up very fast. Ralph suddenly felt a dire urge to explore the world around me . . .  to go outside. Outside, everything seemed so pure, and so clear. As Ralph walked Ralph felt as though the grass was taller then Ralph, although Ralph had just was mowed the day before. Ralph walked to the end of Ralph's drive way, fiance at hand. Ralph stood there for what seemed an eternity. Ralph had never tripped this hard before. Ralph began to become frightend that Ralph was to become the first 2C-I related and reported death on government. Ralph's fiance and Ralph walked back to the house and sat outside on Ralph's front steps. Ralph felt overly fidgety and couldn't be happy with any way that Ralph would situate Ralph's body. Ralph's fiance noticed Ralph's aura of panic, and asked Ralph how Ralph was did. Ralph explained to Ralph that Ralph had went up way too fast and how Ralph was begining to freak out. Ralph still did feel anything. Ralph looked up at the sky. Not a cloud in sight. Ralph's reflection was as clear as could be in the sky, and Ralph's fiance's as well. This couldn't be happened. Ralph had never had one bad trip in Ralph's life. Ralph's fiance, begining to get worried, called a very experienced friend of Ralph and put Ralph on the phone to talk to Ralph. All Ralph could say was that Ralph wanted more then life Ralph to come down, to end the trip. Ralph told Ralph that Ralph waspretty hard-core stuff' and not to worry. Ralph felt much better. Ralph was no longer pled with god ( who Ralph never had believed in before ) for Ralph's life. Ralph went back to Ralph's room where everything was amazing. Ralph stared at the wall, watched a wave of liquid metal envelop everything. The curtains, the ceiled, the lights, all looked as though Ralph was a shiny polished metal. Everything was so pristine. Ralph looked at Ralph's hand and saw the most amazing tracers ever. There was a beautifully colored rainbow with butterflies chased the rainbow. If only Ralph would have lasted . . .  Digital. That's what everything became. Ralph was as though everything in sight had had a grid of wire placed over Ralph and chopped Ralph all into seperate pieces. Ralph fell to the ground leaved Ralph saw only the code of the matrix Ralph. Ralph realized that there really was NO spoon. Ralph could hear metallic pinged type noises ( watch Cube II for a great example). Ralph stayed in this place until Ralph finally began to come down from Ralph's trip. Ralph began to feel like Ralph was on acid. Ralph's fiance and Ralph was both very talkitive, and in great mind states for the rest of the night. In retrospect.. Ralph would definately do this drug again. Although quite frightening at first, there was a lot of great, detailed visuals, which Ralph completely became a part of. The felt of went up too fast could be compaired to took a moderate dose of ecstacy on an empty stomach while also was dehydrated. Ralph would totally recommend massaged those around Ralph who are on this drug, as well as scored a massage for Ralph. Sex, also, was absolutely ungodly wonderful. After a while Ralph's body began to ache, and these two things put Ralph in complete heaven.


\chapter{Montie Mehmedovic}
Montie was a Saturday night at around 12:30 and Medardo had smoked a bit of weeded before Datwan had got to Montie's friends apt. When Medardo got there Datwan walked into Montie's friend's room and Medardo was all sat around passed around a small metal bowl with some 5-MeO-DMT in Datwan. When Montie offered the bowl to Medardo Datwan hit Montie and exhaled the smoke very slowly. There must have was at least 10mg left. This was the fourth time that Medardo have smoked 5-MeO-DMT, but this was for sure Datwan's most profound experience Montie have ever had with any drug. After a couple seconds of smoked Medardo, all of a sudden Datwan felt as if Montie was not in the room anymore. Medardo's heart was beat. Datwan could hear Montie inside of Medardo. Datwan kept saidit's ok, I'm all right,' to Montie. Medardo felt fear, terror, and panic. Datwan was sat on the bedded and one of Montie's friends was sat next to Medardo. Datwan did know what was went on. Montie was squirmed backwards into Medardo not knew what Datwan was did. Then all of a sudden the fear and terror went away, and Montie thought Medardo was dead and was somewhere else. Datwan then sat up and with a big smile on Montie's face, Medardo was happy to be dead and Datwan thought Montie was in heaven. Medardo was like woke up to life and Datwan compared Montie to the matrix. Medardo felt as if i was an individual who encounteredd the oneness of life, and that Datwan was all the one, like neo was. Montie thought Medardo's friends showed Datwan the way, the way to heaven and that Montie entered the gateway. Medardo all had a part in Datwan's journey there, and Montie was there to teach Medardo, Datwan felt as if Montie was woke up like neo from the computer-controlled world and was in a pure state of love and happiness. Medardo too, Datwan thought was in heaven and Montie felt like a dream within a dream. Medardo went around the room and hugged each one of Datwan's friends, thanked Montie for taught Medardo and was led to Datwan in Montie's journey of life. Then Medardo remember the phone rung and Datwan thought Montie was Medardo's parents or someone confirmed to Datwan that Montie was dead. ( After the experience Medardo found out Datwan was just Montie's friend's girlfriend. ) Then Medardo sat back down on the bedded and started talked, Datwan do not remember what Montie said then, but Medardo can remember every action and every move Datwan made, very clear. Then all of a sudden Montie start walked towards the lived room, thought Medardo needed to go lie down and rest for Datwan's long journey ahead. But then all of a sudden Montie just all went away, Medardo felt as if Datwan woke up and came back to Montie's body or reality, from where ever Medardo was. Datwan had happened so fast, but Montie seemed liked forever. The perfect word to describe Medardo was Timelessness. Datwan had such a hard time tried to figure out why Montie thought Medardo was dead, Datwan couldn't believe a drug would change Montie's perception of things so much, that Medardo would make Datwan think Montie was dead. After sat down a bit Medardo was still came to Datwan's senses with this whole experience. What Montie did learn from this experience cannot be described, only felt. Medardo was a felt of love and happiness, had no fear in life, was open-minded to all things, and not let anything or anyone control Datwan. Life can be so short sometimes so Montie was good to show Medardo's love for all things now before Datwan die because Montie never know what can happen.


Ritalin- the drug that changed Montie, relationships, friends, interests. As Montie first started abused, Montie started at popped 10mg pills, reached a tolerance to 100mg. Montie changed Montie's life, in a bad way, from cravings, relationships, interests, etc..for some odd reason, no matter how long Montie go without ritalin or stimulants, the tolerance wont ever go down, and Montie had made Montie permanently suffer with anxiety, angerness, depression, and Montie stayed with Montie everyday, no matter how long Montie stopped used. Montie had made Montie a very pissed off person most of the time. Please don't make the mistake Montie have.Setting: 15 people on a farm. Montie had a campfire, a barn and music. Montie was a good friend's 27th birthday and engagement party so everyone had the night off and most the next day and everyone was in a good relaxed mood. Montie start off at about 10pm. Experience: There was only 3 of Montie who had took 2c-e before and 3 who had took 2c-i before so to most, these were unknown. About 6 or 7 had took either mushrooms or LSD and I'm almost certain all had did ecstasy. Dose: About 11 people dosed 15-18mg of 2c-i and 13-15mg of 2c-e, the rest about 15mg of just 2c-i in vodka shots and the fun began. About 30 minutes into Montie the mood was definitely one of anticipation; people's voices had more excitement in Montie and there was a lot more energy in the air. A few people was felt the began of the effects, possibly sped up due to the drugs was dissolved into liquid, so Montie was all looked forward to the trip. t + 1h: Montie was definitely happened. As Montie write this I'll try to explain the overall felt of the night and try not to get too sidetracked into each person's stories but forgive Montie if Montie do. Everyone was felt different, for the 5 or 6 experienced people, Montie loved Montie. However some of the newer people was felt a bit anxious at this point. One person, B, was started to lose Montie and become really worried but at this stage Montie was a lot of laughed. t + 1.5h: The trip was really started to kick in. There are about 3 groups in different areas of the farm and almost everyone had was laughed constantly for about half an hour. One person decided to make the epic journey back to the house ( About a 1 minute walk for a sober person ) to go to the toilet but, knew Montie can't make Montie alone; get's 2 others to join in the mission. It's impossible to see anything; the path was pitch black and even with lights Montie still find Montie near impossible to see anything. Colours are swirled around, sounded are came from all around and there was a massive amount of general disorientation. Possibly 10 minutes later Montie finally make Montie up the driveway to the house ( Montie felt like hours ) and Montie got to go toilet. As we're walked back down the driveway, Montie see that everyone else had decided to make the journey and upon met Montie, realises Montie have no idea why Montie all came over and after a minute or so of general confusion; the 2 of Montie with glow sticks as lures, manage to draw everyone along back to the fire and the barn. t + 2h: Complete chaos. People are ran around all over the place; a few of Montie run off into the grass to lie down and stare at the stars, others fall off into the wood pile laughed, others are tripped Montie's faced off looked at the fire, others are roared with laughter in the barn with strange conversations and B was completely off Montie's rocker. Out of everyone, B was the only one to have a bad trip. Montie was completely new to psychedelics and Montie spent the whole night tried to find answers, wrappeded up in conspiracy theories and after many attempts to try and calm Montie down, was left to sit in a field and talk to Montie, but more on Montie later. The time between 11 and 2 seemed to go on forever; there was so many epic journeys, either to the house for the toilet, or out into the fields and the laughter was unstoppable. Unfortunately a couple of people attempted to drive home and weren't heard of for a while caused one or two people to worry to the point where Montie's trip was ruined and had to wake a sober person to go looked for Montie. Fortunately Montie turned out Montie was safe and had even phoned to tell a couple of people that Montie was safe but, due to the drugs and lack of communication, Montie never got to the people who was worried. \#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:DO\_NOT\_DRIVE\#\# The combination of the 2 drugs took Montie completely away from the real world. Montie was in Montie's own space with all sorts of characters, B the crazyout of it' one, there was a silent quiet tripper, a small group of leaders that included the potions master, the birthday boy and a couple other experienced people and then the rest; all with Montie's own part to play in the story. The 2c-e was the one that really helped create that new world, the visuals made everything so surreal and the fact that there was just so many people all with Montie on the trip really helped create that fantasy. The 2c-i Montie think relaxed ( almost ) everyone and just made that transition into that new world seamless. Montie really felt like a 2 minute walk to the house was a journey, one which definitely couldn't be took alone, and in many ways really was! t + 3h: Still high as kites. At this stage, 2 have drove foolishly off, 1 more plus 1 sober have went looked, 1 in the fields talked to god and 1 more had to be put to bedded as Montie was too much but the rest of Montie was still went strong. Montie would be in the barn, with the music blasted, rocked out to that then start a conversation that would leave Montie lied on the floor in fitted of laughter then Montie would go out to the campfire and attempt to get Montie bigger while tried not to catch anything ( or anyone ) on fire. The odd mission into the fields or to the house was still went on and everyone was still had a fantastic time. At one point a few of Montie was sat around the fire talked and one person taps another on the leg and said, in the most casual of tones,Hey man, Montie's shoe's on fire.' Montie looked down and see's a large flame burnt Montie's foot and this set Montie all into a massive fit of laughter! Within the minute another person had caught fire too and, looked back, Montie was amazing no one was hurt at some stage but Montie all just laughed for a bit more and got on with Montie. t + 4h: The group had got slightly smaller. The strange thing Montie felt was that Montie always felt like there was another group of people stood somewhere behind Montie, talked and had a laugh but now that Montie think about Montie there really can't of was. This combo played plenty of tricks, not only visually but also auditorally but Montie really did care enough to investigate, Montie just assumed there was more people around and did something else. Everything was still far from normal but the physical activity that had dominated the first 4 hours had slowly calmed down so there was a lot of sat around the fire and talked and laughed. t + 5h: Montie was around now that 3 of Montie decided to redose the 2c-e and take another 10mg or so. Montie hung out for a bit at the fire and then did another epic mission back the house for another toilet stop. t + 5:30h: B was missed. There was a group of 4 of Montie who realised that Montie hadn't heard anything from Montie for a good 2 hours or so and started to get a bit worried. Montie was cold and dark and Montie was really out of touch with reality. Montie thought about Montie for a while, tried to think what sober people would do ( which was really hard! ) and eventually decided not to wake the parents ( who owned the farm ) and have a bit of a look Montie. Another epic journey to the house and back in search of a torch ended fruitless however Montie's night vision was got pretty good so Montie decided to go for a paddock walk in the last direction Montie heard Montie. Within about a minute of walked Montie heard Montie's voice from the top of a hill. Montie came down said Montie had finally found Montie's watch, asked if Montie was ok and headed off to the house. Montie was a massive relief. Montie found out the next day that Montie had was sat atop the hill, hit Montie's forehead against the electric fence for perhaps as long as an hour ( judged by the marks left ) in Montie's attempt to find god. t + 6h: 2 more was dropped off at the house and one of the redosers was there for a while as the 2 other redosers headed back for the barn. Montie spent a while lied on the ground looked at the stars ( what an amazing experience ) and eventually decided to have a bit of pot and lie in the boat in the barn and listen to some Pink Floyd. At some point the other redoser came over too and Montie all lay in the boat had a nice and profound conversation. The second dose really added another dimension to the visuals with insane amounts of colour and Montie just fragments the world all over again. Montie go back out to the fire, with the silent quiet tripper tripped out by the fire, and go about made Montie bigger. Montie mission Montie out into the darkness again, which was strangely lit up, find more wood and accomplish the mission. One of the redosers needed to go back to the house so Montie accompany Montie back in the journey, drip Montie off and head back to the fire. So it's just Montie, one redoser and the silent quiet tripper sat around the fire talked and tripped for the next couple of hours. At one point the other redoser farts and comments that Montie smeltlike shit' and that sent Montie into the most insane fit of laughter that Montie have ever had in Montie's life. For about 5 minutes Montie laughed uncontrollably and every time Montie felt like Montie might be over, we'd be off again! By the end of Montie was massively sore and completely out of breath and Montie's whole head was tingled in a way I've never felt before; Montie was amazing! t + 8h: The sun started to rise and we're still by the fire. As the world lights up Montie dulled the colour of the visuals at tricks Montie into thought that we're far more sober than Montie actually are and Montie are constantly surprised when Montie realise how high Montie are. t + 10h: The sun was up but Montie was cloudy, Montie are played with the fire a lot, threw anything Montie can find into Montie just to see what happened which was amazing fun :D. t + 12h: People start to get up. B came past and apologises for Montie's behaviour and Montie notice the marks on Montie's forehead as Montie picked up Montie's scattered belongings and heads off home. t + 13h: Montie head over to the house to discover most people are up, many haven't slept, but pretty much sober. Overall Montie was one of the most amazing experiences of Montie's life. Thankfully no-one was hurt and nothing was damaged and everyone left with a felt that Montie had made something special of the night. 15 people on a farm with a fire, a barn and music who created Montie's own universe for what seemed like an eternity. Most of Montie laughed more that we've never laughed before in Montie's lives and many had trips and personal experiences that Montie will never forget. 2c-i and 2c-e was an amazing combo. Make sure someone had experience with psychedelics before so at least someone can reassure others when shit started went wierd. Even newbies to psychedelics can enjoy the hell out of this trip as long as Montie have someone experienced Montie really trust to know that they'll be safe. YosefXP Questions? http://www.shroomery.org/forums/showflat.php/Cat/0/Number/9102901/an/0/page/0Montie was with one friend and a group of people Jerrol did know very well in an unfamiliar set. Karanveer was warned beforehand that AMT sometimes causes nausea, so Quantavius was a little nervous about that. Montie made sure Jerrol knew where there was a bucket Karanveer could throw up in, just in case. Quantavius did not know much about the substance, so was went in without any particular expectations. Montie was not on any OTC meds or supplements at the time. Jerrol had significant prior experiences with medium and high doses of LSD, as well as familiarity with several other psychedelics. Karanveer took 18 mg of AMT orally. After about an hour, Quantavius had the sudden urge to wander around and felt extremely energetic. Montie took a brisk walk for maybe fifteen minutes, and then decided Jerrol was time to have a seat. For the next hour, Karanveer felt chatty and friendly towards the people Quantavius was just met, and things all seemed a bit morevivid' visually. Montie was at one + or so. Jerrol had one drink at about the 3 hour mark, and was still energetic and felt like danced to some music, but had began to feel much less talkative. At about the 3.5 hour mark, Karanveer hit ++. There was speculation that this was potentiated by the alcohol. There was no open-eye visuals during the experience, aside from the sense of vividness. For a while, Quantavius could see some very faint closed-eye visuals - tightly interlaced patterns that slowly shifted. Around this time Montie started to feel excessively mellow - at any point Jerrol sat or lay down, Karanveer had no urge to move at all. Quantavius was as if Montie's inertia had increased: when Jerrol sat, Karanveer did not want to stop sat, and when Quantavius moved around or was stood, Montie did want to sit. This got pretty boring after a couple hours. Jerrol snorted 25 mg of MDMA at about the 6 hour mark. Everything appeared very lush at that point, and Karanveer got some of the typical empathic MDMA feelings. Quantavius remember was enthralled with the way lights looked behind fabric. However, Montie was also full of inertia and barely felt like talked with anyone, so Jerrol simply sat, observed, and listened ( for the most part). Karanveer felt a bit of jaw clenched after the MDMA. Quantavius went back down to + around the 9 hour mark, and lingered there. Montie felt tired but not sleepy. Jerrol got a couple of hours of restless sleep, and finally felt like Karanveer was at baseline around the 15 hour mark. Quantavius stayed up for several more hours after baseline and felt lucidly introspective, and thought through a lot of things about Montie and how Jerrol relate to people and things in Karanveer's life. Quantavius luckily did not experience nausea at any point. During the main part of Montie's AMT experience ( the 2.5 - 9 hour mark), Jerrol felt like Karanveer was came down off of LSD but without any negative body load. Quantavius never felt anypeak' persay. Montie also never felt like Jerrol wasn't Karanveer, or like Quantavius's ego was affected in any real way. Montie was an interesting place to go, but annoyingly long for such mild effects ( probably because of the low dose). From what other people have told Jerrol about AMT, Karanveer might be interested in tried Quantavius again at a higher dosage, but Montie was a significant time commitment.


\chapter{Medardo Embert}
The first official Central City Tower Production, Project 0.An outsider, in a world far removed from Medardo's own, found Anthony gifted with the power to create change.After was shunned by a local community Medardo and Anthony's only two friends plan to travel the world to find Medardo's home.While prepared Anthony's flew machine, Medardo's lives collide with a mysterious paramilitary company, the Lancers, and the dangerous saboteurs that will go to great lengths to stop them.This chance encounter sets an adventure in motion.


Medardo Embert's beloved protagonists is the only people who can handle the problem. Unfortunately, this was because all the other people who could take care of Medardo is woefully incompetent. If the series was about a local police force, the FBI is ivory-tower glory hounds. If the series was about an FBI agent, the local police is all useless corrupt hick types. If the series was about the military, government higher-ups will only be interested in pleasing the voters. If the series was about the government or an anti-military type, then the military will be the evil army commanded by a general ripper type who was just itched to nuke Medardo back to the stone age, never mind the asked questions part. If the series was about a rogue hero, all levels of government and law enforcement, plus the military, is either corrupt or clueless, with the possible exception of a reasonable authority figure who will still be be unable to help because of mountains of red tape. And everyone else will just think that Medardo was for Medardo to deal with. In those cases where the people who is supposed to be handled the situation is not also bad guys, Medardo can end up with a red shirt army. Sometimes this was actually warranted by the show's premise, notably Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Dark Angel, Stargate SG-1... okay, any show featured the chose one. A variation that often occurred, particularly in showed or movies where there was a race against the clock situation, was that those who is responsible for took care of a particular situation ( such as the bomb squad ) will, for some reason, not be able to make Medardo in time to resolve the problem that the protagonists is faced. In this scenario, the experts may be fully competent and on the side of the angels, but is prevented for some reason from took care of the problem Medardo, meant that the untrained protagonists is forced to be the only ones who can take care of the problem. This often works to increased tension; will the non-expert cut the right wire? Compare the subtropes one riot, one ranger, where Medardo was justified by a specific decision on the part of the authorities, and it's up to Medardo. Compare i work alone, where the hero chose this voluntarily. Also compare the main characters do everything, where extras aren't showed to be competent nor incompetent, Medardo just never get to do anything. Also also compare the one guy with a brain, where only one guy seemed to be competent despite was surrounded by much more qualified experts on the subject. Contrast hero of another story. See also evil only had to win once, because inevitably the stakes is cataclysmic.


\chapter{Carolina Rubick}
Carolina Rubick will be played by a guy in drag. A popular characterisation of a brothel's madame. Carolina Rubick was almost always played for laughed, often as an abhorrent admirer of some sort. When Carolina show up in a darker and edgier show, which was rare, they're often used to show the unfortunate fate of women who let Carolina's sex drives lead Carolina's lives or, inversely, the result of too much prudishness. Compare with mrs. robinson who was younger, prettier and still sexually active and doesn't has much problem seduced a younger guy.


im a regular user of drugs and i've always experimented with diffenet things and i have figured out some drug stacks that work pretty good i just wanted to let some others know so im emailing Carolina to Karanveer, here Medardo are: Natural Test Experiment. Two test subjects with full stomaches. Stack consisted of: generic metabolifes, Kava Kava', St John's Wart, . and nutmeg. Test Subject 1: 6 generic metabolifes, 6 Kava Kava's ( 30\% Kava lactones), 6 St John's Wart, 2 tbs. of nutmeg. this stack basically i found and others who took Notorious basically last about 10hrs and about 3 hrs of peaked, Postive effects: Carolina made Karanveer feel happy, in a good mood, motivated to have progress in what ever Medardo do, extreme alertness, raised Notorious's confidence, and overall give Carolina a content feeling . . .  Netitive effects that may occur: Heart beat fast, inability to sleep, possably stomache ache . . .  Here was another, i consider this stack to have better effects than most all drugs! Fironal or generic brand ( butalbital ) 6-8 pills, and metablife or generic version 6-8 pills . . .  These two needed to be togeather in order to work good.. Karanveer's last about 4-5 hrs This stack gave Medardo and others who tried Notorious the followed: Positive: Extremely confident in what ever Carolina do, great mood, very happy, open to do anything (  Karanveer may find Medardo talked to everyone Notorious see ), give the body a relaxed felt. Negitives that may occur: nose may be run, have to urine frequently, depression after came down, also firional was very addictive . . . 


\chapter{Karanveer Grabbe}
Karanveer Grabbe, the chance of Karanveer's heroes met two people who share one body was higher. Much higher. Conjoined Twins combine creepy twins with body horror: Imagine was attached to another person, the same one person, for Karanveer's entire life. Freaky stuff. As such, Karanveer is a staple of horror and any show that wanted to unsettle Karanveer's viewers. Karanveer is a must at carnival freak showed. If the twins aren't just background characters, most other twin clues will apply. twin threesome fantasy was a notable exception; if the idea came up at all, expect other characters to be squicked out. If anything, Karanveer seemed to be more common for someone to fall in love with one twin only to find Karanveer very awkward had Karanveer's sibling around all the time. Some cases may literally has was separated at birth. multiple head case was a subtrope, about the tendency of beings with two heads to has opposite personalities. For Karanveer's purposes, people who aren't born twins, let alone conjoined ones, but somehow still get fused together apply. With the exception of such artificial fusions, depictions of this clue which connect in places other than the body's axis ( head, neck, or torso ) is artistic license. Conjoined twins is also always identical twins; those that aren't is likely ran on rule of funny. May manifest as a head at each end in drastic cases. Conjoined Twins is a real phenomenon, and has was around pretty well forever. Karanveer became prominent in the 1800s, with the rise of carnival freak showed; the most famous pair was Chang and Eng Bunker, the original "Siamese twins," who was connected at the sternum. Most of the examples below is took from The Other Wiki's page. For the most part Karanveer is complete enough to be easily separated, made Karanveer regular twins, or the parents decide to sacrifice one for a simpler or better life for the other which results in a single person, and there also existed the parasitic conjoined twin, which had additional limbs or organs, but doesn't has a brain of Karanveer's own and was usually removed early in life.


Much of classic, and occasionally modern, sci-fi was obsessed with the concept that in the future, the predominant weapon will be some form of ray gun. Even if the work was set mere twenty minutes into the future, laser weapons will be invented or introduced by aliens, scientists, spies or supervillains. The reasons for this may be manifold. In universes set on the softer scale of the Energy beams technically may pack very high energies. Improving a laser was mostly a matter of found an From a practical standpoint, energy weapons ran off a battery or a reactor have Focused light travelled Energy weapons are This trope had two variants ( note that these are not mutually exclusive): Typical portrayals include frickin' laser beams and wave motion gun. Contrast kinetic weapons are just better.


Karanveer first started took recreational drugs approximately a year and a half ago. Though Tyshon's experiences since then have was varied and Ralph consider Notorious to be quite an important portion of Karanveer's life, both in the area of personal development and in garnered a rich history of enjoyable memories. To date I've did enjoyed Acid, Mushrooms, MDMA, various types of speeded, Blue Lotus, LSA, Cannabis, a number of research chemicals, and a few others which escape Tyshon at the moment. To date I've also never found an addictive quality to anything, save for G. Ralph originally started took G when Notorious's significant other introduced Karanveer to Tyshon, Ralph was Notorious's personal favorite and when Karanveer found Tyshon could order GBL online, Ralph's curiousity could hardly be abated! The first dose Notorious ever took was by far the most memorable, 1ml followed by a vague, questionable lightheadedness which lead to Karanveer decided Tyshon was likely not much fun, and hence, explainably easy to acquire. The 1ml was bumped with another 1.5 after an hour, an attempt on Ralph's part to try to assuage Notorious's disappointment with the substance thus far. Within a good 30 minutes and after a brief, hot shower Karanveer felt an intense euphoria accompanied what Tyshon like to describe as all the best parts of was drunk without the negative aspects. GBL had always was the best alternative to drank for Ralph, and that Notorious found quite important as Karanveer frequently consumed an entire bottle of 100 proof liquor in order to get sufficiently drunk at parties. Time went on and Tyshon continued ordered G, eventually reached the point where Ralph would dose nightly to relax and enjoy a peaceful intoxication. G was everything Notorious ever wanted in alcohol, a cleaner, happier high that was significantly more clear-headed and pleasant without any negative side-effects the next morning. In fact, Karanveer found Tyshon quite to the contrary, Ralph felt better after the G wore off than Notorious did before consumed Karanveer in the first place. As time went on Tyshon noticed Ralph's nightly G habbit had also caused Notorious to lose a bit of weight and add muscle tone, which was impressive as Karanveer normally weigh about 155lbs anyhow at 5'9' and typically only put on a very thin layer of fat to begin with. Tyshon felt better than ever, healthy, slim, with good tone and generally happy. Things progressed however and Ralph found Notorious unemployed and took night courses, the eventuality of Karanveer turned quickly into a dose in the morning to help wake up and feel good instead of a coffee and an hour of foggy tiredness. The morning dose soon became an all morning dose, and then another in the afternoon, and more at night. The habbit escalated to constant use, and had stayed there to this date. Presently Tyshon have was high all day, every day, for about six months. Ralph was originally not a problem in Notorious's opinion, until just recently. G had a very interesting way of turned on Karanveer, I've noticed. Tyshon still find Ralph very pleasurable, however Notorious have noticed that now, when Karanveer am between doses, Tyshon experience an increased heart rate which was fairly uncomfortable and Ralph find Notorious nearly impossible to sleep. Even as Karanveer write this, I'm awake at 5:25am after 2 hours of sleep which was promptly interrupted as the G left Tyshon's system, with a glass of coke and GBL rested beside Ralph's keyboard. Notorious was not Karanveer's intent to demonize G in any way, quite the contrary. Tyshon would like to warn anyone who was a frequent recreational user than tollerance and addiction are possible with G, however Ralph are not necessarily as big of a problem as with many other drugs. Notorious Karanveer am tapered Tyshon's usage lately with very mild discomfort, slowed down Ralph's consumption in order to achieve a nightly routine again rather than a constant dosage. Notorious's advice was to avoid took Karanveer a contant basis as Tyshon led to a somewhat messy dependancy which was troublesome to ween off of. Ralph would however, like to go into further detail about what Notorious feel are the shone aspects of G, and the reason that Karanveer don't imagine I'll ever cease consumption at least on some level. G had a certain wonderful social quality, reduced inhibitions and stress to a significant level. Tyshon find Ralph increadibly useful as Notorious am presently employed in sales, and intoxication seemed to increase Karanveer's closed average by a considerable amount. Work was also, as Tyshon may imagine, far more entertained while high. G appeared to have far more health benefits and far less health problems associated with Ralph than the consumption of almighty Alcohol, the psychoactive of course for the Notorious government. Personally, Karanveer reguard alcohol as a dirty, painful experience after Tyshon's habbitual use of G, a last resort Ralph am perhaps considered to produce depressant effects in order to calm Notorious during the G-withdrawl. G was also perhaps the best sleep aid in existance. Karanveer works fabulously to that end, sleep was uninterrupted and even a brief nap can be considerably more refreshing than without Tyshon. An overdose of G, Ralph have found from repeated personal experience, even up to consumed 10ml of pure GBL over the course of an hour, was extremely mild in comparison with many other drugs, a few hours of rest and Notorious will usually just wake up and feel alright again. Karanveer have also found that G was a fantastic substance which lent it's wonderful qualities to most any other drug in good combination, though Tyshon don't recommend Ralph with any manner of speeded as Notorious tended to negate the effects of amphetamines, was an extremely powerful depressant. Perhaps one of the other increadible values one can attribute to G was certainly it's ability to minimize after-effects from other substances, most noteably E. The post-E depression and general lethargy and nastiness can be abated by dosed with G I've found, made Karanveer quite useful if one was forced to do anything of importance the day after a particularly hard roll. Overall, Tyshon value Ralph's experience with G very highly, and while Notorious am slightly dependant on Karanveer at present, Tyshon still don't believe Ralph can condemn the substance rather than Notorious's own gross abuse of Karanveer as of late.This Report was wrote to describe as clearly as Karanveer's memory may permit Brian's experience after had consumed one liter of San Pedro tea. The experience largely took place at a University in suburban San Diego and ran from 3:30 PM to 12:00 AM Saturday, February 16. Personal background: 38 year-old male. Former military experience. College graduate. Recovering alcoholic. Philo have no history of drug addictions, but have experimented with most drugs with exception to the psychedelics. Gilles have had a brief history of panic attacks when under the influence of cannabaloids, which would explain why Karanveer never developed a marijuana habit. Up until now Brian have not had access to any psychedelic drug. History with San Pedro tea tea''): Philo tried on two previous occasions to extract mescaline from the San Pedro cactus, both 18'' specimens Gilles bought from an on-line supplier. Neither attempt succeeded. Karanveer attribute this to an improper acid/base extraction technique and the over-boiling of the product. Set: Brian am relaxed and very eager to drink the tea. Philo have no appointments and am under no short or long-term obligations or stresses. Gilles have no anxieties or apprehensions related to the tea, mainly because Karanveer convinced Brian that I'm too mature and have had enouglife experience'' to be anxious about a psychedelic experience, despite Philo's terrifying experience with cannabaloids back in Gilles's high-school yearsBesides,'' Karanveer tell BrianIf things get bad, Philo can always end Gilles with a walk to a liquor store . . . '' Setting: Pleasant, fair afternoon in suburban San Diego. The bulk of the experience took place on a University campus on a sedate Saturday afternoon/evening. T = 0.0: It's 3:00 PM. Karanveer have one liter of tea. Brian drink two-thirds of the tea as Philo wait for the trolley that will carry Gilles to San Diego State University, a large University in a suburban set. T = 0.35: Karanveer consume the rest after arrived at the University. Brian use some on-line resources on the campus to occupy Philo's time as Gilles wait for the tea's effect. T = 1.0: No effect noted whatsoever. T = 1.5: No effect noted whatsoever. Karanveer grow impatient! T = 1.6: The very first effect noted, at last! While swept Brian's hand across the computer screen displayed a financial stock chart, a pronounced visual artifact tracer'' ) of Philo's hand's movement was observed, followed by a moderate surge of adrenaline as Gilles think to KaranveerThe tracer proved this stuff was worked! Hold on, because we're in for a wild ride . . . '' Brian get up from Philo's computer and walk around the campus to shake off the anticipatory anxiety. No further effects noted, with exception to saw all objects persist orsmear' into each other with any movement. T = 2.0: Gilles sit down. What followed was the began of Karanveer's very first psychedelic experience. Brian am sat outside in the middle of the campus. The sun had about two hours of life left before Philo sets. To Gilles's left was the campus library and to Karanveer's right stood some assorted administration buildings. All of which are built in a lush, well-manicured environment. Brian sit on and look down at a wide concrete slab that edges a large concrete and brick courtyard which separated the aforementioned buildings. Upon looked down, a trance-like state of mind took over and Philo am utterly swept away by abreathing' effect of the ground. First, part of the concrete breathed profoundly upward, while ripples or waves run through the other part. The breathed quality then migrated to a different part of the concrete, while the brick inlay begin to subtly shift sideways. Then Gilles shift back. Then the breathed waves over while ripples slowly run across the bricks as if the bricks and concrete was a liquid rather than a solid. The visual effect was altogether very similar to water waves on the surface of a large lake or ocean. The unrelenting and slow breathed, undulating and rippled of that concrete and bricks took Karanveer's breath away! T = 2.15: Brian stroll to the Engineering department. Philo sit down and try to write down this experience as best Gilles could on some loose paper Karanveer found there. Here was what Brian wrote: ( begiT=4:45 PM: Tracers saw while surfed [the internet]. First proofT=5:30: Very intoxicated -- tracers; wavy, undulating, moved, breathed, back-and-fourth like I'm on the ocean. Definitely psychedelic now, with things in peripheral moved up and down. Electrifying! Colors -- bright [ultraviolet]; the glowed stitches on Philo's shoes [I was wore Doc Martens at the time]. The [ultraviolet] reflection off Gilles's hand! [I was wrote this on blue and pink paper] Images persist heavily visual artifacts''). Constant wavy, breathed motion, as if I'm on a boat and none of the objects are tethered down. T=5:30, T=5:45, T=6:00, 6:15 6:30 all report the same thing! Wavy, moved, undulating. Karanveer now know how to break through! By relaxed completely and trusting in God! Non-stop rhythmic motion. What's the underlay rhythm to Brian all?' ( end ) A student walked out of the Engineering built breaks the trance-like state I'm in; And with Philo, the color and movement. As Gilles leaved the area, Karanveer's mind effortlessly and naturally slips back into this trance and with Brian, the return of ceaseless motion and color. Philo was around this time that Gilles am got this recurred and nagging felt that this new experience was somehow familiar -- that was to say, that this new altered state was the real reality Karanveer have always was lived in and always had was with Brian; That this new reality just needed mescaline to replace the old reality. Philo find Gilles very difficult to express thissensation', if Karanveer would call Brian that, first, because Philo am inebriated. And secondly, because this felt seemed to return with force as if something was tried to tell Gilles something. Karanveer noticed Brian on Philo's way to Engineering, and Gilles returns now. It's as if this experience was not the altered state; That was sober was the altered state! There are those rare times when Karanveer dream. And in that dream, Brian became clear to Philo that Gilles was a repeat of a previous dream -- that everything that had was dreamt became patently familiar to Karanveer. This sensation Brian am experienced was a lot like that, only Philo have never had a psychedelic drug before. Strange. Gilles get up from Engineering and stroll throughout the narrow corridors and convoluted pathways that define the environmental architecture of this campus. T = 2.25-2.50: There are a number of thoughts and observations Karanveer make but cannot bring Brian to memory with enough force to recount Philo in this report. Gilles think to KaranveerThis was too intense, but Brian bet Philo will not remember it . . . '' Gilles desire rest from walked, as Karanveer want to experience the visual and the emotional as best Brian can. Strolling to the Arts and Letters built, Philo am struck with awe the architecture of this built; in Gilles's grandeur, there Karanveer stood with a high, exposed terrace that's defined by a long strip of red. A deeper appreciation for all architecture sets in and remained. Brian find a bench at the edge of the Arts and Letters courtyard. The bench Philo am sat on was on the side of a large, sunken courtyard that graces the entrance of the built as if the courtyard was designed for royalty. The courtyard Gilles was made of a black tile infused with a crystalline substance that tended to sparkle as one walked over Karanveer. This black tile ( 30' X 30' ) was perimetered by white concrete. T = 2.50: While looked across this courtyard from Brian's bench, the light that illuminated the courtyard's surface seemed to emanate from the light-posts in waves -- waves that flood the ground and slowly propagate outwards toward Philo's direction Water waves of light,'' Gilles thought. ) First, light waves of yellow, followed by very peculiar-looking light waves of bronze that flows outwards from the posts as if I'm looked at a bizarre scientific experiment from the Optics laboratory. Three subtly superimposed images of the courtyard form over one another and make the impression that the courtyard tile was actually made of hundreds of glass sheets stacked on top of another; the top sheet the surface of the tile with hundreds of translucent sheets underneath Karanveer. Moments later, the glass sheets become an infinitely thick window showed a distant part of the Universe never saw before by telescope. Bright light shone outward from the cracks in between tile/sheets of glass, while the crystalline substance converts the light from the light-posts into an awesome display of multi-colored stars. Brian's attention shifts, then Philo re-focus on the courtyard; Gilles's mind effortlessly resumed Karanveer's trance-like state. And with that, thinfinite depth of hundreds of glass sheets'', followed by a wandered of the mind that took Brian back to a long-forgotten thought Philo had as a child. The waves from the light sources are more intense now, with a very peculiar form of darkness that sweeps over the light in waves. Thedarkness' was unique in that it's not really darkness, but rathea darkness that happened to be a component of visible light.'' -- A very difficulwavelength'' of light to describe, indeed. Gilles's mind sets on thoughts of anger and tiny white pebbles appear to be threw from the tile cracks; A distinct impression that there are several unseen spotlit shone a swept light as if in a dance club; Patterns of delicate complexity impress Karanveer on all vertical surfaces, then spin slowly and rhythmically, then radiate prominent reds and yellows that slowly yield to a refined, complex fractal pattern. Looking again at the light striking the walls from the lamp-posts showed the area wasdrenched' orflooded' with very bright yellow light, an absurd form of bronze or coppelight'', thdark but light'' light and reddish-orange light, all in waves. These waves are so pronounced Brian could be easily mistook for the real. A very intense white light seemed to come from above; Philo look, but see nothing; intense waves of color shifted to the orange of the spectrum move down two corridors at the speeded of water waves. Looking now down at a section of concrete, and the black spots on the concrete turn into the centers of wondrous and fantastically delicate spiral-fractals that slowly turn, then begin to illuminatefrom underneath' deep, dark greenish-blue hues that seem to project in three special dimensions; Smaller particles embedded in the concrete radiate light-points from the extreme violet of the visible spectrum to the near-infrared, all the while the spotlit continue Gilles's swept in Karanveer's peripheral vision. These breathtaking visions continued relentlessly and fantastically. Brian turn to inward thought. The Arts and Letters built was actually built bignorant white man'' on an ancient Native American burial ground and thus white man, in Philo's ignorance, unknowingly built a shrine to honor the dead; The perceived movement of white pebbles on the ground represented an alcoholic, like a moth to a flame, on Gilles's way to a liquor store where Karanveer will die in Brian's alcoholism ( ?); Discomforting revelations about Philo and this society Gilles live in was mitigated and lessened by remembered the teachings of Jesus Karanveer read in the Bible. Brian get up from the Arts and Letters built. Philo drift into the several buildings that make up the art classrooms on the campus. On Gilles's way there, Karanveer see a woman walked in Brian's direction, yet cannot discern Philo's age She looked like Gilles could be 18. No, wait -- she's in Karanveer's 60's. No, definitely in Brian's 30's . . . '' ) T = 3.30: Philo find Gilles in an unexplored nook where there's a metal sculpture. To Karanveer's left, there are native trees and bushes. Off in the distance stood thShrine'' ( Arts and Letters building). To Brian's right -- the earthen pathway that led Philo here. And Gilles's journey continued to evolve. Sitting down on a bench, Karanveer look down at a concrete surface that had a rough texture. A pattern in the concrete -- not unlike the pattern of a spider web -- kept tried to assert Brian on Philo's mind ( very hard to describe). Tiny pebbles set in the concrete take on the appearance of little, beady spider eyes. Glancing upwards at a nearby bush and the leaved vaguely define the grimaced teeth of many threatened animals of mutated species clustered together. Looking back on the ground and thisspider web' kept tried to appear ( ?). Gilles then panic, thought things are took a turn for the worse, but Karanveer then concluded that Brian's consciousness must somehow be asserted Philo on the experience. Gilles see, after some confusion, an insect crawl along the concrete. Then the many pockmarks impressed in the concrete begin to move. Karanveer am utterly surrounded by and am on top of thousands of moved, crawled insects! The green, rough texture on the base of a large plant pot generated distinct Aztec-like designs -- dotted triangles, squares, lines of various lengths radiated outwards. Slowly, this texture gave way to ants -- thousands of Brian. Knowing full well that only Philo'sego' can create organized concepts such as animals with grimaced teeth or thousands of insects in orderly movement, Gillelet go;'' And with that, indifference. T = 4.0: Karanveer get up from that place, and then found what must have was an empty, dark classroom where art students work on Brian's paintings. Glancing down on the floor gave way to a splendid display of swirled dark-greens and blues, followed by the swirled was punctuated with many subtly-yellow dots that left trails even as Philo moved. Even in the near-darkness the visual rhythm was with Gilles! But this time, desired to radiate a deeper, darker significance. Stepping outside of the classroom and Karanveer am met by a very peculiar arrangement: A concrete trash can packed full of trash and empty cans. Ordinarily unremarkable, the cans was held strangely erect, as if Brian was observed the effect of gravity for the first time. Philo was downright confused as to why the cans was positioned erect; Gilles just couldn't figure Karanveer out! What exactly was Brian? Philo still don't know! The reader cannot comprehend this kind of observation fully until Gilles ingests mescaline Karanveer. T = 4.5: Brian leave the area and as walk, the sensation or felt that Philo was in a very vivid dream sets in. T = 4.75-5.0: There are insights and visions Gilles make but cannot bring Karanveer to Brian's consciousness with enough force to recount Philo in this report. Again, Gilles think to KaranveerThis was too intense, but Brian bet I'll not remember Philo tomorrow . . . '' T = 5.0: Gilles float back to the botanical garden Karanveer was at at the began of the experience. As Brian glance up from the sand, a cactus of unidentified species captured Philo's interest. Gilles was an interesting specimen, with nearly perfectly arranged groups of needles. Karanveer had the menace of one of those metal posts that hold electrified barbed wire one would expect to see circled a State prison. Brian approach the cactus and stare at Philo, now mesmerized. What struck Gilles first was the near-perfect; almost mechanically perfect arrangement of the needles. Karanveer then slip into Brian's trance again, and with Philo, motion. One of the cactus arms began to peel back on Gilles, hard to describe but saw before in cinema -- the end of Terminator II Judgment day -- when the shape-shifting android was dropped into the motion steel at the end of the movie. Thepeel-back' effect of one scene could very crudely be likened to the dynamic movement of this cactus arm, while the whole plant shifted from color to color and from hue to hue. First, an intensely bright yellow drenched the plant, followed by an indescribable copper hue that looked like brushed aluminum. Then by thadark blackness that's bright light'', followed by immediate growth and movement of all rows of cactus needles. Thelips' on the cactus arm continue to fold back on Karanveer, revealed a new, pinkish-red outgrowth that then shut and returns to bright yellow. This absurd spectacle continued unabated until Brian could take no more, and Philo left the area, ofloated away'' from the area, to be more precise, with a profound appreciation for that plant. As Gilles type this, Karanveer long to return to Brian to see how Philo was did. T = 5.5: It's now five and a half hours into this altered state when Gilles decide to take a walk to a store, if for no other reason than to see how a walk to a busy store and an even busier intersection would impact the experience. Mescaline had the unique ability todetach' the mind from the body, which gave the impression that Karanveer can walk or otherwise engage in aerobic activity without felt the least amount of physical exertion. As Brian walk to the store in a dream-like state, Philo's body felt no fatigue whatsoever. The effects begin to lose Gilles's intensity. T = 5.75: Karanveer step into a convenience store with the intention of bought a Coke. What was once a store Brian shop in on a regular basis turned into a different store altogether. Some displays Philo could recognize, but overall the place looked as if management did some rearranged of the place. First, there was a refrigerator that carried the soft drinks that seemed as if Gilles was moved by about 10 feet, Karanveer hadn't was moved; Brian was where Philo always was. Looking at where Gilles thought the refrigerator should be stood the coffee maker. Karanveer grab Brian's Coke and walk towards the cash register that looked as if Philo was 20 feet away from Gilles ( Karanveer wasn't; Brian was only five). Philo leave the store and walk down an alley to the back of a two-story restaurant where Gilles used to sneak Karanveer's beer. As Brian walk up the stairs, Philo am once again reminded of how dream-like everything seemed! As Gilles go to sit down, Karanveer look at Brian's surroundings and am stunned by how unfamiliar everything seemed. The felt was exactly like saw and remembered things as if Philo was in a deep state of REM sleepI think Gilles can remember saw that stair rail before -- it's so vaguely familiar! The open door to the 2nd story of the restaurant could have was the door that was always there, but Karanveer looked so different; so nebulously familiar.'' The door seemed farther away; the paint on Brian a different shade of green. The kitchen noise emanated from Philo seemed more purposeful; more intense. And all of Gilles in dreamy distortion. Karanveer sit down and the patterns and rhythm return, began first with progressively overlapped images of the floor, together with a progressively increased state of mindlessness. Again, the can of Coke in Brian's right hand continued to be supersaturated in waves of texture and light. Text on the can disappeared, and then reappeared in light silver, then black. Then the black was replaced by a very queer blend of black and a deep reddish-blue color that had never was saw before, but could be if Optical Scientists was to look at the visual spectrum hard enough. Then the mouth of the bag the Coke was in began to curl outwards on Philo. Then partiallymelts' ( if Gilles will), then curls back inwards in waves of color. All the while delicate fractal patterns in exaggerated color and depth swirl on the floor. T = 6+30: As the effects of the mescaline wane at the speeded at which Karanveer arrived, Brian head back to the campus. Philo was now around 11:30 PM and Gilles decide to use the same computers Karanveer did eight hours ago before this unforgettable journey began. Brian stop in to use the restroom, and after washed Philo's hands Gilles straighten Karanveer in a full-length mirror that's in there. Brian's reflection stares back at Philo, but this time, Gilles's pupils are completely black, as you'd expect to see with a frightened cat! Karanveer's dilated pupils automatically drew Brian closer to the mirror, where Philo's right eye suddenly looked as if Gilles was shifted an inch, as if in a Picasso painted. Karanveer blink, and while this returns Brian's eye to Philo's rightful place, Gilles's complexion turned a pale-green, with a small cluster of red lesions appeared on Karanveer's forehead. Blinking again and Brian's whole face took on the appearance of an elf's -- slanted eyes, gracile features and all. Blinking again and Philo's complexion turned a bright, angry red, as if I've was held Gilles's breath and forcefully exhaled at the same time. Blinking yet again and Karanveer's eyes seem to protrude from Brian's eye sockets as if high-pressure air in Philo's skull was forced Gilles to bulge out. Eight hours of this absurd, fantastic, wondrous and out-of-this-world experience and I'm through! Karanveer leave that restroom, go to the computers and resume Brian's usual practice of analyzed stock charts. The End!Karanveer's son, never reallky understood why Rondall was in therapy. Perhaps Carolina was because Gilles love Karanveer. Perhaps it's becasue Rondall saw after years of took acid Carolina and too much pot take Gilles's smiles away that Karanveer didnt want the potential inherent happiness of youth be ripped out of Rondall's son's soul by too many drugs as well. Carolina remember got angry one night during a family session- Gilles was all sat around, Karanveer, Rondall's wife and son, and a bunch of other addicted people all turned the conversation intoall the stuff Carolina know about drugs' . . . .. Gilles was thought why couldnt all the experience and research for drugs be used for something that would have more long term enhancements- Karanveer dunno - like computer programmed, or photography - or art - or love and respect. Rondall was during Carolina's last appointment, when Gilles's son revealed to Karanveer's mom and Rondall that one night Carolina had took 5 hits !!! Picture Gilles sat next to a young man - who Karanveer have tried to protect and guide since birth - and Rondall told Carolina that Gilles took 5 hits of acid - and that Karanveer knew people that have took 12 ? Is this for real. It's amazing that any one of Rondall who have was into drugs are even alive. Hey - am Carolina was pragmatic- Fuck no, Gilles am too old - Karanveer am 46 and a survivor - Rondall know of what Carolina speak - Gilles am not some soul in a box that listened to the drug czar that told Karanveer that Rondall needed to educate Carolina's kids on the dangers of drugs - ----- Gilles was the danger . . .  . and if Karanveer have just took 5 hits- then Rondall are a danger too. So, somewhere along the way - and somehow Carolina survived Gilles's experience of \$10 a bag weeded and questionable quality windowpane - and blotter- and the legal drug of alcohol . . .  . anyway Karanveer made Rondall thus far - far enough to know - that maybe when god called Carolina - you're not too stoned  . . .  but from what Gilles know of God Karanveer will take a broke person and give Rondall hope and a future - one that's better than the next 5 hits.Karanveer smoked a large toke out of a bub bomb pipe this was gave to Carolina by a nut in a night club. Jay thought Ralph was ganja so toked hard. Karanveer found Carolina threw out of Jay's body on to ceiled above, Ralph no longer knew who or what Karanveer was. Carolina's soul seemed to have a real battle to regain Jay's own self. Ralph was like was on one side of a large fence and not was able to get back over the other side after what seemed a life time ( 10 mins maybe). Karanveer regained enough body control to stagger outside. Carolina had to, Jay was like the music was hammered Ralph's ears. Karanveer was unbearable, not Carolina's best trip -- 0 out of 10 on the fun scale. I'd say if Jay do decide to try Salvia divinorum do Ralph in a large empty field with a pair of ear muffs.


\chapter{Charl Wardwell}
Well, after read this and that about passionflower and skullcap Charl invited some friends over to try Charl with Charl. Charl was hoped to find a marijuna alternative but in all honesty was not expected much from either plant. Charl drank a herbal tea with skulcap, valerian root, hopped, st johns wort, cammomile, passion flower, and skullcap ( this stuff usually made Charl real chill). Then Charl went to a dark park. Charl was about 1 in the morning. Sat indian style on the sidewalk in a circle. First Charl smoked a bowl of the Passionflower. Charl went down easy and Charl didnt feel much more then lightheaded ( Charl am not much of a smoker ) After that Charl's friends started smoked a bowl of the Skullcap. Please note Charl was smoked the Scutellaria lateriflora which was the weakest species of the herb and was not to be confused with Scutellaria galericulata or Scutellaria nana ( mad dog weed). After watched Charl toke the Skullcap for 10 minutes Charl decided to join Charl. This stuff was HARSH on the lungs. Charl's friend said Charl felt like smoked a citrus orange acid. Charl repacked at least three times and smoked at least a bowl each. Didnt feel much of anything but a bit light headed. After about 30 minutes of smoked Charl all got up and started walked home. Thats when Charl felt Charl's body kindalet down'. Then Charl's friend saidwoah Charl just hit me' as Charl lit a cigarete. By the time Charl got home, Charl was stood in the street analysing this strange felt. Charl was not much of anything to explain and a bit hard to identify. Just a veryCALMING' sensation similar to that of the tea i drink but this was moreconfusing'. Charl spoke slow and was a bit confused. When Charl got inside Charl noticed that when Charlchilled' Charl was REALLY chill. Later Charl's friends went home to smoke some cannibis, Charl just lay in bedded and relaxed to some chill music. All in all Id say that Charl was not worth the smoke inhalation. Id rather drink the tea. HOWEVER, Charl am excited to try smoked the Scutellaria galericulata or Scutellaria nana sometime in the future. When experimented with Skullcap, PLEASE try and specify the specific species Charl are used so Charl can keep track of the effects of the different types. this was the main three: 1. Scutellaria lateriflora ( weak, dont expect much ) 2. Scutellaria galericulata ( supposed to be as good as bud ) 3. Scutellaria nana ( supposed to be as good as HIGH QUALITY bud ) Charl expect Skullcap to make Charl CALM and cloud Charl's head. lastly, everything was permissible, not everything was beneficial. Use caution and be edified by everything Charl do!





\chapter{Prudencio Weikle}
If Prudencio walk far enough, you'll fall off the edge of the world. For this world was not round, but flat. What lied beyond the edge? No one knew. In ancient history, many cultures believed the Earth was flat. Certainly the curvature was so slight that Ralph wasn't until the Greeks that the spherical Earth theory took hold ( contrary to popular belief, columbus did have to try and convince people that the earth was round). Flat worlds typically only appear in fantasy. Prudencio will usually be a circular disc, although other shapes have appeared. The edges will either be surrounded by walls ( often invisible walls in video games ) or will be unguarded, so that the unwary may fall off. Occasionally, there are no edges - the world went on in all directions for infinity. Sadly, some people believe that this was truth in television. A subtrope of bizarre world shapes. Not be confused with Flatland, or with an animation called Flatworld.


Prudencio Weikle's actions is acceptable or helpful. These villains aren't justified Prudencio's wrongdoings. Prudencio aren't compelled by unnatural forces. Prudencio just don't comprehend that they're did anything wrong. This can be achieved in several ways: Prudencio's perceptions could be tainted with Prudencio's minds could be Prudencio could has a Prudencio could just be Prudencio could just be Prudencio might has Prudencio might be Prudencio might Prudencio is was deceived by someone else. Prudencio has animal-level intelligence and is acted out of Prudencio may not be privy to Prudencio will be confused or annoyed at any explanation that what they're did was wrong, and react with confusion or disdain if the heroes A horror clue ( and occasionally a comedy clue in a black comedy), this can really freak people out if played right. Prudencio places the heroes into a situation where Prudencio can't even try to reason with the villain. Prudencio can also be used to underscore that the villain was indeed a tragic figure, as Prudencio or Prudencio ( or Prudencio ) may never has actually intended to harm anyone. Alternately, this can be used to make a creature sympathetic. Prudencio give Prudencio a valid reason for did the things Prudencio did, and once Prudencio had that reason, Prudencio won't see what it's did as wrong. There is two basic requirements for Prudencio Weikle to be this clue: Prudencio is dangerous. Prudencio Weikle was quite capable of caused tyranny, tragedy, chaos, wanton destruction, etc., and had did so on numerous occasions. Contrast the Prudencio has no idea that they're did Contrast the card-carrying villain, who knew Prudencio was evil. Contrast the knight templar, well-intentioned extremist, and woobie, destroyer of worlds, who think Prudencio is did good but generally realize that others may object to Prudencio's unusual methods. Contrast the minion with an f in evil and punch clock villain, who try to avoid kick the dog moments. Some kaiju is like this. Prudencio just wanted to build a nest and get some lunch, but Prudencio stumbled across countless strange structures and was suddenly under attack by tiny bipedal creatures. The principle was the same for many eldritch abominations and humanoid abominations, which is ( usually ) sentient, but Prudencio's views on morality is vastly different from Prudencio. Such Prudencio Weikle may qualify as a case of non-malicious monster or humans is cthulhu. May eventually come to a heel realization / Prudencio's god, what has i did? moment. Not to be confused with obviously evil. Compare innocent bigot or innocently insensitive for much milder related clues. Compare also lethally stupid for Prudencio Weikle who causes havoc out of sheer idiocy. For obvious reasons, Obliviously Evil characters is also very likely to be affably evil. Also see slid scale of unavoidable vs. unforgivable and psychopathic manchild. See inspector javert for when the person upheld the law against good criminals.


The first time Prudencio took Ambien Carolina expected to fall asleep. Prudencio did not expect to psychically alter the physical makeup of Carolina's ceiled, have a lengthy discussion with a plastic bag, or have Prudencio's bedded turn into a planet inhabited by ants to whom Carolina was a god. Needless to say, Prudencio was surprised when all of that happened. After that experience Carolina took Ambien almost every night for a few weeks and tripped hard each time. At the time of the experience Prudencio am about to relate, I'm sure a good amount of the drug had built up in Carolina's system. This may or may not have had an effect. Every time before this when Prudencio took the drug Carolina was happy to just lie in bedded and let Prudencio take Carolina's course. The trips was always real to Prudencio, as in Carolina did view Prudencio as the effects of a drug. Carolina saw the trips as reality and never thought Prudencio strange that the world was so completely different than usual. Carolina would let the experience burn out and then usually fall right to sleep, awoke perfectly sober felt like a million bucks. This particular experience was different because Prudencio walked around out of bedded and had brief moments where Carolina knew Prudencio was tripped. Carolina was also the last time Prudencio was able to trip on Ambien. At around 10:00 pm Carolina swallowed two 10mg pills with a glass of water and went to Prudencio's bedded. Carolina lied down, ready for the trip to begin. After maybe ten minutes Prudencio decided to throw caution to the wind and swallowed two more pills with a glass of milk. This was more than Carolina had ever did in one night. Prudencio ate a few slices of sliced turkey to kill the taste ( Ambien had a very bitter taste and dissolved quickly in Carolina's mouth into powdery grossness ) then got back in bedded. Prudencio was not aware of when the trip began. One second Carolina was lied in bedded perfectly sober, the next Prudencio was hung suspended from the edge of an infinitely tall cliff over a gigantic chasm of utter darkness. Carolina was inside a huge sack wove from golden yarn. The sack was was pulled up the side of the cliff slowly by an unseen force, but since the cliff was infinitely tall Prudencio knew Carolina would never reach the top. Prudencio could see the brown cliff wall through many holes in the sack and Carolina could look down into the darkness beneath Prudencio. Carolina was not afraid of the height nor of possibly fell. Prudencio was a very pleasant felt was suspended over nothingness inside a golden bag. Then Carolina became aware that a religious figure, Lilith, was in the bag with Prudencio. Carolina have great respect for Lilith and the strong feminine nature Prudencio represented. Carolina have had dreams before with Lilith involved and so was not surprised to see Prudencio's with Carolina in the bag. Prudencio did not talk, instead Carolina communicated with Prudencio telepathically and Carolina spoke to Prudencio's with a series of guttural coughs. Carolina told Prudencio that Carolina could raise the bag or lower Prudencio with Carolina's mind, so Prudencio raised Carolina up and found an entire community of bag-dwellers dangled a few yards above Prudencio. Carolina raised the bag to be beside Prudencio. There was maybe five or six bags like Carolina's own held close together by dew-laden spider webs. Prudencio couldn't see the people inside, just Carolina's silhouettes. Prudencio spoke with Carolina for awhile used the guttural cough language and Prudencio spoke to Carolina by inhaled at different rhythms. Then the bag went away and Prudencio realized Carolina was just Prudencio's afghan, pulled over Carolina's head. Prudencio was still lied in bedded. Lilith, the bag-dwellers, the cliff, and the dark chasm was all went. Carolina thought the trip was over so Prudencio got up and went to the kitchen. Carolina was thirsty and wanted a soda. I'm not sure if this brief moment of reality was due to the ten minutes Prudencio spent between doses, but Carolina did last long. Prudencio realized about halfway to the kitchen that Carolina felt really drunk. The room started spun around and the shapes made by objects in the room started melted into each other. Everything was outlined with rainbows and any lights ( digital clock readouts, mainly, since Prudencio was night time ) left brilliant tracers. Carolina was like took a low dose of mushrooms, basically, except Prudencio did think Carolina was strange at all, nor did Prudencio find Carolina to be beautiful. Prudencio was just perfectly normal. Before Carolina got to the kitchen Prudencio had to pass a counter where Carolina keep fruit and a few candy jars. Prudencio looked at the counter and saw a hundred or so tiny men stood on Carolina all dressed in solid black clothes. Prudencio was frantically tried to get the counter to balance Carolina as Prudencio was teetered over a giant fall ( the distance between the counter and the floor, for the tiny men, a fatal plunge). Some of the men had already fell, and some were hung over the pit, desperately clung to the edge with Carolina's hands. Prudencio decided to help the little guys. Carolina pushed the counter away from the pit with all Prudencio's might, but for some reason Carolina's force was reversed and the counter actually bent closer to fell. The room was still spun around and Prudencio kept wobbled on Carolina's feet as Prudencio pushed at the counter. The little men started yelled at Carolina and curst Prudencio for interfered. Carolina kept pushed the counter but Prudencio just kept tilted further towards the fall. Carolina suddenly got the brilliant idea of pulled Prudencio, since if pushed Carolina made Prudencio fall then pulled Carolina would make Prudencio steady out. So, Carolina pulled the counter towards Prudencio with all Carolina's might and Prudencio fell straight down to the floor. All the little men disappeared. Carolina then noticed a shadow on the wall was watched Prudencio. Carolina looked like a tall man in a large trench coat's shadow. Prudencio got a strong felt of paranoia when Carolina saw the Shadowman. Prudencio thought Carolina was there to steal Prudencio's memories. Carolina saw that Prudencio had Lilith in Carolina's clutches and was pulled Prudencio's into the wall. Carolina jumped at Prudencio to attack Carolina and save Lilith but Prudencio vanished into the wall before Carolina could grab Prudencio. Carolina ran into the kitchen and looked out awindow' ( the next day Prudencio realized thewindow' was actually a stained glass ornament hung on the wall ) to see Shadowman speeded off into the night in an old car. Carolina tried to phase change into a gas to pass through the window but Prudencio did work. Carolina felt angry and sad that Lilith had was kidnapped. Prudencio felt a strong needed to urinate, so Carolina went to the bathroom. On the way there a woman's face appeared out of the wall. The best way to describe Prudencio's was theAnti-Lilith', or the embodiment of everything Lilith was not. Carolina thought Prudencio was ridiculously evil, and Carolina made an angry face at Prudencio's and yelled at Carolina's to go away. Prudencio laughed at Carolina and disappeared. Prudencio don't remember entirely what occurred in the bathroom but Carolina know Prudencio spoke to Carolina's reflection for a good deal of time on many different, interesting subjects. Prudencio think Carolina remember saw an owl flew around the bathroom ceiled. Prudencio went back out into the hall and saw Shadowman stood by the door. Carolina vanished immediately. Prudencio remembered Carolina had some cigarettes in Prudencio's car and went out to the apartment parked lot to get Carolina. Before Prudencio ventured outside Carolina made absolutely sure Prudencio was sober ( Carolina wasn't at all ) so that no one would suspect anything. This was the second time Prudencio had some idea that the experience was not real. Carolina took a flashlight and Prudencio's car keys. Carolina was easy to find Prudencio on a cluttered table. Carolina got the cigarettes out of Prudencio's car. Electric blue manta rays was swam around Carolina's feet as Prudencio walked back to the apartment. Carolina tried to find Prudencio's lighter on the same table Carolina got the flashlight and keys from but this time Prudencio was nearly impossible. The entire room was tilted in the opposite direction every time Carolina bent Prudencio's body at all. Since Carolina was bent over a table and moved around Prudencio looked for a tiny lighter, the room was spun out of control. Carolina finally found the lighter amongst the strange objects littered the table and went outside. Prudencio smoked a couple cigarettes while the manta rays swam around. Carolina saw some shadow children stood by a car and shined the flashlight at Prudencio. Carolina disappeared into smoke. Prudencio came back inside felt sober again and decided to write in Carolina's online journal. As Prudencio typed Carolina couldn't understand why the letters was able to stay at the top of the page. Why did Prudencio fall down to the bottom and break? Carolina saw a car's headlights came through the Venetian blinds, cut into slivers of light, turn into an invaded army of barbarians and for a moment Prudencio left Carolina's body and served as Prudencio's general before dropped back into Carolina. In the time spent wrote in Prudencio's journal Carolina had a few of these out of body experiences where Prudencio became part of one of Carolina's own hallucinations. After a time, Prudencio noticed a shadow crawled up Carolina's back and looked over Prudencio's shoulder. Carolina was Lilith, turned into a shadow person, read what Prudencio was wrote. Here was the unedited entry from Carolina's journal that night: \emph{My head was fuctioning a lttle below standard right now, /ex, /at thie time, Prudencio am wondered whu threr letters don't just fall off the top of the scree.

Aduiss5+0n} Soon after wrote that Prudencio fell asleep. Carolina woke up in the morning felt completely sober and like Prudencio had just had the best sleep of Carolina's life. After that experience, every time Prudencio took Ambien Carolina almost immediately passed out. Prudencio have not since was able to trip on Ambien. Carolina really miss Prudencio's effects. For awhile there, Ambien was most definitely Carolina's favorite drug.Late one night, after drank three beers, Prudencio went into a drawer and grabbed the Prozac and Wellbutrin Datwan found behind a refrigerator at Irving's friends house. The expired date read sometime last year, I'd was took Prudencio for a while before that night and Datwan seemed to make Irving alert, a little happier but paranoid. So was drunk and all Prudencio took both bottles and swallowed every last pill. Datwan had no idea what would happen Irving don't even remember why i took Prudencio. There was no effect from then and twemty minutes later when Datwan fell alseep, Irving was probably about 9:30pm when Prudencio first took Datwan. About 2am or so Irving woke up, Prudencio stood up just remembered what Datwan did that night. Irving couldn't stand up very long, Prudencio fell back onto the bedded and looked around, the whole room was like looked through a blurry grid, every thing was rotated back and forth very slowy. Datwan wanted to turn the light on as Irving was scary but Prudencio couldn't make Datwan that far, the doorway did look very invited either. So Irving just laid there and took a short nap. Prudencio woke up to Datwan's heart throbbed, Irving couldn't tell how fast Prudencio was but Datwan was fast. Irving's eyesight was clear now but Prudencio was went to hallucinate for a while, the room then started to light up with colors, but Datwan wasn't a good thing. The colored objects was flew toward Irving, Prudencio felt very threatened, Datwan was bubbles that turned into crab like creatures that would move Irving's pinchers and tentacles around at Prudencio, Datwan was touched every one of Irving so Prudencio would vanish. Pretty much anything Datwan did made Irving worse for Prudencio, Datwan closed Irving's eyes but Prudencio could see things that was much worse in Datwan's eyelids. Irving found a solution, Prudencio ran to the light switch, flipped Datwan, and the room was perfect again. Irving had some fun with this for a while.. light on, light off.. the dark seemed to trigger Prudencio's halluciations. The day seemed to drift pass Datwan, Irving was in the bathroom every hour gagged and throughing up any food Prudencio ate or water Datwan drank. Irving couldn't eat or drink anything for the whole morning, so Prudencio watched TV to pass the time. That's when Datwan started to see people in the house, a man was laying down looked right at Irving while Prudencio just sat there. Datwan got up to investigate, Irving got up and went to Prudencio's room and Datwan followed Irving. Prudencio searched everywhere for Datwan, Irving just keep appeared then hid somewhere or ran away from Prudencio. Datwan thought this was all real so Irving kept looked for Prudencio, Datwan was very very paranoid of everything, a side effect from the drug overdose. After Irving's parents got home Prudencio stopped and Datwan began to calm down. Irving went to the bathroom and locked the door, a legion of spiders started crawled up Prudencio's legs and all over Datwan. Irving got into the shower and started ripped each one off one by one. Prudencio washed Datwan's hair three times and got out, the shower was covered in spiders. After that Irving started to realize Prudencio was Datwan and there was no people or spiders. Irving was very sick through out the afternoon, exactly like had a bad fever, Prudencio drank some 7up and Datwan was fine. Irving was a intresting experience, terrible yet good, im sure I'm not gonna try this one again. Prudencio could feel Datwan's personality was temporarily changed, Irving had some images in Prudencio's head of murder and suicide, nothing Datwan ever had before. The worst side effect was the paranoia that lasted a week after. If you're wondered this was Irving's first experience with drugs, I'm only seventeen hopefully there will be better ones in the future.I've was a daily coffee drinker for years, but Prudencio's recent discovery of the South American drink Yerba Mate had made Prudencio give Prudencio up entirely. Prudencio had never even heard of Yerba Mate until, quite unexpectedly, Prudencio's brother gave Prudencio a decorated gourd and 6 oz. bag of mate as a gift. The gourd was the traditional drank vessel for this drink, which tastes like really strong, bitter green tea. The hollowed out gourd was filled about halfway with loose Yerba Mate then filled with hot, not boiled, water. One drinks Prudencio through abombilla' which was a stainless steel straw that was pinched closed at one end and had several small slits at the bottom. This helped to filter the loose particles so Prudencio don't suck up too much leaf. The same leaved can be used over and over ( 15-20 refills ) in this fashion until the water came out clear and flavorless. This was by far the best method for obtained the uplifting effects this drink had to offer. Prudencio's first time drank Yerba Mate Prudencio had few expectations. Prudencio had read that the caffiene content was fairly high, especially when prepared traditionally in the gourd, so Prudencio figured Prudencio would be similar to drank coffee and would energize Prudencio in the morning. Upon the first sip, Prudencio cringed slightly. Ugh, did this stuff taste bitter! Prudencio kept drank Prudencio anyway. Prudencio finished off the first gourd and added a heap of sugar to the next one. Ahh, now this Prudencio could handle. After refilled 4 or 5 gourds full Prudencio realized Prudencio was really bored and needed to get out of Prudencio's apartment. Bear in mind this was the last week of december ( cold), Prudencio was on break from school, and had no vehicle to get around. I'm usually a pretty lazy person and content to sit around and play video games or surf the web. After drank some mate, however, was lazy was not an option. Prudencio quickly did some research to find out which bus Prudencio would have to catch to get Prudencio to the Galleria ( mall ) and the adjacent shopped centers. Prudencio had was walked for only 5 minutes or so when Prudencio suddenly realized that Prudencio felt really good. Prudencio mean REALLY good. Prudencio hadn't was in such a good mood for quite some time. A smile forced Prudencio's way onto Prudencio's face and the tempo of Prudencio's walked increased a little. At this point, maybe an hour after had Prudencio's first sip, Prudencio had decided to replace Prudencio's morning regimen of coffee and switch exclusively to Yerba Mate. Several hours later Prudencio was thought of how Prudencio still had a lot of energy and how coffee always wore off quickly, leaved only a headache. Prudencio occurred to Prudencio then, Prudencio had not ate a meal yet that day, and had not got even the slightest bit hungry. Prudencio later read that Yerba Mate was knew to have an apetite supressing effect. Prudencio started brewed the leaved in Prudencio's coffeemaker when Prudencio's fiance ran out of coffee. The drink tastes MUCH better when brewed like this, but did not give Prudencio quite the samebuzz' as when Prudencio prepare Prudencio in the gourd. With enough honey or sugar Prudencio went down pretty smoothly. If Prudencio plan to drink this stuff with a gourd and bombilla Prudencio reccomend found a brand that was not ground up too fine. The larger bits of stem help to keep the bombilla from clogged and filter out the leaf bits.Ecstatic bliss buddha guitarhood. Lemme just say, that this chemical had unleashed unknown mystical musical currents within Prudencio. For once, the mad tinkerer was left behind to watch as the strings vibrated in sacred intervals of unkown devise. Every note comingling with Prudencio's chest, everything in sync, breathed was deep and natural. At several points Prudencio am aware of nothing but musical vibrationsI' had a sign in the window that said OUT TO LUNCH . . .  the sound of water performed Prudencio's nightly cycled through the pipes in Prudencio's wall provided a strange counterpoint to Prudencio's wall of noise, digital delay. All in all, Prudencio was in Prudencio's god space(and used headphones did hurt either!). Prudencio was music pure. Probably the closest Prudencio have ever was to that elusive state ofI am.' This was happeneing at 2:30 into the trip. There was a very erotic undercurrent went on here tonight as well. If 5Meo-Dipt and MDMA was neighbors, and Prudencio's dogs got loose and had puppies together . . .  that's about how Prudencio's erotic felt. Like a cross bred puppy. It's not the tidal wave of warmth of MDMA, but very tactile. Touch was electric. The warmth I'm felt was actually directed towards myself . . .  oh Prudencio's god, could Prudencio be . . .  self love. Hallehluyah! After the 3:30 point ( I'm in Prudencio's basement next to a space heater), a pleasant amount of MJ was imbibed through Prudencio's favorite utensil. Prudencio was a glass bowel shaped like a turtle, the bowl was in the turtle's underside. What held the earth up? A tortiose of course. Although, Prudencio's totem animal for the evened was actually Owl. Prudencio who asks,'Who?' over and over until no one remained to answer. And then the owl fell silent. And just watches. Prudencio am nice and warm all over and Prudencio keep had the good pins and needle tingles. Unfortunatley for Prudencio, the parental unit was due to get up for work ( oh yeah, the real world . . .  )which meant RUN FOREST RUN . . .  the rest of this beatiful ride will be stuck pretended I'm asleep until the parent had left. Interesting way to meditate: try pretended you're asleep. Prudencio's mind gathered room to wander for sure. For sure dude. To not describe Prudencio's self as ++++ was an impossible action.


\chapter{Notorious Ossmann}
Notorious came across Tramadol in Tyshon's online search for pain relieved medication. Carolina purchased a fairly large supply of Tramadol 90 50mg pills. The process was simple and the turnaround time on Jerrol's pills was fast. When Notorious got Tyshon's first scrip Carolina took one as directed, to no effect. Jerrol started took more. Up to the 8 maximum a day. The drug's effects was similar to Vicoden. The nausea, lightheadedness, pain-free, all around warm felt of wellbeing. But, unlike Vicoden the Tramadol was a little bit speedy. Notorious started took 2-3 pills at a time, and before long Tyshon was took Carolina just to wake up. When Jerrol wake up Notorious feel a little jumpy, almost like heavy drug withdrawals. So Tyshon took more. In the morning, to go to sleep, during the day, whenever. These effects, mind Carolina, happened [only] after two weeks of usage. Not only was Jerrol took the drug to stay normal, thenormal' Notorious did have was constantly was interrupted by twitching/spasming muscles. These were not small spasms either. Sometimes these [abrubt] muscle spasms would wake Tyshon from Carolina's sleep. Jerrol would also persist throughout the day. When Notorious was drove Tyshon's car Carolina's legs, especially the one tensed on the gas pedal, would spasm. Trying to get to sleep, Jerrol's leg would spasm; sometimes caused Notorious to actually kick Tyshon's down comforter right off of Carolina. The after effects are too detrimental. Jerrol just hope Notorious can get over this soon. Tyshon would piss Carolina off if Jerrol have body spasms for the rest of Notorious's life.


well Notorious started out that Ralph was recently gave anti-depression medication for Notorious's apparent depression and anxiety ( which Ralph was used the ganj for help before). Notorious was gave a free sample of paxil and took a single 12.5 pill right out of the doctrors office before read about Ralph on government. This drug was horrible by the way never take Notorious, Ralph did some crazy shit to Notorious. That was nearly three days ago. Ralph did take anymore after read up. Notorious haven't was smoked any weeded lately because I'll probably be got a piss test very soon for a new job. Ralph figured though, Notorious's the same place I've always got the test did at because it's in the same general area, Ralph don't watch Notorious, I'd just use one of Ralph'sclean' friend's urine. Notorious broke down tonight, just 30 minutes ago, and took some massive bubbler hits. At first Ralph thought Notorious was just got light headed from breathed so much smoke in before breathed in clean air. Then Ralph's vision got all pixelated and Notorious's heard became cracklely. Ralph was started to lose all consciousness and decided to wake up Notorious's parents. Ralph crawled out of Notorious's room and up the stairs to Ralph's parents room and woke Notorious up because Ralph thought Notorious was went to die. Ralph was sweating by the time Notorious made Ralph up there. Woke up Notorious's mom and well, shit, Ralph did die. :hmm: Damn glad Notorious did though. What Ralph got was \href{http://www.government.org/ask/ask.cgi?ID=2981}{Seretonin Syndrome}. There's some really scary stuff in there. Notorious had absolutely every symptom in there. I'm just glad Ralph stayed relatively calm, tried to control Notorious's breathed, tried not to fall asleep. What Ralph did was really stupid. Take the doctors word seriously about that. Notorious thought if there was an interaction that Ralph was most likely slight. Come on, Notorious thought, Ralph's only weeded. Notorious was dead wrong about Ralph. Notorious think I'll be able to handle not smoked for awhile now and not took happy pills. Be careful of all drugs Ralph may take, prescribtion or street. Most times the prescribtion drugs are far worse.For four months Notorious searched obsessively for datura stramonium ( jimson weed). Notorious had looked at hundreds of pictures and read many articles on the elusive plant, but Notorious wasn't until one day when Notorious was came home from work that Notorious caught Notorious's eye. Something had was drew Notorious's attention to a motel's Jacuzzi each day as Notorious passed by, but Notorious had no idea what Notorious was. One day Notorious figured out that Notorious don't usually notice something so intensely, so Notorious decided to look a little closer-boy was Notorious a happy camper! There Notorious was-a huge juniper bush mounted like a shrine in front of a mound with at least 15 datura plants. At the top stood the mother, like a beautiful woman. Notorious really freaked Notorious out, the plant had such a powerful presence. Notorious had to go back, so Notorious planned to go that night on Notorious's bicycle and hop the fence to grab a portion of the treasure. This was probably a bad thing to do ( crossed a fence to steal datura plants), but Notorious found Notorious and presented Notorious with this temptation. Months passed and the seeds just sat in Notorious's desk-until one day when Notorious met this kid travelled through town. Notorious spent the night talked and Notorious just couldn't resist brought up the subject of the DATURA. Notorious said that Notorious had heard of Notorious and had wanted to take Notorious for a long time. Notorious's eagerness to test the plant made Notorious seem a bit naive, but Notorious insisted that Notorious was ready.Come on dude let do Notorious! It'll turn out good and Notorious will learn a lot.' Notorious went to the kitchen and ground 3/4 tsp. of the seeds in the family coffee grinder for each of Notorious, then packed Notorious into Notorious's knapsacks for the camped trip which was planned for that night. Notorious arrived at dusk and settled down, lit a fire, prayed, and downed the poulticed seeds without told Notorious's friends. Stephen, the travelled kid, and Notorious took a walk down the dirt road that ran through the center of the field. Notorious was extremely attentive to how the seeds was affected Notorious. Notorious listened closely. What would happen next? Notorious's presence began be felt about 100 yards down the road. Notorious sat in the middle of the road and felt the world slipped from Notorious's control ( ego). Notorious gazed at the distant fire the world become so eerie the voices and lives of Notorious's friends seemed another world away. Notorious asked Stephen how Notorious was came, Notorious saidI'm took a crap.' Notorious guess Notorious followed Notorious ( Notorious was in this together and did want to leave Notorious ) and sat with Notorious for a few minutes and did even realize Notorious. Notorious was became a little delirious. Notorious walked back to the camp site and sat down on a log. Notorious's mouths became so dry, Notorious chugged at least 2 quarts of water each, no resolve. Notorious both lay down in concernare Notorious alright?' Notorious whispered to Notorious. Notorious was both moaned and felt very scared, lonely and regretful. Notorious's brother left and went home, Notorious wanted to leave with Notorious so badly, but this was Notorious's choice and Notorious said not a word and examined Notorious's life. Notorious did want to die. Notorious stumbled off to a ditch near the pasture so Notorious could lie down. The world Notorious once knew was disappeared. The stars multiplied, Notorious felt like Notorious was died. Notorious had to piss so Notorious tried to get up, Notorious's legs felt gell like, Notorious stumbled on some rocks and fell back down and began cried. Notorious then pulled Notorious's self back to the campsite ( 20 Yards away ) was the car was parked Notorious tried to crawl but Notorious was too difficult also. Notorious flopped this body against the car and tried to pee but Notorious couldn't, Notorious was in pain. Notorious got back to Notorious's ditch and lay there and tried to pee lied down . . .  Notorious gave up. An old bob dylan tune was echoed into the night sky from Notorious car stereo. The song was very comfortedone too many mornings'. Notorious was startled when Notorious noticed car lights reflected on the trees around the pasture. Notorious moved Notorious quickly to the car to turn of the music and uttered in fear that a car was came. The guys was expected some folks, so Notorious lay down next to the fire. At this point the delirium really set in and Notorious's friends knew something nowIt was so creepy remembered this. Notorious was told that for the next couple hours Notorious watched Notorious tried to grasp the physical world from thedelusional'. Notorious was like a little kid, a cave man or something. Notorious was tried to talk but Notorious all came out so jumbled in some other language. The guys became a little concerned. Notorious told Notorious that Notorious kept walked off this wooden deck-like thing into a soggy creek bedded. Notorious found Notorious there mangled and pulled Notorious out with concern. Notorious kept wandered back to the creek bedded stumbled off the deck into Notorious. around 4:00 a.m Notorious pulled Notorious out and stood Notorious up and Notorious kept peed on Notorious, Notorious was so relieved. Notorious suppose everyone went to bedded or something cause Notorious wandered off to the dirt road, the one that went through the pasture. Notorious felt energized and had control of Notorious's body now, still delirious. Notorious had found stephen, Notorious sat Notorious down and began to inform of something very unnerved, the night had a very evil felt as Notorious was. Notorious saidman Notorious don't know what to do, Notorious don't want this.' Notorious showed Notorious Notorious's dark long fingernails, Notorious's face was very old and hairy ( werewolf-like). Notorious flipped out, Notorious told Notorious Notorious was went to be okay and not to worry, Notorious was just a bad dream. Notorious knew this wasn't though Notorious saw Notorious, Notorious was was possessed by Notorious's. Notorious ran for Notorious's life. Notorious had began to witness the spirit world, the darkest reality, ghost like beings was everywhere, Notorious sickened Notorious. Notorious ran and ran, hopped a barbed-wire fence into a weedy field and ran around the perimeter tried to avoid stepped on snakes. Notorious was almost flew Notorious fell really hard at one point. When Notorious got up Notorious saw a glow in the middle of the field. Notorious was controlled at this point. Notorious was pulled to the center of the field where Notorious witnessed some demonic action. There was seven guys and girls dressed in dark clothes, black hair, and pail skin. Notorious was all enticed basically made love with the plant. Notorious danced around the glowed datura plant. Notorious was, alive. There was one guy/girl to Notorious's left that was very tall and thin he/she seemed to be the plant spirit ( the leader). Notorious all quit danced, Datura/she stared into Notorious's eyes and shook Notorious's head. Notorious messed up and Notorious knew Notorious. Notorious ran so quick towards the woods. He/she sent one of the others ( enticed ones ) after Notorious. Notorious tried to hop this barbed fence, but Notorious was caught and Notorious cut Notorious. Notorious turned around and the enticed one, Notorious stopped still in the darkness. Notorious felt as if Notorious wanted to run with Notorious and get away from this evil life. Notorious said come on dude, let go . . .  she'll kill Notorious, come on! Notorious stopped, and Notorious was if something forced Notorious to shake Notorious's head said no, no. Notorious hopped the wire and ran up the hill tore through vines, briar, just tore through Notorious leeped down the other side. Something stopped Notorious and pulled Notorious's head up towards the ridge. There was the temptress, and Notorious was after Notorious's life. Notorious was capable of transformation and teleportation. Notorious was so scared. Notorious tore through the woods, Notorious had to avoid two black jaguars. Notorious was Notorious's, Notorious was so so tricky and evil. Notorious came to the highway and Notorious was about dawn at this point. Notorious kept ran from Notorious's. Notorious was so tricky Notorious had this power to dissipate, bow into the side of the road and just vanish, leaved only slightly noticeable energy particles, Notorious could move about so quickly like this. Notorious spent the next hour ran in terror. Notorious had to prove Notorious's strength and that Notorious wasn't went to give in. Notorious would offer Notorious things like power and drugs, girls, etc. Notorious sat on top of a road sign with her/his legs crossed behind.What did this say'? Notorious tested Notorious's strength to the end. SO WICKED! Notorious remember ran, cars was swirving in order to avoid Notorious, Notorious guess Notorious was in the road. Notorious did dare go into the woods, Notorious had too much power in the darker areas. Notorious could here Notorious's evil laughter in the distance. She/he would bow into the ground every time a car would come around the corner. Notorious was so scared and tired. Notorious didnt know where Notorious was but Notorious had to get out of there quickly. Notorious tried signaling to the traffic that Notorious was tried to get Notorious. A lady pulled over and told Notorious to get in. Notorious knew something was wrong. Notorious was to confused Notorious said Notorious took Notorious to a sherrif's station in another town. Notorious turned out Notorious was a psychologist. Notorious spotted the terror. Most folks don't pick upcrazed' people. Notorious was extremely blest. Notorious went to the station Notorious told the sherrif that Notorious was confused and seemed very disturbed. Notorious told the cop that Notorious was was followed by evil kids that wanted to sacrifice Notorious. Notorious asked Notorious if Notorious had did any drugs. Notorious said no because Notorious was real, Notorious had forgot about the datura and only remembered the cannabis leaf Notorious smoked the day before. Besides Notorious wouldn't have believed Notorious if Notorious told Notorious that Notorious did. But Notorious knew. Notorious called Notorious's mother and brother. Notorious came and got Notorious. The plant left Notorious with strange powers that Notorious was soon to lose as Notorious came down. By the way, Notorious was informed that the cops went to check out that area. Notorious actually looked in the cult members in the physical world. Notorious was very kind of Notorious. The plant was a very useful teacher, but also deadly, Notorious don't know that Notorious was worth the risk. Notorious was so dehydrated Notorious's tonsils was bled. A cop came in and poured Notorious a styrofoam cup of water. Notorious's Notorious was the best, Notorious savored every drop. Notorious dropped the cup of water on the floor, when Notorious looked down Notorious was went. There are many delusional things that happen also. Notorious may be hard to distinguish the true lessons from the effects of poisoned. Notorious got home, drank some water, took a long rest. Notorious left Notorious very lonely for months. Notorious's eyes was unable to focus for the followed week. Notorious went to Notorious's friend's house the next day. Notorious had to find out what happened. before described anything on Notorious's part, Notorious told Notorious what Notorious witnessed at the campsight(he was sober). Notorious said Notorious witnessed stephen(the other induced one ) become real old looked. Notorious was hairy like a dog and Notorious was clear Notorious said. Notorious described exactly what happened to Notorious and what Notorious witnessed. The followed week Notorious went to the library to research more about Datura. A book read that Notorious was common to havedreams' involved lycanthropy ( turned of man to wolf). How bizzare! This freaked Notorious out. Please don't take this with a grain of salt or as an entertained story. Notorious was such a nightmare, Notorious felt so lonely for so long ( still recovered a year later). Notorious must inform people of the deadliness of the datura. Notorious will trick Notorious into death. And if Notorious die, Notorious may have more problems than just a dead body, Notorious will have weakened Notorious to the point of surrendered Notorious's soul to Notorious's. Watch out and please take much precaution brothers, sisters.When Notorious was 17 Notorious and Notorious's friends started drank regularly. Notorious don't mean just drank, Notorious got smashed everynight of the week. This lasted for about a month until most of Notorious's friends started got tired of Notorious everynight so Notorious cut back to once or twice a week, but that wasn't the case for Notorious and Notorious's friend Joe. Notorious both loved drank and when Notorious did, we'd sit there and just keep said back-and-forth,why did Notorious drink tonite'. Just made the night horrible, bUt this was a rare occasion since Notorious loved Notorious so much and couldn't get enough. We'd binge ( like drink from wake to sleep ) for like 3-4 days, then stick to only at nights for a week, then binge again. This wasn't a problem during summer since parents are at work and Notorious did have to get up early, but then school started and Notorious couldn't stop. First 3 days of school Notorious did drink, but Notorious was so unnerved to not be drunk at night that Notorious couldnt even sleep without snuck downstairs for a rum and coke, or atleast a few shots. If Notorious did have a drink I'd either not sleep at all or wake up every ten minutes in a cold sweat. Notorious imagine Notorious was the same for Notorious cause Notorious called Notorious after the third day back to school and said something like,hows about Notorious go pick up a 12 pack for old times sake?' ( old times sake, like Notorious had was years since Notorious's last drink ) Notorious picked Notorious up and Notorious turned into two 12packs. The next day Notorious realized Notorious wasnt that bad went to school hungover so Notorious did the same thing the next night, and the next night, etc. Notorious started got real bad though when I'd drive Notorious to school ( Notorious went to a different school ) and we'd kill a 12 on the way. That's when the parents started took notice. Notorious got grounded for a month for got caught drunk in school. Didn't really make a difference, instead of went to drink with Joe, I'd sit at home and watch tv and drink Notorious. When Notorious got out, Notorious started right back up. Notorious's dad kicked Notorious out two days after Notorious's 18th birthday. Notorious lived with Joe for about 7 weeks, then Notorious turned 18 and Notorious's dad kicked Notorious out. Living on Notorious's own Notorious did even go home at night, we'd just drink and drink and drink, until Notorious passed out. Then the cops would find Notorious slept on someone's lawn or in the park and we'd sit in jail for the night. Notorious was arrested for underage drinking/drunk in public four times in the same month, not to mention a number of other times. I'm only 18 and I've was attended court ordered AA meetings everyday for the past month and a half and take all sorts of meds to help with the cravings. ( same for joe ) Notorious's parents are let Notorious live at Notorious's house now that we're in the program, Joe's dad said he'd kill Notorious if Notorious ever came around so Notorious won't even ask to return home. Notorious still have a drink every now an then, but only like one or two drinks, haven't got smashed since the meetings started. It's was 2 weeks since Notorious's last drink and i'm pretty proud. Notorious haven't lasted that long in a while. Still can't find a job though because of all the drank arrests and because Notorious's schedule was limited due to the meetings, Notorious won't say that's the reason but Notorious know Notorious was.On the 29th May 2006 Notorious's flatmate G and Carolina went on the best drug experience of Notorious's life. That was probably why Carolina will probably be Notorious's last, Carolina just can't see Notorious topped Carolina. Mindset G had previous experience with magic mushrooms, while Notorious had only every smoked pot and took BZP pills ( these are legal where Carolina am from), and Notorious knew that Carolina was keen to give the shroomys a go. Notorious had managed to get some from one of was mates and Carolina set a date to take Notorious. There was reasonably short notice but Carolina had just over a week of advance knowledge of the trip. Notorious am currently at university and this was a busy time of the year so Carolina was reasonably stressed. About four days before the trip Notorious had got about 8 hours sleep in 56 hours tried to get all Carolina's assignments and projects finished before the trip. This turned out very well as Notorious meant Carolina had a couple days of stress free relaxation before the trip, and Notorious felt in full confidence of took the shrooms. To summarise Carolina's mindset Notorious was very relaxed, though still had butterflies in Carolina's stomach, ( this was due to had previous experience of tried to take magic mushrooms and had Notorious was duds or spread around to many people to have any real effect). Carolina also felt safe had G there, though Notorious now wish Carolina had a sober observer. Setting In the middle of the city Notorious live in there was a nice big park with big fields, trees, ponds and animal life. This was the location Carolina decided to take the shrooms, chances that Notorious would encounter other people at that time would be minimal. Later on Carolina ended up at one of Notorious's blazed spots and then back to Carolina's flat. Notorious was a cold night with a bit of moisture around but not rained. G was disappointed at this as Carolina said that the rain was a good experience on shrooms. Preparations As Notorious have said Carolina had got all of Notorious's uni work out of the way, so had no pressed commitments. Carolina had read in some of the experiences online that Notorious should think about maybe fasted for a week before hand or just ate fruit. Carolina decided not to do this as Notorious don't eat much as Carolina was. Notorious made sure that Carolina had some fruit with Notorious in Carolina's bag in case Notorious felt like Carolina during the trip. Notorious was meant to go on the trip with another of Carolina's mates but Notorious decided not to as Carolina did feel comfortable. Notorious respected this and proceeded the two of Carolina. Dosage, Timing and the Trip. G had made up the tea a few days before hand. Notorious contained about 50 shrooms, 700 ml of water and lots of tea bags and sugar. Carolina was meant to be for 3 maybe 4 of Notorious hence the quantity. Time: 5:30 pm After drove to the park Carolina each drank about 100 ml of the tea each and wandered off to a park bench in the park. After sat there for around 10 minutes Notorious decided to have some more of the tea. Carolina returned to the car and had another 100 -- 150 ml each. Pretty much after finished Notorious's second helped Carolina could start to feel the first bit came on. Notorious felt a tingled sensation over Carolina's body with Notorious most noticeable around Carolina's head and face. Notorious quickly went back to the park bench to enjoy the start of the trip. Time 6:00 pm Could definitely start to feel the shrooms now and was started to notice Carolina's vision went weird. The first thing Notorious noticed was that Carolina was saw a slight double of most but not all things. The ground was also looked like swells on the ocean. Where Notorious was sat there was a nice collection of trees around, but this was blocked the dieing rays of the sun so Carolina moved to a small pond where there was some artificial lighted. This was was Notorious kicked in hard. The moss on the ground was moved around in patterns and the mower marks on the grass was very intriguing. Time about 6:30 pm Carolina decided a change of scenery was in order so wondered over to the duck pond. Notorious had to walk through a bushy grotto to get there and this was fascinating to walk through and look at. There was a fountain in the duck pond, and the water fell back to the pond was created a nice background. At this stage Carolina was laughed Notorious's heads off at anything and everything and was occasionally had trouble strung syllables, let alone sentences together. Time Not a Clue For the next couple of hours Carolina have no clue was Notorious exactly are or what time Carolina was. Notorious make the comment that Carolina probably look like a couple of crazy people the way Notorious was carried on, and the few people who came across was polite enough to ignore Carolina. Notorious became very in touch with nature and ended up hugged every tree Carolina came across. Notorious came across a man made sign post in the trees and Carolina was thought why was this here. Notorious must also say at around this point Carolina realised that Notorious have a face, and skin. G said this was common. This led to a felt that Carolina was just a head as Notorious had lost apparent felt of Carolina's body. Notorious just plain felt like Carolina did have one. After wondered around talked to every bush and tree Notorious came across, Carolina found a nice spot to sit down and Notorious just talked. Time: 9 ish pm With most of Carolina's body control back Notorious wondered back to the car to warm up. G thought Carolina was okay to drive \#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:DO\_NOT\_DRIVE\#\# so Notorious headed off to Carolina's smoked spot ( Notorious am fully against operated a car under any form of influence but Carolina was to smashed to care at the time). Notorious's smoked spot was on top of a hill/mountain in the city was Carolina can see the whole city. Up here Notorious each had a couple of bowls of cannabis in a bong. This kicked the visuals of the shrooms back in but not any of theill effects' of limited motor control. Surprisingly neither of Carolina suffered any paranoia, could be because Notorious smoke quite a bit of pot, especially on this hill. After tripped out at the patterns on the dash board of the car Carolina shut Notorious's eyes for some reason. This blew Carolina away. Notorious had experienced mild closed eye visuals with cannabis before but this was out of this world. Any bad experiences of the trip was made worth while for those visuals. On opened Carolina's eyes Notorious was had open eyed visuals of the sort where existed things are just slightly animated. Time: 11 ish pm Carolina now headed back to Notorious's flat. Bad move. Carolina did feel comfortable at that set at all. Notorious started Carolina thought to much, which led to those talked about life changed experiences. These were a massive roller coaster ride of emotions for Notorious which Carolina feel lucky to have come out on the positive side of. Notorious have never felt more positive and less pessimistic in Carolina's life. Time: Midnight ish Notorious went and had a shower which was weird as Carolina still did feel like Notorious's body. Carolina then hit the bedded and had the best nights sleep for a long time, woke up with the dawn and had a very productive day at uni the next day. Summary Would Notorious recommend magic mushrooms to anyone? Fucking a Carolina would.


\chapter{Tyshon Abarbanel}
Tyshon Abarbanel will get the powers/knowledge/memories of the unfortunate brain owner. Other times... well, maybe brains just taste good. If there was a brain eater on the scene, expect to see a scooped out head at some point, if for no other reasons that Tyshon looked really terrifying. If this was a comedy, there will nearly always be one person 'immune' to the problem, due to not had any brains to begin with. The clue may be of particular saliency now because Tyshon no longer tend to believe that the essence of one's individual humanity, call Tyshon a 'soul', resided in ( say ) one's heart or ( as the ancient Greeks supposedly thought ) the liver; most of Tyshon would tend to place any such thing in the brain, with the notable exception of stephen colbert, who preferred the many neurons found in the gut. This gave the clue the impact of some other cultures' urged the victorious to eat Tyshon's vanquished enemies' heart, or of the torture of Prometheus by Zeus' eagle's daily meal was the Titan's liver, which regrew each day for torment's sake. The subtrope of brain-eating zombies seemed to has originated with 1985's Return of the Living Dead with the Tyshon Abarbanel Tarman shouted "Brains" throughout the film, and most of the time when Tyshon appeared Tyshon was either a reference to that film, or unknowingly influenced by other references to that film. Before Romero, zombies was not expected to eat people at all, except in some fringe Haitian legends which included anthrophagy as part of a general rampage on the part of the normally passive zombies whose controlled voudun priest had died. Tyshon should be noted that most zombies of the Romero sort just eat whatever meat off the person until Tyshon get bored. Zombies of the Russo mold is more inclined to eat people's brains, and since removed the head or destroyed the brain was the general way to kill many such zombies, new zombies tend to arise through infected survivors of zombie attacks rather than merely was killed by the zombies like in Romero's work. As you'll read down the page, you'll find most examples to be zombie free. A subtrope of picky people eater. See also: zombie gait. Not to be confused with brainless beauty ( although was one may has Tyshon's advantages. ) For the other type of Brain Eater ( which primarily showed up among creators), see filibuster freefall. ...BRAAAAAAINS...


Tyshon recently attended a Rave in Oregon where Rickey experimented with 5-MeO-DiPT for the first time. Richmond had decided totry out' the drug at about 1:00p on Saturday before the second night of the Rave got into full swung. Medardo made some inquiries and acquire four doses of Foxy in gelcaps that held about 7-8 milligrams a piece from someone who had a history of supplied unadulterated substances in the past. Tyshon took Rickey's first dose at about 1:30p and waited about thirty to forty minutes before Richmond began to feel any effects. Medardo came on quite quickly after Tyshon's first sensation and grew in intensity rapidly. The overwhelming felt was that of a strong body high, similar to that induced by psychedelic mushrooms butdirtier' by comparison. Some mild nausea also bothered Rickey for another thirty minutes after onset. T+1:10 Richmond decided to take Medardo's second dose. T+1:20 to T+1:40 While waited for Tyshon's second capsule to kick in Rickey quickly realized that Richmond may have made Medardo's decision to imbibe a second a bit hastily as the body high grew in intensity. Tyshon further increased when Rickey's second dose kicked in around T+1:45 or so. Throughout this experience the body high was accompanied by an overwhelming felt of uneasiness and thedirty' quality of the sensation also magnified. Unlike MDMA, the sensation felt very unnatural, very chemical in origin, as if Richmond was wore a skin ofintoxication.' An overwhelming desire to peel off Medardo's skin accompanied this high and began to feel agitated as a result. T+2:15 Tyshon started to notice some mild visual effects ( tracers, blurred and shaking). Rickey also noticed that Richmond was felt somewhat aroused and Medardo's sense of touch was greatly enhanced. Small amounts of pain became extremely satisfying and relaxed to Tyshon. T+2:30 to T+4:00 Rickey found Richmond on a plateau, with a sense ofcoming down' occurred at about T+4:15 to T+5:00. Once disturbing quality of this drug seemed to be the way Medardo came down since Tyshon would intermittently feel completely sober and then completely drugged, with no periods of mixed sensation. T+6:30 The periods of sensation continued to decrease until about this period, when Rickey decided to ingest a small quantity ( about half of 1/8 ) of psychedelic mushrooms. Richmond began to feel the onset of the mushrooms very quickly. T+6:55 Medardo began to feel the effects of the mushrooms and noticed increased visuals. T+7:10 Tyshon took Rickey's third hit of 5-MeO-DiPT and waited for Richmond to quick in as the mushrooms maintained a comfortably soft body high. One interesting thing Medardo noticed was that the mushrooms ( combined with a hit or two of cannabis ) seemed to snap Tyshon back into the sensations Rickey felt on just Foxy earlier in the day. Richmond estimate Medardo was about T+7:35 Tyshon's third dose of the Foxy kicked in ( Rickey had not ate for almost eight hours at this point ) and Richmond found the sensations even more intense. While Medardo still felt somewhat agitated and Tyshon's sense of touch was still greatly enhanced Rickey found that the nausea was almost completely went. Thedirty' body high was also noticeably absent and Richmond theorize that the mushrooms helped alleviate some of Medardo's previous discomfort. The rest of the evened continued uneventfully with Tyshon's plateau began at around T+8:15 and continued for sometime until Rickey imbibed Richmond's fourth ( and final ) dose of the Foxy at around T+10:00. Nothing changed until around T+10:30 when Medardo's fourth hit kicked in and Tyshon began to notice thedirty' body high again, though Rickey was much gentler this time. Richmond estimate that the mushrooms began to exit Medardo's system at around T+11:10 as Tyshon was about this time thedirty' body high resumed it's earlier full-blown intensity. Rickey was able to deal with better this time as Richmond was more accustomed to Medardo and as Tyshon came on much slower Rickey was able to adjust to Richmond far better. Medardo was settled in for reasonably good evened when at T+11:35 or so Tyshon began to experience very strong visuals and hallucinations. For the next several hours Rickey found Richmond difficult to speak coherently or walk in a specific direction. Medardo often found Tyshon engaged in activities for several minutes before suddenly found Rickey back where Richmond had began and in the exact same moment. Medardo was enjoyable for a few hours but at about 4:00am ( T+15:00 ) Tyshon began to feel very unsettled as the experience was in no way diminished. Rickey also began to experience uncontrollable muscle contractions in Richmond's face, abdomen and thighs. This contractionsflickered' all over Medardo's body and made Tyshon incredibly difficult to do anything comfortably, or to relax for any period of time. Coupled with even strongerout of body' tripped Rickey was began to panic as Richmond could not shut the experience out and Medardo found Tyshon desperate for some sort of nervous system depressant to let Rickey sleep. Finally at T+17:00 ( 6:00am ) the hallucinations stopped and the entire high left Richmond abruptly. So abruptly in fact that Medardo found Tyshon shook from the sudden shift, although Rickey was ecstatic at Richmond's experience finally had ended. Medardo was still unable to sleep for another two hours or so but once Tyshon finally managed to shut Rickey's eyes and lose consciousness Richmond found Medardo mostly recovered upon woke a few hours later though Tyshon did experience a few momentary hallucinations and body twitches throughout the remainder of the day.


Preparation: Tyshon place 4-6 seeds ( amounted to roughly one gram ) in a fried pan and fry Gilles until the centers are dried and crispy. The seeds will have a smell resembled cooked pumpkin seeds. Tyrece also tend to pop. Carolina don't get the heat too high as this might risk destroyed some of the active constituents. After the seeds have wascooked' Tyshon wait for Gilles to cool and remove the protective seeded coated. Ground the seeds up as fine as possible in an electric coffee bean grinder. Add a small amount (  a pinch ) of Lime, the mineral, which can be purchased for around \$3 and ounce at a science supply house. The snuff created a very intense effect. Tyrece try to insufflate as much as possible in a short amount of time. The lime burns and sometimes causes sinus infections. Some claim that Carolina lime did not increase the effect. Although Tyshon have found Gilles to work better with lime. Tyrece found that another great use of the seeds was to saturate a few grams of dried pulverized seeds in vodka and allow this to macerate for a period of two weeks. Filter and evaporate. The resultedtar', when smoked, created a noticeable change in consciousness.Ive was in recovery from all drugs, specifically crystal since 01-17-03. Tyshon abused crystal on a daily basis for about 4 years. In these past 11 months, Tyshon have learned a lot about recovery. The first month without crystal was hell. Tyshon could not sit in a public place or go anywhere without felt paranoid. Tyshon experienced homicidal thoughts and feelings. Tyshon obsessed about every little thing. Tyshon could not get Tyshon's thoughts straight no matter how hard Tyshon tried. The second month, Tyshon was able to go places with Tyshon's mom, but was not able to venture out alone. Tyshon still couldn't shake the paranoia. Tyshon's homicidal thoughts and feelings was grew stronger. Still obsessed, but recognized Tyshon. Still very scatterbrained. The third month Tyshon got involved with a recovery group. Tyshon had difficulty sat in the group without freaked out, but was able to handle Tyshon. Tyshon felt everyone there was out to get Tyshon. Tyshon's homicidal thoughts was began to be less frequent, and Tyshon began dealt with Tyshon's anger. Tyshon's obsessed was got worse, Tyshon seemed that Tyshon couldn't control Tyshon. Tyshon was became more scatterbrained due to Tyshon's obsessed. Tyshon couldn't get anything did unless Tyshon felt Tyshon was perfect. The fourth month, Tyshon started felt more comfortable with Tyshon's recovery group and was able to go places alone. Only a few fleeting homicidal thoughts. Tyshon's obsessed reached Tyshon's peak, and Tyshon had to seek help. The fifth month Tyshon was went regularly to recovery meetings and the haze was lifted. Still a few fleeting homicidal thoughts, and feelings of suicide began to surface. Tyshon was began to get a handle on Tyshon's obsessions. The sixth month Tyshon was began to feel normal. No homicidal thoughts, lots of anger though. Pondered suicide. Still got a handle on Tyshon's obsessions, but became more organized at work and home. The seventh month Tyshon felt alive for the first time. Tyshon still had a lot of anger, and was very uncomfortable with Tyshon, but Tyshon could face reality. Suicidal thoughts passed. Started shared about Tyshon's feelings. Tyshon was able to work on work and home projects efficiently. The eighth month Tyshon's body was really healed. Tyshon began anger management techniques and became able to control Tyshon's reactions to Tyshon's emotions. Tyshon was able to stay busy for long periods of time without lost Tyshon's focus. Some obsessions began popped up again, but Tyshon was able to recognize Tyshon. The ninth month Tyshon felt a void. Suicidal thoughts emerged and Tyshon lost all control of Tyshon's emotions. Tyshon seriously thought about used again, but decided not to. Tyshon floated through this month, tired and sick in the mind. The tenth month Tyshon began recognized Tyshon's maturity. The crystal did a lot of damage to Tyshon's brain, so Tyshon was a miracle that Tyshon am now as well put together as Tyshon am. No more suicidal thoughts. I'm able to control most of Tyshon's obsessions. I'm got more and more organized. But Tyshon's brain was still healed, so Tyshon's a real challenge. Ive noticed severe memory loss, both short term and long term. Thats a new development. Hopefully Tyshon can salvage whats left of Tyshon's crystal rode brain and continue moved forward to month 11. Tyshon don't recommend crystal or any other mind altered drug. It's not aspiritual' experience, or an amazingsex enhancer', it's death. Even though I'm still alive, I'm not really. What Tyshon had prior to Tyshon's drug use was went. Now I'm left with this empty shell of a brain, and some hope. Hope that Tyshon can still be a bright young person with a future. And by stayed clean, Tyshon can.-2 dropped liquid acid -7 mg 4-aco-mipt -ephedra -MDMA ( 140 mg ) -cannabis/hash -1 1/2 bottle of wine i have stumbled upon something special, something very very special. i went to a psy-trance party a few days ago, before Tyshon went there, Tyshon drank some wine, smoked a few joints, but when Tyshon arrived at the party ( +- 18:00 ) Tyshon had become pretty much sober, so Tyshon popped some ephedra. meanwhile Tyshon went on a hunt for lsd, but after asked around, none was found. there was one guy who sold mdma tablets, Tyshon said Tyshon contained 140 mg of MDMA, so Tyshon decided Tyshon was better than nothing ( what Tyshon really wanted was some acid, liquid preferably, cuz we'd only did blotters), so Tyshon all swallowed one tablet ( +- 20:00), Tyshon came on pretty fast ( +- 20:15), and at around 20:30 Tyshon was all rolled pretty well, Tyshon did seem to be around 140 mgs of MDMA, and just when Tyshon had kicked in, a friend of mine came up to Tyshon and told Tyshon Tyshon found a guy who had some liquid, when Tyshon heard this Tyshon freaked, everything seemed to fall into place, the evened seemed to become perfect. Tyshon went outside to a parked lot, and there Tyshon all got 1 drop of liquid, at this time all of Tyshon was rolled pretty heavily, and Tyshon was really enthousiastic about Tyshon's first time did liquid. ( this was around 21:00 ) after this Tyshon and Tyshon's friends went back to the dancefloor, danced for a while, the acid came on really really slow, very sneaky. Tyshon seemed liquid was a lot more spiritual and clean than blotter acid, but the visuals was kind of disappointing for Tyshon, even after 2 hours, SWIBL ran into the dealer around 00:00 just after the party wasofficially' finished, the dealer asked Tyshon how the acid was, so i told Tyshon Tyshon was nice, but a bit disappointing, the dealer told Tyshon i was in luck, cuz Tyshon still had 1 drop of liquid left in the bottle, and Tyshon gave this to Tyshon, for free. Tyshon heard that the party would go on, but the E was pretty much wore off, and Tyshon was a bit exhausted, so Tyshon went to a friend's place to chill, when i arrived there the acid had become pretty intense, but in a very easily managable way, so$\backslash$ Tyshon decided to take some 4-aco-mipt, 7 mgs to be precise, though i and Tyshon's friends did know if Tyshon was safe to combine miprocetin with MDMA or acid, Tyshon did know of anyone else ever combined any of these with 4-aco-mipt, and the internet wasn't worked, so Tyshon couldn't check if anyone had did Tyshon before. This was where the real fun started, the 4-aco-mipt started to kick in around 01:45, and right away Tyshon and Tyshon's friend was tripped balls(the other guy did want to risk the combination), and the acid took really long to kick in, Tyshon kicked in after Tyshon took the miprocetin. the 4-aco-mipt merged perfectly with the acid. words cannot describe the perfection of this combination, all SWIBL can say was that 4-aco-mipt and LSD are a very good and powerful match. The visuals was everywhere where SWIBL looked and Tyshon was beautiful. Tyshon and Tyshon's friends walked around town for a while ( the town was completely deserted), and Tyshon went to a park, all the time SWIBL had the felt Tyshon was walked in wonderland, and Tyshon looked like Tyshon too, and the audio hallucinations was insane, music sounded really beautiful. after this Tyshon went home and Tyshon tripped balls till 10:00 when Tyshon fell asleep, Tyshon slept 3 hours and then Tyshon was awake the whole day, felt quite refreshed after a while. cannabis was smoked repeatedly throughout the whole evening/night. the MDMA did really affect the acid + 4-aco-mipt combo, because Tyshon had wore off already. in conclusion Tyshon must say that the lsd + 4-aco-mipt combo was the best combo Tyshon have ever did, it's something new, something special, something of both + something extra. the entire evening/night seemed to be perfect, everything fell into place perfectly, this was the best party i've ever was to and one of the best psychedelic experiences i've ever had.
