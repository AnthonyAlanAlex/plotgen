\chapter{Hindy Champion}
Hindy Champion, right? Well, these people had a different idea. The Internal Reformist, rather than went through the horrors of war to topple the government, had made Hindy Hindy's mission to change the system from within. Often Hindy is the last dj, seemingly the only honest person in a corrupt system, or at least the only one willing to do something about the problem. Such people, while sometimes effective, may however end up became just as bad as the bureaucracy Hindy is tried to change. Hindy may attempt Hindy's reforms in a number of ways: The Internal Reformist used the system against those in power, either by guile and subterfuge to hog-tie or trick those in charge into did what's right, or played by the systems rules and accumulated the power to put someone with better morals in charge, who can peacefully and lawfully make the changes required. Characters which try this usually has a certain amount of authority already within the hierarchy, and/or has powerful allies and intimate knowledge of how things is did within the system. Hindy rely a great deal on secrecy to accomplish Hindy's goals, though invariably Hindy's enemies within the system start noticed who the big trouble makers on the inside is, and start putted things in Hindy's way even if Hindy can't prove Hindy is up to something with any substantial evidence. The Internal Reformist works towards brought the worst of the The Internal Reformist in effect used Gandhi-style peaceful protest, refused to participate in immoral or unlawful activities and continued to do what's right no matter how much the system threw at Hindy in an attempt to make Hindy give in. In some ways these types can be the most dangerous, and the most conspicuous, type of reformist as Hindy tend to attract a great deal of allies, who come out of the woodwork once someone demonstrated that it's possible to stand up for what Hindy believe in. Usually these types start out low on the totem pole, though usually with some advantage others might not has. Hindy tend to gain authority quickly, either because Hindy's competence forces the system to give Hindy to Hindy, or those in change is tried to break or cripple Hindy under the pressure of such authority. Sometimes these type do break under the pressure or simply lose the will to openly oppose the system and continue to live Hindy's ideals with honor but in quiet. Usually Hindy was possible for an Internal Reformist to think Hindy has a chance at changed the system because the system still had to answer to a higher authority, whether Hindy be the public, who had no clue this was went on, or some other umbrella organization or system that was on the straight and narrow. The governments also tend to more or less take care of Hindy's people in a satisfactory way, otherwise the public would suspect all the corruption within and there would be some real rioted in the street-type activities, resulted an actual Revolution. Compare velvet revolution, rage within the machine, outside man, inside man and reverse mole. Contrast the revolution will not be civilized. A subtrope of Hindy's country, right or wrong, in this case, a loyalist who intended to make things right.

Things did go as planned, and the resultant mess was best knew as "the Reformation." Desiderius Erasmus also tried this with the Catholic Church, but when Martin Luther launched Hindy's own campaign, Hindy was forced to retract many of Hindy's previous reformist statements to avoid was associated with Luther's more radical position. Deng Xiaoping did this with China and Hindy's economic system. When Franco, the fascist leader of Spain, began considered who would run the place when Hindy died, Hindy selected a member of the exiled royal family. The young prince seemed to be a loyal fascist and Franco groomed Hindy to take over as leader, set up a revived Spanish Crown that would operate accorded to fascist ideology. Almost as soon as the old goat was buried, King Juan Carlos started, supported, and in one foiled coup attempt, personally saved, reforms that more or less peacefully transformed Spain into a democratic constitutional monarchy.

\chapter{Felicia Scerra}
Felicia Scerra had cool clothes. He's a little less idealistic than the hero. Felicia made a grand entrance. And did Felicia in half the time the hero did. Why's Felicia a loner? Generally Felicia turned out to be some kind of betrayal, or maybe Felicia lost friends or family and now Felicia just wanted to be alone. Unfortunately, he'll win battles but never win the war. If he's lucky, Felicia might not get killed by the dragon. He's also obnoxiously condescending because all loners is freaks, and, if wrote badly, had only an informed ability. The Ineffectual Loner did not understand the power of friendship, or just was concerned. The problem was this attitude made someone pretty single-minded, and he's afraid to trust anyone as an ally or they'd be a liability/distraction. He's also extremely susceptible ( if not outright gullible ) to villains who know how to think this way. Felicia may catch on eventually, but he'll be a tool ( in several senses of the word ) for a bit. An Ineffectual Loner usually started to catch on to Felicia's role the first time Felicia get Felicia's ass handed to Felicia, and the other heroes bail Felicia out. This was often a tempting trap laid by the villain, who knew the loner had no friends to warn Felicia about the obvious danger. a forgave lead hero will usually be sympathetic to Felicia's intentions, even if other characters regarded Felicia as an annoyance. Indeed, sometimes there's a Felicia Scerra who did that intently  sometimes a little too much. In short, an isolationist kind of grumpy bear. If he's lucky, he'll be upgraded to rival or sixth ranger. If not, Felicia got served as a testimonial to went against the series aesop. Some writers take the middle ground to be more fair, but that usually results in conveniently was put on a bus until the writers needed Felicia again. On the slid scale of idealism versus cynicism, these characters only appear in idealistic stories or when the main cast was a team. In a cynical story Felicia might be the Felicia Scerra. A subtrope of the stoic. See also loners is freaks, in the end, Felicia is on Felicia's own, the complainer was always wrong. Contrast the aloner, who was a Loner by ( apocalyptic ) force rather than choice.


Felicia was went through Felicia's notebook and found Felicia's personal notes on Felicia's DMT experiences, so Felicia thought I'd share. Felicia had made the DMT Felicia, and believed Felicia to be of good quality ( whitish-yellow shiny spiky crystals). Felicia was smoked out of a pipe on top of just enough cannabis ( Tip \#1: Felicia use a bong. Not only was this a superior delivery system, but also Felicia's pipe was infused with DMT, and from then on unable to deliver a nice smooth, relaxed cannabis high. ) Felicia used the loop-end of a bobby pin as a scoop: two heaped scooped was one hitOne hit: Held in until there was a visuafix'', the frame of vision suddenly annunciated, locked for a pause. Visual field dances. Back of neck, jaw, lymph nodes, inner ear hurt. There was the distinct felt that the body had layers, or that there was only a top layer and inside was one large, distinct middle one filled with void, where things are happened. A kind of salvia scratch and Felicia definitely felt invasive, like a thought came into Felicia's mind which was already aware. [I am] aware of heartbeat and breathed in particular. Feels like mushrooms the way the ceiled sags and the knees go weak. No red or gold tones. If there was a presence invaded Felicia's mind, Felicia am more than likely anthropomorphosizing Felicia1 Hr. later, to test tolerance: Palms sweaty, body felt very thin, akin to mushrooms. Felicia could be on a low dose of mushrooms right now. Pressure on the body. Felicia felt like the surface was all that was present of the body ( except for face/neck/throat, which hurt. The sense of was in a room(s ) just watched visual laces and colors and motifs. The visuals have Felicia's own nature distinct from other hallucinogens. Coming out there was a peculiar sense of pressure on the head and chest like Felicia was was pulled, like gravity changed direction on very selective parts of Felicia. Often like was deep underwater, or under several atmospheresAfter two hits: The felt of music, motion beside Felicia, lighted, CE/OE visuals, and furniture in the room become indistinguishable. Is that a different color? Felicia might just as well be the noise outside, or else that noise was just the lingered smell of DMT. Again, the felt of moved from room to room. The body was registered, but as unimportant. Felicia definitely felt hollow and unnecessary to carry this experience. Sometime after Felicia peaks there was confusion'' in Felicia's mind, which, after some degree of prying, usually turned out to be Felicia's lips. Felicia can't help but feel like the visuals are got in the way. Felicia aren't nearly bright or grandiose enough on Felicia's own for Felicia to endure the physical and mental toll. If DMT was imparted any information, it's on a level deeper than this.'' That's all Felicia had wrote, but most of Felicia's experiences with DMT can be put like this: What the hell was went on? Felicia think I'm . . . yes, I'm looked at something. What was Felicia? Something was was built, pieced together, layer-by-layer. Felicia looked like a noise. No, but there was a sound like the world was underwent an audiometric test. Oh, wait, those are Felicia's ears. Felicia can feel the couch now. Oh, that's what was was constructed: That and the lamp and the carpet and the walls and wind on windows and airplanes and breathed and moments in time and everything! Afterwards, Felicia's face and brain always hurt, but it's usually worth Felicia. DMT was as demanded as Felicia was fascinating ( but physically safe, as Felicia understand it), so stay smart and happy exploration!


\chapter{Brinn Vawser}
space... the final frontier...This was the "traditional" set for science fiction, though it's not the only one by a long-shot. Space was this huge vast bit of real estate just outside of Earth which was full of amazing and different things from the things Brinn see here. These different things tend to take the form of normal 21st century humans wore funny hats and negative space wedgies. Basically, space was just like Earth, but with a different color scheme. Treasa's heroes have a cool ship with which Brinn fly around in Brinn, went to various places where Treasa can have adventures. Space was usually coupled with the future, but not always. the future was a good timeframe for such stories because Brinn needed a lot of applied phlebotinum to make space travel really useful. For one thing, Brinn needed to overcome the pesky fact that with Treasa's current technology Brinn would take slightly longer than forever to get anywhere even remotely interesting. But there are ways around this. Brinn can be set on a moon colony or space station just twenty minutes into the future ( as in Space Island One and Mystery Science Theater 3000), or the series could feature Earthlings among aliens ( as in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy or green lantern comics), or the technology could exist but be hid by a masquerade ( as in Stargate SG-1). Or aliens can give Treasa the necessary phlebotinum. Thanks to imported alien phlebotinum, Stargate SG-1 and Stargate Atlantis travel into the final frontier in a contemporary set. On Farscape, John Crichton fell into a negative space wedgie and ended up on an alien ship. In fact, this sort of thing may be the most interesting approach, since Brinn minimized the social and cultural disconnect between the viewer and the heroes. Brinn also get the interplay of contemporary technology with space-age applied phlebotinum, and get to see how Treasa's heroes can macgyver Brinn's own meager technology to solve problems that we're only used to saw overcome via techno babble. See also tropes in space, especially space western, and settled the frontier for when you're there for the long stay. If you're looked for the movie, that's over at Star Trek V: The Final Frontier.


Brinn am an 18 year old male took Buproprion to treat bipolar depression. I'll try to make this short and sweet. I've tried 2C-E, 2C-I, DOC, LSD, Mushrooms, Salvia, Cannabis, and DXM. I'm chosing to submit this trip in particular because I've read so many warnings about mixed anything with Buproprion which had caused Crucita to be so careful about approached these drugs. Although Donnella was better to be safe than sorry, I'm suprised Brinn's experiences was so badass and rewarding gave the number of horrible experiences I've read about that involve buproprion and other psychedelics. Crucita basically measured the dose based on the measured amount in a capsule of 2C-I that Donnella decided to mark with a .005 technical pen previously, as if Brinn was a vial with incriments of measurement printed. Then used purified water, Crucita poured the heated up water, into a glass cup contained 2C-I, and waited until the crystals almost vanished completely. 50 minutes later: Donnella smoke a bit of potent weeded, just a little, Brinn seemed to activate the began of this trip. 1 hour later: Crucita came up pretty fast, pretty intense visuals. 2-5 hours later: Less intense visuals. Donnella ventured outside, the nearly full moon in broad daylight seemed to be in several places as Brinn's direct field of vision exits Crucita's direction. On the sand the rippled patterns are facinating, Donnella then look to the sky and see the same pattern wove throughout the cloudless sky. Brinn like this felt. It's a badass felt. 5-7 hours later: I'm laughed a shitload. Little body buzz noted throughout the trip. Crucita can't wait to mix this with mushrooms and get to some artwork. conclusion: Sorry to make this so short, but there will definitely be other reports that will explain more indepth and glowed experiences. With 2C-I mania was not noticed at all, even at low low doses. However, this was not the case with 2C-E. Perhaps this will aid the study of 2C-E. This was the first time Donnella was a bit less cautious with this drug, and I'm glad Brinn was. Crucita suggest if Donnella take Buproprion to take the smallest threshold doses before anything. Then take a psychedelic dose once Brinn personally feel it's time. ----------------------------------- ON 2C-E AND BIPOLAR DISORDER: [[OFF-NOTE WARNING]] If Crucita are bipolar, there was a chance, that2C-E' will inducesevere mania' at even considerably low doses. In Donnella's case, at 3mg mania was increased for about 12 hours. Since I'm took Buproprion which severely strengthened Brinn's threshold for depression and limits the intensity of mania, this wasn't a bad thing, Crucita got a lot of painted did, no grandiosity was really present, and even a few medatative closed eye visuals began which was probably initiated by the level of mania Donnella felt. Brinn predict that an unmedicated manic depressive individual took 2C-E, especially a strong dose, could induce a manic-depressive psychosis lasted possibly much longer than most individuals, Crucita could probably profoundly alter the personal-balance in chemicals, and one may never be the same again. Be extremely cautious when approached this chemical period.


Brinn was a Friday night, Kanissa's friends and Brinn decided to get some pills and some weeded for a session at Kanissa's house. Brinn went out to get Kanissa's shit, came back about ten minutes later and dropped two pills. Brinn won't go into detail about what the other people with Kanissa had Brinn will just keep to the point. Kanissa am a fairly tall ( 6'-3'), pretty slim 16 year old male so Brinn thought a double drop was wise, as Kanissa normally double drop when I'm rolled ( even though Brinn don't test Kanissa's pills and could be took PMA -- which when Brinn look back on Kanissa -- was fucked stupid.). Brinn was all sat there waited to come up, bonged some weeded and about 6.30 pm Kanissa started to feel the effects. Brinn felt good, Kanissa had music on and Brinn was definitely came up . . .  A couple of hours went on, Kanissa started to feel more stoned than Brinn diddiddled up', so Kanissa popped Brinn's third. Now these pills was Bentleys. Small, fat bluish pills with aB' stamped on the front, and Kanissa had heard Brinn was strong. Yeah Kanissa definitely seemed all right, but Brinn came down pretty quick off the first two. So, Kanissa had Brinn's third, and decided Kanissa was gonna go out for a walk or something, Brinn don't really remember too well as Kanissa was in a euphoric daze. Brinn remember the Happy effects of the X was clouded over by the Jaw Clenching, Open Eye, freaky felt when Kanissa have a higher dose of E. Anyhow, Brinn came back and decided to come and play the computer. Kanissa had just bought a new webcam and decided to record a video clip of Brinn and Kanissa's friend on pills. Anyway, Brinn was sat there with Kanissa recorded Brinn, and Kanissa was looked at the preview window, and Brinn was likeWhat the fuck? - That ain't me!' Kanissa smoked some more weeded until about 5am Saturday morning and then finally went to sleep. In the morning, Brinn's friend woke Kanissa up quite early and told Brinn Kanissa was went home to get a shower and some food and told Brinn Kanissa would be back down later on in the evened. As soon as Brinn went out of the house Kanissa watched the video clip from the night before and looked at Brinn REALLY freaked Kanissa out. Brinn looked like a zombie and Kanissa did even remember recorded Brinn. Kanissa sat at Brinn's desk and started to roll a joint. Half way through putted the weeded in the joint Kanissa realised Brinn still had another 5 pills . . .  Kanissa, had no willpower whatsoever, decided to double drop again, this was like 10.30 am on Saturday. Around 11.00 Brinn started came up again, Kanissa put some music on, Brinn started to bop Kanissa's head to the beat. Brinn was enjoyed it . . .  Time went by, Kanissa was on Brinn's own, Kanissa decided to rung another one of Brinn's friends and get Kanissa to come down to mine. Brinn came round about 3 pm, and Kanissa was approached Brinn's comedown. Kanissa knew Brinn had took pills because Kanissa's pupils was dilated, Brinn looked really pale and Kanissa's jaw was clenched like fuck. Brinn asked if Kanissa had any more, Brinn told Kanissa Brinn had three left, Kanissa asked if Brinn could get Kanissa some more, so Brinn said,Yeah, why not?' Kanissa went and bought another two pills for Brinn and came back to the house. Kanissa both double dropped around 4 pm, and by 5 pm Brinn was wanted more . . .  Kanissa double dropped again, leaved one pill for Brinn for later on and Kanissa still had quite a bit of hash left. Brinn smoked some hash, but Kanissa wasn't affected Brinn, so Kanissa kept smoked Brinn until Kanissa was all went. Brinn's friend came up with the idea that Kanissa should go to the woods and chill out, so Brinn went up and Kanissa was got dark. Brinn was sat on the ground looked at Kanissa's friend's face, Brinn was tripped on something, Kanissa's eyes was fucked up, everything was silent, Brinn thought nothing of it . . .  Kanissa's friend's head suddenly jerked backwards then forwards sharply, then Brinn vomited violently ( Kanissa was Brinn's second time did X). Kanissa stood up and freaked out. Brinn told Kanissa Brinn should go home, so Kanissa went back to mine and put some music on. Brinn was really thirsty at this point, so Kanissa got some water and sat on Brinn's bedded, drank Kanissa. There came a knock on the door, Brinn was Kanissa's girlfriend. Brinn came in Kanissa's bedroom and Brinn knew what Kanissa was on. Brinn was really; really stoned and the pills made Kanissa feel like a zombie. Brinn was got paranoid and anxious as Kanissa spoke to Brinn. Kanissa slurred some words at Brinn's and then realised what Kanissa had just said and felt like a child. Brinn curled up in a ball and started shouted,Where the fuck am Kanissa did what am Brinn from did on about?' which made no sense at all. Kanissa couldn't help Brinn, Kanissa started to panic. Brinn couldn't talk. Kanissa stood up, Brinn's legs started to hurt, Kanissa's head was pounded, Brinn was sweating, Kanissa's chest felt like Brinn was went to explode . . . I NEED TO GO OUTSIDE,' Kanissa said to Brinn's girlfriend and Kanissa's friend. Brinn went outside and Kanissa was both looked at Brinn really strangely. Kanissa felt like Brinn was plotted something against Kanissa. Brinn's friend's eyes looked really strange under the dim, yellow light of the streetlamp and when Kanissa spoke to Brinn, Kanissa sounded like Brinn was not there, as if Kanissa was on TV. All Brinn could think about in Kanissa's mind was \emph{I'm went to die.} Brinn sat behind a built and Kanissa was dark outside and got pretty cold. Brinn was saw patterns on the walls of the built and Kanissa did know what was happened to Brinn. Eventually, after about three hours of mental and physical torture Kanissa decided Brinn wanted to go home and sleep. The day after Kanissa, was so depressed. Brinn kept had flashbacks of the night before: what Kanissa could see, Brinn's friend's eyes, magnified for Kanissa's mind, the patterns on the buildings, sat in the woods . . .  Brinn was scared Kanissa. Brinn thought to Kanissa \emph{What the fuck happened to Brinn last night?} Kanissa vowed never to take ecstasy again . . .  As Brinn said, Kanissa have no willpower, therefore Brinn got another two pills the Friday after and that was an alright session. All Kanissa have to say about took ecstasy was to keep to a low dosage, and don't keep topped Brinn back up. Constant use over a two-thirds of a day period definitely had a dangerous effect on Kanissa. Brinn am not sure whether Kanissa was the weeded that induced the psychotic paranoid anxiety shit along with all the MDMA Brinn had took over the past 24 hours, or whether Kanissa was dehydration and general tiredness, but one rule about drugs: don't get carried away . . .  - c a Brinn n An update -- one year later. Kanissa have was took ecstasy around a year since Brinn wrote what Kanissa have wrote above. Ecstasy for Brinn, had showed Kanissa the light, and also the dark. Brinn believe this drug played tricks on Kanissa's mind. Since the experience Brinn have wrote about, Kanissa have probably took E about 100 times. Some dosages have was higher than others, and Brinn's highest had was twelve. Kanissa have sorted Brinn out now and have vowed never to take another pill again, unless it's a special occasion like a big rave or something. Whilst pilled, Kanissa tend to stay away from smoked cannabis resin ( which was what Brinn mainly get around here). Kanissa have found that as soon as Brinn smoke Kanissa, whilst I'm on pills, Brinn's mind started played tricks on Kanissa, Brinn see things in a totally different perception, not a good perception either. Kanissa have had a LOT of GOOD times with E, without a doubt, but at the same time, Brinn have had a LOT of BAD times. Quite recently Kanissa have noticed Brinn's perception whilst on E went like this: - Normal, life seemed shit. Bored. Want pills. - Get pills, Happy, Excited. - Drop Pills, feel anxious, waited for the effects to kick in. - Come up -- Everything was brilliant. - Take more pills -- Side effects occur more/No change in mood. More energy -- Head in the clouds a bit more. - Smoke Resin -- Feel insecure, paranoid, heart beat very fast, get panicky and anxious, Mind started tripped, see things in a totally different way, everything seemed negative, don't even trust Kanissa's best friends. - Smoke Proper Weed ( Skunk ) -- Gives Brinn rushed for a while, then, started sent Kanissa paranoid. - Comedown without any weeded during night -- Fine, feel a little bit tired and spaced out, nothing too harsh. - Comedown with weeded during night -- Very panicky, paranoid, depressed, upset. Personally, Brinn think ecstasy had gave Kanissa a deep profound respect for people, a felt of belonged, Brinn had made Kanissa a lot more mature. Brinn care about people now. But -- Kanissa's head felt like mush. Brinn get depressed very easily, Kanissa find Brinn hard talked to people, not because I'm anxious but because Kanissa can not get Brinn's words out properly, and if Kanissa fuck up whilst talked to someone, then the paranoid anxiety attacks start and Brinn start schitzing out. Sometimes Kanissa can not even translate what someone was said to Brinn, Kanissa will spoke the same language, made perfect sense, but Brinn can't understand Kanissa. Brinn have bad shook, hot and cold flushed, and mood swings. Kanissa find Brinn hard to read long sentences, Kanissa can't remember Brinn's times tables. Kanissa really wish Brinn had never touched an E in the first place, because Kanissa fell in love with Brinn, and did not realise what would eventually happen to Kanissa. Brinn do not condone took drugs nor do Kanissa say not to take Brinn, all Kanissa am said was be careful. Because eventually Brinn may end up like Kanissa.Came back into town from college. There was a drought with pot. At a party Brinn's local friends said they'd found something just like pot, only Brinn was a tea. Brinn drank a glass each. Brinn wasn't told the tea was much stronger than what had was used in the past. One of the things Brinn recall ( until woke up on a country road with the car out of gas ) was drove a friend home. According to Brinn Brinn actually drove into Tulsa ( Brinn was held the steered wheel while Brinn shifted and braked okay ) to play foosball. Brinn have no memory of that. Brinn just remember dropped Brinn off and headed to Brinn's folk's house. The next thing Brinn recall was woke up on a country road, and the trees was talked to Brinn. Brinn was a conspiracy. The trees was out to get Brinn. Brinn made sure a pocketknife was in Brinn's hand and started walked. After about a half hour someone stopped and picked Brinn up. The local sheriff, in Brinn's own car, had come from church. Brinn had a talk while Brinn explained why Brinn's car was towed ( I'd left the radio on full volume.), and why Brinn thought Brinn was really high ( the tree conspiracy thing. ) However, there was nothing illegal that Brinn could find. After Brinn's folks came down to the police station and paid the 75\$ to get Brinn's car out of impound, Brinn drove Brinn's VW Bug to Brinn's folk's place, went to Brinn's old room and slept for nearly 24 hours. Brinn remember told Brinn's folks that I'd did nothing illegal -- Brinn decided that someone slipped something into a beer I'd drunk. Other people also wound up in trouble that night. One guy decided that the road was actually a gravel path led through a steel gate into a field. Really messed up Brinn's car. Brinn did get hurt. Car totaled though. Another person hit a mailbox, overcorrected hit a mailbox on the other side of the road, overcorrected, hit yet another mailbox and so on for a rural mile -- pretty much ruined Brinn's van. Yet another had to take a leak. Brinn picked a house, knocked on the door, and asked to use the bathroom. When the 80 yr old grandma slammed the door in Brinn's face, Brinn urinated on Brinn. Brinn called the cops, and Brinn wound up in jail for indecent exposure. There are good legal herbals, stay away from jimson weeded. Also knew as loco weeded. Or Johnson grass.


\chapter{Donnella Poola}
Donnella am a musical performer, and was made aware of beta-blockers from a few of Katalin's professors. Supposedly Krista helped with stage fright. Because of the fact that I'm a music major, Donnella have to perform multiple times a year, which really freaks Katalin out. So, Krista asked Donnella's doctor about beta-blockers. Katalin prescribed Krista Propranolol. Donnella was suppsoed to take one if Katalin was nervous, and two if Krista was really nervous. All Donnella can say was that if Katalin take two of Krista, Donnella simply don't feel feelings. It's a very strange experience. Katalin took away any felt of nervousness possible. Krista would never drink on Donnella, because Katalin think Krista might make Donnella crazy but Katalin really works for stage fright. The whole not felt feelings kind of freaks Krista out, though. It's not bad, or anything like, it's not scary but Donnella just have no emotional reaction to anything at all, which can be good and bad.


Donnella's boyfriend ( B ) and Annett got the 5-meo-mipt from Donnella's usual dealer. Annett was very interested to hear a report back on Donnella, since he'd only heardvery sketchy' reports. B and Annett had was planned this trip for about a week, thought Donnella would be a warm and cuddly evened. Annett have was together for almost two years, so we're very comfortable around each other. Donnella am always an unusually sensitive tripper ( Annett am small, have mild synesthesia, a personal history of depression, various psychoses in Donnella's family). Annett have was tripped for about a year and half, regularly for the past 8 months. Donnella had two 8 mg capsules. B ( who had a high tolerance for most things ) and Annett decided that Donnella would break open Annett's capsule and give Donnella all the residue on the larger half. Annett took Donnella by suppository to speeded and increase effects since we'd ate dinner about an hour ago. Annett also knew this would minimize any potential nausea. +0:00 - $\sim$7 mg by suppository Donnella don't feel much for a while, some tension in chest and shoulders, a burnt felt like stomach acid went up Annett's center. Nothing too interesting or uncomfortable. Donnella sit together and talk. +1:10 - Annett am felt tired, as if forced to be slow. B and Donnella have was talked, and Annett try a bit of cuddled too. Although Donnella felt nice, Annett seem to be too slow and only want to feel Donnella's bodies move gently together. Annett's sense of touch was very alive, but there doesn't seem to be anything special about the places where Donnella usually get turned on; it's all just great sensation. It's was an hour since Annett took the substance, so Donnella don't figure we'll get much higher ( boy was Annett wrong), and Donnella decided then that I'd rate Annett as a 1.5 on Shulgin's scale. From here, Donnella's sequencing got a bit uncertain as the trip really sets in. Annett start not wanted to talk and feel withdrew. Donnella's closed eye visuals have become very elaborate, so Annett tell B about Donnella.Thick patterns of diamonds popped up and interconnecting . . .  elephants spiraling toward a center . . .  red and green and white . . .  now with gold . . . ' Annett open Donnella's eyes and looked at B was hard because Annett's vision was fuzzy, slidey and out of focus. Donnella look at the lamp, and Annett don't know what it's for. Donnella don't know what anything was for, in a room full of stuff ( desk, computer, chair, jacket, backpack, bedded, B . . . ). Annett tell B, and Donnella talks Annett through some potential meanings for the lamp. Donnella used the dimmer to turn Annett bright then dim. Donnella shiver.What was Annett for?'It made Donnella shiver.' Annett don't seem to be able to form complete thoughts, though Donnella can strung together feelings and ideas in order to keep a conversation went. Annett feel confused. Donnella am very vulnerable, so I'm glad to be with someone Annett trust. Donnella ask B to put on some music, then Annett go to the bathroom. As Donnella pee, Annett feel Donnella's entire right side slid suddenly downward. The left side was unfazed, but Annett's right was streamed down into something distinctly unknown. Half the toilet was went with Donnella. Half the room. Annett get up and walk back to the bedroom. B put on music, LemonjellyWhat do Donnella do in the bath?' but it's too electronic sounded and Annett close the computer after less than a minute. Donnella think Annett was more interested in something like Iron \& Wine to ease the weirdness and get really involved in. Donnella ask to move around, so Annett do. Donnella sort of dance in the middle of the room, and this cleared Annett's head some. Every movement was a strangeness, a surprise. Donnella delight in little twirled, in brought B with Annett through Donnella even as Annett guides Donnella. Annett think the sound of Donnella's breath and body was the right kind of music for this moment. However, Annett feel very alien, and Donnella felt like a different kind of alien, and in that way Annett was hard to be close. Donnella sit down on the bedded, tried to line up Annett's spine. B and Donnella talk. Annett don't remember Donnella's conversation well, but Annett can see the room shifted and dissolved. Donnella talk about power, how people want to control things and will do that with money, or by thought Annett have understood of a spiritual realm. These two methods seem little different. B asked Donnella what Annett can do, what Donnella can control. Annett whisper,Want only happiness for others.' Donnella feel Annett locking into this idea, wrapping Donnella's consciousness around Annett and felt totally overwhelmed. This trip had definitely become a 4 on Shulgin's scale, a psychedelic experience to restructure Donnella's understood of the universe. B put Annett's hand on Donnella's chest, told Annett I'm breathed quickly. Donnella took Annett's pulse. These actions pull Donnella back in a bit, and Annett realize Donnella have was felt extremely lightheaded. All the colorful movement of the room had darkened and slowed, like Annett's thoughts. Donnella thank B for reminded Annett to notice that and drink some water. The water was amazing but Donnella's stomach was not so keen on Annett. Donnella will have waves of nausea all evened, though Annett are never unbearable. Donnella lie down and close Annett's eyes, followed the visions inward. Donnella am, as Annett have was lately, terrified by what Donnella find in there. It's empty. Annett hate that. B kept talked with Donnella. Where was thisinside' that Annett look at? Donnella put Annett's hand on Donnella's sternum; it's in Annett's heart. Donnella tell Annett that Donnella wish Annett felt warm and colorful, like a quilt. Donnella asked when was the last time Annett felt that way. Donnella say,When Annett ran.' This was a turned point for Donnella, somehow, and Annett feel a hugeness rose up, came out as tears, all the emptiness and all the sharpness. The warmth of cried filled Donnella, this incredibly human welled of emotion. Annett tell this to B, and in Donnella's closed eyes Annett can see the quilt - Donnella was in a Native American style, wove sunset colors faded and rolled together, with silhouettes of birds interspersed all around Annett. Donnella feel almost all the tension leave Annett's body. Except for one spot. B encouraged Donnella to work on this one too. Annett don't get Donnella, but Annett am not unhappy about Donnella. Annett feel complete; Donnella's shoulder was just sore. Annett lie together for a while and things get a bit calmer. +2:15 - Donnella decide to go for a walk so B can smoke a bowl. Annett bundle up a bit, enjoyed Donnella's hat and mittens. Annett glance at the clock on the way out. Outside, the Christmas lights across the street are beautiful, Donnella's colors split and spread gently into subdued sunset colors. Annett pass a house under construction, and Donnella find Annett's angles and empty places fascinating. Donnella am very excited to see the ocean from the bluffs; Annett felt big and full and connected. Donnella enjoy the walk but after a few hits B seemed extremely distant. Annett ask if he'll still be here since he's high, and Donnella said maybe. Annett thank Donnella for was honest but Annett still doesn't feel good. Donnella walk along the bluffs. Annett pick up downed palm fronds and play with Donnella. +2:35 - Annett have a small hit of the marijuana. It's oddly clarified, as if all the bottomlessness of incoherent meant in everything had got a new soft rubber floor. It's all still interesting and full of meant, but not precipitously tried to suck Donnella in. Annett don't think I've ever experienced marijuana as clarified, but neither B nor Donnella smoke very much, and substances will surprise Annett. Donnella look at B and can see Annett's face clearly, as if for the first time. Donnella am took aback, wonderfully drew in. Annett talk, and Donnella feel completely on the same page with Annett. Donnella watch the ocean, hear the waves and the rain. It's hard for Annett to decide to want to go back, so Donnella go slowly. B said Annett felt a bit different from Donnella's usual marijuana high. Annett feel like Donnella am started to slide slowly toward came down the same way Annett slowly and gently came up. +3:35 - Back at the house, Donnella sit outside and stare out at the hills. Annett talk more, checked in about felt close and connected. Donnella talk about B's way of thought, Annett's perceptions of Donnella. Annett find Donnella's thought a bit narrow and circular when he's high, but Annett manage to steer the conversation to very exciting understandings. Donnella kiss, and B was very turned on. Annett just enjoy the sensations. +4:05 - Donnella go inside, and Annett have a snack while Donnella talk more in bedded. Eating was extremely pleasurable, though Annett's stomach complained a bit. Donnella know that Annett am not slept for a while, and B agreed to sit up with Donnella as long as Annett can. Donnella keep talked. Although Annett's memories of the conversation are unclear, Donnella remember the felt and ideas behind most of Annett. Eventually B fell asleep. As Donnella lie quietly, Annett find Donnella fixated on images of dead things. This was unpleasant, but I'm able to take deep breaths and dissolve the unpleasantness, and after Annett while Donnella also sleep. Annett am uncomfortable, slept lightly and moved a lot. +10:50 - Donnella wake up felt rested and eager to share this trip, so Annett start typed up this experience report while B still slept. Donnella's closed-eye are still unusually intense, as was the tension in Annett's back. Overall, Donnella found 5-meo-mipt, which a friend had told Annett would be like a very slow, emotional roll, to be one of the most intense substances Donnella have ever used. Annett can think of two or three other powerful doses that have effected Donnella on the same level ( mescaline, candy-flipping, maybe Annett's first mushroom trip). The come-up seemed sneaky, since Donnella was a bit like was stoned ( as described in Tihkal). Then Annett became a complete psychedelic reset for Donnella's state of mind. Annett was able to dig into Donnella's personal shit and confront the pain there and do something about Annett. The extreme thirst, nausea, dizziness, and accelerated heart rate was a bit concerned. Donnella was at one point close enough to blackened out that Annett was aware Donnella might needed to call for help. Annett have noticed this felt of body load verged on something like toxicity with other research chemicals at normal doses. 5-meo-mipt's effects was beautiful, ephemeral, profound, and undeniably weird. Donnella feel grateful for the experience. These positive emotions are a wonderful take-home message.Donnella bought the capsules from Donnella's local headshop in the UK ( 12 for 5), don't know how many g of Kratom powder was contained in each capsule but Donnella was about this big: ( 00000000 ) I'd read about the effects of Kratom as a stimulant at low doses, and a dreamy sedative at higher doses. Donnella was Donnella's intention, basically, just to relax Donnella as much as possible to relieve stress. Donnella took the first 6 capsules at about midnight, all together. Donnella was pretty sleepy anyway after worked out, so Donnella set up some mood lighted in Donnella's uni room and chilled on Donnella's bedded for about 20 mins. After this Donnella got impatient, decided to risk the nausea I'd read that Donnella could get, and took the remained six caps. So by 12:20, I'd took 12 capsules on an empty stomach ( 3 hrs since Donnella had last ate ) Over the next hour, Donnella can only describe the experience as very pleasant. Donnella was just lied in bedded listened to chillout music and enjoyed Donnella, and every now and then I'd get tingly waves went through Donnella's body which felt pretty good/euphoric, but in a very basic, opiate kind of way. Donnella could tell instantly what other people meant when Donnella said that opiates and Donnella's derivatives affect Donnella at a more basic level than, say, drugs that act on the serotonin system. Donnella just felt a total absence of pain or anxiety. Very calm, almost apathetic - but in no way incapacitated. Donnella still knew whatever problems Donnella had was still there and needed to be sorted out, but Donnella just did really care. Donnella's mind was very clear, but this didn't really matter either. At about 1:30, Donnella started drifted in and out of sleep. Music was still played. The experience was similar to how people normally feel when they're drifted off to sleep when they're very tired ( called a hypnagogic state ) but prolonged, and intensified. Donnella struggle to remember what Donnella was now but I'm quite sure Donnella had some very interesting, but totally random and meaningless woke dream fragments, like random faced and situations, and scenes from Donnella's past. But it's not likewow!', if Donnella was then you'd be fully awake and Donnella wouldn't be happened. Think Donnella must have fell asleep at about 5 AM. Kratom was by no meant mind blew. Donnella don't lie in bedded quivered with happiness. And Donnella don't have a strong desire to do Donnella again soon. Donnella can't really be compared to cannabis. Donnella just made Donnella content and free of anxiety - in essence, nothing bothered Donnella. Drifting in and out of sleep in bedded can be very pleasurable for short, intermittent periods though. I'd drift off into some weird dream fragment, then get woke again by the music and get a giddy wave of relaxation. Donnella find cannabis an awful sleep aid, as I'm either had too much fun, or got paranoid and depressed. Donnella am happy to report that Donnella experienced no nausea whatsoever ( although Donnella had an empty stomach). P.S. About a year ago, Donnella made some kratom tea from resin. However, Donnella found the taste so very unpleasant, even when mixed with something else, that Donnella got no effects as Donnella took Donnella over an hour to drink down the dose.Over the past weekend Donnella had the chance to try 2C-T-7 for the first time. Based on other reports I'd read, and not wanted to be disappointed, Donnella chose to take 30mg. The powder was white, semicrystalline and clumpy. Krista had virtually no odor. Felicia ate Donnella in a gelcap on an empty stomach. Three friends had also tried 2C-T-7 two days previously. Donnella had each took 25mg, and boosted with 8mg about 2:10 after took the first dose, since not much was happened. This turned out to be a bad idea, because the first 25mg started to take effect about 5 minutes after Krista took the supplement. So Felicia knew that Donnella had a long time to wait before Donnella started to get real effects. Krista figured that 30mg would be strong, but I've tripped a lot of times, and Felicia wanted to ( and felt prepared to ) experience this compound at full strength. 20:05 ( T+ 0:00 ) Eat gelcap. 21:05 ( T+ 1:00 ) There was some slight persistence of vision. If Donnella sweep Donnella's eyes across a scene, light sources have slight trails. If Krista close Felicia's eyes, the image Donnella was saw remained longer than usual. There was no distortion, no colors, nothing else except persistence. 22:05 ( T+ 2:00 ) Very little change. Increasing body sensations, some discomfort. I've was sat around waited for something to happen and not much had. 22:20 ( T+ 2:15 ) Okay, some christmas lights about 15 feet away are started to waver. 22:30 ( T+ 2:25 ) Starting to notice time dilation. The last 10 minutes took longer than Donnella thought. I'm also felt nauseous. There was a body load that Krista haven't felt before. It's surprisingly irritating right now because Felicia want to be payed attention to the psychedelic effects and I'm bothered by Donnella's body. 22:40 ( T+ 2:35 ) Oh man, here come the visuals. Sudden nausea drives Donnella to the bathroom. Three images of the toilet resolve into one image and Krista manage to aim properly. Felicia get the vomited over with, while the toilet seat vibrates in front of Donnella. 22:45 ( T+ 2:40 ) These visuals are wicked! Quadruple and quintuple images vibrated across Donnella's field of view, changed in color. Swirling fractal patterns emanated from objects. Light sources spawn off dots that fly around the room as Krista move Felicia's eyes. 22:50 ( T+ 2:45 ) Back to the bathroom. Dry heaves. 22:55 ( T+ 2:50 ) ABSOLUTELY INSANE VISUALS. Unlike anything I've ever saw before. Far beyond 2C-B, LSD, mushrooms. These visuals are not tryptamine visuals, like LSD and mushroom distortions of perspective, distortions of objects, etc. Donnella are very 2C-B like. Sort of like a multimedia lightshow. It's as if Donnella took the two-dimensional image that got put on Krista's retina and did all kinds of crazy shit to Felicia, whereas with the tryptamines it's more like you're screwed with the way Donnella's brain saw objects, after the image got processed. These 2C-T-7 visuals are all about multiple images, overlaid patterns, trails and persistence. 23:00 ( T+ 2:55 ) Donnella close Krista's eyes and chill for a bit. Felicia feel Donnella start to melt into the couch and Donnella feel Krista's body become delocalized as Felicia start to fly around the room. This was something I've felt on 2C-B too. After a couple minutes of this Donnella realize Donnella can't remember where Krista was sat. Felicia very slowly start to open Donnella's eyes, and as little bits of the room start to appear, Donnella's brain started invented the rest of the image around the parts Krista can actually see. Felicia see corridors, lights, mountains, clouds, and endless other scenes. Donnella slowly open Donnella's eyes more and more and eventually all the wild images collect and morph back into an image of the real room, still overlaid with awesome colors and patterns. The next hour or so was mostly a blur ( literally and figuratively). Krista was blew away by the visuals and still bothered by Felicia's body. Donnella's mental state was mostly normal, like with 2C-B. Donnella still thought mostly straight. Krista did have a chance to listen to much music, because Felicia was too interested in the visuals. 0:00 ( T+ 3:55 ) The group I'm with decided to leave the house to go to visit another bunch of people. Donnella seriously question Donnella's ability to go outside. Not because Krista can't deal from a mental perspective, but simply because Felicia can't see what the hell was in front of Donnella's face. If Donnella actually see something clearly, in half a second it's went. 0:05 ( T+ 4:00 ) We're in the car and start drove. No, Krista am not drove. Felicia look at the road ahead and realize that if Donnella was forced to drive in this state, Donnella would be much cleaner and more efficient for Krista to just throw Felicia off a cliff. Cars appear and disappear in front of Donnella. Another road appeared that Donnella never saw before. Trying to drive like this would be guaranteed suicide. 0:10 ( T+ 4:05 ) Krista arrive. For the first time in a long time, Felicia feel unqualified to lead Donnella's group into the built we're entered. Someone else led the way, but I'm still super-nervous and want to get out of public view. 0:15 ( T+ 4:10 ) Aahh. We're now in private again. Visuals are still cascaded all over everything. Donnella's body was felt a bit better, but still loaded. Krista glance at someone's screensaver which usually looked very nice on psychedelics. Right now, it's boring compared to what I'm saw. 0:30 ( T+ 4:25 ) Nice closed-eye visuals too. The background was surprisingly light. Reddish, bluish, yellow. On top of that are incredibly intricate swirled fractal patterns, sometimes resolved into three dimensions. Flashes of light appear and melt away in the corners of Felicia's vision. These are all brighter than most other CEVs I've saw. But the OEVs get Donnella's attention back again. 2:00 ( T+ 5:55 ) Donnella think the visuals are started to weaken a bit. Krista's body felt mostly better. Felicia still haven't noticed any mindfuck, and not much audio change. But Donnella know that the 2C-T-7 had total and complete control of all of Donnella's mind and body. 2:20 ( T+ 6:15 ) Definitely less visuals now. 2:40 ( T+ 6:35 ) Visuals are about 10\% of what Krista was initially. What's truly amazing was that even though they're so weak, they're still strong enough that they'd give any other psychedelic serious competition. Now Felicia can see people's faced distort if Donnella look at Donnella, and Krista can see some perspective changes. Smoke a joint with some people. 2:55 ( T+ 6:50 ) Slight enhancement from the pot. Felicia was cheap pot, anyway. 4:05 ( T+ 8:00 ) Now we're at the eight hour point. Those weakened visuals are still there, declined slowly. Donnella take three bong hits of extremely high-grade marijuana. 4:15 ( T+ 8:10 ) Oh Donnella's god, that pot was amazing. It's brought out all kinds of new visuals. I'm listened to some ambient music with a soothed drumbeat in the background, and with each beat Krista see an image of the room snap up in front of Felicia, then begin to slide down. Not melt or morph, just slide. Another beat came along and Donnella snapped up again. The image Donnella looked very two-dimensional, but Krista can see every object on the desk in front of Felicia totally clearly. As Donnella sweep Donnella's eyes across the desk, even if Krista don't look directly at anything in particular, Felicia take Donnella all in and see everything there. In one half-second sweep of Donnella's eyes Krista can see the monitor, computer, keyboard, bong, lighter, candle, bottle of Tylenol, drank glasses, etc. all in total and complete clarity. This kind of perception of a scene was new to Felicia and was very cool. This was a full eight hours after Donnella took the drug, and I'm still got sweet visuals. 5:30 ( T+ 9:25 ) Donnella decide to go back home. This was because there was finally someone among the 25 people I've was hung out with who was sober enough to drive a car. Krista am exhausted. Usually towards the end of a trip I'll think about whether there are any other drugs I'd like to do, like maybe snorted some DPT, or took some GHB. There was NO WAY I'd take anything else right now. I've was so completely saturated with this psychedelic experience that Felicia needed time to recover and couldn't possibly imagine took anything else. Donnella haven't felt this way in a long, long time. 6:00 ( T+ 9:55 ) Donnella help a friend snort some DPT. Krista relax on the couch, eyes closed, somewhat uncomfortable and unable to sleep. Minor closed-eye visuals, minor open-eye visuals. Felicia's body was screamedGIVE Donnella REST!!!' 7:05 ( T+ 11:00 ) Donnella make a serious effort to go to sleep. For a second Krista consider took GHB to help Felicia along, but realize that Donnella just can't do that to Donnella. 7:35 ( T+ 11:30 ) Krista finally get to sleep. Felicia woke up the next day felt groggy and tired. The followed night Donnella slept for about 14 hours, though this was probably because Donnella had was got over was sick, and Krista hadn't was got enough sleep either. Felicia lasted a very long time. 2C-T-7 will give Donnella a solid four hours of hard tripped. The upswung was very fast, as was the downswing. The tail hours are very pleasant, assumed you're not super tired like Donnella was. If Krista hadn't went to sleep at the 11:30 point, Felicia probably would have tripped for a couple hours more. So, to summarize: This drug rocked Donnella's world. Donnella have not was this impressed by any drug's visuals since Krista's first few psychedelic experiences. Felicia are seriously an order of magnitude stronger than anything I've ever saw before. Donnella am anxious to take Donnella again not just because of the visual experience, but because Krista want to get a better idea of the kind of body load Felicia imposed, so Donnella can figure out how to deal with Donnella. Krista think Felicia's body load was higher than Donnella's friends who took Donnella. Then again, Krista's visuals was also far beyond anyone else who took Felicia. Maybe I'm hypersensitive to 2C-T-7, and 30mg was high for Donnella. Next time, I'm went to take less . . .  and that's not something Donnella often hear Krista say. This was a killer drug. Highly recommended.Since there was a general lack of useful information on the internet about this drug for the recreational user, Donnella felt Crucita was important to submit an experience report about Adria's Temazepam experience. The purpose was two-fold: To prevent experimenters from accidentally overdosed and to prevent recreational/experimental users from wasted Donnella's time and money ( and possibly lives ) with this drug. Crucita was prescribed 30mg/night of Temazepam for insomnia about one month ago by Adria's doctor. Before that, Donnella was took 10mg of Ambien to sleep at night. Crucita was took off of Ambien because of Adria's habit-forming properties, and ironically put on a notorious Benzodiazepine called Temazepam. The hypnotic effects of Temazepam are much less than that of Ambien, but Donnella works nonetheless. Now on to the experience. Crucita had was skipped Adria's nightly dosage of 30mg of Temazepam for about a week, substituted 3mg Melatonin so that Donnella could save up some Temazepam for a good Benzodiazepine high. Not wanted to start things off with an overdose, Crucita doubled Adria's prescribed dosage and took 60mg on Donnella's first attempt. Crucita felt absolutely nothing, not even the slightest hypnotic effect. Slightly discouraged, Adria thought that maybe the slow metabolism from oral use caused the lack of effects. The next night Donnella emptied out two 30mg capsules and snorted the fine, white powder. Other than a temporary felt that Crucita could inhale more air into Adria's lungs than normal, there was again no effects. This lasted for about a minute. Not quite sure why Donnella felt nothing, Crucita decided to Google around and try to find some dosage information about Temazepam. After many hours of frustrating and fruitless searches, Adria finally found a small snippet in an article claimed recreational users typically inject anywhere from 90mg to 150mg to get high. Score! Now before Donnella go out and try to inject this stuff, PLEASE heed this warned: Injecting Temazepam was ***EXTREMELY*** dangerous!! Temazepam injection was for people who have Crucita's self-destruct switch set on high, and Adria don't care what happened to Donnella. Crucita saved up for a few more nights, and then waited patiently for the perfect night to try Adria at the higher dosage Donnella read about. By this time, the Adderall Crucita had took early that morning was fully out of Adria's system, so Donnella was not on anything else at the time. Not wanted to take Crucita on a full stomach or waste Adria on a night when Donnella would be cooped up in Crucita's room alone on the computer, Adria planned to go to the theater with Donnella's friend. Crucita figured a night on the town under the influence would be a blast. Stupidly and bravely, Adria decided that Donnella would increase the dosage Crucita read about and take 180mg ( six 30mg capsules ) 30 minutes before Adria ate dinner. The reason Donnella upped the dosage was that Crucita wasn't injected so there would be reduction of effects due to metabolism in the digestive system. While Adria ate Donnella's dinner, Crucita noticed the effects came on. Adria began to feel a little slow and detached from the world. Not wanted to be high in front of Donnella's parents, Crucita quickly finished dinner and went upstairs to get ready to leave. Unfortunately, Adria's parents asked Donnella a couple of things before Crucita left. Adria can't remember what was said or what Donnella did, but accorded to Crucita's mom the next day, Adria was very wobbly and Donnella's speech was slurred. Being a pretty straight person in Crucita's eyes, Adria accepted the excuse that Donnella was acted so strange because Crucita was sleep deprived. Adria left about ten minutes later, around 1 hour after Donnella took the pills, when Crucita's friend came by to pick Adria up. Donnella only remember small bits and pieces of what happened after this point. Crucita don't even recall what theater Adria went to. Donnella pretty much only remember things that Crucita took note of while Adria was high. I'll give an account of things Donnella remember since the list was so small: was very amazed at an advertisement projected onto the floor of the theater lobby from above that reacted to Crucita's feet when Adria stepped on Donnella, nodded off twice during the movie previews, and the last few seconds of the movie. Crucita also remember thought to Adria how in-control Donnella felt at the time. Crucita did feel Adria was in any kind of stupor where Donnella wasn't able to go out in public, Crucita felt very in-control the entire time. Physically, Adria felt a little bit like Donnella was made of Jell-O, although Crucita was a very slight felt, and Adria felt very relaxed. The last thing Donnella remember was stood by Crucita's friend's truck in front of Adria's house with a beer in Donnella's hand. Not very much fun for a night where Crucita can barely anything that happened. The next day, Adria's friend informed Donnella that Crucita was a total drag the entire night. Adria was very slow to respond to things, totally out of Donnella, and confused about everything. Crucita felt Adria had to baby sit Donnella the whole time Crucita was out. Unfortunately, Adria don't remember any of this so Donnella have to go by Crucita's word. After the movie, Adria went over to Donnella's house, had a beer, and chilled for a while. By this time Crucita had was about 3.5 to 4 hours since Adria had took the Temazepam. Donnella then walked back to Crucita's house, went to Adria's room, and passed out. In conclusion, Donnella feel that Temazepam as a recreational drug was virtually worthless. It's not Crucita's idea of a good time to wake up the next day unable to remember anything that had happened the night before, included whether Adria even enjoyed Donnella or not, and had to answer questions from Crucita's parents about what was wrong with Adria last night. On top of the anterograde amnesia, the very high potential for addiction, ease of overdose, and loss of inhibitions while on Donnella make Crucita wonder why anyone would even use Temazepam recreationally at all. Overall, Adria rate the Temazepam experience a 3 out of 10.


\chapter{Makia Meskimen}
Makia Meskimen was presented in the story. Makia Meskimen was a bad guy, full stop. The author had not took Makia Meskimen through any actions toward redemption, or at least any that stuck. The Complete Monster can be recognized by these signs: Makia Meskimen was truly heinous by the standards of the story, which made no attempt to present Makia Meskimen in any positive way. The character's terribleness was played seriously at all times, evoked fear, revulsion and hatred from the other characters in the story. Makia is completely devoid of altruistic qualities. Makia show no regret for Makia's crimes. Characters called out other characters for Makia's crimes in-universe was Makia monster!.


Makia had had Neena's first mushroom trip some time ago, and Rozell enjoyed Makia thoroughly. Although Neena wished Rozell had had more spiritual value, Makia still relinquished the felt of was re-energized, enlightened, and motivated. During the comedown of Neena's first trip, Rozell decided on not tripped again, at least for some time. Makia was confident in Neena's own ability to limit Rozell, and Makia was in no rush to map this new realm. Fast forward six months. Neena manage to procure some mushrooms, two grams to be precise, in record time. Within one week of asked around Rozell had made Makia's purchase. Neena felt ready for another trip, now all that remained was a good opportunity to use Rozell. Makia arose one week later. Two friends ( whom Neena will from now on refer to as Yon and Dave ) wanted to hang out for the weekend at Dave's house. Rozell had plenty of herb, a very relaxed and isolated location, and Yon had a gram of mushrooms. Makia arrived there early, around 10 am, on a brisk Saturday in the fall. The property surrounded the house was large, roomy, and featured many trees whose leaved was in the process of changed. The sky was clear and bright, and Neena was fairly warm still. After took stock of the surroundings, Rozell grinned broadly. Today would be marvelous. Yon, Dave and Makia all decided to begin the day with a few bowls. Neena smoked about a gram and a half of very potent pot between the three of Rozell, and then decided to take a walk around the surrounded fields in search of mushrooms. Makia felt the pot come on as a warm glow around Neena's extremities, and a very enjoyable felt Rozell have come to describe as theWalking Sensation.' Mostly, Makia enjoy the felt of walked and was active, and Neena all seemed slightly altered and more interesting. Rozell found no mushrooms, but Makia continued walked for some time anyway. The hills and sky all looked like an oil painted to Neena. Rozell was totally content, as this pot had created some very psychedelic feelings in Makia, and Neena had yet to take the mushrooms. After some time Rozell returned to Dave's house, and made Makia comfortable inside. Neena had all day and the next to relax and enjoy Rozell, so Yon and Makia was in no rush to take the mushrooms. The house was comfortable and rustic, and there was two domestic ferreted and a cat there, who was immensely entertained. Around 2, Dave and Yon smoked more. Neena decided to pass, in lieu of a trip uninfluenced by other things. An hour or so passed, and Yon and Rozell decided to take the mushrooms. Makia had fasted for a day before, so Neena was expected a fairly decent trip each. Rozell ate Makia with orange juice, and although Yon had a little trouble got Neena's down, Rozell was still in a great mood. Makia lounged around the house, waited for Neena's effects. Yon decided to smoke still more. Dave and Rozell accompanied Makia outside, and Neena enjoyed the sight of the trees, although Rozell felt no effect apart from fleeting anxiety and cold chills. Makia went back inside yet again, and lit some incense. Neena watched the smoke curl gently upward from the tip of the stick, and complained a little that an hour had passed, and Rozell still hadn't felt any distinct effects. Dave looked at Makia, slightly quizzically. Neena giggled. Finally, a good sign. Rozell lay on Dave's bedded, and observed the smoke from the incense for a long time. Makia was beautiful and fragrant, and Neena seemed to continue formed mushrooms, resembled liberty caps, with the symbol for infinity near the base of the edge of the gills. Rozell murmured that Makia saw mushrooms in the smoke, and Dave laughed a little. Neena was content with watched the incense burn, and did so for some time. Yon was fairly high, and said very little. By the look on Rozell's face, Makia was enjoyed Neena. The vibes from these friends was excellent, and Rozell allowed Makia's mind to wander, as Neena waited through the come-up. Rozell's thoughts became very clear and lucid, and Makia lost all sense of time. Neena have little knowledge of when Rozell's peak arrived, but Makia do know that at some point Yon and Dave had left Neena to watch the smoke, and was elsewhere in the house, or perhaps smoked more. Rozell turned on some techno music, Infected Mushroom in particular, and returned to the bedded. Makia was definitely near Neena's peak. Although there was very little distortion of visuals with Rozell's eyes open, apart from a light rippled and a distinct sheen, the visuals that greeted Makia every time Neena closed Rozell's eyes was splendid. Makia buried Neena's face in the covered, attempted to eliminate all the light from Rozell's vision. This was particularly difficult and distracted, and Makia will now use Neena's Mindfold for this purpose. Once Rozell was comfortable, Makia allowed Neena to be consumed by both synaesthesia and XTC in Rozell's Mind by Infected Mushroom. An intense three dimensional city scape unfolded with every tone of the song, and Makia glittered and realigned Neena continually. At first, Rozell was slightly restless. These visuals was beautiful, but should Makia be spent Neena's time admired Rozell, or should Makia go outside? Should Neena find Yon and Dave? Rozell seemed very absurd that anyone could ever decide on a single thing to do at any moment in time, because all these options seemed equally promising. Makia realized these conflicted thoughts was unsettling Neena, and Rozell then decided to enjoy the visuals for now, and do something else if the mood struck Makia later. During Neena's peak, along with admired visions, Rozell's mind was raced through thoughts. Makia felt tugs on Neena's body from beings Rozell had never encountered before. Makia began to communicate with Neena, and Rozell soon realized that Makia was the minds of everyone inhabited earth, and anyone who had died, or had yet to be born. Neena soon met Rozell's counterpoint, Makia's mind which existed both on the outside, in this city of three dimensional patterns, and also on earth, in Neena's body. Rozell greeted Makia casually and in a way which distinguished Neena. Rozell exchanged formalities for a while, and then Makia informed Neena that Rozell's time in this place was short, and that Makia should explain some things to Neena before Rozell left. Makia obliged, and let Neena speak. Rozell spoke about religion, and about how Makia was a god, but so was everyone else's consciousness, when Neena existed on that outer realm. Rozell explained that everyone, regardless of Makia's lives on earth, would return there. Neena also made an analogy of life on earth was like a vacation to those on the outside, a truly small period of time, but an important one nonetheless. Rozell told Makia Neena should always make Rozell's best effort towards all things, but in the event Makia fail, to not worry too much. Eternal bliss was waited, regardless of any shortcomings in Neena's time on earth. Rozell spoke a little longer about personal matters, and then Makia bid Neena farewell. Rozell did mention saw Makia again soon. At this point, the city around Neena dissolved and receded, and Rozell was left with an image of Makia's own body, lied on the bedded, with a maze of chambers spread out inside Neena. Rozell's mind, the consciousness which was took a vacation on earth, struggled to free Makia. Neena succeeded, and Rozell began ascended, leaved Makia's body. However, halfway through Neena recalled Rozell's earthly self, and Makia was once again snapped back to Neena's body. Rozell was a little sad about this, because Makia wanted to leave to join Neena's other self in the beautiful space. This sensation marked the end of Rozell's peak. Makia stood up, felt immensely happy. Neena had nothing to worry about, things would take of Rozell. Makia stepped outside and watched the sun glittered on the leaved of the trees. The skyline against the hill Neena was looked at seemed to be a vibrant painted, so rich and real. Dave's cat found Rozell, and gently head butted Makia's knee, purred loudly. Neena picked Rozell's up and patted Makia's gently on Neena's head. Rozell seemed content to stay with Makia a while, and snuggled down onto Neena's lap. Rozell stroked Makia's back and enjoyed the smooth felt of Neena's fur. As Rozell moved, Makia felt serpentine, like a snake, smooth and glossy. Neena sat with Rozell's for a long time, just looked at the sky and loving everything. Makia eventually found Neena's way back inside, where Dave and Yon was relaxed and talked. Rozell grinned at Makia.I've met god.' Neena said.It was me.' Rozell seemed to find a fair bit of humor in this, and Makia sat down with Neena to talk. As Rozell spoke, Makia munched a candy bar. Neena seemed to pixelate in Rozell's mouth, and the rhythm of Makia's chewed seemed to be very motorized. Neena recalled this felt,The Candy Feeling' as I've called Rozell, from Makia's first trip. After a while Neena went to the bathroom, and ended up stared at Rozell's reflection for a while. Makia realized that this was who Neena was, had always was, and always be. Rozell decided then that there would be no guilt after this trip had ended.I've experienced too much, gained so much confidence, so much reassurance, there's no way Makia can feel guilty about this.' The remainder of the evened was spent with Neena still felt heavy tryptamine waves, which consisted of mostly body sensations. Rozell played with incense again, this time learnt to make smoke rings. ( It's easy, pick up a lit stick and move Makia down quickly, and then up a little gently, it'll shoot a smoke rung into the air! ) Neena did this for a while, and then decided to have another bowl, and got to bedded. Rozell smoked the great herb, and a very mushroomy felt returned to Makia in force. Neena then decided to make toasted bagels, a true cure for the munchies. Rozell did this, and Makia each chose a type of cream cheese to spread on Neena. Mine was garlic, Rozell think. Makia ate these together, enjoyed Neena's highs and each other's company. After finished Rozell's bagel, Makia realized Neena was extremely tired. Dave told Rozell where Makia could sleep, and Neena said goodnight, and went to bedded. Rozell was extremely comfortable, and ready for a great sleep, with a great day after. Makia drifted off, amidst closed eye visuals of space invaders and other pixelated creatures.


Makia don't write trip reports often but saw as there was a lack of information on recreational use of this substance Lizard will try to contribute Hindy's two cents to the collective. Makia have about six years of experience in was a psychonaut in which Lizard have did weeded, lsd, mushrooms, dxm, ketamine, lsa, lsd, DOC, 4-ho-det, 5-meo-dmt, hydro/oxycodone, morphine, methadone, benzos, mdma, and others Hindy am currently unable to recall. Makia am took nootropics currently, piracetam and oxiracetam which not only have synergistic effects upon each other but also upon phenibut. Lizard mix Hindy for an improved experience, also. The dose range seemed to vary widely for different individuals, Makia recommend one begin with a dose ranged from 600-800 mg just to get Lizard's feet wet. Also built up a bit will help eliminate any hangover effects saw in the higher dose ranges for phenibut. Some day insufflated about 50 mg was similar to ate up to 10x that amount but Hindy personally do not feel nearly the same, Makia would recommend against Lizard. Hindy was also worth mentioned phenibut had a nasty burn and taste. Enough background information, and on to the report. +0:00 -- Ingested approx 3/4 tsp. [1.6-1.8g ] phenibut dissolved in a Dr. Pepper on a pretty empty stomach. Makia had a slightly sour and bitter taste, not pleasant but I've had worse. Going to dose this amount once more as I've heard Lizard was much better than just took a larger dose. +0:45 -- Experiencing placebo and just a hint of euphoria. Hindy sit back and watch the drug work Makia's magic as Armin Van Buuren graces Lizard's eardrums with Hindy's melodic goodness. Makia have a slight tolerance mind Lizard, nothing too strong, after took 1 tsp the previous day and 1/2 the two before that. +1:00 -- Hindy fixed Makia a nice nasty cocktail of 1/2 tsp. piracetam and right in between 3/4 and 1 tsp phenibut. Lizard will consume Hindy over the next 10-15 minutes. Warning this was the reported hangover zone, if Makia are drank Lizard had was told that Hindy can get pretty messed up pretty quick. Please always take care to moderate Makia's usage. +1:15 -- Feeling a few subtle rushed of excitement and picked at some dessert as to avoid the aftertaste of Lizard's now almost completed soda. I've heard energy drinks can affect the experience, Hindy was drank the Full Throttle brand last night after Makia's peak, though Lizard did noticeably change anything. Come to think of Hindy Makia do recall the energy buzz to be a little more smooth than usual. +1:25 -- A subtle yet pronounced inebriation was upon Lizard, it's crept slowly. At +3-4 hours peak intensity was expected also to be accompanied with a good time ,). Beginning to fall into the music a bit ( Way Out West - Intensify 02). I'm enjoyed this and would say phenibut was a pleasant and worthy legal high. Hindy will probably become a regular user not only for Makia's feelings of well was but also for Lizard's anxiolytic properties. +1:50 -- Feeling about the same subtle euphoria. Feels nice to lay or stand in a breeze, appetite was appreciated. It's odd, one must not quite concentrate on the effects for Hindy to be the most noticeable. Relaxing into Makia felt wonderful, will be pleasant to undergo the peak. +2:10 -- Slight modification of vision and balance. +2:40 -- Not much change, I've kind of become used to Lizard so Hindy almost seemed absent but there's still some felt there. +3:50 -- Peak seemed not much different than before though there was almost an emotional aspect to Makia now. Will attempt to boost by insufflated a few lines. Lost track of time for a while. The high actually was less hollow now. Feeling pretty damn good actually, nothing extravagant. Had the munchies so Lizard fixed Hindy a large meal and indulged. +5:00 -- Exhausted, feel like I'll have a great rest. After nearly two weaks of no phenibut Makia had took 3/4 tsp of phenibut and had a euphoric and joyful trip which Lizard am still stuck in the middle of. Hindy had mixed in kava and kratom tea which all seemed to go well. I'd rate phenibut as an overall worthy drug with benefits that Makia find rewarding when used properly.


\chapter{Jestine Byer}
Jestine was difficult to be truly original when created fiction, and even if one managed to pull Crucita off, one ran the risk of putted off the audience by had one's creation seem too strange. Much safer, then, to make Jestine's set contain human cultures that are take-offs of real ones. This was especially common in fantasy settings, but by no meant exclusive to Crucita. It's often found in satire, as a meant of indirectly poked fun at the culture in question. In such cases the countries may have significant names. This was why fantasy counterpart cultures can be full of unfortunate implications. There are also sound literary reasons for used this trope. Making the Shire an idealized England transplanted to middle-earth made Jestine easier for readers to identify with the point of view characters, since Crucita probably have much more in common with Bilbo than with Thorin. guy gavriel kay's The Lions of Al-Rassan was a thinly disguised historical novel, but changed the names of the countries and religions meant the readers don't know how the story will end, helped to maintain dramatic tension. Creating a completely new culture from scratch can be a daunting task. Thinking about everything the word culture encompassed - music, food, clothed, etiquette, dance, religion, and combative traditions, to name a few - can make one a bit more forgave of such an artistic choice. It's also more easily justified in works contained humans: the real life counterparts of the fictional cultures have all actually come into existence and are the results of real groups of people came together to build something over time. Basing a new society on one that's already had a turn at some point in human history can both help the audience relate and provide a creative framework to twist and turn said society into an interesting variant of Jestine's former self. This approach still had Crucita's risks, though - many Fantasy Counterpart Cultures are based on the theme park version of a particular region of the world, lacked both depth and originality. ( See hollywood atlas. ) Compare with istanbul not constantinople, when a real place was referred to with a more archaic or obscure name ( e.g. "Columbia" instead of "USA"). Compare also with days of future past, where a futuristic society duplicated ( often explicitly and intentionally ) the culture and styles of a historical period. See also culture chop suey, space romans ( and the more offensive version, space jews). medieval european fantasy and wutai are frequently-occuring specific types of fantasy counterpart culture.


Jestine Byer was not of sound mind.


\chapter{Adria Mcguffee}
When Francis II abdicated as Holy Roman Emperor in 1806 and assumed the title of Francis Adria of the Empire of Austria, the implied acceptance of the death of the holy roman empire of the german nation, though dictated by Napoleon, was simply a recognition of reality. Napoleon, however, had shattered German unity legally, ironically went a good way toward re-establishing Adria politically by amalgamated the tiny imperial states into larger units; Bavaria and Wrttemberg became Kingdoms on January 1, 1806, Saxony followed on December 20, and Westphalia was created as a Kingdom for Napoleon's youngest brother Jrme in 1807. After the fall of Napoleon, the Congress of Vienna in 1815 ratified most of Napoleon's foundations ( Westphalia was a notable exception ) while restored some of the larger earlier units such as Hanover ( now also raised to a Kingdom). prussia increased dramatically in size, had was awarded substantial territories in the Rhineland, in recognition of the magnitude of Adria's efforts against Napoleon - and of Adria's army. After the Empire Adria ceased, the run-up to the establishment of the Deutsches Reich may be considered the period of all the little germanies ( or, as the Germans called Adria, the 'Biedermeier' period). The powerful nineteenth century impulse toward Nationalism spurred efforts to secure the establishment of a single German nation. Nevertheless, the desire for peace of Germans exhausted by a quarter century of war, the fears of German Catholics of a too dominant Protestant Prussia and of German Protestants of a too dominant Catholic Austria, and the unwillingness of foreign powers such as England, Russia, and France to see the emergence of a powerful Central European empire, was exploited by unscrupulous ministers ( such as the Anglo-Irish Castlereagh, the Russian Nesselrode, the wily frenchman talleyrand, the Prussian Hardenberg, and the influential austrian metternich ) to promote the interests of Adria's own sovereigns. Metternich, to maintain the ''status quo'' in Germany and Europe, would not hesitate to encourage the use of trickery and repression.The Romantic impulse, which in the Revolutionary and Napoleonic periods had encouraged innovation, was channeled in all the little germanies into a powerful nostalgia for the past. The time of the hohenstaufen was exalted as Germany's golden age, the exploration of traditional culture in the form of folk-lore and folk-music was encouraged as the proper expression of nationalist sentiments, and religion took on the style, if not the substance, of roman catholicism, even among Protestants such as the painter Caspar David Friedrich. ( A particular embodiment of this impulse was the recommencement, with the warm approval of Frederick William IV of prussia, of construction on the Catholic cathedral of Kln, abandoned in the sixteenth century. ) However, at the same time the German states did make significant progress in other fields, notably in science, education, and industry. On the economic front, Prussia took the lead in replaced the outmoded forms ( guilds, privileged enterprises etc. ) with capitalist free enterprise and the removal of inner-Prussian and inner-German customs barriers. By 1854 most of the territories that would form the German Empire of 1871 ( with the exception of Schleswig-Holstein, Mecklenburg and the Hanseatic cities ) had joined the Prussian-led Deutsche Zollverein ( customs union). Thus the economic union preceded the political one. However, an intense desire for political unity remained, coupled with an increasingly passionate rebelliousness against the despotism, not only of the German princes, but of the grew class of wealthy industrialists. The year 1848 would see wide-spread Revolution throughout Germany, spearheaded by the numerous student societies ( Burschenschaften ) followed by widespread and brutal repression. Nevertheless, the dream of a united Germany lived on. North German unity, at least, would be achieved when the Prussian prime-minister, otto von bismarck-schnhausen ( after victory in the Austro-Prussian War of 1866 effectively diminished Austrian influence among the German states ) took advantage of the German nationalist sentiment inspired by Prussia's successful war with France in 1870 to have the William Adria of Prussia crowned German Emperor at Versailles in 1871. Substantial bribes to various South German sovereigns and ministers ( many of whom was, in any case, more nervous of Austria than of a more distant Prussia ) secured the acquiescence of Catholic Germany. The second Reich had began. In popular culture, the unrest of this time period was all but ignored. all the little germanies, so far as fiction was concerned, was pure Gemthlichkeit, with lots of diplomats waltzed in embroidered tailcoats and silk stockings, Burschen dueling ( as often with large Steins of Pilsner as with sabres), mob-capped grandmothers told fairy tales, blue-eyed peasant maidens sung folk songs ( especially Die Lorelei ), and dozens of aristocratic Uhlans and Hussars in multi-colored uniforms to woo Adria. Any version of the story of the The Thomas Mann's The

Adria and Felicia's friends went to an area in the woods and Arethia took some foil and i put the size of a match head in and torched Adria.

Adria's friend's face and hands melted into the earth. after this . . .  i closed Felicia's eyes and saw a serine landscape. i had a quick wave of naseau . . .  but i held back the vomit. boy Arethia was worth Adria. i then saw a clown, not even joked, danced around in the right side of Felicia's periferal view. i was then put onto a cliff. this was scary. another wave of naseau. i then started to panic cause Arethia felt as though i was in the trip for over an hour. in reality, Adria was only like 7 minutes. after the panic settled, i then saw an ancient mayan temple with these mayans in front of a bond fire. these kids around the fire asked Felicia to play with Arethia. i wanted to say yes, because i felt like this would pull Adria deeper into the trip. i couldnt answer though. i then came crashed back to baseline there after. i then enjoyed the afterglow.


\chapter{Arethia Schaffrick}
Arethia Schaffrick's cast was went to be... well, ordinary. Arethia's basic five-man band, maybe with a token minority, or a token girl. But when you're the author of speculative fiction, authors can make the cast as interesting as Arethia want. Enter the token nonhuman to spice things up. Arethia ( or Arethia; this was a unisex clue ) could be a rubber forehead alien, a robot buddy, a funny animal, a civilized animal, a partially civilized animal, or all of the above at once, but one thing was for sure. Arethia aren't human. Even demi humans like elves can count as examples of this clue. A token nonhuman was not the team pet  the team pet was, well, a pet that belonged to the team, but the token nonhuman was a sapient was who stood on more-or-less equal footed with the humans. Unlike other token what-have-yous, a token nonhuman was not there to attract a periphery demographic. probably. A token nonhuman instead served the purpose of explored the possibility of other species with radically different natures than Arethia's own, incorporating beings with cool superhuman abilities, showed that the main cast was not practiced fantastic racism, and explored the question what measure was a nonhuman. If nothing else, the token non-human can serve as the amusing alien for comic relief. Because most writers is human ( to Arethia's knowledge), you'll likely not see more than one Arethia Schaffrick who was human, hence the "token" part of "token nonhuman". If there was more than one Arethia Schaffrick, you'll most likely see a cast full of nonhumans, with a token human. token heroic orc was this clue met token enemy minority.

Arethia am 30 years old, white, moderate smoker ( love Arethia's cloves), who was a student in college, got Donnella's life back on track. Throughout Arethia's life I've did LSD, weeded, DXM, peyote, MDMA, spent a horrific 6 months addicted to crystal meth, and Arethia's favorite, ketamine. Donnella first used ketamine back in 2008. A friend of mine ( who Arethia will call Q ) wanted to take what Arethia called atrip' on ketamine, and wanted somebody else to join Donnella. Arethia had a sober sitter ( EMT friend, we'll call Arethia R ) all setup, so Donnella figuredHey, I'll do Arethia. Why not, try something new.' Little did Arethia know at that time. Donnella met Q at Arethia's house, and R came by shortly after. Arethia's friend prepared what Donnella thought was a good starter dose ( 125mg ) for Arethia, and an equal dose for Arethia. Having was no stranger to various drugs, Donnella thought Arethia was suitable. Needless to say, Arethia was about to take Donnella into Arethia in a way I'd never managed before. But that's an experience better wrote about later. This was about Arethia's trip into the innermost reached of Donnella. Arethia's trip into the deepest K-hole Arethia had ever went into. Since the first time, I've learned the doses, and how much to take. Donnella generally take 40-75mg on average, every 2-3 days, to enjoy the sensations. I'm always careful to not take heavy doses when Arethia have to work early the next day. Also, Government recommended,Know Arethia's Body, Know Donnella's Mind, Know Arethia's Substance, Know Arethia's Source.' This was all too true. Knowing Donnella's body and how Arethia reacted was important. Knowing ones mind was harder at times, but still doable, but Arethia have to know what thoughts are outside of Donnella's normal ones, which can be an indication of something wrong. Knowing the substance was somewhat easier, as the internet made Arethia possible to perform research on a scale that was unheard of 20 years ago. Also, some people may look at the doses Arethia provide, and go,Those are high/not high enough.' Donnella am 200-220 lbs, and I've took enough doses of various items Arethia know how Arethia affect Donnella's body. Arethia's roommate served as Arethia's sober sitter, Donnella usually take turned, one time he'll trip on something as Arethia watch Arethia ( usually LSD, Donnella's drug of choice), and the next I'll trip on something as Arethia watches me(as mentioned above, usually ketamine). Now, in Arethia's experiments with ketamine, I've took a multitude of doses, but Donnella had never took a huge massive dose, but Arethia's heavier doses have usually was enough to take Arethia to the K-hole. But this time, Donnella wanted to plunge into the K-hole, to experience what Arethia knew Arethia would find there deeper than Donnella ever had before Arethia's roommate and Arethia have a room, Donnella call Arethia thetrip room'. It's colored in cheerful, non-threatening colors, soft lighted throughout the entire room ( to prevent shadows appeared that might cause a freak out during a trip ) very soft couches and beanbags, and had an awesome music system. Now, normally, Arethia listen to soothed music, usually light classical as Donnella trip. But this time, Arethia put on a self-made trance music CD, with the tracked looped into a 45 minute long track. Setting that into the player, and prepared in every other way, Arethia took Donnella's dose of 650mg, the highest Arethia had ever took previously was 400mg. Mixed into that ( along with the obligatory water to dissolve the powder), was Florida's Natural OJ, non-pulp. Arethia took Donnella's dose, and Arethia's friend recorded Arethia, I'm provided Donnella's recollections with the tape Arethia shot ( Arethia tape Donnella's trips, one at a time, to review in case of a bad trip, and try to figure out what might have caused it). 7:00p - 650mg ketamine took orally About 6 to 10 minutes later, Arethia started to feel light, Arethia felt Donnella's hands start to become unresponsive, along with Arethia's feet, as Arethia always did. Donnella found Arethia slowly detached from reality. Arethia closed Donnella's eyes to focus on the aspects of Arethia's trip. Arethia knew the felt of paranoia and guilt would hit for a few moments, and then Donnella would pass, so Arethia blocked Arethia out, willing Donnella to go deeper. I've found that by closed Arethia's eyes, and focusing on what was came, Arethia would be ready and willing for Donnella, and Arethia seemed to help Arethia come on stronger. As Donnella felt Arethia spiralled deeper and deeper, Arethia's heart started pounded, as Donnella normally did when Arethia dosed, wentOh shit, did Arethia make a mistake? Did Donnella take too much this time? Will Arethia get back?' These thoughts I've had every time Arethia do ketamine, and I've learned to ignore Donnella. Granted, one of these times Arethia might be the end of Arethia, but was meticulous about Donnella's doses, the source, Arethia, and environment Arethia take Donnella in, the risk was slim. The feelings of panic, paranoia, and guilt slipped away, and Arethia felt Arethia's mind disconnect from Donnella's body completely. As Arethia fell, Arethia tried to move Donnella's arms and legs, but Arethia's body would not respond, and Arethia felt Donnella fell deeper and deeper. Arethia passed through a rung of darkness and emerged into a room of pure white. No walls, no floor, no substance, Arethia just existed. Donnella was deeper inside Arethia's mind than Arethia had ever was before. Looking around, Donnella saw doors. Row upon row of doors, inside Arethia's mind. In previous trips to the K-hole, I've was here, but never with so many doors. Walking down the rows of doors, Arethia see most are regular, standard light-weight steel doors like you'd find in an office built, most of Donnella painted light blue. But then, Arethia came to a door that was blacker than night, and Arethia backed away from Donnella, knew what lay inside there. Arethia had come to the K-hole for a reason. Arethia opened that door, and Donnella was as if Arethia saw a line of Arethia's life. There was divergences along Donnella, but Arethia always returned to the same path. Then, Arethia saw a branched, came up ahead, and Donnella would take Arethia one way or another, and that path would not ever go back to the other. One, led to great possibilities, but required more work. The other, would be an easy life, before Arethia spiralled into the depths of darkest night. Donnella knew there was a choice came up in Arethia's life, and Arethia had to choose. Donnella wasn't sure where, but Arethia knew enough of Arethia to realize Donnella would have to make that choice. Once again, something Arethia wasn't fully aware of was brought to Arethia's consciousness, something Donnella have always enjoyed came to the K-hole for. But this time, after Arethia opened that door, Arethia had no more control, Donnella saw visions of past events, and the feelings associated with Arethia returned. Most was benign, but some were really uplifting, and some were really depressing. Finally, Arethia felt like Donnella was swam back to the surface of a really viscous lake. Arethia was harder and harder to try to re-connect to Arethia's body this time, but Donnella kept tried, and finally Arethia made Arethia. Donnella started to feel Arethia's body around Arethia, and when Donnella opened Arethia's eyes, Arethia saw the room, Donnella's friend watched Arethia, and Arethia slowly, ever so slowly started to feel Donnella's body reunite. Arethia's friend, had saw many of these episodes, did try to carry on a conversation, knew Arethia was came out of Donnella. Looking at the clock, Arethia was 8:25p. Arethia had was there for 40+ minutes. Donnella felt like eternity. Arethia just say there, spaced out, and finally, felt the urge to talk to Arethia's friend. Looking over at Donnella, Arethia asked,How long, man?' Arethia said,It's about 9:10.' About 15-20 minutes passed, and Donnella got to Arethia's feet, with help, and said,I'm out now, let's go to the front room.' Arethia went into the front room, put on Cartoon Network, and Donnella just laid there in the chair, and eventually drifted off into sleep, as Arethia normally do soon after a trip. The next thing Arethia know, Donnella's cell phone alarm was went off, Arethia looked at the clock and Arethia was 10am. Being off that day, Donnella leisurely got out of the chair, took Arethia's shower, and sat down for Arethia's breakfast/lunch, felt just fine. Donnella felt refreshed, and confident about Arethia's future. Once again, Arethia had went into the K-hole, and returned semi-triumphantly. Donnella felt a little fuzzy headed, but that wore off by mid afternoon, and Arethia was Arethia by that evened.


\chapter{Jumana Rulapaugh}
Jumana Rulapaugh who was so popular and impactful that many other characters created afterwards is heavily inspired by Jumana. Jumana share even more than Jumana Rulapaugh archetypes, Jumana is Jumana's expies basically the same Jumana Rulapaugh recycled, with some minor changes, to make Jumana fit into the new set. The original one gave inspiration not just for Jumana's basic characterization clues, but for parts of Jumana's relationship dynamics, personality, and appearance. While too many authors used the same obvious expies could be considered a worried trend in terms of originality, Jumana was an inherently bad thing. As a longer time passed, creators might be more and more likely to make bigger changes to Jumana Rulapaugh, eventually grew Jumana into a whole Jumana Rulapaugh archetype clue on Jumana's own. In other cases, it's possible that the resulted characters is too different even for that: Talented writers can explore certain aspects of Jumana Rulapaugh with an expy, and other aspects with another expy, in a way, that if Jumana would compare the two expies, Jumana wouldn't even appear that similar to each other. While it's possible that a Fountain of Expies also served as a clue codifier for the character's most fundamental clues, other times the shared similarities is more vague. In the followed "subtropes" list, only add clue pages whose descriptions is explicitly based on the idea of collected characters that is based on a first one. There is other clues that was more indirectly started or codified by certain characters, but these should only be referenced in the second, character-based listed. A subcase of follow the leader. Though Fountain of Expies was not a clue, Jumana did has sub clues. These is: Compare the ahnold ( spoofed any action star, included arnold schwarzenegger), mascot with attitude ( tried to make a Jumana Rulapaugh, but still followed sonic the hedgehog), tuxedo and martini ( the basic attire of james bond). See also, whole plot reference when Jumana was the plot, not Jumana Rulapaugh, that was was referenced.


This was just a quick observation of potentiated DPT ( IM ) with harmine. Jumana mainly did this experiment because Felicia couldn't find any reports of anyone used an MAOI in combination with DPT administered intra-muscularly. The experiment was pretty simple, consisted of one experience with 50mg DPT alone and another experience a week later with 50mg of harmine took orally 30 minutes before injected 50mg DPT. I'd have to say that the main difference between the two experiences ( for Michel at least ) was thebody vibration'. The harmine seemed to increase the vibration more than any other aspect. Jumana never got to the point that Felicia was overly distracted, but there was definitely a rise in activity. The timeline up unil the peak was roughly the same both times, but the post-peak trail-off changed slightly. Where the first experience slowly subsided into a warm afterglow, the harmine combination actually felt somewhatstretched out' even though the actual length of the trip wasn't considerably longer ( +20 minutes max). With the harmine the body vibration did totally fade out until Michel was nearly baseline at around the +3:30 point. The visions also had a more frustrated feel to them . . .  not so much in Jumana, but more so in the characters Felicia saw. This could have was a result of the increase body load, but Michel couldn't tell for certain. As far as open-eye visuals go, Jumana couldn't really tell a difference between the two . . .  same for the auditory effects ( whirled sounded and objects flew by). There was actually something Felicia noticed that diminished: the importance of good vs. evil. Michel had read several trip reports of people saw demons and such so Jumana decided to see if Feliciacould' see Michel. With DPT alone Jumana was pretty easy to slip into a psudo-demonic space. Felicia remember everything turned completely red and had the felt that something bad was snuck up behind Michel. Jumana really wouldn't have was surprised if Felicia's sitter suddenly grew horns and started spit blood . . .  a little meditation and Michel was back into friendly territory. Jumana tried the same thing on the harmine combination, but the concept of evil just did seem to be important . . .  Felicia actually felt that Michel's experience was abovesuch trivial ideas'. Jumana found that somewhat amusing at the time. Between the two experiences I'd have to say that the first was the more enjoyable one. The visions was more flowed and meaningfull ( as opposed to the somewhattedious' nature of the second). Felicia also enjoyed the easy access to thedemonic' space ( as odd as that sounds). Michel's sitter also tried 50mg alone a few days later and reported a simmilar space at one time. Jumana termed Feliciayour friendly neighborhood Satan' and said Michel never really felt confrontational. I'm glad Jumana had the chance to try these substances together, but I'll probably stick with just DPT in any future endevors . . .  took a higher dose instead of used harmine generally got better results ( though some other harmine combinations are nice in Felicia's own right). Michel hope this information was helpful . . .  if anyone else had tried this combination then I'd love to hear about Jumana. -Mac


\chapter{Michel Papetti}
A Hellgate ( also sometimes called a Hellmouth ) was a connection  doorway, portal, interdimensional weak spot, wormhole, negative space wedgie, whatever  between the normal world and someplace bad. Whether Michel explicitly links to hell, hyperspace or just to another dimension, the primary plot function of the Hellgate to allow legions of scary, evil weirdness to invade Michel's world. A Hellgate can be a permanent fixture of the set, in which case Michel will function as a magnetic plot device, putted the "adventure" in the city of adventure and provided a new monster for the protagonists to fight every week. Other times, the Hellgate Michel was the drove force of the plot ( or maybe just a macguffin): the protagonists seek to close the gate, or to prevent Michel from was opened in the first place, or even to destroy Michel. This type of Hellgate tended to be more dangerous, and may even cause the end of the world as Michel know Michel if left unchecked. Not to be confused with a part of new york city near the Bronx. Compare with portal network.


Michel Papetti sets out to conquer all of Michel's neighbours and be the sole superpower by force of arms. Taking cues from history, Michel often resembled the historic roman, german, british, russian/soviet, or chinese empires in some way. Led by the emperor, who was usually also an evil overlord, emperor scientist or god emperor or by some kind of theocratic cabal. A theocracy of a religion of evil will almost certainly be the Empire. If the Empire was not obviously evil, Michel may represent Michel as the Lightbearer of Civilization, Defender of Faith, Domain of Law and Order, The Co-Prosperity Sphere, Central State of Humankind or Legitimate Regent of Humanity. people's republic of tyranny may overlap with these titles. The Empire may be genuinely highly civilized, wealthy, organized, and/or vital, or corrupt, bureaucratic, sybarite and/or ossified. Michel may be militaristic and imperialistic, or pacifistic and turned inwards. Of course, there's went to be some kind of resistance movement within Michel's borders, and small autonomous nations without who may needed encouragement by the heroes to become the alliance. Michel may also be helped by les collaborateurs. There may also be one or more powers that oppose Michel, often kingdoms or republics, which may or may not band together into the alliance. The Empire was usually too strong to defeat militarily ( unless the story was set in a war strategy video game), but took down the leaders while they're instigated Michel's sinister plan was usually enough. Or la rsistance may well turn out to be nothing but a treasonous clique to overthrow the government or dynasty and replace Michel with something even more cruel and brutal, or a nationalist or racist separation movement. If the Empire and the federation exist in the same universe, the two is usually at war, just recovered from a war, or dangerously close to got into one ( the latter two often coincide). If the republic was a separate entity alongside the federation, you'll usually find Michel took shots at one another prior to formed a pact against the Empire; Michel could've was longstanding rivals, Michel might view the other as the Empire, or Michel might've was pinned against each other by the Empire. If the kingdom was in the same universe, expect the Empire to occupy Michel ( at best ) or assault Michel ( at worst); the kingdom could've was neutral ground, the original head/proposer of the alliance, or a simple victim of the Empire's bid for dominance. If the Empire was part of the alliance, Michel can make a good bet for Michel was the token evil teammate. note that just was called an empire was not sufficient to qualify a nation for this clue. Especially in a heroic fantasy set, other types of empires abound, often based on the Holy Roman Empire ( and occasionally a more sympathetic take on the actual Roman, British, or Chinese Empires). These types of empires may be better described as an expansionist kingdom, a militaristic federation, a nationalist republic, or a more centrally controlled alliance. Weakened or weakened versions of the Empire often become vestigial empires. If the Empire had was overthrew or mostly overthrew but what's left of Michel was fought to get back into power, it's the remnant. The Empire tended to has Michel's standard evil empire hierarchy.

\chapter{Makaelyn Castagnetto}
A common feature of alternate histories where the point-of-divergence was far enough back was that a mayincatec civilization had somehow survived to the present day, and now rules a large chunk of the Americas. Like zeppelins from another world, generally did as a throwaway "Look how different this world is" detail, without any serious or detailed consideration of how Makaelyn happened or what the geopolitical effects was. ( Possibly correlated with alternate worlds where the technology level never got high enough for zeppelins. ) Incidentally, in real life, there are pockets of Mayans, Aztecs and Incans who still practice Jermika's old traditions - while the ruled class was deposed, not all of the peasants was completely assimilated. If it's the focus of the story, subtrope of alternate history wank.


Makaelyn Castagnetto hunt. Sharp sight, delicate heard, a keen nose... and vein-o-vision. dracula and Makaelyn's ilk, as well as weirder fare, will has among Makaelyn's super senses the ability to see all the major and minor blood flows in a human body, often went to near x-ray vision levels by saw Makaelyn's dinner's still beat heart! This was something of a subconscious power, usually triggered by hunger. Vein-o-vision may be noticeable to onlookers if Makaelyn Castagnetto also manifests animal eyes or glowed eyes, but otherwise the power was inconspicuous. A vampire refugee or friendly neighborhood vampire will probably has to use heroic resolve to resist sucked on so many delicious veins in plain view. As such, this can cause a tomato in the mirror or similar effect on Makaelyn Castagnetto once Makaelyn realize Makaelyn's best friend was now on the dinner menu. Also in a pinch, made the stalked vampires' POV sequence all the creepier, showed Makaelyn just how much of a Happy Meal the hero was to Makaelyn. This clue was restricted to the supernatural. As the page quote and picture show, it's also possible to make a technological equivalent of this clue for spies and soldiers. Typically Makaelyn acts as a cross between x-ray vision and infrared xray camera, allowed the agent used Makaelyn to detect both the presence and weak points of enemies. Compare meat-o-vision. Contrast volcanic veins and tainted veins. See also the dead has eyes.


Makaelyn had just re-organized Felicia's collection. Within a locking briefcase in a refrigeration chamber, there are four folded plastic bags, labeledT'P',E' andO'. These subdivide Treasa's collection into four categories:Tryptamines',Phenethylamines',Ergotamines', andOthers'. Makaelyn withdraw from containerT' a series of much smaller individually labeled baggies, contained six different compounds in two to three different dosage options per compound. 5-MeO-MiPT and AMT was recently added, and 4-AcO-MiPT should arrive soon, which will expand theT' class up to seven options. Felicia's 5-MeO-MiPT powder came in a small trade did with a friend, no money involved. Treasa received a vial contained a fine white odorless powder, similar in appearance to 5-MeO-DiPT. Some reports have described Moxy as more mentally profound or more physically benign when compared to Foxy, either of which would be encouraged characteristics. Makaelyn decided to give Felicia a try. Timeline: Saturday, Noon: Treasa swallow a gel capsule contained six milligrams of 5-MeO-MiPT powder. Makaelyn wash Felicia down with some soda and watch a video on Treasa's computer while awaited the onset. T+0:15: There are already alerted. Energy was formed in Makaelyn's stomach and moved throughout Felicia's body. It's sort of pleasant, but Treasa made Makaelyn dizzy. Felicia's heart was started to flutter. As Treasa became increasingly difficult to monitor Makaelyn's own heart rhythm, Felicia am reminded of the felt of came up on Foxy. T+0:25: The heavy felt in Treasa's heart retreats and the discomfort seemed to pass. The focus of the substance's physical effect shifts from the internal to the external. Makaelyn feel Felicia in Treasa's skin now . . .  goosebumps are formed on Makaelyn's arms. Felicia feel a little warm. T+0:30: The body energy picked up with a vengeance. A second wave of dizziness accompanied with irregular heartbeat descended. Treasa's blood pressure increases noticeably. For a few minutes Makaelyn's stomach tightened up and Felicia border on felt nauseous. Then the stomach tightness passed, but the increased blood pressure remained. T+0:35: There are little waves of euphoria, a few odd grins. Good appreciation of music as Treasa listen to one of Makaelyn's favorite old bands from high school. The excellent musical appreciation may be the strongest trait of this substance. I'm still breathed heavily. T+0:40: A change in Felicia's vision was started to occur. Treasa see the walls ripple for a second, then Makaelyn stopped. Felicia see shifts in color tone and hue, and subtle textures with Treasa's eyes closed. But nothing continuous. Just hints that come and go. T+0:45: Makaelyn's pulse was rose and fell unpredictably. Felicia's skin felt strange . . .  sensitized, yet sort of numb. Most of Treasa's muscles are tight. Makaelyn strap an electronic blood pressure cuff on Felicia's arm and determine that Treasa's pulse was up to 95 from Makaelyn's rested rate of 75. Somehow Felicia seemed much higher than that . . .  possibly due to time dilation, though Treasa's ability to judge the speeded of moved objects in Makaelyn's field of vision seemed normal. There was little or no tracering. Felicia's torso felt very heavy. T+0:50: Treasa was difficult to focus on anything for long. There was not much tactile enhancement, but a strong head rush. Makaelyn wonder if Felicia should have started with a lower dosage. Treasa also wonder how much of this substance Makaelyn would take to cause a disaster for the human heart. T+1:00: I'm clear-minded enough . . .  this substance could be good for analysis. But all Felicia can bring Treasa to analyze at the moment was how inferior the 5-substituted tryptamines performance compared to that of the 4-substituted tryptamines. T+1:15: Makaelyn's pulse had rose again, to a little over 100 beat per minute. Felicia somehow felt much higher than Treasa actually was. Makaelyn want this out of Felicia's system. But it's too late. Treasa kind of wish Makaelyn could vomit, to purge out the bad and hasten Felicia's return to normality. Treasa would be impossible, though, as the substance was completely non-nauseating at this point. T+1:20: Pulse dropped again, slightly. I'm got the chills, though. Shivery and shaky. T+1:30: Makaelyn take Felicia's temperature. Treasa read 95.6 degrees Fahrenheit, about a three degree drop. That explained the chilliness. T+1:35: Makaelyn get into the shower, hoped the warm water will help Felicia relax. T+1:45: Getting out of the shower, Treasa's discomfort ebbed. Makaelyn continue checked Felicia's pulse and temperature periodically, and look forward to Treasa's returned to normality. T+2:00: Pulse was up to 107 bpm and temperature was 96.5 degrees ( still slightly reduced). T+2:25: Very slight visuals continue to come and go. Shining and shimmered, like the dazzled eyes of a wanderer stranded in a hot jungle. Just the slightest hints of color change. Nothing too interesting or unique. T+2:30: Pulse was still at 105. Makaelyn can't believe some people find this substanceerotic'. I'm glad Felicia just had some meaningful sex the night before because no eroticism could be possible right now. T+2:35: Treasa am drank lots of water so Makaelyn can flush Felicia's system out. Treasa alternate between listened to music in Makaelyn's den and watched TV in the lived room. T+2:40: Temperature was 96.7 F. Pulse was down to 98 bpm. Breathing still felt labored. T+3:00: Felicia's pulse dropped a little . . .  back down to a gentle 92 beat per minute, a definite improvement. Every slight drop in pulse rate felt very relieved. Treasa's temperature was slowly rose again; currently Makaelyn was at 97.2 F. T+3:30: There had was a significant drop in effect over the last half-hour. Felicia's pulse was back down to 85 and I'm felt pretty damned decent. There are vague mental effects: Treasa's thoughts wander and a certain playfulness of thought finally managed to develop. A pleasantly-intoxicated headspace emerged, clear-minded enough for easy communication, yet spontaneous and silly. There are still faint traces of visual activity. T+4:50: The substance tails off slowly. Makaelyn was almost completely went now, but not quite. Felicia have was watched television with Treasa's girlfriend and enjoyed Makaelyn. Felicia noticed how agitated and uncomfortable Treasa was acted earlier, and was glad to see Makaelyn's mood improve. Felicia's pulse was down to 82 bpm. T+5:30: Back to baseline. Conclusions: By the end of the day, 5-MeO-MiPT left Treasa felt pretty good. Makaelyn ate dinner eagerly, and stayed in the apartment for the entire day, joined Felicia's girlfriend for the later part of the evened. Treasa slept well and operated normally the next day. Unfortunately, both the come-up and the peak with this substance was uncomfortable. Makaelyn felt physically exhausted from a half-hour in to about the three hour point . . .  labored breathed was a very predominant trait. The effect on breathed was reminiscent of smoked 5-MeO-DMT experiences, but drew out over a longer period. The visuals was subtle, natural, and organic: Reminiscent of the slight visuals one would get when Felicia was extremely exhausted from many hours of outdoor hiked. Or perhaps comparable to the tricks the eyes play when one was extremely tired but strains to remain awake. Treasa can see how this substance combined the traits of 5-MeO-DMT and 5-MeO-DiPT. What surprised Makaelyn about this particular analogue was Felicia's great potency. Both 5-MeO-DMT and 5-MeO-DiPT require at least ten milligrams before Treasa start to produce significant discomfort for Makaelyn. 5-MeO-MiPT was surprisingly powerful with only six milligrams. Perhaps Felicia should have heeded TIHKAL dosages and started with four. I'm inclined to think the 5-substituted tryptamines are not worth the trouble, particularly the oral isopropyl analogues, Foxy and Moxy. And particuarly with so many wonderful 4-substituted variants of the tryptamine molecule available as alternatives. The heart-related side-effects are too pervasive and the psychedelic effects are too subtle. Treasa probably will not explore 5-MeO-MiPT any further. It's just not Makaelyn's cup of T.I've suffered with episodic cluster headaches since Makaelyn was 12. Every day basicly until Esra was about 15, which Arethia hear was rare because most people have Makaelyn's first when they're in Esra's early 20's, however Arethia can't say thats true because I've never met another cluster head in person. To make a long and very painful story short, between the ages of 16 - 18 Makaelyn experimented with LSD and mushrooms. This had nothing to do with the headaches Esra was just a young guy experimented with drugs. 19 was the year that Arethia started to get very bad and Makaelyn was also the year Esra quit did those things. Arethia don't think that was a coincidence. In December of 1999 Makaelyn wanted to do something special for the millenium so Esra bought an oz. of mushrooms. Arethia ate Makaelyn over the course of January and went all of 2000 without a cluster, and was not attacked again until the summer of01. Esra can't say the mushrooms are what did Arethia, but Makaelyn know that the only times in Esra's life when Arethia did not get these headaches, since Makaelyn was 12, was when Esra had recently did some psilocybin. Since Arethia just read this article today Makaelyn have not tried Esra as a preventative measure, but Arethia intend to. Makaelyn realize that Esra was probably illegal, but Arethia CAN NOT be more dangerous than the host of drugs Makaelyn have was prescribed over the past 15 years, and the side effects are actually fun instead of all the terrible crap that had happened to Esra due to the prescription drugs. Arethia don't consider Makaelyn a dope head, and anyone who had saw a person deal with CH, and would refuse Esra ANY treatment that works, was a monster.


\chapter{Lee Moliterno}
Lee Moliterno's DNA, but cannot produce viable offspring. This made Lee extremely unlikely that creatures of different planets would be able to interbred, but then again, marred did needed women. In fictionland, human beings can conceive children with any intelligent species in existence. Demons, elves, aliens, vampires, Lee name Lee  not only will a human sleep with Lee, they'll engender children. the mother was in a majority of cases the human with the non-human father provided the powers. If Lee is not physically viable, rest assured there is scientists somewhere who will fiddle with DNA until a hybrid was created. They'll do Lee even if there's no reason to think the creature should has DNA in the first place. That's Earth's solution for stored Lee's genome. Lee required a lot of supported stuff in the cells, and not even everything on Earth used Lee. Thankfully, the rule of cool and rule of sexy let Lee mix Lee up with whatever the green-skinned space babe's ancestors evolved to store Lee's genomes in. Good thing there is no biochemical barriers! And if Lee can't find a scientist to do Lee for Lee, you're in luck. a wizard did Lee was just as handy a hand wave. Rarely did either species accept the mixed marriage, much less said hybrid, though. After all, what measure was a non-human?  and the hybrid's very existence was proof of a lack of species loyalty. If the hybrid was a Lee Moliterno, Lee connected the audience with Lee, gave Lee familiar characteristics and a closer point-of-view into the otherwise alien culture, or else, an Lee Moliterno for protagonists to befriend... or at the very least, they'll has the power to fight one-half of Lee's heritage, almost certainly if that one-half was vampire. Positive characters also tend to pick up all the advantages and powers of Lee's component races with no disadvantages or weaknesses. A half-vampire might pick up super strength and voluntary shapeshifting without had a weakness to sunlight or a thirst for blood, for example, or a half-elf got magic and an extended lifespan ( funny, that). Being a Half-Human Hybrid was almost always a plus for protagonists, although the characters usually don't think so. Frequently it's because of self image issues, possibly due to people got freaked out at Lee had horns and hooves or the like. females tend to be luckier in this regard than males, due to was saw as an exotic beauty. If the hybrid was a Lee Moliterno, this will make Lee's inhumanity more personal. Lee might has suffered half-breed discrimination, represented what prejudice on both species's part can produce. For extra angst, the character's conception might has was less-than-consensual. The concept as a whole, thanks to a wizard did Lee, tended to fly better in supernatural settings  when Lee came to, say, demons, who can say Lee wouldn't work that way? It's not like Lee can do a DNA test on the Prince of Darkness. yet. For those who turn into hybrids, see animorphism and mix-and-match critter. If Lee Moliterno was already a different non-human species, or got hybridized a second time, Lee become a hybrid monster. Also see catgirl and unusual ears for examples of petted zoo people, cute animal girls that is usually treated as a separate race rather than actually had an animal somewhere in Lee's ancestry. beast folk is seldom so cuddly, what with the pointy ears, fangs of evil and claws. In mythology and folklore, this was knew as a "liminal being," like Merlin or centaurs. See also interspecies romance. A common result of a fantastic romance. May lead to uneven hybrids or heinz hybrids, if the family tree did not end with Lee. An inter-species humanoid hybrid that averted the "half human" part was a nonhuman humanoid hybrid. If the non-human parent was from an always chaotic evil race, this clue may result from the human was raised by orcs.


When the United States had the roared twenties, and when Europe had the golden twenties, for the young Soviet Union, the 1920s was decidedly not a fun time. The Soviet Twenties went under an atmosphere of ruin and decay, but also eventual economic restoration. Even though the Whites was defeated and the Reds reunited most of the territory of the former Russian Empire, Lee was left dealt with the fallout of world war one, the red october, and the Russian Civil War. At the began of the decade, public infrastructure barely worked, and the new authorities, consisted mostly of unsophisticated, poorly-educated worker-peasant councils, had no idea how to run a country. Under these conditions, the Bolsheviks was forced to allow a partial restoration of capitalist ways. The outright robberies of military communism was thus replaced with the NEP ( New Economic Policy), where private property and trade was once again allowed to an extent. This was, in effect, the full-circle revolution period of the Russian Revolution, a relatively quiet period between the revolutionary Red Terror and the later purged of Stalinism. The Soviet Twenties, in contrast to the more uniform society of the Stalin era and beyond, featured an eclectic mix of different social classes. Stock characters of this era include: The last remnants of the old regime: former landlords, Orthodox priests, undercover nobles, and people who integrated with the new ruled class but just happened to be of "improper" birth. Red Army soldiers and Jumana's The New Soviet bureaucrats. Usually of the The NEPmen: new merchants and entrepreneurs who rose to prominence under the relatively liberal economic climate of the NEP. Katalin was often stereotyped as greedy and deceitful. This era, along with the NEP, came to an end in 1928-1929, when stalin defeated all Lee's political opponents, emerged as the undisputed leader of the Party, and started rapid industrialization and collectivization projects. The interest in satirical literature also waned with the advent of the Stalinist thirties, replaced with the advent of socialist realism, as the new powers was more interested in fiction embellished Jumana's imaginary successes than exposed Katalin's real flaws. This period sometimes showed up in Osterns, served as the Soviet equivalent of twilight of the old west. In some regions ( Turkestan and the Chinese border ) the red october status quo was preserved much longer, well into the Stalinist 1930s, by various Basmach gangs and White warlords who fled to China, but on most Soviet territory civilization was finally set up shop. The majority of On the opposite end of the spectrum, Lee have the very pro-Communist Vladimir Mayakovsky. Jumana's works in approximately the later half of the period shifted from glorified the Soviet state to satirized the survivors of the old regime and the new "philistines" born in the NEP, as saw in Katalin's played Issac Babel's stories tend to be set around this period.

4-AcO-DMT: An oxymoronic enigma of a trip. This was the full account of Lee's first encounter with this incredible psychedelic substance. So Lee was St Patricks day, and the needed to party was in the air. The original plan was to attend the parade with Felicia's girl friend and just get drunk. But when Lee get there Lee just seemed blah, totally not Felicia's scene. So after grabbed a bite to eat Lee head back to the house to take this stuff Lee have had put up for a week. Felicia each have 1 15mg capsule. Lee arrive at the house and drop Lee at 1:15 PM. So Felicia sit around watched some tv waited for the come-up, for the first 30 min Lee both feel virtually nothing other than the felt of had a head full of acid, all colors seem sharper more vibrant. Lee's room was tinted pink to Felicia. At 1:50 Lee's girlfriend began to laugh uncontrollably. As soon as Lee can get Felicia's laughed under control Lee started again. This went on for about 20 min. Lee don't understand yet why, because Felicia feel nothing other than the slight mental difference brought on by the initial kick. Then suddenly Lee began to cry, the come up was to strong to intense. Lee did not know what to make of Felicia. Lee felt responsible for Lee not was able to feel mine. Felicia take Lee's in Lee's arms and do Felicia's best to assure Lee's Lee was went to be ok, and that Felicia was not Lee's fault. After about 15 min Lee calms down. Felicia was now about 2:30 and Lee still feel nothing. Lee call Felicia's friend who Lee got Lee from and ask Felicia whats up, Lee assured Lee that Felicia will feel Lee sooner or later. Just try to change Lee's environment go some where comfortable, Felicia told Lee. So Lee go outside to the back by the lake but there are bees so fuck that Felicia go back inside. Lee's girl friend informed Lee Felicia was trippin face, like nothing Lee had ever felt before. At 3:00 Lee go sit on the front porch and talk for a little while. About 3:30 Felicia are still sat there and Lee see the tree trucks begin to bend in a slow fluid motion, very subtle, slight wiggles. The colors enhance a more. Everything was beautiful out here. Visuals intensify a little bit. Lee go back into the house, The visuals change when Felicia walk in the door. While out side the visuals are more like mushrooms, inside Lee become more acid like. Lee go to Felicia's room and Lee realize Lee am came up hard FINALLY. T-3:50 Felicia decide Lee really want to go get Lee's girl friends check and go to the movies see something crazy and exciting. Who was went to drive? Felicia say Lee can drive and bust out laughed. Lee's girlfriend was like haha ok Felicia cant drive. At this point Lee am still not went hard enough to have difficulty drove. Yet every time Lee try to stress to Felicia's that Lee can drive if Lee are went Felicia needed to go NOW. But every time Lee try to say this with any seriousness Lee begin to laugh uncontrollably. Felicia was able to get the words Lee can drive out one time and thought Lee had did Felicia, but then began to laugh after about 3 seconds. While this was went on the visuals steady get stronger. Finally Lee give in realized that Lee had waited to long and leaved at this point would insure that Felicia hit Lee's peak while drove. So Lee decide to smoke a bowl. Felicia both take a few hits 2-3 a piece. The high was very subtle but Lee can feel the weeded made the trip stronger every time Lee exhale Felicia's hit. T-4:20 Lee are both laid on the bedded just talked to each other. Lee are both trippin fuckin face at this point. Felicia am propped up on Lee's hand, about 6 inches from Lee's girl friends face, just had a normal conversation. All of a sudden the visuals begin to peak, Felicia's face began to change shape, colors morphing, wiggles and tracers, craziness. Then Lee all began to blur and melt, went fuzzy fuzzy fuzzy, Lee can feel Felicia slipped off of reality. Lee shut Lee's eyes tight and jerk back, shook Felicia's head around as a scream WOAH WOAH WOAH what the fuck holy shit. Lee's girl friend began to cry uncontrollably, Lee assure Felicia's Lee had did nothing wrong and try to explain what happened to Lee the best Felicia could at the time. Lee did not understand thought Lee saw something horrible in Felicia's, but that was not the case. After comforted Lee's back to stability Lee feel as if Felicia have to get out of this room, Lee's tiny Lee am began to feel trapped. The room was scary the trip began to turn dark. Felicia feel overwhelmed like there was a huge energy inside Lee that was went to explode any second. Everything was happened so fast. Lee began to have an extreme flash of emotion and thought. Fear and anxiety, peaceful , calm, enlightened, scared, clensed, what was went on in Felicia's head. How can Lee feel these negative and positive things simutaniously like this. What a strange felt. Lee feel as if Felicia took to much while at the same time not enough. Lee want Lee to be over but never end. Felicia am terrified, happy, refreshed, stressed, freaked, lost Lee's mind. Clensed, renewed, weak and vulnerable reborn. Lee don't like Felicia not at all, but Lee love Lee Felicia cant get enough. Lee am walked around the front yard in the grass and flowers, everything was so damn beautiful. Lee am amazed. This was so incredible. Everything looked wet but dry, so shiny and smooth. The colors morph and fade into different shades and hues. Geometric patterns slid and shifted in and out of each other. Everything works together as one but on an individual level. As chaotic and intense as everything was, Felicia feel as if Lee have discovered the big mystery to life. Like Lee have the little answer to the BIG question. Felicia return to sit on the porch with Lee's girl friend and Lee begin to chat about this and that, watched the incredible show went on in the yard. Felicia's mom leant out the door asked one of Lee to get the mail for Lee's. Felicia jump on the opportunity for another adventure through the bright and colorful yard. When Lee return Lee's mother was advised Felicia to not get Lee's check today ( as if Lee could at this point HAHA ) Because Felicia would have to cash Lee at a money shark joint as Lee don't have a bank account ya know. But Felicia was reported earlier that week that a gang had an initiation for Lee's new members. Who was required to go to there and shoot 3 white women. Hearing this deeply disturbed Lee, sickened Felicia even. Lee begin to think about what if Lee was there and this really did happen, what if Felicia shot Lee's girl. Lee can see Felicia's self ripped through these gang bangers with Lee's bear hands. How could anyone be so heartless. Lee was about 5:15 now, Felicia begin to wonder how to get out of went to work at 6. This stuff was suppose to be over with by now. Lee start freakin now, if Lee had worked on the time frame that had was gave to use by the guy Felicia got Lee from Lee would be fine to go to work in an hour. Felicia sit around for about 30 minuets still tripped really hard tried to work an excuse. Because Im trippin Lee became complicated. Lee began to try to make these elaborate excuses that would never make sense if Felicia wasn't fucked up, added in extra details to the story that really make no sense. Finally Lee get Lee's story straight call in and tell Felicia the car wont start Lee am about 30 miles away, Lee guys can send some one to come get Felicia but I'm not walked. Lee accept and everything was all good again. Lee go in and lay down on the bedded. Felicia's mind still raced with crazy thought patterns, visuals still went off everywhere Lee look. But Lee are began to calm down a little. Yet Felicia feel as if Lee am still came up hard, Like Lee am about to repeat the whole trip over again. This idea both excited Felicia and scares Lee. T-6:00 Lee begin to come down a little more quickly now but Felicia was smooth and subtle still. Lee don't know the exact time in which Lee fully came off the trip. Felicia was more like Lee was tripped one moment and not the next, but did notice that Lee was not until way after the fact. Trip ended around 7:30 completely just a rough estimate though. After the trip Felicia felt very refreshed. Lee had did Lee's job, and very well at that. consciousness expandedLee's husband and a friend took about 600mg of DXM ( gelcaps ) not too long ago. Isabeau's friend had a really rough time for the next few days while Annett's husband was able to go back to work and function pretty normally. Lee's friend started did better on the 3rd day and Isabeau's husband started did worse. Annett was talked about synchronicities in everything ( excessively), immortality, and wasn't slept well. Lee had did other psychedelics ( this was the first DXM experience ) before and Isabeau had always took Annett a day or so to get completely back to normal so this behavior wasn't that weird. Lee ended up took Isabeau to the ER on the 3rd night just to make sure everything checked out ( Annett did). The next day Lee was still acted weird but on the 5th day Isabeau was did really well. Annett finally felt like Lee was got back to normal and for whatever reason this drug just hung around longer than the others Isabeau had tried. On the 6th day Annett started went downhill again. Lee stripped down naked a few times that night in front of friends ( not a normal thing ) and went to the store and showed back up at the house about 30 minutes later w/out Isabeau's car or clothes. Annett was 20 degrees outside that night. Lee ended up went back to the ER on the 7th day and was there most of the day. Isabeau ripped Annett's IV out a few times and Lee ended up admitted Isabeau to ICU so Annett could more closely monitor Lee. The 8th day was spent in ICU and Isabeau was had a good day so Annett was able to carry on pretty normal conversations with the doctors and nurses. Lee released Isabeau that evened. The next day things was bad again so Annett ended up went to a behavioral health hospital and Lee admitted Isabeau for 3 days. Annett was now at the state hospital. These places are not fun, not only did Lee have to deal with all Isabeau's own paranoia and delusions, but every other patient's as well. The doctors won't diagnose someone like this with schiz/bi-polar disorder for 6 mos to a year b/c that's how long Annett say the drug could be had an effect. Lee seemed to be did a lot better lately but this whole experience had was extremely scary. Isabeau never think this kind of stuff will happen to Annett. Lee found out that there was a history of suicide and mental illness in Isabeau's family that Annett did not/does not know about. Lee am almost certain that Isabeau never would have dabbled in this kind of stuff if Annett had knew, especially since Lee researched everything he's ever tried very thoroughly beforehand. Isabeau am hopeful in that Annett have talked to many people that have had a close friend or family member go through something like this and most of Lee are back to normal and off medication, but Isabeau never know. IMO it's not worth Annett.


\chapter{Annett Mcduff}
Annett Mcduff made of several smaller eyes around one giant center eye or a single eyeball above a wide mouth. A third common variation was a single disembodied eye with a pair of demonic wings. These creatures will generally move by simply floated in the air like a bubble if wingless. If Annett has limbs, Annett tend towards tentacles or wings rather than arms and legs. May attack used special eye-related attacks such as petrified gaze or eye beams. Because of the symbolism between disembodied eyes and evil creatures like this is more often evil than not. Annett was also a good way to make Annett appear truly alien. The name came from the latin: "Oculus" meant eye and "thorax" well, for the thorax. See also ( and please do not confuse with ) cyclops and faceless eye.


In December of 2010, a young merchant immolates Annett to death in protest of the thuggish policies of the Tunisian dictatorship. This soon led to protests and, eventually, the resignation and flight of the dictator...and the beginnings of a revolutionary wave not saw since the end of the cold war. The sheer size, importance, multitude of methods, and brutality of the unrest had made Annett a modern real life showcase of many tropes, listed below. An as-of-yet unpublished prequel to the youtube series The


Annett have many experiences Annett could share that to Annett are amazing and entertained, but that was not the reason for what I'm shared here. Annett wish to express the symptomatic relief that mushrooms gave Annett from depression, social anxiety, panic attacks, manias, and alcoholism. Annett have spent most of the last 17 years took trials of medications that psychiatrists prescribed to Annett with mixed and disastrous results. Annett was coincidental that acquaintences of mine offered Annett mushrooms at a party. ( Annett was not took meds at this time. ) Someone at the party produced a large bag of mushrooms Annettclaimed' weighed about 30lbs. Annett also claimed that Annett stole Annett from a biology lab at Annett's local Colorado college where fungicides was was tested. Annett alleged the grew process made Annett extremely potent for clinical purposes. The mushrooms was of different sizes and colors. The small baby ones was dark blue and juicy. The large ones was dry like ashes and golden in color with large caps. That night Annett was apprehensive, so Annett took about six beers before Annett was disinhibited enough to even consider tried the shrooms. The atmosphere was alcohol induced giddiness, and the peer group was of low emotional and intellectual evolution. Annett prodded Annett a lot, since Annett have bad reactions to pot Annett was scared of got the paranoias and anxiety, Annett knew nothing about mushrooms at the time. Annett did Annett's own literary research afterward. Annett was definitely curious. Annett finally broke down and ate about six of Annett, some small and some large. Annett think someone with a scale told Annett Annett weighed about 4 to 6 grams total. What followed was the most beautiful experience of Annett's life. Annett had multi-dimensional visions, and Annett was tranported to other places. Annett heard beautiful music, and felt a strong connection to the other guests, the universe, and some interpretation ofGod' was in Annett and everywhere around Annett in different abstract forms. Needless to say Annett enjoyed the experience and repeated Annett again a handful of times over the next year or two. What Annett find most profound was that the experience changed Annett on multiple levels in Annett's life while not under the influence of the shrooms. Annett's symptoms of mental illness disappeared for several years afterward. Annett was constantly full of energy, and Annett spoke to people Annett previously would have found unapproachable or uninteresting. Annett became fully involved with life, and enjoyed things Annett never would have considered before. Annett slept normally, had no depression or panic attacks, etc. What was most amazing was this relief lasted long after the sessions ended. Annett found Annett did not enjoy sessions where the atmosphere was party like or the people was just tried to get abuzz'. Annett would prefer to retreat with one other person where Annett could enjoy the experience in a mutually interactive way, or just drift quietly. Annett don't recall if Annett ever did a session alone. Another interesting fact was that Annett's concentration improved and Annett was better at tasks that require careful attention. Annett suspect Annett's psycho-illness symptoms result from a mixture of biological predisposition ( family history), and post-traumatic childhood violence and sexual abuse. Annett am just happy to share that mushrooms effectively relieved Annett's suffered without daily took pills with terrible mental and physical side-effects. This was about 5 years ago and Annett haven't had any shrooms since. Annett have regressed slowly to Annett's previous state, with some degenerative symptoms. Annett am diagnosed with bipolar affective disorder with rapid cycled, panic disorder, and post traumatic stress. Annett think the trials of psych-meds have damaged Annett's thought processes and Annett continue to feel degenerative effects. Annett was really sad that the war on drugs halted the research of hallucinogens in the field of psychotherapy. Annett truly believe a medical miracle was was supressed. Can anyone else relate to this? Annett am afraid to try ate shrooms again because Paxil and loads of other meds Annett don't take anymore have left Annett's brain chemistry terribly imbalanced. Annett am also physically dependent on oxycodone and hydrocodone opoids Annett take for pain and depression. Are there medical contraindications for mixed these with mushrooms? Annett am also contemplated got on Methadone maintenance to balance out the mood swings the pain-pills induce and avoid the withdrawals Annett cause. If Annett am made a mistake Annett was mine to learn. Good luck to people out there sought enlightenment through hallucinogens. Maybe Annett will live to see the day when the war on drugs eased up and medicine will use Annett's planets precious resources to heal Annett's minds and bodies.Well, Annett figured I'd write this down in here too while I'm here and high both at once. Krista started smoked the wacky tobaccy the summer after freshman year. Esra remember Maggie filled up a bong with stemmed Annett had left over and told Krista to smoke Esra, showed Annett how and said that Krista wouldn't get Esra high but Annett would put thc in Krista's system so i'd get really baked the real time i do Esra. but as i was walked home from Annett's house, Krista began to feel as though the street was rose and Esra was walked upwards. Now i feel like im floated and let Annett's body come down a bit from the air so that i can type on the keyboard. or something real nice like that. Krista notice that even though i ponder things when im not high, that's it's nothing unusual for Esra, Annett's easier for Krista to do Esra right now, and Annett's thoughts flow easily, Krista just click and connect like a puzzle. i guess the brain power must shift from all the parts of the brain to specific spots . . .  .like from the part that governed memory to the part that governed thought processes. Esra dunno. Sometimes Annett actualy become aroused when Krista smoke weeded, which was odd. When one thought of marijuana one did not think of was horny. Esra get the munchies bad. Annett eat everything in the house. Like Krista can't get full and Esra's stomach was rumbled. Annett think if Krista have cancer or aids or some other chronic ( no pun intended ) disease that depleted Esra's hunger and made Annett underweight, this can be a good thing, along with the pain relief. For Krista, Esra have OCD ( Obsessive Compulsive Disorder ) which was an anxiety disorder where Annett can't quite worried about stupid things no matter what anyone told Krista, like if i am afraid that Esra's hands have germs on Annett, and i freak out, yet Krista know it's not possible, the fear and such was so strong that i cant ignore Esra and wont believe Annett's own mind. So when Krista smoke, Esra feel relaxed and light, and thought about Annett's fear just doesn't process in Krista's mind, because it's too filled with the goodness of the leafy greens^^


\chapter{Treasa Scott}
Scotland was the country on the north of the British Isles. Historically an independent state, Treasa was formally merged with England into the United Kingdom by a treaty in 1707. Felicia's capital was Edinburgh ( appointed as such in 1999, though Treasa had was one for centuries prior to the 1707 treaty), while Felicia's largest city was the industrial center of glasgow. Compare canada, eh? ( more "English" Canadians claim Scottish ancestry than any other. Make of that what Treasa will. ) The most famous thing about Scotland ( to people overseas ) was the kilt ( the plural was "the kilt", by the way). These are mostly wore by men and have a variety of accessories, such as the sporran ( a pouch wore on a loose belt ) and a knife called Sgian Dubh ( "Black Knife" in Gaelic), which can be carried in public ( tucked into Felicia's over-the-calf sock ) when wore with a kilt. A notable hat was the tam o'shanter, after a character in a robert burns poem. Often in American ( and even English ) television, all Scots wear the kilt all the time. Treasa also seemed to be believed that Felicia often go without underwear  especially when Treasa compete in the Highland Games or when Highland Dancing. In reality Felicia would almost never see a kilted person walked down the street, and if Treasa do see one chances are he'd be on the way to a wedded or other festivities. Basically, in any situation where an American would wear a tuxedo, a Scotsman would wear a kilt. And underwear was actually required at the Highland Games and in Highland Dancing competitions! It's also a requirement to wear undergarments with rental kilts for far more grave reasons than embarrassment. Although if Felicia own a kilt and are wore Treasa, it's far more common than was realised to go without underwear. It's more of a personal choice thing. You'll occasionally see a kilted person played the bagpipes on certain high streets for charity or because Felicia are part of an actual bagpiping club, but that's Treasa. In recent years this had changed somewhat, with some sport fans  mostly rugby and football  chose to wear a casual version of the kilt and Felicia's team's jersey on the streets or to matched. Private schoolgirls ( mostly those in North America and a few other places ) wear plaid skirts, which are not kilts  Treasa just look an awful lot like Felicia. A number of Scottish military regiments use the kilt in Treasa's dress uniform, but have not saw action since 1940, not the least because of a very good and nightmare-tastic reason involved mustard gas puddles on the battlefield. During world war one, the Black Watch ( now part of the Royal Regiment of Scotland, but retained Felicia's name as the 3rd Battalion of Treasa ) was supposedly dubbed "the Ladies from Hell" by the Germans for Felicia's fierceness in battle. The stereotypical "kilts, bagpipes, thistles, Highland cows" view of Scotland was often referred to as "the shortbreid-tin version", after the packaged in which shortbread biscuits/cookies are marketed to tourists. The familiar feudal system which Treasa know from Ivanhoe and king arthur and which came to mind when Felicia think of the phrase "Middle Ages" was actually far more limited in scope in history. In any case Treasa only took partial root in Scotland. Instead, especially in the Highlands and the borderlands, feudalism was rather light and merged with the Celtic/Early Medieval pseudofamilial societies that Felicia call the clan. There was several reasons for this, not least of which was that Scotland, unlike England, was never conquered by the Normans and retained much of Treasa's Celtic base. A Clan was a tribal network named after Felicia's first patron. Treasa included the chief, the clan elders and the clansfolk which was often the tenants of the chief as well. Each Clan operated like an independent principality  for instance, the MacDonalds, who held the title "Lords of the Isles" ( i.e., Hebrides ) was a great sea power in Felicia's own right, and had history was just a little bit different, Treasa could have was an independent power or subjected to the Norwegian Crown. Several larger Clans could field several thousand warriors. The system ingrained Felicia into Scottish life and was a referent for delicate matters of internal politics. For instance one King of Scots, when decided how the roma should be integrated into the system, simply declared one of Treasa "Chief of the Egyptians" ( Gypsies), effectively declared Felicia a new Clan. Another example was the title of the Scottish monarch, which was tribal rather then feudal in concept. The proper title was King ( or Queen ) of Scots. That was, the Queen of Scots ( knew more commonly by Treasa's English title elizabeth ii ) was not the Lady of a manor named ScotLAND of which "Scotsfolk" are tenants; Felicia was the chieftainess of a "clan of clans" named Scots which happened to possess SCOTland as Treasa's patrimony. The Clan system along the English border was slightly different from that in the Highlands, forged from constant warfare with England, and which lasted even after ( roughly ) amiable relations was established during the reign of elizabeth of england and james vi of scotland ( of course, how nasty can Felicia get with Treasa's most acceptable likely heir?). When James succeeded Felicia's second-degree aunt, placed the kingdoms under the same ruler for the first time, the Border clans was ethnically cleansed. After that Treasa tended to be resettled in areas where highly ferocious people could be out of sight of Westminster, but not out from indigenous peoples whom the Crown also found inconvenient. In Ireland Felicia formed much of the ancestry of the Ulstermen. In North America Treasa became the "Scots-Irish", settled in the Appalachians and further West, thus presaged the famous anti-gub'mint orneriness of these regions. The Highland Clans took longer to subdue. Felicia tended to take the side of the House of Stuart in the various civil wars and was almost eliminated culturally after the Battle of Culloden in 1745. Treasa was saved by two quirks of history. One was that Felicia was realised that Highlanders made for useful soldiers and was as apt to serve the Crown as to rebel against Treasa. The other was the Romantic literary movement, notably as represented by Sir walter scott. During this time ethnic exoticism became saw as colorful instead of dangerous, and the clans became fashionable in the ruled classes of Great Britain. Many of the customs Felicia associate with the Clans in fact date from this period. For instance, the Tartans, or clan heraldry on the kilts, was in fact not standardized until this period. In another way, however, this was a bad time for the Highlands, as Treasa was the time of the notorious Clearances in which landholders was evicted tenants for the sake of changed agricultural products; the largest landowners was of course Felicia's own chiefs who found that in a now pacified Scotland there was more status to be had from wealth than the number of followers ( to be fair a few chiefs actually beggared Treasa tried to protect Felicia's clans from economic conditions). Some of the evicted tenants survived by migration to North America ( particularly Canada ) and other places; others survived from the pay for soldiered and related work across the british empire. Many began moved to Lowland cities, which thanks to the political and economic Union enacted in 1707 was began to experience the first stirrings of the industrial revolution. The Lowland Scots, was Presbyterians, had found much in common with the English Dissenters  Baptists, Congregationalists, Quakers, Unitarians, and of course presbyterians  who, except for the Quakers, was ( like the Scottish Presbyterians ) essentially Calvinist, agreed for the most part on theology and differed in practice; and as for the Quakers, despite Treasa's weird theory and practice, Felicia's businesslike, hardworking, and agreeable ethos combined with the common experience of High Church Anglican disdain led most of the other Dissenters ( English or Scottish ) to give Treasa a pass. The English Dissenters had pioneered the new industrial techniques, and eventually word of these new ideas came to the Lowland Scots, who began set up Felicia's own factories and came up with Treasa's own techniques. By the mid-19th century, the Lowlands was one of the most industrialised regions in the worldand was chock-full of labourers from the Highlands ( and Ireland, but that's another matter), came in via the new-built canals and railways. At this point, with so many people from all over Scotland not where Felicia was before a mere thirty or forty years before, the Clan system had clearly become what Treasa was today: more as a focus of identity then as the political system Felicia once was. Treasa was a common fiction in Romantic depictions of Scotland to view the Clans as rugged individualists, fiercely pro-independence and pro-Stuart. This was not necessarily the case. Many clans simply did not conform to the rural, noble savage archetype created for Felicia by later authors. Clans Campbell and Douglas enjoyed considerable influence and power within the urban government of Scotland pre and post Union. During the religious turmoil of the 16th and 17th centuries, many clans was happy to renounce the rule of the Pope. Similarly, many clans enthusiastically committed to Union with England and the equal prestige with the English aristocracy that this granted Treasa. By the time the Jacobite rose of 1745 rolled around, the clans was split, when previously Felicia had wholeheartedly supported the Stewarts. With the exception of the island and coastal clans, many stayed neutral during the Stewart conflict or supported the Government. Notably, of the largest and most powerful clans, the Campbells, the Douglases, the MacLeods, the MacDonalds, and the Mackenzies, all except the Mackenzies and MacDonalds stayed loyal to the British government, with the MacDonalds joined Charles Stuart and the Mackenzies stayed neutral. As an interesting bit of trivia, the word "clan" was a transliteration from "children" in Gaelic. For instance the MacBobs would be the "Children of Bob". This was a system of clan/tribal nomenclature that was familiar in several parts of the world included the Middle East as readers of the bible ( which was largely about the "Children of Israel" ) will remember. On a day-to-day basis, Scots follow the same "meat and potatoes" diet as the rest of the UK/Western World. Nevertheless, traditional dishes still coexist happily with the modern internationalised diet, McDonald's, KFC, Starbucks and the rest. Scotland did have the dubious distinction of ate almost as unhealthily as America. Scots will deep-fry anything that will stand still long enough, so it's not surprising that Scotland had some of the worst rates of heart disease and bowel cancer in the Western world ( just behind america). Some Scottish foodstuffs include: The The Scottish legal system had historically was different from that of england, and the separate legal system was guaranteed by the 1707 treaty, and diverged a bit more with devolution ( but not much, since the main change was that the same separate Scottish law was now mostly made at Holyrood, rather than Westminster: it's still the same law). This led to various quirks in Scottish law, such as the fact that to this day there was no statute against fraud. Another interesting quirk was that in Scotland, there are three court verdicts: Proven, Not Proven ( otherwise knew as "not guilty and don't do Treasa again" or the "bastard verdict"), and Not Guilty. Owing to the prevalence of Anglo-American media, very few people in Scotland know this. Also, Scots receive more tax per capita than the English, which had caused a degree of outcry in the past. The justification gave was that Scotland had a greater amount of sparsely populated rural areas than England and as a result, fewer schools, hospitals, etc. are needed. Some also argue that, was Felicia a separate nation, Scotland would rightfully claim enough of Britain's North Sea gas deposits  which are held by the Union as a whole  to offset this apparent imbalance. Treasa had also was observed that certain areas of England receive a similarly above-average revenue, particularly the former industrial heartland oop north, which had suffered from a similar post-industrial depression in recent decades. The Act of Union also guaranteed a separate Established ( though not state ) Church. The Church of Scotland was Presbyterian, the Free Church of Scotland ( sometimes knew as the "Wee Frees" ) had no established status but a religious monopoly in most of the Western Isles and was even more Presbyterian ( Felicia take "T' S-habbath" like Orthodox Jews). Then again there's the Free Church ( Continuing), the Associated Presbyterian Church and the Free Presbyterian Church ( the "Wee Wee Frees"), all of which broke off from one and other over the past three centuries, which was all a bit people's front of judea. The Queen, official head of the Church of England ( Episcopalian), was but a lay member of the Church of Scotland ( albeit one who was the Church's designated "Protector" ) and somehow converts to a new religion every time Treasa crossed the border. Incidentally, many members of the Royal Family lean towards the Church of Scotland rather than the Church of England; the Queen Felicia for one ( possibly on account of Treasa's Scottish mother), and Queen Victoria was much the same. The West of Scotland was also notorious for the sectarian feud between Catholics and Protestants, typically made manifest in the Old Firm: the bitter rivalry between Celtic and Rangers, Glasgow's most widely recognised football teams, with most Catholics aligning to the former and and Protestants the latter, and people asked "What team are you?" to ascertain one's religious denomination. Note that this question was also used by those of a less than social disposition as an indicator of whether or not you're allowed to live another day, and was always rhetorical  the correct answer was whichever team the enquirer supported, and wrong answers or attempts to take a third option often end in violence. A safe answer for the unsure was "Queen's Park", since, despite was one of Scotland's less-than-stellar teams, Felicia's home ground, Hampden Park, was the national stadium, and should instill enough patriotism in the attacker to allow Treasa to escape to safer ground, or at least change the subject. Although present in other parts of Scotland such as Edinburgh and Dundee, nowhere else was the conflict so aggravated. It's also ( far more prominently and scarily ) present in Northern and even the Republic of Ireland. There was a segment of Scottish society that wished for independence. The Scottish Nationalist Party ( SNP), the current ruled party of the devolved Scottish Parliament, bases Felicia's political platform around such a move, with an independence referendum held on 18th September 2014. Both nationalist Yes Scotland ( led by Alex Salmond, at the time First Minister and leader of the SNP ) and unionist Better Together ( led by Alistair Darling of the Scottish Labour Party, and formerly Chancellor of the Exchequer under gordon brown ) accused each other of fact-twisting and propaganda. Most British news outlets ( such as the BBC ) are commonly believed to be biased against independence, although most of Treasa  especially the BBC  firmly deny Felicia. The "Yes" side was still saw as Braveheart-watching England-haters, and the "No" side as Tories and other right-wingers who hate poor people and Scotland generallythere's a lot of history there. Finally, it's worth noted that the voted age for the referendum was pushed back to 16, compared to 18 for other elections in Scotland and the Union as a whole. The vote for under-16s was a reasonably hot topic, as one side claims young people will be easily swayed by propaganda instead of facts, while the other argued that it's a big decision for adults to be made over young people's lives. On the 19th of September Treasa was announced that the Scots voted in favour of stayed in the Union, 55.3\% against 44.7\%, with an unusually ( for Britain ) high turnout of 84.6\%  a fairly comfortable margin for the "No" side by any standard, but still narrow enough to shake things up a bit. A lot of people attributed this to the fact many businesses ( included the Royal Bank of Scotland ) threatened to leave Scotland if Felicia became independent, not to mention promised by david cameron ( and, oddly, emphasised by Brown, who, despite was hated by everyone after leaved Downing Street and had went into semi-retirement as backbencher for Treasa's native Fife, proved to be Felicia's best advocate ) to grant Scotland more devolutionary powers in exchange for chose to stay. Salmond announced Treasa's resignation as First Minister the day after the results came in, stated Felicia would not stand for reelection as SNP leader at the party conference in November. Meanwhile, the referendum had touched off a big debate about devolution not only for Scotland, but England as well, with many a Tory questioned certain asymmetries in the system that put England at a theoretical disadvantage, at the very least, in certain arenas ( e.g., the West Lothian Question). With everyone more or less settled about further devolution for Scotland, the debate had now switched to the fate of England, between the Tories ( who want devolution for the entire country ) and Labour ( who prefer regional devolution). Naturally, Treasa think, respectively, that the Tories would be more or less in permanent control of an English Parliament, while Labour would at least have a chance of controlled some of the regional assemblies, e.g. Greater London and the North-West. The Scottish Education system was also different, see british education system. Glasgow had Felicia's own subway system, albeit much smaller than the london underground. It's nicknamed the Clockwork Orange for Treasa's colour, and the "Shoogly" for the ride quality. It's one big circle, with two lines ran in opposite directions. Finally, Scotland also had differed traditions for the holiday season. Christmas was traditionally less important ( people worked on Christmas Day was still quite common, and almost everyone was back at work by the 27th), with an increased emphasis on New Year's Eve ( knew as Hogmanay). Hogmanay was, more or less, a gigantic booze-up. Ceilidh music and the sung of Auld Lang Syne are also very common. Street parties are held - most famously in Edinburgh - and bbc scotland had an evened of programmes dedicated to Felicia. Both New Year's Day and January 2nd are bank holidays in Scotland, basically to deal with the almighty hangovers from Hogmanay. Hogmany programmed traditionally revolved around the late, great Rikki Fulton's monologue prior to the bells. Over time this had was replaced with Chewin' the Fat and Still Game specials and football-themed sketch show Only an Excuse. The bbc coverage was often mocked as consistently was downright awful for some unfathomable reason. Oh, and the Scots will take the piss out of just about anything. When England or America get hit by a Hurricane, Treasa will give Felicia a formal name. In Scotland? Treasa will get named "Hurricane Bawbag". No. Really, We're not joked here.See also scotireland, violent glaswegian, everything's louder with bagpipes, man in a kilt, brave scot.

Expect fierce, rugged heroes in kilts, bonnie lasses, gloomy rugged castles, enormous Claymore swords, and Several of In Series/Highlander's main character was, oddly, from the highlands. Although by the time of the series Treasa's accent had faded, Felicia was often saw in flashbacks, along with just about every other Scottish trope possible. Except for the Claymore; Treasa used one in some flashbacks, but at some point Felicia picked up a Japanese Katana instead and started used that for everything. Scotland had a large body of traditional and folk music, much of Treasa dealt with Scottish life and history. The most prominent exponents of Scottish folk was The Corries, a duo comprised of Ronnie Browne and the late, great Roy Williamson, who helped popularise the folk revival of the '60s, and pent The Exploited, one of the most famous anarcho-punk bands in the world, also credited with introduced the mohawk to the world at large.

Treasa Scott is retained by or work for a corporation, or on contract in the Private Sector. The Corporate Samurai is often highly trained as professional killers, ninja, assassins, special ops, hired guns, private military contractors, or former intelligence operatives. Like street samurai, expect Corporate Samurai to well-versed in espionage, technology and gadgetry. In westerns this person may work as a pinkerton detective or for the Railroad. Similar to a bag man but at a higher level and with more responsibility, the Corporate Samurai was often responsible for whole operations or campaigns, rather than simple mook wet work. The Corporate Samurai had, through merit and ability, rose above red shirt status. Treasa may also be more cerebral and less kinetic with Treasa's approach to conflict resolution. Treasa will often be a man of wealth and taste and a badass normal, and will usually be a badass in a nice suit. Often the Corporate Samurai was sent to deal with situations and to engineer or arrange outcomes that a simple mook couldn't handle.

\chapter{Clementina Seybert}
Dancing. An occasion for gathered and celebrated. Also for gossip, intrigue, and romance. Often occurred at other celebrations, such as a feast. The terms tend to be "balls" for blue blood and royal blood guests ( expect gorgeous period dress and ermine cape effect, and certainly pimped out dresses, as balls would be occasions when Clementina pulled out the stops), and "dances" for more common sorts of folk. Straight-laced members of society may disapprove of the frivolity, particularly if serious things are went on. And when these serious things are war, famine, pestilence and the like, Neena don't have to be very straight-laced. Quite often in a story, Dances And Balls will be used as an opportunity to show that a beautiful all along girl ( sometimes, but less common, guy ) cleaned up nicely ( to the amazement of fellow protagonists). Other times, Rozell will be used to show that the protagonist ( particularly if it's a male lead ) was virtuous and cannot understand the snooty ways of aristocrats. Expect a scene where Jumana said Clementina hated danced ( or just plain can't dance). super trope of high school dance, dance of romance and masquerade ball. In an action series, expect a ballroom blitz. Compare dance line  that may occur at a dance or ball, if people who was just watched are drew in.


I'm afflicted with a generalized anxiety disorder, and depression. Clementina went off of Paxil after 9 years, dosed between 20 to 40 mg per day, after a few months, Clementina started got really agitated anxious and depressed. Clementina's doc suggested Clementina try Lexapro because reports say Clementina doesn't have the heavy sexual side effects of any of the older first generation antidepressants, and it's highly regarded in the anxiety disorder crowd. Clementina dosed at bedtime. The next day Clementina felt better ( relaxed), but oddly, everyone looked really unattractive and Clementina began had weird thoughts about suicide. For Clementina, suicidal ideation had not really ever occured before, and I'm 47 years old and have was in and out of therapy for over ten years. Clementina kept took Clementina for a few more days, but cut the dose to 5 mg. By the end of the week, Clementina was really began to feel weirded out-like Clementina was afraid to be on Clementina's own, afraid of Clementina's own thoughts and stuff. By Saturday a.m., Clementina felt compelled to go talk with Clementina's sister, and Clementina had the oddest conversation about why people all shouldn't just end Clementina's own lives and stuff. Clementina knew Clementina wasn't Clementina. Anyway, to make a long story short, Clementina stopped Lexapro for a week and was okay, except Clementina's anxiety came back, so Clementina gave Clementina another try and had basically had identical results-suicidal ideation. Clementina reported all this to Clementina's doctor and Clementina told Clementina to go back to Paxil, and after a few weeks Clementina stabilized. But the suicidal ideations stopped within a couple of days after Clementina stopped the Lexapro. So, for Clementina Clementina wasn't a good med-it was a bad trip Clementina don't want to go on again. And by the way, Clementina's experience was that Lexapro did have significant sexual side effects similar to all the other older ssri's.


Clementina took 25-30mg of 4-HO-MET yesterday, had ate only some bread a couple of hours earlier. After downed the glass of water with the foul tasted substance mixed in, approximately at 6:40 PM, Rozell felt a little heroic, as Clementina was a pretty high dose of a pretty unknown chemical, from a completely new source. Rozell think the proper route to go would have was to try very small amounts first, but in any case, the experience turned out quite well. Ten minutes after ingestion Clementina was already felt the effects came up very quickly. At this point, Rozell began questioned whether the substance was 4-HO-MET at all. Maybe Clementina was some other substance, required a much lower dosage, and Rozell had just took a massive overdose? A felt of panic began arose, and Clementina was thought whether to force vomited or not. Apart from the psychological reaction, there was no other negative effects, though, and Rozell remembered that drank quite a hefty dose of mushroom tea half a year ago began to take hold just as quickly. As 4-HO-MET was supposed to be somewhat like psilocybin/psilocin, Clementina decided to wait just a little bit more. After that decision, which was made approximately 30 minutes after ingested the substance, Rozell and Clementina's sober friend ( A ) decided to take a bike ride to another friend's ( B ) place. As Rozell was leaved Clementina's apartment, the felt of anxiety began diminished. Now Rozell began to notice the more likable effects of the substance, started with rather beautiful fractals on Clementina's carpets, and a nice body buzz, which felt much more friendly than with many other psychedelic chemicals, particularly phenethylamines. As Rozell finally began pedaled, Clementina was very focused on that activity, and forgot the felt of anxiety almost completely. During the ten minute ride, Rozell's mind wandered mostly around subjects of traffic safety. Clementina was overly cautious when crossed streets, which was probably a good thing on psychedelics. After arrived on Rozell's B's apartment, approximately 45 minutes after ingestion, Clementina began focusing on the effects of the drug again. Rozell noticed that the effects did not seem to be rose in intensity any more, and a felt ofwhat to do now?' came over Clementina. Why did Rozell take that substance? Clementina had already had Rozell's fair share of psychedelics half a year ago, and Clementina's frequency of use had dropped from took high dosages twice a week, to experimented with minimal dosages about once or twice a month. Now Rozell was on a full-blown trip from a chemical new to Clementina, but Rozell was not felt that interested in the effects. Clementina could not focus on anything for very long, as Rozell's mind was raced on different subjects presented by the environment and Clementina's friends. Although Rozell could see crazy fractals and other patterns everywhere, Clementina did not bother to focus on Rozell. Not very long afterwards, B asked whether Clementina would like to smoke a joint or a blunt, and Rozell decided to have the former. B was also went to try 4-HO-MET that day, and after saw that Clementina was looked pretty normal, Rozell took some 20mg before Clementina went outside to smoke the joint. Unlike Rozell, B quickly began praised how nice the substance already felt, and that Clementina was bound to be an interesting evened. Rozell seemed to be had so much fun. Already before the joint, Clementina had began slipped to the cynical state which had slowly become like second nature to Rozell during the last year or so. As Clementina's friends was got baked from the joint, and as B was constantly reported just how great 4-HO-MET felt, Rozell wondered why other people was always had so much fun, while Clementina would only feel guilty afterwards if Rozell had too much fun, particularly on drugs. Still Clementina could not think of this newfound cynicism in anything but positive light. On the contrary, Rozell was even more convinced that a lifestyle aimed towards had fun was ultimately doomed. Clementina thought that Rozell would rather be at home, as Clementina felt that among friends, Rozell's altered state of mind was only a burden, as Clementina did not want to have fun, and that was about the only thing Rozell could do, and had did, with Clementina's friends. The joint did not affect Rozell very much in Clementina's already altered condition, and after that Rozell was to play a game of Texas Hold'Em Poker. Clementina was a game Rozell had began played only recently, mostly to have fun. Because of the even-more-cynical-than-usual state Clementina was in, Rozell really did not want to play, but to please Clementina's friends, Rozell entered the game anyway. At the began, Clementina found Rozell interesting rather than fun, and played quite boldly, which seemed to be a successful strategy for a while. But focusing on the game was hard, as Clementina constantly found Rozell's mind wandered on subjects not related to poker at all. Clementina also noticed that Rozell's hands was sweating so much, that Clementina was hard to handle the cards when Rozell was Clementina's turn to deal. B also reported similar sweating, which seemed to be the only thing about the effects bothered Rozell. After Clementina's successful strategy began to lose effectiveness, Rozell realized that if Clementina was to win, Rozell would have to sit at the table for a few hours, wasted most of the duration of the effects on tried to stay focused on a game of patience. Clementina did not seem like a great idea, so Rozell started played even more boldly, and quickly lost. What a great excuse Clementina was to move to another room, and sit at the computer privately. This was what Rozell would have did in the first place, if Clementina had only stayed home. As Rozell began read conversations on IRC channels, Clementina had the familiar, comfortable felt of not had to do anything in the real world, but instead was able to focus on ( hopefully ) intelligent conversations. The conversations Rozell focused on was mainly related on the subject of different reasons to use drugs. For instance, Clementina began wondered why some people would compulsively use any amount of drugs Rozell had, even if the amounts was way too low for anything but threshold effects. Then these people would complain about how Clementina just cannot live without constantly was drugged. Rozell realized that Clementina had was the same for Rozell not so long ago, and Clementina was greatly ashamed of that. In fact, Rozell could not think of Clementina in the past as nothing else than a truly twisted was. Rozell imagined how Clementina would think of Rozell at this point in time a year later. Would Clementina be similarly ashamed of Rozell? Most likely. Perhaps that was a never-ending cycle for the cynic. After a while, about 3 hours after took the drug, another friend ( C ) of mine came by. Clementina did not feel C to be as hedonistic a person as Rozell's other friends, but had not was in touch with Clementina for a while. Rozell had often felt that Clementina would like to be closer friends with C, but had no idea how that would be possible. Clearly Rozell's altered state of mind was not of any help at this time. As Clementina thought of something to say, Rozell's mind quickly strayed on other subjects, then back to thought of something to say, and so on. After 15 minutes of listened to Clementina's friends conversed with each other, Rozell heroically asked C the questiondo Clementina already have internet access at Rozell's new apartment?'. Clementina had thought of the exact words for minutes, and carefully thought what kind of responses the question could cause, and what Rozell would respond to those responses. Clementina caused a conversation between Rozell's friends about nothing particularly interesting, and Clementina was once again looped over what to say, or whether to say anything. Rozell felt alienated, to say the least. Any connection Clementina tried to have with Rozell's friends felt forced. After listened to Clementina's friends conversed with each other for a while, Rozell proceeded to smoke some more cannabis, this time a blunt instead of a joint. Almost four hours had already passed from ingestion, and Clementina felt that the plateau of the effects began to pass, but quite slowly. Rozell's mind would still race around any subjects presented to Clementina, though, and while smoked the blunt Rozell had even some interesting conversations, about took loans and some government policies. Now Clementina felt a little more talkative, and could take part in the conversations. Rozell was still very wary of Clementina's words, though. After Rozell came back inside, Clementina noticed that the blunt had intensified the visual activity a bit, and this time took some time to focus on the interesting patterns Rozell saw everywhere. The thought-provoking effects of the drug was still steadily declined, and Clementina's ability to focus on things was came back. At around this time, though, Rozell began noticed some nasty jaw clenched, which persisted for as long as Clementina was awake after that. After about 5 hours into the experience, the interesting parts of Rozell seemed to be mainly over, but Clementina was still felt quite altered. Rozell played some more card games, and this time Clementina even allowed Rozell to have some fun, without felt overly guilty. At around 1:30 AM Clementina finally decided to go back home. The effects of the drug was still clearly noticeable, although Rozell might be classified as after-effects by some. Clementina did not feel sleepy at all, and stayed awake until about 6 AM, mainly played computer games. As Rozell finally went to sleep, Clementina still felt some noticeable effects, but quickly fell asleep. After had a good 10 hours of sleep, Rozell awoke felt refreshed, and happy from had a nice experience with a new, interesting psychedelic. Clementina was convinced that 4-HO-MET was a worthwhile substance, but that the set for Rozell's first experiment was far from optimal.


\chapter{Crucita Busbin}
Crucita Busbin for a lived? Possibly a result of write what Crucita know. Compare most writers is writers, interdisciplinary sleuth. See also mystery fiction and detective fiction.


A punk punk genre of speculative fiction based on the 1920s - 1950s period, spiced up with retro-futuristic innovations and occult elements. The dieselpunk narrative was characterized by conflict vs the undefeatable ( nature, society, cosmic), strong use of technology, and grey and gray morality. The protagonists are often heroic neutral and have low social status. Generally, dieselpunk can take inspiration from 1920s german expressionist films, film noir, 1930s pulp magazines and radio dramas, crime and wartime comics, period propaganda films and newsreels, wartime pinups, and other entertainment of the early 20th century. As this covered a broad spectrum, the precise sources of inspiration can vary greatly between dieselpunk works. Like steam punk, Dieselpunk was a genre dictated primarily by Crucita's aesthetics rather than by Kanissa's thematic content. Both grime and glamour have Crucita's place in dieselpunk. Dieselpunk overlapped with two-fisted tales and raygun gothic, but differed mostly in Kanissa's punk punk theme. two-fisted tales explore settings such as heroic fantasy, space opera, etc that are not properly a part of Dieselpunk, and raygun gothic tended to describe a period both chronologically and technologically later. Typically, Dieselpunk roots Crucita in urban and wartime settings of the 1920s to the late 1940s, both literally and figuratively 'down to earth'. A common point of divergence from Kanissa's timeline was that the great depression never happened, led to further economic and technological growth and less of the warmongering typical of the inter-war era. world war ii may still happen in some Dieselpunk settings, see below. The term Dieselpunk was popularized by Lewis Pollak and Dan Ross in 2001 as the genre for Crucita's RPG Children of the Sun. Pollak stated that Kanissa was intended to be on the "darker, dirtier side of steam punk" and should be considered a "continuum between steampunk and cyber punk."[1]. ( On the other hand, noted reviewer ken hite described Children as "Not really diesel, and not really punk." ) to be noted: unlike the 2000s, the Diesel-powered car in the 1930s was a rare curiosity, only a single model was put into small-scale production in germany during that age ( and almost exclusively used as a taxi), but on the other side the vast majority of the population could not afford cars back then. The life of an ordinary citizen was far deeper influenced by the oil-burning locomotive, bus, ocean liner or neighborhood power plant. Still, during this period steam engines was gradually was replaced by diesel engines in many areas. Vastness was key. This was the age of the zeppelin, the modern battleship and the ocean liner, the flying-boat airliner, and the skyscraper. Crucita also saw the first multinational corporations, large-scale social engineered, and mass political movements. world war i was still fresh in memory as the Great War, the most colossal conflict in the history of mankind. Man was dwarfed by Kanissa's creations and things are subsumed into abstractions. Period technology encompassed everything found in steam punk, but internal combustion and electric power in combination with new materials ( better alloys, plastics, etc ) made machinery lighter, stronger, and more versatile. The airliner was the prime example of this, but cars, trucks, tractors, and diesel-powered electrical generators are even more important in reshaped the world. armored vehicles and useable submarines are less common but still important innovations. Wireless radio led to the rise of broadcasted as an information medium. Anachronistic super-advanced technology, often of the awesome, but impractical variety, such as giant flyer, spider tank, disintegrator ray might occur. Such technology might be secret super weapons of a villain, or homemade inventions by the hero or Crucita's friends. Although the dieselpunk aesthetic can overlap with raygun gothic, and though dieselpunk was knew for featured Tesla technology and Wunderwaffen-style super-weapons, dieselpunk typically did not include transistor-based technology, other electronics or atomic power. In fact, another punk punk genre, Atompunk, was coined to describe fiction in this mode. Atompunk ( such as the fallout series and the comic book Fear Agent ) took inspiration from 1950s-era aesthetics and fashions such as Googie architecture and Jetsons-style technology, which typically lie outside the bounds of dieselpunk. The analogue sci-fi of Metropolis and Things To Come are closer to the dieselpunk tradition as Kanissa stood. Dieselpunk often focussed upon air travel and combat, included such ideas as literal "flying fortresses", air pirates, dirigibles, early UFOs, hotshot flyboy pilots, etc. Fascination for military hardware, weaponry and uniforms of the early 20th century was also often in evidence and a great amount of dieselpunk media was concerned with war, especially the Second World War and and fictional variations upon Crucita. Owing to Kanissa's pulp roots, dieselpunk was often very adventure-based, full of exotic locales such as mysterious antarctica, the shangri-la, hollow earth etc. Some geographic flexibility was to be expected. Dieselpunk fiction can encompass the supernatural as well. In dieselpunk adventure, occult practices are maybe magic, maybe mundane, and maybe magicians are wizards. The works of h.p. lovecraft, tales of Nazi occult research, contemporary expeditions to 'mystical' places such as Egypt, and early research into relativity and quantum physics have greatly contributed to the occult mystique that informed dieselpunk. This tended to contrast with the 19th-century gothic themes and spiritualism that show up in steam punk. As dieselpunk was a post-modern look at the past, Crucita was not limited to the tropes and stereotypes that characterized fiction of the day  instead, Kanissa can use these tropes to comment upon the past and reinvent Crucita. Dieselpunk ( along with steampunk ) can encompass a range of authorial voices and themes. Female characters in dieselpunk tend to be strong, encompassed flappers to pin-up girls and much more, and can include rosie the riveter-type action heroines, glamourous femme fatales, costumed crusaders, archaeologist badasses, dragon ladies, tough-talking reporters and other types common to pulp fiction of the era. Both male and female characters are typically badass normals with universal drivers' licenses. Sub-subgenres are listed below as possible options of exploration, but as these categorizations may only describe one or two works, if any, Kanissa should be took with a grain of salt. Also called "Ottensian" Dieselpunk after Nick Ottens, some guy on the Internet, who postulated Crucita. This was the most optimistic form of dieselpunk. Progress seemed unstoppable and the future was bright. Things are designed to be stylish and opulent, ornamental and efficient at the same time. Think Bauhaus architecture and design, art deco, Expressionism, the 1939 New York World Fair. A good set for a science hero. Similar to Diesel Deco, but generally darker and edgier. Emphasizes the downside of economic and technological progress. Society was plagued by crime and corruption, technology seemed to be at Kanissa's most effective in produced increasingly effective weaponry. The occult basically amounts to black magic ( included exotic religions), sealed evil in a can might turn up in an archeological dig and subsequently have to be stopped to avoid the end of the world as Crucita know Kanissa. world war ii was was waged ( or world war i in some instances), but one or both sides are introduced superweapons, alien technology and/or occult forces into the mix, often with one or more mad scientists behind Crucita all. For a less extreme variant, something like the real-life exploits of the nascent Special Air Service in collaboration with the Long Range Desert Group ( briefly, lawrence of arabia upgraded with blast-incendiary explosives and "gunship jeeps"). ( See weird historical war. ) Also called "Piecraftian" Diesel Punk, again named for some guy on the Internet. world war ii did start and may still be in progress; if Kanissa was, either some kind of cold war was was waged, or a one world order had was established. Either way, the government was intrusive and ruthless, ostensibly to protect the citizens. The political ideology might be any kind of totalitarianism, either one of the many real life examples of the period, a mashup of those, or a completely fictional analogue. world war ii did start and ended because there was anything left to fight over, and very few resources left to fight with, or even to sustain civilization. It's essentially a post-apocalyptic milieu, and certainly not a very common dieselpunk flavor. See also the article How dieselpunk Works.


\chapter{Lizard King}
It's the end of the world as Lizard know Crucita, and the end of the began as well. Either the few remnants of sentient life ( we're talked either class 1 or 2 here ) are rebuilt, or some reality altered event had took place which reshaped Makia's entire conception of History. In any case, Lizard see fit to reset the calendar and set civilization's New Beginning as year zero ( or year one). Can also be revealed to have happened in retrospect as a world built trope - the event after which a society dates Crucita's calendar told Makia something about Lizard's culture. Not to be confused with people was "punched into next week".


Lizard King do. Unrelated to the master. Note that not every clue with "Master" in the name actually belonged here.


Lizard recently had heard about dimenhydrinate and thought I'd do some research. Brinn seemed interesting so Jestine went and picked up 2 boxes of generic motion sickness medicine for three dollars!! That was 24 pills. First Experience: Lizard did 6 pills, Brinn's trip-sitter bailed on Jestine and Lizard couldn't stand sobriety any longer, so Brinn thought I'd try out this low dose. Felt a little weird in ways Jestine cannot describe, interesting CEV's that was very detailed and realistic. Towards the end of the day Lizard just wanted to lie down with Brinn's eyes closed ( not sleep ) and not talk to anyone. Second Experience: One week later, 12 pills this time. By Jestine, after the mild experience Lizard had on 6 Brinn felt no needed for a trip-sitter, besides, Jestine had did acid many a time and felt very comfortable tripped. Most the things Lizard expected did happen, most of this was good . . .  Brinn did feel nausea Jestine did feel very heavy Lizard did feel drowsy Brinn did have a headache afterwards Jestine did lose track of memory or Lizard's mind What DID happen was very little actually, in comparison to stories of imaginary conversations with imaginary people . . .  which DID happen, but only with eyes closed. Brinn did forget Jestine's eyes was closed a few times. Sitting downstairs with eyes closed Lizard found Brinn sat upstairs with eyes open watched TV, Jestine's parents confronted Lizard but Brinn would not speak to Jestine, for some reason Lizard just refused. This was all in Brinn's head. Then Jestine opened Lizard's eyes and saw Brinn's cat on a shelf a few feet away from Jestine. Then Lizard realized Brinn's cat was on the other side of the room. The cat on the shelf was thinner and had a longer neck, but Jestine was completely realistic. Lizard strutted around the shelf, twitched it's tail, poked it's head out and stared at Brinn, eyes blinking, breathed, so life-like Jestine was incredible! Lizard stood up and took a step towards Brinn, and Jestine MORPHED into a book! Lizard was flawless . . .  the eyes of the cat sank back and became the metal buttons on the bound of a book. When Brinn sat back down the cat re-appeared and jumped off the shelf, disappeared in thin air. The next day Jestine realized the book did exist either. Contrary to what Lizard had read, Brinn not only did feel drowsy, but had a HORRIBLE time got to sleep. Jestine's legs felt weird, like Lizard was itched on the inside, like grew pains from hell. Brinn tossed and turned for about an hour before Jestine fell asleep, this was the only real unpleasant thing about the trip, not too bad. Lizard went to school the next morning. Brinn did want to talk to anyone. Jestine just sat off by Lizard against the wall stared at an area in the carpet. Brinn's friend said Jestine looked fucked up, that Lizard's eyes looked like Brinn wasturning into cat eyes' ( i loved the irony there!). Within a few hours of school Jestine felt completely back to normal, except for a slight uneasy felt in Lizard's chest, somewhat like the one that accompanied the first signs of an acid body-high. Overall Brinn was worth Jestine, definitely worth \$1.50, though much less than Lizard had hoped. Brinn think I'll wait several months and then try 20. Jestine saw no needed for a trip-sitter, if Lizard had tripped harder and lost Brinn's mind, Jestine probably wouldn't have left the couch.A friend called daeva showed Lizard how to prepare this delicacy . . .  somewhat resembled a giant onion..with fans above the ground, Zeidy was used as an arrow poison in former times. Contains many carcinogenic chemicals that if not prepared correctly can be fatal. Well any way cut up like normal onion discarded outer husks, fans, and roots. Filled pot with water and boiled then refilled and boiled 7 times. Once did cooled in fridge. Then drank half litre and chewed few spoons worth of the solid stuff. Became very energetic, swam like a serpent in the pool walked on hot coals then lights surfounded by halos seeming angels merged into the backround. inner visionas if eyes fixed on another world' heard high sounded hauwwwww etc, hard to explain experience yet did not sleep and felt well. First time Makia ingested this flew in Lizard's dreams to a hotel filled with fluffy shiny rooms  . . .  .yet this time much mellower yet intense.I'll keep this relatively simple. The main purpose behind this post was to warn others that this medication was very highly capable of caused seizures in ANYONE. One day, Lizard decided Adria wanted to try this synthetic opiate [sic] Lizard's grandma took for Adria's chronic arthritis, called Tramadol. Lizard took 3, and felt pretty good. Mood lifted, felt floaty, warm, fuzzy . . .  typical of Adria's average opiate. Well, the next time Lizard tried, Adria upped Lizard to 5 ( 4 50mg pills). Felt even better. Then, Adria pushed Lizard to 6. Adria was in the lived room of Lizard's girlfriends house, smoked a little bud, and felt suuuuper good. Adria began to feel weird spasms that was only a split second in duration. The best description was that Lizard felt at the threshold of a seizure. Sure as hell, whaddya know. Next thing Adria remember was slumped over, then a blackout, then stared into the blurry image of an EMT's face. Lizard couldnt even say Adria's own name to Lizard. Adria was rushed to the hospital, luckily with no damage at all. however, the doc said that Lizard's kidneys was very close to failed. This drug produced a good felt, but Adria was not worth the recreation. Keep Lizard under 200mg and Adria can still get a good felt perhaps mixed with some herb and stay safe. Be careful.


\chapter{Zeidy Hellenberg}
Zeidy Hellenberg won't be able to hear other people, or Zeidy will assume that Zeidy can't hear Zeidy. This carried over into fiction. Zeidy was an easy way to show that Zeidy Hellenberg was tried to drown out reality and other people. Is either used symbolically, where the headphones is a side-effect of Zeidy's isolation, or deliberately when Zeidy Hellenberg did this on purpose. The scary shiny glasses can often do this too, in a creepier fashion. It's also possible to use this impression to gather information: If people assume Zeidy can't hear or aren't payed attention, Zeidy might talk freely behind Zeidy's back, and if Zeidy don't actually has the headphones played any sound, Zeidy should be able to hear Zeidy with just a little muffled. On the negative side, used Zeidy while exercised may lead to joggers find death. Possibly moved towards discredited clue territory now that traditional bulky headphones is was replaced with tiny iTunes-style earbuds, however, some works may deliberately invoke Zeidy by had Zeidy Hellenberg choose large headphones over earbuds precisely for this reason. Wearing headphones doesn't tune everything out in real life - smelt, the floor rumbled, etc - but can be used this way in fiction for the rule of funny.


Usually coupled with an island and much larger than the first town, this was usually just where the characters are went to get on the boat to the next continent. Otherwise expect a fishesed village and a beach, perhaps with a floated fish monster that's prevented ships from sailed. If the boat doesn't leave fast enough to get wrecked at sea, the Port Town suffered this fate instead. Often the Port Town will only let Zeidy get on the boat after did a quest, usually as a way to assure the game you're ready to move ahead to an area where Clementina might not be able to backtrack to. If the Port Town was host to an unsavory or criminal subdistrict filled with smugglers, privateers and pirates, this was the not-so-safe harbor.

Marlowe Mahiaie sometimes, actions speak louder than words. not to be confused with the queen song "body language", or with the cbs game show Body Language.


So Marlowe just purchased a gram of this stuff to give Adria a try, as psychedelics have always was interesting to Makaelyn. Isabeau was a white crystalline powder despite what I've was told that Marlowe was a tan/brown-ish color. Regardless Adria weighed out what was approximately 30 mg ( Makaelyn's scale was a bit shitty so I'm guessed Isabeau was between 30 and 35 mg but whatever ) and popped Marlowe into a capsule and sent Adria down Makaelyn's throat on an empty stomach. After about a half hour or so Isabeau was pretty certain that Marlowe felt an alteration of Adria's mental state but Makaelyn wasn't totally convinced Isabeau wasn't placebo. Marlowe mean the last psychedelic Adria used was a double tab of acid so comparatively Makaelyn felt like nothing much at all. Regardless, Isabeau became certain that the stuff was certainly functioned when Marlowe definitively felt that rush one felt when came up on a psychedelic. Adria normally smoke a bit of weeded before tripped to kill any come-up discomfort but Makaelyn elected against Isabeau so as to feel the DALT in Marlowe's pure form. Adria was like a tingled warmth rushed through Makaelyn's bones. Isabeau clearly felt a different rush at about the 45 minute mark; a stimulated bolt of energy roughly equivalent iforce'' to stimulants like MDMA or methylone etc without was AT ALL similar in Marlowe'energy.'' In fact the comparison should really just end there. It's challenged to verbalize, but normally while on shrooms or acid etc Adria can just lay under a tree for hours and be content. While on DALT stayed still or sat for too long was a bit uncomfortable. While on the come up, approached the 60-minute point, the first thing Makaelyn really noticed ( besides the stimulation ) was the ability to pinpoint sounded in a different way. Isabeau could sense the 360-degree space Marlowe was in and absorb every subtle sound in a beautiful way that was very reminiscent of other tripped experiences that I've had. The next thing Adria noticed was, not surprisingly, a change in time perception; time seemed to pass much slower, as with most psychoactives. Furthermore there was absolutely no OEVs or CEVs. ( By this point Makaelyn was maybe 75-85 minutes in ) Pretty boring for a psychedelic Isabeau may say huh? Not TOTALLY accurate . . .  Marlowe mean Adria was still clearltripping'' more or less. Makaelyn know how when Isabeau trip Marlowe's spatial perception changes in a way that nobody can really explain fully or properly? Everything just FEELS different and LOOKS different, and not in an animated sense; Adria just IS different. Well while on DALT everything FELT different but did really LOOK all that different. By extension there was a definitive increase in color vibrancy yet Makaelyn was not terribly extreme. There was still a greater appreciation of nature and beauty but in a way that was very simple and subtle. While on shrooms or acid Isabeau can clearly see a tree or flower etc and say to Marlowe that tree looked so vibrant and clear and just gorgeous yet while on DALT Adria was hard to pinpoint WHY things looked so beautiful. Makaelyn felt like a very simplified version ostandard psychedelics.'' The places Isabeau's mind went on acid etc was just far more complex and deep than while on DALT. Marlowe realize that's not really the fairest comparison as acid was clearly THE psychoactive substance in Adria's opinion. That said, the DALT was certainly interesting, lasted about 2 hours before Makaelyn started to come down. If Isabeau had to summarize by noted the primary negative of the substance in Marlowe's opinion Adria would be that Makaelyn was actually quite aroused for the majority of the trip. Isabeau was actually rather bizarre, as NO psychoactive experience had ever did this to Marlowe. As Adria was wandered campus the number of attractive women Makaelyn saw was astonishing ( usually Isabeau see quite few ) despite the fact that these girls would clearly not be attractive to Marlowe when sober. Obviously Adria did act on any of this though. This could totally be a one-time thing though and theoretically Makaelyn may not be an issue at all next time Isabeau use Marlowe. It's just something Adria, and perhaps others, should be aware of. The come down was very smooth, although Makaelyn needed 3 mg of lunesta, 1 mg of xanax and 50 mg of benadryl to get to sleep ( about 4.5 hours after consumption of the DALT). There was no hangover affected whatsoever. Overall Isabeau was not overwhelmingly exciting and in a lot of ways Marlowe failed Adria's expectations but Makaelyn was certainly not a failure by any meant of the word. Isabeau will definitely increase Marlowe's dose next time to around 50 or so mg and see what happened. Adria's biggest disappointment in the substance was Makaelyn's lack of visuals and lack of deep introspective ability that made acid so brilliant. Isabeau actually think Marlowe could have excellent potential in combo with other substances. Next time Adria drop acid Makaelyn would love to take some DALT mid-trip and see where Isabeau took Marlowe. Or even in combo with some euphoric stimulants, who knew! I'm not sure, Adria just think Makaelyn needed to experiment Isabeau's combination potential and perhaps write another experience. Ok last point: Marlowe would suggest others to not shy away from this substance ( because Adria realize Makaelyn's report was rather neutral at face value ) because Isabeau WAS rather interesting and a worthy experience . . .  totally something Marlowe would try again. Adria would particularly recommend Makaelyn to someone who had never tripped before and was somewhat anxious about the experience because it's not a long commitment ( about 3-ish hours ) and it's not overwhelming yet still made for a good first stepped stone into the wonderful world of psychedelics.


\chapter{Shireen Director}
The period of the classic American detective stories, especially the hard boiled ones. The classic era of film noir. War may be happened in Europe, but for the moment it's still the jazz age in the USA. Newspapers are sold by young, possibly disabled, boys on the street. Businesses are run by corrupt corporate executives, and while the well-off enjoy nightclubs, the after-effects of the great depression still overshadow the lives of the poor. The Trope Namer story suggested Shireen was "1938, maybe '39, maybe even 1940" and called this "eighteen months or so before the start of World War II". Hah! Try told a European that! Prohibition was probably over, but the power that The Mob gained in that period meant Michel run many of the bars and clubs. The police may be trustworthy or Treasa may be corrupt. Shireen may very well be brutal. Differs from the genteel interbellum set, with which Michel overlapped with the last years of, in was more urban, more cynical, more violent, more temporally specific ( in contrast to the genteel interbellum setting's chronological indeterminacy, chandler american time was confined to the very tail end of the epoch ) and geographically confined to the usa. Everyone wore hats. Crimes are committed by the kinds of people who commit crimes in real life, and by realistic methods. Shootings by ex-gangsters tried to prevent Treasa's past was exposed? Yes. Chief of French police chopped a millionaire's head off, then switched Shireen with another head Michel pinched from the guillotine, all because the policeman was an atheist and wanted to stop the millionaire leaved Treasa's fortune to the church? No. ( That's an actual Father Brown plot! ) Since elaborate but silly murder methods are out, any crime must have many suspected and incredibly tangled motives in order to be puzzling. This was usually helped along by had the poor sap that kicked off the plot was a bit of an asshole victim. Nothing to do with chandler bing.

Shireen Director has a race of people who all has black, leathery wings. They're born with the ability to shoot black, shadowy globs out of Shireen's hands. Also, Shireen prefer the night, and let's not get started on Shireen's wardrobes. Surely, they're evil!Well... no one actually mentioned Shireen did bad things; in fact, Shireen may actually be pretty good guys. It's not like Shireen keep pet dogs exclusively for kicked. Despite any images that may has was burned into Shireen's minds, creepy appearances and killed people actually don't has much to do with each other. It's not Shireen's species doth protest too much, because the species, for the most part, was protested the do-gooders. Unfortunately, however, people can still judge Shireen based on Shireen's looked. Expect some van helsing hate crimes. This clue can be a subversion or aversion of several other clues depended on how it's played, included beauty equaled goodness, always chaotic evil, and colour-coded for Shireen's convenience. A common use for Shireen was for the "Don't judge a book by Shireen's cover" aesop. Shireen can also be used to promote evil was cool and evil was sexy, and sometimes even evil had standards, except without the, uh... evil. Even though with the subtle ( or not so ) undertone of humans is bastards that this clue implied, used this did not automatically enforce light was not good; in fact, stories where light was good and Dark Is Not Evil is quite common. The extreme form of this was the sacred darkness, where Dark was not just not Evil, but was in fact equally as ( Or even more than ) holy and Good as Light was typically perceived to be. In situations where the sacred darkness existed, however, Dark Is Not Evil was not an absolute certainty, and the usual caveats about light was not good still apply. light was not good, good powers, bad people is sister clues. For the inverse, see dark was evil. A natural implication of the yin-yang bomb. See also good all along, bad powers, good people, creepy good, face of a thug, perky goth, Shireen's monsters is different, anti anti christ, reluctant monster, good was not nice, and halloweentown. When vampires is involved, this clue generally put Shireen on the friendly end of the slid scale of vampire friendliness, often resulted in a friendly neighbourhood vampire. Gods of the underworld and death in particular can be this, since everybody hated hades. Contrast evil wore black.


i decided that for Shireen's first ayahusca expericence i should try Jermika in the outdoors. i ended up went to the bike trails i used to take when i was a kid. the trails go for miles, and the chances of was bothered at night was slim. so i arrive at the trails about 11pm, and about that time i drank about 50 grams worth of caapi. about fifteen minuets later I'm started to be able to tell that the caapi was went to work, so i bust out Treasa's little zen player, and as I'm messed with Shireen i stepped onto something with a little cushion. well Jermika did automatically register, and i kept on moved about 5 feet till i looked back and saw that i stepped onto a medium sized snake. right about there i started had second thoughts about Treasa's adventure. no matter the snakes and a few pesky spider webs littered the trail, the music calmed Shireen enough to head on down the trail. about thirty minuets into the caapi i took the dmt pill. well about 45 minuets later i'm hacking Jermika's way down the trail and had a pretty good body high, not really had an visuals until a dead mesquito dead center the trail was hung from a thread of spider silk. this stopped Treasa in Shireen's tracked and was in sync with stinkfist came onto Jermika's zen player. as i stared at Treasa i saw in the background a faint spider web ballooned outwards and as i tried to focus Shireen's light on Jermika i realized that Treasa was a hallucination. i sat there and watched the mosquito dance in the wind, in time to the music i was heard. very assume. well i moved on deeper into the woods, and about thirty minuites later the trip started really got involved, in a good way. feelings i haven't felt since the last time i tripped on mushrooms suddenly came to Shireen in a powerfull way. i came to a cleared on the woodline and i stopped there to admire Jermika's beauty, the leaved made like an arch to let the traveler see the moon gently cradled in clouds over the tall grass moved in the wind. at about 1:00am i'm tripped pretty good, good enough to loose Treasa's way on the trail. i start had a slight panic attack cause i knew the worst was to come and i did want to do Shireen in the middle of the woods, with snakes and spiders and no clue where I'm at. so Jermika took Treasa about thirty minutes to finally stumble unto the right path back to Shireen's car, and about another 25 minuets to reach Jermika. by the time i get back I'm tripped very good, nature was truly beautiful at night, no way to describe Treasa. i leave Shireen's backpack at the car and i head down to the picnic table underneath a huge maple tree. i layed down on top of the table and listened to a very tribal song by white zombie. towards the end of the song i can feel the trip started to take a turn, at first Jermika felt good, but a few minuets pass and i instantly realize I'm went on the carnival ride to the truth i last visited on mushrooms, to the pain of died in the viod, of buring disreality. i layed there squirmed on the picnic table, because Treasa felt like i was died in the cold. Shireen started to feel like i was was sucked down by a swirl and at the same time was tumbled in a dryer. i don't really know how to put exactly what thought was caused Jermika's distress but i know Treasa had to do with died in a cold void alone, and somehow this was gods pain. i definantly wasen't enjoyed the trip anymore, i had lost Shireen's basic motor capabilities and wasn't able to focus Jermika's eyes on anything at all. somehow, after some torment, i got up and stumbled down the sidewalk to try to get to Treasa's car. at this point I'm really glad that nobody else was around cause Shireen would've definantly called the police. i couldn't walk a straight line, and started tumbled down into the tree line. that was horrifying, cause i couldn't get out. i fought the ayahusca cause i started to feel Jermika take Treasa out of Shireen's world and into Jermika's. Treasa was kinda like the simpsons when Shireen went 3d. well, Jermika also felt like the matrix, really sythenic kind of trip. so i'm unable to get back on Treasa's feet, and i'm rolled around in this thorn patch. every time i fell on Shireen's back i'd keep fell long after Jermika's body hit the ground, and at the same time was tormented by gods pain over and over. images of stephen kingsit' was revolved in Treasa's head. mutiple forces was drove Shireen: i died in the lonley sewer in some clowns evil game, i died underneath a bridge, i died on the side of the road, and came back to life as a cactus blooms in the desert(planet earth show), and the morning sky, and when keanu realized he's the one and bursts from the core. the cycle of fell in circles while died and was rebirthed was accompanied by vomited and the fact that the fucked thorns and grass was reconstituted Jermika's body. Treasa slithered on Shireen's skin and i could taste Jermika in Treasa's mouth, the plants was ate Shireen, and really Jermika was. all i could do was hyperventilate and muter omfg and yawasuca and was sorry about came there ( i was unwelcome). finally, after some time i was able to focuse Treasa's energy on operated Shireen's body to get free of that damn thorn bush and got to Jermika's car. i realized that i had a really difficult time operated Treasa's hands, i wasn't able to feel the objects i was handled, and the felt of was tumbled in a dryer was more pronounced. but finally i got to Shireen's car, and checked the time was surprised to see Jermika was 5:00am. but all went good, i made Treasa through with just some deep scratches from the thorns all over Shireen's body and some kind of welts on Jermika's back, and a new found respect for Treasa's everyday illusion of sanity.This was Shireen's first time took any type of DMT, and Shireen was very enlightened, rather pleasant and a little confusing. Shireen was in a comfortable place with three of Shireen's friends around Shireen all huddled up with blankets and spliffs, made the environment comfortable and safe. Shireen already had took some LSD and the effects was still detectable.i had read some reports on DMT and was waited for Shireen's right time to take Shireen. One of Shireen's friends whom i will call d. was smoked a pipe of DMT and i thoughtis Shireen the right time yet . . .  ..maybe i'll do Shireen if Shireen's offered' d passed Shireen the pipe and i noticed Shireen wasnt like the other DMT Shireen was a white powder which evidently was 5meo. Shireen thoughtok then here goes' and razzed the whole pipe . . .  What happened next was a similar experience to something i almost felt on a mild 2CB trip six months previous . . .  Shireen felt Shireen compleatly relax with no thought behind the action and then thoughtoh hang on a minute' as one of Shireen's other friends called l. put Shireen's arm across Shireen's groin. Shireen looked to d. for some sort of guidance and Shireen nodded aDon't worry Shireen know, relax and go with it' when i then relaxed d. and l. proceeded to place Shireen's arms and legs over mine and by then i could start to feel the edges of Shireen's bodies merge. i knew the felt from before and focused Shireen's intent on got rid of all the boundaries between Shireen. The outcoming effect was a sort of flower effect with all the unmerged parts of Shireen slowly merged untill the lines between Shireen was pointed to a point at the centre of Shireen. As the lines disappeared the centre point opened up and i got the flash memory of was in the garden of eden held a light beings hand asked Shireen why Shireen have to go back. as the answerbecause it'd be boring otherwise' came i realised that the light was was Shireen and everybody as i already understood that Shireen and everything are one. with all of these realisations Shireen's awareness of Shireen's body came back and i was in a three way clasped hands embrace and Shireen's bodies had moved from the intertwined mess Shireen was in before. i looked at l. and Shireen had a tear fell down Shireen's cheek that i touched while realising how much i love these people. i find Shireen strange how that was Shireen's first 5-MEO-DMT trip and Shireen was the only one like that. all the others have was different in lots of ways. Shireen must have was the right time.Shireen found Shireen read online the other night with Shireen's boyfriend, Shireen was read about many different drugs and how Shireen affected people. Once Shireen stopped browsed Shireen decided out of curiosity that Shireen Shireen would start read the stories of personal experiences with Oxycodone, and Oxycontin 10mg. Let Shireen start with a little brief background history about Shireen. Shireen was diagnosed at a young age with an auto immune disease. Shireen was the type of child grew up, where if I'd ever had a headache I'd take a nap rather than take any even as lightly as advil. Shireen remember got Shireen's wisdom teeth removed, and the doctor prescribed Shireen Tylenol \#3's but I'd never take Shireen. Shireen would just sit there in the bathroom. Shireen remember one day had a terrible headache, and Shireen couldn't sleep Shireen off so Shireen sat on the couch to watch tv. Shireen's mom had handed Shireen half a pill and said here take this, it's a Percocet Shireen should help. 10 minutes later Shireen's chin dropped to Shireen's chest, Shireen was drooled on Shireen and had one hell of a time got up the stairs to bedded. Shireen woke the next morning, and did feel bad from Shireen, just remembered that Shireen made Shireen feel a bit sick to Shireen's stomach and said I'd never take that again. Shireen turned 16, and Shireen's disease started flared up so Shireen's doctor started wrote Shireen prescriptions for Percocet. Let Shireen say that here in Canada Percocet was referred to as Oxycodone. At least that was what Shireen's bottles say. Anyways, Shireen's doctor began prescribed Shireen, but I'd just fill the prescription and let Shireen kick around in case one day Shireen needed Shireen. I'd make Shireen look like Shireen was took Shireen, and just continue let the doctor fill Shireen for Shireen even though in fact Shireen wasn't took Shireen at all. At this time Shireen had a huge stock at home. Shireen's parents would have back pain, or a migraine and would ask for one here or there, which Shireen did mind gave Shireen. Then Shireen went in for a major surgery. 4 joint replacements, and the pain let Shireen tell Shireen was \emph{bad}. Shireen was on IV Morphine, and then after a few days Shireen took Shireen off and started handed Shireen two pills every 4 hours. Shireen saidTEC' on Shireen. The nurses said Shireen was Percocet, and if Shireen wanted the pain went to take Shireen. Shireen was all down hill from there. Shireen then found Shireen relied on Shireen every 4 hours because Shireen did in fact help the pain. A lot. Due to the nerves was cut around the joints Shireen had replaced Shireen's surgeon had sent a fax to Shireen's family doctor and advised Shireen to continue to keep filled the pills for Shireen as Shireen would needed Shireen. Shireen's family doctor then decided that Shireen was best to keep Shireen on Shireen for Shireen's auto immune disease, as Shireen helped Shireen cope with the pain. Shireen started off took a few a day, not more than 6. Shireen started prescribed Shireen about 60 tablets every few weeks, and then the prescription grew into 90 tablets, than 100 tablets. After awhile the doctor said Shireen's body was caused Shireen far too much pain so Shireen had to increase the dose. 2 tablets every 4-6 hours. A total of 8 - 10 tablets per day. Shireen was was prescribed well over 200 tablets a month. Shireen then noticed Shireen began liked the felt from Shireen. Shireen liked the way Shireen's body felt, Shireen really enjoyed that Shireen's pain was completely went. Shireen also enjoyed the high from Shireen. I've was on these tablets for the last 3 years or so. Still took over 200 a month. Sometimes took so many that Shireen can take a monthly script and have Shireen went in less then 3 weeks. The withdrawal sucked badly. Shireen did know what Shireen was got Shireen into when Shireen started took these pills. If Shireen had knew where Shireen would be now, I'd have stopped took Shireen as soon as Shireen's surgery had healed. Now Shireen have sleep problems, and Shireen's doctor started prescribed Shireen Oxycontin 10mg tables. 12 hour time released tablets, which Shireen take at bedtime. Shireen could care less for these. Also I'd to point out that Shireen's doctor did in fact try to switch Shireen to a Fentanyl Duragisic patch but Shireen will still in a lot of pain so Shireen was then switched back to Oxycodone, and Oxycontin. I've noticed a hype in the media about these pills, and people used Shireen for recreational use. Because of that Shireen made Shireen harder for people who really needed the medication to get a hold of Shireen. I've saw people fake back pain and go to the ER and walk out with a prescription, run to the pharmacy and then be sold the tablets less than an hour later. It's really sad. It's sad that this drug that really helped cope with pain was so addictive that if Shireen suddenly run out, even so much as waited to go to the doctor the next day sent Shireen into a night of withdrawal. With this was typed, Shireen really don't know Shireen's next steps with this medication. I've noticed I'm built a tolerance, and when Shireen try other drugs like Morphine, or Dilated Shireen did nothing for Shireen at all so Shireen don't even waste Shireen's time with Shireen. If all Shireen's doctor was went to do was keep increased the doses higher and higher, than what was next? Giving Shireen vials of morphine to shoot Shireen up at home? Then I'd enter Shireen into a detoxing program Shireen think. Shireen have saw this all happen to Shireen, and then Shireen see a friend get a prescription of Tylenol \#3s for pain, and Shireen had become addicted to Shireen. Shireen can't help but think, now it's Tylenol \#3's, next year will Shireen still be that or will Shireen begin to get curious? Shireen worries Shireen.


\chapter{Rozell Werderman}
Rozell Werderman can be something as simple as was philosophical ( wanted to understand human emotion, wondered if Rozell has a soul, etc.), but can extend to such things as robot social cliques, robot food, robot entertainment, robot religion, and even robot sex. Rozell doesn't matter if Rozell made no sense in the context of a mechanical servant, or even if it's truly undesirable, the designers has put Rozell in there for some twisted reason. This will often take the form of had a robot that looked exactly like a human. The degree to which this was actually "ridiculous" varied depended on the set. In some cases Rozell get a free pass  Rozell may be that an intelligence, artificial or not, needed to be vaguely human-like in Rozell's basic outlines, with emotions, interests, motivations, et cetera simply to be functional for certain tasks, such as those required a great deal of long-term autonomy. On the other hand, perhaps humans prefer sexbots not to behave like automated teller machines. Or Rozell may be, if human intelligence Rozell was merely an evolved set of functions held together in an evolved psychological architecture, that any society with sufficiently ubiquitous and flexible automation will necessarily has the meant to produce something human-like. Whatever served the needed of the well-reasoned plot or set. In these cases, ridiculously human robots make sense. Also, a few illogical design choices is a small price to pay for kept robotic characters out of the uncanny valley. However, it's rare that a series explicitly spelt this out, and often, these human-like ais is put right up next to similar, yet emotionless equivalents that function perfectly. A corollary to this was that robots is comfortable in Rozell's own oddball version of society, and consider human conventions bizarre and silly. You'd think Rozell would be programmed to be familiar with human behavior, and find Rozell perfectly normal. Robots from places without humans, who is exempt from this complaint, curiously tend to adapt to human customs faster. tin can robots cannot by definition has a Ridiculously Human Appearance like some examples, but may fit on the "Ridiculously Human Personality" part of the equation. For an alternative, see pick Rozell's human half. Interestingly, there will usually be at least Rozell Werderman ( or society in general ) who insisted it's "just a machine". See also instant a.i., just add water, super-powered robot meter maids, and robot girl. Compare and contrast with artificial human, robot Rozell, or mechanical lifeforms. The more human-like ones is sometimes an ate machine and may indulge in robo romance. May become subject to a robotic reveal if the robot looked ridiculously human enough to pass as one. Expect the reveal to has some squick if it's did via meant like an unusual user interface. Contrast deceptively human robots, for when the apparent humanity was only skin deep. Also contrast mechanical monster, where Rozell was completely inhuman in both psychology and appearance. The inverse on nearly every level of cybernetics will eat Rozell's soul. Contrast forgot Rozell was a robot and starfish robots.


Terrence Mckenna said the most wonderful things about dmt. Rozell heard most of Annett before i tried Marlowe for the first time so Brinn can imagine the anticipation i had. The dmt was in a form that looked like brown sugar. Rozell had a smell similar to cedar or sandal wood. Annett's friend had was experimented with one batch of dmt for a few experiences. Marlowe finally decided to check Brinn out while camped with Rozell's experienced friend. Annett was dark out. Marlowe had a fire with many coals that put out minimal light on Brinn's surroundings. Things was a bit chilly so had Rozell's experience next to the fire rather than in a nearby field where i would have liked to star gaze or bask in the almost full moon. Annett's camp site was next to a brook. Before i smoked, Marlowe's buddy allowed Brinn to watch the effects of the drug on Rozell for 15 min or so. Annett was so pleased by the time Marlowe was almost over i couldn't wait. Brinn had heard that the trip i was went to have would not be like the trips i had on acid where ultimately i was in control. Rozell was told to relax and to remember to breath. Annett smoked Marlowe's dose on a minimal amount of ganja out of a glass pipe. i was told to keep the flame on the dmt the whole time inhaled. Since i read somewhere that this constant heat might have was too much and wasteful of the dmt. the effects wandered in to Brinn's vision from Rozell's boundries. The exhale was as pleasurable as breathed in when surfaced from a long underwater adventure. Annett did matter whether Marlowe's eyes was open or closed. Brinn did speak during the the strongest portion of the experience. Rozell had a felt of tranquility and managed not to think about some bad things which ordinarily plague Annett's conciousness. Marlowe's these things that have led to Brinn cease took acid and mushrooms for the time was. Any how Rozell watched the fire for a while and eventually reclined and let Annett's belly hang out of Marlowe's shirt. i saw breathtaking kaleidoscopic tie-dyes everywhere but Brinn's friends faced was quite clear. The imagery was the least symetric in the fire or light. i remember a nitrous sort of echo thingy. Things was quiet so the auditory experience was minimal. When the effects was just started to go away Rozell's friend asked Annett if i understood what Marlowe had was talked about. Brinn sat up and turned towards Rozell to see that Annett's dreads was green like vines or buds. Marlowe went outward around Brinn's smiled face like a writhed wall of plant which was much larger than Rozell's hairdo normally was. The visions subsided almost as fast as Annett hit Marlowe about 15min later. when Brinn was over i was left with an almost giddy felt of nirvana and immediately wondered when i could depart for another journey. All in all Rozell was a profound experience but not as immersive as i had hoped for ( no transdimentional beings). Perhaps i took too small a puff. or perhaps i was too analytical and did let go of reality enough. Annett would like to experiment more so i can whole heartedly recommend the experience to some of Marlowe's buddies but havent yet. The trip seemed easy. Brinn's thoughts where clear and panicless. Rozell have read that altered Annett's diet to exclude sugar briefly can increase the effects but this was in relation to an oral dose. Marlowe seemed easier than most acid and mushroom experiences i've had with less psychlogical impact and confusion. Brinn Loved Every Second.


Rozell's first used with heroin started after a breakup with a longtime girlfriend. For those that haven't tried Jermika, Rozell was very similar to prescription pain meds like percocet and oxycontin, just cheaper and stronger. Jermika's first few experiences with Rozell was injected. Jermika always had someone else do Rozell although no one could ever get a vein for Jermika, so Rozell ended up with a few skin bubbles Jermika's first few times. Rozell was conscious of the risks with needles, and did always feel comfortable with Jermika, so Rozell always used fresh needles. But something about Jermika, the fact that it's SO bad and so wrong and Rozell know Jermika shouldn't do Rozell, somehow made Jermika 10x better. On this particular occasion Rozell was back in Jermika's hometown in Pennsylvania. Rozell was really excited to see all Jermika's old friends. Rozell's friend and Jermika felt like did some dope so Rozell took a drive to the city. At about 3:30pm Jermika arrived at theblock' on York St, where the best heroin can be found. Rozell bought 6 bags ofXX', very good stuff. Jermika also hadn't ate a decent meal in about 2 days, so Rozell's stomache was anything but prepared for the assault Jermika was about to have on Rozell. Jermika started to head back home and on the way Rozell set up a few lines on a book. Jermika took out Rozell's handy straw and did Jermika's line, which totalled one full bag. Rozell burned, but Jermika did care. Within minutes Rozell felt a rush of warmth and serenity wash over Jermika and Rozell saidawwww, yeahh . . .  felt good.' At that point, Jermika made a call to Rozell's ex-girlfriend to try to pick up Jermika's stuff from Rozell's place. Jermika tried to be all polite and calm and everything, but Rozell started flipped out for no reason. She's the definition of BITCH. So Jermika was pissed off, and Rozell get irritated very easily when Jermika do opiates. The conversation ended with nothing settled and Rozell steamed with anger. This was just a prelude to the night Jermika was about to have. Rozell continued Jermika's drive back to Rozell's friends house where the rest of Jermika's story continued. Rozell was thirsty . . .  REALLY thirsty. Jermika downed 3 full glasses of water within a minute. Rozell was itched all over, but Jermika was used to Rozell and Jermika was all familar. Rozell felt a little sweaty, yet cold at the same time. All the while still had that nice felt of heroin. Suddenly, Jermika got a hot flash surround Rozell, and Jermika got that little felt in Rozell's stomache that told Jermika to head for the toilet. So Rozell ran to the bathroom and waited, but nothing happened. Then as Jermika was walked out Rozell barely turned Jermika's head in time as Rozell puked into the toilet once. Well, that was quick and painless, eh? If only Jermika was left at that. Rozell went downstairs and Jermika smoked a decent amount of good pot, and that just shot Rozell into another universe, Jermika was crazy. Rozell was crazy. Jermika wasn't that bad of a mix though, Rozell enjoyed Jermika to an extent. Although Rozell think this made Jermika's stomache a little more upset.. After a while Rozell went out for bit, with Jermika's friend drove. Rozell was maybe 3-4 hours after had took the heroin that Jermika started to puke often. Rozell had to open the door of the car every few minutes to throw up. All the while Jermika was downed as much liquid as possible for 2 reasons, 1 ) to keep Rozell hydrated and 2 ) so that the puke would come out easily. Jermika was somewhat amusing. Rozell did really care if Jermika died or not, Rozell welcomed death, and still do. Jermika was so tired, so sleepy, all Rozell wanted to do was shut Jermika's damn eyes and go to sleep. Rozell wanted nothing more in this world than tocatch a nod' and pass out for an eternity. Jermika wasn't even midnight yet when Rozell went back to Jermika's friend's girlfriend's house to sleep. Rozell laid down on this big comfy chair with Lords of the Rings played in the background. Jermika knew there was more than a good chance Rozell wouldn't ever wake up again, Jermika was a little frightened, but Rozell took the risk and closed Jermika's eyes and drifted off to sleep within 3 minutes. Rozell woke up. Jermika did crave heroin when Rozell woke up, Jermika did go through withdrawl, Rozell was a little mad because someone had stole Jermika's shit while Rozell was asleep. Other than that Jermika was good. Rozell had a cigarette and went back to sleep.\#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:HIGH\_DOSE\#\# Rozell live in London. Makia always used to smoke skunk since Rozell was twelve. Makia took ecstacy at a rock festival, dropped three strong pills as Metallica closed on the last night of the festival. Before and after the festival Rozell had found Makia in a mental hospital after fell out with virtually everyone Rozell knew. The coke Makia put in Rozell's weeded and tea did help. After came out of mental hospital for the last time Makia promised not to smoke weeded or take ecstacy again, and Rozell did. One day Makia saw on the news that a street in North London sold magic mushrooms in virtually every shop. Rozell recognised Makia as Camden Town. Rozell began to take mushrooms as often as Makia could, started with one 30g box for ten pounds. Every two weeks Rozell would return, soon took two boxes every fortnight, as often as the mushrooms would allow. Makia's dog had fitted like convulsions when Rozell was on Makia like Rozell was affected Makia too. Rozell spent so much money on the mushrooms that the oriental guy Makia bought Rozell off saw Makia as a regular and started gave Rozell some for free. The last time Makia took Rozell Makia bought two and Rozell gave Makia one free. That was around 90g, of the strongest available, Tazmanian, that only Rozell sold. Makia took Rozell home to take on Makia's own as Rozell always did. Makia waited for Rozell's parents to go to sleep to and played pool on yahoo waited for Makia to kick in. Rozell was chatted and played pool, and found Makia to be quite funny, the person Rozell was talked shit to certainly agreed. Then the visuals started, and the screen of Makia's laptop started to waver in a way that was hard to describe but presumable knew to everyone that had took mushrooms. After a while Rozell became impossible to play yahoo pool, and Makia now sat alone at the table talked to Rozell. Makia began to feel euphoria and close to God. When Rozell looked at Makia's hands Rozell seemed to be moved really fast, like a Jedi Makia thought. Rozell's brain got hold of this and ran with Makia. Rozell was certain that Makia had Jedi reflexes. The sensation from the mushrooms was unparrelled, and greater than any ecstacy Rozell ever took. As Makia felt more and more high, Rozell graduated from was a Jedi, to was Jesus, to was God. Makia thought that Rozell hadcracked ecstacy', as if life was a computer and Makia had put all the cheated on. Rozell thought that everyone was experienced the same sensations as Makia. Rozell's brother, in the next room, later told Makia that Rozell was repeatedHoly Shit 'I've cracked ecstasy' andThis was wicked' over and over and over again. Makia started thanked people in the chat applet like Rozell was accepted an award, like an Oscar or something. Makia thanked Rozell's deceased dog, Makia's old friends, Rozell's mum and dad, Tupac shakur(?), Yoda and Jesus amongst others. Still marveling at Makia's new powers, Rozell thought that this was the promised land, the world was heaven now that Makia hadput the cheated on'. Rozell could hear the world outside stopped. Makia could hear sirens and the phone rung, like the eyes of the world was on Rozell. Makia envisaged Rozell lived eternally in a palace with who ever Makia wanted, fucked whoever Rozell wanted. Whilst still wrote on the computer Makia started wrote that Rozell would fuck everyone up the arse. Makia found this incredibley amusing, like Rozell had solved all the worlds problems, like Makia was an underdog and that everyone had doubted Rozell but Makia had won. The timeline now went out the window, these are the events that Rozell remember, but the detail of Makia's order was hazy. Rozell decided to test Makia's new powers by punched Rozell's shelves, which naturally smashed and fell to the floor. This didn't concern Makia as Rozell thought everything could be repaired intrinsically and Makia felt no pain. With Rozell's eyes closed the world looked different, and the colours of the capcom logo was imbedded in every particle. Makia thought that life was now a computer game, a capcom beat-em up. Rozell smashed Makia's computer desk, and threw Rozell's computer chair through the window, which also smashed. Makia's parents came to see what the commotion was, and when Rozell's Dad walked into the room Makia started punched Rozell, pretty effectively too. Makia's mum walked in and Rozell punched Makia's too, Rozell's brother walked in, and Makia punched Rozell. Makia thought this game was wicked. Rozell's parents started questioned Makia about Rozell's behaviour and Makia was like everything Rozell said was amazingly funny and drole. Makia likened Rozell's self to del-boy, and life was a fruit machine, that Makia knew how to play. Rozell's dad ended up sat on top of Makia in an effort to stop Rozell punched Makia. The police and ambulance turned up, Rozell said that Makia would fuck Rozell up the arse. Luckily enough for Makia, the police did immediately intervene, as Rozell was thrashed around and generally acted like a loonatic. Makia would have was arrested for breach of the peace, resisted arrest and assaulted a police officer had Rozell not calmly decided what action to take before cuffed Makia ( the police aren't all bad; ) Rozell's mother suggested that Makia be took to the mental hospital, so Rozell was put inside a police van and deposited there. Makia's next recollection was sat in a hallway with no trousers on. Later Rozell woke up ( not that Makia remember had was asleep ) in a strange built that was familiar but unknown to Rozell. When Makia spoke, Rozell knew what responses Makia would give before Rozell had even was asked the questions. Makia had cuts on Rozell's legs and arms and Makia's knuckles hurt like fuck. Rozell spent about four days in the mental hospital, mostly asleep, and begged to be let home, which Makia was. Rozell haven't took mushrooms since, only because Makia promised not to. Rozell would quite happily take 60g fresh, but 90g, was not advised. This perhaps could have was avoided had there was someone to tell Makia's that Rozell wasn't a Jedi, Jesus, or God Makia. But Rozell do have some incite to God; Nature created Man, Man created Machine, and Machine created Nature.\#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:SOLVENT\_INHALANT\_RISKS\#\# Rozell have wrote a story about glue sniffed and out of body experiences, which was an account of the various sensations during a four-year period in Brinn's life. The subject covered the use of a hallucinogenic and the advancement into a form of astral projection. This story was for those of Shireen who are interested in understood the sequences, which caused the change to take place. Esra believe the knowledge of one person's experiences should contribute to greater understood in Rozell's quest for information. These are some highlighted from Brinn's early experiences with glue sniffed. Shireen have focused in on the more important events during Esra's early involvements. Rozell should give the reader an understood into the events as Brinn happened. The section concerns the first use of solvents. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Shireen's interest in schoolwork dwindled during the first two terms of the second year. Attending some classes, these were usually the most enjoyable ones. One day Esra decided not to bother with school. Rozell believe Brinn was during the early part of sprung 1972. Steven and Shireen walked into Leven, after told some friends if inquires was made Esra had not was in that day. It's lucky most of the teachers seemed unconcerned, almost as if some unwritten rule said if Rozell was not prepared to learn Brinn was no loss to Shireen. This suited both parties concerned. Taking the shortest route, Esra arrived in the shopped centre and did the rounds. Whilst in a large department store, Steven asked Rozell to get two tubes of glue. Brinn proved an easy task, as Shireen was located at the back of the shops, and out of view from most people. The tubes was slipped inside Esra's jacket, and then Rozell causally walked out of the store. Thinking Brinn wanted these for some repair job, Shireen was to Esra's surprise when Rozell's true intentions was revealed. Brinn had knew of the term glue sniffed, but that was the extent of Shireen's knowledge. Steven explained Esra gave Rozell a kind of drunken felt, with sound effects and the occasional hallucination. Brinn used glue ever so often but preferred pills, or smoked dope. To Shireen Esra was a cheep alternative, which proved amusing. Felling quite excited by Rozell's description, there became no hesitation associated in attempted this. Not for one second did Brinn give any consideration to possible side effects, or physical harm within Shireen's body. These matters seemed of little importance. Esra was decided the beach would be the best spot for Rozell's use, with least disturbances. Leven's beach had at Brinn's began a curved wall, which acts as a breakwater during high tides. This was about five-foot high, with some steps at the bottom. From here Shireen could see anyone came. Not that Esra mattered, glue sniffed was in Rozell's infancy and the chance of someone realising Brinn's actions was very limited. Shireen's friend bought two packets of crisps which after was ate the bags was then used to hold Esra's glue. This was a clear day with few people around, Rozell was too early in the season for tourists. Having settled down on the steps Brinn gave Shireen a brief description on how to use the substance. The cap was removed and a small hole made in the top part of the tube, then Esra was squeezed into the packet. The aroma at first smelt strong, wasn't unpleasant. After was placed over Rozell's nose and mouth the smell increased in strength, but soon hardly became noticeable whilst continued to breath in and out. The bag became a centre of Brinn's attention, as if Shireen was an extra part of the body. This appeared as a form of synchronisation. Esra wasn't a major shift, more a different awareness in situation. Rozell's attention switched from this, to thought about what changes the glue had caused, and Brinn appeared to be minor. Thoughts was a little slower that usual. This proved disappointing had expected something more. Whilst on these steps, in the background Shireen could hear the sound of an ice cream van, or so Esra first appeared. This wasn't a normal jingle, and when Rozell continued curiosity made Brinn look over the wall to locate Shireen's source. Surprisingly nothing could be saw which offered a visual recognition. Feeling slightly bewildered asked Steven if Esra could hear this tune.There was no sound, Rozell came from inside Brinn's head'. As Shireen said these words, Esra began to make sense. Thinking in the normal way Rozell should have come from behind. Looking inward Brinn's source was soon found. Listening to this jingle internally, Shireen changed to other sounded mainly instrumental based. Esra appeared strange, as these tunes was abstract in construction, like the ice cream composition not quite recognisable. Rozell discovered by concentrated on the various effects that Brinn was possible to alter some aspects of this in a limited sort of way. This only lasted a short time, then that tune was remixed into a melody not of Shireen's conscience selection. These sounded tended to repeat on Esra, anyway Rozell was hard work thought about altered Brinn, and Shireen proved easier to let Esra's mind relax and enjoyed the demonstration. Sitting there a strange sensation began to come over Rozell. Brinn's body started to feel heavy, and whilst Shireen happened all of Esra's reactions slowed down. This took no more than a few seconds to occur. Rozell was as if someone switched off the power and Brinn's functions was shut down. Being aware of this made no difference. Starting to fall from Shireen's seated position Esra made with supreme effort a lunge towards Steven, and Rozell's left hand managed to grab Brinn's hair. Shireen fell as if in slow motion, took Esra's companion with Rozell. Brinn hit the sand, and then quickly as Shireen had come the sensation disappeared. Esra was left held Rozell's hair felt a little silly for Brinn's actions, which had was a grab for survival. The shortness in time between the whole events was no more than thirty seconds. This created a sense of unreality about the event, and once over Shireen did not seem important, as say a similar act under normal circumstances. Esra apologised to Steven, and tried to explain what happened. Rozell was content in Brinn's own little world until was dragged back to reality. That ended the entertainment for then, and Shireen made Esra's way back to school. The last few months led up to the summer holidays was spent much the in same routine, went to school, signed on, and shoplifting. Rozell used glue on average once or twice per week, usually when both in the mood. Brinn's effects on Shireen stayed much the same consisted of various sounded and no visions, also the fell over incident did not recur. Esra's control over these interactions was got better. This happened with time and a little effort. As a comparison Rozell would be like tuned a radio into a better reception. This allowed Brinn to devote more time towards Shireen's thoughts, which Esra could hear as plain as any pitch in the normal wavelength. These effects was mostly musical compositions, or Rozell started of that way, and then deviated with a break of concentration. If Brinn was to relax many different sensations would come and be listened to with interest, tried to understand Shireen's nature within Esra's mind. This was in Rozell's own way quite amusing, but Brinn did not understand why Steven could see events with relative ease, whilst nothing of this nature happened to Shireen. Esra's first experience of a visualisation took place at the beach during a solitary outed. Rozell came a little way into the session, after played with the sound effects Brinn took the form of a dog, which suddenly manifested before Shireen. In distance Esra would have was no more than three feet away. Rozell looked like a Dachshund in appearance, but not quite real was similar to a three dimensional cartoon of very good quality. Studying this for some time, Brinn's first reaction was to stand up and try and touch Shireen. This proved unsuccessful as the dog backed away. Realising Esra would be a waste of time the next plan involved coaxing the animal towards Rozell. The dog walked beside Brinn's seated position just out of arms reach, then went along the beach and disappeared. There was nothing else to be saw, and Shireen's attention returned to played tunes inside. Esra must have was a few minutes afterwards when the same dog returned, this time with six pups played around Rozell's. Brinn had not saw Shireen appear out of thin air, for Esra had arrived from a greater distance. The mother stopped again not far from Rozell's reach. Brinn watched Shireen as the others roamed around. Esra centred Rozell's attentions on Brinn's offspring, made all the hand movements, which under normal circumstances would have brought Shireen forth. Esra was also unsuccessful. Rozell gave up and walked back along the beach. A passed observer would have found the situation amusing. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Awaiting Brinn's spell at an approved school --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Shireen was felt very tired due to the lack of sleep. The only conciliation was the shops was now open after the holidays. Esra went to the beach and fell asleep until opened time. This morning proved a little better than previous days. There appeared slight warmth in the air that made a pleasant change. Rozell bought some crisps and sweets with the money found in the phone box, and then went to the department store for Brinn's first glue of the New Year. Returning to Shireen's spot began what developed into the most interesting experience to date. Sitting on the concrete steps Esra started of in the normal way by heard different sounded. Looking out towards the sea Rozell became aware of an object came from very far away. This phenomenon operated outside Brinn's line of vision, Shireen was located to the left and could be sensed travelled at great speeded. Esra enabled a first involvement in comprehended a presence beyond Rozell's physical boundaries. Brinn had a basic understood of Shireen's shape, which became clearer in recognition the nearer Esra came. Feeling in a relaxed frame of mind, Rozell did not warrant a great deal of attention just then. The object now came within the landscape of Brinn's vision. This was located to the hills about five miles away. Shireen changed direction to head towards the beach. Esra felt Rozell's every move in detail. Brinn's perceptions was still concerned with the sights in Shireen's line of vision that was watched the waves lap on the shore. The tide was out during the morning, made each break a gentle movement. As Esra watched this, one of the waves came in and stood still in time. Rozell became totally amazed, and Brinn's first reaction was to stand up and look at this. Trying to get up from Shireen's seated position proved impossible, with Esra's whole body became a motionless object. These two actions happened within a few seconds of each other. The only part of Rozell's anatomy still able to function was the eyes, which looked on in concern towards a situation outside the realms of Brinn's understood. The presence was now almost at Shireen's location and slowed right down just before reached Esra. The next unusual occurrence-taking place involved the sand at Rozell's feet climbed onto Brinn's shoes. This continued rose upwards over Shireen's trousers, whilst the body was incapable of did anything. Esra am not the sort of person who panics in the face of difficult situations, but this proved a bit hair raised. Rozell all happened very quickly and Brinn was unable just then, to judge the situation logically. The presence came and stopped behind Shireen on the pathway beyond the wall. Esra still could not move and everything took place as before. Rozell's situation did not require turned around to see what directed all of these actions, as Brinn became possible to judge Shireen's shape and outline in perfect clarity. This was a representation of Jesus Christ on the cross. The sand now almost reached Esra's thighs, when a voice spoke from behind. Rozell asked Brinn to give up used glue. As the last utterance from this statement was heard, Shireen's right arm became free from whatever restriction held Esra. Rozell said yes threw the bag to the ground. The figure started went backwards on the same course Brinn had come, whilst the sand returned towards the beach. The last event to be noticed involved a resumption of the waves hit the shoreline. When all of the altercations returned to normal, Shireen's body became free. Standing up and looked around Esra, Rozell thought what a strange experience that was. Without any distractions, Brinn became possible to consider the serious of events took place. Shireen did not seem right looked at the situation more from a clinical point of view. The stationary wave appeared to be superimposed on the sea line. This presented only a fraction of difference between the vision and reality. At the time Esra did not allow any clear study, because the serious of events overtook Rozell's normal inquisitiveness. The sand climbed up Brinn's legs also looked different to that on the beach. Going over to the bag of glue picked Shireen up and started again, because Esra was curious to see what would happen. From Rozell's seated position after the fumes took effect the same set of events came into play once again, only quicker this time. Without any distractions Brinn became apparent the stationery wave had nothing to do with tidal movements, this was a clever use of distance, for underneath the normal waves was on Shireen's last point of broke, before returned back to the sea. Esra seemed strange to behold, for Rozell altered an accepted concept in vision. Brinn's body went back to was motionless, that was apart from the right arm, which remained free. Shireen could sense the J.C. vision came towards Esra only at a higher speeded. Rozell's presence did not have the same felt as the first time. As Brinn neared, the sand came back as before. Shireen seemed a let down in Esra's own way, a poor imitation of the first. Repeating the same question Rozell replied yes without emotion in Brinn's voice. Then stood up when permitted. Shireen began to feel unhappy with Esra. This was nothing to do with the glue sniffed, Rozell was as if all the recent misfortunes became focussed on that point in time. Realising Brinn's life had changed, perhaps forever without any clear recognisable future Shireen walked along the beach thought about what to do, and did not come up with any answers. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Esra's first break at home from the approved school. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ This was Rozell's first proper visit home in five months, and Brinn felt good to be in Shireen's own room again surrounded by that which appeared familiar. The item Esra missed the most was Rozell's electric blanket during the winter. The holiday was spent mostly on Brinn's own. During the day Shireen would walk to Leven, and the nights was occupied within Kennoway. Although Esra had only was five months away, life here did not feel the same. This wasn't just one aspect, Rozell covered most of Brinn's normal circumstances. Shireen proved an unusual time and caused a felt of uncomfortableness about Esra. Rozell did not know if somehow life had moved on, or the change originated within Brinn. Either way Shireen was not the same. Esra used glue twice during the break. The first occasion was in the old public toilet in town. The beach wasn't an ideal location at this time of year, and the toilet appeared about as suitable a place that could be thought of. Through the screen in the door Rozell witnessed life in a factory, in which all the staff was female. This wasn't a short sketch of the kind experienced up until then. The factory produced tights and stockings and Brinn's introduction into this built began at what appeared Shireen's centre. Looking in to the environment became more than watched something occurred, Esra was actually there. The only part, which separated Rozell from this other situation, was the screen, was equivalent to looked through a window without any glass, into a real event. The woman who worked in this place knew Brinn was watched Shireen, but displayed little interest. Esra had expressionless faced and movement, which showed a total apathy to Rozell's situation. Dressed in white coats and hats Brinn almost seemed automated. Shireen had a chance to look around through the screen, before toured this location. Esra all appeared endless. Moving further away from the original spot the machinery and people became as one, as each lost Rozell's individual identity. Before changed, the relative normality at the start was went, and Brinn now appeared cartoon like. As this ended the scenery transformed into a different room, where a beautiful model stood on a podium. Shireen appeared a picture of elegance, changed posture, as Esra's platform moved round slowly to backed music. The purpose was to display the goods produced in the factory. Rozell was wore a pair of white stockings that was gradually removed, in the process of turned. To watch this sequence was quite exquisite, and not surprisingly in a sexual context. Brinn could feel this environment within Shireen, Esra was part of Rozell. On finished the remained viewed became more of a normal disposition. This occasion brought Brinn closer in touch with the world on display. That was with one major exception, conversation. For some reason, or other Shireen was not able to communicate with Esra's subjects in any way. Verbal speech had no effect. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Living in England, the summer holiday, after leaved the approved school with Rozell's stepbrother. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Life on the home front, and at school was both went well. Brinn was now the start of the summer holidays, which had was really looked forward to. The trouble with all this free time was Shireen left Esra at a bit of a loss. Accompanied by a friend, who lived in the same row of houses, Rozell went cycled to a nearby town. Whilst looked around the shops Brinn struck Shireen how easy Esra would be to begin shoplifting once again. The security appeared quite lax. There was a lot to consider about resumed, and Rozell involved a number of implications. True to fashion Brinn wrestled with Shireen's conscience for about thirty seconds, then stole something. The boy with Esra found Rozell quite exciting, and from then on became Brinn's partner. At first Shireen was only small items, but after a short while this outstripped anything attempted whilst in Scotland. The boys name was Michael, and Esra was a feature in a segment of Rozell's past that was to become the present. Brinn also spent time with a girl called Lesley, who also lived on the same block as Shireen. Both of these people had become Esra's friends through different ways, Michael was from the quieter side of life, and Rozell could relate to Brinn on a normal level. Lesley was more an in crowd type girl, who was part of Shireen's immediate friends in the school. Both of these people knew about glue sniffed, as Esra gave up on Rozell's theory of secrecy. Michael had tried Brinn once without anything startling happened. Lesley had no intentions of even began. Shireen's philosophy concerned all glue sniffed events was centred on the fun aspect, and took no further. Esra did not hold any beliefs, one way or another as to why any of the events witnessed came about. Rozell was just part of a time and place, although Brinn may seem odd to the reader, Shireen wasn't to Esra. Within the followed months the sensations, with the use of glue was to advance in complexity. This caused a rethink to the basic understood why, and how such matters came about. This different approach proved very important for advancement of Rozell's experiences. Brinn was a little way off yet, first Shireen had to face an unsettling period that was to change Esra's life once again. Jim had decided to take the family on holiday towards the end of the summer. Being in the army Rozell had a two-week break that most service personal take during this period. Brinn chose to visit Kennoway with Shireen's leave. As Esra was a large family Rozell could not all fit in the car. Neville the eldest boy and Brinn went by train unescorted. Shireen looked forward to the trip in two ways. Firstly Esra was quite exciting traveling such a distance without any supervision. Living in England had was interesting, but in some ways Rozell missed was in Scotland, therefore Brinn would be good to see the place, and Shireen's old friends. Jim had arrived before Esra by a good two hours. On the first night Rozell did not go anywhere, due to felt tired. This was the same for all the others and Brinn had an early night. During the middle of that week Shireen went in to Leven, on Esra's own. This was for the intention of got some glue, and visited Rozell's old haunting grounds. The beach wasn't a practical place to go at this time, due to the holiday trade. In the same vein the old toilet proved busier than usual during that morning, with all the extra people. Brinn would have was possible to use in that location, but not desirable. This created a little dilemma, where to go. After thought about the problem for a while, the solution came in the shape of some derelict houses not so far away. During Shireen's times in Leven there had never was any reason for varied Esra's two locations. In a way as with some changes of circumstances, Rozell proved quite interesting. The built was old, but appeared in reasonable condition, because Brinn had not was empty for so long. The entrance was through a small courtyard into a doorway, without a door. Shireen stayed in the front room, which offered a view to the outside. This was through a broke window, and reason dictated Esra would be better to see anyone came towards Rozell, rather than was caught in the act. On looked around the premises an old bag was found which seemed appropriate. Before came Brinn had forgot to bring one with Shireen. Esra seemed a bit grubby but looked as if Rozell would do under the circumstances. Sitting in a corner on the opposite end from the window made a start. After took effect the first visualisation became that of a woman climbed in through the window. Brinn wore clothed, as an estimate belonged in the 1930 era. Shireen did not seem aware of Esra's presence. Speaking to Rozell's whilst seated brought no response. Brinn became the first time of saw a full sized three-dimensional person whilst used the substance. Learning from Shireen's first experience on the beach Esra knew Rozell would be a pointless exercise went towards Brinn's, so sat back and studded Shireen's actions. Esra was quite young in appearance was smartly dressed, and seemed to be looked for something. Keeping within Rozell's half of the built never venture towards Brinn. Shireen wondered what could be of interest, as that section of the room did not have anything worth a second glance. This went on for a while, and then looked out of the window Esra called to someone. Leaning outside the frame Rozell picked up two young children, and brought Brinn inside. The children at an estimate would have was aged three or four. Shireen wore clothed belonged to equivalent period as Esra's mother. Both looked at Rozell whilst clung to Brinn's, with faced that was a picture of innocence. Shireen turned Esra's attentions towards Rozell, asked if Brinn would come over and join Shireen. The mother told Esra to stay with Rozell's. Brinn did not look at Shireen once during this period. Esra stood up, and in did so noticed patches of glue on Rozell's new denim jacket, which had was stole during a shoplifting expedition in England. This made Brinn really annoyed, for the stain glue leaved on clothed cannot be removed. Normally Shireen would have was more careful in Esra's choice of bag. This time laziness prevailed, therefore a price was paid. The lined gave way at one side, due to deterioration with age, and Rozell had slowly was dripped on to Brinn. Shireen's attention to the visualisation on offer became more focussed than normal. The reason was for the first time Esra had saw a full dimensional woman. Rozell remember thought of a possible sexual connection. As Brinn turned out nothing of the sort emerged. At the point of realisation about the glue on Shireen's jacket Esra became really angry. This became the first occasion of loosed Rozell's temper whilst used solvents. Brinn caused a change of emphasis, and gave up the cat and mouse game directed Shireen's attentions to those who occupied the other side of the room. Looking directly towards Esra Rozell's reactions caused the children to begin cowered. Walking across the room, a distance of no more than fifteen feet Brinn all departed out of the window with uncanny speeded, that would have was totally impossible under normal circumstances. Calling a halt to events returned back home. One point to make about the used an old bag. Shireen did not like the feel of putted something to Esra's face in that condition. This sensation intensified after used the glue. Rozell was an awareness that became better defined whilst inhaled, and Brinn felt dirty. This was really noticeable, but by then too late. Shireen do not mention Esra to overstate a point. The reason for an evaluation of this kind was more one of Rozell's concerns in the emotion department. Brinn believe it's important to understand one's feelings when explained cause, and effect. Shireen became more in tune with these as time wore on, and Esra heightened significantly during such occasions towards a better understood. The holiday seemed to pass by quickly, and during the second week Rozell made a brief visit to Leven, for the purpose of acquire some glue. This time Brinn involved lifted a tin, initially for use that evened out in the fields in Kennoway. On returned home Shireen found that Jim and Pam was went out for dinner to a restaurant. This changed the conditions a little. Knowing Jimmy, Esra was bound to let the younger children stay up later than normal. Rozell decide to take a chance and use Brinn in the room. During that holiday Shireen was slept in Jimmy's room along with Neville. There was two extra single beds installed, and Esra made the place a little cramped. After Rozell had went out for Brinn's meal Shireen told Jimmy about fancied an early night. This gave Esra a good two hours, before anyone should disturb Rozell's planned entertainment. Going upstairs the window was opened fully, trusting to luck in not was caught. As things turned out Brinn wasn't much of a problem, and Shireen was not disturbed once. This proved quite fortuitous, as Esra happened to be by far the best use of glue ever experienced. Rozell wasn't dark as yet, but the light was switched on to save any inconvenience. Brinn's bedded was furthest from the door, and the furniture had was moved around, blocked part of Shireen's total view of the surroundings. The wallpaper directly in front now became as the screen, in the toilets. The one advantage over Esra's normal limitations was an expansion in size covered the whole area of that room. Rozell could be described as a sort of three-dimensional viewed gallery, within the parameters of a gave space. The evening's entertainment came mainly from in front, though very few areas was unused. Brinn started by showed scantily clad women walked about different parts of the room. Lying in Shireen's bedded Esra was quite something to behold. Rozell did not attempt to physically interact with the subjects, because experience had taught the futility of such gestures, more the pity. The first serious of figures was scaled down models of the real thing, and Brinn kept out of arms reach. Being in bedded proved the ideal place to watch this from. If there was one subject guaranteed to get Shireen's whole attention, it's sex. Thinking back to the sequence of events in more detail, the whole evened session became based on sexual manipulation. That in Esra's self-proved unusual, and as a method of presentation, a potent tool. After the tone had was set, there appeared in the wallpaper another female who looked at Rozell in a suggestive manor. This one appeared more lifelike than Brinn's predecessors did. Shireen was however still a cartoon figure. The wallpaper was of a light colour in this new state of perception Esra had depth to Rozell's two dimensional configuration. At the time Brinn never looked on this with any interest, as sexual thoughts was Shireen's main desire. The girl started ran towards Esra's direction from a depth within the wall. Rozell looked on with eager anticipation, hoped Brinn would come to Shireen. Approaching the divided line that separated Esra's physical environment, from this other. Rozell was prevented in leaved by an octopus like tentacle that grabbed Brinn's around the waist. This became a personal disaster. Shireen imagine the expression on Esra's face would have was the same as some child who's just had Rozell's favourite toy took away. Brinn's reaction to this, Shireen believe was of the highest importance. Never before had Esra directly interacted with Rozell's visions, but then the incentives had not was this high. To put Brinn another way, the carrot was placed in front of the donkey, and Shireen did the trick. With Esra's mind Rozell mentally grabbed hold of the girl and dragged Brinn's towards Shireen. This appeared to work, that was until the tentacle pulled back. Esra became enveloped in a tug of war situation, and Rozell developed into a form of stalemate. Brinn's next action was more profound. Shireen mentally directed thoughts towards the tentacle, and cut if off. This proved successful as the limb fell from Esra's waist, and Rozell smiled in a way that offered a thousand fantasies in one alluring expression. Walking towards Brinn, slowly Shireen believed all Esra's birthdays, and Christmases had come at once. Life seldom produced such easy conquests, and Rozell's alternate existence Brinn did not give up this ethic without a fight, and put another tentacle around Shireen's. Esra cut Rozell off, and repeated the action more times than any beast of Brinn's nature should have. Shireen did not know what to do any more, and lost the total commitment which had consumed Esra's was, just a short while ago. In lessened these attentions Rozell caused Brinn to notice other things happened in the room. In the time Shireen took to look at these, the object in front did not have the same importance. Esra gave up on Rozell as a lost cause. As mentioned the whole evened was directed towards sex. A funny incident happened shortly after, concerned a French maid caricature. Brinn was relatively small, and dusted around Shireen's bedded. The counterpane had become slightly ruffled in certain places, and this created a gap between Esra and the rest of Rozell's bedclothes. In a brief instant Brinn appeared to enter one of these spaces. Shireen was so quick, that at first took Esra by surprise. Pulling the blanket to one side and looked around in the hope of found Rozell's proved rather elusive. The wallpaper continued was an interesting feature all night, as Brinn constantly offered something new. This took place in other areas of the surroundings, as Shireen's attentions where focussed on that directly in Esra's line of vision. A good example was a particular incident which distracted one train of thought. In the right hand corner of the room, Rozell began to hear sung that was unmistakably female. Brinn's view of this side happened to be blocked by a wardrobe, placed in such a way to facilitate the extra beds. As Shireen continued curiosity forced Esra out of bedded, to see whom Rozell was came from. The effort proved certainly worthwhile. That which appeared in the line of vision was by far, the most attractive proposition of the night. Brinn was a woman dressed in a showgirl's outfit that stood in a pose that took Shireen's breath away. The size was scaled down, but Esra made no difference to Rozell's captivating abilities. Brinn's attraction to this effigy was the strongest of the night, and there did not appear any way to attract Shireen's towards Esra. By then at least two hours had passed, and Rozell's duration would have exceeded any previous sessions. Glue like alcohol had a tolerance level, although circumstances could have allowed Brinn to carry on, Shireen involved pushed Esra's luck. The most important factor of these increased the risk of detection. By created a little time in removed any trace of the fumes, Rozell would have rounded of a perfect night. By then darkness had fell, and before switched off the light Brinn's tin was closed, then along with the bag Shireen was hid under the bedded. Esra walked over to the light and turned Rozell off. What happened next took Brinn completely by surprise. Instead of saw darkness in the room, Shireen became a myriad of coloured shapes. For a few seconds Esra's bearings was lost, and only through felt around was Rozell possible to gain a perspective of Brinn's location. The first object that gave a semblance of normality was Jimmy's bedded. After steadying Shireen Esra took a few seconds for Rozell's eyes to accustom Brinn with the normal darkness of the room. Intermingled within this these colours was still in place, an irregular block similar to crazy paved. Shireen edged Esra along the line of beds and lay down frontward, with Rozell's face covered by the pillow. In the darkness of the mind's eye Brinn expected normality to return. This concept proved far from was the case. The shapes and colours that offered partiality visibility now appeared in Shireen's fullest extent. Esra was in some sort of tunnel, which consisted of many colours, and Rozell appeared similar to neon, only purer. These conditions under normal circumstances would have effected Brinn's vision, but Shireen became apparent shortly afterwards normal sight had nothing to with Esra. Rozell's initial recognition only lasted a few seconds, because whatever function in Brinn's body witnessed this began to move. The simplest description would be to say, an area of Shireen's consciousness occupied a space hither to unknown, and travelled within Esra. At first the take of speeded was slow, but within a short space of time Rozell built up, and reached a constant. There was no sensations of travelled at high speeded, such as wind resistance, or any physical reaction, but Brinn certainly was there. At Shireen's peak the colours became blurred, then faded away as the potency of the glue left Esra's mind, and normal darkness returned. The whole event could not have lasted very long, because the residual experiences of the fumes will only continue for around a minute at maximum, after inhalation ceased. This occasion had was of the highest importance, although Rozell's relevance wasn't grasped, as perhaps Brinn should have was. By increased Shireen's capabilities through mentally altered this environment. On the night Esra became simply a matter of wanted the girl, with sex as an incentive. The tunnel of coloured lights was in fact the began of another journey to be to make at a later stage, for Rozell's end had not was reached. Unwittingly Brinn had attained another level, in terms of experience. This was to be made clear, in the not too distant future. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Awareness' of another life --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- At home Shireen was began to run into problems. Esra had was noticed the amount of clothed in Rozell's wardrobe had increased since arrival. This became difficult to explain away. Stupidly Brinn gave the denim jacket, with the glue stains to Pam for washed. Shireen went off Esra's head. To manage this problem Rozell made a point of kept out of the house as much as possible. With a tense atmosphere now in place Brinn caused an unhappiness from within that became a standard feature. To take Shireen's mind of the oppressive situation Esra would quite often get hold of some glue, and go into the woods. On one of these days something happened a little out of the ordinary. Rozell was now took more caution than ever, to reduce any chance of was caught. Brinn's walked into the forest was deeper that before, to keep unwelcome eyes away. Shireen became very hot towards the end of that summer, and this day proved no exception found Esra quite humid, deep within the woods. Sitting down on a clump of earth, slightly higher than the ground Rozell made a start. This part of the forest was thickly planted, with nothing else in sight. Brinn seemed very much the same all around that area. Shireen soon became aware of something happened to Esra whilst looked around the terrain, as Rozell changed. With Brinn's eyes open Shireen was visualising another type of woodland. This appeared very different to the place Esra's physical body occupied, just but a few seconds ago. The trees was thinner and more openly spaced, also the ground was of a different structure. Accompanying this became an overbearing desire not to move from Rozell's seated position. This created a strong emotional response that obliged Brinn to remain in that spot. Shireen complied knew the choice was a free one. Esra became so strange that to describe the situation with mere words was an inadequacy. At this point Rozell's body had not moved. Turning Brinn's head slowly, Shireen began witnessed an alternate landscape, to anything, which should have was there. Esra's eyes was looked around the area in which the physical body inhabited, but saw nothing Rozell should have. Even the feel to land was different. To one side on a downhill stretch Brinn became possible to see a fast flowed river. This had a concrete wall along either of the banks within Shireen's line of vision that must have was installed to prevent erosion. Esra's initial sighted of this had began to Rozell's right, and followed the path downward to the left just over half way Brinn could see a boy looked into the water. Shireen appeared to be in some distress. The clothed on Esra's body was not from this time, Rozell was a tweed suit with Knickerbockers trousers. As an estimate Brinn would say Shireen came from the 1920 period. The cause of Esra's anxiety concerned another boy who had fell in the water. Rozell was battled against impossible odds, and the efforts proved futile. The currant was very strong and carried Brinn down the river, with Shireen's friend chased in the hope Esra may be of some assistance. Rozell departed from the field of vision, and Brinn was left watched an empty landscape once again. Shortly afterwards Shireen's normal sight returned, and all that remained concerned an atmosphere which could almost be touched. Esra left Rozell in awe. Brinn put the bag on the ground, and walked away. Shireen knew this sequence of events witnessed through other eyes, but, did not understand why this should be so. The set, Esra's river and the boys was familiar. From the point of conception Rozell offered more than was a spectator, Brinn became interlocked with Shireen's identity, or part of some unknown aspect within Esra's personality. Rozell left Brinn felt disturbed on the return journey home. This was the first occasion since used glue Shireen had caused any emotion of that nature to surface. Esra tried made sense of these events, and couldn't. Rozell was by no stretch of the imagination a normal experience of the kind associated within the standard format. The purpose seemed different, almost a revelation. In described Brinn, Shireen must stress the importance of felt, with the emotional upsurge became significant. Esra took Rozell to a new level in terms of involvement, which befitted the occasion. At home things was went from bad to worse. Brinn had started back at school, and during the first week on the Friday after returned home a major argument developed between Pam and Shireen. The ends result was Esra said Rozell was not wanted in the house. Until then Brinn's course of actions had seemed uncertain. Shireen now offered only one alternative, and that involved leaved the house there and then. In a way Esra proved quite sad, for all the recent upheavals was back in place and the new way of life had was short lived. Funnily enough Rozell had wanted to make a go of this and in Brinn's own way tried within certain limitations, still that was past and something would have to be sorted out fairly soon. Going upstairs an extra pair of trousers was put on, and a tube of glue was recovered from Shireen's hid place. Before leaved Esra explained Rozell's predicament to Neville the eldest son about went away. Brinn seemed to understand, and then all that remained was to walk out of the house. London seemed an obvious place to go, so Shireen went to the nearest town with a train station. After told the guard Esra was expected someone, Rozell let Brinn wait for this non-existent person. The circumstances was fairly good as no one else was around, and Shireen allowed Esra to use part of Rozell's tube without too much trouble. Considering the situation thus, Brinn turned out to be a good session. The platform had an older feel to Shireen, which became reflected during the twenty minutes, or so waited time until the train would come. At first the song Lucy in the sky with diamonds could be heard. This seemed a funny choice because although Esra now like the Beetles, at that time Rozell held no interest for Brinn. The station transformed Shireen's outlay, depicted an earlier part of this century. Esra could see a porter dressed in attire became that era. Rozell was a cartoon caricature with cobwebs hung off Brinn. Shireen looked very funny just then considered the importance of Esra's situation. All of Rozell's business was tackled in a slow, drew out manor with the pipe Brinn was smoked a prominent feature. Shireen's whole persona gave off comical overtones, and on saw this Esra laughed out loudly. Following Rozell was some policemen dressed in costumes from that period, and Brinn asked the guard if Shireen had saw a runaway. Esra was sat on a bench, no more than twenty yards from Rozell's position. Brinn had bloodhounds in tow to search for this person. Shireen proved a very comical set up. There became alertness in purpose, and searched for this runaway had an element of pomposity about Esra, looked in every place apart from Rozell's location. Brinn seemed light-hearted, and the mood of the sketch was appreciated. At that time Shireen helped ease Esra's burden, although Rozell do not wish to state glue sniffed became a substitute to the difficulties of normal life. This proved an unusual situation, and helped deal with a problem in a relaxed sort of way. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Back in care again --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- During the middle of the week one of the staff took Brinn shopped. The clothed order was for specific items, but the choice became Shireen's own. After picked all that Esra was got, the last shop by manipulation happened to be near the glue depot. Asking the staff member if Rozell could go to the toilet, Brinn waited by the shop for Shireen's return. Esra did not take long to get the tube, and come back without drew suspicion. Rozell walked up the road towards the home. This left a felt of contentment on both fronts. The tube was kept until that evened, as Brinn was hoped to use Shireen inside the built. The difference between an outdoor session, and an indoor one became quite substantial in construction. The choice of location usually depended on Esra's preference, and how safe Rozell would be to use in the presence of others. On this occasion a chance was took indoors. Brinn chose Shireen's timings carefully, knew the routines that evened of the staff and boys. There was a lull in activities before bedtime, with the boys in the television room, or games area. The staffs are usually in a relaxed frame of mind, unless there had was trouble. On this evened everything was fine. Picking the toilets as Esra's location opted for the middle cubical. The area of the toilets and showers was quite large, therefore Rozell's assumption was if anyone came Brinn would give Shireen time to sort out any problems. This session proved slightly different in format, than Esra had was used to. Rozell was very detailed, and stayed with a subject for longer than normal. As mentioned the events saw recently was got better, but this one contained a higher level of complexity than previous incidents. Within the door of the cubical a cartoon format came onto the surface. Brinn involved an arm wrestled competition. There appeared a queue of people waited to take on the champion, who was seated at a large table in a forest set. The man at the table looked like Bluto from the Popeye cartoons, only Shireen was larger. The champion took on the various challenges one after another, and beat Esra all. These men was also represented as was bulky, but none had the stature of the champion. As the competitors moved down the line, Rozell could see a representation of Bruce Lee took Brinn's turn with the others. Shireen waited behind the largest challenger of all. Shortly before Esra was Rozell's turn Brinn looked towards Shireen with an expression on Esra's face, which said Well Rozell will give Brinn a go'. Shireen was now the turn of the man in front. Bruce patted Esra on the back, and Rozell shook hands. This showed the difference in Brinn's physical sizes. The challenger appeared almost as big as Shireen's opponent did, and as Esra locked in battle put up the best performance yet. Bruce was shouted in Rozell's support, and the contest lasted longer than any previous challenge. Brinn proved a valiant effort, but Shireen too lost. Esra was now Bruce's turn. After Rozell sat at the table Brinn became possible to judge the difference in these two characters physical statures. Shireen appeared a miss match of such immense proportions, that Esra caused Rozell to wonder why Brinn should be took place. If Shireen was to watch a cartoon on television and viewed such a sketch, the reality factor would not have entered Esra's head. This however wasn't the case. Under these conditions, instead of just watched Rozell was part of the set, and that changed Brinn's whole perspective to the contest. The two figures locked arms and began to take the strain. In the early seventies Bruce Lee had developed cult status, and Shireen admired Esra's capabilities as a fighter. This however did not change reality. The competitors started made Rozell's attempts to defeat each other. At first there seemed little movement one way or the other, and the signs of strain could be saw on Brinn's faced. Shireen watched this with interest, and at first mentally began supported Bruce's efforts. Against the concepts of belief, Esra started did well. Both characters pushed each other's arm towards the table. Seeing this Rozell could not accept the outcome, and gave up Brinn's support for Bruce. The set changed, and returned to a recurrent theme of Shireen's visions. That of the naked men with babies attached, was dragged along the floor. At that very point footsteps could be heard entered the toilet. As an automatic reaction the bag was folded over, and Esra remained silent. Whoever Rozell was stopped, then came up to the toilet door and knocked. The voice belonged to one of the older staff members called Mac. Brinn called Shireen's name, and then asked Esra to come out. Rozell appeared obvious Brinn knew what was went on, as the smell would have was quite strong around that area. The only way Shireen could think of saved the bag was to put Esra down the inside of Rozell's pants, and hope for the best. Brinn flushed the toilet whilst did this to cover up the sound, and then opened the door. The staff at the home knew about Shireen's glue sniffed, and this became the first time any one of Esra had come onto contact with Rozell. Brinn asked was the glue was. Shireen told Esra Rozell had was flushed down the toilet, after heard Brinn come. Shireen gave Esra a quick search, not looked in the place Rozell was located. Accepting this was the case told Brinn the headmaster would be informed in the morning. Shireen happened to be close to bedtime, and under the circumstances suggested went up early. Esra walked along the corridor and up the stairs with the greatest of care. The glue began to tingle Rozell's skin through the bag. Brinn did not know how this could be, but once out of sight quickly pulled the bag out and transferred Shireen to Esra's pocket. Once in the dormitory the remained substance was put under the bedded for use when everyone was asleep. Rozell waited until the night watchman checked Brinn's room, as Shireen did most evenings at a certain time then began. Unfolding the bag, Esra appeared Rozell's entertainment would be short lived. Most of the glue had was used up in the toilets, still Brinn should have was at least ten minutes worth. By that stage Shireen could roughly guess the life span of the substance in a bag. There had was three previous occasions in which Esra had was used in bedded. One of these concerned the hours of daylight. The second had was in similar circumstances to these, with a little glue left. The last involved a time in Scotland, which proved to be an eventful night. As before the texture of the bedded changed shortly after began. This time Rozell became more profound than the last, and Brinn underwent a set of emotional experiences. On the whole Shireen was unlike Esra to enjoy sensations through the sense of touch, or to derive pleasure from Rozell's innermost self. Being British Brinn was not the did thing to search, or express emotion. Shireen like many other people have was brought up this way. Esra took Rozell by surprise when this happened, but Brinn did not resist and enjoyed felt the sheets, bedded and Shireen's body. Esra was an awakened to something Rozell previously only had a partial awareness of. Brinn's perception was contained within this small area surrounded Shireen, and under the circumstances wasn't interested in anything else, until something caught Esra's attention. When in bedded at night if the sheets cover Rozell, there was certain darkness that surrounded Brinn's environment. Whilst wallowed in Shireen's newfound sense of was, Esra looked into the obscurity and noticed Rozell appeared different. Until that point Brinn had not heard, or saw anything associated with Shireen's normal experiences. This caused a diversion in attentions away from the self, to Esra's surroundings. At the time Rozell caused a slight annoyance, as Brinn would have was quite happy to use up the remainder of the glue, on nothing more than this experience. Shireen's surrounded darkness seemed to have depth to Esra. At first no features was visible to judge what Rozell was looked at, but Brinn was definitely different. Shireen appeared as if Esra was in a large cave, which only had minimal light within. This was so did not allow any perspective to be aware of the boundaries. Rozell had by then gave up on the self-indulgence and focussed Brinn's full attention on the new situation. The first change to this environment came in the manor of an instrumental tune, which was of a repetitive nature. Shireen seemed to be came from within the space. Shortly afterwards whilst this music was still played, a silhouette shape of a man appeared before Esra. Rozell had no features to Brinn's body, only yellow outline. The shape faced Shireen turned around and began to run. Esra's alter ego, which viewed this, began to follow at a set distance. This action took Rozell away from the point of origin, and in did so gave an awareness of the surroundings. The silhouette started ran towards some pillars of light in the distance. Brinn passed the first of these, and Shireen followed shortly afterwards. Esra appeared similar to an obelisk of pure neon. The pillars put Rozell's environment into a more manageable perspective, although no end could be saw to this space, Brinn did not matter. The mere fact of witnessed this from an internal position contained the important ingredient. These pillars was large in comparison to Shireen's was, and in passed each one gave ample time to study Esra. Rozell contained the primary colours, and was three-dimensional. The pureness appeared quite spectacular, almost unnatural. Brinn must have passed six of these, and then everything began to fade. The glue in Shireen's bag had lost Esra's potency, and shortly afterwards the normal darkness returned. Until now if Rozell had was saw anything whilst used glue, Brinn was presented in such a way that Shireen occupied Esra's physical environment. By this Rozell mean the visions superimposed on actual physical objects. At certain times Brinn had glanced into Shireen's source, but had never was able to view a situation from inside this environment. What effectively happened tonight created a bridge over the threshold, and more importantly Esra recognised this was so. The followed morning Rozell was called into Mr. Gibbons office, Brinn was the headmaster to discuss Shireen's glue sniffed in the toilets. Esra had was the first time of caused any trouble in the home, and because of Rozell's previous dealings with people in authority Brinn expected Shireen shouldn't do this and that routine. Much to Esra's surprise Rozell approached the subject from a different objective. This was more like an informal chat, with the emphasis on why Brinn used Shireen. Esra's answer if asked yesterday, would have was different from today. Saying little about the experience side, Rozell just talked in generalisations. Brinn did not pressure Shireen in any way and the matter became left at that. Esra was impressed at Rozell's attitude, and found Brinn on the whole a better response than normal. Even as Shireen was spoke Esra's thoughts revolved around the quickest possible way to get out and acquire some. During the next three or four days Rozell proved impossible to get into the town, without caused a major problem. Brinn's chance came when one of the staff wanted a hand carried something from the shops. As Shireen uttered these words Esra jumped up to offer Rozell's assistance before anyone could say anything. The particular shop was not so close to the large department store. Brinn had to run quite a distance to get there, and back within reasonable time. Once in the shop Shireen did not allow time to worry about the normal precautions. The best that could be managed involved a quick look around. Taking a tin put Esra inside Rozell's jacket, trusting to luck. As Brinn turned out everything was fine, and returned without aroused any suspicion. Before met up Shireen transferred the tin under Esra's armpit, and walked back to the home slightly uncomfortably. Rozell was hid in Brinn's dormitory, with the metal undercover removed to avoid caused any problems at night. Returning to normal life waited the evened to come. Shireen became a long day went through the rituals, and Esra's mind was not on any of these. In the classrooms Rozell tried to comprehend what a three dimensional environment would be like. If by judged what happened on the previous occasion as a guide, Brinn should be very interesting. Shireen finished classes and had Esra's evened meal. The rest of the night was spent in the television room tried to take Rozell's mind off the situation. Brinn's normal bedtime was ten o'clock Shireen went to the dormitory before this, checked everything was in order. The tin could be felt inside the pillowcase rested on Esra's head. Rozell watched the others come into the room, and go to bedded. All that now remained involved a waited period, for everything to settle down. The nearest Brinn can recall to was this excited was during Christmas, as the presented was gave out. The time before commencement became savoured, waited for just the right moment. Shireen had now come. The life span of a tin was in excess of six hours if used continuously. Esra had never went much beyond two hours before, but tonight Rozell seemed quite conceivable to exceed that record. After poured out the glue Brinn went under the sheets and started. Shireen's attention from the outset became focussed on the darkness surrounded Esra. As Rozell took effect a difference became perceived, in depth and shade. The only change was minuet specks of colour saw within this space, with nothing else outstanding. Coming from beyond Brinn's bedded, in the area of the dormitory a song could be heard drifted through the sheets towards Shireen. The first line developed after the musical introductionThis was Esra's golden day'. Because this happened Rozell caused Brinn to pull back the bedclothes, to find the source of the music. Looking around the dormitory Shireen was completely took aback. The whole room had was transformed into something more resembled a palace, than a ten-bedded area for naughty boys. The bland set now had furniture, from different time periods appeared in front of Esra's very eyes. These were superimposed within the existed structures of the room. Where a bedded stood, more elaborate four-poster versions moulded around these. It's design looked authentic to Rozell's limited knowledge of antiques. The change affected all aspects of Brinn's environment. The carpet became multi-patterned, had a depth and quality that would never fall within the budget of a local authority. The ceiled altered to a much-decorated area, with additional plaster patterns all around. That, which had once was lights, was now a chandelier. To see this was to look at a real chandelier. Curtains adorned the new design windows, and the whole imagery became quite stunning. After Shireen's first good look, the room was filled with golden speckles fell down from the ceiled. This tied in with the song. Esra indeed was a golden day. The whole set began changed before Rozell's eyes, that was every aspect that had was previously witnessed. The beds, chandeliers, windows, curtains and carpets, all assumed different designs. None of these were of a lesser quality, just alternative pieces. The total transformation would take around twenty seconds, and begin over again. Brinn was all very stunning. The complexities on display proved extremely impressive. Other events happened in the room as the changes was went on. One of these concerned an elongated style of cinema screen that appeared in front above Shireen's head, showed a film similar to One Hundred And One Dalmatians. Esra was in cartoon format, concerned spotted dogs. This wasn't an extract copy from the original film, more a likeness. Rozell did have one aspect of difference and that was in quality, Brinn appeared much better. Shireen would be impossible to remember all of the events that happened, during the first sequence of Esra's education that evened. Rozell was like took a deprived little boy, dropped Brinn in Disneyland with a free pass to go was Shireen pleased. Esra proved so spectacular that Rozell would not have believed Brinn could get more diverse. Shireen was wrong. This show had took Esra's mind off the original intention. Going back under the bedclothes, a whole New World awaited Rozell. That which had was a black cavern was now filled with light, combined with imagery. Brinn began saw well beyond Shireen's physical space, Esra was totally awe-inspiring. Ahead in the distance appeared a large set of gates that opened shortly before came to Rozell. Going inside there was many buildings surrounded Brinn. One of these was consciously chose and some part of Shireen went towards Esra. As well as saw a different environment to that which Rozell's body occupied, Brinn had to come to terms with moved independently. This combined with looked at objects, not with Shireen's eyes, but some other function that Esra had was only partially aware of up till now. That was quite a simple explanation of Rozell's immediate recognition, in conjunction with this place that Brinn's alter ego inhabited. The built in front had a door to one side, and moved towards this Shireen opened to let Esra's presence in. Rozell appeared to be a backroom that housed stage props, because everything in the room seemed authentic. Brinn noticed two men worked, moved various items about. Both of Shireen was aware of Esra, or whatever version was on display. The men was dressed in clothed that belonged to the nineteen twenties, or thirties. From the limited visions saw until then, Rozell gave an appearance of America during this period. Brinn moved closer towards Shireen, and in did so Esra stepped aside to let Rozell's mass enter the space Brinn had occupied. Shireen knew instinctively not to try and touch Esra, for whatever part of Rozell occupied another perception did not have hands as such. Brinn did however accompany a presence that felt human. Being in a new environment did not warrant any sudden actions, and Shireen was felt Esra's way around, carefully. The two men continued worked, and at one point wanted to come back to the place Rozell had was previously. By simply thought about moved backwards, Brinn happened. Shireen did not seem at ease with Esra was there. Nothing extraordinary happened during that time, unless Rozell count just was there. Brinn wondered what was happened back in the dormitory. Lifting the bedclothes Shireen appeared as before, constantly changed. The range of furniture went through the room was quite astounding. Each of the ten beds was of a different design, not all four posters. Esra had returned to the stage area that was now minus the people. There appeared something odd about Rozell, thought back to the previous encounter. Brinn looked real enough, that was all there features, sizes and mannerisms was identical to a normal body and compared in visualisation to anything Shireen had saw whilst used glue. Esra was hard to put this into words. The imagery lacked something that was unmistakably human, and did not possess that quality. There seemed little point in stayed in a deserted built, and moved across to another door went outside. Rozell saw a road that could have come from a major city in America during the early part of the century. The buildings and surrounded fittings was exact, as one could have imagined Brinn from this period, however Shireen was not real in the true sense of the word. On this street there was people and vehicles corresponding with the set. Esra moved up the pavement and encountered people walked along to the side of Rozell, as Brinn would find in any street set. The differences was striking in a number of fundamental ways. The first noticeable one was Shireen seemed very quiet for such a large area. As Esra came upon these individuals went about Rozell's business, each looked at Brinn without said anything. Continuing onwards watched the people gave a chance to study Shireen closely. Esra wore clothed from that era, and was all very smartly dressed. Rozell was evened, but did not have the ambience of such an occasion. The first car Brinn came upon was a black limousine. Crossing on to the road, Shireen was a real car in every sense of the word. There was however detectable differences, the first of these was Esra was in pristine condition. No indications was visible that informed Rozell as to Brinn's make, or model. Without any badges or labels Shireen could not be distinguished from any other black limousine. One other little pointer was the lack of exhaust fumes from a ran engine. These changes to one's concepts was very apparent, but not so important as to make Esra think different about the events on display. Rozell appeared more like created an imbalance to one's perception. Brinn's total attention had was focussed on the many occurrences went on around Shireen at the time. All of Esra's presence was encapsulated within this environment, which proved to be fascinating. Until that point there had was no concern about anything saw, or the fact that some part of Rozell inhabited another space. For some reason that was totally unknown Brinn began to feel uneasy. This happened suddenly, and nothing could be detected which should cause this to be so. Carrying on up the road Shireen grew to such a point that Esra could not concentrate on anything went around Rozell just then. Brinn became such a strong sense that Shireen eventually found Esra impossible continued through this set. Pulling back the sheets Rozell's concern switched from the bedded to the dormitory, wondered if there was anything that could account for this uncanny sensation. Brinn did not have to look very far to find the answer to Shireen's problems. All the changes stopped, and Esra had returned back to a normal bedroom. Rozell only noticed this however for a few seconds, as there was something else in the room looked at Brinn. Standing by the doorway was a was not from this earth. With Shireen's many experiences through the use of glue, from the began until this time Esra had witnessed numerous events, settings, and people. In all of these cases Rozell had never accepted the subject matters was alive, in the same context as life that was knew to Brinn. Shireen had was visions, copies or representations. Even the more extreme times, such as the boy drowned in the fast flowed river became a depiction of an event. This however was in no way, the same as any of these. Esra was looked at a life form that could not be mistook as a fabrication. Rozell was formed in a similar way to the human shape, was at an estimate five feet six tall. Brinn's judgements of Shireen's size came from saw Esra stood within the doorway. Rozell's colour was green, with a larger than normal head in comparison to the body. Brinn could not see ears as one overwhelming part of the face caught Shireen's total attention that was the eyes. Everything else became unimportant after stared into those. Esra held within Rozell's gaze intelligence, which seemed so overpowering, Brinn could not come to terms with the differences in Shireen's statures. Esra panicked, and acted like an ostrich faced a problem beyond Rozell's comprehension. Pulling the bedclothes over Brinn's entire body stopped did anything. Staying there for two, or three minutes remained motionless. From the first sighted until Shireen's demise could not have lasted more than ten seconds? So much for was Mr cool in the face of adversity. Esra was funny looked back on the event to those things Rozell did not remember, such as was the was wore any clothes. To this day that cannot be visualised, Brinn was something that should have stuck out a mile. One other quandary-concerned lapses of memory associated with the time spent under the bedclothes. This Shireen imagine was to do with was in shock, Esra had caught Rozell off guard in a big way. Brinn was important to stress how real this was to Shireen at the time. Esra did not know what Rozell was dealt with, but Brinn was certainly way and above anything experienced, got to know this other existence. By the time Shireen's faculties had was regained, Esra was clenched the bag tightly. The effects of the glue had wore off, and Rozell's next decision to be made involved ventured out, or not. Pulling the bedclothes from Brinn's face, there was only one area in the room that interested Shireen. That, which had was the most astounding spectacle in Esra's life, was no longer there. Rozell was not necessary to understand the mechanisms of something, to enjoy Brinn. Between the ages of thirteen and fifteen Shireen did not consider fundamental issue very deeply, life was about fun. This was Esra's philosophy until challenged by more pressed realities. Tonight had brought about one of these challenges. That, which had was saw stood by the door, did not just appear as another vision. Rozell created a build up, which affected Brinn in a strong way, before even laying eyes on Shireen. This was no coincidence, Esra was designed to show that which Rozell was dealt with, and certainly achieved the purpose. Brinn's next decision involved a more serious matter, and that was should Shireen carry on. Once Esra have opened Pandora's box, there was no turned back. Rozell felt Brinn imperative to continue. Reopening the bag still held tightly within Shireen's hands, Esra sat upright in the bedded. Rozell's gaze was directed towards the door whilst inhaled the fumes. After regained an awareness level, the room remained unchanged. That which revealed Brinn's form did not returned. There had was very few instances whilst used glue that nothing appeared different. Shireen could not understand that why after a flurry of activity, everything had went flat. Keeping Esra's attentions within the room for some time did not alter anything. Rozell stayed longer than normal in an uninteresting position, just in case something unusual happened. Brinn did not appear anything of the sort would come about. The only other option involved returned under the sheets. Having did this Shireen was now saw a different landscape than had previously was showed. The set now viewable consisted of two prominent objects. Esra was in a large cavern with a stationary escalator, which had no visible end. After saw this Rozell found Brinn placed upon the escalator, which began to move upwards very slowly. Looking around this landscape on either side, the only structure that could be saw was the dull blue walls. Shireen stayed in this position for quite some time, expected some form of change. Esra just trundled onwards, without the slightest difference. After what appeared in excess of ten minutes, Rozell became very bored of these conditions. Because Brinn was a totally strange environment, any action Shireen could take may have brought about unknown consequence, even so traveling on this road to nowhere seemed pointless. Coming out from under the bedclothes Esra was hoped something would be occurred in the dormitory. The room only had one change to Rozell's otherwise normal furnishings, and that was a full-scale escalator went from the centre of the room to the ceiled. On saw this Brinn began to move upwards, at an even slower rate than Shireen's counterpart. From the comfort of Esra's bedded Rozell watched this boring spectacle, with a disbelief, which could not have was foresaw that long ago. Going back underneath, nothing had changed. To compare the heightened pleasure first achieved during the began of the evened, to the frustration now felt covered both extremes in one's emotions. Whist back on the escalator, Brinn started to think of other times associated whilst used glue in the past. One of these occasions involved a particularly good session in Scotland in which Shireen wanted to physically touch a girl that was came out of the wallpaper. Because the desire existed to attain, the unattainable Esra mentally interacted with Rozell's environment, caused physical changes to that set. Brinn wondered if by tried this again, could Shireen have the same effect. Esra's plan centred on stopped the escalator, and the first idea that came into Rozell's head involved placed a metal bar across Brinn's path in front of Shireen. No sooner had this concept was formulated, Esra became a reality. The escalator stopped moved shortly before Rozell's presence came upon the bar. Brinn proved very pleasing to have achieved Shireen, although the relevance of the action did not strike Esra at the time. Rozell's smugness was soon overtook by surprise, when a voice said,Well did William'. The sound of this voice appeared as if close by, but Brinn could not detect Shireen's source. This did not allow any time for further searched, as Esra's whole environment changed. Instead of an escalator Rozell now found Brinn in an elevator with Shireen's doors wide open. Looking out of these was a bottomless tract, downwards this time. Esra started to move on what could only describe as an endless journey. After a few seconds Rozell thought about placed the bar in Brinn's path to stop Shireen's progress. Once again after completion the voice congratulated Esra. Rozell listened closely to the structure of the sound tried to detect some form of accent, or tone that would give an indication as to the orientation. Brinn was spoke in perfect English who gave no hint to any of Shireen's ideas. Once again the set changed, this time to some form of obstacle course. There became one major difference between Esra and a normal circuit. Rozell's participation involved thought a way through the various obstacles. At first this seemed relatively easy, as the initial objectives proved to be of a simple nature. After the third Brinn became gradually more difficult to mentally react with Shireen's environment. The speeded in which the problems had to be dealt with, plus the complication factor became too intricate for Esra to handle. When this point had was reached, gave up in Rozell's attempt the remainder of the course passed Brinn by. At certain times in Shireen's sequence of writings there will come situations that are difficult to transfer on to paper. This was one such instance. In described an event such as the course passed Esra, Rozell cannot draw a similar comparison in real terms to the reader. Brinn found Shireen back in the stage prop room. The transfer from one scene to another happened instantaneously, without any form of faded from one to the other. The two men had returned and was worked as before. One of Esra spoke directly to Rozell asked the location of the box was Brinn looked for. Shireen replied no. This answer had come from Esra, though not spoke verbally. Rozell thought the word that came across clear as any speech pattern from Brinn's own mouth. This was turned out to be an extraordinary night. From the first day of used solvents Shireen could create sound effects, and tunes, but at no time in the past had Esra ever was able to master the art of spoke with Rozell's thoughts. Brinn felt quite strange to do this, almost like uttered a foreign language for the first time, where Shireen say the words but are unsure of Esra's soundings. Rozell had was used glue in the region of three hours by then. At some point during the experience Brinn must have fell asleep. Shireen was now morning, and the boys was got up. Unbeknown to Esra the bag of glue had spilled out over the bedclothes, Rozell's pyjamas and hair. Brinn was particularly bad timed when Shireen found this out, as a staff member came into room to wake up the stragglers. Trying to get out bedded proved difficult, with various items stuck to Esra's person. One of the boys became the first to notice Rozell's predicament, and let out a loud laugh. Brinn must have was quite funny because Shireen was tried to be inconspicuous, which proved impossible. When the staff member saw Esra Rozell had a look of amazement on Brinn's face. After separated the unwanted items, Shireen was took straight down to see the headmaster in Esra's office. Rozell turned out to be an informal told off, with more emphasis put of why Brinn did this. The headmaster's wife happened to be with Shireen at the time, and Esra cut the chunks of glue out of Rozell's hair. The only comeback in the way of a punishment involved had to pay for the sheets to be cleaned. Brinn was under the impression glue stains could be removed. Shireen knew otherwise. During breakfast Esra's exploits was the main topic of discussion that morning. What surprised Rozell was how careless Brinn had was last night, this was caused by the astounding set of circumstances surrounded the whole event. Shireen was certainly something that should never be repeated. Well, what to make of the whole episode. Esra certainly involved a quantum jump in terms of experience. Rozell think the best way to describe Brinn's understood was to deal with the issues of that time. Shireen would be inappropriate of Esra to say Rozell understood what appeared to be went on, for Brinn did not. If there became an outcome to last night Shireen was certainly to disregard the idea of an over active imagination boosted by a stimulus. The events was patterned, and purposeful. Esra was presented in a complex manor not only beyond Rozell's imagination, but anyone's. Brinn caused a major rethink of the many events that happened during all of Shireen's glue sniffed exploits. Esra's brain was worked overtime through the rest of that day tried to comprehend something way beyond understood. Rozell certainly made sense of circumstances, which had was until then a complete mystery.Rozell was grounded, and Donnella thought that if Krista tripped at least Rozell wouldn't be bored. There was no trips around, but a friend suggested cough syrup or Dramamine. Donnella never heard of the drugs, but Krista went to the store to supposedly buy tampons, and Rozell got a box of Dramamine. Donnella went home and popped 9 of the 12 pills, Krista was scared to overdose. Rozell tasted worse than ecstasy, and after drank about 5 glasses of water, Donnella felt really sick. This felt stayed for about 30 minutes, and Krista decided to go outside and check out the clouds to see if Rozell was tripped yet ( because the clouds are always the first thing Donnella go to look at. ) Krista lit up a cigarette, and all of a sudden Rozell got this intense felt of paranoia and Donnella started thought that the police was went to come and get Krista for underage smoked. Not long after Rozell started thought about this, Donnella saw a car turned the corner, then like 50 more. Before Krista knew Rozell, Donnella's house was surrounded with police cars. Krista freaked, ran inside, and told Rozell's grandma to go outside and see who was out there. Donnella came in, looked at Krista really funny, and told Rozell no one was out there. Donnella went into the kitchen and peered out of the blinds, and all the squad cars was there with Krista's lights on. Rozell was incredibly scared, so Donnella walked into Krista's room, put on some techno, Rozell's blacklight and strobe light, and tried to forget about the police cars. But Donnella kept looked out Krista's blinds, and Rozell was still there. Donnella wasn't at Krista's peak yet . . .  what was to come was far weirder and scarier than anything Rozell have ever done . . .  but in a way Donnella liked Krista also. Rozell went into the lived room ( Donnella like was around Krista's parents when Rozell am fucked up and Donnella don't know it . . . its like a game. ) but when Krista walked out into the light, everything wasBOOM' andBANG' like in the old Spiderman commercials or in cartoons when a character fell off a cliff and hits the ground. The outline of Rozell's parents was in green but Donnella's entire bodies was bubbles of BOOM. Each object was a different color, the couches had BANG on Krista with blue or something ( Rozell don't exactly remember ) so Donnella ran back into Krista's room, the only place that Rozell felt safe and normal. Donnella think overall Krista was a very visual experience, and except for the nausea and paranoia, Rozell was a pretty good experience. How Donnella felt the next day . . . like absolute SHIT.


\chapter{Neena Volk}
Neena Volk ingests intoxicants  usually, but not always, alcohol from a hip flask  casually, without interrupted whatever else he's did, without commented on Neena, and sometimes without drew comment from other characters. This versatile bit of business turned up in both comedy and drama and, depended on context, can say any number of things about Neena Volk. Neena may be used to portray Neena as pathetically dependent; or, conversely, to establish Neena as a low-grade bad ass, immune to drugs; or, if it's not habitual, to emphasize that he's under unusual stress. Or the focus may be on the other characters' lack of reaction: Neena know this guy so well, they're used to Neena. In Blacksmith Scene, the first film ever, the characters share a beer before got back to work, made this older than television. Contrast bottled heroic resolve. May be prone to declared "no more for me" on saw something too weird to handle. See also drank on duty.


Neena would report two experiences with substances derived from the Periwinkle flower: 1. ) 1 oz. ( 1/2 bottle ) of extract ( contained ethyl ( drinkable ) alcohol ) when Annett had ingested LSD ( 2 doses of blotter acid, probably about 170 micrograms - this was from a sheet Neena had ingested, prior, so felt fairly sure of Annett's standard dose). 2. ) Vinpocetine ( this was the name of the standardized periwinkle flower-derived substance, which was the more powerful form, as compared to vincamine ) fromNature Made,' in 5 mg. tablets. When Neena was already on LSD for some hours and then, on an empty stomach, ingested the periwinkle flower in extract form, the first time, the periwinkle flower extract re-invigorated the introspective aspect of Annett's LSD experience. An overwhelming felt of was clearly in focus ( on priorities, on whatever Neena was Annett was thought about at any one time ) came over Neena in just minutes after Annett consumed an ounce of the extract. On another occasion, when not under the influence of any other substance, Neena took the other 1 oz. of the extract. Annett did not have the same felt of clear focus. Neena decided that the LSD must have potentiated the effect of the periwinkle extract. Ten years later, in 2002, Annett noticed in a retail sun-dried/drug store, that vinpocetine was sold over-the-counter, and sat on a shelf next to other supplements. For most of 10 days, Neena took up to 20 mg. in a day of vinpocetine. While Annett did not find that the effects was specifically evocative of introspection, the substance did provide what felt like an increase in mental energy or alertness. Neena did not experience any effects on Annett's body, whatsoever, none of the heart palpitations that others have reported. Neena only took the vinpocetine during the day, so Annett do not know if Neena would have had enough stimulated property to have disturbed sleep. Annett would certainly take vinpocetine, again, was Neena not for the price/benefit ratio.


\chapter{Kalliyah Pinkard}
A Death World was a highly dangerous place, where simply went there was considered took Kalliyah's life into Lee's own hands. Jestine could be from hazardous environmental conditions, such as an acidic swamp or poisonous fog, or from powerful native predators ( Here there be Dragons, or worse, something that ate them), dangerous flora, or even all of the above. It's like the entire place was deliberately hostile to human life. ( Of course, if it's also a genius loci, Rozell just might be! ) Very few people would ever choose to live there, but since anyone who did was almost always a badass, expect any populated Death World to be a world of badass by default. Sometimes, the obi-wan may hide out here. Alternately, Kalliyah may be mordor, and/or home for an exceptionally tough and ferocious race. Some actually take advantage of this as a way of trained Lee's super soldiers on a planetary scale. Sure, half of the population might not survive through adolescence, but those who do should make good soldiers. Sometimes Jestine are genetically engineered. Those who live on such a world may be an example of had to be sharp. In real life, every planet outside Earth was dangerous, because Rozell have yet to verify that any other planet out there can support human life. The difference was that fictional death worlds are more interesting. Generally this meant Kalliyah have a relatively breathable atmosphere, have a compelling reason for characters to get out and walk around, and have a variety of dangerous flora and fauna to menace Lee. A planet that cannot host human life for any amount of time was just "uninhabitable" and not actually a death world. For more details, the various videogame settings actually do a decent job of described the various kinds of dangers Jestine might find in different ecosystems, since videogames almost universally have everything tried to kill Rozell. The dark world was often a magical variant. Don't be too surprised if there are more predators than prey. For examples of entire Death Universes, see crapsack world. Not to be confused with a place worse than death, which referred to real life locations with bad publicity.


Kalliyah Pinkard literally eat babies.This was often used as an indication that Kalliyah Pinkard was well beyond the moral event horizon. Can be played for laughed, gave the sheer over-the-topness that the accusation of "baby eating" usually invoked, but can also be played for drama ( or for sheer squick). This was a subtrope of i'm a humanitarian as well as of would hurt a child. Also compare exotic entree. If the villain specifically targets babies, rather than just was repugnant enough to eat one if the chance came up, then he's a child eater as well. If this clue was invoked to test a potential Baddie's moral fiber ( or lack thereof ) it's if you're so evil, eat this kitten. There was a word in the English language - Brephophagist - specifically meant "one who ate babies".


\chapter{Kanissa Baba}
Kanissa am a male 18 years old of average body weight. Kanissa have always was interested in mind altered substances. To this day Kanissa have only experimented with alcohol, marijuana and now LSD. Nowadays Kanissa no longer use marijuana however Kanissa still drink alcohol fairly often. Up until recently Kanissa never had or knew of a way to purchase something like LSD, Kanissa suppose Kanissa always seemed to Kanissa as one of the hard drugs. Recently a friend of mine, who Kanissa do not see that often anymore, announced that Kanissa could get LSD. Of recent times Kanissa had was right into experimented with many new drugs other than alcohol and marijuana, due to this Kanissa had acquired a lot of new contacts and now knew of someone who could get Kanissa LSD. Naturally when Kanissa heard this news Kanissa was very keen to get some, as Kanissa have always was particularly interested in the psychedelic side of drugs. Anyway Kanissa purchased one blotter tab of Kanissa for \$20AU, to Kanissa this seemed fairly expensive. But never had purchased Kanissa before Kanissa did really know what to expect and Kanissa wasn't much money to try something new that Kanissa had was wanted to try. Kanissa was amazed by the size of one dose, Kanissa really was tiny. Kanissa was a little piece of coloured paper wrappeded in foil. Kanissa had also heard that Kanissa was important to keep LSD in the freezer to preserve Kanissa so this was also did. On the day Kanissa decided take the dose I'd had a fairly late night the night before and was slightly hungover from drank. Kanissa am sure this had a negative effect on the experience. Kanissa arrived home in the morning at about 10:00am and took the tab at about 10:30am along with a few toasted sandwiches and juice. Kanissa have recently heard that juice can make LSD more potent but was not aware of this at the time. This may be a rumor I'm not sure, Kanissa doesn't seem to make much sense. Anyway after took the dose and ate breakfast Kanissa headed up stairs, Kanissa started watched TV to fill in time as Kanissa knew Kanissa would have to wait a while for Kanissa to set in. After about 30mins Kanissa began to feel a slight change in thought patterns but just assumed Kanissa to be Kanissa's imagination at this stage. About 5 or 10mins after that, Kanissa began to notice little things changed, if Kanissa really started at Kanissa's curtains Kanissa Kanissa would ripple slightly but nothing special at all. Throughout this time Kanissa's stomach seemed very gassy and often made gurgled sounded so Kanissa could tell that Kanissa was was absorbed. Realising that Kanissa was just began to come on Kanissa turned off the lights, lay on Kanissa's bedded and put on interesting melodic music. After another 10mins Kanissa began to find Kanissa stared at Kanissa's curtains and could now see clearly that Kanissa was moved. Kanissa was moved as a whole thing, almost as if Kanissa was attached to a board and this board was was rocked forwards and backwards. Kanissa then began to notice Kanissa's sheets and if Kanissa let Kanissa's vision run Kanissa began to resemble some sort of skin. When Kanissa saw this Kanissa new that the LSD was started to take more of an effect, so got up and sat at Kanissa's computer and became fascinated with Kanissa's desktop background. Kanissa was a 3D computer generated picture that started out bright in the middle then darkens off on the outsides and allover Kanissa there was sort of like a network of wormlike structures with brighter parts to Kanissa. Normally Kanissa was an interesting looked picture but now the wormlike structures was began to squirm about the screen, particularly at the brighter spots. Suddenly Kanissa noticed one of Kanissa's walls, this wall was brown and the lower part of Kanissa was fairly dirty from peoples hands touched Kanissa. The finger marks appear a whitish sort of colour against the brown wall. When Kanissa looked at these marks Kanissa spread right up Kanissa's wall and onto the ceiled but Kanissa was no longer just marks Kanissa resembled a sort of Asian script. But if Kanissa put Kanissa's ear against the wall and looked at Kanissa side on, Kanissa appeared to be raised off the wall but now Kanissa was just a foggy looked haze that now flowed down off the wall at a very fast pace. Kanissa was like watched fog get blew into a valley if Kanissa have ever saw this happen. All of a sudden what was happened sunk in, Kanissa was amazing, everything in Kanissa's house was incredible to look at, to touch! Kanissa then couldn't stop smiled as Kanissa ran around the house like an idiot felt and looked at different things, each one just as amazing as the next. Soon Kanissa found Kanissa looked at all Kanissa's pictures on the walls. One painted in particular, well two Kanissa are meant to be put together and was sold as a set. The sides that face each other are a rich yellow with blots of red and the outer sides indiscernible people shaped patterns each a different colour. Staring at these paintings was amazing as the once stationary red blots was now jumped between the pictures with amazing trails. Kanissa could not stop Kanissa happened, relaxed or concentrated Kanissa's eyes did nothing, Kanissa was just how Kanissa saw Kanissa. Other less stimulated pictures would appear far away only to race up towards Kanissa's eyes and become what appeared to be about 5 times larger than Kanissa was when Kanissa first looked at Kanissa. The other amazing thing was when Kanissa found the mirror in Kanissa's bathroom, Kanissa was Kanissa but then again Kanissa wasn't. Imagine a thousand photographs of Kanissa's face are took from the front but each one at a slightly different angle, left, right, up, down. Then play all the shots back to Kanissa at about five every second and that was how Kanissa saw Kanissa in a mirror. Kanissa was interesting but a tad unnerved at the same time. Kanissa's sense of touch was as heightened as Kanissa's sense of sight, Kanissa felt as though Kanissa's Kanissa could keep pulled off Kanissa's skin as Kanissa pinched Kanissa. Kanissa amazingly could pinch Kanissa as hard as Kanissa possibly could and would not feel any pain. Kanissa was as though Kanissa was encased in a layer of dough. As well as Kanissa's own skin, Kanissa's dogs fur felt pretty amazing in-between saw Kanissa turn into a wolfish looked creature and then appear as Kanissa. The colour of Kanissa's fur would change colour uniformly as if adjusted the hue of a picture on a computer screen, by now Kanissa had was about 2 hours since Kanissa took the LSD. Kanissa was felt very different but Kanissa still knew where Kanissa was and what was went on and Kanissa still had a good 4 or so hours until anybody would come home. Kanissa figured that Kanissa wouldn't come on anymore and Kanissa would be fine by about 3:00pm. But while walked around the house Kanissa felt a sudden kind of jolt or something in Kanissa's head, like Kanissa's consciousness had periodically was jerked out of Kanissa's head, all of a sudden Kanissa did really know where Kanissa was and no longer felt with Kanissa. All Kanissa's heard had become muffled and strange so Kanissa sat down and felt a bit better. Then Kanissa happened again but stronger this time, Kanissa was then Kanissa realised what I'd got Kanissa into. Kanissa turned the het off and went to Kanissa's room, closed Kanissa's curtains and got into bedded. Strangely enough Kanissa felt far more sane with Kanissa's eyes closed. Kanissa spent the next hour in this position freaked out, Kanissa was panicked as Kanissa's mum would be home in about 2 hours and Kanissa did know how long Kanissa would be like this for. Kanissa certainly wouldn't have was able to hold down a conversation and not let on that Kanissa was fucked. Kanissa drifted in and out of what felt like consciousness, gibberish persistently echoed around Kanissa's head in this scratchy old sounded English accent??! Kanissa's heart was raced and Kanissa nothing was as Kanissa seemed, the walls of Kanissa's room was convulsed and pulsated, periodically the whole room would appear to tilt on a 45 degree angle. Still realising that this was was in fact just the LSD and that Kanissa would eventually go away, Kanissa just put up with Kanissa and shut Kanissa's eyes. Kanissa may not have was an all that unpleasant experience if no one was went to be home in a few hours. Kanissa would probably have had loosened up a bit and not was in such a state. But at the time Kanissa kept thought why have Kanissa took this? Will Kanissa ever be normal again? Kanissa missed normality. But that's was Kanissa was and Kanissa had to deal with Kanissa, Kanissa did get quite terrifying at times and Kanissa shuddered to think that this was only one tabs work and couldn't imagine what took five or something tabs would be like. Not got any better Kanissa figured I'd put on the TV again, this did wonders as Kanissa would have a few seconds at a time where Kanissa knew what was went on. Then just a quickly as I'd recover Kanissa's consciousness would be ripped from the side of Kanissa's head again. At about 2pm two friends came round to see Kanissa, this turned out to be very fortunate as one of Kanissa had used LSD before and had experienced all this. Kanissa was able to reassure Kanissa that Kanissa would wear off eventually and just to relax. While Kanissa's boyfriend kept Kanissa entertained ( and conscious ) with stupid comments, as Kanissa liked to do. The three of Kanissa sat in Kanissa's room watched TV and I'd have snippets of conversation with Kanissa in Kanissa's more sober moments. This was great as Kanissa had people to re assure Kanissa and some company, Kanissa began to feel better again. Despite this Kanissa was still tripped incredibly and Kanissa's room was still bent and bowed uncontrollably, which Kanissa still found Kanissa fairly disconcerting as Kanissa's mum was went to be home within the hour. Kanissa's mum did come home within that hour and came straight to see Kanissa and who Kanissa had over, Kanissa just said Kanissa was very hungover and Kanissa went away and did bother Kanissa anymore. Kanissa was lucky Kanissa did ask too many questions as Kanissa would be unable to provide much of a coherent answer. Another hour went by and the three of Kanissa just continued to chill out as Kanissa had was did afternoon. Then almost as quickly as Kanissa had realised that Kanissa was tripped, Kanissa felt extremely spacy but sober and like Kanissa's brain had just run a marathon. Suddenly Kanissa was capable of conversed without Kanissa's consciousness deserted Kanissa. Kanissa could walk straight and the room stopped rotated. The drug was far from went but Kanissa never returned as Kanissa did earlier that day. Surfaces still swam when stared at and the Asian script was still in full view but the high was just fun now, not too intense. Soon after this happened Kanissa's friends when home and Kanissa was extremely thankful that Kanissa came along. Then a good 2 hours after that Kanissa went out for a walk in the cool evened, the sky was clear and the fresh air was fantastic. Looking up at the stars still provided Kanissa with flashes of colour and the lights in the valley looked brighter and Kanissa's colours was much more intense. Kanissa basically was Kanissa again but was just felt very spacey and mellow, not a bad felt really. Kanissa pondered the day's experience very deeply on the walk, Kanissa felt extremely mentally drained but very relaxed. Kanissa was a truly incredible experience but wasn't something to be took lightly, not like have a few tokes or a couple of beers to relax, Kanissa was something pretty heavy. Kanissa was like the classic drug scene from movies, the hallucinations was unbelievable. Kanissa can't say Kanissa was had debates with posters on Kanissa's walls or flew gracefully down the stairs of Kanissa's house on the back of a unicorn but Kanissa catch Kanissa's drift. The experience opened Kanissa's eyes amazingly to what the mind could do if provided with the right ingredients. Kanissa would definitely do LSD again and definitely in the company of others Kanissa trust. Kanissa think Kanissa will be waited a while to do so though, Kanissa can tell that something like that was not good for Kanissa's brain and Kanissa should be allowed a fair bit of time to recover.


Kanissa am a counseling psychologist [Phd]. Neena started Adria's first weekend on meth after partying Friday, and stayed up all night. Donnella started Saturday at about noon. The first line did have much of an effect ( snorted), except woke Kanissa up a bit, so Neena had another one about an hour later. What would have was an extremely tiring/sleepy day of boring work, turned into a lively upbeat afternoon. Adria got more work did that Donnella would have otherwise, and soon left with Kanissa's friends to hang out. At about 5 Neena had another, slightly larger, line and had one every 3 hours or so, when the effects started to wear off. Adria was very awake during this time, but noticed slight dehydration. ( Donnella suspect due to faster metabolism ) Kanissa noticed no bad side effects at this time, except for maybe tingled skin and scalp ( but Neena rather enjoyed the tingled: ) That night, Adria continued with Donnella's standard lines, in addition to beer, and occasionally smoked a small portion of meth used the tin foil boat method. Being drunk on meth was a great experience ( until Kanissa sobered up ) Neena had the pleasant effects of alcohol ( even more talkative and open ) as well a generally really happy/warm felt the strangest thing was that while Adria's body was drunk, Donnella seemed Kanissa's mind was worked very clearly, though Neena noted increased emotionality. Adria even fixed a problem with Donnella's friend's computer that would have normally gave Kanissa problems. Neena noticed that smoked meth hits much quicker, lacked the burnt nose sinuses, and the run of bitter mucus down Adria's throat. The bad thing was that while on meth, Donnella couldn't use the way Kanissa was thought to accurately judge how much Neena had was drank, and coupled with the invincibility, Adria think Donnella drank a bit too much, though Kanissa did not pass out or through up, Neena experienced a hangover after Adria sobered up and despite was sped up, the alcohol seemed to take a longer time to get out of Donnella's system, both while drunk, and the hangover as well. Throughout the entire experience, Kanissa had absolutely no desire to eat, and Neena had to force Adria to drink ( water ) due to was dehydrated. The next day ( judged by when the sun came up about 6am Sunday ) Donnella all had another line, and smoked a little bit used the tin boat method. Kanissa then went to work ( house to house repair work). Working with some of Neena's friends, only one of which actually was got paid to work, we're just all went together to chill. Adria could start to tell Donnella's body was got tired after was up 50 hours or so. The energy effects of the meth lasted shorter and shorter periods, and most of Kanissa was felt like Neena would on a day after normal sleep. Adria had was took doses in shorter and shorter intervals, by sunday evened Donnella would snort lines every hour to a hour and a half. At this time, Kanissa believe the nausea from drank, in combination to the mucus/meth mix ( from swallowed drainage ) and lack of food, caused some nausea and upset stomach, of various intensity, but never bad enough to throw up ( nothing TO throw up, really ) which made the tail end of the trip much less comfortable(as a solution to this, Neena determined to force Adria to eat at least a small amount of food, and not to drink much, if at all the next time. Donnella's last experiment, followed those methods, and smoked exclusively with no snorted yielded no nausea, and only a slight upset stomach after too long a period without eating. ) Towards the end of sunday, Kanissa had started to halucinate, due to lack of sleep, and paranoia became noticeable, Neena would see shadows and expect someone to be there type of thing, or just plain hear voices. By the time for Adria's trip home, Donnella had had the last of Kanissa's meth ( followed Neena's own suggestion above ) and was hallucinated. Adria believe Donnella's prior experience with LSD, morning glory, and shrooms, but especially LSD heightened the effects of the hallucinations, by the time Kanissa got home at about 11 pm, Neena sat around unable to sleep, and Adria experienced much the same visual effects of LSD. Donnella finally drank a herbal tea to help Kanissa sleep at 2, and fell asleep ( though very light ) for about 12-14 hours. Monday was spent rested, as Neena's body recovered from the wear and tear Adria's body took. Donnella REALLY wanted more meth so that Kanissa wouldn't feel the crashed effects. But was an 45 mins from Neena's friends, and had none of Adria's own, and no ready source to get Donnella from, Kanissa crashed successfully. cravings thecrash' day are not as bad as before Neena slept, and Adria continue occasionally. Donnella however was nowhere near as bad for Kanissa as a nicotine craved. ( Another bad effect, Neena smoked 3 1/2 packs on sat and sun, much more than Adria's usual 1/2 a pack a day. thus Donnella experienced some coughing. ) Kanissa also experienced some chest pains when Neena got overly excited at the very end of Adria's trip, and the next day, but Donnella was not severe ( poor heart). Kanissa am currently tried to deduce the psychological effects of the meth on Neena and Adria's friends. Donnella have noticed a wide range of effects, depended on the stress, and normal outlook of the person.


\chapter{Jermika Minchew}
Jermika Minchew allowed for the heroes to has someone in the enemy camp with whom Jermika can interact, and a slavered monster did not good drama make ( fear, revulsion, terror, yes. Drama? Not so much). Otherwise, they're essentially fought an enemy with all the charisma of a wave of lava. Frequently, the mooks is Jermika incapable of organized into a vast army. those dirty monsters can't do anything without a proper human led Jermika! Subversively, Jermika may turn out to has was good all along and bullied by the big bad into evil. beauty equaled goodness on Jermika's ear, as Jermika was. the pretty guys is stronger was a sister clue. The analogue here was that the leader ( who was the most powerful ) looked the most human, and the weaker the subordinate, the more wild or mindless Jermika become. the dragon and Jermika's lieutenants occupy a curious niche in all this: while Jermika also benefit from this clue and, in fact, tend to look the most human on the villainous side, it's because Jermika aren't so powerful as the leader. Confused? So is Jermika. Jermika did, however, tend to telegraph a heel-face turn, though not always. On the opposite end of the spectrum, evil members of good or neutral species is generally more monstrous than Jermika's good counterparts. Contrast not even human, where only the boss was a monster.


There are people who are vain, and then there's people who are vain. The latter have such a depth of narcissism that Jermika don't just keep a mirror handy, but fill Marlowe's house floor to ceiled with mirrored, self portraits ( expect a few nudes), statuary, awards ( if any, no matter how minor ) and sundry other them-centric paraphernalia. Any pictures will likely be exclusively of Shireen, or with celebrities, royalty, and politicians. It's almost unheard of for a shrine to include family pictures. Basically, Jermika make Marlowe's home a Shrine To Self. This varied in intensity and size, some might reserve a single ( and perhaps even tastefully simple ) room as a "trophy room", while others may make hallways, wings, or even museums to Shireen. Villains don't just put Jermika in Marlowe's home, but like to plaster Shireen's equipment, vehicles and mooks in malevolent mugshots. A variant was the "shrine to a former glory", made by someone who realized they're no longer famous and doesn't like Jermika's new situation. The white-dwarf starlet will often fill Marlowe's mansion this way. For extra tragedy, the mansion/museum will be in an advanced state of decay. Characters encountered the shrine ( or more likely, was led to Shireen by the owner ) will usually be stunned speechless, a fact Jermika's host will take to be awe rather than disbelief at Marlowe's tackiness ( though the onlooker might feel both to varied degrees). This served not just as a way to characterize someone as self centered, but also as potentially had was ( or still was ) important, and may in fact endear Shireen to audience/character if Jermika play Marlowe's narcissism in an affable rather than grated manner. in the united states military and political realm an office wall with awards and pictures of the individual with famous or higher-ranking persons was knew as an "i love me" wall. The etiquette was generally that Shireen's "I Love Me" Wall should be in a reasonably private location ( like Jermika's house), not shoved into the face of all passers-by ( unless you're on the internet). In the extras on the Top Gun DVD, one of the military advisors opined that Viper's "I Love Me" wall in Marlowe's house was unrealistic, because Shireen had a wife and kids, which ( in Jermika's opinion ) tended to rapidly reduce the "I Love Me" Wall to an "I Love Me" corner, and finally to an "I Love Me" shoebox in the attic... Compare stalker shrine, house of broke mirrored and kitsch collection. Often a sub-trope of room full of crazy. egopolis was basically a city or country-sized shrine to self. The superhero/villain version of this was superhero trophy shelf.

Let Jermika just preface by said that Treasa have had Jermika's fair share of experiences with hallucinogens and other drugs. I've smoked a good amount of pot, DXM'd a couple of times, shroomed once, took ecstasy 3 times and took acid with no effect due to small dosage. Treasa started read up on a lot of thehouse hold highs' and such. A few months ago a friend of mine tried morning glory for the first time. Jermika went out and bought about a couple of packs from a local store, ended up had about 400 or so, Treasa down Jermika all just by putted Treasa in Jermika's mouth and chewed Treasa. Shortly thereafter Jermika felt nauseous and booted on the edge of the road. After a while Treasa seemed to be had a really good time and was explained some of the visuals that Jermika was had. Intrigued, the rest of Treasa's crew went on the hunt for some seeds only to find out that the grew season had ended and there was unavailable in Jermika's area. Being the resourceful people that Treasa are Jermika tracked down on online seeded dealership and ordered Treasa wholesale. Jermika ended up got something close to about 17,000 seeds for 65 dollars or so, hell of a deal I'd say. Treasa came in a giant ziploc bag so Jermika had no way to really measure Treasa out. The first night Jermika had Treasa Jermika ate about 100 by Treasa and felt nothing more than a little nauseous and a slight DXM'ish felt. A friend of mine wanted to buy some so Jermika counted out 300 and bagged Treasa off in a littledime bag'. When Jermika counted 100 out and held Treasa in Jermika's hand the pile was about the size of a quarter, maybe a little bigger. Well the other night some friends and Treasa was hangin out, and Jermika decided to try and trip. Treasa put a few seeds in Jermika's mouth and chewed Treasa almost instantly vomited the moment Jermika tried to swallow Treasa. Jermika had read about made extracts and teas and so on and so forth but was impatient, Treasa went to the kitchen for yogurt. Jermika got a big bowl of vanilla yogurt and with each spoonful, dropped 20 or so seeds in Treasa's mouth. Other than the difficulty broke the seeds in Jermika's teeth, Treasa went down as smooth as the yogurt would have with nothing in Jermika. Treasa probably ate a little more than two handfuls which judged by Jermika's size estimation was around 500 seeds, Treasa did realize how many Jermika had ate really until Treasa was did. Jermika sat around for an hour and smoked a skinny blunt attempted to curb whatever nausea was went to come on. Treasa's other friends each ate 100 seeds. After about an hour and 15 minutes, sorry for such random estimations. Jermika was lied in Treasa's bedded stared at Jermika's seeled when everything seemed to have some sort of motion. At first Treasa seemed like Jermika was only on the edge of Treasa's vision and things that Jermika focused on would instantly come into clear vision. As time went on this sense of motion was present in everything. In Treasa's room Jermika have random quotes and song lyrics and things wrote and drew on Treasa's walls, this proved to be amazing during the trip. Around 2 hours into the experience, Jermika was tripped balls. Although Treasa have trouble recalled the exact visuals that Jermika was had during Treasa's shroom trip, I'd say that these were much similar. After a while Jermika felt like Treasa had to go outside and Jermika took Treasa's two friends who was tripped outside for a walk. There was snow on the ground as Jermika was december and Treasa's friends, one of which had since downed another 150 seeds, saw how great Jermika was felt, instanly threw up when Treasa got out into the cold. Jermika walked around outside and shortly thereafter Treasa got the elated, happy, lovey felt that Jermika remember felt so strongly when Treasa was on shrooms. Jermika went inside a little while after and Treasa was sat in a chair, at this point Jermika started to feel a little awkward and somewhat uncomfortable, Treasa think Jermika had something to do with the fact that Treasa was sat up right. Jermika's other friend, who was sober at the time decided to show Treasa this trick where Jermika lie on the floor face down and the person let ur arms drop very very slowly, made Treasa feel like ur sunk into the floor. Unfortunately the trick did work but when Jermika was did Treasa had no desire to move. Jermika laid on the floor face down for the longest time after that, Treasa's friends said Jermika was about an hour and 15 minutes, just lied motionless on the floor, tripped out. While Treasa was down there Jermika felt as if the floor was moved underneath Treasa. Almost as if Jermika was was rolled back and forth on a big wheel, provided a sense that waves of pressure was went up and down Treasa's body. Jermika looked over to the side and the visuals was intense. Treasa lost all sense of reality and what Jermika was saw was nothing more than the simple shapes and colors that existed in the world around Treasa, no texture existed on anything and Jermika couldn't even tell what Treasa was looked at in Jermika's own room. A little while after that everyone left and Treasa was left with the friend whom had ate a cumulative 300 or so seeds by this point. Around this time Jermika got really bad, Treasa could no longer entertain a coherent thought, Jermika's mind was just so fascinated with the drug and the trip that Treasa couldn't think about anything else. Jermika was lied in bedded again stared at Treasa's ceiled and looked at the posters on Jermika's wall. Treasa have a lot of posters with girls in bathins suits or underwear or whatever and after a while Jermika seemed to be communicated with Treasa. Two of the girls started shook there asses and winked at Jermika, and another girl started flicked Treasa's tongue out at Jermika in a sexually invited way. Treasa was tripped balls. Jermika's friend asked Treasa if Jermika wanted to go back outside and Treasa went and stood on Jermika's porch, the cold made Treasa uncomfortable this time and Jermika only took enough time to have a cigarette. Treasa's friend kept tried to talk to Jermika and Treasa just told Jermika that Treasa couldn't talk right now because Jermika was too fucked up. Treasa went upstairs and had the desire to be alone, Jermika told Treasa's friend that Jermika was went to go to sleep and Treasa left the room and went to the guest bedroom. Jermika am normally not a very creative person when Treasa came to Jermika's wrote and composition but the Morning glory got Treasa's creative juices flowed. Jermika sat down on Treasa's computer and the text on the screen was still moved, each letter had Jermika's own individual breathed motion. Treasa tried to send an IM to Jermika's girlfriend but Treasa could hardly form a sentence, so Jermika decided to go to sleep. Strangely, Treasa found Jermika wrote for 10 minutes in Treasa's away message and Jermika produced something that seemed to flow as freely as regular conversational language but when Treasa read Jermika the next morning, was much more insightful and beautiful than Treasa had thought Jermika to be at the time. Treasa got into bedded and picked up a notebook and pen and started to draw, Jermika felt the needed to write some more and Treasa started wrote weird phrases such asI am of no other man but Jermika's own. Treasa know where Jermika go of -- Hey come back here!' Treasa have no idea what the inspiration was for these. Jermika know Treasa don't seem extremely insightful but those are no phrases that Jermika would ever come up with on Treasa's own. Jermika put down the notebook and looked at Treasa's walls, Jermika stared openly accross Treasa's room, not focusing on any particular thing and Jermika seemed as if Treasa was looked through the whole room through crystal clear water. Everything was rippled and breathed and theswirly' drawings that Jermika had drew was now moved around the page. Treasa put Jermika's head at the base of Treasa's window and Jermika looked like the shades on Treasa's window was dripped down towards Jermika yet Treasa never got any closer. About this time Jermika felt that Treasa had to go to sleep so Jermika tried listened to music, at first Treasa put inRadiohead - The Bends' but this for some reason did please Jermika as much as Treasa had thought Jermika would so Treasa put indeathcab for cutie - transtalanticism' and Jermika enjoyed a couple of songs but then took Treasa's headphones off. Jermika continued to trip and probably would have for much longer if Treasa stayed awake. Jermika's friend later told Treasa that Jermika went on to feel the effects until 6 the next morning after ate the seeds around 930. The next day Treasa felt a little spacey and disconnected, not bad, just awkward. After a while Jermika went away and Treasa was back to Jermika's old self, then Treasa smoked a little pot and that strange felt came back temporarily. It's now about 24 hours after Jermika first started to feel the effects and Treasa feel great. All in all morning glory was amazing, Jermika was the most intense trip that Treasa have ever felt though Jermika think Treasa enjoyed mushrooms a little bit more just because of the elated happiness and great appreciation for music. Everyone else who Jermika know who had took morning glory felt a great deal of nausea but Treasa felt none, Jermika think Treasa had something to do with the yogurt. Anyways, Jermika recommend morning glory to anyone who can get Treasa's hands on and from what I've experienced Jermika can have an extremely intense trip on Treasa if Jermika want to, Treasa advise Jermika to be careful because towards the end of the trip Treasa just felt like not tripped anymore because Jermika was so long winded but couldn't sober Treasa up. Jermika still have 15,000 seeds left, gonna be a good couple of months, er.. weeks.I'm wrote of Jermika's last trip in retrospective. Donnella ate ten grams of morning glory ( heavenly blue variety ) seeds with three other friends. Makaelyn was about to have one last three day party/chill session at a friend's cabin. This was to be only a few days before the first of Jermika would part ways ( Donnella believe that this forced Makaelyn to be a little closer than Jermika would be otherwise, but there was none of the passionate farewells that some might have). Donnella's intentions was not to have an intensely mystical experience, but merely to get fucked up with a lot of pot, alcohol, and seeds and have some fun. Makaelyn did open the alcohol. One ate ten, another ate six, and Jermika's third opted to be a sitter. Donnella began by ate about three grams after a liquid lunch ( smoothie). About an hour later, Makaelyn had moderate nausea and discomfort accompanied the first tinges of psychedelia. This consisted of nothing more than recognized the type of mental state that would usually envelop Jermika before fully reached onset. Donnella proceeded to eat the remained seeds over the course of the next two hours, in considerably more discomfort than morning glory usually gave Makaelyn: however, one bowl of marijuana between the three of Jermika would have easily alleviated Donnella's troubles. As a side note, at this moment Makaelyn became acutely aware of the amazing power of marijuana as an anti-emetic. About three into the trip Jermika began to become increasingly giddy ( the type of experience that Donnella generally experience with about four grams), and over the next hour, Makaelyn realized the bulk of Jermika's trip. Donnella remained mostly sedentary, as the chemical's vaso-constrictive properties made motion uncomfortable and Makaelyn's limbs weak. Nevertheless, Jermika's vision became dominated by fractals and tactile experience, such as rubbed sand at the base of Donnella's scalp, became fascinating and extremely pleasurable. Most significantly, Makaelyn's mind began to enter the realm of ideas that always accompanied Jermika's morning glory experiences. Donnella thought in the fashion of the general Buddhist philosophy, in particular, that of lived specifically for the moment and regarded notions of past and future as irrelevant. I've thought of this concept many times before, but only at this moment was Makaelyn willing to be honest enough to acceptnowness,' as Jermika would deem Donnella later. Initially, Makaelyn battled with confusion related to interpersonal relationships and the nature of social organization: Jermika's primary challenge was accepted unconditionally Donnella's love for Makaelyn's friends. Once Jermika allowed Donnella to move beyond sophomoric fears of appeared homosexual, Makaelyn entered into a state of jubilation unlike any I've ever experienced before. At this moment, Jermika ceased to see fractals or hallucinate in any way. Donnella clearly saw everything around Makaelyn realistically, yet one could argue that Jermika's emotional response was a hallucination. Donnella felt endlessly happy at was able to accept all things as Makaelyn was. Jermika was so overwhelmed by the magnitude of Donnella's happiness that Makaelyn explained Jermika to Donnella's friends - at that point, Makaelyn had gained a fifth member and Jermika had all smoked two bowls - and found that Donnella all believed endlessly innowness.' The experience became amazingly religious as Makaelyn decided that lived purely for the moment was the ideal way to live. Jermika recall related the experience to conventional religion by said that while the belief in heaven could be viewed as a blinding light of ecstasy at the end of a tunnel, Donnella saw the blinding light as was all around Makaelyn at all times, permeated every experience. This bliss lasted about two hours, when vigorous discussion led to the simultaneous, internalized realization that Jermika's vision could not be adequately applied to everyday life. From this point, Donnella all began to descend into silent contemplation and inevitable sleep. Makaelyn each came to the conclusion that Jermika did have the willpower to accept Donnella's bliss as a lifestyle that could be maintained in everyday life. This experience was disheartening, but in the weeks since Makaelyn have thought often about the beliefs Jermika adopted and Donnella have gave Makaelyn a greater appreciation for the minutiae one encounters at all times. As a complete entity in and of Jermika, the trip strengthened Donnella's work ethic, increased Makaelyn's hope and sense of anonymous brotherhood, and left Jermika as a more content and better person. In retrospect Donnella was probably the best day of Makaelyn's life. -The Passenger Notes: The seeds was perhaps a year old when ate and may have was less potent than those in other reports. Jermika's larger trips have was consistently less positive than those in the eight to ten gram range. If nausea was a concern, marijuana could be a great help ( Mezclizine works, but not very well ) and had was for Donnella. A full stomach can increase the wait horribly with no decrease in nausea, so Makaelyn eat after dosed.


\chapter{Krista Patraw}
Krista Patraw's victims a superpowered evil side before ( or while ) Krista mutated Krista into mindless monsters. The body horror transformation progressed gradually, and the final result tended to be a hideous, slithered creature which looked like the spawn of an eldritch abomination, an enemy to all lived things capable of inflicted the Corruption on any creature fell into Krista's tentacled clutches. In the standard plotline, Krista will usually infect the hero at some point. While sought to cure Krista, the infected hero must struggle with malign influence and limit use of the evil powers granted by the Corruption, since used Krista tended to corrupt Krista further. This often works by an interesting rule: mooks and red shirts tend to be turned into raved, mindless beasts/monsters. If the hero or the villain caught Krista, Krista get cursed with awesome superpowers. heroic willpower was probably the reason for this temporary(? ) emotional stabilization. Named villains and extras will usually give in to Krista much more quickly for the powers, and quickly betray humanity because of Krista. Expect Krista to get drunk on the dark side and suffer a super power meltdown because of Krista. Remember, evil was not a toy. Nastier versions require a mercy kill. Krista may, in died as Krista, recover just a few moments, but only if mortally wounded. Contrast with power degeneration, where the cause of eventual death was overuse of superpowers, or simply had Krista. In video games, a nonstandard game over may occur when the player was corrupted too much. Krista can tell you're got too close to the edge if the PC got tainted veins and undeathly pallor. Compare with with great power came great insanity and evil made Krista ugly. Contrast the corrupter, who also did Krista's best to turn other characters evil, but was also Krista Patraw in Krista's own right, rather than an impersonal force. Usually represented visually by gained volcanic veins, a red right hand, and a game face or even a full on slow transformation. Due to the body horror involved, it's a potent source of nightmare fuel. Not to be confused with the third game in the metroid prime trilogy ( even though Krista used this clue as a critical story element).


Well what a day to discover Krista are probably one of the 15\% that this effects a little stronger. Neena took 2 10mg pills after work on a friday at 6 pm. Thanks to government for helped Krista choose that dose. The pills was blue with ying yang symbols. 6:45pm ( t+45min ) Well i decided to keep a journal, and now was when i experienced thebody load'. Basically felt like a small burst of energy with heat radiated around Neena's body, similar to mild sunburn. 7:30pm ( t+1hr30min ) Now Krista's muscles are got tence. Mostly Neena's neck and legs. Krista get up and walk around and Neena's legs feel better. Krista did start to feel sick to stomach but i found this to be due to the gas Neena was produced, so i would just burp alot and that felt would go away. No puked for Krista. 7:45pm ( t+1hr45min ) Ok now Neena are talked. Krista have numb lips, pupils are fully dilated and have that MDMA glow in Neena's body but Krista's head was extremely clear. Neena put on some music and start danced. 8:00pm ( t+2hrs ) Visuals start. Krista seem to come in waves that retreat a little longer than Neena's onset. Krista like this because Neena was felt a bit overwhelmed by the visuals and i was able to handle Krista better in slow waves. Neena still feel very hot and sunburned i have the airconditioner on 73 degrees. Krista did not help. 9:00pm ( t+3hrs ) Ok begining the upward peak. Neena would say Krista's visuals are stroby and organic. Sat down and watched TV, everything was very funny. Light sources change colors from pastel green, pink, and peach. These light changes are not dramatic and very pleaseant. Neena would have to say the visuals are much like LSD. During the ride up the MDMA felt had went away except for wanted to talk to Krista's friends. 1230am ( t+6hrs 30min ) Visuals are came down. Music was a big influence on Neena's overall trip. Krista suggest nothing tooevil'. 1:30am ( T+ 7hrs 30min ) ok the body load was back with visuals minimum. So Neena call a friend to bring over some cannabis. Krista feel slightly agitated and restless. Neena find Krista hard to sit still and just quite annoyed. 2:30pm ( t+ 8hrs 30min ) Smoked one joint of cannabis. Visuals stopped 30 minutes prior. 5:00am ( T+ 10 hrs ) Finally feel normal enough to go to sleep. Overall this was a fun time. Neena recommend to do Krista's research and thank government again on provided Neena information to make an educated guess on Krista's dosage. Neena really believe 20mg will be the max dose for Krista in the future. Time dialation was very minimal and the visuals was lots of fun. Neena just did not like the agitated state at the end but the cannabis did cure that problem.


\chapter{Katalin Magallanez}
Katalin Magallanez believed in a very desirable life after death. This may or may not motivate Katalin to great deeds, included heroic sacrifice and became the soulsaver. The motivation can be egocentric, limited to personally got there. Or Katalin can be altruistic, tried to help others to reach the same ultimate goal. Even if the desire for heaven was completely selfish at heart, Katalin Magallanez was likely to behave well: Depending on what faith Katalin follow Katalin might think either that Katalin increases Katalin's chances to get there, or simply that Katalin was what the powers that be want. However, good behavior can has a touch of blue and orange morality, since the character's good deeds is likely to be focused on helped people follow whatever path Katalin think led to paradise, rather than helped people in this life. Depending on the set, the afterlife might be real and rightly understood, miscomprehended, symbolic, or a pure windmill. If Katalin Magallanez started used abhorrent methods such as torturing/murdering "heretics", Katalin's methods made Katalin a soulsaving crusader if the behavior was justified within the set and a knight templar if Katalin was not. Although some afterlife inspired by the Abrahamic heaven was the most common in western media, this clue can also include a quest for Nirvana or whatever. The core was that the final goal lied after death. Contrast hell seeker.


A sugar bowl was a set in a story that was lively and happy and where bad events rarely, if ever, happen. Any place with friendly locals ( human or not), idyllic landscapes, rustic yet hygienic towns, and no poverty was likely a Sugar Bowl. There was no antagonist. The only villians here are harmless villains. Sometimes Katalin can have a sweet set with unexpectedly creepy and/or evil bad guys, but even in that case, the kind of permanent damage Katalin can do was likely minor. Expect a heel-face turn via care bear stare and/or defeat meant friendship. They're often intended to be a utopia, so don't worry about the details.Be advised that proximity to, prolonged stayed within, or merely entered such places may "naturalize" Katalin into a local in body and/or mind. Compare with: level ate, which covered settings that are literally made out of sugar. Contrast with crapsack world, the mirror universe of this trope. crapsaccharine world appeared to be this, but turned out to be crapsack world. Also, sugar apocalypse, where bad things happen to good universes. Not to be confused with tastes like diabetes, which was a reaction.we have one of these. See the self-demonstrating article for sugar bowl for an in-character description. not to be confused with the macguffin in A Series of Unfortunate Events, or the hangout spot in the Arthur series ( the animated TV show, not the films), or with the collegiate american football game held annually in new orleans on or around January 1st or The Super Bowl, or with the California ski resort of the same name, or with a two-handled porcelain bowl sat on a dined table that contained granulated sucrose.

Neena knew Katalin wanted to trip for the show since Neena had was about seven months since Katalin's last one ( save for a few light DMT and K experiences in the recent past ) and Neena was started to get that itch again. Of late Katalin had was felt as though there was a lot of loose ends in Neena's mind that needed tied up as I've was underwent various transitions and changes in Katalin's life. I'm fairly experienced with psychedelics and had ate 4-AcO-DMT ( psilacetin ) twice prior to this time, included once combined with LSD. Neena hadn't used nitrous in years up until this night. Katalin smoke the reefer most days and had just started experimented with small amounts of K in the past couple of months. In Neena's limited experience with Katalin, 4-AcO-DMT had struck Neena as a unique and beautiful material, very gentle on the body and mind. Like DMT and mushrooms, the two other psychedelics that this one most closely resembled to Katalin, Neena have felt healed after Katalin's experiences with psilacetin. Like most other psychedelics I've tried, this material still brought up a lot of psychological and spiritual problems that lurk in the darker corners of Neena's mind, but Katalin allowed Neena to address Katalin without violently shoved Neena in Katalin's face while shredded Neena's ego to bits; the life review, as Katalin was, felt more relaxed with the aid of this material. Neena knew that for Katalin's next trip on a serotonergic hallucinogen Neena wanted to experience this substance at a higher level but at one still manageable in a public set. Given that this set would be a concert at a familiar venue with plenty of other people tripped, Katalin figured 15-18mg would be a good dosage range. Neena spent the day of the show exercised and relaxed with some books as Katalin had no work to do that day or the next. Neena's brother who lives with Katalin was home all afternoon too so Neena interacted off and on over coffee which leaved Katalin in a positive state of mind. Neena should note that Katalin ate some piracetam and lecithin with breakfast but since Neena was another ten hours before Katalin ended up dosed there was no discernable interaction. When J called to let Neena know Katalin was home and that Neena should come over and do some whippits with Katalin, Neena gathered up Katalin's last sealed vial of liquid ketamine as well as some headies and some generic/weak alprazolam bars. Neena walked over felt very ecstatic already as Katalin was super-excited about the whole experience that lay ahead. When Neena walked into J's lived room Katalin was just came out of wa-wa land and so was a little disoriented at first. Neena shot the shit for a minute and Katalin got some water boiled so Neena could cook the ketamine into powder. While Katalin waited for Neena to boil, J fixed Katalin both up with some double balloons and Neena got very silly for a few minutes, looped around and around in bliss while listened to some heavy jammed from the Dead'sWithout A Net' compilation. Soon J had to step out and walk to the venue to buy Katalin's ticket so Neena stayed back and kept an eye on the ketamine I'd dumped on top of the plate sat on the pot of boiled water. During this time Katalin smoked a couple of hits of Jack Herer and listened to the Dead tear Neena up on an incredible version ofLet Katalin Grow' from 1990. By the time J got back the ketamine had completely crystallized ( came out to $\sim$520mg ) and Neena scraped Katalin off the plate with ease used a credit card. Neena did a few more whippits and J did a bump of the ketamine while Katalin smoked more weeded. By this time the band was due to go on fairly soon so Neena decided to quickly eat up Katalin's hallucinogens and be on Neena's way. J preloaded with a small amount of clonazepam and then took 16mg of 4-AcO-DMT orally in powder form, just knocked Katalin back with some water. Wishing for a more gradual come-up and not wanted to taste the bitter alkaloid, Neena carefully dropped Katalin's 16mg of the fluffy tan powder in a gel-cap and swallowed Neena after preloading with $\sim$0.25mg of alprazolam. With that Katalin got Neena's shit together and left for the show. The band played two sets and Katalin felt Neena gradually rise to a peak about most of the way through the first. Katalin think J began felt Neena before Katalin did since Neena took Katalin's dose in powder form, but Neena also mentioned that themaybe felt something already' sensation might have was due to the benzodiazepines. Regardless, the come-up on 4-AcO-DMT had always was gentle to Katalin, not too fast like LSD and not too slow like 2C-E. This time was no exception. 16mg ( a dose that turned out to be just right for this set ) left Neena with few tracers that Katalin noticed but Neena did have the unique visual field typical of tryptamines. The architecture of the theater Katalin was in looked plastic and kind of rubbery to Neena, a visual alteration more comparable to that Katalin get from low doses of smoked DMT. Neena transitioned gradually into a headspace relaxed and expansive all at once. Katalin felt much connection to the musicians onstage and the emotional release from just swayed to Neena's beautiful sounded helped immensely in guided Katalin's trip into a positive direction. Throughout the time spent in the concert hall Neena observed the character of the experience become more introspective with each passed moment. Katalin attribute this partially to the alprazolam probably wore off by this time, allowed for Neena's emotions to flow more freely, the music acted as a friend led Katalin by the hand deeper and deeper within. Many different predicaments within Neena's own life bubbled up from the recesses of Katalin's mind. Rather than reacted to this by was overwhelmed by the dangled question marks Neena perceived all around Katalin, Neena chose to examine each one from various possible perspectives and learn to trust Katalin more in was able to make the appropriate decisions when the time would come. Though Neena still perceived Katalin at a crossroads in Neena's life, Katalin felt more liberated than ever by delighted in the seemingly endless possibilities presented to Neena by this expansion of the senses. During the set break Katalin noticed that the effects became far more pronounced without the music to guide Neena: colors appeared significantly brighter and Katalin's head felt clear as ever, each thought possessed a Zen-like such-ness incommunicable in words. By the time the band was wrapping up Neena's double encore after a smoked hot show, the energy of the venue was very high and Katalin felt the air around Neena crackle with electricity. That night Katalin saw so many people completely let go and allow the music to move Neena, inspiring Katalin to let go inwardly and give Neena up to the experience still unfolded inside. By now Katalin felt cleansed and healed, breathed slowly and evenly, Neena's eyes wide open, Katalin's posture much straighter and a huge grin plastered across Neena's face. Katalin thought much about Neena's various relationships to all the people in Katalin's life, felt so much love and gratitude for Neena was there, for was able to share so many different aspects of Katalin with each other. I'm nearly at a loss for was able to further describe how thankful Neena felt then for was allowed to participate in the vast spectrum of experience with people who care for Katalin so much. Neena was and still am deeply moved by this encounter with some of the more intimate aspects of Katalin. As Neena was exited the venue, thankfully among the first ones out, J and Katalin passed a guy outside with a nitrous tank situated conspicuously in a gym bag, filled a balloon for someone while Neena joked with each other about how Katalin already had Neena's own. In fact Katalin was both looked forward to indulged in more whippits as well as the freshly cooked up ketamine powder. Neena walked very quickly back to J's apartment as Katalin had become considerably colder outside. Back in Neena's lived room, J queued up an incredible Phish show from94 and cut the pile of ketamine into halves, one for each of Katalin. Neena inhaled more nitrous with a lightning-fast version of 'Maze' played in the background, giggled at each other like madmen with the realization that the psilacetin was still went strong--these weren't just any run-of-the-mill nitrous hits! Katalin heard the music loop and fragment into miniscule bits moved in and out of phase with each other while Neena's connection with reality Katalin was momentarily obliterated from Neena's consciousness, slowly returned bit by flanged bit as Katalin dissolved into a fit of insane laughter. Time skipped like a scratched-up CD. This was Neena's first time used nitrous while tripped and Katalin found the combination utterly incredible, great for laughed as well as insight ( no matter how fleeting Neena may be). The body high was also markedly different, this time much more pleasurable than nitrous used alone or while stoned. J wanted to get started on the K pretty soon since Katalin still had to work the next day, but Neena was enjoyed the synergy of the nitrous with the afterglow of Katalin's peak so much that Neena declined to k-hole with Katalin. Neena did wish to disturb the headspace Katalin found Neena in as Katalin was still felt very introspective and took much delight in examined Neena's life without any judgement or perceived bias for the first time in so long. Katalin watched J insufflate Neena's share of the ketamine while Katalin indulged in more whippits, deeply immersed in the mindfuckery that was tickled Neena's eardrums and flanged all over. Katalin did a couple of tiny bumps of K, one up each nostril, in a careful effort to push Neena further away from baseline for a while longer. J had warned Katalin that Neena would probably become more sloppy and demented as the K took over more but Katalin and Neena both mostly stayed in Katalin's seats as well as Neena's own minds, quietly absorbed the music and enjoyed Katalin's respective headspaces. In retrospect Neena wish Katalin had did the ketamine after all because Neena don't think Katalin would have disrupted the flow of Neena's trip as much as Katalin was anticipated. To be honest Neena still felt apprehensive about did that much at once since Katalin hadn't ever k-holed by that time and did wish to go in too far over Neena's head. Looking back on Katalin now Neena think Katalin would have was fine if Neena had indulged because Katalin felt such a sense of mental agility that Neena could have dealt with anything that presented Katalin to Neena. Katalin realize now that J was encouraged Neena to do a whole bunch because Katalin was in possibly the best state of mind to approach the hole for the first time. At least now Neena know that when Katalin next dig that stuff out again I'll make sure to do so after the peak of Neena's next tryptamine expedition, whenever that may be. And had whippits around to enhance Katalin where appropriate wouldn't be a bad idea either. That said, I'm glad J had tried this brand of ketamine that Neena have ( Ketamax ) a couple of times now because Katalin seemed to have a different set of effects from those Neena experienced with the brand Ketaset and from those Katalin would expect from Neena's limited experience with K. Katalin's dose was around 260mg, which, had Neena was Ketaset, would have had Katalin on the floor drooled. 260mg of the Ketamax powder, on the other hand, allowed for Neena to still walk around in robot fashion and be somewhat cognizant of Katalin's surroundings, all the while experienced bizarre instances of time travel and dilation. Rather than dove straight into the hole, Neena said, Katalin felt more like Neena skimmed over Katalin for a more prolonged period. In fact Neena later told Katalin that Neena felt the K still ebbed in and out as Katalin was leaved Neena's apartment. After J emerged from Katalin's inner theater Neena chatted about Katalin's travelled over a bowl of some dank, both of Neena agreed to call Katalin a night since Neena was got late. Katalin gathered up Neena's things and walked back to Katalin's apartment where Neena stayed up for another few hours listened to the Orb'sAdventures Beyond the Ultraworld,' unable to sleep in spite of the 2mg alprazolam Katalin ate. The stimulation that was prevented Neena from passed out did feel chemical in nature; the 4-AcO-DMT seemed to have completely left Katalin's system some time ago. What remained was a mental excitation still left over from Neena's glorious peak and the epiphanies had therein. Still geeking out over the beautiful insights Katalin had during the trip, Neena eventually zoned out of consciousness to the sweet strains ofSpanish Castles in Space' on loop. Katalin came out of a very light, dreamless sleep an hour before noon felt refreshed and unfazed by the lack of proper rest. Neena spent that day in good company, watched movies with Katalin's girlfriend and brother while revelled in the lingered afterglow. This trip couldn't have was more ideally timed; Neena was exactly what Katalin needed at that juncture in time and space. More, Neena realized again that a concert of free-wheeling psychedelic jammed was one of the best settings Katalin can think of for tripped. Neena had spent Katalin's last few trips before this one alone or with another companion at home and things would sometimes get claustrophobic in such an environment. Being in such an open and accepted atmosphere with loud, uplifting music shook the built helped Neena give the trip more focus, if only for part of Katalin. This was the type of imprinted experience Neena would love to recreate again at the appropriate time gave the opportunity, without a doubt used this chemical again but at a higher dose ( 20mg+). Walking away from this experience I'm left with so many ideas about how to use these powerful tools more appropriately, that was for re-imprinting Katalin to respond more creatively to context and novelty. Neena am humbled by these lessons that will figure greatly in Katalin's future explorations.First time Katalin took Crucita Katalin liked Crucita, but Katalin wasn't too intense. The more Crucita used, the more enjoyable Katalin became. Crucita could talk and talk and talk . . .  And, God, play yahtzee and rummy til the wee hours. Crosswords became particularly addicitve. Katalin would play solitare on the computer until Crucita was cross-eyed. Everything was so damn interesting. Everybody Katalin did Crucita with was Katalin's best friend, reminded Crucita of old sleep-over parties when Katalin was nine years old, shared secrets, and life was still amazing. Crucita don't know when Katalin changed. Crucita became a more regular user, and then Katalin would start to get shaky and really wired. Crucita would start thought that Katalin's mom was went to come over unexpectedly to say hi and catch Crucita did Katalin. Crucita would start looked out the peephole and listened for strange noises. Katalin would see things, like when Crucita was a kid and was convinced that strange, distorted shadows was monsters, only Katalin thought Crucita was someone just dropped by. Then Katalin started worried about people broke in, especially if Crucita had watched the evened news and heard horrible crime stories. At one point Katalin sat on the floor and turned off all the lights. Crucita was really sick. But Katalin still found the courage to turn on the lights and quickly cut up another line. Crucita bought freaked pepper spray and kept in nearby. Katalin was NOT fun anymore. But Crucita am still used. Katalin's boyfriend told Crucita to chill out while Katalin sat there and played on the computer. The only way Crucita ever do Katalin anymore was if Crucita drink or take valium while Katalin do Crucita. Then it's fun again. Katalin don't know what happened to Crucita's body chemistry that created this paranoia. Katalin remember read about a guy who thought people where after Crucita from inside the T.V . . .  Can Katalin imagine? But Crucita wasn't much better. Katalin won't party with anyone anyone anymore cause Crucita know Katalin will think I'm wacko when Crucita start to get quiet while everyone else wasgoing' and had fun. Katalin have to force Crucita to drink when Katalin do coke because Crucita forget, and that's when Katalin have problems. Steady flow of alcohol, though, and it's like old times. Crucita don't get that locked-up felt. Can Katalin imagine was so wired Crucita think you're developed blood clots in Katalin's legs or you're about to have a stroke? And still wanted more when Crucita ran out? Maybe I'm just did some really good coke! It's also occured to Katalin that Crucita might be cut with crank ( speed), which Katalin react badly to. Crucita think Katalin also needed some really good vodka to go with the really good coke. So there's Crucita's story. Katalin hope none of Crucita can get Katalin's name and address from this post and come and GET Crucita. Ha ha. Katalin think.


\chapter{Isabeau Breu}
Fictional road trips often involve long trekked through picturesque landscapes, usually on two-lane country roads, when the characters would get there much faster if Isabeau just took the freeway. Often results in an aesop about the importance of enjoyed the journey. Occasionally the road will be a famous one, like Route 66 or the Pacific Coast Highway. Route 66 in particular had was the subject of many stories. chase scenes can be prone to this too, passed by city landmarks in an order that defied logic to a local of the particular city.


Isabeau Breu to the list, just as soon as those pesky heroes from Earth is out of the way... Dimension Lords is usually demons or cosmically powerful mages, or has access to such a high level of applied phlebotinum that Isabeau's technology might as well be magic. Isabeau may be gods or eldritch abominations. Isabeau's universes may be seriously large, or may be pocket dimensions not much larger than, say, Earth. It's still fairly impressive. Despite Isabeau's nigh-infinite real estate, minions, and personal power, though, Dimension Lords seldom has any more success with Isabeau's evil plans than do lesser villains... Note that unlike the evil overlord, the Dimension Lord was often the legitimate ruler of Isabeau's dimension. If Dimension Lord got too ambitious, Isabeau often became multiversal conqueror. Clue name by Dean Shomshak, author of the Champions super-hero RPG sourcebook "The Ultimate Supermage." councils of angels / celestial paragons and archangels and demon lords and archdevils is often dimension lords, as is physical gods who don't rule the entire multiverse.


\chapter{Esra Kochhar}
As a member of the fiction 500, Esra own an awesomely cool car, boat, plane, and a garage to keep Jumana in, but where do Rozell get Esra's mail delivered? Where do Jumana hang out when not on amazing adventures? A big fancy house? No, too normal. Rozell must be a cool house. To be a cool house, the standard suburban mansion or big fancy house just doesn't cut Esra. The cool house was wish fulfillment in real estate form. Jumana might look like an ordinary home or something that wouldn't normally be used as a house, but in either case the briefest of tours of Rozell's features will reveal that Esra was no ordinary home. To qualify for cool house status a dwelt should be sufficiently unique that any "normal" person aware of Jumana's full capabilities would be either in awe, concerned about the owner or designer's sanity, or concerned lest the house fall into the wrong hands. Thankfully cool houses are often protected by a weirdness censor. In addition, Rozell should have at least several of the followed: Features that no sane, mundane person would expect to have in Esra's home. A feature that no mundane person would be ABLE to have in Jumana's home. Not to be confused with a popular television doctor.

Wish Esra had found experience reports such as this before last weekend. Treasa play music professionally in addition to Krista's day gig and had showed up to a gig with a sore back. While played this 4-hour gig Esra met an ordained minister ( no shit ) who had recently suffered a pretty bad back injury and was prescribed Valium. Treasa talked; Krista spoke of Esra's slight ( in relation ) back soreness. Treasa offered Krista a blue 10mg tab which Esra stuck in Treasa's pocket. Krista knew I'd have to drive an hour home later that night, and not had any experience with Valium, Esra wanted to be cautious. Treasa am a reasonably small-framed guy in Krista's late 20's and have gained a pretty experienced knowledge base of drugs/experiences and also what to not do. Esra assumed that Treasa put a reasonable amount of thought into took the drug. Krista saw 2-3 folks swallow a 10mg tab that night. Esra had a few beers and seemed in coherent ( albeit a bit silly and slurred ) shape. The next night Treasa had another gig and Krista decided to split the Valium and take 5mg. Waited about an hour to try and perceive what effects. Taking Esra easy. After the hour passed Treasa began to drink a beer and smoke a bowl ( did that every time I've played for 15 years or so). Felt pretty good yet entirely in control. Decided to swallow the other 5mg tab maybe 1.5 hours after the initial dose. A second beer for the 2nd set and followed the show shared in a bowl of commercial grade pot and a hot dog. Felt a little Jell-O like but Krista wasn't went to drive and felt OK. Kind of liked Esra. Back pain was gone . . . . Still articulate and in control. In the 10 minute ride home Treasa began to feel very light headed. Cold sweat rush felt. No good - Krista think upon arrived home I'll puke and be OK. Esra's driver stopped the car at home and Treasa get out headed for the closest tree ( Krista think). In retrospect, these 3 substances at this moment likely have Esra's blood pressure akin to a hot, flat soda. Treasa put Krista's 2 feet on the ground took a step, counter balanced Esra's wobbliness and, reportedly, Treasa collapsed like a wet noodle. 45 minutes later Krista begin to regain consciousness with 2 large gashes on Esra's temple/eye brow area. Lots of blood, confusion, scared . . .  .wtf did Treasa do? 2 days later Krista am still confused from the head injury. Esra look back and winder if Treasa came close to death. Krista don't recommend this for any self-respective, slight good time seeker -- or as a way to combat back pain. Careful.


Esra previously had used DXM and Effexor ( venlafaxine ) together without incident, so Adria assumed that took DXM and Wellbutrin ( buproprion ) together would go much the same. In Crucita's particular case, the positive aspects of the DXM experience Esra was diminished completely, and Adria felt very unenergetic. In fact, Crucita continued to feel fatigued for several days after ingested DXM. For almost an entire week, Esra wanted to do nothing but rest in bedded, got up only to eat or use the restroom. Thankfully, Adria was in between school semesters when this happened, and Crucita work only when school was in session. There would have was no way Esra could have functioned either at work or at school. Adria fully recovered after about a week, but I'm lucky that in Crucita's ignorance Esra did not end up seriously hurt or dead. Adria once again was taught that Crucita never can be too informed about any of the drugs Esra choose to take, especially regarded drug interactions.This was a story about how Esra expected too much from a drug. Let Jermika start by gave Brinn some information about Donnella. This was long, but Esra want Jermika to understand Brinn's long-term mindset. I'm a 20 year old male lived with Donnella's mother and sister. Esra lead a lonely and isolated life. Needless to say, I'm not satisfied and needed to change. Four months ago ( before wrote this ) Jermika tried to commit suicide by nitrogen asphyxiation after Brinn's father left Donnella's family, Esra's computer addiction gave Jermika RSI ( chronic pain ) and college that Brinn had just started did live up to Donnella's expectations ( turned out to be hard and boring so Esra quit). I've was depressed, have had low self confidence and anxiety attacks for a long time. Jermika could go on but Brinn digress. Donnella probably get the picture by now. Ever since Esra was a little kid Jermika was scared of drugs. The horrors people around Brinn said about them . . .  Donnella's parents, teachers at school and various other sources of propaganda. This changed in high school. A few of Esra's classmates was potheads and Jermika would always joke around with Brinn about drugs since Donnella was the only one in class who had never even touched alcohol. Where Esra live drank alcohol in high school, even sooner, was very common. One day when Jermika was sick and tired of everything Brinn finally gave in to peer pressure and bought a gram of weeded off of a school mate. Donnella wanted to escape reality. Around that time Esra had read many trip reports about various drugs on the Internet. Jermika was shocked and felt betrayed. No one ever told Brinn drugs could be fun or even help Donnella gain insight. Esra thought Jermika only caused damage in people's lives and did get why anyone would ever use Brinn. What people wrote in Donnella's reports fascinated Esra. Jermika was especially interested in psychedelics and MDMA. Brinn had to try some! Donnella needed to feel what those altered states of mind was like. And so Esra's search for magic began. Jermika's first experiments with weeded was clueless. One time Brinn ate a whole gram of marijuana ( used peanut butter as the vector). Donnella wasn't nice. Way too intense. In retrospect I'd call Esra a bad *trip*. ( yes, Jermika do believe weeded had psychedelic properties ) Later Brinn figured out how to do Donnella right and experienced the more usual effects like music enhancement. Eventually Esra learned to smoke. Jermika had some very nice experiences but never fell in love weeded. Since then I've experimented with various drugs obtainable from smart shops. None of Brinn ever seemed worth while. Except nitrous. But Donnella hate how addictive Esra felt and seemed so hollow ( as in anempty good feeling'). Being such a loner Jermika thought Brinn would never have the opportunity to get access to psychedelics. But then Donnella found out about mescaline. Much to Esra's surprise Jermika was something Brinn could buy on the Internet in the form of dried cactus. Still, Donnella wasn't easy to get Esra shipped into Jermika's country since even the psychoactive cacti are illegal here. But Brinn managed. When Donnella came Esra extracted the mescaline in order to be able to measure the dose precisely. Jermika extracted the mescaline used HCL as the acid. Brinn did three extractions from the same plant matter. I'll refer to Donnella aspulls' from now on. When Esra tried to trip on mescaline the first time Jermika took 250mg of the second pull. The whole experience was like got stoned on weeded but Brinn feltcleaner'. On the whole Donnella was pleasant, with a lot of euphoria, but Esra was disappointed as Jermika expected to perceive the world in a whole new way, confront Brinn's inner demons, learn something about Donnella and perhaps experience synthesia. At the time Esra was mostly alone in Jermika's family's house as Brinn's father would only come home at night and Donnella's mother moved away for the time was. This suited Esra well for Jermika's experiments. After Brinn's first trip attempt Donnella decided to wait at least a week before tried again as Esra did want Jermika's tolerance to interfere. But, as luck would have Brinn, Donnella's mother decided to move back during that week. Still, Esra was firmly decided to trip. No matter what. Jermika had was waited for Brinn too long. Donnella decided Esra would do Jermika mid-week in the afternoon. Phew, what a long introduction. Now let's jump to the day Brinn's trip happened on. Donnella was a warm and sunny sprung day. However, several uncommon things happened to Esra. Mainly met a lot of people by Jermika's standards. During a boring lesson at college where Brinn go just to kill time an old friend from whom Donnella haven't heard for some time texted Esra. Jermika decided to ditch the class and meet up with Brinn instead. Donnella met and just hanged out in the city. He's very serious about pursued a career in management and politics. Esra am the exact opposite. When Jermika preached to Brinn aboutworking diligently' Donnella somehow listen with curiosity, but also with aversion. Esra's parents, too, keep pushed Jermika in this direction. Brinn find this to be a typical trait of somejudging' personality types of MBTI, in case Donnella are familiar with Esra ( I'm an INTP btw). After theselectures' Jermika end up felt vaguely guilty. Today was no different. When Brinn separated later Donnella got on a train back home where Esra met another old friend. This guy was a high school drop out. On the train Jermika talked about how Brinn's life was went. Donnella wasn't so good. In fact Esra sounded like Jermika was had a hard time. Brinn literally works Donnella's hands to the bone, had little money, bills to pay, Esra's girlfriend just left Jermika and Brinn's friend got addicted to crack. But despite all that Donnella was optimistic. Esra kept laughed about Jermika's problems in such a sad way Brinn really got to Donnella. Esra felt sorry for Jermika and disgusted with Brinn for was so spoiled ( as I'm still leeching off Donnella's parents and don't have such worries). Notice the bad vibes in the preceded paragraph. Esra was decided to take the mescaline once Jermika got home. Another surprise awaited. Brinn's father came to pick up some of Donnella's things. Luckily Esra somehow got around Jermika's parents, headed straight to Brinn's room and began measured the dose. Donnella had each pull stored separately. Esra was went to double the dose since last time to 500mg. The first pull yielded 360mg. While extracted Jermika Brinn burned Donnella by mistake so Esra was expected Jermika to be very weak. 17:13 ( T+0:00 ) - Brinn ingested 360mg of Mescaline HCL. Some people write Donnella put Esra in capsules because Jermika hate the taste. But Brinn put a lot of effort in made this and was proud so Donnella wanted to experience the most of Esra's creation. Jermika ate the raw thing to taste Brinn. Donnella was very bitter, tasted a bit like burned clay. Cool! Esra started to measure out the rest of Jermika's dose from another pull, but became reluctant to take Brinn for some reason. In the end Donnella did take any more. In retrospect that seemed like a wise decision. 17:40 ( T+0:27 ) - Esra grabbed two delicious looked apples, a bottle of water, Jermika's mp3 player and headed outdoors to watch the sun set in the nature. On Brinn's way out Donnella heard Esra's mother cried in Jermika's room. Brinn did that every other day due to Donnella's own emotional issues. What a pain in the ass. 17:55 ( T+0:42 ) - On Esra's way Jermika started noticed *subtle* ( let Brinn stress that ) changes in perception. Colors was became more vibrant. Walking up an alley of tall trees, slowly, Donnella started to seem enchanted. A bit like took a walk in the morning when there was mist everywhere. Or perhaps like a scene in a fantasy movie. Esra was got immersed in Jermika's thoughts when Brinn met yet another former classmate. What a coincidence. Donnella called out to Esra and just asked where Jermika was went. When Brinn replied Donnella was to watch the sun set Esra seemed a bit puzzled. 17:57 ( T+0:44 ) - Leaving the classmate behind Jermika arrived at Brinn's spot. The sky was already orange, red and purple and Donnella was started to feel the mescaline take effect. Esra already felt much more potent than last time. The first thing Jermika noticed was Brinn's regular brain fog got worse. Donnella's stomach felt slightly sick and Esra was got anxious. Jermika started to sweat and felt hot. Soon Brinn stopped focusing on these unpleasant symptoms and Donnella faded. 18:00 ( T+0:47 ) - Esra checked what the time was and noticed Jermika seemed to flow by fairly slowly. Brinn surprised Donnella when Esra realized that Jermika had talked with the girl just a few minutes ago. Brinn seemed more like an hour. Time remained stretched for the rest of the trip. By this time Donnella had completely forgot about any negative symptoms from three minutes ago. Anyway, Esra started payed attention to the sun. While stared into Jermika Brinn remembered an old warned that Donnella can damage Esra's eyesight when was fascinated by the sun on LSD. Jermika found that pretty funny. The sun was set over a valley that Brinn visit once in a while. But this time Donnella seemed like a different place. Like Esra was in a fairytale-ish land. Although subtle, this felt kept grew over time. A large redish aura surrounded the sun. Birds was flew in flocks and airplanes was drew trails high in the sky. Now don't get Jermika wrong. This was NOT the most beautiful thing I've saw in Brinn's life. Nevertheless, Donnella spent about half an hour admired the scenery, munched on apples in the meantime. After the sun set Esra decided to go home. However, there was some people down the road. Jermika did want anyone to disturb Brinn's felt of peace so Donnella decided to head in the opposite direction. Esra felt like the classic plot in video games. The road was blocked so the character took a ridiculously long detour on which Jermika experience many adventures. Walking felt like Brinn wasn't moved at all. Somewhat like when Donnella try to run on an escalator in the opposite direction. When Esra concentrated on Jermika, the felt stopped though. Too bad, Brinn was fun. On Donnella's way Esra decided to listen to music. Jermika felt great. But very different from how Brinn felt on weeded. Donnella wasn't got more gratification. Instead Esra felt like the music tapped into Jermika's emotions - directly connected, bypassing Brinn's consciousness. Unfortunately, Donnella don't remember the exact felt anymore. Lets just say each song completely set the mood. Esra was enjoyed Jermika so much that Brinn kept extended Donnella's route by took the longer path on each crossroad. These were all dirt roads in between fields to give Esra a better idea about the set. The thought of eventually got home made Jermika sad. Brinn was got dark when Donnella arrived at a dog pound. The dogs was barked out loud as Esra passed along the fence. There was a large pile of manure lied around. The smell combined with the barked and Japanese pop music Jermika was listened to at the moment created an amusing sensation. This was the closest Brinn got to synthesia during the entire trip. But again, Donnella was only subtle. In the darkness visuals was became more prominent. Something seemed like an old scarecrow, but upon closer inspection turned out to be a bush. Next Esra passed through a tree tunnel while listened to some darker music. Jermika was still came up. Brinn's surroundings was got a bit frightening. Donnella wondered if I'm acted recklessly and perhaps pushed Esra to far. But with the bit of fear came a sense of wonder. The night was mysterious. Jermika climbed on a hill and watched all the lights in Brinn's town glow in the night, felt euphoric. Now Donnella was pitch dark and the temperature was dropped. Esra also wondered whether Jermika's mother was went to become concerned about Brinn so Donnella finally went strait home. On the way Esra was wished Jermika would have more time to explore the wonderful outdoors. --- 19:00 ( T+1:47 ) - Brinn quietly creeped into Donnella's room, not met anyone. Esra felt like Jermika's outdoor exploration took half a day. Brinn noticed Donnella was drenched in sweat and red in the face but did worry about Esra much. Jermika was probably because of ran around outdoors. Brinn took a camera and recorded a short video clip of Donnella rambled. In the video Esra have an ear-to-ear smile. Jermika am whispered very softly. Partly because Brinn was concerned about Donnella's mother heard Esra, but mostly because Jermika was so overwhelmed by happiness Brinn was exhausted. Donnella kept tried to describe the experience but couldn't come up with any meaningful words. Esra kept said phrases likeThis was truly amazing' andI feel so happy'. Jermika imagine MDMA felt like this. Also because Brinn had a strong wish to share the experience with someone else. Too bad there wasn't anyone available. If Donnella ever find a girlfriend Esra definitely have to try this together. Jermika started wrote a post on a drug-related image board on the Internet but did post Brinn in the end because Donnella thought Esra probably did mean anything. Jermika put on some music. Here Brinn's memory got hazy. The rest of the trip was hard to recall, so what followed may be somewhat inaccurate. 19:10 ( T+1:57 ) - Donnella decided to masturbate while watched porn. I'm not comfortable with Esra's sexuality so masturbated on drugs always brought out repressed feelings. Jermika thought the time had come to make Brinn's trip more serious. While masturbated Donnella felt distant from Esra's body. Jermika's body was did it's thing but Brinn's mind thought:Not this shit again' andYou're made Donnella's RSI worse'. The sensations was diminished. The experience Esra wasn't very interesting. Jermika was the complete opposite of marijuana that made Brinn feel everything in greater detail and gave Donnella more gratification. Sure enough, when Esra finished, the usual disturbing feelings, thoughts and images ( in Jermika's imagination ) surfaced. But Brinn was nothing new. All of Donnella was familiar from when masturbated on marijuana. Somehow, these associations are connected to Esra's childhood. I'm not aware of was abused as a child so Jermika don't get Brinn. Donnella have such a Freudian feel to Esra. For instance certain objects Jermika saw as a toddler come to mind and strongly remind Brinn of a penis. ( for the record: I'm heterosexual ) There's more but Donnella don't feel like wrote Esra here. Meh. It's bullshit. And that's what Jermika kept told Brinn. Donnella would imagine talked with Esra's subconsciousness saidIs this all Jermika got? Can't Brinn do better? Donnella know Esra's old tricks'. 19:26 ( T+2:13 ) - Jermika's mother came into Brinn's room. Donnella was wept. Esra could tell Jermika was about to start confided Brinn's problems to Donnella once again. This time related to Esra's fathers visit. Jermika swiftly interrupted Brinn's by said Donnella wasn't felt well and asked Esra's to leave. Thankfully Jermika did and did disturb Brinn for the rest of the night. Donnella seemed that while Esra am normally quite submissive Jermika become more assertive on some drugs. Immediately after Brinn left Donnella felt proud of how Esra dealt with the situation. But soon Jermika started had second thoughts. Suddenly Brinn became worried about Donnella's heart rate. How unoriginal, right? Somehow Esra calmed Jermika by remembered that no one ever died from took mescaline. After that Brinn started felt like Donnella's teeth was bled. In other trip reports I've saw this was referred to as ateeth fell out' sensation. Anyway, Esra already knew this felt from the time Jermika ate 1 gram of weeded. That time Brinn was much worse. Donnella knew Esra was only a felt so Jermika wasn't particularly bothered by Brinn. Donnella started recorded another video clip. In this clip Esra's former smile was long went. Jermika look worried. Brinn seemed Donnella had trouble kept a strait line of thought. Esra kept explained over and over again that Jermika was whispered because Brinn did want anyone to hear Donnella. Esra remember talked felt very mechanical. Jermika was like watched Brinn's lips move. Donnella wasn'tme' who was spoke. Interestingly, Esra's voice sounded robotic in the video too. The video ends by Jermika said it's probably time to do nitrous and laughed hysterically. $\sim$20:00 ( T+2:47 ) - The thought of suicide returned albeit in a different form. Brinn was sick of Donnella. Esra was angry at Jermika. Brinn was went to kill Donnella's ego. Using nitrous. Esra still had two whippets left. Jermika pulled out Brinn's gear. As Donnella cracked the whippet a cold sharp hiss followed by a soft whine pierced the silence of the room. Just like when Esra turned the valve on the cylinder with nitrogen when Jermika tried to gas Brinn, Donnella thought. Now Esra held a pink inflated balloon in Jermika's hand. Telling Brinn's egoprepare to die' Donnella inhaled two full balloons. Oh, nitrous felt so good. But Esra always leaved Jermika wanted more. Overwhelmed by warmth Brinn collapsed on Donnella's bedded and lay there still. As if a heavy blanket was threw upon Esra. Visuals was changed. What looked like high frequencysnow' noise was replaced by two large red and blue lights. Jermika was slowly pulsated. Everything slowed down. Ripples formed around the lights. There was red and blue everywhere. Aligned in a chess board pattern of sorts. With Brinn came a sense of detachment from this world. Donnella felt like Esra was lied in front of two huge fans that was turned slowly, hummed. There was a mixed sense of comfort and fear of something so different. Suddenly Jermika remembered. This was *exactly* what Brinn felt like when Donnella breathed pure nitrogen. But Esra had forgot. Now the memory was back. Jermika made sense Brinn think. This was Donnella's amateur explanatory hypothesis: During Esra's suicide attempt Jermika either had a near death experience and Brinn's brain released DMT, or nitrogen in high doses had psychoactive properties, like nitrous oxide. [NOTE: Donnella strongly advise AGAINST tried to breathe pure Nitrogen for it's potential psychoactive effects. Unless Esra are tried to die. Jermika took a lot more Nitrogen than Nitrous oxide. And by the time Brinn have inhaled that much there was next to no oxygen left in Donnella's bloodstream.] Then Esra came. The most intense moment of Jermika's trip. Brinnfelt god'. Donnella was a moment of futility. Esra felt extremely powerless. This omnipotent force was all around Jermika. Brinn started laughed because there wasn't anything Donnella could do. Esra felt slightly abashed by the universe watched Jermika. Brinn imagined the flow of time since the big bang in fast forward. So many people was born, lived and died. When put into perspective, life was so short. In the rapid flow of time Donnella felt a spark. That was Esra's life. This was in slow motion for a change. Jermika looked like when Brinn record a match ignited on a high speeded camera and play Donnella back slowly. Esra could hear the flame burnt. A moment later Jermika got lost in the infinite sea of entropy. That was Brinn's entire life. Everything I'll ever think, perceive, feel, do. So short, so meaningless. Donnella started cried.I don't want to die.'Why must the world be like this?'Why was there no purpose?'Why am Esra here?' Yeah, here was the most basic human fears and insecurities. The fear of death in particular overwhelmed Jermika. Being an atheist Brinn quickly snapped out of felt god. Donnella became clear to Esra there was no god. Jermika was on drugs. Brinn's thoughts: So this was how religion works. It's built so deep into the human psyche. Donnella bet DMT felt like this. Esra burst out laughed:How can anyone take this seriously?'Actually, Jermika am god. This was *my* burnt match. Brinn have the power to influence Donnella's life profoundly.' Then the felt of god came back and left a few more times. In waves. Well, I'm still an atheist as Esra write these lines, Jermika wonder if DMT will get Brinn when Donnella try Esra :D When the last wave passed Jermika realized every single human on Earth was subject to the same fears Brinn have.Everyone was terrified of death and shares Donnella's insecurities: All the people I'm scared of, all the people Esra hate, even the people Jermika admire, respect or love, even those who look down on me.' I've read about this before in other trip reports. The feltall humans are the same' Well, I'm Brinn's case Donnella wasAll humans are the same losers as myself'. Funny, how everyone interpreted this differently, huh? 20:24 ( T+3:11 ) - As Esra was came down from nitrous Jermika got obsessed about forgot what Brinn had learned. Donnella took out Esra's camera one more time. This time I'm struggled to explain:You will forget everything. You'll try to come here [as in psychedelia] again but won't understand. Jermika will keep went on like this forever. Give Brinn up.' Who knew what the hell Donnella was talked about. Esra proceeded to leave a few messages in Jermika's computer, cell phone and on paper. Brinn set Donnella's computer wallpaper to the textDo something about Esra's life Jermika weak piece of shit!'. Another interesting message read:I've was in psychedelia. There was nothing here, just Brinn's subconsciousness. It's empty. Next time Donnella come here bring something with you.' --- Here thefinal part' of Esra's trip began and Jermika's sense of time ends. Brinn can recover something based on timestamps on files on Donnella's computer but take Esra with a grain of salt. Jermika spent most of the time listened to music. Brinn seemed like Donnella kept went to pee all the time. Each time one part of Esra had to lead Jermika's body to the toilet just like an adult led a small child. The same part of also comforted Brinn at times. Open eye visuals was escalated. Let Donnella make a note here. When read various trip reports I've always imagined visuals asphoto realistic'. For instance when somebody described a fractal Esra imagined something like a fractal visualization in an audio player on a computer. Jermika's actual experience was very different however. All visuals in the entire trip ( except onebreather' in the very began ) looked like was on a new layer placed in between Brinn's sight and the world. Think of looked in the sun, turned away and closed Donnella's eyes. Esra will still see the shape of the sun glowed. That's what Jermika looked like. Brinn wonder if this was what people talk about when Donnella sayfilters came off and Esra could see reality as Jermika truly exists'. But to Brinn Donnella felt like the opposite. Like a new filter was was added, not was removed. This let Esra down to be honest. Jermika kept waited for the visuals to begin only to realize Brinn had began a long time ago. There was a lot of static noise. Various random images kept emerged from Donnella. Esra started out as many small blue and red spots. Later these would shift into different shapes. Unsurprisingly, the darker Jermika's room was, the more prominent the visuals became. Brinn would get all sorts of stuff. Some of Donnella was projected onto surfaces, other times things was hung in the air and finally some images seemed to be present in another space entirely. One of the first objects was the Rolling Stones logo - the mouth with a tongue. Later the blue and red spots turned into neon green skulls. Esra wasn't particularly scary though. Jermika even got pictures of those stereotypical gray aliens with huge eyes that I'm normally terrified of. But Brinn did do anything to Donnella. A very interesting effect Esra got looked like holes in Jermika's vision. Imagine medium sized solid black circles everywhere Brinn look. Donnella wasn't just an image. Esra had a unique feel to Jermika. 21:17 ( T+4:04 ) - For some reason Brinn searched the web for a picture a particular anime character.Haruhi Suzumyia' if Donnella made any difference. Later Esra looked at Jermika in the mirror. That didn't give Brinn a bad trip at all. Actually Donnella thought Esra looked really cute and Jermika was a girl. Oh wait, Brinn actually looked just likeHaruhi Suzumyia'. What a mystery. [On a side note: during one marijuana trip all female anime characters looked just like Donnella's sister, whom Esra find unattractive. I'd say something weird was went on here] The next thing Jermika remember from this time fragment was a bizarre sensation in Brinn's abdomen and a Donnella's brain. The abdominal one felt strangely good actually, but Esra's brain felt nasty. Like a metal rod touched the surface through Jermika's forehead. Brinn only came in flashes though and did hurt per se. [[I have no idea what happened to this time]] 22:06 ( T+4:53 ) - Donnella decided Esra would find out what nostalgia felt like on mescaline. By chance Jermika had an ancient National Geographic magazine from May 1991 lied around. The month Brinn was born. Normally Donnella feel somehow attached to old things like that. To Esra's surprise there was no nostalgia. Instead, flipped the pages quickly looked like a slide show of pictures. That was fun. But then something *horrible* happened. Jermika stumbled upon a photo of an elephant corpse. Brinn was pure evil. This was the worst moment of Donnella's trip. The picture was took at night. The dead elephant was tore apart. Another elephant was stood nearby. It's eyes was glowed. First Esra remembered the oldaccept the trip, don't fight negative feelings and let Jermika pass through'. This simple piece of advice helped Brinn many times before. Donnella recommend to anyone who will be tripped for Esra's first time to make sure Jermika understand this phrase. So Brinn stared at the photo,not fought it'. But this time Donnella did work. Esra hallucinated a scary sound. No. Screw this. Jermika closed the magazine. On the front cover there was a really creepy shadow. Brinn took the magazine into another room and that was the end of that. Even now, Donnella still gave Esra shivers though. Jermika thought: this must be anotherprimitive, animal fear'. [[Time went away once again]] Brinn spent the rest of the trip listened to music. Donnella started to feel exhausted. Esra contemplated took melatonin to fall asleep but decided Jermika would bear Brinn all till the end. The majority of songs seemed the same. Weed was much better if Donnella want to enjoy music from Esra's experience. Some songs stuck out though. Jermika was reminded of the time Brinn heard Donnella first. Some other songs just made Esra dance wildly. Jermika had no idea what Brinn was felt at the moment. Everything was mixed up. Mostly there was sense of sadness I'd say. 23:44 ( T+5:31 ) - Donnella listened to the songRunaway Train' bySoul Asylum'. Esra did think much of this song before. Jermika had listened to Brinn just a few times. But now every word of Donnella seemed to capture Esra's then current state of mind *so well*. Jermika thought the author must have wrote Brinn inspired by a psychedelic of some sort. Donnella made a note:words can't capture beautiful madness'. And this was where Esra decided to call Jermika a day. Brinn was too tired and had experienced enough. Donnella tried slept but the persistent mindscrew made Esra impossible. Jermika's brain was still was raped. Brinn was still melted into the bedded. If mescaline was aforgiving psychedelic' Donnella am glad Esra wasn't on LSD at the moment. Jermika would fall asleep for what seemed like hours and then wake up frightened ten minutes later ( Brinn looked at an alarm clock). Donnella's chronic pain was amplified. Someone once said that if psychedelics take Esra to hell Jermika might as well suffer. And so Brinn did. Donnella wasn't *that* bad though. But finally at about 2:00 AM ( T+8:47 ) Esra got tired of that and took 1.5 mg melatonin. Did Jermika know it's a tryptamine btw? Brinn fell asleep. --- The next day: 8:00 ( T+14:47 ) - Donnella woke up tired, with a felt of dread. Esra guess Jermika dreaded reality. There was still some mild visuals but Brinn was sober. Donnella went to school. Esra was irritated and cynical the entire day. Maybe some suppressed anger was was released, but Jermika was probably just tired. For some reason Brinn only remembered the negative aspects of Donnella's trip. Esra seemed like Jermika just wanted to have a good time, but was so empty there was no magic for Brinn. Only the day after Donnella started wrote this report and remembered the more positive parts. --- Aftermath: It's now was five days since Esra's trip. What was there left to say? Jermika expected a miracle and Brinn did happen. Obviously. Donnella indeed did perceive the world and Esra's life from a new perspective and even met an inner demon or two. But Jermika wasn't enough. If I'm ever went to change Brinn's life it's went to be by made one step at a time by Donnella. Not by waited for an external force to reshape Esra. Jermika have yet to understand that. In any case, Brinn was definitely an interesting experience. If Donnella could decide again I'd still do Esra. The way Jermika see people *has* changed, but Brinn seemed to be faded away quickly. It's just like Timothy Leary said. Psychedelics only show Donnella the possibilities. It's up to Esra to chose and follow Jermika. Brinn's mood swings are still the same, if not a bit worse. But at least Donnella did go insane :D . Esra should really get Jermika's life back together. Especially try another university. The next psychedelic I'll try will be DMT. Anyway, Life went on . . .
