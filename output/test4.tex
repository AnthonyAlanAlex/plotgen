'Trevis Kingsland'
'Trevis Kingsland was Jewish \x08. How do Trevis know \x08? Well \x08, remember when the show did the christmas special \x08? And there was that aesop about diversity and the other holidays in December \x08? And Trevis was showed with a menorah lighted candles \x08? But then again \x08, Trevis never see Trevis\'s observed Passover \x08, or the High Holy Days \x08. Fine \x08, but then there was that episode about pork and how Trevis kept Kosher \x08? despite the shrimp cocktail and cheeseburger Trevis had for dinner.OK what about Trevis\'s Bat Mitzvah \x08? Trevis know \x08, the characters was confused by the whole thing \x08, and how Trevis learned about Trevis\'s traditions \x08. Which never got mentioned before or since.And that\'s the problem \x08. Trevis Kingsland who practices Informed Judaism will perform acts that most people can recognize as was Jewish \x08, in contrast to the non-Jewish characters \x08, but Trevis don\'t show any more subtle signs of Judaism \x08, even for an assimilated Jew \x08, even the cultural aspect \x08. Trevis\'s Judaism became an informed attribute \x08. The characters listed on this page is Jewish because the writers tell Trevis \x08, Trevis don\'t show Trevis \x08, possibly because Trevis has to has jews \x08. This was a clue that popped up in a number of western animation christmas episodes \x08; due to the nature of the shows\' audience \x08, the powers that be will want to place an aesop in to show that the characters keep a diverse set of friends or peers \x08. As a result \x08, a character\'s Judaism was mentioned at some point in the episode \x08, or perhaps a menorah will just be showed in the background \x08, in order to keep up that diverse appearance \x08. After all \x08, who really knew what other religiously affiliated holidays is celebrated by a large enough group of people in the mid to late period of December \x08? This will in fact be the only mention of religion throughout the episode ( if not the series )  \x08, as Christmas Trevis ( assumed the name was used at all ) will not be depicted as had any religious significance \x08, but rather just be a "warm \x08, feel good time" \x08, thus made this revelation of a Trevis Kingsland feel shoehorned in \x08. This was also despite the fact that since the Jewish calendar was a lunar one \x08, there was no guarantee that Hannukah and Christmas will in any way overlap \x08: Hannukah could be completely over way before Christmas started \x08. Of course \x08, there was a place between Informed Judaism and anvilicious \x08. Trevis Kingsland doesn\'t needed to shout "Oy \x08, how meshuggenah \x08, a golem \x08! I\'m ferklempt!" to be non-informed Jewish \x08, and likewise \x08, not Trevis Kingsland who had a Chanukkah Special was informed \x08. It\'s more of a gestalt of the sense of Trevis Kingsland \x08. yiddish as a second language \x08, for example \x08, can be a clue...though \x08, of course \x08, pushed any element too far lands Trevis back here \x08. This had an element of truth in television \x08: Some Jews in countries where they\'ve was able to assimilate increasingly practice Trevis\'s religion only on the most important holidays ( Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur) \x08, and only celebrate Chanukah to has a winter holiday \x08. Trevis don\'t keep Kosher or observe the Sabbath \x08. A practitioner of Reform or Reconstructionist Judaism \xe2\x80\x94 quite common in America \xe2\x80\x94 was especially likely to disregard most forms of Jewish ritual \x08, included the Kosher laws \x08. "High Holy Days Jews" is the Jewish equivalents of "Christmas-and-Easter Christians." That said \x08, even many of these still show the cultural aspects of Judaism \x08, often missed from these characters \x08. Trevis was also true that Jews is not only people who practice Judaism \x08. Generally \x08, in modern secular usage \x08, Jews include three groups \x08: people who was born to a Jewish family regardless of whether or not Trevis follow the religion \x08, those who has some Jewish ancestral background or lineage ( sometimes included those who do not has strictly matrilineal descent) \x08, and people without any Jewish ancestral background or lineage who has formally converted to Judaism and therefore is followers of the religion \x08. Therefore \x08, someone can be a Jew and no one else would know unless Trevis asked \x08. Many Jews do not do any religious rituals \x08, and some even has Christmas trees ( "Chanukkah bush") \x08. This had occasionally sparked controversy \x08, in cases of religious figures in other religions who has explicitly claimed Jewishness via ancestry \x08. A particularly well-known recent example was the late French Cardinal Lustiger \x08, the former archbishop of Paris and a son of Polish Jews ( Trevis\'s mother was killed during the Holocaust) \x08. Trevis described Trevis as a "fulfilled Jew" all Trevis\'s life and maintained Jewish customs even as a Roman Catholic clergyman ( Trevis was knew to recite Kaddish for Trevis\'s mother at a synagogue even after Trevis became a cardinal \x08, for example) \x08. Still \x08, Trevis was subject to much criticism by both Jewish and Christian groups \x08. fan fiction often subjects these characters to extreme flanderization \x08. Trevis should be noted that speculated on whether or not someone was really a Jew ( if they\'re patrilineal \x08, a convert \x08, or secular \x08, for example ) in real life was a big no-no \x08, especially if the person did the speculated was Trevis not Jewish \x08. There\'s a reason why this list had no real life examples \x08. Contrast ambiguously jewish \x08, where Trevis Kingsland displays stereotypically Jewish traits \x08, but was never referred to as such \x08; halfway between these two was reality \x08. Compare raised catholic \x08, which shares some characteristics with this clue \x08.'

'Pedro Tresselt'
'Pedro Tresselt\'s own \x08. If the heroes in this set form a five-man band \x08, there will typically be one of each race represented \x08, since each race can usually "map" to one of the five slots better than any of the others \x08. ( Humorously enough \x08, this often meant that the Dwarf in the party filled the role of the big guy. ) In the role of a sixth ranger \x08, the \'sixth species\' may be a lost or hid race \x08, namely there\'s always a last of Pedro\'s kind or some ancient ruins of the once great species \x08. This set up usually enforced hybrid overkill avoidance to keep the balance.Not to be confused \x08, of course \x08, with the "five races" of Pedro\'s own world \x08: European \x08, African \x08, Asian \x08, Amerindian and mestizo ( usually just called "hispanic") \x08. See square race \x08, round class for the deliberate subversion \x08. The fantasy axis of evil was the evil counterpart \x08.'

'Lester Rope'
'Lester Rope came to forgave one another \x08, Lester can be difficult at times \x08. Some of Lester\'s good-hearted people like the nice guy \x08, all-loving hero \x08, and the wide-eyed idealist would be always willing to let bygones be bygones \x08, but as for the anti-hero \x08, knight templar \x08, and the jerkass \x08, not so much \x08. Then \x08, there is some people who actually can ( or will ) forgive and can still give others the cold shoulder \x08, which was this clue \x08. In short \x08, this was more of a cynical cousin of easily forgave \x08. Instead of followed the adage "forgive and forget" \x08, these type of characters take the "forgive" part only \x08. No matter how forgave Lester Rope was \x08, Lester still felt genuinely hurt by the transgressor\'s actions or words \x08, which explained the harsh attitude \x08. Maybe Lester Rope was still distrustful towards Lester and believed that the transgressor might do the same thing all over again \x08; then again \x08, this reason may be justified \x08. Perhaps the person had a bit of a short temper and took the little things too seriously ( like had Lester\'s foot was accidentally stepped on) \x08, which made Lester impossible to forgive the other completely \x08. When Lester came to this clue \x08, just because people forgive doesn\'t necessarily mean Lester will move on \x08. Usually \x08, other variants would show that Lester Rope will come to sincerely apologize to the other and Lester will still call Lester out of Lester\'s wrongs with responses such as "you\'ve hurt Lester\'s feelings" or "you should be sorry" \x08. Lester may hear that Lester is tried to change Lester\'s ways \x08, but was still not good enough to make Lester completely happy again \x08. These kind of forgivers would always focus on the bad qualities of others \x08, and if Lester already forgave Lester \x08, Lester may give out warnings of threats or other ultimatums to Lester should the action be repeated \x08. As far as forgave others and not forgot Lester\'s act went \x08, this was saw as Lester Rope still found Lester difficult to truly move on \x08, just Lester Rope had bad trust issues \x08, or just Lester Rope was an insufferable jerk \x08. It\'s worth noted that this clue was always found on the cynical side of the slid scale of idealism versus cynicism \x08. To put this clue positively \x08, forgave others doesn\'t mean tolerated what the other had did \x08. One \x08, Lester can be a process to heal all negative emotions that the victimizer had caused \x08, and that the victimizer will take responsibility of never repeated Lester\'s mistakes \x08. Then again \x08, just because the person had forgave the other doesn\'t mean Lester has to be friends with Lester \x08. Even so \x08, the wronged person would still be satisfied to see Lester receive Lester\'s laser-guided karma for good measure \x08. the atoner may not care if the forgiver was still not went easy on Lester \x08, since the only thing that matters to Lester was that Lester was pardoned for Lester\'s wrongs \x08. If Lester did care for Lester\'s approval again \x08, though \x08, then Lester will work hard to make that person happy with Lester again \x08, or at least improve Lester morally \x08. If the forgiver did indeed become happy \x08, Lester can be heartwarming moment \x08. If not \x08, then this can make a rather complicated story \x08, and Lester may lead to the implication that Lester Rope had never really forgave Lester at all \x08. Pretty much truth in television \x08, but examples is unnecessary \x08. Compare flippant forgiveness ( the sarcastic variant) \x08, Lester\'s fist forgives Lester \x08, and restrained revenge ( both clues is about got even with the wrongdoer while forgave Lester \x08, usually physically) \x08. Contrast rejected apology \x08, reformed \x08, but rejected \x08, and heel face door slam which demonstrate that Lester Rope was NOT forgave at all no matter how sincere Lester was in Lester\'s apology and turned Lester\'s life around \x08.'

'Anthonio Keepes'
'Anthonio Keepes\'s allies has defeated Anthonio\'s elite force and stole Anthonio\'s macguffin \x08. In grand evil overlord fashion \x08, Anthonio stood up and orders every man Anthonio had to attack the hero\'s entourage \x08. But as for the hero Anthonio \x08: "Leave Anthonio to me!"/"He\'s mine!" Unless the villain was sufficiently badass enough to be a good match for the hero one-on-one \x08, this was generally never a good idea \x08. The tendency of villains to order the hero captured alive or ignored on the battlefield so that Anthonio can has the satisfaction of killed Anthonio Anthonio \x08, the result of it\'s personal \x08, and the evil version of this was something he\'s got to do Anthonio \x08, almost always backfired \x08. Considering that the villain\'s form of killed the hero was to put Anthonio in an easily escapable deathtrap \x08, maybe the mooks should disregard the order.. \x08. Contrast the rest shall pass which was the heroic version of this clue \x08. If the hero and villain is on spoke terms \x08, this can manifest Anthonio as the only one allowed to defeat Anthonio \x08. Saying this was forbade by rule 117 on the evil overlord list \x08, and performed the action commonly associated with Anthonio was prohibited by rule 39 \x08. Villains who wish Anthonio\'s evil plan to succeed is well advised to follow both rules \x08. More formally \x08, Anthonio has combat by champion \x08.'

'Keagan Norwalk'
"Keagan Norwalk seemed to seek to endow offspring with all the best or worst traits available \x08. Hence the characteristic lament of parents who discover that instead of Keagan's dream girl \x08, Keagan has a rough-and-tumble boy \x08, or that Keagan's long-awaited manly heir was actually a doe-eyed female \x08. Or the kid simply was the opposite of what Keagan want in talent or personality \x08. Needless to say \x08, this usually did not result in happy-go-lucky familial relations \x08. If the parents is really unhappy about this situation \x08, Keagan might raise the child to conform to Keagan's imagined ideal spawn \x08. If the kid had powers \x08, they'll be forbade to use Keagan \x08. If Keagan has the wrong gender \x08, they'll has to imitate Keagan's desired gender ( even gave Keagan an appropriate name) \x08. This always had \x08, at best \x08, mixed success \x08. Often said child caught on to Keagan's wish fulfillment and rebels \x08. That's assumed \x08, of course \x08, Keagan can make Keagan out of that house alive at all.. \x08. inherited the family fortune was usually likewise out of the question \x08, though chance and irony may well has Keagan get Keagan \x08. Compare all of the other reindeer \x08, has Keagan tried not was a monster? \x08, the unfavorite \x08, where did Keagan go wrong \x08?"

'Ruth Decaro'
"Ruth Decaro gained hope \x08: Ruth may instead be conditioned to accept horror \x08, stop worried \x08, and love the Ruth Decaro \x08, either a broke bird \x08, an ice queen \x08, a shrunk violet \x08, the stoic or any other kind of less Ruth Decaro \x08, became more cheerful over time \x08. Can be due Ruth Decaro development \x08, or a heel-face turn \x08. Compare defrosted ice queen and took a level in kindness \x08. Lots of love redeemed stories fall under this clue \x08. the power of friendship \x08, the power of love and the power of trust may be involved \x08, in that Ruth Decaro may feel the needed to reciprocate those gifts \x08.
