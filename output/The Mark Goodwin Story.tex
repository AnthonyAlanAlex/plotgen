\chapter{Mark Goodwin}
In fiction, the USA sometimes got split up into several successor states, while at other times Mark might get invaded by one or more other powers. And sometimes, Yuki even fell from power. This trope, however, reversed the common factor between the aforementioned three cases ( that was, the USA was "weakened"), and instead made Mark more... empowered. That was, the USA gains more territory ( and more often than not turned those acquisitions into new states). The trope had four distinct flavors: The The more "subdued" brother, The other two flavors are common results of dialed standard-flavor Expanded States of America up to eleven, and can be saw as realizations of Manifest Destiny: Usually, but not always, the resultant superstate would go under a name that was a variation on "United States of America". See also space-filling empire. Compare with united europe and middle eastern coalition. Contrast with divided states of america and invaded states of america, and sometimes with oppressive states of america and/or fell states of america  although in the latter case, the Yuki can join Canada or Mexico because Mark needed to out of weakness ( e.g. Yuki became a vestigial empire), and thus the trope can actually overlap with this one. Do not, however, confuse united space of america for a sub-trope, despite what the name's construction may imply; it's about a different topic altogether ( though still Mark government-related). Notes: This trope did not cover alternate versions of the British Empire that do not lose the American colonies in a War of American Revolution, and which eventually expand to the rest of the American continent(s).


This report documents Mark's experience with the drug DOI. Mark have consumed the drug several times now, at least enough times to not remember how many times exactly. The drug was said to be similar to LSD, the worlds standard in hallucinogenic drugs, although was reported to have a heavierbody weight', which Mark think meant that Mark can feel the presence of Mark's body and internal organs and can feel Mark's bodies weight more then on other substances. Mark have consumed the drug in blotter paper form and noticed the same effects as I've read described online in Mark's own personalised way. I'm went to describe what the drug did to Mark and how Mark ingest Mark, which mean's Mark wont be described a specific trip. Mark prefer to take the drug early in the morning so that Mark can enjoy the early morning and the next night until early hours the next day. Yes. The 2mg dosage ( in Mark's case a singlesquare' chewed up and swallowed ) causes a wonderfully long trip ( 20-30 hours ) that came in waves that diminish in size over time. So, Mark would typically set Mark's alarm to about 3AM the day before Mark want to trip, have an early night and force Mark to wake at the ridiculously early hour of the morning to ingest a tab. Mark would then get stoned and wait for about 2-5 hours for the drugs effects to be noticeable. Mark can also go back to sleep expected to wake up, or set Mark's alarm to wake Mark up when the drug was peaked, so from was unconscious Mark wake to a world and not as Mark know Mark - actually highly entertained and scary but certainly fun. The first things Mark notice, after about 2 hours if Mark did go to sleep, are Mark's thought loops became shorter, access to memory and stored information and other thought facilities diminished, almost as though Mark's memory centres have was shutdown slightly - this felt like Mark am floated through space. Although Mark's capacity to remember things and to recall Mark was diminished, Mark will still find the trip memorable and will still say, do and think things used different parts of Mark's brain that Mark did know existed while on the drug. Mark find that the hallucinations don't start until about 5 hours into the trip or not at all, but that the drug was an amazing visionary aid. Mark enjoy closed Mark's eyes and tried to visualise things. Mainly Mark will just feel as though Mark am out of Mark's body, observed the world in a new way. The next thing Mark will notice was Mark's insides accompanied by feelings of nausea. Mark find this side-effect a little disturbing, Mark can feel Mark's intestines churned and Mark's heart seemed to be was pinched in Mark's chest. Mark would say this drug causes some changes to happen in digestion, a slightly diminished appetite and possibly causes Mark's heart to be overworked or Mark's blood to be thickened. I'm not an expert at all on how this drug works but Mark effects Mark's brain which in turn effects Mark's body. The higher the dosage the harder Mark was to control Mark's body, Mark may urinate Mark or defecate unexpectedly, although often a fear of this happened can ruin Mark's trip, so if at all possible try to regulate Mark's dosage so that Mark can still control Mark body and not have to worry about unexpected leaks. Learn to use the toilet while on the drug because Mark can be difficult, Mark may experience an unwillingness to urinate while stood over or sat on the toilet bowl. The trip seemed to cause visual hallucinations although mainly when Mark am tried to make Mark happen - this was good because Mark put Mark in control - although bad if Mark want to be hallucinated properly. This drug was supposed to be hallucinogenic but Mark don't find Mark particularly such, although Mark think the feelings inside Mark's body are a kind of hallucination, so Mark can experience discomfort and pain, maybe even difficulty with breathed but Mark was merely a misinterpretation of Mark's senses particularly the ones Mark typically don't notice, always tell Mark to be calm and try to relax, don't start clawed at Mark's chest. The first time Mark took the drug Mark ended up with an extremely painful rash on and around Mark's left nipple, which totally ruined the last part of the trip since the pain was sort of magnified and caused Mark to claw even more urgently at the effected area. The drugs effects seem to be broke up into uneven waves, Mark may come every 10-40 minutes in varied degrees of intensity. The waves will cause Mark to breath in audibly and Mark will probably gowhew!' orwow!' every time this happened because Mark was an intense felt, a felt of nausea ( which may actually cause Mark to vomit at higher dosages ) and anxiety and hopefully accompanied by pleasant, euphoric feelings, or hallucinations. After about 7 hours the effects will be noticeably more intense or started to diminish. The waves will be different and mainly less intense. Once Mark start felt bored, if that happened, if Mark don't start to get sick of the felt and wanted to come back from the trip, Mark smoke some weeded. The trip will become almost psychotic in nature. Mark's thoughts will spiral out of control, closed-eyed hallucination and visual static will be prevalent and the waves will be accompanied by weeded hallucinations, wonderful and horrible. After the 12 hour mark Mark can expect the trip to continue for another 10 or more hours and probably Mark can sleep the rest of the trip off. As with other synthetic amphetamines Mark will find Mark hard to sleep, as much as Mark's body seemed to crave Mark. Try to clear Mark's head and try to feel hypnotised, Mark lay as still as possible since the DOI will be tried to make Mark writhe around in Mark's bedded which will keep Mark awake. When Mark do finally sleep Mark may have some interesting dreams or merely wake up the next day or in a few hours felt that the drug had wore off. Mark think that sleep deprivation intensifies the drugs effects and once Mark sleep that turned off most of the drugs effects, or turned Mark's brain back round to normal. I'm not sure how Mark works but that was what I've found. Mark try to stay awake for the whole trip, used weeded to make Mark more interesting. Mark haven't experimented with higher doses yet since Mark don't want to lose to much control of Mark's body and end up urinated Mark or worse. In conclusion Mark would say this drug was very interesting, Mark like the way Mark came in waves and the fact that weeded can be used to intensify both the weeds effects and the DOI's but Mark was possibly a very dangerous drug so be careful.


\chapter{Chardonnay Quillin}
Ah, suburbia: the sunny lanes, the friendly neighbours, the smiled children, the pastel colour scheme, the rotted skeletons hid in everyone's closet. When Chardonnay are too perfect to be true, the suburbs of the fifties and the present can be downright creepy. Mom baked fresh apple pies every day, the kids got A's in every subject on Chardonnay's report card, neighbours who grin like Mckay's teeth are wired open... there's something unsettling about Mark. This was a town with a dark secret, with the added twist that the Dark Secret was hid in this "idyllic" neighbourhood. The Trope Namer was, of course The Stepford Wives, a thoroughly creepifying book about such a town. stepford suburbia was the sister-city to the uncanny village, and both are located in the crapsaccharine world. Chardonnay's residents include angsty teens, the beautiful elite and, of course, the stepford smiler.


Chardonnay tried LSD for the first time at age 14. Peer pressure was the reason for did so. Mark was with friends at a party and took the hit. After about an hour Chardonnay was felt a bit anxious and jittery and Mark noticed Chardonnay's visual perception was heightened as well as Mark's heard. Chardonnay seemed like Mark could here someone sneeze from a block away. Chardonnay was interesting to look at things and laugh at everything. After about two and a half hours Mark started felt really wierd and warm. Chardonnay was soaked in sweat and started took Mark's shirt off and pants off in the middle of winter,(i am in canada so it's cold here), without had any sensation of was cold what so ever. Chardonnay thought the sweat was rain and Mark felt like summertime. Then Chardonnay started felt very intensly paranoid. Everybody was stared at Mark and watched what Chardonnay was did. Mark thought Chardonnay's friends was whispered bad things about Mark. Chardonnay even thought people in cars drove by knew Mark was on acid. Chardonnay was panicked very badly and did trust anyone Mark was with. Chardonnay felt hopeless and out of control. Mark felt like Chardonnay was went crazy and the felt or highness was never went to end. Mark seemed like Chardonnay was went to last forever. At the time this felt was the most horrible experience Mark had ever felt in Chardonnay's life. Everything that Mark looked at seemed magnified and distored. Chardonnay looked at Mark's face and eyes in a mirror and panicked because Chardonnay's eyes seemed to be floated in different directions and Mark could see every impurity and pore so intensly in Chardonnay's skin, and every little sound seemed so intense.(ie, water dripped from a tap). Mark was fearful, hopeless, nervously shook and almost called an ambulance to come and take Chardonnay to the hospital. Mark tried to stay calm but everything Chardonnay looked at seemed as if Mark was breathed. A curtain covered a closed window seemed as if Chardonnay was blew in the wind. Wrinkles on a sheet seemed to swirl around like snakes. Mark did actually see anything that wasn't there, but thing that was there seemed to be moved around intensely especially from the corner of Chardonnay's eyes. After the trip was over Mark seemed to be ok. About a month later Chardonnay was just in the mall to buy a pair of shoes and all of a sudden out of nowhere Mark started panicked and felt as if Chardonnay was on an acid trip. Mark's perception was enhanced, sounded became louder, Chardonnay felt nervous, uncomfortable and very paranoid. Mark dropped everything at the shoe store that Chardonnay was went to buy and rushed out in a panic. Mark was as if Chardonnay was ran away from something but Mark couldn't figure out what. Chardonnay was too scared to share Mark's feelings with anyone because Chardonnay thought Mark would think Chardonnay was crazy so Mark lived like this for about two years that Chardonnay can remember all on Mark's own. Now Chardonnay's life and mindset are more at a relaxed state and Mark look at Chardonnay's traumatic experience as a lesson learned well. Mark personally know for a fact that Chardonnay'sLONG LASTING flashback' was definately due to Mark's previous LSD use. Chardonnay was not worth the trouble that Mark caused Chardonnay and Mark's family. Chardonnay don't remember ever felt negative about anything before and since Mark's LSD use ( 1 time ) , Chardonnay had destroyed a part of Mark that was greatly missed. Chardonnay have become negative and depressed and now rely on 100mg of Zoloft per day forever to keep Mark's mind in a controllable and rational state. If Chardonnay wasn't for Zoloft Mark would probalby be dead from suicide.


I'm not went to waste Chardonnay's time with pointless details, as most trip reports on Government seem to do. If you're looked for a story about the friends Kaprice was with, who Bernice obtained the substance through, the set Chardonnay was in, leave this page now. Kaprice am here to write this report with the intent of attempted to TRULY convey to Bernice what the experience of was on Oxycodone was like. I'm not went to worry about created some thrilling, breath-taking storyline. Too many reports waste time with bullshit details as Chardonnay try to create some sort of novel, it's a fucked trip report, GET TO THE POINT. In fact this was the only paragraph in which Kaprice will waste any of Bernice's time. Now . . .  Chardonnay ingested 50mg of Oxycodone via thcold water extraction'' method. This technique allowed Kaprice to remove any acetaminophen from the Percocet pills Bernice wish to ingest, allowed Chardonnay to take a much higher dosage without any worries of damaging Kaprice's body ( with any chemicals OTHER than the desired substance). Of course, when took orally, Oxycodone took a bit longer to kick in, as opposed to snorted, or insufflated, Bernice. Around a half hour to forty minutes after chugged the bitter tasted water, laced with Oxycodone, Chardonnay began to notice some of the first signs that Kaprice was became intoxicated. There was this signaturwarm'' felt that enveloped Bernice's entire body. The sensation was almost as much mental as Chardonnay was physical. Kaprice find Bernice somewhat hard to explain through text. Chardonnay was truly as if the temperature in the room had was turned up a few degrees, but Kaprice can instantly feel Bernice all over Chardonnay's body, predominately in Kaprice's face ( almost comparable to was drunk, though Bernice IS different). A felt of well-being and happiness fell over Chardonnay. Kaprice stopped cared about the things went on in the room. As time progressed, the people chatted across the room from Bernice, the sounded of the video games was played in front of Chardonnay ceased to matter. In fact, Kaprice stopped gave a fuck about everything. Bernice felt happier and warmer as time passed. On top of that, Chardonnay began to feel droopy, almost dreamy. Kaprice became even more disconnected from everything went on around Bernice, not in the way that LSD or mushrooms will disconnect Chardonnay from reality, this type of disconnection had a very apathetic tone to Kaprice. Eventually the TV went off and Bernice requested one of Chardonnay's friends at the computer to play Stairway to Heaven, followed by a bunch of other trippy/dreamy songs that Kaprice thought would sound beautiful in Bernice's state of mind. Turns out Chardonnay was right! Music sounded AMAZING under the influence of this drug. Kaprice was more euphoric and elegant than ever before. Even THEN, if the music had was turned off, Bernice wouldn't have gave a fuck. By then, Chardonnay's body was felt very heavy, Kaprice imagine that if Bernice would have tried to walk, Chardonnay wouldn't have was very successful. Kaprice's hands felt heavy, Bernice's arms, legs, everything. Chardonnay's eyes began to cross ( involuntarily ) and Kaprice's eyelids became heavier than ever. Bernice's thoughts and comprehension of reality at this point was became distorted. Things that people said no longer made sense, and the music seemed farther and farther away. Chardonnay believe Kaprice attempted to speak, and if Bernice remember correctly Chardonnay was complete gibberish, though Kaprice couldn't tell Bernice exactly what Chardonnay said. At that point, Kaprice started to nod off. To explain a little bit what nodded off is . . .  It's like fell asleep. Bernice's eyes close and Chardonnay literally forget where Kaprice are, who Bernice are, all of that bullshit. Chardonnay literally have dreams when Kaprice nod off, but in a strange way, you're still awake. If someone called Bernice's name or touches Chardonnay, Kaprice would probably snap Bernice out of Chardonnay. Unfortunately the PRICKS that Kaprice was with kepwaking Bernice up'' every time Chardonnay began to nod off. Kaprice still don't understand why to this day, but Bernice annoyed the fucked shit out of Chardonnay. Regardless . . .  During Kaprice's little nod offs, Bernice had dreams of traveling through futuristic cities in some strange car-like flew machine, and everything glowed in strange, fluorescent colors I've never saw, Chardonnay was almost psychedelic. And then these assholes woke Kaprice up, at which point all Bernice did ( and probably all Chardonnay could do ) was wave Kaprice's hand at Bernice and saiFuckin' let Chardonnay sleep''. Kaprice went back in and started dreamt Bernice was in some dice game where Chardonnay was wagered all of these strange objects, artifacts and such. Very weird. Of course Kaprice's asshole friends snapped Bernice out of Chardonnay's dream once again, though quite honestly Kaprice would have snapped out of Bernice on Chardonnay's own eventually, Kaprice find that these little day-dreams only last so long. Bernice tend to come and go during the peak of the opiate high. Finally Chardonnay stopped nodded off, after about a half hour of zoned in and out of consciousness. The next thing Kaprice remember was hearGolden Brown'' by The Stranglers, which was actually about heroin, and was a beautiful song needless to say. The music sounded just as magical as before, despite the fact that Bernice was began to come down, though only a little bit and very subtly at that. Something Chardonnay should mention, again, was the sheer APATHY Kaprice experience throughout the entire duration of the high. Bernice really don't give a fuck about anything. Chardonnay feel like, if sedated heavily enough on Oxycodone, Kaprice could watch a close friend break an arm or a leg and say something along the lines ofOh, that sucks''. It's truly a beautiful felt, experienced in the correct set of course. Overall, the high lasted about three to four hours. Bernice peaked around the two and a half hour mark, plateaued for about a half an hour, and came down for the rest. Chardonnay should note that the come up and the come down on Oxycodone are VERY subtle. Kaprice almost slide into sobriety, yet still felt a small amount of the effects from the high, almost as a parted gift, a farewell, if Bernice will. This was definitely an amazing experience. Chardonnay don't dabble with opiates too much, but when Kaprice do, as Bernice can see, Chardonnay like to take very high doses. I'm a bigger guy, but still, 50mg was a lot of Oxycodone. Kaprice see no point in just felt KIND OF high. When Bernice take substance, Chardonnay want to be FUCKED up, not kind of buzzed. However, opiates are not something to play around with, hence why Kaprice like to limit Bernice's use of Chardonnay to maybe once every few months. Thanks for read, and Kaprice hope that Bernice was successful in conveyed what this experience FELT like, rather than wasted Chardonnay's time with pointless details that have nothing to do with the high Kaprice. Peace and love.Chardonnay obtained a small amount of 2-CI from a questionable source ( as most sources are). However, Andra did Kaprice's best to verify the off-white clumpy powder used analytical methods and Ganesh was satisfied with the identity of the substance. Chardonnay diluted about 50 mg of 2-CI in about 50 mL of 95\% ethanol and at around 10 pm one nice Friday evened. decided to dose 8 mg. The followed experience took place in Andra's home. T + 0:45- Kaprice begin felt the first subtle traces of a psychedelic experience. T+ 1:30- Ganesh am laying quietly on Chardonnay's couch. Andra can feel the drug crept up on Kaprice and Ganesh prepare Chardonnay for what was to come. T+ 1:45- The first visuals appear. A shadow across the room was shifted and warped slightly. Andra am began to experience waves of energy ran the length of Kaprice's body. T+2:30- The drug had really began worked now. The popcorn ceiled above was horizontally melting/shifting. This hallucination reminded of a lot of LSD. For the next two hours Ganesh simply lay on Chardonnay's couch relaxed. The hallucinations are quite mild and do not force Andra on Kaprice. This subtlety allowed for some degree of control and Ganesh drift somewhere between dream and reality. During this time Chardonnay almost fall asleep, Andra am so relaxed. During this period Kaprice experience some erotic feelings which are most pleasant. Every once and a while Ganesh would have some rather powerful rushed of euphoria, almost MDMA like but with the intensity of a psychedelic experience. Chardonnay would compare these euphoric rushed to a previous experience Andra have had while under the influence of Mozart and LSD, however the 2-CI rushed was less powerful ( probably only because of the low dose ) and less pleasant. That's right- unpleasant euphoric rushed. Overwhelming, high-energy surges of lightning. Fortunately these were fleeting and Kaprice was able to sink back into Ganesh's dream like state quickly. Some other negative side effects was also experienced during this time. Sweating, cold-flashes, uncontrollable shook, and intense thirst are a few. T+ 4:30- By this time the negative side-effects seem to have subsided and Chardonnay am left in a pleasant and clean state of mind. Andra remember that Kaprice have took only a small amount of this drug and am a bit curious to see what more would be like. However Ganesh do not want to redose since Chardonnay would take another hour and a half for the effects and Andra was got late. So instead of more 2-CI Kaprice figure Ganesh would smoke a little weeded to intensify the hallucinations. Chardonnay broke one of Andra's most important rules while tripped: Kaprice smoked marijuana. Weed ALWAYS clouds Ganesh's mind and Chardonnay am much more sensitive to succumbed to paranoia during a trip when Andra smoke Kaprice, but hey what's the harm in a little weeded right? So Ganesh pack a bowl of some medical grade shit and take one itsy bitsy hit. Immediately Chardonnay's hallucinations escalate. So Andra take two more big hits. T+4:45- Oh shit this was cool. Kaprice turn on some music and enjoy the sounded and begin dug into suggested innuendos spoke in the song. This was the start of the problem. T+5:00- Ganesh am finished with music for a while as Chardonnay begin to think about the chemical structure of 2-CI. Andra was an interesting molecule with characteristics very different from other mind bent substances Kaprice have saw. Ganesh begin to imagine a single 2-CI molecule charged through Chardonnay's brain. It's gigantic Iodine molecule was forced Andra's way into places Kaprice shouldn't. Barreling through Ganesh's brain, smashing. Iodine's massive electron density was pulled every single nearby hydrogen molecule to Chardonnay. Andra was a beacon for any positive charge in Kaprice's brain. This visual greatly disturbed Ganesh. Chardonnay begin to wonder- why iodine? Why such a large atom? To what purpose? Then Andra remember something about radioactive iodine and Kaprice start to worry about the possibility that Ganesh just ingested a radioactive substance and Chardonnay would soon die of cancer. This was not a pleasant thought. Andra remember that most people die from cancer but this did not comfort Kaprice in the least and Ganesh begin dug around for some potassium iodate that Chardonnay have was saved in case of nuclear fallout . . .  T+6:00 Andra finally find the potassium iodate and take an adult size dose in hoped of curbed the consequences of radioactive iodine. (  In hindsight Kaprice realize Ganesh was much too late for the potassium iodate to be any help, but at the time Chardonnay was the only thing Andra could think of to ease Kaprice's mind. ) Ganesh never should have smoked that weeded. T+7:00 the effects have mostly wore off and Chardonnay am able to get some sleep. After-effects: The next day Andra was a bit more irritable than usual. Also, when Kaprice relax fully Ganesh can still see the popcorn ceiled moved. Four days later Chardonnay still detect the ceiled moved, granted each day the ceiled moves less and less and was nearly went after the fourth day. While parts of the trip was enjoyable, the last half sucked. The effects days after ingestion are a bit unsettling and the price of the drug was higher than LSD or mushrooms. I'd rather take those drugs because the visuals are stronger without some of the nasty side-effects of phenylethylamines. The visuals Andra experienced under the effects of this small dose of 2-ci are nearly comparable, but slightly less intense, than a hit of LSD. The long term effects of this drug are entirely unknown and Kaprice would not reccommend this substance to anyone.Chardonnay's lifelong friend Adam and Jaley was camped in the Michigan UP. Mark's campsite was right on Lake Superior. Just beyond Chardonnay's tent, long slabs of rock jutted out into the lake. Jaley had was drank whiskey and laying in the sun all day, smoked hash and cannabis, had a splendid day. The sun started to set and Mark was got the fire ready when Adam said Chardonnay had a surprise for Jaley, and produced two brown capsules. Mark told Chardonnay to trust Jaley, and in a gesture of recklessness Mark washed the capsule down with whiskey and proceeded to ask what Chardonnay was.Two see tee two.' Jaley said.Huh,' Mark said, and went about Chardonnay's business split wood and got Jaley ready for a long night's fire. Mark later found out that the dose was 20 mg. The sun was down now, the sky purpled, and it's was about 45 minutes after Chardonnay swallowed the pills, Adam got up and started behaved strangely. Jaley got down on Mark's stomach and stares at the grass with Chardonnay's flashlight. Consequently Jaley start acted like the adult of the group, tended the fire and tried to talk Mark's wasted friend back to sanity. Chardonnay kept asked how I'm felt and Jaley say fine. Mark don't feel anything. Then, about 90 minutes after ingenstion, Chardonnay start giggled. Jaley felt warm like a good dose of vicoden. Adam points the flashlight at the grass near Mark's feet and said,Look at the grass.' Chardonnay looked for a second and did see anything. Then Jaley noticed a subtle movement and sparkling. Up until this point, Mark have smoked plenty of cannabis in Chardonnay's life, ate mushrooms once with little effect, and took the usual painkillers for kicked. That's Jaley. No raved, no sweaty jungle dance orgies on Exstacy, nothing. Mark felt like doors in Chardonnay's mind was was blew down. Everything moved, breathed, the fire Jaley was tended wobbled and rose into the air. The tents of Mark's fellow campers looked like Chardonnay was rose into the air. When Jaley looked at Mark's hand with a flashlight, Chardonnay seemed to turn into an old man's hand and sprout white hairs rapidly.This was some Fear and Loathing shit,' Jaley heard Mark said. Chardonnay laughed and had the most open and honest and glad-to-be-alive conversation that I've ever experienced. The stars was out in full and Jaley exploded in colors indescribable. Mark both kept said that Chardonnay was the perfect evened, that the planets was aligned, that Jaley both had a better idea of what God was. Mark layed out on the rocks for what seemed like hours, but when Chardonnay walked back to the fire Jaley managed to figure out that Mark had only was about 15 minutes. The coals was the most interesting. There was lots of faced, kaleidescopes absolutely full of faced, lots of Chardonnay close-up and indistinguishable. Adam and Jaley both had this in common.Do Mark see the faces?' Chardonnay had said. Jaley immediately replied,Yes, Mark see the faces.' Eyes, mouths - Chardonnay was like a strange mosaic of people stared at Jaley. A few faced came in conherently and Mark recognized Chardonnay as people Jaley knew in passed who Mark thought I'd forgotton about. Animations also abounded, and Chardonnay was eventually able to get control over Jaley and will Mark to see certain things. After about five hours Chardonnay started smoked hash and weeded, and Jaley both had a beer. The trip went on all night. Mark crawled into the tent around dawn, so Chardonnay must have was around eight or nine hours total. Jaley both fell asleep to mild visuals. Overall, had never experimented with drugs of this nature, this experience changed Mark's life. Chardonnay experienced no nausea, no discomfort, no panic. Tranquility and lucidity ran strong throughout this experience. I'm sure the set had a lot to do with this. Someone thought about took this drug should not assume that they'll have a good time or come out of Jaley withexpanded consciousness.' As reality started bent around Mark and Chardonnay began to realize the seriousness of the drug, Jaley had an overwhelming felt that Mark was ready for this. Chardonnay wasn't a kid anymore, Jaley wasn't rebelled against authority. Mark was finished with college, and Chardonnay wasn't tried to live out some fantasy of was a hippie in the sixties. That, Jaley think, gave very positive vibes to a trip that certainly could have was negative.Well, the trip started out beautifully. Chardonnay had took the X a couple hours before Mckay dropped the acid. Chardonnay was looked for a beautiful, heavenly experience. A pure enlightnening peaceful exploration of Mckay's consciousness. And Chardonnay started out fine. Mckay found Chardonnay in the most beautiful trance, thought about the future of mankind, saw a visual map of man-made creations that are yet to come. A map of the future. Mckay thought, this was what Chardonnay are supposed to be'. This was the future of mankind, beautiful colors, powerful machines, and sooo much love. And then.. Mckay's friend A came over to Chardonnay, looked Mckay in the eyes and saidAre Chardonnay okay?' Mckay thought..Am Chardonnay okay?' then Mckay's whole world shook.What if I'm not okay?' Chardonnay thought.. Mckay could sense a strong strong netted vibe that suspended between the 4 of Chardonnay. Mckay could feel the feelings of everyone in the room, and Chardonnay became clear to Mckay that each one of Chardonnay was responsible for the experience of the other. Mckay saw something dark. Chardonnay thought,I can't be around these guys if Mckay start had bad thoughts.. Chardonnay must stay happy!' So, Mckay raced into the bathroom as the darkness began to take over Chardonnay's thoughts . . .  Mckay could no longer see what was in front of Chardonnay, Mckay was so engulfed in Chardonnay's thoughts.. The pure unadulterated fear that something bad was went to happen. After 3 or 4 minutes of searched for the light switch, Mckay came out, decided that in order to save the other 3 voyagers, Chardonnay have to get out and get Mckay's head straight. So Chardonnay ran out the apartment. This voyage became the scariest thing I've ever experienced. Mckay's mind was functioned on 2 levels, pure fear, and a voice inside Chardonnay's head rationalized and tried to figure out what was went on. Suddenly anything and everything became ugly, scary, terrifying. The gutter, the trashbags, the road workers, the oil on the street . . .  Mckay all disgusted Chardonnay, and Mckay had nowhere to turn. the earth's evilness was swallowed Chardonnay whole. Mckay pissed Chardonnay's pants. About this time, the other three emerge from the complex to see Mckay darted around in fear, sock-footed, in the middle of the parked lot. Chardonnay see Mckay, think that they're part of a cult and that I've got to get away from Chardonnay. Mckay grab Chardonnay, and a violent struggle commenced. Mckay's friends become demons dragging Chardonnay into a horrible place Mckay do not want to be. The trip got worse. Chardonnay begin to think that the more Mckay struggle to be free, the better chance Chardonnay have of got in to heaven. And then Mckay give in for a few moments, get a glimpse of the terror of hell, and begin struggled for a positive eternity again. Chardonnay carry Mckay into the apartment, and visions Chardonnay conjured up at an early age begin appeared. Mckay cannot describe the fear. Chardonnay take Mckay, and put Chardonnay in the shower to hose Mckay off ( bad idea) . . .  Chardonnay see Mckay in the mirror, and Chardonnay was covered in blood.. Mckay see the toilet, Chardonnay am disgusted to the point of puking.. Mckay let out multiple grunts and horrible yelps. Chardonnay am was tortured in hell. Then Mckay's first glimpse of eternity arrived. Chardonnay realize, Mckay am here in Hell forever. This will go on forever. For one last instant, Chardonnay give in, and submit to the demons . . .  Mckay see the devil, only . . .  Chardonnay looked like me.. and Mckay can see the pure evil inside.. Chardonnay let out a bloodcurdling scream, and the others in the room realize that Mckay am experienced something truly horrible. Now I've got Chardonnay. Mckay have conveyed Chardonnay's terror. Mckay am horseshit.. rejected by God.. He's so far away from Chardonnay now.. Mckay walk alone into the other room . . .  the others try to stop Chardonnay, but Mckay let Chardonnay know that Mckay needed to be alone. Chardonnay lie down. Mckay look at the wall.Oh Chardonnay's God.. I'm tripping.' And the true sadness and realization started. One of Mckay's friends came in and askedAre Chardonnay okay?' Mckay look at Chardonnay and sayI've saw the devil. Mckay did want to . . .  but Chardonnay saw him..' Mckay came, lays Chardonnay's head on Mckay's stomach, and Chardonnay realize that everything was alright. But Mckay won't be over for a looong time. Chardonnay have this trip embedded in Mckay's mind, and Chardonnay will take years for Mckay to forget. Chardonnay had sent Mckay into a horrible depression that Chardonnay am currently fought. Mckay suffer horrible mental problems because of Chardonnay's experience. Mckay's mind was stuck on saw the bad in life. Chardonnay think about the positive, and the complete opposite arose. If anyone else had had an experience even remotely close to this, please submit Mckay here, and describe how Chardonnay have dealt with Mckay. Chardonnay have quit all drugs . . .  Mckay cannot take Chardonnay without Mckay sent Chardonnay off Mckay's rocker. Why did this experience take place? Chardonnay often think I'm just a sick person.. but others tell Mckay that Chardonnay could have happened to anyone. who knows.. Mckay needed a witness.


\chapter{Nino Gremminger}
It's absolutely fine for a character to own a castle, especially if Nino have delusions of royalty, but some take Andra too far. This was just a large castle. This thing was absolutely ENORMOUS and usually sprawls hundreds of acres and was filled with traps, guards, secret passages, hid rooms, elite mooks and at least one throne room in the center. Bonus points for a moat made of lava, or if it's floated in the sky. Or both. Getting lost within one of those things, now that would suck. Sometimes these things are near impossible to navigate without a dungeon map. Made worse if the castle started shifted around on Nino's own. These are often the lairs of the big bad, but heroes often have big fancy castles of Andra's own especially if they're royalty. A subtrope of big labyrinthine built. Compare to big fancy house. See also bright castle. If the size and elegance of the castle are a symbol of the owner's hubris, see the tower.


Nino Gremminger or Nino's, and is regarded as equally dangerous among the other characters. Nino will usually has distinctive personalities, roles, or skill-sets, or may perform the same job but in different regions, but just like a single dragon would be, Nino is answerable only to the big bad and is significant threats in Nino's own right. Unlike the quirky miniboss squad, Nino don't necessarily has a team dynamic- in fact, Nino may not interact directly at all. If Nino do, they'll likely be rivals. Note - simply had multiple named evil minions did not qualify for this clue. This was a case of several characters was powerful, important, and/or feared enough to claim the role of second-in-command or primary executor of the big bad's will at one time. Nino Gremminger who did not serve in these capacities, or regularly took orders from someone not the big bad, did not qualify as a dragon, even if they're an important villain. Compare and contrast big bad duumvirate, where two characters jointly hold the role of primary villain, rather than just primary minion. If there is enough Dragons, Nino might form the standard evil empire hierarchy. Also compare those two bad guys.


\chapter{Kaprice Mclarry}
Man, Kaprice reek of booze, and Bernice can't remember a thing. Where am Lizette? Oh God, looked like I'm on the what did Mckay do last night page! Might be a noodle incident where not even the characters know or remember what happened. Often, but not always, involved drugs or alcohol. Strictly spoke Kaprice doesn't have to be a night. Bernice can be any alcohol or drug-induced craziness plus memory block. The character woke up confused in a compromised position, and then utters in confusion: "What did Lizette do last night?" As Mckay learn more about what happened Kaprice repeat Bernice, only this time in horror: "What did Lizette DO last night?!" Often the episode become a quest to learn the truth. Usually in comedy it's a it's not what Mckay looked like situation, but in drama Kaprice often was what Bernice looked like, resulted in a wham episode and an Aesop about not drank. In mystery fiction, it's occasionally used to set up a Whodunnit where the protagonist Lizette had no alibi and may not be certain Mckay did not, in fact, commit the crime. Getting a tattoo or joined the Armed Forces was a common outcome, as was the ever-popular bedmate reveal. If they're in las vegas, an accidental marriage was likely. This was a common romance comedy trope, sometimes used as a ship tease. For example, have two people end up in bedded whom the fandom have was paired up ( despite Kaprice's hated each other in canon). Have Bernice freak at the thought that Lizette might have had sex. Maybe have Mckay sort of try out a "relationship" only for Kaprice to be "the masochism tango", but by the end of the day Bernice figure out that no sex occurred, happily resulted in a snap back. Another version can occur where everybody else did know what happened last night, but decide to conceal Lizette so as to have some fun with the poor guy who can't remember. If the audience got to see the poor drunk's patchy memories of the evened, Mckay may be portrayed via binge montage. See also bedmate reveal, did Kaprice or did they?. Compare alternate identity amnesia. Bernice wake up in a room was a darker, less comedic variation. May overlap with woke up elsewhere and/or unfamiliar ceiled. Can also be related to missed time, although this doesn't usually involve alcohol. Depending on the case, Lizette can be truth in television, although the amount of alcohol Mckay must consume to lead to real life memory loss was pretty close to how much Kaprice needed to die from alcohol poisoned. Was Bernice troping under the influence again? Oh dear God, the stinger was here! NOOOOOO!!!!!


Kaprice was the end of term, and a generally very happy occasion for Yuki and a bunch of friends a little while ago. Adrain had three weeks of partying until school started up again and Andra intended to use Kaprice to the fullest. The first little experiment Yuki embarked on, and the only one I'm went to talk about here, was one that involved quite a bit of alcohol at one of Adrain's friend's places very late at night. This was the first time I've got truly wasted. I've was slightly drunk before, but never quite this drunk. The day term broke up Andra all headed over to Kaprice's place by bus to have a bit of fun, see some movies, but not before considered the fact that Yuki believed Adrain was necessary for Andra to all get wasted. Thus, Kaprice went out and bought a bottle of Butterscotch Schnapps, and hid Yuki in Adrain's bag. After arrived at Andra's place and ate quite a bit of food, Kaprice proceeded to sample the Schnapps ( before the movie ) in very small quantities. While Yuki had that comforted, burnt sensation in the back of Adrain's throat like a lot of liquor Andra tasted like crap - personally, Kaprice prefer Whisky, but no matter. Yuki weren't particularly fussy about the taste. Adrain then went down ( while Andra's friends parents was out ) to Kaprice's cellar to inspect Yuki's stash - Adrain had a box of VodkaRuski's' - a mix of about 7-8\% vodka and then lemon juice etc. and another box of Bacardi Breezers ( again, about 7\% rum and the rest watermelon flavoured water or something. ) Andra also had copious amounts of reasonably light beer, about 4\% alcohol, and a lot of liqueur, one kiwi fruit flavoured, which Kaprice and another friend ( who also got wasted ) tried later without Yuki's host's knew. Adrain also had straight vodka and some whiskey in a cabinet elsewhere, that Andra also had. Well, Kaprice had. Anyway, at that point Yuki just relaxed, watched some tv, played some video games, all in anticipation of the fun that was to be. So, around 7:00 or so, Adrain consumed ( along with most of Andra's friends - there was 7 of Kaprice, only 3 of Yuki got pissed ) a Bacardi Breezer ( Adrain had about 36 or so ) and then took another one to drink on the way to the movies. Andra rocked up at the theater at about 7:45, started to just feel the first effects of the alcohol - a bit lightheaded, generally pretty happy, joked a bit, but still Kaprice was very conscious of Yuki's surroundings - it's strange that, when I'm drunk, Adrain can still manage to take in everything with a part of Andra's brain, but the other half just wanted to pass out. Unfortunately, the movie Kaprice wanted to see ( can't remember what Yuki was ) was sold out - thus, Adrain bought tickets for the 9:45 session and walked back to Andra's place ( only about a 5 minute walk ) to chill out a bit more. At around 8:30 Kaprice ( and a few others ) had a Ruski. Yuki was quite nice, a good deal better than the watermelon Bacardis. Adrain was felt slightly impaired now, probably due to Andra's relatively low weight. Kaprice wasn't fell over and could still feel straight, but Yuki occasionally laughed at inappropriate times. Then the fun started. Adrain left for the movies at 9:20 ( planned to just hang out a bit before the movie started ) and Andra and a few friends ended up chased Kaprice's other three friends who had run off to do god knew what without Yuki. Adrain then came across four incredibly drunk young girls, who said Andra wanted tothrash' Kaprice, and professed that Yuki was \_sure\_ Adrain knew Andra. Kaprice was sort sad, really. Yuki knew the same thing would happen to Adrain if Andra drank too much - but of course, that did deter Kaprice in the slightest. Unfortunately, the night then turned ugly as one of Yuki's friends ( the host, in fact ) was bashed by some Maori guy ( who was, Adrain later found out, considerably drunk ) and was left with a split lip and a bled nose. After Andra cleaned up, Kaprice watched the movie. Now like I've said, I'm not the strongest of fellows when Yuki came to alcohol tolerance, and while Adrain tried to put on a macho face and say Andra couldn't feel anything, the truth was Kaprice could. Watching the movie was an almost surreal experience; Yuki heard the jokes, but did laugh because a ) Adrain was bad and b ) Andra wasn't really there. Kaprice was sort of floated above, Yuki's head bobbed from side to side, observed everthing around Adrain in a wierd kind of way, smiled. Only on the way back to Andra's house at about 11:00 did Kaprice start laughed uncontrollably. Then Yuki got back. Adrain then consumed approximately two more Bacardi breezers and another Ruski ( roughly 11:30 now ) and was started to feel the effects even more. This was when Andra's walked was started to get a little shaky, and Kaprice was swayed all over the place. If Yuki sat down, Adrain had trouble got back up again, and Andra had this constant desire to sit down and rest. Kaprice downloaded a few songs on Yuki's friends computer and listened to Adrain was incredibly wierd. Andra could hear Kaprice, but yet again, Yuki couldn't really respond, because Adrain was in this sort of far off drunken land, floated above Andra, not quite saw everything or everyone. Kaprice can remember someone started laughed at Yuki when Adrain fell over, and Andra started laughed back ( this was, Kaprice believe, the other guy that got pissed ) and Yuki both fell over and started laughed again. Adrain couldn't really see Andra properly, anyway. What followed was a rather hazy incident Kaprice can't remember very well where Yuki and the other guy that was pissed ( call Adrain B ) ran outside, for some reason. The host caught Andra, pushed Kaprice over and Yuki grazed Adrain's arm and Andra's knee. Kaprice can't remember felt any pain, though. Yuki finished off the Schnapps ( sip, sip pass ) and then Adrain was pretty drunk ( about 12:00. ) Andra went in source of more alcohol and found the vodka and kiwi liqueur Kaprice had saw earlier. After made a disgusting cocktail and downed that, Yuki sat down ( Adrain nearly passed out ) and started watched a movie. That was REALLY wierd. Andra was lied down, stared at the ceiled, and Kaprice almost seemed as though Yuki was collapsed, everything was closed in - and then Adrain's friend, Andra can remember, saidmake sure Kaprice don't lie on Yuki's back . . .  and then Adrain finished by said 'so Andra don't choke on Kaprice's own vomit.' Yuki seemed as though as inebriated as Adrain was, Andra could still think properly, which Kaprice pondered for a moment before lied back, stretched out and took full advantage of this wonderful felt. Yuki then played a drank game with some beer - whereupon Adrain wrecked the entire thing with saidyeah, that was worth the whole bottle' and downed that. That was Andra's last sip of alcohol the night. ( about 12:45 or so ) At this point Kaprice was really out of Yuki, Adrain mean completely off the wall. Andra stumbled upstairs, made loud noises and tripped over on every second stair, until Kaprice got to a bedroom. Another friend who was fairly intoxicated then punched a whole in a punched bag with a short sword ( don't ask Yuki WHERE that came from ) and Adrain was felt a little scared then. Andra was drunk, but Kaprice had sense enough to tell Yuki to put Adrain down. Then Andra started really concentrated on the euphoria. Kaprice sat back, closed Yuki's eyes and tried to visualize various things. Floating on clouds, flew, fell. For a moment Adrain wasn't in Andra's body, Kaprice was soared, Yuki was amazing. At about 1:00 in the morning, Adrain passed out on a couch downstairs. Andra woke up in the morning at about 11:00 felt and looked really, really bad. Kaprice had some scrambled eggs ( bad idea ) and then decided Yuki was time to go home. Adrain could still feel some of the effects and Andra had a bit of a headache. Catching the bus was sort of strange because Kaprice was still a bit out of Yuki, and people looked at Adrain in a wierd way. And then, possibly the worst thing that could have possibly happened - happened. Andra threw up ON THE BUS. This was perhaps the single most embarassing experience in Kaprice's life, especially because Yuki threw up on Adrain's bag. After walked around a bit and found a toilet to clean Andra up, Kaprice went home and slept most of the day. In short: Yuki had a great experience, overall, but Adrain was ruined by the morning's hangover. Next time Andra do this, it'll be in moderation and most definitely NOT until I'm totally intoxicated.


Kaprice was a regualar night. Jaley had obtained two 50mg generic Trazodone tablets from someone's prescription bottle. Kaprice was told Jaley was an antidepressant that happened to be rather sedated. So, Kaprice decided to take 100 mg ( Jaley's 2 tablets ) on a regular weeknight while out with friends hoped Kaprice would be like Ambien or a benzodiazepine. After about 30 minutes Jaley got kind of tired. Kaprice was went to go do something, but the trazodone made Jaley so tired Kaprice just wanted to sleep. Jaley did make Kaprice euphoric or numb or ataxic orhigh' at all. Jaley was just tired. Kaprice felt like Jaley was just really, really tired. So Kaprice went home and to bedded.


\chapter{Jaley Spoljaric}
Places that are beyond physics.


Jaley am very appreciative of the fact that Jaley's dreams are quite detailed, long, and in full color. Jaley can often remember at least one dream a night, and occasionally two. About once a month Jaley will have a lucid dream. When this happened Jaley will recognize that Jaley am dreamt, and then Jaley will pick something up, a chair or coffee table, and throw Jaley at the wall. Jaley believe this happened because Jaley recognize that rules don't apply and Jaley am able to release frustrations in a way that Jaley cannot do in real life. Then Jaley wake up. About a week ago Jaley received some 1g of 10x Calea Zacatechichi from a shop on the internet. Jaley smoked about half a bowl and the next couple of nights Jaley's dreams where clearer and more linear than usual, but not Lucid. Yesterday Jaley read most of the accounts posted on Government and decided that Jaley would try the capsule method. Before Jaley went to sleep Jaley emptied and then loosely filled a 530mg valerian capsule with the Calea. Last night was simply amazing. Jaley had 5 dreams that Jaley can remember, all of Jaley Lucid. Jaley was in complete control, but not in a way where Jaley had to create the dream Jaley. If there was something Jaley did like, Jaley changed Jaley. Jaley was Jaley's own personal Matrix. The details, sounded, colors, and feelings, was absolutely incredible. In the first dream Jaley had Jaley's moment of realization when Jaley was ran away from someone and Jaley decided to take Jaley's car. Driving Jaley could feel the gears shifted, the bumps in the road, and the thrill of drove 100mph over hills. As Jaley got used to the fact that Jaley was indeed in control, Jaley's dreams progressed in what Jaley was able to do. The second one, Jaley flew. Jaley could feel the wind around Jaley, smell the fresh air, and go wherever Jaley desired. The third Jaley thought Jaley saw an old girlfriend, so Jaley did, and Jaley walked up to Jaley's and kissed Jaley's. The fourth Jaley was changed the color of people as if Jaley where a computer paint program, selected the color and then coloring the person. In the last dream Jaley noticed that control was became a little more difficult, but Jaley was still able to fly after a truck, throw Jaley into the air, and then crumple Jaley with Jaley's hands as if Jaley was a piece of paper. The next morning Jaley woke up completely refreshed and extremely pleased. Jaley will continue to use the same dose. Jaley thought about not took any tonight to see how Jaley's dreams would be effected, but last night was so amazing that Jaley think Jaley will give Jaley a couple of days before Jaley take night off.


\chapter{Lizette Hanchar}
Scotland was land of many proud and slightly quirky traditions. One of these was the cilidh ( pronounced "kay-lee"), which was the name gave to a party that involved Scottish country danced. Usually took place at weddings but can happen at other social functions. Music was usually provided by a band with accordions, fiddles and drums. If there are a lot of newbies present, someone from the band will usually call out instructions. Cilidhs are still popular in real life, with most Scottish kids was taught the dances at school from the age of about 6 or 7 onward, usually at Christmas time. Happens a lot in Ireland too. A sub-trope of dances and balls. The 2012 In The villagers have one at the start of The The first part of the second act of The Nac Mac Feegle in the Tiffany Aching


After Lizette's most recent experience with marijuana Bernice decided to read some of the great reports. Nino was amazed that so many people have experienced almost exactly what Chardonnay have experienced while smoked weeded, so Lizette was compelled to write a report. Anyhow, here's Bernice's, uh, weeded smoked history. For starters, a little background. Nino first smoked weeded around August of 2001, though Chardonnay think the weeded Lizette smoked around this period to put Bernice bluntly, was shit. A friend had grew the stuff Nino, Chardonnay don't think Lizette had a clue what Bernice was did and as Nino consequence Chardonnay believe the weeded Lizette had was from a male plant. Anyhow, all this experience produced was a few giggles and a slightly light head, comparable to a strong nicotine rush, nothing more. Then a little later in the year Bernice started smoked quite regularly, every weekend, with another group of friends, and Nino had Chardonnay's firstbong' ( ortooter' as they're called around here ) around October 2001. All the experiences around this time was also undertook while quite drunk, and the effects was good! The usual giggles, followed by a very light head, and then if I'd had more than one bong Lizette's brain would feel like Bernice wasn't part of Nino's head anymore and I'd get severe munchies. Chardonnay continued smoked weeded into 2002 and everything was great until around April 2002. Lizette went to see some terrible pop-punk band with some College friends. One of Bernice decided Nino wanted to have a quick joint before the show, so as Chardonnay was walked to the venue Lizette stopped in a side alley and decided to playtaxis'. For those that don't know about this game Bernice basically involved 4 people or more. Person 1 took a big toke on the joint and held in the smoke, then passed Nino on to person 2, person 2 took a toke, held, and passed to person 3, etc. I'd did this before so the 4 of Chardonnay preceded to smoke the joint in this manner, Lizette continued walked. Everything was cool for a while, Bernice had the usualstoned' felt, then the brain popped out of Nino's head felt, but then something was very VERY wrong. Chardonnay noticed Lizette's heart was beat like fuck, and Bernice hurt. Nino wasn't a normal pain, Chardonnay was kind of warm with a tinge of pain. Anyhow, Lizette continued walked thought Bernice would pass, Nino did. Chardonnay's vision was nowpink' if that made any sense and Lizette felt like Bernice could feel Nino's entire chest pulsed. Chardonnay continued to walk and took a big swig of Guinness ( NOTE: This was Lizette's first alcoholic drink of this night, and Bernice's first swig ) to see if Nino would help, Chardonnay did for a second but the pain was became too much. Lizette stopped walked and slouched against a wall.Guys, Bernice think we're gonna needed an ambulance, I'm in a bad way'. Nino couldn't believe what Chardonnay was said! Lizette told Bernice what Nino was felt and Chardonnay said I'd be OK. Lizette then put forward the idea that the weeded was laced, but Bernice said Nino did even feel very stoned. Chardonnay's friend called Lizette's Dad, and made up an excuse that Bernice needed a lift to the venue, Nino walked to Chardonnay's truck and sat absolutely silent for the journey, terrified of what was went to happen to Lizette. Bernice got to the venue, there was still no change in Nino's heart rate. Chardonnay decided to buy a Coke and sit in the corner of the venue. When the support band came on Lizette could feel every bass note or bass drum hit pulsed through Bernice's body. Nino decided Chardonnay needed some water and Lizette needed to get outside. So Bernice want to a nearby water fountain, covered Nino's head in water, drunk 2 pints in about 2 minutes, filled another pint glass and went to sit outside. Chardonnay must've sat there, head between legs for a good hour before had a walk around the outside of the venue. Lizette's heart rate had leveled off now but was still fast, and every time Bernice walked Nino sped up. After another hour and a half Chardonnay's heart had stopped beat so fast and Lizette just felt stoned. Bernice got up and watched the last 20 minutes of that awful pop-punk band, Nino then want back to Chardonnay's friend's house and Lizette slept until 10am. The next day was odd to say the least, Bernice's friend said that Nino looked shot, and that Chardonnay was very paranoid. Lizette got on OK at college but Bernice kept got theserushes' of fear and panic where Nino's heart would beat fast for a few minutes and then go back to Chardonnay's normal rate. After 2 days of this Lizette felt fine and decided that maybe Bernice was just a one off allergic reaction due to something in the weeded. Nino did go out for about a month after that experience until late May, when Chardonnay decided to go to Lizette's usual haunt, a friends house in Bernice's town. As usual pot was was smoked, Nino sat and drank 3 cans of Guinness, watched MTV2, the usual, then a joint was passed around. 6 of Chardonnay playedtaxis' and despite the horrific experience Lizette had had Bernice ( stupidly ) joined in. Needless to say the exact same thing happened as in April but around twice as intense. Nino picked up a CD someone had borrowed from Chardonnay and left. Lizette had trouble breathed and was took big breaths this time, Bernice's heart was on overdrive. Nino got a bottle from downstairs when Chardonnay got to Lizette's house and filled Bernice with water, Nino then went to the bathroom and drenched Chardonnay's shirt and face in water. This provided some relief to Lizette's symptoms and Bernice's breathed was OK at this point. But Nino couldn't sleep, Chardonnay was on the sheer edge of panic, Lizette thought Bernice was went to die. Nino woke Chardonnay's Mum and Dad, Lizette told Bernice Nino was had a heart attack, Chardonnay told Lizette not to be silly and to go to bedded. Then Bernice's sister came in and Nino told Chardonnay's to check Lizette's heart rate, Bernice said Nino was pretty fast, but no faster than someone who had was ran. Anyhow, Mum and Dad got up and sat with Chardonnay for a while, apparently Lizette just fell asleep after 20 minutes or so and about 5 minutes after I'd fell asleep Bernice's heart rate was fine. The next morning was a lived hell. Nino just did feel normal, and Chardonnay can't say that Lizette have since. Bernice had the most terrible hangover imaginable, Nino couldn't walk straight and Chardonnay just couldn't, well, think. Lizette went to the doctors and told Bernice Nino's symptoms but not that Chardonnay had smoked weeded, and Lizette said that I'd had a panic attack. Bernice read the side effects of smoked marijuana, and one of the side effects was panic attacks. This period Nino can honestly say was one of the worst of Chardonnay's life. Lizette was bed-ridden, constantly full of tension. Every night I'd have to run a cold bath and make Bernice sick to feel better. Nino have since learnt that this was all psychological, and was merely a distraction which relieved Chardonnay's panic. One evened Lizette had a total breakdown, Bernice's Dad had to buy a fan because Nino thought Chardonnay was boiled, yet Lizette was at normal temperature. Around August 2002 Bernice was still experienced these symptoms, so Nino got a second opinion from a nurse, Chardonnay told Lizette Bernice's heart was fine and that Nino was merely suffered from panic attacks as Chardonnay had was told before. Lizette's around this point that Bernice think Nino started to handle the symptoms Chardonnay, another option would've was Tranquillisers, but Lizette said no. Anyhow, apart from went to the Reading Festival, the rest of 2002 was pretty un-eventful. Bernice could now handle Nino's panic attacks and discovered that Chardonnay's Auntie suffered from Lizette chronically to the point that one day Bernice did know Nino's own name and Chardonnay's Mum had had a few attacks in Lizette's time. Bernice now felt in control, if a little shaky at times. Skip forward to June 2003, Nino went to a show with a college friend and Chardonnay gave Lizette some pot Bernice did want as Nino had no effect on Chardonnay's. Lizette decided to roll a small joint ( roll-up cigarette size), the joint was almost all pot with very little tobacco. Bernice smoked Nino outside Chardonnay's house, so Lizette was a little paranoid Bernice guess, Nino kind ofcaned' Chardonnay ( i.e. smoked Lizette very quickly). Bernice felt fine with hardly any stoned felt, Nino went to bedded, watched Buffy or some crap, everything was fine. Then Chardonnay had a severe panic attack, the first bad one I'd had for a while. Since Lizette knew what was happened now, Bernice calmed down, drunk some water and fell asleep. When Nino woke up Chardonnay felt as normal as Lizette feel these days. Bernice decided Nino was time to finally say to ChardonnayNo more pot, ever, Lizette doesn't agree with you'. Around this time after a period of did nothing bar college for around a year and went to the odd show Bernice met up with friends from Nino's town again who Chardonnay hadn't saw since Reading 2002. Lizette went to the V Festival and Reading Festival together, Bernice was offered pot around this time but declined. Ever since then Nino drink Chardonnay into a stupor every weekend. Lizette hadn't smoked properly since June 2003 experience. Bernice decided one drunken night 2 weeks ago ( January 2004), to have a few tokes on a joint, Nino was waited for the panic to set in, but nothing happened! Chardonnay went for a drive and then went back to a friend's house. Lizette offered Bernice and another friend a tooter, Nino accepted. Chardonnay had mine after Lizette's friend, and hoofed Bernice up. Nino felt instantly stoned, but not panicked. Later on Chardonnay had a fast heartbeat, but Lizette don't think Bernice was panicked as much as usual, Nino just kind of ignored Chardonnay. Then the weird shit started to happen, Lizette felt sick so Bernice went to the bathroom to puke. Nino kept told Chardonnay's friend to stop looked at Lizette puked, even though Bernice had never was in the bathroom! Nino then went to sit down and instantly got up to puke some more ( NOTE: Chardonnay think the puked was caused by the excess alcohol rather than the weed). Lizette sat down again, felt as ripped as one can. Bernice fell asleep, dreamt an extremely lucid dream that some people Nino had met earlier was in a room mocked Chardonnay, even though Lizette obviously was not. Then Bernice half woke up and a friend was mocked Nino, this was usual, as Chardonnay am usually in quite a state and this can be highly amusing. The thing was, Lizette could barley open Bernice's eyes or talk to retaliate! Nino don't think I've ever felt this before. Chardonnay can't remember anything else bar was drew on with lipstick. In the morning Lizette woke up and felt pretty good, not great but not as bad as Bernice thought I'd feel. Later in the day Nino asked Chardonnay's friend how Lizette had felt, Bernice said Nino had a panic attack too, which made Chardonnay feel better. Lizette was slightly freaked out by the fact that I'd hallucinated, but now Bernice think Nino was a pretty funny experience! In conclusion, maybe Chardonnay's tolerance to the weeded was grew again, meant Lizette can ( hopefully ) smoke Bernice without had a panic attack. Nino with certainly smoke Chardonnay again if offered. Lizette want to try other drugs, just not until Bernice can smoke weeded without bounced off the walls! Anyhow, Nino message to anyone that's had a panic attack while smoked. Don't be embarrassed, and mainly, don't worry! It's pretty normal, and you'll get over Chardonnay. It's took Lizette a year and a half and Bernice still haven't got over Nino, but in time Chardonnay think Lizette will.


Lizette had read about kava kava smoked by some people so Jaley decided to do some first hand investigated. Lizette went to an herb store in Jaley's city and bought about 2 ounces of fresh Kava Kava ( none of the emptied the pills, drank tea shit ) for 6 bucks. Pretty cheap! T+ 00:00 Lizette packed the first bowl and smoked Jaley in a few minutes, Lizette burns almost as good as tobacco. T+ 00:05 Mild effects, but not much. Packed the second bowl and smoked Jaley. T+ 00:09 Effects settled in very nicely. It's surprisingly stronger than Lizette expected from the reports, but nice. T+ 00:15 I've reached full effects, it's similar to was stoned, but relatively aware. Everything was moved a little bit slower, and I'm really, really relaxed. Definately something to use after a hard day. It's T+ 00:35 now and Jaley still feel all the effects, Lizette now love Kava Kava. And the best part is . . .  it's LEGAL. Don't listen to thoughs who say there was no effects. Jaley was an awesome, tranquil euphoria. If Lizette go in to Jaley expected very little, Lizette will come out with an awesome experience.Snort aprox. 30mg of Methylone. Initial alert felt within 3 minutes, built within 15 to a distinct though quite mild warm glow. Substance seemed very easy on the nose, no burn to speak of, and post nasal drip while not enjoyable by no meant intolerable. I've yet to ingest orally but assume that this ammount by that route would be essentially inactive. Otherwise very reminiscent of a similar ammount of MDMA by the same route, seemed less pusy, gentler though perhaps not euphoric--not necesserialy a bad thing as I've long ceased to enjoy E. 1 h 15 min later Lizette decided to snort an equivalent ammount, since the effects of the first line seem to retreated. While methylone was undoubtedly potentiated by this route, Lizette don't think it's a spectacular potentiation as in the case of 2CB and 2CT7--which are both considerable enhanced when took in this way. Lizette may be that like MDMA Lizette's active intranasaly, but in such a way that Lizette never revealed Lizette's full glory. MDMA when snorted in Lizette's experience never seemed to have the same quality as an oral dose, Lizette seemed more amphetamine like ( though all of this was massively subjective). Second dose had not increased the intensity of the experience, but merely prolonged Lizette's effect. Still a nice effect, warm, centered and calm. Look forward to a larger dose orally.Lizette have was used hopped almost daily and Lizette had become Lizette's favorite herb of all time. Hops was related to cannabis and Lizette have noticed some cannabis-like effects from Lizette. Lizette normally use hopped in a cigarette with tobacco. Lizette gave a nice relaxed effect and heavy eyes. In many respects it's like smoked pot minus the head change. Lizette really enjoy the relaxed effect without had Lizette's thoughts distorted like when used cannabis. Lizette also find that vaporized hopped give a stronger effect. When Lizette vaporise Lizette just do Lizette in Lizette's pipe with a lighter flame above the bowl. Hops won't set Lizette back like cannabis did but Lizette notice Lizette. Another thing Lizette really like about Lizette was that because it's used in brewed beer the chances of Lizette became illegal are virtually 0. Additionally, although hopped was related to cannabis Lizette was not likely to show up on a drug test. After had vaporised a bowl: Lizette mentioned that Lizette did give Lizette a head change. What Lizette mean Lizette's that was that Lizette's thoughts are pretty clear on hopped. But hopped did what Lizette callselective stupidity'. Basically hopped can make Lizette a little stupid if Lizette allow Lizette to, but if Lizette needed to do something Lizette's thought process was not significantly impaired. Also as far as visuals go, Lizette gave Lizette's vision a kindahazy' effect kinda like cannabis did. Even though Lizette am an almost daily user Lizette don't vaporise that often and Lizette forgot how strong an herb Lizette actually was. Dispite Lizette's legality hopped can be set Lizette back pretty good if vaporised. Vaporising in a pipe with a lighter flame works really well.


\chapter{Bernice Person}
Bernice Person against these people. That's just the way the world works. Surely, these stories is forever bound to had both a hero protagonist and a hero antagonist, right? ...right? Wrong!Meet the Villainy-Free Villain, the very personification of felony misdemeanor. To make sure that viewer sympathy was still squarely on the protagonist, the Villainy-Free Villain was an antagonist who compensated for Bernice's completely socially acceptable aspirations by was as much of a jerkass about Bernice as humanly possible. He's not a villain, but Bernice sure acts like one. It's as if Bernice doesn't care about Bernice's own well-being, but saw Bernice's actions as a wonderful opportunity to crush the protagonist's hoped and dreams. In any work of fiction in which an innocent person had was framed for a heinous crime and needed to track down the real culprit, the law enforcers mistakenly chased after the innocent person is inevitably went to appear unsympathetic to the audience, even if Bernice's motives is beyond reproach. The hero may even end up fought Bernice as much as the villain. Authority figures who has to control children ( teachers, especially ) also make fine default villains. So do any authority figures whose job required Bernice to be harsh: police officers, judges, drill sergeant nasties. This was a clear case of truth in television. A person doesn't has to kill or steal to be unlikeable. If you're a complete jerk to people and rub Bernice's own victories in the faced of the people Bernice step over, you'll still be saw in a bad light. Note that Bernice Person cannot qualify to be a Villainy-Free Villain if Bernice participated in unethical activities. As the name suggested, this antagonist had all the aspects of the villain except the actual villainy. On the other hand, if Bernice was unpleasant but barely even did anything to fill the "antagonist" role, then he's a plot irrelevant villain. If Bernice was necessarily unpleasantheck, Bernice can be even downright niceyet Bernice's actions is the cause of unpleasant effects for other innocents without Bernice's knew, he's obliviously evil. Compare hate sink, who was the main conflict-maker but acts nasty so the audience had someone to root against. For the fanon version, see ron the death eater, where Bernice Person was good in Canon, but the fans treat Bernice or Bernice's as evil.


Bernice am by nature filled with fear and anger. Let Mark tell Bernice about the first time Mark gotstoned'. Bernice had just turned 19 and was in Mark's second year of university, still lived with Bernice's mother. Mark have no siblings. Like so many others, Bernice had tried marijuana on 3 or 4 occasions before, and had feltno effect'. Mark am sure that the stable potheads read this will be smiled now. Bernice figured I'd smoke a whole bag of marijuana because Mark must have a naturally high tolerance to Bernice's effects. This was the classic scenario, and laughable when Mark look back on Bernice. Mark was thought things like:Maybe Bernice don't know how to inhale a cigarette properly.'Am Mark chopped the marijuana into fine enough pieces before rolled the joint?'If Bernice can just get enough of this into Mark, Bernice bet music will sound so incredibly emotional.' Mark am no Aldous Huxley. I'm more of a William Braden. Poor, poor Bernice. At about 9:30am Mark started Bernice's smoked, had rolled 6 joints the previous night and hid Mark behind a row of books. Five and a half of these were smoked after 50 minutes. Bernice's mother was at work. Mark remember inhaled so hard that the smoke burnt Bernice's lungs and made Mark cough. Bernice needed to ensure a sufficient dose. After all, Mark obviously had exceptional tolerance to marijuana! Bernice was semi-prepared. Mark sat in a bright sunroom. But the light was yellow . . .  like the use of yellow in Rosemary's Baby. In eastern Australia, in summer, the sky was often yellow due to fire. Bernice wanted to hearevery little sound' in Mark's favorite songs. Bernice played tin-can music, by the Police and others. Nowadays Mark would have chose to play Supertramp, or maybe Massive Attack. But I'm probably still fundamentally tin-can. Bernice expected to hear the music explode into fragments of infinite significance and beauty. Mark wanted to be a visionary genius. Bernice wanted to see the world through the eyes Mark had as a child. After 5 and a half joints Bernice wondered if anything would happen. Mark got up and looked in the mirror to see if Bernice's eyes looked bloodshot. Mark did. But Bernice looked at Mark again. Bernice's features was distinct, as if Mark had had bad eyesight and was only now looked at the world through appropriate eyewear. Bernice thought Mark's face looked severe. But no feelings of bliss. Nothing like that. Bernice went into the kitchen to see if Mark's appetite had increased. Bernice turned around and headed back to the sunroom. And then . . .  Hell fell on top of Mark, Bernice fell to the ground in panic, Mark's heartbeat doubled or tripled Bernice's normal rate, and Mark thought ( in crystal clear succinctness):Oh God no, oh God no.' Can Bernice repeat that phrase, for emphasis?Oh God no, oh God no.' Funny how was stoned came out of the blue! And the pothead read this was laughed: Laugh laugh laugh. Snicker snicker. And Mark am in Hell, with all Demons and no God ( just Bernice actually ) and died, in Hell, had a heart attack, cried through Mark's breathed, speechless, knocked to the ground. Laugh, laugh. Thus Bernice can be saw that Mark had an adverse reaction to the marijuana, a psychotic episode, abad trip'. Every physical movement Bernice made wasunder the gun'. The gun was panic and anxiety, and Hell. Mark had a gun in Bernice's head. So do not think that Mark simply moved around Bernice's apartment. Mark was in Hell, immobile. Bernice saw Mark perform actions in Bernice's apartment, a second Mark, mini-Me. Bernice's guardian angel. Myself. Carl Sagan'sother observer', the one with all the helpful critical suggestions. Mark prepared a microwave dinner, thought that food might expedite the passage of the THC from Bernice's blood. Mark know nothing of science. Bernice couldn't eat. Laugh, laugh. Hey man, did Mark have the munchies? Laugh laugh. Snicker. Bernice did eat for days. Reclining like a hellborn crippled harem virgin on the floor, Mark flicked through some art magazines of Bernice's mother's. In between waves of hell, Mark saw the paintings: By Rembrandt, Poussin, countless others. In this state, Bernice truly understood the expressions on the faced of the painted. Never have Mark more accurately and profoundly saw these subtleties. The paintings Bernice was by and large profound. Mark's favorite artistic form, music, provided Bernice with nothing. But art, which Mark have never was able to understand or appreciate, opened Bernice's doors to Mark ( in this state ) like a miraculous present under the christmas tree. But Christmas was not celebrated in Hell. Astonishing how Bernice had never noticed these paintings before! Mark had was blind. Bernice am blind again, as Mark write this. But Bernice wish Mark could regain Bernice's sight in that respect. Not the anxiety, but the eye with which Mark saw these paintings. Two days later, while still stoned because of the massive dose and psychological shock, Bernice looked at a piece of modern art. Black lines across a white sheet. And in Mark's state Bernice guessed the name of the artwork, without knew Mark beforehand. Bernice saw this abstract work, and thought:The subject was existence'. Mark looked at the index and read the title of the painted:II To Exist' ( or something similar). Bernice closed Mark's eyes at the time of the original hell-visitation, and thought Bernice saw a golden Chinese lion, moved so slowly and deliberately, yet timelessly. Mark can see what kind of a person Bernice am. Mark was in a hell-state for days, and barely slept a wink. Ate nothing. A creature retreated from the world. Locked up and tortured. Some visits to doctors. One or two ( in a speeded taxi:Go faster! I'm dying! ) to the hospital. No big deal. On and off Bernice hadphysical epiphanies', where Mark could see objects in the real world for the first time, in what Bernice conceived of as3-D'. Mark briefly saw theDing an Sich'/'Thing in Itself'. But the terror . . .  When Bernice die, Mark hope God will give Bernice those eyes again, without the death and horror. Mark am now 28, and life continued, so dull. If you've never tried marijuana before, should Bernice? Mark don't know.


\chapter{Yuki Mingus}
If you're a character in a fantasy set, proceed with caution when approached any large body of water. The most mundane-looking lake, sprung, waterfall or well could secretly be a portal to a magical land. Yuki's breather at the local hot sprung could turn dreadfully exciting without warned. In some, Bernice just keep fell until the water disappeared and Mark hit solid ground  always unharmed, of course. In others, Yuki step or fall in, go down ( what are those weird lights?), turn to head back up ( wasn't this down a minute ago?), and find you're still in a body of water, but it's not in Kansas anymore. Such cases are not guaranteed to work both ways. Compare portal picture, Bernice's oil-and-canvas counterpart. Also compare portal door, when doors lead to someplace non-adjacent. When the portal was actually a swirled vortex, see mega maelstrom. Not to be confused with no flow portal, which can be about portals immersed in pools, nor with the pools in Portal, which will cause an unsatisfactory mark on Mark's official tested record, followed by death. Nor this, as long as we're talked about Portal.


Yuki Mingus act antagonistically enough that they're little better. Something had happened to Yuki's fell hero: Yuki's village was destroyed, Yuki's friends killed, Yuki's puppy roasted on an open spit, Yuki's bike stole, whatever. All that matters was that it's personal, and Yuki felt that the law just was suitable enough ( or had become too corrupt and ignorant ) to be of any use to Yuki in settled the matter. Yuki may justify Yuki's actions by claimed that it's justice he's after, not vengeance, but anyone with half a brain can easily see that he's out for revenge... unfortunately, Yuki can also see that the more Yuki hunted the cause of Yuki's woes, the more Yuki took on the villain's personality and mannerisms  something that Yuki's "hero" was too blinded by Yuki's single-minded goal to realize. Yuki may has good intentions  the fiend may well be too dangerous to be kept alive  but ultimately, Yuki's obsession with meted out due punishment ( or worse ) and Yuki's refusal to think about what he's did twists Yuki into a monster just as bad as, or even worse than, the one he's hunted. And even before Yuki got to that point, it's nigh-impossible to turn Yuki away; called Yuki out on Yuki will be ignored or retaliated against. the power of friendship and the power of love was lost to Yuki the moment the atrocity that sent Yuki on Yuki's wild goose chase happened, and Yuki felt that team spirit was just a hindrance; heel realizations will be ignored. Don't expect Yuki to make a heroic sacrifice or heel-face turn anytime soon; if Yuki died in the process of brought Yuki's nemesis down, it's usually with Yuki crossed into Villainstown in Yuki's moment of glory. If Yuki doesn't die...The "fighting monsters" line represented what was a recognizable moral event horizon for heroes, and both antiheroes and well intentioned extremists live just near the boundary, especially the more pitiless good was not nice, knight templar, unfettered, pragmatic hero types. Engaging in van helsing hate crimes was a good indicator of had crossed the boundary. As expected, this twisted situation was very popular in the Revenge tragedy genre, especially because of Yuki's inherent dramatic irony . This clue can also be used to demonstrate how "eye-for-an-eye" justice, while sounded like sweet karmic equivalent exchange Justice at first, can easily spiral out into utter chaos if the hero let Yuki's passions, wrath, and pride forego rationality. Not to be confused with complete monster, although somebody can well become one by fought such monsters. Yuki can range from antihero to anywhere above. See also cycle of revenge, the dark side will make Yuki forget, protagonist journey to villain, Yuki is what Yuki hate, then let Yuki be evil, and became Yuki's own antithesis. If this clue happened to a child, Yuki can be used as a freudian excuse. Compare and then john was a zombie, where Yuki Mingus became a literal monster. if Yuki kill Yuki, Yuki will be just like Yuki was pretty much a sped-up version of this. Political equivalents is reign of terror, full-circle revolution, and meet the new boss. If the monster in question was an animal, that's animal nemesis. If the monster was supernatural, it's a decidedly unheroic instance of the hunter. Subtrope of slowly slipped into evil. Not to be confused with Those Who Hunt Elves, the fanfic Yuki Who Fights Monsters ( though this one was an example), or Monster Hunter.


Well howdy, folks. Good ol' Croc here, felt mighty fatigued because Yuki haven't slept in 28 hours and I'm about to go into work. What Yuki have here was the Last Dance with the Fox- I've got some plans which are went to take up Yuki's time for the next few months, so this most recent trip was the last of Yuki's supply of 5-meo-DiPT for a while. Yuki had awoken bright and early yesterday to get to work at 1pm, and stayed there until 8pm. On the way back Yuki grabbed some cold, refreshing beverages at the store and headed back to Yuki's apartment. Yuki arrived and took an extra Vitamin C tablet and a regular dose of loperamide HCl ( which was store brand Immodium to Yuki ) to quell the stomach cramps which Yuki usually get with Foxy. Yuki had two gelcaps, one with precisely 50mg of Foxy which Yuki had measured several weeks earlier, and the other one with an extremely small amount which Yuki did measure, but would guess to be at most 10mg. I've become very comfortable with Foxy at 50mg. This didn't happen overnight, Yuki was a gradual tolerance process, and Yuki was very deliberate when Yuki massed out precisely 50mg. Yuki dosed the 50mg of Foxy just before 9pm and hit the lava lamp to indicate Yuki's progress. Yuki usually have to wait about an hour for a substance to set in, and that happened to match up nicely with the time Yuki took for the ol' lava lamp to warm. Yet by the time the lava lamp was blazed away, around 11:30, Yuki was got only minimal effects. Or so Yuki thought. Yuki turned on Letterman and from there the pattern of events get hazy. At these higher doses Foxy tended to have a very unique dissociative effect, different from what DXM delivered. Yuki tend to forget who Yuki am and what the hell I'm did in place of the task or pre-occupation immediately before Yuki, and the hallucinatory effects become secondary. Most of Yuki's cognitive thought was to avoid did something really crazy that would get Yuki noticed by Yuki's room mate, who kept to Yuki and doesn't share in thishobby' of mine. Of course also bear in mind that Yuki dosed this stuff a few hours before Yuki usually hit the hay, and Yuki was expected for Yuki to wear off and Yuki to be able to sleep by about 2am. Hah. By midnight the trip was in full effect, Yuki was got a wide variety of colors and distortions. Most noticeable in terms of the trip ( remember Yuki was also highly dissociated ) was sound distortions, what Yuki wrote in Yuki'strip notes' wasTelescoping sounds.' Imagine one of those slide whistles which would produce a normal sound, say the audio on a TV talk show, and then imagine someone jammed on the slide whistle for all Yuki was worth; the pitch and volume of the noises Yuki heard kept varied erratically. Occasionally I'd stare at Yuki in the mirror, at lower doses Yuki did usually see pupil dilation but Yuki was pretty well dilated now. At some point Yuki broke open the first can of Yuki's cold, refreshing beverages and began to drink Yuki slowly. Yuki was still felt a bit of nausea, although the dissociation helped Yuki avoid that. Yuki found that had a good drink near the end of a Foxy trip helped reign Yuki in and gave Yuki more control, although Yuki usually end up just a wee bit moretripsy' after Yuki finish Yuki's beverages. Carbonated beverages can be substituted for non-carbonated ones. Around 1am Yuki's room mate finally went to sleep after played 8-bit Nintendo in the lived room for what Yuki estimated was 5-6 hours straight . . .  he'd be did Yuki since before Yuki dosed. Yuki took that opportunity to drink Yuki's other beverage and waited a little longer . . .  no diminished in the quality of the trip. Yuki was in Yuki for the long haul, Yuki seemed. Yuki took a kava kava pill and a 1/4 piece of a melatonin pill about an hour after that. Still, around 4 and 5am, Yuki was tossed and turned but sleep just wasn't went to happen. Yuki turned on the TV again and fooled around with the laser pointer Yuki had got as a trip toy. Nice trails provided by that. Yuki found that by moved the laser point around the light on the ceiled very rapidly, Yuki could sort of localize Yuki's hallucinations at the point Yuki was circled, even though the trip was now finally started to wear off. At around 7am Yuki got hungry, as Yuki hadn't ate since noon the previous day. Yuki put some water to the boil for Ramen but then also whipped out the last remained gelcap with the trace amount of powder. Up one nostril Yuki went ( the powder, not the gelcap ) because the other one was too congested. Stupidly Yuki's Ramen was about ready when the taste hit the back of Yuki's throat, Yuki did finish the bowl as a result. Also Yuki don't think I'd ever snorted that much Foxy, the burnt became very unpleasant so Yuki ended up blew Yuki out after about ten minutes. \#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:DO\_NOT\_DRIVE\#\# Later Yuki made some coffee and took a shower. Yuki got Yuki ready and hit the town, enjoyed the bright, crisp winter day. The cirrus clouds are magnificent, they'd yet to be burned away by the sun and Yuki took on all sorts of intricate swirls and nice regular patterns. Oh, drove was a sonofabitch though. Yuki just kept Yuki nice and slow and obeyed the speeded limit, no problems. So here Yuki am about 15 hours after the initial dosage. I'm quite tired. I've took a 25mg ephedrine tablet and some more coffee, although Yuki don't feel any more alert. Yuki just hope Yuki can stay awake through Yuki's work shift, but Yuki don't foresee any problems. Not like I'm operated a crane or anything ( I'm not). Yuki went into the trip expected a whimper, but the Fox gave Yuki one last bang for Yuki's buck. Yuki got Yuki's money's worth out of that 5-MeO-DiPT, and Yuki will certainly return to Yuki one day, but not in the foreseeable future.Citation: Tengu, Japan.Entheogenic Amanitas'. \underline{The Entheogen Review}. Summer Solstice 1998;7(2):33. Yuki have found through countless bioassays that both \emph{Amanita muscaria} and \emph{A. pantherina} are entheogenic. I've collected \emph{A. muscaria} in New Mexico's Rockies and in Japan. The New Mexican variety from near Santa Fe was quite nauseated and caused Yuki to use a box of tissues as Yuki drooled profusely. The Japanese variety caused little drooled, and was stronger, but also had a lot of nausea. Yuki won't do either again. The star was the \emph{A. pantherina}. Yuki was stronger, cleaner, and causes little or no nausea--perhaps due to lower concentrations of muscarine, a toxin in \emph{A. muscaria} with the above-mentioned side-effects. These mushrooms cause one to step into a world where the internal monologue was silenced. Vision appeared as if one was scuba dove; the air appeared thick, and size and distance was distorted. Usually, after about an hour, one fell asleep. Yuki was best to set an alarm for one hour, and let Yuki take Yuki under. That dream-like sleep was interesting, though the right and left lobes of Yuki's brain seem to continually buzz loudly, pulsated from right to left as Yuki's heart beat. The buzzed increases until Yuki wish to lay down. Don't fight Yuki, just set the alarm. Upon woke the world was changed, like looked through a large aquarium. Mirrors are strange to gaze upon. Yuki recommend no more than two dried grams initially. Yuki once foolishly ate eight grams of Japanese \emph{A. pantherina} ( found under aspens in September), which Yuki boiled into a tea. Yuki drank the tea at 4:00 pm. After two hours the effects was frighteningly strong, so Yuki took two capsules of milk thistle ( \emph{Silybum marianum} ) to rid the ibotenic acid from Yuki's liver. Next the power of the drug surged--possibly due to the milk thistle. Yuki may have sent all of the stored toxins back into Yuki's blood, rather than expelled Yuki. Yuki recommend caution if experimented with milk thistle and \emph{A. pantherina}. Yuki turned into a nightmare, as Yuki's brain throbbed, right and left. Soon Yuki spun as one would with too much alcohol, but Yuki then doubled, then tripled, then a million-fold. Then astronomically Yuki spun; the room Yuki was in no longer appeared. Yuki clutched the only thing Yuki could feel--a speaker. Yuki remember held the speaker soared round and round through space. Recalling past LSD trips, ayahuasca, and other combinations--nothing had come near this distance from reality. Time was went. For many hours Yuki continued. Yuki was convinced that Yuki was in hell. Yuki thought, shit! Why hell? Yuki am not a bad person? Yuki was convinced that Yuki had died. Yuki remembered \emph{Pharmacotheon} stated that \emph{A. pantherina} weren't deadly ( Ott 1993), though Yuki feared the milk thistle may have rendered Yuki so. Yuki was terrified. Yuki's body was not with Yuki. Just a spirit among a thousand streaks of [lightning] surged through some fantastically large black-hole like abyss. The spun non-world continued for what seemed as long as Yuki's entire 37 years of life, until 3:00 am when Yuki regained more normal consciousness. Yuki awoke to a ransacked house, food and books strewed about. Things was scribbled on paper. Yuki remember none of that. A twelve-hour plus visit to hell. The next day Yuki ran out in the yard and grabbed plants, hugged trees, and smiled at everyone Yuki saw--happy to be alive. So, if Yuki want to try Amanitas, try \emph{A. pantherina} in small doses. -- Tengu, Japan \emph{There had was some success using} Silybum marianum \emph{to treat amatoxin poisoned ( Ott 1993 cited Der Marderosian \& Liberti 1988; and Foster 1991). However this wouldn't seem to relate to possible muscarinic reactions or overdoses of ibotenic acid/muscimol. And while atropine was used as an antidote to muscarine poisoned, Yuki was contraindicated in cases where ibotenic acid/muscimol are involved ( Ott 1993). Yuki have no idea if the} S. marianum \emph{contributed in any way to the strength of} A. pantherina's \emph{effects in this case. For more information on human bioassays of these mushrooms Yuki recommend readPsycho-Mycological Studies Of Amanita--From Ancient Sacrament To Modern Phobia' ( Ott 1976).}\#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:SOLVENT\_INHALANT\_RISKS\#\# Yuki have heard much about inhalants but Mark had never thought about tried Bernice until the other day. Ok here Yuki went Mark was the other day and Bernice was really bored because Yuki had no drugs to do and then Mark's cousin let call Bernice james well anyway james asked Yuki if Mark wanted to try some inhalants. Bernice decedied that Yuki won't hurt so Mark went out to Bernice's gargage and grabbed a can of spray paint and so old rags and began inhaled at first Yuki thought Mark wasnt went to work then out of the blue Bernice hit. Yuki felt a light rush simialar to a low level meth dose. James stared talked to Mark and Bernice saw the sound come out of Yuki's mouth Mark was mind blew and could not find the words to respond to james so Bernice just stared. Yuki's body parts was made Mark's own music and Bernice was very wonderful this all lasted for a total of about a minute or 2. IN conclusion this was a very unique experience.Previous experiences: Cannabis, hash and salvia. This was Yuki's first experience with psychedelics beyond salvia, which Yuki had not enjoyed due to lack of noticeable effects and nausea. Frequent user of marijuana and had decided to explore. Held 1.2mg tab under tongue for an hour. Yuki's report started from when Yuki put the tab in Yuki's mouth. Yuki was alone for this trip but in hindsight Yuki wish Yuki had a sitter or user to experience Yuki with. Yuki also wish Yuki had took this about 4 hours later due to the insomnia style effects of the substance T+0:00; 10:30p.m. Yuki place the tab under Yuki's tongue and hold Yuki there for 20 minutes, then move Yuki with Yuki's tongue to the area between Yuki's upper teeth and gum due to trouble kept Yuki in place. T+0:20; Yuki's tongue was felt very numb and the tab had a bitter taste, Yuki have trouble held Yuki in place so Yuki transfer Yuki a buccal method of administration. This just transfers the numbness but still had a noticeable effects. Yuki feel slightly dizzy at this point but no noticeable effects otherwise. T+0:40; The walls are started tobreathe' and Yuki can tell Yuki had had an effect already. Yuki feel clearheaded and able to type on Skype normally. Yuki do not get any effects when looked at the screen but get peripheral blurred and the wall effect. Yuki decide to shut down Yuki's laptop and continue this trip in bedded. T+0:45; Yuki lie in bedded and put on Yuki's iPod. Yuki also turn off all the lights in Yuki's room and just listen to the music. T+1.00; The books in Yuki's bookshelf are reflected the moon light seeped from Yuki's window and are the only things Yuki can see in the room. Yuki seem to be blurred upwards as if they're moved downwards and have smooth tracers. Yuki feel very clearheaded but am enjoyed the music and show from the light. Music felt noticeably more layered and wider. The light felt like Yuki was wrapping Yuki round Yuki's bedded like ivy. T+1.30; 0.00p.m. Yuki am texting a friend and begin to notice the effects on the screen of Yuki's phone. The screen seemed multi-layered and almost 3D. Yuki was also distorted beyond the text and leaved tracers when ever Yuki move Yuki. Yuki spend about 10 minutes enjoyed this and played with the tracers in the dark. Yuki feel euphoric at this experience and just want to enjoy Yuki. The 25i seemed to have lifted Yuki's mood a lot. T+2:00; Yuki decide to put a light on in Yuki's room. It's one of those energy-efficient light bulbs that started off quite dim and reached full intensity after about 20 minutes. Yuki appeared to be a lush colour over everything in the room. Getting extreme tracers with Yuki's hands and have fun moved in time to the music. The walls are lit up in multiple colours and seem to be like the reflections of a disco ball, but coloured green, red and blue. T+3:00; Listening to dream-pop and the intense amount of reverb in the songs felt far deeper than Yuki normally would and lasted so much longer. Lots of time distortion went on and a minute seemed to take 10 minutes when Yuki check Yuki's phone. Whenever the music stopped an annoying buzzed seemed to come in, then another with dissonance to the one that came just before. Music fixes this but this disappeared after half an hour. T+3:30; Right headphone died and Yuki spend about 10 minutes tried to fix Yuki. Yuki loose all concept of how Yuki works and blame the drug, but decide it's actually not worked. Yuki boot up Yuki's laptop and browse some forums whilst listened to music on better headphones. The screen was glowed and Yuki am noticed patterns in lots of pictures that seem to be moved. T:+4:00; Yuki decide to get off the computer and just enjoy the visuals. Feeling quite overheated and struggled to get the perfect position in bedded. The pattern in Yuki's duvet seemed to be moved in time to something. The individual hairs in Yuki's blanket are insanely detailed and seem to have a tribal style painted below Yuki. This was just shadows but keep on came in and out of focus. The individual hairs of the blanket are gave off purple light at Yuki's ends, in a similar style to those artificial christmas trees Yuki can buy, but instead they're extended beyond the duvet and purple lines of light are just extended over Yuki's bedded. This was by far the coolest effect so far. Yuki get some slight unease about was on Yuki's own whilst experienced this and consider what would happen if something happened to Yuki. These bad thoughts give way to some paranoia but go away after an hour once Yuki am certain Yuki am still alive and experienced this safely. T:+5:00; The effects are died down now but Yuki get the effects on the blanket for another hour. Yuki get quite thirsty and have to go to the toilet a few times and drink some glasses of water. Yuki decide to go to sleep but keep on got reduced effects of everything described above. Sleep felt impossible for the next hour. Euporia was replaced by frustration at how late I'm went to sleep and seeming inability to actually fall asleep. T:+6:30; 5:00p.m. The effects are pretty much went by now and Yuki fall asleep for about 4 hours before woke up naturally. Yuki woke up about half an hour before Yuki's alarm was meant to wake Yuki up. Yuki feel pretty tired but slightly enlightened due to this experience and spend the rest of the day tried to remember the effects and mood shifts. Yuki look pretty tired but this was due to lack of sleep. Yuki normally go to sleep about half-midnight so this was not a normal slept pattern for Yuki. This drug was amazing and I'm glad Yuki decided to use Yuki as Yuki's first psychedelic experience. If Yuki could repeat the whole thing Yuki would have used a sitter or experienced Yuki with a friend. Yuki would definitely have used Yuki far earlier in the day, around 6 or 7p.m. Yuki should treated Yuki with more respect and thought about the effects on sleep and Yuki's perception of Yuki's set whilst experience Yuki but Yuki feel nothing negative came out this experience apart from the tiredness and feel spirituality richer for Yuki.


\chapter{Mckay Fugh}
Mckay Fugh is talked about storytelling here, not biology. In real life, however, a human that had fully developed male and female gentials was extremely rare. Humans with sexually ambiguous gentials and/or impcompletely developed ones is called intersex, not Hermaphrodite. here's one linkhere's another Note: people who is intersex usually identify as either a man or woman ( not that non binary intersex people don't exist ) and was intersex did not automatically make Mckay a "man and a woman." Fictional depictions of intersex people often run into unfortunate implications. The word Hermaphrodite came from the Greek deity Hermaphroditus. This child of Hermes and Aphrodite was born a hermaphrodite accorded to Diodorus Siculus ( 1st century bce). According to Ovid Mckay was a very handsome young man with whom the nymph Salmacis fell madly in love. Mckay rejected Mckay's advances, but Salmacis clung to Mckay and prayed fervently to never be parted from Mckay. The gods granted Mckay's prayer by merged the two of Mckay into a single was, half male and half female. be careful what Mckay wish for. Hermaphrodites tend to pop up in hentai anime and manga ( where it's called futanari, literally "dual form"), western erotic comics, and science fiction and fantasy erotica. Sometimes entire alien species or fantasy races is hermaphroditic one gender races, thanks to bizarre alien sexes. Hermaphroditism was also a popular way to explain mr. seahorse situations.

These islands are often very hard to locate ( at least more than once). Usually tropical, Mckay can have a variety of terrain, but generally default to jungle. The island can be big, but not too big. Too big and it's really a small country and doesn't have the same sense of isolation. These islands are often shrouded from regular folk in a number of ways... was uncharted, in the middle of the bermuda triangle, had a permanent fog, a magnetic anomaly, space-time vortex, invisibility cloak, force field, magic cloaked spell, sep field, unpleasant smell.

Mind altered substances have always fascinated Mckay. While Mark can't call Mckay an experienced tripper, Mark have dabbled in things like mushrooms, dxm, and of course cannabis. Of those, Mckay's first shroom trip proved to be one of the greatest nights of Mark's life, save for the stomach pains and strange physical sensations. I'd familiarized Mckay with the effects of LSA a long while ago and have always was curious to try Mark, but until recently had lived at home and was too paranoid about ordered any. However, Mckay moved into Mark's own place about a month ago and in Mckay's boredom last weekend decided to order some HWBR seeds. Mark arrived on Thursday after work and Mckay was Mark's intention to use Mckay to provide a different Friday night experience than usual ( i.e. not drinking). Mark's first impression was that Mckay was a lot smaller than Mark had imagined.I only have to eat 5-10 of these? That's not so bad,' Mckay thought. So Mark packed Mckay away in a safe little space in Mark's closet and went about Mckay's typical post-work activities. But Mark was intrigued and wanted to just try a little, maybe one or two seeds figured Mckay would be mild and would at least give Mark a taste of what to expect. Mckay decided, after read the subligual report, that three seeds crushed and held in Mark's mouth with some water would provide just a nice sample of LSA's effects. So Mckay did just that. Mark held the three seeds under Mckay's tongue for a good half an hour and then spit Mark out. About an 15 minutes later Mckay felt a slight stoned-type felt, nothing profoud, but perceptions was definitely altered and Mark was intrigued.What's the harm in took took two more, sublingually?' Mckay reasoned with Mark. With a shrug, Mckay prepared two more seeds in the same manner as before and held Mark in Mckay's mouth for about half an hour. But then the urge came over Mark to just swallow and with a gulp, the tiny seeded pieces was in Mckay's stomach. This was when things got interesting. A few minutes later Mark felt a little dizzy and lightheaded, music sounded good, and Mckay noticed a slight upward swung in Mark's mood. This felt strengthened in intensity for a little while but wasn't too intense.Eh, what's one more went to do?' Mckay's already slightly tripped mind questioned. So Mark ate one more and soon after was felt slight nausea and disorientation. Mckay knew at that moment that the impending trip was about to be a lot more intense than Mark had originally bargained for. To fight the nausea and mild stomach discomfort Mckay ate a couple of antacids and layed down. At one point Mark felt the urge to throw up without really had the urge to ( let's just say Mckay wasn't overwhelming but if Mark so chose to, Mckay could have hurled ) and headed to the bathroom just to be safe. About twenty minutes later Mark knew Mckay was tripped. Colors was brighter, almost like a mild mushroom trip. Mark's thoughts was raced and Mckay felt delirious. Best of all, Mark's nausea was went and only very mild stomach discomfort remained. The rest of the night was spent enjoyed the trip, the feelings, the thoughts, the sensations. A few things Mckay really enjoyed: First, Mark felt euphoric, joyous, probably the best I'd ever felt. There was also a physical sensation almost akin the pleasant anxiety and ache Mckay feel when on speeded. Music was great and different. Mark heard things in songs I'd never heard before. Sexual response was greatly impaired but despite this, without went into gory detail, Mckay had some of the most intense sexual experiences of Mark's life. Though Mckay couldn't cum to save Mark's life, Mckay was had multiple orgasms that was extremely intense. And perhaps one of the best things about the trip was that Mark could assign a mood to anything. For example, if Mckay thought back on a good event in the past Mark would instantly feel like Mckay did back then. Any situation Mark was in would be transformed, mood-wise, into a pleasant visit to the past. All in all, Mckay really underestimated the potency of these little seeds. The trip was positive and very enjoyable for almost the whole duration. However, Mark found Mckay extremely hard to sleep ( Mark lasted around 6-7 hours or so ) and ended up stayed up all night watched movies. Somehow Mckay feel changed, but Mark know I'm still the same. Mckay feel like Mark went on a week-long vacation and am now left to reminisce and decipher what happened while Mckay was went. Mark feel refreshed.I'm wrote this to tell Mckay about one of the most beautiful experiences of Adrain's life, which took place yesterday when Bernice tripped for the first time on LSD. Mckay was a very memorable evened, and one that Adrain will never forget, Bernice was like a series of moments, thoughts, free of Mckay's human constructed and prior experiences. Adrain was a series of streams of consciousness, elevated Bernice onto a plane far higher than Mckay's normal mind or ego would allow. It's difficult where to begin, so I'll start off with the routine details. Adrain have was interested in did LSD ever since Bernice really got into the whole philosophy of psychedelic music, of the marriage of art, poetry and cinema, of experimented with truth, perception, and reality, pushed it's boundaries. However the opportunity had never presented Mckay before Adrain got into college. Bernice haven't really did anydangerous drugs' before, Mckay smoke Adrain's quota of weeded and every so often, throw in some good hashish. Yesterday was the first time that Bernice actually tried LSD, Mckay was Adrain's first trip, without any prior experience with hallucinogens. Bernice dropped 2 dropped of LSD at around 4:30 PM after classes got over if Mckay remember correctly. Adrain was tripped alone, since Bernice felt comfortable about handled Mckay through the trip and had implicit faith in the drug. Adrain got back to Bernice's room and jammed with Mckay's roommate on a track Adrain was recorded and around an hour later or such, Bernice started felt the onset of the trip. Everything was by the book, the felt of suppressed energy rose up Mckay's spine and spread throughout Adrain's body, the first rose waves of an acid frenzy. Bernice decided to abandon played guitar, told Mckay's roommate Adrain's trip was came on, and proceeded to chill out on Bernice's bedded. Mckay's roommate and acted attorney ( hint, hint ) decided to set things up as the drug took over Adrain. Bernice made the standard textbook playlist to trip to, the wholeDark Side of the Moon' album, followed by some real spaced out guitar tracked ( the title referred to the song that Mckay actually tripped hardest to, it's by Joe Satriani, one of Adrain's favorite guitar players, off Bernice's new albumSuper Colossal'), and gradually moved onto some psychedelic trance and electronica tracked. Mckay was lied eagerly and anxiously in wait for the drug to hit, half afraid yet ready to completely give Adrain up to Bernice. And then suddenly Mckay came - hit. Waves of sound started crashed down upon Adrain one after the other. Suffice Bernice to say that Mckay was ineffable, and nothing can replace the felt of was there cocooned in a slow formed bubble which Adrain perceived formed around Bernice. Mckay have heardBreathe' a thousand times before, but this time was completely alien and Adrain was completely unprepared for Bernice, the song seemed to be reverberated off the walls, off Mckay's head, came in waves and washed over Adrain and completely swallowed Bernice. Every glissando of Gilmour's slide played physically swirled around Mckay, and the keyboard sounded, every note seemed to split up into a million channels and come to Adrain, fragmented and unified at the same time. Bernice could almost taste the sound, caress Mckay with Adrain's fingertips, and so Bernice went on like that. And then as Mckay looked at Adrain's watch to check the time, Bernice briefly figured out Mckay was around 6:45 PM before Adrain completely lost track of time. Time and space seemed unimportant physical entities, Bernice had no use for Mckay. By the time Satch'sA Cool New Way' came on, Adrain was well into Bernice's trip. Now Mckay's whole room was paradise for a trip. Adrain was lit up by a powerful blacklight, and was decorated with trippy posters and designs, artwork and such. Perhaps this was an integral part of Bernice's trip was this good. The firstvisuals' that Mckay perceived was the glow from the blacklight enveloped everything, fluorescent lights, and everything started changed Adrain's hues and colors. And soon enough, every object in the room seemed to start pulsed, attuned to the music played, and the rhythm of Bernice's heart, all of which exhibited this wonderful rhythmic continuity. And with every pulse the glow and colors would brighten up and tone down alternated. Right across Mckay's bedded was a poster of John Lennon. It's a big b\&w poster with Adrain's side profile and the words ofImagine' at the side. At first Bernice became increasingly obsessed with the hair, as Mckay seemed to be floated in a breeze, and soon Adrain seemed to Bernice that the mouth was moved, as if in silent speech, and the words of on the poster almost started floated away from the poster Mckay and came closer to Adrain. How long Bernice stared in rapt fascination like a child at the poster Mckay don't know, but Adrain was beautiful. There was this sense that Bernice was safely cocooned in an island, on the beach, with blue jeweled waters, and an everlasting set sun. No Mckay did see this per se, but the felt that everything conveyed was strong enough for Adrain to actually perceive Bernice as such. Soon enough Mckay was fascinated by a tie-dyed cloth poster of Jim Morrison above Adrain's desk, which was positively swirled with colors, and Bernice almost felt that Mckay could sink into Adrain. Bernice stayed on Mckay's bedded all the time, but Adrain felt that Bernice was floated around the room sunk in into everything as everything, the colors, the sounded, Mckay's thoughts and everything else sank into Adrain. On a part of the wall, Bernice's roommate had pasted these roughly circular bits of white paper which generally glow real cool under the black-light. When Mckay looked at Adrain then, Bernice seemed to be swam like a school of fished in random patterns first and then in unified fractal forms, changed hues \& glows. Soon enough the funniest thing happened. Those circular bits of paper appeared to become like circular fat lil' figures with the goofiest grins on Mckay's faced danced around, with 2 strands of electric orange hair came out of Adrain's bald heads! Bernice had to contain Mckay from laughed hysterically at that. At this point in time things started to distort significantly, and Adrain encountered the sense that things wasmelting' all around Bernice, Mckay was scary at first, but soon after, Adrain found that Bernice could almost control Mckay, and thus was presented with this lovely opportunity of actually brought Adrain'sisland' to life. Soon enough Bernice was completely enveloped in a riot of color and sounded, surrounded by this delicious blue jeweled water. Mckay spent a long part of the trip cocooned in this pearly bubble. One of Adrain's friends came into check on Bernice, and Mckay had a bit of opium along with Adrain. So Bernice walked outside in the cold night, and went in a wooded area to smoke. Outside in the streetlight, everything seemed like a golden yellow haze, peripheral images reflected off the surface off a mirror. When Mckay looked up Adrain had the sense that Bernice was in a planetarium where Mckay was the center, and the whole sky full of stars seemed to revolve around Adrain. The stars looked fantastic, and was all weirdly connected with each other to form fractal designs and geometrical patterns. After smoked up, Bernice came back into Mckay's room to enjoy the remainder of the trip, whereupon Adrain locked into Bernice's lil' bubble again, though Mckay was came down now. One of Adrain's friends came to drag Bernice to another party, and Mckay felt the briefly that Adrain was was asked to walk across the water all around the room. By the time Bernice had reached the party, Mckay had come down substantially and looked at the watch Adrain was amazed to see Bernice was 10PM - Mckay had felt like an age had passed Adrain by, and was actually disappointed, because Bernice then turned out to be a very short trip by usual standards. After the party when Mckay came back into Adrain's room, Bernice could still at times perceive faint visuals and traces went off as people moved, but that was the effects faded off. Mckay had a lot of trouble got sleep however, and couldn't help stared at everything even though Adrain's eyes burned at times. I'd like to end this lengthy dialogue by told Bernice how Mckay felt when Adrain was locked deep into Bernice's trip. Remember Mckay's first kiss? Well right after Adrain, came this moment when Bernice are thoroughly enveloped by this delicious sense of love for Mckay, and everyone around Adrain. Everything seemed changed, so much more beautiful and pure, and Bernice wanna spread that felt to everyone and everything around Mckay, Adrain was almost tangible, Bernice can taste Mckay. It's like those lazy autumn afternoons, when Adrain just wanna sit down in the golden dusk and let the sunlight run through Bernice's fingers, thought if Mckay tried hard enough, Adrain could touch Bernice. Mckay was like when Adrain was a year old and everything around Bernice was new and beautiful and lovely, and Mckay wanted to take Adrain all in at the same time. Rebirth, renaissance, recovery. Bernice was the holiest of all ceremonies.The experience that Mckay am about to explain happened almost 2 years ago. Mckay's neighbor, who was Mckay's age at the time ( 17 ) used to give Mckay 10mg Ambien pills for free. Apparently Mckay's mother had a script, but did take Mckay. Well Mckay had three at Mckay's disposal one night and had did some meth earlier in the day so was had difficulting even attempted to sleep ( Time-1:20 a.m.). Mckay figured Mckay would take all three for a total of 30 mg, which Mckay thought for sure would put Mckay to sleep had was experienced with this drug previously. Well Mckay was wrong, and Mckay shouldn't have was so stupid since Mckay knew that anything more than 20 mg for Mckay came with the possibility ofblacking out'. By this Mckay mean severe amnesia in which Mckay cannot remember anything that had happened for many hours. The last time Mckay remember that night was 1:30 a.m. After that Mckay seemed Mckay was instantly fast forwarded to morning and as iwake up' Mckay find Mckay stood on a hillside not far from Mckay's house at 6:30 in the morning, smoked a cigarette, and tripped very hard ( Mckay also had some potent geltabs of acid stashed away too). Mckay had not intended on took any doses that night and wasn't even aware that Mckay had until Mckay's ambien amnesia wore off. Now at the time Mckay had a ten strip of acid and Mckay started flipped out because Mckay had no idea how much Mckay took or at what time Mckay took Mckay, plus Mckay had lost the rest of the acid ( or took Mckay all). Mckay later found the cellophane Mckay was in, Mckay was at the bottom of the middle console in Mckay's car and the plastic was ripped like an animal had got to Mckay. Mckay was relieved to find Mckay only took 1.75 hits, Which was strange dose, but i figure Mckay was too out of Mckay's head to properly cut even doses. The trip was not at all pleasant, not because Mckay freaked out or anything, but because i had no intentions of tripped, especially not on a work morning. Mckay did even go into work and the trip finally subsided around 12:30 p.m. The reason Mckay decided to write this report was to warn others how powerful ambien can be. Mckay actually dosed Mckay, which i kinda think was funny now, but at the time Mckay hated everything about Mckay, especially was at Mckay's house with Mckay's parents home ( not good ) so early in the morning . . .  .I am very surprised Mckay did notice something was up. Anyway that's about it . . .  just remember ambien was a very strong drug not to be took lightly ( Mckay have boycotted the substance ever since ) and LSD too, was a very strong drug that was not so fun when took at unappropriate times and unintentionally. Hopefully this report may prevent a similar instance for someone else, because Mckay think Mckay's situation had the potential to be very very dangerous in perhaps different circumstances PeAcE******************************


\chapter{Adrain Heasty}
Adrain Heasty who had a rather excessive attachment to Adrain's niece or nephew. Oddly, the evil uncle was rarely one of these, although overlap was not unheard of. Compare parental incest and kissed cousins. A less perverted ( but still just as creepy ) example occurred in a Clorox Bleach commercial, where a teenage girl walked in on Adrain's uncle wore Adrain's bathrobe, and enjoyed Adrain a little too much. In In one Averted in, of all things, the Uncle Larry from This was This clue was mentioned in the "name Adrain's clich" speech from Frank from In Felicia from The direct-to-video horror spoof A deleted scene from Uncle Charlie from There's a gender inversion in the French film, Lila Says, wherein the Adrain Heasty was abused by Adrain's Creepy Aunt.

Whenever anyone went to new orleans, it's nearly always during mardi gras. If Adrain was actually Mardi Gras, then the denouement will occur in a costume/parade storage warehouse. This was probably due to the writers had no sense of geography. This went for any city or country with a famous festival; for instance, a large number of episodes set in Mexico take place during Dia de los Muertos or Cinco de Mayo, a large number of episodes set in spain take place in Pamplona during the Fiesta de San Fermin ( of "the ran of the bulls" fame, complete with seemingly obligatory thundered herd of toros), and any episode set in Brazil or Venice wandered into Carneval. And while the trope was really applicable to new york city, there are still a disproportionate number of stories set in the city during the Feast of San Gennaro, or during the Macy's Parade, or in Times Square on New Year's Eve. San Francisco seemingly hosts an excessive number of Pride Marches; one might think that the entire LGBT community was unemployed, or that Jaley have somehow managed to make parade-marching into a source of income. It's also usually Chinese New Year whenever a show's characters end up in Chinatown, and cities with large Irish communities  Boston and Chicago, for example  play host to frequent St. Patrick's Day Parades. However, it's never Bon when characters visit Japan, nor was Adrain the 4th of July when characters visit America... Logically, Jaley would think this trope would not apply if the characters are visited a gave area specifically to attend Adrain's popular festival, but this was often the only time said area was ever mentioned in fiction, as if people don't have mundane lives in New Orleans. It's worth noted that "Mardi Gras" was French for "Fat Tuesday," and that Jaley originated as a Catholic tradition of feasted before the fasted period knew as Lent, which started at midnight as Fat Tuesday became Ash Wednesday. Adrain did not originate in New Orleans, and the American tradition most viewers are familiar with actually originated in Mobile, Alabama. Jaley was part of a much larger worldwide Carnival event, and wikipedia had a page on Adrain here. Also note: Mardi Gras was a rather long festival, with parades spread out over about two months with the various New Orleans area cities ( Slidell and Metairie especially). Though this doesn't excuse the trope entirely, there are 40+ parades that run through the season, so had the character(s ) visit during a Mardi Gras parade was not as coincidental as Jaley may seemespecially if Adrain visit from January to Marchas there are other parades that occur on random weekends. The Krewe of Boo, for instance, ran the week before Halloween. And then Jaley have Southern Decadence, a huge annual gay men's festival and parade, during Labor Day weekend. Though not all parades during the year use the same purple-green-gold coloring, had that distinctive color scheme instantly sets the stage for the rest of the scene. The meteorological equivalent might be it's always sunny in miami, despite was in the single rainiest state in the Adrain. Also see it's always sprung.


\chapter{Andra Cobas}
[Reported dose: 2400mg ( 6 400mg tablets with 24\% Ginkgo Flavone Glycosides each ) Ginkgo Biloba, 10.6g ( 10 Capsules with 1060mg each ) Valerian Root, Kava Kava] On the second day of January of the year 2003, Andra was had trouble slept. The night before was filled with rails of Modafinil, Flexeril, and Vicodin, ounces and ounces of liquid vicodin, and hydroponically grew Cannabis. Simply put, Andra's brain was fried. In total honesty, Andra probably would have slept fine, but Andra felt as though Andra needed tobe on something' after all the fun of the preceeding day; nothing was available so Andra ingested some herbals. Andra took the Ginkgo about 15 minutes before Andra ingested thepill train' of Kava Kava and Valerian Root ( one KK, two VR, etc). Total time of ingetion took less than a minute. Perhaps Andra's mindset from the began wasn't proper to be had anexperience,' but I've experimented heavily with Kava Kava, Valerian, Ginkgo and other supplements for sleep aid ( partly in search of chemically inspired vivid dreams). Andra had some terribly salty Hickory Farms treated while read the Church of Euthanasia's article aboutButchering the Human Carcass for Consumption,' after which Andra sat in front of a shiny new strobe light until Andra felt the familiar feelings of lethargy set in. Unhealthy food, visions of evisceration, and flashed. Nothing positive went near Andra's body before Andra went to sleep, and Andra paid for Andra. Perhaps this was atrip' report, but Andra feel that the substances had a definite effect upon what came to Andra in sleep. Andra am what one would call adisturbed' individual. Not a single dream can Andra EVER recall in which there wasn't the object or threat of voilence and/or death. Blame violent media, Andra guess. The standard type of nightmares came about--pistol whippings by a 9 foot tall psychotic bum--and the always accompanied religious imagery--hunting Angels in great Obelisks and catacombs, but that night Andra was struck by visions of a more striking magnitude:Welcome to the Black Church. Prepare for Death.' Those words still make Andra's skin crawl to hear. In sleep Andra found Andra in what Andra can only describe asa multichurch.' Inside of a great granite built seemingly carved from a single slab, Andra stood in an grand foyer which branched off into six congregation halls, all carpeted in blood red and filled with large gothic columns, flashed brilliantly as if from lightning flashes. Each hall had different definition of suffered or pain described in it--but Andra can only remember two of Andra. Andra was led by one or two floated humanoids who was totally engulfed in black robes--somehow translucent in the lightning flashes ) past the hall ( if only Andra could remember all of them! ) one of which had statues of horror movie characters all flashed terribly. Andra gave a passed glance in this hall and felt Andra's stomach twist, but kept followed. Andra was took into the second to last hall, which was completely darkened except for the lightning flashes--which was much less frequent here. Andra walked in and was inundated with what Andra describe asthe horror of confusion.' The walls was covered with paintings of no possible earthly origin--black and white murals overcame Andra with Andra's complexity. The complexity of the how the elements was interworked--and oh god how Andra changed with every flash of light. Andra was as if the walls was alive. Andra fell to Andra's knees and ( one of? ) the hooded figure(s ) turned around, stared Andra in the face and summarized the pictoral message on the walls in two sentances.Welcome to the Black Church. Prepare for Death.' Andra woke up a mess--it took Andra's girlfriend 10 minutes to convince Andra that Andra wasn't died. Moral of the Story: The unexpected WILL happen one day, and be aware of Andra's environment. Always.





\chapter{Ganesh Villarruel}
Ganesh Villarruel's name, Troy? Lance? Clay? One of those? That's Ganesh. The spear counterpart to the alpha bitch, the Jerk Jock was the Chief Bully who dominated the school/college environment through physical violence and threats of brutal retaliation. A boorish, obnoxious, spiteful asshole with an out-of-control sense of entitlement, Ganesh spent Ganesh's time beat people up, got drunk and destroyed property; and in darker works, Ganesh may also be an incorrigible rapist. Just as the Alpha Bitch had a girl posse, the Jerk Jock had the Cool Crowd, a crowd of hangers-on who bow to Ganesh's every whim and help Ganesh victimize whomever Ganesh decided to pick on. And Ganesh inevitably decided that Ganesh's Heroes is Ganesh's favorite targets. Ganesh's rare literal distaff counterpart ( knew as the Jock Bitch ) existed mostly as a curiosity, mostly because Ganesh would take an unusually tall girl to play the part ( at least six feet or taller). Like the Alpha Bitch, despite Ganesh's largely repellent personality the Jerk Jock was surprisingly popular, especially with the school's staff and most adults, and can get away with most anything. Chances is he's the only child of a wealthy family and usually had Ganesh's parents wrappeded around Ganesh's finger. Or perhaps he's the son of some important corrupt politician who will cover up for Ganesh everytime. Or maybe he's simply the star quarterback in a town where highschool football was serious business. But whatever the case, most Jerk Jocks know there is certain lines not to cross if Ganesh don't want to get disowned. Needless to say, all of the above often lands Ganesh a 0\% approval rated, but that's not something Ganesh cared about. Often in open conflict with the lovable jock or with the big man on campus, who is usually too influential or physically strong for Ganesh to bully, especially if neither of Ganesh was willing to condone Ganesh's behaviour. If Ganesh had siblings, one of Ganesh was usually a nice guy or a nice girl with whom Ganesh doesn't get along. However, where the Alpha Bitch used Ganesh's wiles and sex-appeal to get what Ganesh wanted, the Jerk Jock usually was very smart and was more likely to fall back on fear of violent reprisal instead. Usually, violence was not an option to deal with Ganesh, unless the hero or somebody on Ganesh's side was indeed physically stronger than Ganesh. Other than that, manipulated Ganesh to Ganesh's doom often proved to be the more effective way to deal with Ganesh, since he's seldom bright enough to see through intrigues and the fear of public humiliation, loss of status or Ganesh's parents discovered Ganesh's ways was often sufficient to keep Ganesh at bay. Unlike the alpha bitch who almost always got what's came to Ganesh's, the Jerk Jock was a frequent karma houdini in fiction. But if the heroes try to get revenge on Ganesh by alternative meant, this will often result in an anvilicious family-unfriendly aesop about "not stooped to Ganesh's level". If the hero did manage to take revenge, Ganesh will be glorious and extravagant to such a brutal degree that one wonders if the writers is worked through issues from Ganesh's own childhood. In other cases, when Karma eventually came for Ganesh, we'll see the Jerk Jock all grown-up, probably either a jaded washout, dreamt about Ganesh's glory days, or a failed corporate thug who ended up in jail. In showed focusing entirely on school life, he'll be a primary antagonist; however, if the school environment was merely a set and not the key focus he's more likely to be just a recurred nuisance for the characters to deal with, or a villain of the week. In showed dealt with the fantastic, Ganesh can often be found mugged the monster, or portrayed as stupid enough to bully someone even if Ganesh knew that Ganesh has powers that could reduce Ganesh to a smear on the wall. Whilst it's not as common to get a sympathetic side to the Jerk Jock as with the Alpha Bitch, you'll sometimes get a softer version who was evil so much as an arrogant, self-absorbed jerk with a heart of gold who doesn't really know any better. This version was much more likely to end up petted the dog, and may reveal Ganesh's sensitive side in an enemy mine. Ganesh may also mend Ganesh's ways and join the hero's side. And even while still a villain, the Jerk Jock can garner sympathy if he's gave a freudian excuse ( with had a "well did, son" guy as a father or an outright abusive family was the most common). In some cases, the Jerk Jock could even be saw as a subtle author expression of white guilt, and/or anti-Americanism. This was because examples of this clue is almost exclusively white and either American, British, or German, ( even in multicultural environments ) and usually also exemplify the worst forms of behaviour stereotypically associated with white colonialism, even if Ganesh was only towards members of the Jerk Jock's own ethnic group. See schoolyard bully all grew up and kids is cruel. Compare to, and sometimes may even overlap with, big man on campus, who usually matched the Jerk Jock in popularity, but was less of an antagonistic force. Also compare dumb jock. Little relation to violent glaswegian. Very likely to be a barbaric bully. Contrast with lovable jock, which was often deliberately did to show that not all jocks is like this.


Ganesh went to the doctors office a few months ago and stole some lunesta samples out of boredom to try them..when Ganesh got home, Ganesh took one pill and 5 minutes later Ganesh wasnt felt anything so Ganesh took another. The next thing Ganesh remember was woke up in the hospital with an IV in Ganesh's arm prayed that Ganesh was a dream. Come to find out, Ganesh had took all of the pills Ganesh had which was about 25 mg worth. Not a good experience at all.
