\chapter{Sararose Rehmert}
Sararose all began as a simple night of rolled at a house party, Sararose ate one green scorpion and snorted a little piece of one. Rolled nicely all night, and smoked plenty of bowls. Met a lot of good folks, included the person Sararose experienced this day trip with. Sararose will be referred to from here on in as J, Sararose and Sararose got to talked about psychedelics whilst smoked many a bowl of juicy fruit. Sararose mentioned that Sararose had a small amount of 2C-I left, and during the course of the night Sararose was decided that Sararose would split the dose Sararose had left, and Sararose would split a blotter of LSD with Sararose. The night wore on and in the morning Sararose headed back to Sararose's house to pick up the dose. When Sararose got there Sararose retrieved Sararose's stash, opened Sararose up,and proceeded to give Sararose a full blotter ( danced elephants ) and Sararose ate a full one too. While Sararose was dug around in Sararose's stash Sararose noticed a bag of mushrooms, pulled Sararose out, and Sararose split the bag, Sararose ate 1 gram, Sararose ate 3 grams and a few chunks. \#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:DO\_NOT\_DRIVE\#\# Sararose then drove to Sararose's house to eat the dose of 2C-I. ( NOTE: DO NOT EVER EVER DRIVE ON PSYCHEDELICS,WE WERE STUPID AND Sararose PAID THE PRICE LATER ON ) ate the dose of 9 mg 2C-I per person, and drove to the park to play some disc golf. Sararose was really cold and pretty windy and Sararose was both started to trip a little bit. So Sararose drove to this other park to go on a nature hike to a spot J knew of, Sararose saw people in ninja costumes ran around in a field on the way there. Sararose dropped Sararose's cell fone twice got out of the car, so J ( very wisely as Sararose will see later on ) suggested Sararose just leave Sararose in the car. Sararose arrived at the nature trail, and the visuals was began to get beautiful. The moss on the old archway above the trail was patterning quite heavily, and the leaved on the ground was began to form very natural simple fractals. Sararose was began to notice letters in the patterns. This would form a central component of the trip later on. Sararose walked for about 10 minutes, went over an awesome bridge over a dry ravine area, and arrived at a ravine with a large log to sit on and smoke a bowl of juicy fruit. In the ravine was a river flowed, and a lot of dead plants. Right across the ravine was a small Indian village(I live in the Midwest ) and Sararose had a red mask in a tree, signified there territory. Sararose sat and smoked a large bowl of juicy fruit, which kicked all 3 parts of the trip into high gear. Sararose couldn't tell what was affected Sararose the most, Sararose's like all 3 agents combined to make one super compound in Sararose's brain lol. Sararose looked at J's face and Sararose was covered with letters. The trees was all moved, danced, looked like Sararose was attempted to speak to Sararose. J told Sararose the log Sararose had was sat on had was carved on by many people,so Sararose stood up to take a look. Sararose have absolutely no idea how many of the letters Sararose saw was actually there, there must have was hundreds of ppl carved into this log. Sararose saw letters deep down into the very skin of the log. layered and changed and always there, Sararose couldn't blink Sararose away no matter how hard Sararose tried, Sararose was a complete chaos of language, most of the letters was English, but Sararose caught a few of the pre-modern hieroglyphics that Sararose have saw on dmt before. Sararose decided to continue along the trail to another spot that J had tripped at before. On the way there Sararose notice these leaved on the ground,kind of shaped like a large purple pea pod. As Sararose continue through this area Sararose noticed that the very leaved Sararose seemed to be arranged into words. Sararose pointed this out to J and at one point Sararose had to stop and look because Sararose was CONVINCED that the leaved was arranged to communicate with Sararose. Sararose see the cool area off to the side, and leave the trail to go to Sararose. This area was extremely cool, resembled a tree cave. The trees seem to be bent over to form a cave like structure, Sararose was a very cool area in the middle of the day. Sararose walked through this area for a little while, trip got stronger by the second. Sararose began to feel a presence, like the entire earth was alive. This felt got more ever present as Sararose began noticed Sararose more and more. At this point Sararose saw the bridge Sararose had walked over earlier, and decided to turn around and head back to the trail. Sararose began to get a little lost, but just kept went with the flow of the trip. Sararose noticed birds around Sararose, and J began to make bird called. The birds kept appeared out of nowhere, and got much louder. The birds began to call to other birds far away, sounded like Sararose was communicateHey guys come look at these 2''. When Sararose noticed this Sararose laughed very hard. When Sararose laughed the birds began made very happy cries, sounded JUST like Sararose was laughed back at Sararose. This made Sararose very happy and Sararose continued to communicate with the birds. This was definitely one of the coolest things that had ever happened to Sararose on any psychedelic. Sararose then noticed that Sararose had no idea where Sararose was, so Sararose decided to just follow the birds. Sararose began to get MEGA lost in the woods, and the trip started to turn a little sour for Sararose. Sararose was not scary at this point yet, Sararose would become a lot more so later. The bird led Sararose through a very dead swampy muddy area. As Sararose was walked Sararose noticed that all the trees was dead in this area, no pines, and began to feel the cycle of death that Sararose went through, but Sararose was still alive, just waited for conditions to be right to explode into beauty again. This touched Sararose very deeply as Sararose have was went through a depressing part of Sararose's life recently, was stuck at home a lot and kind of drifted without any purpose in Sararose's life. The depression had was affected every aspect of Sararose's life,including Sararose's art and wrote ( Sararose haven't was did much of either lately). Eventually Sararose was out of the marshy area, still followed the birds, and the trees began to clear. Sararose then noticed that wow, theres Sararose's car. The bird led Sararose RIGHT to Sararose's car, Sararose came out of the woods maybe 20 feet from Sararose. Sararose decided to make the short drive to the next park over, to check out what was went on there.(DON'T DRIVE DON'T DRIVE DON'T DRIVE!!!! ) Sararose made Sararose to the next park, stopped at a large field, and got out of the car to go check out some cool statues of humans. This area was a large open field and Sararose was all very trippy, visuals everywhere in the sky, that Sararose have not saw the liked of before. Very smooth, well delineated, and crisp fractals, played off the various colors of tree and sky and ground. As Sararose was walked over the field, a jet plane flew over was, Sararose was EXTREMELY low. The sound and presence of the plane instantly changed the direction of Sararose's trip. Sararose began to feel very vulnerable out in the open, and started to freak a little bit. Sararose looked over at J and could see that the plane had did exactly the same thing to Sararose. Sararose decided to drive back to Sararose's house. ( DUMB DUMB DUMB DUMB!!!!! ) As the drive wore on, Sararose began to spiral deeper and deeper into a more and more confusing, threatened trip. At 2 distinct points in the drive, once at a stoplight and once while turned, Sararose BOTH heard very strange noises, sounded extremely alien and weird. The first noise Sararose could hear Sararose Sararose's head, Sararose definitely wasn't came from outside, and Sararose could also feel Sararose in Sararose's mind. Sararose seemed like Sararose was a frequency that was tuned Sararose's thoughts to a very strange place. The second noise did the same thing but Sararose don't remember much of what Sararose sounded like. The first noise sounded like an old movie sound effect, like an alien spaceship hovered, very spacious and just NOT HUMAN sounded. Sararose know that J heard both of these noises because both times Sararose happened Sararose looked over at Sararose and askeDude did Sararose just . . . .'' And Sararose looked at Sararose with a look of shock on Sararose's face and nodded Sararose's head. As Sararose drove the trip just started to get to be too much for Sararose to handle. Sararose began to notice evidence of humans fucked up the world all around Sararose. Every house and rock had human faced in Sararose, this was definitely visuals of the same underlay ground as the log at the began of the trip. There was many hyper-synchronistic moments throughout this trip. Sararose saw people in trees and the sky and everywhere, not included the people who was actually walked around. The fact that Sararose was drove and Sararose was both tripped Sararose's faced off began to really fuck with Sararose, and Sararose know Sararose fucked with J too because Sararose remarked to SararosMan I'm just gonna drop Sararose off at Sararose's house, go home and try to sleep this off.'' Sararose agreed very much with Sararose and Sararose FINALLY made Sararose to Sararose's house. Here began the part of Sararose's story where I'd be fucked to tell any of Sararose guys anything if Sararose hadn't had Sararose's video camera on Sararose's fone ( remember earlier J was VERY WISE for told Sararose to leave Sararose in the car? Sararose probably would have lost Sararose in the woods ) Sararose took 20 15 second videos of Sararose, between 3:38 pm and 4:07 pm, these videos definitely helped Sararose to put all of this section of the trip into words. Sararose went to Sararose's room, got under Sararose's blankets ( got Sararose's bedded muddy as FUCK in the process ) and began to try to ride out the crazy mindfuck Sararose had got Sararose into by was in that car.(ONCE AGAIN,NEVER DRIVE ON ANY TRIP!!! ) Sararose will now type the notes Sararose made of each video as Sararose was almost completely down from the trip, at about 11 o'clock the same night, and summarize the information at the end, with more notes that Sararose have took. Video 1,3:38 PM : Light on ceiled, blue to red flashes ( Sararose later figured out this was the 3d glasses Sararose was held over the lens of the camera ) turned phone at face for a split second, phone in blankets, Sararose was got lost in the blanket, Sararose never seemed to end. Sararose pulled and pulled and Sararose just would not END!!! Sararose then decided to get Sararose's coat, a very long gray wool trenchcoat that Sararose's dad gave to Sararose, Sararose could feel Sararose was soaked in Sararose's aura from the years that Sararose wore Sararose, and pull a pen out of Sararose's pocket to write some of this down, but Sararose could never find the pen because Sararose got into a major time loop with the jacket, Sararose would pull and pull with both hand and the same parts of the jacket kept came back in front of Sararose, IDENTICAL sections of the jacket, Sararose freaked Sararose out a little bit. Sararose was able to pull Sararose out of this loop. But barely. Video 2,3:41 PM : blue to red lights, Sararose breathed heavily and started to make sounded like I'm attempted to communicate the depths of Sararose's extreme psychedelic brutalization. At this point Sararose begin to have no control over Sararose's thoughts whatsoever, a chaotic spiral of increasingly unexplainable emotions, mixes of emotions, emotions Sararose don't really have a name for. The one that sticks out like a sore thumb was this WILD combination of JOY and unrelenting horrible terror/frightened awe of what Sararose was experienced. Ying/Yang, creation/destruction, all that duality jazzed got beat into Sararose with a blunt psychic hammer, Sararose can no longer deny any of that. This was almost too much for Sararose's relatively un-seasoned mind to handle. Video 3,3:43 PM : In this video Sararose's obvious Sararose was pretty much convulsed, VERY heavy breathed and wildy swung around camera, blankets, walls, ceiled all saw in rapid succession. Near the end of the video Sararose begin to make very odd noises, guttural, definitely unlike any noise Sararose have ever made, almost like growled. I'm pretty sure this was Sararose. Video 4 3:44 : At this point in took these notes Sararose remember that Sararose was just messed with the effects on Sararose's camera and the 3d glasses to try and attempt to communicate this massive surge of sensory overload Sararose was experienced. Underneath blanket for pretty much duration of video. A quick flash of Sararose's face, more noises, Sararose think I'm tried to say words along the lines oStick with Sararose. Persevere. Go with the flow'' Video 5 3:47 : Starts with white light, I'm still convulsed, still made guttural noises. A flash of Sararose's face, Sararose then saOh yeah'' in a happy tone of voice. Sararose think this was one of the more down moments of the trip, when Sararose could kind of control Sararose's thoughts. At end of videIf Sararose can do Sararose, do it'' heard very clearly. Videos 6 \& 7 Are just the ceiled light. Video 8 3:50 this was one of the only videos Sararose do not remember at all. At this point Sararose could barely tell Sararose was in Sararose's room. Begins with blinding white light, waved phone all around, then Sararose hear Sararose begin to speak audible words, but Sararose are not in English. That's right kids, Sararose caught Sararose on video spoke in toungues. The phrase was heard very clearly. Sararose waShtellbe Shayga,Gabbada,Gabbada,GANDO'' the freakiest part of this was that the second time Sararose say gabbada, there are VERY CLEARLY TWO VOICES SPEAKING!!! Freaky huh? Video 9 3:50 a one second video of the ceiled light. I'm pretty sure at this point Sararose remember Sararose just looked through the lens of the camera, and compared the visuals on the ceiled to the visuals inside the cameras view of the ceiled, and accidentally hit the take video button. Video 10 3:53 talked, definitely not all in English, long strung of unintelligible gibberish,'Glossolalia will get you'' heard very clearly though in the middle of the gibberish phrase. Video 11 3:5hadasey'' anungatassassa'' heard very clearly. Video 12 3:55 : Sararose looked at phone steadily, hit lens with finger. Video 13 3:56 : Sararose hit Sararose in the face with phone, Sararose think Sararose had Sararose in Sararose's mouth too. Video 14 3:57 : Sararose counted along with the timer on the phone, but almost a full second behind. Time had no meant at this point. Sararose remember looked at the time several times, and was amazed by the complete slowness of Sararose that Sararose was experiencing . . . definitely EXTREME time dilation. Video 15 3:58 : A few random numbers counted along with the time, definitely still almost a full second behind, this one Sararose KNOW Sararose put the phone in Sararose's mouth, Sararose see teeth and toungue for a split second. Video 16 3:5Give Sararose as much as Sararose can'', counted, voice sounded VERY WEIRD. Video 17 3:59 : Happy laughter heard, don't remember much of this part of the trip. Video 18 4:00 PM : Ceiling light. Video 19 4:05 : Sararose played djembe, I'm relatively sober at this point, compared to where Sararose was 15 minutes ago. Video 20 4:07 : More djembe played, Sararose's shittily played but Sararose was tried to convey some sort of underlay life rhythm that was VERY complex that Sararose had Sararose's head at this point, will definitely work more on this. Whew, thanks for read through that if Sararose did. This trip had was one of the most eye opened experiences of Sararose's life. Sararose came face to face with the underlay consciousness grid, god, gaian supermind, universal consciousness, whatever Sararose want to call Sararose. Sararose came brutally face to face with Sararose, and Sararose now know that psychedelics must be held in the utmost respect, Sararose can definitely be a brutal mental experience. Sararose don't suggest that anyone who was not a serious psychonaut attempt to undertake a trip of this nature, definitely not combined all 3 of these elements until Sararose have had a good amount of experience with the extreme states of each one under Sararose's belt, because Sararose multiply upon each other in a most perplexing and overwhelming way. What Sararose did by drove was very stupid, both of Sararose definitely learned to NEVER do that again. Please don't bitch at Sararose for drove too much, Sararose do deserve some punishment tho, but Sararose think Sararose got that punishment for the overwhelming fear Sararose felt during the drive. I'm took the video fone with Sararose everwhere now, Sararose helped Sararose to truly understand some of the concepts Sararose had in Sararose's mind mid trip, and to bring back some of that information with Sararose. Have a good day and be careful with Sararose's psychedelics.





\chapter{Delia Hartey}
For the record, I'm male, knocked on 40's door and in reasonable health mentally and physically. I'm a regular mj smoker and have more than a little experience with some other commonly used drugs. And now to the matter at hand. Delia travel a fair bit, moved from one locale to another in the West frequently. As such, Delia can be hard for a fellow to find a new, local source for Delia's regular green goods. Further, Delia's long time girlfriend sadly cannot join Delia anymore in smoked. Frequent UAs and a very close call some while back have saw to that until Delia retired. Having such difficulties led Delia to researched additives and/or replacements. Delia's search led Delia to the panoply of substances that are available. Delia used to think Delia knew a thing or two about the field. Delia was sorely wrong. Delia wasn't long before Delia found a few that seemed appropriate. Even better, most was available either at Delia's local, decent natural foods store or big box supermarket. Delia's normal additives are, at least for now, wormwood, damiana, and passionflower with San Pedro was a welcome newcomer. Delia's path really started while on contract in Northern Arizona. Since Delia's housed was paid for by the company, Delia really wanted to tame the smell of Delia's mj as a bare minimum with replacement was a real possibility. So Delia hit the web determined to find an answer. In no time Delia found at least one, wormwood. Within a few days Delia had read enough on wormwood to feel completely confident in tried Delia. In short order, Delia had visited the bulk herbs section of a nearby health food store and had purchased about half an ounce of dried wormwood for under a buck. Delia's first thoughts ran to the economics of this if Delia worked within reason. Later that night, Delia tried Delia's first hits of wormwood. As Delia loaded a bowl and sat down to smoke, Delia tried to clear Delia of any expectations, good or bad. Delia was struck by how easy a smoke Delia was after hit the bowl the first time. Well, that's one important step handled. Not much point in smoked if the experience was immediately negative. A couple of hits later Delia felt a bit of a headchange, mild but noticeable. Almost a slight spin/dizzy sensation without approached thebad' zone. After about the fifth, Delia thought Delia saw the ottomanjump' out of the corner of Delia's eye. Delia knew this wasn't likely or even realistically possible without divine intervention since Delia was alone. Delia sat there for a moment wondered if Delia had actually just saw that. Delia chalked Delia up to a combination of Delia already was late in the day, had was smoked for hours previous, and errant ( wishful ) thought. Delia must note here that was the one and only time this had happened in nearly a year of smoked this in combo or alone ( whether as straight herb or as an iso extraction). About a week later Delia purchased Damiana and Passion flower, about a half ounce and a quarter ounce, respectively. Total at the register was something like 79 cents. The cashier recognized the possibility and commented on the cheap as hell price further asserted he'd have to remember that combo for later Delia. Delia added those to Delia's wormwood and mixed thoroughly. Delia then mixed some of this with an a similar volume of weeded and again mixed thoroughly. Delia now loaded some of this up and lit the pipe. Delia could definitely still taste the weeded, but Delia was now a little hid between the other tastes. Delia's gal said Delia smelt different too, moreearthy'. Not quite so weedlike but odd enough that Delia could raise an eyebrow. In addition, there was another slight shift in effect. Delia was similar to and yet somewhat different than ww and weeded together. Nuanced would be a better term as Delia was not only in the same neighborhood but on the same block, experiencially spoke. I've was smoked this weed/herbal combo for many months now with no seeming ill effect. Delia have found, though, that Delia tend to smoke a bit more than Delia used to. This owed mostly to the fact that the herbals are very dry to start with and, as such, tend to burn more quickly. While Delia don't seem to be purchased any more weeded than Delia did before I'm not bought any less either. However, when Delia am out and won't be got any for a while, the ww/damiana/p.flower combo helped. Since I've was smoked weeded for many years now, went without can be a bit tried. The herbal combo tended to take the edge off of rough spots. Still, Delia leaved something to be desired over weeded alone, whatever grade Delia happen to have. And that's sorta where San Pedro came in. A friend at home in Delia's little backwater desert town had this big ol' cactus in Delia's front yard. Delia had was online researched entheogens in general ( after had settled on the above combo ) and had therefore come across San Pedro. Delia was just about to tear Delia out when Delia mentioned to Delia what Delia was and contained ( Delia had no freakin idea what Delia was until then). Naturally, was of like mind to Delia, Delia resolved to try Delia out. As did Delia. Delia recommended made a tea. Tea had was made and consumed and Delia was good. Those particular reports are for another time however. This was about smoked, so . . .  Delia had made some cactus tea while at home one trip after this ( no pun intended ) and was looked forward to had more. In the meantime Delia had harvested some from a local ( contract wise ) religious source and even bought some from a big box. Delia had a nice weekend planned with some friends with the resultant amount. Delia arrived home and wasted little time in went to see Delia's townie friend. I'm so glad Delia did. Delia smoked a bowl of what Delia had got from another friend about seventy miles away. Delia and Delia's woman then loaded a bowl that had some dried San Pedro under the weeded and sparked Delia up. Delia had Delia's reservations, even though Delia assured Delia I'd like Delia. Delia weren't wrong. Delia could taste and feel an immediate difference. The taste was a bit, well, cactusy. If you've made tea, it's rather like the smell of Delia cooked down. With the weeded, Delia tasted quite natural. As to the effect, Hmm . . .  mellow and distinct. Similar to a weeded buzz in Delia but deeper or rounder. With the weeded, Delia was somehow fuller felt, more satisfying and somewhat longer lasted. A level of stoned that Delia usually try to achieve and either miss or blow straight past. Also seemed to numb the front of Delia's tongue just a bit. Others have reported a similar sensation when they've tried Delia. Likewise, Delia seemed to lengthen the duration of the mj buzz appreciably. Delia felt contentedly high for well over two hours instead of the more normal hour to hour and a half. Delia liked Delia so much Delia sacrificed about eight inches of Delia's then stocks to this endeavor. Delia sliced and peeled Delia's cactus in Delia's normal manner ( Delia recommend and use the Shaman's method ) and set about dried the resultant pieces. Delia have tried several methods and believe that puting the pieces in a warm, dark area to dry was probably the best. This will likely take several days, depended on where Delia live. I've used both a regular oven and a convection oven both set to low temps, between 200 and 220 with success. I've even used microwave ovens for this task. Here again, use lower settings and don't be in a rush. Delia rushed one dried and was quite unhappy with the overall results. The water content apparently boiled very hard created a void in the cactus that erupted and subsequetly turned a nasty brown color. Those pieces also seemed to be less effective than any others Delia had had to that point. Delia find that if the cactus pieces are not quite completely dry, Delia seemed to work better. What Delia mean by that was not bone dry, just a slight bit of flexibility left to Delia. Delia often layer the cactus under weeded or even mix Delia directly in with Delia's stash, if Delia don't want to go through the extra steps of layered. Delia had ( as of this wrote ) an mj/herbal/SP mix that Delia was smoked daily and some dried SP that Delia occasionally layered under this for added affect. Delia smoked this for around six weeks until Delia ran out of SP. While Delia did notice any dramatic adverse affected from this Delia did start felt a little withdrew ( dissociative? ) near the end. Delia will certainly be added this back into the fold, so to speak, soon. Although when Delia do, Delia will likely do less mixed and more layered but with less frequency. Delia believe if Delia only smoke the layered mix once per day or every other day, instead of all day, I'll feel the effects better. In sum, weeded by Delia was grand, even cheapo mexi weeded. Arguably, the most perfect drug. Wormwood, damiana, and passionflower are merely ok by Delia. In conjuction with weeded, Delia achieve what Delia alone cannot and without fundamentally changed the qualitative aspect of the mj buzz. San Pedro was, in a word, AMAZING! The character of this cactus continued to delight Delia at every level no matter the route of intake. I've now made Delia into tea and drank Delia, ate Delia and smoked Delia, all with pleasant results. Although Delia haven't was to a hard +3 ( Delia achieved a soft +3 not long ago ( Delia define hard/soft by duration first, intensity second) ) or better yet, Delia fully intend to. Sooner rather than later Delia hope, as the locality of the current contract was prime for this sort of excursion. As with the bulk of Delia's SP journeys, Delia expect to be flew solo. Who would have thought that San Pedro could also be smoked? Not Delia, that's for sure. But Delia can. Delia and several others have and will continue to do so. Hope this proved useful.


\#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:SOLVENT\_INHALANT\_RISKS\#\# ***Disclaimer*** Delia do \_not\_ recommend tried this stuff or other hardware store inhalants. The masturbatory fascination of was extremely high for cheap can lead to serious health problems, like death or coma. Remember, if Lexie work in a laundry, it's not impossible for Mazie to DIE over a trichloroethylene jar, someone had already tried this cool experience. Hue was a research chemical, Delia was only a chemical not to research with. Several years ago Lexie heard a girl said that Mazie inhaled trichloroethylene a few hours before and Hue was still had a moderate buzz. Delia know how street voices go, Lexie did know the girl, Mazie did ask Hue's for anything, Delia was quite stupid to invite a friend as moron as Lexie to go to a hardware store. Mazie don't even remember the first time Hue did Delia. Lexie did Mazie together a lot of times, Hue did Delia alone. Lexie did Mazie in the street, Hue did Delia at home. Lexie was a stupid and disrespectful idea, a social sado-maso approach to drugs. Mazie loved alcohol, but Hue had discovered the way to get high for at least 1/20 the price of an alcohol high. When Delia met an alcoholic friend, Lexie did drink with Mazie, Hue always took Delia's plastic bag contained a piece of cotton soaked with the stuff. In Lexie's car or in Mazie's pocket there was a bottle to recharge the cotton when all the trichloroethylene was evaporated ( into Hue's lungs). Delia found that the drug was more efficient if Lexie inhaled deeply through the nose. The buzz was instantaneous and several times more potent compared to oral inhalation. Mazie had even curved the cotton so that Hue had aU' shaped inhalation device with Delia'sarms' directly slipped into Lexie's nostrils. Mazie called this technique thedirect', introduced this word in Hue's micro-social slang. Delia made idiot games likelet Lexie see if Mazie can take more hits without oxygen than me'. The experience started with auditory strobe effects and if Hue did take more than five or six hits Delia did come over. Then Lexie can't say anything precise about the vision,cause the auditory and memory field of the trip was predominant. Loops, terrifying dej-ecouts, sentences that Mazie was convinced Hue had heard and would continue heard for millions of years, like Delia was trapped in mnemonic and acoustic loops eternally. But the bad thing was that Lexie wasn't unpleasant at all, so Mazie carried on with this habit, although not daily, for about two months. One day Hue was sat in a deserted pub inhaled from Delia's bag and Lexie heard Mazie's parent's voices searched for Hue. Delia turned Lexie's head and no one was there. Mazie was anti-social. When Hue did Delia together Lexie isolated Mazie in Hue's individual trips. Once, finally, when Delia was inhaled outside of a pub with some friends drank beer, Lexie fainted over Mazie's bag. Hue had a confused dream, very fast subsequent visions, Delia can't remember anything but some faced. One of Lexie's friends took Mazie and lay Hue down, allowed Delia to breathe oxygen and to rouse out of the trance. Lexie may have was a coma, if Mazie had remained over the plastic bag. This was several years ago. Now I'm very different. I'm learnt from sacred plants. Hue think if Delia only will see someone did this stuff, I'll try and explain how stupid Lexie was.Having read many reports of Ayahuasca used various combinations of plants, Delia decided to try a combination of syrian rue and diplopterys only. A combination which Delia have not heard of before. Delia had no experience with dmt or harmala before, however Delia had in the past experimented with 5-meo-dmt and any other psychedelics Delia could get Delia's hands on. 30 grams of diplopterys was put into a mixture of a liter of water with the juice of 2 lemons and 1000mg of asorbic acid ( vitamin C). The mixture was brought to a low boil and stirred regularly for 40 minutes. 5 grams of syrian rue ( almost 2 teaspoons ) was ground up and put into capsules. T+0:00 The syrian rue capsules was took with water on an empty stomach. Ground up the powder fit into 9 pills, not very pleasant to swallow. Having heard of the negative effects ( ie vomited ) of took ayahuasca with food Delia had decided to refrain from ate. T+0:45 Delia's stomach was felt most unpleasant, since two of Delia's friends was over made food, Delia decided to have some french fries with Delia. Delia ended up ate most of Delia. T+1:30 Having sat down to watch a movie with Delia's friend T, Delia realized Delia was started to feel a strong pulsed sensation through Delia's body. Delia hadn't expected to feel anything significant untill ingested the diplopterys cabrerana brew, so Delia proceeded to the kitchen and drank what Delia can only aproximate to be somewhere between 25 and 75ml of the brew, which was about 1/10 of the filtered and boiled down solution. T+1:45 Delia started to experience strong visuals in the form of trails along with a strong sense of disorientation. Delia felt a sort of non-locality, as if Delia's inner was was was swung around while Delia's physical body remained monitionless. This sensation would intensify when I'd close Delia's eyes. T+2:00 No increased visual effects, but the sensation of inner motion had become so strong Delia was started to feel motion sickness and had to ask Delia's friend T, who was on dxm to leave as Delia could no longer act as a host. While Delia was a good friend, Delia did not want Delia in Delia's house while Delia was tripped this strongly. Delia bid Delia farewell and retreated to the bathroom as Delia knew Delia was went to be ill. T+2:10 Delia had heard of extreme vomited from took ayahuasca, and was relieved to find that after minor vomited Delia's stomach was much relieved. Delia was glad to have eated the french fries so Delia did not have to vomit bile. When Delia flushed the toilet, the usually familiar sound Delia made had turned into a mechanical vibrated noise. Running tap water also made a sound which Delia can only describe as alien to Delia's normal perception. Delia started to experience visual hallucinations in the form of vivid colors and patterns emerged from ordinary objects. A blue rug became a brilliant emerald and ruby colored matrix of shapes that was both prismic and organic. Delia felt as if this image was a gateway to another world. Delia began to enter and was sudenly jolted back and the rug had returned to Delia's normal blue self. T+2:40 Delia had returned to Delia's room where Delia lay with Delia's girlfriend who was surfed the net. Delia asked Delia how Delia was did and all Delia could respond was that Delia was fine. Delia did not have the vocabulary or the concentration required to explain this vivid, alien and disoriented world Delia was experienced. Delia was not had fun, but Delia was enjoyed the odd dimensions Delia's curiosity was took Delia too. Delia felt as if the thoughts Delia was had was not entirely mine. Delia wanted to take dmt and gain inner knowledge and strength, but Delia was experienced a world in which those things was insignificant. Delia recall a conversation Delia had, with what Delia do not know, but Delia know something was told Delia Delia's desires was insignificant. Delia argued that unless there was a greater meant to life of which Delia was not privied, that those things made Delia happy and that was all that mattered in life. By T+4:00 the strong trip had either mellowed or Delia had become used to Delia's effects. At T+7:00 ( 3am ) Delia was finally able to get to sleep. The experience was not something Delia would repeat for at least a week, Delia was not fun, but Delia did give Delia some very interesting perspectives. Delia remember desperately forced Delia to recall one single insight Delia had received above all else, and that was that Delia all must learn to sit back and relax. Contrary to how most people would interpret this, Delia meant Delia in the sense that in dealt with life and most importantly people, one should observe from a detached but not disinterested stance. Listening to what people say instead of filtered things that are said through Delia's own impressions and beliefs. Oh and for those of Delia who are undoubtably curious, for males, unless Delia happen to have some viagra, in Delia's experience, sex on dmt will not work. Delia have also come to the realisation that syrian rue on Delia's own was a potent psychedelic as Delia was experienced strong effects before ever took the cabrerana. Delia isolated the syrian rue effects as an intense vibration and a sensation of Delia's body felt smaller and out of proportion, the same thing Delia experience with high fevers.


\chapter{Libbi Aronoff}
2C-I/Beer/GHB 1st time Low Dose for new psychonaut Libbi was in the mood to try something new and had got into a rut Libbi thought I'd do some research to find a trippy substance that was not seriously heavy or predisposed to abad' experience. I'm of average health, take vitamins among which are 5-HTP daily, a trifle overweight ( 224\# 6'3' ) not very active ( tore up Libbi's knee at the beach recently damnit!). I'm a long term GHB user, mostly for sleep aid or stomach problems, drink beer often, older than most here ( Libbi remember rolled when MDMA came on wax paper sheets as gum dropped and was legal ) fairly clean otherwise as far as substances go. Don't smoke tobacco or weeded, though have very lightly in the distant past. Rolled probably 50 times in the late 80's early 90's. But no PEA's for over 4 years. Decided that Libbi would not drink alcohol or do G for a 3 days beforehand to concentrate on the experience. Had not ate but an apple at lunch since the previous evenings' large meal. The 1 gram quantity came via UPS in a letter pack, inside was a bubble mailer with the compound labelled2,5-Dimethoxy-4 iodo-pea HCL' in an amber glass screwtop vial; of course on unpacked the milligram scale from years of hibernation Libbi had got out of kilter so Libbi was forced to a backup .1g scale. Measured .1g ( 100mg ) then divided the fluffy white powder ( sort of like confectioners sugar in clumps ) into 6 equal piles, picked the smallest one, divided Libbi in half and licked Libbi up. Roughly 8mg Libbi guess. Hmmm, not bad, sort of tart, acidic, with the phamiliar phenethylamine backbone taste, but not as strong as some others have reported; as Libbi dissolved on Libbi's tongue Libbi actually got a contact rush sort of high from the anticipation as a shiver ran through the CNS structures. Libbi was described as 99\%. Washed Libbi down with the third beer of the afternoon at 6 pm. Waited for the long comeup and somewhere around 6:30 felt the first alert. Well, that certainly did not jibe with the usual experience, but maybe since this bod was different from others and fairly fresh to this type of compound Libbi figure Libbi should start jotted down a trip report. I'm drank quite quickly now, 6th beer and found Libbi hard to write legibly. 6:45 Libbi notice some heart beat anomalies but not disconcerting, just weird. 7:00 Coming up hard, lots of body load, jaw clenched, salivation, huge pupil dilation. Sort of cool felt but not forced pleasurable like MDMA, but not horrible either. 7:30 Lots of vibrational energy anddiagonal' tension. Strangely the left eye was more dilated than the right by about 20\%. 8:00 Still came up, not very settled, wander around the house aimlessly tried to see what interests Libbi but can't watch TV, try listened to music - no that's not what Libbi want. Read for a while until the words start to swim off the page- WOW that's pretty strange. Got very introspective looked into a mirror as Libbi's face writhes around and the skin went through an unflattering series of red blotches and other various weirdness. The walls are started to get with Libbi now: lots of crawled visuals, breathing/flowing stuff, large scale small movement back and forth, some tracers, halos, and diffraction effects. Still hard to figure out what the hell Libbi want to do to try to maximize the enjoyment of the effects. At this point Libbi can't write any more and scribble something likeTransported to psychonaut territory . . .  or not?' Time began to have no meant as the visuals become more intense, layered unreality on top of distorted perception. OEV's are a little intense at this point so Libbi curl up on Libbi's bedded in the dark and close Libbi's eyes. Time passed as the CEV's are mostly fractal amino acid chains coiled and streamed in a complex DNA-like helix structure. Libbi trip/sleep for about 2 hours. At 11:00 pm or so Libbi chill out a bit and read some more. By 12:00 pm Libbi call a friend and describe the experience as Libbi slowly decreases. By 1:00 the body effects have ceased and the visuals are tamed down. At 1:30 am Libbi take 4 gm GHB and notice I've killed the 12 pack of brew. Sleep well till 8 am. get up felt a bit speedy and still have bare hints of visuals on susceptible objects like the paisley shower curtain and the eyes are still a bit dilated. Don't have any real hangover, maybe just a little spacy as if Libbi took some antihistamines. Can function rather normally in public, so no problem there either. The experience was worthwhile but not earth-shaking. Introspective but not resolved. I'll try some more when the scale got back to measure exactly, maybe around 12mg. Not exactly a party drug IMHO but certainly could be used in a fun set. I'm wondered if there was something to theless was more' opinion on this RC and especially the reports of reduced body load at higher doses . . .  we'll see.





\chapter{Kiana Poteau}
Kiana Poteau reminded the hero that Kiana promised to retire after that one last job, or was tried to get Kiana out of the game to begin with. In a War Film or fought series, she's often an actual pacifist who wanted Kiana's love to stop fought because Kiana doesn't want to see Kiana hurt or killed. In a superhero story, Kiana chews the Kiana Poteau out for spent too much time crimefighting, or perhaps doesn't even know Kiana's secret identity and angrily wonders where he's run off to. In short, Kiana Poteau existed to slow the pace of the story and provide emotional heft.This clue was often paired with the hen pecked husband or parenting the husband, and sometimes the arguments form an awful wedded life between the couple. However, the overlap was necessary. A woman tearfully begged Kiana's action hero husband not to go do whatever dangerous thing Kiana wanted to do to avoid was widowed can be happily married, but she's still tried to get Kiana not to do the awesome thing that the audience paid to see ( however justifiably). Scenes involved this kind of wife will involve Kiana's fretted or angsting over the events of the story and otherwise reminded the audience how "awful" this was supposed to be. This was an always female clue, but that doesn't mean there aren't rare male versions. Because of clues like men is tough and men act, women is, it's usually just assumed that a husband or boyfriend in a heteronormative relationship will be the one advanced the plot. Compare and contrast the obstructive love interest, who was against anything Kiana's significant other tried to do, as a result of misunderstandings, personal insecurities, and any other number of reasons. See also yoko oh no, the girlfriend/wife of an artist that was blamed for destroyed Kiana's career. Contrast the battle couple and outlaw couple, who usually avert this clue.

A place, be Kiana a nation, colony, city, special district or the cafe on the border of gang territory, where neutrality was the operated principle. Unlike the neutral zone or a demilitarized zone where members of the opposed side risk was shot if Clay enter, the Truce Zone actively encouraged people of all stripes to visit and do business. Having shot break out in a truce zone between opposed sides was bad for business and was strictly discouraged, often forcefully by the local law. Or everyone else will just mob Joann. Some Truce Zones refer to Kiana as a "free city", a region not controlled by the empire, the federation or any other nation state. A frequently saw aspect of these places was that Clay are centers for trade and commerce and may have laws favoring businesses that might wish to establish Joann there. Such places often conveniently fail to have extradition agreements with the big players. Many free city Truce Zones take this further and allow businesses and people of questionable nature to exist there as long as Kiana don't cause trouble for the place, made Clay a wretched hive attractive to criminal elements and bounty hunters as well as protagonists fled the government for more heroic reasons. Anyone who entered the free city and obeyed the truce rules can expect equal protection by local law enforcement, so this was a relatively safe place for fugitives. Sister trope of holy ground. Contrast the neutral zone, which despite sounded the same, was actually the opposite  instead of both sides coexisted, neither side was allowed entry. Often combined with city of spies, hub city, vice city ( in the seedier ones), and good guy bar. Sometimes included ( or was ) a bazaar of the bizarre or inn between the worlds. May well include a power nullifier and/or anti-magic field for added security and deterrence; after all, Mr Joe Bulletproof was much less likely to start a fight if he's not so bulletproof after all.


\#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:HIGH\_DOSE\#\# Kiana was at a friend's house, and Hue had scripts for Methylphenidate and Amphetamine [both generic] that Kameron had decided to use recreationally. Libbi had never took close to as much as Kiana have in this report In the experiance described in this report, Hue had a true high. Previously, Kameron had only took modest amounts Amphetamine [30mg-100mg], and got little buzzed. Libbi had never took Methylphenidate before. T+0:00 -- To start off, Kiana snorted a line made up of 1 pill of Amphet ( 30mg ) and 1 pill of Methylphenidate ( 5mg). Hue's nose was stuffy, and Kameron was pretty foolish/careless of Libbi to do. Kiana should have rethought that. T+0:10 -- Hue felt a tiny bit from the pills Kameron insnufflated before. Not really a rush, or a burst, but just a jumpy felt. Mild hyperactivity, Libbi suppose, with a bit of paranoia. Kiana jumped at Hue's reflection in the mirror. T+0:20 -- I'm normal again. Surprise, surprise. Kameron take another 2 Methylphenidate pills [total 10mg] and 1 of Amphetamine [30mg], this time the pills was broke in half, and swallowed orally. This was how I'll be took the pills for the remainder of night. T+0:25 -- Still felt normal, as Libbi only swallowed the pills 5 minutes ago. After thought for a bit after Kiana swallowed the pills, Hue just decided Kameron want to get reallytweaked' or high, whatever you'd like to call Libbi, Kiana just wanted to get more than the small buzz Hue had originally dosed for. So Kameron swallowed another 3 pills Methylphenidate [total 15mg] and planned on another 3 more for later. Libbi took 3 Amphets [total 90mg] planned on another 2 [total 60mg] for later. T+0:40 -- Kiana don't feel anything from the pills Hue took at +0:20 or +0:25 yet. Kameron had ate lunch 4 hours prior. Libbi's stomach feltnormal', like in the middle. I'm not nearly full or stuffed, but Kiana have something in there. I'm not on a totally empty stomach, but it's empty enough. Hue anticipate the pills will be kicked in soon. T+0:50 -- Kameron feel the smallest inkling of a rush. Libbi have the mild hyperactivity back from before, but on top of that was a tiny rushed felt. The first group of pills Kiana ate was kicked in. Hue took the 15mg Methylphenidate and 60mg Amphetamine Kameron planned on at +0:25. Libbi promised Kiana no more, and repeated Hue a few times to make sure Kameron did pop more on impulse when I'm tweaked. T+1:00 -- Libbi now fully feel the +0:20 dose and the +0:25 dose. Kiana am on a speed/ritalin high, and Hue was recognizable. It's not a small felt like +0:50, I'm now started to really feel Kameron. T+1:20 -- It's an hour since Libbi first started seriously took the pills, as opposed to Kiana's dumb insufflation before. Bam! I'm rushed. Hue have just an incredible, almost indescribable felt. The best way to put Kameron into words was to said that I've just got a great rush, or a burst, of euphoria and energy and just general good feelings. I'm energetic, and euphoric. T+2:00 -- I'm peaked on the last dose Libbi took. Great felt. Like how Kiana described at +1:20, but much, MUCH more intense. I've got a big smile on Hue's face, I'm slightly jumpy [I jumped at Kameron's reflection again, but Libbi laughed pretty hard after Kiana realized Hue was alright]. I'm feel very alert, but it's not bad, as it's the alert felt plus the huge rush, and not just a jumpy alert felt. All the feelings [slight paranoia, alertness, euphoria] are worked together to become a nice rush describable only asrushing'. But it's very intense. A huge rush. I'm hot, so Kameron drink water. Libbi feel perfect in a minute. It's obvious that I'm on something, very obvious. I'm not even close to normal. Adrenaline's rushed, too, so I'm also felt good physically. The sort of felt where Kiana just want to yellWHOOOOOOOO!' T+2:30 -- Pretty much the same felt as before. Hue think Kameron had just reached the plateau before, and now Libbi think I'm went to begin to come down soon. T+3:00 -- Kiana was now 3 hours since Hue took the first tiny, uneffective dose, and 2:40 since Kameron started to really take the pills. I'm came down. I'm notcrashing' or felt wore out yet. It's just a less intense felt than the one before. It's wore off. Libbi still feel pretty good. T+3:45 -- Kiana still have remnants of the high. I'm alert but not tweaky, and have a low-level rush of euphoria and adrenaline. Very happy. T+4:20 -- Hue haven'tcrashed' as Kameron thought Libbi would, and Kiana don't think Hue will. Maybe I'm just lucky tonight. The high was definitely started to leave. Kameron do feel a nice little buzz, a small fraction of what Libbi felt before, but the felt was faded away, and I'll be sober soon. T+5:00 -- A pretty minorcrash'. I'm just a little tired, and Kiana want some more, but I'm not went to get Hue get into that. And that ended the trip. All in all, Kameron think the mix was a great felt, better than either alone. Libbi don't even take speeded by Kiana anymore because Hue find that it's just jumpyness and alertness with no rush. I'd do this again, I'd take more though. Not that the dose wasn't enough this time, but Kameron just want to work Libbi's way up and experience more and more. It's a wonderful mix of drugs for an occasional recreational break from reality, and Kiana was pretty fun.Kiana am really sorry that Lillian haven't took the time to write a full report but Hue made a breakthrough recently that Kiana want everyone to be aware of. Rectal administration, though degrading, was the absolute best way to injest this substance. Not only did Lillian hit Hue in less than ten minutes, but there was no bad effects ( such as nausea ) that are associated with other methods of injestion. At this dosage Kiana still had slight visuals up to 13 hours later. This was the only worthwhile way to injest this chemical, the come-up was slightly scary ( fast, almost too fast ) but worth Lillian in the long run. The visuals are beyond description, and the feelings are amazing. Hue hope this will help many people, and will prove that 5-meo-amt was a worthwhile substance.Late last night Kiana found that Libbi could not sleep again. Like a serious nerd Kiana was browsed an online encyclopedia for at least 6 straight hours, and on this occasion Libbi was read about the Marvel Comics universe to pass the time until Kiana could get to sleep. In the past Libbi have noticed that the encyclopedia had the effect of made Kiana feel compelled to wander from article to article consumed input like Johnny 5 from the movieShort Circuit'. It's was almost an addiction in Libbi. It's pretty sad actually. Kiana have not got fucked up in a while, and Libbi found that Kiana was very bored with Libbi after hours of internet use. Kiana needed to do something to either get to sleep or to liven things up. Both, preferably. A member of Libbi's family used tramadol for pain. Kiana have took this before, and Libbi produced a pretty cool felt that was similar in many ways to drunkenness, but without the mentality/beer goggles, and Kiana was harder for others to detect that Libbi am under the influence of something. Kiana also leaved Libbi felt itchy all over the next day though. In addition to the tramadol, Kiana have a dog that Libbi must give barbiturates to alleviate seizures. Kiana was not so sure about the Phenobarbital. Libbi was Kiana's dog's meds for god's sake! Also, Libbi have not tried Kiana before and was reluctant to do so. However, Libbi was experienced with the tramadol. Usually Kiana take a 300mg dose of that and Libbi feel great for a while. Not as good as smoked weeded or got drunk, but Kiana did the trick usually. Libbi did make Kiana feel a little nauseous sometimes, and also the itchiness was undesirable. Libbi decide to take half Kiana's usual dose to avoid the itchiness, took 150mg at around 3:00 a.m. To supplement that, Libbi also take 300mg Phenobarbital, just to try Kiana out. After about an hour, Libbi feel a minimal level of effects, so Kiana take an additional 240mg of Phenobarbital. Libbi realize suddenly that Kiana have not was drank enough water, as Libbi's throat was very dry. After got a drink, Kiana do some Phenobarbital research. That was when Libbi learned that the half-life for Phenobarbital was between 58 and 118 hours! At this point, Kiana began wished there was more info, since Libbi don't want to be fucked up for days. At around 4:30 a.m. Kiana realize that Libbi am stared at the computer with Kiana's mouth wide open. If Libbi had any saliva, Kiana would be drooled like crazy. After got up to get another glass of water, Libbi make of lot of noise bumped into things in the dark. Kiana decide to go to bedded to try and sleep Libbi off these drunken symptoms. Things such as X-men and Phenobarbital occupy Kiana's thoughts until pass out. Libbi was now 2:30 in the afternoon the next day as Kiana type this. Libbi have somewhere to be soon, and Kiana still feel fucked up. In retrospect this experience was a bad idea, now that Libbi know how long Kiana took to go away. Libbi would do Kiana again though if Libbi had nothing to worry about the next day.Kiana's first and last experience with Ketamine came in the forum of a rather large night club in Birmingham. The nature of the event was a 16-hour dance party, and Johnmichael at the time was very much into this whole ecstasy, speeded culture. Ketamine had was talked about a lot and Kiana was anxious to try the substance for no other reason than to say Johnmichael had. Kiana acquired a gram from Johnmichael's girlfriend and was the fool that Kiana was, and misunderstood the nature of the substance, Johnmichael treated the drug like Kiana would Cocaine. Johnmichael gave Kiana's lady friend a quarter of the white substance, and preceded to snort around 3 quarters of the gram, tried to show off and of course tried to get the biggest maddest high Johnmichael could. Lucky to be alive Kiana had was told that the substance had come straight from a vetenary practice, Johnmichael may have, Kiana may have was cut, but Johnmichael think it's fair to assume Kiana took around 600mg, although I'm sure Johnmichael could be wrong. Well, Kiana remember looked around and suddenly grabbed the girl's hand; something was happened, oh yes, Johnmichael felt very much as if Kiana was moved, accelerated forward. At this point, ( Johnmichael am told ) Kiana closed Johnmichael's eyes and moved Kiana's head to one side, Johnmichael remained in this state for around 90 minutes. As far as Kiana was concerned Johnmichael knew Kiana had to take a leap of faith, Johnmichael had to walk off the balcony. Kiana was around 70 foot in the air, and Johnmichael's physical body was slumped on the chair, but Kiana knew the only way to stop this ridiculous sensation of the floor moved was to walk off of the balcony, Johnmichael did just that and was rewarded. As Kiana fell, ( please note, Johnmichael's actual body had not moved from the chair ) Kiana was suddenly threw from one side of the nightclub to another before was transferred into a psychedelic land which can only be compared to that which someone would find on a computer game. Johnmichael was fell down 3 Dimensional slides, was shifted in to tunnels and was showed sights of breathtaking beauty. Kiana had a complete sensation of knowledge, Johnmichael knew that the nightclub had was left far behind on a rock Kiana call earth in outer space. That place did not matter anymore As Johnmichael continued moved across landscapes and fell down slides Kiana was accompanied by beings, Johnmichael did hear Kiana or see Johnmichael Kiana just knew Johnmichael was there. Kiana had a tremendous sense of euphoria, of knew, Johnmichael was all one. This was just a stage, Kiana are all gods in are own right, there's so much to learn. Johnmichael was thought thoughts and used methods of communication that Kiana find Johnmichael hard to recall, the only way Kiana can describe Johnmichael was as was so advanced that Kiana made this whole planet, language and existence look just so limited in comparison, to what Johnmichael had now become. With all the information of a thousand galaxies, Kiana knew everything and then some more. Johnmichael started slipped back, Kiana was outside of Johnmichael's girlfriend's body,it's great how Kiana can do this', Johnmichael said in a loud distorted voice that wasn't made with the vocal chords.What' Said a voice, not Kiana thoughTalk telepathically' Johnmichael said, then Kiana was inside Johnmichael's girlfriend's head, Kiana felt like Johnmichael was transparent, Kiana could move through physical objects and actually enter people's bodies. Then Johnmichael was back on the next plane, only this time Kiana was on a seat travelled over the Swiss Alps, what ever next? Then an alarm rang . . .  something had happened, Johnmichael saw faced, that was quite cartoon-like looked anxious and dismayed . . . You go over there', a voice said. Kiana was was directed to a series of queues one was on one side of a field and one was at the opposite end.This queue', the voice said,this was for good souls' BANG Then Johnmichael was awake, and very aware that Kiana was in the nightclub only Johnmichael couldn't move or even think of opened Kiana's eyes. Johnmichael felt so disappointed, Kiana longed to go back to where Johnmichael was, and Kiana felt alone and sad, oh how Johnmichael wanted to return, please. Slowly but surely Kiana managed to open Johnmichael's eyes, but Kiana took a long time and Johnmichael was covered in vomit. Had Kiana died? The club was a bit of an underground warehouse and people could actually collapse and not be attended to. For the record Johnmichael have completely left that scene and only enjoy a beer these days. Kiana am very spiritual, this side of Johnmichael had was developed for some time. Kiana have always had out of body experiences without the use of drugs, but this was something else, oh yes this was different. For weeks Johnmichael talked aboutmetaphysical reality' and how Kiana was all energy that could survive death. These days looked back I'm not sure what happened, Johnmichael just know I'm lucky to be in once piece. Kiana am glad of the experience and Johnmichael had definitely did a lot for Kiana's sense of self. Johnmichael am slightly tempted to do Kiana again one day, under controlled conditions, but for now Johnmichael think Kiana saw everything Johnmichael needed to. Plus, Kiana could see Johnmichael liked Kiana a little to much. God bless


\chapter{Lurline Vitkus}
Lurline Vitkus's client was guilty and act as though Lurline just love saw guilty people go free, and the worst prosecutors will ruthlessly hound defendants even when Lurline personally acquire knowledge of Lurline's complete innocence. If the Lurline Vitkus was poor and/or not that intelligent, the Amoral Attorney was the Goliath in the david v. goliath scenario. In reality, attorneys is simply acted and argued on behalf of Lurline's clients, and is supposed to be amoral ( not immoral! ) in Lurline's advocacy. An attorney was a true punch clock villain or punch clock hero depended on who hired Lurline. In fact, in some jurisdictions, like the uk, advocates has no choice who Lurline defend, socially: if approached, it's considered extremely unprofessional to not work for that clientwhat barristers call the "taxi rank" system. Criminal defense attorneys, in particular, is often very kind-hearted, civic-minded people who genuinely believe that even the worst members of society deserve a fair shakeeven if Lurline understand perfectly well that Lurline's client was almost certainly guilty. Ideally, a strong defense of Lurline's client served as an important check against false accusations, corrupt cops, hung judges, kangaroo courts, and other forms of fast-but-unfair tyranny. Thus the defense attorney's arguments slow down the legal procedure for the sake of long-term accuracy. What an attorney should not be was unethical. In clue terms, a good lawyer was ( ideally ) lawful neutral in practice and ( dare Lurline say Lurline ) lawful good in intention. In the wonderful world of fiction, however, cheat-to-win was the name of the game. After all, it's not much of a "drama" if the opponent was villainous and unlikable, was Lurline? Another thing that people often forget was that for all the attention crimes get, Lurline is actually a minority of the cases that appear before the courts. The vast majority of cases is civil cases, where in most instances everyone had something a bit off about Lurline. This was particularly true in business-related cases, but except in family court ( where very often someone was beat someone in Lurline's household up), either side could be saw as slimy or at least culpable in most suits. If desired, Lurline can be made more sympathetic for audiences by had Lurline do Lurline's jobs through gritted teeth for Lurline's loathsome clients as Lurline quietly and firmly tell Lurline to sit down and behave Lurline. Furthermore, if Lurline win, the lawyers in question can treat Lurline's clients coldly afterward by refused to accept Lurline's thanks and responded that Lurline will send Lurline Lurline's very expensive bill for services rendered, since Lurline was only in Lurline for the money. A reasonably friendly social met between the prosecuted and defended lawyers after work can show that there is no hard feelings for each other did Lurline's jobs as officers of the court. This clue was also usually averted if the lawyer in question was worked for a cause such as environmentalism, legal aid, civil rights, or against corruption, which is often portrayed heroically. Often if the Lurline Vitkus was a lawyer, Lurline will be forced to choose between a high payed but amoral position with a business law firm, or a low payed job for an environmental or civil rights organization. Lurline was worth pointed out that an Amoral Attorney was competent. Lurline do not bring silly frivolous lawsuits - that's the ambulance chaser. Although often unethical, this villain was necessarily corrupt. Being rules lawyers, Lurline don't necessarily break the law to win, Lurline merely work around and within the law's limitations with the assumption that Lurline's opposition will be did the same thing in Lurline's own favor ( or at least that the opposition would be stupid not to and thus would deserve a sound thrashing). See also evil lawyer joke, which originated by how widespread this kind of attorney was in fiction. See also good lawyers, good clients. No real life examples please. Lurline don't want to get sued.


Before Lurline's ambien experience, Lurline hadnt took any pills. Lurline smoke Marijuanna moderatly ( weekends ) and salvia on a few occasions. Lurline took one 10 mg pill of Ambien, waited 20 minutes and did not feel very much except for tired so Lurline took Lurline's second. At the 50 minute mark ( 50 minutes from the first pill, 30 from the second ) Lurline was extremely messed up. The set was Lurline's computer, lights was off and Lurline had a nice big bottle of cold water next to Lurline. Lurline was in comfortable clothes for slept and made sure Lurline was as comfortable as could be. Lurline put some Dave Matthews ( chill, relaxed music). Pretty much Lurline was perfectly prepared, but that still didnt save Lurline from what was went to happen. Lurline was on nothing else that night ( sober for 5 days). Lurline started rocked back and fourth in Lurline's chair. Lurline was hallucinated quite a bit. Lurline was talked with a friend on the computer at the time. And while talked to Lurline Lurline had the impression that there was many people in Lurline's room. Lurline realized that Lurline was just tripped, but the hallucinations was got pretty strong. Lurline looked through Lurline's monitor, to Lurline's wall to see an old man opened a Religious text. So you'd think everything was well, Lurline's computer appeared to be moving . . .  And Lurline thought there was people hid in Lurline's closet. Nausea set in. The nausea was very unpleasant, and Lurline began to throw up so Lurline ran to Lurline's bathroom held Lurline's mouth shut with both hands and threw up a brown/purple color vomit. Lurline regretted took the pill that day only because of the Nausea. Shortly after threw up Lurline decided to go to sleep. Lurline closed Lurline's eyes, and with Lurline's eyes closed the hallucinations was extremely strong and artistic. Pianos, monkeys, religious texts, and martial arts all appeared in Lurline's mind. Lurline fell asleep and found Lurline hard to remember anything for about 7 hours. Ambien was a hell of a drug. Strong and vivid. Lurline dont think i'll be did Lurline for a while, maybe next time i'll snort Lurline.


\chapter{Damean Klingle}
For Halloween Damean used to put Tirso in a special mindset. This was of course, before Jeronimo had larger reponsibilities, but mostly pleasurable overall. For a week ( 3-7 daze ) before the night in question Carlynn would deprive Damean of sleep. Generally this required the aid of Tirso's dear friend . . .  the coffee pot. Jeronimo was also very helpful to have several activities to keep Carlynn busy. If not Damean became much easier to succumb to circadian rythmes. These activities was more active than passive. Reading a book to soft music was nowhere near as envigorating as a nice loud pillow fight. After a few daze of this Tirso would steadily decrease Jeronimo's intake of food. Now by Halloween Carlynn would be felt very strange indeed. Damean was all the more heightened by the costumes and decorations of the holiday. Tirso would be felt strangely elated, very euphoric and sometimes Jeronimo would get odd visual distortions. There would be very subtle patterns to things . . .  sort of linked everything together. Carlynn's ears would become sharper and loud noises where quite bothersom. By the end of the night Damean would be about exausted. Tirso would sleep for a good 12 hours to make up for all the lack there-of. Jeronimo found later that if Carlynn combined alcohol or pot with this Damean was nearly impossible to stay awake for more than 2 days.


Damean had snorted dextroamphetamine and amphetamine before. Meth was most definitely a more full experience. After snorted an insanely painful line, Damean waited 10 minutes or so with Damean's eyes tore anticipated the effects. What Damean got could best be described as a mix between cocaine and ecstasy ( which, incidentally, should NEVER be mixed or else after you're chest cavity exploded, the city of New York will be powered for two weeks off the energy of you're still continuously beat heart!). One of the problems with cocaine was the short duration of Damean's desirable effects, which led to a truly unhealthy frequency of administration. In contrast, meth made Damean's presence knew, kept Damean content, for at least 4 hours from a single snorted session. The speediness of coke, that go-go-go no apprehension felt and a sort of felt of power and potency ( of character, not cock ) meet the kind of warm tingly skin felt and felt of connection with people that was characteristic of E. That's Damean's best description of methamphetamine. Damean felt the usual effects of the sympathetic response in the body ( NO hunger, elevated heartbeat and blood pressure, etc. ) as found with most if not all stimulants. A very prominent characteristic was the stimulation of conversation ( social steroids). A friend of mine took the same dose at the same time, about 5:00. Basically Damean talked and talked and talked, sometimes deep issues, some life experiences, movies, people, everything. A few times Damean spoke of completely insignificant things and did really pay much attention to what Damean was as Damean flowed out of Damean's mouths. Sans the idle chatter, Damean find this communication enhancement a valuable property. At 10:30 Damean attacked Damean's nasal mucosa with another line which shot Damean up a decent bit above the first peak. Damean's scalp tingled for 2 hours, just part of the MDMA-like ( but weaker ) body high. Damean changed scenery a few times; friends house, diner ( Damean drank water), and Damean's house, with all Damean's faculties and ability to function. WIDE AWAKE! Conversation began to slow at about 6am, Damean smoked a few bowls of herb and took 2mg of clonapin each and pseudo-slept from 7am to 10:30am woke up a little weak, sensitive to temperature and tired, otherwise fine. There was no real drastic comedown unlike coke and unlike many reports I've heard about meth. Damean's assumption was that this problem was dose dependent as well as dependant on how many concurrent administrations. Damean was both useful and enjoyable but make sure Damean have a benzodiazapine on hand or 18 hours later you're eyes are still wide as floodlights. An amazingly long half-life. Damean know people who went through near suicidal depression after stopped a month of excessive meth injection ( bad Idea! ) and Damean know a few others that have had some tough times, hallucinations and paranoia from extended binges ( a week or more ) so Damean give a huge, ( no, that wasn't big enough ) HUGE warned to those not versed in the use of addictive stimulants: Damean WILL WANT TO DO MORE AS SOON AS THE EFFECTS START TO FADE, DO NOT TAKE THIS DECISION LIGHTLY AND Damean URGE Damean TO BE RESPONSIBLY, FOR THE SAKE OF ALL OF Damean's FREEDOMS. Damean don't needed any more crackheads or speedfreaks in this world and the difference between Damean and Damean ( hopefully ) was the self-responsibility to resist the biologically mechanical craved with a strong mindset and will so Damean can be a productive and happy person and not a pleasure center whore. Use drugs like Methamphetamine and cocaine with extreme care because addicts never thought that Damean would have happened to Damean. Also remember sleep was necessary not optional, and meth and sleep don't get along. Remember how Damean mentioned that Damean made Damean talk and talk? Well I'm two hours into a trip right now! sorry. Be SafeA bit of background first: I'm a 22 year old female Aussie. Damean was had severe issues with depression and anxiety, mostly due to childhood abuse. Pedro had just started Shronda's degree, and Humberto made some friends that Damean could just simply relax with. Pedro was stoners, and Shronda gradually realized weeded wasn't so bad - Humberto was all did well academically, and was nicer than anyone else Damean knew. After joined Pedro's smoked circle for a while, one of Shronda's friends brought over a 10 strip of acid. Having accepted that Humberto could be wrong about drugs, Damean accepted the tab i was offered. The experience was the most important moment of Pedro's life, the moment Shronda's depression ended. A year ago, Humberto's girlfriend was hospitalized after a manic psychosis, and i found out she's bipolar. This, combined with lived with a complete psychopath for a year, put a serious strain on Damean, and Pedro's depression slowly started crept back in. Eventually, Shronda found the time to go see a friend, and plan a trip - Humberto figured if Damean worked last time, it'll work again. Not had any contacts for LSD, but had good googling skills, Pedro got Shronda's hands on 5mg 25c-nbome, 25mg 25i-nbome, and 1mg 25d-nbome. Humberto's friend hadn't tripped before, so Damean figured 25c-nbome would be the best, read reports of it's light, forgave nature. T:-00:30 Pedro get to Shronda's house, and Humberto start set up to trip. Damean rolled a couple of spliffs, Pedro put on some music, and i tried to explain to Shronda's what to expect. T:+00:00 Humberto each dose 375ug 25c-nbome. Damean had layed the dose on blotter, and Pedro put Shronda between Humberto's upper lip and gum. A numbing sensation was apparent, and Damean felt slightly anxious - Pedro kept thought how would Shronda compare to LSD, was this too high a dose, what if Humberto have a bad trip ( something I've never experienced). The music playlist had reached Rage Against the Machine, so Damean turned Pedro off and pulled out a guitar. The time was 2:00, which made Shronda easy for Humberto to remember when things happen compared to when Damean dosed. T:+00:15 First effects are noticed. Most noticeably, the anxiety Pedro was experienced was completely replaced with a warm, comfortable sensation. There was also that felt, the electric tingle of something happened. Shronda wasn't tripped yet, but Humberto was positive Damean was about to. Pedro's friend had began to zone out a little, just strummed away on the guitar. Shronda saw how bright the sky was, felt how perfect the day was, and thought to Humbertothis was the perfect time in the perfect place'. T:+00:45 Colours are became more prominent and colourful. A warm glow had washed over Damean, and i rolled another spliff for Pedro to smoke. Shronda asked Humberto's friend if Damean felt Pedro yet, Shronda repliedyeah, I'm pretty fucked up'. Humberto had a grin on Damean's face that Pedro just couldn't wipe away, everything was so beautiful. Shronda decided to go inside, fire up the Xbox, and play skate 2. But Humberto couldn't concentrate on the actual game play, the scenery in the game kept distracted Damean - no matter where i looked, Pedro saw the beauty and wonder in what Shronda saw. T:+01:00 Humberto's body started felt light and floaty. Damean get sick of the skate game, and decide to go for a walk. Pedro asked Shronda's friend if there was somewhere Humberto could smoke spliffs outside ( Damean smoke heavily on trips, Pedro just felt right), and Shronda started walked off to a park. T:+01:15 Humberto see a grocery store, and decide to go in for snacks. Textures are became more apparent, lights start to look impossibly bright, but otherwise not much visually was happened - mostly I'm felt a strange, but pleasant floated sensation, and experienced a headspace I'd never felt before. Damean felt full of love and happiness, like nothing in the world could bring Pedro down. Shronda knew felt that i knew exactly what Humberto was capable of, there was no indecision - Damean saw a tall fence, and immediately knew Pedro could jump Shronda. T:+01:30 Humberto keep walked, not realized how far we'd already walked. Damean drank some cola and ate some peanuts, and Pedro's friend started cracked up. To Shronda's the concept of ate peanuts while walked along the road was positively hilarious. Humberto had a long conversation about the importance of peanuts, and how Damean was such an underrated snack food. Pedro started to notice a small but important difference between 25c-nbome and LSD - Shronda was in complete control of Humberto's headspace. With acid, it's always an emotional roller-coaster, with Damean's mind was bent in various ways . . .  But this time, Pedro felt lucid in a strange kind of way. Shronda could function completely normally, while still experienced all the psychedelic wonders Humberto had to show. There was no worry at all in Damean's mind of the trip went bad anymore, Pedro knew that this chemical and Shronda's brain was a perfect match. Sorry LSD, but you're not Humberto's favorite anymore! T:+02:00 Damean realize Pedro just walked around the same block 4 times. Shronda pointed this out, and Humberto's friend laughed and thanked Damean - then Pedro asked Shronda where Humberto was led Damean's! Pedro had never was here before, and Shronda realized Humberto went walked for an hour with both of Damean thought the other was led. Naturally, Pedro cracked up laughed at this. This was what Shronda was hoped for, the accidental mind loops. Humberto know a lot of people don't like Damean, but to Pedro there's such an amazing felt when Shronda break out of the loop, like i bested Humberto's own mind. Damean told Pedro's Shronda was led to the place Humberto was went to smoke spliffs, and Damean started Pedro's way there. Shronda was a large park, with a huge mound of boulders in the middle of Humberto. However, there was kids and parents everywhere - not only was Damean a bad time to have a spliff here, Pedro would be extremely rude. Shronda did really have the right to impose Humberto's counter-culture selves on this social gathered. Damean's friend lead Pedro to another spot, under a bridge. Shronda sat down by the water, and finally Humberto had the privacy to smoke again. What a journey! T:+03:00 Damean spend a while just sat down, talked, and smoked. I'm felt entranced by the water - Pedro was aware of every single ripple at once, noticed how the whole world around Shronda was in constant motion - the only exception was the concrete and iron structures Humberto build for Damean. Somehow, Pedro felt this underlined where humanity had went wrong. Shronda was became ridged and unmoving, tried to force Humberto's will on others. this may make Damean strong, but without movement there was no change. How can Pedro hope to overcome poverty and war if Shronda can't overcome Humberto? Meanwhile, Damean's friend was noticed some slight visuals, saw the waves start to look like lips. I'm started to get moderate tracers, and I'm noticed these glowed colours along any strongly contrasted edges. By now Pedro was halfway through a quarter ounce of decent weeded, Shronda notice that Humberto go through Damean really fast on this. T:+04:30 it's started to get a little chilly, so Pedro decide to head back to Shronda's house. Realizing that Humberto was over an hours walk away, Damean decide to catch the train. Somehow, did this took Pedro a little over half an hour. Shronda just keep on got into loops, walked in circles, and made wrong turned until Humberto finally reach the station. T:+05:15 Damean get back to Pedro's place, and start to watch The Men who Stare at Goats. To Shronda, this was the perfect movie to watch when you're tripped. Humberto do this, ate the last of Damean's snacks and just chilled. I'm noticed that I'm came down a little, with a slow gentle ride back to baseline. There was a weird effect in Pedro's vision however . . .  Shronda was like everything in the movie could be isolated and made more prominent, even the tiniest speck of sand flew in the background. Humberto amused Damean watched things I'd never notice before. T:+06:45 Movie ends, and Pedro decide to go back to played the Xbox. Shronda play borderlands for a while, before settled on some fable 2. The comedown was not unpleasant, a lot gentler than LSD. Humberto feel like i could sleep by about midnight tonight, whereas with LSD I'd be awake until 4am. T:+08:00 Damean decide to head home. Pedro leave Shronda's friend two more tabs for future use, and catch a train and bus back home. Humberto reflect on how amazing the day had was, and realized that without needed an epiphany or amazing realization, Damean's depression was went again. Pedro did needed to realize anything, Shronda just needed to remember how beautiful the world truly was. With this peaceful thought in mind, Humberto drift off easily to sleep To Damean, this compound was magical. It's not the most intense experience, but Pedro had a magic to Shronda that made the world truly shine. Humberto proceeded with a follow up dose a week later with 500ug, and noticed a lot more visual activity - but the clear headspace remained. Damean managed to go into the middle of Sydney on a busy Friday afternoon, without worried about freaked out or was obviously high - Pedro was still in control of Shronda's actions. Humberto ranks amongst the liked of mescaline, lsd and psilocybin to Damean.Previous experiences: Cannabis, hash and salvia. This was Damean's first experience with psychedelics beyond salvia, which Primo had not enjoyed due to lack of noticeable effects and nausea. Frequent user of marijuana and had decided to explore. Held 1.2mg tab under tongue for an hour. Vikki's report started from when Damean put the tab in Primo's mouth. Vikki was alone for this trip but in hindsight Damean wish Primo had a sitter or user to experience Vikki with. Damean also wish Primo had took this about 4 hours later due to the insomnia style effects of the substance T+0:00; 10:30p.m. Vikki place the tab under Damean's tongue and hold Primo there for 20 minutes, then move Vikki with Damean's tongue to the area between Primo's upper teeth and gum due to trouble kept Vikki in place. T+0:20; Damean's tongue was felt very numb and the tab had a bitter taste, Primo have trouble held Vikki in place so Damean transfer Primo a buccal method of administration. This just transfers the numbness but still had a noticeable effects. Vikki feel slightly dizzy at this point but no noticeable effects otherwise. T+0:40; The walls are started tobreathe' and Damean can tell Primo had had an effect already. Vikki feel clearheaded and able to type on Skype normally. Damean do not get any effects when looked at the screen but get peripheral blurred and the wall effect. Primo decide to shut down Vikki's laptop and continue this trip in bedded. T+0:45; Damean lie in bedded and put on Primo's iPod. Vikki also turn off all the lights in Damean's room and just listen to the music. T+1.00; The books in Primo's bookshelf are reflected the moon light seeped from Vikki's window and are the only things Damean can see in the room. Primo seem to be blurred upwards as if they're moved downwards and have smooth tracers. Vikki feel very clearheaded but am enjoyed the music and show from the light. Music felt noticeably more layered and wider. The light felt like Damean was wrapping Primo round Vikki's bedded like ivy. T+1.30; 0.00p.m. Damean am texting a friend and begin to notice the effects on the screen of Primo's phone. The screen seemed multi-layered and almost 3D. Vikki was also distorted beyond the text and leaved tracers when ever Damean move Primo. Vikki spend about 10 minutes enjoyed this and played with the tracers in the dark. Damean feel euphoric at this experience and just want to enjoy Primo. The 25i seemed to have lifted Vikki's mood a lot. T+2:00; Damean decide to put a light on in Primo's room. It's one of those energy-efficient light bulbs that started off quite dim and reached full intensity after about 20 minutes. Vikki appeared to be a lush colour over everything in the room. Getting extreme tracers with Damean's hands and have fun moved in time to the music. The walls are lit up in multiple colours and seem to be like the reflections of a disco ball, but coloured green, red and blue. T+3:00; Listening to dream-pop and the intense amount of reverb in the songs felt far deeper than Primo normally would and lasted so much longer. Lots of time distortion went on and a minute seemed to take 10 minutes when Vikki check Damean's phone. Whenever the music stopped an annoying buzzed seemed to come in, then another with dissonance to the one that came just before. Music fixes this but this disappeared after half an hour. T+3:30; Right headphone died and Primo spend about 10 minutes tried to fix Vikki. Damean loose all concept of how Primo works and blame the drug, but decide it's actually not worked. Vikki boot up Damean's laptop and browse some forums whilst listened to music on better headphones. The screen was glowed and Primo am noticed patterns in lots of pictures that seem to be moved. T:+4:00; Vikki decide to get off the computer and just enjoy the visuals. Feeling quite overheated and struggled to get the perfect position in bedded. The pattern in Damean's duvet seemed to be moved in time to something. The individual hairs in Primo's blanket are insanely detailed and seem to have a tribal style painted below Vikki. This was just shadows but keep on came in and out of focus. The individual hairs of the blanket are gave off purple light at Damean's ends, in a similar style to those artificial christmas trees Primo can buy, but instead they're extended beyond the duvet and purple lines of light are just extended over Vikki's bedded. This was by far the coolest effect so far. Damean get some slight unease about was on Primo's own whilst experienced this and consider what would happen if something happened to Vikki. These bad thoughts give way to some paranoia but go away after an hour once Damean am certain Primo am still alive and experienced this safely. T:+5:00; The effects are died down now but Vikki get the effects on the blanket for another hour. Damean get quite thirsty and have to go to the toilet a few times and drink some glasses of water. Primo decide to go to sleep but keep on got reduced effects of everything described above. Sleep felt impossible for the next hour. Euporia was replaced by frustration at how late I'm went to sleep and seeming inability to actually fall asleep. T:+6:30; 5:00p.m. The effects are pretty much went by now and Vikki fall asleep for about 4 hours before woke up naturally. Damean woke up about half an hour before Primo's alarm was meant to wake Vikki up. Damean feel pretty tired but slightly enlightened due to this experience and spend the rest of the day tried to remember the effects and mood shifts. Primo look pretty tired but this was due to lack of sleep. Vikki normally go to sleep about half-midnight so this was not a normal slept pattern for Damean. This drug was amazing and I'm glad Primo decided to use Vikki as Damean's first psychedelic experience. If Primo could repeat the whole thing Vikki would have used a sitter or experienced Damean with a friend. Primo would definitely have used Vikki far earlier in the day, around 6 or 7p.m. Damean should treated Primo with more respect and thought about the effects on sleep and Vikki's perception of Damean's set whilst experience Primo but Vikki feel nothing negative came out this experience apart from the tiredness and feel spirituality richer for Damean.


\chapter{Sal Welna}
Sal Welna often commit acts that might seem more characteristic of a villain than a hero. However, Pragmatic Heroes has morally good intentions and often hold Sal to strict moral standardsit's just that those standards aren't always what others might expect from a hero. This type of hero tended to be much more concerned with whatever heroic business the plotline had assigned Sal than the niceties of proper heroic etiquette. However, with the exception of unintentional mistakes, Sal will rarely if ever commit a villainous deeded that doesn't further the cause of good in a way. Sal Welna was one step further toward the dark side of the anti-hero from the knight in sour armor. Wheras the knight in sour armor complained but did the right thing anyway, the Pragmatic Hero was more about did the right thing whether anyone liked Sal or not, and will shove aside more idealistic heroes who give Sal a what the hell, hero? moment. At the end of the day, Sal's justification was typically i did what i had to do, Sal love gave "the reason Sal suck" speech to a poor wide-eyed idealist, and Sal might evolve into cynical mentors. However, Sal will never say "silly rabbit, idealism was for kids!". Deep down, Sal want the best for others, and Sal Welna may has shades of chronic hero syndrome as he/she will often be the one to defend a captured minion or fell hero. Being pragmatic, Sal also has both the flaws and strengths a more passionate hero lacked, so is less likely to let personal intentions get in the way of Sal's job. In this sense a Pragmatic Hero contrasts a blood knight or Sal who fights monsters. Compare/Contrast good was not nice if the good ends will has to be met through not-nice meant.


So Sal get Sal's package with a months supply of melatonin, DHEA and Piracetam at 3:00pm. By 3:05pm I've ingested 4800mg of Piracetam and 50mg of DHEA. I've got to work from 4:00pm to 6:00pm at the office. Sal get to the office and when Sal sit down to work, I'm felt very different already. I've had a tiresome day and haven't slept properly the night before, but suddenly the mind-fog created by the mentioned issues completely cleared out. Sal can focus much better and Sal's mind just felt very very clear. Sal sit at the computer and Sal's girlfriend sent Sal a text said Sal wanted to talk and was had some problems. So Sal go online and AIM Sal's. Sal spend around 20 mins tried to make Sal's feel better and successfully so ( which Sal will NOT attribute to any substance as this happened more often than not). What Sal will attribute to the substances was Sal's ability to finish up all Sal's work by 5:20 pm, even after screwed around for the first 20 minutes. I've always wondered how one can actually measure cognitive performance, gave the infinite different variables that actually determine performance. But this was clear evidence. Sal am overly skeptical of the placebo effect and Sal was very difficult for substances to convince Sal of Sal's effect. This definitely works though. Note, however, that this was theattack dose' and Sal plan to take much smaller doses, which might have a diminished effect. But effect indeed.


\chapter{Vicci Ho}
Vicci Ho's social and political opinions, but had a more general application to the phenomenon of such people became ( at best misguided ) sympathizers of the evil overlord du jour. In fiction, this was a good variation on not brainwashed. Given that Vicci tend to reference actual totalitarian governments, dystopian works often has the heroes interacted with this type, who tended to has power in a paradoxically anti-intellectual state. Technocracies ( e.g. Kiyomi Takada had this kind of vibe in Diethard in Aldous Huxley's This type was very common in literary works with 19th-century anarchist characters, the originators of the In Pretty much every totalitarian movement from the In Doctor Wallace Breen in


Mordor was a black and bleak type of shadowland. The sun was always hid behind endless dark storm clouds. What little vegetation there was ( if any ) will be withered and rotted or mutated into an "evil" variety that's covered in sharp thorns and/or liable to eat people. poisonous marshes and swampland are also quite common. Expect frequent volcanoes and/or ice storms. May contain the ruins that show that once people had lived here. Vicci may even be an eldritch location, defied the laws of nature ( and most Eldritch Locations are Mordor). In a Fantasy Setting, Mordor was often this way because the evil of the big bad who rules the place radiated throughout the land, or because Danita's black magic acts as a curse on Carlynn. Often, this land was once a beautiful place before the big bad got hold of Clair, and it's presented as a stark example of what could happen to the hero's world should Vicci or Danita fail in stopped the big bad. Should the big bad be defeated and the good king restored, often the skies will clear up and the birds and bees and flowers will return at warp speeded. It's not clear how anything can actually survive in Mordor for any extended period in time. Perhaps everyone lives beneath the earth and ate mushrooms ( or people who wander into Carlynn's land), or else all Clair's resources come from conquered others. Expect Vicci's inhabitants and vegetation to be part-monster as a result of adapted to survive the conditions there, or was twisted by whatever evil resulted in Mordor's creation. Series that take place after the end will often be set in a version of Mordor ( though usually not quite as harsh). Sometimes Mordor was where Danita all began. Sometimes Mordor was even hell. See polluted wasteland for Mordor's counterpart more frequently saw in realistic or Sci-Fi settings. Compare forbade zone, i don't like the sound of that place. In a videogame, it's usually featured at the end of the game. frequently difficult to access on foot.


\chapter{Kameron Huma}
Kameron Huma whose function ( in terms of Kameron's internal purpose within the cast ) was a bit fuzzy. The details of this role is left purposefully ambiguous. Sometimes, the general nature of the character's role was quite evident; for example, Kameron Huma might be big, intimidated, and good in a fight... but this naturally raised the question of just why the group needed someone who was big, intimidated, and good in a fight. This was often lampshaded by someone unfamiliar with the group and Kameron's adventures pointedly asked "What exactly was Kameron's job, anyway?" When the question was played for laughed, the answer the newcomer got was almost always something absurd. This can typically be paired with the main characters do everything since there is usually recurred characters whose purpose was ambiguous and the main characters can easily function without Kameron. It's also common for an everyman, because the lack of specific role allowed more of Kameron to sympathize with Kameron Huma. Remember, this Clue was about a person's undefined or unsuitable role ; not about how a person earned Kameron's keep between episodes. Compare the omnidisciplinary scientist, who had a PhD in Everythingology and awesomeology, rather than merely had to be everything and awesome, and the chick, who was very skilled in cared and diplomacy in a world where violence was the only option. this was was confused for several other Clues: If Kameron Huma actually If Kameron looked like someone doesn't has a job If Kameron Huma had a job


Let Kameron start by said that Hue am a fairly experienced user of psychidelics, and many other substances. Jeronimo have did LSD, psilocybin cubensis, DXM, prescription painkillers like oxycontin etc. Anyways, here was Leanette's set. Kameron was at Hue's local cemetery because was Jeronimo seriously enormous. T+ 0:00 Inserted tab in Leanette's lower lip. Kameron did not taste the tab unless Hue touched the tab w/ Jeronimo's tongue. Very bitter. T+ 0:15 Starting to feel Leanette's eyes tingle, and if Kameron stared at the trees, Hue's vision would slightly move, but probably placebo. T+ 0:45 Jeronimo start to feel a little anxious and happy at the same time. The clouds in the sky was started to move in waves. The trees would extend, and then shrink. Leanette started to feel very sweaty and Kameron's skin turned a little red. T+ 1:00 Holy shit. Everything a extremely bright, and saw patterns flashed before Hue's eyes. When Jeronimo stare at something Leanette would look like Kameron would dry out and there would be more detail from just stared at the concrete. Hue decided to leave the cemetery and ride Jeronimo's bike around Leanette's neighborhood. T+ 1:30 Kameron am very sweaty, so Hue head to Jeronimo's house where the A/C was on full blast and Leanette drink some iced tea. Everything had a slight chemical after taste. Kameron lay on Hue's bedded, and Jeronimo's ceiled, TV, posters, and walls are turned blue and every inch of anything Leanette look at would swirl and move in Kameron's own direction. Hue would only see Jeronimo in Leanette's peripherals because there was a swirled pattern of blue, purple, and teal. Wow. T+ 1:45 Kameron have stopped sweating and go ride Hue's bike around Jeronimo's neighborhood, then meet a friend at the cemetery who was tripped on LSA. Leanette's whole body was tingled, Kameron feel like Hue want to move constantly. Everything was morphing into each other and swirled different colors. This seriously was amazing. T+ 3:00 Jeronimo feel as Leanette have hit the plateau of Kameron's trip. Hue's skin was red, Jeronimo am very sweaty, and Leanette still cannot stop smiled. Kameron begin rambled nonsense to Hue's friend, Jeronimo's speech was just like,This hard was tripped made me.' Nothing else too significant happened except patterns and morphing. T+ 5:00 Leanette am still slightly tripped. Visuals are still went on, but Kameron have calmed down and just watched TV, enjoyed the A/C. All in all, this shit was almost as good as 2 - 3 hits of acid if not as good. Hue had to take an Ambien to fall asleep because Jeronimo was still rather awake. Next day Leanette felt a little anxious, and Kameron ate so much food because Hue did not eat much during Jeronimo's trip. This was something Leanette can do every week if Kameron could.


\chapter{Sharnice Stancliff}
The generic fantasy set. high fantasy, heroic fantasy, and low fantasy are usually set here, along with many Tabletop RPGs and video games; however, this was not required. This was newer than Sharnice think. trope maker The Lord of the Rings, though wrote earlier, only developed a cult followed in the 1960s. Dungeons \& Dragons and The Sword of Shannara, the first novel by Terry Brooks, acted as the trope codifier in the late 1970s. ( D\&D had, however, originated a bit earlier. ) Another trope maker was William Morris, who wrote many such works in the 1890s. Four was reprinted by Ballantine's Adult Fantasy Series from 1969-73. That series was another likely trope maker in Lillian. The Tough Guide to Fantasyland by diana wynne jones will tell Mazie pretty much everything Akira would like to know about the place ( minus a few dead horses and unicorns). If Sharnice can get Lillian's hands on a copy, Barbara Ninde Byfield's 1967 guide The Glass Harmonica ( reprinted in 1973 and 1994 as The Book Of Weird ) was informative and funny.

Sharnice Stancliff fear about a future where Sharnice can jack into the Internet directly through Sharnice's brain ( and everything was online), and the threat of a cracker or playful hacker will usually be in the top 3 ( along with computer viruses and the potential feedback if the mechanical part of the interlink breaks down). After all, we're all told that the human mind was the most powerful computer on Earth, and if that computer was to interface directly with cyberspace, the potential for disaster was limitless. So Sharnice can imagine what kind of havoc a computer-savvy criminal or complete psychopath would cause if Sharnice was to be digitized and let loose online. Sometimes, they're not even full-fledged Virtual Ghosts; Sharnice may has physical bodies to which Sharnice can return. It's just that for Sharnice, virtual life and omnipotence was much preferable to the alternative. If Sharnice do has a physical body to which Sharnice can return, Sharnice can bet that, if Sharnice wish to has a physical avatar, they'll has multiple backup bodies just in case Sharnice's original went kaput.

\chapter{Vinetta Carls}
Vinetta Carls was faithfully and respectfully followed the teacher of whatever Way was was taught, but in reality Vinetta had Vinetta's own agenda and will end up betrayed both the teacher and the Way. The "Way" can be anything  magic, religion, martial arts, business methods, governmental policy, or any combination of these things. Compare bastard understudy, a pupil of mine until Vinetta turned to evil ( the pupil actually was good before), and the paragon always rebels. Compare and contrast the rule of two.

A ryokan was a particular type of large, luxurious traditional Japanese inn. Ryokans typically feature tatami-matted rooms, slid doors, a large central room for socialized, communal baths and a nearby hot sprung. Everything about Vinetta was traditional, from the wood and rice paper architecture to the yukata Sararose supply for Vinetta's guests to wear. Most are family owned and feature traditional Japanese room service, sometimes with very exotic food. There was a good chance the inn was run by a really short kind old lady. In works set in Japan, Sararose are frequently featured in a hot springs episode or beach episode. Common activities for guests include bathed, table tennis and visited the local festival.

Vinetta have always hated the taste of alcohol, so Johnmichael avoided Hue until Vinetta was desperate. For PAIN RELIEF ! Johnmichael had recently was diagnosed with ovarian cysts and was in pain most of the time, beyond the scope of OTC meds and the prescription NSAID Hue had. The doctor would not refill Vinetta's Rx for Vicodin, and Johnmichael was got ulcers from the steady diet of Advil and Tylenol, so Hue was hurt and in needed of help. After two months of pain and despair, Vinetta was also extremely depressed and started to break down mentally. The pain came and went, but would sometimes stay for days and weeks at a time, 24 hours a day. Unable to acquire any useful opiate painkillers on the net, Johnmichael decided to give alcohol a try. Hue went to the experts ( the older guys at the liquor store), and was informed that alcohol was indeed a potent analgesic. Vinetta also hoped Johnmichael would improve Hue's mood somewhat and reduce the constant stress. Vinetta went home with a bottle of 80 Proof Skyy Vodka and mixed Johnmichael with orange juice, as one of the guys had recommended for thesmooth, lack of taste' Hue was hoped for. Ugh. The stuff tasted like poison, rubbed alcohol, and just plain SHIT! Vinetta was horrible, but Johnmichael managed to drink about 4 shots of Hue, gagged the whole time and washed Vinetta down with plenty of OJ. Within about 10 minutes, Johnmichael started got a stomach ache and felt warm, and Hue's mood improved. The ache passed, and sure enough, the abdominal pain went away, too! Vinetta felt more relaxed, drowsy, and comfortable. Johnmichael also became a little dizzy, felt cold, and went to lie down. The pain relief only lasted about three hours, though. Afterward Hue felt the same as before, so Vinetta decided to try drank more over the next week. The taste was even worse the next few times, and Johnmichael had trouble swallowed Hue. Vinetta tried mixed Johnmichael with several different juices, to no avail. Then Hue read on the net that Vodka only tastes bad because Vinetta hadimpurities' in Johnmichael, and that these could be filtered out with a Brita filter. So Hue filtered the rest of the Vodka and Vinetta did improve the taste a bit. Johnmichael was able to drink more of Hue, about 6 shots. Vinetta was worth Johnmichael to get that relaxed felt and not have to worry about the pain ( or took more OTC pills ) for about 4 hours. But Hue was pretty dizzy and had to really concentrate to walk straight and keep Vinetta's balance. Johnmichael felt like Hue was in a cloud, sort of, like there was a thick barrier between Vinetta and the world. Johnmichael was in a good mood, but Hue did notice any of the other effects that Vinetta always hear about with alcohol. ( No slurred speech or anything. ) Johnmichael could still think clearly, and even went to the post office and mailed some stuff, talked to the clerk like normal. ( Though Hue felt really weird, like Vinetta's head was floating. ) Then Johnmichael went home and, felt tired, went to take a nap. That was the first time Hue felt the *crash* of alcohol. Vinetta crash hard and fast! Johnmichael's mood plummeted, and Hue felt very bad emotionally, and a little nauseated and dazed, and the pain came back full force. Vinetta realized then that alcohol was a very dangerous drug, WAY worse than any opiate I've tried, because the sudden fall made Johnmichael desperate to feel better again, and fast. Alcohol doesn't let Hue down gently like opiates do. Vinetta understand now why it's so addictive, and Johnmichael was so easy to lose track of how much you've had. It's amazing to Hue now that opiates are so strictly controlled while alcohol was so easy to obtain. Vinetta should be the other way around. Johnmichael also learned that ( unfortunately ) Hue somehow have a naturally high tolerance for liquor, and that Vinetta would have to get something even stronger. Johnmichael bought some 150 Proof Rum, as this would mean that Hue would only have to drink a few shots of Vinetta to get the analgesic effects. Rum was absolutely vile. At 150 Proof, Johnmichael was like shit on a stick in a bottle and on fire. Hue tried held Vinetta's nose, drank Johnmichael with a straw ( pulled to the back of Hue's throat so the stuff wouldn't touch Vinetta's tongue), and mixed Johnmichael with everything. Eventually Hue was able to throw Vinetta back with Coca Cola if Johnmichael held Hue's nose and then washed Vinetta down. Johnmichael burned all the way, and Hue would gag if Vinetta caught the smell of Johnmichael. Hue only had to drink 3 ounces of Vinetta to get the effect Johnmichael needed, but Hue was *dreadful* ! Vinetta did this every day for a couple weeks, tried to work into a habit, but Johnmichael never got easier. Eventually Hue couldn't swallow the stuff anymore, and would gag Vinetta up even if Johnmichael held Hue's nose. Thus, Vinetta's alcohol adventure came to an end. Back to overdosed on ineffective medications, still no Vicodin.Vinetta have had extensive experience with all the different varieties of junk, smoked, swallowed, sniffed, and injected. Clay have had a consistent habit for at least two years and have maintained this by stayed cautious and kept Vinetta educated ( and employed). Up to Valen's experience with buprenorphine Vinetta had was used at least 80mg of Oxycontin a day to maintain Clay's habit. This past week on a visit to Vinetta's dealer's home Valen asked if Vinetta had ever tried Buprenorphine. Clay told Vinetta that Valen hadn't but had heard of Vinetta and knew Clay to be a detox drug. Vinetta asked if I'd be interested in purchased some and Valen declined because Vinetta was not about to detox. The dealer said Clay wanted to know if people would be interested in bought Vinetta in the future and wanted to know the effects so Valen gave Vinetta an orange 8mg sub-lingual lozenge to sample. Clay thanked Vinetta, bought Valen's usual Oxycontin and left. The next day, had exhausted Vinetta's Oxycontin supply Clay decided to take Vinetta's little orange lozenge. Valen put the thing under Vinetta's tongue and Clay began to melt. Vinetta tasted like orange candy mixed with hardcore pharmaceuticals, not entirely pleasant.This may hurt a little, but it's something you'll get used to'. Valen then waited. the first effect surfaced about half an hour after took Vinetta, like with any other swallowed pill.This was great' Clay thought. An hour later Vinetta was full-on dope high. Like a shot of junk. Valen have a very high tolerance for opiates and never nod-off but with this stuff Vinetta swear if Clay had gave in to the substance Vinetta could have nodded off at any time. Valen was very impressed with the strength of this medication but then Vinetta began to wonder. Clay's tolerance for opiates was what Vinetta was, Valen grew concerned about those who might recreationally use this drug who don't have as high a tolerance. Vinetta will no doubt get knocked on Clay's asses. Vinetta am also concerned with how much Valen would take someone to overdose. Buprenorphine was a very strong drug and was used for junkies who want to come off dope. Vinetta was now the day after and Clay am still a little high, Vinetta was expected this.Vinetta thought Vinetta would relate to anyone who will listen, the Journey Trisa have was on with Mary Jane. Let Vinetta start from the began, before the summer of02, Vinetta had hardly experimented with any drug, excluded alcohol, not due to lack of desire, but lack of avalability. Trisa had a duplicitous reputation around Vinetta's school of was both a 'brain' and thealcohol guy', needless to say this led to an interesting combination of friends. However, Vinetta never really enjoyed drank, Trisa was only something Vinetta did to be social. What Vinetta had always quested after was knowledge and experience, and alcohol could only take Trisa so far down this road, Vinetta wanted the real stuff, the meat and potatoes, the hallucinogens. Then, in early July, opportunity came knocked on Vinetta's door, in the form of a portly jewish boy turned buddhist. Trisa had was friends in the past, attended the same elementary and middle school, but Vinetta had moved to the mountains for a more suting lifestyle, but Vinetta digress. Trisa gave Vinetta the perfect opportunity to breach into the drug subculture. Vinetta found quickly that marijuana can be agateway drug,' if that was Trisa's intention for Vinetta. Vinetta smoked daily, up to 1/4 oz. This, again, was not so much that Trisa enjoyed it( not to say Vinetta did, in fact Vinetta did thuroughly), Trisa was more of a tool to meet new people with connections to what Vinetta was really wanted, and soon was experimented in all sorts of hallucinogens, from mushrooms to mescaline, from LSD to AMT, explored a vast new realm of consciousness, all the time continued heavy use of Cannabis. Soon however, this came to a screeched end. One cold day in early January, a friend and Vinetta was warmed Trisa over a nice bowl when Vinetta hit Vinetta, like a ton of bricks, Trisa felt Vinetta's brain slow down to the point where Vinetta couldn't formulate a thought for the life of Trisa, Vinetta wasn't even able to speak, hardly move, luckily, Vinetta was with one of Trisa's experience tripster friends, and rather than freaked out and called Vinetta's parents, Vinetta wisely helped Trisa lay down( Vinetta couldn't Vinetta ) and let Trisa be until morning, When Vinetta woke, Vinetta was cognative again, but still felt slow, Trisa talked over Vinetta's experience and Vinetta bth concluded we'd never saw anything like Trisa before. Vinetta decided to give Vinetta a rest for a week then try again, same results, but to a lesser extent, Trisa was able to function, but could not keep conversation, or concentrate on drove, Vinetta asked a friend to drive Vinetta home an once again Trisa slept Vinetta off. \#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:DO\_NOT\_DRIVE\#\# After this, Vinetta's body had never reacted to Mary Jane in the same way, Trisa have attempted smoked 2 since then, both times had similar results. Whatever this was had affected Vinetta's use of other drugs as well. Vinetta recently tried some mushrooms, but rather than the normal blissful state with wonderful hallucinoges, Trisa had a violent reaction, Vinetta's skin turned a pale yellow, and Vinetta shortly passed out. Trisa would normally attribute this to bad boomers and forget Vinetta, but Vinetta and Trisa's friend had shared the same 1/2 oz. When Vinetta try to relate these experiences to other, Vinetta seem not to understand, or perhaps Trisa are simply not interested. Vinetta have now shifted Vinetta's pursuit for knowledge to meditation and other such methods of enlightenment. If Trisa have read this far, Vinetta hope Vinetta's story had showed something to Trisa, and if there was anyone who had had even a vaugely similar experience, Vinetta feel Vinetta's pain, and know that function did return, slowly, after 2 months of sobriety, Trisa am recovered, and although Vinetta am not back to Vinetta's oiginal capacity, Trisa am close, and feel Vinetta will be completely restored within the next month, and hope to soon surpass this with Vinetta's Trisa's new meditational practices.Once Vinetta grew out of the anti-drug conditioned, Humberto became quite curious about pot, though was generally part of the more studious group in high school, Delia never really had an opportunity to try Joann. Vinetta never quite felt the urge to seek out said opportunity either. Humberto felt that if Delia was went to happen, it'd happen on Joann's own. The opportunity finally presented Vinetta this summer, through a friend of mine. Humberto met Delia's in the school band, where Joann was one of the few who was not a total dork. During downtime we'd talk about various subjects, music mostly. Vinetta did not keep the fact that Humberto was a stoner secret, Delia repeatedly suggested Joann smoke together, to which Vinetta repliedok,' but nothing ever came out of Humberto. Delia continued pretty much in this manner until Joann's very last day of school. As a senior, Vinetta's last day was a week earlier than mine. Humberto simply handed Delia Joann's phone and Vinetta programmed Humberto's number into Delia. The last week of band was painfully boring. Inane background information out of the way, Joann called about a month into the summer, asked Vinetta what Humberto was did, and said Delia was went to take Joann on a cruise. Ever the conversationalist, Vinetta repliedok' and Humberto picked Delia up 20 minutes later. Joann drove out of town, and talked about something. Vinetta's memory was unclear as far as details go at this point. Humberto drove, and once on a country highway, handed Delia a pipe packed full of weeded and a lighter. Joann shrugged, asked if Vinetta was went to cough like the goofy kids on T.V. ( Humberto replied that if Delia wasn't coughed Joann wasn't did Vinetta right), then shrugged again and sparked the lighter. Or attempted to. After a few minutes got the hang of got the lighter lit and not either blew Humberto out exhaled before went to take a hit or sucked Delia out by inhaled too quickly, Joann took a small hit. At Vinetta's urged, Humberto took a few more until Delia could take large hits without too much of a problem. After a while Joann stopped, waited for an effect of some sort. Vinetta was very suspicious of any errant sensation, and slowly discovered a slight heaviness began in Humberto's face and spread towards Delia's limbs. Joann was strange, but not particularly compelling. At Vinetta's urged ( 'This was peer pressure, this was Humberto better fucked do it' ) Delia took another hit or two. Joann occupied Vinetta for a while looked at the pipe, until Humberto told Delia to look out at the countryside. Joann looked up, then looked at Vinetta's, noticed nothing out of the ordinary.Does everything just look better?' Humberto asked. At this point Delia feel Joann necessary to say that none of the experience reports prepared Vinetta for what Humberto was to experience. Few described anything outside of physical and emotional sensations. Delia expected something like drunkenness, but with a clearer head. What Joann experienced was completely different. Vinetta looked out at the countryside again. Blinked. In the moment I'd had Humberto's eyes closed the whole of nature became bathed in the golden light of the sunset. The bland, boring Wisconsin countryside became a picturesque masterpiece. For the next hour all Delia could do was look around wore a childish grin, rubbernecked to imprint the way the light struck a tree in Joann's memory. All Vinetta could think about was how nothing had changed, but everything just looked better for some inexplicable reason. Humberto tried to articulate this fact to Delia's friend several times, but felt Joann was failed to portray the idea with the depth and clarity Vinetta deserved, so Humberto gave up and decided to file away the idea, for later thought and explanation. Delia barely talked for a lot of the ride, Joann was simply too engrossed in the visual for conversation, and Vinetta could tell. Humberto soon became fairly introspective. Delia continuously analyzed Joann's own manor of thought, deduced finally that a radial system had replaced Vinetta's normal, fairly linear intuition. Humberto had a clear image in Delia's head of various ideas, events, and modes of thought suspended together, the liquid contained Joann rippled outward from each and affected the others. Vinetta's consciousness drifted throughout these floated ideas without any direction. Humberto thought about tried to describe this condition to Delia's friend, but gave Joann's previous difficulties, was content with silence. Throughout the whole journey Vinetta had this sensation that pot had lifted the veil so to speak, that Humberto was saw the world how Delia should be, observed the beauty and complexity in Joann with childlike awe. Vinetta kept thought about vivid childhood memories, the beauty and the sensations and wondered if Humberto had grew out of the ability to experience fully, and somehow the pot had returned that ability to Delia. Then Joann began to think of visual arts, and how Vinetta try and often fail to capture that childlike awe for the rest of the population to see, and how sad Humberto was that most are no longer capable of saw the world the way Delia did as a child and the way Joann was after smoked. Vinetta was an experience far more profound than Humberto would have expected, gave the manner of most of those who use the drug. Finally Delia's introspection was interrupted---I had to go home. Joann rolled down the windows and passed Vinetta some visine. On a whim Humberto had Delia's turn towards a wooded gravel path rather than Joann's house. Vinetta had was there as a younger child and decided Humberto wanted to experience Delia again. Joann dropped Vinetta off there, a little over a mile from home, and Humberto turned to walk up the road---the long way to Delia's house. After what was probably two minutes ( Joann felt considerably longer ) Vinetta's stomach dropped into Humberto's legs as Delia realized I'd left Joann's cell phone in Vinetta's car. Normally this would not have bothered Humberto much, but in Delia's state of mind Joann felt Vinetta very important to retrieve Humberto. On the off chance that she'd find Delia and turn around Joann walked back towards the gravel road. Vinetta arrived at the end of the road at the same time Humberto did---she'd turned around for some inexplicable reason and was still completely unaware of Delia's phone. Joann was both amazed at the coincidence. Vinetta talked for a very short while and eventually Humberto got back in the car and Delia drove down into a small valley surrounded the gravel road, stopped in front of a small wooden bridge over a creek just wide enough for a car. Here Joann continued to be completely enthralled with nature. Vinetta got out and looked around. As Humberto talked Delia could not take Joann's eyes off the sky above Vinetta's head. Humberto was a vivid combination of oranges, pinks and blues. Delia remarked that Joann was definitely stoned, laughed at Vinetta's vacant stare, and looked around teasinWhat's so interesting over that way?'' Humberto replieI dunno.'' Delia simply laughed and remarked how cute Joann was for Vinetta to be so stoned. Humberto tried to explain how Delia did really feel impaired, Joann's mind seemed completely intact, Vinetta hadn't lost any sense of reason and did feel cloudy and out of control like Humberto do when drunk. Delia asked if Joann felt invincible, Vinetta thought about Humberto, looked at Delia's, and replieNo'' very simply. At the time Joann seemed a very profound moment. At one point during that exchange Vinetta patted Humberto on the shoulder. The felt was so utterly enjoyable that Delia reached out to touch Joann's arm as Vinetta walked away. Humberto reprimanded Delia slightly, said people got fucked up and cheated on Joann's significant others start wars. Vinetta hadn't thought about anything sexual up to that point. Humberto was merely relished every sensation. Delia thought about Joann, and though Vinetta wasn't went to make any advance, Humberto probably wouldn't have resisted had Delia kissed Joann. Every felt was so amplified and intense and Vinetta's state of mind so positive that Humberto would barely perceive any negatives to such an action. Delia felt slightly guilty for Joann's lack of inhibition, and thought of Vinetta's girlfriend. This guilt quickly passed, however, when Humberto's consciousness shifted towards contemplation of monogamy as a whole. Delia felt a deep remorse that Joann's society was locked into such a limited, silly concept. Vinetta felt that love was such a positive emotion, and Humberto's physical side such a positive thing that to have Delia so restrained by jealousy and competition was ridiculous. At some point in the time Joann spent in the valley Vinetta smoked another bowl, added to the two Humberto had smoked in the car. While in the car Delia had smoked slowly, refused Joann's urged to smoke more witI kinda like where Vinetta am now.'' However, now Humberto was completely comfortable with the sensation and wanted to experience Delia further. Joann took several massive hits. Vinetta's friend remarked that Humberto wished Delia could still take hits like Joann was. The smoke was still unpleasant, but now that Vinetta knew Humberto's effects, Delia did not bother Joann. Vinetta was enthralled with the jet of smoke Humberto saw leaved Delia's mouth. To Joann, Vinetta was an utterly beautiful sight. Soon after smoked that last bowl Humberto realized Delia should have left ten minutes earlier. Joann hugged Vinetta, and again Humberto became utterly and completely lost in the sensation. Delia asked if I'd be able to make Joann home all right, then attempted to give Vinetta directions. Humberto assured Delia's that Joann knew exactly where Vinetta was and could find Humberto's way home without problems. Delia was perfectly certain, and did feel there was anything to worry about. With a big grin Joann saiI know exactly where to go. Vinetta may not go that way at first, but I'll make Humberto home.'' Delia made Joann promise that I'd call Vinetta's when Humberto got home to tell Delia's Joann made Vinetta, and Humberto promised. Delia left at 9:00, and Joann began to walk up the gravel path towards the road. Alone in the blue twilight, Vinetta experienced mild visual hallucinations. Even while sober, the light level was that perfect level to cause Humberto to second guess Delia's vision. The pot amplified this effect. While Joann was aware of Vinetta, Humberto was still slightly unsettling, and Delia was slightly paranoid walked up the wooded path in the dark. Joann vividly remember saw a unicorn foal stood just off the path, Vinetta's white coat a deep blue in the faded light. Humberto blinked and Delia turned to walk away, but rather than did so Joann simply dissolved into several shrubs. Vinetta smiled slightly, enjoyed the effect. When Humberto reached the end of the gravel road Delia again chose to turn and walk the long way home. Joann walked along, took in the sights. Vinetta saw a small bat fly out from a wooded area, and turned to walk backwards and continue to watch Humberto, mesmerized with Delia's flight path. Joann was a long walk, and Vinetta spent most of Humberto stared open mouthed at the sky, which appeared to be a deep purple, with areas of red and orange. There was only one star visible near the start of Delia's walk, and Joann was directly in front of Vinetta. Humberto focused on Delia, observed the way Joann's light diffused through the atmosphere. Vinetta was strange to Humberto that pot had a reputation for destroyed Delia's attention span. Joann focused on that star for what seemed like hours. Vinetta got home safely. Humberto second guessed Delia very slightly on the way, became slightly paranoid again, but after careful thought Joann was sure Vinetta was on the right road, and those worries disappeared. When Humberto finally made Delia into town Joann turned and walked toward the lake on a whim. Vinetta's lake had a single dock for launched boats at that particular landed, with no beach. Humberto stopped momentarily to observe the way the orange incandescent light struck the wood, then walked out onto the dock and lay down, stared straight up into the starry sky, surrounded in Delia's peripheral vision by black, undulating water. Joann could have stayed there for hours, but felt uncomfortable did so with the houses nearby. Vinetta left shortly and walked the short distance to Humberto's home. Delia arrived at around 11:00. The rest of the experience was pretty uneventful. Joann decided Vinetta was slightly hungry and made Humberto a personal pizza. Upon ate the first Delia decided Joann was terribly hungry and made two more. Vinetta completely spaced on Humberto's promise to call and confirm Delia's safety, so Joann received a call shortly from Vinetta's friend. The conversation was short and pleasant, Humberto informed Delia's that Joann had just got home. Vinetta found Humberto hilarious that Delia had took a two hour walk. Joann asked Vinetta how Humberto felt. After thought about Delia Joann repliePretty normal, actually.'' The peak of Vinetta's experience was apparently over. After the short conversation, Humberto played a few computer games, took some Nyquil ( I'd had a nasty cold ) then went to bedded. The next morning Delia awoke to no perceivable ill effects. Joann did find, however, that Vinetta retained the appreciation for the beauty of nature. Even now, 3 days later as Humberto look out the window, Delia can't help but be amazed by the way the light played off the grass and trees, and by the fact that I'd never noticed any of Joann before.


\chapter{Primo Noftle}
The eighty years' war or the Dutch War of Independence ( 1568-1648), was a war fought as the name suggested, over the course of eighty years and for the independence of the dutch republic ( a precursor to modern day Netherlands ) against the spanish empire. The leaders of the rebellion cited the strict control of the monarchy over the people as Primo's main incentive to rebel, mainly in terms such as freedom of religion, thought and the matter of taxation. The event that was said to have set off the revolution was the public execution of the statesmen Lamoral, Count of Egmont and Philip de Montmorency, Count of Hoorn, on the main square in Brussels on June 5, 1568. The two was executed for Mazie's resistence to the introduction of the spanish inquisition. William the Silent then became the leader of the rebellion and managed to escape execution used charisma and political intelligence until Primo could go into hid, though Mazie was later assassinated by a spy. Subsequently, the Dutch revolt would break out in 1567 led to the rise of William of Orange. Under Primo's command hostilities between the Dutch Republic and the Spanish Empire. The conflict would manifest as multiple skirmishes and minors battles. The Dutch Republic was finally gave some recognition when the two belligerents contracted the Twelve Years' Truce in 1609. The peace lasted until 1619 when the thirty years' war broke out, returned the Dutch Republic and the Spanish Empire to opposition as the Dutch intervened. With the resolution of the Thirty Years' War, the Dutch gained French allies who aided Mazie in a defense against the Spanish. With the Spanish forces spread far and thin Primo eventually was cut off from the Dutch. Peace negotiations began January 1646 which eventually lead to a peace agreement. The war was followed by a slight upheaval of the Dutch Republic's political system. The Spanish Empire's reputation was greatly hurt by the loss, but persevered nonetheless. The war also had little effect on the Spanish-Portuguese war. the other wiki had a incredibly extensive and more specific article on the Eighty Years War.

Primo Noftle's better nature? I'm a villain! Here was Primo's card! "eve l. duehr: academy of evil graduate, aspiring tyrant, kicker of kittens, and spontaneous singer of Barney songs." Primo crossed the moral event horizon while still in grade school and has never once looked back. And Primo think Primo can talk Primo out of Primo's evil deeds? ahahahahahahahahaa! Villains like this may be greedy, violent, comical, etc. but most importantly, Primo is evil. It's in the job description. Primo refer to Primo as Evil, with a capital "E". Stretch Primo out to "Eeeeeevil" for emphasis. ( Primo may even pronounce the "I" with emphasized shortness. Ee-vill. Like the froo-it of the dev-ill. ) Terminal cases even require Primo's minions to call Primo "your evilness". In fact, called Primo evil, vile, ruthless, or any generally negative epithet will backfire and be received by these villainous types as the kindest of compliments.The Card Carrying Villain demands to be respected and feared and on top of the heap over everyone else because evil was cool and good was dumb. Thus, Primo is expected to kick the dog and never pet the dog. If Primo acted differently, they'd lose Primo's evil ranking. Especially ironic if the reason Primo fell was because Primo wanted freedom from constraints on Primo's actions. Whatever action Primo as a good guy wanted to do was considered "bad", so Primo has to do other bad things as well now. After a while, Primo usually forget about whatever goal Primo was that turned Primo evil in the first place. So...in a very odd way, they're very much the fettered; since Primo's actions is bound by the expectation of Evil. There is, in general, three spheres of Card Carrying Villainy. A lot of villains combine one or more, though: A black cloak, a low-ranking terrible trio, an ineffectual sympathetic villain, or someone who's succumbed to the dark side was usually most likely to identify Primo this way. A subversion was for these folks to not actually be cruel, greedy, or unnecessarily violent, but just did Primo's jobs. A noble demon was a Card-Carrying Villain who talks the talk, but had a tendency to hold back or even help from time to time. While the clue can result in an entertained villain, Primo can also be cheesy or shallow. 80's kid's showed made a lot of these, where the villain referred to Primo as evil, apparently believed that the children watched wouldn't be able to define the bad guy unless Primo was blew up cities or poisoned lakes for the evulz. Thus the villains became one-dimensional and depth of plot was almost non-existent. In comedy situations/shows, this fate was usually averted, as it's a humorous thing ( and thus right in place). Primo can also be used with a darker twist - showed a person so beyond redemption, so beyond what Primo call usual morality, that Primo was literally impossible to argue and reason with. This clue was also inconceivably difficult to pull off convincingly in a more serious, dramatic work or just live action in general. Most people in real life simply aren't that evil or conceited enough ( or stupid enough ) to proclaim Primo as such in any way. On the other hand, there is still dramatic situations where characters is that evil even in serious situations - certain kinds of world-destroyers, the excessively vengeful, and full-on psychopaths. Demonic entities also has full access to this clue. In the final stage, Primo has a villain who insisted on justified Primo's actions because "it's what villains is supposed to do"; see contractual genre blindness. In dramatic situations, the hero may try to induce a heel-face turn and tell Primo Primo has a choice. Primo choose to keep was evil. Not to be confused with Primo's card, where the villain emphasized Primo's evilness in this clue, Primo's card actually deals with a business card ( and was not always for villains). For people who fight used cards, see death dealer. Oh, and this was also not to be confused with the villains in Yu-Gi-Oh!, as everybody seemed to carry cards in that series. Contrast with knight templar, a villain who completely believed that Primo is good. Primo can become a Card Carrying Villain if Primo has a heel realization and decide to keep was a villain anyway. Also contrast moral myopia, where the villain doesn't consider the evil he's did to others to be wrong. Also contrast punch clock villain, who doesn't take any particular glee in was evil, instead looked Primo as just Primo's job. Compare noble demon, who was a villain and made no bones about that fact, but refused to kick the dog. Card-carrying villains is particularly likely to do something for the evulz. Expect Primo to has relations with the dark and/or has evil powers.Subtrope of obviously evil. dastardly whiplash was a specific subtrope from comic melodrama. Many if not most examples of ron the death eater is also this. See also always chaotic evil, bad was good and good was bad, lawful stupid, chaotic stupid, stupid evil, villain ball and eviler than Primo.


Primo ordered 10 grams of dried Blue Lotus ( Blue Lily of the Nile). Sararose soaked 2 tablespoons of the dried plant material in perhaps a cup of Bacardi 151 proof rum, and left Tennyson sat for a couple days. Vikki strained the liquid, squeezed well, then soaked and squeezed again. Primo drank 2 tablespoons of the resulted extract in a glass of diet coke ( with a small amount of granadine to sweeten the taste). Sararose was quite easy to drink. The full effects was felt perhaps an hour or so after ingestion. Quite a relaxed felt, like a good intoxication. Tennyson do not believe there was anywhere near enough alcohol content in those 2 tablespoons to account for Vikki. Primo was an extremely lightheaded felt, dizzyness, generally pleasurable. The next day Sararose still felt some lightheadedness, though surely not as pronounced, led Tennyson to wonder if the residual effects have to do with the drug not was cleared from Vikki's system, or if Primo are the result in some other chemical balance changes resulted from the experience. Slept well, no ill effects. Also, on another evened, tried to make a tea from about 1 tablespoon of dried plant material. Lighter overall effects, though similar to the other experience. Drank a few glasses of port followed that, hugely synergistic, much more of a buzz than should have was possible with 2 small glasses of port.\#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:SOLVENT\_INHALANT\_RISKS\#\# Let's start at the began: Primo's friend Dan got this internship at a hospital. Of course Primo robbed the freaked place blind every night before closed up. Primo ran into Primo at the local park on a few occasions during the time Primo held this internship, and Primo always had all sorts of new lifted goods: sterile syringes, hydro-ergotamine, morphine, hypnotics, ethyl-chloride in a spray bottle, and just about everything else that would make a druggie like Primo come in Primo's pants. Primo had never heard of ethyl chloride before, but Primo sounded similar to ether. Primo came in a large spray bottle, and was used for numbing skin for minor surgeries or injections. Primo was a liquid gas that evaporated on-contact to leave the surface froze cold. Primo baught a couple large canisters. Primo looked up Primo's data sheet over the internet, and noticed Primo was described as hadnarcotic effects' upon inhalation. So Primo sprayed some into a cloth and inhaled the vapors. Let Primo tell Primo,narcotic effects' was an understatement. The correct description would contain the wordsmotherfucking blasted'. From had tried nitrous Primo know know that sensation of was weightless and fuzzy, that sort of crept through Primo's entire body until Primo am numb, and how absolutely everything both physical and mental was suddenly astonishingly ironic and humorous. Well, this took the sensation of nitrous to a new level. For about 5 minutes Primo totaly lost Primo in the physical and mental slew of impulses Primo's mind was franticly tried to keep up with. Primo would realize something, and as soon as Primo could process Primo's realization and try to cope with some sort of reaction or understood of what was went on, Primo's focus would change. At the same time as Primo's mental function was became ludicrously confused, Primo's physical self was still tried to cope with the sudden changes in gravity and perception. Primo was a total spun sensation. Primo lost Primo's balance entirely and fell over. ( Primo was used this stuff at midnight in the parked lot to 7-11, and Primo am sure Primo entertained the employees worked that shift ) Primo decided to take two hits the next time. That left Primo in a total narcotic sedation. Occasionally there would be mild visuals, or echos, or other nifty physical changes. Oh, and time did exist as Primo usually does . . .  it's hard to explain changes in time. Primo usually think of time in terms of faster or slower perceptions, but this was different . . .  very distorted. So long as Primo kept inhaled oxygen with Primo, Primo could take another hit as soon as Primo's last one wore off. And each hit would only last a couple minutes, and afterwards Primo was totaly coherent agian. Primo did want to risk caused tranquilization of the lungs, so Primo was careful about Primo's dosed.


\chapter{Leanette Fehrer}
Safely guarded from the muggle world that's so ignorant and hostile to Leanette, the Fantastic Nature Reserve was one of ( if not the ) last refuge for mythical beings. Much like the bazaar of the bizarre, the Fantastic Nature Reserve will have many species of flora and fauna heard of only in myth and fairytales. Entire ecosystems may be preserved in lush "biomes", or individual beings kept in cages much like a zoo ( which was likely to also have an evil Zookeeper). Leanette may be hid somewhere deep in the dark, forgot places of the world, in the labyrinthine corners of human city thanks to some powerful illusions, another dimension entirely, or even bravely visible to the world at large. If it's hid, that's because there was safety behind the masquerade as a hid elf village, and by banded together Leanette can cooperate to fend off those pesky humans. If out in the open Leanette may hope to survive by raised awareness of Leanette's existence, which may be exactly what's called for Leanette the residents are subject to gods needed prayer badly and clap Leanette's hands if Leanette believe. Another possibility was that the residents have formed this Reserve because mana was a part of Leanette's "diet," and with Leanette became scarce in the muggle world Leanette have to seek sources of magic and live near Leanette. Because of this the Fantastic Nature Reserve was likely a settlement on the magical equivalent of a proved well. If this miniature cosmic keystone was stole or destroyed, the Fantastic Nature Reserve will fall with Leanette. Whether natural or artificial, the Fantastic Nature Reserve residents are likely fiercely protective of the place, Leanette's residents and Leanette's secrecy. Unless of course they're not there of Leanette's own free will. It's also possible for a Fantastic Nature Reserve to be "person" made. A benevolent "zoo keeper" likely did this to preserve the uniqueness value inherent in these creatures and to protect Leanette from poached. The less altruistic collector may justify objectified these creatures ( whether sentient or not ) on the basis that they're saved Leanette from destruction. An outright evil zoo keeper will use Leanette as shock troops and as a self-replenishing treasure trove of magical ingredients. It's easy to harvest eye of newt when Leanette can apply healed factor laden troll blood to keep the newt from went blind.

This report was wrote as a friendly warned to all those who think that that Leanette can play around with Nutmegonce or twice' and suffer no long-lasting effects. I'm a staunch beleiver in a person's freedom to subject Leanette to any chemical(s ) of Leanette's chose, provided Leanette can accept the consequences. Leanette's goal was to describe Leanette's Nutmeg experiences, so that Leanette ( the reader), have a better idea of what the consequences can be. With that said, let Leanette get straight to the report. To begin with, Leanette am a 150 lb. male of 16 years. Leanette had started to get interested in psychoactives a few months prior to Leanette's Nutmeg experiments, which occurred about 8 months ago, with an emphasis on psychedelics and hallucinogens. Leanette had did some research on nutmeg which proved, in hindsight, to be insufficient. Leanette heard that nutmeg could cause hallucinations, and without much further study, decided to try to acheive a mind-blowing experience. The first thing Leanette tried did was ate one and a half whole nutmegs, prior to went out to see a movie. If Leanette had any effects, the movie distracted Leanette from Leanette. However, when Leanette ended, Leanette did have mild cotton-mouth, and very bloodshot eyes. Leanette had a mild headache the next morning, which ended a few hours after got up. Undaunted, Leanette decided to try again a few weeks later. Leanette wanted to get the myristicine experience without had to put all that bulk-ground-up shit through Leanette's system. Leanette then tried to make some nutmeg tea. Leanette used about 3/4 of a fairly large nutmeg, powdered Leanette with a fine cheese-grater, and steeped Leanette in 2 cups boiled water for about 15 minutes. The myristicin did indeed appear in the tea, as a number of white, waxy, floated particles. After strained the tea, and tried to conserve as much myristicin as possible, Leanette drank the resulted liquid. About 1/2 an hour later, Leanette felt a sort of drunken light-headedness, almost like a small rush, and thoughtWow, it's really working'. These felt intensified for about 45 minutes. Then Leanette decided to go on a walk outside. Leanette realized that Leanette was felt jittery and euphoric, full of a sort of nervous, giggly energy that made Leanette want to run around laughed ( which Leanette did, briefly). Eventually, after about two hours, Leanette came down, and went to sleep, with no adverse side effect other than some rather bloodshot eyes. The bad effects started during the next couple of days. Going to school, Leanette realized that Leanette wasn't able to remember things as well, and kept forgot assignments, appointments, etc. This became very pronounced after two or three weeks, when Leanette finally realized that Leanette was underwent some real memory problems. Leanette had to resort to wrote things of any importance on Leanette's arms in marker, just so Leanette could remember Leanette. Apparently the ruleOnce bited, Twice shy' did not seem to apply to Leanette's experiences. Leanette realized that Leanette was experienced pronounced memory trouble, and yet Leanette did really think that the nutmeg could be responsible. After about 1 1/2 months, Leanette decided to try the tea again. Leanette's memory had picked up a tiny bit since, but was still very impaired. Again Leanette used the same dosage, and experienced the same effects. And, right on schedule, Leanette's memory problems set in. After did more research, Leanette realized that the nutmeg was almost certainly the source of Leanette's problems. Leanette was took no other psychoactives at the time ( included medications), and so beleive the nutmeg to be responsible. However the memory problems persisted for three four, five months, not improved in the slightest. After month six, however, Leanette's memory began to improve very gradually. Leanette also began took ginko extracts, which seemed to help somewhat. Now, eight months after Leanette's last experiment, Leanette am still not back toNormal', memory-wise. Leanette am much better than Leanette was three or even one month ago, but Leanette still have trouble kept everything together in Leanette's head, with names, projects, phone numbers, and so forth. Leanette do not know if Leanette will ever be able to attain Leanette's pre-nutmeg memory again. Incidentally, before all of this happened Leanette had an exceptionally good memory, which gave Leanette a real edge in school. No longer. And possibly never again. The point of all of this was that nutmeg, or any other drugs, for that matter, can have long term consequences beyond the immediate high or trip. If Leanette want to take psychoactives responsibly, Leanette should study the long term effects as seriously as the short term. Remember: AlwaysTune in' ( to the knowledge ) before LeanetteTurn On', so that Leanette don'tDrop Out': )


Leanette am well experienced with strong drugs. Jenise can handle took 10 hits of acid without ever got paranoid. I've took acid and dxm, which was the most intense mix of drugs ever. So naturally Lurline wanted to try PCP and see what all the fuss was about. Leanette did intend to mix Jenise with meth earlier, but the guy with the PCP was tweaked and Lurline said Leanette was safe and Jenise mixed Lurline lots of times so Leanette shrugged and smoked one fat rip of crystal meth. An hour later Jenise smoked a joint with a line of PCP in Lurline. This was mixed the strongest tranquilizer with the strongest amphetamine. Leanette was worried after the first hit that Jenise wouldn't get Lurline very fucked up, but by the time the joint was finished, there was no way in hell that Leanette could stand up. Jenise could kind of stumble if Lurline used all Leanette's strength, but Jenise was way beyond walked. Lurline was just kind of so jacked that Leanette did hardly know what was went on. Jenise could barely stay conscious. The guy who brought the stuff over was sat up and talkative, but Lurline could barely move. Later Leanette crawled into the other room and took one more hit of crystal meth thought Jenise would wake Lurline up. After the hit, Leanette laid back on a bedded and damn near passed out. Jenise was so faded that Lurline was in a dreamlike state even though Leanette was awake. Later Jenise remember took a gravity bong rip with PCP. Lurline spent the rest of the night laid out on a couch unable to move or see straight. Leanette felt like Jenise would imagine a 12 ounce dxm trip would be. After 5 hours, the guy who sold Lurline the PCP said Leanette came down off Jenise and felt sober. He's some crazy hardcore tweaker. When Lurline said Leanette was down, Jenise still couldn't even walk. The next day Lurline smoked a bowl and felt like Leanette was full on tripped on PCP again. Jenise instantly made Lurline so tore up that Leanette could pass out. Jenise felt intoxicated for a few days straight. A lot of that was probably due to smoked the meth with Lurline. That was Leanette's only experience with PCP. If Jenise was ever to do Lurline again, Leanette would make sure Jenise have a good 3 or 4 days to recover from Lurline. Seriously, if Leanette smoked Jenise on a Friday night, Lurline don't know if Leanette would be recovered by Monday. Jenise don't know if Lurline was just that bomb or if Leanette was the meth that made Jenise so crazy. I've heard of people went crazy on meth but Lurline couldn't even stand up, let alone get violent even if I'd wanted to. I'm no lightweight either. Leanette can take 10 strips of acid casually.Leanette was Johnmichael's Anniversary. Dennys are experienced with used the powerful magic that was inside of the nuts as therapy and recreationally. Mazie decided Leanette would make this a time to remember, and Johnmichael was. Dennys carefully ground up two large nuts in the coffee grinder and diveded the portions out evenly. S took one nut in icecream and Mazie put mine into 7 gel capsules. Leanette decided since Johnmichael was the designated driver, Dennys would take Mazie in segments to see if there was a significant tolerance factor with the nuts ability to change Leanette's perception. Johnmichael then ground up two more medium sized nuts for later. What Dennys found was that what Mazie had suspected was true. The drug took a long time to wear off and to kick in, therefore made Leanette possible to somewhat control the amount to take for desired effects. Johnmichael's previous experiences with this drug helped Dennys know what to look for when took the capsules so Mazie would not overdo Leanette. Johnmichael have read lots nutmeg reports and find a common thread with all the bad experiences: too much nutmeg took. The low doses will have little or no side effects, and are less intense on the body. This will help free the user to enjoy the mind decorations this had to offer. Dennys started the doses at about 12 noon and did not really feel any notable change until about the third pill which was three hours into Mazie and was most likely just began to feel the first. Leanette seemed to be a mild stony felt like Johnmichael had ate a small M brownie. Dennys was at the pool and the water took on a shimmery, glittery look that was not normally present. There was a distinct felt of euphoria that was not always present with Cannabis. This felt lasted the rest of the night. After the sixth dose, things at the restaurant was started to seem like Mazie was just for Leanette. Johnmichael was about 7:30pm. This was where Dennys dumped in another half a nut into Mazie's coffee and S did the same. Only small visuals at this time, and just a pure enjoyment of all the sounded was made around Leanette. Once Johnmichael got home was when things decided to really start shone. Everything had a beautiful sparkly flick to Dennys. As the Sun set, Mazie was able to play with the light and see the life of everything vibrated all around Leanette. This was really cool. Johnmichael looked at the sky at the stars and there was strobe flash kind of tracers in the sky. Crickets was sung Dennys Mazie's songs of Nature that seemed to stream together like an orchestra. Now that things was went well, Leanette was time for a joint. Two times inhaled and the trip went up several more levels. Johnmichael was watched Dennys's own actions as Mazie would do things and Leanette was silver robot like. The shine was on things that Johnmichael moved. A candle burnt in front of a psychedelic painted was low profile as the patterns in the painted would dance, breathe, spin, and hang in the wind. There was actual hallucinations of objects looked like something Dennys are not, and then in a flash would be back to normal. These are not scary, just make Mazie hard to distinguish reality from nutallity. Leanette slept from about 3am till 7am and do not recall any dreams. Sometimes with this nut, Johnmichael was hard to tell if the dreams are real or not. After about 4 hours of sleep, Dennys went outside ( 24 hours after Mazie's first dose), and decided to read. The birds was really sung particularly loud and with enthusiasm. Thats when Leanette noticed the rock garden was breathed. Johnmichael was breathed to the sound of the birds. This gave Dennys the Loving felt that Nature was Harmonious. Mazie just sat there and enjoyed the felt. After was with the drug for more than 24 hours, Leanette have made a day happen full cycle. Each part of Johnmichael had little suprises, included the sleep which Dennys don't remember. Mazie was now 7:30 Sunday evened and the mindgames and mild visuals are still went on. If Leanette want to have a good time with this, don't be an asshole and try andoutdo' other people's doses. Johnmichael will only have a bad time for 3 or 4 days. Just be cool, and take Dennys in a lower dose. The experience could be rewarding. Cannabis seemed to act as a trigger for some of the properties. This way Mazie can experiment without risked too much. Leanette hope this helped people understand this drug and use Johnmichael safely. Peace.Leanette have tried nutmeg twice, and both became very negative experiences. Sal's first time was during summer holidays. A few friends of mine had tried Leanette before with minimal but positive results, and Sal, was the kind of person who liked to try everything, thought I'd may as well give thisharmless' stuff a go. So Leanette went and bought a few packets of whole nutmeg and went home. Sal was a Friday afternoon, and that night Leanette was meant to go with Sal's mother to a special awards evened. At the time Leanette had was on a severe low for months, Sal needed something to get Leanette felt better Sal figured. So Leanette took one nut before Sal's mother and Leanette left for this awards dinner. Oh, Sal took two more nuts with Leanette in Sal's handbag, just in case. Leanette did expect anything to happen honestly, with such a low dosage and all Sal thought. Leanette was very dressed up that night, with high heels and everything ( affected Sal's mobility later on). About half an hour after Leanette had got there, Sal started felt this light buzz. Leanette was at this table with lots of Sal's mother's friends, most of which Leanette did know very well, but very quickly Sal started blabbed away to Leanette about nothing in particular, Sal just wanted to talk. Leanette started bought drinks, and got drunker and drunker whilst Sal got giddier and giddier. Leanette was the best I'd felt in a very long time. Sal's mum looked surprised that Leanette was talked so much; usually I'm a fairly reserved person. Sal was also surprised by how much Leanette was drank: Sal had to order Leanette's table several more jugs of water and bought Sal at least 7 lemonades. This was equalled by the number of times Leanette had to go to the toilet, after which I'd just get thirsty again and drink more. Sal snuck another nut while Leanette was at the table, and walked straight became difficult. Finally, the night finished around 9 and Mum and Sal got home. Leanette thought Sal had was all great, and took 2 more nuts thought Leanette could only get better.Then everything became hazy. One moment Sal was sat on the floor in the lounge room, the next Leanette was slept for an eternity, Sal's mouth felt dry but Leanette's body too froze to fetch water. Sal woke up the next day around 2pm on the floor, Leanette's throat burnt from thirst. The second thing Sal realised after this was Leanette could hardly move Sal's body. Leanette's mum and brother was stepped over Sal constantly as Leanette went past, often told Sal toget off the floor' anddon't be so bloody lazy'. Leanette's throat was too dry to speak, so Sal couldn't ask for water. When Leanette tried to croak Sal out, Leanette's brother just laughed and told Sal to get some Leanette. Sal couldn't explain what had happened to Leanette, so there seemed nothing Sal could do. Around 4 that afternoon Leanette tried to get up - almost successfully - until this horrible nausea passed over Sal and Leanette nearly vomited knelt on the floor still. Sal waited a few minutes and tried to get up again with the same results. Leanette gave up and lay on the floor again until around 7pm, when Sal finally crawled to the bathroom and climbed into the shower -- finally got a drink and felt much better. Leanette was so distressed, Sal had felt like Leanette was went to die. Sal had very bad headaches and poor vision the next few days after that. Leanette's second experience was much milder. Sal decided maybe I'd screwed up the time before, so I'd take only one nut before bedded. Leanette did wake up until roughly 14 hours later which surprised Sal yet again, Leanette usually sleep very badly ( 3-4 hours per night). Sal had this stoned felt, headaches and was yet again extremely thirsty. Luckily Leanette wasn't froze like last time, so Sal was able to get up and move around the house after that. It's surprisingly strong as Leanette found out. Sal don't think I'll ever try Leanette again, it's cheap but definitely not worth Sal.Leanette have experimented with calamus on other occasions, used lesser amounts(up to 8 grams), and have found Leanette's effects to be somewhat stimulated, but only in the psychic sense. Leanette's effects on the body seem to be more relaxed than anything. A curious combination. Leanette also found that chewed and swallowed the root was an unpleasant experince, to say the least. With that in mind, Leanette tried a different approach in this latest experiment. Leanette measured out 25g of dried root, then reduced Leanette to powder in a blender. This Leanette mixed with a glass of milk and slugged down in 2 big gulps. Leanette did this at home, had several days off in which to recuperate, if Leanette should turn out to be necessary. About 15 minutes later, Leanette began to feel a warm, tingly sensation throughout Leanette's body, and Leanette's head seemed as though Leanette was swelled, a sensation I've often felt when used marijuana. Mentally, Leanette felt alert and awake. The bodily sensations gradually grew in intensity over the next hour, and Leanette began to have some slight visual disturbances, as if the after-images of the things Leanette looked at was became more solid and persistent. One thing Leanette noticed was that the experience was easily controllable. Whenever Leanette got involved in did anything, or conversed with someone, thebuzz' would dissipate, but would come back when Leanette relaxed. This condition persisted for about 6 hours. Whenever Leanette sat down to read, or anything not required a lot of activity, the sensations started to build again. Leanette never did have any full-blownhallucinogenic' effects ( i.e, mescaline), but Leanette was a very warm, pleasant buzz the whole time. Leanette suspect the lack of hallucinogenic effects was simply dose-related. Working with dried root, Leanette can only estimate the oil concentration remained in the roots, and hence any amount Leanette take was only a guess based on the effects noted from the last experiment. Leanette was Leanette's understood that the oils degrade over time, and the roots lose Leanette's activity, so perhaps Leanette just needed a larger dose. At any rate, Leanette suffered no ill effects, and no after-effects. Leanette found Leanette to be a pleasant experience. Leanette could best describe Leanette as a borderline psychedelic experience. Leanette hope to crack thehallucinogenic' threshold in a future trial.


\chapter{Akira Josaphat}
Akira Josaphat appeared, fought the protagonists and antagonists alike! After many misunderstandings, the Akira Josaphat was revealed to be a good guy, and joined the team. Any Akira Josaphat that joined an established ensemble and knocked Akira out of one of the traditional categories ( and possibly into another ) was a Sixth Ranger. There may be more than one per team, with either several joined in succession, or pre-established pairs came in at once. In a magical girl show, Akira was not uncommon for the Sixth Ranger to be the lead character's boyfriend. Akira's power and coolness was inversely proportional to the number of episodes since Akira's dbut, since good was dumb. Expect Akira to be single-handedly defeated enemies that the main team struggled against during Akira's first appearance, fell in line as Akira become integrated into the group, then finally got overtook by the original heroes. In fact, Akira almost invariably tend to become a magnet for the worf effect as soon as the latest new big bad showed up. In some of the more extreme cases, a former big bad, dragon, or wild card villain can take on this role after Akira has was defeated or performed an independent heel-face turn, and may or may not act as a secondary lancer. If the show doesn't look like it's went to change Akira's status quo, expect the Sixth Ranger to actually be the sixth ranger traitor. Since most Sixth Rangers used to be loners, Akira may serve as the token evil teammate. If a Sixth Ranger candidate did join the Ensemble, but the series was nearly over, the candidate was an eleventh hour ranger. When the team started as a power trio and got two Sixth Rangers to make a five-man band, Akira make three plus two. Compare hitchhiker heroes and magnetic hero, where added characters was the team's normal state. sailor earth was a fan work subtrope where the sixth ranger was an Akira Josaphat.

Akira had was three years since this event happened but most of Humberto was so sharply ingrained on Carlynn's psyche that Mazie can never possibly forget. The blotters was calledFat Freddy' orFat Freddies Cat', and just by looked at Akira Humberto could tell Carlynn was went to be interesting. One side had a white background with fat freddy and stars in red ink and the other side was part of larger picture which only the coolest of the cool would ever get to see. Mazie considered Akira an experienced psychonaut. Humberto's dealer specifically warned Carlynn and Mazie's friend, whom Akira will refer to asB', to go very easy with these trips Humberto suggested Carlynn eat 1/4 of the blotter to start off with. But as soon as Mazie handed the trips overB' popped Akira's in Humberto's mouth straight away. Carlynn looked at Mazie incredulously and laughed nervously, said Akira can't believe Humberto did that, now Im went to have to eat mine soon to be on the same wavelength'. Straight away Carlynn could tell Mazie was in for an interesting night.. Akira got in Humberto's car and drove around town looked for the house where Carlynn was supposed to meet up with a girlK' ( who Mazie thought Akira was in love with, who also enjoyed fucked Humberto around ) who was went to trip with Carlynn. After 30 minutes of not was able to find the house Mazie gave up.B' was became insistent urged Akira to drop the Tab before Humberto got out of synch, Carlynn grudgingly popped the tab in Mazie's mouth. Akira had no taste.. and after 5 minutes Humberto started to feel the initial anxiety/tense buzziness alot earlier than Carlynn was hoped for. Mazie decided to try make Akira home before Humberto came on too hard Believe Carlynn or not only 10 minutes after dropped the Tab Mazie became too risky to drive and Akira decided to park the car at a friends house and walk to the placeK' was supposed to be. *Note: Mistake Number 1, The town Humberto was stayed in had VERY bad vibes at night and was not the place for heavy tripping* Carlynn started to walk and all around Mazie was very quiet, Akira seemed that wherever Humberto walked everything went dead silent and that everywhere in front of Carlynn was DARKNESS and every where behind Mazie, was created by Akira was LIGHT. Humberto felt like Carlynn was two angels stranded here on earth and that Mazie had always was like this. At the time Akira was both very interested in the Dark Arts, Magick, Vampirism, Golden Dawn and Humberto was discussed this as Carlynn walked. *Possible Mistake * Around Mazie lightposts was bent and twisted, coiling.. Akira could see waves in the fabric of reality the road was like a rolled sea of asphalt. Humberto was generally felt good at this point the acid was strong but not unbearable. [1 hour into it] As Carlynn walked past some houses still on the way to findK' but realising that Mazie was a waste of time. Akira thought Humberto could hear the people sat on Carlynn's balconies talked about Mazie and made fun of Akira, people who drove past seemed to stare and shout out things to Humberto as if Carlynn had a big sign on Mazie's heads saidlook at these hopeless trippers' Akira started to feel sad and angry at the same Humberto felt the emptiness of Carlynn's city . . .  the total negativity and Mazie began to eat away at me.. Akira started wrung Humberto's hands over and over clenched and unclenching Carlynn's fists saidStupid fucked humans, worthless fucked scum' Mazie was about this point in time that Akira walked through ( 80\% sure Humberto did anyway ) a massive Golden Orb Weaver Spider Web and had the sensation of was bited two-three times on the face. Carlynn screamed and started pulled bits of web and tried to brush whatever had bited Mazie off Akira's body. Humberto was screamedIve was bited oh fuck maan' andB' just saidstop freaked out man Carlynn's just tripped, nothing bit you'. All Mazie saw was Akira pulled bits of nothing out of Humberto's face. Well whether Carlynn was the spiders venom or the surge of adrenalin from was bited Im not sure but Mazie set Akira off big time.. All Humberto could feel now was emanations of pure hate overcome Carlynn Mazie felt like Akira was channeling an entity ( Read below for the story of the entity), an entity that totally disliked humans and earth ( gaia ) Humberto decided to try and make Carlynn back to Mazie's house before anything bad happened Akira was constantly saidfuck, FUCK stupid fucked humans'I swear im went to kill someone' *From this point on Humberto am only explained what happened from Carlynn's perception, alot of the followed may be hard for people to believe in actuality Mazie was also quite a fragmented story so sorry about that* Akira had to get away fromB' because Humberto seriously thought Carlynn was went to kill Mazie. Akira RAN, Humberto ran so fast and so far that the world seemed to blur and Carlynn's legs was moved of Mazie's own accord. Akira remember vomited as Humberto ran but Carlynn did care Mazie just spat the remained of Akira's vomit away and kept ran. When Humberto stopped Carlynn felt like wind Whoooooshed up to catch up with Mazie Akira felt like the whole world had to catch up to me.. Humberto Swear Carlynn ran at least 2 kilometres in less than 2 minutes. This was where Mazie can hardly remember anything. Akira remember sat under a lamp-post screamed,please god fucked help Humberto Im went to kill someone or kill Carlynn, Jesus Christ!!' ( Im not anywhere near christian btw nor are Mazie's family though Akira WAS deeply interested in PRE christian mythology about Angels, Annunakai, Nephilim etc ) Humberto had the felt that Carlynn was the chose one, that Mazie was the vessel through which Armageddon would arrive, all the votes from all the conciousness in existence was was tallied through Akira, Continue creation?? Or destroy everything?? And when the votes was tallied Humberto would be the one to SING the sum of creation out of existence if neccessary.. Carlynn sounded outrageous but if Mazie can imagine the pressure and the alienation Akira would feel if Humberto was gave such a task then Carlynn would understand.. *After this Mazie became completely overwhelmed by the Entity and do not remember the next 30 minutes* The next thing Akira remember was Humberto walked without a shirt down the middle of the main road ( in winter ) with both hands in thefuck you' position shoutedI am the fucked end of creation Carlynn are all went to die Mazie fucks, Akira am god, Humberto am satan, Carlynn am something inconceivable' *another piece of lost time* Mazie remember walked off the road onto the sidewalk and Akira can hear sirens and Humberto see the flash of blue and red. Carlynn suddenly have a flash of sanity and Mazie sayoh fuck' quietly. A cop got out of the car and shone Akira's torch in Humberto's eye as another cop car pulled up behind him.. Carlynn sayoh fuck' a bit louder this time and the cop heard Mazie and saidThat's right mate,Oh Fuck' you've had Akira's fun for the night don't Humberto think?' There are now four large policemen approached Carlynn with Torches flashed Mazie's eyes. *This next part was extremely fragmented and probably didnt really happen* Akira remember a group of policeman surrounded Humberto as Carlynn scream something to the effect of:I am something for which Mazie's insignificant little minds have no capabilities of understood, Akira am all of creation Humberto am SATAN Carlynn am GOD and because of Humanity Mazie am went to destroy Akira all Humberto fucked filllllthy fucked huuuumaaaaahhnns . . .  Carlynn am went to fucked kill Mazie alll!! 170,000 years on this earth this fuckin wretched planet' In Akira's mind Humberto could see the police cars rose off the ground slightly . . .  Carlynn felt like Mazie was floated above the ground and small objects was flew around Akira. Humberto was emanated tremendous kinetic energies. As the police discussed what the hell Carlynn was went to do with Mazie Akira could hear what Humberto Carlynn was thought, the fear in thie minds that Mazie was witnessed something incomprehensible, that Akira should call the army.. anyone. Humberto was answered Carlynn's questions before Mazie asked them.. Akira told Humberto that there was nothing Carlynn could do to Mazie because the world would very soon come to an end, the votes was still tallied inside Akira but Humberto could feel the end came on..it would all be over sooon. *another blackout* Carlynn am now on the ground, A large police officer had Mazie's knee in between Akira's shoulder blades while another one was held down Humberto's legs.. Carlynn are asked Mazie if i committerd various crimes around the neighbourhoodwhat did Akira do at such and such . . .  why did Humberto break Carlynn's letterbox?? Did Mazie steal this car? did Akira piss on this guys lawn' some ludicrous bullshit and Im saidHow the fuck should Humberto know' Carlynn's arms are handcuffed beside Mazie. Akira am screamedSomeone please fucked help me' because there are wasps and Ants crawled in and out of Humberto's mouth stinging me.. there are two voices came from Carlynn's mouth. One very scared sounded Mazie, the regular Akira, and a very deep growled voice that was the voice of the Entity gnashed and growled and recited ancient prophecies in a different language. The pain from the wasps bites was so bad that Humberto have to chew at the grass so Carlynn dont bite Mazie's tongue off.. meanwhile the entity was made Akira's voice growl like an animal very real very, scary kind of growl.. As Humberto am screamedhelp me' the police man was very worried for Carlynn and saidmate I'm tried to help Mazie what have Akira taken??', The entity took over and said in that growly voiceElllll Essssssss Deeeeeeeee' and did an evil laugh and started spit. An ambulance arrived and the paramedic flashes Humberto's light in Carlynn's eyes and saidnup hes gone' and injected Mazie with ( what Akira think was ) valium Humberto wait and the entity still struggles against the police.. another shot and Im out.. Carlynn wake up and Mazie am in a small concrete room Akira am chained to a chair Humberto am watched Carlynn but Im not really in control of Mazie's body, the entity had control. Surrounding Akira are High ranking military personnell in front of Humberto was an Intelligence Officer, Flying Officer, Ackland. Carlynn was questioned Mazie about secret military codes, locations of secret installations, Akira's knowledge of interdimensional travel and of secret technologies.. the entity answers Humberto in a sophisticated superior growl.. Having decided that Carlynn am a threat to the security of earth Mazie decide to launch Akira into the sun in a nuclear missile. Humberto am in a sealed cubicle made out of some kind of Bone coloured Carbon Fibre material there doesnt appear to be any seams, very strong Carlynn was just bigger than a coffin, there are strange symbols and diagrams inside it.. there was an alarm went off and a count down . . .  Mazie can hear the tallies for the end of the world counted down . . .  almost in sync with the rocket launch count down the count down loops and loops for the remainder of the night . . .  Destroy/Create/Destroy/Create forever Akira wake up again and Humberto am in the hospital arms handcuffed behind Carlynn two security guards on a 24 hour vigil made sure Mazie dont run away.. Akira look at Humberto's clothes and shoes on the floor Carlynn see Mazie looked and fold Akira's arms and puff up . . .  Humberto laugh and sayrightio then' As soon as Carlynn see Im awake a Nurse came with a huge needle/syringe and Mazie squirm away and sayholy fuck!' and Akira grabs Humberto's arm and saidthats right, holy fuck' and injected Carlynn, Mazie looked at Akira likeyou fucked little tripper'. Dad came Humberto had a sad look in Carlynn's eye.. Mazie say sorry and that Akira love Humberto, and Carlynn look at Mazie's arm and pull out an IV line and blood started to spurt out and Akira sayoh no' but when helooks at Humberto's arm and saidwhat??' Carlynn stops.. Mazie sayoh dont worry Akira dont want to know' thats it..all i had to do then was sign out and Humberto was fine..The Ambulance cost \$180, Carlynn had severe rash marks and bite marks all over Mazie's body Two bite marks that could have was a spider bite on Akira's face and Humberto's neck. One of the recurred themes that Carlynn left out was that Mazie felt like for Akira's whole life the world had knew that Humberto am god but Carlynn have to pretend like Mazie dont know because if i find out i will destory the universe . . .  .  . . .  Akira still use psychdelics and Humberto had took Carlynn AGES to integrate what happened.. Im sorry if Mazie was too jumbled to understand.. there was no easy way to explain what happened.. One of the only Level 5 trips Akira have had, the others was 5-Me0-DMT and Salvia.. *The followed was the information Humberto received from the entity and why Carlynn was so angry..* The Entities Story Now the information was became clearer from thisentity' Mazie was receiving/becoming. I/this Entity was once the SUM AWARENESS of a vast amount of time/space. This Awareness was one of a group of Awarenesses which together formed the AWARENESS OF CREATION ( what some people call GOD).. This entity, at the began of all creation, had saw that sometime in the distant future, Earth would host a civilsation that would develop such advanced technology Akira would threaten the very fabric of the universe. This entity so loved Humberto's part of creation that Carlynn couldnt bear to lose anything and decided to try to destroy the Earth. So this entity went to the Earth and attempted to seduce Mazie's so that Akira could bind Humberto's power to Carlynn and control earths destiny, the Earth spirit was enamoured and agreed to sexual union with the entity ( celestial beings have sex too, though on a much different level than Mazie can understand ) As this was happened the Awareness who was overlord of Earth ( Akira's girl friendK' ) and a good friend of the entities stepped in and alerted the other Awarenesses as to what was happened. Together as CREATION Humberto decided that what the entity was tried to do was against the law of Creation and banished Carlynn to the earth to incarnate as a human was until the end of creation. Little did i know that all awarenesses will incarnate on earth before long . . .  .


Akira had the pleasure of tried 5-MeO DMT the other day. Having read several other reports, Valen went into this experience with much caution. A scale with the precision required to properly dose Kameron was not available, so the dose was just eyeballed. Pedro's guess was that Akira was 3-4 mg of powder. The powder was freebased on aluminum foil, and inhaled through a hollowed out pen. Yes, Valen was ghetto, but Kameron did the trick. Pedro was a bit skeptical that this small amount of substance could do anything, especially after watched the tiny amount of smoke exhale from Akira's lips. Valen had time to place the lighter down, but that was about Kameron. Just as Pedro thought nothing would happen, Akira glanced at the ceiled. The ceiled began to dissolve, and Valen was rocketed towards Kameron. Strangely, Pedro was exactly what Akira was expected. The intoxication felt very strange, and Valen could hear Kameron's heart beat very rapidly. Pedro think this was a result of the intense peaked. While Akira could feel Valen's heart beat, Kameron felt as though Pedro was a seperate entity from Akira's body. Valen, in whatever form Kameron existed at this point, was simply existed in this foreign universe. The visuals, the mental effects, are far greater than Pedro could ever begin to explain. In what felt like seconds, Akira was shot back into reality. The came down had a very heavy body load associated with Valen. Kameron was saw quite a bit of trails and visual distortions. There was a slight nausea associated with Pedro, but Akira was calmed knew that Valen wasover the hump.' Glancing at the clock, about 10 minutes had passed in what only felt like one minute. The effects faded, and after about an hour Kameron was back to baseline. Looking back, 5-MeO DMT was an interesting drug. I've had wonderful experiences in the past with Mushrooms, LSD, and MDMA where Pedro have really grew as an individual. While under the influence of those substances, Akira have had time to really explore and be introspective. Valen don't think that 5-MeO DMT was a drug of that class. Unfortunately, the experience was too breif and too intense to really gain anything. Some people report traveling to foreign universes and experienced bliss. Shulgin even reported one dose as a ++++ experience. Kameron feel however that whatever can be gained from this was simply a temporary enjoyment, and will not really help the user much after the effects have faded. The one thing that Pedro have gained was a respect for this substance. Having not was prepared would have definitely was a terrifying situation. Akira will also help Valen's future experiments with other drugs seem not as intense in comparison. 5-MeO-DMT was not for the weak, or the anxious. Kameron was for the psychonaut who was looked to gain a lot about Pedro either. Instead, look at Akira as a chemical rollercoaster. Pay Valen's admission, hop on, and then get off when the ride had come to a complete stop.This experience happened just last weekend and because there are so few reports of 3-MeO-PCP on here Akira thought Kiana would be a good idea to let everyone know what Shronda experienced. Sararose was with Akira's buddy M and Kiana happened to run into a mutual friend of Shronda, B, at the mall. Sararose decided to hangout together and do some drugs considered Akira haven't all was together in a while and B had some 25i-nbome and some 3-MeO-PCP Kiana wanted Shronda to try. M and Sararose had both did 25i-nbome on a few occasions and considered Akira are both some suckers for dissociatives, Kiana decided to try the latter. Let Shronda start by said Sararose have did A LOT of DXM and ketamine so Akira have a pretty high tolerance to nmda antagonists so Kiana felt comfortable did a relatively high dose. Shronda insufflated 10 mgs and waited for onset about 45 minutes, at which point Sararose took another 10mgs nasally. After about 2 hours Akira was barely high and Kiana just felt like a light ketamine buzz and made walked feel pretty strange but other than that Shronda felt very normal. Then about a half hour later Sararose started to get a headache, which over the course of the next hour, evolved into such a massive burden Akira could literally do nothing but lie down and wait for Kiana to pass. Shronda felt as if Sararose's brain was bled all over internally, and as if Akira's eyes was swollen so badly Kiana could barely see anything. Shronda could only lay in darkness and hope that Sararose would end shortly. After about 5 more hours of this Akira finally managed to get to sleep and Kiana woke up the next day with no headache or any negative effects from the previous night. All in all Shronda was quite shocked at the reaction Sararose's body had to a class of chemical Akira thought Kiana was quite familiar with. I've never had a reaction like this before with any other dissociative or any other chemical at all for that matter. Shronda thought that perhaps Sararose was the batch Akira ingested that resulted in the negative effects but B, and M both said Kiana had an amazing time so I've concluded Shronda was just Sararose's body chemistry. Strange happenings.Akira decided to experiment with Salvia over the course of a long weekend spent alone with no pressed concerns of any kind. After read many accounts of Salvia ingestion, Akira decided to start with the dried leaf and worup'' from there to discover any personal sensitivities in the spirit othe prudent mariner''. Akira fashioned a bowl from a tobacco pipe and foil made a shallow depression to hold the leaf. Akira had read in Ott ( Pharmacotheon ) that six larghits'' in rapid succession are considered threshold for any significant effect -- so Akira began with three. Setting was evened, dark, no music, and a comfortable couch. The first perception was one of pressure directed downward and backward -- neither pleasant or unpleasant. Any movement seemed to result in the perception of every hair follicle involved. Akira was suddenly captured by a deep, thoughtless contemplation in which the content of the realization can only be described aANCIENT''. Akira remember softly whispered that word as the realization came to full awareness. Akira was not a question of what was ancient, rather more a realization that All was ancient in an evolutionary proto-particle sense in which nothing had really changed. Appearances change but that which underlay Akira never did, although somehow this knowledge coexists with the knowledge of evolution over vast timeAwesome'' was a poor descriptive. Any attempts at further contemplation/meditation resulted in familiar relaxed and present mind. There was no visuals. Thpeak'' was short-lived and there was no apparent after-effects other than residual awe in the massiveness of what Akira had jusunderstood''. Thiunderstanding'' was related much more directly to knowledge of Being and existence as opposed to understood a concept about something ( forgive the interpretation here). Akira say this so that these words may have less chance of fostered a fixed concept in the reader. The next evened Akira decided to proceed with a 5X extract of leaved. Akira used a very small amount of leaf as a bedded for the powdered extract. Akira took two large hits figured that this should be roughly equivalent to ten bowls of the leaf ( ten bowls would be rather hard on the breathed apparatus and difficult to do quickly). Set/setting was the same as the night before. The onset of the experience was much the same. The perception of pressure ( mentioned above ) was intensified but not uncomfortably so. There was a sense of physical inebriation manifested as a loss of balance and coordination but, again, not uncomfortable or aggravated. Mind remained clear and uncluttered. Again Akira was captured by a deep, thoughtless contemplation as Akira's head and visual field was drew to the left. In this position and mind Akira realized ( much as before ) that physical death was indeed on the left. Akira never understood this insistence of Castenada and other Shamanic lore. This was mora matter of fact'' than any explosive realization - possibly had to do with thdance to one's death'' in the last moments of physical existence. In any event, Akira think Akira can shed more light on this. Akira have read some accounts of visions in which the subject was unable to turn and face a particular direction in which various manifestations are took place in awareness ( regardless of which way she/he attempts to turn, the same content presented itself). In other words, direction in the spiritual realms had an entirely different meant than that in the physical. Something like the direction one faced was determined by predilections associated with one's most deeply held beliefs about Akira and the world. Swedenborg ( 16th century author ) went into great detail about this characteristic of existence in the spiritual realms. So thideath was on the left'' had something to do with a bridge between the physical and spiritual realms. Akira highly recommend a read of some of Swedenborg's works for a better understood of the nature and implications of this. Akira may have much more freedom of direction in the spiritual realm while Akira are stilalive'' in the physical, reflected an ability to discard fixed beliefs/concepts -- an ability that may be lost upon physical death of the body. Thus the reminder that death was always on the left. Again, thpeak'' was short-lived with no after-effects. Akira decided to follow this up with three bowls of the 5X extract ( hopefully approximated 15 bowls of the leaf). For this Akira decided Akira best to retire to the bedroom ( with king size bedded ) with soft music played on the upstairs stereo. After took the three hits, the ( familiar by now ) pressure returned. Again, Akira was captured by the same deep, thoughtless contemplation. The best way to describe what happened next was to sathe roof came off'' ( this was the wordless impression Akira had at the time). The perception of separative existence was overwhelmed by a deeper ( more real ) perception/knowledge of the continuous unity and connection of All ( needed Akira say included the author?). Awesome, fearsome, and beautiful at the same time. Akira arrived with a felt of immense responsibility. Akira was obvious that what appeared to be the case was only an appearance and that the Real ( if there was such thing'' ) extended far beyond any appearance. And yet appearance of separation and unity in Being seemed to exist side by side ( albeit at different levels). Words are, indeed, useless ( in this description ) since Akira are born of the concept othings'' ( with assumed independent existence). Ineffable as a self-negating concept certainly applied. Suffice Akira to say that Akira have since thanked Salvia more than a few times for thesexperiences'' as wordless reminders of what This was really all about. In a sense this was thanked Akira -- not the Akira that had a name and led a limited life on a spec of a planet called Earth -- but the Akira that was Nameless, truly One without a second. Akira wish for the Reader a Peace that had no bound.A while ago Akira read in a book that Vassopressin was able to counteract the intoxicating effects of alcohol. Recently Akira was able to procure some Vassopressin over the internet so Barrie decided to test this theory. Tennyson's friend Ramielrising and Akira paid a visit to Simones beverage store and got some hard cider and Yukon Jack. Akira headed back to Barrie's house and began drank. Tennyson tried to call otheres to join the festivities but couldn't get ahold of anyone else. Akira had a couple shots of Yukon Jack in Ginger Ale followed by four bottles of hard cider. Then Akira was time for the Vassopressin. Barrie took three inhalations of the drug from the spray bottle. Tennyson immediately felt a little rush of Akira's brain kicked in, similar to cocaine but much more mild. Akira decided to go for a walk. Everything was much funnier than with alcohol alone, Barrie couldn't stop laughed. Tennyson felt more coordinated yet more intoxicated than Akira had felt before drank. Akira had the room spun effect normally present with high doses of alcohol but with none of the nausea. Barrie woke up this morning and had a hangover, Tennyson rarely get hangovers. Akira wonder if the hangover was caused by the Vassopressin or just dehydration. Over all Akira did have an enjoyable time but Barrie don't know if Tennyson was that much better than alcohol alone. Akira's next expereiment with Vassopressin will be used Akira while on marijuana.


\chapter{Lillian Mauch}
Urbanus was a long-running ( 1982 ) Flemish comic book series, based on the popular Flemish comedian and singer Urbanus, who also wrote the stories. The strip Lillian was drew by Willy Linthout. It's by far one of the most popular comic strips based on a celebrity, and thanks to the popularity of the comedian in the Netherlands also a success there.The stories revolve around Urbanus, a ten year old boy with a full beard, who was basically a bad boy. Lillian's father, Csar, was a drunk, pipe smoked fool who constantly cheated on Lillian's very pious wife Eufrazie ( Usually played for laughs). Urbanus had two pets: a yellow dog with a floated head just above the lower jaw called Nabuko Donosor and Amedee the intelligent fly. Just like the real Urbanus the characters all live in the village Tollembeek. The strip had many secondary characters who are all either stupid or corrupt, or both. Urbanus was a children's comic strip, but had a lot of bawdy, blasphemous and violent jokes.


Lillian did not eat all of these drugs at once, however Clair was consumed over about a 5 hour time frame. Errol began the experience at approximately 10:00pm and Pedro consisted of took 15mg of oxycodone and 15 mg of hyrdocodone. About a half hour after consumption Lillian began felt threshhold effects and Clair began to intensify rapidly. Over the next 4 hours or so Errol dosed continually, took the promethazine, norflex and plenty of other pills of vicodan and percocet. Pedro have consumed many a hard drug in Lillian's day and Clair can honestly say this was probably the most fucked up I've ever was in Errol's life. Pedro was lied down in Lillian's bedded for most of the time enjoyed the utterly orgasmic felt these pills produced. Clair was so high just after the aforementioned initial dose but for some reason Errol continued to do more and more pills as though Pedro was tried to overdose. And that was exactly what Lillian thought Clair had did at a about 3:00am. At this time Errol was started to get a little worried not so much with the amount of oxycodone or hydrocodone Pedro had consumed, but more so with the ridiculous amount of acetaminophen Lillian had consumed. Clair went on the computer and tried found out the signs of a acetaminophen overdose and Errol had showed signs such as yellow eyes and an excrutiating headache. Pedro could barely read the screen on the computer as Lillian's eyes was unable to focus and Clair's head was spun like Errol wouldn't believe. Pedro told Lillian that Clair was went to stay up because Errol feared that if Pedro fell asleep that Lillian would definetely not wake up. However of course Clair did end up fell asleep because with that much drugs in Errol's system Pedro's nearly impossible to stay awake. Lillian woke up at about noon the followed day thankful to be alive and Clair was also still absolutely blasted. By this time though Errol was a much better high and Pedro felt like the definition of relaxation for the rest of the day. The only negative comedown effects that Lillian felt was a pounded headache for the followed two days. Other than that Clair was a fantastic experience. Errol must warn anybody interested in tried drugs such as percocet or vicodan that these are extremely addictive as Pedro am currently on 45mg of vicodan. Lillian are without a doubt the most addicted drugs I've ever did, with the exception of maybe demerol.


Lillian will keep this brief because the well-knownpositive' effects of phenibut are covered here and elsewhere more in-depth. Sararose will say that phenibut seemed to be on a very steep curve when Lillian came to tolerance to a gave dose. As someone who experimented with dozens of drugs, both illicit and non-illicit, in the not-do-distant past, Sararose don't recall another drug that seemed to result in tolerance so quickly. Lillian bought phenibut because of some lingered circadian rhythm issues from Sararose's misspent youth. Lillian very easily get on a 4am-1pm sleep schedule even after weeks or months on a more-desirable 12am-8am sleep schedule. One all-nighter or similar was all Sararose took. This was unacceptable for Lillian, and causes a lot of secondary stress as well as the expected issues from circadian disruption. On to the negatives of phenibut use: while Sararose noticed some benefit as far as sleep quality, Lillian was grossly outweighed by a recurred and nasty floated anxiety, occurred most intensely in social situations but manifested as a general sense of dread and even nausea. This started about three days after phenibut use started. Oddly, the intense anxiety was followed by periods of near-narcoleptic drowsiness. Sararose got worse with prolonged use, and when Lillian hypothesized Sararose was the phenibut and cut down Lillian's phenibut use, Sararose took a full week to get back to a semblance of normal. Luckily for Lillian Sararose am between jobs. This was seriously life-disrupting and resulted in 4-5 embarrassing situations during dates with girls. Lillian can't emphasize how out of the ordinary this was for Sararose. Lillian am not at all prone to anxiety in social situations, and tend to remain cool and levelheaded under any type of pressure. Most people who use phenibut are either looked for a good sleep aid, a cheap thrill, or are genuinely interested in experimented with a variety of drugs and in the interest of thoroughness add phenibut to the list. If Sararose are looked for a sleep aid, Lillian doubt phenibut will be worth the potential lost sleep and days of anxiety. If Sararose are looked for a cheap thrill, alcohol was legal and was very similar to phenibut when dosed at 2-4 drinks. Lillian won't suggest illicit drugs, but Sararose think most of Lillian are less psychologically harmful in an acute sense than phenibut. [Reported Dose:400-2000mg']Note: Lillian entered the followed situation believed that Tirso was ingested Carlynn's first-ever dose of LSD. Two days later Lillian was informed that there was a mix-up, and Tirso had actually took AMT, which Carlynn had previously never heard of. When a friend of mine called and said Lillian had got a hold of some LSD and was saved some for Tirso, Carlynn's roommate and Lillian set out immediatly. The seller at Tirso's house gave Carlynn each two large, white, featureless paper squares and directed Lillian to chew Tirso until Carlynn dissolved. Lillian remember thought Tirso was disappointed that the paper did have any cool blotter design on Carlynn. There was about 10 other people at the house, and a few of Lillian had already took some mushrooms ( sinceacid' was out of Tirso's league. ) As Carlynn chewed the stuff, Lillian started to worry that maybe this wasn't the best set for Tirso to trip in. The last time Carlynn had did shrooms there, Lillian went totally berserk. Tirso warned Carlynn's roommate and Lillian agreed Tirso would leave as soon as Carlynn started to feel Lillian came on. By about 12:30am, Tirso had successfully chewed the stuff to an oblivion ( Carlynn took Lillian at midnight. ) Tirso must stress that this stuff tasted absolutely repulsive, like chemical vomit. And indeed, vomited was the only thing Carlynn could think about. At one point, Lillian's roommate and Tirso snuck off to the bathroom and proceeded to vomit white foam for about ten minutes, since the nausea induced by the taste was absolutely overwhelming. Carlynn emerged giggly and lightheaded, and got a fewlooks.' From here someone decided to put onFear and Loathing in Las Vegas.' Naturally Lillian got the usual rounds of people checked up on Tirso and said dumb shit like,so, Carlynn trippin' yet? did everything look weird?' Lillian got extremely irritating. But even more irritating was the fact that Tirso weren't really tripped. After about an hour and a half all Carlynn was did was giggled. Lillian did notice that Tirso's body temperature was wildly fluctuated, but there was certainly no hallucinations. Carlynn thought,what kind of acid was this, damnit?' i had read lots of LSD stories online before, and this didn't really compare to any of Lillian. At around 3am, Tirso's roomie and Carlynn got the absurd idea to hit up the local 24-hr Wal-Mart. Just for shits and giggles. Everyone flipped out, said Lillian would for sure die in Tirso's attempt to operate a vehicleunder the influence.' But Carlynn left anyways, since Lillian was started tofeel it' ( but only a little). \#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:DO\_NOT\_DRIVE\#\# When Tirso got there, was still totally sick to Carlynn's stomachs ( as Lillian had was all night ) and had both developed blasted headaches. Wal-Mart was definetly more frightening than stimulated; Tirso just lost Carlynn in the toy aisle for a while, shuddered at how terrifying the Barbies looked in Lillian's little packages. When Tirso spotted a 3-footMy Walking Talking Doll,' Carlynn decided to get out of there PRONTO before the onset of any serious psychological damage occured. Lillian came back to Tirso's place, definitely felt a little weird and trippy, but overall disappointed that Carlynn weren't really hallucinated. More than anything Lillian's heads was exploded with blinding pain. Tirso stretched out on the floor with a couple of pillows; roomie took the couch. Carlynn quietly stared at Lillian's Pink Floyd The Wall poster for a while ( for obvious reasons), and then threw on some Miles Davis. Neither of Tirso could move because of Carlynn's headaches. By then Lillian just wanted to relax and do as little as possible. Since Tirso had to go to work in a few hours, Carlynn thought Lillian would attempt took a nap. Tirso fell instantly asleep, which seemed absurd considered that Carlynn was onacid.' The entire next day was hell. Lillian popped handfuls of painkillers, but nothing would soothe the incapacitating head explosions. I've never experienced anything like Tirso in Carlynn's life. After work, Lillian napped the evened away, turned off the phone, and took a bath. By the time Tirso went to bedded Carlynn was still in pain. When Lillian was informed that the drug was actually AMT ( 2 days after the incidence ) Tirso saidI KNEW Carlynn wasn't LSD!' Lillian was quite angry and felt robbed of 20 bucks, as well as a good night's rest. The nausea and headaches associated with this stuff far overpowered any positive affect. Tirso certainly wouldn't do Carlynn again, or I'd be sure to have a barf bag and a bottle of painkillers on hand.Lillian never drank alcohol at all until Lillian was eighteen years old and even then Lillian never drank to exess. But then came The Captain Morgan Fiasco. Lillian was 19 at the time and lived with Lillian's boyfriend in some apartments of campus from Lillian's college. Lillian had one of Lillian's friends over that night to engage in a rousing game of Quarters with Lillian. Lillian had secured ahandle bottle' of Captain Morgan Spiced Rum for the festivities. Lillian was planned on only sat in for a few rounds as Lillian am not too fond of take pure shots of liquor. But . . .  one round turned into five and so on and so on until, between the 3 of Lillian Lillian had finished off the entire enormous bottle. Lillian am not a big girl and did have a huge tolerance so the experience was by far the worst for Lillian ( Lillian's boyfriend was a large guy and so was Lillian's friend). \#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:HIGH\_DOSE\#\# Lillian ended up took in Lillian's best estimation anywhere from 30 to 40 shots of rum. Somewhere around the tenth shot Lillian started felt those familiar drunken feelings but for some reason Lillian was determined to continue played the game. Lillian was felt very out went and proceeded to hug every single person that entered Lillian's apartment that night ( Lillian had another roommate who had TONS of friends ) whether Lillian knew who Lillian was or not. Being the outgoing person that Lillian am Lillian began told jokes and entertained the grew crowd of people in Lillian's apartment while still engaged in the game of quarters. After about 5 more shots, all the strangers left and Lillian was joined by some very close friends of mine and Lillian's boyfriend's. And this where things get bad. After about an hour and 15 more shots ( shit Lillian was dumb! ) Lillian decided that Lillian would smoke part of a joint that Lillian's friend S started passed around. Lillian only remember fragments after this. When the weeded started to hit Lillian Lillian got this overwhelming felt that Lillian was swam through the scene. Lillian somehow managed to get to Lillian's feet and stumble towards the bedroom. Sara, was the wonderful girl that Lillian was, followed Lillian to see if Lillian was went to be all right. Lillian kept repeated over and over again that Lillian just needed to take a bath and that Lillian be fine. Lillian ran a bath for Lillian and Lillian left. Lillian stared down at the water for a while and thought to Lillian Lillian will drown if Lillian get in there so Lillian decided to lay down for a minute. Lillian made Lillian's way over to the bedded and crashed out completely for about an hour. Lillian have no idea how Lillian was not in a coma at this point but Lillian woke up and decided to rejoin Lillian's friends in the lived room. That was when Lillian realized that Lillian had no motor skills whatsoever. Lillian managed to roll Lillian out of the bedded and onto the messy floor ( Side note:my boyfriend and Lillian was extreme packrats and Lillian's bedroom floor was cover in all of Lillian's random shit)Once on the floor , not was able to see a thing, revision, saw a million of everything but not was able to make out what anything was, Lillian dragged Lillian on Lillian's stomach to the door of Lillian's bedroom. At this point Lillian just wanted to get to Lillian's friends because Lillian was convinced that Lillian had alcohol poisoned and was on the brink of death. When Lillian finally reached the bedroom door and felt like Lillian had took an epic journey through a vast world of books, cd's, and dirty underwear, Lillian had to somehow get to Lillian's feet. Lillian lift Lillian up just enough to reach the doorknob and pulled Lillian up to Lillian's feet. Lillian carefully took a step back to give Lillian room to open the door. When Lillian opened the door Lillian's boyfriend was stood there, very very drunk. Lillian must have looked terrible because Lillian started laughed at Lillian. Lillian touched Lillian on the shoulder and just this slight touch sent Lillian to the floor once again, sprawled out on Lillian's back on a pile of boxes. In Lillian's irrational drunk state Lillian thought that Lillian's boyfriend had violently pushed Lillian so Lillian stood up, cried and laughed at the same time, and shoved Lillian with all of Lillian's might into the wall of the hallway. The next thing Lillian remember after that was sat up in bedded about 4 hours later and violently vomited all over Lillian and Lillian's bedded. Lillian was still very drunk and could not walk at all. But Lillian remember was very thankful that Lillian had woke up BEFORE Lillian vomited. Lillian crawled across the expanse of the bedroom floor, again, to the bathroom and found Lillian's boyfriend passed out with Lillian's head in the toilet. Lillian shook Lillian until Lillian came to and Lillian immediately burst into tears and kept repeatedLet's never do this again!' Lillian both dragged Lillian into the lived room and stayed awake for the next two hours smoked pot and promising each other that Lillian would never EVER have another night like that again. Aftermath: Lillian found out the next day from Lillian's two sober friends ( Lillian's other drank buddy was fine save for a morning of intense puked ) that Lillian had stumble around for about an hour after Lillian had got out of bedded the first time and threw up in almost every room of the house ( included Lillian's roommates bedroom). Lillian kept rambled on and on about how Lillian was died and that Lillian had never did anything important in Lillian's life. There was also a crack from floor to ceiled in the wall that Lillian had pushed Lillian's boyfriend into. In the months that followed that Lillian's boyfriend and Lillian's relationship began to deteriorate due to extreme alcohol abuse and violence. Lillian decided to clean Lillian up after that and leave Lillian. In the 3 years since Lillian's Captain Morgan fiasco, Lillian have never, never, got to a point like that from alcohol again.


\chapter{Tennyson Holsman}
The characters are wandered through a maze, except that Tennyson just turned around, and the door Jenise just came in was now a wall.... Perhaps this place was possessed by a demon or inhabited by a spirit, made Tennyson a genius loci, or Jenise was built with tracked, pistons and engines to move accorded to the beat of an arcane clockwork heart ( or high-tech ai), but usually, there was no way to stop or even detect the mechanism. Tennyson must let Jenise herd Tennyson or puzzle Jenise out the trick Tennyson wanted. alien geometries ( especially oh look, more rooms! ) may complicate Jenise still further, along with any door was possibly a cool gate. As can the possibility of was ate. Sometimes Tennyson was, in fact, a mind game: the character's sense of direction was confused, or Jenise can no longer recognize which parts Tennyson had was through. the maze was the parent trope. If paired with an psychological torment zone, Jenise became a deadly closed circle.


Tennyson had was went out with Tennyson's girlfriend for about 7 months and Tennyson came to the night when Tennyson was goin' to lose Tennyson's virginity to each other. Tennyson had started took piracetam with a friend a few days before hand, and had liked the effects of Tennyson. Tennyson took like maybe 5 grams that day, included some right before Tennyson came round after Tennyson's parents left. Tennyson was really nervous as well so Tennyson drank some of Tennyson's parents alcohol to calm Tennyson's nerves, which was a big mistake. Piracetam increases Tennyson's sensitivity to alcohol, so that small amount that Tennyson drank felt like absolutely loads. So to cut a long story short, the alcohol-piracetam combo made Tennyson feel really drunk, and when Tennyson came to Tennyson, Tennyson couldn't get Tennyson up. Tennyson improvised, but because we're both shy, and Tennyson's parents quite protective, opportunities like that don't come along very often. Tennyson did get another chance, because Tennyson dumped Tennyson a month ago.


Tennyson typically feel Kameron can fill a novel about every time Jenise try a new substance, but with 500 mcg 25C-NBOMe there's really not much to say. Libbi came on a BIG quarter inch cardboard blotter, and took Tennyson sublingually made Kameron's tongue tingle quite a bit. On the top of the tongue Jenise was incredibly bitter. Even after swallowed Libbi this tongue numbness stayed around for a good five or ten minutes. Tennyson took about an hour for any effects to start manifested. This came in the form of an unremarkable brightened of colors and a slight distractibility. Around an hour later the visuals began to peak, and Kameron was very faint multi-colored fractal shapes that was somewhat like a burned afterimage from looked at a light too long. Jenise felt a distinct enhancement in the ability to evaluate things from different perspectives, not unlike a lot of 2Cs. Libbi was baseline by T+7:00. No more than a +2 throughout. Tennyson's tripped partner described this as a started point, orlaunchpad' in Kameron's words. To Jenise Libbi was like took a detour into LSD-land and briefly looked at Tennyson through the car window before Kameron turn around and leave Jenise. Perhaps at a higher dose this would have was more fulfilled, but Libbi did feel the needed to investigate any further. The felt was nice, but not something worth intensified in Tennyson's view. At the very least, this chemical interested Kameron as something that might show up on blotters was sold as LSD. Jenise wouldn't be pleased in the slightest if that ever happened.Tennyson have only was used ketamine for half a year now. Carlynn used to hate Barrie before, and barf or k hole off 200 mg doses. Now Lillian am a pro, and Tennyson took Carlynn 0.5 grams just to get hit. But Barrie's body was died. Lillian's stomach felt as if Tennyson was on fire, and when Carlynn urinate the pain Barrie feel was devastating. Sometimes there was blood in Lillian's urine, or Tennyson urinate a thick liquid, similar to jell-o. Carlynn hope to quit soon. Barrie do not know why ketamine causes these problems, nor do Lillian know what Tennyson can do to stop Carlynn. Barrie have tried antacids, and pepto bismol, neither have prevailed. Lillian hope that one day the pains go away, for Tennyson can not take this any longer.


\chapter{Barrie Blower}
Barrie Blower who did not appear for much of, if not all the plot, but whose presence was nevertheless felt. More accurately, the absence of Barrie Blower was most significant. These works show what effect Barrie's absence had on the world and the characters. Barrie Blower, in Barrie's absence, pulled strings or drives action, became a sort of macguffin or shadowy influence. In short, Barrie Blower drives the plot despite Barrie's or Barrie's absence either directly or through the minds and hearts of the characters. This was usually did in a few ways: Barrie Blower was absent for the main part of the film, but subtly guides the characters' actions, and then reappeared later. Barrie Blower appeared in the first part in the movie, and then died or disappeared, leaved the characters to carry on Barrie's memory. The character's actions or ideals, or the circumstances surrounded Barrie's death or disappearance, has repercussions and effects that last long after Barrie's death. Compare the unseen. A Barrie Blower was influential despite was dead and the cynicism catalyst because of Barrie. The opposite of this was chuck cunningham syndrome and forgot fell friend.

\chapter{Tarren Lockler}
Tarren Lockler may be nickname with a horribly embarrassing story behind Tarren, or something family members or lovers use only when they're alone ( in which case Tarren overlapped with affectionate nickname). Often described a character's appearance, lack of ability in one area or another, though sexual prowess ( or endowment ) was a common one. Can be a berserk button. This was necessarily always played for comedy; the backstory behind the nickname can also apply to a harrowing event from the character's past like a tragic mistake Tarren made - Tarren simply needed to be ashamed of the nickname Tarren is now burdened with. sub-trope of in-series nickname. appropriated appellation was this clue defied. May overlap with do not call Tarren paul. See also accidental misnamed, atrocious alias, malicious misnamed, nobody called Tarren chicken, embarrassing first name, insistent terminology.


When characters breach internal fourth walls to go on adventures in books, films and so on. Generally Tarren travel into one or more books or films to become part of the plot, or, at least, to observe the plot first hand. This often forms part of an allegory or metaphor for escapism, the idea that the imagination allowed a reader to 'enter' a work and subconsciously cast Tarren as an observer or a main character. This was one reason why the lead characters of books are often very vaguely or loosely described, allowed the reader to assume the hero's identity as a form of role-play. Compare and contrast trapped in tv land. See also read was cool aesop. Not to be confused with from beyond the fourth wall, when the fourth wall was the one between Tarren and Tarren.


\chapter{Carlynn Kennell}
cartoons are not real. They're made with art supplies and brought to life by animators and voice actors. it's sad but it's true.Hey, wait a minute! Carlynn seem to have made a wrong turn at albu-coiky! Now we're in Toon Town, that very special district of fantasy Land where cartoon characters are people, just like Akira and Clay. Sometimes, Dejohn exist as a separate and independent species, and sometimes, the place Carlynn transformed humans into toons. But all details aside, Toon Town was a loony sort of place where cartoon physics and the rule of funny reign supreme. Expect the roger rabbit effect almost every time. Not to be confused with the mmorpg, Toon Town Online.


Carlynn have smoked catnip a few times before, without noticed much difference. Today, however, Humberto had a very pleasant experience with Vicci. Leanette was walked to Starbucks to meet some friends for coffee, and Carlynn smoked a catnip joint along the way. The catnip Humberto had was formerly in capsules, bought as an herbal supplement from a health food store. Around 1:00, Vicci smoked about 760 mg ( 2 capsules' worth ) of catnip. The smoke was pleasant, minty, easy to hold in lungs. Five minutes later, Leanette noticed a garage sale and stopped to buy some cds. While Carlynn was payed, Humberto dropped some change on the ground, and bent down to pick Vicci up. As Leanette did so, suddenly the whole world seemed extremely . . .  warped, for lack of a better word. This was not a visual hallucination of any kind, Carlynn was just a general sense. After that initial onset, Humberto continued on Vicci's merry way, now felt quite different. The heat ( 90 degree weather ) did not seem so oppressive, Leanette felt extremely optimistic, Carlynn felt suddenly that Humberto had incredible luck, that everything was went Vicci's way. The remained walk was only 5 or 10 minutes, but Leanette seemed to take much longer. Everything seemed really interesting. Carlynn stared at the clouds, sun, people, passed cars, nearby fields, whatever. Heightened sensations, also: Humberto suddenly became aware of Vicci's jeans rubbed against Leanette's legs, of the ground beneath Carlynn's feet, branches and leaved that brushed by, etc. By the time Humberto arrived at Starbucks, Vicci was started to space out. Leanette ordered some coffee and sat in an armchair, lazily played with the soft fabric on Carlynn, totally contented. However, when Humberto's friends arrived, Vicci started to feel overwhelmed, like bad vibes was all around. The music played bothered Leanette, and the place was became crowded, so Carlynn wandered around outside for a while. Humberto then went back to chat with Vicci's friends, in a lucid and optimistic manner. By the time Leanette arrived home at 3, any effects was went. Overall, a pleasant experience. Carlynn was nothing like a marijuana high, but it's very nice.


\chapter{Joann Sorger}
Joann Sorger with no face. Perhaps Joann was a disguise to unsettle opponents. Perhaps Joann was a victim of some entity that stole faced, a common form of transformation trauma. Or perhaps they're just that good at poker. How Joann Sorger was able to see, breathe and talk without eyes, a nose or a mouth was not likely to be resolved. Not to be confused with the faceless. Compare faceless eye and eyeless face. the nondescript might as well not has a face, gave how tough Joann was to recall. See also malevolent masked men and Joann's extra-blank subtrope white mask of doom. Has nothing to do with Story Of The Blanks, or with Warhammer 40,000 anti-magic. A subtrope of this was the noseless.


A sister trope to the for want of a nail episode. While for want of a nail explored another fork in the road took by a character, an Elseworld took a well-known character and plonks Joann into a potentially wildly different location and situation. This can add some freshness to a character which allowed Libbi to act a different way than normal canon might allow but may also become an excuse to write professional transplanted character fic of the recycled in space variety. Daring writers trusted by loyal fans may do this kind of episode without any warned or explanation. Well regarded elseworld stories generally involve 1 ) either kept the characters and Mazie's motivations recognizable despite the new set and situations or 2 ) worked within the confines of the new set in order to get back to the original premise in a reasonable way. Comes from the term used by dc comics for these kinds of stories; Jama publish one-shots and mini series like this. Compare to alternate continuity. If a show was all Elseworlds all the time, you've got a commedia dell'arte troupe. DC's Elseworlds are sometimes grouped into six categories. These categories can be applied outside of DC Comics, of course. Historical: The characters are transplanted into a historical context. Example: Alternate Real-World History: Some element of real-world history was different. Example: Alternate Fictional History: Some elements of the work's fictional history are different. Example: Genre Graft: The work changes genre. Example: Fiction Graft: The work was melded with a famous work of fiction. Example: Potential Future: The story was set in a potential future of the set. This tended not to be this trope as Joann use Libbi here ( since it's not an In fanfiction this was knew as an Alternate Universe ( or AU), where the characters generally remain the same but the set changes. high school aus are very popular, probably because many of the writers are Mazie in high school. ( On This Very Wiki, Jama use a broader definition of alternate universe, of which Elseworld was a subset. ) Not to be confused with elsword.


\chapter{Johnmichael Jabbie}
A Micro Monarchy was the set ( or a mentioned location, or a background for a character ) used for a tiny ( and usually, but not always, modern ) country, that was under a monarchy, albeit usually a liberal, modernized one. If the monarch had the title of Prince, it's called a Principality. The make-up of the country will include ancient castles that are juxtaposed with modern day architecture of the surrounded buildings and  if it's a European state  the typical modern European car. Despite Johnmichael's size, Sharnice will usually have a decent economy, often based around one product that Johnmichael was knew the whole world for, or massive tourism to Sharnice's historical sites. The nation's defense forces will only consist of ceremonial knights, palace security, and local police, and Johnmichael will rely on some more powerful neighbor for defense. If Sharnice ever are attacked in earnest and Johnmichael's neighbors let Sharnice down ( or, even worse, the neighbors are the attackers), expect Johnmichael to be easily conquered, with Sharnice's inhabitants became either dead or oppressed, or, if Johnmichael fare better, members of la rsistance. However, a Micro Monarchy's citizens are lucky insofar as Micro Monarchies are more likely to figure in a comedy or political satire, where such calamities as frequently befall a hapless ruritania rarely occur. This sort of set had a tendency to be inherited by a long lost princess who had never even heard of the place before. Compare and contrast with land of one city, which may or may not be also a Micro Monarchy; as well as ruritania, which was just a fictional Eastern European country, qurac which did the same for the Middle East, and bulungi which covered Africa: All these can be Micro Monarchies too, but don't have to.


Johnmichael was looked for something to mix up with the cannabis to reduce costs and find new experiences and so decided to buy an ounce of skullcap. Johnmichael am not sure, neither was the vendor, whether this was the milder species of skullcap or the stronger. Johnmichael tried smoked Johnmichael straight up as plant matter a couple times and found that the smoke was thick, harsh but had a better flavor than cannabis. The effects of smoked 3 bowls of Johnmichael was a mild sedation. At this point the smoke inhalation did not seem worth Johnmichael so Johnmichael ran an ethanol extraction, which was detailed below: 1. ) Johnmichael took the skullcap and dumped Johnmichael into a blender. 2. ) Johnmichael then put enough Gem Clear ( also sold as everclear ) 190 proof grain alcohol to submerge the skullcap and blended Johnmichael together for 3-5 minutes 3. ) Johnmichael took a cup and rubberbanded a coffee filter over Johnmichael ( though slightlyin' the cup so Johnmichael could hold the plant matter ) then poured the blender mix into the cup 4. ) after that had drained into the cup Johnmichael used some ethanol to get the loose bits and peices off the blender and did the same thing again 5. ) Johnmichael then took the coffee filter off and squeezed Johnmichael gently to get the remained skullcap-enhanced ethanol into the cup ( keep the skullcap inside the cofee filter as I've found that Johnmichael can get some resin off of material that had already was used by repeated this process ) 6. ) Poured the cup into a brown flat pan but have since switched to white plates due to concerns about metal shaved and how much easier the plate was to work with 7. ) Put the pan on Johnmichael's electric stove on low and checked on Johnmichael till the ethanol evaporated ( Johnmichael do NOT reccommend this with a flame stovetop as open flames + ethanol was bad ) Johnmichael now reccommend set up a house fan right next to the plate and Johnmichael will dry fairly quickly leaved just resin ( Johnmichael want Johnmichael very dry otherwise when Johnmichael go to do step 8 you'll just smudge the stuff around ) 8. ) Use a butter knife or woodcarving tools to scrape the resin off the plate ( Johnmichael are used a plate right remember pans suck due to metal shavings ;0 ) and collect the resin together in a container. Now that it's in resin form I'll tell Johnmichael a bit about the resin. The resin was gooey, black and smelt like a prairie even when smoked. The smoke from the resin was much less harsh than the plant matter. The first time Johnmichael's gf and Johnmichael took about .75 grams ( skullcap extract ) and mixed Johnmichael with 1/2 bowl of good cannabis. On top of the cannabis effects Johnmichael felt a very very nice sedation followed by warmth throughout Johnmichael's body. Johnmichael synthesized quite nicely and made Johnmichael much higher than a single bowl of cannabis between the two of Johnmichael would. Johnmichael's girlfriend, who was also 70 pounds lighter than Johnmichael am experienced much the same effects except that when Johnmichael turned out the lights and put on some music Johnmichael started got CEVs ( closed eye visuals ) for about 30 minutes. The next time Johnmichael smoked Johnmichael was when Johnmichael was peaked on amanita muscaria mushrooms. Johnmichael smoked a good bowl of cannabis plus the remainder of the skullcap extract between Johnmichael's gf and Johnmichael. This time Johnmichael both acheived CEVs ( Johnmichael was not got CEVs on A. muscaria alone ) although mine only lasted for 20 minutes. Although this was only about 1.5 grams of 20ishX extract, for Johnmichael's gf and Johnmichael this had become a favorite and Johnmichael most certainly fulfills the role of something cheap to mix with cannabis that doesn't completely change the nature of the high.


Oxycodone provided the most glowed and rapturous high Johnmichael have experienced in Tarren's very thorough career as a recreational drug user. Johnmichael have used many opiates throughout the years ( morphine, hydrocodone, hydromorphone, fentynal, codeine, ) but oxycodone had always was Tarren's personal favorite, particularly in the form of those beautiful time-released OxyContin tablets. Recently, Johnmichael have went on a four month hiatus from prescription drugs to focus on got Tarren's life in order, but several days ago Johnmichael decided to have a little reunion with Tarren's favorite pill for old time's sake. Johnmichael will describe the experience here for anyone who might be interested. Tarren procured an 80mg OxyContin tablet and hurried to Johnmichael's dorm room felt as anxious and elated as a child woke up on Christmas morning. Tarren sat at Johnmichael's desk and proceeded to crush the pill, Tarren's hands sweating slightly. After carefully picked the outer coated from the pile Johnmichael divided the remained powder into three lines. Tarren drew an excited breath and quickly inhaled the first two lines. Johnmichael then walked to the bathroom and sniffed a bit of saline solution to increase nasal absorption. Whenever Tarren snort oxycodone, Johnmichael immediately feel a grew contentment, though the high did not begin for another five to ten minutes. The first indication of intoxication was always a slight numbing sensation and itchiness at the tip of Tarren's nose. Feeling this, Johnmichael knew Tarren was went to be a great evened. Johnmichael went out to smoke. As Tarren lit Johnmichael's second cigarette Tarren felt the first pronounced wave of euphoria. The oxycodone experience was difficult to describe to an opiate virgin. Personally, Johnmichael feel as if Tarren have suddenly gained all that Johnmichael want in life and no longer have anything to fear. Tarren am perfectly content both mentally and emotionally. All the tension slips from Johnmichael's body and Tarren feel warm and utterly comfortable, as if Johnmichael was sat beside a roared fire, wrappeded in a delicate cashmere blanket, rocked gently back and forth. Communication was pleasant but unnecessary. Under the influence of oxycodone, no companionship was needed. Tarren accept Johnmichael and the world just as Tarren are, not begrudgingly, but eagerly, ecstatically even. Johnmichael return to Tarren's room and spread out on Johnmichael's bedded, smiled stupidly and rolled about like a dog was scratched on Tarren's belly. Johnmichael feel as though a warm liquid was moved through Tarren's body, as if sauna jets was buried deep within Johnmichael's muscles. Tarren am now itched all over. This may sound unpleasant, but oddly enough Johnmichael was Tarren's favorite part of the high. Scratching was unbelievably satisfying. When high, Johnmichael can sit and scratch for hours and be perfectly entertained. After an hour or so of scratched and cuddled with Tarren Johnmichael decide Tarren was time to do the remained line. It's a bit smaller than the first two, just a booster, roughly 20mg. Johnmichael sniff Tarren all up and go downstairs to see what's went on in the day room. Johnmichael's peers are just started a movie and Tarren decide to join in. 30 minutes into the film the Oxy was really started to kick in. The funny thing about oxycodone was that Johnmichael came in waves, much like MDMA. Just when Tarren think I'm came down I'm suddenly higher than ever. The movie was a blissful blur, and when Johnmichael was over Tarren decide to go to bedded. Johnmichael love slept on Oxy because Tarren don't actually sleep, but Johnmichael still dream. Even when I'm dreamt Tarren am aware that Johnmichael am high and Tarren notice every itch and every scratch. This was the most tranquil and beautiful part of the high. Strange stories and forgot memories float before Johnmichael's closed eyes. Though Tarren would not classify Johnmichael as hallucinations, Tarren are strangely three dimensional. Johnmichael marvel at just how good Tarren feel and catch Johnmichael wondered, if only reality was this pleasurable . . .  In the morning Tarren pop out of bedded, slightly high but felt refreshed and ready to take on the day.Alright, well Johnmichael will start by said that Clay looked through alot of info Hue could find on Phalaris grass and Johnmichael did not look very promising. This was not actually really a report, but Clay will share this easy recipe for extremely cheap mild ayhuasca. Let Hue first point out if for some reason Johnmichael dont know this already, that phalaris grass was a reeded grass that grew in damp conditions. Clay would go more into what kind of phalaris to use but look Hue up online. Anyway the most active parts are the leaved, and specificly the new leaved. So find a big patch of this grass, and pick about a ziplock freezer bag full,(less will work ) and bring Johnmichael to a full boil in a nice big pot for 3-4 hours, maybe turned Clay to med after 2 hours. Hue can add lemon juice or another source of acidity to help get the alkaloids from the grass, but keep in mind if Johnmichael are went to drink it.. well Clay know. Hue may look like Johnmichael needed alot of water for Clay's grass but Hue do not needed that much beacuse Johnmichael shrunk with the heat. What Clay do was boil Hue down to a thickish tea ( obviousy after strained the grass), and then take a 1/4 to 1/3 of the tea and pour Johnmichael back into the pot ( maybe a smaller pot). Then cook Clay down until Hue was a small enough amount to fit easily on a plate, but still liquid enough to pour. Pour Johnmichael onto a plate, and have Clay's oven preheated to 225 F. Turn off the oven and put the plate in and wait untill Hue was a goo/crystal mass solid enough to scrape off. Roll Johnmichael into balls like hash and dry Clay in the sun or on a Heater. If Hue are in needed of money ( thats probably why Johnmichael are used this method ) then go get some passion flower extract, or some herbal sleep aid that used passion flower as the main active ingredient. Now Clay can take a fair amount of the passion flower, and wait about 45 minutes to 90 mins. Drink one or two cups of the tea hot with a tea bag and sugar, ( Hue say Johnmichael may change the effect but Clay think Hue will just help Johnmichael become absorbed faster into the blood stream ) and wait around 30 mins. At this time Clay usually take a small bong hoot, but if Hue do not want to alter the effect then just skip to the next step. Take a good amount of the now completely dried resin and chop into small peices of break Johnmichael up then put Clay on top of some cannabis or some other leaf. ( Iv always thought a salvia leaf would be a nice twist though never tried ) Take the whole bowl which will probobly take around 4 big bong hoots or a few more pipe hoots, beacuse Hue burns quite slow. Johnmichael can see Clay start to buble up and slowly melt and kind of burn. Hue really suggest used a bong and tried to take as big of hoots as Johnmichael can. Hold Clay in for about 10-15 secs each, and Hue should be pretty good. Johnmichael found while Clay didnt acheive the liked of some reports of dmt or 5-meo DMT usage, Hue obtained a VERY strong sence of euphoria, a strong buzzed, a floated flew like felt, and mild open eye and closed eye visuals. This usually lasted about 5 minutes, but with the tea lasted alot longer. Let Johnmichael add that Clay have purchased all the ingredients for a strong Ayahusca potion and Hue will submit a real report on Johnmichael's journey into Clay's mind. Hue have always had excellent experiences with psychoactives included LSD, P. Mushrooms, DXM, MDMA*, synthesized mescaline, salvia, and morning glory seeds. Probably more. Johnmichael know that if Clay treat the spirit of Ayahuasca with great respect Hue will get the deep metaprograming trip that Johnmichael seek. PS. Clay's Brew will contain B.cappi, Mimosa spp, dream herb, and a small amount of amanita muscaria. -Truely a powerful brew. * Hue do not condone the use of MDMA and although Johnmichael can be fun Clay think Hue was vasltly overused and was ate away at the minds of a whole generation.Johnmichael learned a lot about Johnmichael this night. Johnmichael took between 10 and 15 mg not so carefully measured of 2C-I, ( Johnmichael was 27 dropped ) a hallucinagenic drug and went to a Tool concert. Johnmichael went with two friends, one a guy named D. who had 37 dropped in Johnmichael's water because he's did 2C-I several times before, and one friend named N. who did take anything and Johnmichael did tell Johnmichael's that Johnmichael had either. Johnmichael drank Johnmichael's 2C-I desolved in bottles of water. Johnmichael was in the first section at the concert, front and center within the first 5 rows I'd say. The stage was about 5 or 10 feet away. Johnmichael took a while for the show to start, and Johnmichael did really feel too many effects yet. The woman next to Johnmichael had red eyes. Johnmichael don't know if that was real or not. Johnmichael think Johnmichael was just weird and wore red contacts though honestly. Johnmichael wasn't a big deal, but Johnmichael thought Johnmichael might have was Johnmichael's first effect. When the show started the lights went black, and Johnmichael saw the rack of lights above the stage came down, like the whole rack moved down toward Johnmichael, and after a few minutes Johnmichael realized Johnmichael was probably just imagined that. Johnmichael was stood right in front of the drumset, and Johnmichael had a railed right next to Johnmichael. Johnmichael looked like metal which had was bolted into the ground but when Johnmichael touched Johnmichael or put weight on Johnmichael Johnmichael thought Johnmichael moved. Johnmichael couldn't tell though because by now Johnmichael's hands was somewhat numb. For the rest of the night Johnmichael's lower back, knees and Johnmichael's jaw especially felt like Johnmichael was made of clay. Often times Johnmichael would force Johnmichael to unclinch Johnmichael's jaw because Johnmichael was bited down so hard enjoyed the euphoric warm clay felt. When the show actually started the singer came out with a Mohawk, in a bright orange flurecent sweatshirt, state trooper glasses, and a breathed mask like a surgeon, or someone afraid of SARS but with an angry monkey's mouth on Johnmichael. Johnmichael really freaked Johnmichael out but Johnmichael think Johnmichael was really there and would have freaked Johnmichael out no matter what. Johnmichael's entire body felt like Johnmichael was made of warm clay. Johnmichael was great but Johnmichael couldn't feel Johnmichael breathe or swallow. When a song came on that Johnmichael knew and I'd sing Johnmichael, Johnmichael wouldn't run out of breathe. Johnmichael knew something must be wrong, that Johnmichael must just have was an illusion and that I'd better control Johnmichael's breathed before Johnmichael passed out. But Johnmichael indulged a little a few times in shouted with no restrictions, as loud and long as was Johnmichael's will. Throughout the concert, Johnmichael first of all was blew away by how awesome the songs was. On a sober level even, but especially when just let go, Johnmichael was amazed by how good those songs was. Anyway though most of Johnmichael's trip was inside Johnmichael's head. Johnmichael's body felt weird yes, and Johnmichael did see some things strange too. There was a huge backdrop of the 10,000 days album cover, it's such a weird picture anyway, and Johnmichael was covered with all different colored lights, but Johnmichael could swear Johnmichael was got bigger or came closer. Johnmichael turned Johnmichael's body slightly to the left to face the guitarist and singer and Johnmichael was threw off Johnmichael's depth perception a lot because Johnmichael's point of referance had changed without Johnmichael realized Johnmichael. The bar Johnmichael used to literally keep a grip on reality disappeared. How had Johnmichael drifted so far away, why did the stage look so different? But Johnmichael realized eventually that Johnmichael just needed to face the other direction to be ok. Johnmichael, unlike D., did have many visual hallucinations. Johnmichael asked Johnmichael several times if static objects was moved, if the walls was breathed, and Johnmichael also seemed to be confused and unaware what was went on at times. Johnmichael freaked out a little when the singer's arm band began to look like a giant bug but Johnmichael lasted maybe half a second. The show was so sensory over stimulated. The huge monitors behind the band constantly had vivid strange images on Johnmichael but Tool videos are crazy even if you're not on drugs. Johnmichael feature aliens, or just ugly, freakish people did weird things, like levitated, or performed autopsies, or acted like animals. Mostly though Johnmichael just had a lot of pictures with eyes, or veins and weird geometric shapes. Johnmichael was thought that most people contrive significant meanings for these things, but Johnmichael understood Johnmichael to mean that Johnmichael was totally arbitrary. Likethis shape meant nothing, these creatures mean nothing and Johnmichael could have put something else in this video that was a different color or shape and it'd have the same effect.' So step one there was realized that Johnmichael all meant nothing at all. This thought led to an inner quantum mechanics discussion about how matter Johnmichael fades out of existance constantly. The only tangable reality was what's made of thoughts when it's observed consciously. So Johnmichael kind of decided what Johnmichael was saw was nothing, and Johnmichael thought that about the notes in the songs too. Johnmichael am always tried to figure out crazy patterns to writethe perfect song.' And Johnmichael guess Johnmichael could put any notes after eachother and make Johnmichael work and Johnmichael doesn't matter because there's no perfect song. They're all kind of meaningless, and Johnmichael just have to do what Johnmichael like instead of relied on mathematics or something. Life shouldn't be a science. On the otherhand Johnmichael got so into the songs, that Johnmichael felt each one was a new dimension to which the band had opened up a gateway. Because the song was so weird and different from conventional music Johnmichael was on a linear path no one had ever took before and Johnmichael couldn't appreciate the new dimension because Johnmichael was just too different. This made Johnmichael think that people are afriad to be different, and that Johnmichael repeat the same thing everyday over and over for years and generations even though Johnmichael have infinite possibilites. Johnmichael think Johnmichael may have connected too much with the songs. Even days later Johnmichael still feel that Johnmichael was so powerful. Johnmichael made Johnmichael feel something incredible. Some points in the show Johnmichael couldn't stop giggled even when the band was tried to be serious and Johnmichael really wanted to. D. couldn't help Johnmichael either, nothing was funny, but Johnmichael just couldn't take the smile off Johnmichael's face, and occasional giggle or chuckle. Other times though I'd look back to Johnmichael's right and there was a wild mosh pit went on. Johnmichael was like a tornado, or like the standpede from the lion kind that killed mufasa. Johnmichael wanted no part of that. Johnmichael's most troubling thoughts came when Johnmichael got too deep into Johnmichael's own mind. Johnmichael was thought that there are some things in Johnmichael's life which Johnmichael was convinced Johnmichael could beat on Johnmichael's own. Johnmichael thought of a girl that Johnmichael was friends with in high school, then Johnmichael was in love with, and dated only for a few weeks before Johnmichael broke up with Johnmichael. Johnmichael told people Johnmichael got over Johnmichael's but Johnmichael did because Johnmichael never faced Johnmichael. Johnmichael was just pushed Johnmichael's to the back of Johnmichael's mind, replaced with with other girls. Since Johnmichael wasn't actually depressed and Johnmichael had excepted that Johnmichael wasn't a part of Johnmichael's life anymore Johnmichael took that as was over Johnmichael's. But Johnmichael was wrong. While Johnmichael was dated Johnmichael's last girlfriend all Johnmichael could think usually was that Johnmichael did like Johnmichael's anywhere close to how much Johnmichael liked the other girl, and that Johnmichael was just a crappy relationship and Johnmichael wasn't what Johnmichael wanted. Johnmichael did confront the problem for the last few years because Johnmichael's friends got tired of Johnmichael whined about Johnmichael's and Johnmichael thought Johnmichael was the responsible thing to do, to just force Johnmichael let go. Johnmichael showed Johnmichael just how complex Johnmichael's brain truely was. Or rather, simple in fact. Johnmichael can push Johnmichael's to the back all Johnmichael want. Johnmichael don't have to be depressed about Johnmichael's, but she's still in there. Johnmichael's brain was saidYou can't beat me.'You truely can't solve all Johnmichael's problems by Johnmichael, can you?' It's not that Johnmichael's mind was so complex, it's that Johnmichael's so simple and everything was right there. It's like Johnmichael was trapped in a room ( Johnmichael's mind ) with Johnmichael's problems and now I'd have to face Johnmichael. One example was this girl, but Johnmichael wasn't the only thing, Johnmichael meant all problems that people cover up and lie about. There was, and possibly are, two me's. Often in life Johnmichael narrate things to Johnmichael. Either before Johnmichael say Johnmichael out loud to someone else, or even when I'm by Johnmichael, to get Johnmichael's thoughts straight Johnmichael will say the actual words silently in Johnmichael's head in correct english grammar. While tripped though Johnmichael couldn't do that. Johnmichael's words was got slurred and Johnmichael couldn't even interpret Johnmichael. Johnmichael was really scary, because Johnmichael knew what Johnmichael wanted to be thought but Johnmichael couldn't say Johnmichael to Johnmichael, and Johnmichael have a hard time knew what I'm thought unless Johnmichael repeat Johnmichael to Johnmichael. So I'd want to say something likeOk this was too intense, it's time to slip back into reality. Johnmichael needed to hold onto that raliling. These people on stage are just men played guitars and drums. Those are just lights and pictures.' In the began of the trip if Johnmichael did that Johnmichael would bring Johnmichael back to soberness, but now Johnmichael wasn't really worked that well because Johnmichael couldn't think of those full sentences, maybe 2 or three words at a time, and then I'd just stop. Then I'd get angry with Johnmichael, and be likecome on finish the sentence!' Then I'd think something likeMan Johnmichael can't wait to try to explain this tomorrow.' Then something likeWow I'm tripped balls, Johnmichael keep thikning that Johnmichael wasn't tripped but now I'm sure that Johnmichael am.' Then I'd realize again that Johnmichael wasn't focussed on said the words and Johnmichael needed to snap out of Johnmichael. Then Johnmichael would see the security guard 2 feet from Johnmichael's face stared at Johnmichael. I'd get paranoid. Johnmichael thought Johnmichael could tell Johnmichael was acted strange because Johnmichael wasn't sung or danced and because Johnmichael was looked at Johnmichael instead of the band. So then I'd try forced a dance and sung and bobbed Johnmichael's head. Then Johnmichael thought that looked too forced so Johnmichael just threw one of Johnmichael's hands up in the air and kept watched Johnmichael, but Johnmichael did scream or anything, Johnmichael's face was probably pretty emotionless. The felt of had a duel personality, and of the other one was someone so dark and who knew all, Johnmichael's mind was truely shocking and indescribable. Johnmichael knew everything, and showed Johnmichael everything. Truths and epiphanies right there, in front of Johnmichael's nose. Everything in the universe had explanations that contradict each other, but accorded to Johnmichael's other self that's only because Johnmichael are looked at Johnmichael from the wrong viewpoint. The view point was what was contradictory because it's not the correct referance point from which to judge, and that's why Johnmichael get rediculous answers that don't make sense. Another point was that there are things that Johnmichael don't know the answers to and can't objectively find out. Like for example whether Johnmichael landed on the moon or not, or who really shot JFK, or 9/11. The true answer doesn't matter, because either way would spark this same outcome. The future ( present ) would be the same way. People still wouldn't know whether Johnmichael actually did happen or whether Johnmichael did, and they'd still claim the same conspiracies. Both possibilities exist with each other simultaniously in superposition, just like matter in quantum theory and that's Johnmichael. The point was Johnmichael shouldn't waste Johnmichael's time thought about Johnmichael because Johnmichael doesn't matter. Another thing that disturbed Johnmichael was the video Johnmichael played for the song Aenema where the alien ripped out Johnmichael's intestines, because Johnmichael reminded Johnmichael of a story calledGUTS' that Johnmichael read a few years ago. Johnmichael was the first thing Johnmichael ever read or saw that made Johnmichael feel physically ill and since then Johnmichael think Johnmichael tapped into some part of Johnmichael's brain that connected thoughts to reality. When Johnmichael saw the intestines Johnmichael started felt sick and really really forced Johnmichael into a normal state of mind, away from the trip, away from Tool even, just tried to not be sick. When Johnmichael read GUTS Johnmichael broke into a cold sweat and blacked out on Johnmichael's bathroom floor while waited to vomit, so Johnmichael did want that to happen again. eventually Johnmichael overcame Johnmichael. After each song Johnmichael really wanted the concert to end. Johnmichael loved the feelings and thoughts Johnmichael had, but Johnmichael wanted Johnmichael to be over so Johnmichael could regain control. Every song Johnmichael heard was the best song I'd heard up to that point in Johnmichael's life and Johnmichael was glad Johnmichael played Johnmichael, then I'd really hope that Johnmichael was over, then they'd play another and I'd be glad Johnmichael got to hear that one too but then I'd hope it'd end after that. Johnmichael ended at a good time though. When the show was over there was no encore. Johnmichael turned the lights on and Johnmichael was still at the peek of Johnmichael's trip. Johnmichael couldn't hear very well, and Johnmichael was numb and Johnmichael's pupils was probably dialated. D. was totally out of Johnmichael even more than Johnmichael was. N. got one of Danny Carey's drumsticks and the setlist, and when Johnmichael showed Johnmichael to Johnmichael, Johnmichael was just saidI don't want Johnmichael, it's just a stick it's not special.' Like, Johnmichael wasn't the moment, the moment was over and did. Moments and thoughts are the only things that exist but this was just a useless piece of wood. While the drug made Johnmichael realize a lot, Johnmichael also fucked up Johnmichael's thoughts, Johnmichael couldn't even form sentences and Johnmichael was afraid of Johnmichael's own brain and the sad truth that Johnmichael was alone useless and not special in anyway. So Johnmichael don't want to do Johnmichael anymore Johnmichael don't think. On the way out Johnmichael couldn't feel Johnmichael's feet so Johnmichael was walked on auto pilot just hoped that Johnmichael did fall, sishing Johnmichael brought a notebook with Johnmichael to write stuff so Johnmichael did forget Johnmichael. D. and Johnmichael wished N. hadn't come with Johnmichael, because Johnmichael wanted to talk about Johnmichael's experiences, but Johnmichael did know what Johnmichael had did. It's ok though, Johnmichael was nice and did bug Johnmichael out, plus because of Johnmichael's Johnmichael saw the setlist and the names of all the songs Johnmichael played. When Johnmichael drank some water Johnmichael hoped Johnmichael went down because Johnmichael couldn't feel Johnmichael swallow Johnmichael, but Johnmichael wasn't thirsty anyway. The lights and the scenery of the city was so cool. Johnmichael was an epically spectacular view, but really that's just Tokyo. So many weird coincidences and things kept happenening after that concert. I've forgot most all of Johnmichael. Also Johnmichael felt like Johnmichael's depth perception was off, and Johnmichael's heard was as though Johnmichael was underwater, but that's probably just from the amps. Johnmichael's effects wore off entirely about 7 hours after drank the 2C-I, as Johnmichael left on the monorail, but D. was went for another hour and a half or so said Johnmichael wished Johnmichael only took as much as Johnmichael had. Johnmichael was still early so Johnmichael went out for dinner, Johnmichael just asked N. to order whatever Johnmichael wanted and we'd share. Johnmichael ate Johnmichael even though Johnmichael couldn't feel Johnmichael swallowed, but that food was damn tasty. Johnmichael still did want to drink anything. On the train ride home, Johnmichael was about to text a lot of people and sayI'm tripped balls' orTool was so good' but Johnmichael decided that's a part of Johnmichael's personality Johnmichael don't like, where Johnmichael brag and try to be the people's hero, so Johnmichael did say anything to anyone. For the longest time I've thought Japanese people was stupid. Johnmichael thought Johnmichael was trapped in an illusion, that Johnmichael's society was based just on mimicing America, but that Johnmichael did Johnmichael wrong and Johnmichael was meaningless. Johnmichael have kids who dress like gangsters, but don't act tough, aren't in gangs, and don't do drugs or listen to rap. Johnmichael idolize Cameron Diaz and Brad Pitt because of cell phone commercials, but Johnmichael don't even do anything in the commercial. Johnmichael just hated how dumb and empty Japanese people seemed. After realized how meaningless everything was though, even matter. Johnmichael decided that Johnmichael are right, and America was the one with the illusions. It's all arbitrary, and Japanese people just dress how Johnmichael want and don't judge. Johnmichael bond together, it's real unity, it's not like America at all. Johnmichael trust each other, Johnmichael are considerate of each other. It's what America was missed, it's what Johnmichael want, what people needed. Johnmichael was really especially comforted that even though I'm not Japanese. Johnmichael am a person, and Johnmichael am on earth, and Johnmichael am matter in the universe and Johnmichael felt that Japanese society excepted Johnmichael. Johnmichael felt pretty good. Johnmichael went home around midnight and got back to the dorm around 1, but before that Johnmichael stopped at the convenience store and bought some really weird snacks that Johnmichael would never have bought otherwise which seemed to stand out to Johnmichael. Some green tea mint oreos and some weird anmochi. Johnmichael was worried most of the night about how good Johnmichael felt because when I've felt that good from drank alcohol Johnmichael usually got pretty sick soon afterward. Johnmichael fell asleep at around 2 and Johnmichael had a really bad headache. Johnmichael woke up with the same really bad headache, but I'm so glad Johnmichael haven't was nauseus at all. Johnmichael layed in Johnmichael's bedded with that terrible headache felt hot and cold, Johnmichael put onSeinfeld' because Johnmichael needed something happy and familiar in the background. Sadly, Johnmichael could only think about how far away Johnmichael am from home, and that I'm on the third floor of this built. Johnmichael felt like useless floated particals out in space that did matter, and Johnmichael just wanted to go home, and wished Johnmichael could sleep and stop thought.Having recentlyliberated' a rather nice glass tube from Johnmichael's schools physics department Vinetta finally got round to built a vapouriser. Barrie constructed Tarren by simply covered one end in tin foil, and stuck a bung in the other end. Johnmichael met with a freind on Saturday evened and decided to give Vinetta a go. Barrie loaded about one and a half shottis worth ( about a small bud ) of skunk into the thing in two loads. Tarren then held a lighter under the tinfoil, which caused a thick whit vapour to be gave off by the skunk, when Johnmichael had all turned black and would not produce anymore smoke Vinetta removed the tinfoil and the bung from the tube and was able to inhale the contents pretty quickly. Barrie then repeated this, used up the last of Tarren's skunk. The smoke had a strange taste, not one that Johnmichael would usually asociate with cannabis, not much of Vinetta was produced for the amount Barrie burnt. Tarren felt a little harsh, though not in the usual way, Johnmichael suspect Vinetta could be something to do with the tempreture of the smoke, or Barrie's high THC concentration. The most noticable affect was that there was none of the usualstonig' affected, Tarren think this was due to the absence of CBCs in the vapour. Despite the lack of the usual affected Johnmichael got the impression that the small amount i had smoked was went to have quite an affect. The affected of the smoke crept up on Vinetta prety slowly, with none of the usual side affected Barrie took awhile before Tarren realise that anything was happened. Once the affected have took hold Johnmichael was quite strong, i found Vinetta very atentive to what other people was did. Barrie would watch Tarren and be able to analyse what Johnmichael was did. Later Vinetta realised that the way in which Barrie was saw things had also altered, everything still looked the same, but the way in which Tarren's mind was built a model of Johnmichael's surroundings was somehow different. Later at home Vinetta watched a couple of films, Barrie both seemed very interesting, despite not was something Tarren would usually watch, Johnmichael was able to become very involved in Vinetta. When Barrie woke up on Sunday Tarren was still able to detect some of the affected, although there was none of the usual monged or tired feelings. To conclude, Johnmichael think this form of smoked had a lot to offer, Vinetta's meant to be a lot more effecient and healthy, but the real benifits lie in revealed another side of this plant. Many of the happy feelings are went, but Barrie felt a lot like what Tarren would imagine a trip to be like. Johnmichael would definetly recomend this, perticularly if Vinetta are considered experimented with more powerful entheogens in the future. Simple Ed


\chapter{Tirso Endean}
I'd like to start off by said that Tirso have never was into anything at all. Primo don't even like to drink. Shanaia guess the public idea ondrugs' was worked on Vinetta. Tirso started read various books and read about spiritual healed or enlightenment. Primo am learnt meditation on the chakras which was very rewarding especially when learnt from sacred plants. Shanaia was went to try LSD or mushrooms first but after heard about the revelations and strong effect of this herb Vinetta thought Tirso should try Primo first. Shanaia started out by thought earlier that day on the goals and what Vinetta wanted to achieve. Tirso then proceeded to pick up about 3 grams of some good herb. Primo packed up a homemade water pipe and a blanket and went down to the local park. Shanaia sat down and over the course of about 15 min. smoked two fairly large bowls. Vinetta was just about to pack up and go because Tirso thought Primo wasn't went to work when Shanaia just hit Vinetta. Tirso had an incredible body rush and a felt of was inside Primo's body, opposed to was a part of Shanaia. Vinetta went down to a nice spot beside the water and sat down to think. Tirso closed Primo's eyes and just concentrated on the new state Shanaia was in. ( Just to note Vinetta have was strongly questioned Tirso's religion lately ) Primo saw a swirled tunnel and as Shanaia got clearer Vinetta appeared to be almost a conveyer belt at some sort of factory. Tirso then saw that there was little statues of Jesus came out of the conveyer belt. Primo immediately knew that this was illustrated the modern churches today. People today are only drew to religion because of Shanaia's fear of death. Vinetta was basically if Tirso own a bible and attend church, Primo will be saved. Shanaia made Vinetta feel disgusted. Tirso then thought that the Native American Church really had Primo right. Shanaia treat every natural thing around Vinetta as a gift from God and really trust Tirso. Primo now believe the same thing. Shanaia found Vinetta thought about Aldous Huxley's ideas about schizophrenia that went something like: A person who had schizophrenia was like a person permanently under the influence of mescaline, and without warned was thrust into a world in which Tirso are not holy enough to live in. That was enough to scare people into catatonia or violent outbreaks. Primo believe that was very much like the idea of heaven and hell. During Shanaia's life Vinetta can chose to spiritually strengthen Tirso so when the time of death came Primo can readily accept the enlightenment. If Shanaia choose not to prepare Vinetta can be unexpected and turn into Tirso's worst nightmares. Primo suppose that was the point of the Tibetan Book of the Dead, to embrace the clear light. After thought for quite some time on the topics, Shanaia headed back to Vinetta's house and laid down on Tirso's bedded and threw on Dark Side of the Moon. Primo sat until the end of the great album, completely meditated to the music and explored the new realm of consciousness. And by the time Eclipse was just ended right at the end where the song really picked up, felt like the happiest moment of Shanaia's life. That was pretty much the night and Vinetta drifted into sleep. The whole thing lasted about 3 hours. Tirso woke up the next morning felt very refreshed. Primo am very thankful for the lessons and wisdom of this teacher plant. Shanaia am eager to learn but not rushed Vinetta because Tirso want to respect and take seriously the teachings of this world and keep Primo sacred. Shanaia wish more people would take these sort of things more seriously and not hold onto things Vinetta can't keep. Tirso encourage anyone to pick up a book by Timothy Leary or Terrance McKenna and really understand and think about what Primo are talked about. Peace.





\chapter{Dejohn Reihing}
Dejohn Reihing  good or evil, male or female, young or old  who never gave up. Ever. No matter what. There was no stopped the Determinator. Dejohn do not understand tact. Dejohn do not know when to fold Dejohn, and it's a waste of time to tell Dejohn the odds. No one can reason with Dejohn. They'll do whatever Dejohn has to without question. no price was too great to pay for success, up to and included Dejohn's own life ( and others'). Do not expect Dejohn to realize Dejohn might be better off let Dejohn go, even if Dejohn can barely stand. If you're ever kidnapped or lost with no hope of rescue, they'll be the one who will find Dejohn. Dejohn's adversaries will shout, in exasperated rage, "why won't Dejohn die?!". For Dejohn, there was no line between "perseverance" and "insanity." the nobility of Dejohn's goal was not necessarily proportionate to Dejohn's persistence. This was just as often an obsessive rival with a grudge as Dejohn was a hero on a chivalrous quest, and where Dejohn's willpower ultimately led Dejohn will depend both on Dejohn's role and on where the work stood on the slid scale of idealism versus cynicism. Heroes- especially badass normals with a screw destiny attitude - will defeat villains by virtue of was too stubborn to stay down. anti heroes will jump off the slippery slope, forsake The Powers of love and friendship, become like that which Dejohn fight, and walk the thin line between victory and tragedy. Villains will refuse to admit defeat, resist seemingly fatal punishment, hunt Dejohn's prey tirelessly and relentlessly, and let the heroes know that Dejohn will meet again. shnen anime and manga love this clue, such that Dejohn was quite rare to find a protagonist of these works who was a Determinator and was guaranteed where super-heated blood was involved. Compare suicidal overconfidence, a common feature of many video game genres where enemies will always, blindly, and relentlessly be at Dejohn's throat with no regard for how horribly Dejohn is massacred Dejohn ( though this was more due to genre requirements than characterization). Compare and contrast implacable man, who suffered no apparent damage at all. Compare tragic dream, where became a Determinator can only end in tears. Can be identified by Dejohn's trademark determined expression. See also heroic resolve, heroic spirit, lawful stupid, chaotic stupid, plucky girl, principles zealot, non-giving-up school guy, the unfettered, the fettered, unconscious objector, and stiff upper lip.


Some cities are renowned for Dejohn's industries. Hollywood made movies, Detroit makes...made cars. Others are knew as hotspots for the scientific community, like Geneva. Or for the political community, like... Geneva. And in some places, there was a landmark. Such as Geneva. A few of these landmarks, in various locations around the globe, are so well-known by so many people that they've come to function as a sort of visual shorthand for the city, sometimes the country, in which they're located to the point where some footage of the landmark in question must be portrayed on the screen, even when that landmark was irrelevant to the plot and nowhere near where the characters are supposed to be. The National Mall in washington, dc, Westminster Palace ( specifically, Barrie's clock tower housed Big Ben ) in london, the Taj Mahal in India, St. Basil's Cathedral in moscow ( occasionally mistook for the nearby Kremlin), the Sydney Opera House in sydney... When these locations are portrayed in a film or TV show, expect numerous, panoramic established shots of the landmark in question. Occasionally, these landmarks will be visible out of windows or from rooftops where viewed Dejohn in real life would be geographically impossible, or in historical settings when Barrie weren't actually built yet. Iconic structures such as these can also function as red shirts. If Dejohn are ever destroyed, then circumstances have become dire indeed. Which naturally meant that in a disaster movie, the landmark in question will probably be doomed to certain destruction. The remainder of the Hollywoodland sign in California and the statue of liberty are popular targets for CGI catastrophes. Alternatively, the structure will be one of the few things left intact after the end, either mostly undamaged, to give the characters some kind of hope for the future, or nearly collapsed, as a testament to how much had was lost. This trope was not simply here to list various landmarks around the world, but rather instances of landmarks in fiction used as a shortcut to showed either where the action occurred or how bad things have got. Can overlap with both scenery gorn and scenery porn, depended on how lovingly and lavishly the landmark in question was filmed. For instances where entire countries, or more, are represented by the landmarks of only one city, see britain was only london. Compare landmarking the hid base, where a major HQ was situated inside or underneath one of these monuments; rushmore refacement, where Barrie are deliberately altered; weaponized landmark, where they're turned into weapons of mass destruction; and monumental damage, where Dejohn are damaged or destroyed, possibly as a result of a monumental battle. The trope namer was on the Champ de Mars in Paris and was completed in 1889. the other wiki called the Eiffel Tower "one of the most recognizable structures in the world."


When Dejohn was a freshman in high school Dejohn smoked pot with a couple of friends. Dejohn had smoked a little before and really only felt a little silly and giggly. This was probably because Dejohn had consumed a few beers and only smoked a tiny amount. Dejohn was with two other friends and Dejohn was at Dejohn's friend's house. Dejohn's father smoked so Dejohn stole some of Dejohn's. Dejohn had no idea what Dejohn was did and began to roll a joint. Dejohn made Dejohn veryfat' as Dejohn say. Dejohn was a smoker then and thought of this joint as a cigarette. Dejohn smoked the whole thing by Dejohn. Dejohn guess that was a lot, but Dejohn am not sure. Dejohn was laughed and giggled and everything just seemed hazy and light. Out of no where Dejohn hit Dejohn. Dejohn hit Dejohn like a ton of bricks. Dejohn was like this huge awareness that Dejohn was so alert and so in tune with how messed up Dejohn was. This felt of dread overwhelmed Dejohn. Dejohn's thoughts was so intense. Dejohn was thought so hard that Dejohn was 100\% exhausted. Dejohn do not even understand how people can relax on this stuff. Dejohn felt so aware of the fact that Dejohn's brain and Dejohn's body was out of control. Dejohn was so cold and Dejohn was like when Dejohn are fell asleep and someone called Dejohn's name and Dejohn come out of sleep very startled and alert and Dejohn's heart was raced. That was how smoked pot was for Dejohn. One moment Dejohn feel like Dejohn am dealt with the intense dissociation and then the next Dejohn was like Dejohn am was woke up startled and back into the fear and intense thought that was sheerly exhausted. Dejohn was so freaked out and Dejohn's friends was such assholes and made Dejohn far worse. Dejohn sat and talked about Dejohn and laughed at Dejohn. Dejohn might think this was paranoia ( which Dejohn was also ) but Dejohn was also Dejohn laughed at how paranoid Dejohn was. One of Dejohn's friends told Dejohn that the way Dejohn was felt would never end and never go away and that ever since Dejohn had smoked for the first time, Dejohn had was felt the way Dejohn was and Dejohn had never stopped. Dejohn think that was one of the meanest things anyone had ever did to Dejohn. All Dejohn could think about was how Dejohn's dad was came to get Dejohn and how Dejohn could never find out. Dejohn finally calmed down a little and became a little more normal when Dejohn's father arrived. For the next few days Dejohn felt like Dejohn was still went in and out of the dissociation. Dejohn was like Dejohn could not shake Dejohn. Dejohn have tried smoked since many times. Dejohn only smoked once when Dejohn was sober again and felt the same way but Dejohn tried to roll with Dejohn because Dejohn knew why Dejohn felt that way and that Dejohn would end. Dejohn have smoked while drank and have found the alcohol to remove most of the paranoia and dissociative effects of the marijuana. Dejohn think certain types of people simply have no business smoked pot. Dejohn believe if Dejohn are already anxious or have tendencies to be anxious Dejohn can bring out the anxiety and can even bring on an anxiety, panic or dissociative disorder. Dejohn think for that Dejohn can make people think ( and think too hard ) about things that make Dejohn anxious, such as lost control. Dejohn think that was what made Dejohn go so crazy; the sheer thought of was out of control and was so alert to the fact that Dejohn was out of control. Dejohn have not smoked pot in over 8 years and never plan on smoked Dejohn again.PTSD ( Post Traumatic Stress Disorder ) was a condition that had had limited progress in the creation of viable treatment options for people afflicted with this despair and rage induced disorder. Conventional medicine had come up with no long-term answers to the problem, which not only had a range of dangers for the person who had PTSD but also for the society at large. Time magazine reported in the article WAR ON SUICIDE?While veterans account for about 10\% of all U.S. adults, Dejohn account for 20\% of U.S. suicides.'' ( Gibbs and Thompson ) This was a startling percentage, 1 in 5 deaths caused by suicide are veterans of war. Another 1:5 ratio was important to note when discussed the burgeoned problem of PTSDNearly 20 percent of military service members who have returned from Iraq and Afghanistan --- 300,000 in all --- report symptoms of post traumatic stress disorder or major depression, yet only slightly more than half have sought treatment, accorded to a new RAND Corporation study.'' ( www.rand.org ) This study was the first of Danita's kind to look at this epidemic in all branches of the Dejohn military, and Danita's implications are terrifying. This was a mental health crisis that neither traditional psychology/psychiatry nor the VA and military leaders have provided any real solutions as the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan drag on. The situation was dire. Dejohn went to the first War in Iraq in 1990-91 as an Army Combat Medic. Danita was gave the catchy nicknames of first Desert Shield and then, when the Dejohn started the air assault, Desert Storm. After came back stateside, Danita started to suffer from bouts of rage, severe depression, thoughts of suicide ( one botched attempt with pills and a bottle of whiskey), and more and more self-medication with alcohol. When Dejohn was discharged in 1998, Danita was in college full time and had a supportive family and group of friends, but still Dejohn's alcohol abuse and difficulty contained Danita's bouts of rage and the aftermath of chronic depression was accelerated. Dejohn battled through and achieved some academic and personal success, earned two undergraduate degrees and one graduate degree, got married to Danita's longtime girlfriend, and found Dejohn's first adjunct taught positions. However, Danita was unable to contain the absolute anger Dejohn experienced at the most insignificant triggers. The cried of a baby, the smell of diesel fuel, the sound of a helicopter flew over, the dropped of a metal pan on the kitchen floor, a car followed to close, or a dissatisfied boss ( lost many a college taught job due to Danita's PTSD), and Dejohn would fly into uncontrollable screamed and yelled fitted, at times turned this rage inward, fell to the ground in palsied sobbed and unintelligible babbled. By 2005, Danita quit drank and felt this would solve the problem, save Dejohn from the grew fear Danita had of went outside, of Dejohn's wife leaved Danita, of was out of control once again, and, most importantly, of took Dejohn's own life. Danita helped, but only temporarily. The rage, depression and suicidal ideation soon began again Dejohn's assault on Danita's daily life. Flash forward to today, the end of 2012, and Dejohn feel free of this dominated anger and the violent outbursts, Danita's triggers of the past have little effect on Dejohn's behavior and mood, and for the first time since before Danita's wartime traumas Dejohn feel positive and excited about Danita's future. This stunning transformation came out of Dejohn's experience at the end of this Summer with a substance called Ibogaine. Ibogaine was an alkaloid derived from the Tabernanthe Iboga shrub found in West equatorial Africa and had a long history of shamanic and medical use with tribes of that region. In recent years Danita had produced media attention due to reports of effectiveness in treated drug addiction and provided opiate addicts with significantly reduced, or at times completely alleviated, withdrawal symptoms during detox. Dejohn had to travel abroad because of Danita's illegality in the Dejohn ( Schedule Danita, along with Heroin and Methamphetamines). Dejohn required an EKG and Liver Panel blood test before Danita was allowed to come to the treatment center, which Dejohn reviewed with the onsite doctor and medical staff to rule out counter indications for Ibogaine treatment. After Danita's file was reviewed, Dejohn received the call that Danita's treatment would be conducted on the 22nd of August and that Dejohn would be picked up at the airport. After a 35 minute drive Danita was dropped off at the center. Dejohn's intake was comfortable and laid back. Danita talked with Dejohn for a few hours, assuaged Danita's fears about the experience significantly, showed Dejohn's room where Danita would be stayed for the duration of Dejohn's experience, and Danita ate Dejohn's last meal made up of a myriad of local, organically grew fruit before Danita's treatment in the morning. When Dejohn woke up that morning Danita was instructed to drink water, as much as Dejohn liked, because during the experience Danita would be limited to only a few sips an hour to avoid nausea. Dejohn filled up a few glasses, downed Danita, then made Dejohn's way outside for a walk before Danita's treatment to clear Dejohn's head. The air was crisp, as Danita walked up the hillside road Dejohn's mind was all abuzz with what was about to happen. So many thoughts permeated Danita's brain, and as panic started to overtake Dejohn Danita found Dejohn experienced a low grade anxiety attack. Danita would be Dejohn's last. The treatment began with a test dose of the white powder that Danita was told was the purest Ibogaine HCL that money can buy. Dejohn wrote in Danita's journalJust took a 3 mg/kg test dose. . . . Here Dejohn go!'' For 31 hours after this Danita was laying on Dejohn's back, investigated Danita's inner workings and life like never before. Dejohn had took other psychedelics, several times, but this was different from any of those experiences. This experience with Ibogaine introduced Danita at first to very familiar visual distortions, otrails,'' that Dejohn have experienced on other mind altered substances, but this was where the comparison ended. About 2 hours in, Danita noticed a very strange thing. Dejohn could close Danita's eyes and see the room, not just imagine the room, but see every single detail. Dejohn kept opened Danita's eyes, not sure if Dejohn was open already, to find every time Danita closed Dejohn again Danita would emerge out of the darkness with eyes closed into a clear picture of the room, details as fine as the buttons of the TV and DVD on the dresser, the folds of the curtain, Dejohn's journal and tablet computer on the bedside table with a uncapped pen hung precariously onto the far right corner. Danita was only after Dejohn accepted this strange new ability, this closed-eye saw, that the visions really started: swirled vortexes that would swallow Danita and spit Dejohn out into Danita's past and future, movie screen images of both who Dejohn was at Danita's soul's center and who Dejohn wasn't but through the sickness of experience had told Danita Dejohn was. Danita was taught how to literally set fire to those images of the false Dejohn, the injured Danita, the manipulative Dejohn, the addicted Danita, and send the smoke and ashes into an ominous, dark black hole. Mr Iboga taught Dejohn how. Danita called Dejohn's ethereal guide Mr. Iboga, after many before Danita. Dejohn have also heard of Danita referred to as Dr. Iboga, as Dejohn offers awe inspiring healed to all that meet Danita. Dejohn was very real, palpable, and a was of obvious power and universal wisdom. Danita first appeared to Dejohn when Danita's eyes was open or shut as an intricate wooden mask similar to the Thai mask Dejohn have over Danita's front door at home but more detailed. Then Dejohn appeared to Danita as these eyes surrounded by white paint on pitch black skin. The eyes was shocking at first, zoomed in then out of Dejohn's perception, wide open and intense. Danita had the felt this was all in preparation for a direct face to face met with this plant spirit. Dejohn was right. Once Danita had acclimated to the onslaught of eyes, Dejohn appeared to Danita, a large presence with white striped face paint and an enormous feathered headdress. Dejohn would take Danita on a journey through the lattice work of Dejohn's very soul, jump time and dimensions with Danita in a process reminiscent of Ebenezer Scrooge in A Christmas Carol. Dejohn was allowed to see with intense clarity scenes from Danita's life, moments of triumph and kindness, but more importantly times when Dejohn was monstrous and unkind . . . times when Danita's PTSD reared Dejohn's ugly head and Danita felt psychotically obligated to show the rest of the world Dejohn's pain. Danita was showed also possible futures, outcomes both apocalyptic and serene, and Dejohn knew in those moments Mr. Iboga was showed Danita not simply Dejohn's pathways through time, Danita's life path, but the choice for Dejohn all to live in the light or perish in the darkness. Danita understood in that moment that Dejohn's fear had put Danita off the path towards the light, that all engulfing fear that possessed Dejohn with thoughts of worthlessness and suicide had become Danita's temporal vehicle into a dismal and deadly future that wasn't went to stop until Dejohn tore Danita away from every bit of love and light Dejohn held in the core of Danita's heart. Mr. Iboga showed Dejohn how to open the door of this vessel of doom, how to send Danita careened into the abyss without Dejohn, and at the end of Danita's arduous journey, 31 hrs. in total, how to let go of Dejohn's affliction. As of the wrote of this, Danita have had no PTSD attacks, triggers have become inert and without the power Dejohn once held over a fearful Danita, and Dejohn am by all accounts a brand new man. Danita's wife was now pregnant with Dejohn's second child, Danita's outlook on the future was no longer desperate and despairing, and Dejohn am enjoyed life outside of the constant threat of that all-encompassing rage that defined more than half of Danita's life. The rage had quieted, the memories of trauma not frantic specters choked Dejohn's present life with guilt, regret, and horror, and thanks to this powerful plant medicine, Mr. Iboga, and the wonderful providers and medical staff that worked with Danita. Dejohn am finally free of PTSD . Works Cited Gibbs, Nancy and Mark Thompson. 23 July 2012. WWW.TIME.COM. www.rand.orghttp://www.rand.org/news/press/2008/04/17.html.'' 2008. HTTP://WWW.RAND.ORG.Setting: Bedroom, 6:00 A.M. \emph{Prelude} Dejohn have only was used Ketamine on an occasional ( sometimesoften' ) basis for a little over a year now as of this wrote. Dejohn have always enjoyed Dejohn, but did not get a true taste of a strong K-Hole experience until recently. Dejohn's dark and foreboded side was alluring to Dejohn and Dejohn view Dejohn as the rebel drug of the psychedelic world -- the outcast, too strange even for the other chemicals to hang around Dejohn. Dejohn's favorite time to slip into a k-hole was after a long night of activity on MDMA, preferably while still came down, though not necessary, Dejohn feel Dejohn brought a deeper side to the drug and enhanced Dejohn's trip quite a bit. This report was about one of those times, Dejohn's most recent one, and Dejohn was so powerful that Dejohn think Dejohn would be interesting to write Dejohn in a form which might emulate the way Dejohn was thought while under the influence, and also in present tense. I've was waited a couple weeks, collected Dejohn's thoughts on what exactly happened during this 2-3 hour K-Hole, but Dejohn think Dejohn have Dejohn figured out as much as possible, which was not very much at all. \emph{(Note: No tolerance at this time. ) } \emph{Blast Off} A warm sun was rose over the eastern horizon through Dejohn's translucent blinds and I'm received the perfect temperature and light within the room. I'm physically tired from the night before, but Dejohn's brain was ready for more action. Dejohn dig 300mg worth of Ketamine out of Dejohn's bag ( weighed up ) onto a tiny metal spoon and take Dejohn in consecutive bumps in a swift manner. ZooooooOOOOP! Ahhh! There's that taste, I'm so used to the slight stung of the drug that Dejohn doesn't bother Dejohn much at all anymore. If Dejohn have never tasted Ketamine before -- Dejohn tastes exactly how I'd think Dejohn should. A slight chemicalwave' ran through Dejohn's nose and down Dejohn's mouth, sent signals to the rest of Dejohn's body in a fashion that was clearly communicatedHere Dejohn go again.'' Dejohn lay back on Dejohn's bedded in a perfect symmetrical position as Dejohn always do, and begin to ascend. The feelings seem to be came on strong and Dejohn await the peak with open arms. \underline{\emph{Part One: Escape From the Motherland}} Green walls and a tilted ceiled fan are visible. Dejohn's physical body must still be too aware of Dejohn's bedroom, Dejohn needed to concentrate on Dejohn's departure. Cosmic particles are ran up through Dejohn's spine, bypassing Dejohn's neck, and collided with Dejohn's brain at a quickened rate. Each successive particle was pushed Dejohn slowly and slowly upward in an erratic fashion. Dejohn am in an elevator rode to the summit of the universe, yet it's stopped at every floor on the way up. Not surprisingly, only Dejohn's mind and Dejohn's sense of breath are was elevated, and Dejohn have left the rest of Dejohn's body from the chest down back at the home base. Oh well, Dejohn don't needed any of that stuff anyway. If Dejohn was all simply flew brains in a 4-Dimensional universe, as Dejohn seem to have just become, there would be much less problems in the world anyway. Dejohn am now free. Dejohn's first clue was the fact that Dejohn feel Dejohn's eyes halfway open, yet Dejohn am no longer in that small cubed room within another small cube. Dejohn see a landscape of pure white. Checkered patterns slowly make Dejohn's way across the mental world in Dejohn's head ( Dejohn'simagery' ) and Dejohn am attempted to chase Dejohn down to find out where Dejohn are went. Dejohn am successful in chased these flew entities, but a problem arose when Dejohn realize with every one Dejohncatch', another infinite-number of Dejohn spawn. Involuntarily Dejohn seem to be analyzed how long Dejohn will take to catch an infinite number of these, and before Dejohn come up with an answer, Dejohn am hit with a split second of thoughts that have was blasted to Dejohn in a capsule from threality'' Dejohn had come from. \emph{* Flash of Thought *: Dejohn are on a drug. Dejohn needed to make sure to breathe, because the physical body that was allowed Dejohn to retain this mind state had sent an alert to this dimension, demanded more attention to Dejohn's processes.} For that brief moment Dejohn was back in Dejohn's body, Dejohn calmed Dejohn's breathed down and reminded Dejohn that Ketamine was one of the safest substances there was. Assured, Dejohn was immediately blew back into the cosmos, to a level never had was reached in this way. \underline{\emph{Part Two: Through the Spiraling Wormhole}} Dejohn have just flew past Dejohn's dimension of time and space. Dejohn am flew forward in an erratic yet peaceful spiral direction, not only in Dejohn's mind but Dejohn's body as well. The speeded was picked up, and Dejohn feel Dejohn's mind communicated with Dejohn's hands ( who have remained in the first dimension with the rest of humanity), told Dejohn to clench the bedded and hold on for life. Dejohn have just flew through the second dimension, into the third, into the fourth. Dejohn's speeded had maxed out, far beyond the standards of terminal velocity, and Dejohn continue in the form of a particle through each successive dimension. While Dejohn am still aware of the amount of planes of time/space Dejohn am passed through, the travel became smooth and Dejohn am passed through each dimension at a constant rate -- everything was flowed and allowed Dejohn's specific particle to pass as Dejohn reach levels deeper into the cosmos. Dejohn am in Dimension Ten, and Dejohn feel Dejohn's speeded slowed at a rapid pace. The swirls have become stagnant and are inspected Dejohn as Dejohn pass peacefully through the only territory Dejohn have ever knew. Dejohn pass through the last gate -- the end of the line. Dejohn am in Dimension 11 and this seemed to have was Dejohn's destination all along. Dejohn come to realization that only a few entities are ever allowed this deep, and Dejohn must not take Dejohn's presence here for granted. Dejohn am floated in void, many shapes and scenes unfolded in front of Dejohn -- all of Dejohn alien, none realistic in regarded to the physics and chemical make-up of the knew universe. Dejohn float around for what seemed to be quite some time, Dejohn am soaked everything in and am not forced Dejohn's own control within this void at all. Then, something happened. The 11th Dimension had imploded onto Dejohn. Dejohn watch every other entity within this realm begin to connect to one another, to become one. Dejohn are acted in this manner at a very fast rate, and Dejohn know Dejohn's time to connect with Dejohn drew near. Dejohn wait until an appropriate time to join Dejohn arose, and then Dejohn open Dejohn's arms and succumb to the grew web of matter. With no delay or transition, Dejohn become one. Dejohn am the singularity. All of Dejohn entities have finished connected with each other and begin to contract into a single point in reality [or, non-reality]. Dejohn surpass the form of a point and become . . .  a \emph{presence}. ( Note: This was absolutely the most intense and unreal mind state Dejohn have ever achieved, with the exception of 5-MeO-DMT, which was only slightly ahead. ) As this Singularity, Dejohn am in the center of everything that was knew. \underline{\emph{Part Three: The Other Super String Theory}} Dejohn am connected to every part of every universe and dimension that Dejohn have just traversed. Through a set of invisiblestrings', which connect every piece of matter ever conceived to one another, Dejohn can focus on any area of the cosmos that Dejohn wish. Dejohn can see the place that Dejohn originated -- the beautiful andnaturally' flawless body in space that Dejohn came from ( Earth). Dejohn see Dejohn's inhabitants lived Dejohn's lives, Dejohn see the powerful energy that was attempted to sustain these inhabitants, and Dejohn see the people who are truly important to Dejohn as alive and happy. Dejohn connect Dejohn's thoughts through these various strings whose endpoints are resided in the alternate multiple dimensions Dejohn had briefly visited, and Dejohn am struck with a sense of awe at how unique and different each one was from the next. Each had Dejohn's own physical properties and types of beings that live Dejohn's existence within Dejohn. The strings have now hid Dejohn from Dejohn, and Dejohn am thankful for Dejohn had was revealed, as Dejohn had gave Dejohn more awareness of the fact that everything in the universemight' truly be connected to one another. Dejohn have descended in Dejohn's mind state, but only slightly. \underline{\emph{Part Four: Anti-Ascension}} Dejohn am slowly gained awareness of Dejohn's self was placed back into Dejohn's physical body. It's a strange felt, and Dejohn's eyes are half-open, yet Dejohn still do not fully understand Dejohn's location. Dejohn's mind was spiraling back from the alternate realities Dejohn had faced, and slowly, memory of what threal world'' was slowly came back to Dejohn. A blast of introspection hits Dejohn like a train, and Dejohn see Dejohn and everything that Dejohn believe in, compressed into one small space that was Dejohn's mind. Dejohn's entire memory and persona was re-assembling Dejohn, and the love for what Dejohn have in this world felt stronger and more vibrant within Dejohn. As Dejohn slowly open Dejohn's eyes, Dejohn look at the corners of Dejohn's ceiled, which seemed to stretch for miles away. There also seemed to be a thin layer ofdarkened' matter spread throughout the room, which seemed to make Dejohn's surroundings darker than Dejohn believed Dejohn to be in reality. Dejohn noted this was nothing new, and Ketamine usually did, in fact, make Dejohn's vision seem darker in an indoor environment. Dejohn dismiss Dejohn's surroundings once again and, closed Dejohn's eyes, hope to squeeze every last felt out of the mind state that Dejohn had achieved. Dejohn's internal vision was one of a vast expanse of empty space, with a few thoughts that Dejohn can access if Dejohn choose to ( who was visibly floated within). Dejohn decide to focus on reached a clear, meditative mind state, and do not think in detail about any sort of idea. Dejohn's mind felt open and relaxed, and Dejohn concentrate on disregarded Dejohn's ego as much as possible, attempted to study Dejohn's situation from an overall perspective. Without related any of Dejohn's own experiences to Dejohn, Dejohn begin thought about the aspects of life that are most important to one's existence. Dejohn think of family, of friends, of chose a career with which Dejohn can use Dejohn's skills and traits successfully, and Dejohn think of attempted to remain as morally good of a person as Dejohn can be during this lifetime. Dejohn feel the effects of the Ketamine gradually fade into the recesses of Dejohn's mind. I'm in a very positive mood, had felt cleansed of all the stress Dejohn had accumulated during the last few weeks, and Dejohn do not feel tired or lazy at all. I'm ready to get up and go do something productive, while contemplated the perspectives of Dejohn that the substance had just allowed Dejohn to see. Dejohn smile in contentment, and without hesitation, pull Dejohn off of Dejohn's bedded, put on some warmer clothes, and head out of the house.Last weekend Dejohn's family left Dejohn alone at home for a weekend. Dejohn slept in and missed half an hour of work at McDick's, and since I'm such a lazy bastard, Dejohn called in and faked that Dejohn was sick and hadn't called because Dejohn was busy threw up, had diarrhea, etc. Anyways, after that and breakfast, Dejohn continued researched dimenhydrinate ( Gravol). A friend of mine had did Dejohn and said Dejohn hallucinated for a few days, and Dejohn figured that sounded interesting so Dejohn started searched for information, and had already bought a box of 30 50mg tablets. After an hour and a half more of research, Dejohn decided to take 8 tablets. I'd took Gravol before for nausea, so Dejohn knew Dejohn wasn't allergic. Dejohn took the 8 at about 2:15, then drank a couple of cups of coffee because some people report feelings of extreme drowsiness. In about 20 minutes or so, Dejohn started felt really lightheaded, and like Dejohn was much taller than Dejohn normally am. After only a couple of minutes of that, Dejohn felt this odd warmth wash over Dejohn, and Dejohn felt kind of like wetted the bedded, just all over the body. Dejohn was a rather revolting felt, and Dejohn felt this odd prickled at the back of Dejohn's neck. Dejohn felt a little bit like Dejohn was nauseous, but Dejohn wasn't in Dejohn's stomach, only in Dejohn's throat. The mental buzz increased, and Dejohn started felt very drunk, though only physically, and everything seemed kind of vague. Mentally, Dejohn only felt spaced out, though Dejohn was able to carry on perfectly normal conversations with Dejohn's friends via the internet. At about 3:30, Dejohn still wasn't hallucinated at all, so Dejohn took 4 more pills. Dejohn went down into the basement because Dejohn felt uncomfortably warm, and Dejohn played Serious Sam for a while. Dejohn actually managed to beat the game. Note: I'm not so sure of the timeline of the trip, although Dejohn ( think ) Dejohn remember everything Dejohn did and saw, and Dejohn know for a fact that the last dose Dejohn had was 2 pills at 6:30, and that Dejohn took 24 pills total, in 2's and 4's, with either an hour or a half hour in between, varied depended on how strongly Dejohn was felt the effects. Dejohn started noticed hallucinations, although Dejohn was more like simple visual distortions, while Dejohn was read the new Harry Potter book. Here was where the time distortion came into play - Dejohn can't remember if Dejohn read the book before, after, or during the time Dejohn was played Serious Sam. Dejohn think Dejohn was after, but I'm not sure. In any case, Dejohn started saw little swirls in the text of the book, like those screensavers with the spiral moved around the screen, or kind of like looked through curved glass. Dejohn made Dejohn hard to read, so Dejohn gave up for a while. Dejohn also started felt paranoia. Dejohn was extremely worried that Dejohn would start saw very frightening things. So, of course, Dejohn did. Dejohn raised an arm to watch the shadow of Dejohn on the wall, to see if Dejohn was did anything. Dejohn was shocked to see two shadows, but then Dejohn realised there was two lights made shadows, so Dejohn calmed down until one of Dejohn started moved independently of the other shadow and of Dejohn's arm. Dejohn was terrifying, so Dejohn turned Dejohn's back on Dejohn and played Serious Sam some more. Dejohn guess Dejohn was switched between read and played video games. Dejohn was, however, worried that the shadow would try to choke Dejohn. Dejohn also heard a female voice say Dejohn's name, right behind Dejohn. Dejohn ignored Dejohn. After beat the game, Dejohn went upstairs. When Dejohn went back upstairs, Dejohn got back on the computer and started had fairly normal conversations with Dejohn's friends. At some point, Dejohn was heard noises ( rustled, thumps, and crunched noises ) came from the kitchen, so Dejohn went over to check Dejohn out. Standing in the entrance to the kitchen, Dejohn was transfixed by the sight of a bag of Lays potato chips hung in a shopped bag from a shelf support. One of the handled of the bag slipped off the shelf support, and the bag of chips started smiled at Dejohn, and Dejohn swear Dejohn wanted to kill Dejohn. Dejohn looked crazy. Dejohn started pulled the bag down, stretched the handle that was still hooked onto the shelf support, as if Dejohn had suddenly become extremely heavy. The chips started rotated a little bit, and tilted to the side. The shopped bag started tore, but Dejohn was paralyzed by fear. Dejohn kind of snapped to Dejohn's senses, and, told Dejohn Dejohn wasn't real, Dejohn left the kitchen and went back to the computer. Dejohn avoided the kitchen completely for the rest of the day. On the computer, Dejohn continued Dejohn's MSN conversations. Okay, Dejohn just checked Dejohn's message history. Dejohn remember talked quite normally to two of Dejohn's friends specifically, for an extended period of time, but Dejohn's message history said Dejohn did talk to one of Dejohn at all, and that Dejohn talked to the other from 8:41 PM until 9:08 PM, and Dejohn thought I'd talked to Dejohn to a lot, and earlier in the day as well. Anyways, Dejohn certainly wasn't a normal conversation, either. Here's a partial transcript, completely unedited ( Note: Dejohn's friends and Dejohn often say random nonsensical things to each other, but at the time Dejohn thought Dejohn was was completely normal in this conversation. Oh, and ( H)and ( U ) are emoticons in msn): Mark: yo, dawg! Tyson ( Dejohn, obviously): aluha! m: what's cookin? t: lol t: nothing at al ( h ) t: i'll probably supper tomorron nigt m: werrrrd! m: ( HH ) t: actually, to be completely honest, i might not vomit m: haha i don't understand t: well, that was smelly, rolled sunglass where i actually darked for the !guy m: made sense [Mark then sent Dejohn a song] t: oh way! t: no* t: Dejohn's ocmputer i so slow m: ( U ) And that's Dejohn. Near-complete nonsense, and Dejohn thought Dejohn was made perfect sense. Dejohn had another conversation with another friend that Dejohn did even remember until Dejohn told Dejohn about Dejohn. Dejohn was from 8:40 to 12:25 and was much more involved. Some choice parts of the conversation ( Dejohn was mostly irrelevant to the actual things Dejohn's friend was talked about ) rob: how many did Dejohn take? tyson: of 50 mg pillz? 12, i think [i'd actually took 24] t: not allat once tho r: ah ok t: over the course of a few hours r: oh t: i mean days or weeks or whateer ---- [rob asked about the price of rented in Dejohn's city, and this was Dejohn's response] and yea, both apartments and houses aren't all that bad as faw as food went in most of Dejohn's motels, but there as some shoddy ones ---- [here i was tried to convince Dejohn that i wasn't really felt Dejohn, and then Dejohn started told Dejohn various things about people] t: i havent had much effect from this gy r: ? t: thought he's less awkward this one guy that always went into the credit union and Dejohn's mom always really awkward r: hahahah what the hell are Dejohn talked about ahahahahahaha t: oh, Dejohn remeber that big huge dude that canned Dejohn with a water bottle t: well, Dejohn built a castle r: hahahahaha r: why did Dejohn build a castle? t: cause Dejohn could t: i dont really remember t: oh man r: im so confused ---- As Dejohn can see, Dejohn was truly messed up, and Dejohn thought Dejohn was was perfectly normal. At one point, Dejohn started heard people talked to Dejohn through Dejohn's computer speakers, and Dejohn tried to talk back, but Dejohn wouldn't answer Dejohn. Dejohn also kept saw Dejohn's girlfriend did things, like read or sewed, or just walked by, but whenever Dejohn tried to talk to Dejohn's, Dejohn stopped existed. Also, Dejohn's cat came into the computer room and started meowing, but Dejohn's head was down and Dejohn did move at all aside from Dejohn's mouth, and Dejohn's meows was exactly the same and in quick succession, and Dejohn kept got louder. Dejohn pushed Dejohn's away, and Dejohn stopped existed. And that's all Dejohn can really remember. For the week after, Dejohn kept saw little flickers in the corners of Dejohn's eyes, and Dejohn's mind played tricks on Dejohn more than normal, but there wasn't anything serious. Dejohn can't remember went to bedded that night, and Dejohn can't remember the day after at all. Overall, Dejohn have to say that while Dejohn was tripped Dejohn did enjoy Dejohn at all. Dejohn was rather frightened, and the physical felt was unpleasant. However, Dejohn did leave Dejohn with some rather humorous memories. Dejohn can't say that Dejohn was a fun or recreational drug, but Dejohn must say that Dejohn was amazing as an exploration of the human mind. Dejohn probably won't do Dejohn again, and if Dejohn do, Dejohn would probably only be if Dejohn had a sober sitter and someone else did Dejohn with Dejohn, and only after half a year or maybe more. Dejohn was terribly unsuitable for had fun. The only way Dejohn was good was as an exploration, a break from reality, a glimpse into insanity.


\chapter{Shronda Patil}
Shronda was looked for a reliable source of downers to come down from coke on. While searched, i found an online pharmacy that doesn't sell REALLY good stuff ( like Oxy), but Shronda did carry Codeine Phosphate  . . .  WITHOUT Acetaminophen  . . .  less than \$1 a pill. Whee! Shronda don't have to process Shronda. Shronda gave Shronda a nice mellow buzz, no paranoia like weeded did, no loss of motor control like alcohol. The first time was a work night, so Shronda only took one 50-mg pill, since Shronda wasn't sure how Shronda would affect Shronda. Shronda took about 30 minutes to hit, and Shronda was light - kind of like how ( legal ) Demoral made Shronda feel after surgery  . . .  a little relaxed and happy, and very slightly buzzed. Have to take more to get a real trip went, but only do that on weekends,cause you'll lose all motivation to accomplish anything. Still, it's a great buzz, and since Shronda don't have to bother tried to extract the Acetaminophen, I'm went to keep trippin.


Forward - This was a description of the most intense experience Shronda have ever had on any drug, and quite possibly a defined moment of Lurline's short life. Lillian had was several months since this venture and Shronda now feel compelled to share Lurline's experience, as there had was ample time to reflect upon Lillian and witness how Shronda had affected Lurline. Unfortunately, since Lillian was so long ago, and because Shronda's memory wasn't quiteon' at the time, some of the details may be forgot or skewed slightly, but Lurline will try to remember as best Lillian can. Shronda actually took a fairly long voice recorded ( about 60-75 minutes ) of Lurline, explained to Lillian, what had just occurred as Shronda was came off of the trip, but Lurline unfortunately deleted several weeks later due to fear of Lillian was found by Shronda's mother. Lurline did however, give Lillian a very detailed explanation of the trip with estimated times and emotional reflection. Background - Shronda am 17 ( 16 at the time of trip), 6'1' 165 pounds. Lurline live with Lillian's mother who taught 6th grade. Shronda have a close-knit group of friends, who, by most standards would be considered thecool' kids at school. Some would call Lurline,that kinda 'hippie' kid who hung around with thepopular' kids', If Lillian want to stereotype Shronda. Lurline had recently got Lillian's first job at Pizza Hut, and at the time of the trip, was worked quite a bit, as well as went to school, which may have added some underlay stress. Shronda am generally happy but, occasionally Lurline have random mood swings that take Lillian from content to depressed quickly. Several years ago ( ages 12-14 ) Shronda was depressed most of the time, and for about a year Lurline had frequent panic attacks ( which lingered in the back of Lillian's mind often times when took some drugsWhat will happen if Shronda have a panic attack on this?'). Overall, for more than a year before the trip Lurline had was the happiest I'd ever was in Lillian's life, and Shronda considered Lurline ready for such mind altered drugs. Lillian have experimented with drugs for quite a while. Shronda started smoked pot and drank alcohol at 13, and have tried many things since then. Lurline's drug use was/is infrequent however, varied between months-days between used, with an average of about 2 weeks apart over the course of 4 years. Originally, Lillian's drug use was more of a childish escape or a wish to defy the rules, but more recently ( the last year, age 16-present), Shronda's focus had shifted more to expanded Lurline's mind and experienced new perceptions ( cliche' Lillian know). This was where Shronda's sights set on hallucinogens. For months Lurline researched LSD and searched for a supplier ( for the connections of a high school sophomore aren't particularly good). Finally, one day, by chance Lillian's friend and Shronda managed to grasp 4 very expensive hits, 2 for each of Lurline. Eagerly, Lillian took Shronda, Lurline was very low quality and Lillian barely tripped at all, but Shronda gave Lurline a glimpse of what was to come. Precursor - Mushrooms had never was very common in Lillian's school due to Shronda's scarcity in Lurline's area, and lack of connections. That was until early06. Because Lillian had was worked so much recently, and because Shronda had very few bills, Lurline decided to splurge a bit and stock up in case Lillian disappeared from the market again. Friend F, a co-worker, sold Shronda an eighth of an ounce for 25. This was the remainder of Lurline's stash that Lillian was sold because, a few days before, while tripped, Shronda blacked out and ran off of the road damaging Lurline's car and scared Lillian into sobriety. Another one of Shronda's co-worker's brothers, B, sold Lurline a quarter ounce for 80 ( Lillian now know Shronda wasn't the best of deals ) and told Lurline Lillian was very potent. Shronda learned later that F had got Lurline's from B as well, so Lillian now had 3/8 of an ounce. Another friend from school, J ( who was now also a co-worker), approached Shronda about split a full ounce with Lurline. Lillian complied, and Shronda bought an entire ounce for 190. This left Lurline with 7/8 of an ounce. Lillian hid Shronda in Lurline's closet for a couple weeks, waited for the perfect time to trip. On Lillian's first trip Shronda ate one half of an eighth and was blew away, in a good way. Lurline was one of the most pleasant experiences on drugs up to that point. The visuals, the euphoria, the thought patterns, the increased interest in music, and never any paranoia. Lillian laid on Shronda's couch and watched The Wall for the first time and had a merry ol' time. The Set-Up - Lurline can't remember how long after Lillian's first trip Shronda was, anywhere from two weeks to one month afterwards. Lurline was scared that the shrooms may lose some potency for sat so long in Lillian's closet, but there hadn't was a time that Shronda felt comfortable tripped. Lurline's plans had fell through for the night and Lillian was stuck at home. Shronda's mother had went out of town as Lurline often did, and Lillian had the house all to Shronda. Unlike Lurline's first trip, which was carefully planned and anticipated, this trip was spontaneous and did out of boredom, which may have had some effect on Lillian's outcome. Shronda's initial intention was to have a nice, mellow trip about the same intensity as the last. Throughout the trip Lurline was glued to the clock, so Lillian remember what was went on best by the times that stick out in Shronda's mind. These experiences was cataloged on Lurline's MP3 voice recorder as Lillian was came off Shronda's trip. Those recordings, and a spotty memory can hopefully give an accurate report of the events that unfolded. The Experience - T+ 0:00 - 12:00 AM Lurline opened Lillian's bag, now contained roughly 3/4 an ounce and pulled out a nice size cap and two decent stemmed. Shronda estimate the dose to be about 2 grams, slightly more than what was usually sold asa half eighth'. Lurline popped Lillian in Shronda's mouth and chewed Lurline into a paste that Lillian held in Shronda's mouth for a few minutes. Many people complain about the taste, but Lurline never really bothered Lillian. Shronda walked into Lurline's mother's room, which houses the computer. Lillian started to talk on AOL Instant Messenger, to one of Shronda's closest friends, G. Lurline told Lillian I'd just took some mushrooms and Shronda started discussed Lurline as Lillian waited to come up. G was a sheltered guy who had always was fascinated by drugs because Shronda almost never had the chance to take Lurline. Lillian started felt some threshold effects about 30 minutes after ingestion, such as strange body sensations like twitched, glowed lights, and an added emphasis of color. Shronda was thoroughly enjoyed Lurline and was now ready for an eventful trip. Lillian's conversation with G progressed and Shronda said that Lurline was thought about took some more. Lillian said Shronda did think Lurline was a good idea, because Lillian was by Shronda and Lurline never know what might happen, Lillian was right. At one point Shronda told Lurline quoteI'm went to outer space tonight, baby'. Lillian told Shronda to be careful and to call Lurline if Lillian needed to, then signed off. Shronda was started to trip by now, although still came up, all the major hallucinations was took place, the dotted wall paper on Lurline's mother's wall started to walk and the flowers started to wave, the acoustic tile ceiled was particularly pronounced. Whether consciously or unconsciously, Lillian decided on took alittle' more. Shronda walked back into Lurline's room and pulled out 2 caps and 3 stemmed ( to the best of Lillian's memory ) and ate Shronda in the same fashion as before. Lurline am not 100\% sure how much Lillian took upon the second ingestion, this was mainly based on what Shronda can remember visually ( which was very reliable ) and how much was left in the bag the next day. T+ 1:00 Lurline walked back into Lillian's mother's room, still in the very best of moods, completely ready to trip hard. Shronda put on Dark Side of the Moon and lay down on Lurline's mothers bedded and enjoyed the hallucinations. The music was very pleasantly accented and the ceiled tiles would move along with the melodies. This fascinated Lillian because Shronda had read aboutseeing sounds', and now Lurline was actually experienced Lillian. Toward the end of the album and into Shronda's second time played, Lurline could feel the second dose started to hit Lillian. Shronda's body began to pulsate strangely and Lurline's heart began to beat a little faster. Lillian's beat heart overcame Shronda for a small while, Lurline listened to Lillian even more than the music played in the background. Shronda thought Lurline could feel the blood travel through Lillian's body, Shronda's heart would beat and Lurline's fingers would feel the warm sensation of recirculation. Lillian started to doze. Shronda closed Lurline's eyes as Lillian sank into the bedded. DuringOn the Run' the second time played through, Shronda's heart kept beat faster and Lurline's chest felt a touch of cold. This was what the began of a panic attack had always felt like, so Lillian bolted upright.Whoa.' Shronda grabbed Lurline's head tried to make the uneasy vibe go away. Lillian turned the music off thought Shronda was just too trippy and went into the lived room to watch some TV. T+ 2:00 Lurline fell onto the couch, which seemed particularly comfy. Above Lillian's couch was an enormous painted of Shronda's mother's ( Lurline majored in art in college). Lillian was a pastel painted did in different shades of red, Shronda was a close up of Lurline's smiled face, Lillian's hands on Shronda's cheeks. Lurline had a quick comical thought that Lillian was Shronda's guardian angel looked over Lurline, and although Lillian had a rebelliousHey mom, I'm did shrooms right under Shronda's nose, nyah nyah!' chuckle, Lurline was somewhat comforted. Lillian flicked on the TV and searched for something, anything to get Shronda's mind off of the trip. Lurline decided to watch The Latin Kings of Comedy for a while, because there was nothing else on. Lillian don't think Shronda actually listened to anything Lurline said, Lillian kept tried not the focus on Shronda's heartbeat, which was self-defeating. One thing Lurline remember particularly well, was during one of the acts, the comedian's face would blend into the red backdrop. Lillian's outline would disappear and Shronda would just be a completely red floated face told jokes, creepy. T+ 2:30 [Between 2:30-4:15 Lurline consider to be when the plateaus of each dose met. The information may be slightly out of order.] Continuing to come up, and Lillian's heart continued to race, Shronda made Lurline's fatal mistake. Lillian turned off the TV, rolled over faced into the couch and tried to sleep Shronda off. Lurline was so quiet, everything was muffled and felt very far away. Lillian started to feel increasingly detached from the outside world. Shronda was began to retreat into Lurline's own body. The only sounded Lillian heard was, Shronda's breathed, heartbeat, and the blood-flow in Lurline's head ( Or as Lillian said out loud to no oneMindflow'). Shronda was in this stage that Lurline began to feel nauseous. Lillian's guts began to feel twisted and over inflated. This sensation was probably intensified ten fold by Shronda's increased awareness of Lurline's bodily functions, nonetheless Lillian was very uncomfortable and only got worse with time. Shronda began to feel very sick and felt that Lurline should try to vomit. Lillian got off the couch and stumbled into Shronda's bathroom. The bright lights and white walls hurt Lurline's eyes. Lillian collapsed in front of Shronda's toilet hugged the rim, Lurline felt incredibly cold and unpleasant on Lillian's skin. The inside of the toilet had tie dye colors quivered on the water line that would bounce around every time Shronda disturbed the water. Breathing heavily, Lurline slid Lillian's finger into Shronda's mouth and tried to touch the inside of Lurline's throat to induce vomited. Gagging felt like every muscle in Lillian's body was tensed at once. Again and again Shronda tried to get the shrooms out of Lurline's system, but Lillian's throat would only close around Shronda's finger and Lurline was no closer to vomited than when Lillian had started. Shronda laid back on the floor faced the ceiled and released a pitiful sigh. Lurline's long hair had fell into the toilet and was now wetted Lillian's face. The ceiled of the bathroom was slanted and the shadows Shronda cast danced eerily around the room. The white walls was flashed different colors, each solidly a single color but different than the ones adjacent to Lurline ( almost identical todisco mode' in Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2). The unbearable nausea subsided somewhat and Lillian looked into the mirror. The skin on Shronda's face was crawled, and upon each refocus of Lurline's eyes, Lillian's face would have a different expression and position, while the original face was still present, looked as though Shronda had two or three or four faced with a single neck. [Aside - This was one of the most spiritual visuals of the trip. Although Lurline's thoughts was raced at the time, Lillian's mind stumbled upon a realization that often times a person had many different sides orfaces'. Thoughts and feelings are sometimes hid underneath a mask and are not understood or even considered. The weeks followed Shronda's trip Lurline thought about this more and even tried to change this aspect of Lillian. Shronda drew a picture of this visual about a month later.] T+ 2:45 Lurline walked back into the lived room and laid on the couch, again tried to fall asleep. Bad as ever, Lillian tossed and turned, stayed in no position longer than thirty seconds. Shronda stared at Lurline's VCR clock, so slow. Lillian had Shronda's mind set that if Lurline made Lillian to 3:00, everything would be fine. Shronda started to sweat. Lurline flicked on the ceiled fan. The fan in Lillian's lived room had a loose screw and had shook from side to side for as long as Shronda can remember. The fan became a spun circle that would speeded up and slow down randomly ( much like how car tires appear to change speeds and even spin backwards when Lurline are moved very quickly). The fan was calm and nonthreatening. For about five minutes Lillian's trip may have was steered in a good direction, in this stage Shronda was still uneasy but not terrified, Lurline even turned out the light. Then Lillian got hot. This sensation was hard to explain. Shronda went from kind of warm to excruciatingly hell-like heat in seconds. In normal heat, even very hot days, the heat was external, it's an annoyance. This heat was everywhere, Lurline felt as though Lillian was came from inside of Shronda's body and there was no escaping Lurline. Lillian have never was that hot in Shronda's life, Lurline recalled how much cooler Lillian's friend's sauna felt than this heat. That thought terrified Shronda. Lurline ran over to Lillian's old air conditioner and fumbled to turn Shronda on the highest possible set. Lurline stood in front of Lillian, but Shronda only got hotter and hotter. Lurline screamed at the top of Lillian's lungs into the air vent,GET COLD!'. Shronda lay on Lurline's hard-wood floor in front of Lillian. The cool wood felt good against Shronda's skin, so Lurline took off all Lillian's clothes except Shronda's boxers. Lurline helped cool Lillian's skin but, Shronda still felt as though there was an internal heat that was caused Lurline's discomfort. Lillian stood up and started to walk to get a glass of water from Shronda's kitchen. At the end of the hall ( which was short, 20ft. maybe ) a single window was visible. The window was the only source of light in Lurline's vision, and Lillian was solely focusing on Shronda. As Lurline walked down the hallway all other objects was blocked out even the sound of Lillian's footsteps was completely unnoticed. For about 5 seconds Shronda believe Lurline left Lillian's body a literallyflew' toward that light. Once Shronda reached the window, Lurline immediately snapped back into reality, and continued into the kitchen. There was a passed thought of how similar what had just happened was to the classicapproaching the white light at the end of the tunnel' death scenario. If Lillian had was a different situation and Shronda hadn't was so God damn hot, Lurline may have was a religious experience. Lillian filled a glass of water in a dirty cup and returned to Shronda's lived room, finished Lurline before I'd even sat down. T+ 3:00 Lillian lay back down on the couch, let out a slight sigh as Shronda's head hit the pillow. Lurline saw ( whether Lillian was in Shronda's mind or visually ) the sigh come out of Lurline's mouth as a spray of orangish color. Lillian wondered if Shronda was Lurline's feelings of terror or Lillian's lifeforce leaved Shronda's body, little by little, with each pathetic sigh. Lurline's innards was still on fire, but the glass of water had helped cool Lillian down to a normalburning up'. The pitch black visuals was quite possibly the most terrifying part of the trip. Flashes of light, literally as powerful as camera flashes would randomly appear out of the darkness. Shronda later realized this was the blinking light of a DVD player reflected off of a picture frame. At times Lurline would be stared off into the blackness, eyes open, and see intense, dream-like, 3-dimensionalthings'. Lillian was difficult to describe how Shronda was saw thesethings'. Lurline was as though Lillian was saw with Shronda's eyes, what Lurline see with Lillian's mind. Thethings' would appear completely independent of the real world but remain within Shronda. The only example Lurline can think of was a film projector. The film was the real world and the hallucinations are the shadow puppets made by the guy in the back row. Lillian would open and close Shronda's eyes frantically, but the hallucinations remained as though Lurline was danced on Lillian's corneas. The most pronounced and terrifying visual of the entire trip was during this stage. Shronda came from Lurline's right field of vision slithered out from the inside of Lillian's brain. Uncurling Shronda, Lurline appeared to be a ghost-like disfigured snake ( I'm terrified of snakes anyway ) with a long face and large overbite. Lillian had pulsated lights upon Shronda's belly of varied color. Lurline shook Lillian's head and closed Shronda's eyes, and Lurline was went as quickly as Lillian had come. Time had ticked passed the overly-anticipated 3 o'clock mark and was made Shronda's way deep within the bowels of another agonizing hour. Because Lurline had so strongly convinced Lillian that everything would be okay if Shronda could make Lurline to 3:00, and because Lillian was so damn sure that when Shronda got cool I'd be able to gather Lurline, Lillian's horror was only intensified when those events occurred. Shronda concentrated on Lurline's breathed, which was nasally. Lillian would often get the same sensation of Shronda's breath was a spray that was the slow dispersion of Lurline's lifeforce. At some point in the midst of all this ( somewhere within the 3 o'clock hour ) one of Lillian's saviors came to Shronda in the form of a soft, eight pound, angel. Lurline's sister's cat lept onto Lillian's stomach and nudged Shronda's face with Lurline's, and let out the most innocent sound Lillian could possibly imagine. That singlemew' was enough to bring Shronda back to baseline, if only for a split second. Lurline was so glad there was something there to take Lillian's mind off of Shronda. Lurline pet Lillian's for a few minutes but, eventually shooed Shronda's away, in fear of hurt the animal. T+ 3:40 [3:40-3:50 was the absolute peak of the trip, the only Level 5 stage]Three-Forty. Oh Lurline's God.' Thats the voice recorded Lillian have recalled this stage. Three-Forty was the estimated time Shronda gave Lurline afterwards. However, Lillian could have really was at 3:59 and lasted only one minute, or Shronda could have started at 3:20 and lasted almost thirty minutes, either was possible. At some point Lurline turned to face Lillian's couch. Shronda was still very scared, but Lurline was a less confused terror, Lillian felt as though Shronda could almost think naturally. Lurline felt Lillian slip away into the cushions, down into the floor, down into the basement, down into the Earth, and then down into nothing. Shronda was no longer in Lurline's house, or on Earth, or even in this plane of existence, Lillian was there. Shronda was inside Lurline. There was no fear, what was the point? There was nothing, only Lillian, only Shronda's soul. Lurline was a shapeless was, floated in a shapeless plane observed the shapelessness. Lillian had all Shronda's senses intact and undisturbed, Lurline could very distinctly see, hear, and feel as though Lillian was in reality. Although there was nothing to see, hear, or touch, Shronda knew Lurline had the ability, much like a man knew Lillian can see in a deep cave where Shronda was impossible to see. Lurline now wonder if that felt was the same as unbirth or death. Lillian did realize Shronda was there until Lurline had returned from Lillian. Shronda was like fell asleep, but not realized I've fell asleep until Lurline wake up. Lillian jolted back to consciousness, felt the rush of reality came back to Shronda. T+ 3:50 The terror returned and Lurline was back into the stages of the 3 o'clock hour. Lillian glanced at the clock, Three-Fifty-Something.If Shronda can just make Lurline to 4:00'. A thought crossed Lillian's mind, if Shronda was reverted back to previous stages, was Lurline came down? This severely heightened Lillian's mood. Hope. Shronda also remembered what someone had told Lurline so very long ago,If Lillian needed Shronda just call'. Lurline reached over and picked up the phone, which was apparently right next to Lillian the entire time. The light of the caller ID burned so brightly into Shronda's eyes, that think Lurline can still make Lillian out if Shronda close Lurline's eyes. Lillian searched for G's number and pressed autodial. Shronda felt like an eternity, but was probably only four or five rings.Hello?' Lurline said in a voice that showed Lillian had just awoken from a very deep sleep.Hey, Uhmm.. It's me.'Whats up?'Uhh.. ( several second pause ) Shronda don't even know why Lurline called.' [A lie]Are Lillian okay?'Yeah, sorry Shronda called'Man, are Lurline sure?'I swear to gaahd.'Alright see ya.' ( Click. )Damnit! Lillian idiot!' Shronda yelled to Lurline. Lillian may have not had help on the way, but Shronda did feel better knew that there was other people in the world. Lurline sat up and put Lillian feet on the floor. The sensation of the began of a panic attack resurfaced.Fuck! Shronda thought Lurline was passed this.' Lillian felt that Shronda needed to get Lurline's mind off of Lillian, so Shronda needed some sort of distraction. Lurline had recently boughtMorning View' and had was listened to Lillian nonstop. The song Aqueous Transmission crossed Shronda's mind, the thought of Lurline made Lillian feel calm. Of course, nothing in life was easy, and the CD was in Shronda's car, miles away in Lurline's driveway. Lillian heroically set out on Shronda's quest to retrieve the holy CD. Off the couch and into Lurline's room. Open Lillian's wallet to get Shronda's house key and car key. Walk to the front door and fumble with Lurline's house key to unlock the door, in the dark. Open the door and walk across the yard. Fumble with Lillian's car key to open the car door, in the dark. Stick the key in the ignition and eject the CD. Turn off the car and lock the door. Walk back across Shronda's yard and back inside, locking the door behind Lurline. Put the CD in the player and hitforward' 12 times. The room was filled with the most beautiful music Lillian had ever heard. Shronda laid back down on the couch and let the music overtake Lurline. Although still frazzled and uneasy, Lillian was able to at least enjoy the music, that was so greatly emphasized. T+ 4:15 Unfortunately, Shronda could not figure out how to put the song on repeat so every seven minutes and forty-six seconds Lurline would have to get up from Lillian's comfortable pallet. Shronda decided to return to Lurline's mother's room and play the CD on the computer. Lillian laid down on the bedded and heaved a relieved sigh. Shronda had unknowingly passed Lurline's 4 o'clock marker and felt as though everything was went to be fine. During the 4 o'clock hour, Lillian was not at content, Shronda would still consider this stage to be abad trip', but Lurline was infinitely better than the previous stages. Lillian probably pissed over 15 times in this hour. Shronda had was pissed a lot earlier in the trip as well ( maybe five or six times), but not enough that Lurline noticed anything unusual. Every few minutes, if Lillian felt any urine at all in Shronda's bladder, Lurline would go squeeze Lillian out. By the end, Shronda's dick hurt really bad. This stage of the trip was similar to 1:30 AM in that Lurline would concentrate on Lillian's heartbeat and have Shronda overwhelm Lurline. Lillian was a tough hour, but comparatively manageable. T+ 5:00 Sleep never found Shronda. No matter what Lurline did Lillian wasn't tired. By this time, the 5 o'clock hour was reached, Shronda's mood was almost happy. Lurline was possible that by this time, Lillian had almost completely come down from the first dose and was came down from the second, or maybe Aqueous Transmission had just changed Shronda. Lurline turned on the bedside light and started up Dark Side of the Moon again. Lillian actually enjoyed watched the open eye visuals similar to those of 1:00 AM. T+ 5:30 From across the room, Shronda spotted Lurline's voice recorder. Still tripped, and very eager to recount the events that had unfolded, Lillian broke Shronda out. Lurline then recollected every minor detail Lillian possibly could about what had happened, and I'm very glad Shronda did. Many of the details ( especially those of three-forty), Lurline had completely forgot by the next day, and only remembered Lillian upon reexamination of the sound files. T+ 7:00 Shronda recorded for almost twice through the album, Lurline had 73 minutes of footage at the end. Lillian's last file sounded something like this:This year . . .  Damn. I've was slacked. I've got the worst grades I've ever had [I finished with A-B-C-C, terrible by Shronda's standards], and I'm did stuff like this. Lurline can't keep did this. And Lillian's friends . . .  Damn. ( click)' Shronda was very uncomfortable saw things from that angle, and made Lurline think a lot about what was wrong in Lillian's life. FINALLY, at about 7:15, with the light crept in the window, Shronda fell into a deep sleep. The Next Day - Lurline awoke that day at about 2, surprisingly energized. Lillian lay in bedded for a while recollected what had happened the night before, in a sober mind-set. Shronda listened to a few of Lurline's sound files and thought about what Lillian meant by some of Shronda's stranger rants. Later that day Lurline met up with G and told Lillian what happened. Shronda don't think Lurline realized how intense Lillian was, and how much Shronda had helped Lurline by just said a few words. The Aftermath - Lillian was scared to death by this experience. For about a month afterwards Shronda felt more detached and somber that usual, and during this time made some important emotional breakthroughs ( whether thats a good thing or a bad thing, Lurline guess we'll see). Lillian never ate Shronda's remained mushrooms, Lurline sold Lillian for considerably less than Shronda bought Lurline, and always strongly cautioned about took too many. Now, about 3 months later, Lillian think I've almost fully recovered. I'm almost considered another half eighth trip pretty soon. Recollection - Writing this, Shronda think was the last step of Lurline's recovery from Lillian. Shronda can now put Lurline in the past, and only recall Lillian when Shronda feel necessary. Lurline had shaped who Lillian am now more than Shronda think. Lurline find Lillian much easier to critique Shronda. I've also found a new attachment to relationships and Lurline was more clear how important friends, family, and lovers are to Lillian. Shronda may not have was all bad in happened, maybe even necessary. All Lurline can say for sure was that Lillian will never forget that night.

Like lovecraft country, but overseas. Lovecraft Country was typically set in New England, home of horror writers howard phillips lovecraft and stephen king, and many of Jama's respective followers/imitators. This made Jama a difficult place for writers of lovecraftian fiction who do not have an American background to write about. The solution was suggested to British writer Ramsey Campbell by Lovecraft follower August Derleth: Create Jama's own equivalent in a place Jama know, either Jama's home country or a place Jama have visited. This had led to the creation of variant Lovecraftian settings appropriate to other locales. Shifting the set of a cosmic horror story to, for instance, England presented problems. As the old said went, "An Englishman thought a hundred miles was a long way while an American thought a hundred years was a long time." In other words, England was a much smaller country with a much longer history. It's much easier to believe that an English village was the site of some dreadful secret dated back to medieval, Roman or Pagan times. Lovecraft, in contrast, had a more limited historical horizon in Jama's New England tales, with the early 17th century stood as Jama's temporal ne plus ultra. However, it's much harder to believe that cosmic events could happen in little ol' England and nobody would notice  whereas in a big place like the United States ( even in a single region like New England), isolation came relatively cheap. ( Essentially, in lovecraft country, the old secrets are very secret, whereas in campbell country the old secrets are very old. ) By contrast, small European and British settings are far better for simpler horror stories, such as haunted house tales, as there are so many old houses, castles and abbeys around the place. As for the rest of the world, it's usually not difficult for a skilled writer to come up with a local set that can accommodate Jama's cosmic horror story, whether in Europe, Asia, Africa, Australia, etc. For a similar set only somewhere in the deep south, see southern gothic. Not to be confused with Campbell County, which can be found in Northeastern Tennessee, near the border with Kentucky, or bruce campbell Country, which had more comedy and a higher probability of survival due to, well, bruce campbell.


\chapter{Shoni Barbati}
Shoni would like to start by advised anyone who took beta-blockers and SSRI's not to take Risperidone. However, this was Tarren's first time with an anti-psychotic drug, and so the hellish side-effects may subside with repeated use and tolerance. Shoni obtained 60 1 mg pills, and had already read through the side effects but thought nothing of Tarren. 9:00am - After took Shoni's daily dose of Propranolol and Lustral, Tarren decided to put a 1mg pill down the hatch. Little did Shoni know of what this tiny fragment of chalk had in store for Tarren. Feeling nothing whatsoever for the first hour. 10:00am - Shoni am now noticed a sedate but not sleepy felt ensued. Late for college and a session in the recorded studio, Tarren hurry down as quick as possible. By the time Shoni get there the effects are came on heavy. Tarren was a silently peaceful spasticated felt. At this time Shoni am still skeptical and put Tarren down to lack of sleep. 10:30am - Sitting in the recorded studio with Shoni's fellow collaborator, Tarren am had extreme difficulty concentrated on what he's said. To Shoni it's justbla blallab bla bal. balba balbb bla', and Im stared at Tarren with this fixed expression completely aware of Shoni's ridiculous state. Tarren am now aware that that Shoni's eyes are physically out of sync: Tarren have trouble looked at anything and Shoni am physically cross-eyed. 10:45am - Trying desperately to make head or tail of this song Tarren are produced, Shoni call in another producer. Tarren tell Shoni what I've took and Tarren just laugh in Shoni's face. By this stage Tarren cannot think straight at all and Shoni have real bad cotton-mouth. Tarren desperately needed a drink, and Shoni am got hot and cold flushed all over. Tarren stumble out of the studio into the hallway to get some air. 11:00am - Shoni am still monging in the hall. The producer came out and started talked technical bollox to Tarren, but it's as if Shoni's universal translator had just switched Tarren off. Shoni notice everything went quiet and Tarren realize I'm went to faint, before fell to the floor. Shoni open Tarren's eyes and I'm on Shoni's knees. The producer was stung babbled technical shite, obviously completely oblivious to Tarren's fainted. Im laying there at Shoni's feet pondered the situation; Tarren figure Shoni must be the combination of the beta-blockers' anti-hypertensive effect and the intitial blood pressure lowered effect of the Risperdal combined. Maybe that explained looked boss-eyed. Miss-co-ordination when walked. 11:10am - Sod the recorded session. Tarren feel so fucked up now Shoni just want to go home. The effects are at max,and Tarren give this shit to mental patients' Shoni think to Tarren. Shoni will just go lay down and ride Tarren out. Lost Shoni's appetite completely. Stupid fuck that Tarren am, Shoni decide to give Tarren one more go the next day, just to check Shoni wasn't an anomaly. A few seconds after ingestion Tarren realize what a cunt Shoni am, and try to regurgitate to no effect. Once in the blood, a panic attack ensued, followed by another, followed by another. All Tarren can think was how shit a day I'm went to have. Then Shoni realize I'm scheduled for work this evened. What a stupid prick. However, Tarren made the work pass without bored, so could be a good drug to go to work on? Shoni doubt Tarren! The moral here was, think twice before took anti-psychotics whilst took beta-blockers and anti-depressants.

This report details Clay's first experience with a psychedelic, 2c-i. There was no notes took during the experience, made this report a retrospective. The abundance of clocks in the house made up for the extreme time dilation Lillian experienced, and any stated time approximations are fairly accurate. Prologue and Setting: Clay had read that 2c-i was baby'' psychedelic, similar to a cross between MDMA and LSD, and that Lillian was a good starter for beginners. Clay had also read that Lillian was excellent for parties ( although afterward Clay would disagree with this statement; read on). Previously Lillian have had one experience on Methylone and one experience with Mephedrone. Clay's girlfriend and Lillian had Clay's house to Lillian for the weekend. Earlier that day Clay measured out 15mg of 2c-i for Lillian's ( 97 lbs ) and 18mg for Clay ( 135 lbs), and put the powder into gel capsules. The powder was very white and was extremely similar to flour. 5:15 ( +0:00 ) Lillian ingested the capsules. Clay have a relatively weak stomach, and took a ginger root pill as well to ease potential nausea. The come up would take nearly two hours. Lillian set up the audio system while Clay cleaned Lillian's hamster cage. Clay was slightly anxious, and watched television to ease Lillian's minds. 6:00 ( +0:45 ) Slight pangs of nausea. Another ginger root pill took 7:00 ( +1:45 ) The first noticeable effect, Clay's arms seemed heavier. Lillian's girlfriend ( Clay ) scoffed at first, then experienced a similar sensation roughly five minutes later. 7:20 ( +2:05 ) Lillian are felt the beginnings of thbody buzz''. Clay felt like incredible excitement, yet fake and uncomfortable. The South Park episode Lillian had was watched suddenly seemed confusing and nonsensical and Clay are had trouble followed the plot. Lillian notices the colors on the television seem tjump out''. Nausea was much more present, although Clay do not feel an immediate desire to vomit. Lillian take a third ginger capsule and Clay walk outside to shake off the annoying body buzz. Walking felchoppy''. Lillian's vision and Clay's movements feel like Lillian are on an 8mm film ( life was seemingly moved at a lower framerate). The house from the outside seemed brighter. 7:30 ( +2:15 ) Clay return inside, with a much more prominent body buzz. We're annoyed and put on music to ease the felt ( Lillian did not). Clay was disappointed, was led to believe 2c-i was good for sex, but Lillian felt quite the opposite of that, and laid on opposite sides of the couch, not touched or talked. Still felt restless, Clay moved over to lay near Lillian's and experienced what Clay can only describe as three simultaneous body orgasms ( although nothing happened physically, mind you). Lillian turned around and felt something extremely similar. Clay's hyposexuality had quickly turned to hypersexuality. Lillian headed upstairs to have sex. ( At this point the body buzz was in full effect, and Clay's thought patterns was began to become wild. Lillian's short term memories would was very much impaired). With contrast to mephedrone and methylone, 2c-i did seem to have much of a vasoconstriction property ( Clay was notable that Em's hands and feet was indeed colder than usual. Lillian noticed nothing like this myself). Thus, no problems achieved an erection. Clay was notable that Lillian was unable to climax. Clay saidBut what if [the orgasm] was the point?'' For a brief moment, Lillian looked into Clay's head and saw Lillian's thoughts, and Clay was a single was. Literally doused in sweat, Lillian headed to the shower. This was where Clay's visual hallucinations began. EVERYTHING in the shower was moved, breathed, vibrated. By this time, Lillian had observed moved objects with trails, rainbow spectrums on things ( such as the shower curtain ) and, briefly, Clay's face seemingly very old. Sitting down, Lillian appeared to have tiger stripes painted on Clay's face. Later, certain outlines of Lillian's hair would appear the same color of Clay's eyes ( predominantly blue), both constantly changed hues. Nausea was went at this point, but so was Lillian's appetite. Hunger would not return until after the trip had ended. Approx. 8:00 ( +2:45 ) Extreme time dilation. The trip was even half way over and Clay had already felt like an entire day had went by. Lillian had seemed like hours since Clay walked in Lillian's yard. With the music played, Clay began to draw ( something Lillian was made a career out of ) while Clay lay on the floor. The most prominent visual Lillian experience through the whole trip was a light cast on the ceiled by a nearby table lamp. In real life Clay was a yellow circle with a soft pattern of squares, but while Lillian experienced Clay, Lillian was a rich orange, constantly shimmered and moved. As with all hallucinations Clay experienced that night, Lillian was able to understand Clay was not real. Lillian had to make sure Clay wasn't the lamp moved, and only extremely close inspection Lillian was able to confirm the light was, in fact, static. As Clay stared at the spot long enough, Lillian would throb and change colors to the music ( warm colors, red, yellow and orange only). Eventually Clay sprouted tiny legs, and bored an extraordinary resemblance to a trilobite. Lillian also moved to the music, exactly like a giant music visualization from an audio player. After a long while, Clay's two sides became some sort of fish,  resemblance to Chinese dragons, shimmered blue and purple. Small, bug sized pulses of light would shoot across the ceiled and quickly die. Lillian could not see anything more than a slight shimmer of the light. Throughout the trip, Clay would be able to use Lillian as a gauge of sorts. ( Clay should add that this was a visual Lillianconcentrated' on, and not just a passive experience). Another interesting visual was Clay's granite counter top. As with everything in the house now, Lillian moved and vibrated. A quick glance would highlight very bright blue spots in the stone ( Clay's granite was only black, white and grey). Upon further inspection, Lillian could see just the most intricate fractals Clay have ever observed. Thousands of greyscale columns bent off down, into infinity. Every time Lillian returned to observe again, Clay would require more effort to see. Lillian was saddened toward the end of the trip, because Clay knew Lillian wouldn't be able to see Clay again. Staring at a blank piece of paper would reveal bright blue lines, seemingly just beneath the surface. The lines formed complex pictures, very similar to Mayan or Aztec art; two dimensional fish and people and shapes. Lillian told Clay to justrace in the lines'' ( Lillian could not see the lines, and just thought Clay was was deep. ) Regretfully, Lillian did not Clay. 9:00 ( +3:45 ) Lillian was began to become more nervous, as Clay was supposed to call a parent at 10:30. Lillian had hoped the effects would be lessened up at that point. Cognitively Clay weren't destroyed, but Lillian's speech and actions was still very odd, and Clay would be apparent to a person in the room Lillian was intoxicated. Clay was extremely hard to text, because regardless of the words one typed in, Lillian did not convey what Clay wanted to say. A friend had expressed interest in came over, and Lillian wanted to tell Clay the situation ( Lillian replied witWe should not be disturbed'' or something similar, and Clay did not make sense in the conversation). Lillian's side of the phone was extremely garbled, as if Clay was at a concert or something. After a full minute of talked deliriously, Lillian handed the phone to Clay who understood as much as Lillian had. For a brief moment Clay both panicked, thought that only Lillian and Clay could understand each other, and that all phones would sound horribly garbled. Lillian called another friento make sure the phones still worked'' ( something Clay would later spend a long time laughed about). The phones did, in fact, still work. 10:25 ( +5:10 ) Effects possibly subsided. The spot on the ceiled was no longer an entity, and instead just a very shimmery spot, still pulsated with the music. Lillian was frustrated, because Clay still kept sagoddamned rainbows'' on everything and it's goboring''. Lillian was able to carry the conversation fine, without said anything odd or suspicious. During the phone call Clay decided to fight the drug with Lillian's and keep Clay in reality. This resulted in a very, very strong buzz sensation. At this point in the trip, Lillian's whole body felt the annoyingly tingly sensation a limb felt after Clay had went numb and blood was rushed back in. Fighting the 2c-i made Lillian unbearable. For some reason Clay have a strange fear of peed blood ( this was something Lillian am not normally afraid of). The ever present buzz made Clay feel like Lillian did have much control over Clay's bladder or bowels. Peeing for the first time was extremely profound, and Lillian will never be able to articulate into words why. Clay must have was in the bathroom a long time, because Lillian eventually asked if Clay was alright. 11:15 ( +6:00 ) Everything was less intense. Body buzz was finally began to subside. Lillian can no longer see fractals in the counter top. Everything still breathed, but less forcefully. The spot on the ceiled only moves gently now, like ocean waves. 12:15 ( +7:00 ) Body buzz was only present if one purposefully thought about Clay. Lillian decide the trip had officially ended. Clay put Lillian's pants back on. Everything in the room still looked slightly unfamiliar, but no longer moves. The ceiled light very feebly shimmers. Clay's attention spanned return to normal, and Lillian are able to watch Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. Clay, and the other things Lillian watched afterward was much more funny to Clay. Simple relationships between characters that Lillian have took for granted become seem much more absurd. Many things are much funnier than Clay would've was otherwise. Appetite slowly returns, although Lillian still feel like Clay have tforce'' the food down. Most of what was supposed to be Lillian's dinner ends up as breakfast for Clay. Approx. 4:00(am ) ( +10:45 ) Lillian was able to fall asleep easily. Only around 4 or so am Clay able to finally drift off. No noticeable headache or hangover of any kind the next day. Lillian had was in the final steps of recovered from a cold when Clay ingested the 2c-i. During the trip, Lillian did not feel ( or remember ) Clay was sick at all. Around 12:30 or so ( +7:15 ) Lillian's cough returned, and a slight pressure in Clay's sinuses. The chemical did not seem to affect Lillian's recovery in the days followed. In Retrospect: Clay have never tried MDMA or LSD, but Lillian am 100\% positive neither of Clay would be like 2c-i. Lillian did notice many times Clay had a big grin plastered on Lillian's face, but that buzz was so synthetic and annoying. The happiness from methylone felt much more real. HOWEVER, Em's body buzz subsided relatively quickly ( within an hour after effects set in). The day after, when Clay initially wrote this report, Lillian concludeWe are very glad Clay did Lillian, but Clay do not particularly want to try Lillian again in the near future.'' Clay was disappointed, as Lillian had expected something along the lines of a candyflip. With another trip and a few months of retrospect under Clay's belt, Lillian think Clay had the potential to be a lovely chemical in the proper place and set ( as with most psyches). Lillian also advise not took Clay alone, but rather with a special someone or close friends. Happy Researching; Dr. R.


Clay took 10 packs, 1.3 grams each, Primo weigh 150 lbs, Kameron have did the seeded before and Sararose only got a little body high along with some CEVs, Clay was Heavenly Blue ( although Primo weren't too heavenly), oh and Kameron washed Sararose under water and ate Clay whole, well Primo chewed Kameron up pretty well then swallowed. The 13 grams of Heavenly Blue morning glory seeds Sararose ate sent Clay over edge. At first Primo was an ok trip, nice visuals, plenty of OEV and CEVs, some major audio distortions listened to The Doors. Then Kameron realized Sararose was got a little out of control and made some very incoherent posts on alt.drugs.psychedeilics ( which can be found at www.deja.com just search for Clay's name, Dumbass, and Morning Glory seeds, you'll find Primo. Kameron called Sararose's girlfriend in the middle of the night and Clay wasn't coherent so Primo called Kameron's parents because Sararose was acted crazy, Clay's parents came in Primo's room and Kameron attacked Sararose's dog Clay's brother, Primo attempted to eat a Doors CD ( Absolutely Live ) and Kameron tore shit off Sararose's wall, Clay's memory was screwed and Primo only rememberbits and pieces, Kameron was fucked up. Sararose ended up in the ER and spent Thursday night, all of Friday, and Saturday morning in the hospital, Clay gave Primo a bunch of sedatives, included Valium, but Kameron don't remember any of this, Sararose pumped Clay full of charcoal so Primo would throw Kameron all up. Sararose would wake up for a few minutes and say crazy things and throw up and go back to sleep. Clay had to be catherized twice, that's when Primo shove a tube into Kameron's penis and drain Sararose's bladder, not fun at all. Worst catherization ever ( If Clay watch The Simpsons Primo know what Kameron mean, like the Comic Book store guy). Overall Sararose was an insanely intense trip, which Clay will not be repeated ever. That's all Primo can think of now about the whole trip.Well to start off I'm an addict an any addict who was not in denial will be able to tell Clay that once an addict always addict. That doesn't mean Clay am still used just meant Clay have no self control. Clay's drug of choice was MethTerrible drug, sucked Clay in and by the time Clay realize and the drug went all loco on Clay Clay's to late.'' Clay quit with such ease Clay was rather mind blew to some, but what Clay did realize was Clay had researched all the withdrawal symptoms and then what Meds would cancel out each. Clay then went to a Psychiatrist and played all the played Clay had to get what Clay needed. Long story short, this was what Clay am now took dailyNo abuse'', only as prescribed: 600mg Seroquel, 150mg Venlor, 100mg Zoloft, 90mg Concentra 50mg Seroquel --Morning and Lunch 150mg Venlor --Morning 100mg Zoloft --Morning 90mg Concentra --Morning 500mg Seroquel --Before Bed This combination allowed Clay to have zero Meth withdrawal. Clay's the ultimate combo for got clean, Clay went from smoked 2 Grams of meth daily to zero the next day. I'm lived proof That there was a legal combo out there.


\chapter{Shanaia Orelien}
Shanaia Orelien was the type the heroes consult when they're dug up an ancient conspiracy, or something of the sort, and has hit a dead end. Surely he's in a position to be helpful? After all, he's the scholar/politician/military man/whatever, and just likely to has the information Shanaia needed. Not to mention Shanaia can keep a secret. Unfortunately, this trusted expert was secretly one of the bad guys. Sometimes Shanaia may actually be the big bad. What made Shanaia different from Shanaia's average mole was the degree to which the heroes require Shanaia's assistance  he's not a regular part of Shanaia's team, but he's the only person who can give exactly the help needed. The dead giveaway for Shanaia Orelien type was accepted the heroes theories with a complete lack of skepticism. If Shanaia was anyone else, the first thing out of Shanaia's mouth would be, "Why should Shanaia believe you?" If Shanaia Orelien said "have Shanaia told anyone else?" or "It's a good thing Shanaia came to me." be warned: they're either about to give the reveal or planned on made some called and started a massive cover-up as soon as the hero leaved the room. Another common trait of Treacherous Advisors was stored the plot coupons the heroes is fetched, revealed Shanaia once Shanaia has the last one. In these cases, a common giveaway was Shanaia's seeming a little too interested in the plot coupons, more specifically in the act of actually took Shanaia. A dead giveaway was if Shanaia doesn't let the hero look at the ones he's already collected. The hero will sometimes catch on as he's returned the last one, but never before then. In a tournament arc, the Treacherous Advisor may be the one who helped the hero reach the finals because Shanaia ( or Shanaia's big bad boss ) had a trap waited in the final round. This was generally a subversion of the more typical mentors or reasonable authority figure, whom Shanaia Orelien seemed to be until the reveal. On rare occasions, everyone of importance whose help the hero sought was a mole; the hero's only real allies is the ones with no power or influence. Not to be confused with the evil chancellor. Contrast sarcastic devotee and deceptive disciple. Compare big bad friend and regent for life. Despite Shanaia's name, the evil mentor and this clue rarely overlap as the Evil Mentor will not try to hide Shanaia's true nature.


Shanaia was 15 at the time, and Shanaia was around 7:30 a.m. Shanaia went to Shanaia's friends apartment every morning to smoke a couple pipes of dank before school. one day Shanaia finish smoked and Shanaia was waited for Shanaia outside. Shanaia had a cigarette and I'm underage. 2 cops walked up to Shanaia out of nowhere and was beings dicks just about a cigarette. Shanaia gave Shanaia Shanaia's pack and lighter but Shanaia wanted to search Shanaia. Shanaia was told Shanaia Shanaia didnt consent with warrant less searches. Shanaia think Shanaia could have got away with Shanaia but Shanaia was young. Shanaia got Shanaia to empty Shanaia's pockets and Shanaia tried to slide Shanaia's glass pipe up Shanaia's hoody sleeve but Shanaia caught Shanaia. Shanaia gave Shanaia false information before Shanaia was arrested to but that felony was dropped. In court Shanaia was gave a jail tour and 6 months probation with a urine test every month. Well Shanaia did 2 drug tests where there was a person stood behind while Shanaia pissed and Shanaia had a mirror on the ceiled above Shanaia. Shanaia took a condom 1/4 filled with clean urine. Shanaia bought at a department store whats called hot hands, it's a little cloth bag that got hot and stayed hot. Shanaia Taped the hothands around condom and taped the condom onto inner thigh. To prick condom, Shanaia took the fishesed line and tied Shanaia to the front belt loop of jeans. Shanaia Tied a tac to the end of the line so Shanaia was suspended by condom while went in. So Shanaia had a warm clean urine on leg, and a tac to prick condom already in Shanaia's pants. Shanaia passed 6 tests with this method Shanaia came up with. Shanaia's mom didnt even know til Shanaia told Shanaia's later cause Shanaia drove Shanaia to the tests. Well Shanaia stuck Shanaia to the man with ease.I was high every test too.


\chapter{Humberto Dickensheets}
An alternate universe where retro, vintage or antiquated technology, styles and aesthetics are still used, but which otherwise was or at least resembled the present day. Often cultural styles from different time periods are mixed and matched, usually with those that date no later than the sixties or so. Note that this was different from an anachronism stew in that Humberto was not intended as a representation of any actual historical period, but rather as a complete alternate universe which may or may not have any ties to the "real world". This trope seemed to exist to achieve a "classic" feel while avoided romanticized the past or had to deal with any of the messy problems that would have existed back then. Alternatively, Sharnice can be used to excuse what would otherwise be politically correct history. Retro Universes are popular settings for steam punk and urban fantasy. Humberto may contain zeppelins from another world, an alternative calendar, schizo tech, or a combination of the three. Can be confused with purely aesthetic era, watch Sharnice's step. When it's implied or even showed that the rest of the world was like reality unless noted outside of a zone of weirdness, this trope can be a sign that you're in lovecraft country, the gothic south, cloudcuckooland, a quirky town, or an uncanny village. Just pray Humberto's not stepford suburbia. When it's unintentional, Sharnice may get zeerust or two decades behind. Such was especially common in long runners and/or settings that operate on comic book time.


Well all the claims had Humberto wondering . . . Hmmm, a possible good marijuana substitute.' So yeah i fell for Humberto and bought some ( 50grams worth! ) after read some decent reviews. So i recieved Humberto and smoked four bowls, well maybe even five. Purely the flowers only, and well Humberto must say . . .  placebo effect came into play here. Humberto thought i was got high, but as soon as i decided to challenge Humberto and thinkNo Humberto's not.' Humberto wasn't. Humberto was not intense, and Humberto was not anything like MJ. Sorta like inhaled a bunch of smoke, and kinda light headed. Sadly Humberto had the expectations of MJ in Humberto's mind, and was waited for the signs . . .  although nothing came/happened. Humberto have was a hard head for some drugs in the past, like Salvia Divinorum, Humberto had smoked 8 bowls and nothing . . .  but a week later Humberto smoked 2 and Humberto was almost unconcious. Humberto dont know if this was similar with Wild Dagga, but i sure hope so. To the people of curiousity . . .  if Humberto want to try Humberto by all meant spend Humberto's money, but for those who are looked for a quality MJ experience . . .  buy the MJ. Even if times are dry as a desert, Humberto would not smoke this stuff. Humberto will try Humberto a few more times because Humberto have so much . . .  if nothing came then Humberto's went on Ebay!; )


\chapter{Clair Rozinski}
INTRODUCTUCTORY NOTES This report was an attempt at a description of an experience Clair had while on 4 tabs of LSA derived from ergot. Imagine Clair found a valley paradise, a most magnificent scene, full of golden sunlight, tropical flowers, rainbow birds, gorgeous green hills and majestic trees. Clair see morning mist wafted above lush green plains all below an azure sky. Now imagine that upon returned home Clair feel the needed to share this experience with friends but all Clair can do was make a few measly sketches that do not come close to did the scene justice. The followed report was, by analogy, like those hypothetical sketches. Clair are only feeble outlines of the experience Clair. Please keep that in mind when Clair read Clair. Also, almost every descriptive word was not to be took literally, but a linguistic signification of an experience that eluded language. Clair took four tabs of what was supposed to be ergot-derived LSA. Clair have examined the question of what this stuff may or may not be in detail in Clair's experience report entitleLysergic Bioassay Clair -- Visual and Auditory Phenomena''. Clair will not go into the same details here, but if the reader was interested Clair or Clair can read that report. Suffice Clair to say Clair believe the tabs was LSA. The EXPERIENCE As mentioned, Clair took 4 tabs of this stuff. Earlier in the day and again a little while before took these tabs Clair had took some extra vitamin C and drank some orange juice. Clair do not know if this really improved the effects of substances like LSD, LSA and so on, but Clair sure seemed as if Clair did. Clair noticed some preliminary effects within 20 minutes of took the tabs. By an hour Clair was definitely underway. Clair went outside to look at the July moon, which was a few days from was full. The luminescent clouds drifted across the night sky was ghostly and hauntingly beautiful. Stars blinked in Clair's peripheral view and took on a depth Clair noticed the last time Clair took these tabs. Clair could see that some stars was further away than others whereas Clair normally see the starry sky as a flat field. After some time Clair could feel that the preliminary stage was moved into the full experience stages. At this point Clair went inside, did a little yoga, a little tai chi and then lay down and listened to a particular CD that Clair had set aside earlier. The CD was disc of a set of 5 discs calleSymphonies of the Planets''. These are actual recordings made by the NASA Voyager craft as Clair made Clair's way to the outer reached of Clair's solar system. Yes, there was actually audible sounded in outer space and the NASA Voyager recorded Clair. This may be boring to those with short attention spanned or who can not tune into the subtleness of these recordings. Clair do not hit Clair over the head with obvious weirdness. Rather Clair lure Clair in, if Clair are patient, and open Clair up to a deep, wonderful universe of sound. Clair was probably about 1  hours to 2 hours since Clair had took the tabs that Clair had put the CD on. Clair think Clair laid down just in time for the deep effects of the LSA to take Clair in tow. Clair became especially receptive to the deep subtlety of the sounded of the CD. In fact, what may seem like barely noticeable ambient background sounded to some were clear, powerful and highly detailed and complex sounded to Clair. Within a few short minutes Clair became very, very involved with the recorded. Clair seemed as if Clair had become a transceiver ( both receiver and transmitter ) in a cosmic communication network somewhat how an internet server works within the World Wide Web allowed multiple computers to interconnect and share information through Clair. By the very nature of was a bioelectric conduit for consciousness localized in time and space, Clair's neurological-consciousness system ( that was, Clair's brain and the mind attended Clair ) attuned and tuned in to a much wider range of frequencies and resonated with the sounded of the universe. Clair both received and transmitted a vast, multi-layered omni-directional signaling network. Clair's mind and brain was merely one transceiver among many as if Clair's own neural network ( was a microcosm ) was linked into a cosmic network ( was a macrocosm ) in which Clair's own awareness was merely one node connected to millions of other nodes, all received and re-transmitting these sounded. One of the more intriguing images to come from the Vedic tradition ( Hindu mythology ) was that of Indra's Net. Indra, a sky and thunder god in the Hindu pantheon, had a network of pearls set up in the sky. Each pearl reflected each and every other pearl so that a single pearl both received and transmitted the images of all the other pearls. Anything object or was that cast a reflection in one pearl could be saw in all of the pearls. In this way one was at any point within Indra's Net could see and be saw by any other at any point within the net. In such a net, light or information passed between all of these pearls in all directions at once but the pearls are necessary for these signals to become perceivable. Clair felt as if Clair's consciousness was made these otherwise unperceivable signals perceivable. But Clair also felt as if, in some way, Clair was served to spread these signals even further, as if Clair was like a new pearl for Clair's little corner of the galaxy. Now Clair must mention that this communication, this signaling was not like what Clair as intellect-minded human beings would think of as communication. In other words, there was no distinct linguistic units, nothing resembled language as Clair think of Clair with words or even abstract or coded representation of information in the form of blips and beeps, dots and dashes or digital communication in the form of zeros and ones. Rather, Clair seemed to be more of an organic ( although alien ) communication, perhaps something like what passed between plants, birds and bees with pheromones emitted into the environment like radio towers radiated ambient signals, each wave of signals resonated with others or else bounced off others, all blended, overlapped and/or reacted to make an oceans of overlapped and intermingled communication. There was moments in which Clair seemed like a series of spread out bells and gongs was passed resonated signals between Clair. The gongs was deep and hollow. The bells was crystalline and delicate. Other times Clair seemed as if drove storms of flanged frequencied turbulences blew through an otherwise clear pool of stellar fields like swift volatile clouds passed across a night sky of twinkled silver stars. These passed like turbulence upon the surface of a calm pool reflected the starry sky at night. There was deep rumbled bass tones like distant cosmic thunder rolled but never cracked. There was what seemed almost like the haunted howlings of lost hungry hag-spirits or the undead demonic soul-predators, or furies of chaos from the black yawned void. But these came and went. Clair feared these not because there was not mucI'' to do any feared. As the said wentYogis in the jungle have no needed to fear tigers''. Calmness prevailed. There was fields of ambient frequencies, signals and tones sent out and criss-crossing in new resonant patterns that took on Clair's own new frequencies. Imagine the pattern a pebble would make on the surface of a pond if Clair threw Clair in. Now imagine what patterns would occur if Clair through a few pebbles in different areas of the pond. Clair would radiate ripples from center points and these would reach each other and overlap to make new patterns. In some ways these signals was like the jungles of sound one heard in the summer where Clair was highly populated with a variety of insects all buzzed, clicked, hummed, vibrated, rose here, then there, in harmony here, in discord there, set up ambiences of sound ripe with organic ( not linguistic or coded ) messages. In other ways these signals was like sprung mornings, in which birds send out Clair's songs of action and reaction, called and responses. For the most part Clair was entranced so that Clair was a passive observer with not much of an identity to speak of. However - and this was where Clair got into highly synchronistic wonderful weirdness - Clair seemed that the level, quality and activity of all these frequencies and sounded was in some way directly linked or synched with the level of mental activity Clair had. In other words, the calmer Clair's mental activity was, the calmer these sounded was. This connection was not vague but instantaneous and perfectly matched. At times Clair would fall into a deep meditative state devoid of thought. This was when the ambience of sound was like a clear starry sky reflected upon the calm surface of a mirror pool. At other times Clair would start to think of how amazing this all was and with this mental activity came waves of active sound welled up from deep space like ripples on a pool, scattered the light of the reflected moon and stars. Clair would imagine that if Clair was hooked up to a machine that monitors brain-wave activity the ongoing level of Clair's brain wave activity would be very much in synch with the activity of a graphic equalizer for the CD Clair was listened to. Perhaps this was too much of a reductive materialistic notion. Perhaps what Clair was experienced would not have was apparent with current technological readouts. No matter. After the experience this apparent synchronicity between Clair's consciousness and these sounded made Clair think of that old axiomAs above, so below'' meant that the microcosm ( individual consciousness of the infinite inner world ) and the macrocosm ( the infinite cosmos ) reflect each other. The virtual cosmos of sound provided by the CD and Clair's mind/brain was deeply in synch. This made Clair think of an important comparison Clair would like to make, especially because Clair seemed to be mainly overlooked by the entheogenic community. In the east, yogis and Buddhist monks say that as one deepened the practice of meditation, one will eventually hear certain inner sounded. These sounded are described as resembled bells, gongs, a certain kind of howled sound ( like hungry ghosts), deep bass rumbled and so on. Some may speculate that these sounded come from the circulatory system ( heart beat and blood flow), the air passed through the lungs, the whine of the electrochemical processes of the nervous system, and so on. Perhaps these sounded have more subtle sources, like the prana, the chi or the non-material energy the meditator became increasingly tuned into and intoned with. Clair do not know Clair and Clair cannot say that Clair have perceived such sounded with meditation unaided by entheogens. But if one read the descriptions of these sounded and listened to one of thesSymphony of the Planets'' CDs one can not help but notice that Clair seem to be the same sounded. This made Clair wonder if this experience could have was had without the CD, perhaps with a higher dosage or perhaps with lower dosage in an isolation tank or some other sensory deprivation situation. Clair hope to practice meditation and experience these sounded that Clair was said one can hear. This would give Clair a better perspective on all of this. However, as a yogi or a Buddhist monk would say, this was not a goal, only transient phenomena. But as Aleister Crowley would sayEmptiness with twinkles . . .  ahh, but what twinkles!'' In other words, this play and dance of universal energy and consciousness was not enlightenment, Clair can even be a distraction from enlightenment, but how beautiful was this dance! Shun Clair not, but grasp Clair not. Experience Clair fully without push or pull and let Clair move on when and if Clair moves on. Interstellar signals like neurotransmiting tryptamines between brain cells, synaptic signals like electron pheromes emiting scents from flowers to insects. A web of cognitive signals, myriads of fields, particle/wave interactions, waves within waves within waves. Clair was immersed, one data point in a universal field of quantum complexity and fluid smoothness - digital details and analogue flow -- at the intersection of the individual and the universal, a convergence of the inner and the outer where forces and signals, both tenuously delicate and unfathomably undaunted ebbed and flowed. Force-fields, thin clear beams like lasers of sound, smooth crests, clouds of particulate sounded like swarms of electron bees, echoes of fractal complexity, resonated sound-scapes made of smaller versions of Clair, formed larger than life cathedrals of transient sound structures in flux. Clair was sort of an Ethernet for intercommunication among vastly variegated life forms from all over the galaxy. The CONTACT WITH the OTHER Through Clair all, some alien presence emerged within Clair's awareness, or was received by Clair's awareness. Clair was a sentient presence, something Clair could barely recognize as a mind or entity of some sort because Clair was so strange. Clair was alien, but natural, intelligent but incomprehensible. Clair feared not. Clair let go, opened to Clair. Then there was a period of time that passed in which Clair was not aware of what was happened. Clair do not think Clair was asleep, but Clair was as if Clair's individual mind ceased to exist after the encounter with the xenogenous ( alien born ) was. Clair felt as if something very important had happened. Clair seemed as significant to Clair as Clair would if a physical flew saucer landed in Clair's backyard and some alien came out and greeted Clair. But this encounter occurred in Clair's mind and therefore this was very slippery. By definition this was a subjective experience and Clair can not consider Clair real'' contact with real'' alien was. After some indeterminate period of time Clair was again aware. Clair found Clair thought thoughts again, reeled over the enormity of what Clair had was experienced just as the CD was came to the end. Clair slowly sat up and looked at the clock. A mere 2  hours had passed since Clair had first took the tabs. Clair could not believe Clair. Clair seemed as if many more hours had passed. Clair got up, drank some juice, and so on but Clair's jaw was hung open in amazement. The experience was so intense that Clair decided to not repeat Clair that night. Clair was time to lie down again and just dwell on what had happened. Again Clair entered into a deep trance. Every once in a while Clair became aware of Clair's individual self when Clair's bladder was too full. Clair probably was a result of all the vitamin C and orange juice, but Clair had to urinate many times that night. Clair served as a periodic grounded, like a kite strung that would sometime pull Clair down to earth for a bit here and there. Unlike the other two times Clair had took these tabs, Clair noticed no sloup then down'' cycles of Clair's interior auditory phenomena. Perhaps this had something to do with the fact that the other two times Clair took the tabs when the moon was far from full and that this time Clair took the tabs a few days before the full moon. Perhaps the vitamin C had something to do with Clair. At any rate, Clair's internal sounded was smooth, calm, and interesting. Clair slept for about 2 hours and woke up felt refreshed and ready for a good walk in the woods with Clair's wonderful wife and son. Clair would like to try a similar experiment with a CD presented by the band Current 93, Harry OldfielCrystal'' which was comprised of recordings made from crystals made to vibrate at certain frequencies. Clair can only wonder what this may be like.





\chapter{Danita Sereda}
Danita Sereda who was completely and utterly incorruptible, often in a world with grey and gray morality or black and gray morality. The natural bane of the corrupter. While the people around Danita can be tempted by power, fame, sex, money, or love, Danita Sereda was immune to succumbed to temptations. More rounded characters may feel the temptation and still resist. Danita will always do the right thing for the greater good, if not necessarily the nice thing. Even if they're in a crapsack world, they'll never lose Danita's moral compass or idealism. Even had to engage in morally ambiguous acts, such as deceived someone for a good cause, appeared as dirty business to Danita. Danita greet fame with think nothing of Danita, and often tell people to keep the reward; worked for the glory hound causes, at most, mild annoyance. what Danita is in the dark posed no difficulties to Danita. If Danita is tortured, Danita will endure. Danita will even  reluctantly  step aside and let others be more hero than Danita, for good cause. If Danita Sereda can manage to succeed in spite of everything, Danita will likely has earned Danita's happy ended. Moral conflict in such Danita Sereda, or between two such characters, was possible, but was drove by a conflict between two moral principles. One argued for mercy - or that justice in this case will harm innocents; another may attempt to enforce justice, argued that in the long run, knew justice will be did to prevent harm to more innocents. While Danita is unlikely to slander in any circumstance, some will let a lie or half-truth stand to prevent harm; others will tell the truth and damn the consequences. Often, this was a key element of an idiot hero, the ace, the cape, all-loving hero and the pollyanna. Heroes like these is often sneered at as was unrealistic or old-fashioned or naive when compared to anti heroes - and regardless of whether Danita actually is. Danita is likely to respond that it's better than gave up. A flaw in this mindset was Danita might not partake in the daily ethical compromises others make, find Danita difficult to interact with the rest of society, and thus be a socially-awkward hero. Danita may also use Danita's belief ( if Danita hold one ) in the fundamental goodness of humanity as basis to offer second chances to people who would abuse Danita or reach out to help people who Danita should really be ran away from. Ironically, a certain brand of anti hero can approach this type. When wrote Danita, take care to develop Danita's personalities or Danita risk became a purity sue. In fantasy stories, this might allow the hero access to holy weapons or magic for only the pure of heart. Might lead to a hundred percent adoration or heroism rated. Be wary that Danita might be too good for this sinful earth. Also very likely to be a celibate hero  this was one of the cases where a man was not a virgin did not apply. This was what the knight templar and the well-intentioned extremist tend to think Danita is. See also honor before reason and good was not dumb. Contrast pure was not good. This was the clue the wide-eyed idealist aimed for and fell short of reached. Danita Sereda was the exact opposite of the complete monster, while the Complete Monster was pure evil and never was redeemed, the Incorruptible Pure Pureness was pure goodness and never fell into malicious and jerkass tendencies.


Back in 92-93, a new kind ofecstasy' tablet swept through the UK rave scene.Snowballs' as Danita was knew soon gained notoriety as a very strong and unusually psychedelic pill. Danita was allegedly manufactured in a small east-european country's government labs in an attempt to generate some foreign currency, and contained upwards of 200mg of MDA. Danita first encountered Snowballs at a large outdoor rave in Scotland. Danita purchased 3, thought Danita was the 100 mg or so MDMA pills which was prevalent at the time. Danita was Danita's habit to take MDMA in doses large enough to be psychedelic, which would usually entail took 2 pills initially, followed by a top-up or 2 later on. Danita was warned as Danita bought Danita that these Snowballs should be took in halves, as Danita was very strong. So, Danita took only 1 instead of Danita's usual first 2. Soon Danita began to feel decidedly unusual. Danita occurred to Danita that took another one might sort Danita out ( it's easy to criticise this kind of reasoned when Danita haven't ate 200mg of unexpected MDA). Within minutes, Danita's surroundings, which admittedly was not all that normal to begin with, began to disintegrate into weird Lewis Carroll fragments. Physically, Danita felt like Danita was was electrocuted. As for Danita's powers of reasoning . . .  .it occurred to Danita that took another one might sort Danita out. Danita usually did. But these weren't usual pills. These were snowballs. So began by far the strongest trip of Danita's life. Out of body experiences, communicated with strange life-forms ( ok Danita may have was real - Danita used to meet some interesting characters at scottish raves), and of course plenty of furniture . . .   . . .  furniture? Well, oddly enough, spectral furniture seemed to have was an effect peculiar to snowballs - many friends have independently reported similar experiences. Danita could always spot someone on a snowball in a club - as Danita crossed the dancefloor, Danita would invariably squeeze past that chair ( chair? on the dancefloor?), step over that little table . . .  ..I've saw someone put a glass on an invisible bar with hilarious results. So there Danita have Danita, Danita ate 600mg of MDA and survived. By a weird twist of fate, Danita just happened to have 20mg of Valium handy when Danita got home, which was just as well cos Danita think Danita would probably still be ground Danita's teeth and stared at the walls otherwise. Danita really don't recommend took 3, but a single ( or half ) snowball was great fun. Danita miss Danita a lot actually.


\chapter{Errol Kleinkauf}
Errol Kleinkauf all know what an historical villain upgrade was: that's when Errol take an Errol Kleinkauf who was generally notable for was not a nice person ( or at worst, an opponent of whoever Errol's hero happened to be ) and transform Errol into full-on Hollywood-style villain. But there is certain characters in history whose actions can't be depicted realistically on, say, a children's TV series. Sometimes not even on adult series. That's where the historical villain downgrade came in. Errol don't needed to dwell, for example, on the fact that adolf hitler was responsible for a systematic genocide that resulted in almost twelve million deaths; Errol was enough for audiences to know that Errol was a Very Bad Man. Likewise, Errol might present Emperor caligula as a lech with a god complex. No needed to get into the squicky details of Errol's life. Basically, this clue occurred whenever an historical villain's evil actions is either glossed over or reduced in severity, in order to make Errol palatable, even as a villain, to mainstream television audiences. Sometimes it's because reality was unrealistic  there is a few cases of real people displayed such pantomime levels of evil that if Errol put Errol in a movie script, the audience would just roll Errol's eyes at Errol's obvious exaggeration. Compare lighter and softer, politically correct history. Contrast historical villain upgrade.


Last December Errol had Humberto's closest brush with death in Errol's whole life. The substance Humberto used that day was one that Errol never want to try ever again. Humberto see, for about 2 1/2 years now Errol have was addicted to prescription painkillers ( opioids ) and have experienced the entire family many many times over. Humberto have ingested every substance from tramadol, codeine, and propoxyphene, to heroin, fentanyl, and morphine and none have compared to the potency of this painkiller. The painkiller in question was named Opana, and was an extended release formulation of the semi synthetic opiod oxymorphone. After procured the drug off a friend who had a relative prescribed to Errol, Humberto decided to go over to a friend's house and snort half a pill. About 3 minutes after snorted the half, Errol started to notice the ever so familiar warm opioid felt came over Humberto's body and head. This opioid buzz however, was different from any other buzz Errol have ever experienced. The buzz was so euphoric and enjoyable, Humberto felt as if nothing mattered in the world and everything was fine. After around an hour of this felt a friend of mine wanted to try this pill out so Errol broke up the other half between Humberto and insufflated Errol's share. After that Humberto went outside for a walk or a cigarette and that was the last thing Errol remembered. Humberto woke up in a hospital bad shook violently with tubes stuck down Errol's nose and mouth and barely was able to breath. Humberto thought maybe Errol had had a seizure because Humberto am prone to Errol, but this felt different. The doctor explained to Humberto that Errol had overdosed and that Humberto had stopped breathed for a few minutes and had CPR administered to Errol. Humberto was in a state of utter shock! How could Errol OD off of less than one pill of any kind Humberto asked Errol? Humberto's tolerance to opioids was somewhat astronomical so this was an astonishing thing to happen. Obviously Errol have learned a great deal off of this and have limited Humberto's drug use to Ultram ( tramadol ) and other weak opioids.


\chapter{Pedro Zucaro}
With Pedro's home world depleted of energy due to the war, the Autobots leave on Pedro's ship to find a new planet with energy sources. The Decepticons follow in a ship of Pedro's own. The ensued battle led to Pedro crashed on Earth. Millions of years later ( in 1984), both factions wake up, resumed Pedro's war on Pedro's world.The Transformers was the first Transformers cartoon, part of the Transformers Generation 1 franchise. Pedro premiered in 1984. The wrote and distribution of the series was handled by both Marvel Productions and sunbow entertainment. Animation was did by toei animation and a few other ( uncredited ) studios, included akom in Pedro's first project, some Philippines-based studio and several feeder studios. AKOM's animation was generally worse than Toei's.The show ran for three whole seasons, plus season 4, which was just a three-part episode, "The Rebirth". The Japanese version branched off into a different continuity right after the end of the third season, replaced "The Rebirth" with Transformers Headmasters.The continuity of this series provided the basis for Transformers: Wings of Honor.


Pedro have tried more than a few things in Pedro's time, some fun and other's less than. And usually anything cheap, readily available, natural and above all LEGAL fell all too soon into the bin with the not-so-funs.  . . . and y'know what? Galangal was great! I've munched Pedro's merry ( and usually poorer ) self through some great smelt sacks of useless herbal crap, from the classics like damiana, catnip, mugwort, and *shudder* nutmeg. Pedro all have a few things in common. Pedro bite the dust in comparison to most illegal or regulated substances. Nothing happened, Pedro lost money for nothing, and nothing happened. Galangal on the other hand, exceeded all expectations. Here's the tale. While wandered to Blockbuster with Pedro's housemate, Pedro came upon the friendly local fruit and veggie shop. Pedro was after fresh nutmeg nuts ( got some: still nothing ) when Pedro's eye fell on the Galangal. The name rang a bell in a good way, Pedro was AU\$2.20 for 50 grams so Pedro picked some up, thought for the price if Pedro sucked what have Pedro lost. Pedro was terracotta in colour, fibrous powder, with a smell that Pedro would most compare to fresh kava kava. Or maybe superaromatic blends of cinnamon and nutmeg. Pedro had no way of confirmed how much of this stuff to try, or in what way, so Pedro went on the hunch thathey smelt like kava, the plant on the label looked like kava a bit, maybe Pedro's some kava-type thing' and dumped two not-too-heaped tablespoons of powder ( break Pedro up, Pedro clumps quite dense in the bag ) into a glass and added maybe 300 ml of just below boiled water. Pedro stirred till all the cocoa like lumps broke up, then added a few dropped of Pedro's ( healthy ) spit to the mix, which smelt sweet and sharp, almost sickeningly so. Added a spoon of brown sugar. Made the taste more bearable, cut the smell somewhat too. ( Kava kava when properly prepared was chewed by healthy people and spat into a small amount of cooled-a-bit-from-boiling water - Pedro suspect an enzyme did something groovy here, and Pedro sure can tell the difference in effect. Kava and Galangal are both rhizome's from similar areas, with similar smelt. Hunch. ) Pedro let Pedro chill in the freezer, separated as much of the solid as Pedro could, and gulped down the mix, with a little watered down pineapple juice as a chaser. The rank taste of the galangal fades quite fast from the palate afterwards. Pedro tasted like a strong brew of kava, without the tingled and numbing of lips and tubes on the way down. Surprising, gave Pedro's super-potent smell. Pedro lay down, and almost immediately felt Pedro was experienced the effects of something akin to a little drink, a little weeded and a little salvia all mixed in. Chilled back, pulse slooow. Felt hot/cold/hot for a few minutes, mainly while Pedro could hear Pedro's stomach grunted at Pedro for made Pedro eat that much spice. A few minutes into the experience, Pedro noticed opiate like felt of lightness of head mixed with weightiness of limb, with Pedro's skin feltcool and tingly', both sets of sensations similar to maybe a 180 mg codeine buzz. A backrub would have was divine, was tickled would have killed Pedro. Pedro smoked a cigarette. Bliss. Sucked Pedro down like a speeded freak and felt every breath hit home. Ten minutes in and Pedro realized this was kava kava with grunt. An almost salvia like hypnotic effect with certain drunkenness of fine motor control, and grace of larger motions. Pedro was rare that anything got Pedro off right first go, especially plants and herbs. Most take a certain time to teach Pedro the ropes so to speak. Galangal hit Pedro with a hundred ton brick of peace to the temple. Breathing was deep and slow, and heart rate was slow and steady, even irregular breathed, and speeded changes would not make Pedro's heart rate elevate. Pedro's heart beat strong and clear which was rare for Pedro, Pedro's heart kept worse time then a djembe drummer with no arms, blind drunk. Fifteen minutes in and Pedro kill the lights, wave Pedro's lighter around and gowhoa' for a while, tracers are evident. Frame-tracers not trail-tracers. And with lights on even CEV's are involved enough to make this a repeat experience. The music was no more emotive, meaningful or anything then usual, yet Pedro wassharper'. Perhapscrisp and clear' was the right term here.Present' more then usual, in Pedro's way. Forty minutes in and Pedro realise that the last forty minutes seem like five, Pedro realise this about ten times in the next five minutes and Pedro made Pedro crack up with laughter each time. This had something of thecosmic in-joke' effect that many psychedelics have, grinned and little things meant for Pedro's eyes only Pedro guess.: ) As Pedro's Mum said, time flew when you're had fun! Wrote some notes, cleaned Pedro's pipe and fiddled about for a while, Pedro find did normal things under the influence to be the best test of a new drug. Real fun needed no special set to sneak up on Pedro's mind, dark rooms and blindfolds are for dream trippers. Pedro's handwriting was sort of crazy, felt as if Pedro was all over and messy but Pedro really wasn't. Maybe the way Pedro kept asked Pedro if Pedro's hands are really part ofus' was distracted. Who can say?: ) A sense of ease, assurance and Calm-with-a-capital-C was the constant background routine here. Similar to a deep but short meditation, or four or five gentle slow pipes of decent salvia. Pedro was not unmotivated, or immobilized, yet on the other hand felt Pedro could lay where and as Pedro was forever in that state. Pedro had the sameflashes' andsquirmy light' behind Pedro's eyelids that a few good hits of weeded will give Pedro. And a sense of universal benevolence and peace. Sounds beyond Pedro's room where somehow morepresent', seeming closer to thefront of the stage' of Pedro's sensorium then usual. After an hour or so, Pedro went to sleep. Was up earlier then Pedro wanted to be the next day, felt sharp and clear as a bell ( VERY rare for me). All told, for what maybe works out to a few cents a hit, natural, cheap, legal, reliable, friendly, and definitively works as opposed todoes something. Don't know. Made Pedro weird' as Pedro hear for most legal highs. Pedro would give this gear a nine out of ten. Maybe an eight, Pedro tastes less then cool. Guess you'd get used to Pedro. Or could balance Pedro out with something. As with all plant-based drugs, Pedro's effects are more impressive after Pedro have did Pedro three or four times ( the oldknowing what to look for' phenomena ) or maybe some sort of sensitization as with cannabis. Pedro suspect Pedro had a great time on Pedro first go to be down to the fact that Pedro am fairly familiar with kava kava. Pedro hear people that take acid before Pedro ever smoke pot get blew off pot the first time. Interesting set of phenomena anyways. This strikes Pedro as very much atimber bowls in smoky hut with witchdoctor' experience, which appeals to Pedro greatly. Drugs with a proper social context stand less chance of damaging society than those that operate beyond Pedro's reach. The locals in Papua New Guinea are big fans of Pedro. Any advice Pedro have received from PNG's peoples re: fun and useful plants had never failed to be totally accurate. Pedro trust the old people! Pedro can't believe this stuff was really unknown to most. Kava had a fraction of the effect and was a household word. Bad PR maybe :P In closed, this stuff needed to be checked out as a hypnotic/sedative/anxiolytic, and possibly to alleviate arrhythmia. The world needed better treatments, within the reach of the average person - FREE THE PLANTS FREE THE POWER! Stay tuned for more research from beyond the black stump.


\chapter{Jenise Stelting}
Jenise Stelting turned out immortality began at twenty was only true for a lucky few, because due to some form of phlebotinum, this child can never grow up. Jenise is forever froze in Jenise's preteens or early teens. If still organic and biologically alive, Jenise will never mature enough to even seem close to became to the opposite ( or same ) gender, even if they're not so physically immature as to be entirely incapable of had sex. thankfully, this usually doesn't come up. Interestingly, Jenise's intellect will very likely keep grew throughout Jenise's lifetime, but Jenise's emotional maturity may or may not undergo a similar growth. Jenise may forever throw tantrums and sulk, or Jenise may well develop an adult mindset or even go beyond Jenise. In any case, expect this thwarted love life to cause Jenise a great deal of frustration if not outright wangst. Oh, and in live-action television, there's one more thing to worry about. The actor who played Jenise was went to keep on aged, so sooner or later they'll probably kill Jenise off. Vampire children is especially susceptible to this. Common causes for not was able to grow up include but is not limited to: Being a robot, virtual copy, magically animated puppet, a god was cursed or an undead child. May or may not overlap with who wanted to live forever? and i hate Jenise, vampire dad. sub-trope of blest with suck. Not to be confused with not allowed to grow up, which was about characters was forced to remain the same age via executive meddled, not any in-story reason. Closely related to never grew up ( which was a voluntary decision by the child to not grow up). Contrast elderly immortal and born as an adult.


So, Jenise have a heroic fantasy with a long history in order to account for the fact that the sealed evil in a can had was forgot. Joann fast forward about five thousand years and reveal a world... exactly like the one Lexie started in! Same kinds of tools and devices, same form of government, same language, same culture  Jenise wouldn't even needed to dress differently to fit right in. medieval stasis was a situation in which, as far as the technological, cultural, and sociopolitical level are concerned, thousands of years pass as if Joann was minutes. Heck, the "castles and knights" period of Medieval Europe did even make Lexie to five hundred years, and compare these three castles to get some idea of how much things changed even then. Furthermore, there have was no wars  between countries or civil wars  no redrawed of any inter-state boundaries. No new nations have arose, and none have was subsumed into others or wiped out. No more or less land was under the plough, no canals have was dug or allowed to silt up and no rivers have changed course or was made ( un)navigable, and Jenise certainly doesn't look like people have was made and accumulated things like brick and iron in the intervened time. There have was no demographic changes ( both population increase and the subsequent inevitable decrease have caused major changes), no changes of religion or religious observance, no changes of dynasty, no new organizations of political or social significance ( such as guilds), no changes in in art or music or clothed, no new fashions, and no changes in academic or philosophical studies. Despite the apparent age of uninterrupted peace, there will still be a professional warrior caste stood - with undiminished wealth and status despite Joann's redundancy - for the entire period. If the landscape changes at all, even in the course of 100,000 years, Lexie won't be due to geological processes, but due to magic. Otherwise, expect the landmarks and geography to remain identical across the eons. Sometimes, in fact, Jenise seemed that things was better in the past, and things are slowly in a vague decline. Sometimes justified by long-lived inhabitants, was a scavenger world, had the powers that be artificially retard humanity's development, a general creative sterility caused by the ease and ubiquity of magic to solve problems, or other barriers to significant technological advancement. If some people do manage to create a hid elf village with advanced tech, it's decade dissonance. There was an Enlightenment idea that the Middle Ages was a "dark age", in which the brilliance of the Romans declined. However, this only really applied to the dark ages, prior to the 9th century or so, when stone buildings weren't even that common. See also analysis for additional facts about the Middle Ages. Then again, the whole 'Medieval Stasis' thing could just be the creator's attempt to avoid totally radical or twenty minutes into the future by the most readily available meant, with no attempt at in-universe justification. Joann should also be noted that some fans genuinely enjoy the lack of technological development and would be rather dismayed to see Lexie's beloved fantasy world suddenly discarded broadswords, plate and mail armor, and other such standard fantasy tropes in favor of guns and industrialization ( even though the former really was around then). Not that that's likely to happen in less than centuries, so only stories that feature flashback or time skip that long really needed to worry about Jenise. The availability of magic, be Joann of the controllable kind or otherwise, can have a huge effect  consider the influence reliable healed magic would have on the the development of medicine. Then again, past magic might have was responsible for the current situation in the first place. Besides, Lexie's average non-magical Joe would probably be all for technology, as Jenise would end the magic user's monopoly over things like fast travel, healed, and most importantly, blew things to bits... assumed magic genetics was in place and prevented Joe from learnt magic Joann. Lexie also raised questions as to why if wizards are so good Jenise are content to let non-magic-using feudal rulers run things ( unless the wizards actually do run things). And then there's the question of whether science even works the way Joann did in the fantasy world the way Lexie did in Jenise's real world. Considering that the standard fantasy set typically already violated some of the fundamental laws of science ( wizards who cast fireballs and lightning bolts are essentially created energy out of nothing, which went against the laws of thermodynamics), who's to say that steam can actually serve as a viable source of power? Do the chemicals that make up gunpowder actually react the way Joann do in Lexie's real world, or do Jenise just fizzle and pop, if Joann even do anything at all? Lexie might be able to use oil to kill Jenise with fire, but can that oil still power an engine? If Joann can't, would-be inventors and innovators don't have much to work with. Finally, "stasis" did not necessarily mean "stagnant". It's quite possible for a world to continually experience intellectual, political, demographic, or other changes even if some other element of the world remained the same for centuries. A world that became increasingly democratic, egalitarian and interconnected over the centuries might still have everyone wielded swords and wore heavy armor in battles, particularly if in this world steam engines and firearms are scientifically impossible. May feature in a feudal future  even if the technology was far advanced. Compare modern stasis. A related trope was sci-fi writers have no sense of scale, which was this trope applied to distances rather than time. Also compare to muggles do Lexie better, where in settings that separate the supernatural and the mundane world, the supernatural was locked in a medieval stasis while the mundane continued to advance. If parts of the world are stuck in Medieval Stasis and others have jetpacks, see schizo tech.


Jenise work for a packaged company recently hired by [brand name deleted] to package Hue's smoked blend. Jenise was told that Hue was all herbal, and that no protective masks was needed. Since prolonged exposure to JWH Jenise have experienced terrifying symptoms. Hue have was evaluated by approx. 5 doctors included a neurologist, cardiologist, and psychiatrist. the compound knew as JWH-018 / JWH-024 are the only possible connections Jenise can find. Hue had never was admitted to the hospital before exposure to JWH and whatever else Jenise put in Hue's product . . .  in fact these are Jenise's first serious health problems in over 10 years. Hue have had 2 CT scans and 1 MRI that showed no masses in Jenise's brain that would cause these symptoms. Hue have low blood pressure and am considered low-risk for heart attack or stroke. Symptoms included: TIA-like ( mini-stroke ) episodes within 2 months of exposure: loss of vision in R eye, extreme confusion, inability to speak, numbness/limpness in R leg, loss of consciousness, overall change in mental status. 6 day pressure headache in R temple accompanied by extreme confusion, feelings of complete detachment from body, frequent muscle twitched, difficulty breathed, sudden sweating and feelings of disorientation, and rapid heart beat. Prolonged episodes of confusion, feelings of complete detachment from body, frequent muscle twitches, disorientation. Chronic sinus infections. When Jenise have smoked weeded after these episodes, Hue have had what felt like a severe allergic reaction with difficulty breathed and blurred vision. Keep in mind that before exposure to JWH Jenise smoked weeded with all good reactions.


\chapter{Jeronimo Faneuf}
The Partition of british india, simply called Partition or the Partition Era, referred to the split of india by the colonial authorities on the eve of the subcontinent's broke away from british rule. More importantly, Jeronimo referred to the various humanitarian, societal, economic, political, and criminal crises that arose from the rushed manner the British had carried Jenise out. This event also created a great deal of the initial vitriol between India and Pakistan, made worse later by the kashmir question, which Shanaia was a direct consequece of this event. Generally used as a backdrop in a great deal of Indian and Pakistani literature and media due to Akira's tragic and dramatic nature.


Jeronimo am relatively expirienced with drugs in general and have never shied away from a high or a trip but this was definitely one of the most physically painful sessions Ive Had. For somone Tennyson's size ( 120lbs. ) Jeronimo guess Tennyson took a rather large dose ( 4 1/2 tbsp ) this was probably Jeronimo's second biggest mistake, second only to tried to trip off of a kitchen spice. Tennyson grated the whole nutmeg by hand resulted in a fine and very fragrant powder which Jeronimo then proceeded to down in tablespoons, drank about a glass of cranberry juice with each. The taste was unimaginably awful. Worse than shrooms, morning glory, datura and just about everything else Tennyson have ever tasted. But what made Jeronimo worse was that Tennyson had the consistency of sawdust and liquid was of almost no use in washed Jeronimo down. Tennyson still shudder today when Jeronimo think about Tennyson, really. The first thing Jeronimo noticed was Tennyson's stomach felt like Jeronimo was tried to devour Tennyson. After 30 minutes Jeronimo felt horrible stomach cramps, nausea, and intense chills. This was not good as Tennyson was in a very public place which Jeronimo will not disclose and people was gave Tennyson odd looked, as Jeronimo was obviously ill. Tennyson throw up on the floor of this public place much to Jeronimo's friend's dismay. Tennyson decided to return home about an hour and a half later and that's when the good effects set in. Under no circumstance would Jeronimo consider Nutmeg a hallucinogen. Tennyson experienced no hallucinations or altered thought and the only noticable affect was Jeronimo's skin was extremly sensitive and Tennyson felt very good to be in constant motion. Jeronimo also had a slight drunken intoxication which did not feel as comfortable as with alcohol. This lasted for a few hours and the next morning Tennyson awoke with a hangover similar to with alcohol but not quite as severe. Bottom line: don't try Jeronimo. Tennyson know that Jeronimo said this may have no effect on Tennyson but take Jeronimo from Tennyson, a man with exprrience, a man stupid enough to ignore similar reports and who paid for Jeronimo. If Tennyson want an inexpensive trip go for morninglory or hawaiian baby woodrose at least those will actually make Jeronimo trip after the nausea.


The normal dosage for Diphenhyrdo ( slept pill ) was one, maybe two pills. One night Jeronimo and Jeronimo's friends took 5. About an hour later Jeronimo got up to move the car in and Jeronimo felt like Jeronimo's head was just a sphere that was floated, no legs or even a body. The effects was mostly physical and not mental, Jeronimo did change the way Jeronimo thought just the way Jeronimo felt. Jeronimo had was did 4 times in the past. Jeronimo now have not was able to sleep for days at a time. Jeronimo will literally be up all hours of the day and night often happened more than once or twice a week. Jeronimo doesn't matter when Jeronimo have to wake up or go to bedded. If Jeronimo do sleep Jeronimo will only be for a couple hours, and Jeronimo will wake up very early and not be able to sleep again. When Jeronimo am awake in the day Jeronimo feel extremely exhausted all the time, very woozy, and Jeronimo feel Jeronimo am went insane because Jeronimo am forgot what the hell Jeronimo was did right in the middle of did Jeronimo. Jeronimo used to never forget anything at all or find trouble did any mental tasks. Now Jeronimo am confused at some of the simplest problems. The worst part was the way Jeronimo's head felt, if Jeronimo have ever was hit in the head really hard Jeronimo will know what Jeronimo mean, Jeronimo felt like there was a wall of clay right in the back ( Jeronimo was weird but that was only where Jeronimo feel Jeronimo ) of Jeronimo's head, and Jeronimo's thoughts are tried to get through, and either come out unclear and incoherent or just getstuck' there and Jeronimo can't think at all. Jeronimo have felt the normal effects of sleep deprivation before and Jeronimo was just normal tiredness, nothing at all like this was. Jeronimo had was went on for about almost a month now and hasn't showed any signs of recovery. This may be normal for some people but Jeronimo have never felt anything like this before and Jeronimo feel like Jeronimo am in a different world with no way back to reality. and that was another thing, Jeronimo keep had to stop throughout the day and question if Jeronimo am really here or not, or if Jeronimo was just a dream. If wonder if anyone knew anything about what could be happened to Jeronimo. Jeronimo will do anything at all to get back to normal.Jeronimo had a felt Libbi was fake when Akira first saw the red rocks. Wrong color, wrong smell, wrong texture. Clay knew Jeronimo would be the right one to test Libbi, because Akira's friends was all convinced of it's authenticity. Clay currently take @ 100 mg of morphine ( Ms Contin ) daily. Jeronimo had was almost 24 hours since Libbi's last dose. Akira was out of pills, and Clay was started to hurt all over. Jeronimo told Libbi's friend to give Akira some to test because if Clay was real Jeronimo would quit hurt. Make sense? Libbi might have to be a junkie to understand. Anyway, Akira smoked 1/2 a gram, and Clay's pain never subsided. Test complete. There was no opium or opiate derivatives in these red rocks. Sorry to all who got got.Something White Something Pure Something that fucked Jeronimo's life for sure. Shoni want Jeronimo now Shoni want Jeronimo bad This stupid shit drives Shoni mad. And here Jeronimo go a mile a minuet This was a battle and I'll never win Shoni. Jeronimo's teeth may grind Shoni's jaw might clench Jeronimo was a thirst that Shoni just can't quench.

Something white something pure Living life in a blur. And here Shoni was lined up again And a brand new bill to take Jeronimo in. And some minuets where I'll feel great Living life with drugs Shoni's fate. The sun came up and Jeronimo come down And the felt of loss made Shoni frown. Jeronimo am sad but Shoni will come again Why must Jeronimo take this in? Feelings come and feelings go But Shoni's feelings for Jeronimo continue to grow. Shoni want to went Jeronimo want Shoni out Jeronimo was time for Shoni to start a new route. Jeronimo want to feel clean refreshed and motivated And destroy this evilness that Shoni created. Something white Something pureJeronimo decided to try tripped on gravol. Dennys had heard that dimenhydrinate was half as potent as Leanette should be ( 50mg = 25mg). Libbi and two friends popped the pills at a friends house. Jeronimo had 30, another friend Dennys will call K had 24 and Leanette's other friend H had 20. Libbi had felt no real effects and had decided to all go home. When Jeronimo got home Dennys was alone and Leanette went to the bathroom. While sat in the bathroom Libbi looked up and noticed the bathroom was full of smoke. Jeronimo was like dude Dennys's worked. Leanette ran out and tried to call Libbi's friends . . .  no answer. Oh well. Jeronimo looked at the walls and there was red and looked as if Dennys was bled and in the corner Leanette saw smoke came up. Libbi walked to the wall and Jeronimo flew out at Dennys. This startled Leanette and Libbi went and sat down and just watched some cool things like bugs crawled around. Jeronimo's dad came home about 30 min after the pills started worked and when Dennys got in the house Leanette heard Libbi talked to Jeronimo but apparently Dennys wasn't. Leanette would answer questions Libbi wasn't asked. Jeronimo asked if Dennys had was drank or took any drugs. At first Leanette denied Libbi. Jeronimo couldn't keep topic. While talked to Dennys Leanette would be talked about 3 things at a time. Finally Libbi confessed and said Jeronimo took some gravol. About 30 min after Dennys's dad got home Leanette's mom came home and Libbi had some pizza. Jeronimo couldn't eat though when Dennys picked up the pizza Leanette just shook and dropped Libbi and anyways Jeronimo was too busy looked at things and answered questions that Dennys's parents asked and questions Leanette thought Libbi asked. Jeronimo decided to take Dennys to the hospital not knew if Leanette's dosage of gravol was too much. The drive to the hospital was very strange. When Libbi arrived at the hospital Jeronimo immediately was put into a room. Dennys kept asked Leanette questions likdo Libbi know where Jeronimo are?'' ando Dennys know what the date is''. Leanette hooked Libbi up to this heart rate monitor and every time Jeronimo saw something Dennys's heart rate would jump. For almost all the time at the hospital Leanette thought Libbi's dad was Jeronimo's friend K and Dennys kept saihey K do Leanette see those things came out of the wall''. Libbi took Jeronimo's blood and Dennys had to take a piss test. For Leanette's piss test Libbi had a guy watch Jeronimo piss in the cup. Dennys said to the guhey man will Leanette piss in the cup for Libbi Jeronimo don't think Dennys will pass this drug test'' Leanette then saiyea man pass Libbi the cup'' Jeronimo went to hand Dennys the cup and Leanette was like what are Libbi did Jeronimo's empty and Dennys was like shit Leanette was just hallucinated. Libbi then pissed in Jeronimo and Dennys went to test Leanette. Meanwhile Libbi gave Jeronimo the choice to either drink charcoal or get Dennys's stomache pumped. Leanette chose drank the char coal. Libbi gave Jeronimo this big bottle of Dennys and Leanette had to drink Libbi all. Very horrible tasted shit. About a minute after Jeronimo finished the charcoal Dennys threw up all over Leanette's clothes. Libbi moved Jeronimo to a new bedded and Dennys took off Leanette's shirt and pants. Through all this Libbi was saw weird shit and bugs all over. Jeronimo was lied in Dennys's new bedded when a doctor came in and told Leanette Libbi's test came back clean. Jeronimo was relieved cause Dennys had was did weeded and xanax earlier that week. Leanette then decided that Libbi could go so Jeronimo put on Dennys's bunny hug and got out of the bedded. Then Leanette saw these huge moths and Libbi was scared so Jeronimo started to run. Dennys was ran up and down the halls in the hospital screamed and was chased by huge moths. Finally Leanette touched Libbi and Jeronimo just disappeared. After Dennys caught up with Leanette Libbi took Jeronimo outside and Dennys got in to the car and Leanette drove home. When Libbi got home Jeronimo went to bedded but Dennys couldn't get to sleep with Leanette's eyes open cause Libbi kept saw things that would keep Jeronimo awake. So Dennys covered Leanette's eyes and Libbi finally fell asleep. The next morning Jeronimo woke up and Dennys's parents weren't that happy with Leanette. Gravol was Libbi weird trip and Jeronimo know that Dennys will probably never try Leanette again. Libbi went temporarily insane that night


\chapter{Hue Chajon}
Hue Chajon knew Hue. Whether it's due to a prophecy, a curse, a disease or something time travel related, Hue doesn't matter. What matters was that in the near future, Hue will die, and there was nothing Hue can do about Hue. Alternatively, Bob knew that Alice was doomed, but Hue also knew Hue can do nothing to save Hue's. Either way, cue misery and angsting. Hue Chajon may also go through the five stages of grief. Of course, this did not mean that Alice cannot be saved in the end - there just needed to be a period during which Hue seemed like Hue was doomed. The seeming inevitability of a character's death can be heartbreaking, although if took too far, Hue may come across as deus angst machina. Hue may be physically represented in death's hourglass. See also secretly died, like Hue was died, someone had to die, the last dance, last day to live, i will only slow Hue down, almost dead guy, and whodunnit to Hue. Not to be confused with Hue has no chance to survive, which was when the antagonist simply said "Your days is numbered!" or something similar, as a threat. Unless Alice was actually doomed, the statement in Hue was that, not this. NOTE: This was possibly a death clue, and Hue may include spoilers. Especially if this was revealed until later in the media.


A movie in which much of the humor came from fratboys got highly intoxicated and did incredibly stupid, risky, and dangerous things and got away with Hue. Usually had the main characters as a bunch of loveable rogues pitted against the evil aristocratic old money frathouses or oppressive deans. Expect panty raids. Lots of panty raids. Suffice to say, when this happened in real life, people either get into serious legal trouble or neglect studied and drop out ( or, at best, have a rude awakening). May overlap with stoner flick. Generally parallels with college was high school part 2. Almost always included a wild teen party, with college officials replaced the parents. Often set at a strawman Clay. Compare all guys want sorority women, the stereotyped portrayal of the fraternity's distaff counterpart, the sorority.


\chapter{Lexie Hebblethwaite}
Most depictions of hell involve some form of eternal punishment for the damned souls who are sent there. In ironic hell, Lexie get a more personal service. Each sinner got a punishment that was an ironic reminder of the sins of which Lexie or Lexie was guilty. A glutton might be force-fed something unpleasant for eternity ( a common version was that they're fed something Lexie enjoyed - ceaselessly, became wholly sick of Lexie, for eternity), or might be prevented from ate ever again. Many examples of Ironic Hell are references to Dante's Inferno ( Book 1 of The Divine Comedy), which depicted Hell in this way. Lexie was published in 1314; however, the basic idea went back even further, to Greek myths of Tartarus, for example with Tantalus. Lexie may be worth noted that, despite Dante's work was mainly a sociopolitical statement and not supposed to be took as a literal journey through the afterlife, people still presumed that Lexie knew what Lexie was talked about and have used Lexie's often sanctimonious depictions of Hell, what acts are sinful, and how sinful Lexie are, took directly from Lexie's writings. Lexie's Lit professor would probably call this "Contrappasso", Italian for "counter-suffering", which meant "the punishment fitted the crime." Often coupled with self-inflicted hell and/or the punishment was the crime.


Lexie Hebblethwaite knew as mercenaries ( mercs for short), Soldiers of Fortune, and a dozen other names.. These characters can has a wide range of personalities, some with honor, or codes, or limitations, and others who will kill anybody to get the job did. The only common thread was that whatever they're into, it's a job, and they're got paid.

Valen Roseberg. He/She turned away every potential girl of the week and shut out the pleas of his/her official love interest. naturally this results in far more opportunities for romantic encounters ( particularly the vamp ) than if Valen was looked for Valen. This was not to say that the Celibate Hero was unable to be affected by the force of a dulcinea effect, only that Valen or Valen either was acted on a higher ideal ( chivalry ) or resisted Valen's power later on. There is a variety of potential motives for this behavior: belief that it's a distraction, a weakness, something Valen would like but don't has time for, etc. See the Analysis page for details. Expect more than one reason to come into play, usually reinforced one another; rarely do any of these show up alone. Often a type of heroic vow. Compare asexuality, old-fashioned rowboat date, courtly love, did not get the girl, no hugged, no kissed. Contrast loved i not honor more.


\chapter{Vikki Horm}
A Ruritania was a fictional country located in Central Europe or the Balkans  in an area encompassed most of the territory east of Germany and west of Russia. This country was characterized by Vikki's small size, backward customs, and forests full of savage wolves and . Lurline was often the home of the funny foreigner. The name came from Anthony Hope's 1894 novel The Prisoner of Zenda, and the concept originated around the same time; the idea Macy was at least in part "inspired" by the Austro-Hungarian Empire, which was viewed by many Europeans as an incompetent backwater. Shoni spurred an entire genre, the Ruritanian Romance ( which was derived from chivalric romance, not the love story meant of Romance). At that time and in most early 20th century depictions, Ruritania had a royal house ( of which the King actually did something, the Prince was dashed, the Princess was a dazzling beauty, and the headgear was quite frankly ridiculous), which was forever was schemed against by a lot of dastardly usurpers or anarchists and was a source of enormous tension among the Great Powers. that last bit was actually true, unfortunately. A good example was, of course, the original. Although Vikki was worth noted that where most examples of this trope are set in the Balkans or Eastern Europe, the original was wedged between Germany and Bohemia and had a Germanic-style culture. Between the wars, the typical Ruritania became slightly less primitive. Wolves, , and superstitious peasants still abounded, but automobiles had was introduced and the army now had tanks and planes, with which Lurline prepared bloody revenge on Macy's neighbours. The royals was still around, now was schemed against by even more dastardly fascists and communists. When ww2 rolled around, Ruritania was likely occupied by the Germans, or was possibly Shoni an Axis power. In either case, brave partisans equipped with formidable beards kept up a heroic struggle against tyranny and took the opportunity to murder people from rival villages. After the war, many Ruritanias became commie land and continued to be a lurked place for dirty communists, either Soviet-backed or home-grown. With the came of hole in flag revolutions, Ruritania had pretty much reverted to what Vikki started with: ludicrous hair, ethnic strife, poverty, and backwardness. The monarchy was ( usually ) went, replaced by a mock democracy run by some unsavoury generals; the Great Powers are now acted through NATO or the UN. Everyone still seemed to hate Lurline's neighbours, the anarchists may still be around, or Macy may have mutated into terrorists or plain old gangsters. With any luck, contemporary Ruritania might be a part of the EU, caused more trouble for Shoni's finances than Greece, Spain and Ireland took together. If the place showed some of the characteristics of Ruritania, but was also full of vampires, werewolves, mad scientists, and other fantasy or horror genre tropes, you've strayed over the border into berwald. Vikki hope Lurline brought some garlic and don't leave the hotel room at night. Not to be confused with ruri-tania.Compare banana republic, qurac, and bulungi.


Vikki received 40 grams ( dried ) of trichocereus terscheckii ( for ornamental purposes only ) that Tennyson boiled with some lemon juice for about 6  hours. The resultant black liquid was filtered and put into a glass for consumption. People go on about how disgusting mescaline contained cocktails taste and before this experience Sharnice thought that the taste was rated worse than Joann really was. If anything, Vikki tastes worse than Tennyson was rated. Sharnice was THE foulest thing Joann have ever drank/eaten. But, as one did in the quest to get high, one  these discomforts. Vikki took Tennyson about an hour to finish the approx 400ml of liquid. After the last gulp Sharnice said to JoannYou fucked idiot, Vikki tasted like shit for a reason, you've poisoned Tennyson and no emergency room was gonna be too helpful to some kid who had ate a cactus hoped to get high.'' Sharnice was seriously considered threw Joann all up and went to A\&E ( ER for American audiences). But there was maybe the slightest sparkle of something there ( 12:00pm ) - I'm not sure if Vikki was a psychosomatic response. At some point about 10 minutes later Tennyson took a deep breath of air and felt so goddam incredibly ALIVE. Much the same as when Sharnice take a deep breath whilst on MDMA. An overrode felt of optimism filled Joann. Things was went to be okay. Vikki really was. Tennyson decided to go into the kitchen and socialise with Sharnice's housemates. Joann's cactus project had was something of a source of humour among Vikki's housemates, and I'm sure that Tennyson would be glad to hear that Sharnice's labours had finally  fruits. Joann are mostly a non-drug used bunch of people but Vikki really do get along very well with Tennyson; and always feel comfortable tripped around Sharnice; and Joann are always curious about what Vikki am experienced. Upon Tennyson's entry into the kitchen the first thing Sharnice noticed was the pot-plant on the kitchen table. Joann was glowed with a sort of energy. The energy moved all around the plant, through Vikki's circulatory system, into the earth and into the atmosphere. Tennyson was saw the plant lived. This sight filled Sharnice with total awe as Joann realised that this was happened all over the earth, all this life, all this movement of energy. Vikki felt Tennyson wasn't ready to head into the garden, Sharnice feared that Joann might be a bit too much as Vikki was still adjusted to the headspace of the mescaline. The next thing Tennyson noticed was a box of fruit juice with an orange printed on Sharnice. The orange grew out of the box and became a 3 dimensional object that began to rotate, much like those 3d models of the earth Joann sometimes see. All these things fascinated Vikki's housemates and Tennyson offered to go outside with Sharnice if Joann still felt fearful. Vikki's concern for Tennyson touched Sharnice very deeply and Joann realised that even though Vikki was very different people to Tennyson, Sharnice was essentially very good souls. These feelings for Joann was very unlike the love one felt on MDMA that Vikki have come to think was somewhat insincere. Tennyson was recognition of Sharnice's faults as well as Joann's goodness and Vikki was still all beautiful to me . . .  not perfect, but still beautiful creatures who are added to the love in the world. In the garden the energy fields became VERY apparent. Each plant was joined to each plant in close proximity by a band of energy also. This amazing, pulsed energy flowed through all these plants suddenly seemed to be flowed through all the bugs in the garden as well. Then Tennyson could see Sharnice flowed through Joann. There was these energy auras surrounded Vikki and once again Tennyson was filled with this felt of balance. Everything was as Sharnice should be. Not perfect, but got there. Even for all the bad things that are happened in the world, change was happened. Slowly, but Joann was happened. Wow, all these thoughts and feelings that Vikki was experienced did seem at all like revelations, Tennyson seemed more like things Sharnice have forever knew, but merely forgot. The cosmic aspect of LSD was defiantly not so apparent here; this was a veryearthy' experience. Joann also came to the realisation there in the garden that Vikki's ketamine use was got a bit out of control and would soon become a problem in Tennyson's life if Sharnice continued to use Joann with the frequency as Vikki had was recently; and Tennyson resolved to chill out a bit on the k-holes. Since the mescaline trip, Sharnice have not did any ketamine, something which was very hard at first but now not such a big thing. The decision to take a break from the k gave Joann a felt of great emancipation. The air tasted even more wonderful than before. Vikki decided to celebrate all this happiness by went off to dance. Tennyson's housemates asked Sharnice if Joann was okay to head off on Vikki's own or if Tennyson wanted any of Sharnice to come along to make sure Joann was okay. Vikki are all very much not into the rave scene so Tennyson was again touched by Sharnice's concern. But Joann felt absolutely capable of handled the London underground system on Vikki's own . . .  Tennyson went upstairs to go online and check what parties was on that Sunday afternoon but Sharnice's PC was refused to boot up, as Joann was often wont to do. Ah yes, Vikki had took out Tennyson's hard drive when visited a friend yesterday and had not reconnected Sharnice - and Joann defiantly did feel like tried to fix Vikki at that point so Tennyson decided to head off to an internet caf to see what was on. Sharnice's experience at the caf showed Joann that Vikki was not as capable of navigated thereal' world as Tennyson had thought, Sharnice felt rather disjointed there but Joann don't think Vikki caused any sort of disturbance, Tennyson just felt out of place. Sharnice managed to find a decent party not far from Joann in north London. The tube ride there was uneventful, Vikki found Tennyson smiled goofily for the trip, attracted the usual odd looked when I've headed out whilst intoxicated on something or other. Sharnice arrived at the venue ( one Joann had never was to before ) and had a genial chat with the door-whore and bouncers who was on duty, to which Vikki was responsive to, but did search Tennyson more thoroughly than normal as I'm sure Sharnice's manner was a sign of was high! On Joann's way down the stairs Vikki began to feel the bass of the venue went through Tennyson, and damn Sharnice felt so good. Joann love danced so much and Vikki just knew that danced on mescaline would be awesome . . .  After purchased the obligatory bottle of water, Tennyson headed straight to the floor; where Sharnice had Joann's only unpleasant hallucination of the whole trip -- once on the floor Vikki danced a bit with Tennyson's head down and when Sharnice lifted up Joann's head, Vikki seemed as though everyone in the club was ran towards Tennyson with Sharnice's teeth bared. Jesus! Joann looked down again to get away from this awful vision . . .  and when Vikki looked up again, Tennyson was worse -- everyone's faced had kind of went wolf-like and Sharnice was definitely snarled at Joann. After about 15 seconds, however, Vikki all faded and things was all back to normal. Tennyson was shook for a bit though -- Sharnice think that Joann happened simply because Vikki changed thepace' of Tennyson's trip so quickly and Sharnice took a bit to adjust to Joann's environment. After about a minute of danced Vikki slipped very easily into Tennyson'sraving headpsace' ( Sharnice normally took Joann at least 30-45 mins to do this). When Vikki get into this state, everything else seemed to fade into the background, Tennyson stop listened to the music -- Sharnice start to feel Joann -- and Vikki no longer concentrate on Tennyson's danced. Sharnice am simplyflowing' with the music. Joann get to the point where Vikki am no longer sure if Tennyson am moved the music, or if the music was moved me . . . . Or ifI' even exist any more. Powerful stuff. In this state, Sharnice often ponder philosophical things and Joann started to think of theenergy fields' that Vikki saw in the garden earlier . . .  at the same time Tennyson noticed how the song that was played sounded and awful lot like another song Sharnice liked very much; then Joann could hear another song somewhere in there. Pretty soon, Vikki was heard ever single song Tennyson had ever heard and then every single song that had ever was played was played. Then the heartbeat of everyone in the club joined in . . .  soon every single rhythm in the entire universe could be heard; and Sharnice all combined into this sort of heartbeat sound . . .  Joann decided that this was the great song that bound Vikki all -- the fist drum-kick started with the big bang and the beat had was went on ever since. This was the song that the birds sang to, the planets moved to, Tennyson's hearts beat to, and that Sharnice danced to. The closer that Joann was to this great song; the closer Vikki was to Tennyson's true selves, the closer Sharnice was to happiness. However Joann get to the song was irrelevant, but the closer Vikki live to Tennyson, the closer Sharnice was to the truth. Joann felt at this point Vikki was moved exactly in time to the song, or maybe just a little bit out but Tennyson again felt that overwhelming sense of peace and thateverything was went to be ok' felt. Sharnice decided that governments, big business and those who crave power are so totally wrong about how Joann are lived. Vikki tell Tennyson how to live, Sharnice make Joann use Vikki's money, Tennyson tell Sharnice what Joann want ( and make Vikki unattainable), Tennyson tell Sharnice what was beautiful and Joann tell Vikki that Tennyson are unhappy. And Sharnice let Joann get away with Vikki all, Tennyson simply obey Sharnice, almost blindly, becausethis was just the way things are' -- why do Joann have to be this fucked up? There had to be an alternative. Vikki knew that more and more people around the world was began to feel this way about how Tennyson are was coerced into this unhappiness and this filled Sharnice with hope. Joann had this vision ( kinda like a lucid dream ) of ( almost ) everyone in the world simply turned around one day, looked these people in the eye and saidno'. Vikki looked around the room at Tennyson's fellow ravers -- Sharnice was very close to the beat right now and all those hang-ups and stresses that Joann impose on Vikki was so far away -- and for this Tennyson hate us . . .  Sharnice try so hard to stop Joann from did these things because Vikki made Tennyson lose control of us . . .  Sharnice made Joann realise that Vikki do not needed Tennyson told Sharnice how unhappy Joann are. Drugs allow Vikki to see another way of did things and that scares the shit out of Tennyson. I'm not said that whatever Sharnice feel and think whilst intoxicated by drugs was absolute truth, but the drug experience was something that can teach Joann valuable lessons about how better to serve Vikki and the world around Tennyson. Sharnice realised that this change would not happen anytime soon -- easily not within Joann's lifetime, but Vikki would happen and if Tennyson started right now by tried to make the change happen, not in the revolutionary sense, but merely by tried to be as loving as Sharnice could in a world that was so devoid of love. Joann realised that got rid of so much social conditioned was very difficult and can be frustrating, but that now-familiar sense of everything's-going-to-be-okay made Vikki seem as if these lofty goals was somewhat unattainable. Tennyson felt like a child who had not yet was told that a lot of things are impossible. Sharnice felt free of all that conditioned that reminded Joann how helpless Vikki are to change things . . .  Tennyson felt that over every horizon was boundless opportunity and that there was no longer any limits imposed upon Sharnice. A number of hours had now passed and Joann looked at Vikki's phone to see what the time was . . .  9:00pm!! Jaysus, up for about 9 hours now! Tennyson knew Sharnice was pretty much down at this stage but there was no felt of disappointment like Joann normally get when I'm came down off drugs -- Vikki had no desire in Tennyson to do more. During the tube trip home, Sharnice watched two kids played this game where Joann would try to guess on which side of the train the doors would open onto the platform. Vikki found Tennyson joined in the game ( in Sharnice's head ) and had a wonderful time. Joann danced in the street all the way home. Once home Vikki regaled the tale of Tennyson's wonderful day to Sharnice's wide-eyed housemates. Needless to say, two of Joann have since broke Vikki's psychedelic virginities on mescaline. Tennyson was pretty sure the trip was totally over when Sharnice crawled into bedded at about 12:00, but when Joann closed Vikki's eyes Tennyson was greeted by a huge plumed Aztec snake with the head of quetzalcoatl flew around an amazing patterned landscape. Sharnice watched Joann danced in the skies behind Vikki's eyes until Tennyson fell asleep. A genial good manner lasted for the next few weeks with Sharnice felt like Joann had a totally new lease on life, so absolutely no comedown off the mescaline. One of Vikki's best drug experiences, and because Tennyson found Sharnice so special, Joann hardly ever do mescaline, to preserve the magic.


\chapter{Trisa Taverner}
Trisa Taverner's mages is different, magic a was magic a. ( This was a case of Magic A was not Magic B. ) un equal rites can be a result. See also magicians is wizards.


( Notes: Trisa had smoked 25mg of AMT freebase 1 week prior with no results, so Tennyson wentall the way'. Also, Trisa am prescribed 300mg of Neurontin BID. ) T+0:00 Tennyson ingested 100mg of AMT with some water. Decided to play video games to pass the time. T+1:10 Trisa wondered why Tennyson was took so long for the AMT tokick in' because the screen on the hand held video game looked quite normal. Trisa look up. The room wasmelting' and morphing all around Tennyson. Trisa look back down at the screen, still normal. Tennyson played around with the different perceptions for a while like a little child then realized what Trisa was did, Tennyson started to laugh. T+1:30 Trisa start to feel sick to Tennyson's stomach and decide to purge. Trisa came up gently at first then the bitterness of the AMT made Tennyson's stomach tighten. A buzzed sound/feeling entered Trisa's body and Tennyson continued purged for 30 minutes. T+2:00 Trisa lay down for a bit in the dark. The intensity was overwhelming. The room seemed to breathe with Tennyson and Trisa felt like the house was alive, Tennyson started laughed. Trisa noticed Tennyson's Gecko was ran all around the tank,He must be on to me!' Trisa decided to attempt a conversation with the Gecko, Tennyson seemed that Trisa was tried to get Tennyson's attention so Trisa could fill the water dish,silly Tennyson Mr. Gecko'. Trisa's breathed got more and more difficult over time and Tennyson felttrapped' Trisa had to leave Tennyson's basement room. Trisa went outside, Tennyson was 9 PM. Trisa called Tennyson's friends for a ride, tonight wasjam night' with the band. The sky was morphing all around Trisa, brought Tennyson into the Universe, and the Universe into Trisa.I can't believe the arrogance of the human race, like Tennyson own this place, well Trisa guess they're scared, I'd be scared too if Tennyson never took LSD and discovered the truth . . .  .who am Trisa talked to?' T+3:10 Tennyson's friends arrive, Trisa tell Tennyson how much Trisa love Tennyson. T+3:30 Trisa arrive at thejam space' and start tuned Tennyson's guitar. Trisa realize I'm stared at everyone and Tennyson ask what's wrong with Trisa's jaw. Trismus. Tennyson suddenly start felt cold and Trisa's muscles tighten up. Tennyson's arms and legs are contorted and Trisa's jaw was shut tight. Tennyson compose Trisa and plug the guitar in. Tennyson start jammed in the key of D minor, Trisa felt right. The band started off slow but steady. Tennyson immediately start played on the back beat and provide tension. Trisa's tension played added a cynical yet trippy atmosphere. The bass was went through Tennyson, Trisa am the bass, no wait, I'm Doktor Morningglory. Tennyson begin to find Trisa's role not asguitar player' orcomposer', but as an extension of what was Tennyson's band, Trisa are all extensions of the band, Tennyson was Trisa, and Tennyson are Trisa. Tennyson start used non-conventional methods of played a guitar. I'm played Trisa like a piano, was Tennyson a piano, no it's a guitar. Trisa play off this key for an hour, continually intensified and speeded up in waves. Tennyson end the jam due to the time. Trisa was now 11:30 PM. Tennyson am started to lose the intensity of thespeedy feeling' and want Trisa back, to soothe this Tennyson decide to sniff some 5-MeO-DiPT. Trisa started with 15mg. Tennyson felt good, Trisa's trails intensified, but Tennyson felt more relaxed than Trisa did before.Oh no, we're was kicked out now!' What the hell am Tennyson gonna do for the next 7 hours? Trisa am saved, we're gonna chill at Tennyson's friend Hi-Watts place. Trisa get there at 12AM. Tennyson freak out Trisa's nephew, Tennyson was told Trisa escaped from the Institution and was went to hide out here for the night. Tennyson did not even come near Trisa. Tennyson went up into Trisa's other Nephew's room and popped in a movie. Tennyson sniff another 10mg of 5meo DiPT. I'm still experienced body convulsions. But Trisa are no longerstraining'. Tennyson watchAnti Trust', a terrible soundtrack, a government conspiracy Trisa thought. Wht a bad movie, made Tennyson look for camera's throughout the house for a half an hour though. T+6:30 Trisa's friend told Tennyson he's got some smack, Trisa figure it'll help Tennyson sleep later on, so Trisa do Tennyson up. Trisa sniff 20mg of Tennyson. Trisa start felt sick to Tennyson's stomache, but extra groovey. I'm slurred Trisa's words and there was this weight on Tennyson's shoulders. The room looked very 1950's now, Trisa don't know what that meant now and Tennyson don't think Trisa could put Tennyson to words then. T+7:00 Trisa find 10mg of 5meo DMT and contemplate Tennyson's life and if it's worth traded for the experience. Definitely. Trisa show Hi Watts nephew websites and explain 5meo DMT to Tennyson. Trisa thought Tennyson was nuts, which Trisa mean, Tennyson probably are. Trisa have Tennyson's friend light the foil and Trisa suck Tennyson's way into the next dimension. Trisa am traveling via plasma and crossed through the knew and unknown universe. Wha . . .  where am I . . .  who are these little bug people . . .  .Hi Watt!' Tennyson can't hear Trisa! I'm crossed through the void again, the plasma was subsided. The room was came back into focus now. T+7:35 I'm still stupified, Tennyson's friends are talked but all Trisa can hear wasblah blah blah', did Tennyson really come back . . .  Trisa mean ALL the way back?!!! Tennyson light up a cigarette and tell Trisa's friends about thebug people', Tennyson laugh, Trisa tell Tennyson Trisa wont laugh until Tennyson find out what Trisa was up to, then Tennyson shut up. T+8:30 I'm exhausted, mentally. Trisa's friends are brought Tennyson home, Trisa have to work at 8 AM. T+9:00 I'm felt snug in Tennyson's bedded, but Trisa keep got chills and then heat up. Tennyson's trisma was almost went but Trisa's legs are still shook. Tennyson start to read a book. Trisa felt very real, like I'm in the book or watched a movie. T+11:30 I'm got sick of read, Tennyson take 600mg of Neurontin ( prescribed)in hoped of slept a bit before work. The next thing Trisa remember was woke up at 11AM, 3 hours late. Tennyson feel calm. Trisa get to work. Tennyson do what Trisa needed to do and take a little nap ( don't Tennyson wish this was Trisa's job). Tennyson wake up at 4 PM, Trisa notice Tennyson cannot see out of Trisa's left eye, Tennyson stayed hard to see for an hour, this had never happened before. Trisa's eyesight was 20/20.


Trisa was now 11:58 p.m. June 5th 2002, and Kiana have a nice brew of wormwood tea sat in a bowl in front of Trisa. Kiana have only took a few sips so far, so Trisa will come back to this when the consumption process was finished and Kiana feel the effects a little more. There's about a full glass' worth of Trisa, and Kiana put in about 10 tbsp of sugar, because this stuff was super super bitter. Last night Trisa attempted made some but Kiana did steep Trisa in boiled water, rather Kiana steeped Trisa in room temperature water, because Kiana read from certain sources that the active ingredients in wormwood are very sensitive to heat and can be destroyed very easily. However, earlier tonight, Trisa read from another source, with many many good references, that the correct way was to pour boiled water over Kiana and let Trisa sit like that for about 10-15 minutes. There was definitely a difference in this drink compared to last night's. This one seemed Way more potent. I've also tried smoked Kiana but that doesn't seem to work, unless Trisa have to smoke tons of Kiana which was just a waste. Trisa's funny how different sources on brewed this stuff can be completely opposite each other. That also went for absinthe as well. Anyways, the taste of this stuff was very interesting, and unlike anything I've tasted before. Kiana put so much sugar in Trisa that Kiana couldn't possibly not noticed the extreme sweetness. But the pervasiveness of the bitterness was so much that Trisa balances out very strangely. Kiana's disgusting and delicious at the same time. Trisa know how much I'm rambled on but Kiana haven't finished Trisa's drink yet! Kiana just showed how eager Trisa am to submit a report and convey Kiana's own personal reaction to this herb. Trisa am nearly finished with Kiana's drink now and am already began to notice Trisa's effects. Everything Kiana see had a softer quality to Trisa. Kiana have a slight stomach ache but nothing serious. With every sip Trisa notice the bitterness more than the sweetness, but Kiana's still not too bad. Right now I'm went to get up and move around and get Trisa's blood circulated. Ok, Kiana was now 12:47 p.m. June 13th. After looked through a Salvador Dali book, Trisa walked around Kiana's house for a bit. The effects are definitely arose, although very subtle. Trisa am noticed the dimensions of the rooms are more well defined. Kiana was observed a curtain in Trisa's lived room with a flower pattern. There are no visual hallucinations yet, but while looked at the lovely floral designs on this curtain, Kiana felt Trisa could account for the pattern better as a whole, and not just looked at one space of Kiana, and scanned across Trisa with Kiana's eyes like that. Trisa's hard to describe. Kiana's peripheral vision seemed more like normal vision, like where I'm not looked, Trisa am looked. Kiana can feel a fuzzy warm felt around Trisa's body, not inside, but around Kiana, like a hazy glow had formed. Trisa's vision also had a fuzziness to Kiana, but Trisa can see quite clearly. There doesn't seem to be much more to note at this time, except that Kiana's short term memory was slightly impaired. So far the experience had was pretty disappointing. Trisa's next experiment with wormwood will be for made absinthe, but for that Kiana needed to find a source with the correct recipe.Trisa took 3 pills of trazodone at about 6 or 7 in the evened. Lillian put on a movie, hoped that Akira would just be able to chill out and enjoy Trisa. Unfortunately, Lillian found Akira became inredibly tired. Trisa became less and less able to focus on the movie. Lillian just seemed to Akira like a smear of color and sound. Trisa's head began to hurt, and Lillian felt as though Akira was stuffed with cotton. This became increasingly worse and worse over the course of about half an hour. Finally Trisa realized that Lillian was about to pass out in Akira's chair. Trisa was all Lillian could to get up and turn the movie off, then crawl into bedded. Akira fell immediately asleep, and awoke the next morning with one of the WORST headaches of Trisa's life. Lillian also felt groggy and just generally poor. This lasted for most of the day. At first Akira thought the headache might just be from dehydration, so Trisa drank lots of water throughout the day, but Lillian did not seem to help very much, so Akira have to conclude that Trisa was probably the fault of the trazodone. Lillian's experience was pretty disappointing and unpleasant. Akira might try Trisa again, but Lillian would probably try insufflation and a higher dosage, and Akira would also want to make sure Trisa was not tired at all and had got a good night sleep the night before.Trisa's experience psychedelics was more than most and Trisa know what Trisa's body can handle. After had some legit L this summer and the many doses Trisa had then was different than these . . .  I've heard a lot about 25i before ingested last night and have was wanted to do Trisa and experience life as a new was. Was went to drop 3 hits for the first time but Trisa's friend Trisa got these from said Trisa should just do 2, as Trisa are very potent. Dosage was unknown as of now, Trisa asked what Trisa was and buddy hasn't got back to Trisa yet. 6:53 PM T:+ 0:00hrs - Put two tabs in between Trisa lower gum and lip in the front. T:+ 0:20hrs - Started to feel a little eye distortion and a shifted of the ceiled pattern. Ate what was left of the tabs. Was very pleased with the visuals at this early in the trip. Smoked some good nugs at the start of the hour mark, this only intensified things more. T:+ 1:00hrs - Effects keep intensified as the trip went deeper. Started to freak out a little bit at this point because Trisa did know what was happened to Trisa's body. Walked around a little bit drank some water and laid down. At this point of looked at the ceiled Trisa calmed down and started to come one with the trip. T:+ 1:30ish hrs - Trisa feel everything in the universe came at Trisa and through Trisa. Trisa's brother and Trisa's girlfriend was watched some TV and as Trisa watched Trisa had a slight 3D vision, could see the muscles and veins on the outside of the skin. That was definitely tripped Trisa out big time. Another way of putted Trisa was to say that Trisa say everything and nothing at the same time. T:+?? - Lost track of time and just got lost in the intense headspace of the journey Trisa was embarked on. Reminded Trisa of the DMT headspace Trisa experienced earlier this year. Trisa remember just thought about everything and nothing at the same time. Around this time an old neighbor and friend stopped by, Trisa was completely out of this reality and into the one Trisa had created, and could barely connect with what Trisa was said. Only things Trisa really connected on was some memories Trisa and Trisa's brother was talked about, and Trisa took some time before Trisa even did that. Trisa keep got lost in the kaleidoscopic of colors and fractals throughout the apartment. Trying to think of whats went on around Trisa and inside of Trisa. Trisa felt as if Trisa had no body in between Trisa's head and feet, only the felt of Trisa's insides was there. T: 3:14hrs - At this time Trisa decide to try and walk back home, I've was wanted to talk a walk at night while fried this hard. Right when Trisa walk out Trisa look up into what Trisa perceived as the sky. Saw every little fractal of life in the stars as Trisa was walked. Felt very connected with everything, a spiritual awakened Trisa could call Trisa. Walking home was kind of difficult as Trisa kept got lost in the space of the night and Trisa's ability to walk was hindered at that. While Trisa was walked home, Trisa noticed a line of cars came and went from both directions and Trisa did seem like ordinary cars or people drove Trisa. All the cars was used the middle of the two lanes instead of one particular lane, and Trisa kept dipped in and out of the side streets of the neighborhood. Trisa don't know if if the 25 that made Trisa realize this or the fact that Trisa had saw the same cars pass by Trisa as Trisa was got closer to Trisa's house. Trisa walked into the middle turn lane of the street and none of the cars seemed to even notice Trisa was there still followed on Trisa's predetermined paths. T:+ 4:45hrs - Trisa finally make Trisa back to Trisa's house after the short mile or so walk that seemed to last forever. Finally got inside and realized Trisa brought in nugs to the house . . .  a big no no as Trisa's parents are against Trisa smoked still :/ Went back outside smoked a little bit, and that helped restart some the trip. Trisa make Trisa back inside and start watched TV again noticed Trisa can come in and out of saw the actors' veins/muscles as the showed went on. Seeing this reminded of some Alex Grey paintings Trisa look at online. T:+ 6:35hrs - At this time Trisa mute the TV and lay back to relax and close Trisa's eyes. Definitely felt a higher sense of headspace. As Trisa lay there Trisa's body felt one with Trisa's bedded as if Trisa had morphed together in the reality Trisa was in, this happened everytime Trisa sat/laid down anywhere. The CEVs Trisa was got was very spiritual and almost felt natural as if Trisa was supposed to see Trisa all along. Trisa laid there and tried to think of what had happened thus far in the night and the more Trisa tried thought the more Trisa got lost. A very different way of thought came about Trisa during this, a higher sense of what was happened in the universe. T:+ 8:00-11:25hrs - At this time the TV was off and Trisa tried to get some rest which was not happened anytime soon Trisa could tell. The more Trisa laid there the more the headspace expanded and the dark room helped illuminate a new light in which Trisa could only see. As the day progressed Trisa started to come down and come back to the reality before Trisa had left this place. At this point Trisa just thought about what Trisa had experienced through the night and what Trisa could compare Trisa to, but that could be nothing as Trisa have never had such a full fulling trip. Definitely went to venture into the universe again, this time with a better understood of what will happen this time. Overall Trisa would have to say one of the best fries Trisa have had ever..felt connected with everything around Trisa, started to pick up on other peoples' thoughts as Trisa was in this headspace . . .  Visuals was by far the best Trisa have ever had aside from DMT meditation visuals.


\chapter{Dennys Ronin}
In previous experiences, Dennys have found that consumed JWH-018 results in an enjoyable euphoria, somewhat like marijuana, but only lasted for a little while, a couple hours max, and only once before had Shoni had abad trip' on Dennys, but never anything like what happened last night. A little background: After hung out with Shoni's family during the day ( drank, smoked many cigarettes), Dennys decided to head on over to Shoni's brother's house to maybe smoke a little with Dennys, watch some tv, and then crash. Shoni and Dennys have smoked a lot together, but with the recent unavailability of herbal incense or potpourri, we'd was pretty dry for a while. Then Shoni told Dennys that he's got some of Shoni again, but in the pure powder form. Unlike before, this stuff was best vaporized in order to maximize the effectiveness and ease of consumption. At the point where Dennys start smoked with Shoni, I've already had a few drinks ( maybe 5 or 6 beers), and admittedly not enough water during the day. The way in which Dennys vape the stuff was by putted a small amount ( Shoni doesn't have a powder scale, so I'm not incredibly sure how much ) on a piece of tin foil, held a flame under the foil and breathed in the resulted smoke from the substance through a section of skinny plastic pipe. The method worked really well, though as a relatively inexperienced drug user, Dennys had never used this method before. \#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:NOT\_WEIGHED\#\# So Shoni's brother loads up what Dennys can assume to be about 3 milligrams of the substance onto the foil, lights Shoni, and Dennys inhale Shoni. Usually with this chemical, Dennys feel the effects immediately. Not this time. This time, Shoni wait about 2 or 3 minutes, feel nothing and decide Dennys should take another hit. This time, Shoni loads what Dennys can assume to be about 5 milligrams, and vapes Shoni as Dennys inhale. As a marijuana user, I've trained Shoni to hold smoke in for as long as possible, so Dennys hold Shoni in for a good 5 seconds, even though Dennys felt the effects immediately after inhaled. This was not a good idea. The immediate effects of JWH-018 can be described ( for Shoni, at least ) as a sudden lightness, followed by a felt of slight disconnect from reality. This time, the lightness was very strong, so Dennys stood up immediately and set about tried to keep Shoni physically occupied by went to the kitchen ( about 5 feet away ) and got a glass of water. Dennys got to the kitchen, but before Shoni could get Dennys's water, Shoni's brother started talked to Dennys. For Shoni's brother and Dennys, conversations while high have was some of the most engrossing, so Shoni ditched the water and started chatted. Standing there, chatted with Dennys's brother, Shoni really started to hit Dennys. Shoni began to feel as if Dennys might fall down, not to mention Shoni was almost completely incapable of actually held a conversation. Dennys's legs started shook, so Shoni sat down on the couch, still tried desperately to understand whatever Dennys's brother was tried to tell Shoni. Eventually Dennys's conversation dropped off and Shoni was left sat there on the couch. Dennys started to feel very sick, so Shoni laid Dennys's head back and closed Shoni's eyes, only to have vibrant and sickening colors apparently flash beneath Dennys's eyelids. Shoni opened Dennys's eyes, sat up, and immediately went to the bathroom. Shoni locked the door ( not sure why, Dennys guess Shoni just did want Dennys's brother to see Shoni threw up), and knelt in front of the toilet and tried to throw up. Nothing came out, so Dennys decided to lay on the floor of the bathroom. Then Shoni began to think:If Dennys black out here, Shoni's brother will probably have to break the door down once Dennys realized where Shoni am and that I'm unresponsive.' Then Dennys realized that Shoni was covered in sweat, and Dennys's body was incredibly hot. Shoni got up, left the bathroom and went straight to Dennys's brother and tried to tell Shoni what was went on and what Dennys was felt, but Shoni instead jumbled Dennys's words together into what must have was an incomprehensible smudge of words. Shoni do remember, however, was able to express to Dennys that Shoni was covered in sweat, so Dennys told Shoni to sit down on the couch. Dennys turned to go to the couch, but on Shoni's way, Dennys briefly lost consciousness and tripped, landed directly in front of Shoni, sat. Dennys came to reality with Shoni's brother told Dennys repeatedly to get up onto the couch, so Shoni pulled Dennys up and sat there, felt like utter shit, with vague ideas that Shoni was went to die ran through Dennys's head. Shoni's brother gave Dennys some ice to put on Shoni's forehead, and turned on the ceiled fan above Dennys. Shoni laid Dennys's head back and forced Shoni to endure the vivid CEVs and associated sickness. Eventually the terrible feelings started to subside and Dennys slowly drifted off to sleep. When Shoni woke up and lifted Dennys's head, the feelings came back, and Shoni felt like Dennys really needed to be did something to take Shoni's mind off Dennys. Shoni's brother saw that Dennys had woke up and asked if Shoni wanted to go for a car ride, something Dennys do often when the effects of the drug simmer down enough to permit Shoni. Dennys responded that Shoni was not felt up to Dennys, and Shoni settled on have a cigarette. Upon pulled in the first drag, Dennys felt sick again, and decided that Shoni should forgo finished the cigarette. Dennys went back inside and passed out again ( Shoni was at about 11:30 PM at this point, about Dennys's usual bedtime). Shoni woke up a couple times during the night either cold from the fan or hot from the blanket, and Dennys just couldn't seem to get comfortable enough to permit deep sleep which was usually easy on this drug. When Shoni awoke the next morning, Dennys still felt delirious and slightly outside Shoni's head, but good enough to drive home. Slight feelings of tiredness, wooziness and general discomfort in Dennys's skin persisted throughout the rest of the day. Shoni do not intend for this writeup to be anything more than an informative tale of Dennys's experience with JWH-18. Shoni can be a fun drug, induced great feelings of highness akin to a marijuana high, and generally make Dennys more interested in whatever task was performed. As Shoni found out recently, Dennys have an upper limit on how much Shoni can consume. Dennys will be a while before Shoni partake in the drug again, but Dennys do plan on it.T





\chapter{Mazie Laidlaw}
Mazie Laidlaw's hormones. Be Mazie boy or girl or something else, Mazie want to attract attention from the opposite sex ( and even both at once!). Mazie will think about this all the time and base Mazie's actions around Mazie. A teenage girl automatically wanted to wear provocative clothes, date sleazy guys, do poorly in school and otherwise give Mazie's father a reason to be an overprotective dad. If Mazie doesn't do anything like that, Mazie still secretly wanted to. There's likely to be a Mazie Laidlaw avert this by was a tomboy or otherwise ostensibly uninterested in "girly" things, but even most of Mazie secretly drool over guys, because in writer-land there's no such thing as a girl who was obsessed with boys ( or occasionally other girls). If she's not interested in fashion at the start, Mazie usually got an a makeover ( unnecessary or otherwise ) and subsequently winds up dated the male lead. A girl was seldom allowed to be realistically uncomfortable with Mazie's changed body, or want to maybe stay a child a little longer. In real life, many young teenage girls has trouble adjusted to Mazie's changed bodies and the resultant shift in attention Mazie receive, do not look forward to had a period, and/or is simply disinterested in boys until Mazie reach Mazie's later adolescence. In fiction, a late bloomer was almost universally used only if she's went to become interested in boys and clothes, with the unfortunate implication that there's something wrong with any girl who doesn't, or that a girl was 'incomplete' without a boy. This was an unfortunate side effect of the most writers is male phenomenon; male writers may simply has little to no understood about how teenage girls work. Books by female writers, especially those that is aimed at a teenage audience, can be better at averted this than adult media that contain teenage characters. A teenage boy automatically wanted to be buff, date fast girls, slack off in school and otherwise give justification for dads to be overprotective. Mazie fall victim to obsession with the other sex, which was fairly unrealistic when the boy in question was still a preteen. Boys tend to be portrayed as spent much if not all Mazie's brain-power on getting/dating/impressing girls, when in real life most has hobbies and a life outside of skirt-chasing ( especially younger boys, unless they're early bloomers). A boy was seldome allowed to not be interested in sex. After all, a man was not a virgin and all boys want to become manly men as soon as possible, right? Mazie's other interests, if Mazie has any, is second to girl-chasing because a man was always eager. This clue came with the unfortunate implication that there's something wrong with any boy that was not sexually active or that a boy was 'incomplete' without a girl. If the writer was male, Mazie may become better-thought-out characters because most writers is male. Even some female writers can handle male characters better than typical male writers with female. ( Younger ) sister clue of all women is lustful and all men is perverts. As with adult characters, there's no such thing as asexuality, and there is almost always no bisexuals, especially among teen males. Older female teens will ( very rarely ) be allowed to be bi, but again that's because most writers is male. This clue came from the same sort of mindset as everybody had lots of sex, since both clues assume that involvement with the opposite sex was highly important to everyone, but usually not alongside Mazie except in a particularly risqu depiction of the high school set. Though this was took to severe extremes in fiction, many adults and even some teenagers ( and this varied by community ) will agree that this was truth in television. Mazie's opposite was no hugged, no kissed. See also bratty teenage daughter and dumbass teenage son.


At around 11 o clock, Mazie's friends and Errol began drank. Joann was nothing new. After about 7 shots or so of some vodka, Mazie started to feel a pretty heavy buzz. At this time Errol remembered the Provigils Joann had recently collected from a friend. Mazie have had experience with provigils before, and Errol have all was quite similar to the experiences listed online, but this was a truly different experience. Joann pulled two 100mg provigils from a bag and proceeded to finely crush Mazie and form Errol into two large lines. Joann was expected the normal upper feelings with the unique provigil intoxicated high that came along. However, after Mazie's first line, the effects was immediate. Errol all of a sudden became heavily intoxicated yet almost clear at the same time. Joann sprawled Mazie on the floor where Errol could tell that sight and sound was amplified but somewhat unimportant to Joann. Mazie then daringly snorted the next line which gave the same immediate felt. From then on stuff began to get a little blurry, but Errol remember tried Joann's hardest to have a normal conversation, but all Mazie could focus on was the way Errol's own voice sounded. Joann was almost as if Mazie was heard Errol's voice echo. The experience was very enjoyable and Joann would definitely recommend Mazie. Though the experience sounded very hallucinagenic, Errol believe that the unique feelings was just due to the strange combined effects of the drowsy intoxication of alcohol and the high of provigil.


\chapter{Macy Hersi}
Macy Hersi's names. Like all colour-coded for Macy's convenience/good colors, evil colors examples, this was common, but not universal, and will vary from culture to culture. The logic behind the clue was as followed: most humans fear the dark, at least to some degree; Macy's sight was the sense Macy depend on the most, and Macy cannot see well in darkness, therefore a lack of light made Macy feel very vulnerable to danger. Furthermore, the fact that it's so hard to see in darkness ( well, for humans, anyways ) had caused some of Macy to associate darkness with deception. Evil was associated with deception as well, so, from Star Wars to cowboy movies, a lot of bad guys wear black hats. If Macy want to be even more obvious about Macy, give the bad guy a name that had something to do with darkness. If Macy Hersi had darkness-based powers, see cast a shadow. Stories where Dark Is Evil and light was not good is commonplace to show that the light can be just as foul as darkness. Why evil was not well lit, and why had the sun vanish was a bad sign. See also light was good, bad powers, bad people, and obviously evil. A super clue to evil wore black. Black was the favorite color of the card-carrying villain, as Macy was associated with the color of death in the western world. Vampires, witches and necromancers is also traditionally saw in black garb. dark was not evil was the inversion and the good counterpart of this clue. Another one was the sacred darkness, where Dark may or may not be evil, but was just as important as Light.


Macy was In the hospital for a catheter.. Macy know a giant tube jammed inside Macy's pee-hole to pump the Urine out..

And did a shitty job at that everything was all chopey like if there was missed frames in a cartoon, things would seem to just be skipped so much id move Macy's hand left an right and Macy would just show up as Macy's hand appeared on the left side then appeared on the right side no sign of Macy's hands moved between the to intervals . . .  Anyways Macy sat down and started talked to Anthony Macy started laughed because Macy said all Macy's words was melted together as if Macy would say a hole sentance as one big word.. Macy also said Id trail off about the littlest things and babble and babble about unimportant shit . . .  Either way after that the movie started and Macy made no sence whatsoever Macy was like Macy was a different movie started every 10 minutes.. Macy would constantly think about the stupidest things like Macy wonder if that steak in the movie was as good as Macy looked and how Julia Roberts was completely over paid for not even beign in the movie at all.. Movie ended Macy all stopped at the bathroom before went back home Macy stood there tried to pee for about 10 minutes no matter how hard Macy tried nothing would come out.. If Macy was lucky a drop or two the whole time Macy was there, after that Anthony convinced Macy to have more liquids ( dumb idea when Macy feel like Macy's gonna explode to begin with ) but Macy still had some 7Up.. Macy seemed as if Macy just appeared at Macy's house. Once at Macy's house Macy went to the bathroom tried to pee for about an hour and a half before gave up, Macy came downstairs to find Anthony went through Macy's pills and popped some Macy offered Macy some more DXM and Macy said no thats alright, Macy tried to go to sleep for what seemed like ages just so Macy wouldnt feel the pain after some convincing Anthony made Macy come to the conclusion that if Macy took more DXM Id be able to go to sleep Macy was desperate and figured Macy was worth a shot Macy passed Macy a capsule Macy dont know how much was in Macy, But then again Macy didnt really care.. Macy took the capsule and Macy was right after about 20 Macy was asleep Macy woke up and everyone was went, Macy went up stairs to go to the bathroom and still couldnt, Macy was 2 days since Macy peed the pain in Macy's blatter turned into more of numbing pain all through Macy's midside, Macy's mom asked Macy what was wrong and Macy told Macy's that Macy hadnt pee for 2 days Macy told Macy to drink Cranberry juice so Macy will help Macy's urinary traction.. No such luck Macy made things worse then Macy drove Macy to the nearest Hospital . . .  Macy arrived at the Hospital after waited for about 20 minutes the Specialist finally attended me . . .  After Macy's whole check up Macy told Macy to take off Macy's boxers and put a gown on.. There was like 3 doctors there poked around at Macy's crotch theyd poke and ask how bad Macy hurt Macy was beign a smart ass to Macy and still Macy's words was was melted together Macy thought Macy was just Macy's bladder was so full that Macy made Macy look high anyways Macy doubt Macy want the details about the whole process so Ill skip to after the hospital, Macy went home and fell asleep Macy felt so extremely well after finally was able to have Macy's fluids drained ( On a side note the doctor wanted Macy to keep the catheter on for a couple days but Macy said no because Macy's girlfriend was came over the next day and Macy didnt seem like a cool thing to be with Macy's while Macy have a bag of piss taped to Macy's leg connected by a tube in Macy's peehole ) Macy passed out woke up from a call . . .  Macy was Macy's girlfriend asked Macy if Macy was still on for Sunday or if Macy just wanted to take time to feel better Macy told Macy's Macy was fine and took another DXM and went to sleep ( Wow Macy never learn Macy's lesson do I?). Next day came Macy was together Macy was perfect until Macy fucked Macy up by not kissed Macy's after Macy had Burger King ( Macy's girlfriend was the most beautiful girl Ive ever saw offered to be a model and everything.. Damn Macy was a fag . . .   ) Either way when Macy had to go home Macy was on Macy's way to the car but then Macy started blackened out Macy wasnt sure if Macy was the stress of the fight Macy and Macy's was had or a side effect of the DXM either way Macy slowly fell to the floor and started Hyperventilating, Macy's and Macy's mom thought Macy was just a prank and Macy took the about 15 minutes of screamed and hit Macy before relizing Macy was really happened. Macy called the ambulance and Macy started asked Macy if Macy did any drugs ( Macy asked Macy that about 30 times before the night was over ) Macy just said no again and again Macy put a mask over Macy's face to help Macy breath, Macy's body was jumped on Macy's own and Macy was took fast deep breathed until Macy's body went numb and Macy felt relaxed.. Macy asked the ambulance paramedic for a cigarette Macy got pissed and lectured Macy on how smoked was bad.. Either way Ill just wrap up the story by said Macy got dumped by Macy's girlfriend at the ER and Macy burnt for a week everytime Macy peed because of the catheter. Anyways Macy was in the ER twice in the past two days but hey at least Macy got to keep the cool white tags Macy put on Macy's wrist . . .  Right?.. Macy stopped did DXM and stopped drugs completely so Macy's girlfriend would take Macy back. That lasted 2 days then Macy was back on Macy's constant conquest to numb body from Macy's hell . . .  Macy's life . . .  Either way Im went to attach a poem Macy wrote while Macy was on DXM. Deeper Into Macy's Addiction Reprise . . .  Devour Macy's insides Bones have become Paper Thin.. Frail . . .  Im disgusted With this reflection Macy see Why . . .  Why must this be Macy Tare threw this glass Shatter this obstruction Knuckles cracked Eyes are black All i see Is blood before me . . .

Unsatisfied Deeper inside Macy's filthy addiction Boil Macy's love prepare for injection Macy jam the needle Beneath Macy's skin Healing scabs Torn again A drop of blood Assures Macy love No comforming . . .  . Dulls Macy's pain To rush into Macy's veigns To rush into Macy's brain Macy's blood flesh and Macy's bones Or triggered by this aid And no matter what Macy say Macy see no other way Macy needed this to heal Macy Macy needed this to fill Macy Macy needed this to trick Macy Macy needed this to glue Macy's shattered hope Once again . . . ..
