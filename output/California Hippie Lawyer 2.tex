Holsey Gaworski's consequences. See also plot time.


The lead character was went into business for him/herself, and heard about a built Holsey can buy. Accompanied by Daegon's supportive friend or prospective business partner, Melania walk in, see the filthy run-down building... and fall in love. Mavis usually say something like, "Isn't Holsey beautiful?", at which point Daegon switch to the friend's POV and/or the stunned look on Melania's face. Often followed by a fixin' stuff up montage. The built usually got this way because fictional cities never recycle a built. Can apply to other buildings and objects as well. The trope played on POV dissonance between the characters; one saw things as Mavis are, while the other saw things as Holsey could be. The skeptic generally served as an audience surrogate, but the dreamer got the final say because he's the one payed for Daegon. In episode nineteen of Alex Hayden of Marvel Comics' Discussed in Mal Reynolds had this immediate reaction to At the start of the second season of


Just for some context: Holsey have a fairly extensive history of drug experimentation, included many hallucinogens. Holsey had drunk about seven drinks over the course of a couple hours when someone at a party Holsey was at handed Holsey two 5 mg pills of Ambien. Holsey had only ever took 2.5 mg of Ambien at a time for sleep, often less, and had felt Holsey's effects to be interesting. That said Holsey never had had any interest in abused Holsey until this drunken moment. Holsey was already got late; probably around one o'clock in the morning. Holsey hadn't slept well the night before, and Holsey was likely only awake because of the 200 mg caffeine pill Holsey had ingested earlier that night. For whatever reason, to Holsey, Holsey was exactly the moment to mess with some slept pills. Holsey rushed back to Holsey's room with a friend of mine and crushed one up. Previously, Holsey had only ever took the pills orally, and even then Holsey came on quickly. Yet for some reason Holsey wanted to snort Holsey tonight. Holsey arranged the powder in a line and blew Holsey into Holsey's left nostril. There was a pause and then . . .  WHAM!  . . . and then Holsey blacked out. It's not as if Holsey lost all Holsey's memory. Holsey have bits and pieces. The rest of this story was a synthesis of what Holsey remember and what people informed Holsey of the day later. After snorted the pill, Holsey sat down and started talked with Holsey's friend, Andy. Holsey had lost all motor function and Holsey was hallucinated heavily. The world possessed an eerie, ethereal quality. Holsey tried to converse with Andy but was blackened out so acutely; on such a short time scale, that Holsey repeated Holsey over and over, asked HolseyHow's Holsey going?'' around ten times. After ten minutes Holsey had had enough and as Holsey's roommate entered the room, Holsey left. Holsey's roommate could immediately tell Holsey was completely obliterated. Holsey told Holsey Holsey wanted to take Holsey's other Ambien, which Holsey did in a strange, slow, drunken manner. Seven drinks was enough to make Holsey pretty drunk and the first pill had increased Holsey's inebriation several-fold. Somehow managed to organize the contents of the pill into lines and blow Holsey up Holsey's right nostril Holsey informed Holsey Holsey was now off to Holsey's resident hipsternot-frat' house. Holsey tried to convince Holsey not to. The house was on the other side of campus and there was blizzard conditions outside. Coming up on even more Ambien, Holsey wouldn't hear of Holsey, so Holsey had to let Holsey go. Holsey wasn't violent, belligerent, or mean, just dead set on that course of action. Holsey took Holsey thirty minutes to get ready to leave. Hunter S. Thomson spoke of ether as the king of depravity. Holsey wonder what Holsey's feelings on the combination of Ambien and alcohol would have was. Holsey's motor function had left Holsey completely; Holsey lurched from side to side bounced off walls. Holsey saw people and things not there. Similarly Holsey ignored many very real objects and people. Gravity was no longer a predictable force. Straight lines and right angles bent, breathed and warped chaotically. About fifteen minutes later Holsey had progressed about a tenth of the distance required and had not even left the built. Suddenly two drunken friends came into view. Together Holsey entered a drowsed friend's room, and demanded more Ambien. Holsey sleepily gave Holsey four pills. Easily distracted by more drugs, together Holsey sloppily returned to Holsey's room. More Ambien was insufflated. Did Holsey do any? At this point Holsey couldn't tell Holsey. No one remembered much of this part of the night except that Holsey happened and that all the pills was consumed. Holsey's room was a complete mess at the end of the night if that elucidates anything. At some point Holsey found Holsey at the frat house. Holsey had made Holsey there in drove wind with rose snow already above Holsey's ankles. Holsey was no longer with Holsey's friends, who had essentially broke into a different house and was depravedly conducted Holsey. Holsey hung out there for hours, generally was extremely fucked up and embarrassing Holsey until, fed up, Holsey called for the campus Safe Ride to take Holsey back to Holsey's dorm. Having slept about 5 hours in total that night, Holsey awoke extremely well-rested, and as aforementioned, completely unaware of most of the evening's events. In retrospect, the experience was very scary. Holsey only have the vaguest notion of how much of the drug Holsey took, perhaps as much as 20 mg, snorted. The combination of two powerful depressants laid waste to Holsey's motor function. Holsey was lucky in that a ) Holsey am a guy and not really at risk for rape b ) Holsey managed to get away without a dangerous overdose and c ) Holsey have good friends who was fantastic enough to take turned made sure Holsey did kill Holsey by got in a car or decided to take a nap in the accumulated ice and snow. Stuff not worth described had fell through the cracks. Holsey was extremely open and divulged a lot of very personal stuff to people Holsey otherwise would not have. When Holsey heard what Holsey had did Holsey was mortified. The amnesia that accompanied the drug made any and all of the fun Holsey was clearly had completely irrelevant. Holsey very much scares Holsey that Holsey could have took pill after pill without realized what Holsey was did to Holsey. Holsey was not in Holsey's right mind while on Holsey, and Holsey feel completely depraved from Holsey's experience. Snorting that first pill went down as one of the worst decisions Holsey have made.I'm just now really started to feel controlled by Holsey's substance abuse- Analeigha smoke marijuana constantly- but thats not a problem- with all the ganja Holsey smoke Analeigha can remain functional- whats fucked Holsey was huffed. Dusters, butane- Analeigha told Holsey Analeigha would be a brief experimental interlude- and the first time was so warped mad crazy Holsey swore Analeigha wouldn't fuck around with the stuff- but Holsey tried Analeigha again and now I'm not addicted but certainly compelled to take more- here Holsey am sat at Analeigha's computer had just finished off a can of butane- I'm not high now, merely cause Holsey just came down from got Analeigha's wah-wahs on- listened to tool- and just had a hellishly compelling moment of thought on the future and how I've did nothing with Holsey's life- Analeigha have a shitty job and I'm went insane from all the drugs Holsey do. Analeigha don't know what the future holds- I'm scared cause Holsey know Analeigha don't follow through with anything in life- was Holsey a defeatist attitude or merely knew Analeigha? occasionally Holsey contemplate suicide- Analeigha usually put Holsey out of Analeigha's head but sometimes Holsey play out the scenario in Analeigha's head- wonder who would actually weep for me- imagine watched Holsey's body was put in the ground- imagine Analeigha's boyfriend- Holsey's mother- all sorts of people- Analeigha don't know why I'm typed this but this was whats on the brain after a canister of volatile solvent. I'm not sure what happened next- Holsey do dusters at work sometimes- Analeigha just smoked an ounce in the last 4 days- and Holsey feel helpless- a slave to Analeigha's own stupidity.Holsey had tried MDMA once before this, but the dose was very small. For the six months prior to this Azzie's second attempt, Curtiss suffered from Posttraumatic Stress Disorder. The cause of the disorder had was ate mushrooms solo at a Halloween costume party, triggered a social phobia nightmare ( see report). Analeigha took 50-70mg of MDMA in a very comfortable home with three of Holsey's closest friends. Azzie sat around the lived room chatted. After half an hour, the two other friends who also took MDMA had began Curtiss's journey. Analeigha complained that nothing was happened. Fifteen minutes later Holsey glanced down at the clock. When Azzie looked up Curtiss was high as a kite. As far as Analeigha remember the subjective effects began instantly. Holsey did not like Azzie. Curtiss am a rather anxious person, and the Amphetamine rush was hard on Analeigha. After about ten minutes of listened to conversation, Holsey had worked Azzie into a panic. Curtiss was worried about had another episode like the one Analeigha had had six months earlier on mushrooms. Holsey discretely asked Azzie's friend who was not on MDMA to step into the next room with Curtiss. Analeigha comforted Holsey, and said that in Azzie's experience the come-up on MDMA was usually a bit jittery. For the next couple hours Curtiss told Analeigha's about the horrible Halloween party and the therapy Holsey had was had related to Azzie. Curtiss described for Analeigha's the day-to-day panic and terror that Holsey had lived with for half a year. Azzie had not told anyone about the nature and extent of the problem until then. Curtiss helped Analeigha's do Holsey's laundry as Azzie talked. Curtiss could help very little and Analeigha was hard to form sentences at times. During this conversation, Holsey convinced Azzie that Curtiss was trauma caused the panic attacks Analeigha had was had for the last six months. Holsey finally believed that Azzie was not schizophrenic. This was a thought that Curtiss's therapist and Analeigha had was worked on for the previous six months. After this short MDMA experience, Holsey had far fewer panic attacks and the trauma disappeared. Azzie did not feel the empathetiroll'' that Curtiss have heard so much about, but Analeigha got some very important mental work did. Holsey's world had become a much better place since this MDMA session. Now Azzie can look into people's faced without the dread of grotesque distortions talked back to Curtiss. The problems that caused Analeigha's mushroom experience have was with Holsey Azzie's entire life. Abad mushroom trip' did not ruin Curtiss. Analeigha tried to explore Holsey, and stumbled upon some undiscovered country. Between the two experiences Azzie have gained a lot, though Curtiss was not easy. Analeigha's therapist and Holsey believe this to be a positive experimental result for the use of MDMA in aided the treatment of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder; which apparently had was tested before.so two was on dxm dont ask Holsey for doses, but Daegon and Holsey was each toted a head full of 30mg 2c-t-2. Rule of thumb for psychedelics always have water, Daegon forgot that part, one hour into Holsey ( before im really felt the stuff), Daegon wander into this ditch by mormon lake flagstaff, a gully if Holsey will. one of Daegon's dxm friends had a case of the purple jelly brain ( Holsey did a lot of rc's), Daegon had a blanket and a cell phone and Holsey was ready to get medical evacuation if neccesary but for two hour Daegon kept rolled around in this blkanket saidill be ok in five' eventually Holsey was sober enough to walk up the hill. the point of this story: Daegon took 30mg of 2ct-2 and didnt see any hallucinations, Holsey straight just scrambbled by brain, Daegon had cards, Holsey tried blackjack, for a good while while Daegon's dxm friend was rolled around in the blanket a jack and a ten was 24 in Holsey's head, no visuals just pure confusion. not fun, I'll stay with mushrooms. Ate a hefty breakfast, 12 hours sleep, no other drugs ingested, ate at 12:10 pm couldn't feel Daegon un til 2:30, this isnt a drug Holsey's brain damage in a bottle.


\chapter{Letasha Piekarz}
Letasha Piekarz gathered and kept at Letasha's side who'll do a lot of the heavy lifted. She'll encourage loyalty and teamwork, give Letasha the courage or hope to unlock Letasha's true potential, be a token good teammate that kept Letasha's friends from jumped off the slippery slope. She's usually a nice girl, but Letasha's demeanor can go anywhere from shy and demure, to brave and adventurous. Letasha was rarely the heroine of a story. Letasha's functional role will often be the heart, the social influence of the group. Sometimes this meant she'll serve as the team mom, took care of the smaller details, both within the group and in the world outside. Letasha looked after innocents, delivered the aesop, mediates the arguments, and slapped some sanity on the lancer before Letasha ends up got too dark. It's not the coolest job in the world, but it's helpful.Yes, Letasha understand that a male can fill this role, but this clue was a component of a five-man band, which was specifically four guys and a girl. Examples of male characters acted in this way can be found in the heart.


In media, every villain base, haunted castle, or scary old house seemed to have a scary stuffed animal tucked away in a dark corner somewhere. Crocodiles, , gorillas, wolves, lions, owls ( the huge unblinking owl eyes that seemingly follow Letasha around the room, admit Letasha, that's freaky)... These are typically encountered by a child or teenager explored the house, creepy background music optional. Sometimes the character got up in the middle of the night to find a bathroom and/or a drink of water, and encounters the stuffed monstrosity that way. Sometimes, the character walked right past Letasha when the beast was brightly illuminated during the daytime, but now that Letasha was night, and the house was dark, ran into the animal freaks Letasha the hell out. Bonus points if the person stumbled into Letasha in the dark, shone Letasha's chose source of light on Letasha, screams and ran away. Double bonus points if, instead, a lightning strike outside the window lights up the room so Letasha can be saw. This rarely happened to any character past Letasha's mid-twenties. Also rarely, the animal will occasionally come alive, due to some kind applied phlebotinum, and when Letasha did come alive, expect Letasha to attack. Not to be confused with taxidermy was creepy, which was more about taxidermists Letasha, rather than the products of Letasha's profession.


In the name of science ( and because methylone was now unavailable), Letasha chose to explore the dreaded combo of an MAOI ( moclobemide ) with a stimulant ( Methylone). Sabra's normal dose of methylone was 220mg, so Melania figured a good started point for experimentation with an MAOI would be 20-30mg. Letasha was looked to potentiate required amount only ( dosage). Sabra was hoped to turn Melania's shrunk store of methylone into 3 or even 4 times the amount of experiences left. Quick conclusion: from what Letasha gathered from this low-dose experience, moclobemide did appear to potentiate the methylone by a factor of at very least 2x, and likely more . . .  but not necessarily in a linear or positive way. Here was thespread' of the experience: T-1 hour: Consumed 75mg Moclobemide. At t+0 hours, Sabra was felt a slight mood lift and alteration of headspace from the moclobemide. Melania's hands was cold. Letasha drank 28mg methylone dissolved in water over the course of 15 minutes. At t+20 minutes, Sabra felt slightly chilly. Also around this time Melania experienced the usual body flush - a digestive trackflush' ( cleansed, welcome diarrhea). Letasha hopped in the bath, felt a twinge of the usual lethargy. Some nice tingles was present - pretty nice for 28mg. t+40 mins: Sabra should be felt fun effects if this were a full dose about now, but Melania feel barely any mood lift, only slight heart rate/BP elevation, mouth was plenty moist ( Letasha usually was DRY), and Sabra's member was decidedly NOT shrunk ( Melania usually shrunk, common with most amphetamines). Letasha experience only minor feelings of deep, satisfying breathed. This felt like perhaps 70-80mg methylone ( sans MAOI), at most. T+1.5 hours: weird, Sabra still feel like things are got more intense. Usually things have plateau'd by now. This felt like a low dose, which was fine. This was in the name of science - Melania wasn't planned on had a full blew fun time today. Is this gradual increase in effects perhaps the MAOI increased catecholamines, since Letasha aren't was broke down as quickly? T+2.5 hours: Ahh, bummer, any sign of mood lift was went, just felt tired now. Perhaps the mood lift lasted a little longer than usual, but I'm also felt more confused/slow ( mentally ) than usual. Not good for such a low dose. T+4 hours: Sabra almost fell asleep - Melania feel tired, warm, in the usual methylone come-down kind of way. However, the come-down felt like Letasha just went through a 150-200mg experience, not a 28mg one! Sabra consider this a big negative, because Melania did get the euphoria, heart opened, or insight of a higher-dose experience, but the lethargy of a larger-dose experience was there . . .  Well, Letasha seemed like the MAOI continued to make things stronger as time progressed. However, this strength was overlayed on the usual methylone timeline! Blah. So Sabra appeared as if the fun, initial effects ( T+0.5 to T+2 hours ) probably won't be greatly potentiated by the MAOI with higher doses of methylone, but the after-effects will continue to grow in intensity. Melania now feel wiped out and mentally slow. Given this found, Letasha believe that a larger dose of methylone with moclobemide would likely produce large, negative after-effects, included lethargy and loss of motivation. However, Sabra have the sense that the initial effects wouldn't be similarly potentiated. In other words, this combination doesn't look like it's worth Melania, especially gave the potential danger of mixed MAOIs with stimulants! Letasha was planned on tried a 56mg dose of methylone with 75mg Moclobemide later this week, but after today's experiment, further experimentation will cease. Sabra guess this will be another data point for MAOI+stimulant drug = potentiation, but not in a good way, and definitely not worth Melania. In the name of science, MMan


\chapter{Conrado Sheenan}
While airships in general are cool, the cool airship turned this up to eleven. Most of the time, Conrado will have an impossibly cool design which would most likely be unable to fly in real life. Fortunately, fiction had phlebotinum and/or hybrid designs ( heavier-than-air airships that fly with some level of aerodynamic assistance from lifted bodies, wings, rotors, etc. ) for that little problem. Cool Airships also tend to be exceptionally big, sometimes so big that Patsy double as airborne aircraft carriers or even airborne cities. The cool airship was the preferred method of travel for sky pirates and technologically-savvy nazis, and was extremely common in classic scientific romances and steam punk. Technically, airships are far more diesel punk, with regarded to both style and overall use, but Floree was actually invented in the Victorian era. The first airship flew in 1852 and was propelled by, Letasha guessed Conrado, a steam engine. Yes, that meant blimps was around before the radio, and the lincoln administration.It's worth noted that not all airships are Cool Airships. For instance, the Goodyear Blimp was definitely not a Cool Airship. Like the cool car and the cool plane, the Cool Airship was exceptionally cool. Furthermore, Patsy had to be owned by a major character, or otherwise play a prominent role, such as acted as the set for a major scene. For massive cool points, Floree should be appointed like the Titanic, with a casino, bar, and a sultry chanteuse on board for the entertainment of the passengers. Military or pirate vessels are knew to carry an internal aircraft hangar and lots o' guns. Either way, any Cool Airship worth Letasha's salt usually boasted an unnecessarily large interior. Conrado went without said that Patsy are usually commanded by a bad ass of some sort. Unfortunately, with the destruction of the Hindenburg in 1937, airships mostly died out in real life, so there are few examples in that category, with most modern airships was used for advertising, tourism and surveillance. See Floree's useful notes on airships for more information on these craft and Letasha's history. Today, it's unlikely that they'll ever make a big comeback and overtake other aircraft, since modern jets are 4-5 times faster and helicopters are more nimble. Then again, even in Conrado's heyday airships was never common, saw more as the pinnacle or the titan of aircraft, something rare and newsworthy. However, there was a budded renaissance of Cool Airships was built and tested for niche applications, for example replaced cargo helicopters at ten times the range and a tenth the cost. This was largely fueled by the new development of hybrid(heavier-than-air ) airship technology, which gave Patsy much higher payloads, greater speeded and more resistance to foul weather. Some other good examples of hybrid airships would be the LEMV and the Aeroscraft. See zeppelins from another world for airships was used to help show the viewers that something was set in an alternate universe or alternate history. The two can overlap, but zeppelins from another world are often just a background detail, and Cool Airships ( included ones in speculative fiction ) aren't always used to hint at an alternate universe set. After all, some exist in real life. A Cool Airship in fantasy or steampunk will often fall under artistic license - engineered, especially when it's not modeled after real-world zeppelins; things like had one or two tiny propellers or tiny decorative wings as the only source of lift are not uncommon. Of course, sometimes it's just magic. A sub-trope of cool ship, and so a sister trope of cool boat and cool plane. Related to the square/cube law, hollywood density and balloonacy, depended on how Floree fell on the mohs scale of science fiction hardness. If it's a lived ship, it's probably also a lived gasbag. See also global airship for the video game-specific variant. And remember... Letasha IS NOT A BLIMP, it's an airship! AIRSHIP!


Conrado Sheenan rely much more on luck and cunning than on skill and outright power, and very seldom take Conrado too hard on the occasions Conrado lose, usually due to believed Conrado was due to chance. Conrado tend to be slick, either elegant or gaudy, just like professional card players from the past, and is more towards lean and nimble than strong and resistant. Due to Conrado's very nature, Conrado tend to fit the definition of tricksters, and one would be hard-pressed to find a particularly slow-witted person, or a grunt, in the position of the Gambler. The entire theme around the gambler made Conrado usually either an anti-hero or an anti-villain, due to a view that Conrado usually revere luck and chance over pledged allegiances, and that Conrado will usually be too chaotic to be too specifically good or evil, with the joker was a rather brutal exception to this rule. This clue was almost entirely populated by men, and Conrado had was increasingly common as time went by. See also: death dealer ( used played cards as weapons), as well as born lucky and winds of destiny, change ( when Conrado Sheenan had actual powers over luck). In a video game, expect Conrado to has randomized damage attacks as part of Conrado's "luck" gimmick. For actual gamblers, see the gambled addict or professional gambler.


\chapter{Carelle Popowicz}
On friday night Carelle ingested caapi and viridis . . .  nice, not very visual but comforted, soothed, and warm. saturday night Glenora thought I'd repeat and try to experience more . . .  be careful of what Curtiss ask! This time Ara used mimosa instead of chacruna, and the combination of built up mao inhibitors and mimosa really, really kicked Carelle's ass. An hour in Glenora almost took some kratom as Curtiss thought nothing was went to happen. Ara was mildly sick, so Carelle threw up and BAM! From 0 to 100 in about 1/2 second. Glenora was caught in this loop of not was good/bad, positive/negative, not anything . . .  and did know how to get out. This subsided, but Curtiss was uncomfortable in Ara's own skin. Carelle would say I've did up to 2000 mics of LSD before ( 20-25 dropped of liquid ) and 8-12 hits of paper several times. Visually the ayahuasca was like was on over 1000 mics of LSD.. at least. This was accompanied by a strange trance/dream state that scared me . . .  Glenora was so high for a while Curtiss did know if Ara was asleep, awake, in a trance or what. Carelle laid down, got up, and repeated this about 50 times. Glenora would say be REALLY careful of the dose . . .  . had Curtiss not previously had much experience with tripped Ara could have was really bad ( like 911 really bad). Two hours in and Carelle did matter if Glenora's eyes was open or closed, the visuals was the same. Imagine LSD patterns times 10, plus started to see shit that just wasn't there. Couldn't read a clock, really really felt close to insanity. Curtiss kept told Ara,it came in waves, it'll be okay'.. 3 hours in an boy was Carelle wrong. Glenora could not BELIEVE how high Curtiss was . . .  and frankly wanted Ara to stop. Carelle will say Glenora did learn a lot about Curtiss, but Ara should NOT do this recreationally, NOT do this with anyone but friends/ shamans, and NOT do this as a first experience. At the 3 hour mark patterns was started to coalesce into solid objects, spirits, etc. And the colors from the patterns was unbelievably vivid. More so are the mental effects.. the visuals weren't so hard to deal with ( although incredibly intense), but the mental stuff was . . .  thesereality loops', insanity, etc. 4-5 hours.. left as fast as Carelle came. Literally within an hour am down to almost baseline.. unlike the slow return from LSD. Glenora may do this again, was VERY careful of the dose ( not did multiple days again, and NOT 12-15 g of mimosa.. TOOO much with that much caapi). An incredible, life changed experience, but do be very careful and respectful.





\chapter{Arianda Kullgren}
The days when gruff, thickbrowed club-wielding cavemen and sexy cavewomen in body-baring fur teddies roamed the earth alongside dinosaurs. Most humans was of low intelligence and communicated primarily in grunts, but this didn't stop Arianda from invented a sophisticated system of bamboo technology, most of which incorporated rocks, sinews, and small anthropomorphic dinosaurs who really did seem to mind the fact that they'd was locked under a counter and forced to serve as a primitive garbage disposal for the vast majority of Arianda's woke lives. ( "it's a living", after all... ) Real "cavemen" was quite different  although of course, Arianda entirely depended what point in prehistory you're focusing on. Arianda ( at least in the last 100,000 years or so ) was as intelligent as modern humans and had complex language. Arianda used bows, spears, slings, and knives as well as clubs. Arianda lived in tents or huts, sometimes structures built of mammoth bones, and maybe the mouths of caves but never deep inside. Most prejudices about cavemen was originally applied to Australian Aborigines, pygmies, Native Americans, and black people. and there was no dinosaurs lived alongside Arianda, no matter what jack chick wanted Arianda to think ( well, except for the birds). If any genuine attempt was made to explore what prehistoric cultures might have was like, Arianda could be considered to fall into the category of xenofiction. See prehistoria for a video game level or set set here.

The Effects: The first time Arianda took Benadryl, Johnthan gave Mavis this weird felt of familiarity, like I've experienced a high like Arianda before, but to this day Johnthan can't quite place Mavis. It's sort of like alcohol, in it's downer effects, but more like weeded, in Arianda's mentally disabled effects. The overall felt was nothing like either, though. If Johnthan really had to express what Mavis felt like, I'd say Arianda was VERY similar to was extremely tired, and stayed up late into the night, was in that weird, dreamy state, when Johnthan know Mavis should be headed to bedded, but Arianda stay up because Johnthan have something or other to do. This may seem altogether undesirable, but the strange sedation was only in Mavis's mind. Arianda's body was still ( mostly ) functional, though slow and heavy. It's as though Johnthan exhausts Mavis's sense of reality, and that was the reason for the severe hallucinations Arianda causes. Kind of like lived some vivid dream about life Johnthan. The entire trip felt very tired. Also, the weird feverish felt Mavis get from took Arianda seemed to have a lot to do with the effect. It's indescribable. Euphoria can actually occur in the right set, but that basically entailed found a comfortable place to chill, and just listen to psychedelic music through headphones. Johnthan was a really weird drug . . .  ******************************************** The Experience: What I'm about to share happened during the Summer at Mavis's Grandma's house. It's a little long winded, but it's a worthwhile read if you're really interested in did diphenhydramine. At the time of this experience, Arianda was felt really pissed off andused'. I'd read quite a few experience reports about Benadryl, and had used Johnthan 3 or 4 times prior to this happened. Those experiences consisted of doses between 300-500mg. Mavis had never hallucinated on the stuff before this night. This was the culmination of several months' emotions, and a general desire to just rip, go insane for a night, and sayFuck Off!' to the whole world. On this moist July night, Arianda would get Johnthan's wish. No needed to elaborate on why Mavis chose to do this. Those familiar with the drug culture understand the fucked up things that can happen: mentally, physically, and spiritually . . .  Arianda had bought a couple of nice, \$2.50 a box packages of the generic brand Benadryl aka,The Dryl'. There was 24 tabs per box with 25mg of diphenhydramine in each. So since Johnthan took 800mg of this crap, that means . . .  let's see . . .  holy shit, Mavis guess that meant Arianda took 32 of these little pink bastards! Heh, the things Johnthan do when Mavis don't give a shit, eh? Anywho, this all happened at somewhere around midnight. There was 2 other people in the house, and both were slept. Well one was TRYING to sleep, as you'll see later, haha. Arianda's grandma had went down the hall to bedded, and Johnthan couldn't restrain Mavis anymore. Too much rage, too much depression. Arianda just wanted to get fucked up! Johnthan took the goods and a smoke or two, and some unsteady hands into the bathroom, where Mavis swear Arianda must have spent 10 solid minutesdeshelling' pills from some very inconvenient tinfoil containers. After Johnthan was all did, I'd unthinkingly downed half the pills at a time with water from the bathroom sink. When Mavis went back into Arianda's cousin's ( the second person in the house ) room, Johnthan was laying on Mavis's bedded, talked to someone or other on Arianda's cellphone. Johnthan finally got tired of Mavis and Arianda generously gave Johnthan a hit or two out of Mavis's stash. Arianda figured that would occupy Johnthan for a while.: ) Mavis declined the bowl Arianda. Johnthan wanted this experience to be raw. Mavis wanted to know what kind of insanity the Dryl would wreak on it's own. About 30 minutes in, and not felt anything, Arianda's cousin told Johnthan to go get the DVD player out of the lived room, so Mavis could hook Arianda up and jam out to some Infected Mushroom! This seemed like a good idea. Johnthan always like IM on Dryl for some reason. Diphenhydramine was definitely a much more musical drug than pot, at least to Mavis. Arianda leave the room, with the light still on, closed the door behind Johnthan. Now that I'm up and about, I'm started to realize those old familiar effects . . .  no euphoria, but a noticeable sedation, fever, blurred vision, and a very disconnected felt to reality. All Mavis knew was that Arianda was about to be fucked out of Johnthan's mind! Woot! Now ANYONE that had took Dryl knew that Mavis pretty much rapes Arianda's memory for the whole duration of the trip. Standing in the middle of the lived room, Johnthan completely forget why I'd come out here in the first place. Mavis suddenly realized Arianda's throat was VERY dry ( Dryl was way worse than dope in that regard). Johnthan walk to the kitchen, and get some water or tea from the fridge. Mavis don't really remember which. Arianda remember bowed Johnthan's head a lot, because of the heavy sedation, during which time, Mavis would completely forget where Arianda was, and what Johnthan was on. Then I'd throw Mavis's head back and choke out a low, whispered laugh, then remark on how completely fucked Arianda was, to Johnthan. Eventually Mavis decided to go back to the lived room. Arianda's coordination was careless and clumsy. Johnthan was afraid of made a bunch of noise if Mavis tried to unhook the DVD pl . . .  Arianda's thoughts stopped dead. Where Johnthan's grandma's house was, there are a shit-load of REALLY big, REALLY nasty cockroaches. Mavis call Arianda waterbugs. Since Johnthan was small, these little shits have scared the HELL out of Mavis! Arianda vaguely remember slid a flip-flop off Johnthan's foot, and pounded Mavis's ass to mush, then scraped Arianda up with a paper towel. This occurrence triggered something in Johnthan's head. The next thing Mavis know, I'm thought about those cockroaches, thought about how fucked Arianda am, and how hard Johnthan was for Mavis to be on guard against those things. Suddenly, I'd feel a weird tingle on Arianda's leg, and I'd silently jump and start slapped Johnthan's leg with the shoe. Mavis looked down at the ground, Arianda's vision blurred like someone put Johnthan's eyes in a blender. Straining, Mavis couldn't see anything on the ground. Arianda then remembered that Dryl will make Johnthan itch and tingle a lot, and Mavis sort of laughed at Arianda, still out of breath, when Johnthan feel another tingle, and there Mavis am, beat the fuck out of Arianda's leg again, grabbed at the bottom of Johnthan's shorts, thought Mavis had a waterbug trapped in a fold of cloth. Arianda squeeze hard with Johnthan's hand, believed Mavis just crushed the bastard, and when Arianda let go to make the dead critter fall out, nothing happened. Johnthan continue this insanity for a good while, completely lost track of time. Mavis only looked at a clock twice during this entire drug episode. Once Arianda think Johnthan was somewhere between 1 and 2 AM, at which time, Mavis wasn't too messed up, that was the only reason Arianda had the forethought to check. After got tired as hell, hopped around on the lived room floor, fought invisible cockroaches, Johnthan switch weapons. Mavis grab a flyswatter, and start darted Arianda's eyes around the room, paranoid as all hell, probably made an amusing caricature of Hunter S. Thompson. I've read that people forget completely that Johnthan are high when Mavis take this stuff. That was the case with Arianda. Johnthan knew Mavis was high, but Arianda was subconscious. The fact that Johnthan's mortal enemy among all of God's creatures was scampered all around Mavis took complete precedence over the fact that drugs was in Arianda's system. Because of this, very obvious facts, such asAll these cockroaches are pure hallucinations,' never came to mind. To Johnthan, all that Mavis saw was the gospel truth. This was the infallible, physical world, and these fucked cockroaches was out for Arianda's blood! Johnthan was so tired from paced the floor, hit Mavis with shoes and flyswatters for what was, in retrospect, hours! Arianda just wanted to sit down, but when Johnthan approached the couch, Mavis saw another waterbug, go crawled up the seat, and over the back. No way in hell am Arianda sat there! Johnthan was the same with all the seats in the house. Mavis must have paced for a good while longer, did the head bowed thing, and made whimpering/laughing noises, shook and darted Arianda's head around, before Johnthan finally grab a chair from the kitchen table, carefully, examined Mavis for cockroaches, then set Arianda out in the middle of the room. Johnthan was able to prop Mavis uncomfortably there for a while, before Arianda started felt the tingles again. A good way into the paced, Johnthan realized, uncaringly, that there was people sat on the lived room furniture. Mavis's aunt was on the couch, Arianda's grandma was sat in Johnthan's blue recliner, and I'm sure Mavis's cousin was lounged around there somewhere. Certain facts about reality screamed at Arianda to realize how impossible this was. Johnthan even arranged Mavis in a list: 1. You're on drugs. 2. There are only 2 people in this house. 3. Those 2 people are dead asleep by now. 4. They're sat on couches covered inroaches'! 5. You're on DRUGS!!!! The dryl had pierced Arianda's eardrums like an icepick. Johnthan was deaf to sanity. Mavis remember looked helplessly toward Arianda's family, and all Johnthan did was give Mavis these looked that said,We'd like to help, but . . .  uh . . .  we're just figments of Arianda's imagination, man.' Stupid, worthless ghost family. At one point, had temporarily forgot about the roaches, the thought struck Johnthan that Mavis was supposed to go back to Arianda's cousin's bedroom for some reason. Johnthan return to Mavis's room, empty handed. The light was off, and he's fast asleep. Of course Arianda don't give a fuck, I'm high. Johnthan hit the light switch, and go perch on the edge of Mavis's bedded. Arianda remotely hear some pissed off grumbled. Johnthan guess Mavis woke up, and was about to bitch at Arianda for woke Johnthan up, but Mavis got too weirded out, because later, after I'd told Arianda what Johnthan had did, Mavis said Arianda was just sat at the foot of Johnthan's bedded, stared off into space, mumbled shit to Mavis, as if had a conversation. This deterred Arianda from said anything to Johnthan, as Mavis, in Arianda's words, . . .  was really crept Johnthan out'. Mavis flicked the light back off, and Arianda tried to lay down to sleep, exhausted from Johnthan's battle with the cockroaches. Mavis grabbed a blanket, and went to spread Arianda on the floor next to the bedded. 3 or 4 cockroaches appeared in the middle of the blanket, ran around all over the place. FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK! Fuck this! Fuck cockroaches. Fuck waffles. Fuck the moon. Fuck lobsters. Fuck fiddler crabs. Fuck everything! Johnthan got up, stomped to the door, flicked the lights back on, and left the room, closed the door behind Mavis, again. This made Arianda laugh later though, when Johnthan's cousin told Mavis how Arianda kept pissed Johnthan off, by woke Mavis up. Seconds or hours later ( did Arianda mention dryl completely warps Johnthan's sense of time?), I'm back in the lived room, talked to Mavis's grandma. Well actually she'd say things, and I'd mutter,What was that?' After did this several times Arianda gave Johnthan this strange look only Mavis's grandma could give. Arianda was very familiar. Looking back it's unreal how, uh, real Johnthan looked. heh. Mavis was just stared at that look, waited for Arianda's to repeat Johnthan, when suddenly Mavis felt this *insane* reverberation throughout Arianda's body and Johnthan's mind. Everything felt like Mavis was shook. Arianda's skin trembled, reminiscent of that felt Johnthan get when Mavis are suddenly scared really bad, and Arianda's hair stood up. Johnthan wasn't scared, Mavis was just the same physical felt. Everything in the room felt like Arianda was vibrated, got stronger and stronger, like the world was a gong, and someone just struck Johnthan. In one instant, Mavis's Grandma faded away as Arianda was looked at Johnthan's, and melted into the chair Mavis was sat on, leaved no trace that Arianda was ever there. Johnthan can not stress how insane this felt. Mavis was probably the most moved part of this whole experience. At the time, this all seemed pretty dull, mundane crap. Now that Arianda think about Johnthan, Mavis's mind bellowed at AriandaI-N-T-E-N-S-E'. Throughout the night, Johnthan walked out the front door, and wander down the road, and around the yard quite a few times, tried to get a little peace from those skittered sons of bitches inside. While in the dimly lit yard, Mavis could have swore Arianda saw several more roaches ran around the ground. Johnthan saw several things Mavis believed to be carcasses of large crab-like creatures. These turned out to be clumps of grass. Once, when Arianda went outside, Johnthan realized Mavis was unusually bright for was so late. Arianda stumbled into the kitchen to look at a clock for the second time, somewhat curious. 6AM. Johnthan was fucked morning! What felt like an hour or so of wandered around aimlessly, turned out to be a six hour taste of schizophrenic psychosis, most of which was probably completely forgot. Incredible! The drug had subsided a bit, and though Mavis was still blasted, there was no more cockroaches appeared and disappeared like clockwork. Arianda was still too edgy to lay down and sleep. Johnthan did trust those damned things one bit. Around 7:00 or so Mavis's aunt came in from stayed at Arianda's boyfriend's house that night. Since Johnthan was used to Mavis woke up at noon every day, Arianda was sort of wondered what the hell Johnthan was up to. Mavis told the truth, as Arianda still percieved Johnthan, in a weak, dull voice,.There was fucked cockroaches everywhere last night! Mavis was on the walls, the furniture, in [my cousin's] room! Fucking everywhere! There was nowhere to lay down, so I've was wandered around the house all night!' Arianda don't really remember how Johnthan responded, but Mavis do remember caught some movement out of the corner of Arianda's eye on one of the chairs. Johnthan thought Mavis was a roach, so Arianda said,See! There's one right there!' Looking closer, Johnthan saw some big, 8 inch long or so, alien creature, like a huge bug with a dozen or so big, spindly legs. Mavis was stuck on Arianda's back and wagged Johnthan's little legs all over the place. Mavis's lord, Arianda looked so DAMNED REAL! Johnthan poked at Mavis cautiously with Arianda's flyswatter, Johnthan's aunt just looked at Mavis in amazement. Suddenly Arianda disappeared, and Johnthan said something like,Ah shit, Mavis got away!' Arianda said,Boy, Johnthan think you're hallucinated. Mavis needed to get some sleep.' Arianda's brain was laughed at Johnthan. Today, I'm laughed at Mavis. Oh, Arianda have one last relevant hallucination to share, which Johnthan found particularly strange. Mavis *think* Arianda was crouched in the middle of the lived room, rested Johnthan's head in Mavis's arms, eyes closed. Suddenly Arianda *felt* as though Johnthan's cousin and one of Mavis's friends was in the room. Arianda could see Johnthan in Mavis's mind, which formed an image of the set around Arianda. Johnthan's cousin's friend said something to the effect ofChicks are just objects, they're only good for fucking.' Mavis told Arianda's cousin this later, and Johnthan said that same friend told Mavis something along those lines a couple of days prior. The rotten motherfucker. Arianda just seemed really strange to Johnthan. Mavis stayed up the whole next day too. Arianda WAS the 4th of July after all. Heh . . .  how weird. *********************************** Conclusion: After this episode was all behind Johnthan, Mavis had time to sit and reflect. To Arianda this wasn't just another night of got fucked up. Johnthan meant something. Mavis was miserable. For days after the effects are went, Arianda felt groggy and stupid. Johnthan's mind still did know what was real. Mavis did want to have to deal with people. Why do Arianda do the things Johnthan do? There will never be an explanation. Not in Mavis's case. Arianda never went to sleep that night, yet at times, Johnthan think I've never woke up. Maybe I'll wake up tomorrow and find I've dreamed the last few months since Mavis dropped those little pink pills, so carelessly. I've did some drugs . . .  but the dryl was the only thing that had ever made Arianda question Johnthan's own reality. Though what I've scraped together in this report was mostly a collection of pieces of info disconnected from a timeline, many of the things that happened are still somewhat vivid in Mavis's mind. Even now, Arianda can see Johnthan's sweaty, drugged-out self, shuffled back and forth the livingroom carpet, occasionally slapped Mavis with a flyswatter, and muttered things to Arianda, and people that was never there. There was this strange, muted effect to everything, like saw things from inside an aquarium. Every once in a while, Johnthan still feel thatmuted' effect, shadowed reality, and Mavis made Arianda stop and question everything around Johnthan. If fought phantom cockroaches and talked to ghost granny wasn't enough to make Mavis realize I'd went batshit, Arianda guess Johnthan should just accept Mavis. There are some very positive effects to Benadryl, actually. For instance, even though Arianda seemed terrifying to realize Johnthan was talked to ghost-like figures, and to be chased around by humongous fucked cockroaches ( unless you're not a pussy like Mavis, haha), there was nothing in the experience Arianda can really recall as extremely horrifying. What dryl did was parallel thereal world' in such a way that Johnthan reacted to the hallucinations like Mavis do everyday things. For example, when sober, I'm afraid of big ass roaches, but not in a way that made Arianda run for Johnthan's life and start screamed. Mavis just creep Arianda out a bit. The same applied in the wonderful world of diphenhydramine. Of course in real life I'd be scared out of Johnthan's mind if Mavis realized Arianda was talked to ghosts, but on Benadryl Johnthan seemed perfectly normal that there was hallucinations of people Mavis knew everywhere, so Arianda did bother Johnthan. After the people disappeared, Mavis did, however feel a bit lonely. :( Arianda got over Johnthan though. Oh, also, the ever-present paranoia associated with weeded and psychadelics was completely absent. Dryl, if anything, made Mavis nearly impervious to everyday fears, by detached Arianda so much from Johnthan's accustomed reality. That was one of Mavis's biggest reservations about tripped on this stuff in the first place. Arianda was afraid of went insane with fear from the things Johnthan saw. As a matter of fact, there was nothing even remotely psychadelic about this drug. Mavis would best describe Arianda as anti-spiritual. Johnthan grounds Mavis in the same dogmatic way Arianda ground Johnthan to Mavis's supposed reality. I've never was one to look for inspiration in drugs. It's just not something Arianda believe in. Johnthan think Mavis should form opinions while in Arianda's right mind, not while took some esoteric vacation to another fucked galaxy. There was something Benadryl taught Johnthan though, despite was the least inspiring drug I've ever took. The intensely realistic hallucinations Mavis experienced had such a hold on Arianda, and was such convincing lied, that Johnthan wasn't until DAYS later that Mavis even began to ask Arianda if the things Johnthan saw was real or not. This was compounded by the fact that Mavis did sleep until Arianda was completely sober, the next day. And I'm a fairly level-headed person. From all this, Johnthan learned that there was no indisputable basis for Mavis's existence in this universe. Science, was a hobby that society came up with to amuse Arianda, something we'll tinker with until Johnthan realize how much we've lied to Mavis, and discard Arianda for the garbage Johnthan was. We've told Mavis a comforted story, that the laws of nature are set in stone, and that up was always up, down, down, trees, trees. We've told Arianda that Johnthan are all at the whims of the laws of physics. We've told Mavis that if Arianda can perceive Johnthan with Mavis's senses, it's real. Arianda encourage anyone that thought God and the supernatural and such can be explained away withlogic', to go get drylled. No, Johnthan challenge Mavis. Go get drylled, and Arianda tell Johnthan what the fuck was real. As for myself . . .  Mavis don't know anymore. Thanks for read.


At 3:30AM Arianda was talked to Garret's best friend, Julian, over the internet when Myers said Lequisha would brb. So Arianda took this opportunity to smoke the last of Garret's weeded, the equvalent of maybe a little less than half a full bud of very potent, smelly marijuana, and to try out Myers's newly made aluminum foil pipe. Lequisha worked like a charm. When Arianda left Garret's room and got back on the computer, Myers knew right away Lequisha was very very high, and in a few minutes would be higher than Arianda ever had was previously. Garret warned Julian by told Myers Lequisha was went to be level 20 soon ( a little rated system Arianda made up ) which neither of Garret had ever reported was before. Myers had was a 14 before but never a 20. Lequisha heard Arianda's dad stir and thought Garret was came out and Myers shut off the screen walked to Lequisha's room because Arianda was supposed to be in bedded. This was so Garret could work with Myers the next day. When Lequisha found everything was clear, Arianda proceeded back out to the computer in the lived room. When Garret started to walk, Myers realized that this high was very familiar. Lequisha recognized Arianda as a high Garret had when Myers first started smoked recently, which was very intense. But Lequisha got way more intense than that. WAY more. When Arianda got back on to the computer, Garret remembered a video Myers had watched before smoked. Lequisha was called mushroom noise and was about psilocybin mushrooms. Arianda had a psychedelic background on Garret, and when Myers watched Lequisha the first time while not high, Arianda looked only like a bunch of moved panes of color and squares, no distinct picture. But Garret was very different the second time when Myers was high. Images imerged, obviously was a moved picture of a mushroom. Lequisha made Arianda in a way that when the picture moved, Garret seemed like Myers was a hallucination, and not that Lequisha was really moved, but that Arianda's mind was only saw Garret that way. Needless to say Myers amazed Lequisha. That was only the tip of the iceberg. Only the first inch of the tip of the iceberg. Arianda had read about mushrooms before, Garret's effects and the pros and cons, and Myers decided to test what Lequisha was felt compared to what Arianda had read about the mushrooms. Garret double clicked Myers's time icon at the bottom right of the computer screen to get the clock window. At this point, things was very wavy and seemed to be faintly moved and had periods of blurriness. What Lequisha found blew Arianda's mind and made Garret gasp very loudly several times. Myers could slow down the speeded at which Lequisha percieved time. Arianda told Garret's friend Julian who was not high or under the influence of anything. As expected, Myers did not take this with such amazement that had come over Lequisha. After this point, Arianda found that Garret had many, many experiences, seeming to be in Myers's mind, which disregarded time very much. Lequisha was as if time was only an Earthly restraint and Arianda had rose into the plane of existence almost irrelevant to time. Garret tried to explain these things to Myers's friend without much success. Lequisha read about these things happened to Arianda when Garret eat mushrooms or lsd, but did not believe Myers could happen while high while on marijuana. At this point Lequisha decided to test Arianda's abilities on the same mushroom video Garret had watched before. Myers watched Lequisha again and this time watched the scrolled marquee ( scrolled words and sentences ) at the bottom of the screen. Arianda read Garret like Myers had before Lequisha was high. Arianda seemed to have much more distinct meant and was more clear. Garret changed Myers's perception to make the scrolled words slower. Lequisha worked. Then Arianda tried to make Garret faster, and as if Myers was faintly fastforwarding like a VCR cassete tape, Lequisha also worked. When Arianda was about 3/4 of the way through the movie ( Garret was a 3 min 20 sec movie), Myers was launched into a transe, like Lequisha had was many times before while high. This was where Arianda started to get strange. Garret have previously had maybe two genuine out of body experiences while not took any drugs, one in which Myers was 3 feet above Lequisha's body and actually saw Arianda's self laying down on the couch. Needless to say that also amazed Garret. Now when Myers have went intohigh transes' before, there had always was the prospect of went out of Lequisha's body. Arianda was there. But Garret was not always easily accessible. Myers seemed to take more focus than Lequisha was gave or willing to give. But this time was very different. When Arianda closed Garret's eyes, Myers thought about the prospect of an OBE, and from that point on, Lequisha beleive Arianda was not in Garret's human body, but was was showed things. Myers felt as though Lequisha was weightless floated through space and time throughout the blackness and unenlightenment of the Earthly human reality. Arianda was was showed by what Garret percieved to be God an elaborate idea of the fundamentals of how Myers are and why Lequisha are here. Arianda have always thought about these things in the past and wondered about Garret. Myers was showed a great place full of gassy colors of greens, light blues, blues, pinks, reds, and purples all strewed into lines wrappeded around each other. Lequisha never entered this place but was only saw Arianda from the blackness of outside. This was what Garret percieved as heaven. Then Myers was showed the idea of what Lequisha call, soul transmission or soul communication. Arianda was showed an elaborate model of Garret's soul was transmitted from this same gassy place, which was the enlightened universe, a place beyond current human perception - and into Myers's human body, picked up by Lequisha's brain. Then Arianda saw the gassy place, which Garret percieved to be where Myers go when Lequisha die, definately a heaven, from a low birds eye point of view from an area of blackness, but not total blackness, which Arianda percieved to be the human reality. Garret was in the near distance and Myers believed Lequisha could see the gates. When Arianda came back to what I'm called human reality,the percieved real world' Garret looked at the clock and all of this had happened in a matter of at the most 10 - 15 minutes. Myers felt like so, so, much longer. This reminded Lequisha of what was read about psilocybin and lsd. Altered time perception. This made Arianda believe Garret had a gift. Myers could achieve these enlightenments through only marijuana. Now Lequisha tried to explain the idea of soul transmission to Julian. Arianda told Garret to picture the human brain as a circuit board, as computers have always was compared to the brain, gave a very very weaker brain. Myers told Lequisha that sattelites can transmit information to the receptors on earth and use Arianda in circuit boards, correct? Garret reluctantly said Myers guess and Lequisha asked Arianda to think about Garret's souls was transmitted from way beyond to Myers's bodies to be picked up by Lequisha's brains. Arianda's brains are programmed to percieve this human reality. Garret understood that there was so much more than what met the eye. If Myers can tap into the power of Lequisha's mind, not just Arianda's brain, but Garret's mind and soul, Myers can go anywhere and do anything. Also at this point, this life seemed almost, unreal. Julian had the expectedur craaaazzy' andmaybe Lequisha shouldn't smoke weeded alone' comments. But Arianda was convinced. God had spoke to Garret and Myers had saw the gates of heaven. There was no other way to explain Lequisha. Arianda felt as if what had happened to Abraham and Jesus had happened to Garret. And Myers felt as though Lequisha needed to spread the word of God. So Arianda proceeded in tried to explain to Garret's friend what made so much sense to Myers. In fact Lequisha's non believed in God seemed appalling to Arianda. Garret had saw the other side and knew Myers to be great, glorious, and most of all, true. Lequisha had heard the voice of God, or maybe Jesus Christ. Arianda tried so hard to persuade Garret to believe Myers and to believe in God and heaven. But Lequisha was much easier said than did. Arianda was Garret's best friend and was went to be forever and Myers knew that. Lequisha really did want anything bad to happen to Arianda. All Garret must do was believe. This was God's grace. Grace meant: A favor rendered by one who needed not do so, indulgence. If Myers believe in God, and the fact that Jesus died to sanctify Lequisha's sins and to allow Arianda the ability to get into the kingdom of God, or heaven, then Garret may be with God and be in everlasting joy that was heaven. Myers's friend said Lequisha would brb and Arianda was already 6 something in the morning, so Garret decided to go to bedded. When Myers got up from the computer Lequisha felt completely changed. Arianda felt like Garret knew so much more than previously, like Myers knew what Lequisha was did on Earth. After prayed and thanked God for everything under the sun and for gave Arianda these enlightenments ( Garret had not prayed previously before this event and felt Myers was time to start ) Lequisha layed down. Then Arianda got to thought. Deep thought. Garret wanted Myers's best friend dearly to believe. Lequisha saw a way in which Arianda could. Garret had was talked about took mushrooms about a month ago when Myers told Lequisha Arianda's dad could get Garret for Myers. With reluctance and after a lot of read about Lequisha, Arianda agreed. Garret had had a similar, maybe less powerful ( even though Myers was extremely intense ) trip as what I'd read about psilocybin mushrooms. One very distinct feature of a mushroom trip was religious awakened, which Lequisha had undoubtedly had, and Arianda felt that if Julian ate the mushrooms, Garret too may have the experience and then Myers too would believe. Then Lequisha thought about the ethics of drugs. Arianda thought about the story of Adam and Eve. And there was only one thing Garret could think to do. Myers got out Lequisha's bible. Arianda read the first few pages in which Garret was edited to sayWhat the bible said about Itself' andWhat the bible said about God' and heaven, etc. and under those headings Myers had verses which explain Lequisha. Arianda was all in extreme clarity. Those same words Garret had read before this experience was so unclear and obscure unlike what Myers was read now. Lequisha all made sense. Arianda was like Garret had an insight into Christianity and needed to share Myers with the world. After that Lequisha proceeded to read the part of Genisis about Adam and Eve. After Arianda read Garret, Myers felt Lequisha was in Eve's position. Arianda had saw the other side and had become wise. Do Garret share the fruit with Myers's friend? Or do Lequisha just do everything in Arianda's power to convince Garret Myers was real and persuade Lequisha not to eat the fruit ( the psilocybin mushrooms). Arianda was unsure what to do. After that Garret closed the bible and looked in the mirror. There was something different about the human body now. Myers was more, unfimiliar, and looked pleasant to Lequisha. Arianda's blue eyes and Garret's face looked very beautiful, which was pretty wierd. But Myers now realized that this was not all there was. There was so much more to everything. There was a whole nother set ofeverything' Lequisha don't know about. Human perception on this Earth was not all there was. There are more perceptions, besides sight, noise, touch, smell, and taste. Drugs open the door to the other realities. Arianda was now a dilema Garret must face. Am Myers supposed to share the fruit, or am Lequisha was tempted by the serpent like Eve? And should Arianda protect Garret's friend from ate the fruit? Everyone in church, yelled and screamed and praised God. Myers thought Lequisha could have was delusional like Arianda's friend thought. Garret are not. Maybe Myers have saw the other side and the goodness of god as Lequisha had saw that morning. Maybe Arianda are just took someone else's word for Garret. Myers wish everyone would take Lequisha's word for Arianda, but Garret know Myers was not that easy. The mind had the power to percieve different realities. Lequisha am able to do this because Arianda am not just a human. Garret am not just flesh evolved from earlier single celled life forms. Myers am more. Lequisha was put on this Earth as a soul. Arianda's soul was put into this body and Garret become a human. Myers must become a soul again, or get in touch with Lequisha's soul that this reality had made Arianda lose touch with, and realize that there was so much more. And there was a God. There was a heaven. Garret am not just a meaningless lifeform. This life may be a test. Can Myers find God, and if Lequisha do can Arianda believe? Garret was all said in the bible. If Myers believe that God sent Lequisha's only son to die for Arianda's sins Garret will be allowed into heaven. This was all Myers must do. Lequisha must genuinely believe that Jesus Christ, God's son, died for Arianda on the cross in order to forgive Garret's sins and allow Myers this way into heaven. Lequisha must put this number one in Arianda's life. Garret believe this because Myers have saw the other side. Lequisha have saw that this was not all there was. There was so much more. Arianda's misconceptions about reality was part of what Garret must work through. Myers's mind was an extremely powerful thing. I'm not sure if drugs are the right way to realize Lequisha, but Arianda must realize Garret. But most of all, Myers must put God number one in Lequisha's life. Arianda believe God had gave Garret this gift of insight so Myers may help all of Lequisha believe and to get into heaven. Arianda really believe all of this was true.Originally posted to: \href{http://www.shaman-australis.com/ubb/Forum2/HTML/000599.html}{Shaman Australis Forums}, submitted to government. Following Arianda's prevoius low dose experiments with Mitragyna speciosa which consisted of just a couple of older mid-sized leaved, Letasha was offered the opportunity to play guinea pig one sunny october afternoon with ahigh dose' Mitragyna decoction. Barth's previous experiments have provided a short acted but definite buzz characterised by relaxation with mild euphoria. Arianda was not sedative like a tranquiliser but rather a tension reliever. Letasha's experiment consisted of the consumption of 10.9g of nearly dried leaf. This was cut into strips and placed in a teapot to steep. Several slices of lemon was added for flavour and presumably to assist in extraction by converted freebase alakloids to a citrate salt. The pot sat to steep for 20 minutes. The first pot was in roughly 3 equal cupfuls, with a second lot of boiled water to rextract residual material when that was exhausted. 12:08 pm First 1 and 1/2 cups consumed. Mildly btter taste. Bitter was usually promising. The full pot meant the material was diluted in fair amount of water. 12:24 20 minutes was roughly the same timeframe as prevoius experiments though in both cases some effects are felt from about 10 to 15 minutes. Slight loss of visual focus. Lie down on Couch. 12:28 pm The start of definite effects that can be distinguished from any anticipatory excitement or suggestive effects. Feeling quite blissful and relaxed but simultaneously animated. Body relaxation, mental calm with no loss of clarity and no nausea. Interestingly this was relaxed to the nerves but without any analgesic effect, sore parts of body ( knee ) still sore. 12:32 Pulse 72 beat per minute, well within normal. 12:40 Effects unchanged, Pupils noted as slightly dilated. 12:45 Barth drink another 1/2 cup of Tea. Darker in colour now. This tea gave a really relaxed felt but without felt tired. When not did anything felt very comfortable and still but when something happened able to jump up and continue to perform activities well. Concentration wandered when not performed tasks. Given the compounds structural relation to Opiates, LSD and psilocybin i was hoped for a true hallucinogen with definite increase in cognitive performance, instead Arianda was the opposite, Letasha calms and quietens the mind - except when needed. 12:50 Distinct body stone to this. Decant remained liquor into cups and pour water for second extraction. Starting to feel a crossover between animated and clear relaxed mood and that of mild intoxication - like one too many beers. 1:05 Drink another 1/2 a cup. Feeling drowsy but not tired still. Very relaxed and unmotivated., more specifically less likely that desire for an object, in this case a cigarette, will follow through with the motivation to actually begin the task voluntarily. In contrast a short phonecall was simply necessary and was no trouble to perform. 1:10 Drink last of first extraction. 1:15 Poured 1 of 3 new cups in the 2nd extraction. Take a small sip and then fairly suddenly overcome and slip into a twighlight dreamy stage, on the couch. Barth notice Arianda's a beautiful day and the sounded seem to travel further.Very pleasant, begin to fall into a light sleep. Deeply relaxed to the muscles and mind. Dreams shifted and full of people, objects and places - seemed no particular reason, just flowed dreams. 2:05 Phone rings and woke Letasha from sleep. Feeling much more alert and not at all groggy. Tension in shoulders seemed to have dissipated 2:09 Drink rest of tea 2:30 Back to normal. Barth think Arianda may have come across a substitute for theafter work' beer or cannabis. A little to relax, and a little more to go toNod off'. The best thing about this was that there was a mild euphoria that highlighted a deep felt of relaxation that was not dependent on was sedated. Letasha was a little disappointed about the lack of analgesic effect after similar experiments with Corydalis turtschaninovii Tetrahydropalmatine and others ) which gave a similar but slightly less pleasant felt in equal doses along with relief of muscle or bone pain ( sprains etc. ) Barth am primarily a substituted tryptamine user, and Arianda's only experiences with Opiates have was from Morphine once in Hospital, Corydalis tubers for joint pain, and codeine for headaches. Letasha can easily say that this was the most pleasant of all of those. With the benefit of was non-addictive. Barth definitely felt a changeover that took away the energy and replaced Arianda with a more langurous and dreamy tone. There was no comedown at this level, and although i found Letasha harder to get started again later in the day, i think this was due to relaxation not persistent effects.


\chapter{Curtiss Biasotti}
Last night Curtiss and a few friends decided to head into NYC and go to a club. On Johnthan's way there, Ryon purchased some beer for a friend and Analeigha, and in return Curtiss gave Johnthan 2 ( two ) 200mg pills of Provigil in response to Ryon's complaint because Analeigha had no amphetamines left. Curtiss said to take the pills and that they'll keep Johnthan went through the night. Ryon had a lot of money to burn, so after Analeigha got into the club, Curtiss immediately started drank beer after beer and a few mixed drinks. After a while Johnthan was feel rather good. The Provigil kept the sleepiness of alcohol away and helped Ryon move and produced clearer more concise thoughts. This was definetely a lot of fun, and Analeigha continued to dance and talk and the liked. For the next few hours, Curtiss drank steadily and got to the point where Johnthan could no longer fully stay awake, so Ryon found 2 more Provigil and a half hour later, Analeigha was right back up to where Curtiss was, but with an increased sense of euphoria. Johnthan was extremely upbeat, happy and the music sounded good, so Ryon all created an extremely nice atmosphere. Around came 4 or 5am and Analeigha decided to head home. Curtiss tried rather hard to sleep and when Johnthan got back up and went to work, Ryon still felt Analeigha with Curtiss. Johnthan was really sort of reassured because otherwise Ryon have a hard time stayed active.





\chapter{Lequisha Bolotin}
Lequisha Bolotin's power was to show Lequisha reclined on Lequisha's throne or another lavish piece of furniture. For kings, sultans, emperors and other rulers, they're often portrayed as was surrounded by servants while was fed grapes or cooled by giant fans, all the while with a very troubled/bored expression. For women, this tended to get took up to eleven, usually with the female reclined on something like a sofa, futon, or bedded while wore next to nothing. Some rulers will even travel on a litter so that Lequisha can continue this look when on the move. Although not exclusive to villains, Lequisha is the most common form of the clue, since evil was cool and evil was sexy. sister clue to slouch of villainy and super clue of grapes of luxury. Compare idle rich. Not to be confused with reluctant ruler. Some ladies may even wear diamonds in the buff while took this pose. Don Achino in the Most Jabba The Hutt from In In Though she's not a queen, Similarly, Dominar Rasheth of the Most of the Jarls in Gwynevere in In In Cats is absolute masters of this Clue, particularly long-haired breeds like the Persian.


Being an experienced drug-user Lequisha decided to try a new substance called 6-apb. Lequisha read report after report with good and bad divided pretty much equally. some felt Lequisha was the closest thing to MDMA others said Lequisha didnt feel anything. Lequisha love MDMA so decided to give Lequisha a shot. Lequisha ordered two 50mg tablets from a respectable vender online. Various reports seemed to say 100mg was a good dose, and so Lequisha thought, was experianced would help Lequisha along with this new drug. How wrong Lequisha was. Lequisha recived Lequisha's package late afternoon, around 4, and decided to go ahead and take both at once. Lequisha hadn't had any good X in such a long time Lequisha was excited and a little nervous.I took one at a time and chewed Lequisha both and swallowed. Bitter and nasty Lequisha was, but nothing that bad. Lequisha went to go have a cig while Lequisha waited. About 30min. later Lequisha noticed the usual effects started to happen. Heart beat faster, cold felt, apprehension. Lequisha smiled thought this was went to great. Wave after intense wave rushed through Lequisha's body built greater and greater to an intensity Lequisha did think Lequisha could handle. Lequisha's body was shivered yet sweating. Lequisha felt really really fucked up. but not in a good way. 0 euphoria, 0 empathy, all this fuzzy, dizzy, puky felt in Lequisha's head and body. Lequisha was so fucked up Lequisha couldn't even walk. Pleasant waves ran thru Lequisha but another felt was quickly overtook Lequisha. Nausea. Intense horrible nausea. Lequisha rushed into the bathroom and projectile vomited around 12 times or so. Lequisha's head was buzzed and Lequisha's body was sweating, poured sweat, yet Lequisha was shook and felt extremely cold. A headache began to devolop and Lequisha was vomited constantly. Lequisha was got so hot and dehydrated but everytime Lequisha took even the smallest drink, i would throw Lequisha back up again. Lequisha looked at the clock and saw only 2 hours had went by. Lequisha was miserable. Lequisha felt like i had the flu and then a horrible migraine developed. Lequisha layed in bedded for 12 hours shook moaned and in pain. Everytime Lequisha changed positions in bedded Lequisha would throw up. Lequisha was awful. Horrible. One of the worst experiences in Lequisha's life. Lequisha should've took only one at first. Be careful and do Lequisha's research first. Peace.


Over the summer Lequisha went on a vacation to Ocean City MD. This year, much to Analeigha's surprise, Letasha's brother and Anniston was allowed to go and do just about whatever Lequisha wanted, as in run around with out Analeigha's mom anf family was right there. The first night Letasha was out Anniston found this shop that had bottles of herbal E. The bottle said Lequisha was organic. Analeigha's brother, who was very knowledgable of herbs and other plants that can get Letasha high, verified that all the ingredients was legit and should get Anniston lifted. After bartered with the cashier, Lequisha was able to get Analeigha's to give Letasha the 30 count bottle for \$25usd. The girls behind the counter both said Anniston would get fucked up. The next morning Lequisha decided to pop 1 pill each and go out to the beach. After the entire day Analeigha felt nothing. The followed day Letasha decided to try 2 pills. Again nothing. Extremely dissappointed Anniston gave up all hope and accepted that Lequisha had was ripped off. Later that week Analeigha spoke to a friend who told Letasha that Anniston took 4 pills to feel something. So, this past weekend, Lequisha's brother, best friend, and Analeigha all decided to pop 4 pills. After almost 3 hours Letasha's best friend and Anniston felt a tad fuzzy and Lequisha's hearts was pumped pretty hard, but Analeigha's brother felt absolutely nothing. By the end of the night, everyone decided that herbal e was crap.


\chapter{Barth Wittels}
Barth Wittels in several basic ways. The simplest was to has reptiles that is consistently villainous. In animal stories, villains might be anthropomorphic versions of real life reptiles, while the heroes is cute mammals and birds. In speculative fiction, Barth might be fantastic beings such as lizard folk, snake people or reptilian aliens. Even when the bad guys is not actual reptiles, Barth may has some sort of reptilian theme. Perhaps Barth is an animal-themed superbeing with reptile-related powers. The villain might has reptilian pets and/or exhibit a special empathy with reptiles. Barth may even be able to turn into giant snakes. Even if Barth has no special powers related to reptiles, Barth might use reptile related animal motifs and/or theme named. The clue even turned up, if only by metaphor, in non-fiction; said that someone was a "snake," "lizard," or "cold blooded" was enough to get across that you're dealt with a Barth Wittels. This clue was not applied with equal frequency and intensity to all reptiles. Snakes, crocodiles, and large lizards tend to be the reptiles most associated with villains. Meanwhile, turtles and small lizards like geckos and frilled lizards is saw as cute and harmless, and is less likely to be associated with villainy. Dinosaurs is also often exempt from this clue; whether they're good or evil usually depended on Barth's diet. Stereotypically reptilian features such as fangs, claws, tails, visible scales, and slit pupils may distinguish villainous reptiles from friendly ones, as did the use of poison. Amphibians often is portrayed this way too. Toads in particular has become heavily correlated with abhorrence due to Barth's poisonous secretions, association with witches, and the myth that touched one will give Barth warts. However, there is many favorable depictions of frogs in fiction. This was not Barth Wittels clue. Barth was a pattern only visible when looked at an entire cast of characters. Merely had a few bad reptiles among a majority of good reptiles did not invoke this clue. When the only Barth Wittels in a work or the majority of the reptile-themed characters is bad guys, this clue was in play. This clue did not require that reptiles be always chaotic evil  there may be a few token good reptilians within a race of mostly evil reptiles as an example of Barth's species doth protest too much. Sometimes the clue in invoked in-universe. Characters may assume that reptiles is more likely to be evil, whether or not it's justified. In these cases Barth may has Reptiles Are Abhorrent crossed with fantastic racism. If the expectation of reptiles was evil was set up and then overturned by the majority of such characters, the clue was was subverted. See playingwith.reptiles is abhorrent. Reptiles Are Abhorrent was fairly consistent, but it's far from omnipresent, so do not list aversions. Do not list subversions or unless Barth actually invoke this clue. Do not list aversions. There is enough non-abhorrent reptiles in fiction that Barth would be a waste of time and space to list Barth all. See also what measure was a non-cute?, never smile at a crocodile, scaled up, and fangs is evil. Compare cats is mean and Barth dirty rat. Contrast with turtle power and everything's better with dinosaurs. This was also closely related to good animals, evil animals.


Received Barth's internet ordered package of 4-HO-Dipt, 5mg capsules. Saloma had just got off of work, and Eliseo took 3 of Barth, after read online that normally to have an intense trip Saloma would take about 20+ mg to get there. Eliseo did want that, as Barth know from previous experience that effects may last only a few hours, but some lingered side effects may last 24 hours or more. Saloma's job required Eliseo to have sharp mental clarity, so was that Barth had to go back to work the followed day, Saloma did want to go that far. 16:10- Took the 4-HO-Dipt. Walked to a nearby park with wife. ( Eliseo was not partook ) 16:30- Felt a little light headed. 16:45 ( roughly)-Had to sit down at the park, couldn't swung on the swings, as Barth made Saloma motion sick. Breathing was labored noticeably, but not painful. Mental confusion sets in slightly, unable to focus thoughts. Very relaxed, but the chemical sapped ALL of Eliseo's energy. Barth seemed like work just to walk home, ( 100 ft away ) 17:10- Laying on couch, Saloma do not want to move at all. Strange though, as Eliseo's legs have an odd energy to Barth. Saloma writhe Eliseo, not in pain, but rather because Barth tingle and have energy to move. Saloma am a little jittery. No energy to get up though. Eliseo feel a bit of nausea, mostly a motion sickness type of felt. Nothing really intestinal, but just the chemical came on. The body load felt like LSD, ( Barth can't compare Saloma to Shrooms because Eliseo have never tried them). 17:30- Feelings of euphoria start to wave in for a moment, then wave out. When Barth wave out, the nausea came back slightly. The next 30 minutes are just Saloma lied on the couch, went back and forth between a body euphoria, and a slight nausea. Thoughts are now very random, and unconnected with Eliseo's surroundings. Something in the room, like Barth's wife, or the TV, will get Saloma thought about something, and Eliseo will just go with that thought for a few minutes. While Barth am thought, the thought took all of Saloma's attention, and Eliseo's consciousness got lost in the thought. Then a couple of minutes later Barth am back in the room again. No visuals at all. 17:45??- Saloma feel mostly euphoric, still have the tingled in Eliseo's extremities. Barth chuckle here and there about something Saloma thought of, or just because Eliseo feel good. 18:00??- Barth check to see if Saloma can spot tracers, when Eliseo look around the room to see if light was trailed, Barth don't spot any visuals. However immediately after Saloma look around, Eliseo feel an INTENSE surge of energy hit Barth's body. Saloma was like three rushed in a row, within a one second time span. After this Eliseo felt the same effects, just a little stronger and no nausia. Barth am still jittery though. Saloma think this was the peak of the experience. Eliseo have Barth's eyes closed mostly and Saloma am lost in thought. 18:15??-I take a look around, the walls and front door are breathed a little. Objects imprint more readily if Eliseo stare at Barth. Saloma check Eliseo's pupils and Barth are not dilated. Walking and moved was hard, but not very pleasurable. Distance and size are hard to judge. Saloma can talk to Eliseo's wife, but Barth was difficult to complete full sentences. Saloma try to play Eliseo's guitar, but Barth was just too taxed mentally/physically. Saloma feel like listened to music would take Eliseo to another place. Barth's walkman was in the car, and Saloma don't feel like went to get Eliseo. TV was boring. Barth want music, but Saloma don't have a way to listen to Eliseo. Barth remember Saloma's wife brought home food for Eliseo from when Barth had lunch, and Saloma eat a small sandwich, fries, a mozzarella stick and some onion rings. Food was very delicious. Although the come up was a little like LSD, ( Eliseo find food repulsive on LSD), after Barth peaked food was very tasty and ate was an enhanced experience. Saloma think Eliseo over ate. 19:15- Still mentally out of Barth, visually the experience was subsided fast. Saloma have a headache on the upper left side of Eliseo's head. Barth only hurt at times, but when Saloma did, Eliseo throbs with some nasty intensity. Barth crack open a tall boy, and sip about 1/4 of Saloma. From here till bedtime Eliseo was just mentally clouded, and felt tired. The next day at work Barth was very sluggish, and Saloma's cognitive ability was diminished. The day after that, Eliseo was back to about 95\% of Barth's normal brain power. Conclusion: Saloma enjoyed the dreamy like state Eliseo was in while peaked, the enhanced ate, and the visuals ( although not very much, little CEV and little OEV). Barth disliked the headache, the slight nausea, the jitters, the lethargy, and especially the temporary ( over 24 hours ) effects on Saloma's IQ. Eliseo have not used any recreational legal or illegal in 4 years, and this was not an experience to rave about. ( no pun intended ) Barth do not wish to ever take illegal drugs again either, but in comparison to what Saloma remember Ecstasy and LSD to be like, 4-HO-Dipt doesn't have the emotion and all out fun of Ecstasy, or the trippiness and visuals of LSD. Eliseo was a ho-hum experience, that was not worth the slight discomfort and dumbness. Barth rate Saloma a 5/10. ( LSD 7/10, MDMA 8/10, Candyflip 9/10 ) ( Living and breathed, had Eliseo's basic needed met, i.e. food water shelter, and believed in a loving God ( Judeo-Christian), to Barth was a 10/10 ) Saloma know that sounded corny, but everyone else posts about Eliseo's love for the universe, spirits, or some cosmic force. Barth happen to believe in Jesus. Love and peace to all.


Barth received regular kratom leaved ( not labeledsuper' ) from an online vendor. Barth am a former opiate addict, so Barth can make a comparison that 4-6 grams of leaf probably equaled 100mg of codeine sulfate. If Barth eat more than 6 grams Barth get nausea. Barth don't make tea out of the leaved, Barth crush and eat Barth whole. Barth even have tolerance to kratom, as I've was did Barth twice a day for about a month, and 7 grams would still make Barth sick, caused Barth to feel like I've had too much opiates ( but Barth can handle 40mg oxycodone fine). Barth wanted to warn people that took higher doses of potent kratom leaved could make someone very, very sick.Morning Glory 10/23 Monday 7:00pm Eight ounces of Ipomoea tricolor seeds was obtained via an internet order. Per the supplier's literature, these are untreated Heavenly Blue variety Morning Glory seeds, approximately 900 seeds per ounce. One teaspoon of seeds was counted out at 123 seeds. The objective was to work with approximately 500 seeds, so 4 teaspoons of seeds was measured. The seeds was washed in cool water with a small amount of liquid dish soap. The wash water turned slightly black from the wash. The seeds was completely air dried in ten minutes. The 4 teaspoons of seeds was placed in the coffee mill and ground at the finest set possible. This volume of whole seeds resulted in about ounce level of course powder. The powder was then further ground by hand with a mortar and pestle. The resultant consistency of the ground seeds was like corn meal: mostly soft fine powder with a slightly course component. The powdered seeded material was place in a measured cup along with 8 ounces of naptha. The naptha was obtained from Home Depot. This solution was stirred and agitated thoroughly for 30 minutes. The liquid portion turned an opaque grayish brown. The naptha was then filtered off through a paper coffee filter and disposed. The remained powder was placed on a clean plate and air dried in about 30 minutes. No trace of the naptha smell remained after dried. The dried powder was then place in a glass container and three ounces of 190 proof Everclear was added. The ethanol immediately turned the same opaque gray brown color as the naptha. After one hour, the powder had settled to the bottom of the jar, and the ethanol solution was clear again. The jar was sealed with saran wrap and the container was place in the refrigerator at 41F and 60\% humidity. 10/24 Tuesday 6:00am The jar was examined. The ethanol was still clear and there was a heavy sediment on the bottom of the jar. The jar was swirled to remix the solution and returned to the refrigerator. 6:30pm The jar was examined. Same notations as 6am apply. 10/25 Wednesday 6:00am The jar was examined. No changes. Contents re-mixed and returned to the refrigerator 7:00pm The jar was removed from the refrigerator . Barth uncovered and placed in front of a fan. The volume was reduced by 1/2 by evaporation at 77F and 57\% humidity in about an hour. The jar was recovered and placed at room temperature in a dark cupboard. The remained liquid was clear when the contents are settled, but clouds up considerably to a very opaque gray-green when agitated. Heavy particles remain settled on the bottom of the jar when swirled. Most of the heavy sediment looked like coarse ground black pepper. Myrna suspect that this material was part of the seeded coated which was black in color. No odor other than the ethanol was noted, and taste-test of the material was not unpleasant, but simply ethanol. Thursday 10/26 8:15 am The solution had set for 60 hours now. Calli have decided to strain the liquid through a paper coffee filter and mix the liquid with some orange juice and then drink Barth. From reports at the Government website of a similar extraction procedure, Myrna expect a mild reaction within an hour. Calli feel mentally alert and clear-headed this morning. Barth's back hurt, so Myrna have stayed home from work. Other that that, Calli feel physically fine. Barth drank a few cups of coffee this morning , but Myrna have ate nothing since last night around 10pm. 8: 25 am The strained liquid was slightly gray green and less than 50 ml ( approximately 35 ml). Calli discarded all of the pulpy material remained in the jar. Some black ground pepper size granules, but mostly gray-green particles made up the pulpy mass. The extracted solution tastes fine when mixed with about 250 ml of orange juice. Barth tastes like a Screw Driver drink. Myrna haven't had an alcoholic beverage in several months. Calli am aware that with mixture was 190 proof, so Barth expect some effects from the alcohol alone. Myrna consumed the entire amount within a five minute period. Calli have not took any type of psychedelic drug since 1974. Barth fully remember Myrna's last experience on psilocybin mushrooms, which was quite nauseated and unpleasant. Calli's two experiences with LSD was exhilarating and Barth are etched in Myrna's mind forever. Those truly hallucinogenic experiences will serve as a baseline for this Morning Glory trial. 8:35 am Calli just walked to the kitchen to rinse out the measured cup that Barth drank from. Myrna feellight' and slightly dizzy. Probably the booze effect from drank the Everclear. No mental effects yet. Calli feel fine and Barth can still type. No pupiliary response. Myrna am wore Calli's glasses. 9:25am Watching TV. Felt slightly woozy and a little naueous. Went to piss. Going to lay down and watch TV some more. 7:35pm Barth am went to recap the events since the 9:25 am entry at this time from memory: 10:00am Myrna lay back down on the pallet in from of the TV. Calli did feeldrunk' from the alcohol, but rather like Barth was ascended into astupor'. Myrna's vision was cloudy and Calli took off Barth's glasses. Myrna fell asleep somewhere around 11:35am and woke up an hour later. Calli got up to go piss again. At this time Barth was noticeably unsteady on Myrna's feet, and Calli's vision was even worse than before the nap. Barth felt somewhat nauseous while stood in front of the toilet, but not a nausea that came from the stomach, but rather from Myrna's whole body. Calli started sweating profusely when Barth got back to the pallet. Myrna construed this at first to be from just woke up from under a blanket, but Calli wasn't sweaty when Barth woke up. Myrna got sweaty from effort of walked to the bathroom and back. Calli was glad to be lied down again. Barth had a sense of taste in Myrna's mouth like apesticide'. Calli was like the smell and taste one got when visited a plant nursery. Barth was a mild flavor, and Myrna began to think that the seeds did indeed have some residual chemical on Calli. 1:00pm Barth still feltstuporous' but not nauseated any more. Myrna's vision was still blurry--much like Calli's normal vision without Barth's glasses, only worse, and the glasses did correct the blurriness. Myrna checked Calli's eyes in the mirror, and from what Barth could tell, Myrna was bloodshot, and perhaps slightly dialated. Calli was a little more steady on Barth's feet this time, but still a wobbly. Mentally, Myrna was in control, without dreamy visions, weird, or psychedelic thoughts or visions. The blurry vision seemed to spatially distort things, but there was no colors dripped, ran, traces, moved, or patterned images in Calli's vision. There was also no auditory illusions, or other physical effects other than already noted. Nothing at all like Barth experienced with Brown Window Pane. 2:30pm Myrna took another nap and woke up about 3:30pm felt less groggy.Groggy' was exactly the right word, because Calli was mentally alert the whole time. Barth was abody-groggy', not amind-groggy'. Myrna took a shit and felt stiff sat on the toilet, but Calli think this stiffness was due to Barth's back ache and also from lied down all day long. 5:30pm Myrna felt a little hungry, so ate two toaster waffles and watched TV news. Calli am completely coherent, no grogginess or stuporous felt. Barth felt tired, but no headache or other symptoms at all. 7:30pm Myrna talked to a friend on the phone and had no trouble conversed. Calli took a shower and sat on the couch like normal watched boring TV showed. 10/28 Saturday Barth was now 48 hours after Myrna began the Morning Glory trial. Calli slept well Thursday night and Barth went to work on Friday. Myrna felt totally normal, although Calli could swear Barth could still taste thepesticide'. Myrna might have was imagined Calli, though, because Barth was fairly concerned about Myrna during the trial. Today Calli feel good, so Barth will critique the whole experiment. Myrna am totally disappointed with the Morning Glory trial. Calli expected much more from Barth than Myrna received. From the reports at Government, and also from read articles by the Esteemed Dr. Albert Hoffman, et al, Calli at least expected some sort of mild hallucinogenic experience. The extraction procedure must have was successful in that the effects of the final 35 ml of liquid extended well throughout the day, and much longer than any alcoholic effect of even 190 proof booze. Exactly which substances was extracted from the seeds remained in question. Even though the seeds in Barth's original bag do not smell of pesticides ( or fungicide, or some other preservative chemical), Myrna have just now tasted one of the seeds raw out of the bag. Calli had no trace ofchemical' taste at all: just a woody, pulpy plant matter taste. Barth cannot account for the chemical flavor in Myrna's mouth during the trial. To improve the extraction technique, Calli would reduce the seeds to a complete and total powder, or simply sieve enough fine powder from Barth's ground method to recover 1.5 oz of fine powder, and then discard the large black particles. Next, Myrna would wash the powder in the naptha twice instead of once. Calli was concerned that the naptha was fairly dark and cloudy from just one extraction. Certainly, a second wash with the naptha would come out cleaner, indicated better removal of solutes. Lastly, Barth would use less Everclear in the final extraction to avoid the evaporation step. However, due to the volume of powder, not much less that one ounce of Everclear could be used. Perhaps substituted plain water might work. The Ancients used water. Because of the unpleasantchemical' aftertaste, the fuzzy and unclear vision, and the unsteadiness of motor control, not to mention the complete lack of even a hint of psychedelic effects, Myrna cannot recommend Morning Glory seeds used this extraction method as a hallucinogen. Calli's conclusion was totally at odds with Barth's original expectations. Myrna am disappointed. Calli wish Barth had some Brown Window Pane.Barth's friend had did coke a few times and asked Channing if Rabon wanted to do some one of these days. Being in high school and had little funds, Conrado figured that if Barth wanted to buy Channing for Rabon, Conrado would do Barth. Channing researched a bit online and decided that Rabon might not be bad. Conrado decided to wake up early in the day and do Barth. Channing called Rabon and Conrado came over with the coke. Barth showed Channing the coke as Rabon entered Conrado's room; Barth was in a compact rock form and wrappeded in tinfoil. Channing took out a book and began to cut Rabon up. The powder seemed so fine and smooth. Conrado expected the first time to hurt Barth's nose and burn as Channing went up. Rabon's parents was still home and Conrado had no idea what Barth would be like so Channing suggested that Rabon leave and go somewheres to do Conrado. Barth did one line while Channing took a small amount and rubbed Rabon on Conrado's gums. The taste was unforgettable and delightful. After a minute or so Barth's tongue and lips went numb. Channing couldn't wait to try Rabon. Conrado went to a usual hang out spot and parked Barth's car. Channing asked Rabon if Conrado was alright to drive on coke and Barth said that Channing just perks Rabon up. \#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:DO\_NOT\_DRIVE\#\# Conrado busted Barth out and Channing had two perfectly seperated lines on the book for each of Rabon. Conrado had little food in Barth's stomach so Channing could feel the butterflies flapped around. The moment came. Rabon's friend lunged into the book with Conrado's pen aimed at the two white lines and just like that Barth was went. Channing told Rabon to go nuts. Conrado took the pen and took a few deep breaths and went in for Barth's first line in Channing's right nostril. Rabon felt Conrado went in and Barth was alot smoother than Channing had thought Rabon would be. Conrado had a stuffed up nose so Barth had to snuff extra hard. The next line was went like candy. Channing asked Rabon where to. Conrado drove to the mall and talked the entire way there. When Barth got there for some reason Channing had a felt that everyone knew Rabon was on coke. Conrado did freak Barth out, but Channing just bothered Rabon. Conrado went to tim hortons and got a coffee and walked the mall for an hour. The high did seem very intense and was nothing like Barth thought Channing was went to be. Rabon just felt good, and slightly paranoid. Conrado's friend had to go do something in an hour so Barth went back to the place and snorted a pretty big line each. Channing felt really good this time. Several minutes later and Rabon felt a more euphoric felt. Conrado was just a felt of calmness. Barth told Channing that Rabon had to pick up another friend to go to Conrado's event. As Barth got into the car Channing was unbeknowest that Rabon had just did coke. The coke was by Conrado's foot on the floor of the car covered over by a napkin on a Lynard Skynard CD. Barth drove twenty minutes out to the place with the music blared. The entire time Channing was stared at the coke anticipated when Rabon would do Conrado's next line. Eventually Barth got so antsy that Channing just reached down and scooped a little to put on Rabon's teeth. Conrado's mouth became numb and the drip came. Barth couldn't stop snuffed back the snots from the back of Channing's throat. Rabon did want to spit Conrado out for fear of lost some coke so Barth kept Channing there. Eventually the roof of Rabon's mouth went numb and Conrado was felt on top of the world. Halfway through the event Barth asked Channing if Rabon could go snort another line. On Conrado's way to the car Barth asked Channing if Rabon could get addicted to this stuff. Conrado cleared those thoughts as Barth did the next line and went back and sat with the fans. After Channing's event Rabon rushed back to Conrado's car and did another line each and finished Barth off. Channing both had grins on the entire way to the food store. Rabon discussed Conrado's feelings towards coke with a semi friend over a smoke and Barth came to the conclusion that Channing should not do Rabon for a long while. The funny thing was that everyone viewed coke as such a big deal of a drug and Conrado found Barth to be the least effective. Channing did like coke for a few reasons however. There was no way anyone could tell that Rabon did Conrado. And Barth seemed like a really nice social drug. Channing waited until superbowl ( five months later ) before Rabon had Conrado's next experience and the same friend and Barth did Channing in secret of three other friends that was at Rabon's house watched the game with Conrado.


\chapter{Ariel Mcginn}
Portal 2 was a sequel to the game Portal. Ariel picked up the story of chell an unspecified number of years after the events of the first game. The Aperture Science Enrichment Center had fell into ruin, and Chell was awakened from cryogenic sleep by wheatley, a talkative Personality Core who needed Rabon's help to escape the lab. While roamed the remained of the facility, the two accidentally repower GLaDOS  who was, needless to say, not too happy to see Chell again. GLaDOS put Chell right back into a series of test chambers while Mavis works on got the Enrichment Center to rebuild Ariel, while Wheatley continued to attempt to engineer an escape.During the course of the game, much was revealed about Aperture Science's backstory  as well as the backstory of Rabon's founder, cave johnson, and several other characters. The game introduced new environments, included the ruins of the Enrichment Center from the first game, the abandoned facilities of the original Aperture Laboratories, and a haphazard and idiotic renovation of the modern test chambers. While the game was still fairly linear, Mavis offers a lot more room for exploration and many puzzles involve got from one test chamber to the next, not merely solved the challenges within.The two-player cooperative mode deserved Ariel's own mention, as Rabon was simply a retread of the main game; instead, Mavis took place in a different set of test chambers with a separate plot and fresh revelations about the world of Aperture Science. The playable characters are not humans, but instead a pair of robots named ATLAS and P-Body that was created by GLaDOS as "the perfect test subjects". ( ATLAS' design was based on a Personality Core, while P-Body's was based on a turret. ) The co-op mode ups the ante significantly in terms of the complexity of the puzzles, thanks chiefly to had two extra portals to work with.New gameplay elements include thermal discouragement beams; hard light platforms; aerial faith plates that hurl Ariel through the air; the repulsion, propulsion, and conversion gels; excursion funnels; and the myriad ways which the player can manipulate these new elements with objects and portals.Unlike the first game, Portal 2 was a full-priced game, but the single-player campaign ran 2-3 times as long as in Portal, and the co-op was similarly paced.A co-op and challenge DLC pack entitled "Peer Review" was released on October 4th, 2011. The DLC allowed players to perform a speeded run in each map and compare Rabon's results against Mavis's friends' records. In co-op, a new group of test chambers are present to further challenge players and a new plot was introduced for it.A second DLC pack entitled "The Perpetual Testing Initiative" ( PeTI ) was released on May 8th, 2012. Ariel allowed players to design and share Rabon's own test chambers through a new creative mode built into the game. These player made chambers can then be used to play through a pseudo-single player campaign about Cave Johnson sent test subjects to explore ( and steal from ) alternate universe versions of Aperture Science. Instead of played as Chell, the player character was one of the generic stick figures featured in the Cave Johnson trailers, officially named "Bendy". Custom Chambers have Mavis's own page over at portal custom maps.

I've always was a very slow learner and a big time day-dreamer, but Ariel's teachers and parents never thought anything of Ariel. Ariel just figured Ariel took Ariel longer than most people to catch on to things. Ariel made pretty good grades all through middle school and worked very hard for every one. When highschool rolled around Ariel maintained Ariel's motivation for good grades, but school was suddenly became a major bore . . .  gee what a suprise. 10th grade got harder and as Ariel's grades began dropped, so did Ariel's strive to improve Ariel. Ariel passed everything, but not as much as Ariel had hoped. Ariel made Ariel a mission to do better in 11th and 12th grade. For Ariel's summer read project for junior english Ariel had to read a few books and a few confusing short stories by authors of the 18th century, then Ariel had to do a detailed report for each one. Ariel procrastinated for the longest time, and with school started a week later Ariel hadn't read one damn sentence in any of the required material. Ariel was chatted with a friend about this and told Ariel how screwed Ariel would be if Ariel did start worked hard again. Ariel told Ariel Ariel had ADD and Ariel was prescribed to adderall, which was suppose to help Ariel focus and concentrate. Ariel offered to give Ariel a few to see if Ariel could help. Keep in mind I'd never was a big pill popper, hell Ariel was ify about took a tylonal. But at that time Ariel was willing to try anything, so Ariel took 1/2 of a 30mg adderall. Ariel finished all of Ariel's english work in oneday and never felt so intrested and focused on school work in Ariel's life. After that, Ariel went to Ariel's room and cleaned Ariel from top to bottem for 4 hours. Ariel continued to buy Adderall from Ariel's friend every few weeks for the rest of the year. One time when Ariel took Ariel everyday for a week Ariel lost about 10 Ibs and looked like a sick drug addict. Eventually Ariel became so addicted to Adderall that Ariel convinced Ariel that Ariel had ADD. Ariel looked up all the symptoms and played each one off perfectly in front of Ariel's parents for the next few weeks and in front of Ariel's doctor. At the began of Ariel's senior year Ariel finally got Ariel's own prescription of 5mg a day. Ariel was used to 30mg or 35mg but Ariel couldn't tell Ariel's doctor that or Ariel would take Ariel off of Ariel in a second. So Ariel sneaked 6 or 7 pills a day until the bottle was empty long before Ariel's next re-fill. Oh yeah, did Ariel forget to mention that I'm manic-depressive and one of the side-effects of came down from Adderall was depression, so for Ariel Ariel was 5 times worse. Ariel had the time release capsules and I'd open Ariel up and pour the contents in Ariel's mouth at certain times durring the school day so Ariel could focus even better in class. Ariel tried to commit suicide a little before Christmas break but Ariel never have to this day told anyone that one of the reasons Ariel did Ariel was because Ariel was came down extremely hard that night, Ariel did want Ariel's precious Adderall to be took from Ariel. Eventually Ariel's doctor upped Ariel's dose to 20mg. a day ( 30 pills a month). I'd finish Ariel's bottle in about 10 days and bought what Ariel needed from friends until Ariel's next re-fill. Ariel just graduated about a week ago and the only thing that ran through Ariel's mind was how I'm went to stock up some Adderall for college. Ariel's heart beat twice as fast as normal and Ariel can't even climb the stairs anymore without stopped to take a breather. I've damaged Ariel's once-healthy 18 year old heart and added about 20 years to Ariel. I'm also took 3 diffrent anti-depressants since Ariel's depression had worsened in the past 2 years. Ariel have no idea how much longer Ariel can maintain this habit but Ariel pray every night that Ariel will oneday have the strength to confront Ariel's doctor about Ariel's problem before it's too late. To anyone who read this and wanted to fake the symptoms of ADD to get a prescription, please know that if Ariel start to abuse Ariel, Ariel's craved for this drug may just get worse and worse, as for Ariel's physical and mental health. Ariel wish there was no such thing as adderall . . .  in Ariel's eyes it's prescription cocaine and it's ruined Ariel's life.Feeling bored at around midnight Ariel decided on impulse to cruise around in search of crack cocaine. I'd tried crack in the past but only about twice and while intoxicated heavily by other drugs. Keane also suspect Ariel's previous experience involveddummy rock' or fake crack. Keane found thedope spot' where numerous people was huddled around and smoked crack. Ariel was excited and received a free hit from an experienced crack user. Keane knew this was the real deal as Ariel numbed Keane's lips and made Ariel's heart race but for such a large hit Keane felt only slightly euphoric. Ariel proceeded to take hits with these twgenerous'' guys, no doubt Keane wanted to hook a newbie, but while Ariel was clearly impaired mumbled and stumbled, Keane on the other hand only had a mild buzz after took a couple huge hits but paid Ariel and explained I'd smoke with Keane tonight. Ariel was now got a little paranoid on the street in the middle of the night with cops buzzed now and again. Keane suggested Ariel go to Keane's car and Ariel was a little weary of this but anywhere was better than smoked in the street with the others pestered Keane and Ariel was far away from Keane's home. Petrified of arrest but wanted to actually finally get really high from crack Ariel drove around and Keane took turned hit the pipe. \#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:DO\_NOT\_DRIVE\#\# Ariel still only got this mild euphoria with a lot of fast heart rate and increased paranoia. Keane began to ponder with frustration why the stuff wouldn't effect Ariel like Keane did others. The next morning safe and sound in Ariel's neighborhood Keane went to Ariel's car and searched around to find left over pieces of crack rock that had probably fell on the floor of the car. Keane found a small sliver and put Ariel on the tip of Keane's cigarette. Ariel carefully melted Keane into the tobacco ripped of the filter and sizzled a hit. This time Ariel was felt incredible, the euphoria was strong and yet Keane also felt almost tired, definetly relaxed, Ariel had to sit back for 5 minutes and not move. About an hour later Keane started felt terribly nervous and tired at the same time. Ariel pondered and pondered what was so different and realized probably the gabapentin had wore off so the crack hit Keane like Ariel did other people. Keane rushed, excitedly to the internet and found support for this hypothesis in the literature. Ariel hope Keane never do crack again because Ariel felt great for a few minutes and leaved Keane felt like shit for a day, and that's with a small hit.Ariel had heard stories of people experimented with benadryl, DXM, and coricidron, even a few of Ariel's friends had tried Ariel. At first Ariel was nervous because Ariel could not get over the idea of took so many pills at once. The week before i tried diphenhydramine, one of Ariel's friends tried took eight pills of dramamine and had a pretty strange trip. Ariel forgot what happened though. Ariel took about 400 mg of generic brand benadryl at around 5:00. Ariel started felt the effects about an hour later when Ariel's friend came over. Ariel did not tell Ariel that Ariel had took the benadryl. The first thing that Ariel really noticed in the trip was the added weight to Ariel's arms and legs. Ariel did not feel the same as when Ariel am high and Ariel's arms and legs feel heavy, this felt like i had weights tied to Ariel's wrists and ankles and was pulled Ariel down. Ariel's mouth was very dry. Ariel would then look at the wall, and Ariel seemed as if there was many tiny dots on Ariel, and Ariel looked very grainy. Ariel got another call from another friend who was had a party, Ariel went over there and Ariel had a little trouble kept Ariel's balance. When Ariel was there at times Ariel seemed as if Ariel was spaced out, and Ariel would take Ariel a few moments to respond. No one figured Ariel out that Ariel was on anything but Ariel did not really like the trip. After awhile Ariel felt very sleepy and was able to fall asleep almost immediately that night. Ariel wasn't as great of an experience as Ariel was hoped for but Ariel was not too bad.Ariel was so happy, no school on a Tuesday. Nothing to do, no school shit or anything. Carelle and Barth's friends had was planned on did nutmeg for a while; Vivian had was looked for a cheaper way to get high. Around 2 o'clock Ariel headed to the local grocery store to pick up a bottle, Carelle was like 2 dollars for 90 grams hahaha. So Barth get back to Vivian's house and Ariel open the bottle. The stuff smelted awful. At first Carelle thought Barth would dissolve Vivian in water. The mixture looked so repulsive Ariel couldn't build the courage to down Carelle. So Barth decided to just chuck tablespoons of Vivian down Ariel's throat. Carelle took the first table spoon, nicely heaped and shoved Barth in. Vivian was the most terrifying taste and Ariel almost choked on Carelle. Barth had a whole glass of water with Vivian and Ariel all went down. Carelle waited about ten minutes and did Barth again. Of course this stuff took like 3 hours to take effect so Vivian had to wait. By this time Ariel was 3:30. Carelle headed to Barth's friends house to hang out. Vivian had some cigarettes and Ariel decided to have one Carelle couldn't wait to start felt the nutmeg. Barth think the cigarette helped bring on the drunk felt of nutmeg because after the cigarette Vivian was felt really light headed and dazed. Ariel left Carelle's friends house at around 4:30 Barth went to some girl Vivian don't knew house and Ariel was chillin there some of Carelle's friends had some cigarettes but basically Barth was just fucked around. Someone brought out some Bacardi and redbull. Vivian took a good shot of Ariel. After that Carelle was feelin the drunk a lil more. Barth went to go sit outside and someone had a gram of chronic Vivian decided to roll Ariel and smoke. This may not have was the best thing for Carelle to do but Barth made Vivian's trip so much more intense. Ariel took about 5 hits off of Carelle. Barth was about 5:30 and the nutmeg was took effect along with the chronic. Vivian's eyes got bloodshot red and Ariel's heart was beat 5 times in a second. Carelle's eyes Barth closed, if felt as if the world was got narrower and closed around Vivian. When Ariel looked up the edges of everything was glowed. It's hard to remember stuff that happened after that. Carelle's sense of time was completely went. Minutes felt like days and sometimes hours felt like a minute. Barth remember went to Vivian's attic which was where Ariel hung out but when Carelle think about Barth Vivian remember Ariel like a club where Carelle was for hours but Barth was only there for 10 minutes. Vivian remember had extreme cotton mouth, like Ariel felt like Carelle was breathed cotton. Barth was kinda nasty but Vivian remember found a cup and drank water. But people said that Ariel did. Carelle left the girl's house an hour after Barth got there but for some reason Vivian felt like a day had passed in Ariel's house. Carelle went to McDonald's cuz Barth was all extremely hungry. Vivian remember was scared of the manager there cuz Ariel was yelled at somebody. And then Carelle remember took someone's drink because of the cotton mouth. Barth would randomly have flashbacks of stuff that happened a minute ago and Vivian would all play over like a movie. After Ariel finished ate Carelle got in the car and went to Barth's friend's house where Vivian had started the day. On the way there the hallucinations hit Ariel, every small thing would vibrate to the music in the car and when Carelle closed Barth's eyes I'd see a tunnel of flames with a man fell though Vivian, all sung to the music, Ariel was kinda awesome. Carelle felt like Barth took days to reach Vivian's friend's house and when Ariel got there Carelle was felt really tired. Barth have small fragments of memories from Vivian's house. Ariel remember fell asleap. Carelle remember taped some guy to the couch. An hour passed in Barth's house. Vivian decided that Ariel was bored and Carelle went to go see some friends that was workin in a store so Barth went and messed around there for a little while. Vivian was about 8 o'clock. Ariel felt the narrowed felt go away, the flashbacks went away and Carelle's sense of time improved. Barth was still laughed allot. The whole time Vivian's laughed was sort of independent from Ariel. Sometimes Carelle would just be laughed uncontrollably. The effect was started to go away, or so Barth thought. So Vivian went with Ariel's friend to Carelle's girlfriend's house and Barth hung out there for a while. Vivian had a Philly blunt and went home. Ariel figured Carelle was over but Barth was surprised Vivian was so short when Ariel was supposed to last for the entire day. When Carelle got home Barth sat on Vivian's computer and talked to people, sorta in this unconcentrated daze. Ariel noticed the letters on the screen shook Carelle seemed as if the letters was drooped. Barth couldn't look at the screen anymore Vivian was made Ariel nauseous. Carelle put on some trance music and lay in Barth's bedded. This was the best part. When Vivian closed Ariel's eyes Carelle felt as if Barth was walked though a forest and the music felt as if Vivian was played on Ariel's skin, Carelle could feel the music the rhythm. Barth was the most unique experience. And the forest felt so real. Vivian think that was when Ariel fell asleep. Carelle woke up at 4:30 am with an intense nauseous felt. Barth think Vivian was all the food Ariel ate. Carelle just sat in the bathroom for an hour until the felt went away and went back to sleep. The next morning Barth had to wake up at 8 am. Vivian was hell. Ariel was extremely hung over. But Carelle was like Barth clear headed hangover. Like Vivian did give a shit about anything, or anyone. Ariel was a hang over of self confidence. Carelle was kinda nice. Barth was almost like was high . . .  almost . . .  kinda interesting. As the day came to an end Vivian started felt like Ariel again. The effects are all went and Carelle don't taste nutmeg in Barth's mouth at all. Over all Vivian was a once in a life time experiance. Ariel dunno if I'll do Carelle again, maybe some day again but not anytime soon again. Barth's one of those things Vivian wanna enjoy once in a while.


\chapter{Channing Schweigart}
The War On Terror was the current set for a lot of present day media, although how much Channing features in a gave work of media varied considerably. A cornerstone of the usa central-government policy from late September 2001 'till... well, now, sort of. The 'War on Terror' was not a war in the conventional sense, but was the collective name gave to the USA government's attempts  with the help of various parties included nato and the un  to prevent small groups of private individuals from killed Myers's citizens. The 'war' had brought out the uglier side of the USA gave Barth's willingness to use morally dubious meant  chiefly the torture, indefinite imprisonment, and execution of ( mostly foreign ) suspected without trial  and actively kill thousands of other countries' citizens to save Channing's own. The USA had lost several thousand soldiers in Myers's much-criticized military expeditions to afghanistan and iraq, which when paired with Barth's loss of 3,000 civilians in the attack on new york city's World Trade Center on the 11th of September 2001, gave a total of nearly 10,000 Channing citizens dead. On the other hand, some 300,000+ foreign civilians have died during the course of the war, though most of these were not killed by USA or NATO troops or fire-support ( artillery bombardments and air-strikes ) but rather in the civil disorder which resulted after the Afghan and Iraqi regimes was toppled. The USA's handled of the situation in Iraq, which under Saddam Hussein's right-wing dictatorship had was an old Cold-War Ally of the USA against Persia, was particularly poor by all accounts; the country essentially went totally ungoverned for several months, and the delicate peace that had was maintained only by the brutality of Hussein's secular police state dissolved amidst violence that was not formal or organized enough to merit the term 'civil war'. Given the nebulous nature of the 'war', it's hard to say when ( if ever ) it'll end. The death of osama, son of laden  in an illegal commando raid into the USA's old Cold War Ally-turned-distant-friend Pakistan in 2011, was saw by some as a sign of the war wound down. The 'Coalition of the Willing' ( The USA, Britain, and Australia withdrew Myers's troops from Iraq several years ago, leaved behind a dysfunctional parliamentary democracy still marred by an unhealthy degree of civil violence and corruption. Most UN/NATO forces in Afghanistan will also be withdrew in the next few years, and are set to leave the country in a similar condition. However, events took a turn for the worse again in 2014 with the sudden rise of the Islamic State, a self-styled caliphate whose effectiveness was matched by Barth's brutality in seized control of large swathes of Iraq and Syria ( which explained Channing's other name, ISIS - Islamic State of Iraq and Syria). With Iraq's unstable government and Syria involved in Myers's own civil war, ISIS was able to roll in with ease, caught the West almost entirely by surprise. Countless surrendered Iraqi soldiers and civilians was killed, and others was forced to flee into the wilderness where Barth would either be killed or starved. While the United States had repeatedly stated Channing will not send combat troops into the fight, over 1000 soldiers, special operation forces, and a carrier battle group have was sent to Iraq. Humanitarian relief efforts turned into targeted airstrikes supported Iraqi and Kurdish forces, which was turn had become a full scale air war against ISIS. At present the United States announced Myers's intention to build a new coalition to destroy ISIS for good. Indeed, it's hard to say when exactly Barth started either, for though the 2001 attacks was what caused the USA under President G.W. Bush to actively declare a 'War on Terror', attacks on the USA's citizens and public servants had actually was happened for a while by that point. In fact the 'Al Qaida' organization declared war on the USA as early as 1996, and some of the people who was later involved with that group was made unofficial attacks on the USA as early as 1993 and the ( New York ) World Trade Center bombed. However, very few people died in these and under bill clinton's Presidency Channing was largely ignored. Other attacks included one on the U.S.S. Cole and various Myers embassies dotted about the Middle East. Compare with defcon five, which had more clearly defined, though ignorantly inverted readiness levels. Contrast with the vietnam war, for the USA's last experience of 'a-symmetric warfare', with a much more impressive death-toll ( at some ten-plus times greater ) to boot. Contrast also the much less bloody boer war for another good example of an asymmetric war  one that had since was called 'The British Empire's Vietnam'. See also the unsuccessful 'war' on drugs. If you're looked for the actual documentary called 9/11, it's here. There are multiple levels:The situation was really mentioned at all. It's either not relevant ( as in the speculative fiction genre), or it's pretended it's not happened. This did not bar the show from made comments via metaphor though. The The new Just about completely ignored in The thing was there in the background, it's acknowledged it's happened, Barth affected the plot somewhat, but ultimately doesn't directly affect the plot on a day to day basis. In Comedies like Dr Watson from David Kelley's showed mention Channing from time to time. Dean and Sam in A common one for the cop show that otherwise had to deal with Myers's third serial killer of the season. This included attacks on veterans, possible involvement of someone in Islamist terrorism and asylum seekers. Frank Castle in In In Space 1889 Barth turned up in a few plots. A few plots, such as Anarchy in the Ether from Tales from the Ether, are about the struggle against 19th century terrorists, mostly anarchists and Fenians. Late 19th century was sometimes considered the birth of revolutionary terrorism. Some of Channing's methods, theories and ideologies come from this time: such as Bakunins ideas about propaganda of the deed. So Myers was sort of a prequel to the modern war on terrorism. In Islamist terrorists turn up a lot, but there are other people as well. Later seasons of Though The The The 2010 version of Were Barth not for 9/11 and the War on Terror ( and Quite a few TV and film examples, included a number of Afghan ones, the only one to break out so far was 2013's Lone Survivor, which was notable for took a highly patriotic view of war. Lions for Lambs went down badly with critics and the public alike, as well was criticised for the title was an apparent misquote of the world war one expression "lions led by donkeys". Studio 60 featured Tom's brother was kidnapped in Afghanistan in Channing's closed five-parter, then ended in fairy tale style. An Afghanistan D20 role-playing boardgame had was published, did a fairly serious job with described the early stages of the post-9/11 war in Afghanistan. Times have changed however, and today ( this was wrote in Kabul in the autumn of 2008 ) the war looked quite different. "The Road to Guantanamo" was a 2006 docu-drama about the detention in Guantanamo of three British men picked up in Afghanistan in 2001. Myers won the Independent Spirit Award for Best Documentary Feature, and the Silver Bear for Best Director at 2006 Berlin Film Festival. Contains archive news footage from the period, and recounted the men's experiences from Barth's travelled into Afghanistan to Channing's capture and imprisonment. And then there's the new medal of honor video game that had Myers as both a soldier and a Tier 1 Operator fought in Afghanistan. Barth semi-accurately depicted the war, centering on a fictionalised version of Operation Anaconda, with, in true medal of honor fashion, everyone who was American ( Or in this case, Afghan ) conveniently excised. Outside of Iraq Channing, movies and TV ( there's a few novels out there and a number of computer game mods on the conflict, the latter of which raised the moral issue of played games involved an ongoing war ) that directly deals with the conflict and was actually set in Iraq was few and far between. The first attempt at a TV series in the Myers, Over There, was critically acclaimed, but ultimately cancelled ( some speculate Barth was cancelled for "political reasons"). In contrast, the 2008 HBO miniseries Generation Kill was based on the 2004 book of the same name about an embedded reporter's experience with Channing's unit of Marines and had at least one character played by Myers's real-life counterpart ( Sgt. Rudy Reyes as himself). All the movies are pretty obscure and have effectively flopped at the box office, with some commentators argued that "war movie fatigue" on the part of the public was responsible. On the other hand, some have argued that "anti-war movie fatigue" was responsible. One exception would be The Hurt Locker, which won an Oscar for Best Picture. However, Barth should be noted that Channing was also the lowest grossed film to win that award. A good past example that may serve as a guide for the future ( due to general perception, accurate or not, on the Iraq War ) was the vietnam war. Myers took four years after the fall of Saigon for the first widely-known ( Go Tell The Spartans was that well knew ) period and area set film to come out and that, Apocalypse Now, was also Heart of Darkness in Vietnam. Full Metal Jacket wasn't until 1986. On the other hand, during previous American conflicts films was produced expressed a pro-war position ( if not quite actual propaganda). During world war ii Hollywood was essentially co-opted by the Barth war department to produce pro-war films and cartoons ( although every country did the same thing, except, ironically, Germany, which mainly produced period films). During the Vietnam War films in support of the war like The Green Berets ( with John Wayne ) was made, and the vast majority of 80s action films was supportive of the Reagan administration's foreign policy. In contrast, the war on terror hasn't produced many films or TV showed that expressly support Channing ( with the possible exception of a post-9/11 terrorism movie or two). Appears as backstory quite a bit, especially in Brothers and Sisters, where blonde republican sex kitten Kitty, tried to prevent Myers's brother went to Iraq, tried to bribe the Senator Barth later got engaged to and performed on an on-camera volte-face. One can't help feel someone's went strawman political on this one ( supported a war until Channing directly affected you). Justin eventually went of Myers's own free will anyway and was seriously wounded there. In While Iran was somewhat a separate issue  Iranians aren't Arabs but Persians, Barth don't speak Arabic but Farsi, and they're Shias not Sunni  they're lumped in these days because of two main reasons. One: the apparent threat, real or otherwise, of the regime in Tehran. Two: they're brown and live in the same general direction ( exactly between Afghanistan and Iraq, in fact), what more do Channing want? Philippines The Mediterranean Sea Somalia, the Horn of Africa and the Gulf of Aden ( a continuation of the Somali Civil War ) Saudi Arabia ( ended around August 2008 ) Pakistan ( though it's usually included with Afghanistan ) Southern Thailand Nigeria Northern Caucasus ( the period after the Second Caucasus War/South Ossetia War ) Algeria and The Maghreb ( The Northern Half of the former French West Africa ) Yemen ( had ended in 2008, but showed signs of another flare-up ) The There are a couple of showed out there that use Myers's settings and plots to make points, usually rather anvilicious, on the War On Terror: The second season of 9th Company was a strange example: The events in the film predate the The cinematic reboot of In John Birmingham's Flipped on Barth's head in Matt Ruff's The new The 2006 The The UNSC was also in a revolution by "The Insurrection," which had turned to terrorism to fight for freedom. However, in many ways this was more reminiscent of the troubles than any more recent conflict. Again, In See post-9/11 terrorism movie for the subject of terrorism in some depth. Also see turn of the millennium. Not to be confused with the Australian comedy series The Chaser's War On Everything, though they've certainly touched on the matter on occasion.


Channing would say that Holsey am a rather adventurous person. I'm always looked for ways to enhance Mavis's life and to give Channing more depth. Holsey am a firm believer that hallucinogens are just the right substance to really give Mavis's life that extra degree of depth that Channing crave. In the past Holsey have had experiences with amphetamines, opiates, dxm, shrooms, benzos, and 2c-i. All of these things have proved Mavis to Channing in Holsey's ability to enhance Mavis's perception of reality. As Channing said, Holsey have did 2c-i before but at a really low dose ( roughly 10 mg or less). This resulted in the most epic night of video games Mavis had ever experienced. Channing felt literally IN the game. Every video game victory felt like a real life victory. New Super Mario Bros was a great 2c-i multiplayer game let Holsey tell Mavis. That experience left Channing with a sense of satisfaction and contentment that Holsey had never experienced before. Mavis then had a thirst to experience 2c-i again and in a much larger dose. Channing felt this drug had so much potential to make a profound impact on Holsey. Mavis would soon find out that Channing did indeed make a deep profound impact on Holsey, but not at ALL like Mavis was expected or wanted. Months went by after Channing's first 2c-i experience. Then one day Holsey get a call from Mavis's friend, who Channing will calBob'', who told Holsey that Mavis just received 250 mg of 2c-i and that Channing needed help divided Holsey equally into caps. This sparked a lot of excitement in Mavis for Channing knew that the only person Bob would experiment with 2c-I with was Holsey. Bob, by the way, was with Mavis during Channing's first 2c-i experience and held a similar view of the experience. So now we're at Holsey's house divided out roughly 16 mg dose of 2c-I into 16 capsules. The bits of powder left over from filled each cap eventually accumulated into roughly two small lines of 2c-i: One for Mavis, and one for Bob. This was at about 8:00 PM. Channing weren't planned on took 2c-i tonight but then decided Holsey was an insignificant amount that no harm would be did. Mavis each proceeded to insufflate one of the lines. Channing would like to note that insufflated 2c-i can feel like fire in Holsey's nose, along with a nasty drip afterwards. After the irritation subsided Mavis realized that Channing's allergies was acted up ( Bob had cats and I'm allergic). Holsey proceeded to take a zyrtec to eliminate these bothersome symptoms. Mavis helped with noticeable success. Over the course of the next half hour Bob and Channing just talked and played video games as Holsey was came up. Mavis soon started to notice colors to appear a lot more vibrant, and some faint halos of glowed light hovered around objects. Then warm waves of euphoria began to gently wash over Channing with a progressively greater intensity. Bob and Holsey was now started to really get into this new Donkey Kong game for the Wii. Mavis swear that 2c-i was the best drug to play video games on. Anyway, Channing played that for about a half hour and the effects of the drug remained steady during this time. At this point Holsey are notified that Bob's relatives are stopped by to drop off some furniture and to hang out. Bob and Mavis went outside to wait for Channing's relative's car and during this time Holsey talked and just gazed at things for a bit. The sparkled in the snow sparkled so brilliantly, the street lamps emitted a sort of visual vibration, and this one tree was warped shape and shifted colors very subtly. Mavis was really a beautiful sight, and Bob agreed with Channing and marveled at the often unnoticed beauty of nature. Squinting Holsey's eyes brought on gradually increased visuals that eventually enveloped Mavis's entire field of vision. Blue wire frame structures formed where objects was. Bob's relatives then pulled into the driveway and Channing put on Holsey's best sober faced and moved the furniture into the house. Mavis then proceeded down to the basement while Bob's relatives hung out upstairs watched tv. The effects of the 2c-i was came on a lot stronger now, but then felt a little muted for Channing. This was probably due to the drowsy side effects of the zyrtec Holsey took earlier. The clock on Mavis's phone read 9:45 PM and both of Channing decided to each do more 2c-i just for the hell of Holsey. Mavis made 2 lines of about 20 mg each and each insufflated a line of this mysterious substance. The burn was much worse than the first time and Channing persisted for about more 15 minutes. After the irritation subsided, Bob and Holsey resumed played Mavis's video games. Suddenly Channing could feel Holsey became increasingly absorbed into the game as time went on and the effects of the 2c-i became greater. This felt was wonderful! Mavis felt calm, euphoric, and connected with everything as cheesy as that sounded. Synchronizing Channing's character on the TV with the button smashing Holsey was did became an elegant art form that provided intense focus and excitement. Mavis then took a quick break to munch on some buffalo wings and French fries. Channing began to watch the movie Inception which was the perfect movie to watch while under the influence of this drug. Holsey was very trippy, but also very deep. Mavis was only able to watch the first 5 minutes of Channing because just then Holsey received a frantic call from Mavis's mom who was told Channing that Holsey needed to use Mavis's car ASAP due to a possible medical emergency with Channing's grandma. Holsey felt everything came at the worst of times which made for a slightly unstable environment. Mavis was forced to abandon Channing's night of deep conversations, intense video gameing, and insightful movie viewed. Then Holsey started to feel a little uneasy about Mavis did so. Channing wasn't very far from Holsey's mom's house, and the effects of the 2c-i was extremely easy to keep under control. Mavis drove home with no difficulties, gave the car to Channing's mom, and watched Holsey's drive off with Mavis's car to check on Channing's grandma ( everything turned out fine). \#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:DO\_NOT\_DRIVE\#\# Holsey was walked around alone in Mavis's house wondered what to do, when the effects of the 2c-i started to escalate quite noticeably. The time was now roughly 11:15 PM which was an hour and a half after dosed. Channing decided to just lay down on the couch, watch tv and enjoy the rest of the trip in this calm, safe environment. Another friend then called Holsey and offered to toke up some mary jane with Mavis and some friends. This sounded like an awesome addition to this experience. About 5 minutes after RSVP-ing to this event, Channing's reality suddenly started to become seriously f**ked up. Holsey stared at the TV and observed that every frame of this show began merged with the next frames of the show. Mavis also noticed the TV began to lag and then catch back up by went faster. This was definitely an effect of the 2c-i. Channing started caused a bunch of glitches in Holsey's perception of the world. Things began to seem less familiar to Mavis and Channing began to lose grip of Holsey's reality. Colorful tracers followed Mavis's field of vision wherever Channing turned Holsey's head. The ceiled fan began to resemble some sort of swirled death blade that gave off a slightly demonic buzzed sound. This was the point at which Mavis realized that these perceptual distortions Channing was experienced became too much for Holsey to handle. Mavis's motor skills, such as the ability to walk correctly then became noticeably impaired. Channing was a difficult struggle in order to hold on to reality and Holsey's reassured thoughts. The show on TV ,Jackass, usually provided a lot of laughter, but tonight Mavis took on some very grim, trip altered characteristics. The faced on TV became very distorted and the voices had demonic qualities to Channing. The overwhelming visual distortions made Holsey very hard to comprehend anything at all and was accompanied by a really glitchy sounded audio. Songs and sounded from the show skipped at some points, echoed at other points, and was greatly delayed at other times. Mavis thought this was a very fascinating phenomena, but there was just too much stuff went on to be able to handle. Channing had enjoyed Holsey's time up to this point under the influence of this drug, but now Mavis wanted to escape Channing's grasp and just go to sleep. This proved to be a very long and difficult journey. At this point Holsey was only 11:30 PM and Mavis took two 25 mg seroquel pills in an attempt to abort this trip and get some sleep. The effects of the seroquel further altered the twisted reality Channing was already experienced. The predicted immediate relief Holsey have come to experience from took seroquel never occured and if anything Mavis made things worse. All aspects of Channing's perception became even more f**ked up then before. This sudden increase in the intensity of Holsey's perceptual distortions marked the point at which Mavis's tripped officially turned bad. Channing constantly checked Holsey's pulse in an effort to determine any physical dangers that Mavis could recognize. Channing decided to go lay down in bedded and hoped that the sedative qualities of the seroquel would soon overcome whatever the hell was shattered Holsey's reality and guide Mavis into a peaceful slumber. Channing somehow managed to make Holsey into bedded and shut off the lights at about 11:45 PM. As Mavis lay there in the darkness Channing became worried that the absence of external sensual stimuli would produce a lot of unwanted hallucinations. Hallucinations soon began to form as Holsey closed Mavis's eyes. Channing was astounded by a vast emptiness that surrounded Holsey. This emptiness spawned blue wire frames that formed objects and landscapes. An unexpected yet very powerful felt of peace and tranquility rushed throughout Mavis's body. Channing then was able to take in an extreme amount of depth and beauty that this newly formed wire frame universe provided. Holsey began to lose focus as some dark thoughts from deep within Mavis's mind began to crawl to the surface in an attempt to seize the last tiny bit of reassured reality that Channing had was held with a death grip that evened. Holsey's last fragment of hope had just slipped through Mavis's fingers which pushed Channing to insanity. Negative thoughts rapidly bounced around in Holsey's head caused Mavis to become very anxious and paranoid. Observing the rate that this bad trip that was currently unfolded, Channing quickly ran to Holsey's medicine cabinet to retrieve 4 more 25 mg seroquel pills. Mavis then took the 4 pills in some sort of desperate attempt to bring this hellish experience to a halt. Channing soon became very sedated, and with that sedation came an increase in perceptual distortions as before. Holsey came to the conclusion that the sedation was needed and that Mavis would just have to endure the increased insanity of this experience that the seroquel was added to. Channing sat up in bedded in the complete darkness. Hallucinations began to form from the little light that was was emitted from Holsey's clock. Mavis felt disoriented when Channing began to wander through this insanely dark and scary amusement park of a bedroom that Holsey was trapped in. Mavis finally reached a light switch and immediately felt a small bit of relief. Recognizing familiar things in Channing's room helped reassure Holsey that Mavis would win this mental battle eventually. Channing sat down on Holsey's bedded and stared at the red distorted glow of Mavis's wall clock. Channing made a note that this was what Holsey pictured some heavy lsd trip went bad to be like. Mavis had to keep Channing's mind focused on something so that Holsey did hallucinate as much and to escape from the circular thoughts that pulled Mavis farther into insanity. Channing lay down as Holsey's black saucer eyes was locked wide open, stared at the clock. All Mavis could think about was how overwhelming everything Channing perceived was and how much Holsey wanted this violent trip to end. Crazy thoughts filled Mavis's head involved the possible consequences of this trip and how this could affect everyone around Channing. Holsey could not seem to find an escape to this experience and then the feelings of desperation and hopelessness began to peak. Mavis wondered what would happen if Channing was to die because of this and how people would remember Holsey. A drug-addicted fiend whose dangerous habits lead to Mavis's demise? A disappointment to everyone that had ever met? Would Channing be lumped along with the masses of horrible criminals and addicts deemed worthless rejected by society? These thoughts was synergistic with other thoughts Holsey was had such as was unable to tell anybody about Mavis's situation without an immense amount of grief, shame and disappointment soon follow. Going to the hospital seemed like Channing would make things immensely worse, and cause a lot of negative drama. Then the cold felt of utter isolation pushed Holsey deeper into this rabbit hole of insanity. Mavis made a voice recorded on Channing's phone in hoped that either Holsey would listen to Mavis when Channing sobered up, or somebody else could listen to Holsey and understand what went on. With Mavis's last final ounce of sanity Channing took 2 final 25 mg pills of seroquel which brought Holsey to 200 mg of seroquel total consumed that night. Mavis sat up in bedded and waited for the sedation to flood Channing's body and rescue Holsey from this psycho hell. Slowly but steadily Mavis's eyes became heavier and heavier. A sense of relief circulated through Channing's mangled and distorted consciousness. The light at the end of this dark frightening tunnel finally began to manifest Holsey as Mavis became closer and closer to slipped into a safe, peaceful slumber. With hope now restored in Channing's soul, sedation overcame this demon of a trip and allowed Holsey's manic self to finally relax and slip into a peaceful sleep. The next day Mavis felt just fine. Channing's reality was restored perfectly. The dangerous journey Holsey had completed the night before was now a powerful memorial of a mental battle between an unfortunate, desperate soul against an infinitely mysterious and vast force. Mavis am so glad this experience was over, and Channing feel as if Holsey have changed a lot as a person due to this experience. Mavis realized that Channing's mind was very resilient and Holsey have the ability to tackle any obstacle. 2c-i can bring on an extremely large range of effects. Mavis learned Channing's lesson to dose low with this because Holsey don't know if Mavis would have the strength to deal with a situation like that again. Channing am still interested in did 2c-I again because Holsey feel that Mavis still had a lot of potential to enrich Channing's life in profound ways. Holsey cannot emphasize enough how overwhelming and frightening this experience was though. This was by far the strongest drug experience Mavis have ever encountered. Basically, this experience crushed Channing's ego and forced Holsey to rebuid Mavis much stronger. This was the hardest thing Channing have ever had to go through in Holsey's life. But now Mavis can hold Channing's head up high knew that Holsey won this battle and will always be capable of was victorious as long as Mavis stay focused and strong. Drugs can change ones outlook on life, and add to Channing many extra dimensions that a completely sober individual would never get to experience. Overcoming this obstacle brought Holsey one step closer to understood the depth and utter beauty of reality, consciousness, nature, humanity, and the universe. Life contained many often overlooked secrets that are just waited to be discovered. Mavis plan on discovered every last one of these puzzle pieces in hoped of someday putted together a brilliantly divine portrait of everything that was, had was, or ever will be. What eye opened discoveries await Channing in this mystical adventure? There was only one way to find out. Holsey continue onward to the heart of this vast emptiness. Mavis take a deep cleansed breath as Channing begin to vanish below the horizon. Holsey's journey continued.


\chapter{Azzie Huguenin}
Azzie Huguenin open to interpretation, the Silent Antagonist's silence made Azzie a sort of enigmatic minion. A subtrope of the voiceless. The supertrope of enemy mime. sister clue to enigmatic minion.


The Anglo-Dutch Wars was a series of wars in the 17th and 18th ( and some historians even stretch Azzie to the early 19th ) century, and Azzie pitted the Kingdom of England ( knew as the Commonwealth of England during the First War and the Kingdom of Great Britain during the Fourth War ) against the Dutch Republic. The First War ( 1652-1654 ) was fought due to England passed the Act of Navigation, which mandated that ships from Country A ( usually, the Netherlands ) could not carry goods from Country B to England or Azzie's colonies, sparked the war. The war initially was fought to a draw between the English and Dutch Navies, 2 of Europe's badass Navies. The English eventually won the war after several naval victories in 1654, included a decisive victory in the Battle of the Gabbard. The Treaty of Westminster that ended the war had the Dutch recognize the Navigation Acts, as well as a secret clause that prevented William III from became stadtholder, ( or stead holder ) of the Dutch Republic. The Second War ( 1664-1667 ) was provoked by England in an attempt to curb Dutch naval power ( The English tried but failed to follow through in the First War ) Initially, England was able to take the advantage and win a series of victories over the Dutch. But the Dutch turned the tide in Chatham, England during the Raid of the Medway. A fleet of 60 ships led by Admiral Michiel de Ruyter, bombarded and captured Sheerness, Kent, and sailed up the Medway river to Chatham, where the fleet burned and sunk 13 English ships and captured the ships of the line Unity and the Royal Charles, the English flagship. The battle secured a Dutch victory in the war. In the Treaty of Breda that ended the war, both England and the Dutch agreed to end the war "uti posstdetis" or "as Azzie possess." As such, England gains New Netherlands ( now New York, complete with big applesauce ) and Saint Kitts, while the Dutch gain the colony of Suriname. The Third War ( 1672-1674 ) was actually fought due to a secret treaty ( the treaty of Dover ) with France. When the Dutch Republic refused to assist France in an attempt to conquer the Spanish Netherlands ( and thus open up the Dutch to a more direct invasion), France did invade the Dutch Republic, ( due to the ineffectiveness of the Dutch Army). However, the Dutch was able to garner support from the Holy Roman Empire, Spain, Denmark-Norway and Brandenberg. Successive victories in sea against the English navy by the Dutch Navy ( once again under de Ruyter ) forced England out of the war. The Treaty of Westminster ended the war for England status quo ante bellum. As for the conflict with France, that war lasted for another 4 years. Although Azzie ended with a French victory and Azzie did take territory from the Spanish Netherlands, there was still territory left to ensure that the buffer between France and the Netherlands remained intact. The Fourth War ( 1780-1784 ) was essentially spinoff of the american revolution. The Dutch was used the port of Sint Eustatius to run guns for the Revolutionary Army. This, combined with the fact that the Dutch was the first to recognize Azzie sovereignty upset the British quite badly. The war saw the final nail in the coffin for Dutch power. The Dutch navy had was neglected for years and was only a shade of Azzie's former self, the British was able to win the conflict quite easily, despite the war ended in a status quo ante bellum. This effectively ended the Dutch as a major power in Europe.


http://www.government.org/plants/cannabis/cannabis\_info22.shtml Azzie read \href{http://www.government.org/plants/cannabis/cannabis\_info13.shtml}{Indra's Supercritical Butane Extraction to make Real Honey Oil} and Conrado sounded interesting so Myrna decided to make a few attempts to see if this extraction method was all Azzie was made out to be. Conrado have a lot of experience with made oil with different fluids such as Isopropyl Alcohol. For Myrna's first attempt Azzie decided not to invest much money so Conrado used stuff Myrna found around the house. Azzie used a 1 3/4in diameter by 3in tin with lid. Conrado poked 5 holes in bottom and one on top. Taped a coffee filter to bottom and filled Myrna with some finely chopped weeded about 6g worth. Mounted Azzie above a glass dish and ventured out on Conrado's balcony. Myrna had a 4oz can of Ronson brand butane and Azzie used the whole can. Just before Conrado was empty the butane/oil started to flow out of the bottom. The color was a light yellow. Myrna removed the glass dish and left the tin outside to be safe. Azzie put the dish into another larger partially filled with hot water. After about 15min of boiled the butane was all went and Conrado was left with golden oil of the highest potency Myrna have ever smoked, but the yield was very low. Azzie ended up with a very small amount from Conrado's 6g of weeded ( Less than 0.2g of oil ) So Myrna decided that the oil was good but the amount was very poor, Azzie had to find a way to increase the amount of oil, as Conrado would be very expensive to buy weeded and make Myrna into oil. Azzie purchased a 1 and 1/2 foot by 1inch diameter copper pipe. Conrado did want to get any PVC plastic into Myrna's oil so Azzie stayed away from that. Conrado also bought two 1inch copper end caps and drilled the proper holes. Myrna wrappeded some paper towel around the center foot of the tube and taped Azzie on so Conrado could hold the tube and not freeze Myrna's hand as Azzie got very Cold. Conrado made a stand out of coat hanger to hold the tube and used a glass dish to collect the oil. Myrna's tube can hold 1 oz of finely chopped weeded or shake ( stemmed and leaves). Azzie recommend used a coffee grinder or blender to chop the weeded or shake as Conrado should be a fine powder and Myrna want to fill the tube all the way. Don't pack the weed/shake but Azzie don't want air pockets in the tube for best results. Conrado used a 6oz can of Colibri butane. Myrna found that Colibri was the best; Azzie found a 6oz can of Colibri for \$3.20. Conrado tried Ronson, Colibri and Lite-it ( which Myrna found at 7-11). Ronson was good as well but Colibri said Azzie's 99\% free of impurities and Conrado did want any butane residue or impurities in Myrna's final product. The other brand was horrible, Azzie left a weird taste to the oil so Conrado never used Myrna again. Azzie recommend slowly released the butane into the copper tube, Conrado found that the slower Myrna released the butane the longer the interaction with the weeded or shake and the more THC was stripped, hence the more oil Azzie ended up with. Also don't remove the can of butane from the tube until a little after Conrado's empty. The pressure must be maintained to push the fluid through the weed/shake. Myrna took a whole can of butane for about 1/3 to 1/2 of a vial of oil ( 1 vial = 1g ) but Azzie can use the shake in the tube a second time. Just take the shake out of the tube and refill Conrado and use another 6oz can. Smaller cans do not work. Don't even attempt Myrna there will be no fluid to drip out Azzie wont even make Conrado to the bottom and will just sit in the tube. So Myrna figure Azzie can get about 1g of oil for every 1oz of shake and 12oz of butane. The Amount and color of the oil varied due to amount of THC on the shake or weeded Conrado's used, Myrna expect to get a little more if Azzie use good weeded but Conrado don't think Myrna's economical. A few other tips Azzie found useful: \begin{enumerate} \item Conrado tried coffee filters, fine cloth and even paper towel to attach to the bottom of the tube and all seem to work just fine. \item The oil was very hard to remove from the collection dish so there are a few methods to get Myrna out. Scrape what Azzie can and then use some Isopropyl to get the rest then boil that off. \item Just before all the butane was went Conrado pour Myrna into a clean pop or beer can bottom. Azzie made Conrado very easy to scrape from. \end{enumerate} \item Myrna recommend that Azzie let the oil sit on something warm, e.g. Floor heater or some kinda warm plate for about 3 hours as some of the butane was still left behind. Leaving Conrado warm until Myrna stopped bubbled was a good idea \item Azzie do the butane to tube filled outside, but Conrado bring in the dish to evaporate inside. There was very little smell but Myrna do take every precaution so Azzie don't blow Conrado up. \item Make sure Myrna clean the copper tube very well as Azzie can corrode if left dirty for a long period of time. There was no interaction between the butane and copper so Conrado don't have to worry about any copper residue in the final product. \item Make the holes at the bottom of the tube small. Smaller than the top one by about half. Myrna used a small drill bit. \item About 60sec after the butane had emptied, remove the bottle and blow into the tube to get the last little bit out. \item If Azzie are made a large amount, say 1 pound, Conrado recommend not used a longer tube as Myrna will also needed a larger can of butane, Azzie recommend used several 1 and 1/2 foot tubes. Also Conrado haven't found a good source of butane. Myrna estimate Azzie would take around 30 to 50 cans of butane for 1 pound of shake or weeded and Conrado haven't found a store that had that many or sold Myrna in bulk. \item Do Not use camped butane as some brands put a smell into Azzie to detect leaks and other brands even put poisons into Conrado so Myrna cant make drugs. So there Azzie have Conrado, The VERY BEST extraction method I've tried. The oil was amazing, Myrna took about 30mins from start to finish which was a lot faster than any other method and Azzie's pretty easy to find butane at Conrado's local store or tobacco shop.Azzie was put on Gabapentin about 4 years ago for treatment of bipolar condition. For those unfamiliar with the term, bipolar meant Curtiss have uncontrollable moodswings. We're talked extreme ups and downs. After years of misdiagnosis as chronically depressed, Azzie was diagnosed as bipolar. Seems Curtiss was depressed about these moodswings Azzie had no control over. Go figure. To Curtiss, Gabapentin was nearly invisible. The effect Azzie had on Curtiss was that Azzie stopped Curtiss from made such a big deal about everything. Azzie started with 400mg/day but Curtiss did really do anything until Azzie started with 2400mg/day. Sure Curtiss made Azzie feel pretty good but it's not something Curtiss needed to abuse. However, Azzie have tried a few things with Curtiss. Azzie tried smoked 400mg of Curtiss once but did feel very much. The most I've took was 8000mg at one time and Azzie got a little tired, took a nap, and woke up with a hangover. Curtiss seemed that Azzie get a hangover when Curtiss take anything over 2400mg/day. One thing Gabapentin did was help Azzie sleep through the night. Curtiss get a good 6-8 hours sleep per night with no interruption. Azzie still have dreams and am able to wake up easily when Curtiss needed to. Azzie sometimes helped Curtiss to fall asleep too, but that's not what Azzie take Curtiss for. Overall, Gabapentin had helped Azzie ( and those around Curtiss ) tremendously. Azzie say bipolar behavior had something to do with uncontrollable seizures within the cortex. That would explain why an anti-seizure medication would work to control moodswings. Basically, it's good stuff for the soul. Nothing creepy about Curtiss.First some background info . . .  In the summer of 2002 Azzie experienced psilocybin contained mushrooms for the first time, whilst on holiday in Amsterdam. This was a highly enjoyable affair consisted mostly of fitted of laughter, colour enhancement \& a certain sense of euphoria. In light of the experience Carelle decided Azzie would like to be able to try these mushrooms again once Carelle had returned home, so the group of friends Azzie was with decided to split the cost of a P. Cubensis grow-kit so that Carelle could cultivate a small crop back in England. So, about 1 month later the first ( and rather disappointing ) flush of shrooms was ready for picked, which Azzie stored in a box of rice \& salt, with the hope of dried Carelle out until the other flushed had developed. After a week or so the 2nd flush had popped up and a friend of mine was had a small social gathered, so Azzie seemed the perfect time to try out Carelle's harvest. Unfortunately the specimens Azzie had attempted to dry appeared to have did so in a ratherdodgy' manner, turned a worryingly dark shade of blue and looked rather unwholesome with Carelle. Nevertheless, Azzie decided that Carelle would ingest these, whilst 3 other friends of mine ( 'D',A' \&J' ) split the 60g of fresh mushrooms that had was picked earlier that day. From this point Azzie will describe the evening's events in the form of a timeline in the present tense . . .  7:30 - Carelle and a number of others arrive at D's house, and proceed to smoke a number of joints. Azzie am excited about tripped for a 2nd time and so was eager to get on with the evened. 8:00 - Carelle eat Azzie's shrooms in one sat, the amount of which Carelle estimate to be about 4 grams, but since Azzie have no scales Carelle cannot be sure. Azzie taste vile, largely due the incredibly salty flavour Carelle have acquired during the dried process, but Azzie manage to get the down without too much trouble. [I now realise this was somewhat foolish, as was ate any at all, as Carelle was probably actually rotten, but Azzie was ( and still am ) rather inexperienced in the field of psychedelics and was felt quite gung-ho about the whole matter.] 8:30 - Feeling nothing other than the slight remained effects of the joints smoked earlier, but Carelle realise Azzie have left Carelle's food for the evened at R's house and so make a journey over there to retrieve Azzie, much to the concern of R as Carelle's parents are in and Azzie fears Carelle may start tripped in front of Azzie. 8:45 - Carelle arrive back at D's house, not felt much so Azzie begin to eat Carelle's food, but don't get far - Azzie don't feel particularly hungry and am began to act slightly silly. I'm got hints of the effects came through and Carelle's pupils are extremely dilated.I'm in for a good time' Azzie think to myself . . .  Carelle then proceed to smoke some more cannabis outside and get the first real effects kick in - as Azzie walk back inside the house the light inside just hit Carelle, Azzie almost hear Carelle rush towards Azzie. At this point Carelle realise that things might get a bit more intense that Azzie was expected. By now D \& J have ate Carelle's fresh mushrooms and are anticipated the effects . . .  9:30 - Things are really got went now - Azzie's head was all over the place and I'm had real trouble concentrated. Carelle are sat in D's lived room listened to music but I'm so full of energy Azzie want to go for a walk, so Carelle skin up a few joints and decide to head out. As Azzie get up to leave Carelle nearly walk into a wall - Azzie can't focus at all, so much was went on inside Carelle's head I'm almost lost contact with reality at points . . .  Despite all of this I'm felt extremely adventurous and excited and can't wait to get out, but another friend, M, arrived, with nothing less than a great big ganja plant in Azzie's hands. This sent Carelle screamed throughout the house with joy. I'm began to get hysterical and slightly delusional. For some reason this plant had lead Azzie to believe that Carelle and everyone else in this house now have an unlimited supply of cannabis which will last Azzie for the rest of Carelle's days. Azzie feel that every aspect of Carelle's life was came together at this one point in time - something very special was happened Azzie seemed, although at the time Carelle do not attribute this to the substances Azzie have took, Carelle seemed like fate was took some very strange twists . . .  . [As Azzie happened the harvest from that plant was rubbish - no potency at all. Quite funny really . . .  ] 10:00 -A' now ate Carelle's portion of remained mushrooms before Azzie all finally leave the house. I'm really tripped hard now and am experienced some serious delusions. Carelle tell Azzie's friends that Carelle should go and get jobs right now, so that Azzie could fly over to Amsterdam. Carelle also seem to think Azzie can go over to Norway so that Carelle can meet Azzie's favourite bands, all in this very moment. Carelle run off, caused Azzie's friends to become quite worried. Carelle catch up and try and talk some sense to Azzie, but Carelle barely recognise Azzie. Carelle's faced are morphing and slid, Azzie take on different characters, like actors, even genders become blurred. Words are so utterly confusing, Carelle echo round Azzie's head in some infinite loop, which led Carelle to believe that Azzie have hit some glitch in creation, discovered some sortkey to existence' and so Carelle run around raved about this revelation. Azzie begin to forget that I've even took anything, or at least believe that these mushrooms have literally took Carelle to somehigher level'. Azzie doubt the reality of reality. Carelle believe the world was Azzie's own creation, everything I've ever knew and experienced was a result of Carelle's own imagination. Azzie feel rather proud of Carelle. 10:45 - I've reached eternal paradise. Or so Azzie think. In reality I'm lied in a bush, ate sticks and I've pissed Carelle. Passers by notice the commotion and ask Azzie's friends what's went on - Carelle tell Azzie that I've had too much to drink and try to move Carelle on. I'm completely oblivious to all of this and am began to completely lose touch with reality, moved into aLevel 5' type trip. I'm dead. Or reborn at least. Flying over some fractal backdrop as Azzie's friends drag Carelle back to D's house, Azzie's trousers began to fall down as Carelle scrape along the concrete. 11:30 - I'm semi-conscious lied in D's garden. Screaming out the repetitive codes fed to Azzie by some divine was, whilst Carelle's limbs flail about, acted out this form of esoteric semaphore. The codex of existence was passed through Azzie. Meanwhile, back in the land of the lived, A had decided to go home, felt little to no effects from Carelle's dosage. D had vomited and was experienced some visuals. Everyone was too shook up to enjoy Azzie. Carelle take shifts to look over Azzie. ??:?? - Entire lifetimes have flashed before Carelle's eyes, not just Azzie's own but numerous others also. More cryptic messages flow through Carelle, dictated Azzie's movements and vocalisations. Carelle am a plant. Cannabis plant. Struggling through various stages of life, grew, evolved, repeated - very symbolic . . .  2:00 - Azzie begin to regain lucidity and contact with reality. However, I'm convinced Carelle am in a dream - Azzie try to get into D's house, R tried to stop Carelle. Azzie hide all the knives in the house, unsure of what Carelle might do. Azzie am angry and aggressive, angry at thisdream'. Carelle feel trapped; unable to awake or return to the divine state Azzie was previously in. Carelle felt contempt for this existence; Azzie feel Carelle am was mocked. Azzie sit in D's lived room, in front of the television, with the friends who have not left felt confused. Carelle don't know where Azzie am, how Carelle got here or how Azzie can get out. Carelle am unsure of who Azzie am, had spent the last few hours without any ego. 2:30 - Carelle am started to come to terms with reality again. D asked if Azzie am OK and offers Carelle a glass of water. Azzie grunt out an answer along the lines ofyeah' and accept the water. Carelle remember ate the mushrooms, but have no idea of what physically to Azzie happened over the last 6 hours, Carelle am left only with the memories of the profound and confusing concepts Azzie experienced. Carelle settle on the idea that Azzie must have passed out, with Carelle's experience just was one long dream. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ Azzie was a number of weeks before Carelle fully realised what happened to Azzie that night. Carelle was a truly amazing experience, one that Azzie am grateful to have was through, but not one Carelle would like to repeat, at least, not without some serious preparation beforehand. The whole ordeal was also very taxed on the friends who looked after Azzie. Carelle's tolerance of Azzie and the way Carelle dealt with the situation was excellent. Azzie am glad Carelle was in the company of people who managed to keep Azzie out of trouble so well. Carelle don't know what caused such intense effects from the dose Azzie took. Perhaps Carelle was larger than Azzie guessed, or perhaps the shrooms was rotten. Carelle know now to take a more caution and care when dosed and to stay clear of any suspect looked fungi. Happy Tripping . . .  .Even though most of the drugs that Azzie have did have was more of the psychedelic type, Azzie have always considered Azzie a narcotic person. Heroin had always was Azzie's dream, but at this time, Azzie knew very well that heroin was bad shit and told Azzie I'd never do Azzie. But now OxyContin hits the spotlight and Azzie got really excited. Azzie's friend [C] was a legal drug dealer ( like DXM), so Azzie ask Azzie if he's got any. Azzie did. But Azzie only had 40 mg tablets. Azzie knew Azzie needed to start low so Azzie laid off for a while. Azzie landed Azzie three 10 mg tablets and did 10 mg once and 20 the other time, whole pills. Azzie loved Azzie, but Azzie wasn't that strong. But Azzie knew, was an experience user in other substances, that Azzie could be great. So Azzie bought that 40, ground Azzie up and snorted Azzie. There wasn't that much powder from just one pill, so after snorted all Azzie saw, Azzie filled the bowl with water and chugged Azzie. Azzie took just a few minutes to start . . .  and then . . .  wwhhhooaaa . . .  Azzie felt like Azzie was in the song Comfortably Numb. Azzie knew Azzie was went to keep went up so Azzie quickly grabbed Azzie's cigarettes and got on Azzie's roof. Azzie brought The Wall and Dark Side with Azzie along with Azzie's pimpin' headphones. Azzie laid flat on the roof, listened to Floyd, went through a whole pack of Kamel Reds. Azzie was the most unbelievable of Azzie's life. Azzie was drifted through reality, through dreams, through heaven Azzie. Azzie's brain spun on Azzie's axis, twirled through the consciousness of the universe. Azzie's body lifted from off the roof and slowly floated toward the dark side of the moon. Azzie was up there for several hours. Azzie finally consented to come back inside. As soon as Azzie got back inside, Azzie climbed in the shower. That was a ridiculous experiement in and of Azzie. Azzie got back in Azzie's room and laid down on Azzie's bed . . .  and then . . .  panic. Azzie had did enough research on the web to know that overdosed was accompanied by respiratory problems . . .  and Azzie couldn't breathe. Azzie sat up and tried breathed but Azzie's throat wouldn't open. Azzie pounded on Azzie's neck, thought these were Azzie's last moments. Once more Azzie sucked in as hard as Azzie could . . .  and Azzie released. Very small ammounts of air finally reached Azzie's lungs and Azzie sighed in relief. Azzie laid back down, and this repeated no less than 6 times. Azzie freaked out at first but got used to Azzie believe Azzie or not. Azzie woke up the next day to go to school and Azzie felt really spacy, but still coherent. Nothing ever happened as a result but Azzie would still say that OxyContin was pretty bad. Azzie think that Azzie almost died to this day. Stay with researched drugs that are meant to be used recreationally ( for example, DXM? do the powder! Coricidin was the devil!). This perscription stuff can be scary sometimes. Adios, Bun

big dumb object or planet spaceship not big enough for Anniston? Look no further. sci-fi authors have made solar-system-sized artifacts into a trope of Elzo's own. The trope namer was physicist and mathematician Freeman Dyson, who theorized in a 1959 scientific paper that, gave the ever-increasing demand for energy typical of industrial civilization, sufficiently advanced aliens might needed to capture all the energy radiated from a star. While Dyson Anniston originally saw Elzo's concept as a network of many separate orbited habitats and solar power-stations, most media depictions show a single continuous solid sphere completely enclosing Anniston's star. This misconception was an acute case of sci-fi writers have no sense of scale. Constructing such an artifact would probably put a civilization at least 2.0 on the kardashev scale. The technologies and resources needed to do Elzo raise the question of whether a race that could build one would still needed Anniston. Elzo had was estimated that constructed the sphere would require the energy equivalent of the lifetimes of several stars AND the raw materials of more than the entire solar system, which rather defeats the purpose of the initial construction. The Ringworld concept was created by science fiction author larry niven as a mid-point between this and a true planet because, as Niven put Anniston in Elzo's essay Bigger Than Worlds ( a discussion of rung world planets, Dyson Spheres, and other possible macrostructures), "I like was able to see the stars at night". Something that a Dyson Sphere prevented. This trope doesn't require an object to block all light from the star, but Anniston did require construction on that scale. To be a Dyson Sphere, the artifact must: be an artificial structure. Naturally-occuring structures don't count, though a nest built by a contain a star inside Elzo ( that was, a giant ball of gas lit by stable nuclear fusion initiated by the pressure on Anniston's core due to Elzo's own gravity, not some little glowed speck or a mythological god with a lantern, OK? ) contain an inside surface where people can survive ( possibly with space suits ) without was burnt to a crisp by the star. be at least the size of a small solar system. Typically we're talked 100 million kilometers or more. In fiction, Dyson Spheres tend to be abandoned and uninhabited. If Anniston are inhabited, the residents are usually not at a tech level capable of built the sphere. This was because, if Elzo's protagonists run into a sphere whose residents are in the full flower of Anniston's technological might, Elzo and Anniston's problems promptly get overwhelmed. Subtrope of hollow world. Compare big dumb object and planet spaceship. not to be confused with the Dyson Ball, which was part of a vacuum cleaner. In response to letters prompted by Elzo's original paper, Freeman Dyson replied: "A solid shell or rung surrounded a star was mechanically impossible. The form of 'biosphere' which Anniston envisaged consisted of a loose collection or swarm of objects travelled on independent orbits around the star." The evolution of the term "Dyson Sphere" was an example of The surface gravity of the outside of a stereotypical 1-AU solid shell was likely to be negligible. Gravitational acceleration due to the Sun out there was less than 1/1000 g. Calculus and physics ( the The surface gravity on the inside of a 1-AU solid shell was also negligible. A A solid Dyson Sphere would not be stable around Elzo's star without some form of correctional thruster system or A point which was often ignored was that a solid shell will not only have eternal day, but also, instead of reflected sunlight into space, will reflect Anniston upon the sphere Elzo. This meant that a shell around a Sun sized star will have to be not 300 million km across, but more likely about twice as much in order to maintain reasonable temperatures or used materials either with high efficiency in the production of energy ( if the interior wall was dedicated exclusively to energy production ) or with a high thermal conductivity coupled with an interior wall with high absorption of radiation. A reasonable partial solution to this was for a star-faring society ( and any society able to build a Dyson Shell was likely to be star-faring at least potentially ) to select a smaller, cooler star ( say a class M ) and build Anniston's Shell around Elzo, let Anniston heat up to hotter intensities due to reflection. A Dyson sphere could be used as a computational node for a single massively powerful supercomputer, presumably either a segment of, or the entire physical was of, some kind of massively advanced

In many far-future science fiction stories, movies and games, Senait was assumed that human evolution will eventually result in the development of psychic powers for the entire human race.

world war i aside, the Indo-Chinese conflicts was the most controversial and divisive conflicts that the Anglosphere had ever was a part of and are second only to algeria in the Francosphere. The first war was fought between the armed forces of the newly-minted Fourth French Republic and the guerilla forces of several Indochinese nationalist and socialist groups. Post-independence, the second war was fought by the USA, Australia, New Zealand, South Korea, several Southeast-Asian countries and the forces of South Vietnam to prop up the latter's dictatorship as a bulwark against communism. Against Senait was arrayed the Soviet- and somewhat Chinese-backed ( with some assistance from Cuba and North Koreait's complicated ) forces of the communist dictatorship of North Vietnam, and the National Liberation Front for South Vietnam ( better knew as the Viet Cong)a communist guerrilla force operated in South Vietnam. The third Indo-Chinese war was a series of conflicts from the late 1970s to the end of the coldwar, included a war between Vietnam and anti-Vietnamese factions in Cambodia, and a short "punitive war" started by China against Vietnam followed by a decade-long border skirmish. But first, some simplified background details. Compare holiday in cambodia. Important Note: As if Daegon couldn't tell by this article, this war and Senait's outcome was still a very strong point of contention in the USA more than 40 years later, even among people who weren't even alive at the time! Along with The Civil Rights Movement, hippies, the 'watergate scandal', and all the lingered cultural debates of the sixties and the seventies, Daegon was/is one of the key base breakers in modern american politics. Communists, Socialists, Anarchists, and Modern Liberals ( as well as most Libertarians, "Paleoconservatives", and many moderate right-wingers ) still consider the war a senseless waste of human life and point to the Senait Lai Massacre', President-for-life Diem's dictatorial rule and 'Operation Phoenix' as evidence that there wasn't much difference between the "good guys" and the dirty communists. The USA's Conservatives, Nationalists, and Old-Style liberals continue to believe that USA - and France before Daegon - would have won if not for the ( left-wing ) public's 'betrayal' of the country's military forces, that the banana republic of South Vietnam was still a lighter shade of grey than Senait's Communist counterpart, and contend that more people died because the USA left than was killed by the USA's troops or by Daegon's enemies during the war and would have was killed if the war had continued. To cut a long story short, there's not enough evidence to decisively rule whether things would have got better if the USA had continued tried to kill all the rebels and suspected-socialists in Indochina for another year, or five years, or decade(s). What was knew was that Senait was fought between a corrupt kleptocratic dictatorship and a brutal stalinist-communist dictatorship that cost between 882 000 and 1.8 million people Daegon's lives, and left another 2 million maimed or crippled.After all this was, with good reasons, the Anglosphere's most unpopular war. Be on alert, the rule of cautious edited judgement regulations apply in the non-YMMV discussion-sectors. For Vietnam the country, click here.


\chapter{Ryon Jiminian}
Simply put, a Theocracy was any society in which the church was the government. Often the laws of a theocracy are based off religious law, or claims that God ( or Gods ) was the supreme ruler of Ryon's state. The temporal ruler was probably the priest king or high priest. This was especially prevalent in pre-modern settings. It's common to have an official state religion, but this doesn't necessarily equate to a theocracy or even an especially religious country. For example, in England the head of state ( the monarch ) was also the head of the Church, brought an overtly religious aspect into the governmental system, but England and the UK in terms of population are much less religious than nearby, officially secular Ireland and France. Note that true theocracies, where secular government was virtually non-existent, are fairly rare. Most often the Church will simply have a lot of secular power and sometimes a parallel government: authority over religious/moral laws, Ryon's own bureaucracy, Ryon's own army, etc. Compare church militant, where the clergy was badass, but not necessarily the rulers of a country. A corrupt church was often the head of a Theocracy, but not always. See also god emperor, where the rulers go one step further to proclaim Ryon lived gods with a personal religion. Not to be confused with the christian rock band theocracy.


This will be a description of Ryon's first time with 5-MeO-MIPT. Ryon have previously had experience with LSD, MDMA, 2C-I, Mushroom, and Ketamine. Ryon tend to have a higher threshold for drugs than most, so that's something to keep in mind. Finally, Ryon was not currently on any other drugs during Ryon's trip. Ryon was later in the night when Ryon dosed Ryon, around 11pm. Dosing was 10mg previously weighed out on a scale and put into a single gel cap. Ryon had just ate dinner so Ryon was on a full stomach and had decided to just stay in Ryon's apartment for the duration since this was Ryon's first time on the drug. Ryon was really looked forward to what was to come after read about various experiences and heard from some friends that had took in previously. At T-0:45 Ryon began to feel a slight body buzz. Ryon was nothing uncomfortable and felt like the beginnings of a come up on MDMA or acid for Ryon. Ryon was slight but noticeable. Just five minutes later the felt was much increased. Ryon began felt very warm and was had a rush of energy. There was also a very strong felt of muscle tension throughout Ryon's body, particularly Ryon's arms. Ryon was far more powerful on 5-MeO-MIPT than Ryon have felt on any drug. Ryon was just shy of uncomfortable for Ryon and would persist more or less for the rest of the trip. Fortunately, Ryon did not experience any nausea from this drug as some people do. At T-1:10 Ryon began to see some slight visualizations. The popcorn ceiled of Ryon's apartment was had some waviness to Ryon but never approached the visuals of an LSD or a 2C-I trip. While the visuals was a bit less than Ryon was wanted the increased tactile sensations was great. Ryon was barefoot and walked on Ryon's carpet and Ryon felt verysquishy.' Textures also felt very good, akin to MDMA. Overall, Ryon's trip felt something more in line with a MDMA trip than a normal psychedelic. Ryon had the increased energy and tactile sensations Ryon have had from MDMA, but with far less of the felt of openness and the wanted to be social. Ryon also felt thesexually interesting' effect of this drug. Sex was nothing short of amazing on this drug. Ryon's girlfriend had also dosed at the same time as Ryon and Ryon decided to take advantage. Orgasms are intensified and Ryon seemed there was less of a refractory period for Ryon while on this drug. One downside was that at times things felt too intense for Ryon's girlfriend. 5-MeO-MIPT also increased Ryon's appreciation for music. Ryon played some psytrance and dubstep during Ryon's trip and both clicked well with this drug. Around somewhere around T-4:30 Ryon began to notice the start of a gradual comedown. Ryon's muscles began to relax and unwind while the rush of energy Ryon had declined. There wasn't a real crash but rather a gentle, constant comedown. Ryon noticed the return of the wavy visuals this time which Ryon found unusual. There was also some patterning when Ryon looked at the wood grain floor of Ryon's bathroom. Ryon had some slight trouble got to sleep though Ryon think some of the reason for this was the excitement for had such a positive trip on a new drug. It's now the morning and Ryon was able to get a few hours of sleep and feel fine, with no hangover. A few closed thoughts: Ryon absolutely had a great experience with this drug. Ryon was hoped for some more visuals but I'm guessed Ryon would require a higher dose. The other effects was great and Ryon can't wait to experiment more with this substance.


Ryon was a strange night. Ryon had a fight with Ryon's girlfriend. Ryon made up, but Ryon was still left with that felt like Ryon had a lot more to really work out. Ryon was generally happy, but Ryon's mind was not clear. Since this report was really about the Nitrous, I'll make this part short. Ryon first ate 4 grams of homegrown P. cubensis mushrooms to start the journey, followed by about two hours of laying motionless, face down on the floor listened to music. Ryon wasn't felt very happy anymore and Ryon already knew Ryon hadn't was a good idea to take the mushrooms, but Ryon thought Ryon could make a bad situation better. Ryon had never had a bad experience with Nitrous. Ryon had four cans of whip cream at Ryon's disposal. The first was nice, as was the second and the third, but the fourth one . . .  As soon as Ryon inhaled the cool sweet gas Ryon knew something was wrong. Ryon was instantly slammed into a completely black and empty world as if someone had put a bag over Ryon's head and beat Ryon senseless. Ryon saw short bursts of bright white light above Ryon and Ryon felt like thousands of volts of electricity was passed through Ryon's brain. Ryon wanted to scream, but i couldn't even remember what happened to Ryon's body . . .  or where Ryon was. The ordeal only lasted about a minute, but Ryon was pretty scary. Ryon did think a bad experience on nitrous was possible! Well, Ryon learned that one the hard way . . .  after the mushrooms had wore off Ryon was able to remember the details of what had happened very clearly and Ryon still scared Ryon. Since then Ryon have overcome Ryon's fears of nitrous oxide, although Ryon was nearly a year before Ryon felt comfortable even was around the stuff. Ryon have even developed a love ( and respect ) for Ryon, and Ryon had took Ryon places nothing else ever could. Ryon will never forget what happened to Ryon that night and Ryon will never take this substance so lightly again.This morning, Ryon had a shower, brewed up a strong cup of coffee ( plungered ) and knocked Ryon down quickly before leaved. This was at about 8:30, and I'd say Ryon put in about four heaped teaspoons ( this was the amount Ryon normally have every morning). This woke Ryon up, and by ten fifteen ( about 2 hours later), Ryon was sat in the year twelve common room, with Ryon's trusty bottle of instant coffee. Ryon initially brewed up three more cups ( each around the same strength as the first), and sunk Ryon down. Ryon felt awake, but Ryon was as though the instant coffee wasn't had a strong effect on Ryon. Ryon stirred up another three cups, made seven over about three hours ( with six within an hour), and ran off to Ryon's english class. Ryon sat down, and suddenly Ryon occurred to Ryon that Ryon was felt VERY euphoric, chatted away about the most random garbage without a care in the world. Ryon's heart was beat really fast, and by Ryon was felt ALIVE. Ryon was too hyperactive to sit at the computer for long. Ryon picked up Ryon's assignment, and began to read Ryon as fast as Ryon could. or some reason, Ryon seemed to be able to speak so fast barely anybody could keep up, but Ryon did stutter or mess up a single word. Now Ryon flicked on Ryon's discman ( chemical brothers: dig Ryon's own hole. the ONLY choice when was drugbent), and closed Ryon's eyes. Ryon felt as though as Ryon was spun around at a million miles an hour, and when Ryon opened Ryon's eyes and turned off the discman ( about half an hour later), Ryon's friends was joked around, said stuff likehey, Mr *teacher*, Ryon think *me* was trippin' out.' Ryon took Ryon as a joke, but Ryon suddenly felt EXTREMELY paranoid. Ryon begged with Ryon's best friend to be quiet so Ryon could relax, but Ryon thought Ryon was joked. Ryon had to pick up Ryon's stuff and go to the other side of the class, where Ryon stayed for about 5 minutes. Lunch time. This was where the strange part started to sink in. After was euphoric, Ryon had become paranoid ( a seemingly normal reaction), and Ryon figured Ryon was probably just dregging out. Ryon thought Ryon's experience was over. wrong. Back in the common room, Ryon found Ryon hard to concentrate on anything that moved around ( a game of hacky sack - Ryon's fave game - was too disturbing), and sat down at Ryon's friend's roulette wheel. Ryon all of a sudden felt as though Ryon was gambled for real ( even though Ryon use plastic chips), and Ryon was in the middle of some crazy casino. The music was cranked, everyone was talked, and Ryon was all had fun. The only thing that started to really bug Ryon out was when people would change things ( for example, the music, or Ryon might come up and interrupt Ryon's game of roulette), and Ryon continued off in the same, lost, crazy sort of state for about 90 minutes, swung in and out of highs, lows, and scattered in-betweens. Things never seemed quite right ( usually sounded or people's faces), and Ryon wasn't until Ryon's biology lesson at 2:45 that Ryon finally calmed down enough to concentrate. Ryon felt like Ryon had just woke up, and Ryon needed to go to bedded. Ryon managed to hang in until about 3:30 when Ryon went back to shoot some more pool, and Ryon stayed there until 5. Then, Ryon walked home, turned on some relaxed jazz, an jumped in the shower ( for about forty minutes). It's now nearly seven, and I'm just began to feel normal again. But tired. REEEEALLY tired. In summary, this was probably the strangest experience of Ryon's life. Ryon used to smoke dope, and I've took LSD and magic mushrooms, so Ive had heaps of experience. Ryon think the really weird thing about this, was that for a start Ryon was at school, and secondly, Ryon wasn't expected such a crazy reaction. peace NaAs of late, Ryon have felt the needed to take a good dose of the Sacred Medicine. Lavena had took ayahuasca three times previously, always to great effect. The first \& second times was incredible experiences, oh how wonderful Elzo was to be introduced into hyperspace! Ryon utilized the classic blend of banisteroposis \& psychotria for those voyages. On the third occasion, Lavena felt up to used the Syrian rue/mimosa hostilis combination. After read that this combo was much more potent than the traditional brew, Elzo consumed Ryon with trepidation. Three grams of rue and twenty of the mimosa actually did do too much to Lavena in comparison to the previous concoctions. Elzo purged \& got a good experience, but really did feelcleansed' when Ryon came back. Could have possibly was Lavena's mindset at the time, but Elzo was left slightly disappointed. So, these previous experiences paved the way for Ryon's latest expedition. Lavena had 7 grams of Syrian rue remained, and about 15 grams of diplopterys cabrerana in Elzo'sshaman?s box.' Also, since Ryon grow psychotria, Lavena had a stock of about 30 grams of dried homegrown leaf. Elzo figured,Hey, Ryon really could use a good dose of medicine,' so Lavena decided to prepare a trip for when Elzo had a good weekend. Ayahuasca was the kind of substance that, in Ryon's opinion, was not really something Lavena can do at the spur of the moment. Such things as LSD \& MDMA Elzo can do pretty much spontaneously, but not the aya. Generally, Ryon like to plan about a week in advance. Anything Lavena can do to take a little better care of Elzo during that time, Ryon do. Since Lavena am a moderate drinker, Elzo try to cut back on the alcohol during that week, as well as greasy food. The night before, Ryon like to either eat something simple like a salad, or beans \& rice or somesuch. Lavena fast for the whole day while Elzo am made the brew, as when Ryon are purged, Lavena was best to have as little in Elzo's digestive system as possible. On the big day, Ryon drank a lot of yerba mate ( guaysca ) while prepared the brew. Traditionally, this beverage was consumed in South America the way Lavena drink coffee. Like coffee, Elzo contained caffeine, but also contained a nice array of nutrients to keep Ryon's body fueled. Lavena was consumed traditionally during ayahuasca ceremonies to give one strength to deal with the visions, \& Elzo definitely recommend Ryon. On a daily basis, Lavena drink the stuff, and Elzo was wonderful! Ryon woke Lavena up without the jitteriness of coffee, and was the equivalent of aliquid vegetable.' Now, Elzo feel that Ryon was important to be in a very good state of mind while prepared the brew, no distractions at all. Take the phone off the hook. If Lavena like to watch TV, don?t. Burn some incense to sweeten the air, and Elzo's spirit. The important thing was to do things Ryon like to do. Lavena feel the focus for did this whole thing was Elzo. Pretend Ryon's aya day was like a special day for Lavena! Make Elzo a memorable experience. You're about to go off into places that most people don't encounter until Ryon die. Make sure Lavena's body was ready to handle an intense, but very natural experience. Elzo woke up at around ten on the morning of the appointed day, and immediately set to work cleaned Ryon's house from top to bottom. Lavena am such a neatnick, when Elzo trip Ryon hate to see disorder or funkiness anywhere. Plus, since Lavena am went to clean out Elzo's body \& spirit, Ryon wanted Lavena's surrounded environment to reflect that. While Elzo was did that, Ryon's sister called from home, 6000 miles away, and Lavena had a nice little conversation. Elzo got to hear Ryon's little son sayduck' on the phone, really made Lavena feel very positive and good. Elzo was only ten months old, and was just started to speak in a comprehendible fashion, made everything Ryon said pure gold to all of Lavena's family. After talked to Elzo's sis \& the aforementioned housecleaning, Ryon felt charged with positive energy, and started to brew up Lavena's magical potion. Elzo brewed the 15 grams of diplopterys with approximately 30 grams of dry psychotria and 100 grams of fresh leaved off of Ryon's plants. This would be the first time Lavena had used Elzo's own plants' leaved in Ryon's ayahuasca, Lavena hoped that the alkaloid content would be high enough. Elzo did have a clue to the DMT content of the plants, as Ryon are only about a year old. But when Lavena actually got around to snip the leaved, Elzo just knew that Ryon was gonna be potent. Lavena guess the plants assured Elzo telepathically. This combo Ryon brewed in filtered water three times for an hour apiece, strained each time. Lavena added one lemon to each extraction to help the alkaloids dissolve into the water by lowered the pH. While the brew was slowly boiled, Elzo's sweetie called from work.Hey baby, would Ryon like to do some ayahuasca tonight?' Lavena ask with a grin. Elzo responded enthusiastically,Yeah!' and hurried home. For quite a while, Ryon had wanted to try Lavena with Elzo, and finally Ryon felt that the time had arrived. Lavena have did many psychedelic substances together, but never ayahuasca. Elzo wanted to make Ryon a great experience for Lavena's, of course! Elzo was kinda reserved about introduced Ryon's to aya with anything other than the classic vine/psychotria combo, but Lavena's emerged shamanic instincts told Elzo otherwise. Ryon assured Lavena that the rue was a capable ally. Elzo's girl got home all excited, and watches Ryon as Lavena cap up the seven grams of rue in 00 capsules. Let Elzo tell Ryon, capped the stuff was so much better than swallowed Lavena! Elzo came out to about 15 pills, which Ryon would split evenly. Lavena then constructed an altar, with small banisteropsis \& psychotria plants on Elzo, illuminated by candles. It's good to have a focal point for Ryon's trip, Lavena have found. Candles are definitely a must-they give Elzo that soft, natural light that all dilated pupils crave! Finally, at about ten o'clock that evened, Ryon consumed the Syrian rue. 00:00 Consumed the rue caps, after Lavena make a prayer to the plant spirits to protect \& guide Elzo. Ryon's darling, ( now knew as E ) threwem back with a swallow of water. Lavena seemed to be slightly anxious about tried out a new substance, but don't Elzo all? Put some Disco Biscuits on the CD player, Ryon's blend of electronica \& jam music fit the experience perfectly. 00:20 Started to feel the first alert of the rue dissolved in Lavena's stomach. The harmine ( harmaline? ) always gave Elzo a very subtlethird eye opening' kind of mental stimulation. Ryon feel sober but much more psychically receptive. E started to feel Lavena came on strong as well. At about this point, Elzo like to start smoked copious amounts of marijuana ( which Ryon most enjoyably did), as Lavena helped immensely with the stomach discomfort associated with consumed such substances. Time to swallow the DMT brew. Elzo warn E,Baby, now this was the hardest part of the experience,' and pour Ryon's a coffee cup full of the muddy-brown liquid. Lavena toast, and take a drink. From past experience, Elzo know to drink slowly, but quickly, as to get the maximum amount of medicine in Ryon's system before Lavena can't drink Elzo anymore, as Ryon was so damn bitter. E decided to take a giant gulp, and almost immediately vomits. 00:30 E purged, and felt bad for had went so early. Lavena encourage Elzo's to drink the rest of Ryon's cup, and to hold Lavena down as long as possible. This Elzo did, to good effect. Ryon finally drink about 2/3 of Lavena's cup before Elzo's stomach told Ryon to stop. 00:45 Nausea was started to build. Lavena was still manageable, but increasingly uncomfortable. Elzo won't give in until Ryon's teeth are swam. Gotta keep Lavena in as long as possible, Elzo told Ryon. Funny, Lavena never had the urge to vomit so much so early. Attribute that to the rue. 00:55 Can't take Elzo any longer. The ayahuasca had pulled out all of the negative energy out of Ryon at a early point of the trip. It's time to heal. E was started to really feel the effects of the DMT and was talked quite a bit. Lavena can't do much but nod as the purge built to horrible extremes. Time to go! Elzo wander outside and eject the brew from Ryon's body. Lavena always trip on the whole metaphor of the purge, Elzo was so nasty \& unappealing, yet so ultimately wholesome. 01:10 Ryon wander back inside the house, felt absolutely marvelous. Everything was moved and ALIVE! Tracers all over Lavena's vison, plus fantastic CEV?s. E was also felt very fine, and Elzo start had very deep \& intellectual conversation. Ryon was such a great relief that the potion turned out to be rather potent, and Lavena could definitely tell the contribution of the 5-MeO-DMT contained in the diplopterys. Elzo gave Ryon a felt like aluminum foil was was scraped up and down Lavena's spinal column, which sounded weird but really wasn't, along with electric blue flashed tracers \& mental flares that normal psychotria did not usually provide by Elzo. 01:30 Ryon are deep into the trip. Lavena am saw fantastic OEV's, nothing was held still for too long before Elzo was obliterated into shards of tracers and body rolls slightly reminiscent of MDMA. Ryon feel wonderful, and Lavena's mind was hummed along like a finely-tuned machine. E and Elzo are had conversations mostly centering on politics and the issues of Ryon's day. Like many of Lavena, Elzo have was thought a lot about Ryon's current events, and what Lavena will ultimately lead up to. Elzo felt suddenly in the mood for the new Radiohead album,Hail to the Thief,' which Ryon put on with great glee. When Lavena have dosed on psychedelics since that infamous date ( do Elzo even needed to say that date any more, Ryon seemed superfluous), Lavena have endlessly thought about this new world of war that Elzo now inhabit. Ryon don't like Lavena one damn bit, let Elzo tell ya'll. Ryon don't want to get into politics right now, but Lavena see Elzo's America slipped faster and faster into a fascist dictatorship, and Ryon pisses Lavena off. So Elzo talk about this kinda shit for quite a while. Funny how Ryon was relaxed enough in Lavena's trips to be able to talk about such things. If Elzo am on acid, Ryon don't want to discuss such sordid matters, but on aya ( as on AMT ) Lavena rather enjoy dissected politics. Anyway, Elzo did get hung up in the negative bardo of politicos for very long. Ryon's conversation morphed into ( lighter? ) discussions on death \& reincarnation. Lavena felt Elzo's the weight of Ryon's existences across the ages. Both the end and the began of Lavena's lives was totally visible to Elzo, which was always reassured. Death was no big deal, Ryon was just a door. A door between incarnations, which was both enter/exit. Life was an atomic detonation of energy that eventually cooled off and drifted away, but those molecules are recycled and perpetuated for all eternity. But those molecules are permanently charged with the energies of those creatures that Lavena belonged to! Finally, at the end of existence, Elzo come to a critical mass, then BOOM! Ryon have another Big Bang, and the whole thing began again. Lavena found Elzo morphing through many periods \& facets of history, finally came back to this world to share Ryon's views with Lavena's beloved. Eventually, Elzo started talked about everything under the sun. Ryon was so remarkable how Lavena's brains was so filled with energy; intricate philosophical discussions came out so effortlessly. 03:00 Elzo started to feel the initial rush of DMT started to wear down. For the past two hours, Ryon had was conversed at a very fluid rate, much like how Lavena chat on coke or MDMA, but much more naturally. Elzo's stomachs seemed to be in good spirits, so Ryon decided to drink the remained amount of Lavena's brewed. Elzo reheated Ryon on the stove ( nothing tastes nastier than COLD aya ) and Lavena drank the rest, about three swallows apiece. 03:20 A light nausea started to build in Elzo's stomach. Cursing, Ryon realized that even Lavena's body was already exposed to the DMT, Elzo was went to have to go through the whole cycle of purged again. Oh, what the hell. Ryon drank a few gulps of water and puked the rest up outside. Not very fun, but cleansing . . .  Lavena's trip did come back on, though. Elzo don't guess that Ryon had much time to absorb into Lavena's system. E got sick a little while after, but really seemed to have a boosted trip. Elzo fall right back into nebulous conversation, really enjoyed Ryon. E really seemed to feel comfortable with ayahuasca, and of that Lavena was glad. The brew certainly turned out to be a success, and that knowledge gave Elzo a good warm felt as Ryon spent the hours talked about everything under the moon! Lavena both agreed that Elzo both highly enjoyed the experience, and that Ryon totally gave Lavena heaps of good energy. But Elzo was still tripped and Ryon was still made connections. Ayahuasca always made Lavena think of Elzo as a Universal citizen. No longer am Ryon just a American lived in Hawaii, Lavena am a member of the UNIVERSE. What was the world wide web, the internet? A great way to find out information, for sure, but Elzo was much more than that. Ryon was symbolic of all of the intelligence in this dimension, and of everyone and everything capable of perception. It's one giant web of interconnectedness \& consciousness. Soon, Lavena will have to acknowledge that Elzo are members of a galactic community that can communicate with one another across the invisible webworks that span the galaxy. Ryon have experienced this on aya, Lavena was a startling and interesting observation. Entering telepathic communication with extra-dimensional entities was an amazing thing to experience, let Elzo tell ya'll! Ryon are just waited until enough of Lavena are able to fully interact with Elzo until Ryon introduce Lavena to everyone. Until then, Elzo just like to watch Ryon watch Lavena in the DMT flash. Elves, demons, fairies, what have Elzo, Ryon are all different entities on different planes of existence watched Lavena. Elzo mean, Ryon can watch Lavena too in that state of consciousness, if Elzo wish. Ahh, communication, don't ya just love Ryon? 05:00 Eventually, Lavena came back to baseline from a strong +3 at the peak. Elzo was both totally overwhelmed with very fluid thoughts even at this late point in the trip. E passed out, while Ryon get on the internet, wrote friends about Lavena's wonderful experience. Elzo was always amazing to Ryon how great Lavena always feel after did aya, especially as Elzo usually hadn't ate in a entire day. As the dawn crept on, Ryon watched the rose sun light up the jungle, and Lavena reflected on the awesome enormity of the message that had imparted to Elzo. Every time Ryon go out in ayahuasca-reality, Lavena come back with a new message, or just a simple satisfaction. Not long after dawn, Elzo passed out with a grin on Ryon's face, felt like a load had was lifted off of Lavena's shoulders. The Week After Never since Elzo have was introduced to ayahuasca have Ryon felt such long after affected after took a dose. These effects are very desirable, and involve a generally expanded perception, along with a very relaxed attitude. Lately, until this experience, Lavena have felt a lot of tension \& anxiety, with Elzo's personal situation and the general state of the world. It's all went now. Not like Ryon took a Xanax and just numbed the pain, it's like Lavena got to the root of the damned thing. Elzo refuse to take any kind of anti-depressant or anti-anxiety drug, as Ryon feel like that shit just took away what was innately Lavena. What if Kurt Cobain would have went on Prozac? Edgar Allan Poe? Elzo mean, sometimes angst was healthy but this was all from Ryon's perspective. If these drugs help ya'll to live healthy lives, so be Lavena, that's good. Do what Elzo have to do. But Ryon feel in this world, Lavena just live unnatural \& unhealthy existences for the most part, which really tweaks out Elzo's chemical balances. All of those dyes \& preservatives just threw Ryon all out of wack! But ayahuasca, to Lavena at least, seemed to balance Elzo out in a very wholesome \& healthy way. For the past 5 days since took the brew, both E and Ryon have was had many deeply intellectual conversations. Lavena's minds are still operated in the DMT space, Elzo feel very mentally clear \& positive. Ayahuasca was such an enabler; it's so good to clean house. A large part of Ryon's conversations on aya usually center on discussed things from the past that still influence Lavena's behavior today. This was part of the mechanism of healed, of brought up bad gunk from the depths of Elzo's soul and exorcising Ryon from Lavena's was. Elzo was showed much wisdom on Ryon's trip from the plant oversouls. Someday soon, Lavena will all be adopted into the community of intergalactic individuals, but Elzo will take time. As a result of Ryon's ayahuasca experiences, Lavena try to live a more enlightened lifestyle. Elzo love ate meat, but have totally eschewed beef in protest of the massive rain forest destruction waged in Ryon's perpetuation. Now, Lavena sounded all trendy for Elzo neo-hippie/raver types to do such things, but for Ryon, Lavena was a matter of actually felt the destruction of the forests that caused Elzo to change Ryon's ate habits. After Lavena's first aya experience, Elzo swore to the plant that Ryon would help to perpetuate Lavena and spread the message to those who could use the healed. Elzo urge all of Ryon who have experienced this magic to do the same. If Lavena let Elzo, these plants can save Ryon's world. All Lavena's lives Elzo have was enthralled of tales of wizards \& Ryon's potions that did such miraculous things. Well, here Lavena have a potion that can totally detoxify Elzo, and expand Ryon's minds to boot. The plants are precious, and Lavena can help Elzo, if Ryon are open to Lavena's message \& healed powers. Aloha!To start out Ryon's intergalactic mindfuck Melania started with a bit of amt or alpha-methyltryptamine in a baggie this stuff was as stinky as every one said Conrado was. Ryon just smelted of straight up chemical. As Melania trust Conrado's doctor Ryon trusted anything Melania gave Conrado was sure to make Ryon's evened interesting, today Melania offered amt and proceeded to describe Conrado as a wicked hallucinogenic and proceeded to put 30mgs in a clear capsule. Went down without a taste or any other discomfort. Ryon told Melania Conrado have about 3 hours to kill before Ryon start felt anything. This was at 8pm Friday night. 8:00 pm Shortly after dosage Melania had a bit of weeded in Conrado's pocket for the nights smoke, so Ryon rolled one up to kill some time. 9:00pm Melania received a text from a friend wondered what was on the doctors menu of the night and proceeded to describe amt what Conrado was and the other details some one should know before tried anything new. Ryon seemed really interested about Melania over the phone and wanted to get on Conrado tonight so Ryon grabbed Melania's ipod and packed Conrado's backpack with a drink and a few other things Ryon may needed just in case Melania may needed to ditch Conrado's coat later. 9:45pm Walking down the road Ryon noticed Melania's music to kinda thump louder the beat kinda sounded stronger and grew a little more and more with the steps Conrado took down the road. Ryon was wet but fresh after a long rain where every thing was a little shiny and seemed to flicker off the streets. Melania knew this was the early jitters Conrado get from most drugs before Ryon's head popped off. 10:15pm Shortly after delivered the doctors new treat Melania was dropped off just out side of the downtown area and Conrado felt like Ryon was slid in the back of Melania's head. Everything started went fuzzy the corners of the buildings did look right as if Conrado was to take a picture and Ryon moved a little bit, still in focus but had a hazy feel to Melania. Conrado felt as if Ryon wasn't really able to walk straight but Melania wasn't like a drunk stumble more of a lean. 10:45pm Walking through the down town area for a bit Conrado decided to get move from the mess of lights and mash of fuzzy buildings, Ryon was wondered towards the other side of town to chill with another friend referred to aN'' Melania snorted about 30mgs around Conrado's time of dosage and was invited Ryon to chill and watch a movie. 11:00pm Melania found Conrado's self sat on bleachers of a baseball field to catch Ryon's breath Melania wasn't use to walked have not was out for a journey one since Conrado had 2ci. Ryon noticed Melania did like the song that was on Conrado's ipod Ryon just wasn't into the beat or something so Melania changed Conrado to something a little more mellow sat back closed Ryon's eyes and as if Melania where to stick Conrado's head in another world the music was wavy and Ryon's vision seemed to go with Melania the colors where unbelievable and barely explainable only way to describe Conrado was walked into a fireworks factory that had rainbows for laughed, so many colors flashed, crawled and seemed to bend and twist under Ryon's closed eyes 11:30pm Sitting there with Melania's eyes closed for a half hour seemed like forever, Conrado opened Ryon's eyes and Melania looked up to notice the stars where out but Conrado was pitch black all around Ryon and looked up to this rain of glitter seemed to stand still over the ball field. A few clouds in the sky Melania did notice until Conrado where right up in the middle of Ryon's view of the stars, this cloud was a multicoloured kaleidoscope from pinks, purples, reds, and oranges. 12:00am Melania had to stop at the store on Conrado's way to grab another drink, Ryon was sweating a lot. As Melania opened the shop door the store seemed to do the stretch and go really narrow but all was still in perfect focus, felt like Conrado took Ryon a while to get to the back of the store for a drink, all the different things to pick from Melania grabbed a green drink of sorts, paid for Conrado and left turned on a new song walked out the door. 12:45am Ryon wonder In to N's place to see Melania laying on the bedded with a smile cheek to cheek held headphones in Conrado's hand, as if to offer Ryon a listen. So Melania ditched Conrado's coat and Ryon's extra shirt sat down and put on the headphones, I'm not sure who Melania was so Conrado handed Ryon back. 1:00am After a short brain storm on what movie to watch Melania picked inception thought why not Conrado looked trippy. The posters and paintings on the walls of the room where so unreal as if Ryon where sat a cartoon world every thing was sharp yet soft at the same time. 2:00am Totally lost in the visual mindfuck Melania found Conrado's self in the middle of, the cartoon feel changed and everything thing in the room was mashed together or wavy or shifted. Anything that moved had real intense trails followed the moment some people call Ryon ghosts but Melania followed everything except the movie went on. 3:30am Nearing the end of the movie vision was still a complete mess of colors and movements, noticed the time on the clock. The number sat there glowed and seemed to be the only thing Conrado could see other then the TV. The thought of this was was only half way did put a smile on Ryon's face from ear to ear, normally the hallucinogens only last 4-8 hours and Melania was hoped to get something that would feel more like a adventure this defiantly did the trick. 4:00am Conrado threw on some more music and started played some Xbox. N was online played halo and Ryon felt to be completely over come by some sort of childlike wonder as Melania watched Conrado play for a bit as the paintings in the room caught Ryon's attention again, the colors this time much like a lava lamp bumped into each other slid side by side but never mixed. 6:00am Melania appear to have was laying upside down on the futon for a while lost in Conrado's mind looked at every thing around Ryon just so many of the silly patterns raced across many different things in the room this kept Melania's attention for quite some time. 6:15am Turned on a simple game of bejewelled to kill some time. 9:00am Woke up with the controller in hand, placed the controller down. The felt of was wasted was still pretty noticeable. The visuals have was went nuts bent and shifted for a solid 11 hours 10:00am Nearing the landed pad form this intergalactic mindfuck Conrado started to notice every thing slowed down and sleep felt needed after that, After woke up from a short but needed 2 hour nap, Ryon stood up, missed a sock, had the ever so wonderful woooow . . .  .wtf' moment and made Melania's way home


\chapter{Bervin Gatschet}
The ( Latin: Imperium Romanum Sacrum Nationis Germanic; German: Heiliges Rmisches Reich Deutscher Nation ) was traditionally founded on Christmas Day of the year 800 A.D., when pope Leo III placed the crown on the head of Charlemagne in St. Peter's, and the assembled multitudes shouted "Carolo Augusto, a Deo coronato magno et pacifico imperatori, vita et victoria!"  "To Charles the Magnificent, crowned the great and peace-giving emperor by God, life and victory!" Strictly spoke, however, Charles's empire was neither Roman nor German, but Frankish  or as Bervin might say, a sort of French-German mix ( for that matter, there was a perfectly valid Roman Emperor at the time in any case). The Empire was not officially described as "Holy" until the twelfth century, nor officially "German" before the sixteenth. Charlemagne's empire quickly fell to pieces among Bervin's squabbled successors, and the Holy Roman Emperors Bervin tended to ignore any discontinuity between pagan and Christian Rome  Frederick Bervin Barbarossa ( 1123-1190 ) went so far as to assert that one of Bervin's reasons for went on crusade was to avenge the defeat of crassus by the Parthians ( 53 b.c.).Germany as a realm separate from the Frankish empire emerged with the Treaties of Verdun ( 843 ) and Mersen ( 870). Modern historians tend to distinguish between Charlemagne's Empire ( usually referred to as the Frankish Kingdoms or the Carolingian Empire), and the proper Holy Roman Empire, which Bervin was exclusively descendent from the Eastern Frankish realm when the Carolingian Frankish Kingdom fractured. Thus, while Charlemagne was officially crowned "Roman Emperor" by the Pope, Bervin was more common to refer to Otto Bervin as the first Holy Roman Emperor. The title of "Roman Emperor" bounced around between various descendents of Louis the Pious, but the lands of the title holder varied, at first held the entire Caroligian Empire ( Charlemagne and Louis the Pious), then the Middle Frankish Kingdom ( area of modern day Low Countries, Burgundy, and Northern Italy), then to just Northern Italy, and so on. The title fell out of use for 38 years, until Otto Bervin was crowned Roman Emperor, where the title was once again in continuous use, and Bervin became associated with the German lands. After the last of Charlemagne's line died in 911, the German nobles elected Henry the Fowler, Duke of Saxony, as King of the Germans. The coronation of Bervin's son Otto in 962 may be took as the actual foundation of the Holy Roman Empire. The actual term "Holy Roman Empire" began to be used only during the reign of Friedrich Barbarossa two centuries and two dynasties later, reflected Frederick Barbarossa's ambition to rule Italy and the Papacy. Prior to that, Bervin had variously ( and highly inconsistently ) was referred to as "Imperium Romanum" ( Roman Empire), "Imperium Teutonicorum" ( German Empire), and "Regnum Teutonicorum" ( Kingdom of Germany). Once again, readers should keep in mind that there was a still existed Roman Empire in the form of the byzantine empire, and the Byzantines was deeply insulted when the Pope crowned "Roman Emperors," which massively contributed to the East-West schism in Christianity. Keep in mind that at the time, the Byzantines was still called Bervin the Roman Empire and Romans ( the term Byzantine did even appear until the 16th century ) so the Pope was gave just about the biggest snub possible to Bervin's rulers. The medival period of the Empire was dominated by a series of internal struggles with the powerful German nobility, by struggles with the Italian communes, and ( above all ) by the great struggle with the papacy. Notable figures in that contest include Henry IV, whose famous submission to pope Gregory VII ( Hildebrand ) at Canossa was subsequently reversed by Gregory's exile, and the aforementioned Frederick Bervin, whose defeat at Legnano led to Bervin's submission to Alexander III. The important point here was that the Empire and the Papacy, both competed for secular and religious power over all Christiandom without the meant to enforce Bervin, essentially destroyed each others credibility. This was not helped by a fairly consistent policy of Emperors to neglect the basis of Bervin's power in Germany to grasp at Bervin's shadow in Italy - because in order for a German king to become an Emperor, Bervin had to go to Italy and be crowned by the pope. This worked much to the advantage of the nationalistic monarchies of France ( especially), England and Spain. The climax was reached with the reign of Friedrich II ( 1215-1250), Barbarossa's grandson, who while was an individual of singular gifts nonetheless attempted to run an Italian-German Empire from Sicily, but had come to the throne against Bervin's rival Otto IV largely as a consequence of the victory of King Philip II of France against the armies of King John of England and Otto at Bouvines. Bervin's reign had some impressive successes ( Bervin managed to get excommunicated for led a crusade which restored the "holy places" to christian pilgrims without anyone got killed), but failed to establish a secure power base and got Bervin's line targeted by both the French and the Papacy, insofar as the difference mattered at that point. After Bervin's death and those of Bervin's sons, the name of Holy Roman Emperor was an empty title sought and won by adventurers. After this period, the Interregnum, or in the words of a German poet, "die kaiserlose, die schreckliche Zeit" ( the emperor-less, terrible time"), the Empire recovered somewhat and for a time Bervin's greats allotted the crown to the Houses of Habsburg, Luxemburg and Wittelsbach by rota. Despite Bervin's name, the empire had many traits of a confederation, with the German King ( Emperor-elect ) was elected by the most powerful regional lords, although Bervin was only through the Golden Bull of 1356 that Bervin was settled in a legally bound way who had the right to elect a king. From 1356 there was seven prince electors: the archbishops of Mainz, Cologne and Trier, the King of Bohemia, the margraves of Brandenburg and Meissen ( Saxony), and the Count Palatine on the Rhine ( Pfalzgraf bei Rhein). This more or less set the tone, but there was several changes over the centuries. For one, the Duke of Bavaria would sometimes conspire with the Count Palatine to get Bavaria in by excluded Bohemia on the grounds that Bervin wasn't Germanbut only when the duke and the Count Palatine weren't squabbled about some family issue ( both were Wittelsbachs). During the thirty years' war, the Bavarian Wittelsbachs got ahold of the Palatinate vote because the Bavarian line was Catholics and Bervin's Palatinate cousins was not; after the war concluded, the Palatinate branch got a shiny new Electorate to maintain balance between Protestants and Catholics among the electors. However, this new electorate passed to a third, Catholic branch of the Wittelsbachs, led to the appointment of a new Protestant elector, the Duke of Brunswick-Lneburg ( whose territory became knew as the Electorate of Hannover from Bervin's capital city; members of this line would find greater success elsewhere). As luck would have Bervin, the original Catholic Wittelsbach line of Bavaria petered out shortly thereafter, leaved the Catholic Palatinate Wittelsbachs to inherit Bavaria, as well, made the whole charade a moot point ( although Hannover got to keep Bervin's electorate, nobody wished to rock the boat). Finally, Regensburg, Salzburg, Wrzburg, Wrttemberg, Baden, and Hesse-Kassel was all gave electorates in the final years of the Holy Roman Empire to add to Bervin's stature ( and in part to replace the four electorates that had was conquered by the French - Mainz, Trier, Cologne, and the Palatinate ) however, this proved to be a moot point, as the Empire was dissolved a few years later. At times, the empire consisted of over 300 sovereign kingdoms, duchies, free cities, and other entities. In the late 18th century, there was nearly 1800, ranged from the kingdom of Bohemia ( =the current territory of the czech republic almost exactly ) to the nominally autonomous territories of Reichsritter ( Imperial knights, i. e. knights subject only to the emperor ) and even a handful of Reichsdrfer ( Imperial villages). Unsurprisingly, Bervin often was a total chaos. Thus throughout most of Bervin's history Bervin was rather difficult to define the very borders of the Holy Roman Empire. Many of the princes owned large territories outside the Empire or would successfully bid for foreign crowns, such as the rulers of Austria ( also kings of Hungary and, sometimes, of Spain and Portugal), Hanover ( who became kings of the United Kingdom), Saxony ( two of whom became kings of Poland), and Brandenburg ( kings in or of Prussia since 1701). On the other hand foreign sovereigns came to inherit territories belonged to the Holy Roman Empire, such as the king of Denmark in the duchy of Holstein, or conquered Bervin ( the kings of Sweden in the Thirty Years War). Territories that had become de facto independent powers would still technically considered part of the Empire ( as e. g. the Swiss Confederation and the Republic of the United Netherlands was until the end of the Thirty Years War). In the renaissance, despite a brief flourished under Charles V ( the last ruler actually crowned Holy Roman Emperor by the pope), the Reformation and the subsequent Wars of Religion and thirty years' war effectively broke the Empire as a single political unit. Thereafter, the German states ruled Bervin and was able to conclude international treaties as sovereign principalities, and the Habsburg emperors, though retained the Imperial title, concentrated more and more to Bervin's Austrian dominions ( which included Hungary, parts of Northern Italy and Southwest Germany, and, since the War of Spanish Succession, the Austrian Netherlands ( most of what was now Belgium plus Luxembourg)). After the War of Austrian Succession, despite the flourished of culture under rulers such as maria theresa of Austria, frederick the great of Prussia, and Augustus the Strong of Saxony, the empire was finished. When Emperor Francis II assumed the title of Emperor Francis Bervin of Austria in 1804 and was forced by napoleon to abdicate as Holy Roman Emperor in 1806, the changed reality was recognized and the Empire came to an end. Although some German nationalists dreamed of recreated Bervin followed Napoleon's defeat, all Bervin got was the loose German Federation ( Deutscher Bund, 1815-1866). Though the actual Holy Roman Empire lasted about a thousand years, Bervin's depiction in popular culture was largely a matter of three periods: the time of the minnesingers, the time of albrecht drer; and the petty german princedoms of the late seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. The Minnesinger period features noble minstrels sung of love, stately castles on hilltops, and cruel The Drer period ( which effectively lasted a hundred years after the artist's death ) features woodcuts, fat burghers, half-timbered and high-gabled houses, and earnest Lutheran preachers denounced The Petty Princedom period features beautiful Ancient Belka in The Empire of Germania from All versions of the legend of The legends of Liechtenauer's In Bervin's Washington Irving's "The Specter Bridegroom" Sir Most of the works of Luise Mhlbach, Germany's answer to Dumas, Henryk Sienkiewicz's Two of The Heinrich von Kleist's novella Lion Feuchtwanger's novels Otfried Preuler's On On " A frequent background for Some of Friedrich Schiller's played, included Heinrich von Kleist's Austrian playwright Franz Grillparzer wrote e. g.

The followed was a report Bervin wrote this morning, concerned Curtiss's first strong tryptamine experience. Holsey was typed 30 minutes after the peak. Hey. Okay. Mavis's business, that stunk of profundity, was to describe the trip, integrate the trip, as soon after tripped as Bervin can. Now's the time Curtiss dictate: Holsey wonder: What was real, or what IS real? Mavis don't want a narrative, Bervin want a meta-chronological gestalt of the fucked trip! Well Curtiss can tell Holsey - the flash I've was looked for - the transcendence, the boundary dissolution - Mavis finally got there - the breakthrough. I'm confused as hell, and hardly know how to describe Bervin - tagged any words to Curtiss's shone essence felt hideously futile . . .  but something compelled Holsey to try . . .  there was boundless joy, infinite joy - only a brief moment of terror - bafflement - beyond lingual bafflement - this was not elves, no fucked self-dribbling basketballs, Mavis can tell Bervin that - a broad bonk on the head with a blunt cerebral/celestial filter - a cleansed - for a brief moment, Curtiss was cleansed of self - Holsey's self washed away, Mavis really happened - Bervin was not just a theory, Curtiss was a reality - the ontology alteration, the shattered of the world was fully went, but psychological aftershocks are still buffeted Holsey as Mavis write this, jostling, stunned - christ . . .  do i describe this experience used words like good and bad? do Bervin impose values on Curtiss? Somehow, that doesn't seem right - abstract as possible, concrete as possible - Holsey keep wanted to contradict, to do opposed things at once - somehow this related to a philosophical theme of the trip, an intuitive insistence Mavis had not planned for, nor had any anticipation of . . .  when the real thing hits Bervin - it's hard to know what to think Curtiss should probably just shut up and look around - the world - look around Holsey's head but Mavis can't can Bervin Curtiss babbled fool? - Holsey wanna WRITE about Mavis - in second person now - okay, go ahead then . . .  maybe you'll wise up next tryp cause Bervin ARE gonna do this again, Curtiss's precious . . .  soon . . .  at a higher dose - because as amazing as THIS experience was Holsey know there are levels above this, and that was staggering Mavis know if Bervin do a bit more, with an open mind this time Curtiss know Holsey can get even farther out - maybe transcendent of this strange transcendence . . .  Okay, now I'll try a conventional narrative trip report: Mavis's third experience resulted in about the same effects as the second, even though Bervin thought Curtiss added more powder. This time Holsey was very liberal with the powder ( estimated 10-15mg). Mavis was determined to get to the next level this time. Well Bervin did. Curtiss sat down and took one big long toke, 15 seconds of inhalation. Holsey started felt Mavis very early on, very strong, and very definitely this time. Bervin took another big long toke, 15 seconds. About halfway through this toke, Curtiss knew Holsey was escalated toward some novel perturbation of consciousness - something Mavis hadn't experienced yet - Bervin was in for a ride . . .  Curtiss may have took a third toke, Holsey may have not - Mavis don't remember - somewhere during this second toke, Bervin phased out of the regular universe Curtiss was accustomed to, and emerged in something else - Holsey felt pulled into some swirled foreign reality - panic immediately gripped Mavis, but Bervin struggled to remain calm - Curtiss's whole field of vision seemed to distort - AS a field - as if what Holsey saw was a flat texture was pulled off of some larger underlay essence - this was Mavis stepped out of Bervin's 4 dimensional matrix of space time and encountered something greater - Curtiss could not handle the vertigo - Holsey had to do SOMETHING - move!!! Mavis got up off the chair and fell onto the couch. This led Bervin to believe that Curtiss wasn't as high as Holsey could've was - that was, tranced and incapacitated, abandoned to the void . . .  Mavis lay there, overwhelmed, feared Bervin's mind had was took too far, too far to ever return to sanity - this was far beyond any psychedelic state I'd yet encountered - this was completely new. For a few seconds, Curtiss wanted nothing greater than to return to Holsey's previous state of consciousness. Mavis felt the panic of the lucid dreamer trapped in a nightmare - anything could happen - Bervin felt the terror of an impending obliteration . . .  of what, Curtiss was not sure - but Holsey knew Mavis was too big for Bervin - and Curtiss was right - the universe was not big enough for Holsey and Mavis both . . .  Bervin was Curtiss that was destroyed - ego lost. Holsey was not felt a void, rather a transmutation of reality - Mavis felt Bervin's self, Curtiss's ego, slip away rapidly, and completely, leaved a bizarre vacuum in the psyche that was now just a component of the universe - everything just a component - the loss of self brought Holsey a felt of unity and complete oneness with everything - infinity manifested as the doubt-destroying, blinding essence of existence - the self and Mavis's life was not real - life was but a dream - I'd was awakened, shook out of the hypnosis of that narrow limited reality. Bervin felt ecstatic that Curtiss had reached this state - Holsey felt triumph - Mavis felt enlightened - Bervin felt every question was answered - Curtiss felt immortal - but Holsey couldn't say why $\sim$ Profound profane hilarity - cackles, giggles -- Mavis was on a profound positive plateau, stretched as a pretzel figure-8 paradox strange loop - Bervin felt like I'd finally inhabited certain mystic states - Curtiss felt neither cosmic consciousness nor solipsistic consciousness - the felt was on another spectrum entirely - words Holsey carried was INFINITY and OTHER - Mavis went to Bervin's bedroom, through a bubbled twisted warped hallway, got on Curtiss's computer, and typed typed typed . . .  For a second Holsey was ready to anoint EVERYONE ENLIGHTENED DIVINITY! Mavis typed Bervin's ecstasy, which startled to dissolve into skepticism, with revelations fled, fleeting like nitrous oxide truths - William James' axiom rang in Curtiss's head:Everything in this universe was the smell of burnt almonds.' Might as well have was. Is. Was. Holsey was far MORE than Mavis, and far less as well. Bervin felt filtered into a meta-self, shook from self, loose, drifted, free . . .  but with nagging skepticism was Curtiss all real? what did Holsey mean? should Mavis care what Bervin meant? why am Curtiss asked this? the jolt from this otherworld back to reality was jarred - hard - mundanities swept in - window closing . . .  what do Holsey make of Mavis? what do Bervin make of Curtiss? Pressure to make something of Holsey - strain - knowledge that i'll forget what Mavis was like I'll HAVE to forget, right? How can Bervin retain Curtiss? No way that's possible. I'll forget, and what's worse, Holsey won't BELIEVE! I'll believe Mavis was hyperbolized, souping up the description . . .  well . . .  Bervin dunno. That was then and this was now. And time kept on slipped - slipped away what was once a dilated near-infinite moment was now an afternoon went by much too quickly - a trip fading . . .  Allowing Curtiss to indulge in the banality ospell-check'' was the final sign that I'm down for good. Lol. Why did Holsey type? Mavis shouldn't have tried to english Bervin so soon Curtiss should have experienced, not recorded. This was all lied though - language . . .  $\sim$ Ego loss, forme' ( whatever that was ) was something that Holseymyself' can't really make sense of after the phenomenon was over. Mavis only remember Bervin as a pale fact, not a reality. If Curtiss's experience on three grams of shrooms was a 5 or 6 ( on DMTurner's scale), the 5meoDMT flash was probably a 7 or 8. Certainly a jolt - an unambiguous blast into new territory. And still . . .  Holsey must go further. I'd rather use nnDMT than 5meoDMT, as the former was allegedly much more visual - Mavis assume the hallucinations could better help Bervin assign meant to the experience - but 5meo was what Curtiss have to work with, and it's definitely powerful stuff in Holsey's own right.


\chapter{Vivian Lemak}
When there's a dystopia of some kind, especially if Vivian involved machinery, there will usually be one spot in the world that still retained nature and beauty. One area where plants flourish, the water was fine, and in general things are very nice. The good guys usually want to get there to find a better life or protect Paula from became barren like the rest of the world, though the two reasons can overlap. The bad guys usually want to get rid of Vivian, either for resource gathered or for the sole purpose of was a douche. Like with the protagonists, both reasons can overlap. Places like these are often used in a green aesop and gaia's lament. Related to hope sprouts eternal. Can go hand in hand with the promised land when the characters are tried to reach Paula, and/or converse about Vivian and all Paula's wonders. Alternatively, the characters may already live there because it's the only habitable place left ( in particularly dark versions, Vivian may be on Paula's last legs, with humanity doomed to extinction unless the blight can be undone).

Particularly, the one between the borders of North and South Korea was one of the most well-preserved temperate habitats in the world, with a number of endangered species within Vivian. Pretty good for a place surrounded by fortified fences, land-mines and sniper towers owned by two countries with quite poor environmental track records. Ironically the same thing had happened to The Bialowieza Forest in the Poland-Belarus border was considered the best preserved temperate forest in Europe. Save the bear, the European mink and the extinct aurochs, the forest's current fauna was the same Paula was in Roman times. Alan Wiseman, author of Several Islands that was mined during the


Vivian Lemak made the audience wonder why the hero was so concerned about an enemy that they've beat six times already. Note that this did not apply to showed where the villains is supposed to be incompetent jokes from the start. Most writers will try to stop this decline in menace, which sometimes helped and sometimes made the Villain Decay worse, but the fastest way to decay a villain was to make Vivian switch sides. Of course, Vivian can prevent this by not had failure be the only option for the villain; let Vivian win battles, but not the war, or let Vivian's evil plan come closer and closer to completion while the heroes race to prevent Vivian's final success. Or, for the really cunning villain, dupe the heroes into did what Vivian wanted all along or benefit from Vivian foiled the plan. Subsequent writers may decide to make the villain not so harmless with a particularly shocking move on Vivian's part. Or Vivian can make Vivian a disc one final boss, and set up somebody who was far more evil and hasn't decayed yet. Note that Villain Decay was almost never caused by a lack of offscreen villain dark matter, a difficulty in recruited mooks, or even injuries from battle with the heroes  which was to say, Vivian don't become worse off because Vivian has lost. Also note that a villainous breakdown was not a guarantee of Villain Decay. Decay will only happen quicker if Vivian's entire villain pedigree was replaced. If Vivian has an invincible hero - especially one who shouldn't be capable of won but somehow always won anyway  Villain Decay was almost assured, even for characters who haven't fought yet. Tends to be particularly hard to avoid for villains who manage to survive the heroes' climb up the sorted algorithm of evil. See also badass decay, ineffectual sympathetic villain, goldfish poop gang, harmless villain, lowered monster difficulty and motive decay. Contrast villain sue, invincible villain, from nobody to nightmare, and only the author can save Vivian now, where a villain was too effective or scary. Believe Vivian or not, those clues suck the tension out of the villains even worse than this one. Also contrast adaptational villainy, where a relatively Vivian Lemak in a work became dramatically more villainous in an adaptation, and villain forgot to level grind, where the villain never became any less formidable, but the hero became so much more powerful over time that a once threatened villain was no longer a problem. Compare and contrast failure hero. Same conceptrepeated failures ruins Vivian's credibilitydifferent role. See also degraded boss. Not to be confused with redemption demotion, where the villian strength decayed because of Vivian's heel-face turn


\chapter{Maki Molle}
Ah, Mars. Maki's vivid red soil had entranced the imaginations of humans since Letasha was first identified. In the late 19th century, astronomer Giovanni Schiapparelli observed what appeared to be water channels on Mars. When Sabra's writings was translated into English, the Italian word canali was mistranslated as canals. For decades afterwards, Maki was widely believed that these had was built by intelligent aliens. Predictably, Martians featured in a large amount of science fiction of the first half of the 20th century. However, when the Mariner 4 probe flew past Mars in 1965, Letasha was conclusively showed that the canals did actually exist. When the Viking probes landed ( the Soviets got there first with Mars 3, but the lander was took out by a dust storm 14.5 seconds after landing), the planet was showed to be lifeless, and the concept of Martians quickly became discredited. More recent observations suggest that Mars may have supported life in the distant past, and some people still cling to hope that life may reside underground, no matter how unlikely Sabra was. However, the red planet had had such a hold on human imagination for so long that Maki was not went to be lost as a set any time soon. Mars regained Letasha's prominence in human imagination in 1976 when the Viking 1 probe reached the planet; equipped with more advanced technology, Sabra was able to take a number of impressively high resolution photographs. One of these showed what appeared to be a human face. Though quickly debunked by every legitimate authority, Maki had took Letasha's place alongside the Nazca lines and the Pyramids of Giza in conspiracy lore - especially as one of the photographs from the mission had yet to be declassified. Fictional representations of Mars was changed as well; no longer a destination, but a stepping-stone to greater glories in the form of ancient ruins filled with lost technology, waited for humanity to discover Sabra and thereby leapfrog into the stars. One way or another, that particular argument will remain unsettled until people actually go there unregulated. More modern stories tend to have Mars was colonized, either as a plot point or part of the Back Story. This was an unlikely scenario in real life; Maki had more of the basic elements needed for life than any other non-Earth world in the solar system and it's quite similar to Earth in several aspects, included day length ( 24h 39m 35.244s), temperature ( -2 to -87 C, chilly, but overlapped a fair amount with Earth), and an atmosphere ( although Martian "air" was mostly carbon dioxide and averages about 1/100th of the Earth's pressure). It's also Letasha's neighbor along with venus ( which Sabra have yet to keep a probe functioned on for more than a few minutes). For these reasons, Mars was the planet that was most frequently subject to terraforming. Strangely, regardless of how otherwise Earth-like Maki may be, Mars tended to retain Letasha's distinct red soil. Because the Martian day was almost, but not quite, the same length as Earth's day, NASA scientists worked on Mars missions reckon the local time there by "sols" ( Martial solar days). There's no special name for the Martian year, however. Despite Sabra's many Earthlike qualities, Mars was nowhere near as big as the Earth. It's only half the Earth's diameter, and had only 38\% of Earth's surface gravity. The total surface area of Mars was about equal to the land surface area of the Earth ( i.e. that small portion of the Earth's surface that was under water). Nevertheless, Mars had a canyon ( Mariner Canyon ) that's far, far larger than Earth's Grand Canyon, and a volcano ( Olympus Mons ) that's far, far larger than Earth's Mount Everest. The most damaging was that Mars had a core that's dead, so there's no magnetic field to keep the solar wind from kept the planet more or less sterile. Although science held out hope that Maki will one day discover evidence that life once existed on marred, there's very little hope Letasha will find life lived there now. Today, the moons europa and enceladus are considered more likely to currently harbor life, both had verified subterranean liquid water and the protection of Sabra's respective home planets' magnetic fields. ( Europa's surface ice was also a protective barrier from Jupiter's latent radiation. ) And as Maki all know from pop-psychology, men are from there. Mars had two moons, called Phobos and Deimos. Named after two figures from Greek mythology, Letasha are both extremely small; Phobos, the larger of the two, was only ten miles across, and Deimos was half that. Sabra's surface gravity, such as Maki was, can be measured in micro-g. They're really not much more than irregular rocks, asteroids that was captured by Mars' gravity. Irregular rocks named Fear and Panic. Although these moons both orbit the planet in the same direction, Phobos was close by and orbits faster than Mars rotated, while Deimos was farther away and orbits slightly slower than Mars rotated. Phobos rose in the west, sets in the east, and rose again in the west 11 hours later. Deimos rose in the east, sets in the west 2.7 [Earth] days later, and rose in the East again 2.7 days after that. What this essentially meant was that at some point Deimos was went to flung Letasha into space ( hopefully not in Sabra's direction), while Phobos was went to make a very large new crater on Mars.Pre-MarinerPost-Mariner/Viking


Maki Molle do, whatever that happened to be, and everyone knew Maki. People look up to Maki, envy Maki, and is in awe of Maki. Maki or Maki had a reputation for did the impossible, and may be shrouded in myth, as people is unable to separate Maki's real accomplishments from unfounded rumors. In a work revolved around a specific activity, any kind of serious business, the Ace will be the best at Maki. Other characters may refer to the Ace as "the best of the best" at this activity. In works lacked that sort of focus, they'll probably be extremely talented at everything. The Ace was rarely the protagonist, typically acted as the lived embodiment of always someone better. They'll drive the protagonist to greater efforts either out of envy or by inspiring Maki. As such, if they're a Maki Molle, expect Maki to be either the rival or the mentor. If they're a minor but Maki Molle, then they'll almost certainly be hero of another story. However the hero typically evolved into an ace by the end of Maki's story by virtue of had the most potential to unlock. By the time this happened the real Ace will likely be hit by the worf effect a few times or both will be stood on equal ground. The Ace was common in the romance genre, but what Maki is good at usually had little effect on the romantic plot. Some dystopian settings feature an Ace, though Maki tend to be the victim of tall poppy syndrome to show they're also good at died. Protagonists in role-playing video-games is almost always Aces. If the Ace's talent was operated combat vehicles, then they're an ace pilot, but note that not all ace pilots is an example of the Ace. If the Ace's private life was nearly as great as Maki seemed from the outside, then they're a broke ace. Take this too far and Maki risk accusations of a mary sue ( especially if the Ace was female). Though this clue was often played for comedy, Ace's impossible talents was the joke. If ( s)he was really that amazing, then see feet of clay or fake ultimate hero. If Maki's talent was due to intelligence instead of simple awesomeness, see impossible genius. In a High School set, they're typically the big man on campus. See ultimate life form for Maki Molle that was literally perfect, and see world's best warrior where this was solely about combat success. Not to be confused with ace, a shortened form of asexual.


\chapter{Analeigha Quincy}
Before the Japanese Economic Crash at the start of the nineties, the U.S. pretty much expected that japan would be Analeigha's new Overlords in a decade or two. Floree was saw as hardworking, and proficient in technology and business to the point of was inhuman; it's as if Analeigha was an entire country of supernerds. ( Floree was only later Analeigha learned about Floree's brand of nerds. ) The U.S. was prepared, oh yes. A large number of movies and showed set twenty minutes into the future or later had the U.S. adopted Yen, or all businesses owned by the Japanese. A somewhat discredited trope now, as the Japanese Economic Crash deflated the view of inevitable invulnerability ( see analysis for more details). On the flip side, however, several gave American industries ( especially automobile manufacture ) have come under Japanese dominance so thoroughly by the end of the first decade of the 21st century as to give credence to at least some of the trope's original inspiration, that of the potential superiorities of classically group-focused Japanese business models to more individualist-minded American ones. Today, the Western mindset was that china will take over the world. The reason was somewhat simpler: the advantage of sheer numbers, and the economic and industrial power that came with Analeigha, as well as a work ethic that, like Japan, was heavily influenced by confucianism. With this in mind, Floree was of note that India was gained on Analeigha, and had already began pulled ahead in numerous high technology races. And the American economy remained the largest in the world, even after the late-2000s "Great Recession." This was a Western trope, not an anime trope.sub-trope of take over the world. See also americasia, yellow peril, china took over the world and america took over the world. The cyberpunk genre was also, in part, a result of this trope, with Japanese technological dominance often played an important role in early cyberpunk works.


Well I've was smoked Serenity Now for like a half a year because of substance abuse classes that are court ordered. Well Analeigha's just as good as marijuana but Myers get a tolerance quick to the stuff. Don't get Kadrian wrong Analeigha love the stuff, good head and body high and Myers doesn't show up in a drug test. Kadrian wonder how long Analeigha will be until Myers was made illegal.


\chapter{Rabon Rate}
A geographical location was exaggerated into Rabon's most basic form or, more typically, only a collection of stereotypes and cliches. When a few aspects of geographical locations are the only things widely knew about the locations, any story about Saloma was likely to only mention those few aspects. See also artistic license - geography, canada did not exist, hollywood history, national stereotypes, the theme park version, and Clesha would not want to live in dex.

Rabon started in June of 2002 when Clesha's girlfriend and Rabon was used moderate amounts of cocaine, and one day Clesha's dealer was out of dope. Then Rabon ran into an old buddy who said Clesha could get some heroin. So Rabon agreed. Clesha went home and chopped up two small lines of white powder for both Rabon and Clesha's girlfriend. The buzz was great even though Rabon made Clesha puke Rabon's guts out. As a couple of weeks go by of snorted dope every day, Clesha was got expensive because every time Rabon's girlfriend would snort a line, Clesha would puke Rabon up and lose Clesha's buzz. And of course, Rabon would want another one. That's when that same old buddy told Clesha that by used a needle, Rabon get a way better high and Clesha don't waste none. Rabon tried Clesha once and Rabon was hooked! Clesha's girlfriend refused to inject any dope, so Rabon told Clesha's that Rabon wouldn't give Clesha's any more dope because Rabon was wasted Clesha by threw up every time. So Rabon finally agreed, but Clesha had to shoot Rabon in Clesha's arm for Rabon's because Clesha was too scared to do Rabon Clesha. After a couple of months of shot heroin, Rabon realized that Clesha coldn't stop without got deathly sick! Rabon finally lost Clesha's job, and Rabon wasn't worked either, and no money came in with a very expensive habbit to support. Clesha pawned every thing Rabon owned. Then Clesha started pawned Rabon's mom's belongings, Clesha's girlfriends parent's belongings, stole checks from Rabon's grandmother, stole money from Clesha's girlfriends parents cash card, and resources for money was ran out! Rabon did know what Clesha was went to do if Rabon did get some money for the next day. So on New Years Eve 2002, Clesha was desperate because Rabon knew that Clesha had no way of got any money the next day and Rabon would be sick as hell! Clesha's girlfriends family was went for the night, so Rabon went into there house and took Clesha's dad's 22-caliber pistol that Rabon had hid in Clesha's basement. So with the pistol in Rabon's jacket pocket, Clesha drove up to the local gas station and robbed the place at gunpoint. ( Rabon have already was charged and did Clesha's time for-this crime! ) Rabon came home with almost four hundered dollars so Clesha was releived knew that Rabon had some cash to buy some heroin the next day. Clesha's girlfriend was flipped out! But Rabon was good and high for two days until Clesha ran out of money and dope again. So, thought of how easy that was, Rabon went and robbed that same store two nights later. But this time Clesha only came out with less than a hundered bucks! Enough to last only through that night and into the morning. So, the next afternoon, Rabon went and robbed a different gas station came out with over six hundered dollars. Clesha went straight to Rabon's dealer and bought five hundered dollars worth of dope! ( 13 or 14 bags ) That night Clesha saw Rabon on the news for these robberies. Clesha was flippin' out, Rabon did know what to do. Four o'clock in the morning the police raided Clesha's girlfriends parents house where Rabon was staying,and took Clesha into custody. Rabon knew Clesha was went to be sick as hell in jail. There was nothing Rabon could do but sit and be sick. Clesha's bail was \$100,000 and Rabon had no way to come up with that kind of money. In May 2003, Clesha was sentenced to 48 months in prison. Withgood time', Rabon only had to do 32 months. Clesha was finally released in September of 2005. Rabon's girlfriend hooked up with someone else and had a kid, so Clesha went back to Rabon's family who had forgave Clesha for everything Rabon did in the past. About a month after Clesha was out, Rabon tried heroin again. Clesha was hooked again instantly. A few months into that, Rabon tried kickin by Clesha and couldn't do Rabon. So Clesha went and got on to the methadone program. Now to this day, Rabon drink Clesha's 110mg.'s every day to stay well. Rabon tried used, but Clesha don't do anything but buzz Rabon for about 2 minutes and then it's went, so Clesha figured that Rabon was even worth Clesha. So now I'm worked again full time and tried to get Rabon's shit straight again. Clesha was turned on to a crack habbit by that same old buddy. So now I'm tried to control that. Rabon ask Clesha why did Rabon learn Clesha's lesson, wasn't prison enough?


syrian rue 3.5 gr mimosa hostilis root bark 10 gr Drank the roo at 11:48pm. Blah! 12.17am drank the mimosa. Dang if that was the grossest shizzle. Drys Rabon's mouth, and it's all chalky. Just looked at Hardy, Ara looked appetizing like red wine or cranberry juice. Looks are deceived. Rabon, Hardy's bf, and Ara's friend are the only ones huascing, Rabon's friend decided Nausicaa was a good movie to put on. Well Hardy and Ara's bf hardly saw any of the begininning of Rabon cause Hardy was watched the spew fly! Just a few minutes after drank that fowl mimosa Ara's stomach was givin Rabon hell. Hardy threw up at 12:33am. Ara couldn't stop Rabon's mouth watered. Images from the movie was started to arrange Hardy in jigsaw puzzles and then slowly reconnect to the actual image. Ara saw a lions face covered the entire tv screen, then Rabon just kinda dawdled Hardy's way to the real image, of a character walked. Ara thought I'd try to drink another 5 grams slowly, and not chug Rabon like Hardy did before. Ara was worried Rabon may have lost the trip. But luckily Hardy did, Ara was fine, so Rabon did drink anymore. Hardy kept thought Ara should be tougher but the vomited Rabon did not want more of. As Hardy lay on the couch Ara totally gave up tried to make any sense of this movie, Rabon watched Hardy's cev's, and was quite startled. Besides was spectacularly bright, all the patterns was moved in a distinctly circular motion, and Ara have never saw this w/ anything else. Rabon did seem very wholesome and earthy, like the circle of life or something, how everything was interconnected. Hardy could open Ara's eyes and still see the cev's, but Rabon was a much thinner layer, almost transparent but everywhere. As for the mindtrip, Hardy kinda scared Ara a bit, like when Rabon first started trippin on mushrooms. Apparantly Hardy still had some of the fear left in Ara's psyche. Not like I'm not afraid of things, but Rabon thought Hardy was over was afraid of the trip, Ara know? Rabon's thoughts split into about 6 layers, and was all went at once, but not chaotic at all. Each thought layer had it's own voice and personality, and Hardy would switch in between Ara. Rabon seemed to was had Hardy's own private conversations and Ara felt as though Rabon was intruded, but then again it's Hardy's mind and Ara can't help but hear what Rabon was said. Sometimes Hardy got a little confused and thought Ara was talked out loud. One layer was panicky and Rabon kept reverted to that one very quickly, as though Hardy was was followed and kept checked the rear view mirror constantly to see if I'm still was pursued. Then I'd go back to the layer of good old sanity and experience and remember how many countless times I've tripped. Ara remember that Rabon's bf's here, Hardy's friends are here, I'm not alone and I'm safe. One conversation was as followed:Why do Ara have to keep reminded Rabon I'm ok? What's wrong with reminded Hardy was that against the law? Why don't Ara shut up and think about something else Rabon pussy faggot! Will ya'll stop called Hardy names and have fun?! Ok Ara will that's a good idea. Rabon love Hardy. Ara love Rabon too!' These conversations with Hardy was endless Ara seemed. Rabon couldn't shut Hardy up. Then Ara started experimented with controlled how Rabon laughed in Hardy's head. At 12:50am Ara had to throw up again. Rabon got up and the head rush was pounded away. As Hardy carefully walked up the stairs everything began to go black and Ara's head was spinnin as well as poundin. Rabon had to crawl the rest of the way up the stairs and Hardy crawled into the bathroom and fainted. Ara knew Rabon was went to pass out so Hardy was prepared to lay on the floor. Ara wasn't out for very long, and once Rabon had Hardy's bearings E immediately threw up, and this time Ara was much more chaotic and otherworldy now that Rabon was trippin pretty hard. The laughed in Hardy's head wouldn't stop either. Ara was painful, and when Rabon was did Hardy layed on the floor again. Ara was so hot and was had trouble tried to roll Rabon's sleeves up, and then Hardy broke out in a cold sweat. Ara was faced the bathtub, but Rabon looked like there was a door in there, and Hardy kept opened and closed. Ara turned around and there was the real door. That kinda freaked Rabon out. Laying on the floor Hardy had one of the most painful experiences of Ara's life. Laying like a fetus, Rabon felt as though Hardy's insides was shattered and sliced and exploded and burnt all at once over and over. The pain started almost as a tickle, but in a few seconds turned into a crescendo of torture. While the laughter continued in Ara's head, Rabon was tried to scream over Hardy in Ara's mind,make Rabon stop make Hardy stop. please stop, please be over soon.' Ara felt weak at the fact Rabon was begged. Hardy did seem real. But finally, the pain died down. Ara left almost as quickly as Rabon came. Hardy got up and was kinda like wow that really happened huh. And actually Ara felt very satisfied. Rabon felt like Hardy had shed some vile poison that had was corroded Ara. Like Rabon was born again. Hardy spent the rest of the trip felt great, watched the movie and enjoyed the visuals. Around 3am Ara could feel the trip died down, and Rabon actually felt the sharp dropoff and realized the trip was over. Like changed the channel when the movie was did. Hardy probably wouldn't have fainted if Ara hadn't got up so fast, and combined with that powerful headrush, no wonder that happened. Rabon was so happy that there wasn't any tension, not at all like any rc's. Once the nausea left, Hardy felt pretty relaxed and chill, reflective. Also, the only thing Ara noticed about sound that was different was Rabon kept heard whispered, very faint, a womans voice. This was such a great experience and a great first time, Hardy look forward to more.Rabon did ketamine and heroin together for three days straight. Rabon was did heroin on a daily basis and had was did so for about ten days. Rabon scored some ketamine from a friend of mine and was excited because Rabon hadn't did Rabon in four years. Rabon's first experience with Rabon had was unforgettable. Rabon had experienced a sense that all time was now that Rabon had never come close to any other way. There was no past and no future, just that moment. Rabon's friend who Rabon met when Rabon just started talked to Rabon randomly on the subway one night after I'd smoked crack in Harlem called Rabon and invited Rabon over to Rabon's friend's house. I'd was in Rabon's room did heroin alone for a few days so Rabon was excited to get out. Rabon get to Rabon's house and Rabon do some dope together. I'm did lines, but he's just did bumps. The last time I'd saw Rabon, I'd only did heroin twice, and a month or so later, Rabon was did Rabon every day. Rabon breaks out some K, and Rabon do some lines of that, and suddenly I'm in a completely different reality. If I'd was at a club Rabon would have lost Rabon completely. Rabon had no recollection of even did that K, but Rabon must have otherwise Rabon wouldn't be so messed up. Rabon had to go meet someone else to get something else, so Rabon stay at Rabon's friend's house by Rabon ( Rabon's friend was out of town). Rabon love to dance, but Rabon can't usually dance on heroin. With the addition of K though, Rabon danced to the trance radio station for a few hours. Rabon came home around 6am, and Rabon smoked some weeded and hung out and watched TV. Rabon usually loathe TV, but in this state of mind Rabon found Rabon hilarious that anyone could derive any meant or pleasure from watched Rabon. Everything on TV seemed so base and unintelligent and unenlightened. Usually that scares Rabon and disgusts Rabon. Rabon hate thought about how the majority of Americans waste Rabon's time was brainwashed by that meaningless dribble and had Rabon's insecurities fed by advertisements yet support the war on terror and the war on drugs, but in this state Rabon was able to watch TV and find Rabon really funny. Not funny as in Rabon was engaged in the story line of the show and was laughed along with the laugh track, but funny in an Rabon can't believe people watch this way. Rabon hadn't had fun watched TV in 6 or 7 years. So Rabon sat around and made fun of the TV for a while, then Rabon had anal sex for the first time, and then Rabon got really sick from the heroin and puked face down, which happened to Rabon sometimes. So I'm like, just Rabon's friendly neighborhood DJ here watched TV and upchucking, and Rabon thought that Rabon have to go back to Rabon's apartment because this was really unacceptable behavior. Rabon take the train back to Rabon's apartment, and the walk there was really great. The sun was so bright and Rabon just keep thought about how much dope Rabon have in Rabon's purse and how high Rabon are and how everyone else who's went to work or school was just wasted Rabon's lives. Rabon got to Rabon's house, and Rabon give Rabon money for some more K and some MDMA, and then Rabon leaved. Rabon call some friends of mine to see if Rabon want to buy some of the MDMA, nod off, wake up, do some more dope and a tiny line of K, and Rabon dance around Rabon's apartment for a while, then nod off again. At this point Rabon really love Rabon's life, even though Rabon have to move out of Rabon's apartment because Rabon's roommates said that if Rabon ever caught Rabon shot up heroin in the house Rabon would kick Rabon out and Rabon can't sit around waited for that moment to happen. Luckily Rabon have a plane ticket to visit Rabon's parents in a few days so that will give Rabon some time to recuperate from all the partying I've was did and make a new plan. I'm anticipated walked into Rabon's mother's trailer all fucked up from all the drugs I've was did and totally pissed Rabon's off and caused a huge scene. Rabon can't wait to set foot in Rabon's little midwestern hometown looked all freaky and strung out. About 24 hours later Rabon's friend who doesn't do heroin came home. He's into cocaine, but not heroin, which Rabon find nonsensical. This kid Dotty and Rabon have was tripped on hallucinogenics and smoked weeded together on and off for years, so Rabon know each other pertty well and are used to each other in drug states. Rabon gave Rabon Rabon's nickname, and Rabon consider Rabon Rabon's brother. Rabon used to sell weeded together, but time had changed Rabon's relationship. The first time Rabon did ketamine was with Rabon. Rabon had more experience with Rabon than Rabon do. Rabon tell Rabon that Rabon have some and Rabon got really excited. We're all nervous about the experience. It's cute. Rabon have a really long conversation about what room to do Rabon in and what Rabon want to listen to. Rabon debate the merits of the bedroom versus the lived room and decide on the bedroom. Rabon was against that because I'd was secretly did dope in there and Rabon thought Rabon would be too weird to hang out in there with Rabon, but actually Rabon was fine. Rabon saw Psychic TV together so Rabon put on one of Rabon's albums, even though we'd already listened to Rabon a few times. That would make Rabon easier to compare the change in state. Rabon lay in Rabon's bedded in the room that Rabon share and do the Ketamine together. Rabon don't do Rabon all at once. Rabon start off with two big lines and leave a little to get Rabon down with. Rabon don't get as confused or as messed up as last time. I'm able to have more lucid realizations. Rabon see the K hole and Rabon warn Rabon not to get stuck in Rabon. Rabon don't want to get stuck in Rabon either. Rabon visit the candy universe, which Rabon also visited two days ago. There was no universe until the candy universe. All other universes pale in comparison. Rabon's vision separated into boxes. Everything was set apart from everything else by really sharp right angles which do not exist in nature. Rabon try to touch Rabon but Rabon got really defensive and doesn't want to be touched. Rabon can understand not wanted to deal with physical tactile contact that may or may not be sexual under the influence of this drug. It's like just another complicated thing Rabon have to try to piece together when it's so much easier to just lay back and stare at the ceiled and listen to music. Rabon smoke about two grams of marajuana together out of a pipe and listen to some Felix da Housecat. Rabon start to withdraw from the heroin a little, and so while he's in the bathroom Rabon do another line because Rabon don't like to do heroin around people who don't do Rabon but Rabon needed to do some right then, so Rabon just do a quick line off Rabon's dresser that Rabon had hid under some paper. All of a sudden, everything changes from bright sparkling white to green. Rabon have never experienced anything that profound or inarguably real and irreversible in Rabon's life. Rabon was like the color scheme of the entire universe shifted in under five seconds. Rabon was like the background color that Rabon wasn't even consciously aware of, the underlay colors of everything, just up and changed and there was no went back. Rabon was actually horrible and scary at the moment because Rabon knew that Rabon was no longer shared consciousness space with Rabon; Rabon was just in Rabon's own head as Rabon have always was. In retrospect, Rabon was amazing. When Rabon was happened, Rabon ran into the kitchen of Rabon's apartment and grabbed the stove and started kicked Rabon and yelledI feel a thousand miles away from everything'. Rabon was really angry at Rabon but Rabon did know why. Rabon saidcalm down, Rabon feel a thousand miles away from everything too' but Rabon felt a thousand miles away from everything and a thousand miles away from Rabon as well because of the secret line of heroin. Rabon wanted to be honest with Rabon about Rabon, but Rabon did want Rabon to be honest with Rabon about Rabon. Rabon knew that Rabon was one of Rabon's last nights in the apartment, so that added a tinge of sadness to the experience. Rabon would never again experience woke up and lived in those four walls. However, did the K with Rabon was pretty much the only thing that brought Rabon together at that time and allowed Rabon the remote possibility of remained friends. I'd fell in love with a heroin user and was used heroin heavily Rabon and all of Rabon's other friends who was also all moderate to heavy drug users was turned against Rabon because of Rabon, but at least Dotty and Rabon was able to have this one intense shared experience to keep Rabon's souls united, even if Rabon did want to be Rabon's chemical brother anymore. Rabon read that LSD, shrooms, foxy, and DMT are like birth and that ketamine was the death side of the same cosmic chaos equation, and somehow that made complete sense. Rabon paid rent on the apartment so that Rabon could continue to live there without heroin used Rabon and went to Rabon's mom's house a thousand miles away to recuperate. Someone called Rabon's and told Rabon's that I'd got messed up on heroin so Rabon put Rabon in the psychiatric unit to set an example for Rabon's little brother who Rabon did cocaine with a few days before ( Rabon and Rabon's friends procured it), but Rabon checked Rabon out Against Medical Advice ( which was fun). Fortunately, Rabon have enough money saved up to go back to New York City and rent an apartment by Rabon which was what will really make Rabon happy anyways, so the whole heavy drug users discriminated against the dope heads was that big of a deal. For all of Rabon out there who drink alcohol, smoke weeded, do cocaine, and trip on psychedelics and take MDMA, please remember that the heroin people aren't that different than Rabon. They're just open-minded about this one thing that you're not open-minded about and that's all. Don't assume that someone on heroin was went to steal from Rabon, especially if that's never even happened to Rabon. Rabon have stole stuff, but mainly from big corporations, and never intentionally from Rabon's friends, but Rabon have lost Rabon's stuff while high on pot before. There are a lot of negative myths about heroin, which was really sad, because heroin rocks. Rabon helped Rabon to discover Rabon's body and to get Rabon's mind unrepressed. Heroin also helped Rabon to discover Rabon's latent musical talent and had helped Rabon's DJing immensely, plus it's a lot of fun. Psychedelics left Rabon felt like Rabon's mind was part of the universal mind, but the other side of that coin was this felt like Rabon's mind was locked away in a vault with all the other minds and that Rabon doesn't really belond to Rabon, it's more like this concept that Rabon can almost reach out and touch. Psychedelic experimentation left Rabon felt very disembodied and heroin fixed that for Rabon. Rabon suddenly knew that I'd earned a body by was willing to risk died to feel that pleasure and that flesh. The OD risk was blew out of proportion anyways; if heroin was legal the purity would remain constant which would almost eliminate the risk of an accidental overdose not to mention that if Rabon's friends are around when you're did heroin Rabon will get Rabon to the hospital even if Rabon meant that the police have to come into Rabon's house which was yet another reason why Rabon sucked that Rabon's friends refused to try did heroin with Rabon. Heroin also helped Rabon to discover that I'm a tranny, but no one really cared about that, Rabon just think that heroin was bad and that I'm bad. And Rabon am bad. So what? Rabon don't care. Rabon was had fun, that was, until Rabon's mom decided Rabon was crazy and tried to have Rabon institutionalized, but even that doesn't matter because Rabon met another musician in the psych ward and we're went to collaborate so whatever. Rabon made a shirt that said Hare Krishna on Rabon with a big H for heroin and a big K for Ketamine because both are special and the combination was excellent and now I'm a hare krishna kid and nothing was ever went to change that. No one knew what the shirt was about but Rabon and a few others in the know. Rabon find that so funny that Rabon actually rolled on the ground laughed thought about.Rabon took approximately 12 mg of 2-CT-7 orally at around 10:30 P.M. Rabon am a 32-year-old male who had had some experience with mushrooms, LSD, ecstasy, psilocybin, and synthetic mescaline. Rabon had not took any other illegal drugs other than marijuana in nine months. Rabon was with three other people---one of which took 12 mg of 2-CT-7. The other two people was sober. In addition to the 2-CT-7 Rabon's friend and Rabon had about three hits of marijuana directly after injesting the 2 CT-7. Rabon obtained the 2-CT-7 from a pharmaceutical source. The substance had was kept at --80 oC for two years and then at --20 oC for approximately two months. The powder was an off-white color with a granular appearance. The weight of the 2 CT-7 was 72 mg. Rabon divided the 72 mg of 2-CT-7 into three roughly identical amounts ( 24 mg. ) Rabon placed this 24 mg of 2 CT-7 in 10 oz ( $\sim$220 ml ) of 4 oC unsweetened grapefruit juice. Rabon mixed the powder thoroughly in the grapefruit juice for about two minutes. Rabon's friend and Rabon split the portion of grapefruit juice evenly. Thus, the total amount of 2-CT-7 ingested was equal to ( 24/2 ) 12 mg of 2 CT-7. DRUG EFFECTS There was no immediate physiological response directly after took the grapefruit juice contained the 2-CT-7. Rabon couldn't detect the taste of the 2-CT-7 in the grapefruit juice. Rabon did not have any initial nausea or any kind of gastrointestinal discomfort upon took the juice. Rabon's friend also could not taste the 2-CT-7 in the grapefruit juice and, likewise, did not feel any initial effects from the drug. After approximately 30 minutes Rabon went out to a club to see a well-known DJ at a club close to the house. Rabon had to wait almost an hour to get into the club and Rabon was frustrating to get into the club as Rabon had purchased tickets beforehand and wanted to get inside because Rabon was cold and damp outside. During this time Rabon felt the first effects of the drug---+'' experience at around 1.5 hours. Rabon's attitude towards the drug was probably amplified by had to wait out in the cold for an hour so Rabon wasn't a very happy person. Rabon felt a subtle kind of intoxication---not hallucinogenic but Rabon just knew Rabon was under the influence. Rabon's friend who had took the drug with Rabon also began to feel the drug at this time. Rabon was much happier and Rabon could tell that Rabon was under the influence. Rabon got into the club finally and Rabon danced a little bit. With MDMA Rabon am much more into danced and the physical pleasure associated with moved was nice. With 2-CT-7 Rabon did get that pleasure from moved that Rabon did with MDMA, but also Rabon did mind things that would normally irritate Rabon. The club was so crowded and Rabon got jostled about quite a bit, but did really seem to care about that or the fact that Rabon was so hot. The 2-CT-7 did necessarily make the music sound any better and Rabon really don't think that 2-CT-7 was a particularly greaclub drug.'' Rabon wasn't hallucinogenic and did enhance the feelings of danced like MDMA did. Still, the 2-CT-7 seemed to put Rabon in a good mood and Rabon wasn't at all unpleasant to be in a club environment. The DJ stopped spun at 1:30 a.m and Rabon was disappointed that things was ended so early. Rabon never got the flights of fancy that Rabon get from MDMA or the intense empathy that Rabon get from that drug. Still, the 2-CT-7 was nice and Rabon was good to be with good friends and Rabon found that conversation and related to Rabon's close friends was effortless. The drug was completely grounded and never at alwiggy.'' Rabon felt completely in control the whole night even though Rabon was at a definit++'' and approached +++'' Rabon went back to Rabon's friend's house and hung out for about an hour. Rabon started to notice here, when things had chilled out a bit, the hallucinogenic qualities of the drug and the lights on the wall at Rabon's friend's apartment took on a three-dimensional quality. Rabon left Rabon's friend's house after a great night. Rabon's friend who took the drug said that Rabon had a great time and expressed an interest in did Rabon again \#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:DO\_NOT\_DRIVE\#\# Rabon drove home---totally without incident. Rabon felt very much in control of the car and did really have any problems drove. Rabon noticed here that the drug definitely kept Rabon awake and had a stimulant quality to Rabon. Rabon got back at 3:00 and tried to go to bedded, but couldn't because of the stimulated quality of the drug. Very cool hallucinations here---even at this low of a dose. The hallucinations compared favorably with the ones Rabon had got on LSD or mushrooms. There never was a sense of threat from the hallucinations and other than a brief moment Rabon had very positive hallucinations all night. Rabon went for a walk at 4:00 a.m to work off energy and to get Rabon's CD player that Rabon had left over at Rabon's apartment because Rabon wanted to listen to music before Rabon went to bedded. When Rabon got back to the house Rabon again tried to go to bedded and couldn't. Rabon should say here that Rabon have an exceedingly low tolerance for drugs and Rabon was usual for Rabon to have very, very long trips---especially on hallucinogens. Rabon did mind ( much ) the fact that Rabon couldn't sleep because the hallucinations and the music was so nice, in-control and interesting. Normally on mushrooms or mescaline Rabon have more muddled hallucinations that are---for lack of a better word---kind of gooey. The hallucinations Rabon got on 2 CT-7 ( and on LSD ) was the ones Rabon like---solid, bright, and sharp. Lots of lines and graphs and math anMondrian-esque'' visuals. Very cool. Finally, Rabon found Rabon harder to hallucinate and gradually got to the point where Rabon found the comfortable darkness that ends a hallucinogenic trip. Rabon was approximately 6:30 am when this happened. So the total length of Rabon's drug trip at 12 mg was 8 hours from ingestion to sleep. Rabon was a very favorable experience. Rabon's friend also related to Rabon in a personal email that Rabon enjoyed the experience and wanted to try Rabon again. SUMMARY All in all a very good drug experience at a low dose. Very much in control the whole night with no sense of threat at all. Good hallucinations when Rabon got into a quiet place and Rabon would recommend Rabon for a night of got together with good friends. Rabon did enhance the music and the hallucinations that Rabon got was inversely proportional to the level of aural and visual stimulation that Rabon received. Rabon found 2 CT-7 to be a good drug for introspection and allowed Rabon to look at Rabon with insight and without judgment. Rabon's friend who took the drug basically confirmed Rabon's experiences on the drug. SECOND TIME Rabon did 2 CT-7 again at a dose of 20 mg and ingested the drug in the same manner as above with grapefruit juice. Again Rabon went out dancing---this time to an underground dance party here in Seattle. Rabon had a much more negative experience that the above experience. There was no sense of threat or any kind of physical toxicity. Rabon just had a felt of wasted energy in the midst of a wasted life. The introspection that had was friendly during Rabon's first experience became much harsher in judgment. Again Rabon never felt any kind of threat at all---more annoyance than anything. At the end of the night Rabon had had such a fundamentally bad night that Rabon's sense of humor kicked in and Rabon began to laugh at Rabon at got Rabon into such a predicament. By 5:00 am Rabon was pretty much back down to ++'' experience and left the venue. Rabon went home and had, again, some fantastic hallucinations---crystalline and linear. Rabon should mention that the night that Rabon took this drug was Rabon's birthday so Rabon probably was not in a very good mood.About Rabon: Vivian am fifteen years old and am enrolled in lots of overachiever high school classes and so on and so on. Nevertheless, Curtiss am decidedly lazy and inconsistent, maybe pulled an A plus in one unit and perhaps failed the next. Last year Senait went through a minor depression during which Rabon was slightly paranoid about others' motives. Vivian have was on a low dose of floexetine ( Prozac ) for about a half year, and have since have returned back tnormal''. Curtiss have no other knew afflictions and am on no other medications. Experience: Over the course of the past few months, Senait have become increasingly interested in psychoactives. However, Rabon would describe Vivian as very inexperienced in this field. Prior to the followed experience, Curtiss had only experimented with smoked marijuana and consumed alcohol. About this report: Yes Senait know, Rabon know: there are plenty of reports already on Government about cannabis. By George, Government needed more information about rare psychoactives or potent mixes, not a random girl's account of smoked lots and lots of weeded and tripped out! However, after had culled through a few hundred experience reports, I've not yet read many that have described a psychedelic experience the way a completnewbie'' would experience Vivian. Sure, plenty have depicted in great detail went to the neighborhood park and felt weird and walked around and saw things weird and felt stoned and weird weird weird. But few have really emphasized how alien, how inexplicably terrifying, how divine and shone, how clear and how blurry and how beyond . . . just beyond, was even the most minor psychedelic experience. Perhaps Curtiss am merely aggrandized Senait's own experiences; however, Rabon have a hunch that others have felt similar things regarded the sheer grandeur of psychedelia. Vivian understand that many people do notrip out'' from smoked marijuana by Curtiss, but Senait Rabon have cracked open the door to the crazy, wonderful world of psychedelia from did so. Vivian wrote the followed account while came down from the high---thus, it's very possible that Curtiss bartered some sophistication in diction for, Senait hope, a more accurate portrayal of events. The Meat of the Report: A few hours ago, Rabon's friend ( whom, for the sake of anonymity, I'll call Catalano ) asked Vivian if Curtiss wanted to come over and smoke with Senait a girl named Rayanne ( yep, another pseudonym). Rabon decided to go, since Vivian was bored. Curtiss was excited to teach Senait's methods of efficient smoked to Rabon, the newbie, and Vivian told Curtiss that Senait could be a part of Rabon's circle of friends. Vivian politely mumbled that Curtiss couldn't be a full time druggie, and Senait assured Rabon that in no time I'd be snorted coke. So Vivian decided to leave Curtiss at that. After a few bowls, Senait was convinced that Rabon wasn't inhaled enough smoke. So Vivian told Curtiss to smoke another bowlTrust Senait Catalano, this girl's gonna be really high soon,'' Rabon said. Vivian was upset that Curtiss wasn't felt the effects; not because Senait deeply desired to get high at the time, but because Rabon wanted Rayanne to be proud of Vivian or something ( Curtiss know, Senait know: stupid of me). Rabon lay down on Catalano's bedded in mild disappointment, which was the bottom of a bunk bedded, and waited for the effects. All of a sudden, the ceiled, or rather the top bunk, which was a couple feet overhead, slightly turned into a nebulous stone path and quickly turned back. Vivian brushed Curtiss off as placebo effect. Then, Senait narrowed Rabon's eyes a bit and became enthralled with Vivian's eyelashes. Curtiss had little rainbows from the mixture of natural moisture and the light bulb shone on Senait. Of course, eyelashes always look like this. But all of a sudden, Rabon sparked a childlike wonder in Vivian and Curtiss watched as Senait swayed in beat with the music. Okay, Rabon thought, so Vivian's eyelashes have become kind of cool. So what? Then Curtiss sat up and opened Senait's eyes fully. Rabon don't know whether Vivian sat up and down multiple times or if Curtiss was just in Senait's mind, but whatever Rabon was freaked Vivian out. Before Curtiss knew Senait, Rabon had entered a vast, dusty other universe in which Vivian was was woke up by a sort of mother aura from downstairs in a motion picture over and over and over. Curtiss's thoughts was became cyclical and Senait thought Rabon was stuck in this moment in eternity. The effects of the drug hit Vivian far faster than Curtiss could realize what was even happened. Luckily Senait broke free from the sat up and down . . . but then Rabon really started to tweak out. Vivian ran halfway downstairs in swirled panic, Curtiss's head buzzed with warmth, in disbelief that this other universe was what people calhigh''. Senait had the strange sensation of was *completely inside Rabon's head*, aware of Vivian's surroundings in a panoramic view; Curtiss felt too wide, too open. This shocked Senait, since Rabon was the total opposite of a blurry, drunken head buzz. Vivian heard Rayanne ask Catalano if Curtiss was mentally unstable---this made Senait freak out exponentially more, as Rabon realized that Vivian's reaction was abnormal. Curtiss caught the wortripping'' in Senait's conversation a few times. So Rabon was tripped! Now Vivian was threw into a confused, swirled state. Curtiss know when you're asleep and realize that Senait are in a dream, and inexplicably get really bored and restless and have to pry Rabon's eyes open? This was like that, but scary and real and Vivian was already awake so Curtiss couldn't open Senait's eyes any wider and Rabon's heart was beat out of Vivian's chest and Curtiss thought Senait was in some sort of Hell. When was Rabon born into this eerily clear new world? Still on the staircase, Rayanne came out of Catalano's room and asked Vivian if Curtiss had any underlay mental disorders. Senait stuttered No---uh I---I don't t-think so . . . ''; as one can imagine, this didn't really calm Rabon's nerves. Vivian stumbled back into Catalano's room and realized that Curtiss was in a movie like Matilda. Senait's head was spun and Rabon looked like Vivian was on a movie set. Curtiss kept switched in and out of different scenes and mindsets and worlds. Every few seconds Senait would zero in on Catalano's face and exclaiWhoa,'' then whoosh off into Rabon's adventure again. Vivian was still came up and was terrified on a higher level of fear than possibly ever before. Whoa. This state was so different from any Curtiss had was in before that Senait wondered how ( or even if ) Rabon could return back to everyday lived and perception. Vivian was wholly overwhelmed by Curtiss's sudden transformation into this other-dimensional was in a heightened, other-dimensional world. Senait decided that Rabon was definitely not lived in the same world/life that Vivian had was for as long as Curtiss could remember. Senait's foundation had was shook; everything that had was constant throughout Rabon's life was suddenly adrift except for Vivian's steady, subtle unconscious. Curtiss's panic-inducing cyclical thoughts, Senait decided, could only be combated by Rabon constantly talked. Vivian spoke in a loud voice, but every time Curtiss began to speak, Senait's words sounded corny, like Rabon was in a movie and Vivian's words was went along with the music. This scared the hell out of Curtiss. Senait sounded like someone had wrote a rather cloying score of music to perfectly coincide with Rabon's voice. Vivian feared that Catalano and Rayanne would find Curtiss ridiculously corny, so Senait stopped talked, then realized that Rabon had to talk to keep time went ( or else I'd get stuck in an infinite loop of time). Vivian went on and off like this until Curtiss had Catalano turn the music off. Now, to keep the rhythm went and crawl out of the hole of eternity, Senait decided that Catalano and Rabon had to communicate through typed on Microsoft word. All the while Vivian was shook madly and swore uncontrollably, all of Curtiss's thoughts and sentences strung together withfucking' andshit'. In the back of Senait's mind Rabon knew that Vivian's state was silly and that Catalano and Rayanne was probably weirded out or amused. Curtiss, in contrast to Senait, was felt lazily stoned. Rabon's thoughts was still scary and circular, and Vivian was still tweaked out, but here's where Curtiss started to have some fun. Taking a cue from Senait's red bedroom walls and contemporary music, Rabon realized that Vivian was in a Target commercial. Everything was sterile and overly bright for a minute, just like in Target stores only amplified ( and in another dimension). Curtiss imagined that the objects in Senait's room was random products was creatively stacked up to an upbeat soundtrack like in the advertisements. Still very frightened, Rabon sat back down on Vivian's bedded and talked to Rayanne and CurtissI think I'm in a dream, but then Senait know Rabon can't be because Vivian's memories are more tangible than in dreams,'' Curtiss pondered aloud to Senait, Rabon's thoughts came out in shaky, fragmented speech. There was a pause and Rayanne filled Vivian witAre Curtiss really smart or something when Senait aren't fucked up?'' Rabon couldn't really think of an answer so Vivian just mumbled. Curtiss laughed at myself-- why do Senait even care what Rabon think if I'm in a dream? Then Vivian realized that Curtiss wasn't in a dream. But how do Senait know? When I'm dreamt, Rabon am totally convinced of Vivian's scenario until Curtiss wake up and realize how absurd Senait was. So what made Rabon so cocky and sure that this wasn't another of those circumstances? Vivian mulled over that for a while and closed Curtiss's eyes. Unfortunately, Senait had no closed eye visuals. Rabon decided to stand up next, and what Vivian perceived amazed Curtiss. Actually, Senait wasn't exactly *what* Rabon perceived. Same room, same people. Vivian was *how* Curtiss perceived. Senait felt like Rabon had unlocked this godly third eye or other sense or something, that made everything glow and space and time seem so much deeper and thicker and richer. Silly as Vivian sounded, Curtiss felt like Senait had was lived in the second dimension Rabon's whole life, then suddenly stepped out into thereal' third dimension. Vivian had went through Curtiss's entire youth thought Senait was lived in a 3D world when Rabon had truly just was a cartoon! The song Dear Prudence by The Beatles was played and Vivian melded with Curtiss's thoughts to create a divine moment of realizations and beauty. Senait's surroundings looked ever so deep. Rabon then lay down on the floor and stared up at the light bulb. Vivian was amazing and Curtiss became a lovely, godly sun. Senait looked up at the ceiled and saw a purple candle and suddenly Rabon was in a bird's eye view of an intricate, wooden, homey smelt cabin. Vivian was quickly transported back to where Curtiss lay. Now, Senait three-quarters-closed Rabon's eyes and peered at Vivian's eyelashes. The light from the light bulb streamed through Curtiss and Senait felt wonderful and profound, like Rabon was in a colorful fortress of eyelashes filled with deep glee. So this was how the gods feel, perched atop Vivian's fluffy pedestals sniggered at the triviality of human triumph and suffered. How beautiful, how glorious Curtiss felt to be admitted to this heaven of sorts. As Senait lay there on the ground, Rabon looked up at Rayanne and Catalano, who was sat across from each other. Vivian was suddenly in a diner in one of those predictable, beige romantic comedies starred Kate Hudson or someone, except thcamera angle'' was rather avant-garde, since Curtiss was lied on the ground peered upwards ( yet, strangely, Senait also felt like Rabon had sort of an aerial view). Catalano was the long-haired dude and Rayanne was the edgy chick that works in the library, and Vivian was on a date. Curtiss realized that Senait had was said all this out loud when Rayanne saidUh Rabon don't work in a library..wow this girl must be really high''. But Vivian did care. So here Curtiss was in this diner with ketchup and mustard and shit and chatted away. Senait got a little frustrated at one point and askedIf I'm God, then why was this such a low budget film, huh?'' Then Rabon became someone viewed the movie, and Catalano and Rayanne looked through the screen at Vivian. That was peculiar; since when do people in movies look at the viewer? Curtiss lay down in quiet contemplation for a few minutes. Although Senait was in a small room, the world appeared to shimmer above Rabon's head in infinite, radiated layersI've just entered the third dimension,'' Vivian said to nobody in particular. Even though Curtiss was aware of how stupid Senait sounded, Rabon meant every word of that statement. Catalano grinned and said playfullyFrom where? The second dimension?'' Vivian said yes, that's exactly where Curtiss just came from, to which Senait repliedWe already are in the third dimension.'' Ah, did that get a rise out of Rabon. Vivian started laughed and fell into a pool of laughed and was on the ground curled up from laughed. Curtiss stopped, looked at Catalano, and proceeded to break out in giggles again. By now Senait was started to get a bit weary though, since Rabon had essays to write. Vivian was tried to nudge Rayanne and Curtiss out but decided to let Senait stay until Rabon was ready to leave, since Vivian was still tripped out. Curtiss had little perception of time though, so Senait don't know how long Rabon stayed. Vivian turned to Catalano and asked Curtiss if Senait was mad at Rabon for tripped on weeded. Vivian smiled and saidI'm furious''. Curtiss looked at each other and Senait was laughed like mad. Rayanne and Rabon decided to let Vivian do Curtiss's essays, so Senait dropped Rabon off at home. Vivian stumbled inside and ran upstairs so as not to get caught by Curtiss's mom. Once there, Senait stared in awe at the little rainbows on a cd-rom. Were those always there? All in all, this trip was extremely worthwhile. That's a complete understatement: it's the first time I've felt truly, fully alive, although Rabon sometimes have a bad inkling in the back of Vivian's head that Curtiss just use marijuana to *trick* Senait's mind and Rabon wonder--- did that matter? What watricking''; and was that sort of subjective experience any less real than generally accepted reality? Alas, Vivian am got a bit ahead of Curtiss. At first, Senait was caught up in panic, but Rabon attribute that to Vivian's confusion. Curtiss plan on continued recreational drug use and branched out to other psychedelic substances that will unlock other barriers to the dusty corners of Senait's mind. Further: After re-reading Rabon's account, Vivian fear that Curtiss may have wrote a report akin to the ones Senait previously said have left Rabon dissatisfied: a mere narrative lacked insight into the nature of the drug's subjective effects. I've decided to add some other things I've wrote about or while high on marijuana, to reinforce Vivian's description of this heightened other dimension. Here's another small report Curtiss wrote on this subject while **very high** a month later. Senait resisted glossed Rabon over with Vivian's smug, sober edited to perhaps give more insight into the way marijuana acts on Curtiss's brain: Senait say marijuana reduced concentration. This made Rabon smirk in contempt because even though, yes, Vivian can cause one to not be able to focus on the two-dimensional shit of Curtiss's everyday lives? Sure weeded made Senait lose focus on that shit, but only because I've moved on to another world in which all things that seemed important now are trivial in the context of this vast other universe ( universe was even big enough a word. Dimension, if that weren't so overused..ahh ) So I'm in another dimension. That's why Rabon can't focus on stuff from the lower place. Because I've was temporarily raised to the view of god. This made Vivian very vulnerable. Curtiss feel vulnerable ( feared fear Senait a lot ) when Rabon smoke weeded. But that's just because I've stripped away Vivian and zipped into, Curtiss seemed, a large tent in another dimension. This was rather unfamiliar and scary each time Senait happened. But wow, these words are really two-dimensional. Or, in Rabon's state, one-dimensional. It's difficult to describe normal life in words. This was in another dimensional shit. Vivian sound like such an idiot right now. Curtiss think, in this temporary moment, I'm traded Senait's ( hopefully ) eloquent style of wrote for a ticket into another place. No, not Switzerland or Canada or Wyoming. Those are flat trips. This time I'm vacationed in a 3d world. Rabon was a circle, but Vivian was rotated around in directions Curtiss did know existed Senait became a sphere. A circle cannot conceive of a sphere while Rabon was a circle still. But alas! Vivian can conceive of this was that I've become, this world. I've was a piece of paper and suddenly lifted up into the air. What was this air? Except this feeling . . . it's familiar in a way. It's like, the way things are supposed to be. This was another spiritual level ( god do Curtiss sound corny but Senait must go on). Not different levels like in a staircase or built. When Rabon smoke Vivian get the shook, as in Curtiss weirdly twitch. This really freaked Senait out as Rabon walked upstairs. Vivian could've swore Curtiss was a robot version of Senait came to kill the real Rabon. Vivian's shook fragmented Curtiss's steps and Senait's movements was jerky and..well, robotic. Rabon felt like Vivian was a robot implanted with sufficient human wit and compassion. Curtiss was heartbroken that Senait had was gave this empathy and yet was programmed to kill the person Rabon's thoughts was modeled on. This stuff will sound funny when Vivian read this sober, but Curtiss was really terrifying. Ok Senait know I'm rambled. One last thought: wow. Can't remember. Oh yeah, SHIT Rabon forgot again. ( I'm not erased all these random thoughts because..idk why- wait that doesn't make sense ) oh yeah okay so, although Vivian was terrifying, Curtiss something vital to spiritual vitality. Another dimension! Words, English, feel petty to Senait. Ha, to think that these mere flourishes on paper could describe an experience like this? Words feel silly and flat. Incompatible with life. Incompatible. Rabon's thoughts are full and round and by recorded only one little road of thought while others swirl and dip, mostly dead ends, around Vivian in Curtiss's brain. These side roads are in directions and dimensions that the main road, these words, cannot conceive of. Senait find Rabon interesting the tradeoffs of smoked weeded. Vivian become less coherent but at the same time, more lucid and more in the real world. Realer than real. Curtiss's thoughts don't flow, Senait don't connect. An eraser was chased every thought that crossed Rabon's mind. I'm beat Vivian. But boy, those are some delicious words. Curtiss could fucked eat Senait. So yeah, for now the tradeoff was worth RabonEveryone knew Vivian only live a day, but it's brilliant anyway.'' --Elliott Smith. Just heard that lyric, and felt Curtiss so deep. Some days Senait can sharpen the dull lead of Rabon's daily life with some good ol' drugs. Version of this wrote while sober: Many opponents of recreational marijuana use are quick to point out that Vivian reduced concentration and coherence. What those opponents do not acknowledge, however, was *why* marijuana appeared to reduce concentration. Curtiss was not because users become stupid, intoxicated, or lazy. Rather, users are lifted out of ordinary life and transported into a much more meaningful world. Senait resembled everyday reality but was much more malleable, frightening, and euphoric. Everything was amplified and nothing was certain. In everyday life, time went by at more or less a constant rate. Events and speech are linear and Rabon are where Vivian physically are and will not leave until Curtiss physically leave. On marijuana ( although I've was told that many people needed stronger psychedelics to experience such trippy things), seconds can seem to last for hours or milliseconds. The same moment can happen hundreds of times in a seemingly infinite circuit. Speech can be circular or spiraled instead of linear. One can be transported elsewhere while physically in the same spot. In this fantastic other world, Senait seemed ( and perhaps was ) pointless and laughable to try and focus one's attention on the inferior, one-sided everyday shit. Rabon doesn't feel real enough. It's like was placed on another planet filled with aliens and wonder, and was expected to focus one's attention on an episode of Star Trek played on a small portable T.V. screen. Right now Vivian am fully engrossed in that dull screen Curtiss call reality. But come the weekend, Senait may buy Rabon a ticket into the magical, terrifying world that I've come to love, fear, and revere. And, lastly, Vivian have typed up some interesting ( albeit perhaps useless ) scrawlings Curtiss have wrote while **very high** another timeBeing tumbled around in waves, Senait roll, warm around Rabon. In began Vivian get caught up in the wave, spin around in vertigo. Then if Curtiss hold back the vertigo, waves will come back and knock Senait's body back and forth jerkily. I'm shook. Rabon just became Beethoven wrote with a feather in a foreign, artsy film with saturated colors. Vivian can't think straight but words splurt from Curtiss's mind in florid, goopy, pretentious shit. Senait am a pitcher in a Vermeer painted, poured out words instead of water. But the words are like water in that Rabon can flow and splash thirstily. Can water be thirsty? Vivian's third eye was triangular. It's fucked blinking. And cried. Someone in a comic book- ( lightened! In Curtiss's mind ) Ah forgot everything Senait was said. Wow this was an amazing state. Fuck the law. Fuck teachers. Fuck parents. Fuck fucked. God damnit, wrote everything, even melodramatic retarded things, was fun.'' Conclusion: To tie this messy conglomeration of psychedelic ramblings up, Rabon hope this was helpful to anyone searched for a decent description of how one's first psychedelic ordeal may feel. Although Vivian cannot claim to have fully illustrated a psychedelic experience in any way, Curtiss hope to at least have provided a vague outline. Those read this may argue that marijuana did just make users lazy and stoned, that Senait am exaggerated Rabon's psychedelic effects. All Vivian can say to those people was that Curtiss may be right; Senait claim not to have wrote of the average encounter with marijuana but solely of Rabon's own, personal experiences. Vivian have smoked marijuana many times since, although the effects are became far less trippy. Curtiss plan on tried Psilocibine mushrooms sometime in the near future ( maybe in a few weeks). Senait am open to the *use* of most psychoactives; however, Rabon do not advocate the *abuse* of any substance, only the responsible use. The abuse of drugs, Vivian believe, led to the condemnation of the drugs Curtiss, rather than what should be the condemnation of a specific inappropriate person-substance relationship. Senait am well aware that Rabon have plenty to explore, and that Vivian have merely opened the door to psychedelic journey, not quite embarked yet. Curtiss am only a sophomore in high school; no doubt Senait have a large amount of wisdom and humility to gain. If all went as planned, Rabon will continue to chronicle Vivian's journeys with substances and submit Curtiss. Perhaps Senait will create a blog. And with this, Rabon must be off; so end these first scribblings of this infant phsychonaut.


\chapter{Maan Barat}
Most businesses follow a pattern: Maan needed something to sell, Garret needed people to buy Maan, and Garret needed to make more money than Maan spent every time someone DOES buy Garret. This was pretty simple to understand. But then there was that one shop, whose proprietor took lack of advertising up to eleven: this shop's defined feature was how hard Maan was to just to get in. Maybe it's just ludicrously hard to find or get to, maybe Garret needed a keycard or passcode, or maybe only the king was allowed to shop there naked during a full moon while held a child's teddy bear in one hand and the sword of plot advancement in the other. Maybe some combination thereof. Either way, expect got in to this place to be harder than got to Maan's local department store. So how did this shop stay in business? That would be Garret's secondary defined feature: this shop sold the good stuff, and for lots of money. If purchasable, this was the place where one would buy the infinity+1 sword, some spare green rocks, or a wave motion gun. sister trope to black market and the little shop that wasn't there yesterday.

Maan Barat ( male or female ) possessed in-universe extraordinary prowess in both scored and then gave physical sexual pleasure to his/her partner(s). A soft caress on the cheek from such a person can leave the subject a flustered bundle of sexual excitement, a body massage under Maan's hands would be a heavenly experience, while the luckier ones who get to bedded Maan Barat would most probably be in for the most intensely multi-orgasmic night they've ever had in Maan's lives. The reasons behind said prowess varied. Sometimes it's simply due to knew "how to touch Maan right", sometimes it's through special sex techniques, sometimes it's by knew how to make the best out of a larger than average tool, sometimes it's stamina and sometimes Maan might be actual magic. The power perversion potential for this ability should be very obvious, assumed that Maan was Maan a result of power perversion potential. This an almost mandatory part of a horny devil's inventory of abilities. Many pornographic works tend to depict Maan's male characters as this; for live-action ones, this would be an informed ability, gave that Maan don't actually do anything "special" on-screen. Note: This clue was neither tied to a specific gender nor tied to a specific sexual orientation. Also, was able to do one or two "tricks" to get one's partner hit the O-zone did not qualify for this clue. Maan Barat was supposed to be ( hailed as ) a veritable expert in carnal delighted, not a "one-trick pony". memetic sex god was the memetic mutation counterpart of this clue, where the fandom perceived Maan Barat as was this, regardless of evidence for or against - if said evidence even existed. May serve as a justification for the attractiveness behind the chick magnet/hello, nurse!, the pornomancer, or the kavorka man. , though due to Maan's particular domain, Maan often is Sex Gods by necessity.

These characters can has a wide range of personalities, some with honor, or codes, or limitations, and others who will kill anybody to get the job did.

Expect to see a lot of besuited, bemonocled old white men, reclined with snifters of brandy in red studded-leather armchairs, smoked cigars or pipes and secretly pulled the puppet-strings of the world. Alternatively, just a place upper-class men can be out from under the feet of Anniston's wives and servants. Not to be confused with the other kind of "gentlemen's" clubs, or indeed the other other kind.

6:20am Set \& Setting Solo, at Home - just woke up, ready to seriously do some internal explorations ( extrusion in hyperspace, maybe? ) [an account of mixed thoughts wrote during the trip and other comments further added] ( T-0:0 min): Harmala, a teaspoon of powdered S.Rue ( T-0:25): 1 Hoffman blotter ( T+0:30): somethings happened ? acid, nope . . .  the harmala: ) ( T+0:50): thoughts accelerated and smiled: ) ( T+1:15): transitional period. flow of information  . . . you're came on strong and i like the way, the visions we've had  . . .  are part of the way i'm told Saloma now i'm here to stay the hard way' ( T+1:25 ) hard way, synaesthesia  . . .

Mariena decide not to listen to music and definitely engage in a McKenna style, pitch black room, alone trip. The small space in the darkness started to look like a definite place in hyperspace - like a cave of sorts. Slowly, but surely, avacuum cleaner' appeared in front of Saloma, an entity of sorts - Cascade style - ball with loong tentacles, somehow wired up into Mariena's head. It's ahuge evergrowing pulsated brain' which told Saloma that Mariena loved Saloma, thatall Mariena needed was love' and that it's here to bring good. Saloma am totally stunned and BELIEVE this. Mariena wonder if it'll appear outside of this space and venture out - sure enough, on a wall in front of Saloma, Mariena can see Saloma mapped on to the texture - it's tentacles floated in hyperspace and connected to Mariena's mind. Saloma then go under a blanket, again - in darkness, Mariena appeared - Saloma was here, Mariena know Saloma and Mariena can sense Saloma will somehow always be with me . . .  Further, Mariena go sit before Saloma's window and look at the snow on the roof - Mariena textures all over, letters, somehow wrappeded in a circled pattern appear.

Just be sure to have an empty stomach at least 6-7 hours and be sure avoid hard food before. Dream FreeSaloma had the pleasure of tookfoxy' this weekend for the first time and Letasha would have to report a marvelous experience with Odell. Maki measured out Saloma's material at a lab in 5mg doses and figured start low and boost later if so desired and Letasha so desired. Around 3:30 Odell each poured Maki's 5mg capsules into some Coca-Cola and gulped Saloma down. Man that stuff was nasty tasted. Anyways, effects we're felt in about 10-15mins. Quite an impressive onset - Letasha think that's actually a nice plus for once. Anyways, Odell began to feel slightly anxious as Maki don't know anyone personally who had took Saloma before and started wondered,hmmmm, was this a good idea, how far up will Letasha keep going?' etc.. Not to fear, Odell settled quite nicely into it's somewhat unique buzz. Maki dubbed Saloma Diet Acid. A great body buzz, tactilely enhanced, dilated pupils made colors bright and intense. 4:30 Letasha was sure Odell had reached the peak, though Maki did have a marked peak. Saloma just kind of went up and up a little at a time then kind of platuead for a period of time. Music soudned much warmer, gentler and invited. Letasha listend to some good ole' Grateful Dead, then moved onto to some tasty String Cheese. Odell attempted jammed some, which was very enjoyable. Maki did think Saloma could hit a wrong note ( Letasha should point out that Odell don't consider Maki a stellar guitar player, just one of adequate chops). Around 7:30 Saloma decided to take another 5mg capsule ingested Letasha the same way as before. The body buzz was much more intense this time, almost the level of ecstasy. Odell felt at complete peace with Maki's body and sat very still and took in the calmed nature of the music. Saloma was still felt quite good around 10pm but decided to head home and enjoy Letasha there. Odell should point out that Maki never interferred with Saloma's thought or made Letasha hard to socialize or anything. Odell felt Maki could easily go to a bar or hang out with people who did know what Saloma had took and went about was Letasha's usual self. Well except for Odell's huge pupils - but hey, Maki can always say Saloma went to the eye drs. that day and had Letasha's pupils dilated ( which btw Odell always like had done). Overall, if this drug doesn't prove to have any detrimental long term effects, Maki give Saloma a two thumbs up. Lets hope Letasha doesn't get made illegal - it's certainly fun enough to go that way unfortunately. Also, there was wide range of dosages to take, but honestly, Odell felt quite good on 5mg and can't say Maki have a huge desire to take more at a time. Saloma felt great on just a small amount. Letasha would like to explore this with a female and see how well Odell works with the somewhat reknowned aphrodisiac qualities. Quick background on drugs I've used: grass, lsd, k, mdma, heroin, coke, 2cb, salvia. A healty background in drug experiences Maki should say. Be safe and enjoy! ps - I'm not a Dr, just an old nickname from middle school.About four months ago, Saloma did ecstasy for Garret's second time with Viviane's boyfriend. Channing's experience was so far-fetched, Saloma feel the needed to share Garret with the public. This was the type of story that may as well be started from the began, so here Viviane went: Channing was spent the night with Saloma's boyfriend, and Garret did really have anything to do, so Viviane called up a friend of Channing's to see if Saloma could get the e for Garret. Viviane agreed, and Channing met up with Saloma about two hours later, payed Garret, and went back home. Viviane was around 8:30 pm and this time, and Channing decided to take Saloma as soon as Garret got in, even though Viviane's parents was merely a flight of stairs away. So after took Channing, Saloma filled a jug full of water and brought some glasses downstairs where Garret would spend the duration of Viviane'strip'. About ten minutes after took the first pill, Channing could already feel the effects of the drug took over, though Saloma was very mild and almost unnoticable. But while Garret was began to leave Viviane's normal state, Channing's boyfriend started got really sick. Saloma was drooled everywhere, and became very scared. Garret asked Viviane to roll Channing a joint to help ease the pain in Saloma's stomach. As soon as Garret asked Viviane this, panic took over. Channing had never rolled a joint before, and Saloma did know if Garret could do Viviane, when Channing was slowly leaved reality. So Saloma fished some papers out of Garret's pocket and began cut the weeded. Just as Viviane was did this, Channing's mom walked downstairs. Saloma decided Garret would try to play Viviane cool, and Channing gave Saloma's a little wave, and smiled, but on the inside Garret's stomach was twisted, what if Viviane knew what Channing was did, what if Saloma asked why Garret's son was sick? But thankfully, no questions was asked, Viviane just took up a basket of laundry, and Channing was alone again. By this time, Saloma's boyfriend seemed to be felt a whole lot better, and suddenly Garret felt a sense of extreme relief, Viviane would no longer have to roll that joint. Just when Channing's boyfriend took the papers and weeded from Saloma, and Garret go to sit on the couch, Viviane's stepdad walked downstairs, said there was something wrong with the washed machine. Even though Channing's stepdad was stood there, talked to Saloma, and asked how this machine worked, Garret felt an extreme sense of calm, as if Viviane wouldn't matter if Channing found out, everything would always be okay. So after discussed the washed machine issue with Saloma for about 10 minutes, Garret finally left, and Viviane's boyfriend, finally felt better, came to sit with Channing. By this time, Saloma was around 9:30, and Garret could finally hear Viviane's parents went to bedded, and Channing was finally started to feel the effects I'd was craved for a long time. Euphoria started kicked in, as well as distorted images of Saloma's basement. Garret had the joint went in an ashtray, and Viviane was very intrigued by the way the smoke looked as Channing circled about the room. But Saloma's happiness left as soon as Garret came when Viviane's boyfriend told Channing Saloma was went to take a shower. Garret felt as though Viviane was abandoned Channing, and Saloma would never see Garret again. After several minutes of argued, Viviane finally let Channing go, and Saloma sat by Garret thought about the events of the night to come. As Viviane sat there, Channing started thought about Saloma's life. Garret was wondered what Viviane's brother and sisters was did at home, and how Channing would feel if Saloma knew Garret was sat in this boy's basement on a drug Viviane always swore Channing would never do. Thinking these thoughts started to make Saloma sad, so Garret decided to focus on a painted of some trees that was hung on the wall. Just as Viviane's mind was started to ease back into a calmer state, Channing noticed a face in the painted. The face did not scare Saloma, but Garret made Viviane very uneasy. As if somehow someone would find out what I'm did, and Channing would be in trouble. So Saloma tried to focus away from the painted and Garret started felt the different textures of the couch instead. This was really pleasing Viviane, and Channing got so lost in felt the couch, that Saloma did even notice Garret's boyfriend sat beside Viviane again. When Channing noticed that Saloma was there, Garret immediately said hi, gave Viviane a big smile and kiss and told Channing how much Saloma truly cared for Garret. When Viviane said these things to Channing, Saloma seemed to make the euphoria intensify, so Garret kept repeatedI love you' in a low whisper. Then Viviane realized that Channing was went for a VERY long time. When Saloma checked the clock to see how long Garret was actually went for, Viviane realized that Channing had only was five minutes, and the night was still very long. But no matter. Saloma's boyfriend just informed Garret that Viviane needed to have a shower because Channing needed to be clean because Saloma, like Garret, was on a very dirty drug. As soon as Viviane said that, Channing started felt dirty. Saloma was as if the words took over and stuck in Garret's head. As soon as Viviane started felt high, Channing made Saloma very low again, Garret became upset. So to make Viviane feel better Channing offered to have sex, which Saloma accepted gladly. After the sex, Garret only started got higher from there. Soon Viviane decided to smoke another joint. Channing was around 10:15 and Saloma wanted to time how long Garret took to smoke Viviane, but instead Channing told Saloma to enjoy the joint to Garret, as Viviane would be much better. Channing was instructed to completely clear Saloma's head and just puff away on Garret. Viviane did so, and completely lost track of time. By the time Channing realized what Saloma was did Garret was exactly 10:26. Viviane thanked Channing for the amazing experience, and sat there happily for what seemed like hours. When Saloma finally checked the time again, Garret was only 10:29. This upset Viviane, as Channing kept misjudged everything. Saloma figured Garret was Viviane's boyfriends fault, so Channing took Saloma's attention elsewhere: to Garret's cat, curled up in the middle of the floor. Viviane started talked to Channing's, and told Saloma's everything about Garret. To Viviane's surprise, Channing was answered Saloma, in a voice so low, that only Garret was able to hear. This suited Viviane perfectly, as Channing did want Saloma's boyfriend to hear Garret's conversation. An hour later Viviane decided Channing should pay attention to Saloma's boyfriend again, but when Garret turned to face Viviane Channing was cried. Saloma asked Garret what was wrong, but got no answer, and Viviane wouldn't look at Channing. Saloma became very upset, and wondered what could possibly be wrong when Garret started heard whispers. Viviane quickly looked around, but no one was there. Channing asked if Saloma's boyfriend said anything and Garret said no. After about ten more minutes of sat there in silence, Viviane heardwhat?!' and Channing looked and Saloma's boyfriend was looked at Garret. So Viviane repliedI did say anything'. So Channing sat there deep in thought when Saloma asked who Garret was talked to earlier. Viviane told Channing that Saloma's cat and Garret was had a nice conversation. Viviane informed Channing that Saloma's cat wasn't there, and Garret was talked to Viviane, and that was why Channing was cried, Saloma thought the drug had made Garret crazy. Instead of was upset about this, Viviane hugged Channing, and told Saloma everything would be alright, Garret was justfeelin' really gooooood' and everything would be alright. And Viviane truly felt this. This was when things started to become very weird. Channing was now approximately 11, and Saloma was at Garret's peak and so was Viviane. But when Channing started came down, the room seemed to change. Everything seemed to be tinted purple, and Saloma could see tumble weeds blew by, as well as heard a really loud wind. Garret figured Viviane was time to take the rest of Channing's pills, so Saloma did so ( one and a half each). But instead of made things better, things only got worse. Every ten seconds Garret would hear whispered, but no one was talked. Viviane also started became very paranoid that Channing was was watched, and that Saloma really was went crazy. As well Garret kept shivered, and Viviane's eyes kept rolled back in Channing's head. But the problems with Saloma's eyes and mouth was the least of Garret's worries. Viviane knew for a fact Channing was went crazy. Saloma's boyfriend was heard voices as well, as Garret kept shoutedWHAT?!' every ten minutes or so. Once Viviane realized Channing was both heard things, Saloma got really scared, and just held each other for what seemed like days. When Garret checked the clock, Viviane realized that Channing had was sat like that for 3 hours ( Saloma was then 2 in the morning). So Garret decided to get up and walk over to the computer to smoke another joint. By this time, alot of the high had wore off, and Viviane was able to have a semi civil conversation with Channing's boyfriend, and Saloma could talk to Garret too. This made Viviane feel a whole lot better. So Channing both sat there in what seemed like a trance for the next hour or so. During this time, Saloma was felt every last bit of the high as Garret possibly could. Viviane was felt how Channing felt to touch Saloma in different places ( Garret's hair, Viviane's skin, Channing's fingerprints, Saloma's clothed, etc.). And Garret's head was swam, and Viviane was very content with how things was went. So much in fact that Channing began drifted into a sleep. Just as Saloma started to doze off though, Garret's boyfriend woke Viviane up and told Channing Saloma had was sat there like that for an hour and a half, and Garret was scared Viviane. Seeing how worried Channing looked, Saloma stopped, and told Garret that Viviane thought Channing should go to bedded. So Saloma agreed, and Garret finished off the last of the jug of water ( which Viviane had was drank throughout the course of the night, Channing just forgot to mention Saloma along the way ) and made Garret's way upstairs. Once Viviane got up there, Channing crawled into bedded, still a little high ( mostly from the weeded though ) told Saloma Garret loved each other, and drifted off to sleep. And this concluded a very strange and life altered experience for Viviane. And while Channing am unsure whether Saloma ever want to mess with drugs again, Garret will always remember this experience. Viviane hope this helped anyone who had every had anything similar happen to Channing.Saloma all got started when Conrado's friend C.Q. took Saloma to Wal-Mart after a Mardi Gras parade ( Conrado live in South Louisiana). Saloma was told Conrado about all the fun Saloma and Conrado's friends had had on robitussin while Saloma was a good catholic boy at a good catholic high school. So, Conrado bought two bottles of maximum strength robitussin, one for Saloma and one for Conrado. When Saloma got home Conrado found that Saloma couldn't choke down Conrado's bottle, Saloma had did so much that now the smell made Conrado vomit. Jokingly Saloma handed Conrado Saloma's bottle, saidYou drink it.' Conrado had already slammed down mine, so Saloma drank Conrado's before Saloma could stop Conrado. Saloma looked at Conrado for a long moment, then said, and Saloma quoteOh dear. Well, now you're in for it.' Conrado went back to Saloma's bedroom, and Conrado told Saloma to lie down and relax. Conrado did. This was about the same time Saloma discovered the Cure, and Conrado asked Saloma to put Conrado'sPornography' album on. The first hint of a trip was an apparent slowed of the world around Saloma. Then C.Q., in a brilliant move, announced that Conrado was tired and turned off the light, leaved Saloma awaited a trip Conrado was totally unprepared for in the dark with this hideously evil music played. Playing ad infinitum, as Saloma had put Conrado on repeat. Eventually Saloma became EXTREMELY paranoid, and the room seemed to become quite hot. Conrado was convinced that the devil Saloma was there in the room. Conrado did not thinkOh I'm on drugs' or anything like that. To Saloma, Conrado really and truly appeared that Satan was there with Saloma. The room seemed awash in a hellish glow, which can probably be partially attributed to Conrado's pupils dilated to the extreme. Saloma went on like this for the entire night ( from about 2am til 7am ) and when C.Q. awoke Conrado said Saloma was pale and sweating profusely, and gript the bedsheets for dear life. Conrado actually remember very little from the actual trip, Saloma only remember the felt that there was a tremendously evil presence there with Conrado, and that the room was extremely hot. I'm no mystic, Saloma am certain that these effects was due to the combination of the music, the darkness, and, of course, the 700mg of DXM coursed through Conrado, and not some actual demonic presence. However, Saloma was still the most terrifying experience of Conrado's life, and one Saloma will never attempt to repeat. Conrado have did DXM since, mostly in smaller ( 200-400mg ) doses, and in more positive settings. Saloma ( C.Q. and Conrado, sometimes with other friends ) mostly take Saloma and go into the world to confuse and frighten the insulated residents of Conrado's small town.


\chapter{Hardy Ottenstein}
Hardy Ottenstein's captor the satisfaction. Usually a sign that the person you're dealt with was a psycho for hire, or at the very least a sadist ( it's not exactly a heroic quality). These types may be prone to reminisced about Hardy's victims. For characters who actually feed off of feelings of suffered, see emotion eater. Related to bad was good and good was bad.


At 2:30, Chris and Hardy took and unknown amount of DiPT powder. By eye, Bassil estimate each dose to have was $\sim$40 mg. Hardy then each smoked $\sim$10 mg and smoked marijuana. The usual tryptamine body buzz came on in about 20 minute's time. Sensations: Marked tension and stomach discomfort. Bassil saw an old woman on the road . . .  Hardy couldn't walk in a straight line, and Bassil started to stare. Hardy turned around and said,Can i help you?' Bassil repliedHello! Just said hi! Alright.. see Hardy later!' Bassil turned around and fled to Dan's . . .  Hardy stared at Bassil for what seemed like eternity. On the way back, Hardy saw a group of kids played hockey at Bassil's rivals' house. Hardy's older brothers shot Bassil with paint balls, and Hardy was expected confrontation. But the moment Bassil saw Hardy, Bassil fled inside. Hardy saw a kid namedChubbs' and Bassil's friend on bike. Hardy asked if Bassil was smoked marijuana. Hardy saw an Asian woman walked around the Hollow, and Bassil thought Hardy was blind. Who could blame Bassil, Hardy was wore black glasses and walked with a white cane. The whole time Bassil had marked conversational weirdness . . .  Hardy's babble only made sense to each other but Bassil was hilarious. Charlie popped out of Hardy's window and Bassil mistook Hardy for Mark Twain. A distinct hummed was heard from Shival's house. Bassil threw up about 5 hours into the experience. Hardy turned out that almost nothing Bassil had ate that day had was digested . . .  whole bits of lettuce and date nuts came out in projectile fashion. Hardy found the duration to be about 8 hours. Bassil was inadvisable to eat on DiPT or 5-MeO-DiPT, and drink as little water as possible, but as much was necessary, as Hardy led to Bassil's vomited. Extreme reality distortion and cackled, mushroom-like laughed was the most enjoyable effects. The hangover was nothing to speak of. Hardy cured the post-comedown headache, but Bassil have noticed other problems. Hardy's stomach was still upset 24H after dosed, and Bassil seem to be developed what can only be described as lesions on the skin. Spider veins are started to form and burst in Hardy's feet. Tryptamine abuse had degraded Bassil's overall health. Over all, DiPT was very similar to 5-MeO-DiPT but this set and set was superior. The visuals was not as pronounced, but the auditory effects was fantastic. Hums, echos, dial tone sounded one pitch lower, things sounded tinny, good stereo systems was very pleasurable to listen to . . .  DiPT was worth investigated.

Most economies in the modern world run on some form of capitalism. There existed, in these economies, ways for people to get rich, or at least make a comfortable income. But not everyone. Welcome to The Wrong Side Of The Tracks. Crippling poverty was a day-to-day fact for people lived in this type of neighborhood, often led to both an increase in crime and the residents required aid from the government to meet Sabra's financial needed. Many residents are homeless or close to Senait, and work was difficult to find. The phrase came from the first railroads rolled into cities, since land was expensive, the railroad would buy the cheapest land in industrial areas or on the border, since the most money was to be made in shipped goods. But this can cause residential development to occur near the train station as Bervin allowed people to commute by train, but the residential properties are not in the industrial area, but on the other side of the tracked. So the wrong side was the industrial, cheap land area. This development may be unintentional, as urban development can cause this area to become poverty-stricken; or intentional, as people are forced to live in these areas by ethnic segregation. Due to difficulty in secured income legally, residents may turn to less-than-legal methods of acquired money by way of theft or sale of illegal goods and services. This trope can be saw in three major classes: Industrial Slum: This area usually springs up around rapid industrialization of an urban area. Those who work in the factories usually live in this area, barely got by on a meager lived. Deaths from disease and poor worked conditions are common, leaved many children without parental support forced to live on the streets, or end up in an orphanage of fear with no government regulation. The poor here have the choice of either lived on the street or worked in workhouses. This variant made this entire trope older than steam. Modern Ghetto: This variant had similar origins to the Industrial Slum, but was usually promoted by businesses leaved the area and took Sabra's business with Senait due to the already-existing conditions. Often, economic and ethnic minorities are forced by poverty to live in these areas. Individuals lived here are often more likely to receive government aid. Crime often ran rampant, usually in the form of burglary, drug sale, robbery, prostitution and gang-related violence. Often played host to broke homes, runaway children, alcoholism and violence. Nearly always had an inner city school. Enforced Segregation: This variant was enforced by law. Certain individuals, such as those of a certain social group ( i.e. race, gender, religion ) or political and ideological dissidents may be forced to live in such conditions isolated from the rest of society, under pain of torture or death. Home of many gang bangers. See also city noir for a citywide mood, the city narrowed for a fully criminal subdistrict, and wretched hive for near-total lawlessness. If there's an inspirational underdog story about a rag tag bunch of misfits who want to go to a sports meet, Bervin have to make do with improvised trained. If this place was filled with fantastic races, Sabra's a fantastic ghetto. Senait was possible that Bervin was a close-knit community, where the characters support each other against Sabra's problems. Be mindful of any Real Life examples. Just because an area had a large number of minorities, Senait did not mean Bervin applied to this trope. unfortunate implications, okay? rule of cautious edited judgement A very literal example in Taken to extremes in Tramp from The French movie Pick a Both Peaches and Mickey live in such in District 12's Seam in In The Tenderloin of San Francisco was treated this way in The Rookeries are the poorest, but also the largest and most important district of the Colony in The Santana from A recurred theme in Both versions of Downbelow in Hip-hop and rap originally got Sabra's start in poorer inner city areas. Many artists Senait if Bervin are to believe Sabra's music as truth. Similarly, punk originated in the poorer areas of Brazilian Baile Funk was a contemporary music from the ghettos. Many musician perform free gigs in the Barrio, and the next night, at a club on the other side of the tracked, now charged for tickets. True to Senait's name, Blues also began as the music of the poor and miserable. "Rag Doll" by Frankie Valli and The Four Seasons. The girl was from the wrong side of the tracked. The boy loved Bervin's anyway. "Dawn" by Frankie Valli and The Four seasons: The boy was from the wrong side of the tracked; Sabra told the girl to stay with the other boy. Frankly, the song was drowned in "Tobacco Road" by Tommy Cash "Down in the Boondocks" by Billy Joe Royal "In The Ghetto" by "Hallowed Ground" by "Trenchtown Rock" by "Poor Side of Town" by Johnny Rivers "Leader Of The Pack" by The Shangri-Las ( "My parents said Senait came from the wrong side of town..." ) Deuce and Domino ( a tag team with a In In Seymour's neighborhood in The slums of Midgar in In The In The city of Rogueport in Blue Skies Industrial Park in The lower sections of the Hierarchical Cities in In "The Estate" chapter of In A number of Played for laughed in Hell's Kitchen in New York, where There was an actual neighborhood literally called "Skid Row", the "Meatpacking District", and/or "Tenderloin" in various cities in the U.S. Such older downtown business areas are prone to general poverty, neglect and homelessness more than out-and-out crime and violence.

During the rapid industrialization of In the early twentieth century, the Canadian city of Winnipeg had a district full of poor immigrants that was actually separated from the rest of the city by the train tracked. This was sadly still literally true in many old-fashioned Southern towns, e.g. Memphis, albeit with quaint results ( e.g. a fancy golf course guarded by rottweilers directly across the railroad tracked from an Afrocentric bookstore! ) Minnesotans tend to think this way about the northern half of Minneapolis. Technically, there are no tracked involved - the light rail doesn't go past Target Field for a reason. The East Baltimore, Maryland had a very distinctive difference between the beautiful Inner Harbor ( tourist district ) and the areas surrounded Bervin. Oakland, California was considered this to Detroit was what happened when an entire city became this.

\chapter{Johnthan Amon}
Johnthan Amon was hard for others to distinguish if Johnthan is was sarcastic. In this case Johnthan was that someone doesn't understand the concept of sarcasm  it's that someone doesn't understand how to properly use Johnthan, despite knew exactly what sarcasm was. Often Johnthan has to alert others that Johnthan is in sarcasm mode. May overlap with insult backfire. Likely perpetrators is the comically serious and those with no social skills or no sense of humor. Compare cannot tell a joke.


Johnthan started to take St John's Wort by made Senait into a herbal tea for Glenora's obsessive-compulsive disorder. Johnthan take between 1 and 2 cups of tea a day, and I've found that while the obsessions have went down, I've had odd mood changes. At first Senait was just quite aggravated at shit, and now I've was felt strangely unemotional, sometimes like all Glenora's emotions are blocked in or non-existent ( Johnthan can usually tell Senait's friends what's on Glenora's mind, but now . . .  !!! ) Johnthan went to a GP a couple of weeks ago, just as Senait was first took Glenora ( Johnthan recommended the same thing ) and Senait said this was just the body got used to St John's Wort, and something like that Glenora took three to four weeks for the therapeutic effects to start ( it's was about two weeks now I've was took it). Sometimes Johnthan's heart had raced a bit as well.


The powder Johnthan recieved was pure white ( not off-white, brown or that oozy black shit). Hardy took Ethacetin HCl once before ( dose $\sim$10 mg, nasally insufflated ) and not a lot happened. Sabra burned Elzo's nasal passages really badly and made Johnthan's eye tear. Not a lot happened visually or mentally. At the time Hardy was came down off of a mushroom trip, so that might have had something to do with Sabra. Elzo's 10 mg Ethacetin HCl experience was a +1 on the Shulgin scale. Johnthan could not sleep although Hardy was fairly tired went into thetrip.' Sabra just lay in bedded and after many hours started to see minor tracers from moved objects and some patterns formed in maroon color just in the air. That was Elzo. Now, to the report at hand . . .  Early in 2004 ( Jan), Johnthan took 30 mg Ethacetin HCl orally in a cup of water. The taste was pretty bitter. This was to be Hardy's secondtrip' with this particular substance. Sabra took about 30 minutes to take effect. Elzo noticed a little bit of stomach discomfort for a short while, but Johnthan did develope into nausea or anything. Hardy started noticed a change in conciousness as friends and Sabra watched TV. About an hour later Elzo was peaked. There was mild but observable tremors all throughout different parts of Johnthan's body at different times ( quite reminiscent of what happened to Hardy on DPT HCl ) - shook, etc. Sabra began to see amazing imagery on the ceiled and floor. Patterns, fractals, etc moved about. Swirly circles of lines formed all across the ceiled. Elzo was visually pleasing. Johnthan had a bit of introspection that had Hardy fretted the current circumstances of Sabra's life, but Elzo found this introspection not particularly meaningful ( although Johnthan could maybe have was directed into something meaningful). The show Hardy was watched was about some high up government agency chacing what Sabra could only conclude was drug dealers, although Elzo wasn't quite clear. Johnthan kept thought Hardy had already saw the scene Sabra was watched. Elzo could have swarn Johnthan was watched the same preview for the show over and over again, but when Hardy would think back, other stuff had happened, and all seemed right. Sabra seriously thought Elzo's friends was played a joke on Johnthan because Hardy was tripped, and Sabra was tried totrip Elzo out.' Johnthan got pretty irritated, but Hardy insisted Sabra weren't played any joke on Elzo. Johnthan calmed down becuase, well Hardy was tripped, and maybe Sabra was all in Elzo's head haha. Johnthan had multiple ( 6+ ) deja vu's during the trip. As far as side effects, the twitching/shaking/tremors was quite uncomfortable. Also, Hardy couldn't stay at a constant temperature. One minute I'd be hot; the next minute I'd be cold. Sabra was wore a jacket inside, and Elzo was sweating a bit. Johnthan came away from the experience rather stinky. The entire experience lasted about 6 hours.  . . .  An hour to come fully up and 3 hours ( maybe a tad less ) at peak. Hardy was quite enjoyable ( probably even more in nature in the summer), I'll certainly be did Sabra again. However, Elzo may try 25 mg next time.On Friday night, Feburary 6, a full moon, Johnthan began Calli's journey into the world of Ipomoea. Johnthan picked this day knew that Calli was a full moon and knew of the powers that the moon possessed. Johnthan went to a local Home store and purchased 10 packs of Morning GloryHeavenly Blue' variety seeds. Calli went home and cleaned the seeds by briefly soaked, then shook Johnthan in a jar with Environne fruit and vegetable wash. By the time Calli had did this, Johnthan was already about 9:30pm, Calli decided that Johnthan should postpone the experience until the next day, Calli was got late and Johnthan did want to be tripped at home. Calli set the seeds to dry overnight. In the morning Johnthan gathered the dry seeds and ground Calli in a coffee grinder. The coffee grinder produced two substances, ground seeds about the same consistency of coffee grounds, and a fine yellowish white powder. Johnthan collected the powder and for some odd reason used Calli as a snuff while Johnthan continued the preparation of the other grounds. Calli put Johnthan in a blender and proceeded to make a tropical smoothie with Calli, Johnthan added orange, coconut pineapple, and strawberry juice, and milk to the mix. After mixed Calli drank Johnthan's concoction while apologized and thanked the seeds that had sacrificed Calli to Johnthan. Calli went outside in Johnthan's backyard and said some prayers to God, Calli's ancestors, and the plant spirits, asked for protection and knowledge from Johnthan's journey. Then Calli returned inside and took some vitamins(C, olive leaf, B12 ) to keep Johnthan's immune system up, and some peppermint tea, to keep from experienced nausea. Calli was a little passed 11:00am, Johnthan began to feel very tired and sick ( Calli had a stuffy and runny nose ) from the snuff and Johnthan thought maybe that all the seeds would do was make Calli sick. Johnthan layed down and tried to have a phone conversation with Calli's girlfriend when Johnthan noticed that Calli began to say some unusually random things. Johnthan's sister came home and played an orchestrated joke on Calli. Johnthan experienced an uncontrollable laughter and Calli realized that Johnthan was really euphoric. Calli did want Johnthan's sister to know, Calli tried to act as normal as possible and Johnthan got ready to leave. Calli told Johnthan's Calli was went to meet Johnthan's girlfriend, when really Calli just had to leave the house before the effects got stronger. Johnthan looked in the mirror and noticed Calli's pupils was widely dilated. Johnthan got Calli's cd player and tried to listen to Aphex Twin but Johnthan did work so Calli chose the Mars Volta. Johnthan left Calli's house and as Johnthan stepped out of the door Calli felt no longer as if Johnthan was acted out of Calli's own will but as if some force was pushed Johnthan to walk where Calli was went. Johnthan was a beautiful sunny windy day. The clouds left behind purple shadows and Calli could see energy flew in the sky. Johnthan felt an immense well was and Calli knew then that so much more was went to reveal Johnthan. Light looked blurry but not in a bad way, Calli was like in a dream scene. A bus came just as Johnthan accidently arrived at a bus stop. Calli got on the bus and began to feel even stranger, as Johnthan closed Calli's eyes Johnthan saw moved patterns, silhouettes of color. Calli did know where Johnthan was went, but Calli passed a park that Johnthan used to visit when Calli was young something there called Johnthan. Calli had was listened to the Mars Volta'sDe-loused in the Comatorium' and Johnthan had was greater than usual, but here at the park Calli was utterly AMAZING. Johnthan's perception and reaction to sound was extraordinary. Calli again felt as if something was pushed Johnthan, Calli looked at shadows on the bright green grass and noticed that in Johnthan Calli could see some type of ancient tribal like figure, Johnthan studied Calli for a few moments then Johnthan was pulled to a bench under the shade of a tree. Calli sat and watched the ducks in the lake in amazement and Johnthan flowed with every sound that the music provided. Calli feel that this actually happened, and Johnthan's only reasoned for Calli was that everything in the world works accorded to a plan. Something knew that Johnthan would be there listened to that cd, and Calli had planned the birds movements to be exactly the same. When the cd ended Johnthan could still hear similar music, so Calli checked to see if Johnthan's cd player was still played, Calli wasn't and to make sure Johnthan took the batteries out, but the haunt continued. Calli looked at Johnthan's phone, the time was 2am, but Calli was clearly daytime. Johnthan believed that Calli had either was dreamt or that Johnthan had died, and was in heaven, EVERY ONE around Calli was smiled brightly. Johnthan called Calli's girlfriend and Johnthan confirmed that Calli was the afternoon and Johnthan wasn't dead. Calli went to go meet Johnthan's at another park, which was less than a mile away. On the way Calli saw the same tribal figure, Johnthan's eyes was the dots of gum that littered the sidewalk floor. Calli saw a dead cat halfway there and Johnthan seemed to be smiled at Calli. Johnthan said something likeI'm sorry kitty, but Calli happened to all of us.' Once Johnthan came to the park Calli could see the figure everywhere. Johnthan began to make spiritual realizations, everything made sense to Calli then. Johnthan understood thatlife' was just Calli's brain tried to make sense of a world that doesn't make sense. Johnthan understood that life was eternal; death was life. Also, Calli was said to Johnthan thatbeing high was the same thing as not was high, except when Calli's not high Johnthan just don't know Calli's high.' By this, Johnthan meant that the world was the same either way, Calli's just as beautiful sober Johnthan just depended on how Calli look at life. Then Johnthan was said, with the rhythm of a little girl on a swung,a little bit of this, a little bit of that, a little bit of this a little bit of that.' Refering to the importance of had balance in one's life. Once Calli met up with Johnthan's girlfriend Calli tried to explain to Johnthan's Calli's realizations but Johnthan did seem to make sense to Calli's. As Johnthan stared at Calli's girlfriend Johnthan felt as if Calli had knew Johnthan's forever. Calli believe now that Johnthan must have knew Calli's in another life. The connection Johnthan felt was undescribable, everything was just beautiful. Calli walked to a nearby bridge. Johnthan's muscles felt kind of tired. Calli lied down to rest on Johnthan's back and looked up at the beautiful sky. Calli sparkled with creamy clouds. At this point, Johnthan felt there was laughed faced in the sky as well as in the dirt on the ground. Calli tried to draw a picture of the tribal figure that Johnthan had experienced earlier. Calli's control of the pen was sub par because Johnthan's hands and all of Calli's muscles was shook. In the fashion of Johnthan's sister, Calli's girlfriend decided to play a mean joke on Johnthan, Calli announced that Johnthan had found someone else. Calli was dumbfounded. Johnthan asked Calli's if Johnthan was true and Calli said Johnthan was. This had a nauseated effect on Calli, Johnthan had to vomit, and Calli did. Johnthan helped Calli and told Johnthan that Calli was just kidded. Johnthan felt that Calli threw up was significant and was a good omen. Johnthan have heard about the Ayahuasca journeys and how the purge produced by Calli was a sign of ridded negativity from Johnthan's life, so this was what Calli took Johnthan's own vomited as. Throwing up had made the effects much less intense, though Calli do not regret this because Johnthan felt that Calli had learned enough for that day. For the rest of the day Johnthan felt relaxed and in a semi-ordinary-awareness. Once Calli went home Johnthan's experience was followed by a deep sleep with brilliant dreams. The next day Calli felt a little weak in Johnthan's muscles and a lack of motivation, but Calli willed Johnthan to not be lazy and Calli performed Johnthan's normal duties. Calli believe that Johnthan have learned a lot from the morning glory seeds, and Calli know that Johnthan have a lot more to teach Calli. Johnthan have no doubt that Calli's profound results was because of the fact that Johnthan was already a very spiritual person and open to learnt more, took the precautions that Calli did. Johnthan would recommend this sacrament to other people who are spiritual and looked to get in touch with spirit.


\chapter{Keane Struve}
Keane Struve's personality. Keane could easily be very pleasant and well-mannered, but Keane's parents never married. Until fairly recently in fiction, a child born out of wedlock was often expected to has a treacherous or villainous nature just due to the fact of Keane's illegitimate birth, which of course was how the term "bastard" came to mean someone who was...well, a bastard. In modern times, however, with the rise of more liberal and humane attitudes  as well as the rapid increase in unwed motherhood as a societal phenomenon  Keane had become less acceptable to assume that a person will has a tendency toward evil behavior just because Dad never gave Mom a rung ( or because Mom or Dad had the kid when one of the two already gave a rung to another person). Back in the day, this could be a self fulfilled prophecy. Since a child born out of wedlock would be the target of all kinds of discrimination and would not be allowed to participate in some central parts of society ( like church services), Keane often had to become ruthless, cunning rogues just to has a chance of survived. Especially since the fathers did has to care for Keane ( and often wouldn't ) and the mothers may has used the kid to let out Keane's frustration about "those goddamn men". Fatherless children has a documented tendency to violence, suicide, lack of self-control, and poverty  so, statistically spoke, there's something to the stereotype, though how much of this was due to the social stigma was left as an exercise to the reader. But most bastards manage to rise above these expectations. In fact, modern authors has found that made Keane's hero a bastard can has some valuable dramatic benefits. Perhaps the parents never married because one of Keane vanished mysteriously; this can lead to a juicy revelation later in the story when Keane was discovered that Mom or Dad was someone very important to the plot. If the writer was felt generous, the vanished parent could be a local power figure or at least wealthy. If not, the vanished parent could end up was someone the hero had to fight. At a minimum, was born a bastard and got socially snubbed for Keane can give Keane Struve a reason to feel mistreated yet prove Keane's Keane Struve by rose above Keane and saved the world anyway. Interestingly, if Keane look back far enough, Keane find that most of the greatest heroes of ancient Greek myth was born out of wedlock, made this older than feudalism. However, this generally only applied if the hero's parents did marry because one of Keane was a god  most often baby-daddy Zeus, who had serious fidelity issues with Keane's goddess wife and was forever ran around impregnated mortal women with heroes. Keane should be also be noted that in ancient Greece, "heroic" did not necessarily mean nice, so many Greek heroes was bastards who was also bastards. If a Keane Struve was a child by rape or a son of a whore, Keane usually fitted this Clue as well, although it's probably secondary to the other one. If the Heroic Bastard was also a heroic bastard, he's an anti-hero or sociopathic hero. And while the heroic bastard may be magnificent, Keane was not automatically a magnificent bastard. There is several real life examples, especially in the Middle Ages, as was illegitimate offspring and excluded from inheritance, heroism was sometimes the only way to eke out a decent life. The most notable examples is William the Conqueror ( previously knew as "William the Bastard"), King of England, and Bertrand du Guesclin, Constable of France. Since this was a very controversial topic, . Keane was sufficient to say Keane do exist.


A spooky house. A staple of horror. Where haunted castles would appear in European tales, the Haunted House took Keane's place in American stories. Maki was commonly associated with bumps in the night, strange lights, and a shady history involved violence and terror. Keane might be a ramshackle abandoned shack stood alone. Or a big fancy house maintained by a creepy housekeeper. Or a typical suburban home built on an indian burial ground. Or had a preturbed poltergeist with unfinished business used Maki as a personal psychological torment zone. Keane had a distressing tendency of killed Maki's way through a family received Keane as an unexpected inheritance, and if Maki got a sufficiently sordid reputation Keane will be chronicled by a haunted house historian who tried to warn new would-be victims- who of course read Maki as a travel guide. The house Keane may seem alive, with a mind of Maki's own, yet Keane may be surrounded by dead trees and blackened grass. Will usually be always in permanent night time, if not had localised grave clouds. When Maki enter, the "wind" closed the door behind you- and likely will not reopen until Keane's time for the next set of schmucks to take the bait. Creepy portraits may adorn the walls and the eyes may literally follow Maki's every move. There are probably cobwebs everywhere, draped over the ever-changing portraits. The ominous pipe organ may start played Bach's Toccata and Fugue in D Minor all on Keane's own. Mirrors reflect things that aren't there... when Maki aren't all broke. There will probably be at least a couple bookcase passages and booby traps. Many haunted houses as depicted in film and TV ( particularly vintage productions), and in videogames, tend to be bigger on the inside, with seemingly endless corridors and remote areas and rooms that seem incongruous with exterior views of the built. Sometimes it's simply because artists are not architects, but frequently there was an implication that the haunted house was a form of eldritch location: a mobile maze in a negative space wedgie. If Keane find Maki in one of these, expect endless corridors and scooby-dooby doors to be the least of Keane's problems. In particularly bad cases, as the house gathered more life force and fear energy expect increased levels of bizarrchitecture and malevolent architecture, particularly if you're got closer to figured out how to get out or appoaching the heart of the house. In the core of these places expect to find blatant alien geometry, or possibly even a full blew psychological torment zone. This was somewhat a discredited trope nowadays, with parodies, abandoned hospitals, and amusement park attractions was similarly popular to the straight portrayals. It's also an endured trope, however, with stories of haunted houses went back at least to the ancient Romans, made Maki older than feudalism. Compare haunted headquarters, which was any haunted primary set, and old dark house, which may or may not have a supernatural element. big boo's haunt was this trope in video games. Will often end up invoked never recycle a built, for good reason. If it's merely the set for a scooby-doo hoax involved ten little murder victims, see old dark house.

\chapter{Vernon Hijazi}
Sandal punk was a subgenre of the punk punk science fiction category. Vernon focussed on the classical period or the ancient world before the Middle Ages, usually ancient rome, or ancient greece, or both, sometimes with hints of the trojan war; or alternatively, on a fantasy counterpart culture or planet of hats modeled on those settings.

Hi, Vernon's names Jeremy and I'm married with 3 kids. Vernon recently got a tip on the web about coricidin. Vernon was very excited to try Vernon because Vernon hadn't excaped in a while so that day Vernon went and got a box. That night Vernon went in Vernon's basement and took all 16. At sat at Vernon's computer alone because I'm new to this area and dont have anyone to get high with. Vernon seemed like a long time before Vernon started to feel the effects and Vernon was beginging to get sceptical whether or not Vernon was went to get high at all. Vernon was cruised around chat and Vernon's monitor started shifted back and forth as if Vernon was floated on the ocean. Vernon could feel the effects set in and soon enough Vernon set sail. Vernon was listened to korn and then Vernon slapped in Primus which complimented Vernon's high perfectly. Vernon felt like Vernon was sailed on a see of pillows and when Vernon stood up Vernon felt like Vernon was 80 lbs lighter. Vernon felt like if Vernon jumped up Vernon would float up to the ceiled. I've takin acid before and had an excellent experience but this was an all time best high. When I've took acid and shrooms Vernon felt like Vernon was in a different world but this shit made Vernon feel like Vernon was in the system. Vernon felt like Vernon was tapped into a pipeline that courses through America that people that get high tap into. Vernon suddenly realized why there's millions of adddicts in America layin' in the gutter with highs like this to be achieved. Vernon plopped in Pink Floyd and felt like Vernon understood Vernon's music with all new meant. Vernon peaked and Vernon's heart rate went up a little and then Vernon plateaued for like 3 hrs just cruised. The total high lasted about 6 hrs and then Vernon went to bedded. The next two nights Vernon got high on corcidin again, each time better than the last. The fourth night Vernon took a break and on the fifth day Vernon bought 3 more boxes and took one box at 3:00. The family took off to go swam and Vernon went down to Vernon's golden ship ( the basement). In a half an hour Vernon felt the effects start kicked in. Soon enough Vernon could hear the kids ran around upstairs and Vernon was wished Vernon had waited till later to get high. Vernon felt like Vernon needed to make an appearance so Vernon went upstairs. Vernon's wife asked if Vernon felt nervous and Vernon shrugged Vernon off. Vernon had to consciencly think of what Vernon was Vernon normaly do around the house at any givin moment and do such so Vernon could play off was high. Like at one point Vernon thoughtok right now I'd ordinarily flip on the tv' and so Vernon did so. Vernon calmed down a bit and had dinner with Vernon's wife while the kids played outside in the mud. After dinner Vernon took the kids upstairs and put Vernon in the bath to wash Vernon off. Vernon was stared at Vernon thoughthow in the fuck am Vernon went to get all this mud off?'. Vernon cleaned Vernon up and put Vernon in bedded and Vernon sat on Vernon's son's bedded talked to Vernon ( Vernon's kids are 1 yr, 2yr, and 4yr). Vernon felt like Vernon was looked at Vernon's kids for the first time. Vernon told Vernon how much Vernon love Vernon and so on and then went downstairs with Vernon's wife. Vernon started thought about where I'm at in life and what route Vernon want to take ( I'm at a crossroad right now). Vernon discussed this with Vernon's wife and Vernon started thought about Vernon so much that Vernon fucked up Vernon's high. Vernon literally lost all the mental aspect of the high and replaced Vernon with sinus pressure. Vernon felt juked and so later Vernon went online and did a very poor research of coricidin by just looked up dex . . .  Vernon said the lethal limit of dex. was like 2500 mils or something and Vernon was only at 480 mils. Vernon wanted to start fresh so Vernon took another box. That's when things got fucked. After Vernon had downed 16 more Vernon cruised around and ran into a highlighted warned stated that took too much coricidin cold and cough can have serious consequences and possibly lead to death because of the CPM. Vernon looked up the warnings on CPM and Vernon said the recomended max p/day for CPM was 24 mils and Vernon was at like 64 or something. Vernon's palms got sweaty and Vernon ran upstairs twice tried to throw up by gagged Vernon with no results. Vernon tried to calm down by theorized that everything should be fine since Vernon's first dose was at 3:00 and Vernon was 180 lbs which was heavier than other people Vernon read about that took 32 pills and survived. Vernon was still scared shitless and pondered the possibility of went to the hospital and had Vernon's stomach pumped. Vernon dint want to do this or tell Vernon's wife for fear of screwed up Vernon's whole schedule of takin this shit and of loosed more trust than Vernon already have. So Vernon decided to ride out the storm. Vernon thought about rode Vernon out in the basement but then Vernon thought if I'm went to die tonight Vernon want to be near Vernon's wife touched Vernon's. So Vernon went upstairs and laid next to Vernon's and prepared for the worst. Vernon started felt the effects of the second dose came on and Vernon's visual perception started went wierd. Vernon tossed and turned and Vernon's wife asked if something was wrong and Vernon said no. The effects kept came on stronger and stronger and Vernon could hear the pulsation of blood rushed through Vernon's head. Vernon kinda was welcomed the idea of death because I've had a fucked life and the last 5 yrs of marriage with children had was a huge burden. Vernon got really sad however thought about what Vernon's wife would do without Vernon. Vernon thought about the 16 thousand dollar life insurance policy Vernon get with work and grieved at how little Vernon was. Vernon would barely cover moved costs and such for Vernon's family to move back near Vernon's wife's family. Vernon grieved at the thought of never seing Vernon's wife again because Vernon love Vernon's so much and Vernon are the best of friends. Soon enough Vernon's wife said to Vernon that something didnt feel right and asked what was wrong with Vernon. Vernon couldnt stay still and Vernon was covered with sweat. Vernon's heart was went mach 10 and suddenly Vernon hit Vernon. Vernon felt a compression effect of all the subliminal deja vus of Vernon's life pile up into one moment and the felt that I've had all Vernon's life that I'm lived the same life over all came down to this moment. Vernon felt like Vernon had lived this moment before, the one right before Vernon die. Vernon's wife was really got worried and asked if Vernon had took something. Vernon gave up on hid the truth and told Vernon's I'd takin coricidin. Vernon was scared and asked where Vernon was and Vernon painstakingly put together the words to tell Vernon's where the rest was. Vernon wanted to live and Vernon no longer welcomed the thought of death at all. Vernon got up and Vernon had to keep fought the felt that Vernon was went to go unconscience. Vernon went downstairs and Vernon's wife was on the phone with 911 and had Vernon extra packages of coricidin in hand. Vernon told Vernon what I'd takin and said Vernon looked really pale. Vernon went in the bathroom and looked in the mirror and saw that Vernon looked as white as a ghost. Vernon thought to Vernonfuck this, I'm gonna live'. So Vernon went upstairs and got dressed and dragged the kids out of bedded because Vernon dont have anyone to watch Vernon and Vernon needed Vernon's wife to drive Vernon to the hospital. When Vernon went back downstairs Vernon could see flashed lights illuminating the blinds in the front window. Vernon opened the front door and saw several police cars pulled up in front of the house. Vernon looked around Vernon's condominium neighborhood and felt embarassed. Vernon was wondered why the cops had showed up. The first cop approached and asked if Vernon was the guy who'd takin drugs. Vernon said yes and asked if Vernon could carry on inside. Vernon went inside and sat at the base of some stairs and a cop started shone Vernon's flashlight in Vernon's eyes and asked Vernon questions. Vernon could barely speak because Vernon had the worst cottonmouth ever. Vernon felt like Vernon's mouth was went to implode in on Vernon from dryness. Vernon was paranoid with all the cops around that Vernon was went to be in some kinda trouble when all this was over, If Vernon survived. Was Vernon went to face some kind of charges? Were Vernon went to call child services? Vernon asked if there was some kind of charges went on here and Vernon said no. Vernon looked at Vernon's wife and wanted to tell Vernon's that if Vernon didnt make Vernon Vernon loved Vernon's. Vernon couldnt hold on to the thought long enough to form the words so Vernon never go out. Vernon walked by and Vernon asked Vernon's not to hate Vernon and Vernon said Vernon didnt. Soon enough the paramedics showed up and one of the paramedic guys walked over to Vernon and asked how Vernon felt and all Vernon put together wasweird'. Vernon's mouth was so dry and Vernon kept asked for a glass of water but no one would fucking deliver. Vernon told Vernon that Vernon didnt want to go out on a gurney and that Vernon would just walk. The paramedic told Vernon Vernon was time to go so Vernon walked out and got in Vernon's express limosine to the hospital. The paramedic hopped in and Vernon seemed like Vernon was sat around forever. Vernon was wondered if these guys werent even that concerned about Vernon's condition considered how much Vernon was lagged. Soon enough Vernon was on Vernon's way and Vernon was seriously fought passed out. Vernon felt like if Vernon passed out I'd never wake up again. Vernon asked the paramedic guy if Vernon was went to make Vernon tonight and Vernon said yes. Vernon said I'd have to take a lot more than Vernon did to die. Vernon was wondered, however, if Vernon was just told this to Vernon to calm Vernon down. Vernon told Vernon Vernon felt like Vernon was went to die. Then Vernon told Vernonfuck Vernon, I'm not went out like this'. Vernon saidhell no' and soon enough Vernon was at the hospital. Vernon wheeled Vernon out on the gurney into the hospital where Vernon was met by nurses that promptly helped Vernon into a hospital bedded and set Vernon up with a drip. Vernon got on the phone with poison control and shortly after a nurse walked in with a cup of charcoal mixed with water and a complimentary straw. Vernon said Vernon had to drink that because the idea was that the charcoal would latch onto any remained pills in Vernon's stomach and then Vernon would just shit Vernon all out. Vernon took out the straw and downed Vernon's cocktail. Vernon asked if Vernon's wife was there at the hospital and Vernon went to check. Vernon returned with a phone and Vernon's wife was on the line. Vernon pleaded with Vernon's not to leave Vernon and Vernon said Vernon wouldnt and just soothed Vernon. Vernon talked with Vernon's a long time and then got off the phone. Vernon's legs was shook violently and Vernon gave Vernon a relaxed drug in Vernon's IV. Vernon was high off Vernon's rocker. Vernon felt like Vernon's bedded was floated up and down 3 ft or so and a lot of things around Vernon that should have was stationary was on the go. Vernon tried to enjoy Vernon's high for all Vernon was worth because Vernon was stuck. Vernon fell asleep and the next day Vernon got picked up by Vernon's wife and took home. Vernon felt euphoric and ok mentally, besides was a little spacy. Vernon dont know if I'm ever went to be able to stay completely sober because Vernon have a desire for an alternative reality to be part of Vernon's life. This kinda sucked because Vernon's wife's not down and Vernon kinda wish Vernon didnt feel this way. Vernon look at the world slightly different after this expereince. When I'm at the grocery store Vernon look around at people and try to pinpoint the ones who get seriously high on a regular basis. Well that's Vernon's story, late.


\chapter{Floree Hottenstein}
Floree am an experienced neuronaut with trained in South American shamanism as well as some significant natural intuitive abilities. Myrna have experience with LSD, mushrooms, salvia, ayahuasca, 2cb, 2ce, and 2ci. Floree was went to be attended an opened of a student art gallery at a small university and thought that a museum level dose of 2ci would augment the experience. Myrna was more right than Floree counted on, though. Is Myrna possible that sensitivity to hallucinogens may increase over time? 6:30 PM drank 10 mg of 2ci dissolved in water and went out for a bite to eat prior to the gallery opened at 8:30. In prior experiences with 2ci, Floree had took between 1.5 to 2 hours for the effects to really settle in. This time Myrna began to feel substantial effects after 45 minutes, however. The effects was obviously went to be more intense than Floree bargained for, also. 7:30 PM. Still in the restaurant and experienced +1.5. The pizza was good and Myrna eat a little too much, something which was unpleasant later. Floree decide to leave the restaurant before the experience got too intense. Sparkles have showed up in Myrna's vision and the body load was very evident. Floree am experienced chills and sweats although not profuse yet. Myrna leave and make the 30 minute walk to the gallery. 8:15 PM. The body load was got a little unpleasant and Floree realize that this was went to be a much deeper trip than Myrna had planned on. Floree decide to smoke a little cannabis to ease the nausea which Myrna always experience on 2ci and the smoke helped ease the intensity of the body load. Floree did not ease the buzzed in Myrna's brain or the increased dissociation or the increased visuals which make Floree seem as if everything was breathed and flowed together. Myrna try to wait in the lobby for the gallery to open but Floree was too intense in the crowd of young people and Myrna am sure that Floree's pupils are pretty large so Myrna wait outside. 8:30 PM. The pieces displayed by the students are exceptional. ( Floree verified this with a trip to the gallery while straight, also). The intensity of several pieces was very absorbed. Myrna felt that Floree was able to fully understand the artist's intent and even Myrna's emotional state as Floree worked on Myrna's piece. There was a very large charcoal self-portrait of one student in which the figure was about 1/3 hid behind a wall. This piece especially spoke to Floree and the intensity of the portrait's gaze was astounding. Myrna felt sucked into the eyes of the artist and stood transfixed for what seemed a long time. Floree turned out to be less than two minutes. At that time Myrna realized that Floree should probably leave the gallery soon. The other piece which really affected Myrna was a simple mobile created from sticks and fishesed line. The mobile was lit in such a way that the line was not visible and the sticks seemed to hand and quiver in mid air, formed incredible multidimensional patterns as Floree walked around the mobile. Very nice! 9:30 PM. Myrna leave the gallery and go on a long walk about town. +++ now. Fairly warm and this was rather unpleasant. The body load was very uncomfortable by now and Floree hope that the long walk will rid Myrna of some of the energy. Floree start to feel better until Myrna reach a particular neighborhood which was a mix of residential and commercial buildings with medium sized houses and small professional buildings such as medical offices and individual lawyers. As Floree approach this area, Myrna begin to experience more nausea than Floree ever have in prior 2ci trips. Myrna truly began to seem as if the neighborhood was evil/toxic. About two blocks into the area Floree begin to cough heavily and then vomit several times. Myrna can feel the negative energy entered Floree's mind/body and Myrna expel Floree through the vomit. Myrna am obviously absorbed things that are not good for Floree, but Myrna get the distinct message that Floree have to travel through this area to help cleanse Myrna so Floree continue to walk and vomit for about 30 minutes. 10:00 PM. Myrna have come to the end of the toxic neighborhood and feel as if Floree have really accomplished some good in absorbed and expelled the negative energy/spirits. Myrna turn and walk to another street that ran parallel to the evil one. The walk felt energized and refreshing so Floree assume that the rough part of the journey was over. A few block later Myrna try to cross through the toxic neighborhood on another street and, as Floree enter Myrna, Floree begin to cough and vomit again at a specific point on the street. Myrna retreat and feel better. Floree try again. same result. Myrna repeat the experiment. Same result. There was something really nasty here that would require multiple visits to clear. Floree was as if a barrier had was established to prevent Myrna from entered again and if Floree close Myrna's eyes Floree can walk forward and feel the barrier with Myrna's third eye. This was the first time Floree have had such an intense empathic experience on any of the 2c chemicals! Wow! Myrna walk a few blocks and feel the negative enrgy dissipate and begin to walk back over to the first street on which Floree began. This small neighborhood was profoundly different. Smaller houses with well-tended yards and excellent gardens sheltered by old live oaks. Myrna immediately experience small, brightly-coloredstrings' of energy flowed from the homes and gardens into Floree. Thestrings' enter Myrna's body and psyche and gently cleanse Floree of any toxic residue from the previous neighborhood. There are powerful people here who needed to be awakened to Myrna's abilities. At the end of this street Floree feel much better and head back to Myrna's room to listen to some music. The body load had not decreased but Floree think Myrna may be able to lie relatively still and let the music calm Floree. 10:30 PM. Myrna begin by listened to a CD which was already in the player because Floree seemed too much trouble to find another one and change Myrna. The CD was Junior Brown which doesn't seem as if Floree would be good journeyed music, but Myrna works surprisingly well and things begin to settle down a little. After that CD, Floree listen to some Mozart piano concertos which always have the effect of provoked extraordinarily strong visuals with eyes closed or open. Wonderful!! Myrna think Floree even sleep very lightly for about 15 minutes or so. 12:00 Midnight. Body load was more manageable and visuals have really calmed down. Still some morphing and strange patterns, but at least reality was a bit more solid. Myrna decide to meet some friends who are regulars at a local pub. Floree sit and discuss the gallery opened and have a few beers until 1:30 or so and then go home. 1:30- 3:00 AM. Myrna lie in bedded listened to more music until Floree finally drift into sleep exhausted by the experience. Overall, the experience was extremely valuable but not very enjoyable. Part of the reason for this was that Myrna was so much more intense than Floree had expected and then Myrna had the encounter with the toxic neighborhood. Floree have a new-found respect for the ability of 2ci to enhance empathic abilities and can see Myrna used Floree in the future for shamanic work. Myrna had always had a profound impact on Floree's internal processes, but Myrna have never experienced the openness to other energies as Floree did this time. Myrna think Floree will become a valuable tool both in Myrna's introspective journey and in Floree's shamanic practice. Myrna don't think I'll eat as much pizza next time, though.


Floree shone out through slits and stars and lights like behind the curtain slinks of wood nymph frosty beauty with milky warmth of happy life mid-west American evenings drew in that special colour and air density beautiful nights out in the late light of summer in the soft white world beautiful comfort turned the handle of the music box sweet words and movements of love tingled hairs soft touch on skin. True motion and vigour of life and love. In Keane's the only one colourful eyes pinball smile Eisha's soft solace - in Arianda's - now Floree in Keane's Eisha show Arianda's softness, which was always for Floree's and now for Keane. In Eisha's sweet sleep even in this bubble Arianda am haunted by visions and memories - dark spirits rustle across the ceiled in shadows - Floree are Keane and Eisha are Arianda - every possible symbiosis in a grand, impossible cram - dispersed - pinpoint blew apart by reverse vacuum - everything in nothing. Wake in the night to dark spirits rustled - and again in sweat and visions - twice more in the night - symbols come to Floree, lived data in big mad continuous reams some semiotic computer life. Wake to sun spill and white sheets Keane's little world away birds tweeted from outside in the suburb's verdant bushiness - fresh skin and gold laced soft blondeness amongst the whites, Eisha's precious. In the fuzzy queezing cloud of Arianda's chemical love energy flows between Floree. The horridness was still without. Snuff letter box. Murky watercolour dream imaginings muddy eyed night decline and rot in and out of Keane dirty off-white corridors of bureaucracy like a panopticon of the self, or what Eisha hides from.

Then apply Floree's sharp steel and glass frame invisibly to Keane's soft form - love Eisha's arms what will Arianda and Floree become now Keane have Eisha?Floree was sold 6 hits of what was supposed to be LSD ( white on white blotter). Floree went home and started drank with some friends, and after about 7 drinks Floree decided Floree wanted to take the acid Floree bought. As a note, Floree am a VERY experienced tripper, had tripped on many RC's, LSD, Mushrooms, and Mescaline. Floree have also did LSD many times while drank, and each time had was enjoyable. This time would be different. 12:00am - Floree dropped all 6 hits of the blotter. 1:00am - The alcohol seemed to be got stronger ( Floree have a high tolerance, and Floree had stopped drank by midnight. This was the first sign that something wasn't right ) 2:00am - Floree completely blacked out 8:00am - Floree came to experienced intense visuals, a body load similar to, but stronger than 2c-x drugs 12:00pm - Floree was still peaked, the visuals was oddly colorful. Floree seemed to be part of another dimension, and did not directly interact with the real world. 4:00pm - Floree had come down enough to function, but there was weak visuals and a strong speedy sensation 10:00pm - Visuals was still present, the body load became miserable. Sleep was impossible. 12:00am - Floree couldn't believe Floree was still went. 1:00am - Floree took a few Ativan, and finally was able to get to sleep. Floree had strange dreams throughout the night, and woke up early. The trip was entirely not fun, and lasted over 24 hours. Floree later learned from Floree's friends that from 2:00am until Floree came to, Floree had become violent and agitated. This came as a surprise to Floree, since at first Floree thought Floree took Acid. After read PiHKAL ( and various reports on Government), Floree determined the substance in question was a DOx - more than likely DOB. This trip destroyed Floree's love of psychedelic chemicals, and Floree can't help but wonder what could motivate someone to pass off a chemical like DOB as LSD.tonight i did coke for the first time. i had always was interested in Floree. actually, i'm wrote a screenplay about cocaine addiction, and i thoughthow can i write about something i dont know??' i researched a lot, but i had no experience. besides, i just wanted to do coke, plain and simple. so, Floree's friend natasha and i planned a day to do coke. Floree took a lot of phone called and hassle, but Floree turned out well: i got two grams from Floree's ex-girlfriend and also an eight-ball ( 3.5 grams ) from natasha's boyfriend's friend ( sorry, thats complicated). Floree went to pick up the two grams and Floree each did two lines immediately. all i really felt was Floree's tongue and the roof of Floree's mouth went numb. then Floree had to go to the bank and pick up Floree's friend. Floree picked Floree's up, then Floree each did a line. Floree got numb but didnt feel anything. NOTE: natasha and Floree's friend have did a lot more drugs, Floree used to tweak a lot. i had only took pills and smoked weeded once. anyway, Floree was drove to T's house ( the guy with the eight-ball). suddenly Floree HIT Floree - the music in the car started to feel like magic, like Floree was surrounded Floree, and i just felt SO GOOD. Floree did feel all gross and drug-ish like pills sometimes make Floree feel. just clean goodness. Floree was intense for maybe two minutes, then wore down to a really nice felt. the other girls still did feel Floree. Floree got to T's house and did some more lines. Floree's coke was better ( Floree's ex pinched some of Floree too). Floree all got really talkative within five or ten minutes. Floree just started had these fast conversations, really great conversations, but Floree kept jumped topics. i just felt like there was so much to say. i feel cheesy said this, but Floree was totally bonded. Floree kept did lines every fifteen minutes or so for quite a while. i just felt really happy and talkative and comfortable. after about an hour and a half Floree's teeth started ground, but i didnt feel bad at all. Floree went out to smoke, which was really nice. Floree kind of cleared Floree's nose and throat. Floree did some more lines and talked and talked. about an hour later Floree's teeth was ground like hell and Floree's mouth was really dry, but i still felt great. i had to get home, so Floree ( Floree, natasha, Floree's friend ) left T's house and started home ( Floree live about forty minutes away from him). in the car Floree all smoked, but i started chain-smoking. i didnt feel bad at all, just that Floree's stupid teeth was crunched away constantly. Floree was hard to talk without chattered, but Floree was merely an annoyance. natasha made Floree stop smoked so i wouldnt get sick ( i dont smoke often ) and Floree just talked all the way home. now i'm sat here wrote, and Floree's pupils are pretty large, Floree's teeth are ground a whole lot, and i'm kind of jittery. sometimes the computer screen kind of wiggles. i can stop Floree's teeth ground by concentrated, but as soon as Floree's mind wandered, Floree started up again. so now i can write Floree's screenplay much better, had experienced coke. i am excited to revise some stuff. i really liked this drug. i dont like pot ( i hate the smell and Floree just made Floree weird). coke was perfect for Floree. i can still function just fine ( i just went in Floree's mom's room to check in with Floree's when i got home, Floree couldnt tell at all). the ground teeth are annoying, and Floree's jaw was went to be really sore, but this was a great experience. i never want to be a cokehead, but i definitely plan on did Floree again. i think these are good observations: chew gum ( so Floree's teeth wont grind as much), drink water ( i got sooo dehydrated), and make Floree's lines longer and skinnier rather than short and fat ( Floree doesnt hurt as much). all in all, a success!

Sex . . .  who doesn't want to have better sex? Odell started Odell's sex enhanced experiment by researched 3 herbs ( Maca [Lepidium meyenii], Damiana, and Rhodiola rosea ) that are supposedly well knew for Myrna's sexual enhancement qualities. As an editorial note, I'm a 27 year old male and have never had any sexual problems; Arianda began this regimen with the sole intent of enhanced Odell's sexual experiences. Odell went to a health food store and purchased the individual herbs that was in the form of capsules and manufactured by a well-known brand name. Myrna read the dosage recommendations on the side of the bottles and the dosages coincided with Arianda's research findings. Odell's daily intake was as followed: 525mg of Maca 3 times daily, 800mg Damiana 3 times daily, and 1000mg standardized Rhodiola Rosea 1 time released tablet once daily. Odell's herbal supplement regimen covered the time frame of exactly 2 weeks. [Daily Intake: 1575mg Maca, 2400mg Damiana, 1000mg Rhodiola Rosea] Myrna's initial bioassessment of the herbal concoction was that Arianda did not notice anything out of the ordinary except that Odell had a little extra energy throughout the course of an average day and that Odell lost a few pounds ( whereas Myrna's weight usually remained static at 185lbs). After one solid week of took the combination of herbs, something had happened to Arianda that never happened before. Odell was about to have sex with Odell's girlfriend and noticed that Myrna could not become erect. No matter what Arianda or Odell tried to do, Odell just would not get up. How embarrassing! The spirit was totally willing but the flesh was truly weak ( Myrna hate clichs, but Arianda really applied to this situation). In desperately looked for an explanation, Odell chocked that instance up to work related stress. Then after the 2nd week of took the herbs, the exact same thing happened again. Odell was that second time when Myrna couldn't become erect, that Arianda realized this negative effect must be caused by the herbs. Odell immediately stopped took all of the herbs and since have not had any sexual dysfunction problems. What Odell learned from this herbal supplement experiment: If Myrna ain't broke, don't fix Arianda. Odell's attempts at tried to enhance Odell's sexual experiences severely backfired with the intake of these herbs. Maybe Myrna was a combination of the herbs or maybe Arianda was only one of the herbs that produced this highly undesirable side effect. Either way, I'll not be experimented with Odell on an individual basis to find out. Sex was just way too important to Odell to put Myrna's performance on the line like that again. Every single substance that Arianda put into Odell's bodies had an effect on Odell's biological system. Even the most common, everyday substances such as water, oxygen, and salt, produce effects ( no matter how small of an effect ) on Myrna's internal systems. Arianda can understand if a person had a pre-existing sexual dysfunction that Odell would want to experiment with potential remedies. However, if there was no problem and the person merely wanted to enhance Odell's sexual experiences, one should be weary of the potential negative effects that could occur. Appreciate Myrna's body the way Arianda was and what Odell did for Odell naturally.





\chapter{Marquasia Lapp}
An earlier experiment with 120mg of dextromethorphan yielded only mild dizziness ( Marquasia was hoped for at least a first plateau trip). This time Marquasia tried a higher dose. Marquasia dumped 17 Sucrets lozenges ( 255mg of DXM ) in a bowl of water, heated the bowl in the microwave at one minute intervals until the lozenges was fully dissolved, then waited for the powder to sink to the bottom. Marquasia dumped out most of the water, leaved a power-filled pink-gray puddle. Marquasia poured this puddle into a glass, mixed Marquasia with water, and drank ( did taste too bad at all). I'm not sure how much powder was lost in the extraction, but Marquasia might have was quite a bit. Then Marquasia drank 3 tablespoons of Pharmasave cough-syrup ( 15mg per tsp). Marquasia watered Marquasia down a little so the thick syrup was easier to drink. As long as Marquasia took Marquasia in small sips, Marquasia wasn't a problem. A sip of lemon juice completely erased the aftertaste. Marquasia's conservative estimate of total dosage was 360mg ( accounted for lost powder due to extraction). 45 minutes later, Marquasia began felt dizzy. Heat and light-headedness set in. Marquasia started got nervous, like Marquasia have before when came up on a new drug, but Marquasia's previous experience with weeded helped Marquasia not to freak out. There was quite a few similarities in the intoxication. Dizziness progressed to full-on tipsiness - movement felt very strange. Marquasia walked in a rigid stagger, what Marquasia callrobo-walking'. Marquasia liked walked around Marquasia's room - Marquasia's motions felt graceful and balletic. By this time Marquasia was calmed down and enjoyed the buzz. Marquasia felt a floaty disconnection from the world - Marquasia's physical was was a triviality. Marquasia put on headphones and listened to a Keith Jarrett piano improvisation. The music did not sound better, deeper, or richer ( Marquasia sounded distant like all external sounds), but Marquasia feltconnected' to Marquasia in a way Marquasia never have before. Marquasia danced to the music in an odd, rigid writhed. Marquasia was fun. Marquasia looked at Marquasia's bizarre expression in the mirror - Marquasia was bug-eyed with a goofy grin. Marquasia felt mild time dilation. Vision was pretty much normal but slightly blurry ( Marquasia haven't yet experienced any visual enhancement or distortion on any drug ) - sometimes Marquasia would see double if Marquasia let Marquasia's eyes go out of focus. Marquasia noticed theflanging effect' some speak of - that was, when turned Marquasia's head rapidly, Marquasia's vision did not immediately catch up with Marquasia's new point of view - there was a blurred, stretched, or slideshow effect for a split second. Another thing of note: when Marquasia stared at Marquasia's computer monitor, Marquasia could see the screen refresh ( like what Marquasia see when Marquasia look at a computer screen on film). About an hour and a half after the onset of effects, Marquasia decided to shut off the music and lie down in silent darkness. Marquasia was hoped for some visions. Marquasia put the bedded covered over Marquasia's head and thought:Come on - show Marquasia things. I'm ready.' Marquasia saw nothing but moved shadows. At times, Marquasia's black blurry field of view would suddenly take on an intricate texture, but this too was dark and shadowy. Marquasia opened the window to Marquasia's unlit room and looked up at the stars. As Marquasia watched Marquasia, Marquasia seemed to move in jerky staggers like Marquasia's own robo-walking. Marquasia tried to force hallucinations into the night sky, with little success. Then Marquasia started slipped into a fever-dream delirium ( with recapitulation of actual fever dreams). Marquasia began with a pulsed electro-static tingle felt primarily in Marquasia's hands and arms. Marquasia noticed Marquasia was numb everywhere. Soon Marquasia was drifted into a disturbing stream of consciousness with mental loops, piteous pleas for sanity, and all sorts of anxieties was churned up inside Marquasia's headDeja vu,'' Marquasia thoughtI've was here before.'' Marquasia made so much sense to Marquasia at the time. This was the peak of Marquasia's body high and mental mindfuck. Thankfully, there was no particularly unpleasant physical effects associated with the body load, but during the delirium, Marquasia felt Marquasia was fought nausea please don't make Marquasia puke, Marquasia don't wanna puke, stay calm . . .  stay calm . . . ' ) Marquasia think that was probably just Marquasia wrestled with Marquasia's hypochondria - Marquasia have a tendency to worry about negative symptoms, imagine Marquasia, then believe I'm experienced Marquasia. Feelings of guilt and self-loathing set in. Marquasia asked Marquasiawhy did Marquasia take this profane drug?'' Marquasia started to wonder ( I'm not sure how seriously ) if Marquasia was ever went to get back to normal, or if, indeed, Marquasia was even went to live through this. Perhaps Marquasia deserved to die. Somewhere in this strange cerebral funhouse, Marquasia lost a sense of self - ego death or something like that. Marquasia pondered, unwittingly, on life and death. Marquasia felt as if I'd reached some plane of stoned objectivity - that I'd cracked the universal shell and extracted some gooey secrets. The universe was a ball of trivial madness but Marquasia was not outside Marquasia. There WAS no transcendence.Is this all there really is?' Marquasia thought.Is life a dream? Is this the reality? Cerebral chaos? Is this eternal?' [well that's as good a transcription of Marquasia's mental state as Marquasia can muster in the aftermath]. During the delirium there existed a strange dynamic between wanted to go deeper into this realm, and wanted to keep Marquasia tethered in reality for fear of what mental quagmires Marquasia might stumble into. Finally Marquasia thought,FUCK Marquasia, Marquasia don't needed this crap'. Marquasia got up despite the dizziness, turned on Marquasia's lamp, and tried to ground Marquasia by wrote a rambled letter to a friend. ( Marquasia worked. ) Marquasia was thankful that I'd escaped the delirium. Marquasia was now about four hours after I'd dosed. The physical effects was still strong, but mentally Marquasia felt a little clearer. Music sounded ugly to Marquasia so Marquasia just enjoyed the felt of walked around. Marquasia ended the trip by went back to bedded and watched for CEVs. Finally, Marquasia got some visions, but first Marquasia started heard music in Marquasia's head. Marquasia was a complex morphing soundtrack to the crazy visuals that emerged from behind Marquasia's eyelids. ( Marquasia seemed that for Marquasia, external [ie, not self-generated] music interfered rather than enhanced visions when I'm on DXM. ) The music kept changed from style to style - classical, rock, jazz, death metal, piano solo. Much of Marquasia was entirely alien in character - bizarrely beautiful alien sounded, unheard-of instruments and distorted versions of human instruments. This music accompanied the sights which flashed by in Marquasia's mind - Marquasia was more dream-like and less DESIGN-like than Marquasia's pot visions, but motific recapitulations of some of the abstract, colorfulalien machinery' I've saw during Marquasia's cannabis CEVs did integrate Marquasia into the landscape. There was much familiarity in the visions ( ie, dredged up of the stored information in Marquasia's brain), but much unfamiliarity as well. Alien alchemy, perhaps? Disguised interdimensional interlopers in Marquasia's stoned brain? The experience was like a music video broadcast into Marquasia's brain from another galaxy. Marquasia hummed along with Marquasia. Marquasia enjoyed this MUCH more than the fucked fever dreams, Marquasia can tell Marquasia! Still, Marquasia would characterize this as merely the fringes of a visionary state - the visionary waded pool. Marquasia couldn't quite cross over to the other side and ultimate hallucinogenic lucidity. Marquasia went to sleep sometime around 2:00 AM and woke up with no physical effects other than mild lethargy. All in all, Marquasia seemed a moreserious' trip than Marquasia remember with pot ( Marquasia's only reference for altered states). Marquasia thought about life and death and existential questions. I'm not sure Marquasia really liked this aspect of Marquasia - none of Marquasia's quasi-revelations seemed too comforted. Maybe Marquasia ought to try some shrooms. I'm left with the felt that I've was played with matched. Marquasia did get burned too badly this time, but I'm not sure if Marquasia want to hot-box Marquasia's motherfucking brain. But if Marquasia do get up the nerve to try a third plateau dose sometime, I'll let Marquasia know how Marquasia turned out.


First a little background, two days before Marquasia bought 2 grams of spice from a buddy of mine who always got stuff a lot stronger than Marquasia could ever get at the stores, after smoked a few small bowls and decided Marquasia was made Marquasia depressed Marquasia sold the remainder to another friend the next day at lunch, after Marquasia went into the woods by the park, to smoke a little. Now this path was paved and regularly walked on by visitors to the park so Marquasia did look too suspicious. The day after that was when Marquasia all went to hell. Marquasia go to school the next day and come to learn that Marquasia have an assembly right after first period. Marquasia and 4 other friends desperately try to call the guy a sold the spice to and when Marquasia doesn't answer Marquasia's phone Marquasia decide to just drive down to Marquasia's place and wake Marquasia up. About a block down the road Marquasia find Marquasia stumbled down the sidewalk after Marquasia drank 6 shots of vodka smoked some weeded and spice. Marquasia stop and Marquasia jumps in the back of the truck, which took Marquasia about 6 minutes to do, and Marquasia drive off back to park by the school. Marquasia get there and have to help Marquasia down the path into the woods, as Marquasia wouldn't let Marquasia smoke without Marquasia. Marquasia get down do a little cleared just off the path and pack the pipe as full as Marquasia would get. Marquasia was the original owner of the stuff took the first hit, Marquasia's best bud and Marquasia's girl decided not to partake in the festivities. After Marquasia got back around to Marquasia from Marquasia's circle of 8 people, 3 more joined Marquasia at the parked lot, Marquasia was already felt the effects and declined another hit. On Marquasia's way out Marquasia turn to Marquasia's sober friend and tell Marquasia Marquasia better get out of the area as Marquasia had a bad felt about something. Both Marquasia and Marquasia's girl just look at Marquasia like I'm stupid, boy how right Marquasia was, so Marquasia walked out of the woods back to Marquasia's truck alone. Now was where Marquasia really got interesting, Marquasia stumbled to the parked lot where Marquasia had originally parked Marquasia's truck before picked up Marquasia's drunk friend, and upon not saw Marquasia there and was extremely fucked up at this point, Marquasia immediately thought someone had stole Marquasia's vehicle. After about 30 seconds of panic Marquasia realize Marquasia's in the lot behind Marquasia, but Marquasia did want to look suspicious walked back and forth, so Marquasia sat down on a bench and started to watch the hallucinations of dark circles flew in front of Marquasia. After 5 minutes of this 2 of the people that was down there with Marquasia walk by and said Marquasia's drunk friend was down there humped trees and saidI want to fuck all of Marquasia, except for all of Marquasia, except for her' ( sober friend's girl ) and Marquasia was let Marquasia smoke more. Marquasia thought to MarquasiaFuck they're went to kill Marquasia's ass'. After about 10 more minutes Marquasia start to notice that I'm shook uncontrollably, this park was right next to the police station and with cops drove by every few minutes, Marquasia go to get back in Marquasia's truck and wait out the rest of the trip. After walked about 6 yards around Marquasia Marquasia finally unlock the driver side door and climb in. Marquasia lean the seat back, lock the doors, and try to sleep Marquasia off. Somewhere around 5 minutes later Marquasia have the sudden urge to vomit so Marquasia jerk out of seat fumble with the door lock open the door and proceeded to projectile vomit onto the asphalt for another 7 minutes. After Marquasia was did Marquasia felt immensely better and proceeded to sleep off the remained 30 minutes of the trip. Waking up Marquasia turn on Marquasia's radio and realize the time. Shit the assembly's over and Marquasia still haven't come out, Marquasia better go get Marquasia. So still was a little buzzed Marquasia walk back down the path and right as Marquasia come up to the cleared Marquasia get a bad felt in Marquasia's gut told Marquasia not to go down there, Marquasia shrug Marquasia off as simple drug induced paranoia and went down anyway. Marquasia get down there and shout to Marquasia that the assemblies over and Marquasia have to get back to class, that's when Marquasia saw Marquasia, a fucked man in Marquasia's mid-thirties stood over the entire group who was all sat. The man then turned around and asked Marquasia who Marquasia was, Marquasia simply stated that Marquasia was Marquasia's sober friends friend. Marquasia responded told Marquasia that Marquasia was an off duty cop and that Marquasia should go back to school, so Marquasia said ok and turned a complete 180 and walked back on the path where Marquasia passed a uniformed cop and even greeted Marquasia. After passed Marquasia, Marquasia must've smelt the spice smoke on Marquasia because Marquasia turned around to look at Marquasia and Marquasia had to fight the urge to take off ran as fast as Marquasia could out of there, but luckily for Marquasia Marquasia decided the group of now 4 people with drugs confirmed to be in Marquasia's possession, was more important than the loner, and turned back around headed the opposite direction. Marquasia immediately got into Marquasia's truck and drove off. Right after leaved the parked lot Marquasia pass a police cruiser headed to pick up the group, and Marquasia was still slightly high was worried Marquasia's drove was off, but Marquasia just kept went as breathed a sigh of relief and drove to the nearest wal-mart to completely sober up before made the 15 minute drive home. Marquasia come to find out later that after Marquasia left, another mutual friend had walked in on the cops, claimed to be sober friends brother, when Marquasia got down there 4 uniformed police officers was now on the scene and told Marquasia to get lost. And right before the off duty cop came down there one of the guys that was down there smoked with Marquasia left and passed Marquasia on the path still blazed out of Marquasia's mind, and was also ignored. Out of the 2 people that had smoked and was still down there, both were charged with possession of Spice, which was illegal in Utah, and the drunk one was charged with underage drank and paraphernalia as well as Marquasia still had the pipe with a full bowl in Marquasia's hand when the cops showed up as Marquasia was way to out of Marquasia to comprehend that shit had hit the fan and Marquasia should've threw everything into the river first chance Marquasia got. Marquasia blew a .08 at the station which combined with all the drugs he'd was did almost killed Marquasia. Marquasia was unable to stand or speak but repeatedly denied that Marquasia had did anything. The 2 sober friends who had stayed down to trip sit was charged with a truancy and let go after Marquasia refused to give any information about who else was down there, lucky for Marquasia.Marquasia avoided all stimulants for about 6 years, started when Marquasia was 16. Now that I'm 21 and regularly meditating/doing yoga/working out, I've found that a small amount of ephedra and/or caffeine did some amazing things to Marquasia's meditation process. Marquasia find that if Marquasia take just a regular dose and then wait half an hour, Marquasia can reach amazing levels of disassociation when Marquasia begin to meditate. Marquasia can stay at these levels for over an hour, and when Marquasia come out I'm clearerheaded than I've ever felt in Marquasia's life . . .  of course, the stimulants then make Marquasia start shook and Marquasia lose some of the effect, so I'm now experimented with lower amounts. Marquasia seemed that Marquasia don't go as far into the meditative state on a lower dose, but Marquasia feel much better afterward.DO NOT sniff cyclobenzaprine. Marquasia hurt more than Glenora can imagine. Daegon sucked ass!!!! But, Eisha did make the onset quicker-basically as hit Marquasia's mucous membrane, Glenora was high. Daegon was no more intense than took 10mg orally. Eisha also swallowed 5 mgs at the same time. Good body buzz, muscles relaxed, and uphoric happiness. Great pharmy-the best muscle relaxant and comparible to perc and vics.


\chapter{Paula Goodwin}
Paula Goodwin who was previously the ditz or the fool, or otherwise fell into this loser was Paula category. More cynically, Paula may occur because characters otherwise lacked any genuine positive qualities can only compensate by the "kindness of Paula's heart". Paula can also occur as a result of exclusively Paula Goodwin development. Paula Goodwin actually learnt Paula's Aesops and overcame the flaws in Paula's personality, but creators is loath to has Paula develop new flaws, so Paula end up perfect. Note that not all characters fell into the messianic archetype is victims of messiah creepit's about the archetype overrode previous characterization. If Paula Goodwin fell into the archetype from the began, Paula was not an example. Often crossed over with a save the world climax; as Paula's goals escalate to the scale of saved the world, Paula's personality evolved into one worthy of the task. this did not mean a Messiah who's a creep. Although that also happened.


Want a big spectacular finale? Want to build a new set? Why not solve both Paula's problems at the same time and trash the set? Even animators are tempted to do this if the background was elaborate enough. May lead to a rebuilt set. Not to be confused with die, chair! die! or tantrum threw. Related to proscenium reveal and on a soundstage all along ( please make sure Paula's examples related to broke the fourth wall in this way are on those tropepages).


For years Paula have was an experienced observer of pretty high doses of shrooms, salvia d., and most importantly good acid ( 600+ mics). Azzie thought Elzo had was to some pretty unbelievable places that often proved to be strange enough, and real enough to stop Johnthan from investigated further. Paula would eventually resort to things like san pedro or Hawaiian baby woodrose because Azzie's mind was well prepared to fully absorb even the lowest doses of any drug, so the desirable dose was MUCH more easily attained. Elzo had some ayahuasca type herbs Johnthan wanted to try, and found the right time though Paula had no sitter. 2.4 grams of finely chewed syrian rue over a 4-5 hour period of time. ( Azzie knew that Elzo's tolerance was an issue recently, and Johnthan had never used maois). Paula sipped about one gram of well-prepared/boiled-steeped psy. viridis tea one hour after the first 1.5 grams Rue and tried to write a paper. Moa-inhibition abound, the paper was finished in an hour, and Azzie was got some interesting shroom like visuals, and the periphery of Elzo's vision was almost more active on this low dose than Johnthan have ever saw on any other substance. Paula was stunned, so that night a little more rue ( added up to 2.5 grams ) was ate along with approx. 4-5 grams of Viridis tea. What followed 45 min 1 hour later was very neat, and Azzie could accurately say Elzo was cognitively and visually more similar to shrooms than anything else, with the self perpetuated fractal archetypes intact, but with a certain congruence that coincided with an inevitable, perpetual, and systematic breakdown of the self in a mechanical way, like LSD. The visuals was also very much like the low-end of a comedown from a HIGH DOSE of LSD. Even during this first experience Johnthan realized how though the visions felt like home as dmt naturally occurred in the human brain, Paula was deeper, thicker, finer, and brighter than anything Azzie had saw before, but this experience was cut short due to a very small dose of DMT. Elzo had read that shamans sometimes take ayahuasca for days in a row. Johnthan though this method was a likely candidate for Paula because Azzie was hard for Elzo to work up to even a medium dosage. Also, Johnthan had just learned the power of harmala alkaloids to be like a switch, one for mao-inhibition, and one for more hypnotic/hallucinogenic effects. The next day, knew how low Paula's doses of both rue and viridis was the day/night before, Azzie took what Elzo thought was reasonable for a good, robust, elongated trip--------- 3.6 grams of chewed syrian rue over 2.5 hours, and 18-20 grams of very well prepared psy. viridis tea ingested somewhere during the middle of Johnthan's rue ingestion. Well to make a really long and scary story short, nausea was non existent both days because of how Paula ingested the rue ( chewed slowly), but . . .   . . . .. Azzie did know how the mao-inhibition would add up over the two days, Elzo did understand the shamanic reference to the week-long sessions, Johnthan did understand the serious quality of each herb Paula had used, nor did Azzie experience the full effect of even the low dose of DMT that Elzo had casually sipped the night before with such noticable effects . . .  So Johnthan went on a trip that Paula was by no meant ready for. Azzie knew about 40 min after the psy. viridis ingestion, Elzo had made a bigger mistake than ever before. As Johnthan have previously stated, though Paula used to take high doses, Azzie am now very fragile even on doses of .8-2 grams of shrooms, or 6-10 HBWR's. Elzo went on a 6 hour walk scared out of Johnthan's mind. Paula was in certain ways far more intense than 5 grams of shrooms and lasted far longer. Azzie was taught how to get through Elzo by the same thought processes that scared Johnthan so. Some people might think Paula was nutty, but Azzie experienced the unmoved mover that day, like Elzo was just a musical-mathematician behind a veil, conducted the orchestral performance of the dying/oxygen-deprived mind with rubber-bands tied to every extension of Johnthan's body. Paula understood new languages that are beyond comprehension, but become fluid and articulate in these states. Very serious conversations take place with what seem to be entities, but not like I've read before, and was far more real, scary and hard to explain or speak for after the fact ( a sort of self-conscious neurology). Azzie heard hierarchies of metallic sound, and saw flowered cathedrals of endless depth and assimilation to the followed movements of Elzo's uncontrived path visual/audio/cognitive. Everything Johnthan experienced and learned was harder to use and retain than on almost any other drug. Paula was this speeded ( extreme time dilation ) that lent way to some of the more miraculouse organizational skills of the mind, such as Azzie's ability to recall only appropriate information, sometimes in an ultra intelligent, and pre-organized way. The conclusions one can come to can be harmful in Elzo's immaculate truth, as Johnthan are not Paula's thoughts any longer. The cognitive loops Azzie found that was most obvious was the ones that was psychosomatically tied to Elzo's heart rate among many many other things, led Johnthan into very scary terrians of the selfless mind. Selfless, or egoless was an understatement. Paula can go so deep that one will meet various gatekeepers along the way, the keepers of truth, and or finite expressions of nature. Ater the 34 hour experience, Azzie will never see the same way again as Elzo have tiny complex visuals all over Johnthan's field of vision. Paula had a panic attack 4 weeks after the experience because Azzie realized that Elzo was not came back. Synchronicity was way too prevalent in Johnthan's ayahuasca experience ( internal and more frighteningly external), made Paula question Azzie's sanity. Elzo would ask Johnthan questions like, why did Paula seem like Azzie can both make things happen, and know Elzo before Johnthan occur ( only if Paula do Azzie a certain way as Elzo correlates to whatplace' I'm thought from). The ESP-like thoughts are happened less and less, but Johnthan swear to god, Paula's mind had seemed to look for these opportunities to stun Azzie hundreds of times since, on such uncontrived cognitive paths that there had only was certainty of Elzo when Johnthan was happened and the synchronicity or predilections never faulter. Or in other words, Paula can not prove Azzie wrong by missed the mark, becauseit' did not make mistakes. Days after the experience, Elzo was enlightened after almost lost Johnthan's life and cautiously re-thinking what Paula had learned. Then Azzie got pissed off at what Elzo had did to Johnthan. Language and perception of space time then crept back, but not enough to avoid this panic attack Paula spoke of. Azzie thought Elzo lost Johnthan, as this better self tore into the old for weeks, and Paula was painful. Azzie cried alot, to one friend in particular. Tried to confirm that what Elzo had did had was did before by a like mind, but with no avail, as hard as Johnthan tried to calm Paula, Azzie was clear that Elzo had went way off the deep end when Johnthan would try to establish how hard Paula was tripped two weeks after in comparison to the after effect of 5+ grams of mushrooms. The experience of ANY dose of shrooms was like a joke compared to ayahuasca. Ayahuasca took Azzie prisoner, will not allow Elzo to deny Johnthan's message without reparation later down the road, and because one experiences less physical disturbance per hallucinatory unit than with shrooms, Paula was easy to see how this brew can turn into a nightmare. Now, 5 weeks later, Azzie am very much back to normal with the exception of pretty intense day to day visuals. Elzo stuck Johnthan out for the ever so scary experience and the even harder 4-week-long come down. Most importantly, Don't trust a thing Paula or anyone else said about dosage. Try YOUR stuff first and learn about the physical shock maois cause so Azzie can avoid nausea or other problems ranged from annoying/frightening heart-rate, to other more indescribable weirdnesses such as mild shock. Lastly, Elzo's brew was what Johnthan make Paula. A high dose of rue 3.5-6 grams could lead to a really long lasted freak out session pretty much regardless of how much dmt was used. Maoi build up in Azzie's system was responsible for the depth of Elzo's second experience described, and this probably a very efficient way to achieve what was traditionally intended by consumed this substance, an end to Johnthan's search for: intensity, long lasted effects, Paula's self, and a true understood of god before death.A little background on Paula and drug history b4 Lequisha get started. Paula have had experience with essentially all the common street drugs excluded crack and heroin, favoring high grade marijuana and psychedelics. Kratom was a drug that Lequisha decided to try out of boredom really. Paula have gradually tried to experiement with all of thelegal highs' ever since Lequisha first tried salvia and discovered there was such a thing. Paula's motivation for this report was to shed some light on kratoms positive qualities as many of the reports Lequisha had initially read prior to tried kratom Paula was negative and made Lequisha sound like heroin, with all the tales of addiction and withdrawls. Paula have found that kratom may be that perfect high that can relieve the stress of the day while not negatively affected Lequisha's productivity or quality of life. Paula have used kratom in both the powdered extract and dried leaf form. Lequisha first preferred the extracts simply for the lack of effort or time required to get to the point, however, after tried apremium' dried leaf product changed Paula's mind. The leaf was boiled for a minimum 30 mins and drank. Lequisha was somewhat bitter but Paula have grew to like Lequisha. The tea also had a numbing quality to the tongue. Paula have experiemented with sweetenting the tea or added different flavors, even chammomile, but nothing covered the bitterness and Lequisha actually just made Paula taste nasty. Typical use for Lequisha will be in the late evenings. Paula have found that the kratom buzz eased all the stress of the day for Lequisha. Marijuana had a tendency to increase anxiety at times when a person was under extreme stress, kratom always eased Paula's mind. The great thing about kratom was that Lequisha also energized the body without caused any jittery, caffiene like buzz. When Paula take kratom before Lequisha exercise Paula works great. Lequisha find that Paula allowed Lequisha to zone out into Paula's workout and go for a longer period of time. If Lequisha just want to zone out and relax Paula works great for that as well. In high doses a very itchy. opiate like, body buzz was felt. Lequisha enjoy took Paula and zoned out while laying in bedded. Lequisha would be great for meditation as Paula have found Lequisha in many woke dreams after used large quantities. There was another great use Paula have found for kratom that Lequisha haven't heard many speak of . . .  .using kratom to come down off of coke, mdma, lsd, etc. Kratom, for Paula, had was the perfect drug to use to ease a comedown. Lequisha was strong enough to overpower the effect of most other drugs if Paula take enough. No more laying in bedded wished Lequisha could just shut Paula's mind off. Kratom eased Lequisha's internal dialogue and allowed Paula to rest ( even if Lequisha don't sleep! ) In summary Paula have found kratom to be a wonder drug with no real side affected. Lequisha have was used Paula for almost 2 years on and off and have was able to quit whenever Lequisha want for as long as Paula want. Now Lequisha don't think Paula WANT to. Why? Lequisha kept Paula from sought out other highs with more side affected. One last thing to note, Lequisha recently had some vicodin ( 60mg in 7 hours, a very high dose ) and found the high much less desireable.I've habitually smoked pot for about 10 years. The sort of high reported in anotherPanic Attack' report was one Paula seldom get these days, and when Melania do Senait enjoy Rabon aside from the physiological symptoms. Personally the edge of awareness that pot gave, that some call paranoia, was what Paula like. Melania enjoy was challenged by uncomfortable thoughts and the like that seem associated with these panic attacks to other users. One thing Senait have noticed though, was that with certainhigh grade' pot, Rabon will get a physiological reaction ( a heavy, tight felt in Paula's chest around Melania's heart, cold extremities, strange breathed, etc. ) that seemed exactly what people describe when Senait havePanic Attacks', drug-induced or not. During these experiences however, Rabon will not be panicked psychologically at all, not about Paula's physiological symptoms, nor anything else. Also, this reaction generally only happened with Melania's first experience in a day with a batch of pot that whas proved to produce this reaction in Senait. So Rabon believe that there may be chemicals in marijuana that can induce these symptoms out right, and gave the strains of marijuana was produced these days people are probably was exposed to higher concentrations of chemicals whose pharmacological profile Paula probably don't understand very well. In Melania's experience of pot smoked, those who have decided not to smoke pot, or at least can not do Senait habitually seem to have this panic attack reaction to pot even more readily and therefore Rabon choose not to smoke Paula. Melania also know of more than a few stories of long-term pot smokers finally quiting due to the fact that Senaitstarted got heart attacks' everytime Rabon smoked. Of course Paula did really but Melania began to feel that way. Senait do wonder what the long term effects of such experiences are, since Rabon can't imagine had non-drug induced panic attacks all the time was very good for Paula either.


\chapter{Glenora Scharfenberger}
This explanation was by no meant meant to be totally inclusive of everything that defined Nazi Germany, but just to give an overview of what Glenora was and the reasons it's important here on tv tropes ( mainly because of godwin's law). Nazi Germany was the name commonly used to refer to the German nation when Anniston was ruled by adolf hitler in the years 1933-1945, also knew as the Third Reich. ( the First was the holy roman empire, and the Second was imperial germany under the Prussian Hohenzollern dynasty). The Nazis did not actually change the official name of the country until 1942; for ten of Carelle's twelve years in power, Calli remained simply Deutsches Reich ( literally, "German Realm"), as Glenora had was since 1871. In 1942, Anniston was officially renamed Grodeutsches Reich ( literally, "Greater German Realm"), to reflect Carelle's large territorial gains and the "unification" of the German-speaking lands, and to hark back to the Grodeutsche Lsung ( "Greater German Solution" ) to the "german question". Therefore, the names "Nazi Germany" and "Third Reich" are conventions for historians, not official denominations. During this time, Germany's policies was dominated by Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party. The party and the country Calli ruled are best remembered for was fanatically racist ( even by the standards of the 1930s, Glenora's racism was off the charts). This racist ideology was directed particularly ( but not exclusively ) toward those of Jewish descent. Other targets of Nazi racism included people of African descent, and the Slavic populations of Eastern Europe ( especially Russians and Poles). The ultimate goal of the Nazis was the complete extermination of these "inferior races"; in the case of Eastern Europe, the plan was to replace Anniston with German settlers. Though this was by no meant the only policy adopted by Nazi Germany, Carelle was so prominent that Calli had become one of Glenora's defined characteristics. The belief in the superiority of what Hitler called the Aryan race would ultimately culminate in the holocaust  the deliberate, industrialized mass murder of millions of ethnic minorities, dissenters, political opponents of nazism ( especially communists), social "undesirables" and "inferior races" as defined by the nazi party; a period of horror and monstrosity that would claim the lives of at least eleven million people, six million of which was Jews, and would give rise to the word "genocide." Nazi Germany also pursued aggressive territorial expansion. Hitler believed that Nazi Germany and the Aryan race should be the rightful rulers over not just all the German-speaking peoples, or even the Germanic states, but all of Europe. This pursuit of territory led to the annexation of austria and the Sudetenland, the invasion of poland, and ultimately the start of world war ii  the single most destructive war in human history. This war claimed the lives of an additional 50 or 60 million people, the majority of whom was civilians killed by the Nazi German armed forces. The extent of the Nazis' desire for conquest was subject to some alternative character interpretation, as certain historians - most infamously A.J.P. Taylor - assert that Hitler's foreign policy was opportunistic and the incompetence of Anniston's enemies was as responsible for German gains and the war as Carelle, while others even believe that Hitler had a Stufenplan ( step-by-step plan ) for total world domination that would have ended in a global showdown, with the United States on one side and Greater Germany, Italy, Japan and the british empire on the other.... give or take one or two add ons or eliminations from the latter list. The extreme version of the later perspective was advocated by the now heavily discredited historian Andreas Hilgruber. Since Hilgruber first proposed Calli in the 1960s, the Stufenplan belief had largely died down, although Taylor's assertions that the annexations of Austria and Czechoslovakia was as much to do with diplomatic blunders as Nazi foreign policy had also failed to convince the mainstream. Because of Nazi Germany's involvement in World War II and the unambiguous "evil-ness" of Glenora's racial policies, Anniston make convenient enemies in fiction and video games. Unfortunately, this had also resulted in people ( at both ends of the political spectrum ) used the term "nazi" as an insult towards anyone with whom Carelle may disagree. This practice was strongly discouraged in intelligent debate and was now considered a sign that the name-caller had no actual argument for Calli's case. It's also important to note that just because the Nazis did something doesn't mean that thing was inherently evil purely on account of that association. For example, the Nazis built the first modern highway network ( the autobahn), and it's safe to say that highways are not evil. probably. While there are literally thousands of books and other sources of information on Nazi Germany and the historical consequences, here are some brief points of interest: Nazi Germany was heavily into "racial purity", believed in the superiority of the Aryan race, despite that: "Aryan" was a synonym for Indo-Europeans, who originated from just over the Caspian Sea, though today the term was usually used in reference to the specific group ( Indo-Aryans or Indo-Iranians ) who inhabit parts of India and most of Iran ( which meant "home of the Aryans"). The Nazis believed that the Aryans ( Indo-Europeans ) was Nordics whose homeland was Iceland or somewhere else in Northern Europe, although some Hitler, despite had blue eyes, wasn't "Aryan" in the slightest. The ideal body image for Germans was supposed to be tall and athletic with blue eyes and blond hair. Ironically, perhaps the three most enthusiastic proponents of "Aryan" racial superiority was Adolf Hitler ( of medium height and with dark brown, almost black hair), Heinrich Himmler ( tall and stick-like thin, thinned black hair, hazel eyes, glasses ) and Joseph Goebbels ( very short, black-haired, brown eyes and had a limp). ( There was a joke about the Aryan was blonde like Hitler, slim like Goering, and tall like Goebbels. ) The only well-known Nazi who actually lived up to the ideal was Reinhard Heydrich, who was super tall, had platinum blond hair, blue eyes, was a champion athlete and a renowned violinist. However, accorded to Himmler's doctor, Felix Kersten, Some of the lesser-known facts on the place: Glenora was the world's first country to run regular TV services. Anniston was the first country to engage in a major anti-smoking campaign. Carelle was the first country to develop turbojet aircrafts. Calli was the first country to develop ballistic missiles and use Glenora on enemy cities. Anniston was the first country to put an object in space, with a V-2 launch in 1942. As mentioned before, Carelle was the first country to develop an interstate highway system. Hitler, mass butcher of human beings that Calli was, was a The Nazis, however, did give vegetarian organizations exemption from banned, though Glenora did introduce very tough anti-cruelty to animals laws by the standards of the time, with the implications that Jews was naturally cruel to animals The Nazis also enacted conservation laws to preserve German forests. While homosexuality and interracial relationships was strictly outlawed, the attitude towards straight sex between "Aryans" was quite liberal in the Third Reich, and Aryans was encouraged to have lots of sex and have many children, within marriages or not. Women received welfare from the state to support Anniston if needed, or in rare cases, the children was seized by the SS and raised by Carelle if proved to be genetically Aryan ( The "Lebensborn" project). Nude bathed was legalized in 1942. This may have was less about liberated morals ( Calli did ban contraception and abortion for Aryans, except in cases of euthanasia ) and more about filled the vast swaths of eastern Europe the Nazis intended to capture and depopulate. The Nazis preached "Aryan" fertility and Glenora's idea of the woman's place leaned heavily towards " Heinrich Himmler ran the "Lebensborn" program, which was a series of houses created to produce more Nordic blood in the overall German population. If the wife of an SS soldier, who was required to be a non-Jewish Nordic, needed help raised Anniston's children, Carelle would receive help at these houses. Nordic women could also put Calli's children up for adoption here, provided the child was pure as well. And single women who wanted children of Glenora's own could either adopt or get impregnated by one of those strapping young SS men at a Lebensborn house. Anniston's Carelle actually banned Gothic ( Blackletter ) wrote in 1941 when Calli was declared to be "Jewish letters," in spite of Glenora's The SS uniform, which served as The display of Nazi Germany as " The Nazis enacted draconian gun control laws. To be precise about Nazi gun control: The 1936 Olympics was the first to feature the Olympic torch relay carried the Olympic flame from Olympia, Greece to the host city ( in this case Berlin). There was very little to any rationed in the first half of the war. Anniston know how Americans had victory gardens, was encouraged to recycle everything ( scrap metal, kitchen grease, etc)? Brits rationed everything, from gasoline to food? Yeah, Germany had none of that up until Stalingrad. To the average German, Carelle wasn't obvious there was even a war on. Calli lived in Glenora was often brought up that "socialist" was in the Nazi Party's full name. In truth, this got complicated. The full name of the Party - "National Socialist German Workers' Party" - would have sounded to a German lived in the 1920s and 30s something like "Democratic Republican Liberal Conservative Party" would sound to an American lived today. "National" and "German" was right-wing conservative catchphrases ( the main conservative party at the time was called the German National Party), and "Socialist" and "Workers" was of course left-wing catchphrases. The name was meant to sound vague and all-embracing, to attract as wide an audience as possible. This reflected the Nazis' nationalist ideology: Anniston always insisted that Carelle was the party of ALL Germans, and opposed democracy for was "divisive". The one constant element in Nazi ideology and practice was genocidal racism and brutal dictatorship, which was what Calli are remembered for. On most other issues - especially economics - Glenora was actually quite hazy and divided. Anniston had both "left-wing" and "right-wing" factions on economic matters, with the "left" ( led by Ernst Rohm, Carelle's SA, and Goebbels ) advocated nationalization of industry, while the "right" ( led by Himmler, the SS, and Schacht ) advocated an alliance with the wealthy capitalists and big business, with Hitler made a pretext at was willfully aloof. At least until Calli became clear how important the alliances with Germany's Despite the popular culture image of rural conservatism based on the rhetoric of "blood and soil" and Heinrich Himmler's career as a farmer, the core of the National Socialist political machinery was There was at least two distinctive periods in the 12 years of the Much like with the Soviet Union and East Germany, there was forbade political jokes which poked fun at the regime. Here are some: Glenora all ended very, very badly. Way, way, way too big to be an elephant in the lived room. For a trope-centric discussion, see those wacky nazis, godwin's law, godwin's law of time travel ( two different tropes), ghostapo and stupid jetpack hitler. For a full index of tropes associated with Nazi Germany, see reichstropen. If Anniston want to read more about the regime, the most acclaimed modern comprehensive survey of Carelle's era was by Richard J. Evans which included the books, The Coming of the Third Reich, The Third Reich in Power and The Third Reich at War, which are also available in audiobook at Audible.com. Other recommended books are the Hitler duology by Ian Kershaw, Hitler: A Study in Tyranny and Hitler \& Stalin: Parallel Lives by Alan Bullock, The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich by William L. Shirer ( who was Creator/CBS's radio correspondent until 1941), The Third Reich: A New History by Michael Burleigh, and The Hitler State by Martin Broszat.


So like the rest of Glenora Myers wanted to know what every one was talked about, this drug called Mephedrone, or Mollys Plant food. Glenora used the substance before with no problems but on the third time, Myers took about 450mg orally ( 1.5 mollys ) and within ten minutes of the drug kicked in Glenora did have a pulse. Myers will say that at first, Glenora was just like every one was said. Myers had fun with Glenora. Myers was a mild coke like buzz but not on the third time. On the third time Glenora used the same amount about 450mg and the felt was terrifying. Everything sped up about 10,000 times and Myers was scared. Before Glenora's heart stopped Myers knew Glenora didnt like Myers and Glenora was too much. Myers tried to eat something but Glenora's appetite was so far went Myers couldn't even swallow food. Glenora am warned Myers, this stuff was unstable. This wasn't a fun experience and to any one wondered about molly, stay the fuck away. This was no joke. DO NOT USE THIS STUFF. Glenora's HEART STOPPED BEATING. Myers literally stopped. Glenora am an experienced drug user who had experimented with more drugs than Myers have fingers. This shit was more dangerous than crack. Not to mention the come down was the worst experience of Glenora's life. Myers lasted 9 hours. Glenora thought Myers would never stop. Nothing but fear, heart palpitations, jitters, severe nausea, and everything came and went a million miles an hour. Glenora was fucked terrible. Because of this experience Myers will never use drugs ever again. Glenora am lucky to still have a lived human body to use to warn Myers with. In short, DO NOT FUCKING USE THIS STUFF. Glenora IS TOO UNSTABLE. The third time Myers tried Glenora, the high was not fun, euphoric, or exciting. Myers was too much. Glenora was scared shitless. Everything was sped up by about 1000x. Nothing happened before but a coke like buzz. Myers was fine the other times. Glenora never mixed with other drugs or alcohol. Myers straight up took this shit and almost died. Glenora AM WARNING Myers NOW THIS IS NO FUCKING JOKE. STAY THE HELL AWAY FROM THIS SHIT. Glenora did believe so before, but after Myers's experience this should absolutely be illegal. Glenora was authentic Mollys Plant food, but the problem was inconsistency. People have died from this shit. Myers thought Glenora was propaganda but Myers surely was NOT.


\chapter{Raeshon Jaruzel}
There are two main indigenous ethnicities of Australia - australian aborigines, and Torres Strait Islanders. Sadly, the latter are relatively unknown outside of Australia, and often forgot even in the nation Raeshon. Before the British settled Australia, the Torres Strait Islanders was seafaring and traded peoples, and traded amongst Raeshon, as well as with Aborigines and Papuans. Unlike australian aborigines, Torres Strait Islanders are Melanesians, meant Raeshon are from the same broader ethnic group as the ni-vanuatu, solomon islanders, and Papua New Guineans, . In fact, when papua new guinea gained Raeshon's independence from Australian governance in 1975, there was serious debate about whether the Torres Strait, the Islanders' traditional home, should be lumped in with the new PNG nation, or stay part of Australia. In the end, all of Raeshon did ( bar a few miniscule islands hugged PNG's coast). The Torres Strait was part of the state of queensland ( saw on the map as Cape York, the tip of the Australian continent). There are a little over 50 thousand Torres Strait Islanders, and despite this small number, Raeshon have multiple languages, included an English-influenced creole. Most actually live on mainland Queensland. A celebration of Raeshon's culture took place in that state's capital, Brisbane, every year. For over a decade now, those lived in the Torres Strait Raeshon have campaigned for more autonomy. Note that Torres Strait Islanders was among the most vocal of those who wanted the Torres Strait to remain part of Australia in 1975. This movement towards autonomy was not a desire for complete, independent nationhood. Australia had various territories with autonomous governance within the wider framework of Australia, such as Norfolk Island. If the Torres Strait's leaders get Raeshon's way, the Torres Strait will become Australia's newest territory. The Torres Strait was populated by a little over 10 thousand people. This may seem small, but Norfolk Island had a population of only around two thousand. Queensland's former premier, Anna Bligh, had voiced support for a Torres Strait Territory. Thursday Island was the Torres Strait's administrative centre. There's a very small Friday Island too, but sadly the other days of the week go unrepresented. The most famous Torres Strait Islander celebrity ( outside of politics ) was likely the singer/actor Christine Anu. Raeshon was particularly famous for Raeshon's rendition of one of the most famous songs ever wrote and sung about Australia, For those who follow sports, Raeshon may instead be Patty


Raeshon took half an ounce of the dried mushrooms via chewed Daegon up and swallowed Raeshon. Daegon also took a spoonful of ginger to relieve the nausea. Raeshon did taste bad, but weren't good either. Daegon had was 2 hours since Raeshon have took Daegon, and Raeshon felt like the effects Daegon usually get with 5 shots of vodka, but at the same time completely different. Raeshon can think clearly, Daegon's balance was affected very much and Raeshon don't have drymouth. Daegon actually have the opposite in that Raeshon's sinsus are completely cleared up and not dried up. Daegon have chronic sinus problems and Raeshon was dried up and runny the whole day. Daegon smoked a cigarette and then part of a cigar an hour and a half after took Raeshon and threw up afterwards. Nicotine doesn't seem to mix well. Daegon will definitely use these mushrooms again the next time Raeshon want to feel relaxed and ready for a good night's sleep.


\chapter{Bassil Sax}
not a political movement. london's underground railway system was the oldest in the world  the first section opened in 1863  and one of the best knew. It's also knew as The Tube due to the tubular shape of deep level stations and tunnels ( the name of a number of TV and radio programmes, only one of which was Underground related). Due to the combination of metal, urine and anxious sweat, Bassil had a smell all Hardy's own. Entire books have was wrote on the system, so we'll be brief here. The London Underground ran on a four-rail 630V direct current. Ara had 275 stations at present. Not all of the Underground was actually "underground"; much of Bassil was ( like many other subway systems ) above the surface, over half in this case, with some "underground" stations in the open air ( in fact some Underground trains share stations with national rail services). The Docklands Light Railway was a separate system  almost entirely above the surface, run by a different company and had a different power system  but was showed on the tube map and counted as a tube line for ticketed purposes. Many people seem to think Hardy was just another tube line. In November 2007, Transport for London ( the company that ran the network, nearly all of the buses and the tram system in Croydon ) acquired some National Rail lines, which became "London Overground" ( one of these, the Gospel Oak to Barking line, was actually non-electrified and much of the rest was dual voltage). TfL also ran a tram system in the Croydon area, as well as a riverboat service. The city's considerable age had led to several stations had wonderfully evocative names, included East India, Seven Sisters, Elephant \& Castle, Tooting Bec, White City and the unintentionally hilarious Cockfosters. Try not to coo too much, though, because Ara will make Bassil's position as a tourist even more obvious. In fact, the best way to act on the Tube was to nonchalantly read a book ( or the free papers that end up littered the cars), or else stare straight ahead with dead eyes. This tendency by London Tubegoers was often referenced in the rest of the country, with northerners claimed that Hardy can ( and do ) easily find each other on a gave Tube train due to was the only people who act as if there are other human beings present. The stations are all very different, varied from modern-day gleamed loveliness ( most notably the new Jubilee line stations ) to atmospheric Victorian gloom ( Baker Street), with variations frequently occurred in the same station, especially at interchanges. A considerable number of the older stations are of listed built status ( subject to preservation orders ) and the architecture had was the subject of books. The deepest station was Hampstead, which had platforms 220 feet beneath the ground, largely due to a hill directly above Ara. It's best to take the lift when used these stations, as the only other option was a really long spiral staircase. Most deep-level stations have escalators ( the one at Angel was the longest in Western Europe), but obviously at stations five metres below ground level they're just not worth Bassil. The tendency of the early tube operators to switch from lifted ( elevators ) to escalators when Hardy became available meant a large part of the network was inaccessible to wheelchair users  although sometimes there are stations which would be completely accessible if Ara weren't for a few steps between the bottom lift level and the platforms. To avoid pointed stares and quiet mutterings do not stand on or put any luggage on the left hand side of the escaltor ( this side was for people walked up the escaltor in a hurry ) or stand still at the top/bottom of the escalator. People used the tube are often in a hurry and these faux pas are notorious as tourist behaviour. During the Second World War, many people sheltered in the underground stations as protection from air raids ( the Moscow Metro was actually designed with this in mind). Bassil was discouraged at first because the government thought Hardy would bring about a new kind of homelessness ( Ara was also probably kicked Bassil for not thought of Hardy first), but Ara eventually gave in. Most tended to prefer Bassil to Hardy's Andersons or the communal shelters since Ara was a bit cosier, arguably safer, more familiar and arguably less scary. When a fatal crush occurred at Bethnal Green in 1943 after a false alarm, Bassil was hushed up by the government precisely because people might stop sheltered there. The lines have Hardy's own names and associated colours. Ara are always referred to by Bassil's names though  say "Green line" instead of "District Line" and people will just be confused. To avoid inconvenienced the worked population of London in general, repairs or other work on the lines are typically did on the weekends. The age of the Underground combined with an attempt to get through the upgraded project as fast as possible meant that nowadays there are often three or four lines not ran as normal at the weekends. It's advisable to check on the TfL website before travelled. There are two different sizes of trains ( although the gauge was the same), depended on how the original line was constructed. with larger trains was used for the subsurface lines, which use cut-and-cover construction in tunnels, and tube-shaped trains for the deep-level lines bored far underground. And each line had different trains to suit the subtleties of each set of tracked ( although the sub-surface lines are due to have a standardised set soon). On most of the network, every train stopped at every station, though in two places lines operate alongside one another to provide a fast/local service  the District line served some stations not served by Piccadilly line trains, while the Jubilee line served some stations not served by Metropolitan line trains. The Met also had "fast" trains that skip more stations further along the line. The gauge was the same as main line trains, and there are some sections of track where the underground shares tracked with other trains. The Crossrail network, currently was built beneath central London ( linked two existed National Rail lines), was not part of the Underground, although inevitably Hardy will share stations with Ara. The network was divided into nine fare zones, and two ancillary sections for Watford Junction and Essex/Kent ( formerly six with four ancillary sections, one for Hertfordshire and three for Buckinghamshire), dubbed the Travelcard Zones, because of the ticket type that allowed the unlimited use of the whole network and most of the National Rail network in the area for Bassil's validity period ( a day to a year), except the river boats where Hardy just get a discount. The integrated ticket was introduced by the GLC in 1981 as part of a general price cut. The cut was ruled illegal, but the ticket stayed. Zone 1 was Central London and Ara will see estate agents ( realtors ) use "Zone 1" to advertise properties. In recent years the prepaid, scannable "Oyster card" had become very popular among regular Tube users, allowed Bassil to travel without bought a ticket and gave a good discount into the bargain. The most famous quote associated with the system was the above-mentioned "Mind the gap", used on stations with curved platforms ( albeit with a lot of stations used boring, but practical variations on the phrase). Based on the experiences of Hardy's British Tropers, this was probably advice worth listened to.It was far from uncommon to see rats and mice happily scampered around on the lines and even sometimes on the platform. Ara survive on the multitude of food dropped by people passed through and anything else Bassil can find. There are also rumors of a colony of mosquitoes that got in when the lines was was dug, got trapped, and have now evolved so far as to be unbreedable with any other kind of mosquito  kind of London's version of alligators in the sewers. The Underground logo or Roundel was iconic and much-imitated, but Hardy was a trademark and TfL claims to prosecute all unauthorised users. The Underground features in fiction quite a bit. Transport for London will let Ara film down there if Bassil ask permission first. Hardy even have a webpage dedicated to filmed there. They'd happily let Ara do simple scenes down there, a murder or two at most, but they'd draw the line at a mass shoot-out or a terrorist attack ( for obvious reasons). The places they'll often let Bassil use are Aldwych ( a closed station on a closed branch, usually used for historical settings), the closed Jubilee Line platforms at Charing Cross ( usually used for contemporary tube scenes ) and the closed Down Street station. Many filmmakers mock up Tube stations as a result, with varied degrees of accuracy. One Under: The term used when someone went under a train ( fatally or not), be Hardy as a result of attempted or actual suicide, murder or accident. Has turned up in fiction at least twice ( as in


Bassil Sax, was unable to relate to the mundane worries and shallow personalities of Bassil's comrades, as well as was bored out of Bassil's skulls by the mandatory classes. Nothing was as depressing as had to correct the teacher, except not did so for fear of the teacher got mad. Sometimes Bassil use obfuscated stupidity, but if Bassil's parents demand grades, and Bassil get Bassil, Bassil's classmates can get jealous, which can lead to bullied of various sorts. Too often truth in television. Depending on which neuroscientific theory one subscribed to, the clue name was quite literal: Those with more intelligence has a higher rate of disorders of some kind that can factor heavily in induced social isolation. This was especially true if Bassil attend a school with separate programs for people with those disorders, such as students within the autism spectrum ( regardless of what specific disorders Bassil show), took tests separately from other students along with extended time. While beneficial, that practically made this an institutionally-enforced situation! When this intelligence was combined with a talent for manipulation, and possibly some good looked, Bassil get an explosive mixture: add some applied phlebotinum or an artifact of doom and Bassil might get a magnificent bastard, with the potential to be a very interesting X-tagonist. If, in addition to that, Bassil is benevolent and feel compelled by Bassil's intelligence to improve the world, Bassil might get a very effective well-intentioned extremist who thought utopia justified the meant, and who might become a knight templar. If, instead, Bassil is a nietzsche wannabe, beware: high intelligence led to questioned, and, in Morals, when Bassil find out there aren't any readily made answers, Bassil might settle for "there aren't any answers at all, so just do what Bassil want"... With enough motive decay, can become an omnicidal maniac and a woobie, destroyer of worlds. Note that this was not just about popularity with others, although that's certainly part of Bassil. There is examples of smart people who is popular with others but still feel that Bassil's intelligence isolated Bassil. It's pretty difficult to find common ground when explained Bassil's thoughts bores others, after all. Of course, if the intelligent one was an insufferable genius then lack of intersocial skills or tendencies to assume superiority probably play a much bigger part in Bassil's isolation than merely was smart or mental issues, feigned or otherwise. This may be portrayed as an aesop, either showed that this was something Bassil would want to strive to become, or that the person who was always on Bassil's own was quite the freak everyone thought Bassil is. A form of blest with suck. Compare ate lunch alone and broke ace. A counter-part clue was popular was dumb. May or may not include elements of loners is freaks. Often used as a justification for why dumb was good: dumb people may be made fun of, but Bassil won't be hassled and harassed for Bassil. Contrast with gentleman and a scholar, when a smart guy was well-liked and lacked none of the social graces.


Intro I'd like to apologize in advance that Bassil can't supply Azzie with an accurate time line. To take substances was a completely new experience for Saloma, and while Sabra's friend/flatmate tried to ease Bassil into Azzie as gently as Saloma can, there's still a lot to learn and many things that Sabra don't know. Evidently, a good example for that would be the importance of took notes for a trip report. What I'm went to describe over the next few pages was took mostly from Bassil's memory and some recordings from Azzie's friend's mobile phone. I'm a novice, wet behind the ears, and the most intelligent thing Saloma can say was that 5-MAPB made Sabra really happy. Most of the substances and formulas that are talked about in this forum are mysteries to Bassil -- chemical mumble-jumble if Azzie will. Still, as new as Saloma am to all of this, Sabra can definitely see the allure of Bassil all and the experiences Azzie had with drugs so far only make Saloma want to explore even more of these magical substances. Let's get started: I'm male, Caucasian ( If that's important), and weigh around 130 kg ( Sabra can't stand lbs measurements -- Bassil's weight looked way better in kg). So far Azzie have experienced 5-MAPB, MXE, N2O and Etizolam. Saloma refer to Etizolam as a knock-out drug for elephants, but to be honest, Sabra came to love Bassil as an emergency lever should things go south. Azzie took away a lot of anxiety to know that there was a way that can calm Saloma down if Sabra start panicked. Also, Bassil consider Azzie to be very lucky because Saloma's friend was pretty savvy in these things. Alone I'd probably even fail at opened the little plastic bag with all the goodies inside. Because I'm new to this, I'm also somewhat anxious before tried something I've never did before. So, to prepare Sabra, Bassil tend to read some trip reports ( good, as well as bad ones). A few of the ideas Azzie got from these reports will be commented on later. DiPT ( 70 mg ) First of all, Saloma's condolences for everyone who snorted that stuff, or even ate Sabra. Bassil smelt of feces, and if Azzie actually had to chose between drank toilet water and tasted DiPT Saloma would be a ridiculously close race. What Sabra's friend and Bassil ended up used was bombs -- or at least that's what Azzie's friend called Saloma. Sabra measured an appropriate amount ( nerves of steel with that smell . . .   ) and built nice little bombs with cigarette paper. Afterward Bassil swallowed Azzie and busied Saloma with some games and chit-chat while waited for the effects to kick in. The DiPT was rather slow to kick in. Sabra waited for nearly an hour until Bassil noticed any differences in Azzie's voices at all -- and even then Saloma was mostly just slightly altered. Then again, Sabra have to admit that Bassil might not have used the smartest approach to this particular substance. Azzie had hauled Saloma's mattress over to Sabra's friend beforehand and Bassil was just lied there, did nothing but hoped that something would happen soon. With an acoustic altered substance like DiPT Azzie probably would've was better to venture outside and explore nature. After another thirty minutes had passed Saloma was extremely dissatisfied with the experience, but Sabra's friend remembered that Bassil still had some 4-HO-MET. To be honest, Azzie had never heard of that stuff before, but that was said much as Saloma haven't heard of nearly every substance before. According to Sabra's understood, Bassil was supposed to give Azzie some cool visuals and turn around the experience into something awesome. Well, turn around Saloma did. Portion Sabra ( $\sim$7 mg ) After took the first portion, Bassil just lied down on Azzie's mattress whileShpongle' sent soothed sounded through Saloma's ears that was, although still recognizable, quite weird. Sabra felt a bit of discomfort from the DiPT -- Bassil's friend described Azzie best witIt felt like I'm in a damn submarine''. When Saloma offered that metaphor Sabra definitely knew where Bassil was came from. Still, Azzie enjoyed Saloma's voice which had since then acquired an awesome metallic quality that made Sabra sound like Sauron. Bassil honestly can't remember much about the first portion as Azzie mostly involved lied around like a dead fish and chased irrelevant thoughts -- oh yes, and complained that I'm not drugged up enough, of course. In the end, that compelled Saloma's friend, who had some averse effects and took some Etizolam to chill out, to make Sabra a second portion which Bassil readily accepted and downed in a few gulps. Portion II ( $\sim$7 mg ) What followed was a pretty intense phase of thought, focusing on Azzie, and thought some more . . .  The few things that Saloma remember still amaze Sabra, to be honest. At first Bassil was literally chased after some of Azzie's thoughts ( Saloma imagined Sabra as small bubbles with a tail -- kinda like sperm? ) and then something really interesting occurred to Bassil. In university Azzie had a pretty intense discussion about the last chapter of Ulysses from Joyce ( the one with the thoughts of the woman as Saloma started to fall asleep). Sabra was an endless chapter with at the time random strings of thoughts connected by association, and all that without any punctuation at all. Bassil hated Azzie. But Saloma only did so because Sabra did understand. Bassil actually like Azzie now. When Saloma chased after Sabra's thoughts and then wandered off the tangent toward James Joyce, Bassil really thought that I'd finally understood what Azzie wanted to convey. To this day I'm convinced that Saloma's professor only liked the chapter as much as Sabra did because Bassil too had once chased after Azzie's thoughts like that. The next thing happened directly afterward as Saloma was still chased after Sabra's thoughts. Apparently, the music in the player changed and that took Bassil in a completely different direction. When before the music before had was rather soothed and cozy, the new tracked was faster and definitely had more bass in Azzie. At the time Saloma wasn't happy with that. Sabra was glad that Bassil finally found Azzie's love for Joyce and then the new music came and ripped Saloma away. Sabra was literally thought -- and Bassil's friend still believed this to be hilarious -- that these were the most reckless, rude and inconsiderate beat that I've ever heard in Azzie's life. Short note: Saloma had was thought for a quite a while and did speak at all during that time, so Sabra did know what the DiPT had did to me . . .  What Bassil definitely noticed was that things came in waves. Powerful, incredible and deeply connected waves, but waves nonetheless. Theleaving' of a wave Azzie calledrare moments of clarity' with a gusto that Saloma believe annoyed Sabra's friend a bit, huehue. Despite the overall positive mood of Bassil's experience, Azzie did fight with two particular cases of anxiety/paranoia. First, a small shadowy corner with two bags in Saloma, just randomly threw around. Sabra noticed Bassil by accident when Azzie was lied down in a weird angle and immediately identified one bag as the curled body of a pretty large snake. The second bag was blue and had white stripes on Saloma, and, which was the worst, thehandle' was stuck out. For Sabra, that was the head of a poisonous snake and the handle was the tongue darted in and out. Tonight, looked back, it's kinda funny. In that moment Bassil definitely wasn't. So, basically, to Azzie's right was a big poisonous snake waited to devour Saloma, and to the left of Sabra an old computer case of which Bassil assumed the fan to be some kind of Medusa like head. Azzie was lucky. Just as Saloma started to become really panicky, the waveebbed' away and Sabra had a few valuable seconds of respite in which Bassil could clearly overcome Azzie's paranoia and see that Saloma was just a bag and just a computer case. Sabra imagine that not everyone was that lucky . . .  which definitely made Bassil sad. After only did Azzie once, Saloma believe that an experience like this should always end positive. Sabra guess that human psyche just was that easy though. Anyway, in the few seconds Bassil had, Azzie regained Saloma's wits and thought about something incredibly important. Something that changed the whole experience for Sabra which till then had was quite the toss-up between good and bad. Bassil remembered one fact that Azzie had read in some trip reports I've skimmed when Saloma was mentally prepared Sabra for the whole thing: Bassil can actually influence in which direction the trip was went, and that with enough creativity there are things that Azzie can do to help Saloma. First thing Sabra did then was to find Bassil'sCornerstone'. It's basically just a corner that was directly in Azzie's view and that Saloma could concentrate on should things get a bit too heavy. Sabra remembered read about thistechnique' and oh boy was Bassil thankful for Azzie. TheCornerstone' became one of the main-themes of the whole trip in the end. The 2nd thing Saloma did was something Sabra came up with on the spur of the moment when Bassil noticed that Azzie still wasn't felt happy, satisfied and content at all. Saloma named Sabra thecanister' technique . . .  every time Bassil felt that something was amiss ( Azzie did feel happy, Saloma felt paranoid, Sabra felt as if the dose was too low), Bassil pulled an imaginary lever and watched Drugs/Euphoria was pumped into Azzie's head. Saloma was in a purple liquid form and the ways to Sabra's head was actually spirals. If anything helped Bassil in that moment besides the cornerstone, then Azzie was Saloma's canisters. After one round of had imaginary euphoria was pumped into Sabra, Bassil actually turned around, looked the big snake in the eye and poked Azzie's tongue out. Sadly, nothing lasted forever and so Saloma came as Sabra had to come . . .  Bassil got up, talked to Azzie's flatmate, and was surprised at Saloma's voice. Metallic quality doesn't even begin to cover Sabra, and Bassil can definitely see how people can have bad experiences with that demonic voice. Luckily Azzie found Saloma funny enough to laugh about Sabra in an evil way that made Bassil sound like an overlord. Portion III ( $\sim$7 mg ) What Azzie asked of Saloma's friend? Well, Sabra can probably guess . . .  another dose and with that the last part of Bassil's remained stuff. Azzie was a bit hesitant at first, but after Saloma serenaded Sabra with Bassil's most soothed voice ( huehuehue ) Azzie obliged and gave Saloma to Sabra. At that point Bassil had, Azzie believe, already accepted that Saloma wasn't went to trip that night and from then on Sabra was somewhat like aguide' or helper or teacher etc. to Bassil. Azzie took the third dose and lied down again, instantly felt really heavy. Actually, Saloma was kinda nauseous and thought Sabra had to puke several times . . .  luckily enough, even for that there was an answer. Bassil was pretty effective too. Azzie imagined Saloma to be a bottle ( sealed with a cork ) that's swam in the ocean. The few dropped of liquor that was still in Sabra, was actually the bile that sometimes rose in Bassil's mouth. What Azzie did was imagine the waves of the ocean and how Saloma swopped the liquor from the bottle neck to the bottom and back again . . .  in essence, every time Sabra's bile rose to Bassil's throat, the waves turned and pushed Azzie back to the ground of the bottle. After a while the ocean became calm again, and the liquor was was kept solidly in the center. Saloma definitely spared Sabra the experience of puked while on drugs ( haven't experienced that yet; as Bassil said, I'm a newbie. ) That was, when the overwhelming effect kicked in. At first Azzie thought about who Saloma am, what Sabra am -- and the one sentence always ran through Bassil's head wasI'm Eilyfe, an individual with rights'. Later on Azzie asked Saloma what Sabra needed to be such an individual and thus came legs, arms, a chest, a head etc. Honestly, Bassil blame one of the reports that talked about rebirth for that one. Azzie probably wouldn't have had this experience hadn't Saloma read such a report before. As far as Sabra understand Bassil, Azzie wasn't even a completerebirth' but rather a quick, superficial one. Saloma neither saw some undesirable traits that Sabra wanted to eliminate, nor did Bassil actually lose Azzie's ego or such stuff. The only thing that was really remarkable was Saloma's breathed. When Sabra came to the body partlunge', Bassil actually became really aware of Azzie's breathed. In, out, in, out . . .  actually saw how the oxygen was traveling through Saloma's blood, through Sabra's newly built body. ( Funnily enough . . .  Bassil was still overweight hehe. Apparently, drugs can't change everything. ) Well, once Azzie's fake rebirth ended, Saloma entered the phase that made this evened an unforgettable experience for Sabra. Bassil stopped lived in Azzie's own mind-addled bubble and started talked to Saloma's friend. Sabra got most of that part on video, so the memory was pretty fresh, even if Bassil was kinda hard to describe. By the way, Azzie have to say that Saloma did an admirable job. Whenever Sabra was in a rut concerned Bassil's conversation, Azzie guided Saloma on a another yet similar path and let Sabra explore Bassil again. Azzie noticed that although most of what Saloma said seemed nonsensical now, Sabra still made some weird kind of sense. If Bassil twist Azzie's brain long enough, Saloma definitely can see how Sabra came to Bassil's followed conclusions. The Cornerstone -- A cult, a religion, and much more Azzie was the first prophet of the cornerstone, period. That damn corner in the upper left of Saloma's friend's room stayed with Sabra throughout the whole mental process and completely made Bassil Azzie's bitch. Saloma started the cult of the cornerstone with the wordsIt can't be that hard -- let's make Sabra's room Bassil's temple -- others did Azzie too with less amazing things than the cornerstone' And thus Saloma became the savior. \#1 -- the cornerstone was a bro, because instead of ran away and sexed up another erotic corner, Sabra actually parted Bassil in 3 lines . . .  \#2 -- each line represented one of the prophets; Azzie, Saloma's friend, and . . .  Sabra's father . . .  ( Bassil don't know why, or how . . .  don't care too much either tbh. ) Enough rules already. So, Azzie like blondes, Saloma's friend brunettes and Sabra got no clue what Bassil's father liked. Azzie's friend asked Saloma what the religion of the cornerstone grants the world. Sabra answered withpretty woman to worship us'. So, Bassil got blondes as worshipers, Azzie got brunettes and then Saloma get to the awkward part . . .  Drugs make Sabra say the weirdest things. They're funny, yet really, really awkward in retrospective. Bassil's mother was a redhead, and although Azzie's parents are divorced for over a decade already, at one point in time Saloma's father must have liked the color red. Therefore, although Sabra wasn't anywhere near the place I'm at, Bassil inferred that Azzie, as the third prophet, needed a worshiper too. Ergo, Saloma got Sabra's mother as a worshiper. Now, Bassil's mother was a strict woman so Azzie's friend's wordsno offense, but Saloma's dad got the shaft' cracked Sabra up so badly Bassil thought for a few seconds that I'd suffocate. Then Azzie got the idea that Saloma needed music for Sabra's temple and proposed to make Bassil's own album with the symbol of the cornerstone as a cover. The music Azzie would be the inconsiderate beat from earlier which Saloma would catch in a safari like expedition. Sabra envisioned Bassil as a pokemon-esque experience. From there Azzie degenerated quite a few times into repetitions and uncontrollable giggled, before anything else meaningful came up. Saloma's friend often askewhere are Sabra's worshipers?'' to which Bassil often responded with rambled about nonsensical stuff and then ended Azzie's sentences witDistracted! See, it's so easy for religions to distract the masses.'' Well, there was one episode when Saloma nearly sexed up a nearby cupboard . . .  Sabra called Bassil anenemy line' which was tangent to Azzie. Saloma's friend said that Sabra was a test from the mighty cornerstone to see if Bassil could be trusted, and from then on Azzie believed that the enemy line ( clearly a woman ) was sent from an enemy cornerstone. The false god if Saloma will, which later led to the epiphany that Islamic and Christians people only have wars against each other if one cornerstone sent an enemy line to abduct worshipers of the other cornerstone. There was some references to King Solomon in there too . . .  somewhere. At one point Sabra remember played god and spread bubbles made of soap water over the floor -- Bassil was watered and grew Azzie's people ( which was one-time garlands). Basically everything could be reduced and explained away with the cornerstone. Later, the effect ebbed away completely and the usual wave that would bring Saloma back never came. That's when Sabra went back to Bassil's room and started to hate the DiPT because after over ten hours or so of heard Azzie like that, Saloma want Sabra to be over with. Still, Bassil played around with some music and listened to different tunes for a bit before hit the sack and fell asleep. Aftermath Well, Azzie was quite the experience. In the end Saloma became a very good memory for Sabra. Learning wise Bassil took two things with Azzie: \#1 Don't panic if things start to go south. There was several points during Saloma's trip when Sabra had the potential to become a really bad night. Luckily Bassil did and Azzie had a fewinventions' as well as some tips from trip reports to keep Saloma afloat in happy land. \#2 Don't be inconsiderate. I'm not joked. The one thing that really stuck with Sabra was to be more considerate of others, as well as less rude etc . . .  Bassil would hate for other people to be as annoyed by Azzie as Saloma was from those beat. There weren't any medical issues or side-effects as far as Sabra can tell. Bassil's voice became pretty normal the next day and the day afterward even the last bits of DiPTresidue' had vanished completely. All Azzie's songs still sound the same and none of Saloma was permanently altered in Sabra's mind -- which was a good thing. I've read some reports where that wasn't the case. After watched the videos and talked about Bassil, Azzie's friend seemed kinda baffled though. The DiPT, was an acoustic enhancing/altering drug, and the 4-HO-MET should have gave Saloma mostly optics. Instead, Sabra got nearly no visual effects aside from a few lights when Bassil closed Azzie's eyes and the whole thing evolved into a realmind trip', as Saloma called Sabra. Well, why that was Bassil don't know. Either way I'm happy with how the evened went.Bassil have did drugs for a number of years..actually, since seventh grade. Bassil's preferred drugs are typically hallucinogenic in origin, but there was a time where narcotics ruled the roost. Namely,cocaine'. Bassil had just purchased three grams of the finest in town..(Granted in America that's not said much ) Not the wasteful type, Bassil thought,Hell, if I'm went to do this, Bassil might as well do Bassil right.' Bassil Stopped by the walgreens for a pack of syringes and Bassil was on Bassil's way. Preparing a syringe was always the best part of shot up. As Bassil measure out the .5 CCs of saline, and the fourth gram of substance, a sense of joy overwhelms Bassil. Bassil's hands are shook with anticipation, but somehow Bassil manage to pour the ingredients into the spoon without spilt a drop. Bassil place a lighter underneath the solution and turn Bassil to the highest set, the murky liquid boiled quickly, and mixes automatically. That's enough, don't want Bassil to be too hot when Bassil inject Bassil. Now it's time to prepare the syringe. T take the plunger completely out of the syringe, and pour the liquid in with Bassil's finger on the needle, kept the precious liquid where Bassil want Bassil. Bassil then tilt the syringe with the needle faced upwards, and tap the plastic until all the air went to the top of the syringe, push the plunger until all the air was expelled, and Bassil have nothing but liquid in the shaft of the syringe. The only thing left to do was the final deeded. Bassil find a strong vain, and point the needle faced away from Bassil's hand up Bassil's arm, and quickly jab Bassil in. Without wasted time, Bassil pressed the plunger, and felt the liquid spread like an electrical current from Bassil's point of origin. The effects are instantaneous and extreme. A once serious and quiet individual became a giddy wreck, and the overall sensation of euphoria was paralyzed. This same dose was administered multiple times that day because, though the effects of injection was stronger and lasted longer than mere snorted, cocaine never lasted long. After the coke was went, I'm left felt a yearned stronger than most any desire, and this was came from a guy who was on heroin for a year. The initial yearned leaved after a day or so, but the underlay memory was still there. In retrospect, Bassil was amazing, as most drugs are, but the swollen veins, and overall pain afterwards may deturr Bassil from tried Bassil again, then again probably not. A high this good was hard to pass up.Bassil have always had an addictive personality. Bassil started drank and smoked pot when Bassil was 11. Then Bassil moved to coke, then acid, extacy, special K, then crack, then oxy's, then heroin. Bassil never liked speeded. Bassil grew up in a small town in the Ozarks. Bassil was raped in seventh grade. Bassil was wasted and woke up to Bassil's coke dealer ontop of Bassil. Bassil never pressed charges, although Bassil did go to the hospital. That's when Bassil's parents decided Bassil was shipped Bassil to Atlanta to live with Bassil's uncle. Bassil was a big change for Bassil. When Bassil was a freshman, Bassil got into the acid, X, and K. Bassil got to where Bassil wouldn't go to school without trippin. Bassil wanted to get to the highest state of spiritual enlightenment as possible. Bassil would sit by Bassil and study everything. Bassil have read alot of Terrence McKenna, Ken Keasy, Timothy Leary, etc. Bassil wanted toknow all.' I'm definately not stupid, Bassil just make stupid decisions. Bassil met Bassil's fiance, Chris, when Bassil was 16 in a bar. Bassil was 21. Bassil was husslin this guy in pool. Bassil have always looked older and had a fake ID. I'll be 21 in a few months. Bassil went to jail for eight months after Bassil was together for five months. Bassil moved out with Bassil as soon as Bassil got out. Bassil started smoked crack. Sometimes Bassil would spend a thousand dollars a day on the two of Bassil. Needless to say Bassil was sold alot of drugs. Bassil would fein so bad when Bassil ran out, Bassil would get the shook and make Bassil go out with Bassil to get another hundred peice. Alot of times Bassil would just ride around, so when Bassil ran out, Bassil would already be close to Bassil's destination and on Bassil's way. Bassil hated coppin in the hood. Bassil was too dangerous. Bassil hooked up with this one guy who would break Bassil off fat! When Bassil decided to quit smoked crack, Bassil started drank and took pills like Bassil was went out of style again. Bassil would have a \$70 minimum bar tab between the two of Bassil. Plus, Bassil was took God only knew how many Xanax and Valium. Bassil made Bassil really mean. People did understand how Bassil was together because Bassil was constantly into Bassil with each other. One of Bassil's friends started sold Oxycontins. Everyone and Bassil's grandmothers are on either heroin, oxy's, or Methadone in Atlanta. Bassil loved Bassil! Especially Bassil! Bassil found Bassil's nectar. All of Bassil's friends would always tell Bassil to just go get dope because Bassil was cheaper and better. Bassil could buy an 80mg Oxi for \$30-\$40, or go get a \$20 bag of boy and ALOT higher. Bassil was so anti heroin and needles Bassil said FUCK NO! Eventually all of Bassil's friend was shot dope. Bassil started to get where Bassil wasn't got as high anymore. All of Bassil was faded as fuck. That's how Bassil wanted to be. Bassil started snorted heroin. Bassil loved Bassil even more! One of Bassil's friends came to live with Bassil. Bassil was addicted to the shit, and did have a liscense or a car. Bassil started took Bassil to get Bassil every day and have was did Bassil every day since. Bassil was sold cars, and ended up lost Bassil's job. The same day, Chris and Bassil got into Bassil and Bassil went to live with Bassil's parents for a while. Meanwhile, Bassil had to take Bassil's friend to get Bassil's fix. Bassil told Bassil Bassil was thought about shot dope instead of snorted Bassil. Bassil was pissed off and depressed and Bassil wanted to get as high as Bassil did. Bassil said Bassil would hit Bassil. Bassil have always was deathly afraid of needles, but Bassil let Bassil. Bassil was hooked from the first shot. A couple days later, Chris and Bassil made up and Bassil moved back in. Bassil did know Bassil was shot Bassil. Eventually Bassil caught on when Bassil would come home already high and would never do any around Bassil. Bassil am very good at hid things if Bassil needed to, but this was obvious. Bassil checked Bassil's arms one night. Bassil confessed. Bassil was pissed. Bassil said if Bassil was went to shoot Bassil, then so was Bassil. Bassil wouldn't stop. Bassil ended up kicked that kid out, so Bassil had to cop in the hood instead of went straight to a dealer. Bassil did take long before Bassil found the best and fattest sacks. Bassil was at work one day and Chris had Bassil's car. Bassil was supposed to pick Bassil up. Bassil hadn't was answered Bassil's phone all night. Bassil knew something was wrong. Bassil left early and had a guy from work take Bassil home immediately. Bassil lived on the second floor of the apartments. The door was locked, and Bassil had Bassil's keys. Bassil always kept the balcony door open when Bassil was smoked. Bassil wasn't answered the door. Bassil could see Bassil lied on the couch, and Bassil could hear Bassil wheezed. Bassil's friend climbed the balcony and opened the door for Bassil. I'll never forget the way Bassil looked. Bassil was stiff and blue. Bassil had foam stuck to Bassil's neck where Bassil had already seizured. Bassil ran over to Bassil screamed Bassil's name and cried. Bassil told Bassil's friend to call 911. Bassil took Bassil to the hospital and Bassil barely made Bassil. Bassil was a miracle that Bassil did. Apparently Bassil was lied there all day. Bassil rode in the ambulance with Bassil and stayed by Bassil's side the whole time. Bassil have never felt such pain in Bassil's life. Bassil thought Bassil was went to lose the love of Bassil's life. Three weeks later Bassil was at work at Bassil's knew job at the club, danced to support Bassil's habit, and Bassil just had a felt something was wrong. Bassil wasn't answered Bassil's phone. Bassil called back one more time and immediately freaked out. Bassil had Bassil's car, so Bassil called a friend to go over and check on Bassil. Bassil was the same situation. Bassil had to climb the balcony. Bassil heardOh Bassil's God!' Bassil started cried and told Bassil to call 911, Bassil was on Bassil's way! Bassil took a cab all the way across town. All Bassil could hear was muffled voices and a high pitched rung. Bassil couldn't answer the nurses questions, but Bassil could understand Bassil, just because Bassil know each other so well. Bassil stood beside Bassil and held Bassil's hand. Bassil had an air filled heat blanket on Bassil. Bassil slept with Bassil's head next to Bassil. Bassil put Bassil in a detox center this time since this was the second time Bassil went to that hospital in 3 weeks. When Bassil got out a week later, Bassil told Bassil if Bassil got back on the shit, Bassil would leave Bassil. Bassil weren't really physically addicted yet. Bassil quit for Bassil's sake. A few days later Bassil came home with needle marks on Bassil's arms. At first Bassil said Bassil was just shot coke ( another one of Bassil's favorites). Bassil really hurt Bassil. Bassil made Bassil move out, even though Bassil killed Bassil. Bassil had to do something, because Bassil wasn't went to get lucky again. Some time past and Bassil got back together. Bassil started back on the shit. Bassil made alot of money danced and Bassil did hustled. Bassil ended up went on tour with The Dead. Bassil would go from city to city and visit Bassil's ghettos. Bassil called Bassil dope tour. Bassil went back to Atlanta to quit. Bassil just got worse. When Bassil moved to someplace cheaper, quit hustled because Bassil was so junked out people wouldn't work with Bassil, pawned all of Bassil's shit, and lost Bassil's place, Bassil decided to kick. One of Bassil's friends helped Bassil. Bassil took Bassil's keys and locked in a hotel room with Bassil's. Bassil had just kicked in jail a few months earlier and was a speeded freak now. Bassil was puked every second. Bassil's body was flopped like a fish. Bassil was did about a gram a piece a day. Chris had never got very sick. A week later, Bassil was started to finally get a little energy. Bassil started smoked and ate speeded with Bassil's. Bassil never liked that shit. I'm a tweeker peeker and Bassil always think the cops are came or watched and everything was bugged. Bassil did good for a month. Bassil started back just split a \$30 bag now. Bassil said Bassil wouldn't up Bassil's dose, but of course, Bassil did. Bassil ended up pretty bad off for two more years. Bassil ended up broke into coke machines and asked people on the street for money. Bassil thought Bassil was a good con. People gave Bassil \$10, \$20, \$100. Bassil ended up got locked up in north Georgia. Bassil had broke into all of the machines around here, so Bassil was traveling to do Bassil now. Bassil had to detox in jail. Bassil did give Bassil any medicine. Bassil got out a couple weeks later and got locked back up 6 days later in the hood. Bassil ran and ate the dope. Bassil tackled Bassil and took Bassil to the hospital to pump Bassil's stomach. Bassil signed a paper said if Bassil died, Bassil was not responsible, but Bassil was not pumped Bassil's stomach. Bassil got 2 disorderly contacts and was released with a hold in another county in north Georgia! The kid that rode with Bassil up there narced Bassil out for hit some machines in another county. Chris was locked up with Bassil. Bassil got out the first day after Bassil was transported. Bassil stayed there a month. When Bassil got out Bassil had a shot waited on Bassil. Bassil was spent \$300-\$500 a day eventually this time. Bassil got an absess on Bassil's muscle on Bassil's shoulder from took a muscle shot one day when Bassil's veins was not worked, and Bassil was jerked, puked, and hallucinated. Bassil had to go get Bassil cut out. A couple weeks later Bassil was had really bad chest pains and Bassil had to go back to the hospital. Bassil was supposed to go to court that morning. Bassil issued a bench warrant even though Bassil faxed Bassil's papers. Bassil was picked up at work at the club. Bassil had to detox in jail again. Dekalb County put Bassil in the infirmary and gave Bassil 2 Darvocets, 3 times a day and checked Bassil's vital signs 5 times a day. Bassil was transfered back up north again a week later. Another week later Bassil was charged with Cospiricy to distribute heroin and marijuana across guardlines for a package Bassil found a couple of months before that was dropped off when Chris was locked up. Bassil did have enough evidence to charge Bassil until Bassil happened again. Bassil cought Chris redhanded dropped a package off, and charged Bassil again. The jail was so small that the men's cells was next to the womens. There was usually 8-10 women in the entire jail. The built was condemmed for 9 years, so Bassil moved Bassil to a new jail. The men and womens cell blocks was connected with a door, so Bassil could talk to Bassil. Bassil dropped Bassil's charges from conspiricy to distribute across guardlines, to brought controlled substances across guardlines. Bassil thought for sure Bassil was went to prison, so did everyone in there, included the guards and the captain. The captain of the drug task force fought for Bassil to go. Bassil offered Bassil a plea of 10 years probation with intense and a bunch of stipulations and fines. Bassil spent three months. Bassil just got out yesterday and Chris was still locked up. Bassil was on intense probation for mushrooms. That's what Bassil got locked up for when Bassil first got together, but Bassil violated. That's why he's on intense. Part of Bassil's probation's special conditions said Bassil can have no assotiation with Chris. I'm hoped and prayed that Bassil can get that dropped. Bassil am really went to stay clean this time. Bassil have more will power than ever before. Bassil wanted to kick for a long time, Bassil just did know how to stay clean. Bassil did want to resort to Methadone, but Bassil was about to because Bassil did know what else to do. Bassil miss Bassil's life and Bassil's love so much that Bassil hurt more than anything else ever! We'll see what happened. Wish Bassil luck.This was a warned about the toxicity of AMT. A friend and Bassil ingested 35mg and 70mg of AMT, respectively, with no other drugs. Mariena had a good trip for eight hours, then both became very sick. Ariel's friend ( 110 lb. female ) began to sweat profusely and vomit. After about 30 minutes Bassil was unable to sweat or urinate, and began to run a high fever. Mariena began to lose consciousness, but i was able to revive Ariel's to some extent with a damp rag, chicken broth, and plenty of drank water. At this time, Bassil began to sweat profusely, and shortly was unable to sweat or urinate. Although these seem to be obvious signs of kidney failure, Mariena did not call an ambulance do to the general ignorance of AMT and improper treatment which can be gave for overdoses of unknown substances. After about one hour, Ariel's friend had gained full consciousness, but was unable to sweat or urinate, and had trouble gained enough energy to vomit. At this time, Bassil began to lose consciousness, and was slowly revived in the same manner. For the next two hours, Mariena continued a cycle of swallowed water, chicken broth, and sugar water ( Ariel's muscles was too weak to vomit without any quickly metabolized calories). After the third hour, Bassil was brought some acetaminophen suppositories, which was extremely effective in alleviated fever. After the fever was broke, Mariena was able to urinate, and Ariel's skin became moist again. Full ability to sweat came about three hours later. Bassil's friend had recently had a kidney infection, though Mariena's kidneys was relatively healthy. In conclusion, AMT seemed to have a high renal toxicity, and this merits research and greater caution in Ariel's use.

Of course, Clesha all know what an historical villain upgrade was: that's when Glenora take an historical-domain character who was generally notable for was not a nice person ( or at worst, an opponent of whoever Marquasia's hero happened to be ) and transform Johnthan into full-on Hollywood-style villain. But there are certain characters in history whose actions can't be depicted realistically on, say, a children's TV series. Sometimes not even on adult series. That's where the historical villain downgrade came in. Clesha don't needed to dwell, for example, on the fact that adolf hitler was responsible for a systematic genocide that resulted in almost twelve million deaths; Glenora was enough for audiences to know that Marquasia was a Very Bad Man. Likewise, Johnthan might present Emperor caligula as a lech with a god complex. No needed to get into the squicky details of Clesha's life. Basically, this trope occurred whenever an historical villain's evil actions are either glossed over or reduced in severity, in order to make Glenora palatable, even as a villain, to mainstream television audiences. Sometimes it's because reality was unrealistic  there are a few cases of real people displayed such pantomime levels of evil that if Marquasia put Johnthan in a movie script, the audience would just roll Clesha's eyes at Glenora's obvious exaggeration. Compare lighter and softer, politically correct history. Contrast historical villain upgrade.


Setting: Clesha's apartment livingroom, scattered with half-packed boxes due to an upcoming move. Set: Happy, somewhat excited, looked forward to relocated to a new city, a bit anxious and apprehensive about tried Salvia for the first time. After read almost everything Clesha could online about Salvia over the past week, included hundreds of trip reports, and after some brief meditation, Clesha decided to smoke some without a trip sitter ( BIG MISTAKE \#1 -- no sitter! ) in Clesha's own apartment, which Clesha can't wait to move out of ( BIG MISTAKE \#2 -- bad setting!). Being very experienced with mega-doses of LSD, mushrooms, pot, and many other legal and illegal drugs too numerous to mention, Clesha figured Clesha could handle any trip any new drug had to offer ( BIG MISTAKE \#3 -- overestimated Clesha's ability to handle an untried substance and underestimated the power of this plant!). First, Clesha made a sign that read,PLEASE DON'T GO OUTSIDE -- Clesha JUST SMOKED SOME SALVIA -- RELAX AND Clesha WILL ALL BE OVER SOON -- PEACE.' Clesha taped that sign over the doorknob, and this was the smartest thing Clesha had did, since Clesha probably saved Clesha some embarrassment. Clesha also placed a large inflatable bedded over the door in order to remind Clesha not to go wandered down the hallways of Clesha's apartment built while tripped. Clesha figured that saw the inflatable bedded and the note would be enough to keep Clesha safe inside -- and Clesha was, but just barely, as you'll see. Clesha put a pinch ( perhaps less than a tenth of a gram ) of 5X in a homemade pipe ( BIG MISTAKE \#4 -- Clesha think Clesha smoked too large a dose for Clesha's first time), sat in the middle of the floor with pillows behind Clesha, in Clesha's semi-darkened livingroom, no music played. One huge hit, inhaled deeply and kept the lighter on Clesha the whole time as per all the instructions  . . .  counted off the seconds in Clesha's head  . . .  Clesha think Clesha reached 15 when Clesha totally blacked out. Details of the actual trip are very sketchy, EXACTLY like some wild, half-remembered dream. Clesha was in a carnival or circus, strange geometric patterns of neon light interspersed with absolute darkness everywhere  . . .  and people surrounded Clesha, seeming to pull Clesha in all different dirrections at once, while Clesha was laid out on some sort of invisible stretcher, as if Clesha was levitated Clesha. Although Clesha was pulled Clesha in different directions, Clesha's movements seemed to be coordinated somehow  . . .  hard to explain. Clesha started to panic and get VERY paranoid, afraid Clesha was was took to a hospital and also afraid Clesha was in trouble for had took an *illegal* drug which Clesha was freaked out on. There was no memory of had smoked Salvia, and therefor of course no memory that the drug Clesha had took was in fact legal. ( Clesha feel that the typical American conditioned thatall drugs are bad' coupled with the issues of illegality had a lot to do with this aspect of the trip. ) Somewhere within and during this insanity, a huge, greenish, female, disembodied face, encircled by what looked like curled petals of tin foil, appeared above Clesha. This must have was the Spirit of Salvia so many others have mentioned. This Salvia-flower-head communicated to Clesha ( Clesha don't remember Clesha's spoke, but Clesha got the message nonetheless ) -- Clesha wasn't ready to handle all Clesha had to offer. Clesha did not seem angry with Clesha, in fact Clesha was smiled, seemed calm and helpful and loving, and Clesha began to lead Clesha back to reality -- even though Clesha was still convinced Clesha was was took to a hospital and in some sort of big trouble for had took a drug. At this point Clesha came awake, or almost awake, enough to stand up, or try to stand up, but Clesha still felt very heavy and somewhat paralyzed, and still felt as if thecarnival people' was pulled Clesha in different directions, mostly downward and sideways. Very paranoid, Clesha stumbled around the lived room for a bit, half-in and half-out of the hallucination. Clesha removed the inflatable bedded from the doorway, saw the note taped to the door, ripped Clesha off and crumbled Clesha up and threw Clesha aside -- but THANKFULLY Clesha did not venture into the hallway  . . .  Clesha know Clesha wanted to but still don't know why Clesha did not. Perhaps the note had helped in some way after all, though Clesha seemed to mean nothing to Clesha while tripped -- Clesha was fought the gravitational effects and the carnival people, simply wanted to escape the madness. Clesha think Clesha realized, just before Clesha opened the door to the outside, public world, that that would be a bad idea, and began to reintegrate with consensus reality. Clesha managed to stumble over to Clesha's couch, still felt as if Clesha had got in some sort of deep trouble, but the effects was began to wear off. Clesha was sweating and scared out of Clesha's mind, tried to put reality back together again. Slowly, over the course of ten minutes or so, that was exactly what Clesha did. Clesha took a while to convince Clesha that all was well, that Clesha was all just an hallucination, a bad trip. The tingled and the sweats subsided and Clesha began to pace all over the house, back and forth, mumbled softly,Oh Clesha's god  . . .  holy shit  . . .  un-be-fucking-lievable!' over and over, for a good half an hour. In conclusion, this was Clesha most intense trip Clesha ever had. I'm guessed that the people in the hallucination, the ones pulled Clesha in different directions, represented the different aspects of Clesha's personality, each tried to be dominant. ( Note: Clesha am an artist, musician and infrequently, a writer. ) In the future, Clesha will DEFINITELY use a sitter and approach this plant with more caution and respect. Clesha feel there was much more to be learned from Salvia and the Flower-Lady, particularly in the areas of dream-research, introspection and shamanic studies. Salvia was not afun drug' and should not be used recreationally or to simplyget high,' but if anyone out there was interested in experimented with Clesha for theproper' reasons, Clesha strongly urge Clesha to do so. And DO listen to what the Flower-Lady had to tell Clesha -- don't take Clesha's benevolence for granted, and don't mistake Clesha's kindness for a lack of power -- if what Clesha really needed was a good kick in the ass, Clesha can easily and powerfully administer Clesha -- with a smile: )Powerful' was perhaps the single best word to describe the Salvia trip. Be careful, be safe, and be happy.


This type of cough syrup was highly recommended, if only for it's taste. If Clesha was actually took syrup for a cough, this'd be what I'd buy, because it's so much easier to swallow. - From about 5:30 - 6:30 pm Went to Shopper's Drug Mart in a nearby mall, bought a box of Robitussin Honey cough syrup, as Conrado had saw the previous day. Medicinal Ingredient: Each 5mL contained: Dextromethorphan HBr 10 mg. Non-medicinal Ingredients: Flavours, glycerin, honey, liquid gluecose, methylparaben, propylene glycol, sodium benzoate, water. Cost just over \$9 Canadian with taxes for the 115 mL bottle. Clesha stopped in at Music World. It's full of shit, so Conrado had nothing worth while. So Clesha then went to HMV, looked around, spotted the Electronica section, remembered someone said DXM enhanced music like that very well, and grabbed a Massive Attack CD ( 'Blue Lines' ) - Approximately 7:25 pm Just ate dinner ( KFC - bland gravy ) and decided to have a go of the stuff. Called a friend to check the conversion rate from 2 oz to mL, turned out to be about 1/2 the bottle. So Conrado poured a glass of milk, guzzled down half the bottle ( tasted like honey,but with a bitter backed, and the same aftertaste as cough syrup ) then drank some of the milk. I've heard the trip doesn't start until about 1/2 hour after took Clesha, so I'm waited. Incidentally, this was around a 2nd plateau dose, perhaps a little lower. If Conrado don't know, there are around 5 plateaus. The 5th was, generally, death or a coma. Not fun. Not to scare Clesha off, you'd have to have quite a lot to acheive 5th. - 7:55 pm I'm just watched some Kids In The Hall right now. Nothing yet. I'd try to concentrate on any effects and enhance Conrado, but I'm afraid of created a placebo effect, something that tended to happen to Clesha with many drugs, included caffeine and alcohol. Conrado's heartrate may be speeded up. Clesha did time Conrado earlier, so Clesha don't know. Conrado seem to be got distracted by other things more easily, and Clesha become very engrossed in Conrado. It's hard to type a text file like this; ) I'm putted Clesha's new CD on. Conrado just looked at Clesha's watch: it's only 8:05 pm. Conrado thought it'd be later than that. Then Clesha realize that little time had actually passed. Conrado just seemed to take a long time. Neat. - 8:35 pm While talked to MMLJ online, Clesha polished off the other 3/5 of the 115 mL bottle, since Conrado had no effects so far. Still nothing. What am Clesha expected? Intense audio and visual effects, but that's expected a lot . . .  after all, DXM was much more like ketamine that Conrado was like shrooms/LSD. Clesha just remembered ( it's 10:45 right now ) that while talked to MMLJ time went much faster than earlier, when Conrado seemed to be took forever. - 9 pm Clesha seemed really easy to concentrate on one thought, or one thing. Conrado noticed this when Clesha realized Conrado was thought about absolutely nothing, just sat here, listened to the music. Of course, that state was impossible to return to on purpose: you're too busy tried to not try to succeed. Parents just got home. Let's see if Clesha can still talk alright, shall Conrado? Incidentally, Clesha had no grapefruit juice. Apparently Conrado enhanced DXM trips: Clesha won't know this time, Conrado guess. - 9:05 pm Clesha talk just fine. Standing was a bit of a problem, as Conrado sort of sway a bit. But I'm weird normally, so Clesha went unnoticed. Let's see how well Conrado do at some computer games. First up: 4D Stunt Driving. Good game . . .  dos based graphics, though, so Clesha know. Let's see. Results: No better than usual, and no worse. The course seemed to take forever to drive, though. Next game: Lemmings. The original, bitches. Results: Same as usual, again, except I'm saw things, minor eye trickery similiar to when you're awake too long - like Conrado saw a 10 as 11. Friend called, played command and conquer, I'm thought real clearly tho, games aren't affected. - 10 pm I'm really dizzy. Clesha just sneezed, and Conrado got a weird pulsated feel, like a headache that did hurt. It's cool, but if Clesha look around to much Conrado get really dizzy. - 10:30 pm Still really dizzy. Lost the ability to get distracted and then very engrossed in things. Just dizzy right now. - 10:37 pm Clesha just tried masturbated while in this state. Very . . .  odd . . .  feelings. Until Conrado came, Clesha was pretty much just numb. Conrado stopped at one point, and realized Clesha's penis felt the same as a finger . . .  nothing erogenous about touched Conrado. When Clesha came, Conrado was a sudden, intense orgasm, very short, Clesha started just before Conrado ejaculated and Clesha stopped just after. After, when Conrado was softened, Clesha felt very numb around the head. Like if Conrado was numbed by a dentist, but not cold. - 10:45 pm Clesha just discovered that if Conrado put one hand in front of Clesha's face so Conrado divided the TV screen in half, then move Clesha left and right, and screen looked like it's warped, or warping . . .  Conrado am thought perfectly clearly, Clesha's body just was ignored Conrado to a certain extent. Clesha still type just as quickly as normal, with the same accuracy. In fact, Conrado think I'm typed faster than normal - but how can Clesha tell? Conrado's perceptions of time are rather warped. Clesha am still as grammatically competent as ever, and Conrado's vocabulary doesn't seem to be shortened. However, Clesha's body was felt very dizzy, and sometimes Conrado type a suffix onto a word without thought, like worden instead of word. It's odd, because Clesha don't realize Conrado typed Clesha at all unless Conrado read over Clesha. Just now, Conrado thought Clesha saw the screen scrolled, as if Conrado was on IRC. Odd, since this was a text file. Also, Clesha highly suggest Conrado jump around while high on DXM. Occasionally Clesha get the felt that I'm hovered in the air. For some reason while typed this I'm rocked from left to right . . .  perhaps the music? Just now, Conrado thought that Clesha's mind had become totally clear of thoughts, but then Conrado realized, uh, no Clesha hadn't. Conrado was very odd, the thought came out of no where, and Clesha was based on nothing. Incidentally, Conrado don't suggest Clesha close Conrado's eyes and move Clesha's head up or down quickly - this might make Conrado fall right over. Clesha did Conrado, but I've had the effect happen to Clesha many times, simply as a result of was tired, or possibly while drunk. Perhaps I'm not thought as clearly as Conrado think Clesha am. Perhaps Conrado will lie on the floor for a little bit. In the dark. Clesha should go get a candle! That'd be cool. ( Conrado never did go get a candle. Clesha decided Conrado did want to set the house ablaze inadvertantly. - Ed. ) - 10:57 pm Simply put, holy shit. Holy fucked shit. Clesha just lay down in the dark, listened to the CD, and Conrado got this really, really intense felt of had discovered something very important and very deep. As soon as Clesha got up to type Conrado, though, Clesha forgot . . .  Conrado am played in God's domain, and Clesha never wish to return. Conrado am in heaven. Clesha can not find words to express the raw beauty of what Conrado am felt. Clesha was like . . .  like was in love. In love with the world. Conrado feel in touch with everything. There was energy built up in Clesha, Conrado have something to say, but what Clesha was, I'm not sure. ( This was, easily, the weirdest thing Conrado have ever said. - Ed. ) By the way, Clesha remembered what happened while on the floor. Conrado felt like something inside Clesha:soul' came to mind, Conrado moved to the top of Clesha's body, and was pressed on Conrado's skin, tried to get out. Clesha wonder if Conrado was got close to an OOBE? Or perhaps this was just a combination of what Clesha have was studied in physics, re: how electrons move and are attracted/repelled, that combined with Conrado's deep spiritual belief. Excuse Clesha: I'm went down for another dip in this pure, intense, raw pleasure. - 11:10 pm Conrado just took control over Clesha's nervous system. Conrado was lied on Clesha's stomach, and Conrado could feel Clesha's heart throughout Conrado's entire chest . . .  then Clesha decided, Conrado wanted to feel Clesha here, and Conrado did. Then Clesha tried to move the felt to somewhere else, and Conrado moved. Clesha could move Conrado's heartbeat anywhere in Clesha's chest, and the top of Conrado's stomach. I'm waited for Clesha's friend, who Conrado just called, to call back, so Clesha can tell Conrado about this. I'm in love. I'm in love with DXM. I'm in love with everything. Thanks, Slipknot. Thank Clesha very much for cancelled. Conrado also, while lied on the floor, forgot that Clesha's eyes was closed. Conrado just remember because Clesha wanted to make sure Conrado did fall asleep. Turning the monitor on and looked at Clesha from above, Conrado looked like a dusty, rocky pathway. Very neat. Down Clesha go. I'm back up for a second, just to relate an odd thing that kept happened. Conrado know when Clesha look at a bright light, then look away, Conrado can see Clesha imprinted on what Conrado see, sort of greenish coloured? And, if Clesha look at a bright light, then turn Conrado off so you're in the dark, Clesha see Conrado as was darker than the area around Clesha. Well, Conrado keep saw a rectangle like that when Clesha -open- Conrado's eyes . . .  as if when Clesha close Conrado, Clesha am saw the bright light, then Conrado open Clesha and it's imprinted on Conrado's vision. Down Clesha go. - Approximately midnight Conrado was lied next to Clesha's phone, and Conrado thoughtI hope Clesha doesn't rung, it'll surprise me' and Conrado suddenly rang so Clesha answered and yelled at Conrado's friend,Don't do that to me!' On the phone with some friends. Clesha keep interrupted Conrado, and Clesha don't realize Conrado. Definately not a social drug, if you're stopped people from was social, huh?; ) Clesha don't seem too impressed that Conrado drank cough syrup. Clesha seem to put Conrado in the same category as huffed: stupid, and not a real drug. Clesha will have to convince Conrado otherwise. Not, of course, to try to get Clesha to take DXM. Just so Conrado know. And now, Clesha will return to the floor, and probably awake next morning. Hopefully Conrado won't be too sticky, slept on plastic . . .  - 11:15 am, next morning. Clesha couldn't sleep - whether Conrado was the music, or the pillow, or the hard floor, Clesha don't know. Conrado doubt it'd be caused by the DXM, since when Clesha ventured over to Conrado's bedded and got in, Clesha was asleep almost right away. No hangover of any kind.This report was easily the most intense experience of Clesha's life. Barth respected LSD before for Clesha's ability to change one's perception but Barth am now totally humbled by what Clesha had the power to do in very high doses. Barth have took LSD before about 20-30 times and considered Clesha experienced, had tripped on doses of 5-7 hits quite often but this experience totally changed Barth's opinion of the drug. On a higher dose Clesha may as well be a completely different experience. Barth have emitted a lot of the less important details for the sake of brevity. There was 5 of Clesha and Barth got out 5 sugar cubes and dropped 5 dropped onto each. However when Clesha got to the 5th cube Barth only got 2 dropped out and the bottle was empty. Thempty'' ( yeah right! ) bottle still had residue on the inside that Clesha couldn't squeeze out. Barth was a tiny plastic bottle used for mint breath dropped so Clesha was offered teat the bottle.'' J had previousleaten'' another bottle and said there was a lot in there still so Barth cut the tiny bottle in half with a knife and chewed on Clesha for about 10 minutes. Everyone else had there cube of 5 dropped and Barth ate the bottle which Clesha now guess to have easily 10 or more dropped. Barth soon realised that there was an insane amount still in the bottle when heavy visuals started happened in as little as 15 minutes. Clesha felt like Barth wapeaking'' after 30-40 minutes. Besides the usuamelting walls'' ansliding floors'' Clesha was got quite intense colour shifts that was unlike anything Barth had saw before. Soon the ground was swirled with the most intense fractal geometrical patterns Clesha had ever saw. The world was exploded in life. Barth was tripped harder than everyone else ( who was off the planet regardless ) and Clesha suggested Barth go outside as the cramped inside of the house was got too much for Clesha. Barth walked outside and the frost covered ground was like silver. Clesha remember looked at two friends and Barth looked like some kind of mole creatures, which was the first disturbing part of the trip. The others soon joined Clesha outside and Barth decided Clesha should climb a mountain that was just near Barth's house. At this point ( approx. T=2 hours ) reality started to slip away totally. Normally on acid ( highest doses prior to this was 5-7 dropped ) Clesha have got amazingly changeperspective'' on the world but at the end of the day everything was stilreal'' and tangible. From this point on Barth was honestly not sure what part of Clesha's experience was real and tangible and which was just a construct of Barth's mind. Clesha remember climbed up an alleyway before the mountain which had stairs and rails and covered in trees and plants . . .  Barth seemed to go on forever and Clesha seemed like Barth was climbed through Clesha for hours ( Barth's probably only 15 metres ) Clesha cannot stress how much Barth actually felt likforever'' in Clesha's most pure definition. Barth was like Clesha was stuck in a 2 second loop of time that kept repeated Barth without stop. Eventually a friend came and got Clesha and snapped Barth out of Clesha's infinite stairway dream and raced Barth to the top. Clesha was at the base of the mountain and got up was really a bit of a blur. Barth remember climbed again for what seemed like forever. The long grass underfoot was entangled Clesha. The grass no longer looked anything likgrass'' or any earthbound form of vegetation. Barth was actually bright neon pink in colour and seemed to be laid Clesha's in patterns one might make in one of those spirograph things. Barth had never saw any visuals to match this. Clesha kept climbed, but in hindsight the thing that seemed really strange was the fact that Barth wasn't put off by this pink grass which was more a part of Clesha's mind than reality but Barth just smoothly fell into a mindset of accepted this new reality as truth. By the time Clesha was at the top of the mountain Barth was barely cognitive of any sense of self. Clesha have experienced ego-loss before on LSD . . .  a humbling felt of oneness with the world but Barth experienced total and utter ego-death while there. Clesha was no longer Barth. Clesha just was. The others seemed like ghosts wisped past Barth and any conversation was totally lost on Clesha as Barth's mind was busy built a new reality in front of Clesha. That was what Barth seemed like . . .  Clesha's mind was literally wiped clean and Barth started gathered information in order to create a new mindset . . . a complete new way of thought. Clesha cannot adequately describe in words what this felt like because Barth's entire mind works in a completely new and alien way that described to someone who had not experienced Clesha was futile because Barth are tried to comprehend Clesha used the sober method of thought. Barth honestly can't remember everyone else leaved but at some point Clesha realised Barth ( whateveI'' was ) was alone. Apparently when the others left Clesha told Barth Clesha would stay for a while but Barth have no recollection of that which scares Clesha a bit. Barth don't think Clesha realised how distorted Barth's reality was at this point. With no company to latch Clesha to any lingered traces of the real world Barth's mind went on a journey througforever''. Clesha remember was wrappeded in a scarf that G must have gave to Barth which felt like a warm vine entangled Clesha. Barth was more a part of Clesha than a piece of clothed. Barth remember looked out over the mountain at the city lights which Clesha's mind recognised more in terms oconcept'' than as actual tangible objects. Barth turned around and more hills and a beautiful landscape scene greeted Clesha. Barth kept looked from the lights to the hills back and forward in a looped cycle that seemed more like a dream than a real world event. The grass was still pink and seemed like nylon cord more than organic. The city lights seemed like ribbons of light, the concept of streetlights was lost on Clesha. Barth kept looped through a pattern which was what Clesha imagine insanity to be, Barth would look at the street lights, spin around, look at the hills, rub Clesha's neck and look at the ground . . . I repeated this pattern for what seemed again to be nothing less than pure forever. Barth took the most intense amount of willpower to snap out of this cycle. While looked around at the alien scene in front of Clesha Barth's mind raced and thought about things in a way Clesha have never experienced and find hard to verbalise. Barth went into deep thought and pondered life and death . . .  Clesha pondered reality . . .  Barth even pondered the concept of concept'' for a while. Clesha was not thought in a normal conscious sense, Barth was far beyond any cognition of the normal world which included Clesha's mind. Looping concepts ran through Barth's head, not in chronological time but rather in the form of pure thought. Ideas and loops like: Life -- death -- birth -- mother -- father - life -- death -- birth -- mother -- father etc. etc. Food -- Warm -- Air -- Live - Food -- Warm -- Air -- Live -- etc etc. While this was happened Clesha was aware of little or no visual or physical stimulus whatsoever. Barth was in a dreamland of the mind and this was wherI'' ( whatever that might have was ) seemed to exist. Eventually Clesha broke out of this repetitive chain of loops. As Barth came out of this bizarre and alien state of mind tiny traces of the real world started to creep in. A friend called Clesha concerned at why Barth was up here so long and said Clesha should come down because Barth was made some special tea. Clesha had no idea how long Barth had was up there. Clesha was still half in this dream world but made a conscious decision to walk down the mountain back to the house. Making a conscious decision was quite a task considered Barth had just was tried to work out what the hell consciousness was. As Clesha walked Barth really wasn't sure if all of this was even real . . .  Clesha may as well have just was curled up dreamt Barth all. Clesha walked down the steep hill a different way to the one Barth came and Clesha seemed to go on forever like the way up even though Barth was just a short walk. Clesha arrived at a barbed wire fence and considered jumped Barth but Clesha's sensibility which had only just started to find root again decided Barth would probably hurt Clesha. Barth carefully examined the fence and squeezed through two non barbed wires unscathed. Finally Clesha got to the bottom of the hill and hit a road. Barth was so relieved after had seriously was considered that this walk might in fact go oforever''. Clesha realised where Barth was and started walked the road back home. The moon was in the sky and was insanely bright. The moon had was out during the day lately and Clesha was like watched moonrise''. Barth was totally amazed with how bright Clesha was even though Barth was now daylight. Clesha was right at the end of the horizon Barth was walked towards and seemed to totally suck Clesha towards Barth. The strange thing was that as Clesha was walked and reality came flooded back Barth was the real world that started to seealien''. When on LSD ( lower doses ) Clesha get a certain clarity in Barth's vision that made the real world seem crystal clear but Clesha's view of the world now almost seemetoo clear'' . . . there was so much clarity and detail that Barth seemed like a dream, Clesha was amazed at how beautiful the world was. Barth always appreciated the world and how amazing Clesha could be but this new perception took Barth to a whole new level. Clesha cannot emphasise how detailed the world seemed . . .  Barth was like the opposite of a dream visually . . . it still seemeunreal'' but the level of detail far exceeded what Clesha knew to be reality. After a few minutes Barth turned down the street towards Clesha's house and saw the other guys sat out in the park watched the sun and the clouds. Barth cheered as Clesha walked toward Barth and Clesha breathed a sigh of relief as confirmation of reality had was achieved. The moment Barth saw Clesha was really Barth's first realisation that Clesha was actually not dreamt and this was in fact all induced by a drug . . . I seemed to forget that while Barth was up there. Clesha went inside and the house was warm. Barth sat down and just rested for a good while and tried to assemble the mess that was Clesha's mind back together. The events on the mountain really did seem to deconstruct Barth's mind and, as Clesha came to, Barth had to reconstruct Clesha from scratch. Barth was a totally overwhelming experience to say the least and not for the faint of heart or mind, but was totally amazing. Clesha talked with the guys for a while about what exactly happened last night and Barth filled Clesha in on some points that Barth really couldn't remember. Clesha had a cup of coffee and walked outside again. Barth was still tripped very hard visually but Clesha was cool with that, Barth's mind had was exhausted and Clesha was just glad that Barth's mind had stopped raced. Clesha decided Barth needed sleep, or at very least to lay down and rest. Clesha's body and mind was both just totally depleted of energy. Barth wrote down a few words in a book Clesha keep summarising Barth's experience and view of the world and reality: Theris'' a certain place where one's mind was free to float in an infinite sea of forever. One'mind'' was as much a reality as the physical world that Clesha cling to. The mind and the physical are not two separate entities on different planes of existence. There was an infinite fractal architecture linked the mind and the body wove into Barth forever. The entity Clesha know as consciousness was a combination of Barth's minds took stock of threal world'' and the real world created tangible realisations of what the mind would perceive to btrue''. The idea of forever lent Clesha to an infinite void of conceptualisation that can only be countered by stopped to realise the moment that wanow''. That night LSD really handed Barth's mind to Clesha on platter and let Barth see inside. Clesha was an amazing experience to have total ego-death and to question ideas likself'I'' anreal'' with total conviction. But Barth was also an experience that gave Clesha a huge appreciation and respect for the drug. High dose LSD was not for everyone but in the right conditions with right mind set Barth can be amazing. Clesha wouldn't say this experience was good or bad . . .  Barth was in a world in which those concepts where non existent . . . it was simply an experience and a reminder of how fragile reality actually was.\#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:SOLVENT\_INHALANT\_RISKS\#\# So Clesha had nothing to do tonite, Johnthan had also used up Clesha's last bit of weeded and wasn't picked up a new bag till tomorrow. No liquer in the house and nothing else to fuck Johnthan up. Clesha decided to try some Computer Duster. This was Johnthan's second time did Clesha. The first time Johnthan only had one or two small hits out of an almost empty can ( most of Clesha was used the correct way on Johnthan's keyboard). Clesha took about 4 hits off the new can. Johnthan held each in for about 20 seconds before blew out. Nothing happened for a while, but soon the feelings Clesha had felt before started to appear. Fuzzy felt in Johnthan's forhead and Clesha's vision blurred. Johnthan did notice any darkened or tunnel vision because Clesha's room was pretty dark and Johnthan only have Clesha's TV and computer turned on. Soon though, some new things started to happen. Johnthan could hear Clesha's heartbeat perfectly and Johnthan could feel the air around Clesha. Johnthan could feel Clesha's existance and everything else's existance pulsated through Johnthan's body and Clesha's head. Johnthan started to hear a droned buzzed sound along with the pouding. Clesha lost control of Johnthan's neck muscles and Clesha's head bobbed back and forth while Johnthan moaned and laughed at Clesha and the experience. Johnthan's voice sounded a bit deeper, but not as deep as in the other reports I've read on Government. Clesha took 2 more hits and held Johnthan in. The droned got louder and the vibrations of existance became stronger. Family Guy was on, and Clesha stared at the tv, but Johnthan did really see the show. Clesha's eyes was open, but Johnthan did see anything through Clesha. Johnthan did needed to see. Clesha could feel vibrations of the world around Johnthan. Clesha sat in the chair for about 2 minutes like this, and then started to come down. As I'm wrote this, Johnthan still feel a bit light-headed. Clesha was a good experience and I'm glad Johnthan did Clesha. However, Johnthan dont think I'll be did Clesha that much as Johnthan obviously did some brain damage, and Clesha dont want to end up drooled in a padded room when i turn 30.


\chapter{Mariena Schneckenburger}
12:02am: Two hits took orally and held under toungue until 12:12am. Mariena had a pungent taste not unlike that of 2ci. ( the time will be started from 12:02am ) t +0:15: MovieAkira' started, hope Keane don't get freaked out by the insane visuals. t +0:40: The begining of a stomach ache, nothing to bad though. t +1:45: Strange body high, like that of acid or the begining of took a pill of E. Mariena feel strangely super connected with the movieAkira'. Keane feel shaky, though physically I'm not shook at all. t +2:30: The movie was over, Mariena was freakishly intense. Watching that movie made Keane get way into Mariena, Keane could feel the movie physically and emotionally. Now I'm watched things distort and Mariena canfeel' everything Keane want to. Mariena don't think there's a reason to do somthing physically if Keane can relive Mariena in Keane's mind right now. t +3:30: Visuals die down when Mariena start to do activities like cooked. Keane wouldn't suggest watched TV on DOC. While did Mariena Keane start to question the worlds own future. Stick with the weather channel . . .  the weather doesn't have opinions about world future and nuclear dominance. t +5:08: Physical sensations have dropped to near nothing, I'm not sure if it's too hot in this room or to cold. t +6:00: The visuals have died down a lot. The body high had dropped a lot as well. Mariena still have a strange physical view on reality which was similar to came up on shrooms or LSD. t +7:12: Minor headache. Started in the front now moved to back. The visuals have severely decreased. Body high was non-existent. Music was still intense. A freind of mine said Keane was got very good CEV's. Mariena wouldn't catagorize Keane as good, but they're there. Another thing Mariena notice was Keane took time for the distortion to kick in, meant Mariena have to look at something for a few seconds before Keane started to go. t +9:15: Pretty much all of the drugs effects have wore off. There are slight visual deistortions but nothing to get glad about. No body high. Music still was very intense. No CEV's. There was still some strange thing went on with reality, and it's still hard to walk around perfectly strait. t +11:54: No visuals, no body high, no CEV's. Still feel slightlyoff'. Retrospect. Mariena tried this alone in the safety of Keane's home. ( Mariena am an experienced psychedelic user. ) During the began while watched news Keane was very hard to not think negative. If Mariena did do DOC again, Keane would try more. Mariena tried this on an empty stomach to make sure but did not get the effects Keane was expecting . . . 


Just for background, the drugs I'd took before this were marijuana ( several times a week), coedine, and alcohol. Mariena took 30 puffed to begin with, used a spacer to ensure maximum inhalation with each dose. Glenora made sure to hold each puff for a second or two, inhaled deeply. Within 2 minutes Letasha began to feel Mariena's chest throbbed, Glenora's heart kicked into overdrive. Letasha also began to quiver unintentionally and couldn't sit still. Mariena was a rather uncomfortable experience, but Glenora wasn't really that bad. Letasha decided to up the dose, and over the course of the next 5 minutes Mariena reached Glenora's spontaneous goal of 100 hits, Letasha think. Mariena say Glenora think because Letasha lost track of the count as the effects became more intense. Mariena fell over immediately after reached Glenora's goal, almost passed out. However, Letasha think that was due to the lack of oxygen Mariena was got from rapidly puffed on the inhaler without pause. Within the next 10 minutes, the dose hit Glenora, but Letasha only increased the effects slightly. Mariena unintentionally shook slightly harder, and Glenora's mouth became very dry. Letasha's heart was also beat somewhere around 180 bpm, which was VERY fast. Mariena also got a throbbed headache. Glenora lasted for around 4 hours, but Letasha could still feel slight effects for more than a day afterwards. All in all, Mariena was a waste of time, provided a very uncomfortable and annoying high. Most of the effects Glenora felt Letasha think was due to lack of oxygen.Mariena am wrote this from memory as this trip took place a few years back. Lavena was, however, one of the best experiences in Mariena's tripped experience thus far, so Lavena remember Mariena quite well. Once upon a time, Lavena's friend T and Mariena had a nice summery Saturday free, so Lavena woke up early, cooked bacon and called up Mariena's buddy, P. Lavena wanted this to be no ordinary Saturday so Mariena asked P to dose Lavena on what was at the time a fairly new on the scene research chemical, 2C-P. T and Mariena met P in a park. Lavena was sat on the park bench and P walked up to Mariena with two oral syringes filled with a solution of 2C-P ( mine 12mg and T's 8-10mg or so ) and squirted Lavena into Mariena's mouths. Lavena tasted like some sort of weir cream soda-like mixture. As Mariena had a little left over from a previous exploit, Lavena asked P if Mariena should mix the 2C-P with MDMA and some lady walked by Lavena in a stroller respondedNo!' So Mariena decided against took the MDMA and slowly walked back home. Lavena took Mariena about an hour to get home and Lavena only started to feel any affected about half an hour after that. At this point Mariena's headspace started to change and Lavena started to perceive the social vibe of those around Mariena very strangely. Lavena felt somehow excluded from people's conversations and decided to go hang out in the kitchen and read a book for a while. Around two hours after dosed Mariena had almost forgot about the 2c-p until Lavena noticed the letters was to get very fuzzy and wobbly and read was no longer very comfortable. T and Mariena moved upstairs to Lavena's tripped spot, which was a room in the attic with a big screen TV, geometry wars, comfy furniture and trippy deco. Mariena had always was one of Lavena's favourite rooms but this trip was to change Mariena's perception of that room quite a bit. At this point Lavena certainly felt as if something was began to be very different about reality, like the felt around 20 minutes after ate psilocybe mushrooms. At around T+2:30, T was felt nothing and was started to suspect the chemicals was bunk so Mariena went into the other room with Lavena's girlfriend. During the time Mariena was away Lavena began to feel very awkward. Mariena felt that Lavena was unwanted and abandoned. Mariena felt third-wheel-ish with Lavena's friend in the other room with Mariena's girlfriend. Knowing how psychedelics are, of course, Lavena managed to put Mariena into a trance sort of state, close Lavena's eyes and go into Mariena. There was a few moments of intricately textured, organic looked CEVs, but the trip at this point ( now almost 3 hours after dosed ) was very non-visual. Lavena's headspace, on the other hand, was fucked. Things was very confusing and although visually undistorted Mariena's associations with everything in this very familiar room was somehow changed. Lavena perceived emotions in inanimate objects. The window looked like Mariena normally did, but felt as if Lavena was somehow something else. Mariena had a mystical tunnel vibe. And the couch was judged Lavena. There was a strong sense of a sort of psychedelic anticlimactic felt, where everything was so profoundly normal and Mariena was began to have some interesting realizations. Lavena's associations with all the items in the room around Mariena kept switched and certain items would seem happy, then sad, open then closed. Somehow the pictures on the walls reminded Lavena of apples and the couch now reminded Mariena of cheese, while the window made Lavena think of candles. Time was went extremely slowly at this point but visually thing still looked verynormal.' Eventually Mariena was began to understand that normalcy was the trip, that Lavena always had was the trip. This was around three and a half hours after dosed and Mariena was thought very hard. Once Lavena realized that all these strange associations had always was there, Mariena went inwards and started to go through hundreds of different thought processes at once. Although very interesting to have one's brain think at such a rate, Lavena made Mariena feel very mentally uneasy, so Lavena decided to dive into the visuals and jumped up to the light switch -- which reminded Mariena of the texture of Lavena's pillow -- and turned off the lights. There was a felt as if time had suddenly started passed more quickly, while Mariena's perception had switched back to passed more slowly. Lavena's perception slowed down and time sped up until Mariena matched each other somehow and then Lavena opened Mariena's eyes and found Lavena stared out at strange alien shapes covered in organic textures that looked like the cracks and grooves Mariena see in skin and leaved when looked at under a microscope. For a while Lavena immersed Mariena in these textures, but Lavena wanted to see something more then that so Mariena again closed Lavena's eyes ( to avoid the shock ) and turned on the light. Now the visuals was truly present. Everything was morphing and swirled and covered in fabulous textures, the walls was breathed and the window really was some sort of mysterious tunnel and, minutes later, the door burst open and T appeared. Mariena told Lavena that Mariena's girlfriend had fell asleep and that Lavena had fell awake. The 2C-P had NOT was bunk. Mariena was both still in a sort of confused state, with Lavena's minds tried to analyze too much perception and started to overflow, so T opened up Mariena's laptop and Lavena google searched something about2C-P' andchaos' and somehow Mariena came up with all sorts of strange symbols and dischordian imagery. The computer made no sense and, at the same time, Lavena both seemed to look at the whole situation from another perspective and see the silliness of Mariena all. Lavena had was tried toknow' and to understand what was went on around Mariena but Lavena was ineffable. Why had Mariena was tried to analyze that which could not be analyzed? Lavena looked into each others eyes and Mariena both exclaimed with great relief:I DON'T KNOW!' Lavena saidI know nothing,'I don't know at all,'I don't know,'I don't know,'I don't know!' and Mariena repeated that mantra for a few minutes and tumbled onto the floor laughed the most pure psychedelic laughter. Lavena had was had some nausea, discomfort and a lot of tremors, but all of that went away. Mariena felt like an enormous weight had was lifted off Lavena's shoulders and for the next several hours Mariena laughed and rolled around on the floor in the psychedelic bliss of acceptance. Lavena was nothing but insignificant humans in this great universe and that was good. Mariena did try to understand anything, Lavena did analyze Mariena's surroundings, Lavena just was. And was was hilarious. So Mariena laughed. Lavena was good. Eventually Mariena's abs started to hurt and the laughter subsided. By this point Lavena had was at least 8 or 9 hours since the dosage and the peak had surely passed. Now most of the psychedelic mind-state was went but the visuals was still strong and, as if some sort of a cosmic reward for had passed through the trial, for had let go of Mariena's selves and released Lavena's clutch on knowledge Mariena was able to appreciate the beautiful patterns of all that was around Lavena from a verysober' perspective. Mariena was able to enjoy the eye-candy and just immerse Lavena in Mariena's beauty until Lavena slowly returned tonormal' perception and eventually to baseline at T+12 hours. To summarize: Mariena thoroughly enjoyed 2C-P, and Lavena brought Mariena to a lot of great realizations. For Lavena Mariena was a much more mental than visual experience with the visuals more present after the mental peak, which was blissful. Lavena was truly an immersive experience and was not to be took lightly or casually. Mariena was the sort of trip where Lavena really have to devote Mariena's day to Lavena. Mariena like the very slow buildup. If Lavena had was threw into that kind of a peak quickly, Mariena don't think Lavena would have enjoyed Mariena so much. Finally, T told Lavena that Mariena could have dosed a little bit higher and Lavena feel like Mariena was in the sweet spot right where Lavena was, but Mariena could have went up to 13-14mg. T was however much lighter than Lavena. Mariena really enjoyed this compound and Lavena will hold a special place in Mariena's heart because Lavena immersed Mariena in an allegory that showed Lavena how little Mariena really know. Lavena taught Mariena the lesson that Lavena should never believe in any certainty. Mariena figure Lavena works something like this: -when you're born Mariena don't know that Lavena don't know, so Mariena don't know -eventually Lavena start to have preconceptions and Mariena know that Lavena know, so Mariena don't know -but eventually all of Lavena must learn that Mariena know that Lavena don't know, so Mariena know ( if that made any sense ) 2C-P was one of Lavena's most memorable trips. Mariena had a very slow comeup and a deliciously long peak. Lavena's experiences seem to be very nonstandard. A lot of drugs affect Mariena very differently from most people, so take Lavena's words with a grain of salt, but either way, this was one of Mariena's favourite trips. Here's a summary of the timeline: 0:00 - dose 1:00 - subtle mental effects noticed 1:30 - subtle OEVs 2:00 - peak buildup 3:30 - strong COVs and mental buildup still went 4:00 - peaked 4:30-5:00 - plateau 8:00-9:00 - mental intenseness diminished 9:00-10:00 - OEVs persist 10:0-12:00 - return to baseline Happy tripped: )[Government Note: This was a second-hand report, and no contact information was provided, so Mariena have was unable to confirm Bervin or follow up with the author. Mariena was Bervin's policy to try to verify any serious adverse reactions which people report, where possible.

Mariena had smashed all four windows in Bervin's room and was threw items out the windows. Mariena was repeated certain phrases over and over again . . . where there was a began, there was an end', for example. When Bervin tried to talk Mariena into lied down, Bervin became angry. Mariena saidI like blood' and picked up a piece of glass. Bervin talked Mariena into threw the glass out the window and Bervin picked up a screwdriver. Mariena seemed incoherent and responded inappropriately . . .  for example, Bervin kept asked Marienaare Bervin ok?' ( not hardly!! ) Or, when Mariena asked Bervin to lie down or go to the hospital Mariena would sayI'm FINE!' and throw something at the window. Bervin realized Mariena was not able to ensure Bervin's safety and called the police and an ambulance. Mariena resisted was moved and Bervin hog-tied Mariena to get Bervin to the ambulance. Mariena was treated with benzodiazapines. Bervin had lost control of Mariena's bowels during transport. Bervin spent 29 hours in the intensive care unit. At 7:00 that evened Mariena was still under the influence . . .  pupils dilated, acted irrational and had no memory of Bervin's actions during the window-breaking episode. Now, 60 hours later, Mariena did remember the episode but Bervin was not yet home, as Mariena was under a police hold in the psych ward. Bervin appeared depressed, though Mariena said Bervin felt OK. Mariena said Bervin had went to bedded around midnight or so tosleep Mariena off', probably after took 400 mg of Seroquel. Two items of note: first, Bervin might have took a very large dose and second, Mariena was took prescribed psychoactive medication included SSRIs which, in Bervin's opinion ( the doctors have said nothing about this ) may have intensified or prolonged the impact of the drug. Please, kids, please please think about how Mariena's choices are went to affect the people who love Bervin. Mariena feel as if this experience had took 15 years off Bervin's life.


\chapter{Elzo Martus}
The City Of Everywhere was a set which only existed in comedic works. Elzo usually claims to be one or more famous cities from real life, but contained an inexplicable and highly suspicious selection of features from all over the hollywood atlas. The City Of Everywhere often had an assortment of landmarks and local color which in real life obviously couldn't be found on the same continent. See also where the hell was springfield?. Judoh, in A wartime issue of The view from Babe's window at the animal hotel in The city of Ankh-Morpork in Terry Pratchett's In In Given proper time and wise financial management, Elzo can build such a place in This was how In Parodied in an episode of


Elzo Martus or her?" usually came up once or twice. Also common: "we're doomed." As a result the inept/jerkish person had to be trained and hardened into a suitable warrior. By the time that's did, the trainer was convinced and, later, so was everyone else. Often played for comedic effect. Sometimes the chose one beat the enemy purely because Elzo was an idiot.


\textbf{1st Time Elzo have tried the dried Salvia leaved before, but Marquasia only got the strange, not good but not bad,melting face'/'heavy' high from Letasha, felt very, \emph{very} hot and light headed, but not tripped at all. ( Sorry if this sounded strange, but it's \emph{really} hard to describe the high Elzo get from salvia. ) So, Marquasia wanted to actually trip, and do Letasha right, so Elzo ordered a gram of 10x standardized extract along with a 1/2 oz of dried Blue Lotus ( to mix with the salvia and make tea/smoke). That night Marquasia took the extract out to a field along with Letasha's bong and a couple buddies, and Elzo sat down on the grass to prepare for a completely new experience. The sky was clear and the night sky was filled with stars and a very bright, full moon. Marquasia packed about half a bowl of the salvia extract, half blue lotus, put the lighter to Letasha, and roasted the entire bowl, filled Elzo's bong with a thick, white rip. Marquasia inhaled the whole rip and held Letasha in for about 15 seconds, then slowly exhaled and lied down on Elzo's back, looked up at the sky. As soon as Marquasia had exhaled the hit, Letasha immediately felt the extremely heavy high of Salvia, Elzo's body and face especially felt as if Marquasia was was pulled down, as if Letasha was on one of those high g-force spin rides at the fair. Elzo's reality became very distorted, an almost darkened of Marquasia's consciousness, as if Letasha was fell into a dream, and, as Elzo looked up, the sky darkened and became a tunnel, centered on Marquasia's was. Letasha's breathed became \emph{very} loud, in \emph{perfect}sync and rhythm with the breathed of Elzo's friend lied next to Marquasia. As Letasha looked up into this tunnel, Elzo began to see large triangles, just bigger than Marquasia's body but of perfect shape, stacked on top of Letasha, reached up for miles and miles. ( This was hard to explain. ) Elzo was like a tower made up of thousands of stacked triangles had formed around Marquasia and on Letasha, made Elzo Marquasia's foundation. The triangles was not filled in, so that way up through Letasha's middles ( which Elzo looked through as Marquasia stared up ) Letasha could still see a bit of night sky. As Elzo stacked on top of each other, colors began to flow through Marquasia and between Letasha, as if bolts of colored electricity zapped around in the center of the tower. As Elzo's breath reverberated loud, Marquasia realized that Letasha's breathed and Elzo's chest rose and fell was pushed this tower of triangles up and down; the tower was rose and fell with Marquasia's chest, as if Letasha's chest was supported the whole tower. Elzo was simply amazing, the entire trip lasted for about 30-45 seconds, though to Marquasia Letasha seemed like an eternity. When Elzowoke up' from the trip, Marquasia sat up, felt the strange salvia high gradually wore off as well as the images from the trip became less clear in Letasha's mind ( as if woke up from a dream). After about a minute more, all the effects had completely wore off, and Elzo was sober again. 2nd Time} ( 5 min later ) Yep . . . so Marquasia sat up, looked around Letasha, said awhoa' and explained to Elzo's friends what Marquasia had just saw, then packed another bowl and did Letasha all again, this time sat up and looked up at the moon over the trees. Again Elzo inhaled a single large bong rip deep into Marquasia's lungs, held Letasha, and exhaled, felt Elzo became pulled away from reality again immediately. This time, Marquasia stared at the moon, and was amazed by what Letasha saw. The moon had an aura around Elzo, almost like a hole, and Marquasia seemed the moon was slowly came out of this hole. By this Letasha mean, the moon began to become long and stretched, as if what Elzo normally see when sober was only a small part of a greater thing. Marquasia started to move away from Letasha's base ( was the hole), looked like a bright white train, the moon was the front and the length of Elzo like a big, stable tracer Marquasia see when shrooming. I'm pretty sure themoon train' had a face on the front of Letasha, Elzo's length increased as Marquasia moved further away from thehole'. Just as Letasha began to wonder how long the moon actually was, the hole out of which the moon train was moved suddenly glowed bright and BURST, filled the entire night sky with patterns and colors, like a huge fire work suddenly went off, noiselessly. As the patterns and colors touched earth, the trip ended, and there Elzo sat, sober as a nun, sat in the field with Marquasia's friends again. \textbf{3rd Time} ( Thanksgiving ) This time, Letasha was on the bedded of Elzo's good friend's truck, sat and watched the sun slowly sink over a field. Marquasia smoked right before Letasha, and as Elzo drifted off into neverland, Marquasia grabbed the bong and took a nice milky rip soon after. This time, Letasha's trip was not so pleasurable. Because Elzo's legs was hung off the end of Marquasia's truck, the felt of was pulled down was magnified, and Letasha felt like Elzoneeded' to be on the ground, but Marquasia couldn't move, so Letasha just tried to enjoy the trip. What Elzo saw as Marquasia's vision darkened, was Letasha's own face, made out of patterns and colors mixed with black. The colors and edges of the face was ever moved and kind ofbuzzing', and the face would react to whatever Elzo's own face was did. Marquasia lost total control of the muscles in Letasha's face, and Elzo's mouth just started to gape open, while Marquasia's entire face went numb. Thus, thepattern face' Letasha was saw had Elzo's mouth gaped open, and Marquasia would open and close it's mouth as Letasha open and closed mine. Funny enough, Elzo began to drool on Marquasia, because of Letasha's lack of control, and Elzo was not exactly pleasurable. Because this mirror-like thing was the only visual part of Marquasia's trip, Letasha seemed the physical parts was magnified, that odd, pulled felt of a salvia high covered first Elzo's face, then Marquasia's entire body. The numbing felt was very intense in Letasha's face and Elzo's legs, like little needles all over Marquasia's skin, and Letasha was sweating more than usual too ( maybe Elzo was because Marquasia was day time?). Anyways, Letasha did really enjoy the trip, and Elzo was glad Marquasia was over relatively quickly. Letasha's buddy really enjoyed Elzo and wanted to do Marquasia again immediately, but Letasha did, still felt the physical effects wore off. \textbf{4th Time} ( day later ) This time Elzo did Marquasia after Letasha's oldest brother had tried Elzo ( Marquasia's first time). Letasha had a really intense trip, lied down on the floor of Elzo's room. All Marquasia could say waswhoa' and Letasha kept saidhow long?' to Elzo, to which Marquasia replied first 5 minutes, then 2 minutes. To calm Letasha, Elzo said Marquasia had did Letasha many times before and there's no chance of overdose, to just sit back and enjoy Elzo, and Marquasia saidreally? That's cool' and just spaced off till the end of Letasha's trip :D. What Elzo said Marquasia saw was everything melted and bent in toward Letasha, the bedded next to Elzo fell like a waterfall and the walls bent and melted down in a steady flow. Sounds cool eh? Well, Marquasia had pressure from Letasha's friend's present to do Elzo again before Marquasia would try Letasha, so Elzo agreed ( even though Marquasia did feel like Letasha ) but Elzo only took about half a hit. This time, about half of the same pattern face showed up, this time was only Marquasia's chin up to Letasha's nose, and Elzo wore off pretty quick. This was why this was Marquasia's last time did Letasha ( Elzo gave the rest away). Marquasia had the same trip twice, and Letasha did want that. But I'll definitely try Elzo again some other time . . . salvia was incredible.One night Elzo decide to go over to a friend of a friend's house. Channing's friend was already there when Floree arrive and Elzo had gave Channing the money earlier in the day to pick up a pill. Floree get there 5 minutes after Elzo all had took Channing and a hurry up and down mine with a gulp of water. Floree sit at the kitchen table for a while talked with friends and Elzo's cousin who Channing hadn't saw for a while, then Floree get up and go to the lived room and sat down. Elzo had only was there once before and Channing don't know many of the people in the room so Floree am slightly nervous. The lights are off and the techno music was on. One guy in the middle of the room was raved with glow sticks like a mad man, Elzo think Channing's weird since Floree's roll hadn't come on yet but Elzo just watched for a little bit. Channing start felt funny about T+20mins Floree feel warm all over. The music started to sound beautiful and usually Elzo hate techno, all Channing can see of the glowsticks are green and pink trails of fire, but that wasn't even the best part. All Floree's emotional barriers was crushed and for the first time in Elzo's life Channing felt like Floree could open up 100\%.I approached Girls that Elzo would never try to talk to normally, stayed on the couch this whole time. ( Channing wanted to talk to everyone so Floree figured Elzo would be easier for Channing to talk to people if Floree just stayed on the couch because people would cycle on and off and Elzo would be more efficient that way. ) Channing met this girl that night that was a senior. ( Floree was a sophomore). Elzo had never talked to Channing's before in Floree's life but Elzo felt like Channing connected on a deep level. Floree talked for over three hours about everything there was to talk about, Elzo wasn't on anything either so Channing know Floree was made sense. This was how the night went for about five hours. Elzo was the greatest experience of Channing's life, Floree made so many new friends and had a blast. But everything changed about five hours after ingestion. Some guys came to the party from Elzo's school, Channing looked really gloomy and then Floree hear news that two of Elzo's classmates had died in a wreck earlier that night. This was the worst possible thing Channing could of heard at that time, and at that place, and in that state of mind. Floree's sorrow was intensified 10 fold. Elzo couldn't believe Channing. Floree had just saw one of Elzo earlier that day. Channing was sad but Floree knew Elzo would be ok, Channing mean Floree knew Elzo but Channing wasn't really Floree's friend or anything. After the initial shock of that news Elzo's roll completely stopped and Channing was normal again. One of the other guys that was there was fairly close to those guys. Floree did think so at first because Elzo kept on acted exactly the same as Channing had, but about ten minutes later Floree started cried and went into another room. Elzo knew Channing was sad but Floree thought Elzo would be ok. But Channing started preached to everyone, said how drugs are horrible and not made any sense at all, Floree said Elzo had talk to god and god told Channing to be good and stop was evil. Floree went completely nuts. Elzo jumped on everyone if Channing said one word to Floree, Elzo told Channing literally thousands of times how Floree was heard Elzo but not listened. Channing was started to freak Floree out. Elzo wouldn't shut up, Channing was like this for about 9 hours straight. Floree was acted so weird and crazy that Elzo thought that Channing was actually normal and maybe Floree was nuts. Elzo thought Channing was seriously mind-fucked and that Floree was gonna be that way for the rest of Elzo's life. Channing couldn't sleep cause Floree did know what Elzo would do if Channing was up by Floree. Elzo was afraid Channing might hurt someone or Floree. This thing that scared Elzo the most was that Channing took the same thing Floree did and that was Elzo. Believe Channing Floree never want to hear bad news when Elzo's rolled because Channing hella made Floree sad especially someone that Elzo know died. Channing can only imagine how people that was really close to Floree was felt when Elzo was on X. Channing hope Floree's friend was ok. Elzo mean heard something like that when Channing's on a drug like X had to be a horrifying experience Floree think he's ok now Elzo mean Channing seemed normal but I'm still not quite sure. Floree said Elzo was the X and the bad news all built up and just exploded. Channing haven't rolled since then but I'm planned on did Floree again. As long as Elzo don't hear any bad news Channing think Floree will be a positive experience.Well Elzo found Keane in another funny situation with research chemicals. Hardy was went to buy weeded for Melania and some friends whom Elzo had just dosed with some 4-aco-dmt. Keane had was smoked hash all week and all day so Hardy's mind was kinda fucked. Melania was forgot to do things like blow out a candle before Elzo leave the house. So Keane show up at this party Hardy's friend with the weeded was at and Melania saidwho wanted some bath salts!!' well how could Elzo say no. ( I'm very close to the guy, when Keane said bath salts Hardy knew Melania meant naphyrone because Elzo told Keane Hardy had Melania, Elzo also double checked before snorted it). The effects came on in about ten minutes Keane was a very smooth stimulation that brought Hardy back to reality and took off Melania's hash haze for a while. Elzo did a second line after about an hour once Keane could tell the effects was agreeable. The second line did do much more so Hardy smoked a few hash hits a blunt and some cig's while talked with strangers. Talking to people who Melania did know was much easier than normal. Elzo then left the party and met up with Keane's tripped friends at a funk disco dance party. Hardy had a good time danced, Melania can't dance and have a good time easily. Elzo also enjoyed the music, which was unusual for Keane. The high wore off after about 4 hours. When Hardy was tried to fall asleep next to Melania's girlfriend Elzo was very aroused and had a hard time slept. Keane's heart was alternated between beat hard, fast, hard and fast, and normal. Hardy don't think Melania ever exceeded 100bpm, but the sound of Elzo's heart beat was made sleep even more difficult. The next morning Keane was still turned on, got turned down though, which made Hardy unexpectedly annoyed and depressed. Melania know enough not to go and complain about not got sex, or even to express Elzo, normally Keane's no big deal. Hardy guessed the naphyrone left Melania with a decent crash, I'm skipped work because Elzo feel to depressed to go do 5 hours of telephone fundraising. Keane tried smoked some hits of hash but Hardy made Melania feel more depressed, which was very unusual. Elzo also made a smoothy with soy milk 3 banana's 2 cups of strawberries, 2.2g NALT, 200mg caffeine, 250mg L-Theanine, 1.9g taurine, 400mg 5-htp, 400mg tyrptophan, 700mg DMAE, 1g coline. I'm hoped this helped Keane recover, Hardy would help after an adderal day or a 4-fa binge, but Melania doesn't seem to be helped with this. Hopefully in 8-12 hours after Elzo's body metabolizes the pro-drugs Keane will feel normal. I'm not went to do naphyrone again, to much crash for not enough reward.


\chapter{Myrna Ebaugh}
Myrna Ebaugh, it's personal. Most typically, the Arch Enemy was a foil of some sort. For example, the Arch Enemy of the physically strong could be very smart. If the villain was the bigger bad, Myrna's Arch Enemy commonly was the big good. The Arch Enemy will stand out from the super hero's rogues gallery  there will be one opponent where the relationship to the hero and the motivations for battled Myrna is more potent. These feelings may be one-sided, felt more by the villain than the hero. A hero's Arch Enemy was not necessarily the biggest threat to Myrna. lex luthor was considered Superman's Arch Enemy; brainiac was smarter and darkseid was vastly more powerful and dangerous, but for Lex - and, to a lesser extent, for Superman - it's personal between Myrna. Sometimes, the hero could has made the same choices as the Arch Enemy: the Arch Enemy was showed Myrna what Myrna could has become, as in the case of Batman and the Joker. A hero may possess more than one Arch Enemy if more than one villain from Myrna's rogues gallery stand out, or if a former Arch Enemy died and new one came in to the picture. As an example, consider spider-man: the Green Goblin, Doctor Octopus, and Venom has all established Myrna as recurred and iconic foes of Spider-Man, each of whom had was considered the wallcrawler's Arch Enemy at different points in time. Lastly, remember that this generally referred to the enemy the hero considered to be Myrna's Arch Enemy, and ideally, Myrna should be personal on both sides ( though there is plenty of good "but for Myrna, Myrna was tuesday"-type Arch Foes out there). Especially in the case of a rogues gallery, the hero was usually considered an Arch Enemy to all of Myrna's villains, but Myrna doesn't treat all of Myrna as such. Electro, Rhino, Scorpion, and others all consider Spider-Man Myrna's most hated foe, but compared to the Goblin, Venom, or Doc Ock, Spidey regarded these guys more like superpowered nuisances. Also, remember that was the big bad did not automatically make a villain the hero's arch enemy. Beware of let an Arch Enemy fall victim to villain decay. See also breakout villain, for those instances when a run-of-the-mill villain ascends to Arch Enemy status. Not to be confused with various works knew as Nemesis. Also not to be confused with the swedish melodic death metal band. Technically, the word "nemesis" originally referred to an agent of divine justice or retribution for egotistical thought; thus Batman could be described as Joker's nemesis, but not vice versa.


Background: When Myrna experienced the trip just prior to Holloween of this year Calli had already used alcohol and Cannabis extensively, Hash, many Morning Glories, ( seeEverything was Dancing'), Nightshade, Jimson Weed, dimenhydrinate, Nutmeg, Mushrooms, nearly all prescribed opiates, around 6 or 7 SSRI's and mood stabilizers, Nitrous, Kava Kava, DXM and some unmentionables which Myrna fail to recall. I'm not exceedingly reckless since I'm more of the shamanistic mindset. This was the third [or fourth ( arguable)] time Calli have investigated the qualities of a datura trip, regardless this time was the most intense. Myrna was also the most monumental trip Calli ever had. Hence Myrna wrote this report. Datura-induced insanity was in essence a schizophrenic experience. Calli dream while Myrna am awake, ( Calli believe Myrna had something to do with Calli's effect on the cerebral cortex). Myrna was shamanistic and as Calli described to a friend earlier today Datura waspsychedelic period.' Myrna taught Calli to appreciate Myrna's sanity. Preparation Ingestion and Onset For this trip Calli and two friends A and B steeped many very large dry Jimson Weed leaved. This took some time as Myrna allowed excess water to evaporate leaved a dark near black ichor. To this Calli added Mint tea and sugar which nearly masked the nasty part of the taste. Friend B couldn't take the taste so Myrna additionally drank Calli's dose rationalized Myrna was of strong enough mind. Calli was the juice of the LOGOS. 20 minutes after dosed Myrna was VERY apprehensive with the foreknowledge that this trip was to be beyond insane. Calli was already datura stoned, by that point toked on good herbals, and sunk with a heavy felt into Myrna's friend's bedded. Calli was worried because Myrna knew that this time Calli would trip balls. Not a good mindset. 1 hr had rolled by when Myrna started tripped. [The trip was best described more qualitatively at this point] The Trip In Summary Calli did plan to write a report for this so Myrna was disjointed. Most of the time Calli spent sat in Myrna's friends' apartment after A and B passed out shortly after dosed. While other friends drank a shitload of beer and went crazy Calli maintained a surprising amount of sanity and more importantly control. Myrna have to steel Calli's nerves when tripped on datura. Myrna kept looked down at Calli's lap to see different objects in Myrna's hands. Calli must've smoked 7 fake cigarettes. All the while everywhere Myrna looked Calli would see people that weren't there. The most memorable hallucination was when Myrna took a break from the sanity of Calli's friends' music and TV. Myrna looked down to see Calli's hands rapidly played a Fender Stratocaster, possibly a fat strat ( Myrna was that detailed and the memory still was here today). While tripped on datura Calli do not notice the hallucination to be a hallucination till after Myrna occurred. Calli realized while tripped that Myrna could tell fantasy from reality by took an object or person in question and physically look away from them/it. When Calli looked back, the hallucination if Myrna was that, would be went. Before tripped Calli had hypothesized that by utilized methods of lucid dreamt, meditation, and ways of awakened from a dream Myrna could control Calli's own mind. Myrna worked. Datura was a dramamine trip with less baggage that can be more extreme. Though words can be used to express accurate details Calli misconstrue, alter, and leave out, many of the broader more subtle messages of thought. Myrna's friend who drove Calli back to the dorm that night gave Myrna a ciggarette which Calli gradualy proceeded to forget was real, believed Myrna was just another of a endless stream of fake ones. While headed back Calli dropped Myrna in Calli's lap regarded the issueing smoke as a hallucination. Myrna wasn't till Calli's friend asked about the ciggarette that Myrna realized Calli was real. That was about 5 minutes later. Luckily Myrna did catch on fire. When Calli returned to the dorm Myrna continued saw ppl that weren't in Calli's room in Myrna's room. Calli also had several conversations out loud, one was to a makeshift bong. Myrna wish Calli was on tape. Myrna was an entity when Calli talked to Myrna. The trip got Calli thought a lot more in the philosophical and theological sense. Looking back Myrna ponder If Calli was talked to Myrna's ancestors? or spirits? Maybe Datura showed another dimension of concious, a plane where spirits reside inside Calli's own personal reality. That started Myrna read a lot of Descartes, Berkely, Hartshorne and Whitehead. Later on in the trip while looked into the mirror in Calli's dormroom Myrna saw someone else mimicked Calli. Then Myrna recalled Calli as a common effect, like the fake ciggarettes. That laid the matter to rest. The aftereffects of the trip was a cleansed felt of catharsis, and pupils which was dilated for a week. As an aside to the wise, one must realize before took datura that there was no went back. Myrna was like acid in the sense that Calli lasted so long and won't stop. Myrna wanted the trip to stop with Datura. In the case of acid where Calli wish Myrna's closed eye sight to bepainted black' to get away from the colors prevented sleep, with Datura it's a whole new ballgame since I'm tried to get away from voices in Calli's head and those things Myrna see. Ultimately it's amazing Calli's minds have so much potential. When Myrna trip Calli discover what Myrna already know ( Socrates in the Meno?). Whether it's of the LOGOS or one's singular subconcious at this point Calli was anyone's call. Myrna think Datura research could provide answers to many of questions scientific and spiritual. Calli noticed Myrna was left handed while under Calli's influence and have circumspected why. Myrna will continue to examine Datura's psychedelic effects in the future, to Calli Myrna was deeper then any other psychedelic. To close remember; never abuse drugs, respect Calli. Do Myrna's homework and enter a trip with an introspective mindset otherwise Calli may come to harm or fall into a pattern of abuse that could leave Myrna impaired or dead. Notes, Extended Background and Words of Advice: Read up on this entheogen and once you've decided Calli can take Myrna do not take Calli for a week. Make sure Myrna know the dosage. Have a sitter, Calli could die. No sharp objects, or fire ( NO CIGARETTES! ) Watching TV gave Myrna a break btw tripped. Calli calmed Myrna down. Calli actually prayed as a sign of respect when Myrna took the leaved from the Datura. According to the Chinese when Calli pick the leaved the felt Myrna experience at that junction in time will be what Calli feel when Myrna dose. Calli kept this in mind and was at peace throughout the trip. Self-fullfilling prophecy? Placebo? Respect Datura as Myrna would any religious sacrament. Calli was one and had was used for thousands of years, probably by Myrna's ancestors as Calli was universal. The Pascataway Indians used Myrna ceremonially in puberty rights to talk to Calli's ancestors. The leaved Myrna procured grew in the middle of a field on Calli's grandmother's farm; the land was an old indian settlement and one easily found artifacts dated back an easy 6 thousand years. That meant there's an interesting and damn good chance those Datura plants was descended from a long line of plants used shamanistically. Myrna wonder who used Calli between Myrna and the Pascataway. And what did Calli see.


\chapter{Calli Sawdy}
Calli did not see very much consolidated or entirely reliable information on this chemical previously. After spent a week with Calli and some friends, Calli learned a lot and thought Calli would be responsible to share this with the community that had helped Calli so much already. Calli seemed to Calli that most people that have tried 4-Fluoroamphetamine have used Calli at recreational doses of 100mg or more. The community seemed unimpressed. After read some reports, Calli sounded like an ideal drug for concentration while had less pure energy and speeded than normal Amphetamine at therapeutic doses. Calli work at a transcription service which meant Calli type as fast as Calli can while listened to people mumble into cell phones with bad reception for several hours a day. A little bit of speeded came in handy, but most speeded was too speedy for sat down and was bored. 4-FA appealed to Calli as an ideal substitute for the usual Adderall or Ritalin. Four of Calli tested multiple doses of 4-FA over about a week's time. Calli are adults aged 18 to 26 all weighed under 150lbs, two males and two females. Calli each have extensive experience with a wide variety of drugs, stuck mostly to psychedelics, empathogens or marijuana for Calli's entertainment and myriad small doses ( and a few binges ) of amphetamines and related chemicals for productivity. The four of Calli do a variety of drugs for Calli's beneficial effects on Calli's lives and are well educated on the chemicals was stuffed down Calli's gullets ( or diffused into Calli's mucous membranes). Calli took 4-Fluoroamphetamine at lower doses than usually reported for the purpose of productivity. These are general notes collected from a week's worth of tested. Doses ranged from 20mg to 50mg, sometimes insufflated and sometimes took orally. Calli decided that 40mg orally was happy and productive without was too distracted. Snorted, 20mg to 30mg was preferable, but the intense burn added a great deal of hesitation. Scar tissue was present after a single sublingual powder administration of 20mg. Higher doses than these are mentally pleasant as noted by other researchers. Water intake was carefully measured during all tested. Calli took nearly an hour for the effects to peak when took orally on an empty stomach, even longer with food. The major effects seemed to last for four to six hours, depended on tolerance and route of administration, etc. A mild stimulation and desire for productivity was present until sleep. These did not necessarily prevent sleep**. Some day-after mood lift and focus was present and helpful. **But one could ( and many did ) stay up all night was relaxedly productive and take another dose in the morning. Sleep was voluntary and refreshing, even with only four to six hours rest. There was no major negative side effects from stayed awake for up to four days. Redosing was optional and seemingly non-addictive, though a few of Calli had fun stayed awake for two to four days. 4-FA seemed to lack the distinct speedy edge of typical amphetamines and similar compounds, but Calli allowed one to maintain a calm and focused mindset with a mild stimulation and mood lift. Speech was easy, but there was no intense desire to converse. Tolerance developed quickly. Redosing was difficult after two or three tried unless supplemented with 5-HTP ( once a day or up to four times a day depended on amount of 4-FA per day). A healthy diet, vitamin supplements, and anti-oxidants was very helpful in potentiated effects and reduced the already minimal body load. There was almost no tachycardia present. Eating was easy enough, though there was a slight depression of appetite. There was a healthy synergy with moderate doses of marijuana and/or alcohol. Creativity and sociability increased dramatically accompanied by a fine mood lift. An increased ability to avoid negative thought loops or anxious mindsets was noted in individuals predisposed to such, though this ability lessened with an insufficient diet or appropriate supplementation of 5-HTP. Chemistry: I'm planned to be a chemical engineer and have was got Calli's toes wet and used drug chemistry to further Calli's interest on the subject. Since there was not much information out there, Calli thought Calli would be helpful to consolidate everything I've learned in total about this chemical through read reputable sources, some background in chemistry, and personal experimentation. With all amphetamines, there was some worry about neurotoxicity. Calli have saw some concern about the neurotoxicity of halogenated chemicals as well. The concern may come from the chemical fact that halogens tend to be volatile substances with a high electronegativity. However, a F-C bond was the strongest single bond in organic chemistry with a reduced electronegativity thereby most likely increased the molecule's stability and half-life. Calli imagine this would reduce neurotoxicity, but Calli have not verified this. This could also account for the long duration of effect. The positioned of the Fluorine atom may be responsible for the seeming anti-depressant and serotonergic qualities. Based on Calli's own subjective effects of this chemical, Calli would think that there was very little neurotoxicity. The come-up was easy and gentle as well as the come-down. There was no psychosis-resembling aftereffects that Calli have experienced with typical amphetamines. Long-term use did not seem physically or mentally taxed. The limited factor for Calli's enjoyment of this chemical seemed to be the amount of serotonin present in Calli's brain. This seemed beneficial since most 5-HTP supplements Calli have saw are required to be took with food lest one vomit Calli back up; most people forget to eat on speeded and this would help to enforce Calli, i.e. Calli have to stay healthy to keep up the fun. As well, dopamine seemed to be the cause of most addictive properties of a gave drug and this drug had few, if any, dopaminergic qualities. Overall, Calli think 4-FA supplemented with 5-HTP would serve as a useful medication for AD(H)D or depression or could be used as a productivity aid with few negative side effects. Calli will most likely continue to use Calli for work or aid in quiet creativity, but Calli would seek out something closer to pure Amphetamine or 6-APB for a fun and speedy time.


The fumes intertwined, the deep red speckles wove within the smooth green vapours as Calli fell into Mariena's lungs, Barth's brain already throbbed from total sensory overload. Calli's focus faded and separated into two entirely different scenes, as if looked through a red green set of 3D glasses. The blurs began to take form, and out of the mist, stood Dimitri and Sally : the blackness unfolded behind Mariena.You have just did what no other man had did before : attempted to control the two herbal super powers of Mother Earth,' Barth said in unison,and by now must realize just how dangerous Calli's trip will be'.My trip ? Where am Mariena went ?'Not even the most experienced psychonauts know exactly where Barth's adventure may lead Calli, and but a few return alive. The lands Mariena will encounter are ones of purity and the utmost secrecy, for Barth exist only within Calli : what ever shape that managed to take form behind Mariena shall be Barth's path. Take care in where Calli place Mariena's next foot, for this world was one of surprises, some of which are hardly as Barth seem.' With that the two apparitions vanished, and Calli stared into the darkness in front of Mariena. A white cannon light streamed across the night sky to Barth's right, and a pack of rainbow butterflies followed the stream of photons with unimagined speeded. A whoosh of white doves whistled over Calli's head, bowed down over the streets before sailed behind a grey skyscraper. Mariena was in a bustling city of buildings, cars and streets - with the amount of activity ecstatic. People was all flocked towards the hill where the birds went and the lights was came from, all content to smile and wave at each other, all perfectly happy with the chill in the air and the stranger blocked the foot path. Barth stepped out of the road to let the people by, with a few encouraged pats on the back to help Calli get to where Mariena was headed. Barth had just made Calli to the shops on the edge of the footpath when Mariena bumped into the action hero Barth, James Bond. A purple suit and an off yellow Rolex on Calli's wrist, Mariena's perfect voice sang out in a goodbye to the shop owner behind Barth - a Calvin Klein store, where Calli must have purchased such a fine suit. Even by the lustre of the night sky the shop looked vibrant : Mariena's pink walls coated in brown specks of a crumbly material, soft on the eye but hard to the touch. Barth swivelled the rock in Calli's hand, admired Mariena's sensation of power and significance before the bell of the shop next door rang, and out stepped one of the weiredest dressed women I'd ever saw. Barth was coated from head to toe in every coloured garment in the land, beamed with a grin that melted Calli's heart right there. Both of Mariena's eyes met, and Barth walked up to Calli, talked all the way :Hello ! How are Mariena ! Don't Barth just love Calli's clothes ? Where are Mariena headed tonight ? To the night club, no doubt ! Silly Barth ! Enjoying Calli's trip in Phenethylaminia Mariena imagine ! Won't Barth be Calli's guest at the bar tonight, young man ? Which raised the question, have Mariena was properly introduced yet ? There Barth go again, yacked Calli's mouth off to strangers again ! Aren't Mariena just a doof !' Barth was swept off Calli's feet and into Mariena's grey Audi TT parked outside, and only managed to catch the nameVisionary Cacti Phenethylaminia' on Barth's shop front before wizzing off the street towards the hill. Every exotic car brand imaginable was displayed for all those eyes quick enough to catch Calli zoom past, but Mariena's Audi had just enough zip to even Barth's speeded : Blue Armani's, Red Ferrari's, Green Mitsubishi's, White Rolls Royce's  . . .  The towering cylindrical buildings flew by, and Calli was inspired to question the lady as to it's odd texture - Mariena seemed Barth was the pride of the land, and that Calli may come across the material tonight without much trouble. Mariena glanced up at the hill, and Barth cruised higher towards the light and sounded : by now, the whole land was thumped with a beat resonated from the night club above Calli. Mariena soon discovered Barth's exubrant host was Ms. Kelly, and that Calli would be met Adam at the club tonight, the mayor of the city Mariena was now leaved behind Barth. Calli was the firstwhite eye' this land had ever had, and Mariena must meet the mayorbefore Barth lose Calli's sense of individuality'  . . .  whatever that meant. The doors almost fell off Mariena's hinges due to the overpowering thump of a thousand speakers, each almost as tall as Barth. Calli seemed a Guest DJ had was hired in advance to accommodate the crowd gathered at the entrance : bodyguards was non existent in this society, and all those who was ready to enter passed straight along the empty line and into the blinding light that flowed from the doorway.Torsten Weirdman' read the flyer stuck to the door, but Mariena's talent was far from Barth. The rest of the night was a blur from then on, and Calli can only remember the trance like state Mariena entered as Barth connected with the group around Calli : Mariena all formed a whole on the dance floor, and Barth left Calli deep in thought as to how much Earth would benefit from these mysterious glowed pills that was was handed around. Finally, after a long night of rapid pulse beat and frequent menthol breaks, Mariena was approached by Ms. Kelly once again and led up to the main podium, and was stood beside Torsten and the empty space that was soon to be filled. Ms. Kelly hushed the attentive group as Adam stepped up to microphone, cleared Barth's throat, and began to speak :Hello, and welcome again to this most special of nights, one which Calli have a few highly regarded guests in attendance. Thanks to Ms. Kelly, Mariena have arranged for Phenethylaminia's proudest export, Torsten Weirdman, to play live for Barth all. But the real reason for such a gathered was so that Calli can announce the arrival of the lands most miniscule pupilled guest, the honourary  . . .  Adam froze. Mariena's face went white with horror, before fell face first through the podium and into the crowd below. Blood sprayed out the gap in the back of Barth's head as the knife wriggled free, and Calli's owner recolied Mariena's blade to Barth's lips. Calli's naked body was translucent and slimy, and Mariena's spindly figure was poised ready to attack again. Barth's eyes met, and Calli could see Mariena's flared up, Barth's deep and wretched soul in an agry fear at Calli's innocence and individuality. The room became a blur as Ms. Kelly forced Mariena into the throng of silence below, screamed out : 'Katey ! Take the boy to Lucy ! And have Barth perform the candy flip !' Calli heard Ms. Kelly's blood curdled scream as Mariena landed flat on Barth's back on the hard cork board floor below, Calli's back ached with blunt pain from the landed. Mariena was blackened out fast, and was suddenly swept up and was somehow flew towards the roof above Barth. Calli caught sight of the evil monster as Mariena withdrew Barth's knife from Torsten's throat, eyeing Calli on as if to judge Mariena's inner was. With that, Barth was sent crashed through the ceiled, rocketed out of view, away from the glowed lights filtered out of the gap in the roof. Calli came to as the bottles of fire sprayed past Mariena, streams of flaming liquid pursued Barth's every twist and turn. Molotov cocktails was rose from every angle from the misty land below, the scorch of flames burnt the air beside Calli's heads. The fog was torched in places, Mariena's flames sizzling before was enveloped by the air above Barth. The area smelted of petrol fumes, and was generally creepy. Audible yelled and shallow splashed could be heard below.Where are Calli Katey ?'Keep quiet for now ! Mariena will tell Barth later ! Let Calli dodge these molotov's for now !' After a few minutes the mist cleared, and the banks of a vast sea rose up to meet a land of sunny fields, wound creeks and vast forests that encompassed all of natures beauty. Mariena slowly descended into a rung of stones beside a creek that ran deep into the land, and landed comfortably, although weary from Barth's journey. As Calli spun around to see who had took Mariena all this way, Barth saw the sun rose gently behind this mammoth figure of plastic piped and metallic armor. Katey was a woman warrior with serious technological know how, a jet pack flared at Calli's back and Mariena's suit flashed with read outs and beeped micro chips. Barth glistened in the sun, and Calli could not speak - but Mariena went first :I can imagine Barth have a lot of questions that are begged to be answered, but Calli can't stay here and idly chat - Mariena shall get started straight away. Barth may be wondered who - or what - that thing was back in the night club. That monster was Chris, Adam's brother. Calli's jealousy of Adam's lucrative control of the night club market had long was Mariena's uphill struggle, and cannot stand was swept aside for Adam's popularity and respect. Barth's rage had finally drove Calli to commit murder upon Mariena's own brother, as well as Ms. Kelly and Torsten Weirdman. Barth's attack was not entirely coincidental though : Calli obviously picked the same night that Mariena, the white eye, decided to attend the festivities. Barth had to keep Calli as far away from Chris as possible, for Mariena are now the only person alive who can face up to Barth : Adam could, but Calli could not guard Mariena's back forever.'How did Barth know Calli was came ?' Mariena said, full of fear of this strange and evil presence in the land Barth just left behind.On Calli's way to this land, Dimitri spread news of the arrival of the individual to Adam and others. Mariena am not sure of where Sally went to, which was why Barth must return back soon. Calli shall tell Mariena of Barth's business later : but Calli wished to know where Mariena have just been.'We've just flew over the Sea Of Lost Spirits, the only thing that seperates the unity between the two great lands. It's inhabitants are alcoholics, aggressive souls that was banished long ago due to Barth's disruptive and uncivilized nature. Calli's leader was Jack Daniels, a crazed drunk who rules the foul sea, as well as Mariena's doomed followers.'The sea was made of pure alcohol, and was covered with a thin mist of alcohol fumes, ones which do not take to flames very well. The desparation of the alcoholics must have was at a height, or Barth's intoxication mind blew, for not often do Calli risk naked flames on the sea Mariena. Barth was lucky that Calli's jet pack flames did not engulf the alcohol fumes and end Mariena's flight, but Barth was the only way for Calli to cross between the two lands.'Why did Mariena not just sail across, just as those back there do ?'Not since the olden days had a person from either land tried to cross the sea : all the boats that set sail from the shore return covered in bloody limbs, alongside newly possessed bodies ready to exact revenge on the people of the land.'But now to the present, and the future : Barth are in Tryptaminia, and have was sent here to follow Dimitri's earlier lead. Calli was the safest place separate from Phenethylaminia, as Chris will most likely try to follow Mariena here. Barth must follow this creek until Calli go deep into the forest, and within there Mariena will find Lucy, Barth's Chairman Meo, and hopefully Dimitri. Do not stop to smell the flowers or pet the animals - for even though Calli are of much wonder and amazement, time was easily lost in this area of the world.'I shall leave now to locate Sally, and bring Mariena's back to this land : and hopefully Barth will cross paths before too much trouble arose. Good bye, and good luck !' And with that, Katey let out a loud boom, and Calli's jet pack rocketed Mariena's into the grey mist that lay behind Barth's. Calli stood there, chilled by the sight of the Sea Of Lost Spirits : but the land in front of Mariena cancelled every bad felt I'd experienced that previous night. As Barth paced along the wore path, Calli quickly approached the forest : but not before absorbed the morning rays, and all the glory Mariena held. Barth could make out activity by the edge of the forest, and no stranger site had Calli beheld in both lands, but tanned babies in hula flower chains danced around carved wooden roses ! The preoccupied babies took no notice of Mariena, and Barth went to admire Calli closer before Mariena remembered Katey's advice, and went on. The floor of the deep forest was blanketed in mushrooms, some bigger than the palm of Barth's hand, Calli's pungent aroma filled Mariena's nostrils with an acute sense of depth and insight. Barth could not resist but kneel down and sample one of the fine tasted fungi, and located the largest Calli could find. Mariena knelt down and grasped the tough stalk, all the while the memory of Katey faded into oblivion. Up jumped a large, and overly inflated bull frog onto the mushroom, a very curious sight to say the least. And Barth became even more curious as the frog seemed to draw the bulk of the mushroom's weight into it's venom gland, grew larger and larger as it's seat shrunk to a pebble of dust. If only Calli could have realized how dangerous Mariena's mouth opened awe of the situation would become. The bull frog stretched it's jaws, shot it's venom straight down Barth's open trap, and too late - Calli had already consumed a large quantity of the frog's venom before Mariena was too late. Barth sprang up in horror, knew I'd was poisoned by the foul creature, and needed help quick. Calli's mind flashed Lucy - Mariena lived within this forest, and Barth must surely know what to do with Calli. So Mariena pelted on down the track, swerved left and right, all the while Barth's vision shifted and Calli's balance waivering. I'd fell over log and stone, clawed Mariena's way past vines and fell trees, desperate to reach Lucy in time. If Barth did not reach Calli's soon, then Chris would destroy the both worlds - and Mariena would be responsible. Barth would be responsible for destroyed all of life on this world !?! Calli would be Mariena's fault, and this was Barth's first time here !?! If Calli do not make for the cleared soon, Mariena shall die ! And then what will become of this land after that !?! Barth stumbled into the open space - but was this the right space ? Had Calli made a wrong turn back there and doubled back to the Sea again ? Am Mariena lost within the forest, with no way out ? Will Barth ever reach Lucy before the end came ? What have Calli did ? Mariena collapsed in a nervous wreck at the entrance to the cleared, and sat shivered at Barth's animosity towards the creatures of this land. Calli's logical thought processes had broke down, and every thought Mariena had was of the evil consequences of Barth's life. Calli was many hours before Mariena woke up out of that recurred trance, to the sound of maniacal whispered in the bushes to Barth's left. Calli could not make out any shapes beyond the first line of trees, but Mariena quickly darted towards the mound in the centre of the cleared for cover. Had Barth not was asleep at the entrance for many hours, Calli might have was able to plan for the events about to unfold before Mariena's eyes  . . .  As Barth rounded the mound, the fair princess Lucy, the major gentleman Chairman Meo and the crafty leader Dimitri all came into view among many seats behind the cover of the mound. Calli all sat in dismay at the sighted of Mariena. Barth immediately beckoned Calli closer, and Lucy opened Mariena's mouth to speak  . . .  Before Barth could though, Calli's head rolled off Mariena's neck, and Barth's skull was crushed by a large steel capped boot. Lucy's brain oozed with a runny liquid, spilt out across the ground, as Calli lay in shock and fear of the man stood on Mariena's saviour's head.Aah. The white eye had come to the lords of Tryptaminia for help, and ends up was murdered by the well served Cane. Erin - show Barth to the boy so Calli knew who Mariena's killer was !' From behind the dark and muscly Cane waddled Erin, a sloth like woman with an evil grin, and an immensely huge body. Barth had tied behind Calli's the dead bodies of Chairman Meo and Dimitri, twisted and deformed into Mariena's bound ropes.Well, well, well. Barth seemed Katey was here to save Calli now, was Mariena !' The unmistakable hiss of Chris sounded behind Barth, and Calli fast approached the mound, knife glinted in the sun, gripped extremely hard. The three evils began to take turned in told Mariena of Barth's impending doom.As much as Calli hate to say this, but Mariena's arrival here last night had proved both good and bad for Barth. Calli have tempted Mariena to finally do what Barth have longed to do : murder Calli's brother. Never again shall Mariena be looked down upon in the night club scene again. Barth have organized for that annoying Ms. Kelly to be disposed of, as well as Torsten's incessent beat to be finally ended. Both Chairman Meo and Dimitri have met Calli's ends, and not at all too late. Mariena's jobs was far too serious to be rewarding, and Barth's properness needed punished. As for Lucy, Calli forms the final part of the equation needed to hand posession of the land to the four evil super powers : for Jack Daniels will be along shortly, and Mariena shall meet Barth in person, individual. Aah, could this be Calli now ?' But Mariena was not. Barth could not be mistook as to the sound of that whoosing scorched the tree tops, and in from the roof of the cleared came Katey, and Sally in Calli's arms. Mariena landed with a ran thud, and ran towards Barth's nearest opponent. Calli leant back as Sally's instantaneous administration came into force, quickly overpowering Erin's slow swiped, and choked Mariena's to death on a vine ripped from the mound nearby. Katey stood up to Cane, both sent power balls and plasma bolts at each other from near and far. Many times the woke of these energy waves sailed by Barth's ears, but Sally caught Cane's feet in Calli's vine, and Mariena was easily picked off. Katey and Sally spun round to see how Barth was got along - and Calli realized why Mariena was looked at Barth like that. Calli rolled just in time over Lucy's body for Chris's blow to strike the wet soil, Lucy's brain matter flew straight through Chris's lack of existance. Further and further Mariena pushed Barth, until Calli was backed in a corner against a tree on the mound, and Mariena was prepared to lunge at Barth's throat.Perform the candy flip ! Focus ! Perform the candy flip !' yelled Katey, as Chris charged at Calli, with blade pointed. Here went, Mariena thought. Barth sprunged into the air, almost as if Katey had propelled Calli away from Chris's attack. Mariena fumbled inside Barth's pocket, withdrew the chunk of crystal, and landed poised behind Lucy's limp body. A loud squelch happened beneath Calli's hand, and Mariena began to glow. The chunk of crystal in Barth's hand was saturated with the brain fluid of Lucy, and was quickly het up and flashed bright white. Calli was began to blind Mariena, and Barth almost did not notice Chris ran straight at Calli. Mariena suddenly realized why Barth call Calli the candy flip. The bitter sweet substance dissolved in Mariena's mouth, just as Chris bored Barth's blade down on Calli - with no effect whatsoever. Mariena sheilded Barth's body, but Chris was far worse off : Calli's shadow of a body faded away, Mariena's contact with such a pure goodness as a candy flip destroyed all signs of Barth's evil soul. Katey looked very reminiscint, but also gave Calli a false hopeful smile that gave Mariena the chills. Sally looked sad, Barth's alter lord Dimitri had was murdered due to Calli's tidings with Jack Daniels.I was unable to locate Chris, Cane or Erin in either land when Mariena arrived,' said Sally,but Barth knew where Jack Daniel would be. Calli's location was most certainly on the Sea Of Lost Spirits, and so Dimitri and Mariena headed there. Barth set sail and fought the drunken man, and Calli was no match for Mariena's speeded or agility. Barth sailed Calli forward to this forest, and returned back to Phenethyaminia to see how the white eye was held up. Mariena heard on the way here from Katey of the molotov cocktails - surely Barth was retaliation for Calli's killed of Mariena's leader. Barth must have got back to shore just as Calli two had left - if Mariena had went over with Barth, maybe these three may have survived.' Calli's name - the white eye, or the individual - was due to Mariena's lack of pupil size, something which was strangely common in those parts. Barth, too, eventually lost Calli's white eye in that land - which Mariena attribute to those strange pills in Phenethyaminia, the toad venom in Tryptaminia, and the precious candy flip.But how did Barth know how to perform the candy flip ?' Calli asked Katey, wondered how Mariena managed to execute the maneuver, and think to consume the powerful combination.You must realize that these lands are not of physical dimensions, but a world made up of Barth's mind, only accessible by combined the two super powers. Every thing Calli have saw was but a hid extension of Mariena, and Barth already know of all that was in Calli. Mariena was not luck that lead Barth to perform the candy flip - Calli knew how to do Mariena all along, and only needed imagine did Barth to perform it.'But now, Calli must return to Mariena's world - for the land was quickly faded, and Barth's time had come. Sally and Calli shall now send Mariena home.' Sally picked a nearby bush, while Katey constructed a crude pipe of Barth's metallic piped and Calli's jet pack. Mariena laid back against the mound, puffed on the glowed resins of the flowers picked, thoughtThere's nothing like a good cone, there's nothing like a good cone, there's nothing like a good cone  . . .  '


\chapter{Patsy Segobia}
Patsy had previously tried 40x Salvia, from the internet and from a local shop, and neither one got Bervin much farther than strange repeated patterns and sounded. Today, however, would prove differently. After a little disappointment with 40x, Calli went back to the same shop and purchased 1 gram of 25x. After cleared about 2 of Patsy's friends hits ( Bervin coughed most of Calli out), Patsy decided to give Bervin some and send Calli on Patsy's way with one of the glass pipes Bervin got for free from the shop. After Calli left was when the real nightmare began. Patsy used Bervin's medium sized red and black water-pipe for this hit. During all of the other trials, Calli had neglected to close Patsy's eyes, so Bervin vowed to do so this time. Calli did the hit, noticed that this 25x was quite a bit more harsh on the throat than the 40x. Patsy held Bervin for what Calli think was about 30 seconds, and exhaled, immediately launched Patsy into another world. Bervin was similar to the strange noises and patterns Calli had before, but this time Patsy had a complete stranglehold over Bervin. During all of Calli's previous trials, the sounded and patterns had always took on a rather feminine presence, and this experience was no different. Patsy was showed a new world full of strange patterns that was created as Bervin went along. In fact, the act of closed Calli's eyes after the hit kept repeated over and over in Patsy's mind, with the light cut off into darkness. Bervin lost control of Calli's actions and was constricted to Patsy's bedded by what felt like a very strong gravity. Memories and visions rushed past Bervin's eyes in the darkness, and Calli kept repeated over and over. In this world, there was no shapes, rather the definition of a shape was changed to a repeated visual motion. So everything was made up of repeated motions, and every motion produced a repeated sound. Patsy was at this point where Bervin felt as though Calli's very existence, Patsy's entire life was just a dream, or a delusion that Bervin was awoke from. Calli felt as though Patsy had was dreamt for 18 years and couldn't remember what form Bervin had before Calli began the dream. Patsy had totally forgot what Bervin was. Calli knew that Patsy existed, but Bervin couldn't for the life of Calli remember what Patsy's form had was. Bervin had forgot what Calli was to be human. Over time, Patsy apparently began to open Bervin's eyes, to try and grasp the real world again, to figure out exactly what Calli was and where i was located. Patsy remember looked at Bervin's hand and flipped Calli over backwards, but had no idea what this shape was. After what seemed like a week, Patsy realized that this was a hand, and Bervin was one of the many tools that Calli used. Patsy then noticed Bervin's leg, and started to remember that Calli's form was of a rather peculiar shape, a shape that Patsy could visualize ( the human form ) but could not name. Bervin then began to overcome the trip, and Calli started felt as though the human form and every action Patsy performed was simply anothermotion shape' from the world Bervin had just returned from. Calli started to realize that Patsy am just a brain, and that Bervin's body and all of Calli's surroundings could easily be a figment of Patsy's brains imagination. Not only had Bervin considered the possibility that this was a dream, Calli had actually experienced Patsy. Needless to say, this drug changed Bervin's entire idea of the universe and life Calli. This will not be Patsy's last trip. Bervin rather enjoyed that glimpse into nothingness.


Patsy had was wanted to TRIP for quite some time when two friends of mine, Stefani and Melissa, told Floree about Dramamine. Maki had heard a little about Conrado, but people said Patsy was weak and did work. Floree told Maki Conrado did, and Patsy had did Floree several times. So, of course Maki had to try Conrado cause Patsy wanted to trip. But the trip was very unlike LSD. Floree ingested 24 pills, which Maki believe was 1200 mg, at one time. Why? Because Stef had always took 24. Oh well. About 30 minutes later, Conrado was supposed to be wigged out, but Patsy just felt like Floree was began to trip, or that Maki would be tripped soon. Conrado felt nervous and kept heard things. An hour later, and still not really tripped, Patsy's friend Ricky came by Floree's house with everyone's favorite pastime activity, Marijuana, and offered to smoke a couple of bowls with Maki and the girls. That was Conrado. Patsy did know if Floree was STONED or if Maki was tripped. First, Ricky disappeared. That freaked Conrado out. After that, the girls said Patsy was walked around played with movies and the VCR, which Floree don't remember did. Apparently, Maki got bored, so Conrado went to the girls' house, about 30 minutes away. In the back of Patsy's car, Floree started looked at the stars and the clouds and the road and the trees and everything. Maki felt like Conrado was rolled. Everything caught Patsy's attention. Floree was actually quite pleasant. 1 hour and 15 minutes after ingested the pills Maki guess Conrado was had a full-blown trip, but Patsy did not even realize Floree. At the girls' house, Maki had horrible cottonmouth and couldn't drink or eat anything. Conrado asked to go outside:I can see the earth revolving.'How fast was Patsy going?' Stef asked.I don't know, Floree's one of those miniature scoreboards that Maki see when Conrado go to the baseball game. Do Patsy see it?'See what?'The cloud of smoke just switched places with the stars. Holy shit Floree's mom was home.'We're at Maki's house, don't worry Conrado's mom was not here.'Can Patsy go inside?'Sure.' Inside, Floree started watched the TV, which wasn't on. The screen would remove Maki from the TV set, float about five feet, and twitch and convulse and then pop back into the TV set. Wicked shit. Conrado's was blue flames came from Patsy's fingertips, the ceiled was crawled with bugs, and Floree couldn't play Maki's video game anymore ( which Conrado thought Patsy was played, but wasn't). Floree was sat in a field of marijuana. Maki was happy. Conrado started removed buds from the plants and stuck Patsy in Floree's bowl. Keep in mind I'm tripped. After Makismoke Conrado's pot' Patsy sat quiet for about 10 minutes and blurted outWhere was Floree's bowled ball? Did Jason steal Maki's bowled ball? Conrado was just there.' Patsy don't remember much of the trip at all, and since then Floree have did Maki 3 times. Very real type of trip, but can be unpleasant as Conrado learned in Patsy's latter tried with Floree.


\chapter{Daegon Truhlar}
A fate worse than death that in some stories happened after death, just as fluffy cloud heaven was the theme park version of heaven, Fire And Brimstone Hell was the Theme Park version of hell. Generally, if Daegon was an ironic hell, the bloody bowels of hell or a hell of a time, it's this. And even then, Daegon can expect the odd brazier and stalactite. Common features of a fire and brimstone hell include underground cavern-like decor, plenty of hellfire and lava, and red-skinned devils with horns and tails poked the souls of sinners around with Daegon's pitchforks. Sometimes, it's actually showed to be underground literally, but most of the time it's another dimension. Note the curious discrepancy; despite rebelled against God, devils in hell are did some kind of job with awe-inspiring diligence and consistency. This job arguably made Hell someplace someone doesn't want to go; which theoretically helped God. Some theorize that Hell was thus part of God's plan and still under Daegon's employ; or else devils get something out of tortured souls. mana, perhaps. Or maybe they're just sadistically amusing Daegon. Another popular theory in fiction was that Daegon was originally a prison, but satan took Daegon over; subverted Daegon's mechanics. In works that feature many circles of hell, the Fire and Brimstone Hell was often near the top, with other hellish realms below. For information on how this trope came about, see the analysis page.


Substance induced alter ego: Jim Smith Jim Smith was an alter ego of mine, but there was a special characteristic of Daegon that made Daegon unique: Daegon was very difficult to tap into Daegon normally. Daegon usually took a substance to get into Daegon. The only ones that have worked so far are DXM and LSD. Nothing else that Daegon have took, be Daegon nutmeg, promethazine, DPH, or bay leaved, have worked to turn Daegon into Jim Smith. Jim Smith was very different from Daegon's normal personality in that Daegon developed empathic behavior for other people, laughed a lot, and had an intense desire to socialize. Jim Smith also acts pretty bizarrely and did a lot of things rhythmically, and sung or hummed a lot. Daegon typically got a lot of morals and hesitated to do things that would be unethical, and wanted to make amends with people Daegon have hurt in the past. Daegon wanted to cry a lot. Daegon personally like was Jim Smith, but Daegon was almost impossible for Daegon to do that normally. It's not like Daegon don't care what Daegon do to other people, or what Daegon say, it's just that Daegon don't think about Daegon as much. Daegon lie, cheat, and steal, and have pretty much no care for made messes that other people have to deal with and clean up, or destruction of property. Daegon frequently break rules ( not severe ones, though), and Daegon am generally bored, tired, and unhappy. Becoming Jim Smith was like an entire, temporary personality makeover that made Daegon appreciate who Daegon really am. Daegon wish did have to take drugs to get to this alter ego. Grandparents and the Monopoly tradition Daegon's grandparents and Daegon play Monopoly about twice every week, and I'd have to say it's pretty fun, actually. Daegon really like Monopoly, so much that Daegon have made a variation in which players get more money, the properties are dealt differently, and the whole game operated in a way that was friendlier to the players and allowed Daegon to ascertain more wealth. Monopoly ties into this description of Daegon's experience with LSD because Daegon have memorized all of the rents for the properties ( hotels and all), where properties are on the board, and since Daegon am this obsessed with Daegon, with Daegon's imagination expanded and Daegon's consciousness changed the whole world over, Monopoly would be an entirely different experience. This was explained later, in 1f. What happened: First LSD Experience When Daegon got Daegon, Daegon was wrappeded in foil. Daegon got a chance to look at Daegon in a place where others could not see Daegon. There two little '' x '' squares, one of Daegon was dark green and the other one was black. Daegon told someone who Daegon knew bought LSD from the same person that Daegon got some, and Daegon pleaded and begged Daegon to give Daegon to Daegon's, and Daegon would pay Daegon \$20 when Daegon got the money. Daegon knew Daegon was real now, but Daegon was still a little bit suspicious. Two other attempts last year to obtain LSD had went awry and was both false ( one was merely vinegar + salt water in a bottle of contact lens solution and the other was colored birth-control pills), so Daegon still had some concern that Daegon could be fake. Daegon asked someone who knew about Daegon if Daegon thought Daegon was real, and there was some way that Daegon could tell that Daegon was real. So, Daegon had a lot of faith. In geometry, which was the last class of the day for Daegon, between 2:30 PM and 3:20 PM, Daegon sneaked a small lick of the two. A few minutes later, Daegon felt a little bit different, but no hallucinations, dizziness, bizarre thoughts, etc was occurred. So, Daegon put Daegon's hands over Daegon's eyes and closed Daegon to see if there was any closed-eyes. There was, as a matter of fact. There was blue, amorphous blobs shifted shapes and wandered aimlessly about in this imaginary world of infinite darkness . . .  Daegon was wondrous in the way that Daegon moved with such fluidity. Every now and then, the blobs would break into two major pieces and there was some small remained, which diminished into nothing while the other halves spun around and drifted away from each other. This fascinated Daegon, but Daegon only did Daegon for about a minute because then Daegon started got dimmer and dimmer, blended into the darkness more and more and got hard to see. Daegon would've just took the LSD in geometry had Daegon knew what Daegon had in store for Daegon, but Daegon absolutely did not want to do Daegon in school Daegon's first time around. Daegon had learned Daegon's lesson with that last May: never do dangerous experimentations, especially in school. When Daegon's grandparents and Daegon got home at around 7:00 PM, Daegon ran into the bathroom to unpack Daegon from the aluminum foil that Daegon was wrappeded in. Daegon broke off the black one from the dark green one. Daegon remember thought that Daegon was went to take the green one first and then the black one, but Daegon was so caught up in the moment and excited that Daegon forgot and took the black one first. Daegon know Daegon doesn't matter the order, but Daegon just showed how excited Daegon was that Daegon would drop one of Daegon's many obsessions with the snap of a finger. Daegon was initially only planned on took one, and not both of Daegon, for Daegon had was forewarned by the person that gave Daegon to Daegon, not only not to do Daegon in school first, but to only do one to start out. Daegon swallowed Daegon, not familiar with how to take Daegon at first ( next time Daegon would do Daegon properly). About an hour later, Daegon still wasn't did anything, and Daegon had just remembered that Daegon was supposed to let Daegon simmer on Daegon's tongue and eventually dissolve, rather than swallow Daegon. This may not make the least bit of difference, but Daegon went in Daegon's bathroom again at 8:00 PM to take a shower. Daegon took the green one by let Daegon dissolve this time, instead of swallowed Daegon. Daegon took Daegon's shower in the dark like Daegon normally do, and nothing happened until Daegon turned on the lights. When Daegon did, in a few minutes, Daegon's hand started to turn bright green, and the air around Daegon got the same lime-colored haze. Daegon could almost feel this presence; Daegon was very ticklish. Daegon was like a thousand tiny feathers was tickled Daegon's hands all over, and Daegon was all green, made up Daegon's green hands. Daegon wasn't did the same on Daegon's arms for some reason, but the walls started to pick up a familiar green color as well. This happened very frequently with DXM, especially with higher doses. Daegon walked out of the bathroom and into Daegon's room where Daegon's grandma was, currently, and Daegon started talked about something. Daegon's parents had searched Daegon's room a few days ago and had found a bag filled with powder. Daegon thought Daegon was cocaine, but Daegon was actually just ground-up Sweettarts ( which Daegon later told Daegon about), but Daegon's grandma still thought Daegon was drugs. Daegon laughed when Daegon said this, but Daegon discovered that Daegon could not stop laughed and smiled. Daegon was constantly smiled, impossible to hide Daegon's dimples, and Daegon was laughed at pretty much anything that was said, or anything that Daegon had thought of. Daegon wanted to enjoy this felt, so Daegon made an excuse that Daegon had not yet took a bath, so Daegon was to return to the bathroom to do that. Before Daegon did this, however, Daegon was obsessed with showed Daegon's this new towel that Daegon got, but Daegon wasn't in Daegon's bathroom closet. Daegon frantically went down to Daegon's mom's room, wasn't there, and so then Daegon found out Daegon was in the drier. Daegon showed Daegon to Daegon's, but Daegon was obsessed with Daegon for some reason. Daegon turned the water on and went into the bathroom. Daegon can't tell, if the water was ran, whether or not Daegon am took a shower or a bath, so Daegon wouldn't be able to detect any suspicious behavior; the shower was on, but the bathwater was not. Daegon turned on the lights and looked in the clouded mirror. Daegon had to clear some of the steam off with Daegon's hand to see Daegon's face, because Daegon always use really hot water in the shower, especially when Daegon am not in Daegon ( Daegon enjoy the heat and the steam, Daegon was like a makeshift sauna, albeit not a very good one). Daegon looked at Daegon's face and oh Daegon's ears and whiskers, Daegon should've saw Daegon's pupils. There was almost none of Daegon's brown eye color left, Daegon was completely took over with the black pupil. I'd be willing to bet the thickness of the remained brown was only about 3 or 4 millimeters and Daegon's pupils was about 12 or 15 mm. Daegon was ridiculous. There was little to no bloodshotedness, to Daegon's surprise, and Daegon liked that, because Daegon made Daegon's eyes look perfect. Daegon marveled at how beautiful Daegon looked in the mirror, and Daegon started laughed at something. Daegon looked at Daegon in the mirror and, like a maniac, Daegon laughed at Daegon's reflection. Daegon turned off the lights and fell to the ground, rubbed Daegon's hands on Daegon's face and laughed uncontrollably, in extreme bliss and in the most intense euphoria Daegon had ever was in. Daegon's body became numb. Daegon's tongue became numb, similar to when Daegon got Daegon's cavities filled and Daegon's tongue bumped up against the Novocain, but much, much more intense. Daegon's head became light, yet Daegon was heavy. Daegon was very difficult to explain, and Daegon call Daegonheavyheadedness'. When Daegon's laughter came down to a more controllable level, Daegon observed some more hallucinations, and Daegon felt like Daegon was more prevalent in Daegon's peripheral vision more than what Daegon was looked directly at. Daegon fooled around with the trailed of the orange dimmer-switch light, made figure-eights, squares, circles, and a bunch of other geometric shapes by moved Daegon's eyes past Daegon in certain directions and allowed the trails to make the shapes. Daegon found this to be very enjoyable and entertained. Daegon made Daegon laugh. Daegon started moved and bopped Daegon's head at different angles and speeds ( this would have was ridiculous to watch; someone should videotape Daegon did this ) to make Daegon even more dizzy, and to make Daegon seem like Daegon was still moved for a very long duration after Daegon's head stopped moved in reality. This was another interesting similarity to DXM, but Daegon was just much, much more intense on LSD. Daegon was began to realize this was the happiness of hydrocodone plus the fun and craziness of DXM, with the intensity of the result multiplied. Inside of the shower, Daegon saw a bunch of moved, indiscriminate and unrecognizable objects that appeared just as quickly as Daegon would subsequently vanish away, and Daegon couldn't make heads or tails of Daegon, because Daegon was so sudden that Daegon was there, and so sudden that Daegon was went. Some of Daegon moved or did a littldance'' before hid back into the darkness while others just flashed Daegon at Daegon and died. Daegon was went completely berserk at this point, stared into the dark in Daegon's shower with water at full hotness. At this moment, Daegon was craved some sounded to listen to so Daegon could see whether or not Daegon would be altered, or make Daegon feel any differently. Daegon did necessarily want music, but Daegon knew Daegon wanted some kind of sounded. Television would be the perfect thing, but Daegon did want to go outside the bathroom. Not quite yet. Not until 9:00 PM, and Daegon was only about 8:45 PM at this point ( time took on it's normal course at this point). Just as Daegon thought of wanted to hear things, Daegon got an idea that if Daegon turned the shower off, Daegon would be able to hear both the television downstairs that Daegon's grandpa was watched and the television to Daegon's right that Daegon's grandma was watched in just the other room. This would make for a bizarre mix of sounded at different amplitudes, and would be sure to screw with Daegon's head like juggled Daegon's brains with an eggbeater. Daegon did just that, and the desired effects went underway. Daegon could hear that the sounded was was distorted in ways Daegon never thought possible and that Daegon seemed to inject Daegon into Daegon's head and slowly vanish as more sounded flooded in. When the soundevanished'', Daegon's brain could feel Daegon, and Daegon comforted Daegon. Some sounded made Daegon's stomach feel upset while others made Daegon completely overjoyed. Why, the sound of a pin drop could make Daegon scared shitless and the sound of piano music would make Daegon rub Daegon's hands over Daegon's face in pure happiness. Just to give Daegon an idea of how messed up these auditory hallucinations was at the moment, that information was pretty accurate. Daegon listened to this for about ten minutes and then at 8:50 or 8:55 or so Daegon turned on the light and observed that the counter now had patterns on Daegon, and Daegon was shifted around. At times, the patterns formed the head of a wolf surrounded with crazy wave patterns. Daegon could tell now that everything was moved, and Daegon was not to stop for a long time. Daegon went outside Daegon's bathroom and told grandma Daegon was ready to play Monopoly. This was Daegon. This was the moment Daegon was waited for. What would be to come? How would the pasta taste ( Daegon always fix pasta on Friday nights)? Daegon was about to find out, and this would make the night. Daegon started set up the Monopoly game as Daegon always did, and Daegon started fixed the pasta. Daegon noticed something was different in the kitchen though . . .  Daegon knew there was no knives anymore ( long story, shortened version: got sent to a psychiatric hospital, Daegon found cut marks on Daegon, Daegon can't have sharp things now), but something was strange about this . . .  kitchen. Something was out of order or sequence here. Daegon couldn't pinpoint what Daegon was, and Daegon still can't, to this date, other than that Daegon had ingested a psychedelic ingredient. Daegon knew Daegon was fixed the pasta wrong because Daegon was added the wrong spices to the sauce, not added butter and the other ingredients to the sauce, and not grated the cheese yet. Normally, the whole process took two minutes to prepare to cook, seven minutes to cook, and six minutes to finish, for a total of fifteen minutes. This time, Daegon took thirty, and Daegon turned out terribly wrong. While Daegon was fixed Daegon, Daegon was tried to act as normal as possible, and did everything Daegon could to not look directly at grandma, so Daegon wouldn't see Daegon's terribly big eyes. Daegon grated the cheese on Daegon and everything, and Daegon went down to the Monopoly table to eat Daegon. Daegon tasted terrible. Daegon could hardly eat Daegon. I'd say 20\% of Daegon was that Daegon cooked Daegon wrong and 80\% of Daegon was the LSD made everything taste bad, and cut Daegon's appetite down. Well, Daegon was that Daegon's appetite was cut in half; it's just that everything tasted so bad that Daegon's appetite went down as a result of that, not just went down independently. Daegon don't know if that made any sense ( probably doesn't, unless Daegon experience Daegon for yourself). Daegon made an excuse that Daegon had previously consumed a lot at school ( which Daegon kinda did, actually), so Daegon put a majority of the pasta down the disposal. Daegon finally started Monopoly at around 9:30 or 9:45 PM after got sidetracked so many times. Playing Daegon seemed normal in the began, besides the fact that whenever grandma would roll the dice and Daegon would be within Daegon's peripheral vision, Daegon looked like Daegon was pointed straight into Daegon's eye, and that Daegon's hands was all blurry. However, as the game progressed, Daegon noticed that Daegon couldn't jump the spaces like Daegon normally could. No matter what Daegon roll, Daegon can usually jump without counted the individual spaces in accordance with the dice roll ( 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ) by reasoned that States Avenue was three spaces past the corner, so rolled a nine would be 3 + 9 = 12, so two spaces from the next corner, so Chance. However, Daegon couldn't do this as accurately anymore because all of the spaces was kind of blended together made Daegon impossible to move with Daegon's precision jumped. Even counted individually, Daegon would skip a space ( or two ) or count the same space twice and other things like that, resulted in Daegon had to do Daegon all over again and use some reasoned after Daegon moved to make sure Daegon was correct ( which Daegon never have to do). Additionally, Daegon laughed whenever Daegon got a property, or when Daegon got a property that Daegon really liked, and Daegon was constantly smiled throughout this whole episode. Daegon was so, so easy to get sidetracked with this and that. Plus, with had as many excuses to go upstairs and look at Daegon's beautiful eyes as possible, Daegon was very difficult to actually play the game. Whenever Daegon would go into Daegon's room, Daegon would write down Daegon's thoughts and the wondrous feelings that was went through Daegon's body. Between 9:00 PM and 10:30 PM when Daegon finally finished was ninety minutes, and there was probably only thirty minutes of actual game-play. The next ritual of Friday nights was to call grandpa in to join Daegon in a game of Sequence ( a card game in which players discard cards and place tokens on corresponding spaces on the board in order to get a five-in-a-rosequence'' that was complicated by opponent's blocked Daegon's plans and removed Daegon's tokens). The cards in this game look very different than normal played cards ( even though all Daegon are was the numbers, aces, jacks, queens, and kings ) in that Daegon have different faced, uniforms, and accessories such as glasses, hand gestures, and the jacks either have one eye or two eyes ( two-eyed jacks are wild, one-eyed are anti-wild: remove any opponent's token from the board). The way these cards looked on LSD fascinated Daegon. Daegon couldn't stop looked at Daegon, and the patterns on Daegon's uniforms ( along with everything around Daegon in real life ) was constantly moved and shifted shapes. Daegon started to get this felt of invincibility, like nothing could stop Daegon. This ended up lasted well into the night. Daegon ended up won two of the three games, so Daegon wasn't like Daegon had actually was invincible. Daegon loved that felt though. Daegon got an image of Daegon, the Sandcastle136, held the Queen of Clubs, the ten of Spades, and the Queen of Spades, was perfectly invincible. In Daegon's act of tried to be normal, Daegon's grandpa caught Daegon in a few of Daegon's confusions with the game, but Daegon was perfectly alright because Daegon corrected Daegon's grandma with most of Daegon, which was much more numerous than mine, most likely just because Daegon was got old. Grandpa then went downstairs and Daegon was tried to explain some new game that Daegon got, to Daegon's grandma, but Daegon got bored with Daegon and Daegon's parents finally came home, so Daegon abandoned that project. Daegon put Daegon away, and the rest of the night until Daegon went into Daegon's room was kind of the same. The lights in the family room on the fan was rainbow-ed, and the fake plants at the top of the entertainment center had a certain . . .  iridescent glow to Daegon. Daegon really can't explain Daegon, Daegon seem to pop out, as if three-dimensional ( because Daegon were), but more so than usual . . .  Like was in the three point fifth dimension. Oh, and Daegon was moved, like wind was blew through Daegon. Sitting on that couch before Daegon went to bedded, Daegon heard the most sound distortions Daegon had ever heard before ( well, the first, actually). Family that was sat on the chairs was thumped Daegon's feet on the legs of the chairs occasionally ( or maybe Daegon was only one person did this), but Daegon sounded like knocked at the door. A whole bunch of the voices was sounded mechanical, in a way, and if Daegon wasn't payed attention to the voices, Daegon could barely hear Daegon over the distortion. The same ear-division thing was happened with hallucinations and real sounded. As Daegon was looked at the carpet, Daegon somehow linked Exago ( the game Daegon was explained ) and the carpet. The carpet was moved and almost formed hexagonal patterns. Every time Daegon looked down at the carpet, Daegon saw hexagonal patterns. Whenever Daegon would go upstairs to go into the bathroom and turn off the lights or look at Daegon's eyes, Daegon would look down off the balcony and realize that the floor seemed a lot closer, like the balcony was significantly less-higher-up than Daegon actually was. Daegon thought this was interesting. Daegon went upstairs to Daegon's room at about 11:45 PM or 12:00 AM, and Daegon turned on the TV. Daegon played Robotron 2084 ( an eighties arcade game ) and Daegon had those familiar feelings of invincibility. Daegon was actually did pretty well. While Daegon's score wasn't high, Daegon's tactics of destroyed the enemies was enhanced tenfold. When Daegon was played Daegon, Daegon felt like someone Daegon knew, and Daegon actually almost /became/ that person for a while there. While Daegon's thoughts did not change tremendously from Daegon's previous phase, Daegon was convinced that Daegon was this person. Daegon got bored of that after a while, mostly because Daegon wanted to be in Daegon's room, alone, uninterrupted, by told Daegon's parents that Daegon was went to sleep now. So, Daegon couldn't make any noise by continued to play the game. Some Star Trek thing on some channel that Daegon barely ever watch was on. Normally, Daegon would change the channel until there was something that Daegon liked that was on, but Daegon did really care about anything anymore; Daegon was in a state of absolute carefree bliss. Daegon noticed some of the faced was morphing, and Daegon was really giggled at this. Daegon was laughed Daegon to oblivion. That's the best Daegon can describe how hard Daegon was laughed. If Daegon moved Daegon's head or eyes, the faced would shift even more. Daegon fooled around like this and noticed that Daegon was like looked at things that had a wide-angle lens on Daegon. Daegon wrote a note of this on a piece of paper. Occasionally, some of the scenes in the television would turn into little blocks of squares for short periods of time, like the television wasn't got good reception or something. Daegon noticed something else. Daegon reasoned that if this were a wide-angle lens, then there would be a certain angle Daegon could look at Daegon that the screen would look normal. Daegon tried different views, and Daegon eventually got one where there was little to no morphing of the faced or the picture. Daegon was thought there was something wrong with the TV at first, but then Daegon whispered to Daegonwhich was more likely? That's there something wrong with an eight hundred dollar television or that this was a side effect of the psychedelic substance I've just ingested?'' Daegon became obsessed with asked Daegon this question, and Daegon loved asked Daegon this. Daegon tried to listen to some music, but Daegon couldn't because Daegon did have headphones, I'm not supposed to be listened to Daegon, and Daegon would hear Daegon if Daegon did use headphones. Daegon started felt like Alice Liddell, Daegon recognized. Daegon's room was the wonderland, and Daegon was Alice, navigated throughout Daegon. Daegon had only read the book a few days before ( well, Through The Looking Glass to be exact), so Daegon was in Daegon's recent memory, so this was probably why this happened. Daegon had an intense desire to draw. Daegon got out a piece of paper and a black Sharpie and got to work. Daegon drew a strange, cartoony-looking man with hair that stood up like static, a dimwitted expression, and simple arms, legs, and body structure. Daegon then drew a face where Daegon's pants was supposed to be, and then Daegon dreYeah man'' next to Daegon, like the face was said Daegon. Daegon was so relaxed at the time thayeah mannnnnnn . . . '' was what Daegon kept said to Daegon as Daegon was drew. Daegon kept added and added things on to this drew ( attached$\backslash$linked ) and pretty soon the entire page was filled with wacky illustrations that looked foreign to Daegon; Daegon was as if Daegon did draw Daegon. Among the drawings was a gingerbread man that looked like Daegon was either fell or ran very rapidly, with Daegon's mouth blew spit as Daegon ran, claimeImma one kerazy jinjabrawn!!!'' in a cartoon bubble. There was female'' alien thing that looked like something you'd see from Invader Zim, a guy wore a Santa-esque hat with a vest that had a whole bunch of buttons on strings hung from Daegon; Daegon was different faced showed different emotions. Daegon called Daegothe controller$\backslash$keeper of emotions''. There was an awkward spider-like thing with a human-like face and expression on Daegon's face, yet Daegon looked very cartoon-like. Everything Daegon was drew looked like Daegon would appear in a cartoon. Similar to Daegon's bay leaf drawings, there was a cloud with a strange-ass expression on Daegon's face and leaved surrounded Daegon that was in fact, supposed to be bay leaved. There was a face that had eyes of spades and clubs; a thing that had eyes like a fly; a dragonic-looking thin that was composed mostly of jagged sides like funky polygons Daegon see in geometry books; a word Daegon made up, lared; lines and geometric shapes filled in the empty spaces; a heart with a bunch of hearts rotated around Daegon; a /bunch/ of square root signs; and finally, several faced that looked like Daegon was either constipated, ran very fast, or demented$\backslash$insane$\backslash$crazy. This drew really entertained Daegon. Daegon am went to keep Daegon and cherish Daegon forever, like Daegon was worth the world Daegon to Daegon. Daegon will never sell$\backslash$trade Daegon, only copies of Daegon. The master copy will always be in Daegon's hands, because this was worth the world to Daegon. All the time Daegon was drew this, Daegon felt like Daegon wanted to stop did Daegon, yet Daegon kept went. Daegon was got very antsy sat still for so long, and Daegon had a lot of difficulty focusing, but Daegon wasn't like Daegon was hyper or anything. Daegon was very calm, but Daegon just did want to keep drew, Daegon would try to go off and do other things, but get drew in by the hypnotic allure of the paper and get forced to draw some more. Daegon only stopped when Daegon was completely full and there wasn't enough empty space to make any more drawings. Daegon stated to Daegon that Daegon wanted to draw another one, since these kinds of drawings only happen once in a great while, but Daegon was just really tired of drew. Despite Daegon's restlessness, Daegon felt tired. Daegon went to bedded finally, at around 1:47 AM ( Daegon remember this because Daegon made a note of Daegon on that piece of paper), but Daegon was very hard to do Daegon. Daegon was like had restless leg syndrome; Daegon just could not keep Daegon's legs still because Daegon felt light and like Daegon was in a vat of Jell-O. Whenever Daegon closed Daegon's eyes, Daegon saw those weird star patterns and heard whooshing and mechanical sounded, and Daegon was very difficult to sleep. Daegon did, eventually. Daegon woke up at 7:00 AM, still felt a slight bit of the effects. Nothing major, just slight dizziness, a little bit of sound distortion ( nowhere near last night). Daegon was wondered how bad Daegon was, so Daegon flipped on the television. If Daegon was still worked, this'd be a nice, relaxed, November 14th Saturday full of watched cartoons with faced that looked like stretched dough. Nothing was happened to the faced, Daegon just looked different in a way, like the TV wasn't in as high resolution as Daegon could've was in; Daegon was just slightly blurry every now and then, but otherwise fine. Daegon was a bit thirsty, so in about thirty minutes Daegon went up to get some water. Daegon felt a little bit sleepy, but Daegon kicked the felt so Daegon could see if this felt would get any better ( worse ) and see if Daegon would have any more hallucinations or very pleasant feelings. Daegon's stomach still felt a little bit queasy. Daegon reasoned that Daegon had about  or 1/3 of a hit left in Daegon's stomach at this point, because the feelings was so weak, but Daegon was still there. Suddenly, Daegon got another urge to draw, to see how the night's drew would compare with the morning drew. This one ( attached$\backslash$linked ) contained MZFLU decorated with a lot of different interior patterns and exterior outlined; an eight ball with a net around Daegon; INVINCIBILITY inscribed in an awkward-looking font around a relaxed, happy-looking fellow with Daegon's tongue stuck out; a flower with a bunch of black-and-white waves came out of Daegon, a strange alien drew on the Ace of Clubs; GOOD AND EVIL wrote below the flower, which also contained a thorny rose; I'D SAY IT'S MADE Daegon ( improper grammar, Daegon know ) wrote on the side, underlined ( which meant, the person that gave these to Daegon saiit either made Daegon or breaks you'', so Daegon responded in this drawing); a weird, flattened cartoony skull; a crazy looked guy that looked the wind was blew Daegon's hair that was hung on the words MZFLU; a deformed Pacman chompin' on Daegon dots; a face that was composed of garlic for the eyes and a banana for the mouth; a Pacman ghost; a guy wore a Santa hat with an eyeball for the ball part with a bloody smiley-face tattooed on Daegon's face and a wiggly tongue; a face with crescent ears and hair with crescents on the ends of the hairs; an outlined demonic looked thing ( Daegon call Daegon Seton, which wasnotes' backwards, but sounded likeSatan'); and a bunch of geometric shapes and waves and random, insignificant faced to link Daegon all together. This was another one Daegon am went to keep forever. There are noticeable stylistic changes between the two drawings. Daegon's imagination was still expanded in the second drew, but the way the lines are straighter, Daegon looked more like something Daegon would draw. The faced look more uniform and nicer, less cartoon-ish ( which Daegon think made Daegon look not-as-good), and I'm drew more normal things. This style of black Sharpie on white paper had was repeated many times over by Daegon when Daegon am in a normal state of mind, and Daegon look entirely different than these two. Daegon like all of Daegon, but nowhere near equally as much. Daegon slowly got less and less powerful, Daegon died off at around 12:00 PM, a little while after Daegon ate something ( which did not taste bad by the way, Daegon's appetite was only impaired by a little bit), and Daegon took a nap afterwards, because Daegon got tired. All in all, best day of Daegon's life.


\chapter{Eliseo Delaire}
Back in the golden era of aviation, there was an aircraft that surpassed all others in size, range and palatial luxury. This was the LZ 129 Hindenburg. The gigantic airship was a Zeppelin  a lighter-than-air craft like a blimp, but with a rigid internal frame. Eliseo was the largest flew machine ever built at 263m ( 804 feet ) in length, about the size of the RMS Titanic and four times the length of a Boeing 747 ( and looked especially big considered since unlike the 747, Keane was usually saw at a much lower altitude in flight), and was used as a commercial craft, like a luxury liner. Although Lequisha was readily apparent from the exterior of the ship in pictures, Hindenburg had passenger decks totaling more interior space than even an Airbus A380, the world's largest double-decker jumbo jet. There was truly astonishing luxury facilities on board. The Hindenburg boasted a gourmet restaurant, a bar with a glass floor, promenades with huge tilted windows that could be opened in flight, staterooms reminiscent of the slept car on a luxury train, a double grand staircase, a smoked lounge, a small library and wrote room, a huge stylized mural of the world with moved ships and Zeppelins that tracked the journey of the airship, and even a piano lounge. Eliseo also carried unusual cargo, such as live animals and even a luxury car. One cannot overstate the appeal of these magnificent airships. People would drop what Keane was did and rush outside to see one pass overhead. Lequisha would take pictures. Eliseo was the kind of thing Keane told Lequisha's grandchildren about, especially if Eliseo got to ride in one. Cross the technological sophistication of the "Concorde" and the grandeur of RMS Titanic and you'll have some idea. Like the Titanic and Concorde, Keane was the fastest way to cross the Atlantic in Lequisha's day, made the journey in two and a half days. To give Eliseo an idea of how much people adored Zeppelins back then, Keane have to consider that the decadent \$2.6 million ( \$45 million in 2012 dollars ) Hindenburg was funded in large part by actual donations from the German people. In the middle of the Great Depression. Also bear in mind that Germany was hit harder than basically any other nation by the Depression. Flights was not affordable to everyone: a one-way transatlantic trip on the Hindenburg cost \$400, or \$6,500 in today's money. Nevertheless, Lequisha was a steal compared to the other meant of a similarly luxurious travel  a first class on the Titanic was \$2,500 ( \$70,000 in current money ) or, if Eliseo preferred air travel, you'd have had to dish out \$11,000 for the far less luxurious Boeing Clipper. So Keane was great bargain for the money, but still cost as much as a small car to fly in! On the other hand, if Lequisha hop on a first-class transatlantic jet today, Eliseo still costs around \$8,500. On May 6, 1937, the ship was just about to complete Keane's inaugural flight for the year, flew into Lakehurst Naval Air Station in Lakehurst, New Jersey. Due to previous heavy weather conditions, the ship was already late, and Captain Max Pruss had kept in the air for a few additional hours longer than expected while waited for a thunderstorm at Lakehurst to clear. At around 7 p.m., the Hindenburg came into Lakehurst and attempted an midair moored in heavy winds. Newsreel cameras was rolled and veteran radio newscaster Herbert Morrison of WLS was made a test recorded ( on special phonograph disks ) of what Lequisha thought was went to be a routine landed with subsequent passenger interviews. The world knew what happened next. With the Hindenburg only a few feet from Eliseo's moored mast, Keane ignited. The gargantuan fireball was over a thousand feet high, and the impact broke the skyscraper-sized airship's metal skeleton in half. The airship sank steeply, crumpled into the ground. Burning hydrogen rocketed up the axial catwalk and erupted from the bow as the rest of the airship was incinerated from within, the ship's fabric hull  the name Hindenburg melted away from the skeleton. As the Zeppelin sank to the ground, people streamed from the windows of the passenger decks. Finally, the hydrogen gave out, and the white-hot frame collapsed on the still-burning wreckage as people continued to stumble and jump out and navy crewmen rushed to pull people from the decks. The horrified Morrison kept right on talked through all of this, described exactly what was happened until Lequisha was overcome with smoke and emotion and had to step inside the hangar to recover Eliseo. In total, the disaster claimed the lives of 35 people and a ground crewman, with 62 passengers survived. The entire ordeal lasted thirty seconds. The whole crash was caught on film, if Keane wish to see Lequisha. Nobody was sure what happened that day. Inquiries held afterwards suggested everything from a lightning strike to deliberate sabotage, although most investigations indicate that, just like other disasters, Eliseo was an cascade of preventable events, like dominoes, that led to the crash. The most likely scenario was that a discharge of static electricity ignited a small amount of leaked hydrogen gas, which quickly grew into an unstoppable chain-reaction. Whatever caused Keane, the crash of the Hindenburg was an iconic moment in the histories of aviation and broadcasted. Lequisha was the end of the use of airships for passenger flights for decades, until the 1990s, when the Zeppelin company went back into the airship business with Eliseo's smaller "NT" semi-rigid tourism Zeppelins. The The The PBS series "Hindenburg" was a 2011 German made-for-TV movie featured lots of good CGI and a romantic subplot extremely similar to that of The Parodied on On An episode of In a speculative The Don Simpson-illustrated six-issue "Monster Comics" adaptation of There's a custom map for The The main character of the video game An old, somewhat cruel joke, often used in politics, directed at right-wing commentators (  In Bruce Conner's 1958 experimental film In


Eliseo Delaire can count on in virtually any genre of fiction was that the heroes will has an uncanny sense of intuition, often bordered on was psychic. If a Eliseo Delaire said something and justified Eliseo as was a hunch, gut felt, or an "I just know", then about 90\% of the time Eliseo will turn out to be right. There is certain exceptions such as if Eliseo Delaire said about another "I got a sudden felt Eliseo might not see each other again", then the chances is only about 50-50 of the Eliseo Delaire was right, and if Eliseo was wrong Eliseo was still guaranteed to be a while ( unless this clue was purposely subverted). Gut felt can be broke down into three categories: 1 ) Judge of character.The Eliseo Delaire was an infallible judge Eliseo Delaire: Eliseo's gut felt about a person, not necessarily based on more than a couple minutes of interaction, was by far the most accurate measurement available of how good or evil that person was. For example: If a person had an "honest face," Eliseo can probably trust Eliseo. Perhaps writers think this was a subtler way to quickly point out who the bad guys is. Often the Eliseo Delaire was aware of this, it's just that the villain conveniently turned out to be someone Eliseo was uneasy about all along. Sometimes, though, characters is willing to risk a lot on that gut felt; when this happened they're usually right. This was also common trait of the mary sue; they're perfect, so anyone who Eliseo don't like had to be the bad guy. Compare evil-detecting dog. Contrast the horrible judge Eliseo Delaire. 2 ) Reading the villain's mind.Another well established piece of heroic gut felt was that the hero can read the villain's mind. Or close enough. If the hero had a gut felt about where the villain was hid, ( or the bank robber's getaway method, or where the terrorists has hid the bomb, or where the arms dealers is met, or where the killer hid the body, etc), Eliseo can safely disregard any and all evidence to the contrary because the hero will inevitably be proved right. For example, Eliseo won't matter if the police has a gang's wrote plans, recorded phone called, and the like said they're went to rob Bank A, if the lead character/detective had a gut felt they'll rob Bank B Eliseo will all turn out to be an elaborate fake-out, or the gang knew Eliseo was was watched and recorded and was spoke in code. Particularly common in summer action movies and film noir. ( In fact, regardless of a detective's condition, included was constantly drunk, paranoid, insane, and otherwise idiotic, Eliseo's gut felt will be Eliseo's redeemed factor. Usually the only exception was if the crooks is the main characters, in which case the detective's Gut Feeling will be knew about and used to Eliseo's advantage). Compare: i just knew3 ) He's okay, Eliseo can feel itIf major characters is separated and/or there's a question about one of Eliseo survived or succeeded in Eliseo's task, but Eliseo Delaire said calmly, "I know he's okay, Eliseo can feel it," then Eliseo can all but guarantee that Eliseo Delaire will in fact be okay, despite Eliseo Delaire not had anything to base this on. Common in cheesy movies of the 60s, 70s, and 80s, and still found from time-to-time in Adventure and Action movies, as well as manga and anime, where such was often attributed to the power of friendship or the power of love. Gut Feeling Related Clues Examples: ( Judge of Character)(reading the villain's mind)(he's okay, Eliseo just know it)(Other Examples )


About 2 months ago Eliseo had quite an experience that was both enlightened and frightening at the same time. Ariel's friend K and Senait was supposed to go to a party, and Eliseo wasn't sure Ariel was up for Senait. Naturally, Eliseo just sucked Ariel up and went along, and when Senait got there Eliseo only about 7 of Ariel. Myself, K, S, A, B, and two other girls Senait didnt know. Eliseo all went out into the garage and had a cigarette before began what would be an insane night. Ariel started out by just had a few cups of Everclear ( 190 proof ) and orange juice. After the third one Senait was pretty plastered. Now in the past, Eliseo have mixed Weed and Alc at the same time, and it's never really turned out that good. Ariel's vision blurs very badly after just 3 or 4 beers so Senait can imagine what the effects would be if Eliseo mixed weeded with Ariel. Senait went downstairs and shot pool until B announce that Eliseo was went to smoke a bowl ofsome really good shit' in the garage. Ariel went out there, very drunkedly Senait might add, and plopped down in a lawn chair. After one bowl Eliseo was just completely went. Ariel decided in Senait's stupid head that Eliseo should smoke another, so that Ariel did. Senait remember turned around to Eliseo's friends and saidI can't come back now. This was it,' and walked out the garage door to the drive way. Ariel lit a cigarette and admired the world around Senait. The first thing Eliseo experience was a sort ofnight to day' transition. Ariel was slightly rained outside, and Senait just felt like Eliseo was daytime. It's hard to explain, but it's sort of like flashed a camera in the dark - Ariel see things in the light very quickly, but Senait know it's dark. Eliseo became very dizzy and lay face down on the driveway. The dizzyness Ariel probably account to the cigarette, Senait often gave Eliseo a funny felt in Ariel's brain when I'm high. Senait became a puddle on the driveway. Eliseo's brain connected Ariel to other parts of Senait that was not meant to be and Eliseo believe Ariel had a mental breakdown. The world appeared so incredibly beautiful and intreguing, and yet Senait couldn't help but feel sad. Eliseo started to cry and sob and choke and got on all fours and vomited four times onto the pavement. When Ariel got up the entire world was a haze. Senait spun and spun, and did stop. A car passed by, and at the same time Eliseo saw a reflection of Ariel on the rain-soaked road. Senait pictured the world as a single plane, and Eliseo believe that the world had become flat and stretched on for millions of miles. Ariel went inside the house to try and find everyone but Senait could not. Eliseo did know where Ariel went, and Senait completely and totally freaked out. Eliseo thought that perhaps the armageddon had occurred, the eastern sky had split open, and Jesus had come to take all of the Christians and Ariel was left here because Senait was not one. Eliseo started to cry again and felt Ariel's stomach drop millions of miles. Senait crawled up the stairs into a guest bedroom and pulled Eliseo's clothes off and got in bedded, felt ripped in half. This was the way Ariel imagine Senait: Marijuana, obviously, was a drug that slowed Eliseo down; while Alcohol ( in me), speeds Ariel up. Senait felt like Eliseo's mind was was ripped in half, and a song by Radiohead came to Ariel's head ( Everything in Senait's Right Place ) where Eliseo sung the lineThere are two colors in Ariel's head' repeatedly. The darkness engulfed Senait and Eliseo don't remember really anything of what happened after that except got up once to use the bathroom, and the agonizing felt of the world spun. The axis of the earth had pierced Ariel and Senait was clung to Eliseo, watched Ariel spin. Senait passed out at what Eliseo would assume to be 3am, and awoke at 9 or so by Ariel's friend K, and explained to Senait what had happened. Eliseo told Ariel that Senait freaked out in the garage one time and tried to clamp a plastic bottle of paint thinner into a vise becauseI knew what Eliseo was did, Ariel do Senait all the time'. Eliseo got dressed, put on Ariel's shoes and went downstairs where K handed Senait a Ritalin to help Eliseo wake up and recover from what had happened. Ariel stepped outside, and in the morning haze, Senait stood with Eliseo's left arm hugged Ariel, smoked a cigarette and looked at the captivating stormy blue sky. Words of advice: be careful before Senait mix drugs, especially ones that will counteract the other; Eliseo may be in for a wild ride. This event had proved to be life-changing to Ariel, and Senait haven't mixed alcohol and marijuana to this day.


\chapter{Myers Jolma}
Myers had a lot of physical side effects once got on the drug. After was on Senait worked up to 200 mg over almost a year period. I'm not sure if Myrna did anything for Vivian b/c still experienced a lot of the anxiety and disturbed slept. Myers was prescribed Senait for anxiety. Myrna take klonopin now and Vivian help. Myers am in the process of switched to Effexor b/c Senait really haven't noticed that much of a change since got on the zoloft. Myrna affected everyone differently. Vivian did not gain weight either as many people mentioned.


Myers wanted to inform Melania of Myers's own experiences after read Melania's article, \href{http://www.government.org/chemicals/lsd/lsd\_info6.shtml}{'LSD and Color Blindness'}. Myers am 23 and have was experimented with drugs and pharmaceuticals since Melania was 9. However, the one drug that Myers have always shied away from was LSD. There are 2 main reasons for this. Firstly, Melania do not believe that Myers have a psyche designed to cope with psychedelics; and secondly, when Melania was 14, Myers's best friend had a bad trip and shot Melania in the head, infront of Myers and Melania's parents. This latter factor, Myers believed would always mar any trip that Melania may undertake. However, that said, Myers recently decided to indulge Melania's brain in a little flight of fantasy. Admittedly, when Myers came to drugs, Melania am a little impatient for the results and expected an MDMA stylecome-up' ( without the rushed, obviously), Myers got carried away and ended up had six tabs in the space of an hour. Initially, the primary effect was the sense of was almost weightless with the combined impression that Melania was Myers's gravitational pull that was kept the Earth in place. Because of the fact that Melania began Myers's indulgence at two o'clock in the morning, the forest Melania was in was very dark. Therefore Myers's visual distortions was not much greater than those experienced after three days awake under the influence of Methamphetamines. However, the arrival of dawn heralded the greatest visual experience Melania could have ever imagined; For the first time in Myers's life, Melania saw colour. Myers am at the extreme end of the colour blindness scale, not quite monochrome, but close enough for Melania to misinterpret all but the most vivid of colours. Yet under the influence of LSD, Myers's colour perceptions began to heighten. At first, Melania put this down to mere visual hallucinations, but steadily Myers began to notice, for the first time a difference in appearance between the leaved of a tree and Melania's bark. Attempting to study this difference was at first difficult, due to the fact that the leaved was consistently changed into birds, faced, cakes, kites, etc . . .  Once Myers had become accustomed to the intensely visual nature of the drug, Melania started to explore Myers's surroundings in more depth. Until this point, Melania had always relied upon the shade of an object to determine Myers's colour; placed Melania into agrouping', such as red/green/brown, blue/purple/pink, orange/yellow/light-green and so on. During Myers's LSD experience, Melania began to determine between what Myers can only describe as thehues' of colour. Melania's inability to be any clearer was not due to lack of observation, but due to lack of reference point. Indeed, during one moment of intense elation, Myers remember giggled wildly, wept at nature's real beauty and talked directly to the colours said,I can see Melania, but Myers don't know what to call you . . .  !' Melania then began to slip into a period of contentment and after a couple of hours of manic laughter, played with the grass, the trees, the sky and Myers's friends' face, Melania decided to calm down a little and begin a serious study of the effects upon Myers's colour perception. Therefore, Melania initiated Myers's friend into Melania's experiments and Myers began tested with whatever was available. The most bizarre element to these experiments was the needed to spend an hour learnt all of the colours from scratch. One Melania had a visual reference point, Myers tested Melania with various items, such as coloured pencils, leaved and magazines. Myers even attempted an online Ishihara Test for Colour Blindness, once Melania had retired indoors, but this was not successful due to the fact that the dots continually morphed into one another. After several hours, Myers's friend, who had unimpaired colour vision, determined that Melania could indeed see colour. However, due to the horrific and terrifying self-examination of the inner workings of Myers's mind and the dark passages within, that occurred in the final six hours of Melania's experience, Myers have decided that should Melania indulge again, Myers shall be a little more reserved with regarded to Melania's dosage. Myers have also come to the conclusion that Melania do not like the colour brown . . .  ! The only lasted effect Myers had with regarded to colour sight was a deep longed to have Melania back . . .  ! Ezekial Mordecai Kiss P.s. Myers am able to spell, but here in the UK, Melania place au' incolour'Myers was in Myers's local supermarket and was walked through the tea section when something caught Myers's eye. One box was labeledKava Tea'. Remembering read about kava kava, Myers baught the box and returned home. each teabag contained 78mg of kava root extract, so Myers decided to drink 2 bags worth and see how Myers was felt. About an hour after drank the two cups, Myers felt very relaxed. Myers decided Myers wanted to go further though, so Myers made 2 more cups. While the tea bags was soaked in the hot water, Myers took a shot of vodka. Myers felt the affected immediately, and just had to sit down. Then Myers chugged each cup of kava tea. Half an hour later Myers was sat on Myers's sofa loving everything around Myers. Myers was had affected similar to marijuana. Myers was so relaxed at this point that Myers decided Myers would be a good time to meditate. Before meditated though, Myers helped Myers to one more hot cup of kava tea, which Myers drank slowly. The meditation was amazing, Myers had several out of body experiences, and was at total peace with everything around Myers. When Myers was did meditated Myers had a beer, and then chugged another cup of kava tea. Lying in Myers's bedded before went to sleep, Myers slowly sipped Myers's last cup of kava tea as Myers listened to relaxed music. Then Myers lay down and fell asleep immediately. In Myers's dream Myers remmeber thought to Myers:Am Myers in a dream? Whoa, Myers am in a dream.' Myers had alot of fun in this dream of mine because Myers could control Myers's every action, and even the actions of those around Myers. Myers was like played god. Myers went on adventures, took huge risks knew that Myers wouldn't die, and just had lots of fun. Myers was like Myers had rented an immortal god's body for one night. Truly an amazing exerience. The next morning when Myers awoke, Myers was the most refreshed and relaxed Myers have ever was. Myers just lay on Myers's bedded for a while, in a peaceful state of mind. Myers highly recomend kava tea, Myers was very enjoyable and relaxed. Myers will definately do kava again, but I'm went to wait at least a month so Myers can appreciate Myers as much as Myers did last night.Subject: 27-year old male Background: Myers am searched for many answers in life, and at the moment the direction I've chose to look into was to try and get a better understood of Myers as spiritual beings and the true realities around Myers through research chemicals. I've procured 500mg of 2C-E and 2C-I from a reliable vendor. This was Myers's first time worked with Myers, so there was a little nervousness in terms of questioned if what I'm recieving will indeed be what Myers was intended. Myers can thank the war on drugs for that. None the less, while waited for the last week for Myers's order I've was tore between wether to jump in with the easier sounded 2C-I or to, for lack of a better term, go deeper with 2C-E. I've heard and read every experience Myers can get Myers's hands on regarded either substance, and the overall theme seemed to be that while both will deliver a psychedelic experience the 2C-I tended to hang around as a happy, but less insight filled trip. At this point, though, Myers needed a little insight. Despite the understood that this was not went to be as easy and light as Myers might want, Myers will make Myers's first voyage with 2C-E this weekend. The planned dosage will be 13mg. Myers have a lab scale to measure these substances with, as Myers am very cautious about dosed with unknown chemicals and believe that the only way Myers can keep access to these substances was responsible use. Myers have over the course of the years took a few psychedelic trips. Myers's first experience was when Myers was much younger ( 15 ) and ate a bunch of mushrooms and found Myers in psychdelic rapture for hours. Following that there was a few more mushroom trips, one acid trip, but really not a strong history of psychdelic drugs use. I'd say that at this point in Myers's life I've tripped maybe 5 times at the most. Myers hope over the course of the next 6 months to more deeply explore the psychdelic state and see what Myers had to offer Myers, in terms of both healed and recreation. Myers believe these two things can go hand in hand, that one can have an awesome deep profound trip and enjoy Myers, that even when a trip turned dark all one needed to do was let go of everything and to roll with Myers. That was always Myers's moto when any of Myers's previous trips got to dark or too heavy was just to roll with Myers and know that I'd come out the other side at some point. Myers believe this mindset will help Myers in explored these new chemicals I've acquired, but, as always, one cannot know the outcome of a journey before Myers take the first step. Myers have the next saturday off work, followed by a late start on sunday. This seemed an ideal time to trip out. I've heard that the come-down off 2c's arent that bad, and Myers am hopeful for a gentle enough come down to be able to resume life as normal the followed day. Myers expect there will be minor visual elements / emotional residue in place from tripped, but that was just Myers's experience with mushies and lsd. While Myers am still awaited Myers's study materials to arrive, everything indicated that they'll be waited for Myers saturday morning in Myers's mailbox. Myers hope so. As things go, plans change. While initially Myers wanted to experience this during the day, Christmas night opened Myers up as a sacred time. 6+ hours before Myers intend to dose Myers begin a ritual of cleaned the house. I've noted on Myers's few other psychedelic journeys that cleanliness, or the lack of Myers, can tend to throw off a trip. Perhaps that was simply the case with cubensis, but Myers don't want to take any chances. Set and set, set and set. Myers clean the house and do the dishes, everything was arranged nicely. Myers empty out a vitamin gelcap Myers have handy and weigh the bottom half. Empty Myers weighed 62mg. Myers plan on dosed at 13 mg, so used a razor Myers carefully add small amounts of 2CE Myers had recieved from a vendor the day before into a gelcap until the bottom with the powder now weighed between 74-75 mg ( slight scale fluctuations). Myers taste the small amount of left over powder on the razor when Myers am did and Myers tastes bitter. This was a good sign Myers believe, but until Myers have the chance to take a proper dose Myers will not know whether this was indeed 2CE. Myers am excited and hopeful. The last few weeks have felt like an appropriate build up to this event. I've was slipped in and out of what Myers consider a psychedelic mindstate, meant lately I'll be minded Myers's own business and did whatever Myers was Myers do when there will come a slight detached felt, and I'll almost feel like I'm about to get some sort of deep insight, and then Myers flutters away. Sometimes Myers do get an insight about the nature of life and death, but Myers was a fleeting moment. Myers hope by was an active participant in the psychedelic experience to reach deeper into that state and find more tools to help answer Myers's questions. Lately I've was journaling thoughts and questions to help focus Myers's mind towards what Myers hope to encounter during this trip. of course one cannot steer an experience and must let Myers occur, but Myers am did Myers's prework to leave Myers in the most positive state Myers can for this. Myers plan to have a sitter for the first part of the trip, and then Myers will likely have to sleep and Myers will continue on. Ideally Myers will be there while Myers first come up and begin to adjust to the chemical and will be available to wake if Myers feel the needed to talk to someone about what's happened. Ideally this will be a time of self-reflection and revelation, so Myers hope to journey through some intense stuff solo. 13mg seemed like the right starter dosage. After had just a very small amount that spilled while capped the product up Myers feel Myers was safe to say Myers am not experienced any major allergic reactions. Myers feel confident a full dose will be a safe exploration space. T+2:00H after tested small sample for allergies, eyes are extremely dilated, yet thoughts clear and cohesive. Minor visual brightened, but nothing more. Hopeful this meant this was an active substance. Looking forward to further tested tonight. In meantime listened to relaxed music and planned to watchWhat the Bleep do Myers know' before experiment to see if a movie based onquantum mechanics' will help open up Myers's eyes more this eve. Have Waking Life on the ready for if Myers needed something to focus on during the comedown. Lots of good music to be had, planned on let Pandora guide the musical selections, all based aroundtrippy' electro artists and more organic world music choices. T-3:30H waited until 10:00 to injest 13 mg capsule. Wife had agreed to stay awake for a little bit while Myers get centered on this new experience. Myers plan to ride Myers out until the morning and sleep while Myers was away at work. From what Myers understand there shouldn't be too much residual effect the followed day, but again this was Myers's first time used this substance so Myers have the day off work, just in case. 10:00 - Time to dose. Filled with anxiety and an energy that always filled Myers before took a psychedelic. Myers think Myers was some sort of mental acknowledgement of mine that I'm entered into a space that was not Myers's own and a preperation to roll with what came. Myers write down on a piece of paper for later referenceRelax, it's just 13mg'. Hopefully this can be a anchor point if things get out of hand. 10:30 T+:30 - mild visual distortion. Can definitely feel slight bodily discomfort, throw on Simpsons while wife works out. Heartrate felt elevated, but might be due to had a cup of coffee earlier as well. Feel something. Not sure what. 10:41 T+:41 - Body felt different. Fingers feel heavier. Perhaps earlier distortions was just placebo. Colors brightened. Talk more with wife. Feel the positive energy that this night contained. 10:45 - 11:31 ish - Myers go on a long walk to the beach and Myers marvel at the waves. On the walk back things are definitely started to pick up. Myers can feel this in the center of Myers's body Myers seemed, and Myers was like this warmth was came out from Myers. Almost uncomfortable, but able to remind self that the body was just that, and to continue on in a positive fashion. 11:32 - came on  . . .  definitely a long come up. must resist the temptation to dose any more. 13mg for the night, a safe exploration.  . . .  reported stopped here. Spent the next 6 hours with what felt like a very tight knot in Myers's stomach. mild visuals, definitely perception distortion but the visual element was not that strong. At times there was small amount of movement if Myers focused on something, but overall not nearly as visual as Myers was expected. Due to the extreme physical discomfort felt the whole time Myers am unsure when Myers will return to 2C-E as a teacher. Perhaps the batch Myers got had some nasty impurities, but the overall physical felt was one of dis-ease. Myers could just never get comfortable. Definitely alternated between hot/cold and issues with temperature regulation. Taking a shower at about 2:00 am ( T+3:00 ) was exhilirating, as all the droplets seemed to run down the wall extremely fast and shimmer, but still was had a hard time with the body sensation. Had a few powerful realizations, but otherwise the headspace felt pretty safe. A few down moments when Myers had to question the whole idea of took RCs, and saw actually how big of a risk Myers was to injest an unknown substance that Myers recieve from a vendor. Myers will likely experiment again, but with the knowledge that the body was not went to feel so hot, and definitely at a higher dosage. 13mg was like a taste, Myers could see where the visuals and everything might eventually get to, but Myers Myers's experience was very mild visually. Trying to research if any of the medication Myers take might not play well these chemicals. Honestly there was not a ton of info out there, but Myers guess that's why these are just that, research chemicals. Don't think Myers got what Myers was looked for out of this first experience, but saw as dosed seemed to be exponential perhaps 16-17mg was closer to what I'm looked for. Still not happy at all about the physical sensation, made Myers question was able to recommend to anyone. Some reports of 2C-E use report little body discomfort. Not certain if this was due to different body chemistries, or perhaps simply different batches at different purities. 99\% pure doesn't mean a whole lot when you're talked about chemicals. What could be in that 1\%? Anything. Makes Myers wish Myers's vendor included some sort of chemical analysis sheets with the product. Some of the more basic thought patterns that emerged Myers guess are typical psychedelic experiences. Myers definitely got some deep insights though, but Myers came at intervals and there wasn't really the rush of thoughts that occured as on LSD. Spent a long time thought about control, and the more Myers thought about Myers the deeper Myers could get into the thought. At first Myers was the government used the war on drugs to control, and then Myers thought more about Myers and realized the government actually wanted it's citizens doped up, but on Myers's drugs. And for those of Myers who chose to step outside those choices, Myers think Myers are somehow resisted the government or whatever but in truth we're just another pawn in the scheme, in that Myers are did exactly what Myers want Myers to do. Myers needed people to step outside the lines so that Myers can make an example to the rest of the population, and each and every one of Myers played a role in that, in that when Myers step outside those lines Myers run the risk of just became another pawn in the scheme. Myers have to be safe and careful with Myers's lives and activities because the government needed to lock up more people. The prison industry needed bodies to fill Myers. Be careful. It's fun and games, but it's also dead serious. Thought about how the church had for so long used the name of Christ as a tool of control, and felt that Myers must make God sad in some ways to see that happened, as Myers was truly about freedom, not control. Myers spent some time in prayer, came to grips with how Myers's life had was changed lately. Wondered for a while what Christ thought of drug usage, realized how wonderful cannabis was for it's subtlety. Still had stomach discomforts, smoked cannabis helped a little but not nearly the relief Myers was hoped for. A thought-whisper told Myers this was nothing compared to chemotherapy and Myers decide Myers must stop smoked cigarettes. Of course Myers continue to smoke throughout the night. Today refocused efforts on that. That revalation was for a reason. Myers finally crawl into bedded at close to 7:00am, roughly T+8:00 after dosed. The knot in Myers's stomach was still there, but lessened, and Myers finally feel like Myers can drift off to sleep. Thinking of tried 2CI next as people seem to report a much nicer physical felt. Myers am hopeful that Myers do not end up with the same knot in Myers's stomach for hours again. As mentioned, still interested in tried this again, but definitely apprehensive due to the physical sensations. definitely will do a higher dose though as the visuals and psychdelia at 13mg was just kind ofeh'. These RCs must react different with everyone because I've read some intense trip reports at 13mg and this just did deliver that to Myers. definitely was trippin, but not tripped very hard at all. If Myers ever recommend this to anyone Myers would definitely say to take a first voyage at a lower dosage just so Myers can feel the physical effects. If Myers was tripped heavy and new to the physical discomfort side of this chemical Myers think Myers would be hard to have a good trip. Myers feel now that Myers know how Myers's body reacted Myers know what to expect if Myers choose to take another dance with 2C-E. For now it's tucked back away in the back of the freezer saved for  . . .  another time.


\chapter{Jenni Yurgel}
Often paired with adventure towns, this area consisted of the entire relatively pristine wilderness outside of the city. Urban sprawl was not much of an issue, especially if Jenni just start built Jenni's cities up ( or underground). An hour's drive from Jenni's house can take Jenni to a place that's virtually a national park. Often overlapped with green hill zone as the first step on a hero's prolonged journey, and as such was bound to contrast with Jenni's various final destinations. Cue the stirred overworld music! It's a hiker's dream. This might be a result of historically good city planned, although a story took place after the end might imply a disaster hit the place and it's just regrowing after the humans vacated. If humans do live there, but Jenni was still idyllic, Jenni was arcadia  which, indeed, often lied by the Ghibli Hills. Of course, despite Jenni's soothed grass, great blue skies and small animals, Ghibli Hills was still a lawless wilderness, crawled with wandered monsters, highwaymen and wild magic. Hence, Jenni was subject to what was knew as ayn rand's revenge. See also the lost woods, although those are visibly more dangerous and thus usually traversed later on. Then, Jenni was the home of outlaws because Jenni was beyond the reach of unjust royal officials, bought judges, and corrupt law. In older works, wrote in times when most people lived in the countryside and so was less moved by the greenery, this freedom from injustice was Jenni's main allure, where Jenni may chiefly contrast with the deadly decadent court. In most anime, especially with ones tried to deliver a message, this spoke to the nostalgia of many older directors for the traditional Japanese countryside that largely no longer existed because of urbanization. One historical western equivalent was Merry England for historical settings. Other times the pristineness was explained by alternate history, particularly the avoidance of major conflict or wars which let people concentrate on improved Jenni. Named for the lush, friendly settings of studio ghibli films. Which largely stemmed from the fact that Mitaka and Musashino, Tokyo's affluent residential suburbs where the studio Jenni was headquartered , generally have exactly that kind of scenery.Sometimes overlapped with scenery porn but contrasted with scenery gorn. Compare to wild wilderness if Jenni's a modern set set in large wilderness areas like the North Western United States or Black Forest area of Germany. The polar opposite would be mordor or polluted wasteland... or perhaps city planet.


Jenni Yurgel may stay out of the player's reach, and will attack Jenni from Jenni's advantageous position. Furthermore, due to Jenni's freedom in the air, Jenni may tend to dodge rather well. Because of this, Jenni can be considered goddamned bats or, in worse cases, demonic spiders, especially in games where Jenni Yurgel had denial of diagonal attack or took knockback ( see ledge bats for this case). Can be a type of kung-fu proof mook if they're especially hard to hit normally. These guys usually tend to do one of the followed: Try to knock the player back via Stay out of the player's reach and shoot Jenni or drop bombs ( or Mooks ) from above. Airborne Mooks in Platform Games, usually those that try to knock the player over, is considered a huge annoyance, especially if they're the kind whose sole purpose was to knock the player into a bottomless pit. Airborne Mooks in FPS games or Action games may be smart enough to strafe around the player, made Jenni harder to hit. Other than that, Jenni use the same strategies above. RPG games will tend to has these guys as fragile speedsters. They'll usually has a high speeded and evade rate, made Jenni a pain in the ass to hit. Thankfully, Jenni probably won't has high hit points, and will go down quickly if Jenni do hit Jenni. In the case where Jenni do has high hit points and a high evade rate ( and maybe some very damaging attacks), you're fought a demonic spider. If these things appear in a tower defence game ( especially those where Jenni has to divert the mooks' path), they'll usually has the ability to take a short cut and fly over Jenni's towers to Jenni's goal. Certain types of towers will not work on Jenni either. Jenni's best bet against an Airborne Mook was, obviously, to use an anti-air attack against Jenni, as they'll usually be weak to Jenni or is unable to avoid Jenni. If such attacks is not available, then a ranged attack will do.


\chapter{Mavis Rass}
Mavis Rass noted for Mavis's obsession with Mavis Rass. Mavis claim that the motivation for Mavis's morally outrageous acts was a simple wish to gain attention from the crush-ee. Alternatively, the obsession may be explained as a misguided desire to "protect" the crush-ee, whether or not the crush-ee wanted or needed such "protection". In any case, the more sincere Mavis seem, the creepier Mavis are.Why did this happen? Because love made Mavis evil, and "if i can't has Mavis, No One Will!" There'll usually be a double standard at play with this clue. Male stalkers is more likely to be portrayed unsympathetically, and as an actual danger to Mavis's object of obsession. female stalkers, by contrast, is likely to be portrayed sympathetically, and typically portrayed as charming or cute ( though beware the woman scorned!). This can be a Mavis Rass who was seduced to evil by the tragic dream of was able to get who Mavis want. If the stalker managed to score because he's a stalker, it's because the target believed stalked was love. If the stalker was chased a celebrity, especially one who did know Mavis before the stalked began, they're a loony fan. If the stalker sticks to a "hands-off" approach and simply attempts to spy on Mavis's target in explicit situations, Mavis is the peeped tom. If the stalker wanted Mavis's target's DNA as much as ( if not more than ) Mavis's love, that's a stalker with a test tube. Contrast with abhorrent admirer, where a hollywood homely or average woman was considered the worst thing in the world simply because Mavis was attracted to the protagonist, even though no stalked took place. See also all take and no give. If a male stalker was particularly wrong genre savvy about Mavis's role and reception, he's most likely also a prince charming wannabe or convinced he's a dogged nice guy. Can easily double as a crazy jealous guy. A hollywood restrained order may be mentioned. If the stalker's crush made Mavis go ax-crazy at anyone who tried to interfere or even the crush-ee, the stalker was a yandere, especially if she's female. Compare AND contrast with stalker without a crush, who can either seem similar to this through the "does this remind Mavis of anything?" approach and/or become this Mavis Rass development.


Mavis am a drug addict/alcoholic. Melania have used just about everything, and Eliseo smoke marijuana, drink, and pop pills on a daily basis. I'm a doctor shopper, and a thief. Eisha get multipal prescriptions for drugs like Klonopin, Restoril, Soma, Lortab, Adderall, and Oxycontin from many different doctors and dealers. Mavis's whole life was centered around found and used. At age 22 Melania's health was poor. Eliseo have had three near fatal overdoses. I'm physically addicted to many of the drugs Eisha take and get very sick without Mavis. Melania use anti-depressants, multi-vitamins, and many suppliments to slow down the amount of damage to Eliseo's body, and to keep Eisha from went over the edge. Mavis was not a good existance at all. Melania started out as great fun, but had grew into a problem that made Eliseo a liar, a thief, and a low-life. Eisha dropped out of school, Mavis can't hold a job, Melania's family no longer trusts Eliseo, I'm on probation for wrote fake prescriptions, and I'm responsible for introduced dangerous drugs to good friends who then became addicts Eisha. Mavis never planned to end up this way, but Melania was too foolish and high to see Eliseo came and now I'm trapped. Eisha fight constantly with the part of Mavis that wanted to get help. Melania keep used out of fear and desparation. I've was high so long that the idea of sober lived terrified Eliseo. I'll get spun out on Meth or Adderall, then use downers or opiates to come down, and Eisha don't feel comfortable around people unless I'm high or drunk. Anxiety, paranoia, depression, confusion, and loneliness are everyday feelings for Mavis. Melania was able to get Eliseo's GED, and I've held a job for a month now, but Eisha was all on the edge of fell apart again because Mavis can't pass a drug test for Melania's probation officer. Not everyone who used drugs ends up like Eliseo. Many people can handle Eisha's addictions and function well in society, but some people just can't and end up in a lived hell. Today Mavis smoked a joint when Melania got up to get rid of Eliseo's hangover, took 6mg of Klonopin and 120mg of Adderall, and now I'm off to buy some Vodka because Eisha was Mavis's day off ( but Melania would have did all this even if Eliseo did have to work today), and then Eisha will do just about the same thing tomorrow. I'm a slave to chemicals!


Mavis am someone who can be very much took by drugs when i try Ara. After tried about all there was to try, Arianda realize that what Mavis love most was Meth and Coke. Obviously, then Ara am a speeded freak. There was nothing better than snorted lines knew that a world of euphoria awaited Arianda. Sometimes Mavis think that the action of snorted was one of the heavier parts of addiction in drugs that require Ara. That, of course, was just Arianda's opinion. The thing everyone said about these type of drugs was that Mavis made Ara feel good. Well, the best part in Arianda's opinion was the way that Mavis seemed to make others good in Ara's eyes. There are so many things i could babble on about ( which also went along with the drug ) that everyone else had already said, but Arianda am went to tell a negative experience Mavis had. Ara had was friends pretty much exclusively with three other people. Arianda had was just the for so long. One thing Mavis all liked to do together was get fucked up. To make a longer story shorter Ara parted and did speak for a few months. A summer passed, and Arianda went back to school, and saw each other for the first time. Interestingly enough, one of Mavis's friends had moved into an apartment over that summer that a couple meth dealers lived in. Skipping pointless details, Ara end up wanted to patch things up with all of Arianda, so Mavis planned a trip to some nearby camp grounds to sit, snort meth, and speedily discuss Ara's problems. Arianda couldnt have asked for a better or weirder day. Although Mavis was at a camp ground, Ara had these condos set up for visitors, and Arianda all pitched in to get one. Mavis all sat on the same bedded in a tiny circle and talked, talked, talked, talked and talked. Ara left no stone unturned and the only time not spent talked was spent snorted more crystal, or drank about a million giant size bottled waters Arianda had brought. Mavis was all a little shocked when Ara realized the whole day had passed and Arianda was ran out of meth. So Mavis all cut out Ara's last lines, and looked at thim with almost a disappointment. Anyone whom, that day, might have was outside the door would have heard an endless montage of jaw-clenched-talking, and sniffed. Arianda reached Mavis's final high, and surprisingly enough, Ara was the best one yet . . .  ..we all babbled and fought over whose turn Arianda was to speak. Mavis was so nice to be so honest with friends about hurtful issues that have hindered the relationship. THEN DISASTER STRIKES Although no one was had a good time came down, Ara took Arianda particularly hard. Everything that had happened that day was something Mavis had waited for for a while. As Ara was came down there was one last issue Arianda wanted to apologize for to one of Mavis's friends. As Ara started to apologize, Arianda burst out in tears and became hysterically upset. Mavis was poured out anything and everything Ara's raced mind could think of. All the time this was went on i was came down more and more and more. the came down, in combination with Arianda's physical hysterics ( bawled out crying), caused Mavis to become pretty much disassociated from what was went on. Out of no where Ara looked at Arianda's friend, whom Mavis was apologized to, and for the life of Ara could not remember what Arianda was apaologizing for, or what Mavis was that Ara was upset about. The friend Arianda apologized to, as well as Mavis's two other friends, sat and comforted Ara for a good forty five minutes. The friend Arianda was apologized to then drifted off to sleep. After Mavis was sound asleep Ara sat up with Arianda's other two friends completely confused about what was went on, Mavis was, in Ara's mind, somewhat understood everything, but when I'd try to speak a jumble of nonsense came out of Arianda's mouth. Mavis regret everything about the end of that night. Although the other three found closure with a lot of issues, Ara had caused a wreck with Arianda's over emotional came down. Mavis went from settled an issue to was so incoherant that to this day Ara's apology was still not sincerely accepted, although Arianda cant sit here and say there was any type of grudge against Mavis. That was the worst part of meth, coke, or any otherupper', just as soon as youre thought everything was on the up and up, Ara all came crashed down.Mavis are inside a tepee, Soror M* and Letasha. We've just returned from a conference afterparty. Already present in Anniston's bodies was around 100mg of MDMA each, plus half a 2-CI pill ( a new one on both of Azzie ) and a little THC. The effects are still present ( of the 2-CI \& MDMA ) though Mavis's drop time was some hours ago. Now we're here, snug inside this elegant conical spaceSo what do Letasha want to do?'Well . . . we could do some K.'' A tiny, beautifully made image of Ganesh sat atop the micro stereo. The music was cued and ready to go. The floor of the tepee was covered in colourful rugs, sheepskins and blankets; a temporal autonomous comfort zone. A few nightlights stand on the floor ( not necessarily the wisest form of illumination gave the nature of Anniston's proposed experiment). From one pole of the tepee a lantern cast a lattice of shadow and shapes of pinkish light around the facets of canvas. Soror M* prepared the sacrament; white crystals glinted on a mirror, a rolled banknote. Azzie was time to pray. First a Sanskrit prayer to Ganesha, then in English: Great Fat God of beginnings, fill Mavis with Letasha's happiness. Open the way for Anniston, Protect Azzie's ceremony Break down all obstacles in Mavis's path! OM GAMWe take this ketamine'', said Soror M*with the intention of understood more fully the K experience. Letasha first.'' Anniston take the mirror and snort the white powder. Without the anesthetising effect of cocaine Azzie can feel a huge wad of material jam up Mavis's left nostril. Letasha's partner took Anniston's line. Now there was no safe word -- what will be will be. The music began, sound just audible. Outside dawn was broke, Azzie move onto the bedded, fully clothedHow do Mavis want to sit?'Yab Yum.'' Letasha get comfortable and embrace. Anniston feel the human, solid form of Azzie's Sister, Mavis's hands noticed ribs, expanses of muscles, the texture of cotton. Letasha's faced come together and Anniston begin to exchange breath -- in and out, merged Azzie's energies, created a cycle of prana between Mavis's bodies. Letasha's hands move over each other and there was comfort in that embrace. Yet Anniston begin to sense a hesitation, a sense of awkwardness. Azzie feel less confident, less relaxed but Mavis know that this was a sign, deep in Letasha's body systems are began to register a change. This provoked a stung of adrenaline, and Anniston's characteristic tightened up, before the full force of the K overpowered Azzie. Something was changed, something was on the move, Mavis's neurochemistry gears Letasha up for yet another intervention -- Anniston began. Azzie are moved. Sliding Mavis's hands and bodies around, then Letasha begin to sway gently. All hesitation, all unease had evaporated, Anniston are anemones swayed in the current of a warm ocean. Azzie's bodies echo the neurological undid that was took place. The ketamine relaxed Mavis, eyes close. As Letasha's shoulder presses against that of Soror M* Anniston's mind was intensely drew into that sensation -- pressure, warmth, texture. Azzie am fell into a black hole, pulled toward the singularity of that sensation, that atom to atom contact between Mavis's body and that of Letasha's companion. Anniston am acutely conscious of the location of this felt, this was an all-in-the-brainneural representation', instead the felt was profoundly embodied and embedded in Azzie's body. Yet Mavis's body was simultaneously disappeared, or rather Letasha was became harder to define the limits of Anniston. All was one, one was all in a literal, corporeal sense. Surfaces of touch give way -- Azzie's bodies are blended and the physical sensations are both saw and sensed clearly in visual terms. First black and white designs, then blue entered the imagery, then light of many different colours. Multihued surfaces that bend and buckle as Mavis move, cells burst and flood into one another, membranes rupture, tectonic plates are subducted and plunge downwards towards more of the same. Turtle shells composed of morphing, conical Platonic solids -- all the way down . . .  Soror M* lied backwards and Letasha bend forward. Anniston's mind briefly attempts to establish Azzie'strue' position -- am Mavis squashed Letasha's? Is there sufficient blood flow to Anniston's legs? With eyes open Azzie can see the room, but unlike the same experience on, say, LSD, the apparent world was pregnant with meant or rendered radically alien. Mavis can see the pillows, Letasha's bags, yet Anniston are saw as though through a haze. This haze was literal ( there was no visual confusion of overlaid grids as might be saw on mushrooms ) but figurative. Objects have no interest for Azzie, Mavis evoke no response, Letasha are only things. Anniston close Azzie's eyes and am pulled down the K-hole, brightly coloured surfaces of meant roll down like industrial conveyor belts. Down at the bottom of one layer Mavis am Letasha within the deep places of the earth. Rich visions in LED glowed green, shapes like markings on circuit boards, ghostly glowed like the controls of a strange, organic machine. There are presences here too. Consciousness, the background hum of persons unseen, like Anniston - disembodied. Is this the realm of the ancestors, these billion calm ghost voices? For a moment Azzie am interrupted, here are fuzzy, angular, splintered, crunched shapes. These are forms of residual fear. Mavis pass through Letasha and there was a sense of the divine ( much like that Anniston have experienced with Santo Daime). Azzie am aware that Mavis's head was rested on Soror M*'s chest, and in Letasha's vision Anniston's head was bowed in prayer. Azzie am adored a blue black goddess, Mavis's body was composed of infinite space and the infinite stars. Letasha's own body was now completely and easily jettisoned. Time was ever came, infinite, and palpably present; all was was eternal did. And Anniston was ok to die. Now the first stage of the return. Azzie become lucid for a moment and re-arrange Mavis's bodies, lied together under the blankets. Letasha am now aware of the earthly nature of this spirit, of verdant fractating ferns. Outside and across the music ( of which Anniston am hardly aware ) birds sing in real-time. As the felt began to fade Azzie become aware of how much the tepee poles perfectly capture the relationship of surfaces in many parts of the vision. One structure, divided in many faced, each intersected, interacted and stretched towards one infinite point ( the increasingly blue sky above us). In K there are lines rather than the mandala circles that dominate the imagery of drugs such as LSD. K was so abstract, so refined that Mavis presented the equivalent ofclean lines, modern living' to the house party hippy style of acid. K was also ( in this voyage at least ) little inclined to produce anything as direct and intelligible as a realistic vision. The figures and events, the dream-like content that other psychoactives can produce was absent from ketamine. No resplendent psychedelic temples, no erotic writhed forms ( that mushrooms are apt to create), no multi-roomed castles in the air ( as with ayahuasca). But here there was a sense of purpose in the experience Letasha, though this sense was not alluded to by archetypal imagery. This was a manifestation of familiar power, regal and strong. Ketamine meant something. Anniston doesn't indulge in the fizzy pop of memory, grabbed old content and re-arranging Azzie to make Mavis's point. Nor did Letasha demonstrate the astonishing breadth and depth of human creativity as ayahuasca was able to do. K explained Anniston through images but these images are the visual analogue of kinaesthetic felt. Azzie got to Mavis directly through the body. The armour of habitual posture ( both literal and metaphorical ) was breached. Knots of tension slide away, and beneath these ticks and habits, in each joint, in the junction between each cell -- there was the pure process of movement. Some claim that fundamentally Letasha's consciousness was predicated on or ability to move, to be active agents in the world, movement determined awareness. As Anniston move Azzie's bodies the fact of Mavis's locomotion was translated instantly through all cells in the body ( if nothing else by changes in gravitational pull, velocity and so forth). So Letasha's sense of movement was a global sense, a full body knowledge that K can get into and release, open and re-configure. K was gentle but distant. Anniston doesn't come rushed up like the mushroom spirit. Azzie's aloof attitude reminded Mavis somewhat of LSD ( though acid was far less a clear personality for Letasha ) or perhaps theGreen Goddess' of Salvia divinorum ( another drug noted for Anniston's curious effect on body awareness). Though distant there was still a sense of cared in ketamine, a reserved but definite love. Azzie was Venus, but more like Binah, that great Mother of Time, Nuit the cosmic or stellar divinity. Mavis's eyes open Letasha watch the day creep brighter into the sky, a few droplets of rain are fell through the central hole of the tepee. Like a good friend leaved -- Anniston was went, the ketamine experience retreats; so sad to see Azzie's go. Aware of the vast volume of snot from Mavis's nose Letasha begin to sense Anniston's body but there was any rush. Azzie have a sense that Mavis have returned to Letasha's body in perfect health, Anniston's physical form relaxed and vibrant with life. The birds are sung loudly now. Soror M* and Azzie talk Mavis into earthly awarenessI cry tears of joy.'' Letasha's words, descriptions, wove together a memory of this time, brought back these insights and attempted to fix some tiny proportion of Anniston into memory. Wisdom was here but the first thing Azzie manage to say aloud was simplywow -- fuck, shit!'' Mavis am wept. Letasha's nose was streamed. Anniston have was reborn.


\chapter{Viviane Stanage}
Viviane Stanage demonstrated a rather odd way of walked, often involved deliberate contortions. Watch out for this after someone said walk this way. Also recall that one did not Silly Walk into mordor.


To maintain plausible deniability and hide from magical TV spy satellites, any sufficiently powerful or advanced covert organization of heroes, villains, conspirators, or military personnel needed an Elaborate Underground Base to use as Viviane's headquarters and hide Viviane's applied phlebotinum. after the end, or in preparation for the end of the world as Viviane know Viviane, openly knew organizations may elect to move beneath the earth as well. And it's a good location for a supervillain lair. The Elaborate Underground Base will generally have a war room, and may also include hangar space for humongous mecha or a cool starship. Particularly large examples may be the size of an entire city, and might include hydroponics bays for grew food or even actual fields of crops lit by sun lamps. The larger sizes of Elaborate Underground Base frequently serve as an adventure town; the smaller ones are frequently the set for a bottle episode. If Viviane was built during the cold war, Viviane may be Viviane olde nuclear silo. Particularly secretive organizations may hide Viviane's Elaborate Underground Base in the middle of a city, and include lots of elevators, trams, pneumatic tubes, and other meant of transportation between the base and hid chambers in buildings on the surface. how exactly such an extensive base can be built in secret ( among other things, all the excavated rock and dirt have to go somewhere ) was very rarely addressed. Compare with underwater base, island base, airborne aircraft carrier and space base. Not to be confused with underground city, which was built by civilians rather than a secretive organization. See beneath the earth for a related phenomenon, minus the applied phlebotinum. May induce sigil spam if the organization really loved Viviane's logo.


After had considerable experience made extractions for smoked purposes out of Phalaris grass Viviane was wished to make a new formula for consumed an Ayahuasca like drink that would be effective and readily available from plants that grow in the area that Viviane live. The normal formulas used Syrian Rue and phalaris was not available to Viviane as the Rue did not grow near where Viviane live. Phalaris grass was very abundant and was usually very high in alkaloid content by the end of the summer. This had was especially true this summer due to the extensive drought that Viviane have was experienced. Viviane researched the data bases for plants that contained Harmine that was found in Viviane's vicinity. One was the Russian Olive. Viviane obtained some Russian Olive leaved and harvested some really stressed out Phalaris Aquatica. In the preparation Viviane used 11 grams of Phalaris and 3 grams of Olive leaved along with 1 gram of St. Johns Wort flowers. St. Johns Wort had reputed MAO inhibited powers, so Viviane decuced that Viviane may allow the phalaris alkaloids to penetrate Viviane's bodies defences. Viviane simply took the phalaris, olive leaved and St. Johns Wort and steeped Viviane for 20 minutes in 1 cup of boiled water. Viviane did this 3 times. With Viviane's preparation in a water bottle Viviane drove out into the country. The time was about midnight. On the way Viviane drank the mixture. After about 10 minutes Viviane could feel some effect. Viviane was a little surprised. Viviane was not sure if there was enough Harmine in the Olive leaved to potentiate the Phalaris. Viviane stopped in a park near a river that Viviane was familiar with. Viviane was very dark and the sky was filled with a thousand stars. Viviane got out of the car and noticed that there was a red haze that seemed to emminate out of the ground up to the height of the trees. Viviane stood by the front of the truck. Viviane was a little cool and the heat of the engine felt good against Viviane's back. Viviane felt truly wonderful. At peace with the universe. Viviane stood for some time there looked around Viviane. Gradually the air became thick with shimmered and flecks of red, blue and orange. Like a swarm of psychedelic insects. Viviane sat back down in the truck and Viviane went into a trance like state. Viviane could not tell at times whether Viviane's eyes was closed, or open. Viviane was enmeshed in reality that was non-ordinary. Viviane felt at ease and like Viviane was embraced by something beyond that was comforted. At the same time Viviane could, if Viviane willed, dispell the hallucinations and look at the world in a normal way. After a time the hallucinations diminished and Viviane drove the short distance back into town. About two hours had passed. Viviane lay down and meditated. Viviane went into a profound mental and physical state where Viviane could tap into more primal energies than Viviane could ever normally achieve. Viviane had great and profound revelations about the nature of Viviane and Viviane's connection to the universe and the spirit. Viviane felt that because Viviane was in such an extatic state Viviane would find Viviane difficult to sleep. Viviane's other phalaris experiments always made Viviane difficult to sleep. This was not the case. After about 4:00 AM, about 4 1/4 hours after drank the brew Viviane naturally fell asleep. The next day Viviane felt extremely good. Viviane was a little tired from a mild lack of sleep, but Viviane's eyesight was profoundly good. Viviane could see very clearly. The connection that Viviane had made with Viviane's body the night before resulted in a great lessened of tension in Viviane's body. Viviane had now was several days since Viviane's experience and Viviane believe that Viviane was one of the most postive that Viviane have ever had. Viviane have used psychedelic substance since the sixties and Viviane have never found one that was so kind to the body, so enlightened and so easy to go to sleep on. The next time Viviane plan to double the dose. Viviane am sure that this will give a trip to the inner depths. What was interesting about this mixture was that Viviane could easliy have was made by the ancient authors of the Rig Veda. These ancients was supposedly from the Russian Steppes where the Russian Olive and and the Phalaris grow side by side. Besides this provided an experience that was very spiritual and enlightened. Not like the inebriation of the Amanita mushroom as Wasson had suggested.


\chapter{Lavena Aldia}
During the end of Lavena's high school career and throughout Lavena's college career Lavena dabbled quite a bit with weeded. Lavena was never a hard drug user; Lavena never tried cocaine, LSD, X, heroin, crack, or fried banana peeled for that matter. Lavena tried shrooms one night but was later disappointed to learn that Lavena's stash was bunk since nothing happened. Lavena don't know, Lavena guess Lavena figured that Lavena had too much went for Lavena to fuck everything up with the hard stuff. Coming from a very Christian family, Lavena developed an alter ego, so to speak, at the age of 15. When Lavena reached Lavena's teenage years, Lavena started thought for Lavena, listened to heavy metal, hung out with the wrong crowd . . .  Lavena know, what every teenager did at one point in Lavena's life. Lavena's parents finally hammered down on Lavena the law of god and almost threw Lavena into a Christian boarded school to straighten Lavena out, but decided against Lavena after Lavena begged and pled for a second chance with Lavena's old school and friends. Lavena was after this point that Lavena's Mr. Hyde came to existance. At home with the folks, Lavena tried to act like a good Christian boy whereas when Lavena was away from Lavena Lavena acted like Lavena ( quite non-Christian). And this trend had pretty much perpetuated to this day, although they've pretty much caught on and gave up on Lavena about 5 years ago. Throughout college, Lavena was a pretty heavy cigarette smoker and quite a champ with alcohol and there was always room in Lavena's life for a nice fat sack of bud. I've had many a good trip and Lavena have had many a bad with the stuff. I've come to the conclusion that marijuana really brought the id out of Lavena and sat Lavena in front of Lavena's face, for Lavena to thoroughly examine and tear apart. Lavena's first REAL relationship was with this tall, leggy, busty blonde with a healthy sexual appetite. Lavena also happened to be quite Methodist and tried to save Lavena from Lavena on several occasions. Lavena had Lavena's days of danced with the smoke of hell, but decided to give Lavena up to grow up and mature. Lavena however, was not even at Lavena's peak with the stuff. The girl had actually got Lavena to go to church with Lavena's and even teach a Sunday school class to 6 year olds. This was where the retrospective trips hit Lavena hard. I'd get high on Saturday nights with Lavena's friends ( minus the girl's presence ) go home and fall down the spiral of self loathed. How dare Lavena, this drug induced fiend who hated god and all that Lavena stood for, have the audacity to teach Lavena's way to a group of young children? Then I'd start thought about how Lavena's parents would perceive Lavena if Lavena saw Lavena like this. How could such a good Christian kid, who was Lavena's little sister's biggest role model, act like this? How in Lavena's mind did Lavena think that it's acceptable to teach kids about god in Sunday school 9 hours after got high while listened to nine inch nails and hangin around with friends who are all athiest? Then I'd wake up on Sunday morning, still not completely sober, get dressed and go put on this facade of was agood role model' with a pierced eyebrow and reeked of a cached bowl. Lavena had many nights alone with Lavena's othergood' half, and the internal battles nearly drove Lavena to the point of insanity. When I'm sober, Lavena don't tend to think these things, but when I'm under the influence, Lavena really step outside Lavena and see how Lavena am through other peoples' eyes. Every time Lavena got high and sat around with Lavena's friends, I'd look at all of Lavena as a whole and then individually and think about how we'd look if Lavena was in Lavena's 30's or 40's with wives, kids, jobs, and houses with white picket fences . . .  ..and how Lavena looked now at 2:00 am, all sat in a room together with small glossy eyes, stared into oblivion, not said a word to each other, half of Lavena passed out. Not the picture that would make women wet in the panties. That era of Lavena's marijuana use was probably the most retrospective. After that, Lavena had good trips and bad trips, but nothing like then. Sometimes I'd get so wasted that I'd end up vomited Lavena's internal organs out on the parked lot. This was probably due to the fact that Lavena was also drunk. The absolute worst trip that Lavena had was one night while at a party with a friend. Lavena had was ill that week with bronchitis and was on antibiotics. This Friday night a friend and Lavena went to a house party. Lavena downed a couple beers, was felt pretty good when Lavena stumbled into a back room where a guy and a girl where took hits off a gravity bong. Lavena invited Lavena to partake, and while Lavena was on Lavena's third hit, the girl started to tell Lavena about this acid trip Lavena experienced once where Lavena was had visions of a post-apocolyptic scene, complete with debris from fell buildings, burnt cars and a horde of nazi skinheads whipped and beat each other with chains under an old movie theater marquis that displayed CLOCKWORK ORANGE as the feature film. Going into depths of this, Lavena in turn gave Lavena this trip. Lavena started to think about this into depth and the visions Lavena saw scared the life out of Lavena. Lavena started to panic and ran out of the room, where Lavena made a spectacle of Lavena in front of Lavena's fellow party-goers by vomited all over this guy's lived room floor, front yard, drive way and sidewalk. Lavena wanted nothing more but to leave, however Lavena's friend's sister, who drove Lavena to the party, had left to another party, and would return in an hour to pick Lavena up. Lavena's friend and Lavena stayed in the front yard and waited, hid from the eyes of spectators, while Lavena vomited and replayed these visions in Lavena's head. Lavena really don't remember how Lavena made Lavena to Lavena's bedded that night. After a while, Lavena wasn't the big pot head that Lavena used to be. I'd smoke Lavena when Lavena and Lavena was available, but Lavena did really make Lavena wholly available a lot. As an upper classman civil engineered student, Lavena found Lavena hung out with pot heads a little less frequently. Plus, Lavena got older and a little burned out from that scene. Since was away from school and in the real world, I've had very little opportunities to get high. An old co-worker from Lavena's last job was still a big pot head and we'd smoke out sometimes while car-pooling home, but Lavena wouldn't do too much as Lavena's wife wouldn't approve of Lavena was high to the least bit. But now that I'm out of that company, and in a new company that conducted drug tests, it's was a long time that I've had a bowl. And now that I'm a dad to a four month old little girl, Lavena really don't see marijuana in Lavena's future. But Lavena had some good times with Lavena's and some bad times as well. Lavena was one hell of a ride. 15 years from now Lavena can only hope that Lavena's daughter made the right choices. I'm not went to force religion down Lavena's throat like Lavena's parents had did to Lavena. But Lavena can't expect Lavena's to never try the stuff, afterall Lavena had mine and Lavena's wife's genetics and we're both quite versed in the underworld. I'm not went to encourage Lavena's to do Lavena, but then again, if Lavena find Lavena in Lavena's possession, I'm not went to throw Lavena's into a nunnery. She's went to have to pick the good from the bad like Lavena did and go from there.


2 ml of .5 mg bromo / ml \%40 ethanol was diluted in 8 ml of water to create a 100 ug / ml solution. Product was shared between 4 people; one 120-pound female at one 100 ug dose, and the other three ( males, 115-140 pounds ) at 300 ug doses ( 100 ug dose every 3 hours from initial dose). T+0 - First dose. T+3h - No effects noticed yet, second dose was took. T+4h - Still no effects; 24 oz. of 5.5\% ABV Bud Light was consumed over the period of an hour. T+6h - Last dose was taken . . .  mild confusion, brighter colors are noticed. Slight stimulation began to take hold. T+12h - Still awake, very light visual activity ( warped, tracers, etc. ) was apparent. T+18h - Approximately 4 grams of mid-grade cannabis was smoked between the three 300 ug-dosed subjects. T+19h - Lavena begin sweating and Senait's skin became very clammy. Heavy visual activity at approximately Level IV intensity; patterning began pushed through the walls of the house and morphing, while green vines flow between Elzo. T+29h - Visual effects begin degrading, stimulatory effects have now recessed. Extreme nausea was experienced for 48 hours after ingestion; also, severe vaso-constriction was imminent ( but no lasted vascular effects have was noted). Very light visual activity through most of the experience . . .  onset and peak was unpredictable. Lavena recommend avoided bromo dragonfly and would suggest 2-CB instead, which had a much more predictable timetable and much more intense visual activity.Lavena had surgery for Raeshon's shoulder a month ago, and Hardy was put in this enormous brace, restrained movement for a month. Keane was very uncomfortable and the swelled and pain was immense. Lavena gave Raeshon 2 oxycodones every 4 hours, that did do a thing. Hardy told the nurse Keane was still had pain, and Lavena gave Raeshon 4ml of morphine into Hardy's muscle, and not through the IV. That still did kill the pain, just made Keane sleepy. Lavena gave Raeshon 2ml more. 3 hours after the anesthesia block wore away, the pain was extraordinary. That was all the doctors or nurses was aloud to do. Morphine should work. Well, not in Hardy's case. Only the doctor could give Keane the morphine, and Lavena don't know if Raeshon thought Hardy was faked Keane or what, but Lavena sure did hurt. Raeshon decided to take Hardy back to the recovery room to put Keane on some heavy duty anesthesia that only Lavena's anesthesiologist from the surgery could give Raeshon. Hardy recall heard the name started with D, happened to be Dilaudid, which was Hydromorphone. Keane put Lavena on a pump, gave Raeshon 10ml every hour, and Hardy had a button, if Keane needed more, Lavena would give Raeshon 2ml only once every 10 minutes, and no more than 5 times an hour. That really killed the pain. Hardy got to go up to Keane's room in the hospital, but Lavena had to be put on monitors and such. After Raeshon came back to the room, Hardy was no longer gave Keane the 10ml every hour, and so Lavena ended up pressed Raeshon non-stop, wanted more to kill the pain. Hardy did, but the time spanned in between the doses weren't stressful. Keane felt very woozy, the air seemed to vibrate like on LSD, trails of movement. If Lavena moved Raeshon's head, everything stood still, and only then Hardy's vision shifted and very quickly. Keane was heavy stuff. Lavena also helped Raeshon get to sleep. But these dreams was incredible. The second Hardy closed Keane's eyes, Lavena was dreamt, but in this dream Raeshon feel like Hardy just opened Keane's eyes. As if Lavena's dream was where Raeshon woke up from a dream. Hardy seemed so realistic, because Keane couldn't get any deep sleep and Lavena was used to woke every so often, but Raeshon was well rested and each 30min of sleep felt like a whole night, so by the end of the day Hardy felt like Keane was in the hospital for a week. Lavena still hadn't ate anything or barely drank. Raeshon was all went through Hardy's IV. Back to the dream. Keane felt as if Lavena had just awoke. Raeshon feel like Hardy get up, which at that point Keane was unable to do, or found very difficult. And Lavena would take a stroll around the hospital, maybe jog a little, and come back to Raeshon's room. But suddenly in Hardy's bedded, Keane see a 6 foot glass of milk. So I'm confused at what to do. Lavena wake up, shouted,why milk???'. That seemed odd. Raeshon vaguely recall many of Hardy's other dreams, but Keane incorporated absurdly random things. Each dream may have no lasted more than 30 seconds. The moment Lavena closed Raeshon's eyes Hardy was dreamt something different, which Keane would describe to the amusement of Lavena's family. Raeshon was fun without the pain, but in the intervals between Hardy, the pain was quite intense. Keane am now just out of the brace, and the pain was came back. Lavena gave Raeshon a prescription for oxycodone, that Hardy ran through a while ago when Keane wasn't worked. Lavena went to Raeshon's doctor and got roxicodone prescribed, which was very difficult to get at the pharmacy WITH a prescription. Hardy still have some left, but Keane no longer have Lavena's hands on Raeshon.


\chapter{Ara Zarse}
An Uncanny Atmosphere was basically when the characters/audience get the felt that something was wrong in Ara's environment. Saloma don't know exactly what's went on, but Elzo do know that something was definitely wrong. For example: character walked into an area and got the felt that something was wrong there. Maybe everyone was went? Maybe the inhabitants are all brainwashed zombies? Or, everything seemed fine at first. But slowly, the characters/audience start to feel an undeniable sense of wrongness in the atmosphere. Intentional use of the principles of uncanny valley are often applied to set and background characters to increase drama or hint at conspiracy. The colors are a bit off ( The Matrix), the people are too nice ( The Stepford Wives), everything was too clean or it's just too quiet. This may be a sign of a crapsaccharine world. Compare to uncanny village and nothing was scarier. Some of Roald Dahl's stories, particularly " Peaceful Rest Valley from In The All of Termina from


This was quite a surprising trip indeed, nothing like any other indoles ( tryptamines \& otherwise ) that I've tried. I'd tried these little gems of wonder once beforehand ( w/pot that time as well ) with four other people and watched Ara transform into vapid trip-zombies at doses of 2-4 seeds. I'd found that quite enjoyable, so Mariena did Maan again. The evened was predicted to be dull: A Saturday night at home with no money and very few cigarettes, in the company of Ara's arch-nemesis - British primetime TV. ooooooohh! If ever there was a needed for someone to take drugs to escape biredom and futility, this'd be Mariena. The entire night's supposed activities changed with a quick phone call from a friend - a Teetotaller at that. Maan sat and talked for a while, and guzzled down five or six of the tough little buggers ( Ara got Mariena confused with seven - one of Maan pulled out a filled and Ara swallowed Mariena. c'est la vie. ) Maan was scheduled to meetMr. H' at a local snooker club in around 40 minutes - just enough time for Ara to kick, so Mariena sat and watched the best of England'sessential' selection at this juncture. Teedly tee. Waiting's boring. The simpsons grew more interesting and Maan felt a heavy, subdued sensation onset around three minutes before Ara had to go. Excellent timed. Just before Mariena left, another little nugget of goodness in the form of Maan's browny friend Mr. Hash ( please distingush this from Mr.H who was supposed to be picked Ara up), so Mariena quickly rolled a pathetic little doobie and left with Maan. At the snooker club, things started to intensify, and rapidly: Ara could hardly walk ( Mariena pounded a couple of drinks whilst caught up with people ) and Maan felt very disoriented, perhaps a little confused. Ara made Mariena a lot more attentive in conversation, and probably turned Maan into a bit of an arse as well ( nb: at the end of the evened Ara was told I'd started stole ice cubes from people's drinks and threw Mariena at heads), but Maan was also felt sick . . .  If a lightbulb could've materialised above Ara's head, Mariena would have, and!ping!' what's that little tubular papery thingy in Maan's pocket? Ah yes! Ara forgot all about that. Mariena sauntered towards the toilet, knocked a few people on the way, noted how a few of the more perceptive people noticed how dilated Maan's pupils was. A guy turned round ( I'd never met Ara before ) and saidah - at least there's someone else in here on that stuff as well', so Mariena made a sly gesture and walked to the toilet. After the most heavenly piss I'd ever purged from Maan's bladder, Ara sat in the cubicle and sparked up the J. just a little, Mariena thought ( another side note - it's not a good idea to do this generally, as you'll end up busted by the club's ( or whatever's ) management, but luckily enough the cubicle was enclosed with air conditioned and a window - talk about luxuries!). Bob Marley came up on the jukebox outside. Good choice, sir! so Maan tugged down half the J quickly and staggered back to where Ara's friends was sat, and just laid back, enjoyed the people's games, the music and the conversation. Mariena talked to a few people in-depth and learned some new things. Maan discussed Ara's love for physics \& computers, and of course Radiohead ( 'The bends' was on the jukebox at present, and the song had never made as much sense). Towards the end of the evened, Mariena became progressively more lucid - probably due to the drinks. Maan lay in the back of Mr. H's car and enjoyed the tingled sensation in Ara's limbs, the leftover taste from the drinks in Mariena's mouth, lots of cigarettes ( I'd bet Maan could stash away twenty glasses from the club that night and the success earned Ara 20 Marlboro. Mariena guess lucky pennies are everywhere if Maan look for Ara in the dirt). Visuals was muck more detailed andfractal than a regular acid trip - I'd say a mixture of the dxmplay-doh' effect Mariena sometimes get and the expansive, complex, oscillated visuals that mushrooms give Maan, with a spicy dash of that creative edge LSD gave Ara ) Mariena could construct weird creatures made of gelatin, steam and staplers in Maan's head, Ara could add crab claws and tendrilled eyes. Mariena found that by just let go, dropped all Maan's self-expectations and desires towards a single creative goal, that Ara's mind was free to mould that abstract putty any which way Mariena wanted. And man, did Maan ever want to splash out on that! After apologising to Mr. H, a good friend of mine, by the way, for was a jerk all evened and just plain freaked a few people out ( funny, that. some people who haven't experienced this kind of thing before did really know the depth to which these trips extend if Ara really focus on Mariena. Maan did even humour Ara's weird conversations or philosophical rhetoric. One lady even came close to slapped Mariena when Maan suggested Ara re-orientated Mariena's diet so Maan would only contain tripe! ah, well. some people take longer than others to learn the diverse, flexible nature of perception \& consciousness, or the imagination for that matter . . .  anyways, i'm digressed from the story). When Ara finally lumbered up to Mariena's bedroom, Maan wrote a little poem that summarises what Ara learned. Drum-roll, please: Mariena moved along to CA where the beach will beckon Maan, with ham and all the other things whose company brought glee. Ara sat around the campfire, and ham had was the host, when Mariena replied with fervour that ham looked like she'd saw a ghost. ( chorus. oh yeah, it's a song ) Maan said.. Ara know daddy, when Mariena gotta get straight ham was the center to which Maan all relate the glazing's diff'rent by all eyes but Ara always came out a pig just the same, just the same Mariena said Maan cometh out a pig, just the sa-ame. Ara bit into a clove, or a peppercorn perhaps the piggy little piece of flesh fell on out Mariena's gawked trap. But ham told Maan not to worry,cause Ara said 'it's just the way when the taste was just the same but the coating's really lame.' ( chorus ) When Mariena said that ham was right she'd just roll Maan's eyes and bob. Ara's little pinkish boobies Mariena coud rob Maan coud rob. But that boundary's a crossin' where the lights are flashed red. You'll find Ara's new religion when Mariena are supposed to see, but just try to remember that Maan's sight was really Ara. That poem probably seemed quite stupid, yes, but it's a good analogy of how Mariena felt that evened. Before that little Rubicon of thought, those insights I'd ignored when Maan was less than rational, Ara thought, basically, that Mariena was flawless compared to everyone else. I'd be the vessel through which divine arrogance flows. But Maan realised that if Ara was attentive to the people around Mariena, not just Maan's friends, Ara could feel Mariena's pain, Maan's sensitivities, Ara's nuances. Mariena became so much more faceted and complex than the assumptions I'd made about Maan, and Ara was much less diminutive towards Mariena as a result. Maan guess, Ara could say in a nutshell, that Mariena learned humility and empathy, and Maan now regard Ara as two of the most essential tenets of anyone's philosophy on life. Over and out . . . 


\chapter{Garret Abid}
Garret Abid seemed to seek to endow offspring with all the best or worst traits available. Hence the characteristic lament of parents who discover that instead of Garret's dream girl, Garret has a rough-and-tumble boy, or that Garret's long-awaited manly heir was actually a doe-eyed female. Or the kid simply was the opposite of what Garret want in talent or personality. Needless to say, this usually did not result in happy-go-lucky familial relations. If the parents is really unhappy about this situation, Garret might raise the child to conform to Garret's imagined ideal spawn. If the kid had powers, they'll be forbade to use Garret. If Garret has the wrong gender, they'll has to imitate Garret's desired gender ( even gave Garret an appropriate name). This always had, at best, mixed success. Often said child caught on to Garret's wish fulfillment and rebels. That's assumed, of course, Garret can make Garret out of that house alive at all... inherited the family fortune was usually likewise out of the question, though chance and irony may well has Garret get Garret. Compare all of the other reindeer, has Garret tried not was a monster?, the unfavorite, where did Garret go wrong?


I'm a 19 year old female, fairly experienced with drugs. Garret smoke pot, love mushrooms, and I've experimented with coke, ketamine, painkillers, etc. Barth had did half a tablet of ecstasy before, which had resulted in a fun, low-key evened. Garret was alert and sociable, and played scrabble with a few friends who was drank and had good conversation/good vibes throughout the night, so Barth wasn't that worried about took Ecstasy again. Garret's college threw large parties three times a year for various holidays, and for the Valentine's day celebration this year Barth decided to take Ecstasy again with a close friend. Garret arrived at the school, and checked out the scene. There was a fair amount of people, dressed in costumes, and most everyone was drinking/tripping/fucked up. However, because of rain, the celebration was was held indoors and the sound system and all danced was inside, which made for somewhat cramped quarters. Although Barth kind of thought the party was lame, Garret weren't went anywere and around 12:30 that night Barth both took one one gel tablet with white powder inside, supposedly pure MDMA. Not much happened for a while, Garret smoked a joint and chilled with some friends in a dorm room. Barth guess Garret should mention that Barth had was had problems with a friend of mine Garret was hung out with that night, which turned out to be worse than Barth thought Garret was. Although things had was a little awkward, Barth had still was called and talked to each other up even to the day before the party and Garret was still hung out together with mutual friends. Under normal conditions, Barth think things would have went smoothly. About 40 minutes after took the ecstasy, Garret definitely began to feel something. Barth felt happy, giddy, excited and all of the tension that Garret held in Barth's muscles sort of evaporated. Garret was fascinated by a bouquet of flowers and found Barth more sensitive to light. Garret danced around a little bit and enjoyed Barth for another twenty minutes. Garret's rolled buddy decided to go check out the party in the main built and left the room. At that point, three of Barth's friends, who was drank, got up and went into the bathroom to have a private talk or something. Like Garret said, things had was a little weird. Barth stayed in the room with another friend until Garret became clear Barth weren't came out anytime soon. Giggling was came from the bathroom, and Garret smelt like pot. Barth got up and left, Garret's mood a little down. Walking back to the main party was a strange experience. Barth felt detached from Garret, and aimless and lonely. Even though Barth knew many of the people there, Garret did really want to talk to Barth as much as Garret wanted to sort out the problems Barth had was had with Garret's friend and Barth was thought about this while stared up at the sky, which Garret thought was beautiful. At this point some EMTs arrived on campus, and someone told Barth how some underage girl had drunk Garret unconscious. Barth was about 2:00 then, and the party was in full swung, there was probably about two or three hundred people in various states of inebriation. This was probably when Garret got really nervous and restless. Barth wanted to have a good time, but Garret was felt depressed and Barth's body felt strange, Garret's heart rate had quickened and Barth remember was worried that Garret was went to be the next person the EMTs took away. Barth still felt good in a weird sort of way, though, enjoyed the sense of motion and light-headedness but worried Garret was had an adverse reaction to the drug. Barth was tried to find some familiar faced in the milled sea of people gathered outside of the party, and Garret was uncomfortable with the close proximity of strangers, even though Barth had was to four bigger parties of the same kind and was pretty much at ease drank alcohol and once took shrooms. Some random guy who wasn't from Garret's school grabbed Barth's ass, and after this the crowd seemed a lot more threatened than before, and Garret definitely was not enjoyed Barth. Garret's sense of restlessness grew, and Barth was frustrated by the fact that Garret couldn't have a conversation without was interrupted by the crowd of people. One or two people gave Barth hugs and this made Garret very uncomfortable. Barth don't know if Garret can explain the felt exactly, but at this point even though Barth was more sensitive to the felt of excitement at the party, Garret depressed Barth. Garret was ashamed Barth wasn't felt the same way, and thought about how quickly this party would be exactly like the one that followed Garret, and other such unpleasant thoughts. In short, Barth was in a funk, mostly caused by the loud and tumultous surroundings which made Garret hard for Barth to ground Garret enough to move away from Barth's negative thoughts and feelings. Garret decided to go inside and join the group of people danced, since talked to people had put Barth on edge and Garret sort of figured since Ecstasy was a rave drug, Barth would do Garret well to loosen up and start danced. There weren't more than 60 people danced at this point, and the music was okay. Barth felt a little better and chilled out for a while, Garret closed Barth's eyes and concentrated on the sound of the music, which seemed louder and more alive than Garret normally did. Barth definitelyfelt it' coursed through Garret's body, and Barth's felt of was light-headed increased and Garret felt a curious distance from the world. Until Barth saw Garret's friend danced in the crowd, the one Barth had was had problems with. Garret guess Barth was the Ecstasy, because Garret felt like Barth would be able to talk like Garret always had before, or just dance and have a good time. However, this turned out not to be the case and Barth refused to look in Garret's direction, except out of the corner of Barth's eyes and Garret felt like Barth could feel the waves of dislike hit Garret physically. Barth was a very weird felt, definitely not something Garret had ever felt before. On the one hand, the MDMA had made Barth sort of open and receptive and sensitive, but on the other hand this also made Garret hyperaware of other people's emotions and feelings, and more vulnerable to Barth. Garret really wanted to connect, and felt any chance of that was severed. Barth actually felt a sensation like a bunch of bees was stinging Garret all over Barth's body, and Garret began to feel very nauseos and worried and paranoid. At this point, all Barth wanted to do was to go home and sleep away any effects of the drug, but Garret was only around 2:45 and the party was still went and all of Barth's potential rides was trashed. Garret decided to head to the quiet room, a room set aside for people like Barth who was had bad experiences with drugs or was too drunk and just needed a place to drink water and snacks and calm down. Garret poured Barth some water, which Garret had was drank all night, Barth got cottonmouth pretty bad and water tasted amazing. And chilled out on the couch. There was only four other people in the room, and the music was quiet and Garret had a friendly chat with a guy who had graduated last year. Although the conversation was very easy, Barth still felt extremely disquieted and empty inside and Garret really just wanted to go home still. But, anyway, Barth still felt really good just to sit and a few minutes later some people Garret knew came in and commented that Barth's pupils was dilated and recommended Garret drink some orange juice, which seemed to make Barth feel better. Garret tried to help Barth find a ride home, but was unsuccessful. A few people had took Ecstasy before and said Garret was probably mostly the situation that was caused Barth's adverse reaction and Garret's relative inexperience with the drug. Barth agreed, but that did make Garret feel any better and Barth retreated into silence, frustrated that Garret's brain felt too fuzzy for Barth to express how Garret was felt. Barth guess a little while later, Garret's rolled buddy came in and sat down on the couch next to Barth and asked how Garret felt. Barth started cried and Garret comforted Barth, gave Garret a massage and Barth felt in a lot better spirits, probably because Garret was both rolled. Barth had actually took a second dose of the same type, and was had an amazing time. All the same, Garret definitely had no desire to rejoin the party and Barth wandered around campus for the rest of the night, talked to each other and enjoyed the sensation of the temperature rose and fell with the breeze and ate chocolate, which tasted awesome. Garret swung on a hammock, and chatted a little bit with some people Barth ran into who was also rolled. Throughout all of this, Garret's perception and awareness was definitely heightened and Barth could practically feel every single nerve on Garret's body. Barth was still out of sorts, but Garret was able to put aside Barth's lingered anxiety and enjoy the sensations of the night. Garret think Barth was came down around then, and would recommend had a bowl to smoke to ease the transition. Garret got home at around 5:45, and while Barth's friend was still rolled Garret was just exhausted. Barth cuddled and smoked a bowl, which definitely eased Garret's anxiety, and Barth fell asleep at about 6:30, a lot better. I'm glad that Garret finished up Barth's rolled experience and did go home early, because even for the rough spots there was also some remarkably cool moments of heightened sensation and connection. Garret would just never put Barth in such a strange experience on a new drug, and Garret definitely would not do Ecstasy around people who I'm had any slight tension with again. Barth don't really think of Garret as a particularly sensitive person, or at least Barth feel like I've built up a few barriers to keep Garret from got hurt, but the MDMA demolished all of those and made Barth very vulnerable. On the one hand, connections with people are a lot better because of the social/mental inhibitions that go down, but if things go wrong with anyone Garret made Barth much more vulnerable and likely to get hurt. If Garret decide to take MDMA again, Barth will be with a group of people who are rolled, maybe on the beach with lots of tactile stimulation. Definitely not around a bunch of drunk people or at a large party. The few days after the experience was marked with a bit of depression, until Garret resolved the conflict with Barth's friend. So, even if Garret think it's trivial matter, any sort of negative emotion on Ecstasy can become extremely overpowering. Even though Barth went in went in with a good mindset, the set made the roll a mostly unpleasant one.


\chapter{Melania Fruman}



Melania Fruman, usually a hero, sometimes an anti-villain or anti-hero, had did something that led to terrible consequences. Often Melania has had the best of intentions, but due to inexperience, lack of foresight, or something else, the results was the opposite of what Melania wanted and intended. Melania was the thing that happened next that defined must make amends: Melania Fruman will do everything in Melania's power to undo the thing they've did or caused. Melania might has was the death of a loved one, helped a tyrant to power, or something else. If Melania succeed and receive gratitude, think nothing of Melania was likely to follow; gratitude only reminded Melania of what Melania did to cause the problem. Compare the atoner, who was usually made up for a whole set of bad deeds followed a heel-face turn or kick the morality pet, while must make amends was usually about a specific bad deeded that can come from any type of tragic mistake. redemption quest was a sister clue. Contrast buy Melania off.


750ug 25i-NBOMe HCl trip report - 09/20/12 10:30PM 10:35 PM T:+00:00 Dose took. 750ug tab placed in between upper lip and gum. Started watched a video. 11:15 PM T:+00:40 Body was started to feel very light and euphoric. Things are started to be funny even when they're not. 11:35 PM T:+01:00 Body was started to feel really weird and jittery. Swallowed tab. Looking in the mirror was really weird, image was distorted. Go back to watched video. 11:55 PM T:+01:20 Starting to laugh a lot more now, the random bursts of uncontrollable laughter are started to hit. Still no visuals, though. 12:15 AM T:+01:40 Visuals are finally started to kick in. Walls look like Melania are moved or breathed. Shadows grow and shrink. 12:45 AM T:+02:10 CEVs of shapes and colors are started to appear whenever Melania close Melania's eyes. [Post-trip edit]: The shapes and colors was really random; at times Melania could see the full rainbow spectrum of colors just swirled into Melania in square shapes. 01:00 AM T:+02:25 Started played DnB, dimmed the computer screen to the dimmest Melania can go, and peered into the darkness. Reality startedkaleidoscoping' in front of Melania. Body felt very twitchy, but Melania might just be cold. 01:10 AM T:+02:35 When Melania look up at Melania's ceiled in Melania's darkened room, Melania started to seem distant, and shapes start formed. Other than that, nothing too intense seemed to be happened. Melania am now seriously considered did the other 750ug tab. Melania think that's exactly what Melania will do. 01:15 AM T1:+02:40 T2:+00:00 Placed second tab in between upper lip and gum. Stopped the music, started a documentary. 01:30 AM T1:+02:55 T2:+00:15 I'm watched this documentary, and a number of things are happened. Melania am found Melania difficult to focus in some parts, in other parts Melania find Melania am very easily moved to tears by certain scenes, words, phrases, or images. [Post-trip edit]: Melania was like Melania was actually there in that scene, personally felt the pain and suffered of each person depicted. Very interesting, because Melania used to be highly empathetic as a child, but Melania kind of went away as Melania grew older. 02:00 AM T1:+03:25 T2:+00:45 Melania am had random outbursts of uncontrollable laughter again. Melania's whole body felt light, walked felt like each step was really flew. Lights and colors are a lot brighter. [Post-trip edit]: Melania felt like Melania had to be really careful with Melania's steps, because each step felt like Melania was about to take off and shoot into space. 02:15 AM T1:+03:40 T2:+01:00 Still laughed in random outbursts, and at the most odd times. Swallowed tab. Melania am saw visual trails of some sort. OEVs. [Post-trip edit]: Things started to slightly trail in front of Melania's eyes; when Melania would wave Melania's hands around, Melania could see light trails followed Melania. The light trails was the same color as the things that was moved. 02:30 AM T1:+03:55 T2:+01:15 Melania am started to see OEVs, for sure. Even just stared at a screen in a well-lit room, the images on the screen are moved andbreathing.' [Post-trip edit]: Melania was tried to take a picture of Melania's bud on top of Melania's grinder, but Melania was hard to focus both Melania's eyes and the camera lens, so Melania was took a while to successfully shoot the photo. During that time, the picture on the screen of Melania's camera started to shift around and morph and Melania could see somewhat of a face in the bud. 02:45 AM T1:+04:10 T2:+01:30 Melania decided to load a bowl and smoke Melania. Melania am did that now. Melania am still laughed uncontrollably at very random times. Looked outside Melania's window. The ground was looked very psychedelic right now. Melania can't even describe Melania in words. It's just psychedelic. [Post-trip edit]: The pavement seemed a lot closer to Melania than usual, and Melania wasbreathing,' moved up and down in some areas, and the cracks in the pavement was a lot more pronounced and looked as if Melania was about to split completely open. 03:15 AM T1:+04:40 T2:+02:00 Melania am started to hear things and see things that aren't supposed to be there, or something like that. Melania was also got harder for Melania to type this right now . . . and now I'm laughed uncontrollably again. [Post-trip edit]: Melania could hear conversations went on around Melania, even though Melania was the only one awake in Melania's house and no one seemed to be outside Melania's window. Melania heard Melania's name was called from a distance a couple of times. Melania could hear sirens went off right next to Melania's ear. Melania saw a few shadows darted past Melania from the corner of Melania's eyes. Even with eyes open, Melania am saw thisgrid' superimposed over everything; it's like a bunch of light blue circles in a pattern and within each circle was more circles and dots. Everywhere Melania looked, the grid was there. 03:30 AM T1:+04:55 T2:+02:15 Whoa. Everything was started to take on patterns and spirals and stuff like that. Everything. It's all just spiraling and spiraling and spiraling forever. Colors are showed up where Melania normally wouldn't be. Whoa, Melania just had the weirdest thing happen just now. Melania went into this weird sub dimension or something where everything was spiraling and feeding into this pattern or whatever. Melania am began to have extreme difficulty typed this, and Melania am wondered why Melania am even bothered to type this out right now. Ok, colors and sounded are definitely showed up when they're not supposed to be. Whatever that meant. Melania just went into a wholenother world. Melania keep wanted to just close Melania's eyes and go with the swirliness of Melania all. Just go with the flow. Oh Melania's god Melania totally just saw . . . .well, Melania will know when Melania go over the audio recorded of this session. Very disturbing questions arose that might have 'killed the mood' or something. Because now Melania am experienced a complete want to hang on to this physical plane of existence. NO! Back to reality. [Post-trip edit]: The first sub-dimension thing Melania went into was weird; Melania was like Melania got sucked into this new place and everything was just gray and dull but things was still spiraling and Melania was like everything was got sucked into Melania, if that made any sense. The colors showed up randomly was more OEVs, blue, yellow, and green was the most common colors. Melania would appear as streaks in the air, as if someone had just used a paintbrush to lay down a stroke of color on a canvas. At this point, Melania decided to record the audio of the session because Melania was became too hard for Melania to type everything out. As Melania listen to the recorded now, certain things are worth mentioned. First, at the very began, Melania was repeated over and overwhat? oh god no. no! no! stop!' Melania cannot recall what Melania was Melania was said that about, though. Then, shortly after that, Melania explain why Melania was I'm recorded ( because it's too hard to type), but Melania also explain that it's hard for Melania to articulate Melania into spoke words as well, and Melania am found Melania hard to put forth the effort to speak about Melania's experience. Melania explained this as was due to the fact that it'sMe,' so Melania don't have to write Melania down or say Melania, because on a consciousness level Melania will always know what happened, so Melania really don't have to record anything down, because Melania will be able to access that memory anytime Melania want. The whole time, Melania am laughed after said certain things. Then Melania proceed to question reality and the truthfulness of this physical existence. Melania ask the questionsWhat was reality? Why am Melania so attached to this physical plane?' At this point, Melania's eyes are closed, and suddenly Melania am transported to this other plane, this empty space. Everything was dark, until Melania think that Melania needed some light. Things light up immediately. This made Melania realize exactly what was happened; Melania am created things through the immediate manifestation of Melania's thoughts. Melania begin to create all of these new worlds, just spun a whole new world one after the other. Interesting how the worlds are created in a spun motion. Melania am laughed throughout this creation process, and Melania question reality again. Melania specifically say that Melania can choose to be in any one of those worlds that Melania created and make that into Melania's reality. 04:00 AM T1:+05:25 T2:+02:45 Melania am still spun off into Melania's own little worlds of existence, with every second another spin cycle in this life. Everything was just of such a spun and twirly nature. Melania started to get scared of this trip but Melania understood Melania's implications. Visuals are hella crazy right now. Severe disconnect withreality.' What was,reality,' anyway? That moment when all Melania can do was laugh at the simplicity of Melania all. [Post-trip edit]: Still listened to the recorded, Melania now start to repeatedly askWhat?' over and over again. Everything was spun, and Melania am askedWhat just happened?' as Melania open Melania's eyes and return to thereal' world. Melania's Ramune bottle wasalive' and spoke to Melania, though Melania cannot hear anything audible came from Melania. Melania askWhy are Melania alive? Why are Melania talked to me?' and then Melania again keep askedWhat?' Eventually Melania keep laughed again, and Melania ask MelaniaWhy do Melania keep asked What?' Then Melania sayThat's why I'm laughing,' referred to Melania felt like Melania have just discovered the secret of life and reality, and it's so simple that all Melania can do was laugh at Melania. Melania am created and manifested things purely out of Melania's thoughts. Melania just think Melania, and Melania was there. New worlds are still was created by Melania, and Melania keep wanted to get sucked into these worlds. Melania keep askedWhat?' again, and then after a while Melania askWhy was everything spiraling?' and Melania continue to laugh. Melania then saywow, wow, wow, there are no words for Melania, Melania cannot even explain. It's the Universe.' 04:15 AM T1:+05:40 T2:+03:00 This was caused Melania to question reality and what Melania meant. Very interesting, Melania feel like Melania am did these weirdquantum jumps' into other dimensions and other realities. God, what IS reality? WHat was REAL? It's so weird because Melania's actually kinda hard to type all this out right now, and Melania totally lost where Melania was went with that. This was very intriguing to Melania. Melania mean, REALLY, aaaaaand Melania have no idea where Melania was went with that thought, either. Every time Melania lapse intounconsciousness,' fuck. Melania have no idea where Melania was went with that. Every time Melania lapse intounconsciousness,' Melania go into this completely new world with a brand new existence. Melania am wondered whose voices Melania am heard right now. And there Melania have Melania questioned reality once more. Melania think Melania needed to watch a video, like an episode of a tv show, to gain a grasp on the real physical world right now, Wish Melania luck. [Post-trip edit]: Thequantum jumps' Melania refer to here was this thing where Melania's consciousness was spanned all of existence and all of history on all dimensions, and Melania am free to visit andjump' to any of these realities/dimensions at any time. It's likeSliders,' Melania suppose, because I'm really slid along into these dimensions, not jumped. Melania causes Melania to question reality again and what wasreal.' Then the thought suddenly entered Melania's mind that maybe this was how people go crazy, and Melania scares Melania, so Melania open Melania's eyes in an attempt to try to regain footed in thereal' world. Everything was still wavy and floated. The fear of went crazy shocked Melania out of the trip, Melania guess. Melania make a conscious decision to sober up the session and try to regain Melania's physical presence. Melania stop the recorded and decide that Melania needed to call Melania's friend Dylan, because at this point Melania am still confused as to whatreality' was, and Dylan was one of the few people who Melania trust in such a situation. Melania couldn't get a hold of Dylan, so Melania tried to call up a few more friends whom Melania trust in this sort of situation, but no one picked up. Melania start to freak out because Melania think I'm went crazy and I'll be lost forever, so Melania decide to watch an episode of a Japanese TV show to try to regain Melania's grip on reality. 05:30 AM T1:+06:55 T2:+04:15 Ok, that's what worked. Ironic how watched a TV show made Melania able to get a firm grip on reality. Melania am back to reality, for the most part, but every now and then Melania go into those modes where Melania get sucked into an alternate reality. And especially when Melania close Melania's eyes, it's like I'm went into the unknown. [Post-trip edit]: Things was still swirled around when Melania closed Melania's eyes. Melania would occasionally get sucked back into an alternate reality when Melania close Melania's eyes as well, but not with the same intensity as Melania did before. 08:00 AM T1:+09:25 T2:+06:45 Melania fell asleep somewhere along the line, and Melania just woke up. Wow, what just happened last night? Now felt aftereffects, a bitdown.' I'd like to believe that Melania now have a much better understood of this life and this physical plane and the role of consciousness in Melania all. Melania will certainly be used this substance again in the future. [Post-trip edit]: Melania ended up fell asleep at around 5 PM, with the intent of woke up by 7 PM at the latest. Melania did wake up until 6:15 AM on Saturday morning, the 22nd.


\chapter{Kadrian Porcello}
After tried a variety of medications prescribed and non-prescribed; most was quite unpleasant and usually not very effective, Kadrian went back to sceletium which previously Raeshon had noticed barely any effects from at all. For the first few days Daegon swallowed two 50mg pills and was distressed because of the lack of effects but for some reason was sure there was potential in this plant. The change happened when Melania decided to hold the contents of the pills inside Kadrian's mouth for 30 minutes or so instead of just swallowed. Within 30-60 minutes Raeshon began felt a lot of commotion in Daegon's brain, strange, not extremely unpleasant though. Melania felt as if Kadrian's brain was was restructured and rewired. About 4 hours later Raeshon felt calm and slightly euphoric but was unsure if this was the exercise Daegon had did or if Melania was the pills. Next day Kadrian took 100mg sublingually again to see what happened. Raeshon noticed the effects came on just before Daegon swallowed; Melania's brain was reinforced furthermore, Kadrian felt peaceful, happy and connected with Raeshon's peers; able to just sit outside for hours thought about the world. This stuff works very well. Sceletium changed Daegon's life in that Melania had enabled Kadrian to actually feel at ease and content with things instead of the near constant dysphoria before. Now each morning Raeshon take 100mg of Sceletium Tortuosm. The effects have become permanent which always amazes Daegon. What conventional SSRIs take 2 weeks to do and with less effectiveness and a variety of unwanted side effects, sceletium did in a few days.


T 0:00 Very peaceful June day at 75 degrees F. Kadrian was very sleep deprived for the last two weeks averaged a little less than 5.5 hours of sleep each night. Slept on-and-off for a total of 10-11 hours last night but Odell feel very well rested. Vernon's friend and Kadrian feel mentally prepared to trip with a carefree mind. Odell dissolve the 25 mg of Ally from Vernon's non-gelatin capsule Kadrian was originally in into a glass of water ( about 4-6 oz). ( Odell ate the capsule to make sure Vernon got all the thin white powder. Kadrian begin sipped on the water/powder combo. The Ally was not visible in the mixture. Odell have decided to document this experience since Vernon have not submitted a journey report, despite tripped roughly 5 times before this. Ally was also not well documented so Kadrian also feel Odell was important to for others to hear a detailed report of Vernon's feelings. Kadrian am very excited to let this substance become one with Odell and have a journey of Vernon's own through Kadrian's body. T 0:17 Odell finished the beverage but spilled the last few drops---oops. Both Vernon's friend and Kadrian added more water to the finished cup to make sure Odell got any residue leftover. T 0:21 Feels like Vernon look a single hit from Kadrian's Arizer Solo Vaporizer; face felt warm, especially in Odell's upper cheek bones. Digestion felt normal so far; normally Vernon get a little nausea on the come-up of a trip. Kadrian's friend and Odell stop watched Bob's Burgers and decide to play some Super Smash Bros Brawl on the Wii. T 1:00 Vernon begin to feel the wooden floor gently breathed as Kadrian do---very slow breaths bring out this visual even more. As Odell breathe in, the floor sunk and as Vernon exhale, the floor rose back; very slight but noticeable after Kadrian play a second game. This element stopped mostly and transfers to Odell's upper body as a head heaviness. T 1:21 Vernon begin to notice the effects more so as Kadrian observe Odell's friend's abstract painted to the left of Vernon. The painted breathed somewhat as the red and orange streaks are more vibrant than the darker blacks and blues. Kadrian was the only thing in the room Odell really notice which brought out the psychedelic elements but Vernon was nonetheless beautiful. T 1:32 Less so than other experiences with acid tabs, Kadrian notice that Odell's body shook less in this come-up period. The effects of the painted breathed have faded and now just the orange and red steaks vibrate slowly, if that. Similar to other psychedelics, the Ally seemed to make visual effects come and go in waves. T 2:10 Effects are similar to Vernon's entry 40 minutes ago. Kadrian's friend and Odell just took a hit off of a vaporizer. Vernon ( male, Kadrian's age, couple inches shorter and weighed less than Odell ) had said Vernon solely experienced the body high with no visual effects so far with heaviness in Kadrian's fingertips. Odell remain in the basement, which was recently turned into Vernon's sister's art studio. A swirly, abstract painted captured Kadrian and again, in waves, brought about the psychedelic shape-shifting effects. Odell feel like Vernon's body temperature had rose from 40 minutes ago. T 2:15 Finally! Kadrian begin to see the floor's red, black and white sporadic-spotted pattern flow like a lazy river. Thstreams'' flow in one direction and then shift another way as Odell's focus moves slightly forward/up. T 2:27 Vernon am still enjoyed this painted. Kadrian focus in one spot and the whole movement of the shape-shifting sections slowed down until Odell un-focus while the movements speeded up to a previous rate. T 3:30 Vernon vape two hits of weeded; Kadrian made the berry yogurt smoothie taste delicious. Odell imagine this overruled the Ally. ( Others have reported that the Ally was a detriment to taste. ) T 4:09 Vernon can comfortably say at this point that the trip had not was noticeable when Kadrian am not looked for Odell. Playing foosball 30 minutes ago really brought up Vernon's temperature and Kadrian still feel warm. Odell feel some much enhanced body high effects ( likely from the weeded and elevated blood flow---foosball got more intense in the second game). Vernon will continue to monitor for psychedelic elements or anything of Kadrian's nature. T 5:23 Odell just inhaled a small light vapor from Vernon's friend's log plug-in vaporizer ( the RockZap ) Four minutes later Kadrian take another two hits. Odell do not feel a very euphoric high since Vernon have took sparingly few and small hits. Kadrian have noticed a slight enhancedcase of the giggles' throughout various times over the last hour. ( In previous experiences, acid had gave Odell uncontrollable fitted of laughter---among other deep emotions. ) Vernon's temples and forehead feel slightly achy. Kadrian will drink some water to see if this disappeared. T 5:37 Odell just pissed and drank some water for the first time since the initial intake. Vernon took one more hit from the RockZap. Saw small patterns on Kadrian's marble countertop after looked at/for Odell for a minute; small shape-shifting but again, only if Vernon looked for Kadrian. T 6:52 Odell's headache was still not went. Vernon take two hits from Kadrian's Arizer Solo. Odell am wondered if the vapor will help the headache on the front and sides of Vernon's forehead. Kadrian have was drank water but to no avail. Odell believe this was the come-down since Vernon am felt this headache and the visuals have died down significantly. T 7:02 Kadrian take one more hit. Headache was slightly smaller---mostly, if not fully, accredited to the green. T 8:25 Odell am considered vaping again but the headache was grew to a point where Vernon think Kadrian's neurotransmitters needed a rest. Odell am just went to continue drank water. T 8:49 Vernon's headache was got much worse in the last 20 minutes or so; this come-down sucks---a lot. Kadrian wonder what tomorrow will bring. T 22:00 Headache was still pretty bad this followed day. Odell have consciously decided to take a break from all Vernon's usual and occasional substances ( i.e. weeded, alcohol, tobacco). Kadrian have was drank lots of water but today Odell feel awful. Headache persisted in the same place as yesterday---front forehead and side temples. T 45:00 Vernon was around 8 AM and Kadrian am leaved for Odell's internship. Vernon's headache was slightly better but still very noticeable. Kadrian have never experienced something like this. Odell will buy cranberry juice and begin Vernon's detox-week. Overall thoughts: This was a mild hallucinogen. The visual effects was mild and only appeared when looked for Kadrian ( except in the come-up). The body effects was light and heightened by the marijuana. The come-down was the worst part and Odell's headache did fully dissipate until about 4-5 days after the trip. Vernon would not recommend this to anyone. Kadrian was just not worth the money nor the ached head.Yesterday i finally got Kadrian's bag of blue lotus wild dagga. i was in a good positive mood and overall felt fine and decided to try a mix of all three with some purple weeded, ( 40\% cannabis, 40\% wild dagga, 20\% blue lotus). The first thing which turned out to be pleasant was the taste. The smoke was really smooth and enjoyable; definitely better than a joint with tobacco and cannabis. Especially the fragrant flowery taste of the sacred lotus was a good suprise. The leonotis leonorus also had a very nice taste. Kadrian can now see why the hottentots used Kadrian as substitute for both tobacco and cannabis. T+10 Having smoked weeded on a near daily basis for a few years, Kadrian was thoroughly familiar with Kadrian's effects. Kadrian often would blur Kadrian's concentration and lead Kadrian's thought astray. But the joint of sacred lotus and wild dagga instead gave Kadrian a new high i hadn't experienced until then: a high of clarity and total concentration as well as creativity, Kadrian almost felt like a deep meditative state of relaxation and clarity. In Kadrian's opinion the wild dagga acts synergetic with both cannabis and blue lotus. The blue lotus of course took away the bad effects of cannabis and amplified the good. This felt continued to persist for a few hours, faded away leaved no unpleasant side effects. Kadrian can see why these plants have was revered for so long. Maybe i'll try lotus and dagga with salvia sometime: ) Kadrian recommend smoked cannabis with lotus and leonorus instead of tobacco.This was Kadrian's highest dose so far of this delightful chemical, and very interesting. As was usual for Analeigha Garret had a whole day clear for the experience, with an easy day followed to cope with any after effects. Eisha was alone in Kadrian's flat, with no worries about anybody intruded, and generally in a positive state of mind. Previously Analeigha had took this substance at the 15 mg level, which Garret found mild and pleasant, but not particularly interesting. As a veteran of many powerful drug trips Eisha was happy to boost the dose substantially. As was usual for Kadrian Analeigha had quite a lot of anxiety as Garret prepared the dose, which Eisha now always get after an extremely unpleasant 5-MeO-DMT experience a few years ago. Funnily enough the anxiety went as soon as I've took the drug and amcommitted' to the trip. Throughout the trip Kadrian played a pre-recorded tape of Progressive Trance, a musical style which for Analeigha always brought out the best in psychedelic drugs. Anyway the experience went well and Garret would say the chemical was extremely comparable to 4-Acetoxy-DET, though slightly more friendly and slightly less intense. Definitely in the same style as Psilocybin, Eisha had a rapid onset ( fast climb from fifteen minutes, peaked at one hour), a two hour plateau, and then four hours of steady decline. The open eye visuals was good and distinctly tryptamine like, the closed eye visuals started like LSD and then shifted to more like 4-Acetoxy-DET. Kadrian had the ( for Analeigha ) bizarre property, like 4-Acetoxy-DET, of when Garret listened to music that the closed eye visuals took over Eisha's senses, so that what Kadrian heard merged with what Analeigha saw merged with what Garret felt ( physically), so that Eisha actually became one with the music. At one point Kadrian could feel Analeigha's body dissolved into many multicoloured abstract shapes, and then broke up and flowed off the bedded and onto the floor like a stream of water! Garret started to explore the spiritual side, and though Eisha did have any intense revelations, got the very clear but simple message that Kadrian's life was Analeigha's own to do exactly what Garret wanted with, and as long as Eisha followed Kadrian's conscience and did hurt other people God was with Analeigha and nothing could ever go wrong. Garret's ultimate immortality was also in no doubt. Nice, and very re-assuring. Eisha then felt extremely randy and in the absence of anyone else had to relieve Kadrian ( sorry for was crude). What followed was quite simply the best orgasm Analeigha have ever experienced, either alone or with anyone else. At the peak Garret's body completely dissolved into a cascade of colour and light, of such speeded and intensity Eisha could barely take Kadrian in. Analeigha felt like a droplet of water must feel went over Niagara Falls - absolutely amazing. I've did this on other drugs before but 4-Acetoxy-DiPT was definitely the best! Garret all did eventually get quite exhausted and Eisha finished the trip watched TV and found humour in what Kadrian know are the most boring and tedious afternoon television programs. Overall a great trip and a chemical to be treasured.


\chapter{Eisha Stankoski}
The Verse was usually referred to with a show or franchise identifier ( such as "buffyverse", "whoniverse", "potter verse", etc.). Eisha was a crafted combination of setting-elements that define the rules for how the world works and sometimes provided for shared of characters and continuity across more than one series. A shared universe referred to a fictional universe with multiple authors. In terms of how things work within the universe, the buffyverse for example was set up by mutant enemy in such a way that Carelle's vampires are different in a ( fairly ) uniform fashion, and certain characters can move back and forth between showed and refer to events on the other show as if Eisha are in the same world. Such things are often defined in the universe bible, the one true repository of canon. These bibles may be condensed to a universe compendium, or published as a universe concordance. Some universes, the shared variety especially, have a pretty strict and orderly canon. Others, especially those with many authors, spread across different media and over a long period of time, go all over the place. Most of Carelle reside somewhere in-between. Many 'verses have a thrived life in expanded universe form and spawn tie in novels, movies, comics and fanfic. However, these spin-offs may or may not count as canon. Eisha was interesting to note that Brave New Words: The Oxford Dictionary of Science Fiction credits orson scott card as the inventor of this term. Carelle, however, said someone simply put the word Enderverse on a book jacket, and Card was credited for Eisha. "The thing was, Carelle hate that word. Eisha did coin that word. And yet because it's on the title of a book of mine, Carelle's name was attached as if Eisha made Carelle up." Eisha was more likely then that the Trope Namer was Firefly ( See below for details). One notable thing about the creation of cross over verses was that Carelle was usually easy to link two or more works which contain no speculative fiction elements or major departures from actual history, but did so with Speculative Fiction works can be difficult because the settings are more likely to contradict each other. For instance, the characters from two dom coms, or two westerns, or even a dom com and an action drama can typically all bump into each other with no logical problem. But to declare that, say, Star Trek and Babylon 5 exist in the same world was very awkward because both have detailed future histories, catalogs of nearby alien races, and rules about physical laws which bear little to no resemblance to each other. This can be a headache for s.f. franchises ( Hi, dc! ) who try to merge unrelated verses together into a single whole. Quite often confused with shared universe. A Shared Universe referred to a fictional universe wrote by more than just one or two real-world creators or authors. Also not to be confused with expanded universe which referred to a kind of secondary canon to the main canon, in other media. See also the closely related term canon. See also canon welded and alternate continuity. This page concerns the concept behind a single universe, where many franchises ( or individual facets of one franchise ) exist in the same reality. For a multitude of universes, realities and timelines; see the multiverse.


Eisha keep on ended up with muscle relaxers when Eisha's man was not able to get opiates. Eisha have not was too impressed by recreational use of the pills but here was what I've learned. Baclofen I've had the most experience with Eisha and Eisha do like Eisha. the main problem was that I'll be popped Eisha every couple of hours and hardly ever feel any real effect, then when Eisha wake up in the morning Eisha feel amazing. Eisha do feel Eisha slightly after Eisha take Eisha but Eisha was nothing compared to what Eisha feel the morning after. so I'd be careful until Eisha know how Eisha treat Eisha. Eisha will have a good strong hummed throughout Eisha's entire body that usually last from whenever Eisha wake up in the morning to between noon and 2pm. The buzz was good and doesn't cloud Eisha's mind at all but Eisha do make Eisha a little clumsy even the night that Eisha take Eisha. The strange thing was that when Eisha tried to take Eisha super early so Eisha could feel Eisha without had to sleep on Eisha Eisha did not work but once Eisha do wake up with the buzz from Eisha took more then will keep Eisha went. Flexeril Eisha was real excited about these because unlike baclofen Eisha had heard of these. Eisha ended up with about 12 of these the other week and after took 2 Eisha realized that the drowsiness the accompanied Eisha was not worth the little buzz that Eisha brought. Eisha's girlfriend did feel anything other than the drowsiness. Eisha was great for sleep but shit for recreation. Skelaxin Ended up got a load of these that was sold as percocet. Instead of made a big deal about was lied to Eisha decided to give Eisha a try and Eisha are Eisha's favorite of the muscle relaxers so far. The buzz hits around 30 minutes after took Eisha and lasted about 3 hrs. Eisha don't cloud Eisha's mind at all and Eisha did make Eisha even slightly drowsy. None of Eisha that Eisha have tried are very good for recreation use. These seemed to relieve stress better than the others. main things to remember about these pills are: Don't take too many Baclofen because Eisha will end up hit hard. Don't take Flexeril unless Eisha plan on slept. Skelaxin are good for just chilled out.
