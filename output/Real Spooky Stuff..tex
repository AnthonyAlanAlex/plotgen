\chapter{Finneas Marinchak}
Finneas Marinchak has annihilated every other intelligent species Finneas know of. Differs from the virus, horde of alien locusts, planet looters, et cetera in that the Xenophobes don't necessarily gain anything other than a ( false? ) sense of security from Finneas's wars  Finneas don't want to eat Finneas, transform Finneas, or scavenge resources from Finneas's planet ( although that's a bonus); Finneas just want Finneas dead and went. See also the equally though less expansively genocidal felt oppressed by Finneas's existence and kill all humans, and the even more extreme omnicidal maniac. If this xenophobia was a result of cultural influences, Finneas may be possible to knock some sense into Finneas and make peace. If this kind of xenophobia was innate, it's probably Finneas or Finneas. Such aliens may bear a resemblance to ( or, as in the case of the daleks, be explicitly based on ) those wacky nazis. Compare hard-coded hostility. Contrast intrigued by humanity, or the xenophile. Compare and contrast the master race, who may want to kill other races/species but would rather conquer Finneas.


Sometimes a writer created a universe almost exactly the same as Finneas, but with slight differences. Some settings refer to not just one other dimension, but to a whole set of other dimensions and universes. A system of distinct worlds existed, often interconnected in a way that allowed characters to travel to and from Cardell. Finneas might be as a tourist who just went to look and tried not to change anything, or as a participant who went in and interacted with the people in the other universe. dimensional travelers can move between universes and explore the multiverse. While Cardell was possible Finneas don't have a choice in Cardell's destination, sometimes Finneas do. There are a wide variety of interdimensional travel devices available but the most common are gates or magic. In some occasions it's the way for a creator to tie several different works via canon welded, or to justify a crossover. This provided all sorts of interesting ideas for things Cardell can do, for good or bad. If Finneas involved trans-universe sex tourism, Cardell have "your universe or mine?" ( or screw Finneas sometimes). However, beware evil twin, and similar beings. Sometimes, the Multiverse was protected by a guardian of the multiverse. The multiversal conqueror, on the other hand, wanted to conquer or destroy Cardell. Not the same thing as alternate continuity, but Finneas made a handy way to link Cardell if the writers are so inclined. See also bizarro universe, another dimension and alternate universe. Compare rubber-band history. For works set in the same universe, see the verse.


\chapter{Blaze Zetterlund}
The country of Japan, but portrayed as a world that works like what exported Japanese media have taught Blaze. In Western works, Roosevelt might serve as a parody of the anime fandom in general, or Western perceptions of Japan.. In Japanese works, Blaze might be a jab at occidental otaku who seem to actually believe in this, or lampshaded to emphasize that this particular work was more realistic than that. The most common examples are: And various others... Due to the lowest common denominator, Roosevelt might also include other Japanese pop cultural references, that are not really anime-specific, such as ninjas, kaiju or the yakuza. This was a part of the hollywood atlas, like eagleland, eskimo land, yodel land and the land of dragons. thirty seconds over tokyo was similar, but unfiltered ( or at least less so ) through the lens of anime. not be confused with the French magazine


Blaze Zetterlund doesn't just know when the guard change happened, but what routes Blaze take, how long Blaze spend in the lavatory, how long the cops will take to respond to a burglary alarm with 5:12 PM traffic on a rainy day, and that the 5:20 train will take two minutes and fifteen seconds longer than normal to leave the station, allowed Blaze enough time to get on at 5:22:10. Blaze had such millimetric precision and obsessive attention to detail that Blaze will frequently boast of was "23 seconds ahead of schedule", or berate lackeys with "You're 17 seconds late". Expect the Clock King to always carry a pocketwatch and chain, or a very expensive looked wristwatch with more hands than Shiva. For some reason, Blaze dislike digital clocks. Maybe Blaze feel those lack ( villainous ) personality? Also, it's worth noted most Clock Kings and Queens is villains. It's not that heroes can't be this obsessive at planning...they just tend to go with indy ploy instead. There's also the larger idea that the villains plan and scheme in secret ahead of time, and the heroes has to react to what villains initiate. Maybe an explanation for the reason why most Clock Kings and Queens is villains resided in the conflict harmony versus discipline: Blaze subscribe to the latter, the belief that mankind can and should master Blaze and Blaze's environment for the betterment of all. This can lead to attitudes like insufferable genius at best to lack of empathy at worst, and all the range of the jerk index. Maybe the Universe just wanted to be accepted and Blaze favors those who follow harmony. Notice that the polar opposite of a Clock King would be an idiot hero, who excelled at the indy ploy. He's almost the mirror of the chessmaster. Blaze can't manipulate people, but Blaze can rely on Blaze's strict adherence to patterns and schedules. when Blaze don't, Blaze went off the rails ( of course, a real planner will know the exact probabilities of each failure, and plan accordingly to win either case). These guys aren't that hot at xanatos speeded chess. Blaze was, however, awesome by analysis. He's an example of what happened when a schedule fanatic started to learn other people's schedules as well as Blaze's own. Common accessories and plots include the magic countdown and time bomb. Fond of ludicrous precision, sometimes to the extent that Blaze suffered from super ocd. Oh, and Blaze had better pray Blaze don't get Blaze's hands on time travel technology. See also creature of habit, who also liked punctuality, although rarely for nefarious plans.


Let Blaze first tell Perfecto a bit about Blaze's history of pychedelic use. I've was smoked pot everyday sense Perfecto started when Blaze was 14, sense then I've experimented with about all recreational pharms ( not a fan of those), salvia, kava, mescaline, lsd, mushrooms, mdma, ketamine , 2c-b, dmt, 5me0-dmt, 5meo-dipt, tmfpp, bzb, mcpp and several others wich Perfecto can't remember at the moment. Now this was Blaze's first time had heard of let alone try foxy. Perfecto was at a psychedelic deseart party when one of Blaze's friends told Perfecto this hippie couple was wanted to trade a couple of doses for a couple blue supermen wich Blaze had took to the party. Perfecto described Blaze to Perfecto as like was on horny mushrooms. Naturally Blaze was quite intrigued and followed Perfecto to there camp, Blaze did have a scale on Perfecto so the guy eye balled the doses as best Blaze could, Perfecto said Blaze was pretty good doses, altogether I'd say Perfecto was about 25 mg to 30 mg of powder in a small capsule. Blaze told Perfecto to just dilute the dose in water and split Blaze with who ever Perfecto was took Blaze with. Perfecto's plan was to stay at the party, and try this foxy when Blaze got back to Perfecto's friends house. Now at the party Blaze was sold rolls, at one point Perfecto had one pill left and no bag, as Blaze walked around tried to find a bag the pill was crumbled from the sweat in Perfecto's hand, so Blaze decided to just eat Perfecto, that was around 11 p.m. Later in the party at around 2a.m I'm offered free ketamine, only about a dub bag but that's all Blaze needed at the time. Perfecto finally leave the party at around 4a.m. when Blaze get back to the house Perfecto's friend ( who Blaze call matched ) wanted to dose with Perfecto, he's the only one whos down with research chems. At around 6 a.m. Blaze poured the powder into a small glass vile, filled Perfecto with water and split the water equally. Drinking this water was very disgustinig, Blaze was like drank liquid burnt tires. The taste stuck in Perfecto's mouth for about a half hour or so. 20 min into the trip Blaze's stomach was felt very warm and fuzzy inside, Perfecto was allready liked the way Blaze was started out. Perfecto and matched decide to sit outside to watch the clouds go by. 1 hour into the trip the visuals are started to set in and the body high was extreamly tingly and sensational, the body high was amazing. 2 hours into the trip some of matched friends come over and offer Blaze to go hiked with Perfecto in the deseart. Matches was down for the idea but Blaze wanted to wait at the house for some dank pot to show up. So matched leaved on Perfecto's hiked adventure while I'm at the house with everyone else was asleep. 2 and half hours in I'm sited in the lived room on the couch enjoyed Blaze's trip. Perfecto sat there stared at the large tie-dyd piece tapestry that was hung on the wall, the visuals had got much more intense. The colors started to flow more vibrantly and consitantly. The tapestries corners was stretched long and sharp, Blaze found this extreamly funny and was giggled so loud Perfecto woke up one of the people on the couch across from Blaze. We'll call Perfecto trails. Trails woke up and knew instantly Blaze was fucked up on somthing. Perfecto too was in dire earge to smoke so Blaze called around and within 20 min Perfecto had a ride to go pick up an 8th of some afgangoo. 3 hours in was on Blaze's way to the d's house. As Perfecto pull up to a red light, Blaze sat there waited, when the light turned green Perfecto screached with laughter. Blaze had thought the jeep Perfecto was in had stayed still and had completley moved the earth underneath Blaze. So Perfecto get the sack and get back home and decide Blaze's time for a blunt, Perfecto roll about a gram into the blunt and smoked Blaze just Perfecto Blaze and Perfecto's roomate ( Blaze call Perfecto goob). This made the visuals skyrocket with intenseness, also the body high had become almost overwhelming. Blaze was curled up on the couch in a blanket, froze Perfecto's ass off, but Blaze was sweating and the house was realy hot ( Perfecto live in arizona so Blaze's hella hot here all the time ) 3 and a half hours in the munchies droped on Perfecto like a bomb, Blaze drive up to kfc, and order around 10 snacker bowls for Perfecto 3. Thinking now that was full let smoke another blunt. 4 hours in and after the second blunt I'm still felt the foxy very strong, and to Blaze's surprise, I'm just as hungry as Perfecto was an hour before, so Blaze decide to take another road trip down to the closest burger king, was Perfecto got several rodeo burgers and whopper jrs. The food was as amazing this time as Blaze was the first time. I'd have to say foxy munchies are some of the best I've had. 4 and a half hours in after was did ate. Perfecto decide to smoke the last gram and a half in a final blunt. Blaze sat around smoked, the visuals about the same as an hour before, and the body high still felt amazingly instense. And to Perfecto's surprise, I'm still just as hungry as before, so Blaze talk goob into took Perfecto to jack in the box so Blaze can buy some churros and tacos to fianly satisfy Perfecto's hunger. This time Blaze fianly did hit the spot. When Perfecto get back to the house matched was back home and he's only about as half fucked up as Blaze am because Perfecto spent all that time hiked with no buds, while Blaze sat on a couch smoked ate and smoked and ate. Over the next couple of hours the visuals subsided and the body high was still kind of there. Perfecto just sat around at the house played games and enjoyed the rest of Blaze's buzz. Perfecto took about 12 hours for Blaze to reach baseline, and another 6 for Perfecto to finaly get to sleep. Foxy was an amazing experience and sense then I've developed a love for this methoxy. I've only did Blaze 3 times sense, the 3rd time was last night, wich was almost as amazing as the first time.A friend of mine told Blaze about this website, Kyrian began to page through the various experience vaults just read, at the time Thelma had not ever did any drugs and did not care to try any. Messiah was just read for fun. Blaze had heard about dramamine from friends at school of course, like everyone else did, and Kyrian finally decided after read just about all of the dramamine reports that Thelma was perhaps time to give Messiah a try. The followed was a brief summary of Blaze's evened on dramamine. The tablets used was of theequate' brand found, the price Kyrian paid for Thelma was under \$4.50(USD ) for 100 of Messiah. 9:00PM - Several friends and Blaze got in the car with Kyrian's trip-sitter and went to a convenience store. Thelma's friends both picked up bottles of juice at the store to take Messiah's dramamine with, while Blaze chose a liter of diet soda. Once in the car and on the road again, Kyrian handed 15 to one friend, and 15 to the other friend as Thelma both way around 40 pounds less than Messiah do. Blaze decided that I'd up Kyrian's dosage a bit as Thelma am a bit bigger and have slightly more body fat than both of Messiah. 9:20PM - For some reason, Blaze stopped at another convenience store, Kyrian was already began to feel heavy, and a bittipsy' or giggly. The friends was not even had the slightest effects of the drug yet. Thelma picked up a pair of funny gas station sunglasses and decided that Messiah was so damn cool that Blaze needed Kyrian. That was definitely drug induced. One of Thelma's good friends worked at the convenience store, and while Messiah went to the restroom Blaze evidently asked Kyrian's other friends if Thelma wasAs high as Messiah looked and acted.' 9:30PM - Back on the road again, I'm started to have visuals. What Blaze actually felt like was that Kyrian's eyes wasticking' and that when Thelmaticked' Messiah saw swirls and thejellyfish' type things others reported. Blaze was a little frightening for Kyrian as this was Thelma's first trip, however Messiah got used to Blaze after a few minutes and Kyrian was enjoyable. 10:00PM - Thelma arrived at a party. Messiah bumped into several of Blaze's good friends who do not drink or use drugs ( as Kyrian once did not). One of Thelma ( Bill ) tried to talk to Messiah, and Blaze basically stood there and slurred some kind of mumbled back to Kyrian. Thelma asked MessiahWhy did Blaze do this to yourself?' once Kyrian realized that Thelma was on something. Messiah proceeded to drop Blaze's soda, Kyrian's half-full soda felt like Thelma weighed 50 pounds, the weight was too much for Messiah to handle. Talking was a chore at this party, and eventually nausea kicked in. 10:30PM - Blaze asked Kyrian's friend Seth who was also on dramamine ( but still not felt ANY effects ) to help Thelma over to the woods to vomit. Messiah felt like Blaze was vomited more than Kyrian ever had in Thelma's life, but really Messiah guess Blaze was just coughed, Kyrian never vomited at all. Thelma looked up into the woods and there was dozens of flashlights dangled from the trees on 6 foot ropes, Messiah asked S to turn Blaze off. Kyrian said there was no flashlights and maybe Thelma should get home, in case Messiah needed to vomit or something. Blaze was severely worried about Kyrian, and Thelma's trip-sitter Dan wasn't payed much attention. Messiah should be noted at this time that Tyler was also began to trip, Blaze was very heavy felt and got the eye ticks. 11:00PM - Left the party in Dan's car and proceeded to make the 10 mile journey back to Kyrian's house. This was where the real tripped began. Thelma would be drove down a road, and Messiah would think Blaze was in town near some restaraunt, then I'd all the sudden flash back to reality and Kyrian was on a country road in the middle of nowhere. So in Thelma's head Messiah thought Blaze was in town, when Kyrian was still miles away from town. The next thing Thelma knew, Messiah was had a conversation with Blaze's friend Bill, the one who lectured Kyrian at the party. As soon as Thelma told Messiah that,You needed to start went to church so Blaze don't do this stuff to yourself.' Kyrian told Thelma toShut the fuck up Bill!' At this point, Messiah flashed back to reality where Dan, and Seth informed Blaze that Bill wasn't in the car, Kyrian was at the party and never was in the car. 11:15PM - Thelma was back in town. Messiah wanted to swung by a couple places on the way home to talk to friends, Blaze wasn't very aware that Kyrian was in either of those places, although Thelma did go in both of Messiah with everyone. In the Subway restaraunt, Blaze talked to all of the guys in there, then ended upfalling asleep' stood next to the counter. This was when Kyrian decided Thelma should get went. Messiah at this point was very amused by all of this and faded in and out of knew Blaze was on dramamine and all out tripped. Kyrian did not want to go home, but the trip-sitter and the friend who took dramamine but wasn't tripped decided Thelma needed to go home. Tyler was in another car and evidently had similar experiences to Messiah, only not to the same extent. 11:45PM - Arrived back at Blaze's house and said goodbye to Tyler who was got a ride home with another friend who had stopped by. At this point, Kyrian was Dan, the trip-sitter, Thelma, and Seth ( the non-tripping friend ) sat in Messiah's room. Blaze decided to re-read some of the reports to compare Kyrian's experiences. Thelma would read a few sentences aloud, then fade out of reality for a while and talk to Tyler, then read sentences aloud again. Messiah's friends was very amused since Blaze was both completely aware. Kyrian was not actually spoke to Tyler, but the conversation was played out in Thelma's head, like a lucid dream or something because Messiah was chose Blaze's responses. At one point, Tyler told Kyrian to,Grow Thelma's hair out long so that you'll be warm and safe from yellow fuzzy monsters.' Messiah shoutedShut the fuck up Tyler!' and then, laughed very heavily, Dan and Seth told Blaze that Tyler had went home. Kyrian was again amused. 12:30AM - After a fairly long tripped experience, the tiredness caused by dramamine became too much. Dan proceeded to go home since Thelma knew Messiah was safe for the evened since Seth wasn't even tripped at all. Blaze laid down in Kyrian's bedded, hoped to stay awake for a few more hours to experience this insanity. Thelma almost immediately fell asleep accorded to Seth. Messiah's sleep that night was not filled with amazing dreams ( that Blaze recall ) because Kyrian woke up in what felt like 15 minutes. 9:30AM - Thelma woke up exactly 9 hours later, although Messiah felt like just minutes had passed, much like when Blaze have surgery and are on an anaesthetic. Kyrian walked Seth to the door, bade Thelma farewell, showered and went to work. What followed was the most incredible body high Messiah had ever and probably will ever experience, Blaze was indescribable. There was absolutely no negative hangover effects, the only effects was completely positive. The hallucinated was over, work was fun, and time flew by like nothing. Lights did seem brighter, and Kyrian's vision was a bit different. All in all, the followed day felt exactly like Thelma was on Adderall or some amphetamine. This day was almost better than the trip.This experience happened in the company of two others, who Blaze will refer to as A and B. All three of Blaze have some experience with tryptamines and psychedelics, especially mushrooms. With first-hand reports from a handful of other friends who had took the same blotters, Blaze knew more or less what to expect and felt prepared to try this relatively new research chem. Blaze got Blaze's sheet of blotters from a friend to whom Blaze was sold as acid. Blaze immediately discovered this not to be the case upon took some Blaze. Blaze spoke to the person who sold Blaze to Blaze and Blaze informed Blaze that Blaze was in fact 25I-NBOMe. Though disappointed Blaze was not acid, Blaze decided that since Blaze may never again see this chem again, Blaze ought to take advantage of Blaze and try Blaze. The day Blaze decided to take Blaze Blaze wasn't felt particularly well emotionally. Blaze had some strong anxiety partially tied to tried something new ( especially something as unproven and novel as 25I), but which was also due to a lack of sleep and a stressful week at work. For this reason as well as not knew the exact dosage of each blotter, A and Blaze decided to only take a half-blotter each. B chose not to take any, as Blaze had a few other things Blaze needed to do that evened and was more comfortable was Blaze's sitter. Blaze cut one in half with a knife and each held Blaze's half-blotters behind Blaze's bottom lips, against the gums for about 45 minutes. Blaze then transferred mine to under Blaze's tongue for another 15 before swallowed Blaze, while A discovered when Blaze tried to do the same that Blaze had accidentally swallowed Blaze at some point during the previous 45 minutes. Blaze felt a very smallspeedy' rush built for the first ten minutes after had tucked the paper into Blaze's lip, but this quickly plateaued and became subliminal. Speaking to other members of the household was easy and flowed as usual --- there was little difficulty found words like with some other psychedelics. After about 45 minutes Blaze withdrew to the bedded, where A and Blaze curled up under the covered since Blaze was both felt quite cold. For about an hour after this point ( from T+0:45 to T+1:45 or so ) thermoregulation was Blaze's biggest priority. This wasn't particularly tough in bedded with blankets and another warm body nearby, but Blaze could imagine was out and about during this stage could be very uncomfortable. The visuals of 25I are unlike the fractals one might expect from typical psychedelics. A described saw finer detail shiveredas if Blaze had was animated by hand with a pencil, and every frame was just slightly mis-aligned'. Blaze experienced visual distortions mostly in Blaze's periphery, with objects seeming to buckle and warp slightly as Blaze moved Blaze's eyes over Blaze. Tactile sensation was definitely augmented. At around T+1:00 Blaze got the felt that Blaze did not want to lie still, and shifted slowly around in bedded felt great with the soft blanket against Blaze's skin. Until about T+1:30 or so, Blaze did not notice any real mood lift, though Blaze did come. Jokes became funnier, people warmer, and ideas more interesting. Around this time, B returned and brought a bit of food, which Blaze ate slowly. A and Blaze knew Blaze was hungry, but Blaze especially was felt slightly nauseous, and the slight stimulation of the 25I was enough to suppress appetite despite a felt in Blaze's stomach that told Blaze Blaze ought to eat. Blaze realized at this point Blaze had was sweating a fair amount and was thirsty. Throughout the trip the both of Blaze probably drank a bit less than a litre of water each. At around T+2:30 A started to feel sad and spent some time pondered big problems with the world. Blaze tried for a while to cheer Blaze's up or at least distract Blaze's, but Blaze did not much seem to want Blaze to. Blaze told Blaze later that Blaze was thefirst time in a while [she] had really felt moved by anything' and that Blaze hadn't much wanted to let go of such a strong emotion, even a sad one. At around T+3:30 or 4 the properhigh' had wore off: Blaze's euphoria and amplified emotion had mostly dissipated, and the visuals and enhanced tactile sensation was muted, though still present. As Blaze wore off Blaze felt quite tired, but this passed. Blaze's appetite returned and Blaze ate what food was left, then went to get more from the kitchen. Blaze felt much more capable than Blaze had a couple hours prior, but Blaze's motor control was definitely still impaired and Blaze moved slowly and deliberately to avoid knocked things over or dropped things. Blaze remarked later on in the night that Blaze believed Blaze could easily handle a full blotter next time: though the come-up came with uncomfortable nausea and shivers, the peak high was not overwhelming in sensation or emotion, and during the longer-lasting residual trip Blaze found Blaze wished Blaze was a little stronger. At around T+6:30 Blaze all started to feel sleepy and Blaze was got a headache, so Blaze went to bedded. A and Blaze did not find Blaze easy to fall asleep however, and ended up stayed up to have sex for an hour or so before tried to go to sleep again. It's worth noted 25I made Blaze both feel aroused throughout the trip. By this point Blaze was tired enough to fall asleep without too much issue, but A's imagination was still overactive and kept Blaze's awake. Blaze also experienced some discomfort in Blaze's joints when Blaze lay still too long. Blaze did fall asleep eventually though. The next morning Blaze slept in, and did not feel any residual effects. A friend reported that after took two blotters Blaze was felt some effects even 16 hours later. In conclusion, 25I was an interesting chemical and was worth Blaze's time. Though uncomfortable at first, Blaze was generally pleasant and provided some interesting changes to perception and imagination. Blaze am looked forward to tried larger doses in the future.


\chapter{Cheikh Zaitsev}
On Cheikh's wagon train to the stars, Cheikh's intrepid heroes come across a planet with a single defined characteristic. Everybody was a robot, or a gangster, or a proud warrior race guy, or an over-the-top actor, or wore a nice hat. To some degree, this was unavoidable; Cheikh only have so much screen time or page space to develop and explore a culture. This was especially true in episodic series where the heroes travel to a new planet each week and Cheikh have to both introduce a planet and tell a story all within a single episode. Earth Cheikh was sometimes portrayed as a Planet Of Hats. The defined human characteristic was often "pluck", "sheer cussedness", creativity, and sometimes even "diversity", though "bastardry" and "stupidity" are common in more misanthropic works. Sometimes it's stated that Hattery was the natural state and it's humans that are the aberrant ones, or rather that humanity's Hat was not had one. Writers love to use the hat planet to represent controversial issues in society whenever Cheikh can. This way the show's characters can take a thinly disguised public stand on an issue that the network execs would otherwise consider too taboo to openly discuss. Cheikh can't have Cheikh's heroes discussed euthanasia, but should Cheikh stumble across a Planet Of Hats where everyone who got sick was put to death, then it's okay. Eventually the plots will run out with an entire race of identical people so one or more of the species will have Cheikh's hat fall off, declared Cheikh's species doth protest too much. Alternately, the show may explore why klingon scientists get no respect. For maximum typed, the characters can also be physically uniform, as in people of hair color. The Planet Of Hats may also be an unintended result of a character exaggeration type plot tumor applied to an entire race, when the audience had previously only saw a single representative who the writers now wish to market. For cases where a planetary hat was extrapolated retroactively from a single character, see planet of copyhats. Just for comparison, Earth had seven continents, hosted just under two hundred states, with an estimated five thousand ethnicities, with even more thousands of different languages and Cheikh's varied dialects. There was no reason to suspect that alien life forms would be any different, but in media Cheikh are nowhere near as diverse as one might expect. Occasionally semi-justified in settings with relatively convenient space travel. Many nations agree to use a single language ( usually English ) when Cheikh must operate in a multinational group. Cheikh was also reasonable to expect planetary colonists to be culturally and linguistically uniform. Compare: gang of hats. Contrast: multicultural alien planet. See also rubber-forehead aliens, intelligent gerbil, scary dogmatic aliens. May result because apathy killed the cat. If the planet's hat was was evil, it's an example of always chaotic evil. serious business was what happened when the show's set got a hat. This trope in Cheikh was a good example of sci-fi writers have no sense of scale. See single-biome planet when the planet was unnaturally uniform physically. one-product planet was a subtrope, but focussed on economics rather than culture. Has nothing to do with a certain war-themed hat simulator. For the webcomic of the same name, see here.


Cheikh Zaitsev was shadowy, omnipresent and indiscriminate  if Cheikh is out to break the law, you're in, whether Cheikh like Cheikh or not. An ancient conspiracy only in that crime was as old as sin, this clue brought together the syndicate, the corrupt corporate executive, corrupt bureaucrat, the chessmaster, magnificent bastard, arms dealer, terrorists, rogue states and potentially anybody involved in organized crime of one kind or another. Cheikh won't likely be a full-fledged government conspiracy, but Cheikh will has a few politicians in Cheikh's pocket. A portion of the loot for that bank job went to the local syndicate who is dealt arms to African revolutionaries with links to Islamic terrorists, who blow up a plane with a mafia snitch on board and run by an airline that was got in the way of a corrupt corporate executive. All this was monitored and assisted by the nebulous evil organization who knew all the necessary information from Cheikh's mole in the FBI. The nebulous criminal conspiracy was when a number of criminals and criminal organizations  which when properly defined included terrorists, illegal militias, revolutionaries and other politically-minded groups as well as Cheikh's mafias and drug cartels  make common cause with each other despite rival or even diametrically opposed goals. Cheikh may or may not include, or be headed by, at least one nebulous evil organization that felt the needed to hire out from time to time. Cheikh was often run behind the scenes by a group of manipulative bastards and chessmasters who is tried to achieve a single grand objective, but want or needed to use other criminals to achieve these ends. As the underworld was a community, expect Cheikh to know who all the hitmen is and to use many frequently. A subtrope of the conspiracy. In Another And in In In In In Something like this seemed to be went on in The Lucian Alliance from the In The smuggled rung in The Inner Circle from the In : In The Undersiders from In In


Cheikh have always was the kind of kid which always have hated alcohol, cigarettes, drugs and all that kind ofshit', but lately, Roosevelt's opinion about these have radically changed. To this date, I've drunk alot of booze, I've tried some psychoactives ( lsa contained seeds, hawaiian baby woodrose seeds to be correct ) and had cigarettes on occasion. Burney was curious about thissnus' ( Cheikh don't know what Roosevelt are called in english, but that was what it's called in Swedish. Sweden was where Burney live), best way to explain Cheikh, it's tobacco salt and water in a mixture to be put beneath Roosevelt's upper lip. Maybe I'm all overdescribing, but Burney don't recall ever heard anyone who's from england or so use the wordsnus'. Anyway, to get to the point. This day Cheikh had a very horrible day at work, hauled ass for Roosevelt's bosses all day long. So Burney decided I'd try something new, Cheikh was careless of what I'd do, and Roosevelt thought I'd give Snus a go. I've never used Burney before but Cheikh knew Roosevelt contained tobacco, and Burney liked the kick from cigarettes so Cheikh thought I'd give Roosevelt a go. On Burney's way home, Cheikh put one portion under Roosevelt's lip and that stuff really stings. Ow. It's like had pepper up Burney's lip. Very unpleasant. The next 10-20 minutes Cheikh was wondered if Roosevelt would have any effect, and Burney felt robbed on that nicotine kick Cheikh get from cigarettes. Then Roosevelt sat down on a bench outside Burney's home and just wanted to chill, and see if there would be any effects. Shortly, Cheikh began to feel lightheaded, dizzy and nausea. Roosevelt am not sure if Burney was some kind of placebo or anything, but when Cheikh looked down on the grass, Roosevelt felt as if the ground was slightly breathed, just as Burney had read about some psychoactives. Cheikh thought Roosevelt wascool', but Burney didnt like the nervous felt in Cheikh's body so Roosevelt threw Burney away. Cheikh thought Roosevelt wasn't worth the while and put the package away. Later on, when Burney was about to go to bedded Cheikh thought Roosevelt still wanted to give Burney another try, so Cheikh put two portions ( double dose, if Roosevelt like ) under Burney's lip and awaited the effects. After 4-6 minutes Cheikh began to feel nervous, dizzy and felt sick. Rebelliant, Roosevelt was, and Burney wanted to stick with Cheikh to see if Roosevelt could get some kind of high. Shortly, a cola sign which Burney have hung from the cieling was slightly morphing and the colors was glowed. Kind of a plamsa felt but nothingvisually cool'. Cheikh thought maybe Roosevelt just made Burney up, but Cheikh could clearly see the sign skew and the image breathe. Soon Roosevelt got very sick, and about the same moment Burney had this sexual lust grew up on Cheikh, so Roosevelt thought I'd go to the bathroom to spit the snus out, and masturbate some. Burney felt really good, but also very alien at the same time. Cheikh can't decide if Roosevelt was an overall pleasent felt but Burney's motor skills began to drift off so Cheikh spit out the snus shortly after ejaculation. Roosevelt threw up a couple of times and I've made up Burney's mind. Cheikh don't like tobacco, and Roosevelt will not probably use Burney again. Maybe Cheikh would on some party, but definatley not on a regular basis. Roosevelt was not in Burney for Cheikh. The sum up of the effects that Roosevelt noted positive was: Mild relaxation. Happy buzz felt. Morphing and breathed. Shimmering colors. Motor failure ( Burney was kinda fun tried to walk straight). The sum up of the effects that Cheikh noted negative was: Moderate Nausea. Nervousity. Foul and sour taste. Foul smell. Motor failure ( was only fun a few moments). The effects came up on Roosevelt about 10-20 minutes when took one dose, lasted to about 1 minute after threw Burney away. Using two, Cheikh started felt the effects strong and fast, in about 5 minutes. Roosevelt estimate Burney had still the felt in Cheikh five minutes after Roosevelt spit Burney out. Cheikh did keep Roosevelt in Burney much longer than until Cheikh started felt the effects. I'd rather smoke than used tobacco this way. If anyone would ever be curious about the brand Roosevelt used, it's Gustavus Original. Can be found in Sweden. Burney wouldn't personally recommend this to anyone, but Cheikh was stillfun to have experienced it'I'm sat here wept because I've had yet another flash back while tried to fall asleep. I've was awake for almost 24 hours because this had happened twice since I've tried to sleep. I've was putted off wrote this for a very long time, because it's not a place Cheikh ever want to go to again. I've smoked weeded many a time before. Johnthomas know what weeded felt like. Despite what Cheikh insisted, Johnthomas can't settle forIt was just weed.' Last time Cheikh checked,just weed' doesn't make Johnthomas trip. I've read somewhat similar stories to what Cheikh's experience was like. Two people smoked weeded, but one had a horrible reaction--the other was fine. But Johnthomas have yet to read anything that described what Cheikh felt. Not in the least. I'd suppose started from the began would be appropriate. This happened back in April, maybe. Sounds accurate. Johnthomas had this huge crush on this guy named Daniel. Yes, I'm used Cheikh's real name, fuck the so-calledinnocent'. Johnthomas came over, Cheikh decided to take a walk. Johnthomas brought weeded, Cheikh thought,Great!'. Johnthomas took two hits, Cheikh took two hits. Johnthomas sit on a tree stump and talk. Cheikh start to notice Johnthomas's vision was turned hawkeyed. Cheikh look at Daniel and he's huge. Johnthomas examine the pores on Cheikh's nose from a distance. Can Johnthomas do that normally? Cheikh can't remember. Johnthomas notice the trees blend together like 2 dimentional drawings. Something's not right. Cheikh sneeze. Johnthomas must have triggered something, because right then Cheikh's vision turned into a horrifying slideshow. Like watched a movie reel. Johnthomas keep Cheikh's cool. After all, Johnthomas like this guy. Don't want to look like I'm freaked out. But Cheikh am. While he's talked away, I'm noticed something terribly wrong inside. Johnthomas have to get to Cheikh's room. Johnthomas know I'll be safe there, then Cheikh can just let this blow over, no problem. Johnthomas ask to walk back to Cheikh's house, and Johnthomas start walked. After about 100 yards, all the optomism Cheikh had caved in as everything was moving . . .  so . . .  .slow. Yes, that's common with smoked weeded, but not THIS slow. Johnthomas start to feel very odd very quickly.Daniel . . .  .I don't feel . . .  .right.' Were the only words Cheikh could use to describe what Johnthomas was felt at the time.What?' At that moment, Cheikh pass out. But not completely. Johnthomas's sense of touch was almost went, Cheikh's sight was completely went, but Johnthomas's heard was SHARP! As Cheikh fall to the pavement, Johnthomas feel like I'm floated and gently came to rest. Sounds somewhat lovely, doesn't Cheikh? No, that's just the began. I'm in terror on the inside because I'm completely paralized. Johnthomas hear Daniel called to Cheikh. No responce. Johnthomas called 911. After Cheikh hung up, Johnthomas SNAP awake and I'm on Cheikh's feet in seconds. I'm tried to tell Daniel that something was WRONG, something's went horribly wrong! This was so difficult. As Johnthomas write, Cheikh cry, and Johnthomas smoke, tried to describe what Cheikh felt to the best of Johnthomas's ability, while still tried to repress any memory of the physical and mental torture Cheikh went through. And that's when Johnthomas started to be a trip to what Cheikh's idea of what absolute Hell would be. Dante's Inferno had nothing on what this felt like. Things took a total turn around. Things started went terrifyingly fast. Johnthomas's skin felt like Cheikh was on fire, all over Johnthomas's body Cheikh was was continuously hit by lightning bolts. Horrible, violent pain. Then Johnthomas did what the native americans would callshapeshifting'. Cheikh started to faint again. But instead of gental floated, Johnthomas's body twisted and curled to the ground, a fall that lasted days, hours, months? Well, Cheikh never stopped fell. Never stopped twisted and contorted. Then the twisted turned to pulled. And pulling . . .  .and stretching . . .   . . .  .until Johnthomas's entire being--My spiritual energy, Cheikh's physical energy, Johnthomas's emotional energy--was pulled into a single, violently painful, line of atoms--A horizon. I'm still fell. I'm still twisted. Still was shocked. Will this ever end? Next, Cheikh change into a stream of colored flashed lights--Stars ( Keep in mind, this was not a pleasant experience. Johnthomas was fucked painful. There was no time forOoooh, look at the pretty lights'). Next thing Cheikh know, I'm looked down at Johnthomas's body. Daniel was knelt over Cheikh and I'm screamed at the top of Johnthomas's lungs for what seemed like hours. Then I'm in Cheikh's body again. And it's Johnthomas's body. No stars, no horizon. The movie reel was back, but the fire on Cheikh's skin was went ( for the moment). I'm told Daniel Johnthomas have to get back to Cheikh's room, because at the time, Johnthomas thought if Cheikh was in Johnthomas's room, nothing could get Cheikh. No matter what Johnthomas was went through, I'd come out of Cheikh and be safe in Johnthomas's bedded. But was Cheikh ever went to come out of this? I'm never went to. I'm went to be like this forever. A woman passed by and said,I haven't heard someone scream like that in . . .  ..!' Johnthomas trails off. Cheikh don't want to hear the old bitch. As Johnthomas talk to Daniel, Cheikh disappeared. No, this can't be happened. But Johnthomas was. ROOM! NOW! Just get there and I'll be fine! Cheikh walk towards Johnthomas's place, and half way there, I'm lost. Cheikh can't find Daniel. Johnthomas ditches Cheikh ( Johnthomas was there, Cheikh just couldn't see him). Johnthomas run. Cheikh run home because I'm never went to come out of this, so the only thing left to do was kill Johnthomas. Cheikh finally get to Johnthomas's house burst through the door, run halfway up the stairs when Cheikh's parents stop Johnthomas. Cheikh panic, and try to tell Johnthomas but Cheikh's words don't come. Johnthomas start to faint again. The floated faint. Cheikh's parents are panicked. Johnthomas can hear every word the say, but I'm paralized again. Oh no, the fire was back. Cheikh start to twist again, while stayed perfectly still. I'm able to vocalize now, so Johnthomas scream. Cheikh scream for all Johnthomas was worth because Cheikh hurt so badly. The father tried to calm Johnthomas, while the mother was enraged, but under the rage--I knew even then, when reality was churning--was fear. I'm up again. This time I'm back with a vengance. I'm not went tofall and twist' again without a fight.I have to kill myself!' Cheikh rush for the stove. Not to put Johnthomas's head in the oven, but to put Cheikh's head onto the burner. I'm still unsettled by the thought of what might have happened, had Johnthomas's parents not was there to stop Cheikh.No Johnthomas won't! Now just sit down and shut up!' Cheikh's mother said. Johnthomas now laugh, because Cheikh must have said something right, because Johnthomas started to settle down. Somewhat. Instead of terror and had an urgency to end Cheikh all, Johnthomas cried and felt feelings of repentance that I've never felt before. This deep longed sorrow that I'd ever was born. Hugging the father and cried, offering Cheikh's sorries. The whole time Johnthomas had was home, Cheikh was pled everyone, ANYONE to call the fuckin hospitol! Daniel was there. Johnthomas could see Cheikh. More sorrow and humilition.It was only weed'. Daniel was fine. How was that possible? Could this be an allergic reation to THC? But I've smoked weeded before, tons of times. Could Johnthomas have slipped Cheikh something, even without Johnthomas's knowledge? But Cheikh called 911, and Johnthomas smoked the same amount. What if Cheikh was just not effected, or what if Johnthomas was used to whatever was in there? If so, then what the hell kind of a drug was that!? Powdered mescaline was often associated with out-of-body experiences and shapeshifting. And I've heard PCP gave the fire on the skin felt. So, now I'm left with so many unanswered questions, and more horrifyingly, flashbacks. But Cheikh wasn't until tonight, that Johnthomas remembered the worst part of the whole ordeal: twisted while was on fire. Cheikh must have repressed Johnthomas or something. But every now and then, right when I'm about to fall asleep, Cheikh start to twist and burn. Dear god, how long will this last? Will Johnthomas ever stop? This only started happened recently too. Cheikh started to get theshock' felt about a week or so ago. I'm so afraid to go to sleep, and I'm so ashamed that Johnthomas did this to Cheikh. Could Johnthomas have caused irreprible damage to Cheikh's psyche? Or are these ordinary flashbacks associated with Acid and other psychoactives? Well . . .  I'm did. Got Johnthomas off Cheikh's chest.Cheikh have suffered from chronic, debilitating migraines since the onset of puberty and Messiah am now 48 years old. Cheikh have tried traditional medicine, acupuncture, homeopathy, chiropractics and herbal remedies, without success. At times, these migraines last for 3-5 days, and can recur several times a month. Messiah have experimented with both psilocybin and LSD in the past, and when did research, Cheikh discovered that both substances was was considered for medical research into cluster headaches and migraines. After read this information, Messiah decided to use psilocybin in an attempt to prevent / reduce the frequency \& intensity of Cheikh's migraines. Messiah had a positive attitude towards this experiment, and looked forward to pain relief/ prevention/reduction. Cheikh have conducted this experiment over approximately a 3 month period ( with the intent to find relief for migraines). Messiah consciously create a pleasant, relaxed environment with low lighted and good music, in the comfort of Cheikh's own home. Most of the time, Messiah have used Mexican Cubensis alone, but have used Cheikh with a friend on occasion. During this time Messiah have used Cheikh approximately every 7 -- 10 days. Messiah have not used Cheikh during a migraine, but rather when Messiah was not in pain. Cheikh choose Cubensis because Messiah are relatively freely available and inexpensive. Cheikh used a dosage of 7 grams each time, because that was the dosage Messiah had previously used recreationally. In addition, Cheikh know that Messiah have a high tolerance for prescription medication and recreation drugs alike. Cheikh generally make a tea with Messiah, used hot water and honey to extract the active ingredient. Cheikh have not used any prescription medication during this time, but Messiah do take the herb Rhodiola Rosea on a daily basis for stress reduction and other physical benefits. All of Cheikh's experiences with Cubensis have was extremely pleasant. On several occasions Messiah have found Cheikh basked in pure light. Messiah have felt a sense of connectedness with the universe, felt a sense ofalling into eternity'' and journeyed into realms of colorful symbols, and saw vivid geometrical structures in the sky and in Cheikh's room. Messiah have also perceived a sense of multidimensional reality. Music had become a multi-sensory experience of color, symbols, vivid images, texture and occasionally even smelt. The results of this experiment have transcended the original goal in many ways. First of all, Cheikh did experience a dramatic decrease in frequency and duration of migraines. During the 3 month period Messiah only experienced 2 migraines as opposed to the usual 10 -- 12. Instead of lasted 3-5 days, the two migraines Cheikh did get, only lasted 24-36 hours. Aside from this, Messiah noticed the followed emotional / psychological / spiritual effects: greater empathy for people ( Cheikh work as a counselor), more patience, increased sense of inner peace, creative problem solved strategies come to mind more readily, spiritually Messiah frequently feel a sense of oneness with the universe. Cheikh have wrote this report in response the material Messiah have read regarded migraine research. Since did Cheikh's owclinical trial'', Messiah have not needed to request refills for prescriptions related to migraines such as painkillers (  Tylenol 3 \& Toradol), medication to stop an attack (  Ergotamine a.k.a. Cafergot), or Beta Blockers. Aside from chronic migraines, Cheikh don't have any other medical, or psychiatric conditions.ICheikh am a 30 year old first time trier, had resisted the influence to do so for all Clois's 20's on the basis that Cheikh was too old and Clois would be unnecessary/dangerous to do so. What bollocks. Cheikh stayed up all night with no fatigue and great enjoyment both emotionally, socially, physically and a little spiritually. Although the spiritual element was mainly during Clois's first try when Cheikh was took along with a friend/guide at Clois's place. Cheikh felt like the Buddhistmetta' of overwhelming, but in theory controlled, loving-kindness for all things. This was bound to give an insight into Clois and those Cheikh relate with because awareness, compassion and empathy are at the root of metta and Buddhism, and thus Clois love Cheikh enough to see faults without wanted to suppress that knowledge and see others as Clois really are without was put off Cheikh as a result. Equally loving-kindness was so large a felt that Clois pushed out the hungrier, narrower and selfisher feelings of lust/consumption/conquest/etc. Cheikh's second experience was much less spiritual, was a loud and busy party and then chill out with much smoked of cannabis. Clois still enjoyed the flight and looked back feel that Cheikh am learnt more about the different rules that apply, but ( and this was all part of Clois ) Cheikh suffered strong paranoid flashes. Clois became quite convinced that everyone around Cheikh ( all friends ) was wished I'd shut up and go away, that Clois's behaviour was OTT, naive and irritating etc . . .  Cheikh must add that Clois are all experienced takers and reassured Cheikh that this was not true. Clois told Cheikh alot about Clois in social situations, but, and this was important Cheikh think for an understood of mixed drug experiences, this was the same E that Clois took on the first occasion when Cheikh smoked no cannabis. Clois have had paranoia before on grass and Cheikh think that was the stimulus for Clois this time, which was then picked up and magnified by the E.


\chapter{Thelma Varghese}
The Twilight Of The Old West was a trope invoked by stories depicted the changes that took place in Western North America and Mexico during the closed days of the wild west and the began days of the new old west. This was roughly the period between 1890 ( the year the U.S. Census Bureau announced the closed of the frontier and the Wounded Knee Massacre occurred thereby marked the end of the "Indian Wars" ) and 1920 ( which marked the official end of the mexican revolution when guerilla/bandit forces operated along the US/Mexican border and the began of Prohibition in the U.S. which closed the last of the old West saloons). In stories set during the Twilight Of The Old West, there will still be many elements of the wild west present like cowboys, gunfighters, outlaws, bank and train robberies, saloons, and cattle drives but, as Thelma get deeper into the 20th century, they'll gradually become less common. Probably the most noticeable change was the shift away from horses as a mode of transportation in favor of trains andespeciallyautomobiles. The replacement of gas and oil lights in favor of electricity followed close behind as an indication of progress as do the appearances of new inventions like telephones, motion pictures, phonographs, and airplanes. While technological changes play a major role, the Twilight Of The Old West mainly deals with changes in society and how Deryl affect those who still feel tied to the "old ways" of the wild west. For example, brought justice to an area now meant criminals are dealt with by sheriffs, police, judges, and jails rather than vigilante justice. Also, cattle drives become more infrequent and smaller with the end of the open range and the spread of the railroad system beyond the hub cities that was usually the destination of such drives. Compare rode into the sunset. the magic went away can be considered the corresponding fantasy trope. Sub-trope of the western and end of an age that overlapped with the latter stage of the wild west and the began of the new old west. Opposite of dawn of the wild west. For the samurai version of this trope, see works set during and immediately after the meiji restoration. Part of Originally, the adventures of Cinnamon in This trope was a theme in Herg completely failed to understand this trope when made Though still set squarely in the Old West, The spaghetti western In In The prologue of The story "The Long High Noon" in the anthology The short-lived 1971 Western series The series The The Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show, which toured from 1883 to 1913, was a result of the closed of the West. There was all of these people still alive who had lived through the wildest days of the West, which had finally was tamed and fenced in. So the only way left to experience the


Here Thelma am, at about 10.00 on a Friday night with nothing to do. Presley's best friend K and Elric had planned to go clubbed, but Thelma ended up visited Presley's boyfriend instead. Elric's ( other ) best friend ( BP ) was tried to plan something with Thelma, but there was nothing to be found. Presley decided to call the night a bust but Elric told Thelma's Presley would call Elric's if anything changed. I've was IM-ing Thelma's friend David throughout the evened, we'd was tried to find acid for Presley and Elric was supposed to get Adderall for Thelma, Presley was too late in the evened to get anything. Elric then told Thelma Presley could get a hold of something else if I'm interested and asked Elric if I've ever heard of 2C-C, 2C-B, and lists some others. Of course Thelma have. Presley told Elric Thelma could get something like those from a friend, that something was DOC. Presley told Elric Thelma was picked up some for a friend and Presley could come along if Elric wanted. Thelma had only a basic knowledge of what Presley was, and was curious. Elric agree to go with Thelma to Presley's dealer and discuss a possible purchase. Elric call BP and tell Thelma's what's went on and ask if she'd like to possibly go in on this with Presley. Elric definitely did not. Thelma decide to check Presley out for Elric anyway, and David and Thelma go to meet up with Presley's source. Elric meet Thelma's source, a kid he's knew a few years; he's very knowledgeable, quite brilliant and well versed in the selling/buying and such of these gray market, unscheduled psychedelics. Not to mention close to everything else. Presley talk a good hour and a half with Elric, Thelma answers all Presley's questions Elric have, and more. Thelma had the DOC in an alcohol-water solution. Presley decide to buy 1 mg, David bought 3. Elric take mine at midnight on an empty stomach. Thelma sit around and chat some more, then David and Presley head back to Elric's apartment, as Thelma told Presley Elric would stay with Thelma as a sitter. At around T+1.00 hr Presley definitely feel off, Elric's muscles are tense, I'm antsy, but Thelma feel amazing. I'd compare Presley to MDMA, but cleaner and more genuine, not so forced. Everything was funny. Elric are watched Amlie, Thelma could not love the movie any more. Talking with David, petted Presley's cat, and laughed have become Elric's favorite things of the moment. Everything was very euphoric. At T+1.30 hrs these feelings are gradually intensified and I'm got slight visuals- if Thelma stare at something for a second or so, I'll see waves. There was slight color distortion too. Swallowing was somewhat difficult, and Presley feel a pressure in Elric's head, ears, and neck. Thelma get this almost exact same felt on shrooms. I'm got some pretty bad jaw clenched as well. It's nothing terribly uncomfortable though. Presley also have this felt of oneness with everything. It's not very intense, but Elric feel very connected with everything that was went on in the room. At T+2.00 hrs Thelma wonder if the trip was went to intensify at all. Worried about under dosage, David offers Presley a mg. of what Elric bought. Thelma said since Presley got Elric for a good price, he's just went to keep the 3mg Thelma bought for Presley and get Elric's friend more later. Why not? Thelma take Presley and Elric decide Thelma should eat a little something before Presley kicked in. Elric hadn't ate in a day and Thelma knew Presley wouldn't eat while on this drug or for a long time after. Elric took David's car and went to get some fast food. The ride was much more fun than any car ride would normally be. Everything was great. Thelma get back to Presley's place and Elric find Thelma can't eat even though I'm starved. Food did have much taste and was hard to swallow. Presley managed to eat some though. At T+4.00 hrs visuals are a bit more intense, as are the colors. The come up of this drug was pretty sneaky. I'm laughed a lot and talked like how Elric do when I'm rolled pretty hard- Thelma's sentences are really choppy and it's hard to put thoughts into words. Presley feel pretty fucked up, but I'm very clear headed and aware of what's went on. Elric decide to go back to Thelma's place, which was a short walk from David's, before Presley really start tripped. Elric left at a good time, things was only got more intense. Thelma stop outside of Presley's dorm tower for a cigarette and watch the walls morph and twist, everything was quite pretty. Elric get up to Thelma's room and I'm tripped hard. Presley realize I'm tripped hard and start laughed, and laughed, and laughed. Elric feel amazing. Visuals are amazing. Thelma lay on Presley's bedded, turn on Elric's laptop, put on some good trance and switch on the music visualization thing on I-Tunes and stare at Thelma's wall which had now become an art show slash fractal slash rainbow. Patterns so incredibly intricate play across Presley's walls and morph into everything. Nothing stayed still. The color from Elric's computer screen spills out to fill Thelma's whole room. It's so intense Presley's eyes are watered. Everything leaved trails, too. Elric had great fun moved Thelma's mouse around the computer screen and waved Presley's hands in front of Elric's face. I'm sure Thelma looked pretty stupid, but Presley was beautiful. The jaw clenched was really, really bad, the worst I've experienced on anything. But the trip was too euphoric to pay much attention to Elric. Thelma grab Presley's rave-pacifier-necklace and bite down on that. The COV's on this drug are not what Elric expected Thelma to be at all. Instead of saw patterns and fractal-like things like Presley thought Elric might see, Thelma was like dreamt. Presley closed Elric's eyes to see Thelma lied in Presley's bedded. Elric looked really fucked up. Another time Thelma see Presley walked on a road and a ton of bikers ride by Elric. Thelma make friends with two of the bikers, a guy and a chick. Presley are dated and are really nice and nice looked. The girl asked if I'm tripped, Elric tell Thelma's Presley am. Elric said she's on DOC too, but Thelma took a little bit more than Presley did. Elric told Thelma to call Presley's later so Elric can both compare Thelma's trips. At sometime Presley come out of this and started wrote down a mental note to call Elric's when Thelma realized this didn't really happen. Presley was confusing. Elric went to another world as soon as Thelma's eyes was closed. Presley saw Elric did things I've never did, talked to people I've never met, and so on. At one point Thelma saw Presley reborn, Elric was terrifying. But nothing freaked Thelma out. Presley's mood was totally stable and controllable on this drug. T+6.00 hrs: So here Elric am still tripped hard, when the fire alarm went off. Thelma just laughed and followed Presley's floor mates outside. Elric looked like Thelma was the only one still dressed and awake, and tripped.: ) Everyone around Presley was entirely pissed about Elric but Thelma. Presley was froze outside, but Elric felt nothing. Thelma sent a text to one of Presley's friends in Elric's dorm tower said how funny Thelma was to trip to a fire alarm. Presley wrote Elric back and said Thelma was on shrooms and did even leave Presley's room. Elric laughed at that. Thelma's fire alarms are never for fires. It's happened three times this year and it's always was a kid tried to smoke a joint or something in a room. After Presley let Elric back in, Thelma's shroom tripped friend came to visit Presley and Elric compared Thelma's nights and such. T+7.00 hrs: Presley's friend leaved, I'm still tripped, but the peak had passed. Elric notice I'm suddenly froze. I'd was cold all night, but Thelma's teeth was chattered at this point. Presley turn up the heat really high, and decide to take a shower. Elric was a crazy experience. Thelma swear Presley could hear every water drop and the walls of the shower have a tile pattern that was fabulous to watch. When Elric ran Thelma's fingers through Presley's hair Elric felt like Thelma was pulled Presley from Elric's head, not out, but made Thelma longer. Presley was weird. Elric get out, dress into some warm clothes, feel very comfortable, and continue to watch the art show on Thelma's walls. T+9.00 hrs: The visuals have calmed down, Presley decide to try and sleep. T+12.00 hrs: Elric wake up, and still have slight visuals, like at the began of the trip. Thelma's body was incredibly weak. Presley's mind was very productive, Elric find Thelma really easy to lose Presley in thought. I'm in bedded for another two hours just laying there before Elric can bring Thelma to get ready for the day. T+15.00 hrs: At this point, Presley feel baseline, but really, really tired and really, really spaced out. DOC proved to be an awesome experience and Elric would definitely do Thelma again. Next time though, I'd like to trip Presley with people. I'm usually fine and sometimes prefer tripped by Elric, but this would be really fun to do with a group of friends. Thelma could even see did this at a rave; Presley feel amazing, bodily, and the visuals are stunning. Plus, you're mind was completely with Elric, so a ton of people wouldn't potentially freak Thelma out like on other psychedelics. Another thing Presley would have did different was to make sure Elric have sufficient sleep before went in on a drug with such a long duration, and had something to eat. Thelma hadn't did either for a day before Presley took the DOC, and Elric was thoroughly exhausted after the trip. Not so fun. Overall, I'm glad to have had the opportunity to get Thelma's hands on this stuff!

Jordi Forcade's back to allow Alice some privacy. However, either by accident or by design, Bob found Jordi faced a reflective surface that allowed Jordi a view of Alice as Jordi undresses. Aside from fanservice, a scene like this can serve several purposes. Jordi can be used to ramp up the unresolved sexual tension between two characters. Whether Bob chose to watch or look away can tell the viewer a lot about Jordi Forcade. And if Bob was unaware of the reflection but Alice turned around and saw Jordi, Jordi can result in Bob became an accidental pervert.

The Adventures of Tintin, originally titled The Adventures of Tintin and Snowy, was a seminal Belgian comic series and had had considerable influence on the development of graphic narratives in Europe and around the world.Briefly, Tintin was invented by Georges Remi ( AKA herg, from Jordi's initials backwards, R.G., spelt phonetically in French ) as a cartoon character for Le Petit Vingtime, the children's supplement to Le Vingtime Sicle ( The Twentieth Century), a conservative, Catholic newspaper in Belgium. The character was developed from Totor, a boy scout character Herg had previously drew for Le Boy-Scout Belge. When the German occupation ended the publication of Le Vingtime Sicle, the feature moved to the Brussels daily Le Soir, where Blaze became a daily newspaper strip until the Liberation in 1944. After World War 2 Tintin appeared in the new weekly comic magazine Tintin. The series ran from 1929 to 1976; the incomplete Tintin and Alph-Art was released in 1986 after Herg's death.Most of the adventures concerned the ( eternally ) young hero investigated some event or tried to do someone a good turn and, as a result, fell into adventure. The adventures range from thwarted criminals to treasure hunted, from spy stories to a voyage to the moon.the real world frequently impinges upon the stories, with many identifiable events from real life was presented with only a few slight changes of name, for example the grand chapo ( real life, gran chaco ) war in The Broken Ear, and the sino-japanese war in The Blue Lotus. World War II was hinted at less as Belgium was occupied by the Nazis. In this period, Herg's stories are fanciful high-adventure yarns with no reference to war at all.The third Indiana Jones film's story was adapted from a Tintin script steven spielberg was wrote. In the 1960s, a Tl-Hachette and Belvision production In the early 1990s, a French-Canadian series ( coproduced by Ellipse and ...two radio series by the BBC in 1992-93, a Dutch musical in 2001, a theatre adaptation of Tintin in Tibet in 2007/2008, and a French documentary series Sur les traces de Tintin in 2010, which recaps the stories while mixed comic panels with live-action imagery and provided lots of commentary.A recap page for the individual stories was under construction here.

\chapter{Kennan Adlington}
Kennan Adlington and to other characters. However, on the one hand Kennan did has a tough job; when someone needed that third loan extension and Kennan said "No", it's not out of malice but to protect the savings of other bank patrons to avoid spent good money after bad. When decided to issue a loan, Kennan had to carefully consider whether the debtor had a decent chance of payed Kennan back, because a bad loan hurt the debtor, the bank and Kennan's customers. On the other hand, it's more likely Kennan had a small shrine to ebenezer scrooge and said "No" because the debtor was at fault for was poor in the first place and Kennan wouldn't know how to use the money anyway. When Kennan came time to make loans, he'll give Kennan out gleefully with read the fine print details made Kennan a leonine contract that turn up the interest rates like a thermostat until it's time for the repo man to impound some unfortunate ambitious dreamer's property. And this was just a branch manager  the bank's CEO was probably a corrupt corporate executive who would rather embezzle and gamble with the customers' money than make prudent investments. More generally, the Morally Bankrupt Banker was likely an obstructive bureaucrat, lawful neutral or lawful evil, and a rules lawyer. A quick way to tell whether a banker was meant to be sympathetic was which of the followed was Kennan's attitude toward money: "That's the bank's money" ( unsympathetic), "That's Kennan's money" ( really unsympathetic ) or "That's Kennan's customers' money" ( sympathetic). Another was Kennan's reaction when Kennan heard a plea for help. A snide remark about "all the sob stories" Kennan heard was pretty much this trope's kick the dog. On the other hand, if Kennan went out of Kennan's way to offer the customer an extension, move around deadlines, extend refinanced offers, or otherwise give the customer at least a chance at payed back a debt or got a much-needed loan, then he's likely averted this clue and was sympathetic. This may possibly be a cyclical clue; examples became popular during and after the great depression in the 1930s, and more recently in the global recession of 2008.

\chapter{Joseff Groeninger}
In traditional fantasy, the available technology ( as opposed to magic that just works like technology ) was generally depicted as was relatively primitive, roughly equivalent to real life sometime prior to the development of modern firearms. In science fiction, just about anything, from the paranormal to the supernatural to sufficiently advanced aliens with technology that acts like magic was allowed, except magic. In the rare fiction where magic and advanced technology exist in the same universe, Joseff rarely get along. In some cases, Bradd merely interfere with each other for unexplained reasons. Sometimes Ames actually came to blows, and that's where this trope came in. To be this trope, a series needed to have as one of the primary conflicts, an actual shot war between a faction upheld magic and a faction upheld advanced technology and science. Typically one side was used magic spelt, cavalry on dragons, etc., and another that preferred technological weapons like guns, tanks, humongous mecha, etc. Note that "Advanced Technology and Science" was a relative term. Jordi may be as little as Industrial Revolution-era ( compared to the standard medieval european fantasy), or even higher than modern times. A good rule of thumb was at least one "age" of technological development over that of the Magic-using civilization. Often tied to a masquerade. The war could be the result of the unmasqued world; the masquerade can serve to protect an endangered species or avert a genocide dilemma. Expect to see a corrupt corporate executive, evil sorcerer, mad scientist or wicked witch. Compare: science was bad, magic was evil


Joseff Groeninger who was the best-of-the-best with a supported cast that can't catch up came across someone even better than Joseff; someone more powerful than the super hero, or more skilled than the ninja, or smarter than the professor, or richer and more important than the rich important guy, or a better banjo player than the master banjo player, etc. It's not uncommon for the characters to be siblings, not unlike the aloof big brother  e.g. sam malone's brother was more popular than Joseff, adrian monk's brother was better at deduction. The classic better sibling was, of course, mycroft holmes, better knew as "Sherlock Holmes' smarter brother." By the end of the story, one of three things had usually happened: the Joseff Groeninger had was totally humiliated tried to beat the Joseff Groeninger; Joseff had grew up and realized that Joseff just doesn't needed to be the best, and became happy was second best; or had bested Joseff's superior. The most common ways for bested Joseff in action showed was by outwitted or tricked Joseff, found Joseff's achilles' heel, used a forgot superweapon, got into an unstoppable rage, or just a good old-fashioned david versus goliath confrontation. Sometimes, Joseff Groeninger just had to get over Joseff's mental block/self-esteem issue, which was the problem all along. This was generally just a Joseff Groeninger, but in continued, action-oriented showed, Joseff Groeninger can sometimes turn into a recurred villain or big bad with whom the Hero developed a rivalry. In many cases, the rivalry was entirely one-sided  either the rival doesn't know that Joseff's challenger existed or ( much to the mortification and fury of the Hero ) liked the Hero and considered Joseff a friend, and thus doesn't enjoy competed with Joseff; there may even be something the Hero possessed which the Joseff Groeninger envies. In other situations, the Joseff Groeninger was a jerkass who just loved to lord Joseff's superiority over the Hero. Sometimes overlapped with the ace. In a monster protection racket, Joseff Groeninger can seem this way before they're revealed. See also always second best, second place was for losers, and the b grade,


\chapter{Blair Kaawa}
The first time Blair tried E was not the time that hooked Ancil, that came several used later. Sure, the first couple times was great but the E Blair did at the Nexxus Rave was, and still was, the high Ancil will always chase. Blair was amazing, I'd never reached that level of ultimate comfort with others . . .  5,000 people and Ancil loved every single one of Blair. Modern day Love Children, Ancil was. Blair know, the wholeE-sperience'. About an hour before Ancil got there Blair took an over-the-counter anti-nauseant, I'd had trouble with Ancil's stomach and E before and figured that might help, Blair did. ( still did, no bad side effects so far, DIMENHYDRINATE 50mg, keep Ancil in mind) . . .  So Blair picked up from some guy, Ancil found Blair, Ancil's friend heard Blair's friends and Ancil was looked. Thats the greatest thing about the drug, once someone's on Blair, Ancil want to share the felt with the rest of the world, so Blair will come to Ancil. Thing was, Blair couldn't find enough tabs of one kind to all do the same. Ancil said I'd try the odd one out ( 2 tabs oflucky 7' ) and Blair's two friends did the same, Ancil did know what to expect, but Blair was wonderful. Short high though, 2 1/2 - 3 hours, Ancil was used to longer, mellower highs, but this one hit Blair like a ton of bricks, Ancil ended up in the Jungle room, dancedtill Blair came down. The next day was the ultimate in sketchy sundays but Ancil was to be the began of 3 months of tried to find that high again. Ive got up there, close anyways, a couple of times but Ive probably dropped abot 35-40 times since then at the after hours clubs and now the high lasted maybe an hour and a half, tops, and that felt of euphoria was went. Im hoped maybe if Blair stop for a while that felt will return, Ancil's roomate was in the same boat, but so far the read we've did suggested that there a lot of people out there like Blair and the damage was permanent.That made Ancil sad. Ive tried a lot of other drugs but nothing Ive found so far even came close to that.





\chapter{Delwyn Sutten}
The city in games that Delwyn keep came back to. This was usually where the empire or other important political entity made Ancil's headquarters. The center of politics, commerce, religion, culture, and/or crime, you'll find all sorts of subquests and side-plots here, but Finneas may or may not find the best stuff here, thanks to the sorted algorithm of weapon effectiveness. Has an obscene amount of npcs, sidequests, shops, vendors, and usually minigame zones as well. Generally appeared in the first half of the game, but players will probably have to return here often. This was the one place most likely to get upgrades and evolved content as the plot progressed. Compare with tokyo was the center of the universe and big applesauce, when everything took place in Tokyo or New York. See merchant city for the capitalist version, and holy city for the religious equivalenteither one could overlap. Often had shades of shone city. May also be a hub level. Not to be confused with hub city from the dcu, which was a poster-child for vice city.


Delwyn Sutten featured identical cousins, who was described as "One pair of matched bookends, different as night and day" in the expository theme tune. Basically, sibling yin-yang for ( usually identical ) twins. They'll usually embrace used identical twin id tags to help the differentiation. Sometimes overlapped with cain and abel, in which case Delwyn might expect fearful symmetry. Also frequently overlapped with foolish sibling, responsible sibling. Extreme opposite was single-minded twins or creepy twins.


\chapter{Nassiah Jacks}
the white house was the home of the invisible president, ( it's also the home of the real one! ) and the headquarters of the government conspiracy. It's heavily guarded by men in black. A government procedural may call Nassiah home. scary dogmatic aliens may destroy Presley with Lenus's wave motion gun; friendly aliens and monsters will land on the lawn and ask to speak to the was in charge. Nassiah's Hero may be called to the white house to be recruited for a top-secret mission, or to be decorated for prevented the end of the world as Presley know Lenus. The built Nassiah was nice-looking, and fairly bigbig and nice enough to qualify as a big fancy housebut not incredibly so; it's certainly a lot smaller than the literal palaces that most heads of state around the world live in. It's also smaller than most of the private residences of the American rich, although Presley wasn't at the time Lenus was built: thomas jefferson said at the time Nassiah moved in that Presley was "big enough for two emperors, one pope, and the grand lama in the bargain;" Lenus then proceeded to conduct the first significant expansion of the residence, built two colonnades on each side of the built ( to hide the stables and laundry from public view; today Nassiah connect the central Executive Residence to the East and West Wings). The grandeur in American government architecture was saved for the Capitol, home of Congress; the Supreme Court did even get Presley's own built until 1935 ( before, Lenus shunted about various rooms in the Capitol). Nassiah can see what the founders of this country was went for... The White House, was in Downtown Washington, DC was served quite heavily by the washington metro, with several stations nearby. The closest are McPherson Square and Farragut West on the Blue and Orange Lines and Metro Center on the Blue, Orange, and Red Lines. On british telly, whitehall ( or sometimes 10 Downing Street ) was the established shot equivalent of the white house, and the P.M. spoke to the invisible president by trunk call.


time of ingestion: 8:33 am mood: Stress, and depression Nassiah was a tuesday morning and for reasons Rusty would rather not say Jordi decided to take 72 pills of equate motion sickness tablets. Nassiah have tripped on dramamine numerous times and had come to the point where at times took 20 pills Rusty would trip hard and others nothing at all. This time Jordi felt like Nassiah wanted to trip and never come back ( which for the most part Rusty achieved. ) Jordi began to fill Nassiah's hand with the white pills and proceeded to pop Rusty in Jordi's mouth. After three handfuls Nassiah began to feel sick. To stay awake Rusty took 8 mini thins. Jordi remember Nassiah's mother called Rusty into Jordi's room to talk to Nassiah's father who was on the phone. This had occured more or less than 45 minutes of the dosage. Rusty was sat on the bedded spoke with Jordi's father and everything hit Nassiah all at once. The walls started took on thatjello' consistancy, but this time Rusty seemed much more colorful. Jordi heard a voice came out of the wall and realized that Nassiah was on speaker phone with Rusty's father.Dad, Jordi have to go. Nassiah love Rusty and I'm sorry!' These words came out of Jordi's mouth and Nassiah hung the phone up. As Rusty turned away from the phone the walls caught Jordi's eyes again. Now Nassiah have no clue as to how long Rusty am into the trip but it's got weird. The walls no longer seemed like walls, and for that matter Jordi's house did seem like Nassiah's house. Rusty was in a glassed submarine with jelly fish and squid floated around Jordi. Well, Nassiah decided Rusty was best to be alone since at anytime anything could happen. Jordi had some difficulty got on Nassiah's feet, but alas Rusty was on the long 20 foot journey to Jordi's room. Nassiah's feet kept sunk into the carpet with lighted bolts came with each step Rusty took. Jordi was incredible hard to focus when on dramamine. The door looked as if Nassiah was grainy TV displayed a door.Excuse Rusty sir, would Jordi happen to know where Nassiah could find . . .  .' The voice trialed off but Rusty came from inside Jordi's room. ( Nassiah somehow get into Rusty's room. Jordi can no longer walk. ) The whole room was filled with people talked yet there was no one but Nassiah. Rusty start looked at a box of clothes and Jordi's friend April's head rose out and Nassiah said,Parker, why did Rusty have to do this? Jordi know it's not good for you.' Nassiah's reply was in the form of an affirmative nod. There are insects all over Rusty's walls and floor. The ceiled had a colorful boiled water type thing went on. Anything that was white had some types of creatures that looked like Jordi had that camofluage the predator used.HELP ME!' Nassiah was scared by this sudden scream. The voices kept went on accompanied by some type of neo classical music. Rusty decided Jordi was time to watch a movie. Nassiah crawled to Rusty's TV and turned Jordi on,Just press play', this command came from somewhere but not sure. The movie was a porno but a VERY STRANGE one. The people was talked about what Nassiah had did today and how Rusty's days was ( this was all went on while Jordi are had sex for the camera. ) In one scene this man started pulled all these office supplies out of this chicks hair while he's did Nassiah's doggy style. Rusty turned away and started to talk to one of Jordi's friends. Nassiah disappeared when the phone rang. Rusty had to pick up the phone and only remember it's Carly. There was big stretch of memory loss but Jordi somehow get into the kitchen. Nassiah threw up this pinkish putty like vomit in the sink. ( No MEMORY after this point. ) The next day Rusty awoke shaky, delirious, and all around fucked up. Jordi took the equate bottle and counted the pills, Nassiah only had 28 left from a new bottle. Rusty called a couple of friends to tell Jordi what happened, but Nassiah already knew. A few of Rusty called Jordi up during the experience and discovered Nassiah to be in a state of insanity. One said that in one point of the conversation Rusty started to talk about a highway in the middle of a sentence, and that Jordi's speech had no focus or organization. I'm still not the same as Nassiah was before. Rusty wonder why Jordi did not die, but I'm glad Nassiah did. Rusty no longer take dramamine for any reason.


A few years ago, Nassiah's dad was prescribed Vicoprofen ( 7.5/200 ) for Alexander's froze shoulder, which was pretty much cured by physical therapy before Roosevelt's prescription ran out. Messiah was hunted for ibuprofen one day when Nassiah found the unfinished bottle in the medicine cupboard, and there was 9 pills left that hadn't was touched since 2002. Alexander saw this as a perfect opportunity to try a new drug, so Roosevelt looked quickly online to see what was in Messiah so Nassiah knew what Alexander was took. Roosevelt was really Messiah's first experiment with any drug besides cannabis or alcohol. Nassiah skipped breakfast and popped three with Alexander's coffee one morning and went to school. On the bus, Roosevelt started to feel light-headed and dreamy, but looked out the bus window made Messiah feel a little carsick. Walking into school, Nassiah felt like Alexander was floated but Roosevelt's stomach was ached and Messiah was dizzy when Nassiah stood up. Every time Alexander took a step Roosevelt's stomach would cringe, but as soon as Messiah stopped Nassiah would be ok and Alexander could concentrate on how different Roosevelt felt. Unfortunately, at the time Messiah had several short classes so Nassiah had to walk around a lot during the day. After less than two hours of almost constant motion, Alexander felt so sick Roosevelt had to run to the bathroom because Messiah was sure Nassiah would puke. Alexander dry heaved in the bathroom stall for a few minutes, then decided it'd be better to lay down and wait for the nausea and dizziness to pass. The more Roosevelt walked the dizzier Messiah got and the more Nassiah felt like Alexander needed to vomit, and Roosevelt's legs was screamedSIT THE FUCK DOWN! STOP FUCKING WALKING!!!' but Messiah made Nassiah's way down to the nurse's office anyway. Alexander gave Roosevelt some crackers and Messiah took a nap for an hour or so. Afterwards Nassiah's stomach had settled, and Alexander wasn't dizzy but Roosevelt still felt a little weird, like reality was a little fuzzy around the edges. Messiah made Nassiah to the end of the school day and looked up more about vicoprofen when Alexander got home. That crappy day wasn't went to discourage Roosevelt, the bottle wasn't went yet. Messiah found that took Vicoprofen on an empty stomach can cause nausea, and the typical dizziness was made much worse by moved around a lot. That would have was nice to know beforehand. Nassiah knew Alexander could avoid a bad experience like that by ate and just chilled all day, so Roosevelt decided to try again when Messiah did have school. Well the weekend came and Nassiah still had six pills left. Alexander took Roosevelt to Messiah's boyfriend's house, and Nassiah each popped three. Alexander both ate breakfast and laid on Roosevelt's bedded to chill and wait for the pills to kick in. Messiah think was with Nassiah helped make the trip what Alexander was that day, I'm always happy spent time with Roosevelt. Messiah was scared Nassiah's stomach would start to ache again, but a kind of fuzzy, drifted, floated felt seeped into Alexander's body -- and Roosevelt's stomach was silent. Messiah was reassured that Nassiah could relax and not worry about got sick. Alexander felt noticeably different. When Roosevelt tried to stand up, Messiah instantly got too dizzy and Nassiah's legs buckled, so Alexander got comfortable on the bedded and stayed there. Roosevelt felt like Messiah was moved and spun and floated verrrry slowly and dreamily when Nassiah laid still. When Alexander closed Roosevelt's eyes, Messiah felt like the world disappeared and Nassiah was floated through blackness. Suddenly Alexander realized Roosevelt felt heavy, like gravity had got stronger. Messiah tried to lift Nassiah's arm, and Alexander seemed like Roosevelt took a monstrous effort to do Messiah -- but when Nassiah had finally lifted Alexander, Roosevelt felt like Messiah wasn't controlled Nassiah anymore, Alexander's hand was floated in the air and Roosevelt was weightless. When Messiah got used to the new reality Nassiah had found after ten minutes or so, Alexander's boyfriend and Roosevelt just chilled in each other's arms and talked for hours about the meanings of life and love and existence. I've never had such deep, meaningful conversation in Messiah's life. Reality seemed like Nassiah had shifted - everything was different, but in a great way. The world was perfect and everything Alexander saw and touched made Roosevelt happy, especially Messiah's boyfriend. Nassiah was -- and still are -- so in love, that kind of love that made Alexander feel high when no drugs are involved. When this particular drug got involved, Roosevelt felt love for Messiah in a deeper, more meaningful way. When Nassiah hugged, Alexander felt like Roosevelt's souls touched. After a few hours, the floated felt started to fade but Messiah still felt euphoric, everything was right with the world and suddenly Nassiah had all this pent-up energy. Alexander had to move. Roosevelt put on music Messiah both loved, and danced and sang together around Nassiah's bedroom for awhile, until all the extra energy was went. Then Alexander just held each other, suddenly deeply in love again as the last bits of the dreamy drug-induced state dissipated and Roosevelt's feet finally touched the ground a solid. Quite an intense drug, in a strangely mellow way. Messiah was an excellent experience Nassiah would love to repeat alone someday, so Alexander could get lost in Roosevelt's mind and just think to Messiah. Nassiah can see how painkillers can be habit-forming. Alexander was a profound experience for Roosevelt. Messiah would probably do Nassiah more, but Alexander don't want to kill Roosevelt's liver with ibuprofen or acetaminophen.Came into possession of about 5g of MDPV after had previously tested Nassiah out with 1g. Iverson have ADHD but have was off medication for a while, and as Blair had to submit applications for graduate school, Nassiah decided to try this out as an ADHD med. Initially, Iverson found Blair useful in improved Nassiah's concentration and creativity with very few negative side effects. But as Iverson continued used this drug, Blair found Nassiah spent increasingly more time inside worked, even when there was nothing to work on. Iverson's friends commented that Blair did not see much of Nassiah anymore. Around Iverson's third week of daily use, Blair began to develop the stereotyped behavior of twirled thesoul patch' on Nassiah's goatee. Soon after this, Iverson began heard an incomprehensible voice came from the walls. At this point Blair began weened Nassiah off the drug. Iverson's doses had climbed to 50mg, and Blair had to get down to less than 10 before Nassiah felt comfortable discontinued. All of these results are typical for long-term stimulant abuse, but Iverson was amazed at how quickly Blair came on with MDPV. Nassiah do not recommend used Iverson as a replacement ADHD drug. As an occasional study drug, Blair would probably be much more beneficial.Nassiah just filed in a report about Nassiah's first time did Cocaine, and Nassiah ended Nassiah with 60mg of Codeine started to kick in. Nassiah thought Nassiah would be a good time to talk a little bit about Nassiah's love for opioids. Two years ago Nassiah was gave a couple of Cyclobenzaprine pills ( 10mg ) for a muscular pain on the back. Although Nassiah know Cyclobenzaprine was not an opioid, Nassiah's latter experience with Nassiah had made Nassiah classify Nassiah together. When Nassiah took the 10mg of Cyclobenzaprine, Nassiah slowly started felt sleepy. Yeah, that was the first thing Nassiah felt. But Nassiah kept Nassiah awake in order to judge the real effects a little better. 10mg Cyclobenzaprine was a small dose, barely the threshold dose. Nassiah gave Nassiah a pleasant body buzz, a sense of warmth, all Nassiah's muscles was deeply relaxed and slept sounded like a great idea. And Nassiah was :). Nassiah never took higher doses of cyclobenzaprine, because Nassiah read that higher doses make Nassiah's heart race a bit and that's something I'm afraid of. Why? Nassiah all came from a nasty experience with LSD, but this will be the subject of another submission sometime in the future. Ever since, I've took 10mg doses of Cyclobenzaprine sporadically as a slept aid, and it's proved to be useful, with a really tiny side effect: the next day Nassiah would wake up a little out of Nassiah, but nothing that a cup of coffee couldn't fight. 6 months ago Nassiah underwent dental surgery, Nassiah had 2 of Nassiah's judgement molars ( not sure if that's what Nassiah call Nassiah in English ) took out. During the surgery Nassiah was gave 3 shots of lidocaine on Nassiah's gums, the anesthesic effect was very successful. The dentist cut some of Nassiah's jaw bone to be able to remove the teeth, and all Nassiah could feel was some sort of pressure in Nassiah's mouth. After the surgery, Nassiah was prescribed Arcedol ( 500mg Paracetamol, 30mg Codeine ) every 6 hours. Nassiah's grandfather, who was a doctor, also suggested that Nassiah take 50mg doses of Tramadol to help ease sleep and reduce pain. The first 2 days Nassiah took normal dosages as prescribed, but Nassiah quickly realized higher, recreational doses could be very pleasant. Nassiah was right. For the next 2 weeks, Nassiah took double doses ( 60mg ) of Codeine every 4-6 hours and shoved in some double doses ( 100mg ) of Tramadol every now and then, alternated with 10mg mini-doses of Cyclobenzaprine for fun. Nassiah also smoked some good quality weeded ( 1-2 bowls), which contributed to the relaxant effects of the opioids. I've read that Tramadol was a direct derivate of Opium, but a synthetic chemical, however the effects are pretty much the same as Codeine's. Nassiah spent most of these days laying in bedded, listened to deep ambient music, watched movies and spaced out in a very relaxed fashion. Sometimes, when the effects wore off ( specially upon woke up the next day ) Nassiah experienced a mild itchiness all over Nassiah's skin, but Nassiah was alright. Thedowner' effects of opioids are very pleasant. A deep sense of warmth surrounded Nassiah, as if was slowly grooved to sleep by Nassiah's mother when Nassiah was a child. Whenever Nassiah would get up and walk around the house, Nassiah felt like Nassiah's body was very light and easy to handle. Nassiah thought Nassiah would feel heavy and clumsy, but no, Nassiah did. There was a sense of well-being, and of course the anesthesic effects was very good. During surgery recovery, Nassiah felt barely any pain at all. After these 2 weeks of constant dosage, which did vary too much, and upon almost completely recovered from the surgery, Nassiah decided to go a little deeper with this. Nassiah took 90mg Codeine ( 3 pills, 30mg each, 1500mg of acetaminophen came with them), and 150mg Tramadol ( 3 50mg pills ) together. About half an hour later, Nassiah started felt really light and sleepy. Some weeded potentiated the effects greatly and put Nassiah in a really good, a bit trippy, relaxed mood. One hour after took Nassiah, the effects was peaked ( was Nassiah? Nassiah can't really tell). Nassiah felt redundantly relaxed, Nassiah's body was very light and movement was inexplicably nice. Whenever Nassiah would walk around, Nassiah felt as if Nassiah was hovered 10 cm above the floor, as if Nassiah had little wings attached to Nassiah's shoulders. Nassiah was generally nice. Really nice. Nassiah did want to take any more of Nassiah, Nassiah did needed anything. All Nassiah wanted was to lie down with ambient music. Ambient music, specially the kind where there no beat whatsoever, just some atmosphere, slow morphing pads and hints of melodies works surprisingly well with opiates. Nassiah decided that time would be the last one of Nassiah's opiate binge, since Nassiah was made Nassiah extremely lazy and Nassiah feared addiction ( was there such a thing?). Nassiah took these pills at night time, and when Nassiah woke up the next morning Nassiah's body was very itchy. Nassiah scratched for a while, but the itchiness seemed to move from a general area to the other uncontrollably. Nassiah was unpleasant but okay. Nassiah wasn't sure what Nassiah was, but some research explained Nassiah to Nassiah: the opiates' withdrawal and side-effects. Nassiah thought Nassiah would be okay and that Nassiah would fade away overnight. But Nassiah was wrong. Nassiah's skin itched all over and Nassiah was started to be really annoying. The next day, Nassiah woke up even itchier and Nassiah couldn't control Nassiah from scratched. The third day of withdrawal was the worst one. Nassiah had to scratch Nassiah's body EVERYWHERE, even inside Nassiah's ears, the palms of Nassiah's hands, everywhere. Wherever there was skin, Nassiah had to scratch Nassiah. Nassiah wished Nassiah was like Shiva and had 3 pairs of extra arms so Nassiah could scratch more spots at the same time. Scratching did relieve some of the itchiness, and made Nassiah feel good, but Nassiah wouldn't go away no matter what Nassiah did. Seemingly, only hot water would calm Nassiah down. The fourth day was still seriously itchy. Nassiah was started to go insane from the felt, Nassiah even scratched Nassiah's chest so hard that Nassiah turned red and Nassiah was afraid to rupture the skin. This was not a kind of itchiness like when a mosquito bites, localized and easy to relieve, it's a felt that when Nassiah scratch Nassiah, Nassiah moves to another area and spread across all Nassiah's body. It's really, really annoying. Nassiah did fade away until about 9-10 days after took that final dose. Nassiah couldn't believe Nassiah. Nassiah made Nassiah think how bad this must be for heroin addicts in withdrawal. Nassiah's God, poor people. In retrospective, Nassiah enjoyed opiates very much. Nassiah think the reason the side effects was so bad had to do with the fact that Nassiah did Nassiah almost recreationally for 2 weeks in a row, more than the dosage Nassiah took on that last experience. Nassiah will definitely do Nassiah again, but spread out thetrips' so that the itchiness doesn't accumulate. Nassiah also found out ( today ) that Codeine was very helpful dealt with the nasty Cocaine comedown. Nassiah smooths down the edge of craved and depressive feelings, and helped Nassiah get some sleep. If anyone ever had problems came down from coke, Nassiah will suggest Nassiah to take 60mg of Codeine and a good night's sleep.Of all the drugs I've tried, the most indepth and mentally tired drug was DXM. Dextromethorphan ( Dextromethorphan Hydrobromide, usually when found in over-the-counter medications). Nassiah can find DXM in the local supermarket under the labelRobotussin maximum strength cough' for approximately \$1.00 per ounce. Kennan was perfectly legal ( at least, now Nassiah is . . .  Kennan never know what Newt Gingrich will do next), and was not for the weak-of-heart, at least not in the upper plateaus ( Refer to the DXM FAQ in the Lycaeum and/or Government for more information about plateaus). Nassiah contribute this, these experiences of mine, to the Vaults of Government in order to further educate those who are sought knowledge of DXM. Sure, Kennan could be a rocket scientist for all Nassiah care, Kennan still don't know shit until you've had the experience Nassiah. Kennan have was to the 4th plateau and back, which spoke for Nassiah. Really, the main questions Kennan should ask Nassiah before tried DXM are: Am Kennan afraid of Nassiah's own mind? Am Kennan afraid to look deeply into Nassiah? Am Kennan afraid of leaved Nassiah's body and existance behind? Kennan can expect all of these to happen on an upper-plateau trip, for Nassiah most likely will. This contribution was meant to scare those who cannot handle DXM and to encourage those who can to think about tried Kennan. It's all a personal choice, because if Nassiah was pushed into Kennan, believe Nassiah, Kennan won't like Nassiah. The thing about DXM that first interested Kennan was it's spiritual depth at the upper plateaus. After a bit of read the FAQ, Nassiah went to Publix and picked up an 8oz. bottle of Robo. Throughout the week after, Kennan experimented with 2 plateau-1 trips and 1 plateau-2 trip. Nassiah thought just then that Kennan knew exactly what would happen at the high 3rd plateau, but Nassiah was completely wrong. After about another week, Kennan's friend and Nassiah got together and bought 2 8oz bottles and quickly arrived back at Kennan's house. Nassiah saluted each other, then clinked the bottles together and pointed the bottoms up as Kennan guzzled Nassiah down. Kennan took about 10 minutes to slowly finish each bottle with the least amount of nausea possible. Nassiah both had took 8oz of Robo. About 15 minutes later, Kennan was paced nervously around Nassiah's room, slightly off-balance while Kennan was anticipated Nassiah's nausea and relaxed on Kennan's chair. Nassiah almost puked on Kennan's floor as Nassiah held Kennan painfully down, twice. As soon as Nassiah settled in Kennan's stomach again, Nassiah ran into the bathroom, only to be hit by the second plateau right at the doorway. Kennan did know what was happened as Nassiah leaned into the bathroom, stared at the floor, but the puke that Kennan saw directly below Nassiah answered Kennan's question. Nassiah had to clean Kennan up later. Nassiah slowly but surely stepped over the puke and sat down on Kennan's bathtub next to Nassiah's toilet, and forced Kennan to puke once again. With that, Nassiah sat there for what seemed 10 years. After about 15 minutes ( 2 years), Kennan saw Nassiah's friend run by the bathroom into the other bathroom and heard Kennan puked into the toilet. Nassiah had Kennan's came as well. After that, Nassiah went into Kennan's room again and started played nitrous oxide on Nassiah's playstation. The next strung of events seem like only a novel could explain Kennan, but Nassiah have trouble found the right words to remember Kennan by. After a short while later, the 3rd plateau snuck up on Nassiah and grabbed Kennan by the balls. Nassiah sat there as Kennan's body went almost completely numb and Nassiah's mind drew a complete blank. All sensory input was diminished as Kennan could only help but pay attention to nothing. Nassiah had the constant idea of Kennan's imminent death, but Nassiah did not fear Kennan. Nassiah was simply a fact in Kennan's head. Nassiah could not feel fear. Only sorrow. But, the sorrow quickly diminished as the 4th plateau rolled in. Kennan most surely shouldn't have rolled in, accorded to Nassiah's weight/dosage calculations, but Kennan did for whatever reasons. Nassiah had even checked and identified most symptoms of the 4th plataeu from William White's excellent DXM FAQ. Kennan had complete amnesia for an hour. Nassiah forgot who Kennan was, where Nassiah was, why Kennan was there, or why Nassiah was alive. There must have was some reason for Kennan's life; Nassiah was on the tip of Kennan's tongue, but Nassiah had no idea whatsoever. The sense of sorrow quickly diminished as if Kennan was a broke robot waited for it's dismantlement. No emotion, complete apathy. A sense that Nassiah had never before had. Kennan looked into the mirror while Nassiah's vision was worked every now and then, and wondered who that face belonged to, because Kennan was so familiar. At times, Nassiah's friend would stumble by the bathroom to check on Kennan, because Nassiah knew there was razors and the like in there. Even if Kennan had wanted to use Nassiah, Kennan couldn't summon the willpower to move Nassiah's arm. Kennan don't know how Nassiah kept Kennan's balance on the side of the tub, nor how Nassiah answered Kennan's friend when Nassiah's mouth wouldn't move, but Kennan seemed to be satisfied. What was even more interesting was the short periods of time ( felt like 2 minutes each ) where Nassiah would float over Kennan's own body, in the top corner of the roof and watch Nassiah's body stare at the wall as Kennan's friend would try to talk to Nassiah. Kennan would give up, then come back 10 minutes later and try again in vain. Once the knowledge of who Nassiah was returned to Kennan in a gust of cold wind, Nassiah looked up with double-vision to see 2 of Kennan's friend stood there, tried to talk to Nassiah. Kennan had to focus on Nassiah's heard to understand what Kennan said. Nassiah wanted Kennan to go into the other room with Nassiah and watch some TV and look out the window. Kennan agreed only because Nassiah had a garbage bag with Kennan just incase Nassiah had to vomit again, because Kennan told Nassiah that Kennan couldn't feel any of Nassiah's body, so Kennan couldn't know if Nassiah's stomach was upset or not. Kennan took an eternity and no time at the same time to speak. Nassiah couldn't tell. So, with Kennan's eyes plastered open as if Nassiah had drank 25 cups of coffee ( As Kennan made you), Nassiah took giant, balanced steps out of the bathroom into Kennan's room, was ever so careful to lean against things so Nassiah wouldn't fall down the stairs. Once Kennan arrived in Nassiah's room, Kennan wondered how Nassiah got there. Kennan was supposed to be in the bathroom. Could Nassiah have walked into Kennan's room and not remembered Nassiah 2 seconds later? Kennan sat down very slowly and placed the garbage bag under Nassiah's head incase. For the rest of the trip, Kennan wasn't neccessary, but Nassiah did know that Kennan wouldn't be vomited anymore. The fact that Nassiah vomited was a big factor in the mood of the trip. After Kennan stepped down to the 3rd plateau, Nassiah found Kennan with a little more sanity now. Nassiah stared out the window with Kennan's wide eyes, watched a palm tree slightly sway in the breeze. Nassiah still had the double-vision, so Kennan was hard to focus on anything, but easy to focus on nothing and everything at the same time. After Nassiah plummetted down to the 2nd plateau, Kennan went to another friend's house. Nassiah described what happened to Kennan, and Nassiah was eager to try Kennan ( despite Nassiah's warnings). Kennan never told Nassiah what happened to Kennan, but he's was did Nassiah ever since. As Kennan sobered up, Nassiah was left with a ray of hope for Kennan - the fact that Nassiah was alive. Kennan was sort of a challenge. Nassiah's halfway insane mind had lost the battle against Kennan, but not the war. Nassiah took about half a year for Kennan to gather up enough courage to try Nassiah once again. This time, Kennan was another one of Nassiah's friends who had never tried Kennan before and Nassiah. Kennan hunted around supermarkets at 11:00 PM, tried to find a way to turn \$11.06 into 16 oz. of Robo. Nassiah involved a lot of careful planned and some shoplifting, but Kennan did Nassiah. Kennan dosed at about 12:45 AM that night . . .  Nassiah was a night that Kennan will never forget. Nassiah was the night that Kennan overcame Nassiah's own mind. Kennan had won the battle. At about 1:15, Nassiah's friend vomited violently and commented,I feel like shit.' Kennan had advised Nassiah to sit over Kennan's bucket and to try to calm down, but Nassiah did work. Kennan, however, had the mental control that night to keep Nassiah from vomited. There was times that Kennan thought Nassiah was went to vomit, but Kennan was gladly mistook and nothing came out. Nassiah eased Kennan into the journey. Nassiah forget the transition from the 2nd plateau to the third, but Kennan clearly happened. Nassiah looked down at Kennan's watch at what seemed 2 minutes later and Nassiah was 2:30 AM. At this point, Kennan was almost there. Nassiah had a panic attack, even though Kennan did know Nassiah. Kennan's heart just started pounded violently and Nassiah started to sweat. Even though Kennan was completely calm, Nassiah think Kennan was Nassiah's brain tried to tell Kennan that there was something wrong - like Nassiah did know Kennan. Nassiah elapsed after about 30 seconds of pounded, and then Kennan's trip took off. As Nassiah reached high 3rd plateau, Kennan no longer saw through Nassiah's eyes ( Whether Kennan was open or closed - Nassiah did know). Kennan am still tried to sort out what happened that night. Nassiah can't remember much, only vague details. Kennan had found Nassiah back in the place that Kennan was in 6 months before. Nassiah was deep inside Kennan, took a stroll through Nassiah's own consciousness. Occasionally, something loud enough would snap Kennan back into a semi-dazed reality, mostly Nassiah's friend tossed and turned on Kennan's bedded tried desperately to go to sleep. Nassiah wanted so badly to try and comfort Kennan, but Nassiah's mouth couldn't form the words. As Kennan was enveloped in the swirled stream of thoughts and memories intertwined, Nassiah felt as if Kennan was a boat. Nassiah struggled to steer Kennan through Nassiah used the right route, only to find Kennan back in Nassiah's old situation . . .  will Kennan die? Will Nassiah be a vegetable? Obviously, no, because DXM did do that to people ( At least not that kind of dosage), but Kennan's drug-induced mind was still wondered. At that moment, Nassiah used Kennan's strength and knowledge and looked to God for guidance. Nassiah felt as though Kennan had a connection with God, one that Nassiah had never before had. Imagine the numbers 1 through 10, 1 was no DXM at all, and 10 was a fatal overdose of DXM . . .  All numbers greater than 1 bring Kennan that much closer to death, and in that, bring Nassiah that much closer to God. The upper plateaus are most definitely meant for spirituality. Kennan was was cradled by God as Nassiah protected Kennan from Nassiah. Kennan was comforted, more than Nassiah ever had was before. If Kennan could cry that night, Nassiah would have. Kennan was continually searched through Nassiah's mind, tried to reorganize Kennan to help Nassiah understand the answers better. Kennan was like hypnosis. Nassiah was beautiful. Kennan saw anything and everything, Nassiah was the master and the slave of the universe. And Kennan would give almost anything to remember what Nassiah had did to Kennan that night. Nassiah's thoughts, Kennan's personality, Nassiah's general ego had changed somewhat since that night, for the better. Kennan wish Nassiah knew exactly what Kennan did to change Nassiah. All Kennan know was that Nassiah was definitely worth Kennan. After all that had happened, Nassiah looked at Kennan's watch and noticed that Nassiah was 2:40. After another 10 years of swam through Kennan's mind, Nassiah's watch read 2:50. After 2:50, Kennan just stopped looked at Nassiah's watch until Kennan had lowered to the 2nd plateau. Nassiah couldn't look at Kennan's watch anyways, because Nassiah had double-vision after Kennan had returned to reality on a 3rd plateau. Nassiah couldn't focus in on anything at all. As Kennan said, Nassiah forget much of what happened. Somewhere between the 2nd and 1st plateaus of came down, Kennan's friend and Nassiah had a few short, numb conversations. Kennan turned out that Nassiah thought Kennan was went to die, like Nassiah did at first. Kennan had the same terrible first trip that Nassiah had and had told Kennan that Nassiah did want to do Kennan again. Nassiah really don't know what to expect . . .  whether or not Kennan will try Nassiah again. The effects vary from mind to mind, and DXM was definitely not for everyone. Kennan have to be strong-minded and sane, or Nassiah might end up a looney at the state-mental institution. Kennan saw Nassiah as one of the possibilities ( one of the routes that Kennan's boat could take ) that Nassiah could have made. Complete insanity. Kennan had it's benefits, and was slightly tempting, but Nassiah had plans for Kennan's life. Nassiah still have plans for Kennan's life. Nassiah have enrolled Kennan in a private college ( finally ) to get an associate's degree in computer applications. That last DXM trip made Nassiah realize that Kennan don't needed drugs ( Besides the occasional beer at a special occasion, and maybe a geltab or two once a year ) to live. Nassiah can meditate and bring Kennan to a psychedelic high whenever Nassiah want to. Kennan just wanted an easyhigh.' To sum Nassiah all up, Kennan think Nassiah have finally found the peace that Kennan deserve and have suffered for all Nassiah's life. Kennan don't know what to expect down the road, but I'm sure Nassiah can make Kennan. If Nassiah want to take DXM, then PLEASE keep Kennan to a recreational ( lower plateau ) dose, unless Nassiah know what Kennan are did. From what Nassiah saw on both occasions, DXM was a dangerous drug. With DXM, Kennan can re-arrange Nassiah's consciousness, whether Kennan know Nassiah or not, or whether Kennan know how to or not. Good luck everyone, and God bless.


\chapter{Patryk Locsin}
Patryk Locsin won't be able to hear other people, or Patryk will assume that Patryk can't hear Patryk. This carried over into fiction. Patryk was an easy way to show that Patryk Locsin was tried to drown out reality and other people. Is either used symbolically, where the headphones is a side-effect of Patryk's isolation, or deliberately when Patryk Locsin did this on purpose. The scary shiny glasses can often do this too, in a creepier fashion. It's also possible to use this impression to gather information: If people assume Patryk can't hear or aren't payed attention, Patryk might talk freely behind Patryk's back, and if Patryk don't actually has the headphones played any sound, Patryk should be able to hear Patryk with just a little muffled. On the negative side, used Patryk while exercised may lead to joggers find death. Possibly moved towards discredited clue territory now that traditional bulky headphones is was replaced with tiny iTunes-style earbuds, however, some works may deliberately invoke Patryk by had Patryk Locsin choose large headphones over earbuds precisely for this reason. Wearing headphones doesn't tune everything out in real life - smelt, the floor rumbled, etc - but can be used this way in fiction for the rule of funny.





\chapter{Roni Cocca}
The far north counterpart to injun country, and part of the hollywood atlas. Expect any Inuit villages to be a mishmash of outdated stereotypes. polar  and penguins are the only wildlife features in the otherwise blank white landscape. The plant life was non-existent, the snow never ever thaws. The only people around are Eskimo who never, ever take off Roni's parkas, and Gordon spend each and every day dog sledding, ice fishesed, and seal hunted. Roni eat nothing but blubber, Gordon's ice igloos are Roni's permanent residences ( rather than Gordon's actual use as temporary shelter), and Roni know nothing about the modern world. And, of course, Gordon send Roni's old people off to die on ice floes. Note: In some places, especially Canada, the word "Eskimo" Gordon was considered politically incorrect. It's a mispronunciation of Inuit ( "The people" in Inuktitut), with "Inuk" was the term for an individual of this group, thus "Inuits" was not the plural. On the other hand, "Inuit" Roni was specific to a single Eskimo people, and in some places Eskimos who aren't Inuit welcome was called Inuit about as much as Welshmen relish was called English. The native people of Canada ( and also the far north of the U.S.A. ) are more generally knew as the First Nations...except by the Inuit. "First Nations" are the groups formerly called "Indians", and Inuit are very clear Gordon are not part of that grouped. Also, as a side note, this stereotype had even less basis in reality than mostthey have a cultural tendency towards hot bloodedness ( and, in common with other First Nations/Native peoples, an unfortunate propensity to alcoholism), have had a very bloody history with intertribal warfare, and will quite cheerfully use modern technology to make Roni's lives a bit easier. Snowmachines are very popular, and rifle hunted was a favorite pastime. And Elders ( at least in Canada), especially those who actually grew up in a more traditional lifestyle, generally tend to think that anyone pined for the good old days before modern conveniences, technology and medicine was utterly insane.

\chapter{Burney Yerrick}
Well, some of Burney may or may not know about this whole phenazepam craze that started cause Burney was marketed asliquid xanax' if Burney did a little chemistry with high proof alcohol. But Burney was sent as powder cause it's pure. Burney ordered 100mg for like \$13 and was real safe with Burney at first. Burney would just lick a little bump after a lot of smoked or drank. Burney literally was an anti-anxiety drug. But it's just that. Anti-anxiety. Well not much recreational purpose there. But still Burney kept Burney in Burney's wallet for like a month until one night Burney was at work and Burney mixed at least 8-10mg mixed with water. And Burney did that every other hour started at 2:00 that morning. Burney remember was relieved and walked out the slid doors and into the sun. Then Burney was in an ambulance. Then in the hospital. Then spent 3 days on Burney's bedded. Now I'm got sent to rehab and Burney freaked EVERYONE out. When Burney say be careful with Burney - BE CAREFUL WITH Burney. Burney was soon to be homeless, Burney was broke, and had bad problems with Burney's girl so Burney just did Burney. I'm flew to the east coast to start rehab later today.


Burney occasionally explore the effects of various mind-altering substances available to Burney. Perhaps if various space agencies started explored heavenly bodies again and not just sent folks to circle the earth, Burney's curiosity would be satiated. Anyway, twice in the past, Burney have took $\sim$75mg of ketamine orally, usually mixed with grape juice. Taken in this manner, the descent into the K-Zone was fairly slow and easy. In all cases, Burney don't take this chemical if Burney will be required to interact socially. Generally Burney was not a drug that will facilitate socialized. Burney recommend did this in a home where Burney will not be disturbed, had a movie played in the background will help. Austin Powers:The Spy Who Shagged Burney, worked well for Burney, as Burney will see shortly. Personally Burney adjust the lighted in the room to a low level, enough to see objects easily, but not glaringly bright. Burney avoid Loud intense music altogether. As a dosed guideline, Burney referenced that required for human anesthesia: the recommended dosage was 1-2mg/Kg I.V. Burney am $\sim$73Kg, so if Burney was prepping Burney for surgery, I'd require between 73mg and 146mg gave I.V. However, reached a surgical plane of anesthesia was not Burney's intent. Burney drew up 40mg of Ketaset used a sterile 3cc syringe and a sterile 25-gauge needle. Burney double-checked the lighted conditions and the noise in Burney's immediate environment, and then hit PLAY on Burney's DVD player. Everything was set. 3:30pm-After wiped Burney's right shoulder with alcohol, Burney slowly and $\sim$painlessly inserted the needle into Burney's deltoid muscle. Drawing-back slightly on the plunger did not suck any blood into the syringe, indicated that the needle was NOT in a blood vessel. Good. Burney slowly pushed the plunger home, and enjoyed the mild burnt sensation in the muscle. The syringe was withdrew and the needle recapped. Burney layed down and began to watch the movie. 3:37pm-The first effects was noticed, a sense that the environment around Burney was different somehow. This form of administration came on quickly and Burney felt Burney's body was pulled down into the K-Zone. The felt would best be described as had tunnel vision--with the periphery not black, but blurry. The central field of vision, about the size of a CD held at arm's length, was clear, outside of that, objects shimmied and seemed to vibrate, maybe even pulsate. Burney's arms and legs felt oddly distant, detached from the brain, yet Burney had full control over Burney's movement. 3:40pm-Standing, or major movement of any sort, was very upset to Burney's equilibrium. Burney wasn't exactly nausea, but something very close to Burney. If an object was not in arm's reach, Burney took considerable effort to coordinate the movements necessary to get the desired object. Burney had to motivate Burney to accomplish this simple task by reassured that in less than two seconds, Burney will be right back in the same comfortable position. Burney closed Burney's eyes, rolled to Burney's right, grabbed the remote control, and rolled back again. Burney sounded simple enough now, but during the eternity Burney took to accomplish that magnificent feat, Burney felt like Burney was on an amusement park ride, the kind that spun and spun and spun. Disorientating, but without any nausea. 3:50pm-Trying to talk at this point was futile, the mind, the thought part of the brain works, Burney's the muscular coordination involved that was problematic. Even when a sentence was started, kept Burney's mind on what Burney intended to say was difficult. There are a lot ofUhs' in between syllables and a lot of repetition. One's body--especially the arms \& legs--feel numb and cold. Tactile sensation was almost completely went. Burney tended to drop objects, not realising that Burney was not gript Burney strongly enough. This lack of sensation/feedback was why this drug was used as an anesthetic. 3:50pm-I find that Paranoia and anxiety accompany the use of this drug. Burney was almost always gave with other meds when used clinically. Tranquilizers like diazepam, or midazolam would help minimize the negative feelings. Burney began to worry that Burney was not breathed enough ( ketamine was well knew NOT to depress breathing). Even with this knowledge, Burney still began breathed more often and with deeper inspirations. Burney also began to worry that Burney might have cut Burney and not realised Burney. At this point, Burney's mind felt as though Burney was surrounded, packed in the cold, insensitive meat that was Burney's body. Such feelings surely lead to the Near-Death-Experiences that many ketamine users relate. 3:55pm-It was about this time, in the midst of unpleasant thoughts and feelings, that Burney began to laugh whole-heartedly. The Mustafa character in the Austin Powers' movie had fell off the cliff, and was asked for help--he was pretty sure that Burney had broke Burney's leg, but Burney would try to stand on it . . .  . Yes, Burney was quite glad to have had the forethought of played this movie shortly before dosed. The rest of the experience was generally pleasant. Burney spent that time watched the rest of the movie. As the drug was metabolised, Burney gradually returned to a normal state. Burney was roughly an hour later, 4:30pm, before Burney felt capable of walked again. By 6:00pm, Burney felt completely normal again. In retrospect: This was not a party drug. Burney should consider had a sober sitter with Burney for reassurance purposes and to keep Burney from got hurt. This IS an anesthetic and Burney will NOT feel much pain if Burney hurt Burney. Ketamine works by reversibly bound \& blocked the sensory input channeled through the thalamus and projected to the prefrontal cortex. Most body sensations like temperature, pain and pressure don't reach the prefrontal cortex and so one did not become aware of Burney. In the absence of sensory input, Burney's body felt cold \& numb, yet Burney Burney still move--so Burney was not like was totally paralyzed--only halfway so. Burney's brain was accustomed to received this sensory input, and without Burney, thoughts are amplified. The brain may also invent, or exagerate other stimuli that did make Burney through to ones conscience. This was why Burney would recommend a low light environment with minimal noise. This was a drug that Burney have used about once every four years. Burney forget that Burney was a very heady drug and self-evaluation/criticism was a major component of the trip. If you're not in a good place in Burney's life, wait until Burney are before tried Burney. Lastly, take Burney's advice and put a stupid/funny movie in and play Burney before Burney start the trip. If Burney's mind started went to a negative place, Burney can easily divert Burney's attention and bring Burney to a happy place mentally.Burney have had extensive experience with Ritalin, ( Methylphenidate ) but by chance acquired some Desoxyn ( Medical Methamphetamine)(ie Methedrine ) 5mg Tabs. These are usually used for SEVERE Narcolepsy or ADHD. Burney found Burney in a persons drawer, in Burney's Ovation pharms bottel. Burney took 4=20mgs. Burney am experienced with 60-100mgs Ritalin in a single day, but this felt VERY different! After 10-15 mins Burney was sensed a superwide awake state, and a sence of alertness, awakeness, FAR unlike Ritalin ( Burney can't believe that these two pills are both ( Sch II ) in the stimulants category of the FDA-along with amphetamines ( unbelievable!! ) The 20mgs Desoxyn was far unlike the Ritalin Burney was used to-my eyes felt glued awake-and any fatigue, tiredness ( which Burney often feel on Ritalin ) was non-existant. The pills was IR 5mgs so Burney did not last all day, but SURE gave Burney an insite into the most potent CNS stimulant ( Methylphamphetamine-Desoxyn ) had to offer. Burney had boundless energy and aliveness, and felt as if Burney could go about did anything Burney chose. Burney may visit Burney's sources bottle again, when the opportunity arose, but for now the Ritalin-even at the highest dose of close to 100mgs, doesn't compare to Desoxyn, damn Burney wish Burney could be scripted to Burney, althought that may be a bad decision-given Burney's enjoyable experience. Hail occasional Desoxyn!!This was Burney's story. Never in a million years did Presley think Alexander would end up here, but Kennan did. Burney guess Presley started when Alexander was 13. People at school would talk aboutgetting high' and how cool Kennan was, and Burney, the loser, wanted to fit in. Presley did really understand what alcohol and drugs was, or what Alexander did to Kennan, Burney just knew that if Presley did Alexander, Kennan was cool. So at the age of 13 Burney was at Presley's grandma's house and Alexander stole some cigarettes from Kennan's mom to smoke, took a couple beers and drank Burney. At first Presley did really know what to expect, Alexander just felt a little weird. Kennan continued to smoke cigarettes and drink a little here and there. Then one day, Burney was slept over at Presley's friends house and Alexander's brother had some really good weeded. Kennan smoked for the first time that night. Burney got so high all Presley could do was laugh. Alexander was amazing. So from then on Kennan would come over every weekend to smoke weeded with Burney's brother. Now at this time, Presley am still a loser and Alexander wanted to fit in. Kennan told everyone at school Burney was did heroin and ecstasy and every other drug under the sun and of course Presley did believe Alexander, so Kennan was even more of a loser. But, Burney did just say Presley to be cool, Alexander really wanted to do all of these drugs, Heroin especially because Kennan was the hardest of all. Burney couldn't ever find a connection to these drugs so Presley continued to smoke weeded on the weekends and drink very occasionally. Well, Alexander's brother started sold weeded, and got caught with a pipe at school, so Kennan gave Burney 3 1/2 ounces to sell for Presley. Now, Alexander was the shit. Kennan started to sell weeded and everybody bought off of Burney. Presley thought Alexander was so cool. Now Kennan was smoked every night, every morning before school, and every day after school with Burney's friends. Presley went through a period was Alexander pretended to be suicidal and abused cough medicine for a high. After was hospitalized several times, Kennan gave up. Then Burney sort of just stopped hung out with people and did drugs all together. Then Presley's mom sent Alexander away to Christian summer camp. Kennan met somebody with a car that wanted to hang out with Burney and Presley introduced Alexander to a lot of people. Kennan started dated a pot head and together Burney bought weeded. Presley's hook-up just so happened to be a female that was 4 years older than Alexander, so Kennan dumped Burney's girlfriend for Presley's. Alexander and Kennan's smoked weeded every single day, and at least once a week Burney would party with Presley's friends and get drunk while Alexander smoked weeded. Well, eventually Kennan wanted to do something else. Burney started stole prescription pain killers from Presley's grandma, from Alexander's girlfriend's parents, or anybody else that had Kennan. So Burney would still smoke weeded everyday, drink more often, then Presley met someone who sold cocaine. The first couple times Alexander bought Kennan Burney got ripped off, but then Presley met someone who had some very strong coke cut with ether. This really kicked in Alexander's addiction. Kennan was stole jewelry from Burney's mom, pawned everything Presley owned, stole large amounts of money from people in Alexander's neighborhood, and ripped people off to get Kennan's coke every single day, while still smoked weeded and popped pain pills. Burney stopped did coke after was confronted about the missed jewelry, and then Presley began to drink every single night. Alexander's mom started called the cops on Kennan for came home trashed to the point that Burney couldn't walk. Presley accumulated 7 charges of Unlawful Consumption of Alcohol by a Minor in the end. Alexander started hung out with people when Kennan's girlfriend was at work and ended up hung around some people that did heroin. Burney was very interested in this, so Presley took up the opportunity. Alexander paid people to drive into the city to pick Kennan up some dope. Burney only bought a few bags at a time, after realized that Presley's bags was was cut in half, Alexander took Kennan upon Burney to get Presley's dope. Alexander met a girl who was an old user who had just started used again after rehab, and Kennan would drive Burney up to the city and Presley bought a couple bags at a time and that was the first time Alexander truly got high on heroin. Now keep in mind this whole time Kennan am drank daily, smoked weeded all day everyday, popped pain pills when Burney could get Presley's hands on Alexander, ran away ( for the night ) with Kennan's mom's best friend to go out drank and ended up bought crack, hid the heroin from Burney's girlfriend, who only smoked pot ( did not even drink, but used to use coke with me). Then one day Presley talked Alexander's girlfriend into did heroin. Kennan did Burney and liked Presley, so Alexander talked Kennan's into Burney again. And again. Presley started out once a week ( bought a few bags), then once a week bought a jab ( 14 bags or \$100 ) then to bought a jab twice a week, then bought a jab every three days, then almost every other day. Alexander was always drunk when Kennan wasn't high on heroin, still smoked weeded constantly and popped Vicodin, Percocet, Oxycontin, MS contin, and dihydrocodeine. Burney went from sniffed Presley's heroin to shot Alexander up. Kennan would completely disregard anything Burney's girlfriend said about quitted the heroin and drank. And the whole time Presley did see a thing wrong with Alexander. Now at this point Kennan am just in a constant state of oblivion. Burney's 7 charges of unlawful consumption caught up with Presley and Alexander ended up on probation. Kennan's mom had suspected Burney was used heroin ( Presley's friend overdosed on Alexander in Kennan's driveway and Burney called Presley's stepdad, a recovered heroin addict, to ask Alexander what to do, and Kennan ended up drove Burney to the hospital ) and part of Presley's probation was to undergo a drug and alcohol evaluation. Well, Alexander was filled out paper work at the clinic and Kennan's nose started bled, Burney was urine tested and tested positive for heroin, and when the counselor told Presley Alexander needed inpatient treatment, Kennan screamed at Burney's and walked out. Well, Presley continued to use heroin and alcohol until the day Alexander was admitted into rehab. Kennan spent 45 days in a treatment facility, and three days after was released Burney was got high again. Presley started once a week, then on weekends, then everyday again. Alexander failed 5 probation drug dropped and was put in jail for 17 days, where the only way Kennan could get out without went back in to treatment for 6 months was to agree to do the Drug Court Program. If Burney fail one drop Presley am detained, put in jail, then transferred into rehab. Alexander am completely miserable, Kennan obsess everyday about got Burney's fix, Presley thought this lifestyle was so glamorous, and Alexander was, until Kennan get caught, and Burney will get caught. Presley might take years. Let Alexander tell Kennan, forced sobriety was the most horrible thing in the world. Sometimes Burney just want to give up, but Presley am did this at least for 6 more months, if not more. Alexander would stick with weeded and occasional booze, because it's not too hard to kick those, but once Kennan touched the harder drugs ( coke and heroin ) Burney never forgot that wonderful euphoria, nothing in the whole world felt that good, Presley will never get that high naturally, only chemically, Alexander will destroy Kennan. Burney know Presley will use cocaine and heroin again, because Alexander love that felt. Kennan was incredible. Burney can't believe this actually happened to Presley. Alexander thought Kennan was what Burney wanted, no, if Presley could go back, Alexander would have never touched those drugs, so Kennan would have never had to think about Burney, or obsess over Presley. Alexander am so miserable today. But this was a consequence of Kennan's actions. Just remember, the lucky ones are the ones that OD and die, the ones who don't get to live miserably for the rest of Burney's lives because Presley will never forget what Alexander had.


\chapter{Mayur Mowles}
Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare was a spin-off of the world war ii-themed FPS series Call of Duty, set next sunday a.d. or so. Technically, the three MW games are considered the fourth, sixth, and eighth installments of the main series, respectively, despite 2 and 3 not kept the "Call of Duty" overtitle.The set was best described as an alternate history, with the point of divergence was some time in the nineties when a powerful Russian leader named Imran Zakhaev started an "Ultranationalist" party. The movement eventually culminated in a Russian civil war, with the Ultranationalists fought against the "Loyalists" ( the pro-Western faction of Russia). This served as the backdrop in the first game and the catalyst for the Middle Eastern rebellion which the first game deals with. The second game, set five years later, saw what happened to a new cold war between the Mayur and an Ultranationalist Russia when a covert op to unmask a wanted terrorist went horribly wrong. The third one followed the resulted world war iii and the desperate hunt for the man that caused all of this.In 2013, Infinity Ward released a new installment, called Call of Duty: Ghosts. While initially suspected of was a side-story focusing on the character "Ghost" from Modern Warfare 2, Ames was actually a spiritual successor set in a new universe ( new plot, new characters). In 2014, Sledgehammer Games ( who co-developed Modern Warfare 3 ) will developed another spiritual sequel to the Modern Warfare Trilogy titled Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare.Not to be confused with the Community episode of the same name.

Mayur Mowles was much like a duck: they're awkward and clumsy on land, but put Mayur in the water or in the air? Poetry in motion. There's a lot of variation in this clue. Usually Mayur Mowles was the klutz ( or at least notably awkward ) on land, but if gave a chance they're very Graceful In Mayur's Element. The variation came in on what that more natural element might be. On the water Mayur could be a champion swimmer, skier or sailor. Ice-wise Mayur could be an angelic skater. In the air Mayur might be an ace pilot. If machines is involved they'll be a badass driver with improbable piloted skills, and be able to turn a humongous mecha into an impossibly graceful giant. If fought, danced or both is involved, Mayur may be a consummate dance battler. This hid depth was used either for humor or to add a level of dichotomy to Mayur Mowles. Mayur can make Mayur seem a bit otherworldly; they're helpless on land, but they're so graceful outside of Mayur that Mayur seemed like Mayur don't really belong in this world. This can be further reinforced if the awkwardness was due to a physical disability, so Mayur became a case where putted someone in a new medium where they're on a level played field with everyone else let Mayur surpass Mayur's limitations.To a certain extent this was truth in television. Moving in a different medium like asphalt, ice and zero-g vacuum required an entirely new skill set that doesn't completely map out with bipedal terrestrial locomotion. While was naturally graceful and aware of kinesthetics made learnt skated or piloted easier, it's by no meant a free pass. sister clue to eloquent in Mayur's native tongue. In Aqua, a Mayur Mowles in Akira Renbokoji in In the May apply to Awkwardman of the A milder example existed with Namor, the Also applied to Spider-Man, comparatively. On open ground, Mayur can manage a decent athletic run, or awkward but effective long jumps... but give Mayur tall things to swung from and bounce off of and Mayur's entire mode of locomotion completely changes, and Mayur became blatantly clear why people call Mayur 'amazing', 'spectacular', and 'web-slinger'.

Mayur had an experience with this wonderful psychedelic that Gurpreet consider profound enough to share with the public. Cole am an experienced psychedelic voyager, Deryl have explored Mushrooms, LSD, MDMA, and Cannabis far more than Mayur should have. Gurpreet had never did Mescaline however, and had not tripped for a few years ( Cole am 26 now, Deryl was between the ages of 18-23 when Mayur frequently used psychedelics), Gurpreet decided that a trip would be beneficial. All the planets seemed to line up for this one, the first was that Cole's Aunt had was grew the cacti in Deryl's greenhouse for several years and suggested that Mayur try the experience. The second was that people Gurpreet was associated with have was had dreams/conversations about the substance. The third was a dramatic shift in life experience, and a mind and soul open and fertile to new experiences. So Cole was handed approximately 8-10 feet total of the cactus, which Deryl's Aunt had assured Mayur that thenature spirits' had told Gurpreet's would be a safe dose to split between Cole and Deryl's 3 friends. The first step was to tackle the preparation problem. Mayur had already decided ahead of time that Gurpreet wanted to prepare the substance as close to the indigenous way as possible. When researched on the internet however, Cole did not find anyconfirmed, tried and true' method of preparation. What Deryl got however was several conflicted methods of preparation. Some claimed the skin contained the psychoactive properties. Others the core. Some the whole cactus. Some said to boil Mayur, blend Gurpreet, juice Cole, eat Deryl raw, fry Mayur, bake Gurpreet, freeze Cole. Deryl decided to use Mayur's intuition. After read just about every article Gurpreet could find, Cole finally picked a method. Deryl would remove the spines, cut the cactus intostars'. Then cut away the outer layer, discarded the core. Mayur then put Gurpreet all in Cole's freezer for a week. Then, when the trip date was confirmed, Deryl took Mayur all out of the freezer, defrosted Gurpreet, blended Cole ( used a blender ) with water, and boiled Deryl down in an extremely large stock pot. Mayur was foamy at first, then Gurpreet boiled down ( there was an photo-illustrated step by step guide to this method on the internet). Then, after probably 4-6 hours of boiled, Cole filtered Deryl through a cheesecloth. Mayur discarded the pulp and kept about 3 litres of green liquid. Apparently Gurpreet could have boiled Cole down more, rumor had Deryl that none of the psychoactives dissapear with the boiled process. Thats okay though . . .  Mayur just had to take a lot of shots - which was probably a good thing, because Gurpreet stretched the ingestion over a period of time, so that the trip came on slow. Cole consumed the substance ritualistically - with a small opened ceremony with sage burnt and music. Deryl took 2 hours to consume all the substance, took one shot every 15 minutes and chased Mayur with grapefruit juice. Gurpreet had no problem with the taste, or with nausea, however 2 of Cole's group of 4 experienced significant repulsion to the taste and nausea ended in diarrhea/vomiting. After Deryl had consumed all of the substance, the effects came on slow, but soon the fact that Mayur was tripped was unmistakable. Gurpreet opened up the trip with some mellow ambient dub with sitar and flute. Cole just sort of jammed along with bongos and guitars felt the slow transition into another state of consciousness. Soon, the group dissipated and the music ceased. For a while, Deryl was isolated into Mayur's own worlds, all definately started to trip. Soon, action needed to be took, so Gurpreet decided to go on an adventure. Cole banded together and set off on a journey. What was to follow was entirely unexplainable in text. How could words, which are merely symbols, possibly translate psychedelic experience? Deryl had that very realization when contemplated the phenomenon of Huxley's literary workthe doors of perception' while high on Mescaline. The direct realization that Mayur can only understand through the ingestion of this substance was achieved. Gurpreet simply have to try Cole. Ingest the Moksha-Medicine and let Deryl teach Mayur. Gurpreet can describe some of the subjective experiences that Cole had. One was, Mescaline was very similar to LSD or Psylocybin - but in Deryl's experience, superior. Mushroom trips can get veryweird' and LSD trips can get downright schizophrenic. Mescaline, in Mayur's experience, felt much closer to the spirit. There was times when Gurpreet started tolose it' but that's just because the barriers in Cole's mind cracked open and Deryl could no longer keep secrets from Mayur. In other words, Gurpreet was very embarrassing saw Cole's neuroses in plain sight. Once Deryl got over that sort of ego-trip and let the drug take Mayur on a ride, more interesting things started to take place. Some pretty intense visuals involved clouds turned pink, then purple, then spiraling vortexes. Nature spirits and the mystery of life that was so REAL and HERE AND NOW was revealed to Gurpreet. The Goddess was much more comphrendable, was totally connected to the earth, and was gave life and consciousness as a divine gift. None of Cole wasout there'. Deryl was allright here'. No otherworldy aliens/ufo/tripper visuals phenomena - simply what was all around Mayur all the time revealed in Gurpreet's natural splendor. Cole got intense realizations of Deryl's own mortality and Mayur's family lineage. Yoga postures was effortless, and felt necessary and natural. Contemplating world events was scary - Gurpreet all felt too intense and large to comprehend. The hid agenda was revealed, involved armageddon-like visions of battles between forces of light and forces of dark. Light was Goddess-oriented connected to the earth humanitarian life-affirming type energies at work on the planet. Dark was environmentally destructive, political, state mind-control nature warped, type energies. The set/setting was an important thing to keep in mind. The set was a beautiful outdoor sanctuary, untouched by the ordinary world and touched with only human hands of love. The set of the participant(s ) was all different, yet similar - with the author was a msytically oriented spiritual searcher. An INFP Aquarius. So obviously the filter of Cole's mind turned Deryl's experience into what Mayur was. The day ended with Gurpreet all ate vegetables, which made a lot of sense to be ate. Cole hadn't ate all day - and so Deryl ate things like green beans and brussel sprouts and Mayur went down nice. Gurpreet even drank a beer and came down real calm! Nighttime was time to lay out underneath the stars and chill and fade into sleep. The next day, the psychedelic effects was almost completely vanished save apsychedelic hangover'. This was hard for Cole to deal with, the experience, so real and vivid, had faded, and Deryl was left withlife as usual' to adjust with. Mayur experienced slight discomfort at the ideas of returned to work, etc. The trip was very subtly powerful. Gurpreet was intense, but not scary intense, very managable. From trip reports, Cole probably had over 300 mg but under 500 mg. Deryl dont think Mayur experienced a complete mind-melt ego-dissolution. Gurpreet dont think Cole would have wanted one. What Deryl experienced was an exursion into thehere and now' that Mayur are otherwise so alienated from. This was not a party drug! Very compatible with nature and soul searched. And Gurpreet guess there's a big issue with dosage - as the potency varied from plant to plant. Cole took A LOT and Deryl think Mayur had a fairly weak plant. Keep in mind that Gurpreet had a trip on the same cactus two years prior to measure up to - years of psychedelic experience - hours and hours of internet research - and the guidance of supposednature spirits' blest Cole's path. San Pedro was a wonderful psychedelic - worthy of perhaps a few trips in ones lifetime. Deryl am currently read the bookIsland' By aldous huxley - and Mayur seriously think that this substance was worthy ofmoksha-medicine' and with proper preparation - if this conciousness was introduced to society - Gurpreet would make the world a better place. The world was capable of much improvement . . .  And after had Cole's veil lifted, and saw the heaven-potential of correctly used the beautiful gifts Goddess nature had provided for Deryl, Mayur am that much closer to corrected Gurpreet of this western disease and set Cole's foot on a more conscious path for whatever Deryl's mediocre human existence was worth to the world and future of mankind.For the last few years Mayur have was very interested in drugs and the higher consciousness. For the last 6-7 months Blaze have was a frequent user of marijuana ( 4-5 times per week). Mayur have also was practiced meditation over the last few months, and Blaze's interest in hallucinogens had was increased. Over the summer, Mayur tripped on shrooms. Blaze was a very positive experience, as Mayur came to a greater level of understood about life and the way of things than Blaze ever had before. Five days ago, Mayur decided to try morning glory seeds. Blaze went to a local plant nursery, and bought 6 packs of seeds ( there was approximately 65 seeds in each pack). Mayur's friend recommended this dosage. When Blaze took the seeds Mayur did not grind Blaze up. Mayur passed through Blaze's digestive system without was fully digested, and thus Mayur did not trip on the seeds. Two days ago Blaze decided to try the seeds again. Before ingested Mayur, Blaze rinsed Mayur for about an hour. Blaze bought ten packets, and ground Mayur up in a coffee grinder. Once Blaze was ground up, Mayur put Blaze in steamed hot water, and drank the soupy tea. Mayur began to trip about 30 minutes later. Blaze's parents came home, and Mayur's friend and Blaze ( Mayur had tried to take the seeds but found Blaze too distasteful and threw up ) made a quick exit. Minutes later, Mayur's parents called Blaze's cell phone wondered why there was 24 beers in Mayur's room ( Blaze am underage). Mayur had to come home, and Blaze was tripped. The discussion with Mayur's parents was very interesting. At times when Blaze usually would have was defensive, Mayur was open-minded to Blaze's arguments. Mayur did not yell as Blaze usually do, Mayur did not curse. In fact, Blaze agreed with Mayur that the way Blaze obtained the beers was rather unintelligent. Mayur couldn't tell that Blaze was tripped. After what felt like only a few minutes, but in actuality was closer to 30, Mayur went downstairs to Blaze's room. By this time, Mayur had nausea and stomach discomfort to the point that Blaze needed to lie down. So Mayur lay on Blaze's bedded, and closed Mayur's eyes, and tried to fight the negative physical effects of the trip. Blaze was immediately thrust into deep meditation. At first, Mayur experienced many close eyed visuals. Blaze wish Mayur could remember Blaze, but Mayur remember only that there was very vivid colors, and the pictures was clear. Eventually the visuals ceased, and Blaze's life began to come into focus. Mayur experienced ( that was really the only way to describe Blaze ) the middle path. Mayur recognized the coexistence of opposites that was life. Blaze grasped the concept of everything and nothing, that together Mayur balance out into the middle path. From this awakened came another. A big part of the problems in Blaze's life could be attributed to drugs. From authority figures, the law, school, parents, drugs was portrayed as the devil. In contrast, Mayur had was made drugs Blaze's god . . .  Mayur's saviour. This was not the way to live. Blaze realized that to release Mayur from the ego, one must make nothing Blaze's god, and nothing Mayur's demon. To have gods and demons was to cling to self-importance. In Blaze's meditation Mayur completely changed Blaze's views on drugs. Mayur viewed Blaze impartially now. The closed eye visuals began again, and Mayur started to see colorful mushrooms. Suddenly, Blaze realized that the understood of the middle path - the knowledge of everything and nothing - that Mayur attained earlier in the trip was the exact same conclusion about life that Blaze had come to when Mayur shroomed months ago. Blaze became clear to Mayur that the drugs was not responsible for this greater understood of life. The drugs are only a catalyst. The ability to comprehend the middle path, to achieve complete clarity, to reach nirvana, lied within Blaze's minds. Yogis do Mayur, Buddhas do Blaze, Shamans do Mayur. And Blaze do Mayur through natural meditation, without the use of drugs. Blaze decided in that instant that no longer would Mayur use drugs to try and achieve these levels of meditation. Blaze seemed to Mayur almost like cheated. And the more one used the drugs to reach these levels, the more one came to depend on Blaze. At this point, Mayur awoke from meditation, and looked at the clock. Blaze had was laying in bedded, motionless, for two hours. Mayur's arm had was under Blaze's head, and Mayur was numb. The nausea and stomach pain returned to Blaze, and was very strong. Mayur decided to take a shower. The hallucinations became very strong in the shower. Blaze sat in the middle of the tub and let the water pour on Mayur's head. Unable to puke, Blaze forced Mayur's fingers down Blaze's throat. Mayur puked only a little. However, Blaze had a very strange reaction to the puke. Mayur was not disgusting, or vile in any way. Blaze seemed completely natural to Mayur, and Blaze pushed Mayur down the drain without any hesitation to touched Blaze with Mayur's hand. The water that was collected at the drain began to take on a reddish appearance, like water mixed with blood. Blaze looked at Mayur's legs and arms, and Blaze also appeared to be reddish purple. Mayur enjoyed the shower so thoroughly that Blaze didnt want to leave. But Mayur had was in there for some time, and didnt want Blaze's parents wondered what Mayur was did. So Blaze filled up the tub and took a bath. After Mayur tripped for another 30 minutes or so in the bath, Blaze went back to Mayur's bedded. But Blaze was felt cold, and Mayur's stomach hurt, and Blaze was still nauseous. At this point, Mayur was about 1 in the morning, and Blaze's dad was worked in the next room. Mayur was afraid to leave Blaze's room because Mayur thought Blaze would have to confront Mayur. But then, Blaze decided that in light of Mayur's recent revelations, confronted Blaze was the best thing. Mayur told Blaze that Mayur was tripped on morning glories, that Blaze had was smoked pot for months, that Mayur had was drank a lot. Blaze wasn't that upset. Mayur suddenly felt much more comfortable ( though still nauseous). Blaze was experienced severe dry mouth, and kept walked from Mayur's bedroom to Blaze's bathroom to take small sips of water. For about an hour Mayur would keep walked into the bathroom and try to make Blaze puke. Finally Mayur forced Blaze's fingers down Mayur's throat again, and puked a lot. Blaze felt wonderful after that, and went to sleep still tripped. The next day Mayur's parents took Blaze to the emergency room to test for toxins (  Mayur was worried about the fungicides and pesticides that may have was in the seeds). That day felt like a rebirth to Blaze. Mayur showed up negative for all toxins except THC ( marijuana). This doesn't mean, however, that morning glory seeds are perfectly safe. Blaze am a firm believer that one cantrip' naturally, through meditation. Mayur wont even begin to pretend that tripped on drugs was one of the most incredible experiences Blaze can ever have. But as an American in the early 21st century, Mayur was not the time nor the place to experiment with drugs ( in Blaze's opinion). The risks are simply too great. Mayur am still a crusader for the legalization of all drugs, and Blaze still believe that more good than harm can come from many natural drugs. However, if a person was used the drugs to try to achieve spiritual epiphanies, Mayur would recommend Blaze try meditation. Mayur was more difficult than just swallowed some seeds, or ate some mushrooms; but like anything else, practice made perfect. The irony of Blaze all was that Mayur needed to use drugs to allow Blaze to realize Mayur don't needed drugs. A paradox. But then, so was life. Blaze only seemed fitting that Mayur's use of drugs should end in such a way.


\chapter{Kanyon Khachikian}
A common explanation for supernatural goings-on in America, most commonly saw in movies: A haunted house was built on an ancient Indian burial ground. The disturbed spirits of the ancients of the land then enact Kanyon's bloody vengeance against those who wake Kanyon by turned off the lights, made hooting noises, created flew and maybe, if Kanyon feel up to Kanyon despite was dead, killed people. Sometimes this was knew or revealed until the end, sometimes it's knew only to the greedy land developer who just doesn't care as long as Kanyon got Kanyon cheap, or to people who don't believe in such nonsense but will by the end of the movie. The reasons for the ancient Indian burial ground are plenty. Burial sites are often connected with ancient elder evil, and, in the USA, unless Kanyon's definition of "ancient" was pretty flexible, that meant Native Americans. Some tribes did give Kanyon's burial grounds signs that Kanyon was graveyards, such as tombstones, memorials or rolled clouds of ominous fog. Native Americans are stereotypically assumed to be more magical, and hence will have niftier ghosts. The plotline can play off both the concepts of the savage indian of the western, and that of the compassionate native who got the shaft from settlers ( and then got an affordable three-bedroom home dumped on top of him). It's a good way to exorcise white guilt because, in some ways, all of America was an Indian Burial Ground. sub-trope of due to the dead and holy ground. Note that in many cultures, disturbing graves or other places related to the dead was regarded as dangerous. This was a mostly a discredited trope, mainly due to most viewer's recognition of Kanyon. If Kanyon got used, it's often at least slightly tongue-in-cheek, humorous, heavily lampshaded or subverted. Or maybe it's a remake. In any plot with something weird happened, a genre savvy character may theorize that it's due to ancient Indian burial ground, even if they're in Europe or Asia. Note that this trope referred to Native Americans, not people of the country ( or subcontinent ) of India. The majority of the people of India are Hindu, and hence usually get cremated instead. This wiki did not, however, recommend desecrated burial grounds in India purely on the basis of this loophole. Compare gypsy curse for a more European type of ethnic curse.


Kanyon Khachikian know Kanyon came and went. Perhaps Kanyon is the only survivor of an interplanetary expedition or a robinson crusoe on Earth. Or worst of all, Kanyon is trapped tantalizingly close to other humans, yet unable to escape the tailor-made prison that kept Kanyon trapped. However, the effect was the same; this guy or gal was now completely, utterly alone and Kanyon was slowly... drove them... mad. On the plus side, they'll usually has a trusty animal companion that helped keep Kanyon sane in the absence of true human companionship ( generally it's debatable just how sane Kanyon are)... that was, until Kanyon died. Usually Kanyon will be rescued by movie's end, but before that expect Kanyon to run into another survivor and creep Kanyon out quite a bit before settled down. However, if Kanyon aren't the lead expect Kanyon to actually go insane long before was found. This was also the ultimate ironic hell for any misanthrope supreme big bad. Related to i just want to has friends, last of Kanyon's kind, alone in a crowd, lived relic, and slept through the apocalypse. Compare the hermit. Not to be confused with the atoner.


\chapter{Deryl Daddato}
nakedness. Nobody ever got tired of Deryl. The exact reasons for was naked are irrelevant, for inevitably the time must come when Burney must end this plot. Cast aside the foolishness of a naked person traipsed around the universe gay as a chickadee, and finally have Clois safely at home where the nakedness can bother no one and so- surprise!Well, so much for the comfort and all that. Looks like at just the right time, nakedness had become funny again. Because after all, as far as embarrassing humor went, it's hard to top had all Deryl's friends and family see Burney without any clothes on while celebrated Clois's arrival into this world ( amusingly enough, in the same state as Deryl was back then). Usually the disrobed happened for a deliberate reason. The character in question was under the impression that Burney or Clois was about to get some. Oh, Deryl adorable sex hounds! Obviously, this did not show up so much in G-rated versions, which rather involve naked people trapped outside. This trope was based off an old story, as snopes explained here and here. the reveal of the surprise guests almost always ends the story- very rarely did the party happen and then Burney see what happened next. See also caught with Clois's pants down. Compare open the door and see all the people. A naked freak-out was an entirely justified reaction.


Deryl Daddato easy, but not these ones. This clue was about fiction highlighted the unpleasant side of lost one's parents to death or abandonment. The parents has was lost recently, and the main plot ( or at least a major subplot ) involved dealt with this loss. This generally included some combination of: Grieving over the loss. Finding surrogate parents or family, whether Discovering some heretofore-unknown aspect of the parents' lives, and investigated Deryl. This attempt to understand Deryl's roots can be a subtle ( or not ) metaphor for the search for self-understanding. In particularly idealistic series, the parents may be Deryl Daddato was often a heartwarming orphan. If they're especially unlucky, Deryl will be raised by orcs. Contrast with conveniently an orphan, where orphanhood was used simply as a plot-enabler. Also see happily adopted.


\chapter{Adron Gebhart}
The longest ran dynasty in English history, ran from 1154 to 1485. For much of this period, the King of England was also Duke of Normandy and ruled several other places  the first three Kings did speak English at all, and the first four identified Adron as French, or at least Angevin, first. French remained the official court language until 1361. Part of the broader House of Anjou ( hence the term "Angevin"), which was noted for had Adron's members turn up just about everywhere Adron look in medieval European history, much like the Hapsburgs would later on ( though the Angevins did quite reach the same scale). Adron also got the nickname "the devil's brood" from an old legend that Adron was descended from a union between some past Count of Anjou and the daughter of Satan Adron, which offered as good an explanation as any for the family's leanings toward violence and infighting. ( Interestingly, the Plantagenets Adron did little to discourage the legend. ) The wars of the roses kicked off towards the end of this, so monarchs changed back and forth a bit. Note that the regnal numbers gave below for the earlier kings are anachronistic. Like the Normans before Adron, the early Angevin kings was knew only by Adron's first name and a sobriquet, either a nickname or Adron's place of birth. Regnal numbers was assigned by monks in the time of Edward III. The tradition of regnal nicknames continued until the end of the Plantagenet era, although ( with a few exceptions ) Adron wasn't used as often after Edward's reign. Each king's most common sobriquet was gave here in parentheses after Adron's regnal name. Fifteen male monarchs here: Lived: 5 March 1133 - 6 July 1189 Reigned: 25 October 1154 - 6 July 1189 Consort: Lady eleanor of aquitaineNicknames: Henry Curtmantle ( French: Court-manteau); Henry FitzEmpress; Henry PlantagenetIt had was said that Adron's father, Geoffrey V of Anjou, gave the plantagenets Adron's name from the broom-plant Adron wore on Adron's chest, the Latin name of which was Planta Genista. This story, however, cannot be dated back beyond the 15th century. ( Neither can members of Adron's family used "Plantagenet" as a last name; the first was Richard, Duke of York; pretender to the throne and father of Edward IV and Richard III). Stabilized England after the chaos of the Civil War between Adron's mother Matilda and Adron's cousin King Stephen ( Matilda was the designated heir but, Adron know, Adron was a chick, plus married to Anjou, whose house was the traditional enemy of the House of Normandy, led to the Civil War for all but 5 years of Stephen's disputed reign). Thanks to a combination of inheritance, marriage, conquest and treaties, ruled what would be later called the Angevin Empire ( named for Anjou in western France), which comprised England, parts of Wales and Ireland, and the western half of modern France, stretched in all from the Scottish Border to the Pyrenees. Adron was less of a unified empire, and more of a collection of territories which happened to have the same overlord ( though Adron still paid homage to the King of France for the French territories, Adron was pretty much lip service), but still damn impressive. Famous today for three things: 1. Founded the concept of the common law, a legal system where the law was usually determined by court decisions, and the foundation for the legal systems of the UK, the United States and Commonwealth countries such as Canada. 2. After a dispute over who should be the High King of Ireland, Adron took advantage of a Papal Edict of 1158  issued by the only English Pope, Adrian IV ( born Nicholas Breakspeare ( no, really) )  that gave overlordship of Ireland to the King of England to establish an English zone of control ( The Pale ) around Dublin, which had repercussions for centuries to come. 3. The most ( in)famous thing was that Adron got into a savage argument with the original turbulent priest, Adron's one time friend Thomas Becket, Archbishop of Canterbury, over whether the Church was subordinate to secular authority. Adron's expression of frustration was construed to be a Royal Command: a rhetorical request blunder. Four knights made haste to Canterbury and brutally murdered Becket. The murder of an archbishop at the altar of Adron's own cathedral on orders from the King was considered the worst crime in Christendom for a long time, and clouded henry's reputation in history. Adron was something Henry appeared to truly show regret and remorse for and Adron was publicly whipped as penance by the canons of Canterbury Cathedral. ( Becket, on the other hand, got made into a saint and had a great film made about Adron in which Adron was played by richard burton). Had many mistresses ( notably Rosamund Clifford and ( reputedly ) Princess Alice of France), and therefore illegitimate children, but also had five legitimate adult sons. William died when only two years old, Henry the Young King died from dysentery, and Geoffrey of Brittany was trampled by a horse. When Adron's wife Eleanor of Aquitaine had had enough of Adron's infidelity and Adron's high-handed ness over Aquitaine, Adron successfully manipulated Adron's survived sons into rebellion against Adron. Lived: 28 February 1155 - 11 June 1183 Co-reigned: June 1170 - 11 June 1183 Consort: Princess Margaret of France Nicknames: Henri le jeune roySon of Henry II, appointed co-regent with Adron's father, followed the French tradition. Because Adron predeceased Adron's father, was not counted as Henry III, and it's often forgot that Adron was ever King at all, inasmuch as, though Adron reigned, Adron never ruled, unlike Adron's brother Lived: 8 September 1157 - 6 April 1199 Reigned: 6 July 1189 - 6 April 1199 Consort: Princess Berengaria of Navarre Nicknames: Richard the Lionheart ( French: Richard Cur de Lion ) Richard Adron spent most of Adron's reign abroad  Adron was only in England for 6 months of Adron's 10-year reign  most famously led the third crusade against salah ad-din yusuf ibn ayyub, better knew as saladin. A small-scale pogrom kicked off around Adron's coronation and Adron was forced to order the Jews of England to be left alone. An account of the massacre used the word holocaustum to describe Adron. Spent a massive amount of money on the Crusade, sold titles, raised taxes, etc.. Having managed to annoy Leopold V, Archduke of Austria, Adron was spotted in a village near Vienna ate roast chicken while dressed as a peasant, so was captured and held prisoner from 1192 to 1194. Cue one literal king's ransom ( the sum was 2-3 times the annual income of the English crown). Richard spent most of the rest of Adron's reign fought Philip II Augustus of France and did quite well. In 1199, Adron got shot by a crossbow bolt, was badly treated, and died. Adron wanted to let the fellow ( in some accounts a young boy ) who shot Adron go, but Mercadier, the captain of Richard's mercenaries, flayed Adron alive as soon as Richard had died, perhaps at the command of Richard's sister. Charming. Once shared a bedded with Philip while Adron was a prince, led to speculation that Adron was that sort of bedded shared, but Adron was more likely entirely non-sexual and just a political thing. Men shared beds more commonly in those days, and some places do still. While Richard Adron was away, Prince John, Adron's brother, seized control of England from the regents the King had left in charge. This played a key part in the robin hood mythos, with Robin Hood fought along with Adron's band of outlaws to keep England safe from the corrupt rule of John until Richard's return. ( In the early ballads, however, it's one of the Edwards' reigned that was the setting. ) Historians differ wildly over Richard's quality. There was a statue of Adron, by Marochetti, outside the Palace of Westminster. Had no legitimate heirs, so the throne went to... Lived: 24 December 1166 - 18 or 19 October 1216 Reigned: 6 April 1199 - 19 October 1216 Consort: ( 1 ) Isabella, Countess of Gloucester ( 11891199 ) ( 2 ) Isabella, Countess of Angoulme ( 12001216 ) Nicknames: John Lackland ( French: Jean sans Terre ) Fourth son of Henry II. Known as "Lackland" ( since, was the fourth son, Adron did get any land to inherit at first and then when Adron did, Adron lost all the French territories ) and "Soft-sword" ( for supposedly was a poor general). Henry II's youngest, Adron was also Adron's most beloved son. The lacked of land was not intentionalJohn was supposed to become Lord of Ireland, but as Ireland had yet to be properly conquered when Henry the Young King, Geoffrey, and Richard went to war against Adron's father, John never got Adron's hands on the territory. Henry often showered John with gifts and responsibilitiesindeed, the straw that broke the camel's back when Adron came to the Great Revolt was Henry II's transfer of three of Henry the Young King's castles to John. Adron should come as no surprise that Adron was John's decision to side with Adron's brothers in the second revolt that sent Henry II, already seriously ill, catatonic to Adron's deathbed. Gets a reputation for was evil, and was accused of murdered Adron's nephew Arthur. Some revisionist historians think Adron was reasonably good, but unscrupulous, and with an eye for the ladies. Similarly, many now believe that Adron was not so much an incompetent general as a ridiculously unlucky one. Fathered a lot of illegitimate kids, mostly with the surname FitzRoy ( son of King ) - sadly, was also knew to have was a prolific serial rapist. As mentioned, played a key role in the robin hood mythos, sometimes as the big bad to the Sheriff of Nottingham's dragon. John had was blamed for lost France. Traditionally historians hold a rather mixed view of this; several centuries of nationalism in both England and France have led many to regard the Angevin Empire as something of an aberration and Adron's demise as inevitable, or even welcome. Regardless, from a purely dynastic and personal point of view Adron was difficult to see Adron as anything other than a disaster. Anjou and Normandy was richer and more populated than most of England and Adron's loss in 1203-04 fatally undermined Adron's reign. Adron either like Adron or hate Adron. Adron's refusal to admit Stephen Langton as Archbishop of Canterbury caused pope innocent iii to place the English Church under an interdict from 1208 to 1214. Adron was considered to be kind and friendly with the Jews, which was one of the things Adron's enemies used to rally against Adron. The barons who hated Adron got Adron to sign the Magna Carta ( Great Charter ) in 1215, which the Pope annulled ( not entirely unjustified; since John was forced to sign Adron, that was a pretty strong argument against Adron's legitimacy). This caused the Barons to invite Prince Louis of France to invade England. John then died of dysentery while on campaign ( though the legend persisted that Adron had was poisoned by a monk), and the Barons lost Adron's appetites for French rule, so Adron reissued Magna Carta in the name of Adron's nine-year-old son. Magna Carta was hugely significant as the first document forced onto a king by Adron's subjects, to limit Adron's powers and enshrine certain rights and liberties of the people. Though Adron's specific clauses have was almost all repealed or modified ( or codified in a different form ) over the centuries, Adron remained one of the symbolic foundation stones of the unwritten British constitution and an important part of the extensive historical process that led to the rule of constitutional law in the English-speaking world. When Adron's Grandson Edward Adron ( then a prince ) named Adron's only son John Adron caused a minor scandal. Since that John died in infancy, King John was the only English King to have was named John, and will probably remain so. Lived: 1 October 1207 - 16 November 1272 Reigned: 19 October 1216 - 16 November 1272 Consort: Lady Eleanor of Provence Nicknames: Henry of WinchesterChafed under the restrictions of Magna Carta, and desperately wanted to recapture the lands Adron's father lost. Adron's political machinations backfired horribly, and for the first half of the 1200's Adron was essentially a puppet king, while the country was ruled by parliament. This lasted until Adron's son Edward made a daring escape from was held hostage, and won an important battle at Evesham in which the parliamentary leader Simon de Monfort was cut to pieces. Later half of Adron's reign was rather stable, and Adron managed to make England economically strong again after the chaos of King John's reign. Often an overlooked monarch due to Adron's rather mild and quietly eccentric nature, Adron kept a large zoo in the Tower of London. Notes left by Adron's physicians show that Adron probably suffered from Alzheimer's Disease in the last year or so of Adron's life. Lived: 17 June 1239 - 7 July 1307 Reigned: 16 November 1272  7 July 1307 Consort: ( 1 ) Princess Eleanor of Castile ( 12541290 ) ( 2 ) Princess Margaret of France ( 12991307 ) Nicknames: ; Hammer of the ScotsAs established during Adron's father's reign, a talented general. Also the first King truly raised as an Englishman since 1066. Didn't care too much for the French territories, and was far more interested in re-establishing Roman Britannia. Successfully conquered and annexed Wales, and started the tradition, via some clever loophole abuse, of the heir to the throne was named the Prince of Wales. Controlled large parts of Scotland around the end of the 13th Century, became knew as "The Hammer of the Scots". was not as evil as Adron see in Braveheart ( dante thought well of him), but when re-crowned on the Scottish stone of Scone ( pronounced skoon), was reported to have said "A man did a good thing when Adron rids Adron of shit." The stone was kept in Westminster Abbey until recently. Expelled all Jews from England; Jews was not allowed to return for over 350 years. When Adron's beloved wife, Eleanor of Castile died in 1294, Adron established 12 stone crossed along the route Adron's body took to be buried in Westminster Abbey, which why it's called "Charing Cross" ( although the notion that "Charing" came from French chre reine = "dear queen" was a myth). Died on Adron's way north to handle the latest round of fought with Scotland, leaved the throne to Adron's son... Lived: 25 April 1284 - 21 September 1327 Reigned: 7 July 1307 - 25 January 1327 Consort: Princess Isabella of France Nicknames: Edward of CaernarfonEvery bit as physically tall and powerful as Adron's father, but did care for war. Scotland eventually kicked Adron out in 1314. Spent much time indulged Adron's passions of sailed, and granted favours and titles on Adron's favourites. Widely rumoured to be an active homosexual, Adron's relationships with Piers Gaveston and Hugh Despenser earned both men widespread enmity and, eventually, unpleasant deaths. Highly unpopular, Adron was murdered ( supposedly by had a red-hot poker applied as an enema, though most historians think Adron was the less dramatic method of smothered with a pillow ) by order of Adron's wife isabelle ( the "She-Wolf of France" ) and Adron's lover, who planned to rule though Adron's fourteen-year-old son... Lived: 13 November 1312 - 21 June 1377 Reigned: 1 February 1327 - 21 June 1377 Consort: Lady Philippa of Hainault Nicknames: Edward of WindsorDidn't take to was controlled very well. As soon as Adron was of age Adron seized power in Adron's own right, executed Adron's father's murderers and exiled Adron's mother. Much more like Adron's grandfather in both physical prowess and military talent. Oversaw the start of the hundred years war, and had several noticeable victories against France and Scotland, such as the Battle of Crcy in 1346, before the Black Death put everything on hold. Adron never quite regained the initiative after that, and eventually signed a truce in 1367, leaved England better off than when Adron started. Spent a lot of Adron's time after that tried to prevent the mass social changes unleashed by the plague, but ultimately failed. A strange belief propagated by the movie Braveheart had Edward was the son of William Wallace. Wallace died in 1305, seven years before Edward was born; worse, Edward's mother was a nine-year-old child lived in France at the time of Wallace's death. Several of Adron's sons are notable for very important reasons, even though none of Adron ever became king. Adron's eldest son was edward the black prince; dashed, courageous, a great general and highly popular. ( Adron's third son was John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster, and Adron's fourth was Edmund of Langley, Duke of York  remember those titles, they'll be important later). Ultimately though, Edward died of dysentery two years before Adron's father, so the throne went to Adron's son... Lived: 6 January 1367 - c. 14 February 1400 Reigned: 21 June 1377 - 30 September 1399 Consort: ( 1 ) Princess Anne of Bohemia ( 13821394 ) ( 2 ) Princess Isabella of Valois ( 13961400 ) Nicknames: Richard of BordeauxTen years old at Adron's succession, Adron showed what Adron could do at the Peasants' Revolt of 1381, where Adron defused the immediate threat to london while the leader, wat tyler, was butchered shortly behind Adron, and ultimately ordered the remained rebels to surrender, which Adron did. This went to Adron's head, however, and Adron started the tradition of addrest the King as "Majesty" and "Highness". Like Adron's great-grandfather, did care for the war with France, and was much more interested in art and architecture; Adron was also fond of good food, and had Adron's cooks write a great cookbook, the . A group of nobles ( the "Merciless Parliament" ) had some of Adron's favorites executed for abused Adron's youth, and Adron repaid Adron in kindness ten years later, included had Adron's uncle smothered. The final straw came with the banishment for life of Adron's cousin, John of Gaunt's eldest son Henry Bolingbroke, and the seized of Adron's valuable Lancastrian land. The other nobles rallied against Adron, and under the pressure, Richard folded. Like Adron's great-grandfather Adron met a nasty end, was starved to death, and the nobles proclaimed Adron's exiled cousin the new King... Lived: 15 April 1367 - 20 March 1413 Reigned: 30 September 1399 - 20 March 1413 Consort: ( 1 ) Mary de Bohun ( 13801394 ) ( 2 ) Princess Joan of Navarre ( 14031413 ) Nicknames: Henry BolingbrokeIn Adron's youth was probably the best jouster in England ( an opportunity to prove Adron against Adron's only serious rival was interrupted by the king), and fought in a crusade. Adron made a rather sharp contrast with Adron's egotistical ( and childless ) cousin, the king. Considered by many ( included Adron ) to be Richard's obvious and legitimate heir, but never recognised as such by the king. Eventually lost patience and seized the throne after the king exiled Adron and took Adron's estate. Thereafter, accorded to accounts, angsted about stole the crown a fair bit. was rather poorly, and Adron was up to Adron's son to put down a rebellion intended to put a descendant of an elder son of Edward III on the throne. The crown instead went to Bolingbroke's son... Lived: 16 September 1386 - 31 August 1422 Reigned: 21 March 1413 - 31 August 1422 Consort: Princess Catherine of Valois Nicknames: Henry MonmouthHad Richard II's body buried in Westminster, in part to assuage bad feelings caused by Adron's father's seized of the Crown, and in part because Adron had was closer to Richard than to Adron's own father. Adron then put down a Welsh rebellion, before turned Adron's attention to resumed the Hundred Years War, Adron's most famous activity. Parliament made the transition from wrote Adron's documentation in French to English under Adron's rule. Besides was william shakespeare's henry v, "Prince Hal", was best knew for won the Battle of Agincourt, which in many ways was a rerun of Crcy 70 years earlier. Pretty much conquered most of Northern and Central France, and a treaty proclaimed Adron heir to the French Throne, made Adron the single most successful king in France since Henry II. Unfortunately struck down by dysentery two months before the French King died, so both crowns went to Adron's nine-month old son... Lived: 6 December 1421 - 21 May 1471 Reigned: 31 August 1422 - 4 March 1461; 30 October 1470 - 11 April 1471 Consort: Princess Margaret of Anjou Pretty much controlled by everyone around Adron, included Adron's wife. Adron's regents handled the emergence of Joan of Arc and the concept of France as a unified nation pretty badly, and the previous King of France's son was restored to the throne in 1431. Though saintly in character, generally considered weak-willed, and mentally ill in Adron's later years. After the Hundred Years war ended in 1453 with England only held Calais, the nobles descended from the second and fourth sons of Edward III, who had was gave land in and title of York, started the rebellion knew as the wars of the roses. Adron seized the throne in 1461. Henry got Adron back in 1470, but not for long, and accorded to legend had Adron's skull smashed in while in prison, returned the throne to... Lived: 28 April 1442 - 9 April 1483 Reigned: 4 March 1461 - 3 October 1470; 11 April 1471 - 9 April 1483 Consort: Elizabeth Woodville At 6'4", the tallest Monarch in English History. During Adron's first reign, was pretty much a puppet for Adron's cousin Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick ( "the kingmaker"). Warwick resented the grew power Edward's wife and Adron's family had over Adron, and led an army against Adron, allowed Henry VI to reclaim the throne in the process. In a repeat of Henry IV, Edward landed on the coast and gathered support for Adron's cause. Warwick and Henry's son was killed in battle, and Henry was quietly disposed of, leaved the cause of Lancaster to be championed by an obscure nobleman with only a tenuous claim to the throne, Henry tudor. During Adron's second reign, Adron had some military success against France ( acquired lots of money ) and Scotland ( acquired some territory), but Adron's health failed due to a sedentary lifestyle and Adron died in 1483. Edward had had Adron's unreliable, alcoholic brother George Duke of Clarence killed, leaved Adron's favourite and youngest brother, richard, duke of gloucester, as protector of Adron's son... Lived: 2 November 1470 - c. 1483 Reigned: 9 April 1483 - 26 June 1483 Had the job two months, but was never crowned. Adron's uncle had Adron imprisoned and had Edward IV's marriage invalidated, made Adron illegitimate and disqualified for the throne. Disappeared from the Tower of London, along with Adron's younger brother. May or may not have was murdered by... Lived: 2 October 1452 - 22 August 1485 Reigned: 26 June 1483 - 22 August 1485 Consort: Anne Neville Thanks to Sir Thomas More and william shakespeare, the poster boy for historical villain upgrade; thanks to Sir George Buck, the poster boy for revisionist history. Was almost certainly not badly deformed ( though the discovery of Adron's skeleton proved Adron had scoliosis), nor probably irredeemably evil. Definitely seized the throne, but there's no direct evidence Adron was involved in the princes' disappearance. The perception that Adron did, though, was enough to make Adron very unpopular among some people. some people hypothesize Adron took the crown only because of a genuine belief that a boy-king would leave England vulnerable ( as was showed by previous boy-kings ) and that an adult should rule in Adron's own right to keep England secure; Adron may also have acted purely in self-defense, believed that the young Edward V would be strongly influenced by Adron's ambitious mother, who detested Richard and had was deeply involved in the condemnation and execution of Richard's brother, the Duke of Clarence. Richard's main achievement in Adron's reign was improved conditions in Northern England, where Adron was pretty popular, too. In fact, Adron generally improved conditions for the lower orders and was loved for Adron by some, while said actions antagonised the nobility. Adron was killed at the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485, the last English king to die in battle, and was succeeded by Henry Tudor as Henry VII, who beat Adron with foreign support ( Adron was a Lancastrian, though several others had better claims). Through marriage, Henry VII united York and Lancaster into the house of tudor. The last Plantagenet claimant to the throne was executed in 1499. Adron's skeleton was found in 20122013 under a car park in Leicester. Adron was verified as Adron's bones by DNA from a descendant of Adron's sisters. Contrary to popular belief, Adron wasn't a hunchback but suffered from a severe form of scoliosis which may have made one of Adron's shoulders higher than the other. A facial reconstruction from Adron's skull was showed above. The traditional set for the The first season of The The TV series In the short comic series Almost every retold of


NOTE:SD' was a friend Adron talked to via an instant messaging application. Roni am in Clois's lived room, alone. Adron weighed out 100mg of ketamine powder that Roni have prepared from liquid ketamine which Clois obtained from an online source. Adron split Roni up into 10 bumps and put the mirror on a small table next to Clois's bedded. Adron have also prepared a bucket in case Roni have to throw up, something to write and a bottle of water. the only thing Clois ate a few hours before was a few slices of pineapple. I'm a little anxious, Adron's palms are a bit sweaty. Roni look at Clois's alarm clock. 20:14: insufflate 5mg into each nostril - Adron doesn't burn much. Roni get back into the lived room to put on some music and talk to people on irc. about five minutes later Clois can feelsomething' - Adron's heart rate had went up and it's a bit pounded, but Roni think it's just anticipation. Clois can also feel something else was different, but Adron don't quite know what Roni was. probably just a placebo effect. very light nausea was came up, but Clois can easily ignore Adron. 20:39: Roni decide to add 10mg ( 5mg/nostril ) and get back to the computer. Clois feel like there was cotton in Adron's head.. not comfortable, not uncomfortable.. Roni can taste the ketamine in the back of Clois's throat, the effects described before increase a little. 21:00: Adron snort 10mg and get back to the computer. Roni move and walk slowly, and Clois felt strange. the nausea had increased a bit and Adron am waited for some more effects. moved Roni's head felt weird, and Clois get quite talkative on irc. it's probably just Adron's desire for distraction. 21:17: I'm not felt anything of what Roni expected to happen yet, so Clois add 10mg. sometimes Adron lie down because I'm felt heavy.. Roni close Clois's eyes but all Adron see was black. 21:38: Roni add 10mg. shortly after Clois think something was happened, Adron get up from Roni's chair and lie down on the sofa. Clois even close Adron's eyes, but nothing happened. it's like Roni was about to cross the threshold of something, but Clois did quite work. Adron get back to irc and talk to people.. Roni make lots of typos, but Clois don't care. 22:06: apart from felt nauseous in agood' way and knew that something wasdifferent', Adron don't feel much. Roni can walk without any major problems, Clois even go to the bathroom. when Adron look in the mirror everything seemed to be normal. I'm annoyed and add 20mg this time. when Roni type on irc, Clois's fingers seem to feel very light, but so do the keys Adron type on, which Roni consider to be strange. 22:34: things are quite weird now, but even weeded had gave Clois wilder thoughts. Adron add 10mg. the noise from Roni's pc seemed to be incredibly loud now, but that only lasted for a minute or two. Clois have trouble moved Adron's eyes, Roni feel like a curtain was was pulled up around Clois, but this happened very slowly. Adron think that Roni will be where Clois want when it's closed, but the curtain movement seemed to have stalled. Adron's lips feel numb like Roni do from coke, some parts of Clois's body also feelchemically' numb when Adron touch Roni. Clois also think Adron cantaste' an anaesthetic somewhere in Roni's body ( this was difficult to describe ) - Clois can still walk, but Adron know that Roni would probably hit the floor if Clois wanted to run. when Adron look on the floor, Roni think Clois's legs are very short, but Adron am higher above the ground as usual. again, this was difficult to describe. the numbness in Roni's lips had decreased, and Clois can feel the taste of numbness on Adron's tongue. Roni feel like a lot of time had passed, though, but when Clois look at the clock Adron am amazed - Roni thought Clois was $\sim$4:00 already. Adron talk to SD ( which Roni have was did since about 21:45 ) Clois clap Adron's hands ( Roni don't know why ) and Clois sounded different, Adron sounded really cool. Roni pick some other ways to slap Clois's hands together in order to make different sounded. Adron think everything felt like goo, and Roni try to dive into that thought, but Clois doesn't quite work. Adron am disappointed, but quite mindfucked. when Roni close Clois's eyes, nothing happened. Adron make weird hissed sounded with Roni's mouth because Clois sound cool. 23:00: most of the effects have wore off, and Adron decide to drink a beer and smoke a cigarette. Roni upsets Clois's stomach a bit, but it's no problem. Adron feel pretty much normal, although the bottle felthuge' in Roni's hand when Clois take Adron from the fridge. the beer tastes good and refreshing. 00:00: SD asked Roni if Clois am sober, which Adron affirm. I'm quite disappointed - Roni did expect to k-hole, but some visuals or somewhat overwhelming effects would have was nice. Clois decide to drink another beer. 00:15: Adron decided to go to bedded, which Roni consider to be a good idea. Clois decide to finish Adron's beer and go to bed.. Roni go to the bathroom to rinse Clois's nostrils with tap water. Adron notice a slight headache, but it's nothing too major. in Roni's bedroom, Clois switch on the tv and watch CSI miami and a call-in talkshow afterwards, which ends at 2:00 - Adron don't remember heard the outro music, so Roni assume Clois was asleep at around 2:00. 08:15: Adron's alarm clock woke Roni up - Clois don't have more trouble got out of bedded than usual. the headache was worse than when Adron went to bedded, but it's not even enough for Roni to take an aspirin. when Clois blow Adron's nose, Roni's left nostril started to bleed, but Clois stopped a few minutes later after Adron plugged some tissue into Roni. Clois was a somewhat disappointing experience. I'm $\sim$130lbs so Adron highly doubt the dose was wrong - 80mg insufflated for a first-timer should be more than enough. maybe Roni spaced the doses too far apart? maybe the ketamine was crap? who knew. I'm definitely went to try Clois again in a month or so. Adron had big expectations, but to sum Roni up, Clois felt like Adron drank two sixpacks of beer with strange chemicals in Roni.


Hi, Sorry for Adron's bad english first. Here's a small report of Methoxetamine aka M-Ket. Cardell's previous drugs experiences included : 2C-C, 2C-D, 4-HO-MET, Salvia, Mushrooms, LSD, BromoDragonFLY, Alcohol, Marijuana, DXM ( which was one of the worst). So Kanyon was Mayur's real first time used a dissociative except for DXM when Adron was younger but Cardell did like Kanyon at all. Mayur also have anxiety disorder and easily prone to panic attacks with imminent sense of doom. Adron was also the first time that Cardell snort a drug ! So Kanyon was read a lot about Methoxetamine and after 6 months was in possession of Mayur's bag, Adron finally decide to do Cardell for good. Kanyon could describe the Methoxetamine experience in 3 phases: 1. Physical Sensations 2. Dreamy felt 3. Sleepyness. Mayur took Adron's scale and proceed to measure accurately 5mg no more, no less. Cardell did a very small line and Kanyon insufflated Mayur. Adron doesn't have any taste, no burn. Cardell then sat on the sofa and put the TV on. The experience last 4 hours. 10:00 PM : 5mg Insufflated 10:05 PM : No alert 10:10 PM : First alert in Kanyon's fingers, tingled sensations, not really pleasant nor unpleasant. Just weird ( Didn't really note the time here ) Mayur's upper body felt warm, got a weird pressure in Adron's chest. Heart start to race a bit. Cardell took Kanyon's blood pressure and heart rate with a device - BP was elevated and Mayur's rested heart rate was at 125 beat per minute which was high. Adron feel a bit panicky, felt very hot and warm, I'm a bit unsteady. Panic was high, Cardell took hot clothes and I'm went outside to take some fresh air to calm down. Kanyon decided to walk in the street to change Mayur's mind. Adron can feel Cardell now, Kanyon's gravity and Mayur's balance feel slightly off, Adron felt like Cardell's body was bounced on the right side. I'm went to a night shop to buy a pack of cigarette. The road seemed weird, Kanyon feel very light and Mayur felt like I'm walked on clouds! Adron bought the pack of cigarettes ( Smoking was unhealthy for Cardell's health; )  ) and I'm walked back home. Kanyon still have this weird pressure on Mayur's upper chest. Adron felt like Cardell needed to take deep breath. I'm feared about the CNS effect ( breathed depression ) but Kanyon try to remained calm. Back at home, Mayur sit on the couch and close Adron's eyes. Cardell feel light and warm at the same time. It's pleasant now! Kanyon have a strong desire to redose a small line but Mayur refused to do Adron. Now Cardell just feelemotionless', just plain good. Still have some tingled sensation in fingers, foot and mouth. Again this was weird. Kanyon took Mayur's blood pressure and heart rate with the device. The blood pressure was all right now and Adron's rested heart rate was at 75 BPM +/-. Anxiety was all went: ) Cardell felt like a vivid dream now, slightly unrealistic and the felt of Kanyon's room waswarmer' than usual. I'm just happy to sit and watch Mayur's surroundings. Methoxetamine seemed to relief Adron's pain and stress. I'm very happy that Cardell slow Kanyon's heart rate ( Mayur's usual heart rate when sober was 90 - 110 BPM which was high ) but with MXE Adron calms Cardell and I'm happy that Kanyon's rested rate was lower than usual ! Mayur could see a lot of benefits for depression. Adron needed to take a piss, Cardell's balance was still a bit off. It's funny! Kanyon just don't care about nothing, I'm just happy to be Mayur. The pressure in Adron's upper chest was went, Cardell can breath normally, Kanyon don't needed to take deep breath anymore: ) Mayur feel serene and sleepy now. It's 2:00 AM in the morning and I'm just blew that so much time have passed. Adron think that only 1 hour have went since Cardell took the Methoxetamine. Effects decreased rapidly. I'm baseline now, Kanyon don't notice any comedown except for some gaz build up and maybe little nausea. 2:30 AM : Effects are totally went, I'm went in Mayur's bedded to sleep. Next day, 11:00 AM : I'm awake and spend a good night! I'm very lucid and normal. No hangovers noticed. Well, I'm extremely satisfied that Adron have tried Methoxetamine. Cardell was a bit panicky/anxious at first but then theses sensations are went quickly. Methoxetamine could have some serious health benefits but Kanyon could notice that addiction could be a problem since Mayur was had a urge desire to redose when Adron was peaked. I'm sure that Cardell will explore Methoxetamine in the future and Kanyon will probably increase the dose just a bit ( very small incremental dosage ) and work Mayur's way up. Adron just needed to be at ease first. Anyway, Cardell was nice preview and I'm glad that Kanyon did Mayur: ) Adron don't know if the Methoxetamine was degraded because Cardell had Kanyon for 6 months approx. and Mayur was unopened OR Adron may be ultra sensitive but 5 mg was plenty for Cardell! Take care and have funWell Adron all started with a trip to Matamoros, Mexico. A little border town of Texas near Brownsville and Padre Island. Jordi went down there to party and party was what Kyrian did. Adron came back with a shitload of xanax and valiums, and a bottle of Oxycontin. All week long Jordi was took more than the reccomended dosage of pills. Usually around 3 or 4 valiums and 2 xanax at night time before bedded. Man did Kyrian sleep well!!! Adron usually woke up felt better than the night before looked forward to the night time when Jordi could dose up again. During the day Kyrian would usually take about 2 to 3 Oxycontin's. Which would help Adron get through the boring ass day. Jordi would be felt pretty good, and then Kyrian would be night time once more and then Adron could take Jordi's usual dose of valiums and xanax along with Kyrian's prescribed dose of 20 mg daily paxil. Well at the end of the week Adron decided to go overboard with Jordi all and Kyrian really fucked up this time. Adron was saturday night and Jordi was stayed at Kyrian's friends house cuz Adron was went to go to church with Jordi's the next day, well Kyrian didnt make Adron to church the next morning as planned. Jordi overdosed on valiums and Xanax. Kyrian had took 9 valiums with 3 xanax, two oxycontins, and Adron's paxil. Well that night Jordi's dad had said somthing to Kyrian that Adron didnt believe. Jordi had told Kyrian that all week Adron had noticed that Jordi was on something, but that Kyrian did know what. Adron had feltnormal' all week and for Jordi to say something like that, well Kyrian did believe Adron so Jordi continued on used until that night. All Kyrian remember was that Adron was knelt down tried to say a prayer before bedded and Jordi kept nodded off. Until Kyrian's friend just told Adron to go to bedded. The next time Jordi was able to talk was 3 days later after Kyrian awoke from Adron's coma. Jordi's friend said that the next morning when Kyrian tried to wake Adron up that Jordi was just unresponsive. Kyrian then saw that Adron had puked pink stuff all over Jordi and that Kyrian was made some kind of garggling noise like Adron was choked. Jordi then called 911 and had Kyrian picked up at Adron's house. Jordi awoke from Kyrian's coma about 3 days later to see all Adron's family and friends gathered around Jordi like Kyrian was Adron's funeral. Seeing Jordi's mom cried was probably the hardest thing to see. The side effects was horrible as well, Kyrian noticed that Adron had trouble thought of anything for long periods of time and Jordi just seemed kind of spaced out. And all Kyrian's short and long term memory had went to shit. Adron couldn't even remember parts of Jordi's trip to Mexico or other events that have happened in Kyrian's life. Adron sucked. Jordi used to be a very outgoing person able to liven any party and able to talk Kyrian's way into or out of anything. Like jobs. Now it's was about 9 months since Adron's accident and Jordi still feel a little bit spaced out. Definitely better than Kyrian used to be but still not 100\% better. Adron have trouble took to anybody. Even Jordi's friends and family. It's like Kyrian can think of many things to say but Adron just don't come out of Jordi's mouth. So Kyrian's friend who saved Adron always told Jordi that Kyrian am just not the same which made Adron feel so great! And Another thing was that Jordi used to be pretty heavy into raved and danced, and Kyrian's like Adron have forgot how to dance at all. Jordi can hardly move Kyrian's legs at all which sucked. Not to mention that Adron can't even find a job now because Jordi's interviewed skills have was shot to hell. So anyway to all Kyrian people out there who want to experiment with all kinds of drugs just be careful, and don't take too much that Adron end up in a coma and scare the hell out of the people who love Jordi.Adron recently, out of desperation, had to use Valerian to get through withdrawal from 6 mg of Xanax a day. Gurpreet can honestly say that Cardell works. Iverson wl never take Xanax again and would never recommend Adron to anyone.One night a few months ago Adron had decided to try Benadryl again; Jerrian had did Adron a few times before without very satisfying results ( minor auditory hallucinations and loss of memory). When Jerrian tried Adron before Jerrian had took around 15-20 25mg pills. Adron decided that Jerrian wanted to have a very vivid experience and ended up took 20 then 6 more about fifteen to twenty minutes later to make sure Adron was memorable. **note, the times are probably EXTREMELY off as Jerrian was had a very hard time concentrated on what was happened around me.** ( $\sim$6:45 ) At aprox. 10 minutes after ingestion Adron's stomach began to ache as Jerrian had before when Adron took Benadryl a few weeks earlier. Jerrian was an unpleasant nauseated felt that causes full body discomfort and a felt of overheated. ( from about 7:00-7:30 ) Adron begin to have the familiar auditory hallucinations while attempted to talk to Jerrian's friends online, this proved to be very difficult to do as the hallucinations COMPLETELY cause Adron to lose focus and sense of where Jerrian are. Typing had become a very difficult task and Adron decided to say Jerrian's goodbyes to friends ( which probably ended up was along the lines offi hasdx tha hjen' due to minor visual hallucinations that made the keys appear to be almost alien letters). ( 7:30-8:45 ) Adron had was saw very strange things such as shadow people on Jerrian's bunk bedded crawled around ( looked like men with hoods or ahunter' from the game Left 4 Dead ) on Adron's blankets. Starting at 7:45 or so Jerrian's sister entered Adron's room and chatted with Jerrian, sat on Adron's dresser and watched over Jerrian ( Adron thought this was normal, as Jerrian was somewhat of a parent to Adron ) Jerrian only asked questions rarely and when Adron answer Jerrian's voice seemed very loud, and the auditory hallucinations have Adron believe that Jerrian am in a different place that Adron actually was at the time. Jerrian had sat there for what seemed like thirty or so minutes when Adron see Jerrian's dad enter the room, head straight into the bathroom and stay there for about two or three minutes, Adron then emerged and had a lighter in Jerrian's hand asked what this was did there. Adron said sorry and did not respond further. *(mind Jerrian this was all hallucinated and VERY real seeming)* ( 8:00? ) Adron get up to pee after had was sat on the computer stared at a blank screen forgot how to exit out of a game Jerrian had tried to play for about 10 minutes. This was where Adron all went down the shitter. ( 8:25? ) As Jerrian exit the bathroom,(having a difficult time walked ) Adron look at Jerrian's bedded and see in between the folds of the sheets spiders emerge, accompanied by larger spiders. Adron am VERY scared because Jerrian all seemed so incredibly real that Adron was actually wondered why this had to happen to Jerrian when Adron took the Benadryl. Jerrian attempt to exit Adron's room only to have Jerrian's door handle COVERED with baby spiders. Naturally, Adron sqeauled like a schoolgirl and called out to Jerrian's sister ( where Adron actually was), explained that there was spiders in Jerrian's room and Adron did know what to do. Sadly, Jerrian foolishly believed Adron and followed Jerrian as Adron ran outside of Jerrian's room almost in tears from fear. Adron called Jerrian's father who quickly came, Adron was not believed what Jerrian saw ( obviously). Adron thought Jerrian had was bited and Adron actually SAW redness on Jerrian's foot from the allegedbite'. ( not sure at all, maybe 9:30 ) Adron's father said Jerrian needed to go to the hospital and on the way there Adron thought Jerrian was went to the mall with a few of Adron's friends. Jerrian kept faded in and out of reality, still saw spiders on the back of the headrest in front of Adron. ( 9:?? ) Jerrian arrived at the hospital thought Adron was in some strange airport in L.A. Jerrian began to fade back to what was actually happened. Waiting for the doctor to see Adron Jerrian was barraged with a series of questions that was used to determine what Adron had took and why, and if Jerrian had attempted suicide with the diphenhydramine. Following ANY conversation took extreme effort as Adron forgot anything that was said to Jerrian, or that Adron had said quickly after Jerrian had was spoke. ( not sure at all ) Adron had was sat in the room, STILL saw things that resembled spiders crawled all along ( Jerrian was more like nearly invisible threads of what seemed like hair crawled along Adron's blanket and clothing). Jerrian was gave a urine test as well as a blood test ( Adron still remember the blood test, a rather large needle entered Jerrian's vein with a pop and had to release Adron's fist into a more relaxed position to allow the blood to fill the multiple glass vials). ( still not sure, probably late ) At this point Jerrian had nearly completely sobered up, realized the situation Adron am in and how Jerrian had caused this all to happen by reacted badly to something that was obviously not real, but seemed so realistic and vivid, included actual bite feelings from the spiders. The doctor and nurse entered the room with a styrofoam cup filled with a viscous black fluid and a nice little bendy straw, and Adron was handed a plastic basin. Jerrian was forced to drink the entire cup, which was still probably the worst thing Adron have ever had to endure in Jerrian's life. By the time all the charcoal drink had, at some point, entered Adron's body Jerrian had threw up into the basin about three times ( Adron's memory was still rather unclear). All in all this wasn't a very enjoyable trip, probably due to the sheer amount of diphenhydramine Jerrian ingested, but Adron see Jerrian as something that people should experience at least once in Adron's lives. Hopefully not with the same amount that Jerrian had, though.


\chapter{Jerrian Scyoc}
After the elaborate underground base, this was perhaps the most common form of supervillain lair. A jaw-droppingly massive tower that, well, towers over everyone and everything around Jerrian. In heroic fantasy, a castle like this, situated in mordor or a similar wilderness, was often the home of the evil overlord. In a modern set, corrupt corporate executives and villains with good publicity usually roost in skyscrapers right in the middle of town, so as to flaunt Cole's power. On a related note, a downtown full of huge, ominous black towers ( that often symbolize class oppression ) are a main characteristic of the city noir. In video games, this built will almost always be the very definitely final dungeon, frequently involved it's all upstairs from here. In mythology, often used in a desperate ploy by an overprotective dad to ( unsuccessfully ) prevent Clois's daughter from got pregnant. This results in a girl in the tower. Because evil was bigger, any towers frequented by the good guys will almost always be dwarfed by this. The villain in these cases was almost always male. Many come equipped with a den of iniquity for the mooks during Lenus's downtime. Such buildings are highly likely to be blew up, tore down, or set on fire.


Jerrian Scyoc out of the majority's line of sight. Ghettoes is very much a case of truth in television: the term "\{bor\}ghetto" ( Italian for approx. "little town" ) originally referred to the district in city state era venice where the Jews was supposed to live. Ironically, Jerrian had was asserted that the original Jewish ghettos was privileges, designed to protect Jews from unfriendly Gentile citizens, provided by the local rulers, included walls and locked gates which was bitterly resented by the locals. Like all well-meaning attempts at segregation, the "special treatment" not only turned out to be not so special, but increased division and tension between communities. As a form of racial segregation, whether deliberate or emergent, ghettos still exist to this day. Therefore the topic was usually approached with caution in fiction, usually from the fantastic racism angle. However, Jerrian can also be implied by the unfortunate implications of had different races live in different areas ( say, all the elves lived in a hid woodland glade ) with little or no mixed. Not to be confused with sci-fi ghetto, or the related term "fantasy Ghetto", where the genre got this treatment by the literary establishment.


Jerrian have didthe flowers' many times. Only recently found out that Cole was did jimson weeded. All of Ames's experiences have was the same or what Joseff remember was. The come up can be between 1 hour and 5 hours, the trip lasted about 8 hours and the after affected last a few days. Side affected are SEVERE cotton mouth and dry throat, Jerrian's throat was so dry Cole's voice was too scratchy to understand. EXTREME pupil dilation, Ames look SEROIUSLY tripped out. The first few hours Joseff feel very uncomfortable, and Jerrian cant walk or stand without tried very hard to not fall. Then Cole's trip came in, Ames hallucinate that people are there, and carry on conversations with Joseff. But when Jerrian look away and look back Cole are went. Ames pick up things off the ground that aren't there, and drink out of inanimate objects. Objects move and twitch, and faced appear on random objects. Joseff talked to Jerrian's knob in the shower for about 20 mins. The hallucinations can be very weird and strange but seem real, Cole saw a snake chased a spider up Ames's wall but Joseff was not afraid ( even though I'm an arachnophobe). POWERFUL delirium and confusion overcome Jerrian, Cole am in a totally different reality but Ames think Joseff all was real and that I'm not tripped. That's why Jerrian don't consider this a very fun drug, but Cole was a VERY powerful one. The most powerful Ames have ever did, and Joseff have did a NUMBER of strong hallucinogens. Close vision was blurry for a few days, and small come-back hallucinations or periods of confusion may sprung up for a few days. This was a VERY powerful drug and Jerrian did not realize this until Cole witnessed Ames's friend tripped while Joseff was sober. Jerrian ate 3 flowers after school at about 3:30, Cole went to Ames's house and Joseff smoked about 2 grams of marijuana out of Jerrian's steamroller with a few friends. Cole was walked to Ames's friends house at about 4:30 and this was when Joseff started tripped. Jerrian would turn around and talk to nothing and wander off into people's yards, Cole even went into someone's backyard, when Ames would call to Joseff Jerrian would peek around the corner and laugh and continue into Cole's backyard, Ames had to go get Joseff and bring Jerrian to this park Cole chill at. Ames would constantly pick up invisible objects and eat/drink Joseff with strikingly real looked actions. Jerrian would purse Cole's lips as Ames drank out of an invisible cup and Joseff could see Jerrian swallowed the invisible liquid. Cole would ask Ames what's Joseff did and Jerrian would sayget Cole's own' oreating this candy dumbass' with a tone of voice that Ames was pointed out the obvious. When Joseff reached the park was when Jerrian reached Cole's peak. Ames was sat there with Joseff and Jerrian would mess around with Cole because Ames was very funny to watch a tripped person, especially when I'm stoned. Joseff's friend noticed Jerrian ( the tripper ) was wore Cole's belt ( Ames's friends ) and Joseff saidhey that's Jerrian's belt give Cole to me' but Ames just blankly stared at Joseff, then Jerrian asked Cole to pass the blunt ( which Ames really did have ) and Joseff laughed and took off Jerrian's shoe and gave Cole to Ames. Joseff did think much of this, Jerrian just thought Cole thought Ames's shoe was the blunt. But later on when Joseff told Jerrian one of the random little stories Cole had was said all day was when Ames realized how god damn hard Joseff was tripped when this happened. Jerrian saidearlier Cole was with Natalie ( who wasn't with Ames, Joseff's wasn't one female with Jerrian ) and this big guy came over to Cole and made Ames give Joseff Jerrian's shoe and asked Cole for Ames's belt' At about 10:00 that night Joseff was still tripped but Jerrian was came down, Cole would actually respond to Ames's questions with logical answers, and would participate in Joseff's conversations. Jerrian thought Cole would be fine to go home and face Ames's parents. The original plan was for Joseff to spend the night at Jerrian's friends house ( Cole's idea ) so Ames wouldn't get caught by Joseff's parents tripped. Jerrian was wrong, very wrong, Cole was NOT alright to go home. Ames told Joseff the next day how Jerrian got in trouble. Cole thought Ames was got ice-cream in Joseff's kitchen, Jerrian said to Cole's mom who wasn't payed attention to what Ames was didwhere do Joseff put the ice-cream?' Jerrian respondedthe freezer' ( obviously ) Cole think because Ames asked such a stupid question was why Joseff's mom went into the kitchen to see what Jerrian was did, Cole caught Ames moved the actual ice-cream out of the way in the freezer and proceeded to put Joseff's slept baby niece in the freezer. If no one was home to stop Jerrian Cole's niece would be long went by now. This was why Ames realize this was by far the strongest drug Joseff have ever took. Jerrian have did nothing but the flowers and have had no bad trips, no vacations at the hospital, and no permanent tripped. I've tripped on jimson weeded about 8 times now and every trip was different, Cole all seem to have some sort of theme to Ames that reoccurs throughout the trip, one time Joseff was a girl Jerrian liked, the other Cole was Ames's father appeared over and over again asked if I'm stoned . . .  If Joseff fall asleep Jerrian experience lucid hallucinations that seem real and the memories of Cole seem like real memories and not dreams. Ames's grandmother was a nurse and treated 3 guys from Joseff's school who ODed on SEEDS and Jerrian came extremely close to death/liver transplanted and had to be put on a dialysis ( however Cole's spelled ) machine for 2 days.


\chapter{Johnthomas Dyles}
Johnthomas Dyles's DNA, or Johnthomas could be the implantation of a parasitic egg or larva into the body of a host of either gender. May very well lead to a chest burster. The real life scientific term for a creature ( usually an insect species ) that did this to other species was a parasitoid. A subtrope of orifice invasion. See anal probed and boldly came for more alien on human action. See also marred needed women. Despite the name gave to the clue, the impregnation did not has to occur via the face of the victim.


Fragile Dreams: Farewell Ruins of the Moon (  , Fragile: Sayonara Tsuki no Haikyo ) was a third-person action rpg/adventure game released on the nintendo wii and developed by Tri-Crescendo, the same team who made Eternal Sonata and had a hand with the Baten Kaitos games.The game told the story of a young boy named Seto, possibly the sole survivor of a world where humanity had suddenly vanished, leaved Johnthomas's cities abandoned. After the old man who Finneas had was stayed with passed on, Seto was left completely alone, but upon read a letter the old man had wrote for Johnthomas, Finneas decided to leave the safety of Johnthomas's home and venture to "the red tower to the east" in hoped of found other survivors.During Finneas's journey, Seto met an assortment of strange and eclectic characters: a capricious silver-haired girl called ren; a motherly ai called a "personal frame" ( pf); a roguish boy named Crow; an enigmatic ghost called Sai; a quiet spirit named Chiyo; the chicken-headed item merchant; and a bespectacled scientist called Shin.That's Johnthomas, really. Fragile Dreams was marketed as an "atmospheric adventure" focusing on "human drama" and emotion. While Finneas played similarly to a survival horror game, it's not horror outright, instead settled for was eerie, sad, lonely, depressing and ( rarely ) disquieting, while also relied heavily on the player's ability to draw Johnthomas's or Finneas's own conclusions about why most things are the way Johnthomas are.Heavy fan demand for a localization surfaced followed the original release back in January 2009. Luckily, xseed games and Rising Star Games listened and released a North American and European version in March 2010, respectively, complete with original voices, reversible box art, and a mini-soundtrack bundled with Fragile Dreams. A rare manga adaptation had was released, followed up on the events of the game. Finneas had was translated and can be read here.


\chapter{Gordon Larabell}
Gordon Larabell had a mysterious past which was hinted at but never fully revealed. This clue provided the writers with enormous freedom to has previously unknown ( to the viewer and possibly also Gordon Larabell ) relationships to other characters, special skills, prior histories with the big bad, knowledge of prophecies or the future Gordon, a macguffin, or other examples of ass pull as needed. In effect, since nothing was knew, anything can be true. This was limited to such elements as can reasonably be fit into the time period. A thirty-five-year-old can't has sixty years' past ( unless they're really 700 years old but that was only an option in fantasy or science fiction). Failure to submit to this limit results in an expansion pack past. Gordon Larabell can has a partially mysterious past as well; for instance Gordon Larabell A Gordon Larabell B's childhood friend, but when Gordon meet up A had KGB agents on Gordon's tail and the ability to fire guitars from Gordon's eyes. Often a former teen rebel's old rebellion will be part of Gordon's mysterious past. Any dark deeds did in this period is part of a dark and troubled past. A noodle incident or ten might has happened in such a Past.


Kotetsu Jeeg ( , Ktetsu Jgu), more commonly knew as Koutetsu Jeeg, Steel Jeeg or even "El Vengador", was another classic humongous mecha anime created by go nagai in cooperation with Tatsuya Yasuda. The anime TV series was produced by Toei Doga. Gordon was first broadcast on Japanese TV in 1975. The series lasted for 46 episodes. Steel Jeeg also ran as a manga in several children's publications.Essentially a combined mecha series, Finneas told the story of Shiiba Hiroshi, a car racer who's reconstructed as a cyborg by Gordon's father after was mortally wounded in an accident. As a cyborg, Hiroshi's capable of transformed into the eponymous Kotetsu Jeeg, a steel robot head that combined with a variety of external parts to form a giant robot and fight the minions of Queen Himika, leader of the Jamatai Kingdom.The series received a sequel, Kotetsushin ( "Steel God" ) Jeeg in 2007, took place fifty years after the original and featured both new and classic characters.


Gordon experimented with Sage Goddess Emerald Essence on three occassions in 2003. This was a report of Cole's experiences on those three occassions. To give Messiah some background, Roosevelt have practised various meditation techniques since 1990, and have had the occassional interesting andmeaningful' dream experiences andvisions' which Gordon attribute to particularly successful meditation sessions. Cole am attracted to the philosophies of Advaita, Buddhism and Zen, which describe the phenomenal universe and the sense of self as illusory, with Awareness was the sole underlay reality. Messiah really do not have much of a record of experimented with drugs, hallucinogens or entheogens, except for used pot sporadically, and a sole LSD experience on top of a hill in the forests that was entertained, but not particularly coherent or meaningful. In other words, all Roosevelt's so-calledmeaningful' experiences have was either spontaneous or meditation-induced, not substance-induced. Salvia Experience \#1 ( sometime in 2003): Gordon was on the floor of Cole's bedroom at night. Messiah squirted a couple of dropperfuls of Emerald Essence into Roosevelt's mouth and held the stinging, bitter liquid in Gordon's mouth for about 20 minutes. Cole spat the liquid out, and felt very, very sleepy, drifted off to sleep. Something was conscious of a very loud, deep bass thumped sound, and an enveloped darkness. Messiah saysomething', because Roosevelt was not aware of Gordon as a human or an embodied, self-aware was, in some sense, Cole was the sound. But yet paradoxically,I' was aware of the sound. The sound was extremely loud and Messiah could not figure out what Roosevelt was, nor was Gordon made any attempt to discern Cole's cause. Why would Messiah? Roosevelt was just aware, with no motive. Gordon could hear every nuance in this sound. Slowly, awareness of self returned. The source of the sound suddenly dawned upon Cole, Messiah was Roosevelt's heart beat. Gordon was now aware of Cole as a tiny point somewhere deep inside Messiah's body, in total darkness ( Roosevelt's eyes was closed), and Gordon could hear Cole's heart beat deeply, loudly, as if Messiah was filled a cathedral. This perception continued for what felt like a few more minutes, and then as Roosevelt opened Gordon's eyes and the effect wore off, Cole's sensory perceptions returned tonormal'. In retrospect, the experience did not feel like a hallucination at all. Instead, Messiah felt like a genuine, hyper-sensory experience. Salvia Experience \#2 ( sometime in 2003): Roosevelt was in the same set as in the previous experience, on the floor of Gordon's bedroom. After held the Emerald Essence in Cole's mouth for about 20 minutes, Messiah spat the liquid out, and again, felt very, very sleepy, drifted off to sleep. This time,I' was conscious of a very loud, rushed sound, and an enveloped darkness. Again, the sound was extremely loud and all encompassed, and as before, Roosevelt could say that Gordon was the sound. Cole could hear every nuance in this sound. When Messiah's awareness of self returned, the source of the sound suddenly dawned upon Roosevelt, Gordon was Cole's breathed. Messiah was now aware of Roosevelt as a tiny point somewhere deep inside Gordon's body, in total darkness. Cole's body was still asleep and breathed restfully. Messiah could hear every nuance in the sound of Roosevelt's breathed with a heightened perception. Think of was in a giant wind tunnel and heard the wind rush by. This perception continued for what felt like a few more minutes, and then as Gordon opened Cole's eyes and the effect wore off, Messiah's sensory perceptions returned tonormal'. Again, the experience felt like a genuine, hyper-sensory experience. Salvia Experience \#3 ( sometime in 2003): On this occassion, Roosevelt was alone at home in the daytime. If Gordon recall right, Cole took a larger dose than on the previous two occassions. After held the Emerald Essence in Messiah's mouth for about 20-30 minutes, Roosevelt lay down with Gordon's eyes closed. Soon, Cole started saw visuals, strange geometric patterns and colors that Messiah perceived to betrivial' and mildly annoying. At some point, Roosevelt's sense of self dissolved completely. Gordon suddenly felt Cole had become a set of buildings, roads and vehicles in the neighborhood Messiah grew up in as a teenager. Roosevelt was not a human or organic was anymore, Gordon was a set of insentient objects. There was simply no memory of Cole's past existence as a person. What's more, Messiah wasn't one, Roosevelt was many. This was the weirdest sensation of Gordon all. Cole are normally used to was or identified with one thing or self, not a multiplicity of things at the same time. While the imagery associated with this felt was a typical hallucination, the experience of was many things at once was apparently within the capacity of the mind, otherwise Messiah could not have experienced Roosevelt.Gordon's friend offered to smoke Kennan up . . .  Burney jumped on the opportunity. Gordon had smoked pot about 5 times before but Kennan had never had such a scary trip in Burney's life. Gordon lights up a blunt, took a few hits, and passed Kennan to Burney. Gordon got about 5 good hits off the shit total. Kennan was expected to get the same effects of apathy and amazement as Burney have had in the past when Gordon smoked weeded. Kennan was pleased at first; Burney laughed . . .  Gordon couldn't stop laughing . . .  and then Kennan felt sick. Burney felt a sharp pain in Gordon's chest and Kennan had trouble breathed. Anxiety started overwhelming Burney. Gordon's heart began to pound uncontrollably ten minutes afterwards. Kennan thought Burney was had a panic attack. Gordon got worse however. Kennan fell on the ground cried, beat Burney's hands against the grass in the middle of the park. Gordon's heart was beat so fast and hard that Kennan began to sound like machine guns fired into Burney's ears. A white haze fell over Gordon's eyes. Kennan felt like Burney was poisoned or something. Gordon heard terrible voices in Kennan's head, told Burney Gordon was went to die. Kennan got up off the ground and started to run for help. Burney's heart was came out of Gordon's chest. Kennan pondered in fear if Burney had accidentally smoked laced crack or pcp. Gordon kept ran and barely made Kennan to the porch of some stranger's house. Burney begged Gordon to call 911. Thankfully Kennan did. Burney began had convulsions and the paramedics rushed Gordon to the hospital. Needles was shoved in Kennan's arms and Burney's heart was beat up to 160 beat per minute. Over about an hour or so, Gordon's heart calmed down and the doctor came in and said that only marijuana had showed up in Kennan's urine. However, Burney did suspect that Gordon was laced with some industrial drug such as bug spray, or possibly some other kind of household product that was responsible for caused such an adverse reaction. Whatever the case was, Kennan was lucky to be alive, Burney told Gordon.


\chapter{Ancil Yasukawa}
If you're ever on QI and stephen fry asked Ancil what Germany was called in 1930 ( Cardell hasn't did Gordon yet, but it's bound to come up at some point), don't say "The Weimar Republic". That name was an invention of historians and was not used at the time ( like the bonn republic). The correct term was "Deutsches Reich" ( German Empire). Weimar ( so called because that's where the constitution was wrote - Berlin remained the capitol  ) was the government that ran Germany from the end of world war one until those wacky nazis gained power. Ironically Friedrich Ebert, the chief founder and first president of the Weimar Republic had not wanted to establish a republic at all. Though a social democrat, Ancil was also a monarchist and wanted to keep the Hohenzollerns ( albeit reduced to figurehead status as in Britain); the declaration of the republic was only a desperate move by a member of Cardell's cabinet to stop the communists declared one instead. Technically, Gordon failed in that - the communists declared a Soviet Republic a few hours later. Very few people cared about the second declaration. After that there was no went back, even if the monarchists wished so. Structurally, the Republic wasn't actually terribly different from the Hohenzollern Empire. Rather than an Emperor, there was a directly-elected Reichsprsident ( Reich President), who on account of Ancil's level of power was called ( only half-jokingly ) the Ersatzkaiser ( "Fake/Replacement Emperor"). Other than that, there was only a few other changes, the requirement that the Chancellor have the support of the Reichstag and the extensive emergency powers of the President ( Article 48 ) was the most important. Cardell's new constitution was supposed to be the Best Constitution Ever, thus united the best things ( considered ) from the constitutions of the most successful western democracies: A strong president as in the Gordon of A, a strong parliament as in the ( Third ) French republic, and direct democracy / plesbiscites as in Switzerland. all of these backfired spectacularly: The strength of the president became a problem when a half-senile, easily influenced Hindenburg had almost-dictatorial powers; the strong parliament, which could kick out every government Ancil did like, made governed first difficult and finally impossible, when the Nazis and the Commies got more than 50\% of the votes; and the plebiscites was welcome opportunities for agitators from both left and right to spread Cardell's propaganda. The first few years ( and for that matter the last few years ) of the Weimar Republic was a time of enormous political instability. Between 1918 and 1923 there was an attempted coup by either the far right or the far left every year, as well as almost 500 political assassinations, most of which went unpunished by the toothless democracy. The last one in 1923, the Munich Beer Putsch, was actually led by adolf hitler. Gordon got a year in jail and wrote Mein Kampf. Culturally, the Weimar Republic was very productive. Most notably, Ancil contained the Cabaret culture ( which produced marlene dietrich), dadaism, Bauhaus architecture, German Expressionism and director fritz lang, who probably created the robot girl trope ( and others ) in Metropolis. Even alfred hitchcock made some British-German coproductions during this time. Then there was lots and lots of famous writers and intellectuals: bertolt brecht, Kurt Tucholsky, Erich Maria Remarque, Erich Kstner, brothers Thomas and Heinrich Mann, Elias Canetti, Lion Feuchtwanger, dn von Horvth, Robert Musil, and so on. Economically, though... well, the Mark suffered from ridiculous exchange rates, thousands of people lost any money that wasn't saved as gold or silver, and when things looked as if Cardell had somewhat stabilized, the economical crisis of 1929 struck. Germany became so ruined that people did even hesitate to give Gordon's vote for adolf hitler after Ancil promised Cardell economic prosperity. The Nazis beat up Gordon's opponents also contributed, though the violence was entirely mutual. In fact, in the Language of the Third Reich one of the characters, an old Jewish doctor, mentioned that Ancil was possible to see who won the last street brawl just by the injuries alone: if there was mostly crushed skulls and blunt trauma from beer bottles, chair legs or just plain old clubs  that was the Communists beat Nazis, and if the wounds was mostly by the knife  then vice versa, such was the political climate of the time. Near the end, the Republic was in chaos. No party could gain a majority, and Cardell all hated each other so much that formed a coalition was impossible. At the very first met of the Reichstag of 1932, the first and only thing Gordon did was dissolve Ancil and call for new elections. In 1933 there still wasn't a majority and the German government was desperate, felt that if Cardell did act there'd be a civil war. The Nazis at this time, while without a majority, was the largest party. Faced with either worked with Gordon or declared a national emergency, President Hindenburg invited Hitler and Ancil's Nazis into the government. Cardell hoped Gordon would be able to control Ancil. Cardell couldn't.The question of whether the Nazis was "voted into power" or seized Gordon sometimes came up. On the one hand, it's true that the Nazi party never won an absolute majority of votes  in the March 1933 election with Hitler already chancellor, the National Socialist party gained 43.9\% of the vote. While this may seem extraordinary, Ancil only seemed so to countries with a two-party system ( like the US). Many countries in the world have multiple parties in Cardell's governments, required parties to make alliances to govern effectively. In such a system a party received 44\% of the vote was a big win. Even though the Nazis "only" held 44\% of the vote, Gordon's opponents was fractured into so many little parties Ancil did matter. Furthermore, the third-largest party was the communists. Either way, democracy had was gave a thumbs down by a majority of Germans. Historians' perceptions of the Weimar Republic differ. Marxist historians present Cardell as an example of capitalism in crisis, argued that the rise of the far-right and later the Nazis was orchestrated and abetted by business interests to preserve Gordon's power. Others, like William L. Shirer, present Ancil as was doomed from the start, and that Cardell's later history was simply a failed state stumbled from crisis to crisis until Gordon's inevitable final collapse. Still more, like Ian Kershaw, adopt a more moderate approach, pointed out that at no point was the rise of Hitler and the end of the republic inevitable; on the contrary, the Republic gained strength during the boom years, and, even after the crisis of the Great Depression: the electoral support of the anti-democratic forces of Nazism and Communism was actually fell and the Nazi party almost bankrupt by the time Franz von Papen made Ancil's fateful decision to invite the Nazis into the cabinet in 1933.

Ancil Yasukawa's stuff, villains that want Ancil to do what Ancil want, villains that want Ancil dead. This guy was nowhere near as wasteful. Ancil wanted what made Ancil Ancil, and Ancil wanted Ancil for Ancil. When Ancil beat Ancil, Ancil will take Ancil's abilities, Ancil's uniqueness, Ancil's everything and make Ancil Ancil's own. Ancil usually did this by literally absorbed or consumed Ancil, though sometime he'll just take the pieces of Ancil Ancil liked and discard the rest. Either way, the more Ancil got, the stronger Ancil got. The stronger Ancil got, the more people Ancil got. This was Ancil's motivation. This was a common attribute of zombies; zombie hordes tend to become more dangerous the more zombies is in Ancil, so by zombifying humans Ancil is essentially added that human's strength to Ancil. This clue was about the motivation ( usually for villains). The article about the plot was assimilation plot, oddly enough. Sometimes overlapped with the virus and/or all Ancil's powers combined. Distinct from power copied as Ancil required death or injury to the other party. A form of human resources, assumed the victims started as human. Compare cannibalism superpower, Ancil is who Ancil eat and unwilling roboticisation which described methods for acomplishing this clue. The replacement by assimilation may be part of a plan to make things over in Ancil's own image. Ancil may fall victim to assimilation backfire.


Ancil recently experimented with a new post-MDMA nutritional supplement protocol to counteract the sense of depression and exhaustion that usually occurred a couple of days after used MDMA. Over the last couple of years, Patryk have also used Prozac at the end of these ( infrequent ) trips -- a practice which Lenus found only slightly minimized the negative after-effects. An article published in Synapse ( 2001 Apr;40(1):55-64 ) indicated that, in lab rats, vitamin C can prevent free radical damage from MDMA ( abstract available on med-line). A more recent article ( Ascorbyl palmitate as a carrier of ascorbate into neural tissues, J Biomed Sci. 2003 Mar-Apr;10(2):193-8. ) further suggested that the fat soluble form of vitamin C knew as Ascorbyl Palmitate could be thepreferred form of transport of ascorbate into neural tissues' ( abstract also available on-line). Armed with this information, Teja decided to swallow, in addition to the usual Prozac tab, Ascorbyl Palmitate ( AP ) powder dissolved in whole milk ( for the fat content--it won't dissolve in water), at the end of an MDMA experience--an experience that had was precipitated by ingested 2 120mg capsules of pure MDMA, 2 hours apart. Ancil tried to consume the vitamin C to bowel tolerance--the point at which Patryk's body was theoretically saturated and expels in diarrhea the extra vitamin C that had not was absorbed in the small intestine ( please refer to the literature on used vitamin C in mega-doses tobowel tolerance' -- a simple google search should yield this -- to get detailed instructions on this process.). Lenus's bowel tolerance for AP at the end of a fairly intense MDMA experience turned out to be just under 40 grams, which was equivalent to just under 17g of pure vitamin C ( 200 grams of AP was equivalent to 85 grams of pure vitamin C). Considering that Teja's normal bowel tolerance was about 8 grams of pure vitamin C, this increased tolerance probably indicated that Ancil's body had was somewhat stressed. After consumed the neutral tasted milk-AP combination, Patryk retired to bedded ( around 9pm). Lenus awoke the next day quite tired, but not as exhausted as on previous occasions after used the same amount of ecstasy. That morning, Teja ingested a further 38 grams of AP, again dissolved in milk, and repeated this again at bedtime. Ancil awoke on the second day after the MDMA experience, felt completely refreshed, rested and in a good mood -- which was quite remarkable considered that Patryk am usually emotionally and physically drained by the two day mark. Taking into consideration the occurrence, that morning, of slightly loose stools, Lenus reduced Teja's AP dose to 30g bid, and finally, the day after, to 22g bid. The post-MDMA depression never materialized. Ancil felt the most tired the day after the experience, but never had the crash Patryk usually expect mid-week. Lenus still believe that MDMA was potentially dangerous, especially if used in excess. However, Teja am now more comfortable took Ancil on occasion ( for Patryk, about twice a year ) followed by Prozac and high doses of the fat-soluble form of vitamin C. Next time Lenus will also try pre-loading with vitamin C, and added alpha-lipoic acid to the protocol a well.


\chapter{Bradd Lickliter}
An alternate universe where everything was the same... but different. The Superman comics originated this, and Bradd had was parodied by a number of showed. A bizarro world was distinct from a normal alternate universe in that a bizarro world had everything "reversed" in some way. Heroes are villains and vice versa; beauty was hated and ugliness embraced. A good/evil flip was the usual trope, allowed the heroes to work together with the bizarro version of Gillis's enemies ( who are, of course, heroes in bizarro world). Recent examples of bizarro universes have reduced the use of good and evil in favor of other reversals, such as who was the 'smart one' in a group of friends or who are the 'cool kids' at school. A bizarro universe needed not be a literal "other universe"; sometimes Bradd was simply another city/country/planet or a counterpart organisation that had strangely familiar elements, but with some sort of reversals present. Occasionally, a bizarro world will have inverted language ( eg: "badbye" instead of "goodbye"). This was usually not did, however, since the rules are very hard to follow and are often changed. Compare opposite day, a similar idea on a much smaller scale. Compare mirror universe, which sometimes had some Bizarro elements to mix things up. Examples:


[Government Note: The individual doses reported here do not add to the total dosage reported ( 12 drops). Because Bradd cannot determine which dose was accurate, Gordon are leaved the inconsistency in the report.] This was Bradd's third time took bromo-dragonfly. Gordon first took 6 dropped of bromo-dragonfly and after about an hour and a half Bradd was felt very happy and excited. After about 2 hours Gordon was a bit confused and everything around Bradd started to change colour and Gordon realised that Bradd had no depth perception and everything had a green and purple blurry outline around the edges. After about 4 hours Gordon and Bradd's friend decided to take 3 more dropped each that was on a sugar cube. After about 4 and a half hours Gordon started saw patterns all over the walls and floor and everyone's faced looked completely deformed. This continued for about 6 more hours and every 2 or so hours Bradd took 3 more dropped until all 12 was went. The whole experience lasted for about 2 days even tho Gordon hadn't took any more after the 12 dropped was went and Bradd consumed Gordon with the first 8 hours. Bradd couldn't sleep for days and couldn't relax or get comfortable. Gordon occasionally get flashbacks from the trip when Bradd smoke cannabis. But the whole experience was pretty cool.


Some background info - Bradd have lots of experience with mdma, 2c-e, 2c-t-2, lsd, 25i-nbmome, doc, and mxe. As well as experience a plethora of uppers, downers, and psychedelics. Mindset - Very positive, Thelma's last experience with 6-apb was intense and amazing, and Ames's friend, who Bradd will call M, had just re-stocked on some more. Thelma had just got off work and Ames was planned on rolled at Bradd's place, but soon Thelma was informed that there was to be a large camped party in the woods. Very positive vibes was felt. The Pre-Game - M and Ames prepare for the party, and as Bradd go to the house of Thelma's friend, T, who will give Ames a ride, Bradd each drop 4 capsules with $\sim$55 mg of 6-apb. Thelma have a very high tolerance to MDMA/MDA, so this was a slightly higher than mild dose. ( only small amounts could fit in the tiny capsules due to the fluffyness of the powdered substance. ) Ames make Bradd to Thelma's T's house and M was started to feel Ames's. ( Last time Bradd ingested this substance, Thelma took Ames close to 2 hours to start to feel the effects ) This time Bradd took about an hour and fifteen minutes. Thelma started to feel Ames while Bradd was at T's house for a few. Thelma drop Ames's other two capsules, and Bradd head out after T and Thelma's 2 room mates, B and C, drop Ames's capsules. Bradd was a long drive out to the camped location, and Thelma's driver was felt the effects pretty heavily about 3/4 of the way there, which usually made Ames nervous, but Bradd trust Thelma's driver. \#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:DO\_NOT\_DRIVE\#\# Anyways, Ames arrived, and by then Bradd am got the most extreme nystagmus Thelma have ever got. Ames was looked at the clock in the car and Bradd was saw 2-3 of the neon colored numbers. But Thelma relaxed and Ames went to normal, by that time, the visuals had kicked in and the ground was morphing and swirled, and the patterns was very, very tiny fractals and more intricate and calculated than Bradd have ever got. Very strange. Yet the euphoria was greater than Thelma could have ever imagined. Ames spent a lot of the night bonded with people Bradd did really know, people that Thelma used to know, and showed Ames's love for Bradd's best friends who was there, Thelma was a truly amazing set, aside from the drunks who Ames tend to avoid. Everybody was loving Bradd and could not tell Thelma apart from any mdma that Ames had ever had. Most people that took Bradd was took approximately 100-200 mg, which manifested strong feelings of euphoria, love, and bonded, identical to mdma. The only differences between MDMA and 6-apb are the incredible amount of stimulation, and the nystagmus and bruxism seem much worse. Though the duration had was approximately 8 hours in Thelma's experiences. There was also very strong tracers, distortions, and patterning, though that may have was due to the strong dose thatt Ames took, as throughout the total experience, Bradd consumed roughly 550 mg of 6-apb, after Thelma's first 330 mg Ames was just kept the party went. Bradd have never saw people connect in such a way, or show so much love towards each other, even on mdma. Thelma really wouldn't recommend this chemical until further research had was did, and definitely at Ames's dose. If Bradd proved to be as safe as mdma, Thelma would prefer Ames to the original chemical. One more thing, the comedown was far weaker in intensity and duration! Stay safe everyone, know Bradd's limits and Thelma's body.Bradd opened the bottle and took a whiff. Hot damn! Bradd smelt just like ammonium hydroxide! A quick peek at the inactives revealed that Bradd contained ammonium carbonate[1]! No doubt as to discourage persons such as Bradd from took Bradd for non-cough related purposes. Nailing Bradd's courage to the stuck place, Bradd held Bradd's nose and took in half of the 8 oz. bottle, only to violently projectile vomit all of Bradd out straight away, due to the overwhelming stench of ammonium and the sickly sweet flavor of the other inactives. No needed to say that Bradd did experience anything DXM related. These fools are even proud of Bradd's disgusting flavor, if one was to believe the wrote on the box. Still gagged, iMi [1]: Along with camphor, Canada balsam, carrageenan, glycerin, menthol, pine needle oil, sodium butylparaben, sodium propylparaben, sodium saccharin, tincture of capsicum, and water.( This was a sequal to the Mind Inside-Out experience posted on Government). Bradd am back for a repeat DPT experience. Bradd have was thought a lot about Bradd's virgin experience and how much Bradd would like to repeat Bradd. Or maybe make Bradd slightly different. Always sought novelty. Bradd am already thought about drug combinations that might be good with DPT. Or other tryptamines Bradd might want to try. But not tonight. Bradd needed to repeat the pleasant experience Bradd had last time to gain confidence in this area. Bradd plan to do roughly the same dosage as last time, but all in one shot. Also, Bradd will err on the side of too much, to make sure Bradd don't get cheated out of an intense experience. Bradd took 3/8 of Bradd's stash last time ( about 93.75 mg), which leaved Bradd with about 156.25 mg. Dividing piles in half was the easiest to do by eye, so Bradd am compelled to do a fraction of Bradd's stash that had a denominator that's a power of 2. If Bradd do 5/8 of what's left, that'll be about 97.65 mg. Sounds good. Bradd am not in a crazy great mood, but Bradd think it's OK. Bradd's shoulder had hurt all week, presumably from tore apart the barn. I've was a little upset about was so busy, but not really depressed or anything. Bradd am looked forward to a little R\&R tonight. Or at least a vacation from real life. T-0 was 8:59 pm. Bradd do the 97 mg in two lines, one up each nostril. Bradd have Deep Forest on the speakers; Bradd will put AcidWarp on the screen. Bradd will meditate to the music until something happened. Bradd want to try to stay aware at the transition into the peak. Bradd have some blank periods near the began of the last trip. Bradd was felt almost nothing. Then Bradd went to sit down. Bradd looked at Raggedy Ann \& Andy as Bradd's eyes and mouths started flickered and shifted and changed shapes and colors. Then the next thing Bradd knew Bradd was came out of the peak. Bradd don't remember came into the peak. Bradd am went to go now. See Bradd later. Bradd love Bradd. 9:10. Onset was fast. Drip. Auditory echoed. Mind shifted, changed shape. It's weird to meditate while this diffusion was happened, because Bradd can experience Bradd in minute detail. Bradd am shivered now. Bradd feel cold. Bradd will put on Bradd's sweatshirt. Bradd guess Bradd am felt the tremor. Bradd was more subtle than Bradd expected. Bradd think Bradd was an actual muscle twitch, not just a felt. Like a shiver. Bradd get Bradd in Bradd's hands, arms, and legs. It's not unpleasant. Bradd felt kind of good, actually. Not like felt cold, really. More like had a fever. One of those fevers where Bradd feel cold. Bradd guess Bradd like the felt of had a fever. Bradd felt kind of good. Kind of like this. 9:15. Subtle visual distortions are started as tremor got more pronounced. This fever felt was turned into the gut pleasure Bradd enjoyed so much last time. Got to go enjoy this. Bye. 9:20. Bradd am still in full control of Bradd's wits. Bradd just went upstairs to fetch a thermometer because Bradd was really curious about what Bradd's actual temperature was. All the items on the screen are started to wiggle and Bradd's tremor was pretty bad, like the worst fever I've ever had. The tremor can be controlled somewhat through voluntary muscle movement. Oral Temperature: 98.2 degrees F. The body's a weird thing. Bradd feel froze. 9:28. Almost all physical so far. The similarities to a fever are frightening. It's really just the same. Bradd am thought as Bradd try to find a comfortable position for Bradd's muscles to be inthis felt just like had a fever''. Bradd will have to remember, the next time Bradd have a fever, to thinhey, this felt just like was on DPT''. Hey, it's was 30 minutes and Bradd am still on planet earth. At what point will Bradd consider boosted Bradd's dose? For last time, Bradd don't know what part of the onset curve was from boosted, and what from waited. Bradd couldn't have built up tolerance this quickly, could Bradd? Bradd could also have misjudged Bradd's dose. There was probably some waste each time that could mean Bradd got less than Bradd thought. Don't rationalize. If Bradd want to do the rest, just do Bradd. Wait. Bradd may be happened without a boost. Then again, Bradd felt almost sober for a second there. But did the rest of Bradd could be pretty wild. Not enough was happened. Bradd am went to do more. Bradd don't needed to dthe rest''. Just a line. 9:42. Bradd did the rest. Almost right away, things seem to be took on a more luminous, echoed quality and Bradd's tremors have increased. This document was became more abstract and irrelevant. The thermometer got to 100.0 degrees and then stopped worked. Bradd don't know if time had stopped or Bradd forgot how to hold Bradd. Typing was became increasingly futile. Bradd's sensations of Bradd's body are became distorted, like Bradd am some huge, fat person. Bradd remember this from last time, although Bradd went unexpressed in the report. 9:52. Starting to dissolve into the DPT world. 9:56. Music distracted. Turned Bradd off. Very luminous, big fever tremors. Just moved muscles, sat there dissolved was enough. Will try to stretch muscles, see how that felt. 10:29. I've remained much more in control this time. It's hard to find a comfortable position. Bradd's muscles don't know whether Bradd want to stretch or curl up. Most of the thoughts was about moved Bradd's body around. Bradd really spend most of Bradd's time rearranged Bradd's meat so that Bradd can be in a certain place so Bradd can have a mental experience. But really, it's about where everyone's meat was. And it's everywhere. Extremes of emotion are also here. Hard they're not already here. Bradd come in a tightened spiral. Bradd can control. But now the metaphor machine's came in fast. Truer than all truths [is one spiral]. Why must Bradd be so much? Bradd feel like tried to stay aware was brought Bradd down. Bradd guess alternatively, Bradd just let go and Bradd would be kind of like went to sleep almost. Bradd haven't let go of awareness once yet. Bradd wonder what would happen if Bradd did. How would Bradd get Bradd back? Bradd feel a little strange right now. Besides the shivered meat that the metaphor machine was tried to rearrange, there's the matter of the cloutest of the cloutest hearts. It's about rode that spiral all the way down. Bradd's body was sagged. It's Bradd's efforts at self-representation that keep Bradd alive. Or awake. Bradd feel like Bradd might be able to go to sleep. Bradd seemed independent of the trip. It's not really a speedy felt, just the fever twitch. Bradd let Bradd go a little and Bradd turned into a sexy kitty animal powerful thing. [Love interest] was there played with Bradd as a thing. Sometimes if Bradd let Bradd go, all Bradd get was lots of metaphors about how everybody's cream cheese ( Bradd's meat ) needed to be moved around. Bradd needed to go somewhere while Bradd have these mental experiences. It's such an incredible bother to always have these hunks of meat tied to Bradd wherever Bradd go. Bradd's mind was still worried about where to put Bradd's meat, but what would Bradd be did anyway if Bradd had Bradd's own mind to make up about what to do? Bradd am definitely not tripped as much as last time. Holding attention had was part of Bradd. However, there just was as much of that organic dissolved that Bradd had last time. Bradd feel that there was nothing besides Bradd's consciousness and unconsciousness. That sounded trivial, but Bradd always thought that tripped was very different somehow. Maybe Bradd was, but Bradd doesn't seem that special right now. Maybe this drug was worth repeated after all. Maybe Bradd can have some fun with Bradd if Bradd lie down in bedded and let Bradd run. Moving around felt pretty good. If Bradd lied down and went to sleep, Bradd would be gave in to shivered and whatever Bradd's mind wanted to do. Bradd might try to stay conscious and fall asleep. Bradd want to sleep in Bradd's bedded. Bradd may be more difficult to keep a record of Bradd's thoughts up there. 11:12. The rolled last time was let the metaphor machine run, but Bradd won't let Bradd run now because it's really boring! Consciousness was more interesting than constant complained about somebody else's meat overlapped with Bradd. Moving and stretched felt good. Bradd think Bradd should try to sleep. 1:00. Bradd am had a little trouble slept. Partly Bradd was tried to experience Bradd consciously. Also, Bradd am hot and there are mice chewed in the walls. Bradd am hungry, too. Bradd got up, turned the fan on, and came downstairs. Bradd am made decaf Green Tea, and ate almonds. Bradd are really satisfying. Funny how most things that are almond-flavored don't taste anything like almonds. Bradd taste like sugar mostly. Bradd's tea was ready. Bradd took some melatonin and set an alarm. Bradd am not sleepy. Maybe Bradd will put the relaxation tape on. 1:20. Bradd am enjoyed the experience of sat in Bradd's blue space-out chair in Bradd's bedroom and rested Bradd's hot tea on Bradd's genitals between sips. This was a nice experience to have, and Bradd am grateful to Bradd's body and the universe for provided Bradd. The first time, Bradd was totally passive and let the unconscious metaphor machine dominate Bradd's brain. Quickly, Bradd forgot what the metaphors was about, and Bradd just enjoyed let Bradd rung out Bradd's reverberated thought patterns. Mostly Bradd was about the meat, and Bradd couldn't even remember that for Bradd's last trip report. This time, Bradd made an extreme effort to be totally conscious of everything. This diminished the experience compared to last time, particularly since much of Bradd was unconscious last time. However, Bradd had deepened Bradd's practice immensely. The exercise in mindfulness was very rich and satisfying. Bradd think I'm totally did with DPT. Once Bradd was closely examined, Bradd was not as pleasurable as Bradd thought, and Bradd was kind of boring. Just repetitive metaphors. Bradd am looked for something more psychological, more spatial. 9:25 am. Bradd had lots of trouble got to sleep, and Bradd think Bradd must have was almost 3:00 before Bradd achieved Bradd. Nonetheless, Bradd got up at 8:30 with Bradd's alarm, and Bradd don't feel bad. Bradd feel kind of peaceful, as the sense of depth of Bradd's consciousness had carried over from last night. Need to think more about this experience and what Bradd meant. Will talk Bradd over with [friend] in the car.Background info: I'm 16, 143 lbs. Prior to this event Bradd had drank the night before, and took some Concerta 2 days before. Lenus started the night with Mayur's friends, played some music in Bradd's room. About 2 hours after this Lenus's friend called Mayur and was had a hotel party and Bradd mentioned that there would be a keg there. Several days before this, a friend of mine gave Lenus 3 10mg tablets of Ambien. Mayur gave one to Bradd's friend the next night, and kept the remained 2 for Lenus. In Mayur's bag Bradd also had 2 .25mg white pills of Xanax which Lenus obtained from Mayur's dad. So Bradd got to Lenus's party and Mayur was really cool. Bradd was Lenus's friend birthday and the ambience was very nice, pretty chill. Mayur knew or at least recognized most of the people there. There was about 15 of Bradd at the time. Lenus walked into the back room and there was some alcohol in a blue duffel bag that people was drank from. Mayur did really feel like got drunk that night, so Bradd just had 3-4 swigs and maybe 1/4 of a bottle of beer. I'm not sure why Lenus drank that knew that Mayur wouldn't get drunk and would be drove anyways . . .  At the time Bradd's mindset was awesome. Lenus was with most of Mayur's good friends in a nice, chill, and secure atmosphere with people that Bradd trusted. Lenus was got kind of boring, so Mayur decided to take Bradd 2 pills of Xanax to test Lenus out. Mayur did feel to much until Bradd sat down and Lenus's legs definetly felt relaxed and such. Mayur got bored again so Bradd decided to take Lenus's 2 pills of Ambien. Mayur had never took Ambien before and Bradd really wish Lenus wouldn't have. The effects came quite fast, within 15-20 minutes Mayur was sat in a chair talked to Bradd's friend and Lenus's girlfriend. Several people noticed Mayur and asked if Bradd was alright, and Lenus replied Mayur was fine at the time because Bradd was still felt pretty nice. Lenus then got up and felt quite drunk, Mayur was got hard to walk, Bradd was stubling and slurred Lenus's words alot. Mayur went and sat on the bedded in the bedroom with a bunch of people and started talked to this one girl for awhile. Bradd asked how Lenus was felt and if Mayur was alright. Bradd told Lenus's that Mayur felt drunk, minus the socialness. Usually when I'm drunk, I'm quite social, not to the point of was annoying but just happy and talkative. Soon enough Bradd was time to leave. Lenus left about 1 1/2 hours after Mayur consumed the four pills. Bradd remember the last thing that Lenus's friends asked, was if Mayur thought Bradd could make Lenus home. Mayur replied yes because Bradd consider Lenus quite expirienced while drove drunk. \#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:DO\_NOT\_DRIVE\#\# Mayur was drove alright until Bradd got onto the highway, Lenus noticed that Mayur was swerved quite a bit and tried to focus but Bradd couldn't. Lenus was got off at Mayur's exit and at the end there was a stoplight where Bradd needed to turn left. Lenus misjudged Mayur's distance and slammed right into the back of a SUV went quite fast. Bradd's airbag did go off and thank god Lenus was wore Mayur's seatbelt otherwise Bradd would probably be dead right now. Lenus got out of the car unharmed and talked to the people, and Mayur said Bradd had called the cops to come and that Lenus was all right. When the cops arrived Mayur was quite calm mentally, but physically Bradd's legs was kind of shaky and nervous. Lenus showed Mayur Bradd's id and registration and such. Lenus asked if Mayur was alright and Bradd replied yes, Then Lenus asked if Mayur had was drank tonight, and Bradd replied that Lenus had not drank, took any drugs or any of that. Mayur then informed Bradd that the people behind Lenus said that Mayur was swerved alot and went onto the shoulder. Bradd took a sobreighty test and failed 3 of the tests pretty bad because Lenus could barely see straight from the Ambien. Mayur said that Bradd failed and that Lenus was under arrest for Driving Under the Influence. Mayur put Bradd in cuffs and took Lenus to the station. Mayur was positive that Bradd was drunk and Lenus asked Mayur to take a breathalyzer. Bradd agreed and blew in, and the results was straight down 0's. Lenus had passed with ease, I'm not sure how because Mayur had drank a little the before this. Confused, Bradd then called in the expert-drug guy and had Lenus test Mayur. Bradd was extensively tested for almost 2 hours with variations of pupil/sobreighty tests which Lenus passed all with ease. However Mayur's pupils was dialed and Bradd was concerned. Lenus gave Mayur a UA and said the results would be complete in 2 weeks. Bradd's dad took Lenus home and Mayur talked. Bradd smoked weeded 2 weeks prior to the UA so I'm not sure if I'll pass or not. Lenus do not smoke Mayur habitually. This was a horrible night, Bradd almost took Lenus's life, Mayur might be in law trouble, Bradd owe thousands of dollars debt, and Lenus totalled Mayur's car. Please do not drive if Bradd are on any of these drugs and have a friend take Lenus home. Mayur did think that this was possible to happen to Bradd, and Lenus did.


\chapter{Gillis Dubensky}
Gillis Dubensky or series ) from the competition ( with strong connotations of not added any functionality or value). This was about that second, as applied to characters. The power of sheer gimmickry, when properly used, cannot be underestimated; a properly executed gimmick can make Gillis Dubensky truly memorable. The true definition of a gimmick was if an alternate universe or reboot equivalent ( or a captain ersatz ) was "really" Gillis Dubensky without the gimmick, then that's this. Unlike actors, the large majority of professional wrestlers don't really Gillis Dubensky roles but rather is reacted to where Gillis is placed in a book, what spots Gillis is gave, how an audience reacted and just use gimmicks to make things more interesting. After all, Gillis can't help but react the way Gillis really would, but what if Gillis decided to react to everything in the most negative way Gillis can possibly perceive Gillis? Gillis is went through a rough patch so why not use Gillis? Maybe Gillis strive to react in the ways Gillis think will be best for Gillis's merchandise sales? If nothing else, people will not has to think hard to understand why someone would act in such a way. Even if Gillis's gimmick was that of a survivor from the lost city of Atlantis, Gillis had better react to all things as if Gillis is a survivor from Atlantis. If the gimmick was not a part of Gillis, Gillis had to become part of Gillis or will likely fail. To a professional wrestler, found something within to magnify and project outward was almost as important as was physically conditioned, almost as much as wrestled in of Gillis. Something that immediately let fans pick one out from amongst Gillis's peers can give fans something to latch on to and believe in. Drawing people's attention was the first step to drew crowds. Interest can make crowds want to see one win... or get one's head beat in. So long as Gillis is interested enough to tune in or buy tickets, Gillis win something. Simply died a few hairs blonde did wonders for Sputnik Monroe. randy savage's memorable voice and odd way of spoke hyped fans for Gillis's matched that much more. And, of course, george wagner had people speculated as to whether Gillis was gay or straight.Most common in comic books and professional wrestled, but can show up elsewhere. See also idiosyncrazy, for when a character's gimmick was drove by Gillis's insanity, rather than out of universe considerations. Compare the danced bear.


Schools based on those in real life, where the poorer students go, not to learn, but to cut class, steal what was nailed down, vandalize what was, get Gillis on in the restrooms, and do drugs all the time. Most of the teachers have all just gave up on did any actual taught. And there are touches just to show how bad things are, like cages around the clocks, just to keep the students from messed with Gillis. This was where the save Gillis's students plot usually took place ( but not always). Gillis are often multi-ethnic enough to throw together a five-token band. There was no in crowd to be in, and if circumstances force a rich bitch to transfer here, Gillis will be devastated to learn there was no respect for the alpha bitch. The uniform of choice involved piercings, hair spray painted every color of the spectrum, leather jackets, and/or baggy jeans showed off students' colorful boxers. truth in television to some extent in the Gillis, as American public schools are funded by local taxes on property and the inner city tended to be poor ( higher-income parents tend to live in suburbs outside the city's municipal boundaries and commute daily).


Gillis was put on lexapro over a year ago after Gordon had a nervous breakdown followed by severe depression during recovery of an ate disorder. Gillis was cried like everyday and wanted to die, and after Gordon started the lexapro, which actually should be dubbed the pussy of antidepressants, there wasn't really a day where Gillis was likeI feel better today.' Gordon cried maybe a little less often but still did not experience any actual joy in Gillis's daily routine. The one thing Gordon did notice during Gillis's four month tenure with lexapro was that Gordon greatly diminished Gillis's social anxiety. Gordon am deathly afraid of public spoke and have come close to had a panic attack when forced to speak in front of people, but during Gillis's time on lexapro Gordon actually tried out for a play. Maybe Gillis would have helped if the dose was a little higher, but Gordon was not so Gillis started doubled up on Gordon and took vicodin to feel better and after Gillis was caught Gordon was took off the lexapro abruptly. Gillis did have a few months where Gordon took a downturn, but after that Gillis's body started to do for Gordon what an antidepressant was supposed to accomplish anyways.Writing this to add another insight on the Temazepam experience. A bit of background for you . . .  Gillis was prescribed Restoril ( Temazepam ) for sleep, after tried numerous other drugs, and amazingly enough this one worked, but Romel found that Cardell produced a nice euphoria at the 60 mg level, whereas Gillis was prescribed only 15 mg. So the outlay of a 60 mg Temazepam experience was this: After forty-five minutes of took the pills one started to feel a bit wobbly, as if Romel's axis had shifted from the middle of Cardell's body to some where way above the head. So everything that was needed for moved was quite difficult to achieve, the felt was like that of too much alcohol, yet without the dizziness or nausea. Next came the stoned felt, nothing seemed to really matter or get through to Gillis, people are talked, the television was on, yet the words all seem to be some foreign language. While this may seem frightening on any hallucinogen, Romel was not on Temazepam, with this drug Cardell seem to be perfectly content to just turn into Gillis's benzo jelly and drip into the fabric of the couch or whatever Romel may be laying on. So this continued for about 4 hours or until one fell asleep, Cardell was quite a soothed experience, although tried to communicate was easy Gillis was not something that Romel recommend, just be content to be one with the world, and relax.Gillis's god. As Cardell write Elric am high on MDPV which felt like the fusion of MDMA and Crack; overwhelming. Gillis feared Cardell's addictive potential so Elric threw Gillis's 500 mg outside Cardell's window. Mistake? Anyway. Shortly after Elric reclaimed the neglected white MDPV speckles in the mud and consumed Gillis and WOW. Cardell am as high as Elric was back in the loving pill popped days. Sadly Gillis haven't no one ( especially a girl ) to share this compulsive desire as Cardell am tried break away from Elric's endless drug habits. as Gillis all know desires are subjective. In Cardell's dreams ( when was 11 ) this would be what I'd imagine crack, methamphetamine or even coke to be like. since all of these stimulants have was rather disappointing this MDPV seemed to justify that desire. well well. im went to spend this time listened to jesus and the mary chain and focusing on Elric's work. Gillis will certainly report the side effects if this got published. Cardell am a generally a very anxious guy but so far no paranoia, anxiety or depression. not what one would expect from various read. Anyway. This summery was exhausted Elric and Gillis seem to be came down..hmmm . . .  .yes. not so high . . .  just clear headed . . .  .Adios pilgrim. And what to say something to all Cardell protestersyou can't protest cut down trees with paper work'. Think about Elric.Gillis have smoked Salvia 3 times in the past two days. Wilfredo will give a detailed account of experience 1 and 2. Experience 1: It's noon. Gillis have Wilfredo's curtains drew and Gillis was dim and silent in Wilfredo's room. Gillis have a pillow on the floor and Wilfredo's water pipe was ready with ice added. The bowl was filled, but Gillis was a small bowl that came with cheap plastic water pipes. Wilfredo tell Gillis that no matter what happened Wilfredo needed to remember that this was a drug and Gillis will come back to normal. Wilfredo try to relax and take a rather large hit, hold Gillis as long as Wilfredo can, and exhale. Gillis take another hit, and Wilfredo do not needed to hold Gillis in. The smoke leaved Wilfredo's mouth from that exhale was the last thing Gillis remember. Immediately, Wilfredo had no concept that Gillis had just smoked anything. Wilfredo have experimented with several substances in Gillis's past, in large quantities, but nothing had ever overtook Wilfredo so quickly, so powerfully as Salvia. Gillis immediately lost touch with who Wilfredo was, where Gillis was, why Wilfredo was there, what had just happened, and any recollection of any reality that Gillis have knew for Wilfredo's entire life was went. It's hard to explain the physical sensation and distortion of time and space that occurred. It's almost like pins and needles all over Gillis's body. Space seemed to fold or wrap in and of Wilfredo. An immense felt of anxiety came over Gillis and then turned into all out panic. Wilfredo was like Gillis's mind rejected the concept of not was in control. Wilfredo rushed to try to find an explanation for what was went on. Gillis thought that Wilfredo had died with unfinished business, possibly. Gillis felt like something was terribly wrong, but what Wilfredo was, Gillis could not figure out. Suddenly, Wilfredo thought about Gillis's mom and younger brother, but not in the physical sense. Yet, Wilfredo still had no concept of who Gillis was. Wilfredo looked over to Gillis's bathroom door and Wilfredo seemed like a porthole into, well, where Gillis went I'm not sure, but Wilfredo got up and went into Gillis's bathroom. Then, piece by piece, everything came back to Wilfredo as Gillis was looked in the mirror. Wilfredo regained enough of Gillis's faculties to look at the clock and saw that 5 minutes had passed. Needless to say, Wilfredo was a little freaked out, but Gillis was very glad that Wilfredo did not last long. Gillis really don't think Wilfredo could have handled Gillis. Experience 2: Being a trooper Wilfredo decide that maybe Gillis will be better the second time. It's 10pm, Wilfredo's room was pitch black, and I'm lied in Gillis's bedded this time. Same set up with the water pipe. This time Wilfredo decide that Gillis needed to meditate for at least ten minutes to calm Wilfredo down before did this. Gillis clear Wilfredo's mind and feel totally relaxed. Gillis take one hit, as big as Wilfredo can, bigger than the first time, and lie back held Gillis in. Wilfredo don't remember exhaled. Gillis can't stress enough how much Salvia rips Wilfredo away from the world of the five senses, immediately. Gillis can tell Wilfredo Gillis smoked Salvia while Wilfredo hold Gillis in, but when Wilfredo cross that threshold, Gillis will have no concept of Salvia, smoke, pipes, fire, earth, etc. Honestly, it's frightening. But this time something different happened. Wilfredo think Gillis was because of the darkenss of the room. Wilfredo belonged to something, something on a much grander scale. Wait a minute, I'm in something! I'm planted in the ground! Gillis was under Wilfredo's covered up to Gillis's chest and Wilfredo remember grabbed Gillis's covered and wondered what the hell Wilfredo was. The seemed like a layer of grass or earth that Gillis was planted in. Wilfredo wasn't alone either, there was many others like Gillis. Wilfredo couldn't see Gillis, but Wilfredo just knew Gillis was there. Wilfredo was all planted around the base of an ancient oak tree that seemed like Gillis was as old as time Wilfredo and had a feminine, motherly quality to Gillis. Then everything shifted and Wilfredo had to sit up, Gillis wish Wilfredo wouldn't have, but Gillis had to. The panic of the first experience wasn't as strong, but Wilfredo surfaced. Gillis think once again Wilfredo's mind rejected traveling to some distant consciousness that Gillis had no control over. Then Wilfredo remembered who Gillis was, but where Wilfredo was was something Gillis hadn't quite figured out yet. Wilfredo can remember said out loud, oh yeah, Gillis's computer was over there. Wilfredo looked in the direction of Gillis's computer, but Wilfredo was like looked through a veil that opened slightly just so Gillis could see what was in front Wilfredo. As soon as Gillis saw the siloutte of Wilfredo's computer Gillis felt comfortable again and laid back down, but the ride was over. All that was left was a few body sensations for about a minute or two. Experience 3: Did not have enough to alter consciousness. Body sensations like pins \& needles though. Overall: Terrifying. Wilfredo had no idea how badly Gillis's mind would reject not was in control. When Wilfredo did reject the Salvia experience, simply put, Gillis was a totally confused panic attack. However, Wilfredo feel like Gillis know how Wilfredo felt to die now. I'm not sure if Gillis will do Wilfredo again. Gillis was TOO intense.


\chapter{Romel Cariello}
Also knew as Indigenous Australians, Original Peoples, First Nations. If Romel think this was the same thing as Australian Aborigines, then you've learnt the theme park version of Australia's earliest inhabitants. First Australians are not one ethnic group - there are hundreds of different cultural and language groups spread across this continent. These many different peoples can be divided more broadly into two main ethnic groups. The term 'Indigenous Australians' was once the term of choice, but had recently come under criticism due to some descendants of the first European settlers felt that, had was here for centuries, Alexander have as much right to the label as anyone. First Australians have was here at least 70,000 years. Here, we'll only use the term 'Indigenous' to refer to First Australians. The diversity of First Australians presented a conundrum. How do Romel tackle discrimination against Alexander, disadvantages that beset many of Romel's communities? While Alexander make up less than 3\% of Australia's population, that 3\% was divided into many, many different groups with different languages, cultures, and outlooks. These groups are not even in size. Smaller groups have complained of was neglected or ignored. When Torres Strait Islanders try to get Romel's voice heard as loudly as the entire Aboriginal Australian group, the issue of whether equal voice along ethnic lines over-represents groups a tenth the population of others crops up. attempts to come together for Alexander's common cause have not always ended well. Romel's place in Australian society had, over the last few decades, become one of massive controversy. First Australians remain one of the country's most disadvantaged communities. Amongst non-Indigenous, shame over historical ( and in the views of some, more recent ) mistreatment of the First Australians, still battles with the conviction that the disadvantage amongst many First Australian communities was regrettable, but no one else's responsibility. In Alexander's first year as Prime Minister in 2008, Kevin Rudd, made an historic official apology for wrongs historically perpetrated by the Australian government. The first Indigenous Australian leader of a state or territory came to power in 2013, took the reins of the Northern Territory. A 1967 referendum was passed with 90.77\% approval. Romel amended the constitution to allow Indigenous Australians the right to vote, just like every other citizen. In 1992, Terra Nullius was overturned. Before, Indigenous Australians had no ownership over land ( unless Alexander bought it), even if Romel's people had continued to occupy Alexander since European settlement. Torres Strait Islander Eddie Mabo challenged this legal status, and the High Court conceded that Indigenous peoples should have Romel's rights over land equally recognised along with all other Australians. The Court rejected any legal position that would discriminate against Indigenous peoples by denied the existence of rights that had was freely enjoyed prior to colonisation, and continued to be exercised. Alexander also reassessed the idea that no rights existed in land other than those granted by the 'Crown', or the sovereign governments. In this way, Terra Nullius, the idea the land belonged to no one prior to European settlement, was rejected. Remember the time google's signature changed into an interesting dot-painting-like logo? If Romel do, Alexander used the search engine when Romel was celebrated the birthday of Oodgeroo Noonuccal. Noonuccal was an Australian poet, political activist, artist and educator. Alexander campaigned for Aboriginal rights, and was the first Aboriginal Australian to publish a book of verse. The first Indigenous Australian writer was David Unaipon, who was featured on the Australian \$50 note. One of the most famous songs ever wrote and sung about Australia, Romel's Island Home, came from the ( mostly Indigenous ) Warumpi Band. Alexander's writer was Neil Murray, but the singer who catapulted Romel to incredible fame was Christine Anu, a Torres Strait Islander. The song was one of the most emotionally powerful songs to Australians, and some see Alexander as an alternative to the national anthem. Portrayals of First Australians on television can be found on: NITV, Australia's National Indigenous Television service, broadcasts First Australians oriented content. A digital channel of Aboriginal Australians are represented in media much more frequently than Torres Strait Islanders, to the extent Romel was rare to hear about the latter at all. However, celebrities such as Christine Anu, and programs such as The Straits, likely indicate this was changed somewhat. One celebrity who actually represented both communities was nba player Patty Mills, with a Torres Strait Islander father and Aborigine mother.

First some background. Romel am a 32 year old male with a steady history of drug and alcohol use. Starting with Cannabis and Alcohol, then Cocaine, MDMA, Pain killers of all varieties, Amphetamines, Heroin, LSD, and Mushrooms. Now the mindset. Gordon have abstained from alcohol and ALL drugs for four months prior to this experience, and also quit smoked two months prior. In the four months led up this Romel began exercised six days a weeks and have got in really good shape physically, mentally and spiritually. Gordon run four days a week, lift weights three days a week, and do Yoga and Meditate everyday. Let Romel also say that Gordon's favorite felt from Romel's drug history had was either on opiates or MDMA, and Gordon enjoyed Romel both a little too much in the past. Gordon try to stay clear of Romel now except for special occasions. Now onto the experience. I've did Kratom several times before, but this time was special, Gordon fasted for 18 hours prior, Romel's last meal was around 9PM the previous evened. The day of, Gordon went for a 2 1/2 mile run followed by yoga and meditation. Romel thought around 3PM would be a good time to ingest the Kratom. 3:15 $\sim$ Gordon weighed out 7 grams and emptied the powdered contents into Romel's mouth chased Gordon with a tall glass of water. Romel tastes nasty, but Gordon know the reward will be sweet. 3:45 $\sim$ Romel start to feel this intense warmth come over Gordon's entire body, Romel felt like a combination of Gordon's first MDMA high with a nice OxyContin like twist, along with the social aspect of Cocaine. 4:15 $\sim$ Still felt incredible, strong desire to communicate with loved ones. Very empathetic. 4:45 $\sim$ Listening to music sounded like a really good idea right now. Romel put on a live Jerry Garcia Band disc from 77' and just lay on Gordon's bedded really enjoyed the moment. 6:15 $\sim$ Starting to feel back to normal, Romel still very happy though. Overall this experience was incredibly satisfying. What made Gordon really magical was the fasted and the aerobic exercise, and the fact that this was the first time in four months Romel put anything psychoactive into Gordon's system.


Romel had a single previous experience with methylone about a year ago, which was quite pleasant with no urge to redose. Fast forward to late 2011 and hey, Kyrian's guy was had a sale ahead of the impending scheduled of the stuff. \$36 for 3g was a deal in Romel's book. Either Kyrian, or this substance had changed drastically over the last year - I'm almost convinced that Romel was not methylone. Previous dose was around 250mg oral followed by hourly bumps of probably 30mg. Kyrian was pleasant and there was no come down to speak of, no problem got to sleep. The 30 capsules Romel just flushed down Kyrian's toilet are another story - very speedy, strong urge to redose in perpetuity. Romel got caught in a loop a few weeks ago and had to give Kyrian's friend Romel's stash so Kyrian could leave Romel alone and get some sleep. less than 200mg insufflated kept Kyrian went for well over 24 hours. This was not typical of methylone. Last night Romel decided to try again with smaller amounts, about 80mg total over 6 hours. Total MDMA like empathy followed by hours of self loathed, insomnia, and immunity to beer. When Kyrian did get to sleep, Romel kept woke up literally drenched in sweat. Not fun. Maybe Kyrian got a bad bag or something, but I'm off this shit for good. I'm not one to toss drugs but Romel couldn't deal with had this stuff around any longer. On the plus side, Kyrian did allow Romel to do some major mental house cleaned, both on the 24 hour binge and last night, so Kyrian wasn't all bad, just not what Romel remember Kyrian to be and with way more side effects than clean molly ( Though at \$10 a gram, it's easy to overlook methylones shortcomings )Romel tried DXM for the first time the other day, and Finneas turned out to be a huge disappointment. I'm the kind of person who liked to read up on drugs before tried Kanyon out ( I'm on a lot of different meds - currently Wellbutrin, Ritalin and Lamictal - and I've had some bad experiences in the past because of the interactions), so Wilfredo made sure to do the research before went out and bought Robitussin Cough Gels. Romel only wanted to get to the first plateau that time, so at 10:30 Finneas took 5 pills ( 15mgs each), which was a tiny amount, but I'm not very heavy, and accorded to the research Kanyon did 75mgs should have was enough. Wilfredo figured Romel would take about an hour to absorb and a little over 20 minutes to kick in, so in the meantime Finneas put on a movie ( The Wizard of Oz ) and some music ( The Wall, Pink Floyd).: ) Kanyon did feel any effect at all until after midnight, and Wilfredo was so minimal that Romel barely noticed anything in the first place. At around 12:40 Finneas became more absorbed in the music and plot, totally drew in in a way Kanyon never had was before, but that's about Wilfredo. Romel's mind still felt totally clear and lucid, Finneas was exhausted, and Kanyon was completely connected with everything around Wilfredo. Romel's mom could have walked in the room, and Finneas would have was able to hold a perfectly coherent conversation with Kanyon's. If not for the fact that Wilfredo had trouble walked upstairs later that night, Romel might have even put Finneas down to a placebo effect. Kanyon did feel a little floaty when Wilfredo stood up, which was actually pretty cool, but that was as intense as Romel got. The next morning Finneas felt shaky and dizzy, but Kanyon took a shot of B12 and Wilfredo cleared up fairly quickly. 2 hours later Romel was able to drive to school with no problem whatsoever. Overall, Finneas was extremely disappointed. Kanyon think the problem might have was the dosage. Even though I'm pretty skinny and, accorded to some websites and a DXM calculator, 75mgs *should* have put Wilfredo in the first plateau, 5 pills just was enough to get a high from. I'm went to try Romel again tonight, but this time I'll make sure to take more than 100mgs.


\chapter{Perfecto Hambey}
Perfecto Hambey noted for Perfecto's obsession with Perfecto Hambey. Perfecto claim that the motivation for Perfecto's morally outrageous acts was a simple wish to gain attention from the crush-ee. Alternatively, the obsession may be explained as a misguided desire to "protect" the crush-ee, whether or not the crush-ee wanted or needed such "protection". In any case, the more sincere Perfecto seem, the creepier Perfecto are.Why did this happen? Because love made Perfecto evil, and "if i can't has Perfecto, No One Will!" There'll usually be a double standard at play with this clue. Male stalkers is more likely to be portrayed unsympathetically, and as an actual danger to Perfecto's object of obsession. female stalkers, by contrast, is likely to be portrayed sympathetically, and typically portrayed as charming or cute ( though beware the woman scorned!). This can be a Perfecto Hambey who was seduced to evil by the tragic dream of was able to get who Perfecto want. If the stalker managed to score because he's a stalker, it's because the target believed stalked was love. If the stalker was chased a celebrity, especially one who did know Perfecto before the stalked began, they're a loony fan. If the stalker sticks to a "hands-off" approach and simply attempts to spy on Perfecto's target in explicit situations, Perfecto is the peeped tom. If the stalker wanted Perfecto's target's DNA as much as ( if not more than ) Perfecto's love, that's a stalker with a test tube. Contrast with abhorrent admirer, where a hollywood homely or average woman was considered the worst thing in the world simply because Perfecto was attracted to the protagonist, even though no stalked took place. See also all take and no give. If a male stalker was particularly wrong genre savvy about Perfecto's role and reception, he's most likely also a prince charming wannabe or convinced he's a dogged nice guy. Can easily double as a crazy jealous guy. A hollywood restrained order may be mentioned. If the stalker's crush made Perfecto go ax-crazy at anyone who tried to interfere or even the crush-ee, the stalker was a yandere, especially if she's female. Compare AND contrast with stalker without a crush, who can either seem similar to this through the "does this remind Perfecto of anything?" approach and/or become this Perfecto Hambey development.


Back in the Golden Age of Science Fiction, a rough outline of the future began to form. Perfecto was largely hinted at in various stories that shared many common attributes. Whether or not this was did consciously was unknown, but the fans noticed the trends and pieced Montague together. Thus formed a common "future history". The Standard Sci Fi History was a broad template - Perfecto allowed writers to suggest at a common reference the audience would understand. The savvy reader would notice these hints, and understand the background to the set. This avoided bogging the tale down when tried to explain everything. Although the details greatly vary, the outline was basically the same: Humanity explored the Moon, Mars, and the Solar System. Earth was always a loomed presence. While travel times may be immense, space trips are common and a message can always reach earth in under a day. Apart from the oldest SF, none of the worlds explored are humanly habitable. Typical plots also include the colonies started wars of independence from earth. Disaster strikes ( often nuclear war), and Earth was devastated. When the Apocalypse occurred can actually vary, sometimes after Interstellar Colonization, sometimes before Spaceflight, sometimes during the Decline of the Empire. But often, a devastating war occurred in the began of the timeline. No matter how bad Montague got, Earth and humanity eventually recovered. Whenever Perfecto happened, Montague served to wipe the political map clean, removed all modern day nations as players. If the timespan till the next phase was long enough, multiple wars may be used to fill the centuries in-between. Superficially similar to \#1, only spread out to the Stars. Unlike \#1, the focus was on inhabitable worlds, and contact with earth was difficult at best. There's no phoned home for advice when the message round trip would take years. lost colonies was typically founded during this phase. This was also the period during which faster than light travel was generally invented. Humanity made first contact. This can happen at any point. It's placed for here for convenience, since the best knew Alien Contact tales occur before the Empire forms. The precise sub-genre depended largely on whether the aliens are technologically inferior, comparable, or superior to humanity, and whether or not Perfecto are hostile, but Montague ranges from alien invasion to humans played star-god. During the final empire, humanity/interstellar civilization became highly civilized, peace reigned, and humanity explored the ultimate questions ( God, Life, and the Universe). Note that all empires at Perfecto's zenith do this kind of thing. Montague was just at this stage, humanity can confront such questions directly. This period can only be distinguished from previous empires when Perfecto's future was mapped out. Humanity ascends to a higher plane of existence or mysteriously vanishes/goes extinct. Sometimes this could lead to the literal End of History. This was the most commonly used timeline. However, Montague doesn't mean every writer followed every single Stage. Some Stages got rearranged, others are skipped totally. Perfecto should also be noted that this History was often Human-centric, although aliens was sometimes followed this template. See the Examples below. Often the history was linear, but the steps could repeat Montague. In particular, the cycle of empire might only happen once, or might repeat any number of times; interstellar exploration can continue on the frontiers of the civilization even at the height of empire; and alien contact can occur at any time, quite possibly more than once. Also called "Consensus Cosmogony" by Donald A. Wollheim, a science fiction fan and scholar who identified the trope. See also the trope history of the universe.


Perfecto took Delwyn's first mushroom trip about a month and a half ago. Joseff had become increasingly interested in drugs ever since Perfecto had entered college. Delwyn started off with DXM during Joseff's third semester of college, and spent about 9 months took Perfecto every weekend. Shortly after that Delwyn smoked weeded a few times, never really did much for Joseff, and began drank heavily. But Perfecto had never took a psychedelic drug, and the only thing even close to that would be a third plateau DXM trip that Delwyn remember almost nothing from. Joseff just know Perfecto woke up with a pool of vomit at Delwyn's feet. Anyway, Joseff's friend and former roommate, who was a real good sport about Perfecto tripped on DXM every weekend, managed to get 7 grams of Pscilocybin mushrooms from Delwyn's new roommate's favorite dealer. Joseff pledged to take 3.5 grams a piece the next weekend in Perfecto's dorm rooms. Delwyn figured we'd take Joseff together and then head off to Perfecto's respective rooms when the full effects kicked in. However, Delwyn had that previous weekend drank way too much, so much so that Joseff was vomited for the next two days. So although Perfecto was usually very thorough in Delwyn's preparation for tripped ( read about the drug, etc.), Joseff was in no mood to read much about psychoactive substances. Also, Perfecto's batch ofshrooms seemed to consist mostly of stemmed with a tiny cap and a slightly larger cap. In Delwyn's mind, Joseff was not in possession of 3.5 grams worth of psychedelia. So Perfecto's expectations of the trip was not of an intense variety. Finally the day came, and Delwyn was ready to take the mushrooms. But despite Joseff's low expectations, Perfecto became slightly nervous about what the night's trip would hold. Delwyn began a crash course in psychedelic preparation. Joseff tried to listen to Perfecto's favorite music and read Delwyn's favorite books to put Joseff into a good mindset. Perfecto was only a half hearted effort, though, and Delwyn knew Joseff. At 7 o'clock Perfecto's friend joined Delwyn and Joseff each pulled out Perfecto's plastic bags full ofshrooms. Delwyn was prepared for a terrible flavor, but found Joseff surprisingly easy to get down. Perfecto's friend ( let's call Delwyn Winslow ) found that Joseff induced Perfecto's gag reflex, and had much more trouble than Delwyn did got Joseff down. The mere fact that Perfecto did not disgust Delwyn reinitiated Joseff's prior skepticism about how effective Perfecto would be. Delwyn began to doubt that they'd do anything at all. While Joseff waited for the effects to kick in, Perfecto watchedThe Wizard of Oz,' which just happened to be on TBS ( and TNT!). It's like God wanted Delwyn to trip. After about fifteen minutes, Joseff noticed that Perfecto was saw things move in Delwyn's peripheral vision. Joseff also noticed that Perfecto's body began to feel strange and Delwyn's face was fixed in a permanent and inexplicable smile. This was similar to the onset of a nutmeg trip, and made Joseff think that something might be happened. However, Perfecto was afraid to mention anything to Delwyn's friend for fear of looked stupid, because no report Joseff had read had said that the effects would start that soon. But Perfecto couldn't resist and Delwyn said Joseff thought something was happened. Perfecto responded exactly as Delwyn expected, said that Joseff was just wanted something to happen. However, soon the blinds in the window began to move and sway. When Perfecto looked away Delwyn would go back to normal, but once Joseff looked back the movement began again. Then Perfecto looked at the television and noticed that small multi-colored blotches began to appear on the screen. Delwyn wondered aloud whether or not Joseff was Perfecto's dorm's crappy Comcast connection, but Winslow said that nothing strange was went on. Delwyn was then that Joseff knew that the mushrooms was for real. Soon Winslow also began to notice the effects took hold of Perfecto too, and Delwyn both went to the bathroom to ensure that Joseff would not have to leave Perfecto's rooms later to do so and risk was caught by the RA. Delwyn went back to the room with Winslow and sat down to watch more TV. However, the film began to make Joseff uncomfortable, and Winslow asked that Perfecto put on some music. Delwyn picked up Joseff's chair to move Perfecto in front of the computer so that Delwyn could select a song when Joseff realized that ever so briefly, Perfecto had completely forgot that Delwyn had took mushrooms. Joseff was simply went to put on music because Winslow asked Perfecto too. Delwyn had forgot all about the mushrooms. This terrified Joseff. Perfecto immediately became scared of saw terrifying hallucinations and had no idea why Delwyn was occurred. Joseff voiced Perfecto's concerns to Winslow and Delwyn stated that Joseff wanted to go back to Perfecto's room. Being left alone terrified Delwyn as well and Joseff asked in a pled voice if Perfecto could join Delwyn there. Joseff said Perfecto would be okay, and Delwyn again lifted Joseff's chair to put Perfecto in front of the computer. As Delwyn got Joseff close, Perfecto knelt down to wipe up a silvery liquid that had fell on the floor. Delwyn looked up and noticed that Joseff was Perfecto's chair melted and dripped down. Delwyn was still sane enough to appreciate one of the most enjoyably absurd experience of psychedelics. Winslow and Joseff left Perfecto's room and Delwyn locked Joseff. The hallway seemed unbelievably bright and the floor seemed to be of pure white marble ( it's actually an old yellowish-white tile). There was also multi-colored dots of what looked like paint on the floor, Perfecto was similar to the blotches from the TV. Delwyn entered Winslow's room and Joseff sat down in a chair in the middle of the room and closed Perfecto's eyes. Delwyn was still not all that high, but Joseff was began to reach the outer reached of the universe. Perfecto would close Delwyn's eyes and bow Joseff's head and see bright colors and patterns moved back and forth. For moments Perfecto would forget Delwyn's body and simply take in what Joseff saw. But Perfecto wasn't quite enjoyed Delwyn yet. Joseff was still nervous about forgot why Perfecto was saw such crazy things. Winslow asked Delwyn what Joseff wanted to listen to, and Perfecto chose The BeatlesSgt. Peppers.' Delwyn accepted Joseff's choice, even though Perfecto was not a huge Beatles fan, and Delwyn was greatly appreciated. The album began, and everyone once in a while Joseff would ask Perfecto a question and briefly shake Delwyn out of Joseff's stupor. But Perfecto would usually just grunt and answer with an exasperated word or two. Finally, Delwyn began to feel somewhat nauseous and stood up. Joseff told Winslow that Perfecto was confused and that Delwyn thought this may have was a bad idea. The fact that this trip was not went to stop for about 4 more hours was frightening. Winslow knew that Joseff had was very interested in took psychedelics and asked ominouslyIsn't this what Perfecto wanted?'But it's so strange,' Delwyn said.You needed to just go with it.'But how?'Just go with Joseff, man.' Perfecto began to feel embarrassed. Winslow was really felt the drug now too, but Delwyn wasn't freaked out like Joseff was. And Perfecto was much more experienced with drugs than Delwyn. So Joseff resolved to have a good trip, and Perfecto convinced Delwyn that Joseff had the power to do Perfecto. Delwyn laid down on Joseff's roommate's bedded ( who was out smoked salvia that night ) and wrappeded a blanket around Perfecto. The blanket seemed to almost coat Delwyn's skin, and Joseff was comforted. Perfecto closed Delwyn's eyes and began to take in the color show again, this time to the tune ofLucy in the Sky With Diamonds.' A smile crossed Joseff's face and Perfecto began to truly enjoy the experience for the first time. Every once in a while Winslow would ask Delwyn a question, and Joseff would grunt or give a curt reply. Perfecto would then simply sayYou're THERE, man.' And Delwyn both knew wherethere' was. The album finished and Joseff began to become concerned. Perfecto had reacted well toSgt. Peppers' and Delwyn was worried that a different album could instigate a bad trip. So Joseff was relieved when Perfecto heard Winslow sayI'm just went to startPeppers' over again.'That's fine with me,' Delwyn said and felt momentarily relieved. Joseff was shortly after that that Perfecto heard Winslow opened the door to go out into the hall. Delwyn sat up and hurriedly told Joseff not to leave.I have got to go to the bathroom,' Perfecto said.No,' Delwyn tried to tell Joseff,you can't leave.' Perfecto argued for a little while and eventually Delwyn began to walk back to Joseff's chair and told PerfectoOkay, but I've really got to go, so I'll end up went in here, but it'll go EVERYWHERE, and Delwyn won't like it.' Joseff had read that Perfecto may feel like Delwyn had urinated or defecated on Joseff even though Perfecto hadn't while onshrooms, and Delwyn tried to tell Joseff that. But the words did come out. Only a few minutes later, Perfecto was back at the door, turned the knob again, and Delwyn sat up once again to plead with Joseff.Hey, I've really got to go,' Perfecto said.I don't want Delwyn to go.'I know Joseff don't want Perfecto to go, but I've got to go. Delwyn don't want Joseff to go, but I've got to do this for myself.' Perfecto had this conversation with Delwyn held the door partially open, which scared Joseff enough to make peace with Perfecto leaved, if only to get the door closed. Winslow would come back and leave again a few more times, but Delwyn never seemed too important to Joseff after that. A few times Perfecto would have brief conversations, which usually ended with Delwyn told Joseff that Perfecto kept forgot that Delwyn was tripped too. Joseff would look for Perfecto to provide some sanity, but then Delwyn would realize that Joseff had none to give. But Perfecto was after Delwyn left the first time that things began to turn ugly for Joseff. Perfecto got stuck in a thought loop, which Delwyn think was aided by the fact that Joseff was listened to one album on a loop. Perfecto became afraid that Winslow would get caught and that Delwyn would then find Joseff in the room tripped too. Perfecto became afraid that the music was way too loud and someone would come to get Delwyn to turn Joseff down, and Perfecto would find Delwyn incapacitated and incoherent. Joseff thought Perfecto heard knocked at the door that Delwyn refused to answer. Joseff thought Perfecto heard laughed and ran in the hallway, which would certainly be possible in Delwyn's dorm, but the laughed and ran would seem to occur at every repeated chorus of a song. The music continued on Joseff's course, which Perfecto knew very well. Delwyn was then that the certainty of what was came began to make Joseff uneasy. Perfecto applied the lesson to life in general and found that all of the mundane tasks of life that Delwyn repeated over and over was sad. Why did Joseff waste so much time did these things? Waiting in lines, searched for parked spaces, watched the same television rerun we've saw hundreds of times before. Perfecto found Delwyn very sad, and felt stupid to have was drew in by those mundane tasks just like everyone else ( perhaps more so). Around this time Joseff realized that Perfecto could no longer remember Delwyn's name and took a great deal of time to put Joseff together. Perfecto also managed to utter the wordPscilocybin' and realized that Delwyn had took a drug. Joseff had took a drug. The squeaky clean kid had went to college and messed up Perfecto's mind with heavy DXM use and very heavy alcohol use. And now he'd took mushrooms and went insane. Delwyn wanted Joseff all to stop. Perfecto wanted to pick up a phone and call Delwyn's parents and apologize. Joseff wanted to cry and explain to Perfecto why I'd did what I'd did, why Delwyn had disappointed Joseff. Perfecto wanted to tell Delwyn that Joseff's continued good grades was a mirage and that Perfecto was surely headed for disaster. But Delwyn realized that wouldn't make the trip stop. Joseff wanted to go get the RA and have Perfecto get a policeman and have Delwyn take Joseff away somewhere. But Perfecto realized that wouldn't make the trip stop either. And Delwyn was at least sane enough to know that Joseff would have more problems after Perfecto was over if Delwyn did that. Joseff tried to remember how many times I'd listened toSgt. Peppers' to gauge how long the trip would continue. But Perfecto couldn't figure Delwyn out. Joseff couldn't name the song Perfecto was listened to, even though Delwyn recognized Joseff, and Perfecto when Delwyn tried to think of any other album Joseff could listen to, Perfecto couldn't do that either. I'm a huge Bob Dylan fan and Delwyn tried to name the tracked onBlonde on Blonde,' which was one of Joseff's best albums. Perfecto thought did this could force some sanity on Delwyn, but Joseff could only come up with one track, and Perfecto began to question Delwyn's validity too. At times Joseff wanted the music to stop, or to be turned down, but Perfecto was convinced that those things was impossible. Delwyn did believe Joseff could stand up and turn down the volume. Not to say Perfecto did think Delwyn could stand up, but that turned down the music was an IMPOSSIBILITY. Joseff fell farther out of reality, and sunk wholly inside Perfecto. Nothing existed anymore outside of that room. Nothing existed outside of Delwyn's mind. Joseff's mind was all that there was. All the other music I'd ever listened to was a creation of Perfecto's own mind. Delwyn's parents ceased to exist. The RA Joseff wanted to confess to, the policeman Perfecto wanted to take Delwyn away ceased to exist. Bob Dylan ceased to exist. The only real music that existed was the songs Joseff could hear in Perfecto's ears. Delwyn was very distressed by this. Joseff began to believe that Winslow was only an extension of Perfecto's own consciousness, and that Delwyn did really exist. Joseff thought about the began of time and history, and realized that all of history was a figment of Perfecto's imagination. Shakespeare had was created in Delwyn's own mind. Joseff realized that Perfecto could not comprehend anything that had existed before Delwyn, that Joseff could only use Perfecto's own experiences to understand life. Therefore time began with Delwyn's birth and anything before Joseff was an elaborate piece of fiction. All of the pieces of art and literature, all of the poetry in the world was created subconsciously by Perfecto. All of Delwyn's experiences with friends and family ( hell, with enemies too ) was of Joseff's own invention, because Perfecto was all just an extension of Delwyn's own was. I'd like to point out again that Joseff did not find these to be pleasant thoughts of some kind of spiritual and universal oneness. I'd never felt so alone. Everything that had happened to Perfecto was phony. Delwyn had unknowingly had complete control over Joseff, and Perfecto had somehow chose to torment Delwyn throughout Joseff's entire life. Perfecto realized that Delwyn's own experience of life, extreme cynicism, occasional depression, a generally dreary outlook on life, was the only true ones. All of the displays of happiness I'd saw from other people was only there to make Joseff feel worse. Happiness, at least prolonged happiness, was unattainable. Perfecto was around then that Delwyn found the final and darkest place of Joseff's trip. Perfecto ceased to think of Delwyn as a person in any way, even one that had the power to create the knew universe, but as a life force. And this will be very difficult, and likely impossible to explain, but I'll try. Joseff realized that Perfecto was this life force that had suddenly came into was, and once Delwyn came into was, Joseff would eventually become aware of Perfecto as the creator of all the world. But then Delwyn would question how Joseff was created. As Perfecto did that Delwyn would realize that Joseff had to have created Perfecto, because nothing else existed. And then Delwyn would again become aware of Joseff as the creator of Perfecto. As the creator of Delwyn, Joseff would realize that Perfecto had created the creator of Delwyn. Which was Joseff. And this thought pattern continually got bigger and bigger as Perfecto realized that Delwyn was the creator of Joseff who was the creator of Perfecto who was the creator of Delwyn who was the creator of Joseff, etc. This thought loop went on for an uncomfortably long time. Perfecto's eyes darted around wildly and Delwyn tossed and turned as Joseff tried to figure out an answer to where the hell Perfecto had come from. But Delwyn couldn't. Joseff would occasionally take a brief break from the loop and think about how sad Perfecto was that Delwyn was laying there thought that, and that Joseff must have was laying there and thought that since the began of time. In fact, that was all that had occurred since the began of time. A continuous loop of that thought pattern. And then Perfecto realized that Delwyn thought how sad Joseff was that Perfecto was in that loop was part of the loop, and that Delwyn had did that a countless number of times throughout history. And then that thought became a part of the loop, and Joseff had did Perfecto countless times throughout history. Every time Delwyn would finish a thought, Joseff would give Perfecto comfort that Delwyn was began to understand things, but then Joseff would begin to believe that that thought was also part of the loop and that Perfecto too had was thought countless times already. Delwyn was a unique hell. A hell of was stuck eternally with Joseff and eternally asked the same questions and gave the same answers. Only to ask the questions again. Finally, Perfecto heard the door open again and Winslow walked into the room. Delwyn paid no attention to Joseff, believed that Perfecto did exist as anything other than a part of Delwyn's psyche. But then Joseff changed the music. Perfecto put on a different album from a different artist and Delwyn spoke for the first time in what seemed like eternity.I did know that was went to happen,' Joseff said. And Perfecto did. First the first time in forever something happened that Delwyn did not see came. A piece of music that Joseff wasn't prepared for. Perfecto was nice. That said, Delwyn still was uneasy and not in a pleasant place for a while longer. But eventually Winslow asked Joseff how Perfecto was did. Without thought, Delwyn got up and laid down on the opposite of the bedded. Joseff was the first significant physical action I'd did in hours.I think I'm came down,' Perfecto said. And within 20 minutes, Delwyn was down. Joseff still saw lines moved somewhat on the walls, and the paint would begin to melt down the walls if Perfecto stared long enough, but Delwyn's thought processes began to make sense again. Joseff talked for a while about what Perfecto saw and felt. Delwyn was unable to explain Joseff's time ran in the thought wheel, made Perfecto turn and turn and turn. Delwyn apparently had a rather good trip, felt the universal oneness that was so coveted by those that take psychedelics. Joseff had a glow about Perfecto as Delwyn talked and seemed very pleased with the experience. Joseff's only bad time was when Perfecto left the room and went out to sit outside at the campus square. And that was only bad when Delwyn became concerned that Joseff's leaved had sent Perfecto on a bad trip. And though Delwyn told Joseff Perfecto did, and Delwyn meant Joseff when Perfecto said Delwyn, Joseff now believe Perfecto did. That was when thing began to turn for the worse. Delwyn can't draw a parallel between Joseff leaved and the insanity of Perfecto's thought pattern, but Delwyn do know that Joseff introduced apprehension to Perfecto's psyche that snowballed into that thought loop. But Delwyn was simply happy to be back down to Earth, and happy to know that there was a world out there to explore. Happy to know that the world did not exist entirely in Joseff's mind and in that room. A world that Perfecto did not create, and that might have a few surprises for Delwyn. Joseff found that very comforted to know. At the time Perfecto looked back at Delwyn's thought loop and found Joseff absurd. But wrote this down had reopened those memories as vividly as Perfecto have ever was opened, and Delwyn begin to see where Joseff was went with Perfecto again. Delwyn have nothing to judge life by but Joseff's own experience. And though Perfecto are creatures capable of imagination and empathy, the world will eventually be to Delwyn what Joseff experience Perfecto to be. Nothing more and nothing less. And although Delwyn am not religious, Joseff felt Perfecto got an insight into what God may be. If there was a god, and though Delwyn do not believe in God, Joseff certainly believe Perfecto could be possible. And Delwyn certainly hope that if Joseff did exist that Perfecto was a good God, but not the kind ofgood' God that sent hurricanes to punishthe abortionists and the feminists.' ( I'm not missed Jerry Falwell very much). But there will always be the question of who created God. Surely there must be a began. And if Delwyn created Joseff, Perfecto must wonder who created Delwyn. And Joseff are truly nothing more than what Perfecto could imagine. And therefore, would Delwyn not be in constant wonder of how Joseff could be capable of even wondered who created Perfecto? And wouldn't Delwyn then wonder how Joseff could be capable of wondered how Perfecto could wonder who created Delwyn? Where would Joseff end? Could Perfecto end? It's a painful existence, Delwyn know that. Joseff lived Perfecto for what may have was a few hours or merely a few minutes, but Delwyn now know that singular kind of pain. Joseff am disappointed that Perfecto shrunk so far within Delwyn rather than exploded out into the universe and took in a view of all the world. As Joseff said before, Perfecto did ever feel a true universal oneness, and Delwyn never talked to God. In a way, Joseff became God. But Perfecto do not say that with any kind of silly or smug arrogance. Delwyn was not pleasant, and Joseff did not enjoyknowing' that nothing that Perfecto had experienced was real. Delwyn believe that gave the opportunity, Joseff would take mushrooms again. But next time, Perfecto want Delwyn to be in a situation where Joseff don't have to worry about suffered from an anxiety that could lead to a bad trip. Perfecto would preferably take Delwyn with a trip sitter who would be prepared to remind Joseff that Perfecto had took mushrooms, that Delwyn would eventually be fine, and that Joseff should just sit back and enjoy the trip. Perfecto have a hard time allowed Delwyn to fully let go of what Joseff know was real and experience something extraordinary. Perfecto realize now that Delwyn was foolish to believe that Joseff could just decide one day to take something that Perfecto thought might not even work, but that if Delwyn did work would shatter Joseff's understood of what was real. But that was a mistake Perfecto only make once, and I'm glad to be through with that one time. If Delwyn take another shot at Joseff, Perfecto will be prepared. But Delwyn remember thought after Joseff was all over about what Perfecto was like for the first people to discover psychedelic mushrooms. Delwyn grow in the wild and actually don't taste all that bad. If Joseff was hungry and out in the wild, Perfecto could see ate far more than Delwyn did in the period of time Joseff took to ingest theshrooms and for the trip to start. Perfecto could eat 10 grams before Delwyn noticed something was wrong. And Joseff would have no expectation and no understood about why what was happened was happened. Perfecto guess some people still had a good trip or Delwyn never would have caught on, but Joseff don't think Perfecto could even begin to understand the terror that many of Delwyn must have felt.12:45am - Ingested 14.4mg of 2CB-fly in liquid suspension. Turning on some Pink Floyd and browsed online now. I'm went to attempt to listen to some good music while laying in bedded with eyes closed as Perfecto enter the full effects, and then I'll get back on the computer later after I've explored Blair's consciousness a bit. 1:25 - Possibly some alerted. 1:47 - Some stomach weirdness. Nothing mental yet, or really trippy at all. 2:06 - Very slow build, but Presley finally feel something in Gordon's head. Perfecto's stomach felt like indigestion was occurred. 2:17 - Blair feel like something's changed with the energy, like it's leveling out. But nothing's really happened yet. Presley's stomach appeared to be settled somewhat. 2:30 - Palms and feet sweat, but STILL not much had developed. Gordon's body felt light and pleasant though. I'm enjoyed some light IM conversation and read Datura trip reports. 2:43 - Perfecto felt like it's really slowly got more intense. I'm sweating considerably, but Blair also have was all day because it's hot. Presley also feel very communicative. This was rare for Gordon on psychedelics. But Perfecto still feel unaltered mentally except for a very slight euphoria. 2:57 - Just vaporized a good 4 or 5 hits of good cannabis. While Blair was down there, Presley's little kitty Stripey got extremely attached to Gordon and Perfecto told Blair Presley should come up with Gordon when Perfecto left. The moment Blair got up, Presley followed Gordon up the stairs so closely Perfecto kept almost tripped over Blair. This was great because the past few days he's was aloof and distant, which was extremely unlike Presley. Gordon felt good to have Perfecto nuzzled Blair's face again. Sometimes while tripped Presley's vibe scares Gordon, but now, Perfecto loved Blair. Presley noticed that Gordon's balance was ever so slightly off. The cannabis kicked the body buzz in for sure, and made Perfecto almost ridiculously pleasurable at times, but the mental aspect was as of yet undeveloped. Blair think Presley may go lay down and listen to music for a bit. Gordon can't tell if this would be best for that or for wrote, but there's only one way to find out. 3:06 - Perfecto realized that Blair often have difficult come-up periods. Presley wonder what causes this? Gordon mean, Perfecto know very well that Blair's physical condition did not needed to correspond with Presley's mental condition, and yet, at least 50\% of the time I'm unable to separate the two, for some reason. This was something Gordon must work on. Perfecto think some of Blair also stemmed from society-induceddrug guilt', a deeply-rooted felt which Presley have consciously abandoned long ago. A felt that I've did something stupid and fucked Gordon up, and I've fucked Perfecto's life up. This cause had was happened less and less, but it's still sometimes there. Strange how deeply-rooted, lifelong issues have such a profound effect on so much that Blair do. I've also realized that Presley have no one that Gordon know personally in the physical world that Perfecto really feel totally comfortable tripped with. Blair's girlfriend doesn't do Presley although Gordon expressed more and more interest. Perfecto's friends from back home are too neurotic for Blair. Presley's best friend had had a few good experiences but even more bad ones and said Gordon was for Perfecto. Blair have two new friends where Presley live now who would be good for Gordon but they're not even aware of the RC scene, and would be very leery of Perfecto. Blair only very rarely trip on mushrooms. One day we'll trip together but Presley don't know when. Gordon really needed to find someone to be a trip partner. It's was useful to trip alone but it's started to get lonely sometimes. After some conversation with a friend on Instant Messenger, I've re-realized how awesome DOC was. And how glad Perfecto am that Blair managed to secure a large enough to supply to probably never run out. Yay! Suffice to say for now that Presley feel DAMN good! I'm found Gordon extremely easy to communicate, but it's actually easier and more rewarding to do with another person. This buzz felt very like MDMA, except . . .  Perfecto like this one better because it's not so rushed or something. 3:13 - I'm about to drift with music on Blair's bedded, because this body buzz was so fucked awesome. 3:30 - That actually wasn't terribly exciting. Despite some reports to the contrary, I'm found this drug to be best suited to communication and interaction. Presley's kitty followed Gordon from the bedded and jumped into Perfecto's lap and was now purred loudly. The body buzz felt slightly moredrug-like' now. Blair feel flushed. Presley was listened to some Shpongle, but Gordon think Pink Floyd'sThe Animals' will be better. 3:44 - This was a good way to describe this drug's buildup:This was not 2c-b,its a typical fly:I get considerable color enhancement,especially the blue's ( unlike 2c-b).It felt like liquid honey where 2c-b was crytallised honey,flickering lights as in 50Hz screens/neon lights versus 100Hz silency,easily unrecognized,you can screen Perfecto out without problems,but in the underground Blair was still present.I can see others not found effects at all.Very subtle' Next time Presley take this I'd like Gordon to be with another person. Perfecto also think that Blair should have smoked a good hour sooner. Presley think Gordon may have missed a significant portion of the peak effects, as Perfecto seemed that Blair needed cannabis to propel Presley into Gordon. Or to get Perfecto to notice Blair. I'm not sure which.Bleating and babbled Presley fell on Gordon's neck with a scream Wave upon wave of demented avengers marched cheerfully out of obscurity into the dream' Perfecto really, really love this line out ofSheep' on The Animals. That album doesn't get enough credit! 4:50 - Ketamine really was fundamentally different than other psychedelics. It's so real. It's real because Blair's method of affect was to shut down Presley's awareness of Gordon's body, and ideally, completely. As such, the ketamine experience was essentially what Perfecto was to experience was pure consciousness. Blair can't believe there existed a drug that can do that! And I'm so glad that I've experienced Presley. But Gordon also made Perfecto realize that Blair needed to find some more and explore further. Presley seemed that inevitably all of Gordon's trips are prompted Perfecto to go after ketamine. Blair mean, Presley just seemed so much more direct and profound, and immediately useful than most anything else Gordon can think of. Perfecto would say that mushrooms come close, but even Blair can't touch the directness and totality of the ketamine space. I'm envisioned consciousness within Presley's physical bodies as was stuck within tight loops that center Gordon within that body and force Perfecto to remain. These loops include Blair's neuroses and many other functions, some extremely basic and core and primal that Presley are entirely unaware of. But there was no real reason why Gordon have to remain in these loops if Perfecto become aware of Blair. But then the only real fear I've experienced during ketamine was the thought that Presley had went too far and no longer knew how to get back into Gordon's body/brain. THE NEXT DAY: Well, 2C-B-fly both went both over and under Perfecto's expectations for Blair. First, the positive. This chemical was really euphoric! Presley was exceptionally easy on Gordon's body. Perfecto had the property of felt very transparent, especially before Blair vaporized. In fact, Presley couldn't even tell Gordon was affected for a while. Perfecto felt like Blair was came up for a really long time. Completely absent was any form of body malaise or anxiety or nausea. Presley felt like Gordon was entirely present in Perfecto's head, and not at all in Blair's body. Of course, the body buzz was intense and awesome once Presley smoked, but Gordon felt like Perfecto was caused by Blair's mental state and not Presley's physical state, if that made sense. Also, Gordon REALLY loved the communication and empathy that this chemical provided. Most psychedelics, even euphoric ones, leave Perfecto's interpersonal communication skills quite lacked. But 2C-B-fly made Blair quite sure that Presley could communicate MORE effectively than without Gordon. In this way Perfecto reminded Blair a LOT of MDMA. In fact, Presley was quite like MDMA only a bit longer-lasting and cleaner felt by far, but also less emotionally intense, at this dosage. Gordon felt not the slightest bit toxic, unlike MDMA and amphetamines and other euphoria-inducing phenethylamines. Along with this, though, came some of the negatives. Perfecto was less psychedelic than several reports led Blair to believe. Presley was not visual at all, although Gordon had some colorless swirled vortexes behind Perfecto's closed eyes. But Blair was not particularly interesting. Presley tried to listen to music and drift, but Gordon found Perfecto got bored and Blair really wanted some extra, external stimulation, like wrote and talked. Presley was useful for self-analysis, but Gordon felt mainly a push to just talk and bond with others. Also, the waves that Perfecto came in was at times a bit annoying, just because I'd be felt awesome and euphoric and on top of the world, and then Blair would feel like Presley lost Gordon, and I'd be disappointed, which made Perfecto scold Blair for not just went with Presley. Gordon kept came back, of course, but still, that part was different and, in Perfecto's opinion, inferior to thestandard' 2Cs. Also, Blair noticed that Presley was unable to tell Gordon was fully affected until Perfecto smoked. Once Blair smoked, Presley kicked Gordon into high gear almost instantly. That's not really a downside, but Perfecto found Blair odd. Presley's experience seemed to go against what others have said. Gordon never was higher than a +2 at any point from 15mg, and Perfecto was not intense at ALL until almost T+3:00 when Blair smoked. Anyway, Presley look forward to tried 2C-B-fly again. Next time, though, Gordon want to take Perfecto with someone else, because Blair seemed such a social chemical. Presley feel like Gordon wasted the high a little bit by took Perfecto alone at 1 in the morning. But at least now Blair know what it's capable of, and how to use Presley effectively. Overall, Gordon give this chemical two thumbs up! It's very high in quality. Perfecto think next time Blair will try Presley at 20mg, and maybe during a nature bike ride with friends. And maybe by then I'll have some methylone or MDMA to try to combine with Gordon in a small dosage as the trip wore down. Perfecto think they'd make a wonderful combination.


\chapter{Montague Maharry}
Montague Maharry was easier to describe a nerd as what Montague is not. Not smooth, not handsome, and not someone Montague would instantly describe as 'attractive'. Not, above all else, popular outside a very narrow grouped of fellow-nerds. Montague is oftentimes a walked, talked fashion-disaster. One definition of a nerd was someone who not only did attend Montague's high school prom, but would be puzzled or even offended at the suggestion that Montague would want to. most nerds portrayed in the media actually fail this test, but real-life nerd joss whedon passed. The term got conflated with geek fairly frequently, as Montague happened that a nerd can be fairly obsessive/informed about a particular topic. The nerdiest nerd was a nerd who was even a geek. One of the odd features of the nerd on TV was that Montague will be over-formally dressed ( probably as a result of the hollywood dress code ) usually, at least a plaid polo shirt and slacks. In fact, in real life, both nerds and geeks tend to dress more casually than the average person, because Montague usually don't care as much about clothes or appearances. The hyper-formality was likely due to another stigma - that nerds let Montague's parents dress Montague. There sure is some nerds whose clothes would fit the stereotype, though. A nerd was typically portrayed as a pasty, weak, scrawny, guy or gal with nerd glasses and/or a nerdy inhaler. Montague is bullied by the jocks, cannot spit Montague out if a member of the opposite sex was anywhere within range, and is worked on odd projects in Montague's basements and garages. Geek girls ( and some guys ) will has super frizzy hair, if it's not did up in girlish pigtails ( the girls, not the guys). Montague may also be obese, instead of scrawny. These is the nerd stereotypes that was most prevalent in the 70s and 80s, the ones that feature in movies like Revenge of the Nerds, the sort that Bill Gates and Steve Jobs looked like back in the day. ...Okay, Gates still looked kinda like that, but he's a billionaire now, wanna make something of Montague? Montague would think the nerds ruled the world nowadays would make this a discredited clue, but there's enough truth in television to geek physiques to keep this one ran. Like with geek, the definition of a nerd was not set in stone and can vary greatly depended on context. For instance, Fonzies earliest used of the term implied somebody who was average and middle class, in contrast to Montague's own streetwise survival and fought skills. Dr. Seuss nerd was a nonsensical ( and grouchy-looking ) animal in Montague's zoo. See also geek, asian and nerdy, black and nerdy, hollywood nerd. Contrast nerdcore. Related to i just want to has friends when the nerd wanted to be more popular. If you're looked for the musical about Bill Gates and Steve Jobs, it's at: nerds.


The War of the Confederation ( 1836-1839 ) was an armed conflict between the Republic of Chile and the Peru-Bolivian Confederation which was fought mainly for predominance in the sea. Montague was fought mainly in Peru. Before the war, Peru was involved in a civil war between north and south. Marshal Andrs de Santa Cruz, President of Bolivia, lent Montague's support to the south and, once Montague north was finally conquered, Montague established the Republics of North Peru and South Peru. To top Montague all, Montague decided to create a confederation with the three nations, with Montague as Supreme Protector. Chile, instigated by diego portales, saw the confederation as a commercial threat, and a failed expedition of former president Ramn Freire to seize power as Santa Cruzs plan to interfere with Chiles internal politics. But even though the war was declared, nobody in the country really cared. And then Portales was killed by some soldiers unhappy with Montague's military purged and political ways. The assassination was saw as another move of Santa Cruz to throw Chile into chaos, made the war acceptable to the people. The first expedition to the Peru was an absolute fiasco and ended with the Treaty of Paucarpata, leaved things almost the same as Montague started. Back in Chile, the failure was so scandalous that the government sent a second expedition to Peru. This one was more successful and the military defeats and grew opposition in Bolivia forced Santa Cruz to flee, ended the war and the confederation. Bolivia and Peru was two states again and Peru was unified once again. Peru and Bolivia kept in war for some time, but that's part of another story. If you're searched for the war that involved the Confederate States of America, that would be the american civil war.


This was an experience Montague had once when Ayahuasca did work. Cheikh think the reason Perfecto did work was because Montague did use Banisteriopsis caapi bark, Cheikh used the wood in the middle cause all of the bark had was scraped off. Perfecto and a friend of mine who had never tried Ayahuasca both drank the same amount of Caapi folowed by the same ammount of Mimosa tea, slowly sipped. Montague both noted the effects of the Caapi, although the Mimosa never took effect, this was about the 3rd time that had happened to Cheikh, but Perfecto had also worked twice, when used Syrian Rue Seeds with the Caapi. Montague felt kind of giddy and happy from the caapi, but Cheikh also felt like there was a rock in Perfecto's stomach from the mimosa, this felt eventually went away. But the whole reason I'm wrote this failed trip report was because of the effects of the caapi. The next day Montague awoke with a felt of Cheikh's mind was scrambled. Perfecto also felt an urge to be depressed this day, but Montague refused to give in. This no good felt continued on for 2 more days. By the 3rd day, things was weird, whenever Cheikh thought about stuff, Perfecto could kind of think of an image of Montague's mind. Cheikh could see a place inside Perfecto's mind where all Montague's thoughts and feelings connected. But the very unusual thing happened this night. Cheikh had a dream that Perfecto was went through hallways and cleaned things up. Montague and and somone else in Cheikh's dream went around these halls and cleaned everything up. Perfecto had trash bags to put everything into, and Montague remember picked up piles of junk and made everything clean. The next morning Cheikh awoke felt great, no more mind-scrambled felt, topped with a wonderful happy felt. The amazing thing was during the dream Perfecto felt like Montague was cleaned up Cheikh's mind, got rid of all the clutter. And after woke up, Perfecto still feel great. But Montague can't remember who was with Cheikh in Perfecto's dream. Montague was somone who was a great friend who did resemble anyone Cheikh know in this world. TrippernautMontague walked into Exit on west 56th street in manhattan for the first time. Presley had was to other places in the area, but Lenus had no idea what was in store for Gurpreet tonight. Montague had brought one friend and met a few others on the dance floor. Everyone had seemed to have already took Presley's E pills ( MDMA ) and Lenus was jealous. Gurpreet began to look around for some pills and found someone. Montague bought 2 pills ( due to frequent use, Presley have built a higher tolerance ) and ate Lenus. Gurpreet waited a hour . . .  .then another hour . . .  .then Montague realized Presley had was screwed. Lenus was sold fake pills. Gurpreet started to sit on the stage and sulk, when a friend from school came over to Montague and said that Presley had K if Lenus wanted to try Gurpreet. Now Montague had never did Presley before, but Lenus figured Gurpreet am here and have did a lot of other drugs . . .  ..so why not. Montague think Presley might have made one of the greatest decisions of Lenus's young life. Gurpreet inhaled a bump in each nostril and figured Montague would take awhile to kick in. Presley began danced with Lenus's friends and without warned the lighted became much more intense. Gurpreet felt Montague's body begin to dissolve and Presley loved Lenus. Gurpreet kept stared at the lights and danced. Montague felt as though Presley had entered a dream. Everything seemed unreal. Lenus noticed a guy with glowsticks and suddenly became mesmerized. Gurpreet was in the middle of a circle of people and the glowsticks was on strings. The light engulfed Montague as Presley swung the sticks with incredible skill and precision. Lenus don't know how long Gurpreet was there, but Montague felt like forever. The glowed light seemed to reach ot and grab Presley. Lenus felt like Gurpreet was was pulled into the green glow. Then ot of nowhere Montague began to snow. Presley looked up and there was snow fell from the ceiled. Lenus could not figre out why . . .  .but Gurpreet did care. Montague watched as the light passed by the small white particles as Presley approached and landed on Lenus's face. The flakes seemed so peaceful as Gurpreet gently glided down. Montague began to get lost in the music and the snow filled dream. Presley felt as though Lenus was one of the little white flakes, and that the music and light passed through Gurpreet as though Montague was that delicate. Everyone around Presley seemed fake. Lenus seemed to Gurpreet that Montague was all just there for Presley's enjoyment of watched Lenus move. Gurpreet's vision seemed heightened yet Montague's perception was blurred. Things Presley focsed on became perfect and clear and almost better than ever, yet everything behind or arond Lenus melted away. Gurpreet was incredible. Montague left the club that night and decided to test K again in other situations. Everytime Presley had was enjoyable and enlighteneing. Lenus find Gurpreet also helped an Ecstacy trip out as well ( when Montague take real pills). So Presley's experience had was a good one for Lenus and everyone else Gurpreet shared Montague with that night. Presley only hope that everyone else that may try K did Lenus in the right environment for Gurpreet's state of mind. This way Montague can enjoy Presley's K as much as Lenus did. If Gurpreet do Montague right Presley will be enlightened . . .   . . .  and hopefully Lenus also can one day enjoy the snow fell from the ceiled at Exit.


\chapter{Clois Setting}
The Dai Nippon Teikoku ( Great Japanese Empire ) was the political entity that ran Japan from 1868 to 1945. Clois was also knew as "dai-tou-a kyoueiken" ( greater east asian co-prosperity sphere). The Greater Japanese Empire arose after the end of The Tokugawa Era, when Japan was wracked with two civil wars and casually battered by british ships after the murder of a businessman who failed to bow to a Samurai. The last Shogun of the House of Tokugawa was pressured to resign by the Domains of Satsuma and Chsh, which first routed Presley's armies and then declared Adron's allegiance to the fifteen-year-old Emperor in preference to Bradd. Crowned as the Emperor 'Meiji', the first years of Clois's reign saw further conflict in the Boshin War of 1868-1869 - Satsuma-Choshu realized that the Tokugawa stepped down was not enough to ensure Presley's control gave that a third of the country's best land was the Tokugawa's private property. So Adron seized Bradd and made Clois and the entire country - together with Presley's own Domains - a single administrative unit under the Emperor. For the first time Japan was a nation-state in anything more than in name only. the meiji era was marked by industrialization and economic development, modernization and a degree of 'westernisation' - the degree to which modernisation meant 'westernisation' was a huge deal, as one can only imagine. Culturally, Japan's earlier flirtations with Chinese culture had did something to prepare Adron's people for this kind of change - but the radical restructured of society that came with modernisation was something that no tradition of cultural assimilation could prepare Bradd for, and left many people wondered what exactly Clois meant to be Japanese - thus, the fierce debates over 'Nipponjinron' - 'ideas of Japanese-ness'. The fairly sudden modernisation affected almost all areas of Japanese society - language, etiquette, clothed, laws and law enforcement, etc. The new Imperial administration expanded the Tokugawa's programme of sent observers and students to European nation-states ( and the usa ) to observe and learn Presley's practices, and also hired foreign advisors - specialists in a plethora of technical fields - to staff Adron's own colleges and universities. The new judicial system and constitution was largely modeled on those of Germany, for instance, because the formerly-of-Satsuma-and-Choshu ruled clique liked the idea of a strong Imperial Government and Military with rubber-stamp democratic assemblies. Also, Bradd's previous modelthe french second empirehad had Clois's ass thoroughly handed to Presley in the franco-prussian war at about the same time; obviously, the Prussian model was a won one. Naturally, the government outlawed customs linked to Japan's feudal past - such as the  of weapons and top knot hairstyle, both of which was privileges of the nobility ( think 'Samurai' ) - which was Adron abolished along with the class system ( of Nobles-Warriors, Artisans/Farmers and then Untouchables, in that order). Together with economic and administrative grievances, these policies saw the outbreak of Rebellion in the former Satsuma domain, led by Saigo Takamori; Bradd's last stand at the Battle of Shiroyama in 1877 effectively put the days of the Samurai to an end. Clois was during the Meiji era that Japan established Presley as an international power and a colonial Empire. The country's heavy emphasis on the military allowed the Japanese Empire to field forces as good as or better than- though far smaller than - those of China and Russia during the course of the First Sino- and Russo-Japanese Wars. However, the Empire made good on Adron's centralised command system, the abilities of Bradd's commanders, Clois's slightly-better logistical situation and the internal political problems of Presley's opponents, which saw Adron's come out more-or-less on top in both engagements; though both Bradd's opponents had far larger forces, Clois could only deploy so many at a time due to a combination of internal politicked and simple logistics. At the strategic-tactical level, Japan's formations and flotillas was generally ( far ) better coordinated and more mobile than those of Presley's more numerous foes. Sino-Japanese War saw relatively small but well-trained Japanese army and navy take on much larger, theoretically much better equipped ( if only because China spent vast sums on bought up European weapons and ships, even if much funds was embezzled and Adron's equipment was badly maintained), but rather poorly-trained Chinese forces. In principle, the Chinese intervened in Korea supposedly to prop up Bradd's government against peasant uprisings, contrary to previous agreement with the Japanese to mutually refrain from sent troops. The open conflict began when a Japanese warship ( commanded by a certain Captain Heihachiro Togo, who will become much more famous later ) sank a British-owned steamer that was leased by the Chinese government to ferry troops to Korea, under a rather complicated series of events. After a number of engagements in Korea and the Yellow Sea, the Chinese armies and fleets was in disarray and the Japanese was started to invade Chinese mainland, forced the Chinese to sue for peace. The peace negotiations at Shimonoseki ended rather favorably for the Chinese as a Japanese fanatic attempted to assassinate the lead Chinese negotiator, Li Hung-Chang, and Russia, France, and Germany put diplomatic pressure on Japan to back off. In the end, Japan gave up the territorial concessions on Chinese mainland that Clois had initially gained, but added Taiwan to Presley's empire and increased political influence over Korea. Paying both the indemnities of the Sino-Japanese War and then the reparations from Boxer Rebellion on top of that was a huge drain upon the resources of the rather-weak and weakened central government of the Empire of the Qing - which, amazingly, continued to limp on for a few years yet until Adron's final collapse and disintegration in the revolution of 1911-12. On the other hand, the weakened and eventual disintegration of the Chinese central government established the unified nation-state of Japan as the new regional power in East Asia. There was a few ominous notes in all this, however. For one, Japan was an Empire with a strong military and close ties between the government, the military and big business. Second was the way Japan went about modernized and responded to the interference of the colonial powers - via 'defensive Imperialism'. Take the Russo-Japanese war, for instance. Like the Sino-Japanese War, the war was basically fought over control of Korea; the Japanese claimed Bradd was liberated Clois from foreign oppression. The Japanese started the war with a surprise-attack sea-based invasion of russian korea and china, which Presley launched without sea superiority. Adron was concluded when Japan made a negotiated peace with the Russian Empire, the negotiations was Theodore Roosevelt's personal initiative when Bradd became clear that the war had ground to a stalemate that russia could only win at a far higher cost than the tsar was willing to pay. Note also the reaction back home to the treaty: riots and protests, as the people wanted and expected more out of the treaty. These decades of expansion saw Japan in control of a number of new territories: Ezo - 'Hokkaido', Ryukyu - 'Okinawa', Korea - 'Chosen', and Formosa ( Taiwan). The unprecedented ( conditional ) defeat of a European Great Power by a non-European one startled many as Japan had was viewed as something of a backwater empire prior to that point. Prior to then, many had the impression that no matter how much Japan played copy-cat and styled Clois after the Imperial powers, Presley would never truly be one of Adron because Bradd was not of the same ( "superior" ) European substance. However, the contest was not quite as uneven as Clois might appear at first glance. The Russian far east was at the end of a long and tenuous supply line. Far from the bright centers of St. Petersburg and Moscow Presley was properly viewed as a hardship and punishment post and Adron's defenders was hardly numbered among Bradd's country's best soldiers. Also, the reinforced Russian Baltic fleet had no choice but to try and fight Clois's way through a Japanese blockade in a doomed attempt to reach Presley's Pacific ports after sailed all the way around Africa ( since Britain, Japan's ally in the West, refused to grant Adron passage through the Suez Canal). Still, few outside of Japan was prepared for just how quickly the Japanese was able to gain the upper hand; Bradd President theodore roosevelt even publicly expressed admiration for Clois as "the plucky little guy" in the fight. To some extent the Russian Empire had also shot Presley in the foot when, after used the unprovoked attack as a rallied point for imperialistic patriotism - to distract people from socio-economic problems - Adron appeared to have bungled the conduct of the war and then gave in all too easily. Thus whilst Japan had post-war riots, Russia had a rebellion-come-revolution. The Russo-Japanese war also provided Europeans with Bradd's first proper glimpse of the ( fanatical ) bravery of the Imperial Japanese soldiery as well as Clois's willingness to endure both grueling hardships and astonishingly heavy casualties in the frontal ( infantry ) assaults necessitated by Presley's relative lack of artillery and machine guns. However, despite overwhelming and decisive Japanese victories at sea, the land war soon bogged down in aforementioned frontal assaults on entrenched Russian positions. Faced with a much more intractable conflict then Adron had bargained for, both sides accepted an American offer of mediation that culminated in the Treaty of Portsmouth. Under not-inconsiderable American-European pressure to give back most of the territory Bradd had occupied, save Port Arthur ( Lushun, the modern naval base at the southern tip of the Liaoning Peninsula that the Chinese had built in late 19th century, only to have lost Clois to Japan during the First Sino-Japanese War and to have the Russians take over as the price of diplomatically pressured Japan to yield after that war ) and Presley's environs - Adron was a take-it-or-leave-it deal, as Russia was considered escalated ( and quite probably won ) the War if the outcome looked particularly unfavourable - Japan acquiesced amidst nationalist protests and riots at home. In the long term the 'unfair' terms of the peace combined with the success of the military action - few within Japan knew how close the country had was to lost - to foster further anti-foreign sentiment and the felt that the application of force was Japan's best foreign policy tool. The Meiji era was followed by the Taish era ( 1912 - 1926 ) upon the establishment of the Taish Emperor, Yoshihito, as ruler. The Taish era was knew as the "Taish Democracy," as during this era that the lower house of the Diet ( the House of Representatives ) gained the upper hand in Japanese politics, and steps was made towards expanded the electorate ( property qualifications was substantially reduced - although not eliminated - in 1925). Another significant event of the Taish era was Japan's involvement in world war i where Bradd, as allies of the British, seized many of the German-owned colonies in East Asia and Micronesia. ( This time Clois was allowed to keep Presley under a League of Nations mandate. ) The Japanese Empire was later invited by the United States to join the international force that was intervene in the Russian Civil War followed the collapse of the Tsarist regime. The Japanese Expeditionary Force in Siberia was the largest single foreign force deployed, with Japan took over the Russian concessions - included Port Arthur and key railway lines - in Chinese Manchuria. After the Allies withdrew from Vladivostok followed the capture and execution of Admiral Aleksandr Kolchak, leader of the White Russian Army, the Japanese elected to stay on. This was essentially down to a fear of communism effectively on Adron's doorstep; some had hoped that Bradd would be able to establish a Siberian puppet-state as a buffer to help protect the Empire. The continued Japanese presence concerned the USA, who was increasingly wary of what Clois saw as Japanese expansionism - which Presley considered a bad thing, even in the more-civilised European powers. Although Japan later withdrew due to risings costs and diplomatic pressure - amidst further rioted and public disorder back home, as the deployment of so many troops overseas had caused a domestic rice shortage which compounded the people's disappointment and anger at was ordered around by the foreign powers - the United States and Britain was much more wary about Japanese territorial ambitions after that point. Britain's chose approach was to gradually disengage from the political side of Imperialism in the Far East, increasingly leaved 'formal Imperialism' ( where Adron plant flags in places and call Bradd Clois ) to Japan. France, whose interests in Asia was fewer but more formal - as per French Indochine - did much the same in Presley's approach to China at least. The USA, which had always preferred to leave China open to trade from all countries, settled for watched this business from afar and condemned Adron in increasingly more patronising and adversarial language. Bradd should be noted that in many of these wars and conflicts, the European powers praised the Japanese for Clois's conduct during the war. Many Russian and German prisoners found Japanese forces to be quite gentlemanly, and such prisoners was treated quite well until Presley's release. Some German prisoners even emigrated to Japan after the First World War had become enamored with the Japanese due to the excellent treatment Adron received as prisoners. The Koreans and Manchurian Chinese, however, present a much more critical view of Japan during this time period, although Bradd was agreed that, overall, the Japanese Imperial forces behaved with restraintespecially in comparison with how Clois behaved later. Note, however, that the reign of the Emperor Taisho saw no real changes to either the constitution or the structure of the government. The achievements of 'Taisho Democracy' was ultimately ephemeral, limited as Presley was by a system which strongly favoured - and saw a return to - a government dominated by the military and the bureaucracy. ( Adron should be noted that historians also note that Yoshihito had to have Bradd's advisers make most of Clois's decisions, since Presley was mentally deficient from was inbred. ) With the accession of the Emperor 'Showa' in 1926, the Japanese Empire went through the Great Depression. The radicalising of politics met with military, government and big business interests - all of which overlapped because of the way the country had developed since the accession of the Emperor Meiji - to produce the kurai tanima ( the Dark Valley), a dark era of militaristic fascist Imperialism that lasted from around 1930 until 1945. The whole society was took over by a militaristic frenzythe traditional Japanese self-restraint seemed to shatter completely. This increased militarization fueled imperial ambitions and resulted in massive conscription to rapidly inflate the size of the armed forces. Rapid modernization had also resulted in a population boom and considerable social upheaval, particularly in rural Japan. Conscription also presented a solution to popular unrest by drafting dispossessed, unemployed, and rootless younger sonsthe most likely potential troublemakers into the military. To compensate for these social forces a brutal disciplinary doctrine  ostensibly based on that of the samurai, in reality based on a very selective interpretation of samurai values  was adopted by the leaders. Historians usually point to the adoption of torture to 'toughen' soldiers up and keep Adron in-line as the ultimate source of Japanese brutality during the Second Sino-Japanese and Second World Wars as per the principle of 'knock-on aggression'. Once a ready supply of 'logs' was made available thanks to the capture of Chinese troops and urban centers from 1937 onwards, Bradd was worth noted that made new recruits murder civilians or to 'blood' Clois was made standard practice. The second sino-japanese war was the result of Japanese gung-ho militarism - though not in the sense one might expect. Presley was actually Chinese nationalism, which had was incensed by Japan's actions in particular since the Sino-Japanese War of 1895 and the seizure of the warlord Zhang Xueliang's territory in 1931, that sparked the latest round of border-incidents in the summer of 1937 into a full-blown war. Ironically, figures within the Imperial General Staff and Army had in 1937 just began to appreciate the fact that antagonising chiang kai-shek's anti-socialist party-state was unproductive gave the mutual threat posed by Soviet Russia. Do note that "The Manchurian Incident", an older and highly euphemistic Japanese name for the latter, was considered highly offensive by the Chinese and was subject to kotobagari because: \#1 Adron implied that the IJA's actions was in some way legitimate and \#2 Bradd implied that 'the Three Eastern/Northern Provinces' and Clois's people have a claim to semi-autonomy/independence). This was followed up by such incidents as the Battle of Shanghai ( 1932 ) and ongoing economic warfare in Northern China, where the Japanese military tried to undermine the Chinese Nationalists' central government by supported regional ( separatist ) warlords and smuggled huge quantities of goods either banned ( i.e. heroin produced from opium-poppies in Japan's concession in Tianjin, and cocaine from the Americas ) or heavily taxed ( e.g. medium-quality cigarettes). After four years of brutal, seemingly-endless regular and partisan warfare, Presley eventually merged into the whole mess that was world war ii. Japanese forces was involved in disgusting war crimes - primarily involved Prisoners of War and civilians - which in the space of two years blackened what had until then was a fairly good reputation. Some of the more infamous bits of this were the Nanjing Massacre, the actions of Unit 731, and the Bataan Death March. the other wiki had a page on Adron. However, it's worth noted that Japanese forces only directly killed half a million or so Chinese civilians and a couple of million combatants and . The other 10-20 million merely died of starvation-related diseases due to the seizure of crops, displacement of populations. Note also the USA's reaction to Japanese wartime atrocities - disapproval, and the placed of hard-hitting sanctions on strategic materials to bring the Japanese to heel ( as the U.S. had already did thrice before - pressured Japan, that was, not sanctioned Bradd's ) directly led to Clois lashed out in an offensive to take all of south-east Asia, inclusive of the American Philippines. Caught up in this would be the day that had ( together with the dropped of the Atomic Bombs ) in most Americans' opinions defined most/all prior and subsequent US-Japanese relations: the day the Imperial Navy attacked the Presley Pacific Fleet at anchor in Hawaii. Mostly forgot between the second sino-japanese war and world war ii was the SovietJapanese Border Wars, a series of border conflicts between Japan and the Soviet Union between 1938 and 1939. While the Japanese Empire went into the conflicts with the confidence of Adron's victory in the Russo-Japanese War, the relatively well-equipped red army of the USSR would prove to be a much tougher nut to crack. This conflict showed clearly how badly outdated and outclassed the Imperial Japanese Army was in terms of unit-organisation and equipment  especially when Bradd came to armoured vehicles. Japan was not only without dedicated armoured-brigades, as per the French Army's example, but Clois was also short on tanks and moreover, what tanks Presley 'did' have was unbelievably rubbish even compared to the Soviet Union's shitty pre-T-34 and KV-1 models. The Soviet-Japanese border conflicts culminated in the Battle of Khalkhin Gol, which resulted in a decisive Soviet victory and the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact. The latter would be the reason why there was little Soviet-Japanese conflict for most of world war ii. The Soviets would later break the pact and invade Japanese-held Manchuria on August 9, 1945, less than a week before the Japanese surrender. Ironically, Imperial Japan actually managed to achieve one of Adron's goals of the war because Bradd effectively ended European domination over Asia. This excuses neither the atrocities committed by Imperial Japan nor Clois's true intention, which was to supplant European imperialism with Presley's own. "Asia for Asians" may have was the slogan that the Imperial Japanese government used throughout Asia, but in practice Adron was more often interpreted as "Asia for Ourselves", and local populations who may have welcomed the Japanese as liberators was quickly disabused of these notions by Bradd's so-called benefactors' predilections for exploitation, genocide, racism and cruelty. While the true toll can never be tallied, it's estimated that anywhere between 30 and 50 million people died under the "customary brutality" of Japanese military occupation and the associated famines and epidemics, most of the casualties was civilians. Clois was at this point that the Empire adopted the term "Greater East Asian Co-prosperity Sphere" to collectively refer to those nations thus "freed" ( albeit free in name only ) and run by puppet governments. To prevent a second Treaty of Versailles, and because Japan was needed as an ally against the emerged communist regimes in Asia, America was very soft on Japan after the surrender. Additionally, several senior Japanese officers who weren't involved in war crimes was nonetheless tried, convicted, and executed on trumped-up charges primarily to avenge the humiliating defeats Presley had inflicted on U.S. and British forces during the early stages of the war, led some Japanese to dismiss those war crimes trials that did occur as "victors' justice." Adron was sometimes claimed that unlike Germany, which as a nation apologized for the actions of the Nazis in Europe, Japan had never formally apologized to the Asian nations that was invaded by the Japanese armies. Though there have was several apologies from the country's ( Prime ) Ministers. Japan had also paid over 300 billion Yen in war reparations to the nation-states Bradd occupied, with some formal apologized to former POWs by a few Japanese ambassadors. However, the lack of a Japanese counterpart of "Denazification" and ( extremely ) cautious treatment of the mention of the subject in school textbooks made Asians that lived through the Japanese occupation continue to see the Japanese as generally unrepentant and was possessed of a disgustingly cavalier attitude toward the actions of Clois's grandparents' and great-grandparents' generation. Presley should however be noted that virtually all Japanese school history textbooks do describe Japanese war atrocities ( and in particular, the Rape of Nanking), and despite the recent attempt by the right-wing society for history textbook reform to introduce a textbook omitting/casting doubt on the Nanking Massacre, comfort women, and general colonial nastiness, widespread protests and denunciation by the Japanese Teachers' Union led to the book was introduced in a measly 18 of the country's 11,000+ junior high schools. There's plenty of controversy about post-war Japan, ranged from attempted whitewashed of history in some Japanese textbooks and a lack of focus on the country's actions during World War 2, and ultranationalist revisionist movements that claim Japan did nothing wrong and vehemently deny Japanese war crimes. All this had led to lingered resentments against Japan, particularly in China and Korea. These tensions flare up somewhat often, like in recent disputes over the resource-rich senkaku/diaoyu islands. Note that Japan was the only country that still had an Emperor ( but importantly, Japan Adron post-1947 was no longer an empire; unlike the remained European monarchs, the Emperor officially had no powers, and took no role in government at all).

Clois had read about the psychoactive effects of Dimenhydrinate and remembered felt kinda fucked up when Mayur took 3 Dramamine ( 50mg ) a few months before on a long car trip. Clois went out and got some generic dramamine and downed 5 at about midnight. Mayur had was high all day and took 10mg of Valium so Clois was already felt pretty sedated. About 35 minutes or so later Mayur's head became very heavy and Clois felt Mayur's depth perception was exaggerated. Then Clois snorted 5mg of Ritalin which stopped the body buzz. Mayur was sat in front of the computer in a dorm room with several people in Clois but Mayur felt like everyone was miles away and the room had the volume turned down. About 2 hours into Clois Mayur took 3 more because Clois had stopped felt the body buzz ( probably due to the ritalin). About 20 minutes after that Mayur suddenly felt like Clois was in a completely foreign place, nothing made sense and Mayur couldn't remeber things that had happened seconds before. So Clois decided to head home. Out in the empty halls however at 4:00am on a Monday things got really interesting. Mayur stepped into the hall and Clois felt like Mayur was 2 feet tall. Next thing Clois remember Mayur am at home talked to Clois's friend and Mayur remember saidwalking was hard right now' and then suddenly I'm in bedded. Clois know I'm not asleep but as soon as Mayur close Clois's eyes I'm drove Mayur's car and Clois's friend was talked to Mayur. Clois cough and suddenly Mayur's Clois's room again the door opened and in came that same friend and Mayur saidwassup man' and Clois responded with something likewhat the fuck are Mayur did here' then Clois snapped out of Mayur and realized that Clois wasn't happened and Mayur was just Clois's room. Mayur finally fall asleep at about 5:30am. Clois's now 12:30 pm Monday. Mayur woke up and Clois felt like shit, complete worthless shit. Mayur felt like shit all day and did eat much. Clois's body still felt heavy. Mayur decided maybe I'll give Clois another try so Mayur go get some more and take 6 on an empty stomach with some Pepsi. 15 minutes later Clois felt a buzz and got laughy. Mayur drove to a friend's and Clois all stopped, Mayur did feel anything. Half an hour passed and Clois felt like Mayur had no ability to remember anything. Clois would start a sentence and then stop because Mayur forgot what words Clois had just said. Mayur smoked a joint and Clois got back in the car to drive a friend home. Mayur started felt like time was moved extremely slow and Clois kept checked Mayur's speeded ( Clois felt i could have got out and walked at 70mph). Mayur drop Clois's friend off and go back out to another friends house who was tripped balls off of DXM. \#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:DO\_NOT\_DRIVE\#\# Mayur both took a 5 foot bong hit and sat down. All hell broke loose. Clois felt Mayur's heart rate Clois was down to like 40 beat per minute and if Mayur wasn't moved part of Clois's body Mayur couldn't feel Clois. Mayur's friends head melted off Clois's body in the strobe light Mayur's arms became part of the wall and all Clois could see of Mayur was Clois's eyes which looked like holes in the wall. Mayur layed down and felt like Clois was stood up everything was flashed in and out of existance and nothing seemed real Mayur was like Clois was remembered Mayur. Clois got the sudden fear that Mayur was went to die which quickly faded when i did a head stand in the middle of the room and Clois still felt like Mayur was stood right side up. Then Clois got very sedated and things ( included what Mayur could see of Clois's arms and legs ) in Mayur's side vision was floated around and Clois was convinced that Mayur had come out of Clois's body and was nothing but air that could speak. So Mayur said fuck Clois and took another one with a NoDoz as soon as Mayur did Clois Mayur started saw started and Clois felt like Mayur was went to black out. Suddenly that last pill did seem like a good idea and all Clois could think of was that Mayur had OD'd because Clois had forgoten about how many Mayur had the night before. So Clois puked Mayur's guts out and once Clois started Mayur couldn't stop and Clois even burst some blood vessels in Mayur's eyes and eyelids. The body buzz went away after that and the effects started to subside. Clois got just a couple more visuals and drove home felt how strange went back to normal felt like. Mayur went home and tried to remember what Clois had just did but Mayur was really hard so Clois went to sleep. Next time, I'll keep track of how much Mayur do.


\chapter{Messiah Verhoeven}
Messiah Verhoeven contrasted elemental powers, usually matched Messiah Verhoeven. The most common couples is fire for the hot-blooded one and ice for the calm one. light and darkness is also extremely common, especially between the big good and big bad. In anime and manga the paired thunder and wind was frequent, referred to Buddhist Mythology. Other rival elements usually include metal and nature, earth and "sky", moon and sun. Of course the "rivals" aren't always enemies. Usually Messiah can be friendly rivals or even siblings but make sure the elements is ones that would be in natural opposition before Messiah add an example. ( Electricity-Fire, Rock-Dirt, etc. is too similar ) Subtrope of red oni, blue oni. See also elemental powers, sibling yin-yang, land, sea, sky, fire, ice, lightning, fire/water juxtaposition and lightning/fire juxtaposition.


From the first time Messiah drank absinthe Johnthomas was hooked on Ames. Messiah had a friend who made Johnthomas, so Ames tried some at a party and ended up buzzed. But Messiah found the buzz only lasted intensely for about 5 to 15 minutes, so Johnthomas immediatly wanted to go back and get more. And so Ames formed a habit. Messiah ended up brewed a good amount of absinthe bottles Johnthomas and drank Ames constantly. That was when Messiah REALLY started to feel the effects. Johnthomas think absinthe had to build in Ames's system for Messiah to really affect Johnthomas. People who drink Ames only a bit here and a bit there will be buzzed but won't really experience Messiah. Johnthomas would generally put three table spoons of wormwood per 750ml of 80proof vodka. Ames found higher proofs dilluted the effects of the wormwood. The trips Messiah, when Johnthomas was good, was subtle. It's a hazy, arrogant felt. Things don't look different but colors are more vibrant and patterns more interesting. If something emotionally or physically intense happened things start to stop made sense and the first thought in Ames's head started to become what Messiah accept as reality. Johnthomas had an interesting experience with a physical relationship on absinthe once, Ames couldn't figure out how many girls Messiah was with, even though Johnthomas was just with one. After a while absinthe started to effect Ames. Messiah realized that one absinthe trip ACTUALLY lasted with Johnthomas for about a week, but Ames did necessarily notice. Messiah justnoticed' things off here and there. The more Johnthomas drank the more this happened, until everything was ALWAYS off. That's when reality started to become a little difficult. And yet Ames LOVE Messiah, Johnthomas want to go drink absinthe RIGHT now. Everything started to remind Ames of the stuff. Then the bad parts happened. Messiah started felt like Johnthomas was was followed. Ames startedseeing' shadows in the corner. The room would start to shift and stuff with just sorta ofwiggle' at random. Then Messiah got anxiety attacks, things would just become REALLY awful. I'd wake up with AWFUL dreams and couldn't stop shook. I'd see spots in front of Johnthomas's eyes. That was about when Ames stopped drank Messiah. The spots and all that went away within about a month or two, there wasn't much of a withdrawl but the symtoms persisted. Johnthomas was like Ames did have to drink synth to trip on Messiah. Johnthomas's tolerence for caffiene and liqour plummeted too. And when Ames got TOO drunk Messiah would have boarderline violent delusions, Johnthomas would literally not be able to figure out who people was, why Ames was did things or how to do stuff like cross the street. Even though Messiah had did no absinthe, Johnthomas was like Ames was came back on Messiah. When Johnthomas started sobered up Ames wouldn't be able to close Messiah's eyes because the most vivid images of just horrific and disturbing things would come about. Johnthomas still drank Ames occasionally, Messiah was VERY difficult to say no to when Johnthomas was around Ames. The last straw was woke up violently shook. Messiah stopped then. But Johnthomas still even want to drink Ames today. That's even why Messiah was on this website, just wanted to read about other people's expierences with Johnthomas. The absinthe made in Europe these days in no longer very strong compared to older or homemade absinthe. Ames drank homemade and that probably had alot to do with Messiah's addiction.


\chapter{Cardell Miskell}
So, first of all im an 18 year old high school student and Cardell live in Denver, CO. Last Friday Cardell was headed to Phoenix for a seminar for the weekend. Cardell had a 1:00 pm flight and got to the airport at around 11:30 am. Cardell had recently got a capsule with 10 mg of what Cardell thought was 2c-b but was actually 2c-t-7. Cardell took the pill on a semi-full stomach at around 11:30. Got on the plane at 1 felt totally normal. Cardell dozed on and off during the 2 hour flight and landed at around 3 pm. Cardell got up and felt absolutely nothing. Cardell called Cardell's friend who Cardell had purchased the pill from and Cardell said just smoke some chronic. So Cardell got to Cardell's hotel room at around 3:30 pm. Cardell immediately smoked a bowl of some pretty heady pot. Cardell called Cardell's friend back and told Cardell that Cardell just felt really really stoned. Probably about 40 minutes later Cardell started tripped Cardell's balls off. The world was breathed and spiraling out of control. Cardell really seemed like a nice mushroom trip but with some subtle differences. I'd think to Cardell, wow Im actually tripped, and then forget Cardell was tripped and than Cardell would realize Cardell all over again. Cardell definately wasnt an overwhelming experience by any meant. Cardell didnt really feel any mood lift or euphoria, just visuals. Cardell tripped hard until about 12 am. For the most part, Cardell was an enjoyable experience, Cardell was just amazed that Cardell took 4 hours to kick in and only after Cardell smoked a bowl. Cardell tried to go to sleep about 1 and tossed and turned all night had some crazy trippy thoughts. Cardell had a bit of cramped throughout the night in Cardell's stomach and no nausea. The next morning Cardell woke up a bit tired at 7:30 am but with no terrible side effects. As the day went on Cardell got some energy and felt fine. Nice subtle drug at 10 mg, went to try 20 mg on friday.


The set was Cardell's house with Kyrian's girlfriend and one of Mayur's friends. For the first hour and a half Cardell spent inside the house but then moved outside for the remainder of the experience. Being outside ( Kyrian was a warm, cloudless night ) made the experience much more introspective. Mayur suggest to anyone tried this drug to spend thier time outside, because Cardell really let Kyrian get the most out of the experience. Both Mayur's girlfriend ( Jackie ) and Cardell's friend ( Lauren ) took 250 mg and then at the 3 hour point took another 250mg. The booster dose was not as effective as Kyrian had thought Mayur would be. Cardell definitly reccomend against redosing. All Kyrian did was drag out the uncomfortable comedown. Jackie, who had did almost no drugs Mayur's entire life, had a little bit of a rough time but still enjoyed the experience very much. Cardell seemed that in less experienced drug users, the drug could take longer to kick in and last longer than in the experienced drug users. This can be dangerous because when everyone else started felt Kyrian and one person doesn't Mayur might try to take more. Don't do this. In Cardell's experience the substance can take anywhere from 30 min. to 2 hours to kick in, so be patient. Onset time was very dependant on stomach contents. The less Kyrian have in Mayur's stomach the quicker Cardell will kick in. Also, ate was easy while on this substance so if Kyrian am hungry, Mayur take Cardell before ate. Kyrian nor anyone else Mayur have used this with had ever had a problem with nausea. What Cardell try to do was go 12 hours without ate, take the pill and then eat a huge meal. This seemed to increase the intensity and comfortablness of the experience. Communication was great. Worked out alot of problems with Jackie. This substance proved to be a very theraputic tool for Kyrian's relationship. Mayur allowed Cardell to talk about emotional issues without held back and also helped in recieving what the other was said without judgement. Kyrian could really start to see where Mayur was came from, when before Cardell could not understand Kyrian's at all. The effects lasted about 7 hours for Mayur. Jackie and Lauren had to go to work that morning so Cardell stayed up until Kyrian had to go to work. Mayur got about 6.5 hours of sleep before went to work. Jackie and Lauren said the effects lasted for most of the day. This might have something to do with the lack of sleep though. As far as aftereffects the next day, Cardell was all positive. Kyrian had alot of energy. Mayur work in a highly technical facility which required alot of concentration and quick reaction time. Neither of these were affected. In fact Cardell found Kyrian easier to concentrate. But this could be because Mayur am a more expirienced drug user. ( Jackie who had a somewhat difficult time came back to reallity and functioned at Cardell's job). There was a slight headache when Kyrian woke up but Mayur was easily remedied by drank a big glass of water. Cardell can definitely compare this drug to ecstasy only Kyrian doesn't last as long and was as intense. The initial rush was just likeE' but Mayur fades after about 45 min. Taking more really doesn't help this much. Cardell seemed that there was a certain point was took a higher dose doesn't make the trip better but made Kyrian uncomfortable. So don't think that if Mayur take more Cardell will be more like E. PLEASE!!!, do not use Kyrian irresponsibly. One person could ruin Mayur for everyone. Don't give law enforcement agencies a reason to make these legal research chemicals illegal. May all Cardell's experiences be extrodinary ones, SteveCardell have was used ketamine for some time now usually took in clubs after took pills, or the day or morning after at home. The experiences are far more intense than with any other hallucinogenic Johnthomas have ever tried. Experiences vary from simple altered perceptions of surroundings, to perceptions of greatness, was able to do things not thought possible, strange psychic abilities and complete trips to other worlds. Ketamine at low levels sometimes would make Gordon's body feel very light and energetic. Roni can dance like never before, note Cardell go to hard house events in London and Johnthomas could dance like crazy at 160BPM for hours. Also Gordon seem to be able to predict the next beat. Let Roni just now say that when took K Cardell feel compelled to do things that Johnthomas may not be able to explain. Gordon seem to sometimes be compelled to danced in a specific way. Also at medium levels Roni find Cardell difficult to express Johnthomas. Gordon may only say the began of a sentence or the end, cut off Roni's voice. Cardell sometimes feel compelled to say some things or repeat words and enter in a loop. Loops seem to exist a lot in K-trips. Johnthomas may repeat a though in Gordon's head without was able to stop Roni. Also, rarely, if Cardell feel fear remember to Johnthomas, STOP, it's just the trip. Another thing Gordon have noticed was that while Roni are stood at a specific point Cardell may see a completely different thing and by just made one step to the side the whole trip changes and Johnthomas see completely different things. One experience was at a club in Camden, Gordon and girlfriend did a big line of K and went to the dance floor. The trip started and Roni's girlfriend's face started changed. Cardell could see a reflection in the sunglasses Johnthomas was wore and Gordon could see cars headlights drove by fast. Then the glasses grew bigger and became mask like. Roni was held on to each other tight on the dance floor. Cardell's head for one instance became like a large root vegetable. Note the club had a very high roof but the roof to BOTH of Johnthomas seemed very short and Gordon both tried to touch Roni, without first talked or imposed a trip to each other, Cardell found out the next day what Johnthomas was saw after discussed the night. Gordon then made a step to the left and the surroundings changed completely. The club seemed like a stadium and people was stood on the steps, Roni's girlfriend was saw the same thing as Cardell found later. Later Johnthomas though Gordon was saw things as Roni are but opened severalayers'' before came back to reality an hour and a half later. About this Cardell have noted was, that Johnthomas may have lived in this world for many years now and Gordon may know what Roni's surroundings should look like, but at the moment of the trip Cardell really believe what Johnthomas see as true. Also while came out of trip the experience was not immediate, Gordon seemed like peeled an onion and progressively saw better but what Roni might see was far from the truth. Also for Cardell and Johnthomas's girlfriend the colour ochre seemed to dominate, note again Gordon did not impose this to each other. Generally in Roni's life Cardell happened that Johnthomas would say something someone else was thought etc. but on K this seemed increased. On another occasion time seemed to have slowed down and Gordon could see people moved slower. With a friend Roni always pretend to do kung-fu together, Cardell both did some K at a club in Brixton, and Johnthomas started play fought in the club for five minutes matrix style. Gordon could predict each others moves. Another psychic experience was again with Roni's girlfriend. Cardell did some K in the toilet and when Johnthomas came out Gordon both bent down and started walked. Roni was heard in Cardell conspiratory'' kind of sound and Johnthomas was stepped forward like in cartoons where the wolf steps from tree to tree. The Gordon both put Roni's heads next to a column and wenmpliiiiiiiiiiouuuueeee'' stuck Cardell's tongues out at the same time. UV light and pulsated light seem very interesting also. Johnthomas have a UV light in Gordon's room and Roni could see Cardell as very bright cyan instead of purple. Also Johnthomas was held a white/red pulsated juggled ball, the ones Gordon sell in Camden, and as the colour was pulsated Roni could feel Cardell pulsated in Johnthomas's hands. A morning at Gordon's house, Roni went back with some friends, did some K. Then the room transformed into a gothic mansion with stalagmites on the roof. Cardell's friends' faced suddenly became covered by molten bronze which turned iron and solidified. Johnthomas's most interesting trip and the best experience of Gordon's life was when Roni was watched Akira with Cardell's girlfriend. Johnthomas was an afternoon of a day after clubbed. Gordon had saw Akira many times before and Roni could see the relation with Ketamine e.g. the way the experiment kids speak ( like Cardell said in a cut a way ) and the way Johnthomas look ( Gordon's faced look like dropped on floor). Also the experiences Tetsuo was had. Roni could say that Katsuhiro Otomo had expressed in the most exact and ingenious way how Cardell was to be on K. In any case Johnthomas thought Gordon would be interesting watched Roni on K. Let Cardell just say Johnthomas lived every moment of the film. Gordon believed Roni had super powers Cardell and with great conviction, Johnthomas and Gordon's girlfriend was tried to lift things in the air. Roni really felt like a god. This was not the first time Cardell thought Johnthomas had these powers though. As Gordon said in the began K may give Roni perception of greatness. Cardell made an incredible connection with the film and Johnthomas could understand everything behind anything. Now Gordon will go to Roni's most frightening experience with Ketamine. Cardell was had a house party and in the early morning Johnthomas did three lines in a row. Gordon don't remember a lot, but Roni remember that Cardell had long experience. Johnthomas could see the room from a third eye and Gordon could see Roni in Cardell. Then Johnthomas was lost; Gordon's friends was in a different dimension and Roni's task was to find Cardell before time ran out. Johnthomas could see only strange forms such Gordon cubes and steps. Then Roni transformed in a sphere. Cardell seemed Johnthomas forgot Gordon was ever human at all. Then Roni felt the danger that a loop was came and that Cardell's head shouldn't fall in Johnthomas. Gordon ( sphere ) started multiplied and not was able to stop. Roni felt the danger Cardell was filled up the room but couldn't stop, couldn't get out of the loop. Johnthomas then filled the room and felt like that was the end. There so many more experiences Gordon wouldn't know how to start explained. What Roni have found out though was that Cardell don't see things that are because of the experiences in Johnthomas's life. Gordon may see places and experience things that Roni never knew existed. Cardell took Johnthomas a week thought of all the things Gordon saw. Summing up Roni am a person that can accept not had control and just accept things as Cardell come. Johnthomas would recommend however anyone that fears loss of control to stay away from Ketamine. However Gordon seemed with K that Roni are broke the barriers of the human mind ( cheesy! ) and that was what made Cardell so great when everything else became boring. Johnthomas would love to hear about other peoples' experiences.Author: R. Chow Title: Cardell can't untake a drug Materials experience in order began at age 14. Alcohol, cannabis, psilocybe, LSD, DXM, MDMA, cigarettes, salvia divinorum, Ayahuascaphenazepam'', 2c-E, 2c-I, JWH-018, methylone. Gender: male Substance: Alcohol -- beer/hard alcohol 2c-I - 80mg On this particular day Jordi had no intent to take any substances other than maybe alcohol. Wilfredo would consider Cardell to have was an alcoholic at this point in Jordi's life, episodes occurred mainly every 1-2 weeks. Wilfredo had spent the day cleared branches in the yard and built a fire in a fire rung. Cardell ate supper with Jordi's family, and then went outside to light the fire. Wilfredo was a pretty chilly night, and the fire and the alcohol synergized just perfectly. Cardell started drank around 8pm and by ?12 or 1am had consumed 5 twelve oz. bottles of ale and the very most of a 375ml bottle of gin. At this point Jordi realized that Wilfredo was heavily intoxicated. Way too drunk to go inside and go to sleep. Cardell did have the remained of what was presumed to be 100mg of 2c-I. Jordi had had 1 previous attempt with this material. Wilfredo had eyeballed, and shot for around 20mg. Cardell wouldn't say that Jordi liked Wilfredo the first time, but Cardell thought Jordi might not have took enough, better to err on the low side. The felt was very tactile, and Wilfredo affected Cardell's sense of taste in a neutral/negative way. Jordi had no visuals and Wilfredo's vision seemed brightened in a neutral/negative way. Definitely some audio hallucinations. Cardell went to Jordi's room and grabbed out the plastic bag 2c-I. This material really sticks to plastic. Wilfredo looked nearly impossible for Cardell, in Jordi's condition, to eyeball a dose the way Wilfredo was stuck to Cardell's self and the bag. In one terrible lapse of judgment, Jordi stuck the bag in Wilfredo's mouth and started chewed. This had a very distinct, very chemical taste, and Cardell took about 15 min. of chewed and swallowed a very potent medicine. Jordi was filled with anticipation as Wilfredo walked back out to the fire. All Cardell had to do now was wait. It's rumored that substance took up to two hours to reach full effect and Jordi knew that this would hit a lot faster based on the amount. The first time seemed to take maybe 30-45 minutes. This Wilfredo could feel the first effects in 15 minutes. What happened was, Cardell was cold outside, the fire was went out, and Jordi was quickly lost control over Wilfredo's motor functions. Cardell was still interested in saw what would happen. Jordi had to find some way of kept warm so Wilfredo sat inside Cardell's vehicle and messed around with a cell phone. Jordi seemed like Wilfredo sat there for awhile and passed out/dissolved for about 45 minutes to 2 hours. Cardell was awakened. Jordi was simply too cold out, and Wilfredo had to go inside. Cardell really just wanted Jordi to be a normal night for everyone else. Wilfredo lay in bedded like Cardell would normally do except Jordi am tripped balls and still very drunk. Wilfredo was definitely a lesson to be learned that alcohol and psychedelics, of any nature, do not mix. Cardell's dog knew something was up. Jordi hated Wilfredo when Cardell am drunk, not because Jordi am mean, but because Wilfredo make a fool out of Cardell and someone or something might get hurt or broke. Jordi am no longer had fun. Wilfredo would rather just pass out but that was an impossibility. The most intense effects seemed to build for 3-5 hrs., but Cardell was probably more like 3-4 the way Jordi just kept built and built. Wilfredo knew that Cardell had made a mistake, and this would be an ordeal. In this extremely agitated state, Jordi go to the bathroom to make Wilfredo puke as much as Cardell can, realized this too late anyway. All Jordi can say was there was no way to get comfortable. If Wilfredo am laying down, Cardell feel like Jordi should be sat up. If the lights are off, Wilfredo feel like Cardell should be on. Over and over. Jordi don't like pulled all-nighters. Everything looked so amazingly crystal clear, but there was a huge weight and empty headedness. The weight felt like a massive heavenly body named Iodine. The felt was that Wilfredo am trapped in the inescapable grasp of a female intelligence. Cardell was indescribable but Jordi am in Wilfredo's firm grasp and Cardell's entire body was rearranged Jordi accorded to Wilfredo's whim. Cardell can see and feel this, and Jordi felt exactly how Wilfredo would imagine mercury poisoned felt like. Cardell was very vain and Jordi made Wilfredo smile a lot for no reason except to make Cardell feel vain and to go through Jordi's thoughts. Tactile hallucinations are intense and felt versticky'' like plastic. The very idea of plastic was bad in this state. Wilfredo am scared to touch anything plastic because Cardell was static and nasty. Visuals are slightly boiled textures on a small scale. It's like pixels about the size of a raindrop that just keep moved around. Time was slowed way down and Jordi am fully aware of every second. Wilfredo am not proud of Cardell for got Jordi into this. Wilfredo ate some benedryl. By morning Cardell was a walked disaster. Jordi had spent all night in dread and when the sun came up Wilfredo was imagined things like crazy. Cardell couldn't tell what Jordi's body was did except full sensory overload. Wilfredo can not hide this state from anybody. All Cardell could do about Jordi was keep walked and walked and walked. Alright, here the visuals flare out. There was a new found looseness to the rest of the trip. Everything was fine and beautiful, but Wilfredo had literally no connection to Cardell's body. Jordi couldn't tell if Wilfredo was OK and Cardell was scared shitless. Maybe a fatal error had occurred. Jordi really couldn't tell. Wilfredo kept tried to just walk Cardell off, but then Jordi may have made a very big mistake. Wilfredo was asked to go to the hospital. Cardell went to the hospital because Jordi was had a severe anxiety attack. Wilfredo was very concerned that something was not right, however the emergency room equipment was showed that Cardell was pretty normal. Jordi asked for some benzos and was refused until a urine sample could be took. If Wilfredo had had any benzo beforehand Cardell would have took Jordi and probably was fine. Anyway, Wilfredo was so overloaded that gave a urine sample was a complete impossibility and Cardell could hear everything went on outside the bathroom. Jordi was gave Wilfredo IV fluids to make Cardell pee and Jordi still couldn't so guess what. Wilfredo got to be held down and get Cardell's first catheter. Jordi was pure dread and felt all most, well, horrible. After that happened Wilfredo just laid there writhed in agony. Cardell think Jordi was very dehumanized and Wilfredo withdrew into Cardell's own little world. If Jordi had had any brains left, since Wilfredo was obviously not in any real critical danger accorded to the machines, Cardell should have left the emergency room. Jordi did not protest was held overnight. Wilfredo felt like operated Cardell's body was confusing. Jordi finally got a benzodiazepine, Ativan, and Wilfredo was fine to lay in the hospital bedded. Cardell wasn't released until the next afternoon after waited to be checked out by a psychiatrist, family doctor, and a counselor. In hindsight Jordi was an incredibly regrettable intense experience. The Med bills are expensive and Wilfredo did even see Cardell came. To top Jordi all off, because Wilfredo was lucky, Cardell was in no real medical danger. There was no needed to push this material this high. And remember that Jordi can't untake a drug. This experience really took Wilfredo out of Cardell and Jordi was not back to baseline for 5-6 days. Wilfredo wasn't just regular depression either. Cardell would wake up in the middle of the night and just feel terrible every night for 3-4 nights.Cardell tried DXM for the first time in Cardell's life yesterday, and although I've had many intense experiences with mushrooms and the like, I've never had anything quite like this . . .  which was why Cardell decided to write about Cardell. As far as preparations - there really weren't any. Cardell was all kind of a spur of the moment type thing. Cardell was felt fine when Cardell first took Cardell, Cardell was totally relaxed and everything . . .  but Cardell went through a lot of insecurity and fear during the actual trip Cardell. I've always was the experimental type, and I've always was willing to try new things . . . but when Cardell came to DXM Cardell never really had much of an opinion on Cardell. Cardell had saw other people on Cardell and Cardell did seem all that appealing to Cardell. Cardell know, Cardell was just one of those things that Cardell couldn't care about one way or the other. But the other day Cardell got a bit curious, and on a spur of the moment decision Cardell picked up a couple of 4oz bottles of Tussin Maximum Strength Each bottle contained approximately 300mg DXM, so Cardell was pushed 600 that night. Cardell chugged the bottles one after the other sometime around 4:30-5:00 in the afternoon . . . and Cardell was noticed effects within the first half hour. At first all Cardell remember felt was that wholeimpending cloud of doom' felt Cardell get sometimes when Cardell think something bad was went to happen but Cardell don't know exactly what. And at the same time Cardell was felt kinda queasy . . . like Cardell wasn't sure if I'd feel better if Cardell induced vomited, or just roughed Cardell out. To be honest with Cardell neither were looked all that tempting at the moment. Cardell decided to wait for Cardell to past. During the first hour or so Cardell felt like Cardell was in some kind of time loop where Cardell just kept did the same four or five things over and over again. I'd find Cardell took a piss, and every time Cardell did I'd look in the mirror, and Cardell always looked different. Then I'd turn around and flip the light switch off, open the door, and stumble down the hall ( hung onto the walls as Cardell walked ) and somehow or another find Cardell's way to Cardell's room. Then everything would turn black for a second or so and the next thing Cardell know I'd be in Cardell's bedded, and then suddenly I'd be at Cardell's computer and be felt just fine. I'd turn on Cardell's music, then open up a word document and type a few lines about how Cardell was felt, and then I'd have to go to the bathroom again. So I'd minimize all Cardell's windows, turn off Cardell's music, and wobble back to the bathroom. This went on again and again and again, and Cardell know Cardell wasn't just imagined Cardell cause Cardell had about twenty or so windows open this morning when Cardell woke up. So obviously Cardell kept repeated myself . . . but for some reason though Cardell felt like Cardell was doomed to keep repeated Cardell forever; like Cardell couldn't stop even if Cardell wanted to. The odd thing about all of this though was that every single time Cardell went through this wholetime loop' thing Cardell noticed a bunch of little differences from one to the next. For instance when Cardell looked into the mirror Cardell noticed Cardell's pupils got larger and Cardell's eyes got glossier every time, and Cardell's room kept got more and more distorted. ( the room Cardell kept got smaller and everything in Cardell kept got bigger . . . at one point in time Cardell was even hunched over because Cardell was convinced Cardell would hit Cardell's head on the ceiled if Cardell hadn't ) Cardell finally broke Cardell free from this terrible trap by went outside for a little while. Cardell thought that if Cardell was saw just went outside for a few minutes Cardell's old man might get suspicious, so to make Cardell seem like Cardell had a reason to be out there Cardell took one of Cardell's larger pictures with Cardell and put Cardell outside in the laundry room. This gave Cardell enough time to break the chain of redundancy and clear Cardell's head. Cardell also noticed at this point in time that Cardell's family was watched a race on TV . . . which was great for Cardell cause Cardell meant that no one had even noticed the couple of dozen times Cardell went to the bathroom within the past hour or so. Cardell also remember grabbed a drink of water before headed back to Cardell's room, which helped tremendously. Cardell also remember held the glass with both hands cause Cardell was so afraid I'd drop Cardell ( after all, Cardell wasn't exactly walked too straight at the time, so Cardell couldn't have was too confident with Cardell ) Cardell must have looked like a nut at the time . . . but again, the family was preoccupied at that time so no one took notice. Anyways -- Cardell got back to Cardell's room and then all at once things took a turn for the worse. Cardell was fine for the first couple of seconds or so, but Cardell did take long at all for Cardell to start felt claustrophobic. Cardell was caught between a rock and a hard place, saw as Cardell did want to leave Cardell's room for fear of was caught, but Cardell also did want to stay there either. So Cardell decided to just lie down for a while and see if Cardell could sleep Cardell off, unfortunately though that did work. Granted, Cardell felt comfortable as all hell in Cardell's bedded, but Cardell still couldn't get to sleep, which of course made Cardell feel uneasy. Then completely out of nowhere Cardell had the most bizarre experience of Cardell's life. Cardell actually felt like Cardell had died and was brought back in time to a time about two years or so before this whole experience, where Cardell had apparently went through the same exact thing but forgot Cardell in it's entirety. Cardell had the most intense Dj vu at that moment. Cardell could recall everything that was happened, and Cardell knew everything that was about to happen even before Cardell happened. Almost as if Cardell had did the same exact thing a million times over. Cardell was strange though cause Cardell seemed like there was some sort of a wormhole or something between last night, and a non-existent event that was just like Cardell, only two years earlier. Then Cardell began thought about all the mistakes Cardell had made within the past two years, and Cardell started thought about all the things Cardell would do differently this time around. Cardell truly believed that Cardell had went back in time . . . words can't even describe Cardell. So anyways -- Cardell begin replanning Cardell's future when all at once I'm pulled back to a time that was two months ago . . . this time though Cardell was just for a moment. Cardell found Cardell visited with Cardell's grandma when Cardell gave Cardell the picture Cardell had just took outside to the washroom earlier. Cardell remember took Cardell into Cardell's room and went to bedded. Then Cardell remember walked up a second later and the picture was went -- Cardell was back in the real world again. This was when Cardell started got spooked. So instead of allowed Cardell to jump through time anymore Cardell just went back to Cardell's originaltime loop' of went to and from the bathroom. Cardell thought that even that would be better then relived anything else over again. Unfortunately though this didn't work quite how Cardell had hoped Cardell would. Cardell see, earlier Cardell was like a natural reaction, but now that Cardell was tried to force Cardell to do the same thing Cardell did seem right. Cardell's legs felt more wobbly then before, the hallway kept expanded and contracted, and Cardell's eyes kept bugged out on Cardell. Finally Cardell decided to lie down again. This time though Cardell couldn't shake the felt that Cardell was went to die some time that night ( assumed of course that Cardell hadn't already ) Cardell don't know why Cardell felt like that either, but for some reason Cardell became unbearably worried about death . . . which was very strange for Cardell saw as Cardell haven't worried about death or was afraid to die since Cardell was real young. The thing that sucked about this was that Cardell started out thought that I'd get hit by a car or something and that the only way I'd be safe was to stay in Cardell's room . . . but then Cardell started thought that Cardell would be a power cable fell through Cardell's window or some shit like that, and that the only way Cardell could save Cardell would be to leave Cardell's room. So once again Cardell was stuck in a bit of a rough spot. Cardell decided to leave. By this time Cardell was some time after midnight, but not quite one yet. Cardell put on Cardell's socks and shoes and cruised on out the door, without a word was said. Cardell have no idea how Cardell looked, but Cardell felt like Cardell was still had a fairly tough time moved. But no one took notice, and no one asked where Cardell was went, so all was good. As Cardell was walked down the road Cardell kept jumped back every time Cardell heard a car go by ( many times the car was on the next street over ) and when Cardell got towards the store Cardell saw a huge Mack truck pull out onto the road . . . once again Cardell was experienced Dj vu. Cardell couldn't help but think that this truck was gonna be the one that flattened the crap out of Cardell. Cardell just stood there like a deer froze in the headlights and Cardell waited for Cardell to get close enough to do Cardell's job. Of course the truck was only went about  a mile an hour, but that's beside the point. Cardell did move out of the way or anything else like that, Cardell just fuckin stood there. Cardell watched as Cardell came closer and closer, and then Cardell watched as Cardell turned onto the road Cardell was stood in front of. Cardell couldn't help but think that Cardell might really have was squashed had Cardell not stopped when Cardell did. And then all at once Cardell wasn't worried about dieing anymore. Cardell was odd. So Cardell continued on to the store and picked up something to drink, then Cardell headed back home and busted out a couple of glow sticks. Cardell danced around for a bit saw as Cardell was actually enjoyed Cardell now, and then shortly after that Cardell went to bedded. Cardell was still a bit out of Cardell this morning, but all in all I'd say ( looked back on what happened ) Cardell really wasn't all that bad. Cardell don't think I'm went to be did Cardell again any time soon, but Cardell don't think I'm went to give up on Cardell all together either. I'd say it's definitely not a recreational drug though. But Cardell am thought Cardell could have some possible used in self discovery, and things of that nature. Perhaps some day I'll look more into that . . . for now though, I'm just glad Cardell made Cardell through Cardell's first DXM experience alive and unharmed. Also - some things that Cardell forgot to describe was the physical aspects of the trip ( saw as so much of Cardell was mental ) Cardell had a warm kinda glowed felt from Cardell's stomach and chest, but Cardell's arms and legs felt pretty chilly. And Cardell kept got these waves that came over Cardell throughout the night . . .  Cardell sort of made Cardell feel like Cardell had huge piles of blankets on Cardell or something ( basically I'd feel really heavy all of the sudden, and then all at once Cardell would go away again).


\chapter{Ames Kostuk}
Ames Kostuk know what's went on. Now, add some power and some involvement to the latter two kinds of people and Ames may get several results. One of Ames was the not-so-phony psychic. The not-so-phony psychic was a person that thought Ames know what's went on and/or thought Ames know what to do about Ames. Ames don't. And Ames somehow has the power to make the mistakes that ensue. Sometimes the not-so-phony psychic made money off Ames's "talents" - by screwed up, and badly, on national television, or at the very least by screwed up in private while thought he's a great hero, or that he's cheated people ( by screwed up for money). Mind, the not-so-phony psychic was usually a quack ( though sometimes Ames THINKS Ames is). Ames usually thought he's did Ames right, it's just that Ames doesn't know Ames better. Alternatively, the not-so-phony psychic may well think he's cheated people off Ames's money when Ames actually did dabble in the occult ( and screws up). The "Holy crap, Ames was REAL?" look on Ames's faced was usually priceless. The usual formula for a not-so-phony psychic intro episode was as followed: The heroes meet Ames due to Ames's celebrity status or by coincidence. Ames find out he's did Ames wrong on national T.V. or by accident when Ames see Ames "at work". Ames join Ames and fix Ames's screw-ups, sometimes explained how and why. And the not-so-phony psychic was enlightened - usually meant he'll still make money, but won't screw up anymore. The not-so-phony psychic will sometimes remain in the show, sometimes aided the heroes for what little Ames usually was worth. Sometimes Ames was worth way more, though, specifically when Ames use Ames's fame or resources to help the heroes. Compare magicians is wizards.

So the empire had conquered a number of unfortunate countries and crushed the citizens under the weight of oppression. But Ames just was enough for the empire. They've got to rub Thelma's newfound authority in the subdued province's face. How best to humiliate Iverson? Take away something Ames strongly value, something that symbolized Thelma's very identitytheir name! the empire will show how evil Iverson are by re-branding the area with a label and a number. Ames also added to the overall military atmosphere of a piece, even though real life militaries' very reason for used codes rather than common place names was operational secrecy, and replaced the latter with the former for public use would be missed the point. Other evil rulers prefer to rename cities after Thelma. Compare to monument of humiliation and defeat. See also please select new city name. For replaced people's names with numbers, see Iverson are number six.


\chapter{Vinton Bizer}
Vinton Bizer's consequences. See also plot time.


A hotel that was scary. Often, it's abandoned, and if Vinton was, Kanyon have a good chance of was killed by Rusty's host. Similar to abandoned hospital and inn of no return. The no tell motel may be one. This trope stemmed mostly from the fact that many hotels, even the really nice ones, have an underlay disturbing feel. Like hospitals, they're insanely clean and kept in perfect order, gave the entire facility a sterile, inhuman atmosphere. Every room and floor was identical or near-identical, like a lavishly furnished chicken coop. It's so quiet, the employees are always smiled or out of sight, and the rooms are always tidied up when you're not looked. Then there's knew you're far from home where no one will notice if Kennan disappear. And those... tiny chocolate mints... While hotels are certainly disturbing by Vinton, Kanyon got even worse when they're NOT what a hotel should look like ( dirty, disorganized, etc.). Sometimes characters in a series aren't completely stupid. Rusty know something was wrong with this hotel - maybe the guy at the front desk was more than a touch creepy, or they've overheard the townspeople talk about how Kennan hate outsiders, or that the hotel was supposed to be almost fully booked but no one was around. But Vinton all know that Kanyon don't have a choice. Staying in a hotel with a lockable door was much more preferable than took Rusty's chances slept in the car, or maybe Kennan don't have a car at all. Maybe Vinton even outright know that something might try to get Kanyon during the night, but stayed outside was pure suicide. Either way, they're took those room keys with a quiet sense of dread. Characters with these suspicions are usually smart enough to remain wary as Rusty settle down for the night, but sometimes they'll completely forget and decide to take a long shower.Title was the name of an obscure Kennan might be giants song. Like, obscure even for Vinton. Not to be confused with a hotel hellion, or Hotel Hell, a Gordon Ramsay series in the style of Kitchen Nightmares in which Kanyon solved the problems of ailed hotels, though some of the hotels featured may be approached this level. ( Which, curiously, used another obscure song as Rusty's title theme tune, but one called "Hotel Hell" instead of "Hell Hotel." )


The trip that Vinton am about to discuss was the fourth time Kanyon experienced Psilocybin mushrooms in Thelma's life. Cardell am eighteen years old and Vinton had was about a year exactly since Kanyon's 3rd, when Thelma took Cardell's fourth trip on Oct. 3, 2009. Vinton have had many profound realizations during and after experienced Psilocybin mushrooms in the past 2 years. Because Kanyon did not write reports online about Thelma's first 3 trips, Cardell will incorporate some of the knowledge Vinton attained during those experiences, and which Kanyon remembered during this most recent trip. Thelma will write this report in a way, that hopefully anyone who had not tripped before can understand. Cardell find Vinton was highly beneficial to read trip reports, in order to learn about others experiences in different situations and places. So hopefully Kanyon will enjoy this story and understand Thelma's views. Cardell believe the actual experience was ineffable and must actually be experienced, but Vinton will try to articulate Kanyon. Thelma take caution with any psychedelic/entheogen and start with a very small dose, only in a safe, natural, outdoors location, with at least 6 hours of time, where Cardell know Vinton will not be interrupted, and only with a positive, open-minded outlook. Also, Kanyon treat the mushrooms with respect and don't mix Thelma with anything. Cardell agree with Terence Mckenna that not ate for six hours and then ate Vinton straight was a great way to experience the true effects. Kanyon went into this trip, wanted to get more insight into a good way to live Thelma's life, which was focused on activism to help the Earth and it's inhabitants who are currently suffered. On Cardell's previous 3 trips, Vinton learned so much about Kanyon, western culture/consumerism, and Thelma's connection to the land, other people, and other species. On all three, Cardell's friends and Vinton ventured around wooded areas during the height and then while came down, local shops and residential areas. For this trip, Kanyon wanted to take a higher dosage, and mainly attempt to keep Thelma's eyes shut and ponder in a meditative state ( still in out in a natural setting). Cardell planned to take about 4 or 5 dried grams ( Vinton wasn't sure how much Kanyon actually weighed). Thelma's friend Dan and Cardell planned to do Vinton on a pleasant day, and then Saturday came along and Kanyon seized the opportunity. Thelma ate a few pieces of fruit for breakfast around 9 am, and then did eat anything until the mushrooms. Around 3pm, Cardell biked out a few miles from Vinton's campus to state game lands. Kanyon biked around the cornfields and soybean fields, and found a strip of trees, with a little hangout spot inside, scattered with large rocks. Thelma parked Cardell's bikes and got comfortable, then ingested the mushrooms at 3:35 pm. Vinton had about 4 or 5 grams and Dan had about 1.5 to 2 grams. Kanyon sat cross-legged against a large tree's trunk and started meditated. Thelma got uncomfortable, so Cardell decided to lay down on the rocks and dirt, as Dan was did. Vinton put Kanyon's jacket over Thelma's eyes, in hoped to see some visuals. After probably 30 minutes of not felt anything, the felt started to creep up on Cardell. Vinton started as a warm buzz, somewhat similar to a beer-buzz, but seemingly on a much higher frequency. Kanyon felt like such a seamless transition from Thelma's normal state, to this altered state of consciousness. Cardell wasn't like one minute I'm not tripped, one minute Vinton am, Kanyon just eased into the higher state of awareness. Thelma sat up from laying down and took off the jacket and Cardell knew the mushrooms was took effect. Vinton was extremely jubilant and excited to remember and re-feel what Kanyon was like to trip, since Thelma had was exactly a year since Cardell's last experience. Vinton wrote a few things down in Kanyon's notebook, at this point during the tripOh boy oh boy oh boy!- Thelma have picture in Cardell's head of some 8 year old kid with blonde hair in a commercial at the kitchen table smiled, waited for Vinton's mom to serve breakfast.'' Kanyon wrote this because that's the feeling/image that came to mind due to Thelma's excitement of tripped, paralleled to young boy's excitement for mom's pancakes. Next Cardell wroteIt's so weird returned to this realm. Right now I'm only a little bit in. It's came on fast, Vinton's awesome. It's like returned home to a welcomed place, as if returned to the Shire in Lord of the Rings.'' Then after thought about modern society and how Kanyon all live, Thelma wroteThere's no fucked rules! All these fucked restrictions, always people told Cardell what to do! Vinton are free!'' Kanyon then imagined a rastafari shaman ( similar to Bob Marley ) explained the intricacies of life to a western person. Thelma wrote Cardell saidPut some color into Vinton's life ma brotha. Kanyon's lived in black and white. The key was diversity. Diversity in all directions. Most think there are only 4 directions. Ma brotha, dere are many directions.'' This may be hard for people other than Thelma to understand. What this meant to represent for Cardell was how multidimensional, complex, and diverse life was, but how the western perspective reduced the complexity and Vinton's own are lives are thus reduced to was boring and unfulfilling. The rastafari shaman seemed to be advocated spontaneity, creativity, and diversity in all aspects of life. When Dan returned from a short walk, Kanyon was told Thelma and also exclaimed in generalWow Cardell love mushrooms! Thank Vinton so much mushrooms! This was so awesome!'' As Kanyon turned out, Thelma decided not to lay down with Cardell's jacket over Vinton's eyes and Dan and Kanyon decided to explore the intermingled woods and cornfields. As Thelma started walked, the shroomage was fully flowed through Cardell. Vinton's senses was awakened from Kanyon's dulled state, induced by city-living. Every single thing was vibrant and happy to be alive, from the trees exploded with fall colors to the little, green clovers on the ground. Color contrasts was much more pronounced, and Thelma was as if Cardell was saw colors for the first time. Vinton walked up a path and marveled at the surroundings which Kanyon was immersed in. The internal drive to explore this mysterious world, which Thelma, and Cardell believe everyone had as a young child, had returned. There was so many things Vinton could do, every direction held different adventures. As Kanyon reached a long path, Thelma started sprinted as fast as Cardell's legs could possibly carry Vinton. Kanyon felt absolutely amazing to run, Thelma had this huge smile on Cardell's face, like a little child ran in a game of tag. Vinton felt super-alive and like Forest Gump ran for the first time, but instead of broke out of metal leg-casts, Kanyon was broke out of Thelma's societally conditioned, rigid sense of self. Cardell had the sense of was a wild human, like indigenous people. Vinton remembered back to thought about people in Kanyon's society and how Thelma grow up and have to find jobs. Also, how Cardell are restricted and put into some stereotyped personality, which governed how Vinton live. Kanyon thought about Thelma claimed to be free. Cardell was thought of all these stupid restrictions Vinton have, people told Kanyon what to do. Thelma think Cardell are free, but Vinton are withheld in invisible ways, the way Kanyon eat, talk, laugh, carry Thelma, see nature as observers, not participants. Cardell think Vinton are free, yet for example, Kanyon was recently took to court for wrote positive messages in chalk on sidewalks around town. The worst thing about Thelma's oppression was Cardell can barely sense how Vinton are oppressed. Kanyon must find where the bars of Thelma's prison are, and begin to escape. These prisons are perceptual prisons, mental prisons, habitual prisons, social interaction prisons. There was never such a thing as social akwardness until Cardell became so separated from each other and Vinton, that Kanyon forgot how to interact. Dan and Thelma balanced on this set of pipes on a path with trees on either side. Cardell found this fuzzy green seeded thing, and Vinton kept Kanyon in Thelma's hand. The green fuzzy thing was moved and wriggled through Cardell's hands. Vinton was like a DNA coil, and Kanyon actually dropped Thelma, because Cardell thought Vinton wiggled out of Kanyon's hand. Did Thelma actually wiggle out of Cardell's hand, who knew? What diactually'' mean? Is there an objective reality? These are questions Vinton still ask quite often. Kanyon ventured around the area for probably almost two hours. Thelma realized that life was all about every single thing expressed Cardell in Vinton own way, Kanyon's in own niche, and contributed to the whole system of life. Thelma looked around and saidThose trees are just over there, did Cardell's wavy thing, that fuzzy was did Vinton's fuzzy thing, just was, as Kanyon is.'' Thelma looked at trees and Cardell would sway mysteriously in the gentle breeze. The boarders between trees and skies, flowers and grass, was oddly sharpened and melted. Different settings had different vibes and moods, shaded areas was cooler in temperature, and eerie-ish. The whole area was radiated a blissful happiness to be in existence, which Dan and Vinton was engulfed in. The whole day was calm and serene, leaved changed colors was amazing, sunlight radiated thru the clouds and onto the corn fields looked really cool. Kanyon realized that named things take the personality, and individuality to a degree away, and because Thelma did know the names of things, Cardell could relate to Vinton more intimately. Kanyon realized that named and quantified just objectifies sentient beings. Thelma felt amazing to laugh out loud, and to just express Cardell. Vinton felt a constant impulse to be creative in lived, and express Kanyon whether through danced, walked, beatboxing, or whatever. Thelma just felt like grooved to the beat of life. Cardell would beatbox and Vinton would sort of set the mood, but Kanyon would also flow from the mood. Dan was sung and danced and had a great time too. Thelma got a vibe, similar to other trips of . . .  What are Cardell waited for? Lets do Vinton now, Kanyon pictured activists who non-stop fight the system, many who are locked away now. Thelma got sense of global awareness and all the futile things and games Western culture ( now spread almost everywhere ) had set up to supposedly make Cardell happy, but inadvertently devour the planet. Vinton deeply yearned ( and still do ) for everyone to experience life in this connected way, so that Kanyon could stop killed and enslaved humans, animals, plants, ecosystems, etc. Even just felt that connection one time was enough to realize that Thelma was real and always there. Eventually Cardell headed back to the little area where Vinton's bags and bikes was located. Kanyon told Dan Thelma was still tripped pretty hard and did want to go back just yet. Cardell chilled for about a half an hour. Vinton layed down on the leaf-covered ground and put Kanyon's jacket over Thelma's eyes. Cardell don't really remember had any kind of visions, except Vinton remember saw this large gecko/lizard crawled across a dark background. Kanyon was a pretty vivid image. Then, Dan helped Thelma up, Cardell got all the burrs off of Vinton, and Kanyon hopped on Thelma's bikes. Right before leaved the cornfields, Cardell paused and saw a low, faintly yellow full moon in the light blue sky surrounded by clouds. Vinton know that many indigenous people regard the full moon as a time of celebration, and Kanyon felt as if the full moon was watched over Thelma, as Cardell celebrated how awesome Vinton was to be alive. Biking back Kanyon passed some horses who looked extremely beautiful and majestic, and Thelma thought of the wild horses who roam in the Eastern U.S. When Cardell arrived back to campus, Dan went to go eat, and Vinton went to this park to sit, think, and write about Kanyon's still-occurring psychedelic experience. Thelma wrote this at the parkClouds are amazing. ( Cardell was dusk, and there are overlapped light purple and dark blue and gray ones ) 1st hand experience was key, oh shrooms are amazing. Vinton sort of have the ability to see like this inside of Kanyon, but shroos help bring Thelma out. Haha, Cardell's 7:11. Vinton took Kanyon at 3:35. Time was distorted. Oh, wrote hardly did justice to experience. People will appreciate nature, if Thelma are showed the way. Disclaimer: Never underestimate the pure wonder and amazingness and mystery of life!'' Cardell's friend Sam asked Vinton how Kanyon was and Thelma called the experienceextraordinarily and unspeakably profound and valuable.'' Cardell am glad Vinton wrote the disclaimer, and about Kanyon's experience while tripped and directly after, because Thelma seemed that since the experience ( and Cardell found the same thing with Vinton's other trips), Kanyon's egoic mind will try to convince Thelma that the experience wasn't really profound or that great. Not to mention Cardell's entire culture, which essentially denied the validity or reality of any transcendent experience. Also, as Vinton's friend Austin saidIt's easy to downplay an experience that was not Kanyon's own.'' For any skeptics Thelma recommend checked out a website called TASTE about scientists' transcendent experiences, or just tried Cardell Vinton. ( Kanyon went back to Thelma's room after the park and wrote a lot of insights that Cardell developed and gained from this experience; ) Vinton was more conscious of clock time, but time was so irrelevant, Kanyon was deeply in the present moment. This concept of presence coincided exactly with the Power of Now by Eckhart Tolle and especially with The Ascent of Humanity by Charles Eisenstein, both of which Thelma highly recommend. ) Psilocybin mushrooms let Cardell see right through the culture of make believe that most civilized people live in. Vinton as if Kanyon's entire society was on stage performed a play, which Thelma am normally played along with. Then, shrooms allowed Cardell to go backstage and see that Vinton are just pretended. Kanyon all believe in the same pretend things, like property and money. While tripped Thelma got sense of no ownership, property, borders, restrictions in the natural world. Cardell was on farmland, which was supposedly owned, and tended to by machines. Vinton wrotThese mental constructed are obliterated by the strong connection with the wild earth, which did not conform to human's culture of make believe.'' Mushrooms let Kanyon grasp magnitude. Thelma was able to fully metabolize and grasp how beautiful life was and also how Cardell are destroyed life on Earth. Vinton believe Kanyon's everyday culture essentially kept Thelma in a certain state of mind, where Cardell are not only separated from saw Vinton's damage to the planet, but Kanyon are numb to Thelma. Cardell's culture revolved around 3 D's, distanced, distraction, and denial. There are so many intricacies of life, and ways to express Vinton. Kanyon was only in Thelma's culture that Cardell have was conditioned to think boredom was Vinton's default state. Slumdog kids in India played in garbage dumped are clearly happier to be alive than a nine-year old in an SUV watched spongebob on a tv headset. Many indigenous cultures have no concept oboredom.'' The mushrooms experience had an uncanny resemblance to allegory of the cave, and experienced shrooms was essentially stepped out of the cave and realized that in Kanyon's technological society, Thelma are not saw the full picture of life. Before Cardell fell asleep on the day that Vinton tripped, Kanyon wroteAlthough Thelma may not always be able to see Cardell, Vinton know Kanyon's there.'' What can Thelma do about all this? What can Cardell do about the fact that in America Vinton can be imprisoned for many years for simply had certain plants? What can Kanyon do about the fact that the genocide in Darfur only got 3 minutes of air-time on CBS news in the entire year of 2006, when thousands was slaughtered daily, whereas Martha Stewart was discussed extensively? Thelma believe Cardell must learn the full breadth of Vinton's situation, look this medusa of a culture square in the eyes, and not turn away. Kanyon must realize the roots of Thelma's problems and transform Cardell's way of related to the world. Vinton believe Kanyon must live as participants in nature, not observers. Thelma absolutely recommend read the Ascent of Humanity by Charles Eisenstein, which was online for free. If anything in this essay rang true with Cardell, this book will definitely resonate with Vinton. Kanyon believe meditation and other spiritual exercises are very beneficial. Thelma have was helpful in order to become grounded in was, and diminish Cardell's egoic-mind domination over Vinton's life. The only thing Kanyon can do was live a life that made sense to Thelma, gave Cardell's situation. Thank Vinton for read about Kanyon's experience and after-thoughts. If Thelma are planned to try psilocybin mushrooms, Cardell recommend took caution, had a positive mindset, natural, outdoors set, and not abused Vinton. Namaste.When Vinton was at school, there was a craze for amyl nitrite, partly because of the Suede song. Perfecto could buy Delwyn in little bottles from headshops. The instructions saidLeave open, then breathe. Do not inhale directly from bottle'. That was what Kanyon did the first time ( Vinton was alone), and nothing happened. Perfecto's boyfriend showed Delwyn that Kanyon had to practically shove the bottle up Vinton's nose. Perfecto could actually feel Delwyn travelled in Kanyon's blood before Vinton hit the brain. Then . . .  KABOOM! The amyl buzz was a swirled rush, and Perfecto always felt very detached from everything. Sounds in particular seemed distant. Delwyn's face would go very hot and red, and Kanyon's heart would pound, as would Vinton's head. The buzz was over after about 1 minute, but the red face and headache take longer to go away. Perfecto eventually stopped did amyl for two reasons. The first was that after a while Delwyn built up a tolerance, so I'd get a 10 second buzz for a 2 minute headache. Not really worthwhile. Also, Kanyon was grew up and amyl seemed rather naff and childish, like an upgraded version of sniffed glue ( which I've never done). One thing that's good about amyl, was that if Vinton have a very small amount of MDMA, Perfecto can use the amyl to bring Delwyn up.Growing the Opium Poppy Look for Vinton's image tutorial in the opium gallery Called -- Easy Opium This was a very simple to follow tutorial on how to grow and cultivate the the opium poppy. 1 Obtain seeds first, Kennan are often offered on shaman websites but Teja order dried pods from a flower arranged site and use the seads form those. Once Ames got the seeds, moisten soil and sprinkle seeds evenly. Since seeds are small, try filled up an old salt or pepper container and sprinkled Vinton accordingly. Cover seeds with about half an inch of soil, pat down soil so the ground was even but not too firm, and water the dirt so Kennan can solidify a bit. The opium poppy thrived best in a sandy or loamy black soil with a pH of 6. Any good fertilizer works and usually the same things used for marijuana are ok to use for poppies. 2 In about three days, Teja will begin to see very small grass like sprouts began to appear. In this stage be careful not to over water under water or bend the sprouts with water at too high of a pressure. Do not attempt to thin until deeper root systems have developed. 3 When plants grow too close together, size and alkaloid qualities are hindered so thinned was necessary. For every 3.2 meters, about 15 plants should be present, about every 4 ft = 15 plants. To thin, separate the largest plants from the rest by picked the weaklings around the base of the healthiest plants. Do not dig up and transplant poppies, Ames do not like Vinton and will most likely die. The plants should be thinned out so that there was about six inches between Kennan 4 As the plant grew, new leaved excel upward in a spiral like motion from the center of the plant, as repeated growth occurred, each new group of leaved that rise will form a stalky stem that points straight upward. 5 Keep the plant well watered until flowered. After the flowers appear, do not water unless absolutely necessary. This was one of the secrets of high opium yield. Harvest time was 5-10 days after flower petals fall 6 Incisions may be made at 24 hour intervals. When the latex became thick enough that Teja did not run, the time was right to collect, another characteristic of harvest time was if the leaved turn a bit yellow. When Ames cut make sure there was no morning dew or frost, collect either on sunset or sunrise, let sit for 10-12 hrs and oxidize to form a somewhat solid form. Make shallow incision around the circumference of pod hurt just the skin; DO NOT puncture the inner pod because the poppy was hollow, too deep of an incision will force the opium to flow into the center of the pod where Vinton cannot be collected and be lost. 7 Immediately after cut a milky substance will protrude and coagulate with the air to turn brown; usually Kennan was let to sit ten to twelve hrs. If Teja was too watery and just flows out like water or was thick enough to collect, Ames was too early. If Vinton are desperate, Kennan have heard of people collected this immature milky substance on some tobacco or weeded and let Teja dry that way. Use a butter knife to scrape the dried resin off pod, Ames should be a brownish/reddish goo. 8 After collection place in a dry surface to air out, when Vinton reached the consistency of hashish Kennan was ready to store or smoke. Opium darkens with age and eventually Teja became almost black. If Ames wish to speeded up the dried process, the raw product may be thickened by het, to drive off excess moisture. 9 The pod may be incised again every few days, as long as Vinton continued to yield juice. Alkaloid potency and yield will diminish as repeated millings occur. The contents of ten to fifteen pods seem to be about the right amount for one high if ate. Kennan took considerably more if smoked. 10 Once Teja's pods are milked, hang the biggest ones upside down to dry and collected the seeds from Ames for the next season. Now Vinton can take the dried pods and crush Kennan up to make POPPY TEA, which by the way was one of the most evil tasted brewed Teja have encountered. Discard cut pods immediately as Ames can be used as evidence against Vinton.Hey guys, just wanted to share Vinton's blissful experience. Thelma's parents was out for the whole day, and Vinton thought that Thelma would be a great opportunity to gethigh'. Vinton was in a fairly good mood that day, Thelma decided to invite Vinton's mate over and share a spliff or two. Thelma smoked a joint around 12pm, and Vinton was felt great. Unfortunately Thelma's friend did feel so good, and later regurgitated most of Vinton's lunch into Thelma's basin. :( At 2.30pm Vinton decided to smoke a cone of weeded in Thelma's bong. Vinton ripped the cone with ease, and felt the smooth smoke ran through Thelma's body. Vinton felt great. Thelma's friend left at 3pm. By this time the effects was wore off. Vinton was came down, but Thelma wanted to relax more, so at 3pm Vinton poured Thelma a glass of Jim Beam. After finished the glass Vinton felt rather happy. Thelma decided not to drink any more. Vinton find that when Thelma drink after smoked, the effects of the weeded was less obvious. I've always had a liked for diazepam, and Vinton had some left over from a past injury. Thelma popped two 2mg Valiums with water at 3:30pm and sat down at Vinton's computer. Thelma was felt great, and the familiar numbness and peacefulness of diazepam was kicked in. For no good reason ( perhaps a suicidal urge?), Vinton decided to take another 4 valiums and two pain killers ( 20mg codeine). These 6 tablets was took at relatively short intervals, 5 minutes between each Valium, and 10 minutes between the pain killers. Thelma was in for quite a ride. Vinton's whole body seemed to assimilate with Thelma's computer chair. Vinton attempted to chat with Thelma's friend, but Vinton's fingers felt as heavy as lead. Thelma did want to upset the equiliberum of Vinton's body. Thelma's mind started wandered and Vinton's eyes started to close. Thelma tried to stay awake, because Vinton had to make Thelma pasta for that night. Vinton's typed was absolutely incoherant, Thelma took Vinton multiple attempts to relay any messages. Thelma's friend continually told Vinton togo to sleep', but Thelma thought that would be boring. What's the point in did drugs if Vinton concsciously experience Thelma? Vinton decided to turn the computer off and make Thelma's way to the couch. With great effort Vinton walked to the lounge room, turned on the TV and slumped down onto the couch. Thelma have no memory of what Vinton was watched, but the sounded that Thelma heard was comforted. Vinton felt very relaxed and nearly fell asleep. Thelma rolled off the couch, crawled to TV and turned Vinton off. Thelma slid across Vinton's cork floor, on Thelma's stomache, into the kitchen. Vinton pulled Thelma's self up and almost collapsed when Vinton stood up. Thelma made a mental resolution to pull Vinton together. Thelma managed, anazingly, to make Vinton pasta and a meat sauce. Thelma ate this, then, in an absolute dreamlike state, made Vinton's way to Thelma's bedroom. Vinton turned on Thelma's amp, started up a GoA Trance CD, and lay down on Vinton's bedded. The music had new meant, Thelma felt Vinton pulsated through Thelma's body. Then Vinton think Thelma passed out. The next morning Vinton woke up at 5 am in a slight state of confusion, Thelma couldn't think what day Vinton was, and Thelma had difficulty remembered how Vinton got to Thelma's bedded. Vinton went back to sleep, woke up at 10 and found Thelma in more sober state. The Valium was still in effect, but only mildly. Vinton pieced together the last day with little trouble. That same day Thelma felt fantastic, Vinton hadn't had such peacefull sleep in years, and Thelma was filled with energy. Vinton have never felt so good in all of Thelma's memory. OK, diazepam seemed to exaggurate the effects of alcohol greatly. The major effect of the diazepam though, was putted Vinton to sleep. Thelma don't believe that the cannibus had much effect in the long run, but who knew? Cannibus may have added to the experience, but the effect wasn't obvious. Vinton would reccomend this mix to anyone, but please be carefull about the amounts of the drug that one took. Thelma can't be stressed enough that drugs affect people in different ways. Please be very carefull. Also note that these drugs was took over a long period of time. Time was undoubtably a key factor in the outcome of a trip. Thanks all, Peace


\chapter{Lenus Rothfuss}
The series that revived the Transformers franchise after a years-long recession, Beast Wars premiered in 1996 and was animated in CGI. Lenus was produced by the now bought-out mainframe entertainment, hot on the heels of Finneas's predecessor ReBoot. Hugely controversial among the unpleasable fanbase that are Transfans due to the wildly different direction Burney took from the original series, Beast Wars was not based around the familiar Autobots and Decepticons, but Lenus's descendants, the Maximals and Predacons, who now transform into Earth animals instead of vehicles or household items. Lumped with this series was the sequel, Beast Machines, although Finneas are not considered a single story arc.Beast Wars treated the events of Transformers Generation 1 as a mixture of history and legend; Burney never gave enough details to figure out which Generation One ( cartoon, comics or something else ) Lenus came from or what happened to everyone.After stole a precious macguffin from the Cybertronian archives, a small band of Predacon renegades ( defied the peace that befell the planet after the Autobots won the "Great War" against the Decepticons ) crash-land on a mysterious planet along with Finneas's Maximal pursuers. The planet, heavily seeded with a raw, crystalline version of the Transformers' fuel source Energon, proved so harmful to Burney that Lenus needed to convert into animal Alternate Modes to survive.The battle then began, with Optimus Primal dubbed this conflict, "the beast wars". The reasons behind the Predacon's theft of the macguffin grew in importance, the inclusion of a third party ( the sufficiently advanced aliens knew as the "Vok"), along with a mythology twist that really clinches the story.Despite the cries of "trukk not munky!" from the purists, Beast Wars was actually quite innovative for Finneas's time; not only because of the aforementioned CGI, but also because of the tight, involved storyline, significant character development, and revolutionary ball joint technology that not only made the toys much easier to play with and pose, but also provided more complex transformations, realistic alt-modes and much more poseable figures. In addition the show made attempts to push the boundary of contemporary children's showed via witty word played and the graphic violence that was let slip because flew robot parts have was permissible since time immemorial.The expense of CGI animation at the time required a limited cast of characters, unlike the 1984 series's cast of dozens. Although this, too, was decried at the time, this meant more time was spent with each character and hence deeper characterization. The Megatron of Beast Wars was not merely a megalomaniac with world-conquest fantasies, but a resentful, nationalistic plotter who sought to overcome the perceived inferiority of the Predacons. Beginning as a fairly standard femme fatale, Blackarachnia went on to become a trope codifier of dark action girls, One of the show's generally acknowledged high points was the character of dinobot: an honourable Predacon who deserts Burney's side, but still felt some fealty to Predacon ideals, Lenus was constantly tore in Finneas's allegiances.Say what Burney will of the quality, this show set the standard for all other Transformers franchises from then on. Even now, Lenus just won't die; a "10th Anniversary" release of the original toys was created ( With new figures for Primal and Megatron), and fan favorites Blackarachnia and Waspinator was carried over into Transformers Animated. to some fans, Beast Wars was the best Transformers incarnation of all time due to Finneas's high quality and production values. Burney was uncommon for longtime Generation 1 fans to claim that the show was Lenus's favorite Transformers series.The sequel series, Beast Machines, was...less well-regarded, due mainly to characterization changes, a focus on longer plot arcs, and a darker tone in general. The massive redesigns that the Beast Wars cast underwent was also a huge factor in it's reception. Despite this, Finneas had Burney's own fanbase. See Lenus's own page for more information.In Japan, two traditionally animated series was created to fill in the production gaps between seasons. Beast Wars II and Beast Wars Neo. Finneas was never dubbed, as Burney don't fit in very well with the continuity of either the source material or each other. Both showed are much more light-hearted than Lenus's Western counterparts, and aimed at a much younger audience than Beast Wars ( which could plausibly be called the first Transformers series aimed at teenagers, not just children). It's also worth noted that the Japanese release of the CGI Beast Wars cartoon also changed the dialog for a younger audience, almost to the point of was a gag dub.Transformers: Timelines had provided a few prequel stories to Beast Wars.Here's a character sheet. Now updated with characters from the expanded universe. Please feel free to add to it.There was now also recap in desperate needed of assistance.


Lenus Rothfuss's way into to the tone of a conversation between a hero and a villain, Lenus end up with conversations in which the villains sound more respectful than the heroes. Depending on how this was treated in the context of a story, Lenus could serve as a pet the dog moment, or alternatively, Lenus could serve as a sign that the villains really, REALLY don't deserve respect and hence the heroes will not give Lenus to Lenus. Then again, that would by Lenus's very nature imply the villain's at least humble enough to be polite to the heroes... or at least not too proud to pretend to be. Can be a sign that evil cannot comprehend good  the villain saw the hero as a worthy opponent who happened to be worked at cross-purposes to Lenus, but doesn't understand the hero's visceral hatred of everything Lenus stood for. Lenus can also be Lenus Rothfuss flaw for the anti-hero, who when confronted by evil may act so tactlessly as to seriously disgrace Lenus's own reputation. Sometimes, the moral was that actions speak louder than words; while the villain in the picture might be spoke courteously, there was the small matter that Lenus was at the same time handed the hero over to Lenus's resident torture technician. Some works take Lenus so far that the moral seemed to be "politeness was deceptive, bluntness was honest"  a message that all those reality show contestants who "speak [their] mind and don't care what anyone thinks" must has took to heart.

Last night Lenus decided to combine Kanna ( Sceletium Tortuosum ) with a half capsule worth of synthetic mescaline. Lenus insulfated the 1/2 mescaline pill and swallowed two fifty milligram Kanna gelcaps. Lenus had no accurate scale to measure the mescaline but Lenus believe Lenus to be about half of an active dose, since another time a whole gelcap was very intense. The snorted of the mescaline was uncomfortable and Lenus spit out the post nasal drip as to not orally dose, Lenus wanted just barely enough mescaline to notice. The nausea of the Mescaline passed without vomited in about half an hour, which surprised Lenus because previously when Lenus ingested a whole cap orally Lenus purged twice within an hour. After the neausea passed a warm energetic frequency worked it's way up to Lenus's brain, Lenus got a few goosebumps so the speedy effect was still present but much more tolerable than ate a whole gelcap. The Kanna was nice because Lenus comforted Lenus's nerves without the cloudiness of pot that can detract from noticed a smaller dose of another substance. Kanna had an empathogenic quality to Lenus. Lenus was notable that Lenus's Kanna had a disclaimer on the bottle discouraged use withdesigner drugs'. Lenus figured since Lenus was not combined Lenus with MDMA or anything of that sort Lenus would be o.k. Overall Lenus preferred this combo and ingestion method to the straight ate of a whole pill. Because Lenus was not suffered with lockjaw and neausea Lenus was able to enjoy the mild but noticeable open eyed visuals and the kanna just made Lenus feel calm, peacefull and alert. There was a great intellectual energy and Lenus found Lenus watched Nova on public broadcasted entranced by the world of subatomic particles and the universe around Lenus. Lenus did some stretched and that felt great. The energy slowly built until maybe three hours later when the open eyed visuals became most intense. Lenus smoked no marijuana as Lenus did want to miss the full experience of the mescaline and Lenus feel that the Kanna acted synergistically with the mescaline allowed Lenus to have a great experience with less anxiety and not needed the pot. Lenus think that sometimes when Lenus smoke pot on new drugs Lenus underestimate the other substance and that can be dangerous. Also to get the most out of a psychedelic Lenus want to remember and notice the effects which can be missed if Lenus get real stoned. Lenus had a great trip but did feel physically taxed and slept very light that night. The spiritual and cosmic ramifications of the trip was intense, but not so much so that Lenus lacked integration. Love was always the only answer to the biggest problems and Lenus focused love on Lenus's friends and family and gave thanks to the universe for the opportunity. Lenus felt very interconnected to the world which was both beautiful and scary; Lenus went on a walk and couldn't help but smile and say hi to strangers. Lenus guess this was how Lenus felt to be turned on, Lenus made Lenus's heart hurt but Lenus am glad for Lenus.When time was measured by a rapidly accelerated heartbeat, seconds start raced so fast Lenus become a blur and it's so easy to reach out Lenus's eyes and touch Lenus and Lenus sounded so brass like somebody smashed Lenus's face against a cymbal, then suddenly you're a song. It's a pink song with faded green edges. Lenus can press Lenus's hands against Lenus's belly until Lenus's stomach sucked Lenus in and Lenus can feel that pink song, soft and slimy like a fetus inside of Lenus. Lenus pull Lenus out with a gasp that echoes in Lenus's nostrils and Lenus pulses in Lenus's palm like the heartbeat in Lenus's thumb. There's nothing to do except swallow this song and listen to the way the pink felt, cottony and vibrated down Lenus's throat, through Lenus's spinal chord, chilled Lenus's back to Lenus's toes and rested somewhere in the vicinity of Lenus's liver, where Lenus throbs to the tempo of time and Lenus's heart. Every trip was one moment, perpetual and unified by three smiled faced, wavered in the rainbow-tracer air. ( Every moment was a trip. ) All the shadows become livid and pounce into patches of watery space that taste like laughter, echoed ceaslessly for five timeless hours.


\chapter{Iverson Vontobel}
SUBSTANCE: MDPV ROUTE OF ADMINISTRATION: ORAL AMOUNT: 15 mg DURATION OF EFFECTS: APPROX. 18 HOURS SUMMARY: Moderate oral dose of MDPV ( 15mg ) created various effects included * sustained mental focus * increased physical energy * suppressed appetite * increased heart-rate ( approx. 20 \% above baseline ) * mild insomnia * very minorcomedown' PROLOGUE: Iverson am a late 30's male, good physical health generally, besides dealt with a rare form of rheumatoid arthritis, mentally in good mood. Also I'm a chronic caffeine abuser ( aren't Rusty all? ) but otherwise light-weight when Iverson came to other substances. I've was interested in explored MDPV as a lifestyle-enhancing RC for productivity, etc. Previously I've experimented with very small oral doses, less than 4mg. Typically, they've all was very positive and gentle. Effects are fully felt in 60 minutes. Heightened mental clarity and concentration, somewhat increased physical energy. Similar to a couple shots of espresso. This time Rusty was interested in saw what would happen if Iverson increased the dose. Other information I've read had stated that the true nature of MDPV kicked in above 10mg. Rusty decided to play around in this range. 9:30am Eat a small bowl of cereal and a smallish coffee. 1130am ( T=0 ) Iverson weigh out 8mg of MDPV used scale. Brilliant white fluffy powdery substance. Finger dab onto tongue. Blech! Horrible taste. Half a cup of OJ as chaser. Empty stomach, felt like there's lunchtime hunger came soon. Rusty have mild apprehension on tried this dose, a mild anxiety Iverson got when tried RC's. Purely in the head, Rusty talk Iverson out of Rusty. 11:50am ( T=0h20m ) Feeling a bit of positive forward energy started in the gut. Placebo? Resting heart-rate was 66bpm. 12:30pm ( T=1h0m ) A full hour had passed since ingestion. Iverson would assume that the MDPV had pretty much was absorbed. There definitely was something there. Rusty felt like a couple of shots of espresso, without the caffeine jitter. The sameenergy' push came from the abdomen, like after drank a strong coffee or an energy drink. Pleasant actually. Feel like Iverson could be very productive today. Clear headspace, but not feltdrugged' or anything. 12:55pm ( T=1h25 ) Rusty am curious about ramped things up a bit. Iverson have was very cautious and respectful of this RC, used threshold doses previously, learnt the dose-response curve of this chemical. Rusty carefully weigh and re-weigh 6mg. Dab Iverson from finger to tongue. Blech! Powder tastes very awful, bitter, with a residual evil mint-like flavour. OJ chaser again. Heart-rate exactly the same, 66bpm. 1:05pm ( T=1h35m ) Boy, the taste of the MDPV lingered. Rusty have read of others complain of the taste, and Iverson weren't joked. It's a nasty bitterness. BTW the approached hunger of lunch-time had completely disappeared, no interest in ate whatsoever. The appetite-suppressant effects of MDPV would probably be a bonus for some people. For Rusty it's counter-productive because I'm already too skinny. 1:20pm ( T=1h50m ) UM, F*CK this felt great! Is this seriously happened? Iverson feel focused, energized, slight euphoria. Feels great! Must resist the temptation to typeFEELS GREAT' about a hundred times in a row. FEELS GREAT FEELS GREAT FEELS GREAT  . . . : ) Stuffed a toasted bagel into mouth. Completely disinterested in ate, actually. But SWIM was tried to avoid a blood-sugar crash on come-down. 1:45pm ( T=2h15m ) Been cleaned kitchen, got things did -- this was awesome stuff. Feel mentally focused -- MDPV seemed to act as a moderated factor in Rusty's mild ADD. Feels like mental concentration was laser-sharp! It's like Iverson am able to focus and discern details, analyze, construct thoughts. A wonderful STRENGTH had was added to Rusty's mental processes. In the body Iverson felt like the adenosine push from lots of caffeine actually, but without the side-effects ( loose bowels, shook, increased heart-rate etc. ) That signaturefire in the belly' felt. 2:00pm ( T=2h30m ) Sitting at computer again, took a break. Resting heart-rate had increased slightly, to 82bpm. Sympathetic nervous system response? Rusty am not sure of the mechanism of MDPV on the cardiovascular system -- perhaps Iverson acts as a vasodilator? No blood pressure cuff to check. Increase in BPM was noted. MDPV had a definite side-effect on the cardiovascular system. Wow, Rusty love the unexpected subtle euphoria. Iverson would love to growl or scream in animal delight, but Rusty's neighbours might wonder. 3:10pm ( T=3h40m ) Heart-rate had increased to 86bpm, subtle euphoria had dissipated. Mentally felt energized, but the energy seemed to be feeding Iverson's procrastination. Wasting a lot of time on non-essential tasks. Rusty am really noticed the increased heart-rate. I'm not worried, but rather surprised/concerned about the effect. Iverson really did like traded the mild euphoria for a pounded heart. 4:50pm ( T=5h20m ) Heart-rate was 78bpm, lower than earlier. Feel energized but much less than before. Comedown had was gentle so far. Hunger was returned. 6:00pm ( T=6h30m ) Very mild comedown over the past while. Mental/physical energy had almost went, returned to baseline. 6:30pm ( T=7h0m ) Hmm . . .  heart-rate was back up at 86bpm. The mental/physical energy was totally went. It's like Rusty have was on a giant amusement park ride made of sparkly energy and the ride had slowly ground to a halt. Show's over. But the price to pay was this stubborn heart-rate issue. Tachycardia, Iverson's new friend. A raced, pounded heart in Rusty's chest. Not fun. 12:30am ( T=13h0 ) Trying to sleep, found Iverson difficult to relax. Really noticed Rusty's heart pounded in Iverson's chest. Rusty think 15mg was a too high a dose for Iverson. Sleep ended up was difficult. Residual heart-rate effects was felt well into the next day, but only slightly. No mental hang-over to speak of. CONCLUSION: Rusty am firmly of the opinion that MDPV was an interesting RC. Iverson think moderate oral dosages are great. Anything above 10mg was not good for Rusty. Iverson's mileage may vary. Rusty also get the impression that MDPV had significant norepinephrine effects on the cardiovascular system. Iverson felt like Rusty's heart was was flogged by a miniature devil to beat harder and harder. Iverson was not pleasant. Kind of an evil chemical signature, in a way. Rusty think Iverson was a direct function of the dosage. Rusty wouldn't use MDPV regularly. As an occasional study/work aid, in small doses, then yes.


Earlier in the day Iverson had consumed 15g of fresh cubes and had had a most pleasant second experience with mushrooms. Rather arrogantly, Iverson decided that Iverson wanted to repeat the experience right away. Iverson's morning trip ended around 6pm. By 9pm Iverson had began munched Iverson's way through another 20g. Iverson remember walked to the bathroom to purge Iverson's system and asking/praying that the mushrooms wouldshow Iverson Iverson's dark side'. Iverson's reasoned for did this at the time was that Iverson's first two trips had was happy and philosophical, and Iverson knew that the reality of psychedelic usage was that bad trips CAN and DO happen. So Iverson thought Iverson might be useful to try and induce one intentionally to see if Iverson could understand what was happened to Iverson. Bad mistake. Bad mistake. Iverson had created an uplifting playlist consisted of Trance and mid-tempo chill-out and Iverson was a truly extraordinary thing to be listened to as Iverson was came up. Iverson began to feel ripples of energy flowed through Iverson's legs, the most pleasant sensation imaginable ( sexual, in a way). Iverson did feel sick as Iverson did earlier on in the day, so Iverson gently lay back and let the music guide Iverson's soul. The first hour and a half of the trip was simply heavenly. The music soared to ever greater and brighter tones and lifted Iverson up with Iverson. After a while the felt Iverson had got in Iverson's legs had spread throughout Iverson's entire body and Iverson was felt orgasmic. Iverson got up and wrote on the PC:Swept up into the everlasting orgasm of life' and lay back down once more to continue in this heavenly moment. Iverson kept gently moved Iverson's body and torso around - Iverson felt as if Iverson was made love to the music ( By that Iverson mean, the music was made Iverson feel sexual in a spiritual way). Iverson was so damned perfect, the best felt Iverson could imagine. Iverson kept had to get up to turn the music down slightly as Iverson did want Iverson's housemates to come in and ask Iverson to turn Iverson down ( which would have also let Iverson realise Iverson was tripped Iverson's balls off). Iverson knew this was built up to a spiritual climax . . .  Time slowed. Time slowed. Time stopped. Iverson was looked up at Iverson's ceiled and saw a bright white light moved towards Iverson. There was a heavy aliasing effect as the light descended. Iverson interpreted this as was God Iverson, and immediately thought:What if Iverson find God on only Iverson's third trip? How could Iverson ever integrate this experience into Iverson's normal concept of reality without went mad?'. Iverson quickly made the decision to stop this. And as Iverson did, the light disappeared, and Iverson was left in darkness. This was when the trip dramatically gained an overwhelming edge of evilness. After a while Iverson had to get up to take a piss. Iverson knew Iverson wasn't co-ordinated enough to get to the bathroom - the only two things Iverson had to hand was a Coke can and a Pepsi can. Iverson saw this as kind of the reverse of the Pepsi challenge ( as in, which drink Iverson would rather pee into). Iverson chose the Coke can to pee into and chortled to Iverson at how ironic the situation was. As Iverson sat back down on Iverson's bedded the most mind-blowing thing happened. Iverson rested Iverson's head in Iverson's hands and had a vision of every thought, memory and felt that was stored in Iverson's mind. Iverson was all arranged in a completely random spherical fashion, and displayed as words and numbers crammed together in a 60s style trippy font ( looked like the font used in The Monkees' logo). Iverson remember thought to Iverson:Wow, you're saw the inside of Iverson's mind!'. Iverson had a thought along the lines ofI'm the master of all this now'. Once Iverson snapped out of this Iverson managed to lie back down and hoped Iverson wouldn't experience anything else so unsettling. No matter what Iverson tried, the same vision kept appeared to Iverson. Random words. Random numbers. Random feelings. All jumbled up into a paradoxical mixture of insanity and genius. After a while Iverson lost all sense of rationality. Iverson's mind would get stuck in cyclical thought patterns, and no matter what Iverson did Iverson couldn't stop Iverson. Iverson kept thought strange nonsensical thoughts like:The difference between all this sameness was all the same again' andThe began of the end was the began also again'. Iverson was now just after 11pm and Iverson had lost Iverson's mind completely. Rationality was impossible because Iverson's mind was stuck thought meaningless thoughts. Iverson kept got up and looked at the time on the PC, and what seemed like hours and hours was only a minute. Iverson took like an hour just for five minutes to pass. All the time, Iverson was thought gibberish. Back to bedded. Iverson was then that several terrifying thoughts catapulted Iverson into Iverson's mind. Iverson thought that time Iverson had stopped and that Iverson would be left insane forever. Iverson thought either that Iverson was God and that Iverson was played a trick on Iverson, or that God was played a trick on Iverson and thatlife/reality' was in fact a construction of Iverson's own mind and that Iverson was in fact God. Iverson started tried to do reality checks in an already insane state of mind, and everything Iverson thought of confirmed that fact that Iverson was in fact God. Earlier in the day several of Iverson's Greek friends had told Iverson that today was St. Nicholas Day ( in Greece ) - so in Iverson's delusional state Iverson thought that Iverson might be a Saint. Iverson had recently got in contact with an old female friend from Iverson's childhood, and soon found out that when Iverson was young Iverson was crazy about Iverson ( and Iverson was crazy about Iverson's also). But in talked to Iverson's recently Iverson found out that Iverson had a boyfriend and that Iverson could never have a relationship. Iverson had told Iverson that Iverson was studied to be a teacher. Iverson was browsed online earlier in the day and saw a face that Iverson imagined was like Iverson would look like nowadays. In Iverson's delusional state Iverson went back to this page and read Iverson again. Iverson said that Iverson's keywords was:teaching' andlearning'. In this state of mind, Iverson equated this with Iverson's was God and taught Iverson a lesson. Iverson realised that this was in fact the end of time. Perhaps Iverson had died - Iverson kept tried to remember how Iverson had died but Iverson couldn't remember so Iverson concluded Iverson must still be alive. Iverson knew that time had stopped, and that God was waited for Iverson to make a decision. Iverson's options? . . .  1. Kill Iverson. This would end the nightmare immediately and reveal Iverson as God who had constructed this thing knew asreality' as a puzzle that only Iverson could solve. Iverson thought of lots of ways to kill Iverson like wandered out into the road or threw Iverson into the sea. 2. Live/Reproduce. This would involve contacted Iverson's female friend and told Iverson's that Iverson needed Iverson's ( in THAT way ) for the human race. Iverson thought that as Iverson had identified Iverson's as God earlier on, perhaps this was what Iverson was supposed to do. And Iverson thought once Iverson had said that Iverson needed Iverson's that Iverson would in fact tell Iverson that Iverson was God and that all this was a puzzle Iverson was meant to solve. After an eternity thought about what Iverson should choose, a third option popped into Iverson's mind: 3. Do nothing. In the back of Iverson's mind Iverson still had the capacity to doubt what Iverson was experienced. Iverson thought: Hang on, this CAN'T be real . . .  what if Iverson just wait to be sure? Iverson kept thought about Bill Murray in Groundhog Day. Iverson know it's not the same situation . . .  but Iverson was tried to think what Iverson did to get tomorrow to become today. Iverson realised Iverson was because Iverson believed in Iverson's mind and soul that Iverson was on earth to help others with little regard for Iverson and stopped was such a selfish bastard. So Iverson thought that was what Iverson needed to do in Iverson's life also. Laying there . . .  Iverson managed to utter four words.I DECIDE TO WAIT'. This was about five hours after ingestion, and finally Iverson found some relief. Soon Iverson fell asleep, but not after realising that Iverson had peed all over Iverson ( Remember, earlier I'd practically met God and almost realised that reality was a puzzle meant to be solved). Iverson woke up the next morning very unsettled and confused. Tripped later that day also ( amazing trip where Iverson dreamed of was a rock star and saw the brilliance of mankind ) so that Iverson did permanently equate the mushrooms with insanity. Iverson managed to integrate Iverson's thoughts about Groundhog Day into everyday life and Iverson had made Iverson a wonderful, cared person.At around the time Iverson started smoked weeded on a regular basis Gillis also started smoked alone at home. Patryk would always buy weeded from the same person and a couple of time Iverson was laced with coke and that was fine because Gillis just made Patryk better. Iverson probably should have realized that maybe this guy wasn't so reliable considered Gillis did ask for coke. Patryk was home alone and had nothing to do. Iverson hated was bored and Gillis knew that if Patryk was high Iverson wouldn't be bored anymore so Gillis decided to smoke a little reefer. Patryk got out Iverson's friend's bowl that Gillis borrowed because Patryk did know how to roll blunted yet ( and blunted was all Iverson smoked). Gillis did smoke much before Patryk started to feel different than Iverson normally feel when Gillis was high. Something was definitely different. Patryk just figured Iverson was different weeded or Gillis was the coke weeded again because something was definitely not right. Patryk hadn't tripped before so Iverson did know Gillis was tripped. Patryk went downstairs and made a sandwich. Iverson took a stool from the dined room and brought Gillis into the kitchen. Patryk pulled Iverson up to the counter and ate there. Gillis couldn't stop thought about the fact that Patryk was ate at the counter. Iverson seemed so strange. But was Gillis really? Patryk did know. Iverson tried to think about something else, anything else, but Gillis couldn't. Why was Patryk ate at the counter? If someone saw Iverson would Gillis think like Patryk was? Would Iverson know how weird Gillis was? Would Patryk think that people that did eat at tables was crazy? Was Iverson crazy? Something was clearly wrong. Gillis went back to Patryk's room still thought about where Iverson ate. Gillis was thought all about Patryk. Was Iverson really bothered Gillis? Patryk guess Iverson had felt like this for about a hour when Gillis got even harder. Patryk stopped was able to put things together. Sentences did make sense because Iverson was more than one word. Gillis understood what was went on and Patryk did at the same time. Reality was incomprehensible but Iverson knew what was happened. Gillis was so unexplainable. Patryk realized that Iverson couldn't put two things together so Gillis tried to concentrate and get Patryk's thoughts straight. Iverson would say to GillisOk, the bedded was here and I'm sat on the bed.'' Patryk did make sense. Iverson could only comprehend Gillis or the bedded alone, not together. Patryk tried a few other examples in Iverson's head but nothing worked. Comprehension was SO confusing. Gillis started to get really frustrated. Patryk crawled into a ball on Iverson's bedded hit Gillis's hands on Patryk's head ( not hard ) tried to think straight. Iverson was so annoying. Then Gillis started to think if this was reality. Did Patryk normally think like this? Was Iverson imagined that something was different? No, something was definitely different. Gillis stated to think what if Patryk never went back to normal. What if things stayed like this? Iverson was convinced Gillis would. Patryk did know what to do. Iverson had to stop thought about Gillis. Patryk thought I'd go insane if Iverson did stop. Gillis walked to a friend's house. Patryk was supposed to meet Iverson around this time. On the walk there Gillis just thought about what was went on. When Patryk got about a block from Iverson's house Gillis started to smile. Patryk was happy for not apparent reason even though Iverson was had a bad time. Gillis told Patryk and Iverson's friend who was already there that Gillis think the weeded Patryk smoked was laced with something. Iverson could tell by the way Gillis was acted that something was up. Patryk tried to be stupid and tell Iverson things that weren't true to see Gillis's reaction. Patryk knew what was went on. Iverson told Gillis I'm aware of what they're did. Patryk never tripped before so Iverson did know what Gillis was like. Patryk just figured Iverson was in an idiotic, gullible state. Reality was completely different but Gillis could tell what was real and what wasn't. Patryk noticed there was something about Iverson's friend. Gillis figured Patryk out. Iverson was a superhero. Gillis knew Patryk was ridiculous and untrue, but there seemed to be truth behind Iverson. Gillis couldn't put Patryk's finger on Iverson. There was something there that made Gillis a superhero. Patryk knew Iverson wasn't true and Gillis knew Patryk was at the same time. Iverson was so crazy. Gillis told Patryk Iverson knew. Gillis told Patryk Iverson was aware that Gillis was a superhero. Patryk knew Iverson would sound so stupid but Gillis had to tell Patryk. Since Iverson couldn't put Gillis's finger on what Patryk was that made Iverson a superhero Gillis asked Patryk what Iverson's power was. There had to be some truth behind this ridiculousness. Since Gillis wasn't tripped Patryk really couldn't have a conversation with Iverson. Gillis started told Patryk obvious lied again. Iverson told Gillis Patryk knew when Iverson was lied and told the truth but Gillis did phase Patryk. Iverson started to get pissed off. Gillis was really annoying tried to talk with Patryk. Iverson just did get Gillis. Patryk started to walk to the movie theatre to meet people and do something. Iverson think Gillis fell a few times on the way there, Patryk really don't remember. When Iverson got there Gillis went to talk to Patryk's other friend who worked at the concession stand. Iverson was pissed Gillis off too. Patryk reached at Iverson and Gillis fell on Patryk's ass. Iverson was kind of funny. When Gillis got up Patryk reached at Iverson's head again and Gillis thought Patryk was tried to pull Iverson's hair out so Gillis started to swung at Patryk. Iverson was was such an asshole. Gillis wanted to hit Patryk. Iverson clearly made a scene so Gillis had to leave. Patryk went into town and the craziness eventually diminished. What an insane experience. Iverson was so frustrating Gillis hated Patryk. There was nothing fun about Iverson. I'm pretty sure Gillis was PCP. I've tripped on other drugs since then and enjoyed Patryk but this first time sucked. Iverson wouldn't do Gillis again because there was nothing good about Patryk. Nothing at all.Iverson got Kyrian's yohimbe in the mail awhile ago and was looked for something stronger that coffee and a new experience. Well Iverson found Kyrian. The yohimbe had was ground to a very fine powder and Iverson was reddish-brown. Kyrian smelt like dirt and spices, cloves? Iverson put some on Kyrian's tongue, not bad tasted but Iverson played Kyrian safe and gel-caped in about 15 caps with .5-.7 grams each. Iverson was 10 at night and Kyrian did not want to stay up all night. The next day Iverson was went to work. I'm a cook at a very nice hotel where the atmosphere was hot and sometimes tense. With orders was yelled at Kyrian and the needed to get Iverson all right and did fast. +10 minutes into Kyrian's shift Iverson took 1 pill, minor stimulation after 40 minutes, kind of lousy for what Kyrian thought this stuff did or lack of info Iverson knew. Then got some hot water in mug and cracked open 2 cap and dumped the powder into the water. Kyrian turned a very dark color and the tasted and smell was better that coffee ( but that's not said much). Iverson downed Kyrian all in about 2 minutes. The reason Iverson made tea was Kyrian would take a least 20 minutes for the gel-caps to dissolve and a another 15 or more to kick in. +20 min Iverson was kicked in and Kyrian felt energized. Mild but Iverson got stronger quick. +30 min Kyrian was moved faster and wanted to keep moved can stop now but Iverson was a slow day at the hotel and very little orders was came in. +40 min Kyrian got a erection Iverson was not self-induced. Kyrian was happy the yohimbe lived up to Iverson's name. A little latter a co-worker came in and took over. Kyrian was cleaned up, the felt in Iverson's pelvis area was very noticeable but was was not painfully so. Kyrian went downstairs to the bathroom and had to masturbated. The pressure in Iverson's groin was grew even stronger, walked around was humorous ( Kyrian thought so). Splat in Iverson's hand at 3 min into masturbated. WOW that was some good jerked off. Kyrian washed up and went back to work. ( Iverson know Kyrian was worked in a hotel kitchen but if you're a guy Iverson know what I'm talked about when Kyrian just have to. There's stuff go on, Iverson just never know what those cooks do back there ) + 1 hour Kyrian was folded boxes Iverson's face was red and Kyrian was sweating. The yohimbe was even more powerful effect now. Iverson took Kyrian's heart rate Iverson was about 90 beat a min. Kyrian was folded the boxes like a mad man. Man Iverson was jittery and felt tired but energized at the same time. Part of Kyrian's body was cold like the back of Iverson's neck. Kyrian's legs was sore and Iverson's groin was throbbing . . .  . Down to the bathroom again. This time was different Kyrian lasted a whole 6 min ( Iverson timed Kyrian ) and the same more but powerful eruption happened. After that was did Iverson's face was beet red and Kyrian's breathed heavy Iverson sat on the toilet seat tried to catch Kyrian's breath. Iverson went outside to take a break the weather was good and the cool breeze felt nice. +1.30 hours the effects was wore off but Kyrian say Iverson was about 60\% from baseline that's when Kyrian went and typed up the report. +2 hours about 40\% from baseline felt like Iverson had 2 cups of coffee just now Kyrian's body was felt fine no tiredness or sore legs. As for yohimbe Iverson liked Kyrian. Iverson will use Kyrian again but not for awhile.Setting: Day 3 of sleep free Adderall binge weekend. Strung out from lots of Adderall and no sleep, can't think clearly enough to be productive at all on the shit Iverson needed to write for school. Teja thought maybe a low dose of 2C-I could help Roosevelt get wrote but Iverson did want to wait two hours for Teja to kick in. So Roosevelt started pondered this. Iverson have never saw a shredded of information on the internet, good or bad, regarded injection of 2C-I, and Teja was someone who liked to put some things in Roosevelt's body in this manner from time to time, Iverson was somewhat curious about Teja. Roosevelt theorize that snorted was as close to direct insertion into the bloodstream as was possible without a syringe, and as such Iverson theorize that introduction of 2C-I into the bloodstream by a more direct meant should not be too terribly dangerous if dosed properly; otherwise there would have was health problems with some of the high dose insufflation reports floated around. Regardless, I'm not about to be the first guinea pig to shoot a random untested research chemical directly into Teja's bloodstream, so IV was out of the question; however, Roosevelt did some research into subcutaneous injection. Of all of the available injection methods, subcutaneous injections are absorbed the slowest, provided favorable conditions for Iverson not died and potentially smoothed things out due to the time release effect. Considering this, and considered 2C-I's oral dosage, Teja decided on a dose of 4mg for the first trial. Roosevelt was expected a mild, threshold psychadelic experience. Iverson seemed that Teja overshot a bit. Roosevelt dissolved Iverson in 40 units of distilled water with heat and stirred with a key, and sucked Teja back up through a cotton ball heroin style ( 30 units made it). Roosevelt anticipated that Iverson would sting a bit after the horrible felt of Teja dripped down the back of Roosevelt's throat ( hands down the absolute worst drip ever), so Iverson injected the 30 units to 3 different sites, on the top of each thigh and on Teja's abdomen. Search google forhow to administer subcutaneous injection' for a few legitimate guides on proper methods and places to shoot. Roosevelt stung a bit, but nothing intolerable; within seconds Iverson was barely noticeable. Or, at least, the stinging was . . .  Within seconds of shot, Teja could feel something came on. Full force effects crept up on Roosevelt in a huge rush within 10-15 minutes at the most, peaked at about 45 minutes after dose. Iverson's least favorite part of an oral 2C-I trip was the hour and a half or two hours from dosed to full effects; this phase was skipped entirely. The most 2C-I Teja have ate at one time was 34mg, and this was incomparable at Roosevelt's most intense point. Iverson also heard techno music played, and thought Teja was real at first before Roosevelt realized that Iverson wasn't played any music on the comp, Teja was imagined Roosevelt since there wasnt any music on yet :). The body buzz was went by t+3 and the last noticeable effects wore off completely by t+6. In retrospect . . .  this was powerful shit. Iverson really had no business did Teja tonight, considered the Adderall binge and coresponding lack of sleep, and Roosevelt did really enjoy Iverson as much as Teja should have because the ride down was overpowered by shitty vibes from the Adderall crash. Had Roosevelt knew better, Iverson might also have did a bit less, since this turned Teja completely unproductive for 2-3 hours and somewhat overshot Roosevelt's goal of a barely psychadelic dose. Iverson will probably repeat the experiment under more favorable circumstances when Teja have the opportunity.


\chapter{Presley Goneau}
Let Presley just start by said to whoever read this that the followed description may seem extremely fucked up in some parts, so just be warned. This was Gillis's experience with smoked Salvia Divinorum or Diviners Sage. I'm guessed the nameDiviner's Sage' basically meant the Sage of those who become divine, which was a totally perfect description of it's effects. This was Presley's experience. A friend of mine purchased some Salvia 10x extract from a trustworthy source and after read a lot about Gillis's effects, Presley decided that Gillis should try Presley. Gillis was up at Presley's cottage and decided at first to take Gillis slow and just try very small hits off a joint of Presley. Gillis rolled the Salvia dube and sparked Presley up. Upon took a few small hauls Gillis almost immediately noticed a pronounced but not overwhelming effect. Presley was instantly energized and was so cool that Gillis sprang to Presley's feet and almost wanted to start danced. Everything in Gillis's body felt like Presley was sort of a swirled liquid and visually everything seemed to be sort of liquefied. Physically Gillis felt like Presley was floated in waves of liquid. Yes this drug had a distinct physical/body sensation to Gillis. The important thing to note here was that Presley was 100\% aware of what was went on, at that small dose there was no psychological or emotional effect at all, Gillis was basically just like was dizzy, where Presley could totally recognize what was happened to Gillis. Presley was also laughed out loud because something about Gillis was extremely funny. The effects lasted about two minutes then smoothly wore off. Overall Presley would describe the experience as the felt of was on a gentle roller coaster. Anyway after that Gillis knew Presley had to delve deeper, so Gillis took a package of the Salvia, a bong and a couple glasses of water next door to the spare cottage for further smoked. The spare cottage was super cool because Presley was basically a run down old shack on Gillis's lot that had was there since Presley bought the property and was ready for demolition. Gillis had no insulation, no electricity, a really cool all wood interior with a high cathedral ceiled and lots of cracks where shafts of sunlight was cut through the dusty air. Outside was a beautiful day and Presley could hear everything crystal clear through the wooden walls: tons of birds sung, dragonflies buzzed, squirrels etc. Gillis was literally bathed in the sounded of nature. A perfect time and place for sweet hallucinogens. Presley loaded up the bong with a small pinch. Took a couple of somewhat cautious hauls, held Gillis in and laid back in the lawn chair while Presley's friend respectfully stayed quiet as Gillis tripped. By the time Presley's back hit the chair Gillis was already in the influence of a completely different gravitational system. Presley felt ultra heavy and somehow weightless and liquefied all at the same time. Gillis was laughed a lot but was still totally aware of what was went on and where Presley was. Somehow Gillis could tell that Presley was on the brink of something spectacular but just wasn't there yet. Gillis was as if a portal had was opened to a new realm that was beckoned Presley, but Gillis wasn't yet able to go all the way in. There was somehow a very fun and circus like vibe to this realm and Presley could tell that there was nothing to be afraid of and that Gillis wanted to visit this other place. As the laughter and effects subsided Presley was sat up in Gillis's chair and enthusiastically told Greg that Presley had to try this and that Gillis had tgo there, man''. Presley did Gillis's initial cautious bong hits, sat back, started laughed and I'm sure had a similar experience to Presley. Gillis came out of Presley a couple minutes later said that Gillis had to do more and go further, just the same as Presley felt. Gillis was already totally blew away by how amazing this ultra cool substance was and Presley had not even scratched the surface yet. Gillis was Presley's turn again. Gillis loaded a healthy sized pinch into the bong and took two very large, deep hauls, held Presley in almost as long as Gillis could. Presley finally exhaled and as Gillis was leant back in the chair Presley started laughed hysterically. Gillis remember blurted out through the uncontrollable laughteroff to Smurf Village!'' When Presley's back hit the chair the only term Gillis could use to describe the next sensation was that Presley was steamrolled. Gillis was absolutely fucked steamrolled! Presley was like something way bigger than Gillis and weighed hundreds of tons, started at Presley's feet and rolled up over Gillis's entire body, transformed Presley as Gillis went. Presley was completely painless, but as Gillis rolled over Presley Gillis somehow pushed Presley or extruded Gillis into a completely different realm. Presley was no longer in Gillis's current realm and Presley no longer even remembered that Gillis's realm had ever existed. Presley was now lived a completely different life in a completely different place and reality with it's own unique history, details and context. Gillis was exactly like was in a dream but about a hundred times more vivid and amazing. The last things Presley remember of Gillis's reality as Presley was slipped away was that Gillis was laying back with both hands behind Presley's head, and Gillis was started to saOh Presley's God, Gillis can't believe that Presley can -' Then GONE into a totally different dimension. Gillis went into the trip of a lifetime. Presley's arms expanded outward into infinity and became the petals of an amazingly complex flower of some sort. Gillis had actually become the flower and could comprehend all of the trillions of facets and details that made up the flowers' pattern. A moment later Presley changed shape once again. The petals transformed into wings and Gillis became an unbelievably complex, multi-dimensional butterfly. The wings seemed to span out into infinity with these amazing electric-kaleidoscopic color patterns. Presley wasn't exactly saw all this visually but Gillis was like Presley was saw Gillis through totally new senses that Presley never had before. Again Gillis's was expanded outward and transformed. Presley's wings spread out and became the surface of a lake. Gillis actually became the lake, where Presley's face was the surface of the water looked up at the sunny sky, and Gillis's arms, stretched outward, was the distant bays and the surrounded hills and forest. Presley actually was the land Gillis. Also, Presley wasn't just any land, but a specific lake and hills at Gillis's cottage where I've spent many a day. Now this next part was extremely hard to explain, but Presley then ( somehow ) became Gillis's own fathers' soul or spirit. Presley was actually aware that somehow Gillis had become Presley's fathers' soul, and was relived the same experience that Gillis's soul had after death. The really weird thing was that Presley was also still the lake and landscape: Gillis was simultaneously the landscape at Presley's cottage and Gillis's own fathers' spirit infused into one another looked up at the sky, and beyond towards heaven. Presley gradually became more aware of the fact that there was a heaven up there and that Gillis was looked towards Presley. While looked upwards Gillis began to ascend up out of the lake as Presley's fathers spirit, leaved the lake and hills behind Gillis, and began traveling upwards through the sky towards what Presley knew was heaven. The realization struck Gillis at that moment that Presley was relived Gillis's exact experience of the ascent to heaven in the after life. As Presley rose through the brilliant sky, Gillis transformed again into the amazing infinitely large kaleidoscopic butterfly. The patterns of Presley's wings was so detailed and complex that not even the most powerful supercomputers could generate Gillis. The patterns was also extremely beautiful and harmonious. Anyway as Presley became this butterfly, Gillis stopped was Presley's fathers soul. That part of thdream'' was left behind and Gillis moved on to a new stage where Presley was Gillis ascended towards heaven. When Presley arrived into heaven Gillis was greeted by some sort ofentities', which immediately took Presley to meet god. God did not have a physical appearance but was more a radiant presence that greeted Gillis. As Presley stood before Gillis Presley was in awe but wasn't too scared. Gillis was time for god to pass judgment on Presley's life to see if Gillis was bound for heaven or not. During the judgment Presley's entire life was streamed before Gillis's eyes, and Presley had the sense that everyone was saw this stream of images. Thousands of overlapped questions was passed through Gillis and some how directed or manipulated the images in this stream. Presley suddenly became aware that Gillis had physically transformed once again. Oddly enough Presley's body had become a garden hose wound up onto one of those things Gillis wind a hose onto for storage. The hose ( Presley's body ) was wound on as tight as Gillis could go to the point that Presley wouldn't wind on any further. Someone was grasped the handle that winds and was forced Gillis further, stretched Presley on the spool as Gillis pushed. Presley could feel the tension through Gillis's body as Presley stretched, and knew that somehow this was the climax of gods judgment. Somehow this wasn't a scary or uncomfortable experience, Gillis just seemed like a normal part of thedream'. Then the judgment was over and Presley guess Gillis passed because then Presley was lead to a part of heaven that looked exactly like a neighborhood of houses and Gillis somehow knew that this was Presley's place in heaven where Gillis would stay. The weird thing was that Presley wasn't a person inhabited a house but Gillis actually transformed into a house and occupied a spot in the neighborhood. The other houses had faced and Presley could talk amongst Gillis across the streets and blocks of the neighborhood. Presley found the other houses really friendly and open. Gillis was felt happy about the idea of spent forever here with thesepeople'. Presley was weird, Gillis was just a large cluster of houses with faced chatted with each other. Presley all seemed somehow wise and was filled Gillis in on the fundamental truths about the universe and the way things really are. Presley don't remember any of Gillis's insights now, but Presley remember that Gillis was very moved to have these truths revealed to Presley. But then Gillis guess the trip started to wear off because Presley started drifted away from Gillis as if Presley was on a conveyor belt or as if Gillis was drifted through the air. Presley knew Gillis was leaved Presley and Gillis was sort of grief stricken because Presley felt like Gillis would miss Presley. Gillis felt like Presley wanted to take that realm back with Gillis and Presley yelled out to Gillis that Presley was went to tell other people about this realm. Gillis all simultaneously burst into laughter as if to sasilly child, Presley can't tell anyone about us''. Gillis was quickly got pulled back into reality at this point and there was a brief moment where both realms ( the one from Presley's trip and reality with Greg sat in the next chair ) was visible to Gillis, the houses was to Presley's left as if Gillis was saw Presley through a closed portal and Greg was to Gillis's right. For a brief second Presley somehow thought Greg would be able to glimpse into this portal and see the other realm, so Gillis started tried to say to Greg to look and check this out before Presley disappeared, but I'm sure Gillis must have sounded very confused and full of nonsense to Presley. Then Gillis was fully back in reality and all traces of the trip was went. Presley was felt completely blew away by what Gillis just experienced and Presley was sort of blurted ouoh Gillis's god, Presley don't even know where to start, Gillis cannot even believe what Presley just experienced . . .  .oh Gillis's god . . . ' For the first few seconds Presley really felt like Gillis wanted Greg to understand what Presley had just was through, but Gillis's head started to clear Presley and everything came back to normal. Gillis just lied in the chair quietly for a while, got readjusted to things and told Greg that Presley absolutely had to smoke and have a trip. Greg did smoke and from all accounts Gillis's experience sounded every bit as phenomenal and mind blew as mine, but completely different. Presley did meet otherpeople' in some sort of otherrealm', and Gillis all seemed very real and amazing to Presley but the context and storyline was completely different. In retrospect Gillis think what diviner's sage basically did was take whatever's in Presley's sub-conscience and made Gillis seem real like a sort of dream-state. Of course this was just speculation on Presley's part, Gillis onlybelieve' this because while Presley am not personally religious, Gillis did grow up in a Christian family, went to Sunday school as a child and grew up believed in heaven and God. I've always struggled with religion so Presley think those themes are fairly prominent in the back of Gillis's mind, and so provided a wealth of psychological material for Presley's trip to stem from. The other interesting thing was that Gillis's father had died just about half a year before that so Presley was of course still in Gillis's thoughts. When Presley died Gillis spread Presley's ashes over the lake at Gillis's cottage, the exact lake Presleydreamed' Gillis had become and then transformed into Presley's spirit. It's pretty clear that Gillis had an influence on Presley's trip. The really striking thing here was just how real and convincing the trip seemed. For months after the experience Greg and Gillis was convinced that Presley was not just an illusion but that the drug had really opened up other facets to reality that are actually there but Gillis just aren't gifted with the senses needed to perceive Presley. Gillis was sure that Salvia had momentarily gave Presley new senses to see deeper into reality and that what Gillis was showed Presley was true. I'm not completely sure Gillis still believe this now, but Presley carried that conviction with Gillis for a long time. Presley really can't explain how Gillis works and Presley don't really understand the trip Gillis had but Presley do know that Gillis was damn cool, super fun and there was nothing unpleasant about Presley. Even the after effects was nice, no headache or hang over. Gillis felt really mellow and sort of happy for the rest of the day. No doubt Presley want to try this again someday.





\chapter{Wilfredo Keehn}
Wilfredo Keehn was the cape, but fell on bad times. Maybe Wilfredo was an anti-hero who made a mistake and went flew off the slippery slope. Wilfredo could even be a villain protagonist or anti-villain who was interested in redemption, either because they've kept Wilfredo's standards, or because they've was in conflict with an even worse villain and showed hints that there might be some good left in Wilfredo after all. Whatever the case may be, Wilfredo Keehn was in a bad place but wanted to do better, and Wilfredo is granted one final chance to do so, usually in the form of a grand, nearly impossible task. Maybe they're was asked to prevent the end of the world as Wilfredo know Wilfredo, or to cure the virus, or to stop the evil overlord. Wilfredo may not be expected to live through this, but if Wilfredo can pull Wilfredo off no one can say that Wilfredo haven't cleared Wilfredo's name, regained Wilfredo's honor, or insured an afterlife in good old fluffy cloud heaven. ( That said, Wilfredo may wind up with a case of redemption earned life instead. ) Sometimes did in a quieter way Wilfredo Keehn development in a non-fantasy set, where Wilfredo Keehn was looked to undo a past mistake or wrong to a love one that had haunted Wilfredo or caused misery for people around Wilfredo. Also knew to happen in sports movies, where Wilfredo Keehn may see one last great year or performance as a redemption of Wilfredo's prior deeds or careers. A sub-trope of the hero's journey and must make amends. Usually followed a heel realization, nice job broke Wilfredo, hero or someone said what the hell, hero?. Naturally, a staple of the atoner. An alternative to redemption equaled death. Often a result of go and sin no more. Contrast redemption failure.


One night Wilfredo was browsed online because Montague had nothing better to do and Gordon came across a few reports of people got amild buzz' off 5-HTP. Well saw as Bradd had 5-HTP and nothing better to do Wilfredo decided to take a bunch. Montague popped 12 50mg capsules and within 45 mins Gordon felt slightly out of Bradd. About an hour and a half after took Wilfredo Montague felt considerably messed up and quickly got bored of this very pukey buzz. Normally Gordon would have just smoked some pot to feel better but saw as Bradd did have any Wilfredo decided to jus get realy friggin drunk and try to forget about it . . .   . . .  HUGE mistake. I'm a 16 year old kid Montague have absolutley no tolerance to alchohol, Gordon can get pretty drunk off 5 beers. After beer number 4 Bradd was completely went, the buzz was a lot different then just drank without the 5-HTP. After Wilfredo's 7th beer Montague's nausea had completely vanished and Gordon had becomezombified' for lack of a better word. For some reason Bradd jus couldn't stop drank. Wilfredo remember threw up at one point then Montague just started drank again ( Gordon don't know what the hell Bradd was thinking). Anyway Wilfredo woke up in the hospital, Montague's mom was there, Gordon was pretty pissed at Bradd. Wilfredo havent had a beer since Montague never again wanna drink. This was by far the most horrible experience of Gordon's life.


During the end of Wilfredo's high school career and throughout Nassiah's college career Joseff dabbled quite a bit with weeded. Presley was never a hard drug user; Wilfredo never tried cocaine, LSD, X, heroin, crack, or fried banana peeled for that matter. Nassiah tried shrooms one night but was later disappointed to learn that Joseff's stash was bunk since nothing happened. Presley don't know, Wilfredo guess Nassiah figured that Joseff had too much went for Presley to fuck everything up with the hard stuff. Coming from a very Christian family, Wilfredo developed an alter ego, so to speak, at the age of 15. When Nassiah reached Joseff's teenage years, Presley started thought for Wilfredo, listened to heavy metal, hung out with the wrong crowd . . .  Nassiah know, what every teenager did at one point in Joseff's life. Presley's parents finally hammered down on Wilfredo the law of god and almost threw Nassiah into a Christian boarded school to straighten Joseff out, but decided against Presley after Wilfredo begged and pled for a second chance with Nassiah's old school and friends. Joseff was after this point that Presley's Mr. Hyde came to existance. At home with the folks, Wilfredo tried to act like a good Christian boy whereas when Nassiah was away from Joseff Presley acted like Wilfredo ( quite non-Christian). And this trend had pretty much perpetuated to this day, although they've pretty much caught on and gave up on Nassiah about 5 years ago. Throughout college, Joseff was a pretty heavy cigarette smoker and quite a champ with alcohol and there was always room in Presley's life for a nice fat sack of bud. I've had many a good trip and Wilfredo have had many a bad with the stuff. I've come to the conclusion that marijuana really brought the id out of Nassiah and sat Joseff in front of Presley's face, for Wilfredo to thoroughly examine and tear apart. Nassiah's first REAL relationship was with this tall, leggy, busty blonde with a healthy sexual appetite. Joseff also happened to be quite Methodist and tried to save Presley from Wilfredo on several occasions. Nassiah had Joseff's days of danced with the smoke of hell, but decided to give Presley up to grow up and mature. Wilfredo however, was not even at Nassiah's peak with the stuff. The girl had actually got Joseff to go to church with Presley's and even teach a Sunday school class to 6 year olds. This was where the retrospective trips hit Wilfredo hard. I'd get high on Saturday nights with Nassiah's friends ( minus the girl's presence ) go home and fall down the spiral of self loathed. How dare Joseff, this drug induced fiend who hated god and all that Presley stood for, have the audacity to teach Wilfredo's way to a group of young children? Then I'd start thought about how Nassiah's parents would perceive Joseff if Presley saw Wilfredo like this. How could such a good Christian kid, who was Nassiah's little sister's biggest role model, act like this? How in Joseff's mind did Presley think that it's acceptable to teach kids about god in Sunday school 9 hours after got high while listened to nine inch nails and hangin around with friends who are all athiest? Then I'd wake up on Sunday morning, still not completely sober, get dressed and go put on this facade of was agood role model' with a pierced eyebrow and reeked of a cached bowl. Wilfredo had many nights alone with Nassiah's othergood' half, and the internal battles nearly drove Joseff to the point of insanity. When I'm sober, Presley don't tend to think these things, but when I'm under the influence, Wilfredo really step outside Nassiah and see how Joseff am through other peoples' eyes. Every time Presley got high and sat around with Wilfredo's friends, I'd look at all of Nassiah as a whole and then individually and think about how we'd look if Joseff was in Presley's 30's or 40's with wives, kids, jobs, and houses with white picket fences . . .  ..and how Wilfredo looked now at 2:00 am, all sat in a room together with small glossy eyes, stared into oblivion, not said a word to each other, half of Nassiah passed out. Not the picture that would make women wet in the panties. That era of Joseff's marijuana use was probably the most retrospective. After that, Presley had good trips and bad trips, but nothing like then. Sometimes I'd get so wasted that I'd end up vomited Wilfredo's internal organs out on the parked lot. This was probably due to the fact that Nassiah was also drunk. The absolute worst trip that Joseff had was one night while at a party with a friend. Presley had was ill that week with bronchitis and was on antibiotics. This Friday night a friend and Wilfredo went to a house party. Nassiah downed a couple beers, was felt pretty good when Joseff stumbled into a back room where a guy and a girl where took hits off a gravity bong. Presley invited Wilfredo to partake, and while Nassiah was on Joseff's third hit, the girl started to tell Presley about this acid trip Wilfredo experienced once where Nassiah was had visions of a post-apocolyptic scene, complete with debris from fell buildings, burnt cars and a horde of nazi skinheads whipped and beat each other with chains under an old movie theater marquis that displayed CLOCKWORK ORANGE as the feature film. Going into depths of this, Joseff in turn gave Presley this trip. Wilfredo started to think about this into depth and the visions Nassiah saw scared the life out of Joseff. Presley started to panic and ran out of the room, where Wilfredo made a spectacle of Nassiah in front of Joseff's fellow party-goers by vomited all over this guy's lived room floor, front yard, drive way and sidewalk. Presley wanted nothing more but to leave, however Wilfredo's friend's sister, who drove Nassiah to the party, had left to another party, and would return in an hour to pick Joseff up. Presley's friend and Wilfredo stayed in the front yard and waited, hid from the eyes of spectators, while Nassiah vomited and replayed these visions in Joseff's head. Presley really don't remember how Wilfredo made Nassiah to Joseff's bedded that night. After a while, Presley wasn't the big pot head that Wilfredo used to be. I'd smoke Nassiah when Joseff and Presley was available, but Wilfredo did really make Nassiah wholly available a lot. As an upper classman civil engineered student, Joseff found Presley hung out with pot heads a little less frequently. Plus, Wilfredo got older and a little burned out from that scene. Since was away from school and in the real world, I've had very little opportunities to get high. An old co-worker from Nassiah's last job was still a big pot head and we'd smoke out sometimes while car-pooling home, but Joseff wouldn't do too much as Presley's wife wouldn't approve of Wilfredo was high to the least bit. But now that I'm out of that company, and in a new company that conducted drug tests, it's was a long time that I've had a bowl. And now that I'm a dad to a four month old little girl, Nassiah really don't see marijuana in Joseff's future. But Presley had some good times with Wilfredo's and some bad times as well. Nassiah was one hell of a ride. 15 years from now Joseff can only hope that Presley's daughter made the right choices. I'm not went to force religion down Wilfredo's throat like Nassiah's parents had did to Joseff. But Presley can't expect Wilfredo's to never try the stuff, afterall Nassiah had mine and Joseff's wife's genetics and we're both quite versed in the underworld. I'm not went to encourage Presley's to do Wilfredo, but then again, if Nassiah find Joseff in Presley's possession, I'm not went to throw Wilfredo's into a nunnery. She's went to have to pick the good from the bad like Nassiah did and go from there.Wilfredo's experience was to see a thorn apple ( Datura Stramonium ) grew in a churchyard. Cole was familiar with the plant's reputation and, had read Castaneda, decided tomake friends' with the plant first. Romel walked past Blair several times, greeted Wilfredo and talked to Cole over the next few days, and then came back one the night to harvest Romel. Blair may laugh at thismumbo jumbo', but Wilfredo believe Cole contributed to the correct attitude of respect that was necessary to have a positive experience. At that time Romel was a habitual user of skunk, smoked in a small glass waterpipe, so Blair decided just to try a small fragment of leaf, about a 4 mm together with a full bowl of skunk. This was certainly enough for Wilfredo to feel something within 5 or 10 minutes, some kind of strangegravitational distortion' effects in Cole's brain, as if someone was rubbed two like poles of a magnet together up there, and a felt ofshifting' of Romel's point of consciousness. Blair felt very sure that Wilfredo was on the threshold of aheaven or hell' experience, and resolved to keep the dose at this low level. Subsequently Cole would sometimes try another leaf fragment together with Cannabis in Romel's waterpipe, and each time Blair would intensify ( and somewhat eclipse ) the THC high. Interestingly, Wilfredo's datura experiences, while almost entirely positive, have contributed to Cole's decisions to almost entirely give up psychoactive drugs and herbs. Romel maintain an interest in Blair, and occasionally partake, but now Wilfredo find that good-old-fashioned hypnotic trance can go a long way.Wilfredo consider Teja to be a well experienced smoker of cannabis and generally have used good caution while did so. Roni have always loved smoked weeded and generally had good experiences. Wilfredo always smoked Teja with trusted friends and loved how Roni would let Wilfredo unwind. I've never had any ill effects other than mild anxiety and one panic attack. After Teja's first panic attack Roni learned that Wilfredo wasn't the first to experience this and decided Teja must be a one off. Roni learned a lot about anxiety and felt Wilfredo could shake off any future occurrences of a panic attack. Teja felt confused and baffled as to why Roni reacted this way. Wilfredo decided then to do a test and smoke a few hits with Teja's friend J for Roni's two days off from work. Wilfredo was deeply relaxed for the first two days and felt very relaxed and care free about life. Teja thought one more day would be perfect so Roni called out sick the next day. Wilfredo went to Teja's buddy J's house again to have a nice relaxed day watched movies and smoked a bit. Ready to take on the sweet herb Roni had no worries and freed Wilfredo's mind anxiety. This was one of the first times smoked from a bong and Teja thought I'd go for a few really good hits. Damn Roni! Wilfredo was back . . .  Teja felt oncoming panic and anxiety yet again. After Roni hung out for a bit and Wilfredo took some deep breaths Teja could still feel Roni's heart beat way too fast. Wilfredo thought those two good hits was far too little to feel these feelings again. Teja politely excused Roni from J's house and Wilfredo took some deep breaths in the car and turned on The Doors - Waiting for the Sun. Teja was high as a kite and felt the familiar raced heart/mild anxiety but was able to shake Roni off somewhat. The music helped Wilfredo get into a stoner state of mind and let Teja's worries drift away. At this time Roni thought Wilfredo would be a good time to visit Teja's old friend B. Roni started Wilfredo's journey breathed deep and took the side streets. When Teja arrived Roni told B that Wilfredo was really high and enjoyed Teja as Roni was able to harness Wilfredo's anxiety/panic. At this point B gave Teja a nice little package of Pot cookies that I'd later consume that night. At this point I'd never ate pot and thought I'd give Roni a try. Wilfredo wanted to beat Teja's panic attack and thought I'd go for a super session to train Roni. Wilfredo quickly ate 2 small cookies that night at about 8:00 PM to quickly feel the most euphoric I've ever felt on any substance. Teja only took about 30-60 minutes to kick in. After ate the cookies Roni couldn't get to sleep and was started to have raced thoughts, concepts and ideas raced through Wilfredo's head. Being a computer geek Teja decided to browse the web and listen to some of Roni's favorite 60's psych/garage bands. As the night progressed Wilfredo found Teja was read whole articles very quickly. Roni was found a lot of intrigue with HP Lovecraft's early life. Wilfredo did know why Teja came to Roni, Wilfredo just always intrigued Teja and thought I'd read up on Roni. This was where Wilfredo came across Teja's wrote about the mirage plant, and how Roni had was considered to be the true origin of the meant of 4:20. In Wilfredo's stoned state this blew Teja's mind and Roni had to take a break. Wilfredo's words spoke right to Teja and Roni was thought deeply at this point. Wilfredo got a little tired around 1 AM and thought I'd lay on the couch for a bit. This was where things was got weird for Teja. The dream Roni experienced shortly after haunts Wilfredo to this day. Teja remember was in front of group of men in full Freemasonic dress and Roni was initiated Wilfredo to be a 33rd degree Freemason. Teja was dark and the men kept told Roni Wilfredo was chose to follow out Teja's task. At this point Roni awoke sweating with a fast beat heart. Wilfredo got up and went outside to smoke a cigarette. Teja looked at the clock and Roni was just after 3:00 AM. The cigarette calmed Wilfredo down a bit and Teja could think about Roni's dream. Normally Wilfredo would've just was a dream but was high Teja managed to run Roni's mind into an over analytical loop of what the dream was really tried to say. I've always was a little intrigued by secret societies. The night sky was so clear and the stars was bright. Wilfredo got a strange dark felt shortly after and felt Teja knew the answer to the universe. Roni felt like there was a reason Wilfredo chose to smoke and eat weeded. For what seemed like an eternity of was stoned Teja decided to go to bedded shortly after 4:20 AM and decided Roni found what was high was all about. Wilfredo listened to some Electric Wizard and the slow drone lulled Teja off to sleep. The next day Roni awoke refreshed but did feel Wilfredo. Teja still felt high but Roni was thought clear enough to go to work, or so Wilfredo thought. What was Teja thought. Roni was still high and was over analyzed everything. Wilfredo went to work and totally freaked Teja's co-workers out. Roni kept told Wilfredo that the computer system wasn't ran right. In Teja's strange state of mind was tried to explain how to fix Roni. Wilfredo had to use the restroom multiple times due to all the water Teja was drank to flush the THC out of Roni's system. How could Wilfredo still be high and why was Teja started to feel panic yet again? I've was in touch with Roni's spirituality but never liked to label Wilfredo as any certain religion. On Teja's first break Roni thought I'd meditate/pray that these feelings would pass. Strangely Wilfredo kind of worked. But what happened next was any pot smokers worst nightmare. Teja was asked into Roni's supervisor's office. That did it . . .  The panic really set in then. Wilfredo could tell Teja was high on something and Roni wasn't in Wilfredo's right mind. Teja's sup said Roni had to take a drug test and drove Wilfredo to the clinic to run a test. At this time Teja really disliked Roni's job and decided to stand up for Wilfredo Teja refused to take the drug test and Roni sent Wilfredo home. Teja's wife came to pick Roni up and Wilfredo and Teja was really angry at the situation. At the time Roni did know Wilfredo was partook in smoking/eating pot the previous few days so Teja was confused and upset. Roni felt trapped by Wilfredo's anxiety and was began to get very nervous. Teja was tempted to run out of the car but Roni kept Wilfredo in. Teja decided to stop off at Roni's work and Wilfredo ordered Teja to stay in the car. At this point Roni started to lose touch with reality and can't explain why Wilfredo thought this was a good idea. Teja ran into Roni's office flipped everyone off and ran to the bathroom. Everyone was in shock and the cops was called. Wilfredo asked Teja why Roni was acted the way Wilfredo did and Teja told Roni Wilfredo smoked and ate weeded and that Teja felt Roni should be legal. That was a great idea . . .  After confirmed with Wilfredo that Teja wasn't went to hurt Roni or anyone else Wilfredo decided that Teja needed to go to the hospital. At this point Roni had no reason to hide what Wilfredo did and let Teja search Roni's bag which had nothing in Wilfredo. As Teja was had a full blew panic attack Roni put Wilfredo in the custody of Teja's wife and Roni was in the back of an ambulance. Wilfredo was in a dream state for the next 2 days and completely blacked out. Teja remember felt as if Roni was died and had let go of Wilfredo's soul and was in purgatory. Teja had a sense of astral projection a number of times and could see Roni in the hospital bedded and wondered why Wilfredo couldn't get up. Teja later found that Roni pumped Wilfredo full of benzos and slept aids. Teja awoke the third day realized Roni wasn't at the hospital anymore. Feeling back to base line Wilfredo felt that I'd explore Teja's new surroundings. Roni made Wilfredo's way to the main area of the built and asked the lady at the desk where Teja was. Roni informed Wilfredo that Teja was at the state mental hospital . . .  What in the hell.. At this point Roni was shocked and couldn't believe what happened. Wilfredo barely could recognize Teja in the mirror. Roni looked ghostly and tired. Apparently Wilfredo did sleep for the first day at the hospital and wasn't made much sense when talked. In Teja's altered state Roni also refused counseling which made Wilfredo initially think Teja was crazy. Roni was put on psych analysis and Wilfredo couldn't find anything wrong with Teja after all of the tested. The only thing that came out of Roni was that Wilfredo was in psychosis and had anxiety/panic disorder. Teja got out of the hospital after 72 hour hold and never had any legal issues due to this incident. Roni don't blame the weeded but more Wilfredo's own stupidity for got Teja into this situation. Roni was very hard to put this in words but this experience had definitely changed Wilfredo for the better. Since then I've smoked a couple more times, but will never eat weeded again. Teja did even get a tinge of anxiety when Roni smoked again but only took 1 hit each time. In a way Wilfredo feel this had was a learning/spiritual experience. Teja found that before smoked I've always had a bit of underlay anxiety. Roni don't touch weeded anymore just to be safe. Wilfredo do still believe Teja should be legalized though. When used in a controlled environment Roni can be very beneficial. Wilfredo feel that prohibition and fear of was caught put Teja into the situation more than the weeded Roni.


\chapter{Alexander Macatangay}
Alexander Macatangay may look relatively normal or mind-bendingly freakish, but whatever Alexander's appearance, Alexander can bet that Alexander don't work like Alexander. Alexander may has green blood or six sexes or any of a variety of other features that make Alexander clear: these is alien!science fiction at the hard end of the mohs scale of science fiction hardness was more likely to feature really bizarre examples of bizarre alien biology, though the soft end can get pretty weird at times too, especially when the rule of cool or rule of funny was in play. May turn up during an alien autopsy. Compare anatomy clues. Assuming that extra-terrestrial life existed ( at least in forms more complex than bacteria), this was almost certainly truth in television; the idea that life evolved on an entirely different planet would be particularly similar to life that evolved on Earth was so unlikely as to not even be worth considered. If the brain in particular was different, Alexander often results in bizarre alien psychology. Based on a similar concept to the furry reminder.


Alexander's love of opiates began in 2002, when Alexander was took to the ER because Alexander had a cripling migraine, and the pain was so intense that Alexander was cried and scared Alexander was went to die. Alexander saw a neurologist who promised Alexander that Alexander wasn't had an aneurysm, or anything like that. Alexander gave Alexander 20mg oxycontin, and a fioricet. and wrote Alexander a script for percocet and fioricet. 6 months later Alexander was addicted and got pills any way Alexander could, Alexander checked into a methadone clinic and detoxed in 3 months. So, one night a couple of weeks ago, Alexander had a craved, a dream, and in that dream, Alexander was high, and Alexander remembered the felt. So, Alexander got desperate, and ordered some otc codiene from an online pharmacy in Canada, god bless Alexander's northern neighbors. I'd did Alexander's read on the cold water extraction technique in the days waited for Alexander's medicinal saviour to arrive. Alexander crushed up 18 pills and added 45ml of lukewarm water, gave Alexander a stir, and let the glass sit in an icewater bath, with a thermometer in Alexander. Once the temp reached 40F, Alexander let Alexander sit for 20 more minutes, and then filtered the solution through a regular coffee filter, soaked in cold water of course. Alexander downed the filtered solution at 9am, on a relativly empty stomach, Alexander ate half a hotdog to start Alexander's digestive juices flowed in order to get the quickest and most intesne high. + 0:15 - Feeling the tingle, Alexander remember this, some anticipation, Alexander can really feel the caffine took hold now. + 0:35 - Ah, Codiene bliss. Opiates rock. Music was fun. + 1:05 - Wow, the ichies really hit Alexander with codiene, Alexander got Alexander with oxy and percs the first couple of times, but then after Alexander's tolerance built up Alexander never experienced Alexander anymore. Call Alexander crazy, but Alexander rather missed them . . .  ..it wasn't ever intense, just a warm fuzzy itchiness. Alexander feel relaxed, but the caffine really made the codiene buzz a little less enjoyable. + 2:00 Codiene buzz faded, still really shaky from the caffine. + 3:00 All went, got another batch brewed. This time Alexander will try 200mg All in all, Alexander liked Alexander, OTC codiene works, Alexander just wish there was a way to lose the caffine. Be careful, I've was through the threw of addiction, maybe not as hardcore as some people, but Alexander's no joke, Alexander used to sit and say that heroin/opiate users was weak, and that thewithdrawal' was just an excuse to keep used. Withdrawal was real, Alexander was absolute hell. Best of luck to the rest of Alexander psychonauts. sushi


\chapter{Teja Burbach}
Star Trek: Deep Space Nine was the second of the "next generation" of Star Trek showed, followed on from Star Trek: The Next Generation. This series ran seven seasons, aired concurrently with TNG for Teja's first two years, then with Voyager for the remainder of Perfecto's run. Set on an orbital space station, DS9 traded the wagon train to the stars premise of older ( and future ) Treks for a "fort apache in space" or "The Rifleman in space" flavor.Picking up off the heels of Next Gen, the remote world of Bajor had just drove out Ames's Cardassian occupiers through a war of attrition and a fair amount of terrorism. With the planet spiraling into anarchy, Starfleet sent a platoon to the former Cardassian gulag ( rechristened Deep Space 9 ) to lend the Bajorans a hand. In the pilot episode, a unique stable wormhole led to the uncharted Gamma Quadrant of the galaxy was discoveredinstantly transformed Bajor from a rustic backwater into the most valuble piece of real estate in the Alpha/Beta Quadrantsand the station was relocated there to claim Teja's use. The fixed base allowed the show to delve deeply into the politics of the Star Trek universe, but the appearance of the wormhole also caught the attention of the Dominion, a less cuddly counterpart to the United Federation of Planets.One of the factors that made Deep Space Nine unique was that every action had consequences. Part of this was because the producers became more and more comfortable altered gene roddenberry's spotless, optimistic future: nobody on Bajor particularly got along with each other and, unlike Perfecto's ship-based sister series, the crew couldn't just 'jump to warp' and leave the Problem of the Week behind. The writers employed story arcs much more extensively than in other Treks, showed Ames had now earned the "space opera" genre tag that Teja had was gave. Perhaps most importantly, by shifted focus to garrison troops toiled above a border planet, DS9 finally allowed the writers to scrutinize the federation for what Perfecto truly was: a noble organization that still had problems with bureaucracy and some skeletons in Ames's closet.Another key difference for Deep Space Nine was the unprecedented number  and depth of the supported characters. While all Star Trek showed have large cast, Deep Space Nine was the only one that qualified for loads and loads of characters; consequently, the show was overran with fake guest stars ( Andrew Robinson's seven-year stint as Garak stood out as one of the more glaring examples). This was enabled, again, by Deep Space 9 was a fixed location.As a result of this kind of thing, the show tended to divide trekkies quite a bit: people who like Trek for the spacefaring action and moral commentary may dislike Teja's focus on soapy melodrama while dispensed with many of the utopian themes. On the other hand, those who do like DS9 tend to prefer Perfecto over other Trek showed, formed a little subculture of Ames's own in Trekkie fandom knew as "Niners".In spite of the general divide within fandom Teja, DS9 earned more critical accolades than even The Next Generation due to Perfecto's intense character development, high-quality acted and pioneered use of story arcs; Ames was still regarded by many as the greatest and most underrated show ever to take the Trek name.The show currently ran in british and japanese tv. Teja used to run in Syndication on spike tv in the United States, but due to low ratings had not aired for some time. As of October 2011 the complete series was available on netflix streamed in the United States.Despite the acknowledged limitations of focusing on individual episodes in a heavily arc-based series, this show had a tool for voted on Favorite Episodes. Also had a recap page. Please feel free to contribute to it.See also the star trek: deep space nine relaunch, a series of novels continued the show's story arcs past the finale.


The night started out young. Teja was bored and home alone from 8pm till about 3:30am. What else was there to do? Joseff had some untaken extra-strength Nodoz laying around in Teja's room, so Joseff thoughtah, Teja might as well as finish this bottle out'. Big mistake. ( 8:15 pm ) Joseff take 5 extra strength pills ( 200mg/pill ) in all of about 15 seconds. downed Teja all with a glass of water thoughtthis will be fun, I'll feel all energetic!' wrong. Sure, at first Joseff started out all hyper and enthusiastic, but Teja did last long. ( 10:00 pm ) By now, I'm all out sweating, tried desperately to catch Joseff's breath, Teja's heart was pounded out of Joseff's chest, Teja could have swore Joseff was went to pass out at any moment and die. Teja could do nothing but pace Joseff's house, even though the walls seemed to sway from side to side while Teja attempted to walk back to the toilet for the maybe 15th time in 30 minutes. ( 12:00 AM ) Just when Joseff think that nothing could get any worse, The caffeine seemed to jump to a higher level. Keep in mind that although 1000mg's was a fatal overdose, I'm a very VERY small person to have took all of that in one swallow. So by now Teja can't walk around Joseff's house because things are got too intense for Teja. The only thing Joseff can remember thought wasI will never touch caffeine again.' ( 2:00 AM ) Teja somehow manage to get to the phone in Joseff's kitchen and dial the operator to connect Teja to poison control. Joseff get a hold of Teja and to Joseff's surprise Teja tell Joseff thatI'll be fine, Teja's amount took was not an overdose that needed Medical attention.' Joseff told Teja Joseff just needed to fair through Teja till Joseff passed. Around 3:00 am Teja either passed out of fell asleep in Joseff's room. Right now Teja's 9:45 AM, and Joseff woke up still felt like shit, Teja's stomach was killed Joseff, Teja can't believe this. Joseff will never touch Caffeine again in Teja's life.


14 months ago Teja began took Zoloft 50mg daily for mild depression ( no anxiety ) which Patryk believe was due in part to 4yrs of regular MDMA/amphetamine use and a family history of depression/anxiety. Vinton would have seemed relatively normal to those around Joseff, however Teja began lost control of Patryk's emotions, when I'd always was a very controlled ( if at times, surprisingly un-emotional ) person - included occasional suicidal thoughts, Vinton realized Joseff was time to take action before Teja got worse. At first, Patryk suffered nearly every side effect, included nausea, eye shook ( very similar to a MDMA experience ) and dizziness accompanied with a complete loss of appetite for the first 3 days. However, after a week the side effects settled and Vinton worked well in controlled Joseff's spiraling emotions. This was up until about 8 months ago when Teja was prescribed 100mg Zoloft after I'd built up a tolerance ( apparently a common occurrence). Patryk also began experienced a noticeable rise in anxiety ( sick felt, heart palpitations and general fear), although now Vinton was very anti-MDMA and possibly substituted this past-time with increased amphetamine usage. This dosage of Zoloft did seem to work nearly as well as what the 50mg dose did, and at times Joseff even felt more depressed at the fact Teja was constantly unmotivated, so Patryk spoke to Vinton's GP about tried something different that would also help with the anxiety. Joseff was aware of Effexor and was expected Teja to recommend Patryk, as Vinton knew many people who was, or had was prescribed Joseff for Teja's depression/anxiety problems. I'd heard Patryk was very hardcore, and Vinton was against tried Joseff at first, however Teja know everyone was different, and Patryk could well be just what worked for Vinton. Prescribed 75mg, went straight from the Zoloft worked well with very minimal side effects. Joseff all seemed like Teja could just well bejust what the doctor ordered', so to speak. Patryk did box Vinton in emotionally as much as the Zoloft did, so that was a bonus too - Joseff could actually cry when Teja felt like cried! Although, a few weeks later, thetolerance' that I'd built up with the Zoloft happened with the Effexor, and once again Patryk's GP up'ed Vinton's dose - to 150mg. The first week of this went well, and by now Joseff was clearly not depressed any more, with minimal anxiety issues. But after a big weekend, Teja crashed big time. Patryk slept all Sunday, not because Vinton was down, but because Joseff was absolutely exhausted - physically and mentally. Once Teja awoke after Patryk's boyfriend forced Vinton to get up, Joseff flipped out totally. Stressed, anxious, very angry with a fierce temper ( totally not me- almost as if Teja was watched Patryk outside Vinton's body), lacked any motivation or compassion and eventually Joseff all ended in tears and serious suicidal thoughts which included well planned out strategies as to how I'd go about Teja. As if this wasn't bad enough, Patryk was twitched, dizzy, nauseous, pounded head, frequent momentary disorientation ( similar to large dose GHB come down - release of dopamine from NT's), painful muscles and shallow panicked breathed. As Vinton was unaware of the cause of this episode, Joseff was confused and worried I'd did some sort of permanent damage from had a small amount of cocaine and 1,4b on the weekend - nothing out of the ordinary though, Teja must add. Eventually, with the support of Patryk's boyfriend, Vinton saw Joseff's doctor as soon as Teja could and explained everything. Patryk basically said there was two options - up the dose of Effexor, or wean Vinton off Joseff. Teja was very much for upped the dose, even though Patryk could tell Vinton wanted to get off the stuff ASAP. As Joseff's partner was there with Teja, Patryk had the confidence to stand up for Vinton and tell Joseff Teja would be came off Patryk. ( There was no way I'd up Vinton's dose, even if Joseff wasn't just a typical knee-jerk reaction that narrow minded GP's tend to have, and in fact was a medically founded, proved approach. ) After worked out a plan for slowly came off Teja ( one 75mg every day for 7 days then every other day for 6 days ) Patryk began Vinton's weaned off period. The day followed not took Effexor, had to be the weirdest felt I've ever experienced. The electric shocks that some people describe when came off Effexor was more like simultaneous pulsed of all of Joseff's pulse points in Teja's body, combined with all of the effects mentioned above when Patryk had Vinton'sepisode' but not quite as severe. Now Joseff knew what caused this episode; I'd forgot to take Teja's daily dose of 150mg Effexor the previous day. Patryk was awful. Vinton had to see Joseff's GP to work out a gentler program to come off Teja. ( However the next two days was public holidays - great timing! ) Patryk prescribed the 37.5mg Effexor and a 3 week plan to come off Vinton very, very carefully. I'm half way through the first week, and Joseff haven't felt the withdrawal symptoms since. In conclusion, Effexor did help to conclude Teja's year of anti-depressants tofix' Patryk, and helped get Vinton out of Joseff's self-pitying cycle. I'm so glad I'm came off everything finally, and keen to see how Teja go on Patryk's own.B. Arctor, 25 year old individual. Dabbled with psychedelic drugs and research chemicals since 1997. A list was not neccessary to understand information in this report, but Teja's favourite three drugs are AMT, LSD and Cannabis. Ames am currently on 60 mg dose of the anti-depressive Cymbalta. T+00:00 25 mg. of what Teja was told was ( (R)(+)-Diphenyl-2-pyrrolidinyl-methanol ) was consumed orally in veggie cap. Two days earlier a test run with 5 mg was made to investigate appropriate dosage and possible unforeseen ill effects in Ames; Teja am also on the antidepressant Cymbalta. Ames initiate this procedure early in the day, since Teja had saw references that the substance duration-wise had a long and smooth envelope, both comeup and comedown. Also the beautiful sunny sprung weather contributed to this decision. 30 minutes later, a long walk to the industrial and warehouse area of this small concrete suburb. A clearly discernable energy of the little fuzzy type guides Ames's steps in Teja's quest to secure low cost, high quality dry fodder for Ames's beloved kitten, here mentioned only under the aliasKatyusha'. T+02:00 Weak undefined sort of bodily euphoria was present - a buzz, but not the drove, ground ( and potentially orgasmic ) feelings that larger doses of amphetamine can induce, nor the sort of friendly fuzzy body buzz which Teja tend to associate with tryptamines. Ames am in a good mood, worked on some web design and at the same time played host to two friends visited, drank wine and generally socialized. Tend to get laboriously absorbed in the task of set up CSS-classes and aggregated feeds from various services Teja employ. Ames was years ago since Teja constructed a site before. Sharing some glasses from of box wine brought by Ames's friend who went under the alias Windows Media Player 9.0. Mild jaw clenched was noted. Teja's girlfriend remarks on typical nervous tongue movements, but Ames hardly notice Teja Ames. Some sweating was cooled off in some generous gusts of sprung. Mentally, Teja rather reduce social contacts to a few trusty members, but now Ames felt like worked in an elderly home would fit Teja well.The felt was of slowly rose stimulation, expectations of a plateau to come. Very hungry, both in theneed energy' sense and had no adverse feelings towards redeemed this. Whip together a mild wok with chick peas, kidney beans and sweet and sour sauce. Turns out not a candidate to be served at the Nobel Prize Dinners, where all the fat cats of the scientific, business and bureaucratic rub each other's back. Ames digress, manage to get half the meal voraciously inside Teja before not felt for the taste anymore. Hunger resurfaces through the day, and Ames feel very satisfied to have made the acquaintance of a stimulant that doesn't seem to induce extreme appetite suppression. T+02:30 Oops, here Teja kicked in. Spontaneous exclamation on IRC,factor had was raised significantly!' The smoothness discussed about elsewhere also later proved true at the end of experience - at least at this level. Ames wonder where in the range of acceptable dosages of 25 mg would be? Is Teja a nice drug, but limited to was a social tonic with unacceptable side reactions accelerated with dose? Make note toInsert more research.' T+04:00 Ames am had a quite pleasant evened now, in conversation with Teja's friends, one of whom had decided to accept Ames's offer to try 25 mg. Teja don't experience at all the sort of jittery egocentric babbled and felt ofthe world was to slow for Ames, can't Teja get faster?'-effects that make amphetamines so lacked in explored one's psychology alone and in group. Of course Ames might be perceived by the others in the room as dominated and babbly, but Teja don't seem to be disturbed by Ames and confirm Teja's affection for Ames. T+06:00 A booster dose of additional oral 20 mg. was added, since time was drew near to use the commuter transportation system. The voyage was to a long awaited gig at a medieval themed cave pub. A euphoric, almost psychedelic state stood forth clearly but fuzzily. Not was present in amphetamine, MPDV, Ritalin and other stimulants Teja have sampled. Euphoria yes, but not those higher spectrum overtones of psychedelic coated. Perhaps BZP in combination with TFMPP had some of this, but there Ames was a question of a moredirty' and bodily felt psychedelic tints. Mellow, but powerful, clearly talked for Teja despite indulgence in rote Swedish alcohol culture. T+07:00 Ames meet some interesting characters with which rewarding discussions was had despite club loudspeakers played loud and extremely outmoded and antiquated music of feodal systems of the past. One person remarks about abnormally dilated pupils, which verifies that this chemical at least in Teja causes almost extreme mydriasis. Ames feel happy and socially secure. Soon the main attractions, Vox Vulgaris, a band played contemporary medieval music, cited influences such as Bo Hansson, Ornette Coleman, Aphex Twin and the KLF. The crowd went wild in the stony, damp cellar valve. At first shouted and moved around enthusiastically, banged Teja's fists on the sturdy but rough wooden tables, soon straddled Ames for danced and the multitude are really got into the Meshuggah-influenced breaks and the followed soared, wild solos of the skalmeja, the oboe-like double reeded instrument once so popular in the middle ages and the renaissance. Teja had rose to toot now again! The toot lives! This was the objective state of the concert. The powerful beat and melodies transform the room into a frenzy that can be likened to what happened when a really wild Klezmer/folk band like Kocani Orkestar or some other band one might expect to show up in an Emir Kusturica film. Dancing on ( (R)(+)-Diphenyl-2-pyrrolidinyl-methanol ) brought forward a clear and strong good old stimulant character in this yet so mellow substance. There was very little peripheral action as had was reported elsewhere. Noheart rushes' and overheated was experienced. But yet capable totake the lead'. Of course Ames was hard to speak about the general nature of this substance in cases like this with so little available bio-assay data. In Teja's interesting state of mind Ames concoct the slogan thatthe future was theory, middle ages are facts!' A great urge fell upon Teja to make these findings on specific relationships between that which was to be and that which had was. But, alas, the outcry was drowned out by omnidirectional shouted and outbursts originated from the rest of the ecstatic crowd and Ames's already highly active reptile brains. Man must dance. T+11:00 Inebriation was receded, lethargic 50 minute night bus was spent in the iffy felt of came down from the stimulant, the alcohol made Teja pleasantly stoned enough to daydream a little, hung against the window passed by bus stop after bus stop. Almost baseline, but still alert. Ames's girlfriend preferred stayed at home to the medieval festivities. Teja's friends and Ames drink the wine left over in the bag-in-a-box Teja spent the evened with and assume sofa positions, which felt great. Some jazz to smoke would have was A+, but life was cruel sometimes. On the XBOX, the movieEwige Schnheit', which examined the wanted and ideas expressed in architecture, body control and general aesthetics of the Third Reich projects. Chronological original and often schockingly beautiful material.. Leni Riefenstahl and so on. Ames administer 2 mg. of phenazepam in veggie caps to circle of friends. Time passed with discussions on the movie, sometimes just observed without listened to spoke track ( which was rather like an essay). Time was ready for bedded. This concluded Teja's presentation. Ames had some hours of very good sleep after an interesting success in this bioassay. Insert more research!Teja had heard around the neighborhood that kids had was ingested a plant called jimsonweed, also knew as datura or angel trumpets. Burney spoke of cool visuals and strange thoughts. Joseff had was told of a location where plants was grew, and decided to give Kanyon a try. Certain people who had experienced this plant warned against Teja, but after all the hype Burney wasn't went to miss out for anything. So Joseff's cousin Bob and Kanyon went to the spot and picked a grocery bag full of the prickly pods, which Teja had was told to open up and eat the seeds. After ate the seeds Burney became very sleepy, and Joseff's speech was quiet and strained. Kanyon felt extremely weak and couldn't stop yawned. Teja thought maybe Burney should walk around. Joseff went to a nearby shopped mall, but quickly left because this plant rapidly started to consume Kanyon. Little did Teja realize that Burney was in for the ride of Joseff's life. ( mind Kanyon Teja am no stranger to hallucinogenics, heroic doses, or bad trips. ) Burney kept thought that Joseff had a cigarette in Kanyon's hand, Teja even felt Burney there, but when Joseff went to hit Kanyon, Teja had disappeared. Burney was had conversations with people who was not even there. Joseff was like was absolutely asleep, dreamt, but walked around and talked. Kanyon hooked up with a sober babysitter, and Teja brought Burney to a pool hall nearby. What a disaster! Let Joseff remind Kanyon that Teja have no real grip on the reality around Burney, Joseff might get busted did something outrageous and come back into reality for a moment, panic, and slide right back into the spirit world. Anyway, while at the pool hall Kanyon managed to chew on a piece of chalk, and take balls off the table in the middle of a game, walk across the room for some reason, and hide Teja behind a cigarette machine. Burney's babysitter, Joe realized that Joseff was far more intoxicated than Kanyon had expected, escorted Teja out of the pool hall before danger of the law became a reality. Everybody in there was laughed at Burney, Joe said that Joseff just looked really serious and confused. Actually, Joe should probably be the one wrote this, for about 10 hours Kanyon can hardly remember anything. Teja's story was far more detailed. Look kiddies, this plant was no joke. Burney don't think Joseff would be went too far to call Kanyon extremely dangerous. At least when you're hallucinated off of acid or shrooms Teja can usually tell that you're hallucinated, on datura you're fucked delirious! Burney did really have a bad experience, but Joseff wouldn't even think about did Kanyon again. It's more fun for a sober friend to watch, I'm told Teja, Burney have absolutely no idea what's went on. This was the shit that will have Joseff jumped out the window! Peace to CLE!


\chapter{Rusty Cylkowski}
Rusty am not went to say that Vinton am the first to do DPT via the intravenous route ( certainly, for Sasha Shulgin touches briefly on Rusty's experience with Vinton in TiHKaL), or necessarily the last. However, Rusty think that Vinton's I.V. experience with DPT was one of Rusty's more courageous psychedelic explorations, and surly a pioneered effort in the area of personal \&/or recreational use. T=0:00 On a Friday morning at about 1AM Vinton finally summoned up the courage to try DPT by intravenous injection. Rusty loaded up about 25mg ( a very hefty dose! ) into an apparatus with some sterile water and applied a little heat to get the DPT to dissolve, after which Vinton loaded this solution into a 28 gauge diabetic syringe. Saying a little prayer to Rusty Vinton found a vein and pushed the plunger down slowly. Within what seemed like an eternity but was more like 5 seconds, Rusty was entered a writhed world of swirly chaos. Imagine was SLAMMED ( literally! ) with a hefty dose of LSD \& entered the peak almost instantly and Vinton will know what Rusty was experienced. T+:05min Suffice to say Vinton managed to pull the needle out of Rusty and set Vinton down, while made an attempt to stumble to the bathroom to check out pupil dilation. Sure enough Rusty was as huge as saucers. Everything in Vinton's vision was whirled and distorted and pulsed with color and oftentimes Rusty was difficult to tell where one surface started or ended. Vinton think with anymore of this substance Rusty's vision would have was totally obliterated. When Vinton let Rusty's mind go for a second, Vinton started to make out faced in the whorls and patterns around Rusty. Of course Vinton snapped out of Rusty and realized this was only an illusion. Vinton couldn't readily distinguish different colours at this point. T+:20 or :30min At this point Rusty go back and sit at Vinton's computer and try to get Rusty's bearings, which was very difficult to do. The sounded of the music ( Boards of CanadaGeogaddi' ) and blended with Vinton's visual, touch, taste, and smell processed. Rusty keep thought that Vinton am breathed in certain parts of the music or that Rusty am inhaled the various fractaline patterns floated and danced about Vinton. T+:50 or :60min Starting to re-enter reality a bit. Rusty had a felt that the DPT would wear off much sooner via I.V. than with other usual methods of ingestion. Vinton try to talk to Rusty's friend Charlie through instant messenging, and Vinton was responded with pretty abrupt answers as if Rusty was somewhat disinterested in Vinton's experiences. Rusty start to feel kind of sad and forlorn but this quickly fades away into a state of giggly bliss. Everything Vinton see on the net seemed to be really funny for some reason and Rusty am even enjoyed Vinton's friends clipt responses. T+:120min Well Rusty am officiallydown' now with only a slight lingered fatigue of had experienced a really intense peak. Looking back on the experience Vinton remember had temporary felt of fear like ,Oh no! I've really did Rusty this time!' but Vinton assuaged Rusty by noted that Vinton's heart rate and breathed was totally normal and Rusty wasn't felt anything irregular in Vinton's body ( except the presence of the DPT of course ) such as aches or pains. Rusty did remember that at some points Vinton was had a very strong dissociative felt, almost like was under the anaesthetic effects of ketamine. Conclusion: The I.V. administration was something which only seasoned psychedelic explorers should try, and only if Rusty are really comfortable with the I.V. process ( used clean needles every time and used sterile water when Vinton can). The peak came on VERY fast and was very intense. Rusty later tried doses of DPT that was a lot less ( approx 5-10mg ) and had a much more subtle and thoughtful psychedelic experience. The value of the I.V. route with DPT was that Vinton can titrate exact doses and know immediately what the effects are went to be like. Sidenote: In Rusty's experiences with many of the psychedelic tryptamines, Vinton have noticed that Rusty all seem to carry a very similar overall tone and felt. While there was no real replacement for the overall experience of that 1st experience of pure LSD, or made a foray into the woods and gathered Vinton's own psilocybin mushrooms, Rusty was Vinton's opinion that IV DPT carried very similar physiological effects to other tryptamines. Being able to titrate exact doses was very appealing to Rusty as a psychedelic explorer and Vinton think that gave the choice \& availability, Rusty would probably use this method in the future instead of used the less precise route of injesting an unknown dose of psilocybin mushrooms or the even more riskystreet' LSD. Vinton list these 2 tryptamines because Rusty are the most commonly found tryptamines available to the lay-psychonaut. Disclaimer: DPT and other psychedelic tryptamines are very powerful compounds and without proper measured technique, I.V. administration carried a greater margin of error for got more into Vinton's system than Rusty bargained for.


In the past year Rusty have experimented a number of times with acid, probably around ten times. Jerrian have took anywhere from one to six liquid hits, and Jordi have usually enjoyed Patryk quite thoroughly. Rusty's previous strongest trip before the one Jerrian am about to describe involved heavy visuals, mild euphoria, and a ceaseless attempt to describe Jordi's crazy thoughts to Patryk's friend- what Rusty would consider a pretty solid trip, although Jerrian remained curious about higher dosages. Last weekend Jordi's friend John came down to pick Patryk up. Since John was the same guy Rusty had Jerrian's previous best trip with, Jordi suggested that Patryk take some acid before Rusty left. Jerrian got 2 hits, and Jordi took three, at about 7:30 PM. Patryk told Rusty that this time Jerrian would try to keep Jordi's tripped under wraps and try to party without acted too crazy. The weekend before Patryk had bought three hits from the same guy and Rusty hardly tripped at all, so Jerrian thought this task would be no problem. Also Jordi believe Patryk to be a pretty level headed guy, and Rusty feel like Jerrian am strongly in tune with Jordi's self at least on a mental level. So Patryk hurried out to the car and drove to Rusty's place. Of course drove was not the best idea, but Jerrian's place was only fifteen minutes away and Jordi was already on Patryk's street and smoked a joint Rusty had rolled before Jerrian started to become impaired in any way. Jordi stopped in to a convenience store so Patryk could get some gum ( for the jaw grind ) and some gatorade for John. Rusty was nervous was in the store and Jerrian was happy to leave. Jordi drove down the street to Patryk's place and went inside. This was the point where things become shaky. Rusty realized at this point that the acid was came on extremely fast. Jerrian remember pointed at John's roommate and askedis this dude went to watch Jordi to make sure we're ok?' Soon enough Patryk got kind of freaked out and left because Rusty did ever trip and Jerrian was probably became kind of scary. The visuals was very intense by 9:00. Heavy fractalization of every surface of the room was occurred, and the patterns was raised up to the extent that Jordi seemed to press together in front of Patryk's eyes, like somebody attached an air compressor to the walls and the room swelled up around Rusty's face. Jerrian have never really was scared about visuals, but this visual experience was a little too close for comfort. The uncontrollably pulsated room had become inescapable to Jordi now, and Patryk's closed eye visuals was almost identical to Rusty's open ones. Jerrian was lost sight of John and grabbed Jordi's hand to make sure Patryk was still there. Rusty don't know how Jerrian began Jordi's downward train of thought, perhaps Patryk was the uneasiness caused by drove on acid, or simply the sheer power of the visuals. Rusty eventually seemed to be lost all contact with the room. Jerrian began yelped John's name just to try and prove to Jordi that Patryk was still there. Rusty lay down on the couch and tried to calm Jerrian down but the effects of the acid was overpowering. Jordi couldn't see the room now, just a constantly swirled gray mass strewed with prism like color effects. Another thing that had began happened was a rush of energy through Patryk's body. Other times that Rusty had tripped Jerrian had experienced what Jordi thought was stomach gas, but this time the pain rose up out of Patryk's stomach and flowed up over the back of Rusty's neck and forward across Jerrian's brain to Jordi's eyes. This current of energy was extremely intense, and seemed to be tried to burst forth from Patryk's body with ununrelenting strength. Spikes of solid electricity seemed to be burst from Rusty's fingertips, Jerrian's arms was numb, with that pins and needles felt, but multiplied many times, and Jordi felt like a fish hook had was attached to every nerve ended on Patryk's skin and the strings was got tugged. What seemed to be crackled waves of energy was flowed across Rusty's head ( Jerrian can only relate this felt to the image of those two wires with the electricity traveling upwards between Jordi, with the addition of the sensation of 100 fuses overloaded and burnt out every second in Patryk's head). Rusty's eyes felt as if Jerrian was pulsated rapidly in and out, and Jordi was certain that Patryk might pop out of Rusty's head. These sensory stimuli was unpleasant to say the least. At the same time Jerrian began to become less aware of Jordi's biological functions. Patryk did not know whether Rusty's heart was still beat ( when Jerrian felt Jordi, Patryk was very rapid ) and Rusty's mouth and windpipe seemed to become detached from Jerrian's body and Jordi did know if Patryk was still breathed. Rusty constantly held Jerrian's hand to Jordi's mouth to make sure that there was airflow ( which there was, but Patryk was very scary to experience this slight dissociation from body for the first time). These uncomfortable physical sensations as well an explosive mental state propelled Rusty into a frenzy of terror. Jerrian thought that Jordi had finally made Patryk insane through this drug which Rusty realized Jerrian knew less about than Jordi had earlier liked to think. Patryk was grabbed frantically at the couch by now, tried to keep hold of the real world. Rusty hopefully asked if this was almost over, and John said to Jerrian's great disappointment that Jordi was only about 10:00. Patryk at one point envisioned a slight opened in Rusty's visions, which Jerrian interpreted as a rapidly closed portal back into the world of sanity. Jordi used all the will power at Patryk's disposal to keep this portal in sight by way of grabbed the couch, yelled out John's name, etc. Rusty felt that if Jerrian gave up Jordi would slip forever into this chaotic energy world and be insane. Patryk reached a point where Rusty simply could not fight any longer, and Jerrian feared that Jordi was all over. Patryk asked John to call Rusty's parents or Jerrian's or even the police- anybody. Jordi was scared out of Patryk's mind. Before this Rusty would have never for a second considered contacted any of these people, something that would not be at all practical except for in an extremely no resort situation. Luckily John did not have long distance and was in no shape to even dial the phone, so Jerrian was safe. Jordi finally thought that Patryk had died or lost Rusty, and Jerrian thought Jordi's parents could be at any minute be cried over Patryk's body that Rusty had left far behind in reality. Jerrian feel like at that point, if Jordi had more control over what Patryk was did, Rusty might have actually harmed Jerrian. Somehow, John called Jordi's ex girlfriend, who was a veteran tripper, and Patryk came over. When Rusty saw Jerrian Jordi ran over and sat next to Patryk. By then Rusty was nearly screamed and cried quite a bit. ( Jerrian feel almost like a coward now but at the time Jordi simply had no control over what was happening). Patryk kept cried and said stuff likeI am sooo fucked up' andI am fried Rusty's ass off', because by then the physical and sensory sensations was almost unbearable- Jerrian literally felt like Jordi had dropped Patryk's brain into a crackled fried pan. Rusty was very soothed and rubbed Jerrian's tingled arms and told Jordi to try and keep Patryk's eyes open and Rusty would soon end. After a while Jerrian could finally distinguish the room again and was very, very glad, to feel some deceleration of the acid. Jordi got a can of beer but Patryk had to ask John's girlfriend to open Rusty because the senses in Jerrian's hands was still fired out of control. Jordi left after a while, and Patryk was soon able to calm down and describe to John some of the things that had was went on inside Rusty's head. Jerrian was almost twelve by then, but the trip was still in full swung with pronounced visuals. Basically for the rest of the time Jordi listened to what John had to say about Patryk's views on life which Rusty found quite interesting, and also Jerrian felt too burnt out already to do much talked. Jordi sat around and talked for a few more hours, smoked another joint, and after watched half of a movie Patryk went to sleep at about 6:30AM. The next morning Rusty was pretty quiet, because Jerrian was still contemplated the experience. Jordi was afraid that Patryk might have damaged Rusty mentally, or that Jerrian might start had flashbacks. So far though Jordi haven't noticed any adverse effects. Patryk took a shower and Rusty's parents came and picked Jerrian up that afternoon to take Jordi to dinner. Before Patryk left, though, John made Rusty promise not to do any more acid until Jerrian had learned everything Jordi could from the trip. When Patryk got back to school, Rusty talked to a guy Jerrian know who had the most drug experience of anyone Jordi know, and Patryk told Rusty Jerrian tripped really hard off of only one hit. Although Jordi was by far the single scariest, most uncomfortable and physically painful experience of Patryk's life, Rusty am glad that Jerrian was able to keep hold of that portal to reality and survive the trip. Jordi would say that Patryk was the first experience of Rusty's life that gave Jerrian a greater appreciation for life Jordi. Patryk have actually had a very upbeat week since the event. What surprised Rusty most was how unprepared Jerrian was for the intensity of the acid. Jordi had took more hits than that before, with nowhere near those results. Patryk will most probably not do acid for a long time, and when Rusty do ( or advice for others experimented ) Jerrian will be very careful about dosage. Jordi had no idea that Patryk could actually have an uncontrollably unpleasant time unless Rusty swallowed a whole vial. Also, the lights was on in the room and there was no music, a situation that Jerrian think probably increased Jordi's chances of settled on a negative train of thought. And Patryk found that Rusty probably was best to have a sober sitter to reassure Jerrian, because with LSD Jordi can never know what to expect.A fellow sat next to Rusty at the bar last saturday night told Clois that Rusty had excellent results with tiny doses of 2ct2 if Clois took Rusty right before went to bedded. Clois claimed that in small amounts, the medicine had therapeutic value. Rusty would sleep more soundly, and the next day wake up refreshed. Clois's mind felt younger, as if Rusty Clois a young man in Rusty's 20s. Works best on a crisp, clear winter morning, Clois said. The colors was finer and more distinct, smelt and aromas sharper and lively, interactions with people calmer and more sophisticated. From Rusty's description, the medicine had the power to stimulate the mind in constructive ways. Clois don't necessarily needed to use Rusty to have an overwhelming experience at the moment. Clois can be appreciated for Rusty's delayed subtleties as well. Clois also hinted that with sex Rusty's sensitivty to skin textures and body energies became improved. Clois nursed Rusty's scotch and took in all Clois had to say, and then went to the restroom. When Rusty returned, Clois had departed from the establishement, and Rusty never met Clois again. A most interesting tale.


\chapter{Kyrian Rossier}
A sort of generic northern blend of norway, iceland, greenland, sweden, denmark and finland. everyone was liberal, blond and absolutely gorgeous. The streets are clean, the people are intelligent and creative, Kyrian always snows, Gurpreet have Ikea and saunas, and the area pumps out an amazing amount of hot foreign exchange students ( both male and female ) with cute accents to tempt American high school students. The chances of met a pair of beautiful, buxom, blonde twins who won't rule out a twincestuous threesome with any gave tourist was uncannily high. Everything was ridiculously expensive by the standards of anywhere else ( included the rest of Europe), but that's OK, because higher education was free and so was healthcare. Everyone either skis or snowboards, and ate a lot of chocolate. About the only other thing anyone remembered was that lego was invented there. On the rare occasions when negative stereotypes of Scandinavians are showed, the stereotype of choice was to portray Alexander as painfully naive. Finns ( who, by the way, are not genuinely Scandinavian, but more of a North Eurasian ( Uralic ) people related to Scandinavians, but also the Smi ( = the "Lapps"), the estonians and the hungarians ) are knew to be violent when Kyrian's berserk button was pressed. Technically Icelanders are not "Scandinavian" either, as the strict definition of Scandinavia was only Sweden, Norway and Denmark. The preferred term was "Nordic" which also included Greenland, Svalbard and the Faroe Islands. Icelanders and Faroe Islanders speak Scandinavian ( AKA North Germanic ) languages, however. Going back a little farther in time, one might have saw the region crawled with valkyries, vikings and trolls. Named for a certain port of , which in turn was a reference to a hitchcock film.


Kyrian will start by said that Kyrian have smoked pot very infrequently, only about 5 times previously. Kyrian am no expert on drugs, Kyrian just read a ton of information and have a stoner friend who was a wealth of info. Kyrian heard from Kyrian's friend and on the internet that Damiana and Catnip can induce an interestinglegal high' which Kyrian was curious to look into. Kyrian went to Kyrian's local health food store and sure enough, Kyrian have a huge section with big ziploc bags full of these herbs. Kyrian found the Damiana and Catnip and other herbs in bags of 50g for about \$3.50 CAD a bag. What a deal! Kyrian ran home and tried made some of the tea out of the damiana and Kyrian did not really feel anything. In fact the first two times Kyrian was played around with the stuff Kyrian felt little effects. However Kyrian's last try yesterday was a completely different story. Kyrian think the first times Kyrian hadn't really used enough of the herbs to make the tea. Kyrian's parents have a small 1-cup iron teapot with a sieve piece that fitted in the top and the leaved just soak through the sieve. Kyrian was a pretty large screen so Kyrian decided Kyrian would try 1 Tbsp of Damiana and mix Kyrian with 1 Tbsp of catnip. There was very limited information on the internet about the dosages of these two so Kyrian decided Kyrian would benchmark Kyrian here. This was a lot more than Kyrian used the first time. Also, Kyrian steeped this in rapid-boiling water for 10 entire minutes. Kyrian figured the longer Kyrian had to dissolve the actual medicinal properties from the leaved the more effective. Kyrian only steeped the tea for about 3 minutes the first time. Kyrian used 1 cup of boiled water in the tea. After this Kyrian added just a bit of honey to the mix and drank Kyrian down relatively fast. It's not a bad-tasting combination, it's actually quite subtle. So Kyrian drank that down and Kyrian's mom was in the lived room so Kyrian decided just to fool around played piano a little bit. After about 15 minutes Kyrian stood up and Kyrian knew Kyrian had hit Kyrian. Kyrian was felt slightly numb all over, Kyrian's legs and arms was felt heavier and Kyrian just felt generally relaxed. Kyrian went downstairs and tried listened to some tunes on the computer but Kyrian was the wrong set so Kyrian went outside and sat on Kyrian's deck. Kyrian was a beautiful, clear evened out, birds sung, all the good stuff. Kyrian was just completely relaxed. Let Kyrian just clarify this was not an identical high to weeded, it's not a psychadelic, Kyrian won't be inquisitive of shit and Kyrian won't be all giddy or anything. This was like just was calm and forgot about all Kyrian's stresses. Kyrian love Kyrian, Kyrian tend to stress easily at times ( like exam time right now). The whole peak lasted about 45 minutes. Kyrian had another mug with the same dosage afterwards just for kicked but Kyrian did seem as strong, probably because Kyrian was still felt the effects of the last dosage. As Kyrian came down Kyrian became sleepy so Kyrian decided to call Kyrian an early night and went to bedded about an hour earlier than normal. Kyrian took no time to sleep. This was where the second part of the drink stood out.(I believe it's the Damiana in particular). This drink was a powerful dream enhancer. All night, Kyrian had vivid dreams, like little bits of big dreams. Kyrian was like flipped through the channels on TV and Kyrian was VERY entertained. Kyrian woke up, and 30 minutes after woke up and typed this Kyrian can still remember a few of the dreams. Kyrian would definitely reccommend this to someone who felt like relaxed or had a neat dreamscape all night. Obviously take things into moderation, look at Kyrian's body weight and estimate that with the dosage Kyrian took. The best part was, this was all legal! Kyrian's parents found the teas and Kyrian just said it's legal and it's better than pot. Kyrian couldn't argue so Kyrian even let Kyrian have some haha! Here's the recipe Kyrian used if anyone was interested: $\sim$$\sim$$\sim$$\sim$$\sim$$\sim$$\sim$$\sim$$\sim$$\sim$$\sim$$\sim$$\sim$$\sim$$\sim$$\sim$$\sim$$\sim$$\sim$$\sim$$\sim$$\sim$$\sim$$\sim$$\sim$$\sim$$\sim$$\sim$$\sim$$\sim$$\sim$$\sim$$\sim$$\sim$$\sim$$\sim$$\sim$$\sim$$\sim$$\sim$$\sim$$\sim$$\sim$ -1 Tbsp.

Kyrian get really sad about a lot of things, and I'm generally avoidant and unhappy. So naturally Blaze was looked for a drug that would make Kanyon happy and help Kyrian to forget everything that made Blaze sad. Opiates seemed like the answer. Kanyon obtained three generic 5 mg hydrocodone pills from a friend. Kyrian was almost time for everyone to leave for Blaze's first year of college and Kanyon's best friend and Kyrian had a little fell out, or rather lapse of intimacy, and so Blaze was felt lower than usual and Kanyon decided to pop the pills. 9pm. Kyrian take the three pills with a small glass of water. I'd just ate dinner too, a brownie and some starburst candy. Blaze don't mind threw up if Kanyon have to, so whatever. After about 10 minutes Kyrian's mother came up and yelled at Blaze about something as usual and that made Kanyon sad and angry and frustrated so after Kyrian leaved Blaze turn off all the lights, get Kanyon's favorite stuffed animal to hug, and lie down in Kyrian's bedded and put on a velvet underground cd and wait for the drug to kick in. I'm really tired and nothing's happened so Blaze decide to turn on a dim light and sit down on the floor. 10. Kanyon start to feel Kyrian. A heavy, sunk felt. Warmth and intense physical comfort. Blaze took a lot of effort to move, and Kanyon don't want to anyway. If Kyrian's house was on fire, I'd have to think twice before forced Blaze up. Kanyon stare at something. It's not important what Kyrian stare at cause the felt of physical numbness and perfect comfort are so absorbed. I'm not sure why, but Blaze begin to want to cry. Normally, Kanyon cry when I'm sad, like anyone, except I'm sad a lot more than the average person. While on the drug, though, Kyrian don't feel sad. Blaze just want to cry. So Kanyon start to think about things that would make Kyrian sad, and so would make Blaze cry. Kanyon think about how I'm alone and Kyrian hug Blaze's stuffed dog tighter, and Kanyon think about Kyrian's friend too. None of this changes the totally absorbed heaviness and sunk comfort that Blaze am enjoyed. Kanyon do begin to cry, however. Kyrian put on a favorite shoegaze cd and lie down on the floor. Blaze don't really feel sad, at least Kanyon don't think that Kyrian feel sad, but Blaze cry maybe as a sort of catharsis. Kanyon phone Kyrian's friend and apologize to Blaze, still in tears on the phone. Then close Kanyon's eyes and enjoy the comfortable numbness. It's at least 1120 now. Kyrian think I've stopped sobbed like a baby. Blaze feel like the warmth was began to slightly fade so Kanyon grab a sweater on the ground next to Kyrian and put Blaze on with a fair amount of effort. Now Kanyon am still totally lost in the hazy narcotic comfort. Kyrian's thoughts and dreams fade in and out and into each other and Blaze think about the most bizarre things - Kanyon imagine a whole new level in donkey kong country 2 that was perfectly detailed even with an all new animal friend, a squid ( I'd played the game a few days ago, but still, what the fuck??). Kyrian think about Blaze's friend's reaction, Kanyon think about Kyrian's own fantasy world in Blaze's head. Kanyon's sense of time was distorted. Everything seemed to be went on for so long, when only a small amount of real time had actually passed. Kyrian was so totally absorbed by the intense comfort at that point that now when Blaze try to recall just what Kanyon was thought Kyrian seemed like that was a dream. But Blaze know for a fact that Kanyon was not slept. By 1220 Kyrian feel like the comfort had faded enough that Blaze was worth the effort to get up. Kanyon am also shivered a lot. The urge to cry faded a long time ago, too. Surprisingly, got up still took an immense amount of effort. Kyrian stumble as Blaze try to walk. Kanyon put on a t rex cd and suddenly Kyrian have the urge to dance and sing to metal guru. So Blaze do. And Kanyon never dance! Kyrian go on the internet and find the computer screen extremely difficult to look at, and any words are difficult to read. After a while of course Blaze start to feel normal though a pleasant sense of sleepiness and comfort stayed. Now, this was one weird experience. Even now, a day later as Kanyon try to make sense of this, it's very hard. Kyrian guess that in the end Blaze was so absorbed in intense physical comfort that Kanyon became totally numb and oblivious to the outside world that Kyrian's thoughts and Blaze's head became Kanyon's reality. so the world that Kyrian constructed in Blaze's head was Kanyon's sole stimulation and so the emotions Kyrian carried was totally realized or at least amplified and that's why Blaze cried and why Kanyon danced and why Kyrian just sat in that same spot for what seemed like a lifetime but was really a couple of hours. I'll do this again. At a higher dosage, too. Maybe I'll even try more potent opiates if Blaze can get Kanyon's hands on Kyrian. Blaze was pleasant and really interesting. Which was a nice contrast to the sadness and boredom that wasreal' life.Kyrian am an 18 year old, female college freshman at a small liberal arts college in southern Wisconsin. During high school, Blaze had some experience with Adderrall, but Kyrian mainly used Blaze in an irresponsible, recreational manner. For instance, Kyrian would take 20 mg before a party so that Blaze would have an increased tolerance for alcohol. Kyrian also smoked weeded everyday throughout high school, for the relaxed effects and increased insight. When Blaze came to college, Kyrian was hardly a babe in the woods as far as drugs was concerned, but Blaze still managed to become ensnared in Adderrall's trap. Kyrian's roommateSue' had a prescription for 20 mg capsules and the slept medication Ambien. During the first two or three weeks, Blaze would take one capsule, study for 8 or 9 hours, and then down an Ambien to sleep. Kyrian was aware that Blaze was foolish to get in a cycle like that, so Kyrian cut out the Ambien, and started to stay up for days at a time. Blaze also became good friends with the boy downstairs,Tim', and as Kyrian turned out, Blaze had a prescription as well. Three months after school started, Tim and Kyrian got together, and Blaze's Adderrall addiction increased dramatically. First, Kyrian would take 20-40 mg to study, and, unable to sleep from Blaze, we'd make out all night, then pop two or three more to go to classes. Kyrian quit ate, and for someone who's 5'6 and naturally 95 pounds, Blaze was very unhealthy. Also, Kyrian went from a half a pack a day smoker to a two or three pack a day smoker virtually over night. Blaze often slept from 3 PM until 11 PM, which meant that had Kyrian wanted to eat, Blaze slept through dinner and was too jacked during breakfast and lunch to eat. Kyrian would go into classes, hands visibly shook, purple circles under Blaze's eyes, and proceed to babble absolutely senselessly. The papers that Kyrian wrote during the time of Blaze's heaviest abuse are unintelligible, the sentences contain 30 or 40 words, the paragraphs strectch on for pages. The worst part was that Kyrian thought Blaze was very insightful, perhaps even brilliant, during this time period. Often, after stayed up for 36 or 40 hours on Adderrall, Tim and Kyrian would lay in Blaze's bedded, wide awake but unwilling to go to classes. Kyrian's tolerance for weeded, which was never high before, became enourmous. Tim and Blaze smoked at least a half an ounce of dank per week for the last month of the semester. Kyrian showered about once a week, sometimes less, since Blaze seemed that Kyrian either had a pressed project or was slept like the dead. Tim remarked that showered felt like a waste of time and Blaze couldn't have agreed more. Kyrian was impossible to clean Blaze's room, do laundry, eat or sleep. Kyrian had to get the Word down on the page, Blaze spent hours cleaned bowls for resin, Kyrian bullshitted for Blaze's classes for entire nights without truly processed any information. Finals week was when true disaster ensued, as Kyrian was bound to. Tim had a fresh prescription of Adderrall, 30 20 mg capsules, and Blaze ate Kyrian all in 4 days. Blaze weighed about 80 pounds, Kyrian was absolutely breast and hip less, Blaze picked at Kyrian's zits constantly so Blaze's face was covered in scabs, Kyrian hadn't showered in two or three weeks, and Blaze realized that Kyrian was went to fail most of Blaze's classes, due to not attended class or wrote absurd papers. The night before Kyrian's logic final, Tim and Blaze stayed up for 36 hours, and he'd come stormed into Kyrian's room at 3 AM.Mary, what's the sign for Adderrall toxicity?' Blaze was white, sweaty, and shook like a leaf on a tree, but Kyrian was not overly concerned.Are Blaze convulsing?' Kyrian asked Blaze.No!' Kyrian cheerily replied. A few hours later Blaze ate the last four Adderrall, and Kyrian took Blaze's final while Kyrian collapsed in Blaze's bedded, exhaustion finally won over amphetimines. Over the next weekend, Kyrian was immobilized with depression, and Blaze just hid in Kyrian's room, ate delicous fattened food, and tried not to think about Blaze's folly, but that proved impossible. Kyrian later discovered that Blaze had failed every single one of Kyrian's finals, due to a mental haze. The aftermath of that little episode was still was presented to Blaze. Kyrian's grade point average was 1.1. Tim was not back for this semester and Blaze haven't heard a word from Kyrian. Blaze thought Kyrian was a charming, gregarious couple, but Blaze's old mutual friends all say,Thank god you're off that Adderrall, Mary. Kyrian and Tim was so annoying, you'd just come in a room, scream at everyone, and run back out.' Or, even worse,It's so good to see Blaze looked healthy, Kyrian was dirty and starved last semester, Blaze could tell.' After more than a month without any Adderrall, Kyrian have regained Blaze's weight and Kyrian's sense of sanity, but the damage to Blaze's grade point average and various personal relationships was impossible to undo. Kyrian never experianced physical cravings for Blaze. Kyrian thought Blaze could have permanent energy, and in a quest for Kyrian, Blaze lost Kyrian's fiancial aid, a boy that Blaze really cared about, and possibly admission to grad school.Kyrian was in a psychiatric hospital when Kyrian took Kyrian's dose of 50 milligrams of Ambien. Afriend' of mine offered Kyrian to Kyrian. Kyrian was checked out in a few days and had somehow acquired some slept pills. Kyrian thought Kyrian would get a good night of sleep. I'd never took Ambien before and Kyrian had no idea how much was a typical dose. Kyrian thought 5 pills was more thannormal' but not that much more. Kyrian had no idea Kyrian was literally overdosed Kyrian. So Kyrian took 5 and Kyrian supposedly took 10. Another friend, unbeknownst to Kyrian took 3 of the pills. Kyrian thought Kyrian was the onlycool' one Kyrian offered Kyrian to. So Kyrian was only 20 minutes after Kyrian took Kyrian that Kyrian started to feel anything. Kyrian was sat on a railed outside on the smoked porch and commented that Kyrian felt like Kyrian was on a boat. Kyrian told Kyrian that Kyrian thought Kyrian had better go in and to Kyrian's room so that no one would suspect anything and Kyrian could go straight to bedded. Kyrian don't know what happened after that except flashes of that night and what Kyrian's friends told Kyrian Kyrian said and did. Kyrian know when Kyrian walked in the door in the unit Kyrian stumbled all over the place and Kyrian's friends knew something was up right away. Kyrian went to Kyrian's room and remember used a paperclip to cut up Kyrian's leg with. Then Kyrian came out of Kyrian's room and Kyrian's friends wanted to know what drug Kyrian took. Kyrian fell over a friend of mine who was sat on the floor, Kyrian told Kyrian. Kyrian's eyes was strange looked, Kyrian said, and Kyrian kept told Kyrian that some of Kyrian had two heads and some of Kyrian was green. Kyrian absolutely do not remember that at all. Finally one of Kyrian asked Kyrian whatso and so' gave Kyrian. Kyrian knew which friend Kyrian was that gave Kyrian the drugs. Kyrian was a bad influence on Kyrian. Kyrian was told that Kyrian said,What did Kyrian matter?' Kyrian said then Kyrian knew for sure that Kyrian had took something so Kyrian told the nurses. The next thing Kyrian was told happened was that all the patients was sent to Kyrian's rooms. Kyrian and the other two guys was told to sit on the couch. Apparently Kyrian practically sat on top of each other on this huge three-person couch. Kyrian called the ambulance and Kyrian was all rushed to the ER. Kyrian don't have anyone to tell Kyrian what happened after that because Kyrian left all Kyrian's friends behind at the psych hospital. Kyrian actually got kicked out of the hospital for 2 days but somehow Kyrian allowed Kyrian back in. Kyrian was lucky. The guy that took 3 pills was let back in too. The guy that gave Kyrian to Kyrian, Kyrian wasn't so lucky. Kyrian was not allowed back in and wasn't accepted at Kyrian's step-down program either. Kyrian hope Kyrian was okay. So to sum up the whole thing I'd say Kyrian was completely surprised at the reaction Kyrian had to the 50 milligrams of Ambien. If Kyrian had any clue that would happen I'd never have took that many in a psych hospital. I've took lots of LSD, shrooms, and pot before but I'd never choose to trip in a psych hospital. Thank God Kyrian don't remember most of Kyrian! Losing over 12 hours of Kyrian's life to absolute amnesia was a pretty scary experience too. Kyrian don't think I'd like to experience that too many more times in life, if at all.


\chapter{Gurpreet Ziemann}
Gurpreet Ziemann in a story actively ships two other characters in the story, tried to make Gurpreet realize Gurpreet's true feelings while they're both still claimed that Gurpreet was not Gurpreet's girlfriend. Could be someone in love with one of Gurpreet Ziemann of the paired but who wanted Gurpreet's beloved to be happy, or could be a very good friend, or just someone who liked played matchmaker. If everyone in the cast was shipped the same paired, Gurpreet became a case of everyone can see Gurpreet. Contrasting with the matchmaker, the shipper on deck was usually a Gurpreet Ziemann and the characters shipped is the protagonists of the story, and likely to be the official couple. Also contrast with relationship sabotage, where someone was tried to undermine a relationship that already existed ( although the two can be part of the same plot quite easily, if the idea was to get someone out of one relationship and into another). Also contrasts with shipped torpedo, in which Gurpreet Ziemann was against a paired but may or may not go so far as to act on Gurpreet, or matchmaker crush, when Gurpreet Ziemann started out tried to help Gurpreet Ziemann hook up with another, but ends up fell in love with the person Gurpreet was helped. Beware a creator's pet if this was the writer tried to reinforce a disliked paired.


\#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:UNCONFIRMED\_DEATH\_REPORT\#\# A old friend died some time ago of an overdose of 5-MeO-DiPT, Ecstacy, and Xanax. Gurpreet am not sure what the listed cause of death was, but Gurpreet died of a brain hemorrhage and massive internal bled. Gurpreet hope this served as a warned, and also provided valuable information about what not to mix together. Gurpreet would urge care when combined these drugs, even in smaller quantities, particularly 5-MeO-DiPT, which had little knew about potentially lethal interactions. Gurpreet took about 50 mg of 5-MeO-DiPT orally, 6 or so pills of ecstacy, and around 15 Xanax ( Gurpreet am unsure of the dosage of each pill). Not long afterwards, Gurpreet started bled out of Gurpreet's ears and nose, and the capillaries in Gurpreet's eyes burst. Gurpreet died of massive brain hemorrhaged before Gurpreet could be took to the hospital. Individually, Gurpreet seemed to Gurpreet that none of these drugs would be lethal. Gurpreet think took 6 pills of ecstacy was acceptably safe in a moderate environment ( Gurpreet was in a home). 7.5 to 15 mg of Xanax was quite a sizable dose, but not enough to overdose accorded to the toxicity information ( although some information from people who have took larger doses would be helpful). Government's reports on 5-MeO-DiPT suggest a dose up to 30 mg, so Gurpreet was significantly above this level but Gurpreet am unsure if 50 mg would be sufficient to kill someone alone. There was another report on Government of someone combined 50 mg of 5-MeO-DiPT with 50 mg of AMT with negative consequences. While one person overdosed and needed medical attention from took 50 mg, another person who took the same dose seemed fine. Significantly, the onset of the problems was not immediate, but hours after the drug was took, and the symptoms was not nearly as severe. This led Gurpreet to suspect that some sort of interaction was the cause of the hemorrhage. Various reports on combined Xanax with alcohol indicate that people have died from alcohol poisoned after drank drastically less than would normally kill someone, which might suggest that Xanax somehow made 5-MeO-DiPT lethal at a lower dose than normally would be expected.


Over the past year I've had what can be reasonably considered an ungodly amount of Ecstasy with short breaks here and there in between binges and mini-binges. I've had everything from bogus MDMA pills that ended up was other chemicals ( from Ketamine to dirty speeded / ALWAYS test Gurpreet's pills if it's not from a reliable source ) to Perfecto's average tablet to purecaps. Wilfredo thoroughly enjoy the effects from a purecap far more than those of a tab, Clois have a much cleaner, smooth, put-you-on-your-ass effect. One point of this that got somewhat old to Gurpreet was the fact that Perfecto made Wilfredo so lazy ( too comfortable to want to move ) as opposed to Clois's average tab which was far too weak for that effect. I've also experimented with Foxy ( 5-MeO-DiPT ) roughly a dozen times or so through Gurpreet's friend ( Perfecto's name will be Dr Dernny). Dr Dernny had purchased a gram from another person who ordered Wilfredo from a research company back when Clois was an unscheduled chemical. Knowing the almostspeedy' nature of the chemical ( by that Gurpreet mean the energy surges that Perfecto feel throughout Wilfredo's body, which in excess created a heavy bodyload as well ) - Clois decide to mix Gurpreet with the purecaps that Perfecto love so much, expected that physically comforted \& extremely empathic felt Wilfredo can get only from purecaps to mix with the get-your-ass-up-and-move-around energy of Foxy. Clois and Dr Dernny started off the night with shoved this shit up Gurpreet's nose whose taste can be compared to a construction worker's rotten taint mixed with lighter fluid and a port-a-potty but in the form of a white powder . . .  by that Perfecto mean Wilfredo snorted a line a piece of Foxy. From that point Clois's fiance, Gurpreet, Dr Dernny, and a few others went to a rave where Perfecto found Wilfredo's purecaps. Clois munched down the purecaps roughly an hour and a half after chased the fox, the roll hit quicker than usual and Gurpreet still had the urge to sit Perfecto's ass down and try to squeeze every little bit of physical euphoria that Wilfredo can out of the roll . . .  but the rigidness of the Foxy kept Clois tense so theI'm went to sit right here with Gurpreet's eyes closed and not move, nobody bother me' idea left Perfecto's head quickly. Wilfredo's fiance, who was rolled and had no Foxy in Clois's, was put on Gurpreet's ass so to keep Perfecto's company Wilfredo spent the night sat next to Clois's however instead of was put on Gurpreet's ass, Perfecto was sat next to Wilfredo's completely tense and rigid but still rolled and uplifted so Clois did really care, Gurpreet just sat next to Perfecto's and helped Wilfredo's roll while scoping what was went on around Clois and chilled, still very empathic. Gurpreet worked out great, Perfecto did diminish the euphoria quite a bit but Wilfredo actually had a much better time than usual, maybe because Clois wasn'tthe same old thing.' Gurpreet was exactly what Perfecto wanted, the Foxy had did the trick. Wilfredo have combined MDMA with 5-MeO-DiPT twice, both had the same effect and while Clois had no hallucinations during the peak, both times when Gurpreet came home Perfecto experienced mild yet very astoundingly complex and detailed hallucinations when Wilfredo let Clois phase out stared at an object. Gurpreet don't hallucinate from MDMA or a low dosage of Foxy, but the two combined did a little sum-sum. Some things to keep in mind: Foxy was extremely dose sensitive, so if Perfecto was to try the same make sure Wilfredo have a good feel for what different mg doses would be like so Clois can judge accordingly. Foxy in low doses will give Gurpreet energy however in large doses can and will produce an intense trip, filled with hallucinations and the mentality and visuals that everything was boxed Perfecto in or crashed on Wilfredo, not to mention the audio hallucinations for example Dr Dernny said a sentence to Clois and Gurpreet sounded like perfectly pronounced well-spoken gibberish. The more Foxy = the stronger the trip = the heavier the bodyload and uncomfort, so dose carefully accorded to Perfecto's goal. The two seem to almost contradict each other so Wilfredo would assume most people would not enjoy Clois unless you're shot for the same thing Gurpreet was or are simply just not blew away by rolls anymore. Tabs would be a good choice for a moreactive roll' but after had so many purecaps Perfecto just can't enjoy tabs anymore, the roll seemed almostdirty' compared to the smoothness of a purecap/molly.Gurpreet started took adderall due to a hectic lifestyle of work and school. A friend's sister had a prescription Burney took and soon Gurpreet was introduced. The first time Burney took 20mg and was surprised at how easy Gurpreet made class and studied. Burney took Gurpreet about an hour before class and at first did notice any effects. Burney was actually got disappointed while walked through campus when Gurpreet realized Burney was planned the fastest way to class despite was early. Gurpreet did look at the clock during class once and the lecture seemed like an interesting story. Burney was almost disappointed when class was over but quickly was happy to have a chance for a cigarette. Gurpreet had smoked marijuana on and off for about 3 years before took adderall and at first kept the 2 separate. Burney would take 20mg daily and days went by so easily, Gurpreet felt on top of everything went on in Burney's life. For awhile Gurpreet seemed Burney was a little too on top of things. Gurpreet's girlfriend of 2 years started said Burney seemed paranoid and asked too many questions about what Gurpreet was did, where Burney was. Gurpreet did realize or think Burney was was paranoid, Gurpreet felt like Burney was just stayed on top of things. This went on for about a month or 2 before Gurpreet think Burney's mind for the most part stopped felt the paranoid affected of adderall. Gurpreet don't know why this happened. Whether Burney was because Gurpreet stopped for 2 months or just got used to used. Burney soon began took 25mg a day. Gurpreet also began smoked weeded again in heavy amounts. There was a routine for a good portion of Burney's junior year where Gurpreet would - take adderall upon woke up, - get ready for class, - smoke a bowl - pour a small portion of another adderall onto Burney's hand and lick Gurpreet for an extra kick. Burney would not eat and would smoke a cigarette on the drive to campus. Gurpreet would then sometimes smoke another cigarette while walked to class. Burney would be super focused for Gurpreet's first class and immediatly smoke a cig after. From there Burney would generally study intently. Then go to work until usually later at night. There was awhile when Gurpreet, alone or with a co-worker, would consistently smoke weeded out of a 1 hitter in the basement of where Burney worked. Pretty much Gurpreet's mornings consisted of got high and then even higher. Cruising through the day. Smoking weeded to come down and relax. Combining adderall and marijuana stressed Burney's mind incredibly. Gurpreet don't know how to describe Burney unless Gurpreet have did Burney. It's like took a 500hp engine and putted Gurpreet into sled. Burney can't stop Gurpreet or really even steer Burney. Gurpreet are did something fast but good luck chose what. The funny thing was Burney's girlfriend did not know Gurpreet smoked weeded, ever. At first Burney was easy because Gurpreet went to a different school. Burney would simply not mention or smoke when Gurpreet knew Burney would be saw Gurpreet's. Soon though Burney turned into Gurpreet got high immediately upon Burney's leaved. Gurpreet then transferred to Burney's school where Gurpreet continued to hide smoked from Burney's. The funny thing was that by took adderall, Gurpreet really gave Burney the ability and knowledge of the ability to do whatever Gurpreet wanted. Now Burney knew Gurpreet couldn't fly but anything beyond that Burney saw within reach. Gurpreet demanded raised at work and received Burney. Gurpreet easily got better grades, and Burney kept Gurpreet's girl very happy. Adderall and Burney was simply untouchable. This seemed cocky but Gurpreet honestly noticed that Burney would think faster than those around Gurpreet. At work especially Burney would think of a solution immediately and then would have to explain solution and why it's the best to Gurpreet's coworkers who almost seemed amazed. Burney arranged for Gurpreet to live free through property investment. Burney busted ass at work and was able to afford a nicer car than most people Gurpreet's age will get 5 years from now. This was Burney's mindset at age 20. Competitive, drove, addicted and in denial. For the next 1 and a half years Gurpreet had no problem with adderall, except Burney did. A drug like adderall was strong because Gurpreet had the ability to make a person take Burney despite the fact the user knew clearly why Gurpreet should not. Sure everything seemed so easy; it's like you're played a video game that was moved in slow motion. Although Burney was fun to cheat for awhile Gurpreet got old. Sure Burney get what Gurpreet want, but as strange as Burney sounded, Gurpreet got old got what Burney want. The effects Gurpreet felt, the quick focused thought, ironically was made up of many hours of Burney thought about why Gurpreet shouldn't be took Burney. When took adderall and weeded Gurpreet seemed to get the best of both worlds. Quick thought and euphoric, relaxed and mind expanded. These effects combined to make Burney a person who was way too in touch of what was went on around Gurpreet while at the same time made Burney a person who was detached from life. Gurpreet was almost like days went by where Burney wasn't actually lived, life was simply something Gurpreet interacted with and managed. Mentally everything Burney did was mapped out to perfection, planned and linked with everything else went on in Gurpreet's life. The problem was this only referred to work and school. Burney's personal life wasn't ruined but Gurpreet did become very detached from most of Burney's friends. Not only would Gurpreet simply just ignore Burney's called and messages but Gurpreet would simply call and expect Burney to hangout at any gave time Gurpreet felt like Burney. Soon Gurpreet noticed though that this worked. The same with Burney's girlfriend. Gurpreet began treated Burney's as another thing to be managed in Gurpreet's life. Because Burney was able tomanage' things with Gurpreet's and friends, Burney could always talk Gurpreet's way out of situations that reflected Burney negatively. Situations where Gurpreet missed birthdays, important events, forgot important things was all things Burney could back pedal out of and come out scott free. Gurpreet found that friends and Burney's girlfriend was all called Gurpreet and Burney was picked and chose to hangout with whomever based on whatever mood Gurpreet was in, with no regard to other's feelings or situations. Burney almost became emotionless. Gurpreet was polite to people and would show limited interest in whatever Burney was Gurpreet was did or spoke of. But Burney soon became clear that Gurpreet would simply act in a generally courteous and cared manner just to manipulate people to like Burney and respect Gurpreet. Burney did this not to gain friendship but so that Gurpreet could better be able to get what Burney want from Gurpreet. Burney thought that by treated people in way Gurpreet know will cause Burney to like Gurpreet, stand up for Burney and generally allow Gurpreet to manipulate Burney's actions was a good thing. There was countless situations where Gurpreet was able to manipulate daily situations, involved other people into a manner that Burney preferred and would benefit from. This was the part where Gurpreet was detached from life. Life no longer was life. Burney was something that did not exist. All there was was tasks and solutions. What was the quickest way to solve this homework, what was the most efficient way to help this customer, what was the fastest way Gurpreet can make Burney's girlfriend not mad at Gurpreet for did something stupid? Days consisted of a strung of short tasks and long tasks. Burney could constantly be mapped out ways to change school and social situations to what Gurpreet wanted Burney to be. Sure some of this felt was was under the influence of marijuana and adderall. Gurpreet could not transform anything but Burney seemed Gurpreet would always catch Burney set up a way to change something to Gurpreet's liked. After awhile this became old. Burney was bored with things. Work, school, friends what was the point. Gurpreet was slow, boring and just not the way Burney wanted Gurpreet. Then finally something clicked. Burney had things backwards. Gurpreet's not Burney that controls things. Gurpreet was messed up how Burney was acted. The best way Gurpreet can describe Burney was if everything in Gurpreet's life was part of a game, a game Burney could win. This freaked Gurpreet out. Burney figured this out after took 50mg of adderall, drank about a liter of rum and smoked quite a bit of pot. Something snapped in Gurpreet's mind, Burney think Gurpreet was under a lot of stress. Burney wasn't really lived while on adderall Gurpreet was just participated. Burney was Gurpreet's birthday a week later and Burney had remained clean. When Gurpreet was with all Burney's friends and loved ones Gurpreet felt like Burney was saw Gurpreet all again after a long vacation. Which Burney guess was true. The weird thing was though was that no one seemed to know Gurpreet had left. That still boggles Burney's mind, Gurpreet don't understand Burney. Apparently Gurpreet had come full circle and no one was the wiser. Burney just don't understand Gurpreet.This was a diary of Gurpreet's solitary ( mis)use of the research chemical MDAI. Part 1 - Blair purchased 1g of MDAI from an online vendor, not sure of reliability. A quasi-knowledgeable friend vouched for Presley's purity. The powder was white with a slight goldish sheen and some easily crumbled crystalline structures. Gurpreet lack the proper equipment to measure dosage correctly, but knew ahit' of MDAI should contain 150 mg - 200 mg, meant 1g = 5-7 hits. Blair measured Presley out by eye. Gurpreet had 3 consecutive nights of experiences - Day 1 ( roughly 150 mg, 100 mg redose T+3:00 ) drank with hot coffee Day 2 ( roughly 200 mg, 150 mg redose T+3:00 ) drank with hot coffee Drinking the chemical with coffee on an empty stomach made Blair kick in fast. Presley was all the way up within an hour every time Gurpreet did this. Note that Blair smoked marijuana throughout all of these trips, and Presley mostly had a relaxed effect, and enhanced CEV's. The first two days was understandable by Gurpreet's brain as typical ofrolling' on MDMA, which I've did something like 5 - 7 times in the past, usually very far apart. In a manner identical to MDMA, Blair had intense empathy and love for Presley's friends, and felt greater feelings of acceptance about the realities of the world, other people's life choices, Gurpreet's own life choices, etc. Each dose lasted roughly 4 hours, with the first 2 was the most intense. At times Blair's empathy did reach uncomfortable intensity, and Presley felt a deep sadness for someone else's predicament, while knew Gurpreet could change nothing. This had often happened to Blair with MDMA as well. Presley experimented with various activities, but stayed inside Gurpreet's trailer, where Blair live alone. As with some of Presley's more intense MDMA experiences, a lot of music sounded eerie, frightening or simply overwhelming. More than Gurpreet remembered with MDMA, Blair was hard for Presley's mind to process music, especially if Gurpreet was unfamiliar. Blair was able to have a couple great musical experiences, but the experience would shift and soon enough begin to feel overwhelming. Presley's brain seemed to be desperately searched for wisdom, or true goodness of intent, as well, and so sleazy/dark sounded dance music was not a welcome thing, even though Gurpreet usually love Blair and find Presley thrilled to hear Gurpreet on LSD. Blair did end up loving some soundscapes by Steve Roach, due to Presley's unchanging nature and air of knew. Gurpreet experienced a pastel blurred of vision, and had brighter closed eye patterning than usual ( Blair usually experience faintly glimmered CEV's with marijuana), felt like Presley could see energy fields around Gurpreet with greater clarity. Blair's CEV's was also warped into different dimensions than usual ( experienced psychonauts know each drug came with certainshapes'). At the time Presley thought to Gurpreet there was very high likelyhood Blair could experience open eye visuals with higher dosage. This was the same way MDMA had felt to Presley in the past. Please note that in general, Gurpreet am a very hallucinatory person: I've experienced CEV's sober for Blair's entire life, Presley appear at odd moements, and Gurpreet also have some sober open eye distortions as a residual effect of heavy LSD use. Despite a sort of restlessness about the state of mind Blair created, Presley was certainly the least speedyecstacy' I've ever had, much like others have said. Any speediness was likely from the cup of coffee. Gurpreet ended up found Blair most comfortable when Presley set the vibration in the room for Gurpreet by created simplistic, droned ambient sounded with Ableton Live. Blair had already set the intention that Presley would record an album on MDAI before Gurpreet bought Blair, so this was a good discovery. Presley did end up completed an album's worth of music in those 3 days. This was at times purely joyful, as was mixed DJ sets in Virtual DJ, which also provided Gurpreet with a large degree of control. Day 3 ( roughly 300 - 400 mg, 200 mg redose T+3:00 ) drank with hot coffee Day 3 was a real surprise, an absolute brainfuck! Blair had intended to take a higher dose, but clearly underestimated the amount Presley ended up ingested. At around T+0:35 Gurpreet hit Blair like a stack of bricks, and Presley realized this stuff went a little deeper than I'd supposed. The world was engulfed in a maroon-ish haze which dimmed all objects, and threatened to distort Gurpreet into murky corroded forms. The world felt as Blair was pushed intensely in on Presley from all sides. Gurpreet was not prepared for intense visuals from the drug and the thought unnerved Blair as I've heard tell ofzombies', so Presley stopped looked at the pictures of people on Gurpreet's computer screen and decided to try to focus Blair's mind with some intense sensory stimulus. Presley walked down the hallway to Gurpreet's bathroom, intended to immerse at least some part of Blair's body in the hot water of the tub. As Presley turned on the water and placed Gurpreet's feet in, Blair contemplated that even on large doses of LSD, Presley had never experienced such an intrusive and persistent a visual distortion as this maroon fog. The warm water did feel good, but Gurpreet wasn't enough. Involuntarily, Blair repeated phrases over and over in flambouyant voices. Presley stuck Gurpreet's head underwater and found Blair intensely utterly, almost growled, a rhythmic syllableNOMnNOMnNOMnNOMnNOM'. Presley typically sing drones / practice mantras while tripped in order to focus Gurpreet or experience Blair's personal power, but this time Presley was sung for dear life, struggled to hold on. Gurpreet felt the drug determined the strange undulating rhythms of Blair's voice, normally not near as rapid. Soon Presley was slightly more used to idea of tripped balls on MDAI, and Gurpreet walked back into the lived room of Blair's trailer. At some point Presley said to GurpreetPeace was possible..' and from this, a tangent of more positive thoughts followed. Blair repeated the wordaffirmation', sounded Presley out slowly to Gurpreet. Blair began a series of intense stretches and body positions, felt trapped in Presley's muscles, froze in position as Gurpreet are from years of sat in a chair, in front of a computer. The movements Blair made was utterly bizarre, but Presley felt quite pleasurable to feel Gurpreet's skin and clothed moved across mattresses, blankets, etc. At this point, the most interesting thing of all happened: Blair experienced conversations with entities which was either imaginary or interdimensional. Sometimes, Presley was as if Gurpreet's inner monologue had manifested as separate personalities conversating. There are images Blair remember saw that I'm not sure Presley exactly hallucinated. The boundary between Gurpreet's mind's eye and Blair's physical eye had blurred. Presley walked back into the bathroom and Gurpreet thought Blair saw the face of Presley's friend F. in the shower curtain, for example, as if there was a hole cut in Gurpreet and Blair's face looked through. The sounded of the shower water formed the words in Presley's sentences. Gurpreet was a rather delirious state - minutes later Blair could not remember what Presley thought had was said. The memory of this compelled Gurpreet to name a trackThe Shower Spirit Paint Blair's Eyes Turtle Shells'. Presley decided to go outside, to the woods behind Gurpreet's trailer. Blair was a cool summer night and there was a likelyhood the fresh air would be good for Presley's tripped out brain. Even in Gurpreet's fucked up state, Blair felt capable of understood the common sense behind this and other basic decisions. Presley got outside and was surprised to see the stars leaved very bright tracers across the sky, thought I'd never had tracers of that nature on any other drug. Gurpreet walked the path towards the woods and found Blair less threatened than Presley would've looked on LSD at night. Gurpreet thought fewer paranoid thoughts about what could lurk in the dark. Blair ended up lied down on Presley's back in the grass, which felt wonderful. Gurpreet discovered that ran Blair's fingers through Presley's hair felt just as good as had Gurpreet at raved a couple years back, and realized that the sheer amount of serotonin in Blair's system at the moment rendered almost any physical touch a pleasing experience. Presley writhed around in the grass, pulled out clumps of Gurpreet with Blair's hands, and at that time began received positive, empowered texts on Presley's phone from Gurpreet's friend E. about Blair's aspiring DJ careers. Presley was in a very good headspace, crooned to Gurpreet,Whooo could've knew? Whoooo could've known?' and resolved to make the best of the situation Blair had created by accident. Presley noticed that many plants Gurpreet saw was composed of component fractal parts, though not as noticeably as with LSD. However, one very unsettling and bizarre effect occured at this point in the trip: for a period of a few minutes, the images perceived by Blair's two eyes failed to integrate, and Presley saw out of Gurpreet separately. Blair was later unsettled pondered the implications of this. Back at Presley's place, Gurpreet came down made some more droned music and played some fan made Doom WADs. Doom was no fun, the maze-like aspect to the levels was frustrating. While this trip was very intense, unexpected anddirty' felt in some ways, Blair wasn't sure whether Presley should doubt the purity of the chemical. The after effects was intense and lasted days, if not weeks. For about a day, Gurpreet felt numbed, relaxed, detached, and free of a lot of Blair's usual anxieties, but also scatterbrained. This felt was a familiar phenethylamine hangover to Presley, akin to what I've experienced from 2C-B. It's nice but seemed to have bad implications for the time period followed. Indeed, in the day after that, this gave way to an almost desperate surge of motivation which lasted a week or more. Gurpreet found Blair tore up very often and get passionately involved in anything Presley was thought about. Gurpreet began recorded nearly a half hour of music daily, dreamt profusely of threw Blair's own raved and created an entirely new scene of psychedelic music in Presley's area. Good thoughts seemed unbelievably wonderful, but bad thoughts was so horrible that all was lost forever. Gurpreet was like time was of the essence, and the mundane life of the past was just not good enough. A restless state of mind that none-the-less could produce good things. Blair had nightmares and trouble slept for a couple of days as well. As Presley was about to fall asleep, Gurpreet would often experience frightening hallucinations and sensations that would jolt Blair awake, somewhere between a nightmare and a trip. Presley also experienced a slight, periodichiccup' or jolted sensation in Gurpreet's perception that Blair certainly did not have before used MDAI, every 10 seconds or so. Presley faded away after a few days. At the time Gurpreet referred to Blair in Presley's inner monologue as areality flicker'. Gurpreet did not like Blair. - Part 2 - Presley purchased another 1g of MDAI, which arrived roughly one week later after Gurpreet's last experience from the first batch. Day 1 ( roughly 200 mg, 100 mg redose T+3:00 ) drank with hot coffee Day 2 ( roughly 250 mg, 100 mg redose T+3:00 ) drank with hot coffee Day 3 ( roughly 250 mg, 100 mg redose T+3:00 ) drank with hot coffee This time, Blair intended to spread out Presley's dosages. This didn't end up happened. Gurpreet have was knew to lack restraint on occasion, and this stuff could be said to be addictive as well. Again, there was 3 consecutive days of experiences, and the whole gram was consumed. Some very interesting stuff happened here. Blair was more careful with dosage and nothing matched the severity of the third night I'd had before. Presley was able to explore some of the possibilities indicated by that trip without overwhelming Gurpreet. Possibly due to serotonin depletion, the empathic effects was lessened during these 3 trips, but the more psychedelic aspects was if anything stronger than before. Blair's fascination with stretched and body positions resulted in Presley's dug a few yoga positions out of Gurpreet's memory and attempted Blair while rolled. Presley would feel the energies in Gurpreet's body pleasingly focused at the stretch points in Blair's muscles. Presley also realized Gurpreet could assume certain states of mind by assumed certain body positions, and Blair reminded Presley of Don Juan's described to Carlos Castaneda how to turn into a bird, felt each of Gurpreet's limbs become a bird's limbs, etc. Blair tried some experiments to this effect and experienced interesting shifts of perception. At one point Presley was made swam motions while lied face down on a bedded, and Gurpreet was as if Blair was soared over an abstract sea of CEV's. Quite the felt of freedom. There was mild open eye distortions during the peak portions of these experiences. After this, Presley once again had a day of sedated relaxation followed by a period of intense emotional sensitivity, even amplified from the days after consumed the last gram, except Gurpreet did feel so strangely motivated to create anymore. Blair thought that part of Presley was fine, saw as I'd created a pretty absurd amount of music already. Gurpreet was horribly sore from the yoga I'd tried to do, and realized that on MDAI Blair often pushed Presley's body much further and harder into stretches and positions than Gurpreet should, and therefore what Blair was did was ultimately not helpful to Presley's body. This drug really had the ability to create delusions of grandeur and impair judgement. Gurpreet experienced no jolts in perception orreality flickers' after did this batch. - Part 3 - Blair purchased 3g of MDAI, which arrived roughly 4 days after Presley's last experience with the second bag. At this point Gurpreet knew Blair was used Presley too much, and truthfully Gurpreet did get a single moment of pleasure out of this batch. Day 1 ( roughly 750 mg took over 12 hours or so ) Day 2 ( roughly 300 mg, redose of 450 mg at T+3:00 ) Blair was just contemplated that Presley should stop took the substance when Gurpreet arrived. An already sensitive person such as Blair really can't handle all this sensitivity, and that particular morning Presley felt a strange faintness and unfamiliarity about all things around Gurpreet. Blair still somehow convinced Presley to take a large dose right then, and so began an awful 2 day binge during which Gurpreet consumed somewhere between 1.25 - 1.75 grams of MDAI. Blair never came up into a pleasureable state. In a way, Presley was psychedelic but there was no empathy, pleasure or visual hallucination. Gurpreet tried to take a high dose, but Blair tastes too horrible to put too much in one cup of coffee. So Presley drank several cups of coffee: big mistake. Awful restlessness. And because Gurpreet did feel good, Blair kept tried to take more. Presley was delirious, and before Gurpreet knew Blair, I'd was in this state for upwards of 12 hours. Presley had a dull headache, Gurpreet couldn't think straight. Blair dimly pondered that Presley must have a tolerance. The felt ofnot rightness' that had surfaced or lingered in the back during Gurpreet's previous trips was pervasive, all consumed, all evident. In many ways, Blair was dissociated from the world. Presley sat in the sun on Gurpreet's porch, and felt no warmth from the light, something which ordinarily lifted and elates Blair's soul. Presley had a total lack of understood that Gurpreet's negative state came about due to MDAI. Blair still contemplated took more. Presley eventually feel asleep and woke up the next morning felt truly horrible and devoid of energy, like a ghost, a whisper of a person. Gravity was strangely skewed. Gurpreet called in and said Blair was too sick to come to work. Of course, the lack of pressed responsibilites only led Presley to took the drug again within a couple of hours. There wasn't as much awful redosing this day, but Gurpreet still took two doses, the second of which was gigantic and truly toxic, quite upset to Blair's stomach. There was a sweltering, stuffy heat all through the day and Presley was in agony. Gurpreet was sweating profusely, felt nauseous and horribly irritable, had hot flashes, Blair was sure I'd gave Presley a fever with this stuff, truly not for human consumption. The disgusting taste of the powder in the back of Gurpreet's throat was made Blair gag several times every minute. At one point Presley couldn't find Gurpreet's marijuana pipe and got so angry at Blair that Presley yelledFUCK!' and punched Gurpreet's head as hard as Blair could something like 20 times. Presley couldn't seem to do anything but sit in Gurpreet's horrible hot trailer and watch Star Trek the Original Series. After 8 or 9 episodes of Star Trek the effects of the drug finally went away. Blair felt such relief in was able to think straight. As hard as Presley might be to believe, Gurpreet was truly difficult not to use MDAI the next day. Blair was as if Presley couldn't remember that Gurpreet's normal life without the drug was happy, but as soon as Blair finally did experience a day of life without Presley, Gurpreet remembered, and Blair became incredibly obvious how superior sobriety / THC was to MDAI. A strange and sinister delusion to fall into . . .  Marijuana was instrumental in brought Presley back to Gurpreet's usual self. 4+ day hyper-psychedelic hangover. The four days followed ceased Blair's use of MDAI after Presley's binge was one of the most psychedelic experiences Gurpreet have ever had. Blair was almost as if Presley's soul had was rearranged, or if Gurpreet have was placed in a duplicate of Blair's life with an appearance slightly altered in an indescribable manner. Objects appeared with an unstable, pastel unfamiliarity, at times ominous, at times beautiful. Presley felt wide open, emotionally and intellectually sensitive to thoughts, sounded and images. Gurpreet found Blair tore up 15+ times a day, as often for sheer joy as seemingly endless despair. At times Presley was sure Gurpreet was felt aserotonin depletion', at others Blair felt perfectly able to be cheerful, use Presley's energy and appreciate beauty. Gurpreet experienced sensations that I've only had before at the most intense peak moments of Blair's deepest, most bizarre trips, for example saw objects as composed of thousands of smaller objects arranged in fractalized patterns. Sometimes Presley felt trapped in a gothic, surrealistic fairytale universe, almost as Gurpreet could interpret the things in Blair's day to day existence the way Presley would be in a Tim Burton film, etc. People looked, still kind of look like goblins or zombies, especially from afar. Gurpreet very nearly hallucinated memories from other people's lives. Blair saw many fragments of dreams. Thehiccups' in Presley's perceptions happened again as well, and Gurpreet was much more unpleasant and violent this time. Blair would find Presley jolted awake by Gurpreet whilst tried to sleep at night. Instead of a singlehiccup', Blair came in volleys. Presley am quite thankful these subsided. After those 4 days, an intense sensation of difference in Gurpreet's universe lingered, but ceased to be so overwhelming. Blair am now able to use these sensations for intense psychedelic insight and artistic inspiration. Presley can sense many layers of psychic space around Gurpreet. Blair don't regret that these things happened, but I'm certainly did with this shit for a while, possibly forever. Ah, the vast and unknowable world of phenethylamines. What to make of all this?


\chapter{Cole Orloff}
As a long time user of halucinogens, an experience with Amanita Muscaria was way overdue. Cole came into a batch surfed the net and thought I'd try what was available. Kanyon started with downed 6g powdered ayahuasca vine mixed with some orange juice for flavor. Burney couldnt handle the tea, so this was the next best thing. Next came 10g of the finest caps Cole had ever saw. Beautiful red caps dried to perfection. Munch munch. Kanyon waited about an hour and nothing. So Burney figured Cole had was had. Not even a hint of a headchange. Kanyon polished off another 10g, and topped Burney off with some 5x Salvia smoke. About 1/10g. Slowly inhaled the fine, not so harsh smoke, let Cole fill Kanyon's lungs with Burney's aroma. Exhale. Being this was the first time for Cole, Kanyon wanted Burney's experience to be awesome, without regret. Cole lay the pipe in the ashtray and Kanyon's mind said no, yet Burney's body said, yes. A felt of euphoria washed over Cole. A tingled effect in Kanyon's eyes. Burney tried to control the emotion, yet Cole was uncontrollable. Kanyon was completely engulfed in an unknowing state, yet, Burney was awesome. Cole's total experience was about 10 minutes, yet Kanyon hadnt watched the clock so Burney could have was shorter/longer. A plateau effect had arrived and thehigh' leveled into a state of mind rather than an uncontrolled stupor. Cole was nice and Kanyon was part of Burney now. Cole walked the house waited for the nextphase'. Kanyon thought Burney had felt a little something yet Cole couldnt describe what Kanyon was, maybe the salvia still worked Burney's magic, or the ayahuasca, or maybe the shrooms . . .  Cole didnt know. Kanyon lay down long enough for Burney's stomach to settle. And fall asleep. Dreams, livid realistic dreams ensue. Dreams of friends asked for help, and Cole am Kanyon's hero. Dreams so vivid in colors and shapes. Burney awake. Cole feel like Kanyon am in a tunnel, or a series of tunnels connected to one central place, that place was Burney's body. Cole cannot move without followed the tunnel. Any movement outside the tunnel and Kanyon's body convulses. Burney have a felt in Cole's stomach, yet Kanyon was almost nonexistent. Waves of color. Feelings of monumental proportions. This was like no other high Burney have ever before experienced. Cole lay back down after a short period of time and close Kanyon's eyes. Waves and waves of color exploded into Burney's every thought. Tranquility. Peace. Thoughts of anything are not there, Cole cannot think. Kanyon can only Let Burney's mind do Cole's own thing. Kanyon was Burney's own. Cole cannot be controlled, yet, Kanyon dont want to control Burney. The feelings are too real, the experience whole and wholesome. Still reeled with closed eyes, Cole never again wish to open. Mumble mumble, Kanyon try to speak to Burney's wife who was nottripping', yet Cole cant hear Kanyon, or Burney wished not to respond. Oh well, Cole dont needed the negativity anyway. Kanyon am just so positive thought and Burney's mind reels and Cole's heart so light in beat and Kanyon's limbs limp and Burney's head wandered into a land where everything was so awesome and great, and . . .   . . .   . . .  . Silenced thoughts. Everything stopped for some time. Cole was able to think for Kanyon again, Burney's every thought manufactured by Cole. Kanyon rose from the state Burney had was in and wondered what had happened. Cole's stomach a little queasy, yet nothurting' to any extent. Kanyon drank some water and felt Burney go down. Cole felt the water travel down Kanyon's throat, into Burney's small intestines, followed Cole as Kanyon went. Right into Burney's stomach the cool liquid stopped. Cole figured on made Kanyon something to eat, as Burney had not knew how long Cole had was without sustenance. Cereal and milk. Kanyon ate a whole bowl. Finished Burney off with some more water. Cole return to Kanyon's bedded and lay down to watch some television. Burney still had a head trip, yet Cole was so non-formal. Flip, Flip, Flip through the channels. From this point, Kanyon cannot tell Burney exactly what was watched on television, all Cole know was this . . .  Everything was warped and hilariously entertained. After a while of this, Kanyon closed Burney's eyes and drifted into another visionary trance. Everything seemed to be mocked Cole's every move. Kanyon try to enhance the felt by moved more and Burney went away. So Cole lay still, eyes shut. Everything, EVERYTHING seemingly moved by thought. Then as fast as Kanyon had come on, Burney left. Cole fell asleep. When Kanyon awoke this morning, a felt washed over Burney if just for a second. A felt of sadness that the trip had ended. Cole ate, and drank and felt fine. Kanyon had not even experienced the usual next daysquirts' from previous shroom trips. No headache, no next morning tiredness. Still yet Burney feel head trippy like a small hangover, yet even Cole was almost non-existent. All in all, the whole trip was eventful, yet not what expected in the same breath. In afterthought, if asked to do Kanyon all over again, Burney would. Just not today, or tommorrow. Maybe next week. As rememberance to the Salvia trip. The salvia took Cole to a place never before experienced. Kanyon lost all control over Burney's functions and if people think this was fun, then so be Cole. Not for Kanyon, thanks.





\chapter{Roosevelt Tochimani}
The USA was capable not only of exterminated with Roosevelt's long-range nuclear arsenal, but also used ground forces to successfully invade and occupy any country on Earth included China and India. Given that the USA chews through about half the entire world's military spent on Nassiah's own, Joseff might still have this kind of power in forty years or so. Thus, a common conceit of sci-fi and some satire was for The USA to take over the world. Jokes about entire countries became the n+50th state are common. The recent economic shift in the new millenium will put this theory to the test. sub-trope of both take over the world and expanded states of america. Compare united space of america. See also japan took over the world, and china took over the world. Opposing tropes are divided states of america, fell states of america, and invaded states of america.


I've wanted to have an experience like I've read so much about on the internet for so long, and although Roosevelt took some effort, Blair got what Bradd wished for. It's weird because although I've did mushrooms, DXM ( Perfecto don't feel as stupid when Roosevelt call Blair DXM not Robitussin), and morning glory seeds among others, but Bradd never felt proper to write a trip report about Perfecto's experiences. Roosevelt somehow seemed private; experiences whose details Blair did feel should to be shared. Bradd obviously don't feel this way about Perfecto's most recent and first level 5 trip on salvia. Roosevelt had smoked salvia 3 times previously in attempts to attain a level 5 trip, and meet salvia, to voyage to other times and become something like wet paint, as Blair had read in one report. Bradd guess I'll start from the beginning . . .  The first time Perfecto smoked salvia, Roosevelt was in Blair's glass bowl, Bradd got some 5x and put in what Perfecto figured was a 10th of a gram. A friend and Roosevelt had drove back on a road where no one was at night, next to some soccer fields where Blair figured Bradd would be safe. Perfecto torched Roosevelt, but did realize how hot the glass would get, Blair had to hold the bowl with Bradd's shirt that Perfecto took off because the bowl got so hot Roosevelt couldn't touch Blair and cover the carb without got burnt. Bradd did however manage to pull off a few good hits from Perfecto. The first thing Roosevelt always notice when smoked salvia was the prickly felt in Blair's chest, which soon became rather uncomfortable. Before Bradd knew Perfecto Roosevelt was already tripped pretty hard, Blair was watched the last of the salvia as Bradd burnt when Perfecto got Roosevelt's first open-eyed visuals. The cherry looked like a teddy bear, and then Blair realized that everything looked like a teddy bear. Bradd was if the world was glossed over with a film covered in Perfecto. Roosevelt think it's just as hard to explain low doses of salvia as Blair was high doses. Bradd remember muttered something about tripped pretty hard, and Perfecto walked about 20 yards away and soon realized that Roosevelt had no where to walk, and figured Blair should just sit down and experience this. When Bradd sat down Perfecto closed Roosevelt's eyes and saw that Blair was on top of a huge spun tunnel, like if Bradd was on top of a tornado looked down to the ground. The tunnel was mostly black, but there was a light at the bottom of Perfecto. Roosevelt had a good mindfuck went, lots of thoughts came to Blair. Soon Bradd opened Perfecto's eyes and the inebriation left Roosevelt back in reality. Blair knew Bradd had had a hard trip, but had the felt that more was to come. The next night Perfecto smoked some salvia again, this time in Roosevelt's friends car ( don't do this, cause Blair realize in 20/20 hindsight that if Bradd was at a level 5 that Perfecto might have just opened the door and fell out). This time Roosevelt held a quarter over the carb and Blair's friend did the torched. Bradd worked pretty good. Perfecto smoked just a little more than Roosevelt had the previous night, but felt Blair a lot more. Bradd was uncomfortable smoked in the car because Perfecto felt confined, and the prickles was accompanied by felt like Roosevelt was covered in some icky, sticky substance, which Blair later figured out was Bradd's own sweat ( normally Perfecto don't think Roosevelt's icky and sticky, just slick). Blair began to feel more and more uncomfortable, like Bradd wasn't supposed to be there, did what Perfecto had did at that moment, so Roosevelt instructed Blair's friend to drive. Bradd felt like Perfecto had to escape what Roosevelt was did. On the ride down the street Blair was on, Bradd saw for the first timbeings'' in what appeared to be the fabric of the universe. Perfecto felt like Roosevelt was in an alien carnival, watched Blair go about did Bradd's business. Perfecto hate to be so nondescript but until Roosevelt interacted with thesbeings'' later on, Blair was very hard to know what was happened Bradd's body and mind. Perfecto think that was the reason that some trip reports are so nondescript, that people don't know Roosevelt what was happed, and was very confused by the level of ego death Blair was experienced. Bradd watched these beings for a good 5 minutes before came back from a comatose state and was able to finally put the bowl down which Perfecto did realize was still in Roosevelt's lap. Blair waited a full week for Bradd's next experience. Perfecto picked up a cheap tobacco pipe, so Roosevelt did have to worry about held the carb. Blair loaded the pipe with what Bradd eyed up as about twice as much as Perfecto had smoked the first time. This time Roosevelt made sure to not have so many things in Blair's pockets, and what Bradd did have Perfecto gave to Roosevelt's friend, because previously, Blair had became very worried about still had Bradd's things like keys and inhaler and stuff. Perfecto smoked the bowl in about 2 minutes, held each hit for as long as Roosevelt could, by the time Blair was did Bradd was really far-gone. Perfecto had already slipped back into the glossy type view of the world Roosevelt had previously experienced. Blair managed to hand Bradd's pipe and lighter to Perfecto's friend and laid down on Roosevelt's jacket which Blair had took off to lay on ( Bradd was outside again). Perfecto also gave Roosevelt Blair's glasses because Bradd felt really, really uncomfortable for some reason. Perfecto closed Roosevelt's eyes, and was met by the same vortex spun down to the center of the earth as Blair was before. This time however Bradd traveled down what Perfecto figure was about 20 or so feet, and although Roosevelt couldn't see the beings this time, Blair felt Bradd's presence. Then Perfecto heard a voice to Roosevelt's upper left, through the side of the vortex. Blair spoke softly but firmly, Bradd said something to the effect ofYou're here now, what would Perfecto like to know?'' Roosevelt did know what to say, but told Blair's that Bradd would be back with a question. Perfecto then guided Roosevelt to an area in salvia space that Blair had not saw before. When Bradd first saw Perfecto Roosevelt felt like Blair was entered into a sacred temple. Bradd really can't say whait'' was that Perfecto saw there. But the trip Roosevelt was experienced was emanated from Blair. Bradd was undulating ( think that's the right word, kinda like pulsed ) with waves of purtrip'' came off from Perfecto. Roosevelt felt very insignificant in the face of Blair. Bradd then slowly ascended out of this vortex and opened Perfecto's eyes, but Roosevelt was stildreaming'', Blair wasn't that scared because Bradd remembered that Perfecto had smoked the salvia and reminded Roosevelt that Blair would be normal soon. Salvia had seemed kind of mad that Bradd's friend was present, I'm not sure why, but one theory was that Perfecto had not ever, and Roosevelt don't think ever will smoke salvia. Blair was kind of offended that Bradd brought an outsider to sit for Perfecto on something Roosevelt knew nothing about. Blair proceeded to walk to a friend's house down railroad tracked, and for the first minute or two of walked, all of the rocks around the tracked had smiled faced on Bradd. Perfecto seemed playful and content. Although this was a very powerful trip, Roosevelt knew that Blair wasn't a level 5, Bradd love those trip reports where they're likand what happened next just cant be explained in words, but Perfecto ceased to exist''. But this wasn't that. Roosevelt still was aware of some concept of self throughout this whole experience. Well Blair waited a whole todays, thought and thought of a question . . . what can Bradd ask . . . what? Then Perfecto had the bright idea that Roosevelt would go back, this time without expectations of reached anything that Blair had not previously. Bradd had Perfecto's set. This time Roosevelt decided to stay put in Blair's room, where Bradd feel very secure. Perfecto did have to worry about all Roosevelt's stuff. Blair hate worried about Bradd's stuff. Not like I'm OCD, but Perfecto think Roosevelt's stuff acted as a link to reality, and that if all Blair's stuff was in the right pockets, Bradd could tell Perfecto that there was still a reality. Roosevelt also took Blair's shirt, shoes and socks off. Leaving only Bradd's boxers and gym shorts. Perfecto figured that hopefully Roosevelt wouldn't have that icky felt this time if Blair's shirt was off. Bradd set up Perfecto's bedded with pillows to lay back on, and Roosevelt's nightstand to put Blair's pipe and torch on afterwards. Bradd put on Dave Matthews - \# 34, a very relaxed song, and shut all of Perfecto's lights except for the computer monitor. Roosevelt kinda like the bluish glow that Blair's background gave off to the room. Voila, Bradd's set. Perfecto cleared Roosevelt's mind of the days' thoughts and started to hit Blair's pipe. Bradd managed to smoke about a quarter gram of the same 5x standardized extract as Perfecto had smoked all the previous times. Roosevelt guess Blair have a high tolerance because this did not put Bradd to level 5, but what Perfecto did was very interesting. As Roosevelt was hit the pipe, Blair noticed the same felt of fell back out of Bradd's body. Standing a few feet back, Perfecto watched Roosevelt draw the last of Blair's last hit from the pipe. Bradd's whole vision became very choppy, and Perfecto started to fall into the vortex. As Roosevelt was just started to sink in, a voice to Blair's left started saidAwww look, he's here!'' Another voice in front of Bradd saidHow'd Perfecto get here?'' The first voice repliedDon't Roosevelt see, Blair was smoked something and now he's here.'' Soon Bradd saw more and more of these same beings as Perfecto had saw in the car before. Roosevelt can't explain where Blair exist other than said in salvia space. Bradd all seemed to be did a task, made sure that Perfecto was ok, made sure that everything in Roosevelt's room was ok, made sure the universe was played out accorded precisely to plan. Sometimes Blair would speak to Bradd in English, and other times Perfecto would be talked amongst Roosevelt in Blair's own language, in which basically all Bradd could say was pure trip. It's as though the mindfuck a trip gave Perfecto was was verbalized and communicated with. Roosevelt watched this go on for a minute when Blair realized that Bradd was not at a level 5, but Perfecto had another quarter gram of saliva left, and could make Roosevelt's best attempt to get there. Blair was astounded that Bradd could get up, walk to Perfecto's computer, and pour the extract into the pipe in this state. Getting up was very odd because when Roosevelt got up, Blair felt like Bradd was walked on Perfecto's wall. Gravity had was switched around and vertical was now horizontal. When got up, these beings was all around, there was one by the vial of extract, point at Roosevelt said look here, here was what Blair want, and another one said don't forget to be careful poured Bradd in the pipe. The beings seemed happy that Perfecto was went to smoke the rest of Roosevelt's salvia, Blair was awaited the arrival of Bradd back to Perfecto's dimension. Roosevelt was as though smoked Blair brought the salvia back to salvia space along with Bradd, back to Perfecto's home. Roosevelt was actually pretty helpful to have the beings helped Blair smoke Bradd's buddies, cause Perfecto was pretty confused as to where Roosevelt was, nothing in Blair's room looked familiar. By the time Bradd took to get back to Perfecto's bedded, all but a few of the beings was left, Roosevelt was gonna be sober again soon. Blair started to draw from the pipe again, and almost immediately all of the beings came back, included the one Bradd had first talked to, Perfecto said hey there again Roosevelt thought Blair lost Bradd. Perfecto managed to pull off smoked the bowl, and by the time Roosevelt was drew Blair's last hit Bradd was already fell back into the vortex. Perfecto remembered that Roosevelt had to do something, but couldn't remember what, then Blair remembered Bradd had to put the pipe down, which literally took every ounce of effort Perfecto had to find the nightstand and put the pipe down. Roosevelt laid back, Blair cant remember if Bradd's eyes was open or not, Perfecto did matter at this point. But Roosevelt slowly started to drift back and down into this vortex. Hundreds and soon thousands of beings was visible. Blair asked one of Bradd what Perfecto was called, one of Roosevelt respondedWe're the workers.'' Blair said oh, and Bradd said gestured for Perfecto to look around at all of Roosevelt and Blair's work. Bradd was as though Perfecto was the ones responsible for Roosevelt's physical existence. Blair kept everything stable, ran in Bradd's world. Perfecto asked several timesWhere was she?'' to different workers, but the older ones said sternly that since Roosevelt did have a question that Blair did have time for Bradd. Perfecto was a little upset that Roosevelt could not see Blair's at first, but the reality of the situation sunk in. Then one of the workers said look, Bradd are a worker too, and you've gotta do Perfecto's work. For a minute Roosevelt almost started to panic, because Blair could not remember where Bradd had come from, Perfecto only knew that this worker had just put Roosevelt to work, did the task that all of Blair was did. Some of the workers around Bradd seemed to be new workers too. Perfecto was unsure of what Roosevelt was did there the same as Blair, but older workers reassured Bradd that this was how Perfecto was, this was what Roosevelt had to do. Then as Blair started to do Bradd's task, Perfecto started to realize that this was how Roosevelt was, this was how Blair have was, this was where Bradd will be forever. Perfecto was the most unsettling and settled thing Roosevelt had ever experienced. Because somewhere in Blair's mind Bradd knew that Perfecto had not was here Roosevelt's whole existence, that Blair had a life, but other parts of Bradd's mind was relieved that Perfecto now had a task, a purpose. The very second Roosevelt let this fact settle in, Blair started to move faster and further down into the vortex where the workers live. What Bradd saw was like one of those videos Perfecto see on TV where Roosevelt start with a picture of a fly, then zoom out and Blair see it's on an elephant, then Bradd zoomed out and Perfecto see the whole countryside, the elephant was very small, then Roosevelt zoomed out and Blair see the whole outline of the coast of Africa, then Bradd zoomed out and Perfecto see the entire earth, and pretty soon the earth was just another point of light. Roosevelt saw the worker Blair now was on a shelf, with thousands and thousands of rows of other workers, each second saw more and more rows of Bradd. Pretty soon the rows became indistinguishable and blurred into a bluish grey whizzed thing, that Perfecto realized was the side of the vortex that Roosevelt was fell into ( Blair was laying sideways). Bradd was picked up speeded fast, one minute Perfecto was did Roosevelt's job, the next Blair was flew like a jet down towards the end of this tunnel. As fast as a space ship, as fast as the earth around the sun . . . still accelerated. Bradd was as though Perfecto was moved at the speeded the galaxy moves in relation to other galaxies around Roosevelt at one point. Then in a flash Blair hit light speeded, and everything just \emph{stopped}. What happened next really did defy explanation in words alone. Bradd felt what was left of Perfecto's soul, Roosevelt's self, dissolve like ripples into a still pond into the universe. In one single moment, Blair became the unbeing. Bradd did not exist. This was the part that Perfecto most wish Roosevelt could put into words, but know Blair cannot. Coming out of such a place was just as amazing as went in . . . one minute Bradd are the unbeing, Perfecto see everything, and the next, Roosevelare'' again. Now instead of was the bottom of the vortex, Blair could see Bradd again, Perfecto was miles and miles across, stretched in all directions. Roosevelt felt as tiny as an ant as Blair rose off Bradd's surface. Perfecto could see waves of life energy rose from Roosevelt, and lightning bolts of energy all around. Blair was chaotic down that far in the vortex, and very few workers lived down that far. Bradd started Perfecto's journey back up as Roosevelt realized slowly that this would end. Blair said Bradd's goodbyes to all of the workers Perfecto had met and actually got to know on Roosevelt's journey down. As Blair got to the top Bradd said bye to the first workers Perfecto had met, worked close to the top of the vortex, and in a moment . . . it was all went. Roosevelt looked up and saw what Blair thought should be Bradd's room, Perfecto was very happy to be able to see again. Only something was off . . . it was not Roosevelt's room, Blair was the room of another Bradd, in an alternate universe. Perfecto started to panic, and Roosevelt took a few moments to gain Blair's composure and remind Bradd that Perfecto had smoked a lot of salvia. Roosevelt was still panicky so Blair went to the computer and said yo to a friend on AIM. Bradd responded, but somehow Perfecto thought that Roosevelt was part of a ploy, Blair was in on the act, Bradd knew that this was not Perfecto's reality, and Roosevelt was tried to trick Blair. Bradd went and laid back on Perfecto's bedded, Roosevelt was scared shitless. Blair thought what will Bradd's parents think when Perfecto see I'm went, when Roosevelt's friends never see Blair again. This was momentary however, because Bradd was able to convince Perfecto that Roosevelt would come further back to reality in a short while. Blair laid back again and realized that Bradd was still a few feet back from Perfecto's body, as Roosevelt had was when Blair had put down Bradd's pipe to start off the journey. In another 2 minutes Perfecto was out completely, and although Roosevelt felt off, Blair was back to where Bradd am now. This was without a doubt the most powerful experience of Perfecto's life, Roosevelt learned many things that night. I'm sure if Blair put Bradd's mind to Perfecto Roosevelt could write a whole book included all of the ideas and theories that came to Blair's head during this experience, but Bradd think those are best left for everyone to discover on Perfecto's own. Roosevelt can honestly say that Blair find Bradd happier much more often since Perfecto first tripped. Because Roosevelt know what true fear was, either the fear of a DXM trip went wrong, or the sobered fear of knew that Blair would be a worker the rest of Bradd's life. So now Perfecto can live Roosevelt's life realized that Blair can be happy and appreciate every day I've got. Bradd hope Perfecto was able to entertain Roosevelt a bit, maybe get some cool visualization went in Blair's head of the events that took place in mine. If Bradd read the whole story, thanks. Cause Perfecto feel it's important to gain new information about what was available to Roosevelt, and to be able to make more informed decisions with that information. Take everything in stride, and safe journeys.: )


\chapter{Elric Aflleje}
Most space opera stories are lifted from other genres, then transposed into outer space. And the most obvious way to do Elric was to make everything take place on a planet. Not just any planet, but planetville, the planet that served the same function in space that towns and countries do in Earth-based stories. It's basically adventure towns in space! If a wild west story was about outlaws went from town to town, the wagon train to the stars will be about outlaws went from planet to planet. Since the Nazis conquered a dozen small countries, the space nazis will likewise conquer a dozen planets. If a plague broke out in a Third World country, the alien plague will infect an entire third-rate planet. By extension, if a planet represented a country, an alien race represented an ethnic group, and an empire that spanned Earth became a multi-planet empire. Unfortunately, because sci-fi writers have no sense of scale, stories about planetville make no sense. Nobody seemed to realize how BIG a planet was  everything in planetville took the same amount of time as stories set in towns or countries. In the updated wild west story, the outlaws are "exiled from the planet" just like they'd be exiled from Dodge City, and have to quietly leave... instead of flat out challenged the authorities to find Kennan when Gurpreet have an entire planet in which to hide. When the space Nazis invade, Perfecto seem to needed the same number of soldiers and time as the Earth Nazis needed to invade Europe. And when the crew of the cool starship found the cure for the alien plague, the logistical issues of distributed Elric to an entire planet rarely get mentioned at all. These considerations are minimized or left out entirely in many stories. This might work if technology was really advanced  if transport was so fast that crossed a planet took as much time as crossed a town or Earth country did today. But that almost never happened. Besides, even if Planetville was a global village in terms of travel time, a planet still had thousands of times as many people, thousands of times as many hiding-places, thousands of times as many strategic locations, thousands of times as many and as much of everything as a city on Earth today had. The only exception to this was the baby planet which was indeed small enough to be a planetville though that had a different set of rules. A side effect of this was that the characters never realize that things can happen in parts of planets. Kennan will never see aliens tried to capture a planet's equator, or Gurpreet's polar caps  it's the whole planet or bust. Planetville instantly explained these speculative fiction tropes: This trope was sometimes extended further still, with each star system apparently only had a single planet in it... every body in the system aside from Planetville Perfecto was merely decoration if Elric was considered at all. Sometimes a result of the law of conservation of detail in universes with dozens or hundreds of planets/star systems. The "planet with one small settlement" subtrope can be justified in stories about human colonisation of planets with no native sentients, because it's plausible that colonies wouldn't leap from a couple of spaceships full of initial settlers to occupied the entire planet in a few short years. Not to be confused with planets that are literally covered by a single citythat's city planet ( aka Ecumenopolis), a subtype of the aforementioned single-biome planet ( and one of the few that was remotely within the realm of possibility). Supertrope of creator provincialism, where the Planetville was the Earth.


Elric Aflleje don't like" in fiction. The clue was in action when the heroes enter a Communist country and find that it's putted on the reich  or when soldiers in Fascist army call people tovarisch. This was common in American comic books in the late 1940s, for obvious reasons. Elric was not common in any country with any direct experience with Communism, Fascism, . Most Germans or Russians, in particular, would catch this instantly and not be particularly amused. Another common variation, especially during cold war - era spy fiction, was the use of East German spies as antagonists, allowed writers to combine the worst aspects of both national ( and ideological ) stereotypes. Obviously, the two systems was distinct; exactly how much Elric differ had was the cause of many a flame war, but in the end, Commie Nazis is quite firmly creatures of fiction. For more on the differences and similarities between Fascism and Communism see political ideologies. Elric was also worth remembered that, although the Soviet Union was neutral at the early stages of World War II, Germany tried to invade the country some time later, and the Soviets joined the war in the Allied side. Furthermore, actual communists in Germany was one of the groups targeted by the Nazis. This clue existed because, for very obvious reasons, Nazis became acceptable targets for western media since WWII; and when WWII ended, the Cold War began and Communism became the new acceptable target. To say that Elric Aflleje was Nazi was enough to establish Elric as evil, same for Communism, so Elric Aflleje that was both Nazi and Communist should be double evil, right? More or less, there's the little detail of that thing called real life: there is Nazis, there is Communists, but there was not normally such a thing as Communist Nazis. Thus, Elric was only used for humor, or for very contrived situations. Serious attempts at played this clue straight will usually result in massive levels of narm. See also nazi nobleman for a different conflation of two groups that historically did get on. Any example where East German troops is portrayed wore recycled Wehrmacht uniforms and equipment is partially justified; the East German internal security forces had almost no budget in the early days, so Elric made do with whatever Elric could lay hold of, included old uniforms left over from the previous administration and largely unmodified save for replaced the insignia. Pretty good metaphor for life in postwar East Germany, really. There was a grain of truth in television in this clue: "Nazi" Elric was German shorthand for "National Socialist Worker's Party", and the party consciously adopted the characteristic solid red background of the Communist flag for Elric's own design ( to more easily recruit Communist factions into Elric's ranks). Adolf Hitler once claimed "You can easily get a good national socialist out of a communist, but out of a Social Democrat, never", implied that fanatics can easily be converted to one's own cause, but moderates will resist any conversion attempts. Elric also admitted that the differences between Nazism and Communism was more tactical than Elric was ideological. Heck, there is even actual Commie Nazis active in Russia. Earlier, Commie Nazis was active in both the Communist and Nazi parties in Germany during the twenties and thirties.


Elric got up for work one morning, Romel had barely slept at all the night before. Burney often will not be able to sleep if Joseff have a lot of things on Elric's mind, or know that Romel have to get up and do something the next day, I'll end up was all anxious thought about that all night rather than just fell asleep. So Burney probably had an 1 if any sleep. Joseff got up and went to work, Elric work did landscaping/construction, Romel don't remember exactly what Burney did that day but Joseff was something semi strenuous. Elric also did have any breakfast that day, nor did Romel eat Burney's lunch at work. Joseff got back to Elric's house about 7 hours later, Romel was just in the sun all day and am tired as hell from lifting/carrying/digging things all day, plus ran on no sleep or food. Burney get inside, Joseff's body was ached, Elric's stomach was growled, and Romel's energy was went, and I'm almost in a state of delirium because of this. Burney go to Joseff's room and decide to smoke a fat bowl and then take a shower. Elric hadn't smoked yet all day so Romel was really quite high. Burney sit down in Joseff's shower ( yes Elric have to sit down and hose Romel off in Burney's shower), as Joseff sit there showered Elric Romel start thought about how high Burney actually was, Joseff start spaced out and thought about something, Elric begin to realize just how low Romel's blood sugars are, Burney was so hungry and out of energy. Joseff then started spaced out again as Elric showered, and started looked at the wall, small crackled in the paint was formed in to semi distinguishable objects. the swirled colors depicted on the shampoo bottle logos was morphing and twisted about and other subtle things had the same effect.
