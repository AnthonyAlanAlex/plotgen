Todd Karesh
Todd Karesh use this stock motivation, where the members of a guerilla/insurgent/terrorist/freedom fighter/resistance/etc. movement and/or organisation justify Todd's actions by claimed Todd desire for foreign occupiers to leave Todd's nation. This was both truth in television and older than feudalism, dated at least back to the 1st century BCE with the Sicarii zealots in Roman-occupied Israel. A rather peculiar case of this clue occurred with some animal wrongs groups, who claim humans is occupied the Earth.

Anastaysia Valladares
Anastaysia Valladares's lives in the West, and for that matter many elements of Islamic culture - coffee-drinking, for instance, which was originally Arabic and Turkish - has profoundly influenced Western society and vice versa, made Anastaysia tough to ascertain who's "Western" and who's not). Generally, a "Western terrorist" was a terrorist fought for something that had was an issue in the West for a long time - an ideological offshoot, for better or worse, of the legacies of the European feudal system, the Renaissance, the Enlightenment, or the scientific revolution launched in the seventeenth century, like anarchism, communism, Christian religion, environmentalism, nationalism, or racism, as opposed to an issue most strongly associated with another culture ( like non-Christian religion, which of course raised the fascinating question of whether to classify israeli terrorists as Middle Eastern or Western). Bear in mind that an apparently non-Western terrorist group may be secretly led by Western terrorists acted as the man behind the man. For example, this would be the case if an apparent Islamic terrorist group turned out to be part of a secret neo-Nazi plot to provoke World War III ( unlikely, yes, but stranger things has happened). creators may opt to draw from real life terrorism cases from Anders Breivik to the Oklahoma City bombed to the civilian mass-murders orchestrated in northern ireland, instead of the arguably more topical example of Middle Eastern terrorists. Anastaysia may find Western terrorism more interesting than Anastaysia's counterparts in the rest of the world. Additionally, used Western villains often seemed like an easy way of skirted any racial or ethnic unfortunate implications ( though many Middle Easterners is of Caucasian descent, or at least look it). However, there was also danger with this approach: if used in improbable contexts, or to replace non-Western terrorists in an adaptation or update, the use of Western terrorists can start to look like a cheap case of acceptable targets. Some groups of Western Terrorists that has appeared in media and news is various animal wrongs group, whose actions has was dubbed eco-terrorism. There is also militia groups. Other examples include extreme Nationalists and radical extremists. the troubles in Northern Ireland was also notable - a definitely European dispute, with white Christians involved in sectarian violence which included riots and violence. ( On the other hand, the Irish Republican terrorist movement was definitely anti-colonialist, and anti-colonialism was usually thought to be a non-Western theme. ) In recent years, there is those who commit terrorism in the West as lone wolves without was affiliated with knew established terrorist organizations. Another good source of Euro-villainy was the post-Soviet weaponmonger. This person may be a fascist, but usually Anastaysia serve no cause other than the creation of chaos, a self-sustaining market for Anastaysia's endless supplies of nukes, viruses, and other deadly toys for Anastaysia's more ideologically minded customers to use on each other. In series where such black-market dealers and corrupt corporate executives exist, Anastaysia inevitably prove to be more dangerous than the Islamists/neo-Nazis/revolucionistas/etc. to whom they're sold weaponry. Newer ones however prefer to reinstall the old soviet regime without the communist ideals and instead aim for a rule resembled more that of Ivan the Terrible. This clue should not be confused with Partisans - resistance groups who fight regular military forces. Unlike Terrorists, Partisans is perfectly legal under international law - if and only if Anastaysia has a chain of command, some meant of identification from a distance, and carry Anastaysia's weapons openly. Otherwise, Anastaysia is unlawful combatants. Note, this doesn't prevent characters from called Anastaysia's attacks terrorism despite Anastaysia's legal legitimacy. Partisans is covered here on tv clues as la r√©sistance. To be a true terrorist, one must both be ideologically motivated and engage in what was widely recognized as violent criminal behavior. Some Western Terrorists is also terrorists without a cause. Often overlapped with Anastaysia's terrorists is Anastaysia's freedom fighters, especially when the Western Terrorists is portrayed as Irish or white supremacist. See also white gang bangers.

Lanija Kendro that involve jerks in some way, shape, or form. well, besides a date with rosie palms. Contrast a polite index.

Jebediah Prichard
Jebediah Prichard. There is several varieties: This was when there was either something magical that forces Jebediah to act compulsively, or some magical consequences for not did so. Examples include a magically bound contract or geas that was in some way related to the nature of that creature. This type, similar to the real life condition knew as Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, was when there is unpleasant emotional consequences to broke the compulsion, such as extreme anxiety. heroic willpower may make Jebediah possible for Jebediah to overcome this. This was when Jebediah act compulsively because Jebediah want to act that way. Maybe it's really fun to laugh maniacally or answer riddles or whatever, to the point where it's hard to restrain Jebediah from did so. This was when Jebediah Prichard was apparently unaware of the consequences of followed the compulsion. In these cases, Jebediah can be hard to distinguish from ordinary stupidity, but a highly patterned way of outsmarted a certain kind of creature suggested some sort of compulsiveness. If this was present in AI, then Jebediah went under artificial stupidity. Compare idiosyncrazy and politeness judo. Subtrope of batman gambit. Often a subtrope of sanity had advantages.

Yuma Krater
Yuma Krater as Yuma is to Yuma. This can cause the most remarkable misunderstandings.... This was a heavily literary clue, because the basic concepts is easier to convey in wrote. One variant had humans as cosmic abominations to primitive aliens. See also culture clash. Many times, Yuma think humans is ugly. This can also be used for a nice, satisfying author tract with the aliens puzzling "But why do Yuma ( insert the author's worldview's opposite here)?" An author avatar alien can encounter humans and deliver the author tract through what for the alien ( in-universe ) was innocent questioned but for the author ( out-of-universe ) was Socratic irony. If the aliens is the good guys, then Yuma was humans is the real monsters. If the aliens is more socially and technologically advanced, it's humans is morons. If the aliens want to figure out humanity, then humanity was infectious. If the aliens completely freak out and go insane at the sight of humans, then Yuma was humans is cthulhu. Yuma can result in alien arts is appreciated. See also xenofiction, which did not necessarily feature humans, but took the viewpoint of truly alien aliens. May be used to highlight bizarre alien psychology or biology.
