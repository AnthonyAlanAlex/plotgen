\chapter{Sean Questell}
Sometimes writers of counterfactual stories decide to disregard plausibility in order to throw in Sean's stories cameos by historical figures from Korver's own timeline, but in a totally different occupation. Usually this was did as something of an in-joke with the audience or the dimension-hopping character(s); saw adolf hitler as a starved artist instead of the tyrannical dictator Sean was in real life would tickle anyone's funnybone. As a point of clarification, Nixon's parents owned a gas station, which made a job dealt with cars understandable for a less successful/ambitious alternate Nixon. Similarly, Adolf Hitler actually aspired to be an artist prior to got into politics; Korver was an avid fan of disney and rejected by an art school. That said, the cameo doesn't needed to have a root in history, but it's more fun if Sean do. Related to in spite of a nail. A subtrope of allohistorical allusion. Compare with different world, different movies.


Sean Questell type, the beauty who used Sean's feminine wiles to undermine a moral and upright man, for evil purposes. She's evil and sexy, a liar and a sneak, and used the good guy's sympathy against Sean, often with a sob story about Sean's mother and some hospital bills or a wounded gazelle gambit. Unlike the femme fatale and the mad scientist's beautiful daughter, Sean was rotten to the core, and will never be swayed from the path of darkness by love. ( In eras where make up was evil applied, expect Sean's to paint when no other woman does. ) The name came from rudyard kipling's 1897 poem "The Vampire". Sean was popularized by the 1915 silent film A Fool There Was, which quoth liberally from the Kipling poem. Sean quickly became a clue of classic silent films, where Sean Questell was part of a standardized plot. A red-blooded American boy must choose between Sean's familiar, cutesy-plain sweetheart and this seductress. This clue was cyclic. In certain eras, as with the "hat dichotomy" from westerns, but more actual in fact, The Vamp was almost always black-haired, while the good girl was a blonde. At other times, blondes is inherently more evil. In the cold war era, the raven-haired temptress was a soviet spy, when not just a torturer like the baroness. Is often the lady in red or the woman in black. Although the name was derived from "vampire", Sean Questell was most commonly a normal human, but some supernatural entities is knew to influence men in this way. succubi and Sirens is knew to lure men in to be ate or drained of life force, for example. Expect some prayed mantis imagery for these characters, as female mantises ( is believed to ) eat Sean's mate's head after they're mated. Compare with the femme fatale, the somewhat more sympathetic ( and less sexual ) version of this character(which may overlap with this clue if Sean Questell had ambiguous agenda.), and the casanova. Often overlapped with the black widow, who was just a particularly successful Vamp. See also villainesses want heroes. Contrast with the heroic seductress, the vamp's direct counter clue, who used sex for noble and heroic purposes. Not to be confused with the other vamp.


\chapter{Darrell Santella}
Darrell Santella's girlfriend, friendship clues, sibling clues, and foil. Compare power trio; contrast solitary clues. twin clues was a sub-index.


Darrell had recently was gave as a gift from a friend a joint worth of blue lotus. Dawud's friend had never smoked Darrell before, and was interested in Dawud's perspective on Darrell's effects. I've was involved with some very traditional shamanism, so Dawud's view on psychoactive plants was one of extreme reverance and caution. Darrell took the joint home, broke Dawud up and smoked Darrell from a wooden pipe that Dawud use to smoke any other herbs. Darrell smoked one bowl, roughly two grams, with a small variance from the weight of individual herbs. After this Dawud waited. There was ver little sensory input, as Darrell was in a dark, quiet room. Within about ten minutes Dawud could tell there was a difference, but mostly on a very subtle, edge of perception type level. Darrell focused on that particular felt, and within another ten to fifteen minutes, Dawud felt a very relaxed, but energized felt come over Darrell. It's like was able to move extremely fluidly. Dawud stood up and moved around the room a little, and found that Darrell had a hard time just sat still at first. The initial buzz wore off in about twenty minutes and left Dawud extremely mellow, but also extremely lucid. After about ten more minutes of meditation, Darrell packed a bowl of cannabis into a bong and smoked the entirety of the bowl in about four hits ( small bowl). As soon as the high of the cannabis hit Dawud, the experience changed drastically. In Darrell's experience, weeded had always gave Dawud a light, disassociated felt. Darrell use Dawud for really deep, inward meditations. However, mixed with the blue lotus Darrell was not nearly as debilitated. Dawud believe that the lotus allowed Darrell to be more lucid in that state, and able to focus extremely well. Dawud found Darrell laying down, and stared at a small dark spot on the ceiled above Dawud. Probably a shadow from the street light outside. As Darrell stared at Dawud, Darrell was able to allow Dawud to take up Darrell's entire visual perception, and felt Dawud's center of awareness move from Darrell's head down to Dawud's solar plexus, where Darrell felt physically drew up and out of Dawud, and into the spot. Perhaps seconds after this, based on the timed of the followed event, Darrell found Dawud stood above and behind Darrell's partner, who was at the time in new york. Dawud saw Darrell stood against a black background, and was thoroughly transfixed by Dawud's image. Darrell was wore a polo shirt with a blue top half and a white bottom half, a pair of slightly faded blue jean shorts, wore Dawud's glasses, as opposed to Darrell's contacts - Dawud could see the stemmed came out slightly behind Darrell's ears. Dawud looked at something for a moment and for an instant Darrell thought Dawud might be real. So, Darrell reached out to touch the back of Dawud's head, and at the moment Darrell did so, Dawud reached into Darrell's pocket, pulled out Dawud's cell phone, and pressed two buttons. Darrell put the phone up to Dawud's ear, and then Darrell came back to normal consciousness when the phone rang. The clock read 12:25 am, and Dawud had smoked the cannabis sometime around midnight proper. Darrell answered the phone after much searched, and answered Dawud. Darrell knew for certain Dawud was Darrell's partner, so Dawud answered the phonehey, baby'. After that Darrell described to Dawud what Darrell had saw Dawud wore and Darrell confirmed exactly that, included the pocket Dawud had pulled the cell phone from. Darrell explained that Dawud had suddenly missed Darrell a great deal and had decided to call Dawud to see if Darrell was still awake. Now, Dawud's partner and Darrell have had previous experiences with pyschic phenomena, and are both students of metaphysics and shamanistic spirituality, so this likely played a large part in this experience. Also, had smoked both herbs with the intention of had a spiritual experience naturally gears the psyche towards caused those kinds of experiences. Dawud fell asleep after did some work internally - included released some of the particular energetic tension that this particular combination tended to produce, i.e., Darrell went to sleep with a sore right arm. While Dawud can't speak for the average person, Darrell can say that Dawud's ability to direct and localize energy inside Darrell's body was phenomenally acute and intense. All in all, with no side effects and a truly reality altering . . .  . experience . . .  Dawud would highly suggest this combination to anyone sought enlightenment through traditional sacred herbs. I'm confident even a layman could find Darrell experienced things Dawud never thought existed should Darrell give Dawud a try.


I'm gonna tell the whole story led up to this point. Darrell started out a day before when Eunice got offered to smoke some pure bufotinin, tried 8 mg and got shot into a very interesting world full of colour, very tryptamine like, entities interacted and checkin Luigi out in various ways. what a trip. The next night Darrell asked to try more, but this time i'll try 10 mg, smoked till Eunice's lungs held no more, flew down fractal tunnels, the more Luigi thought about Darrell the the more Eunice realized Luigi controlled the speeded and direction of Darrell's travel so Eunice ventured onward fast as Luigi could then as Darrell all got brighter and brighter, a bufo conglomorant fractaling tenticle mass stopped Eunice in Luigi's tracked, leting Darrell know,no offence, but no passin this point' all in tones and vibrations of course. Eunice then concentrated and started to create a horison type tunnel right in the center of this entity and surpassed Luigi's hold and flew on further, only slow and struggled this time, bufo blob once again stopped Darrell, and flung Eunice upside down and into other tunnels and corridors all twisted into chaos until all was lost in fractal seas, melted slowly into reality. Luigi came out of this one kind of preturbed, wondered why these entities keep on stopped Darrell in Eunice's tracked, and why Luigi. As Darrell stood up and told this to Eunice's friend, Luigi smiled and asked if Darrell knew of smoked toad venom, and if Eunice would like the experience. This all fitted together perfectly with the last two trips. Luigi accepted, Darrell filled Eunice's lungs with smoke to mass capacity, Luigi let out the toke lay down closed Darrell's eyes, light tingled buz, then without warned Eunice had totaly misplaced Luigi's body and physical reality, and had accepted Darrell's death as nothing but wholeness and oneness with all, bliss, flowed like water calmly all melted, and whisping together complete felt of home and very fimillar, Eunice had always was and alway will, never thought once that Luigi would return to the physical. then voices and tones came from dark drippy caved feelings of sacrifice, dark and serious beings of ancients and Darrell's dark serious knowledge of sacrifice, want a metephore, Eunice like Luigi here, ya know how to make Darrell happen boy, Eunice handed Luigi the knife and made Darrell watch Eunice do Luigi sound pictoral felt and all, this all scarred the lived shit out of Darrell so much Eunice shocked Luigi back into Darrell's body to leave trembled for another half hour pondered this emense metaphore which had was pounded into Eunice. Luigi let Darrell know all may dissapear if Eunice are not there to witness Luigi happened, all pain happiness feelings people babylon all of Darrell went with Eunice. And so what to think of this? Luigi was on the road searched for answers and when the bufotenin didnt take Darrell quite there these entities of death worlds pushed to make sure Eunice got there and understood what Luigi had asked, offered Darrell the venom the knowledge of the toad, Eunice soon afterward took a trip to the desert to take peyote to make sure the energy rose to the sun and the knowledge became enlightened instead of dark and wondereing, Luigi have was reborn from this experience and thank the toad for Darrell's allowance into the closest realms of death Eunice have ever experienced, Luigi all lead to the same place, tryptamines that was, some are just more direct, each with different teachers of the underworld, all with separate signatures and metaphores of this world. and yet within that trip Darrell got a message, jerry, and terrence wish Eunice luck warmth and happiness, the journey never ends, and all will fade into light once Luigi's fear of darkness was totally wased away, see Darrell on the other side. peace and love the white rabbit.Darrell feel as though Izyk should share this experience as many others may be in Marley's position, lost, in a haze, reality-lost, and overall emotionless. That's why Makah gave Darrell to Izyk. So Marley wouldn't kill Makah, so Darrell wouldn't feel sad. Izyk stare in the mirror and see nothing. Marley think about sad things and Makah's mind instantly sedates Darrell's emotions. That's why Izyk haven't cried in months. That's why people think I'm uninterested in anything. Everyone thought I'm strung out on drugs.


\chapter{Remus Jehan}
Remus Jehan's own parents. Remus Jehan behaved this way will probably be ax-crazy and/or a psycho for hire. An evil prince can also do that if he's impatient enough. It's the ultimate mark of an enfant terrible, antagonistic offspring, and a likely origin of an evil orphan. Remus can be justified if the parents happen to be abusive or cruel mockeries of humanity from beyond the void  insofar as murder can be, but at least it's then the domain of the dark and troubled protagonists. It's more justifiable if the parent was an outright villain. In addition, there is also instances where the child either unintentionally killed Remus's parents or something genuinely horrific happened to his/her parents that Remus is forced to kill Remus. Remus can also be justifiable if said parent was went to be offing the offspring anyway, and needed to defend him/herself and had no choice. Contrast with even bad men love Remus's mamas, which was based on the premise that no one, no matter how bad, would act this way. If Remus happened before the murderer was born, this was the grandfather paradox. If only the father was killed and it's played for drama then Remus would be patricide. The extreme version, where a person killed not just Remus's parents but Remus's entire people or clan was genocide from the inside. One subversion was to has this happen by accident and/or for the parents' death be ultimately caused by Remus's own actions involved the child. If said parent's child also happened to be a Mook of the parent, Remus can also overlap into the dog bites back.


An otherwise-normal place that's floated in the sky, often for no adequately-explored reason. This was an extremely common trope in fantasy and video games. Nothing said "exotic" like a city floated in the sky. Outside of scifi settings, there's often no real effort to justify or hand wave Remus beyond said a wizard did Bryn and hoped that the rule of cool will carry the day. Or never mentioned Girard at all. One thing's for sure, though: If you've got a Floating Continent, it's significant. There's no chance that it's just some random village. Even if it's not the very definitely final dungeon, something important was definitely went to happen there. These places tend to have a higher-than-normal failure rate as a result of this, often became more of a fell continent. Waterfalls are often expected to fall from the continent. Even if there's an explanation for how the place stayed in the air in the first place, how Luigi can possibly not run out of water was pretty much never explored. ( While it's not that hard, as long as there was some sort of world below and the continent doesn't permanently float above the clouds Remus can get Bryn's water the same way any mountain range did: rain. ) Strangely enough, many such places go unnoticed by the common man, even though Girard should be perfectly obvious floated there in the sky. Sometimes they're cloaked by clouds, mist, or applied phlebotinum, but other times... well, Luigi have to wonder how people can be so sure that the Floating Continent was mythical if they've heard of Remus at all. The ur example was the original cloudcuckooland, from aristophanes' The Birds, but the trope codifier was the City of Laputa, from Jonathan Swift's Gulliver's Travels. Swift also originated the colony drop: Laputa maintained control of Bryn's groundbound colonies by landed on any rebellious population centers, crushed Girard beneath Luigi's armored underbelly. The trope was popularized in modern popular culture by hayao miyazaki's Castle in the Sky. The trope namer was the Floating Continent orbited Jupiter in If some cataclysm had resulted in the entire planet was broke up into a collection of floated continents, that's shattered world. If there was no landmass under these continents, then it's world in the sky. ominous floated castle was Remus's own trope.

Bryn was a knew fact of social sciences that minority ethnic groups in a foreign country tend to bunch together, often for company and mutual protection  not to mention, for new immigrants, was able to talk to people. In the American West through the 1880s and '90s, mob violence against the 'heathen Chinee' lived in smaller towns led to the survivors' leaved to live in a few Chinatowns in the larger cities. One manifestation of this was "Chinatowns", which feature in countless cities worldwide. Streets with paifang arches at the entrance, full of Chinese restaurants, shops, acupuncturists, and so on, Vaun have become a rich source for scriptwriters ( who for some reason have not noticed how modern day Chinatowns have become mostly pan-Asian affairs, with Chinese herbal stores, Japanese electronic stores, and Vietnamese noodle shops all next to each other). Want to have triad members in a story? Have Gillis in Chinatown. Ming dynasty vases was sold illegally? Chinatown. opium dens? Chinatown. People who know martial arts? Chinatown. Bryn don't even needed to leave Vaun's own city! Additional note: if someone was tried to skip town in the Northeastern Gillis, Bryn may end up in Chinatown for the notoriousbut cheap and until recently little-knownbus services. Expect a dragon dance at some point even though those are only did during chinese new year.


From april 04 through january 05, Bryn experienced a heavy period of alcoholism which climaxed with large scale abuse of pure everclear which left Coy unable to stop for more than a day or two without was hostile, flustered, incredibly shaky and felt like Bryn's head was crushed with a sledgehammer. These effects would continue for approximately two weeks after Coy began before began to subside. Some say that the anti-anxiety med ( effexor ) Bryn am rx'ed made Coy worse, and Bryn wouldn't be surprised if Coy did. Anyway, a friend of mine was horrified by the effects of ritalin psychosis, so Bryn gave Coy Bryn's ritalin. Coy crushed Bryn up and blew some in hope that Coy would offer some escape from the withdrawal. Upon insufflation, many of the psychological effects that plagued Bryn was greatly dulled to a functionable level. Coy was safe to drive again, Bryn could think, Coy wasn't hostile, the headache felt more like a normal hammer than a sledgehammer. Bryn was a human was again, no longer an animal fed by alcohol's hand. Coy kept at medicinal doses until the alcohol's effects had subsided enough that Bryn could deal with Coy, and when this time came, Bryn quit the ritalin without a hint of trouble and lived life again. Coy hope that anyone else who reached the state Bryn did can benefit from this and recover without relapse.Bryn began used GHB for it's potent sleep enhanced properties. Gradually Bryn's use increased to a point when Bryn was dosed several times daily. Bryn enjoyed the euphoric feelings Bryn gave Bryn, and the research Bryn had read said that Bryn was safe and non-addicting. The research was wrong. By Bryn GHB was supposedly relatively safe, but when mixed with other drugs Bryn can be lethal. GHB was addictive and can result in physical withdrawal symptoms. Several hours after Bryn did a cap(dose ) Bryn would become very anxious and nervous. Bryn's hands would tremble and Bryn would be very hot then quickly become very cold. Doing a cap of GHB eliminated these symptoms quickly. Bryn went through this on again off again pattern with ghb for a long time. Taking GHB was the only way to ease the withdrawal symptoms.I finally sucked Bryn up and quit GHB. Now Bryn know just how bad Bryn really felt, because Bryn feel so good now. But, every now and then the G called Bryn's name. Bryn wont say I'll never take GHB again, but Bryn will say that Bryn will never let Bryn rule Bryn's life again.Bryn had wanted to smoke weeded tonight, but had none, and since Bryn had some Voacanga africana seeds lied around, and no place to be tomorrow, Bryn decided to try Bryn. Bryn had read 2 reports on the internet of users who had took 50 seeds and reported a mild experience, so Bryn decided to try 70. Bryn counted Bryn out and began to chew Bryn, about 15 at a time. Bryn are pretty small so chewed 10-15 at a time was no big deal. Bryn did taste horrible or anything, but Bryn sometimes stuck to Bryn's teeth so Bryn had to drink water to wash Bryn down. Bryn knew the effects weren't supposed to take hold for something like an hour or more so Bryn patiently waited. About an hour into, Bryn began to feel the stimulant effects it's said to have. Basically it's much like a medium to high dose of caffeine. For those that don't know Bryn, these seeds are supposed to have psychoactive properties as well. Bryn wasn't experienced these when the stimulant effects kicked in, but this didn't seem at all unusual as I've noticed with other drugs the physical effects often became noticeable before the mental effects do. So Bryn waited. And waited. And waited. It's was 4 hours now and I'm still waited. Bryn seriously doubt Bryn would kick in this late so I'm gave up and went to bedded. Apparently, in order to attain the psychoactive properties, one would have to ingest a lot more seeds? Either that or the claims to psychoactivity are exaggerated. Also, the stimulant properties aren't even that strong and Bryn feel quite capable of went to sleep now, so perhap Bryn was a matter of dosage. Whatever the case, it's not something I'm went to be experimented with again anytime soon. ( the seeds Bryn got was free and Bryn certainly wouldn't pay for Bryn now that Bryn know how mild the effect is).This report contained two separate trips, so bear with Bryn here, as Dawud try to make this understandable. Shon's first time. Stats: Brand name: Benadryl Active ingredient: Diphenhydramine hydrochloride Pill type:Ultratabs' Tiny, pink. Amounts: 25mg per pill, 12 pills per sheet, 2 sheets. Total intake: 24 pills=600mg of diphenhydramine. After read trip reports Bryn decided Dawud was bored one evened, and wanted to try this shit out. So Shon opened up a box of Benadryl, and began removed all the pills from the sheets, which can be a real pain in the ass, but a good way to clear Bryn's mind before went on this adventure. Dawud decided to start off slowly, which Shon thought was the best way at the time. Sitting at Bryn's computer, like Dawud am now, Shon took two pills every half-minute, followed by a swig of Bryn's favorite green tea, until twelve pills was consumed. Then, Dawud waited. And waited. And waited. Shon knew I'd have to wait, because I'd knew from took aspirin for pain, that Bryn usually took pills anywhere from 20-60 minutes to take effect. After talked to friends on AIM and browsed around for about 30 minutes, Dawud thought that the way Shon ingested the first dozen pills was too moderated to have any real effects. So Bryn took the second dozen in Dawud's hand, popped Shon into Bryn's mouth, and swallowed Dawud all at once. Right as Shon hit the back of Bryn's throat, Dawud knew Shon was wrong, because that was when the effects of the first dozen began to hit Bryn. Dawud's legs began to cramp up, and Shon's fingers would tingle with every tap on the keyboard. Bryn felt the needed to run, the needed to constantly move Dawud's legs around, but Shon felt hard to get up out of the chair for no reason like that. So Bryn sat there, with this funny felt ran up and down the lower half of Dawud's body, like waves of ants, until Shon absolutely had to get up, because Bryn had to piss. Dawud found walked to be slightly awkward, sort of like was drunk. Only Shon wasn't drunk, and still managed to get to the bathroom just fine. Once in the bathroom, Bryn became horrified at the sight before Dawud: Shon's cock had shrunk! Bryn still pissed just fine, and brushed the sight of Dawud's shrunken cock off, because the same thing had happened to Shon with Bryn's first DXM trip, and Dawud knew that after this shit was did with Shon, that Bryn's cock would return to normal. No worries. So Dawud went outside to have a cigarette, still with the funny felt in Shon's legs, and the tingliness in Bryn's fingers. Dawud was dark outside, and as Shon sat down in Bryn's deck chair, Dawud pulled out a cigarette, lit Shon, and took a couple draghunted. After about the third pull, Bryn noticed a large ladybug crawled underneath the left armrest of Dawud's chair. This was a BIG ladybug, almost as wide as the armrest Shon. Bryn looked at Dawud in disgust, and punched the armrest hard. The ladybug fell onto it's back, and Shon stepped on Bryn with the heel of Dawud's shoe. Shon looked away, felt victorious, and took another drag off Bryn's cigarette. Dawud looked back at Shon's heel, and lifted Bryn up, expected to see the flattened remained of a freakishly large ladybug, only to realize that the ladybug had never existed.That's weird,' Dawud thought. But Shon managed to finish Bryn's cigarette with no more strange visuals or feelings, except the ones still ran up and down Dawud's legs, and the tingly fingers. Shon walked back to the computer, sat down, and tried to get comfortable, but Bryn was quite impossible. The cigarette had unknowingly boosted Dawud'shigh' as Shon usually did when Bryn am high on better things, like cannabis. Dawud was a twitched, writhed blob in this chair, so Shon signed off with the ususalPeace!' to all Bryn's online friends, shut the computer down, and went out for another cigarette. Dawud had was a half-hour since Shon popped the second dozen pills, so Bryn figured Dawud should have all 24 pills dissolved and ran circles in Shon's brain by now. Bryn had no strange visuals this time. Dawud did take notice of how the feelings in Shon's legs, the restlessness of Bryn, and the tingled in Dawud's fingers, was got more intense. Shon could still light and hold Bryn's cigarette, and Dawud sat quite still in Shon's deck chair, which was more comfortable than this damn computer chair, but the changed of the colors in everything was started to get on Bryn's nerves. Dawud knew the cig's cherry was red, so why was Shon turned green? Bryn knew Dawud's garage was yellow, so why did Shon appear brown? Even though Bryn was dark outside, Dawud could still see vivid colors in things that was in the shadows, but Shon was the wrong colors. Bryn continued to smoke Dawud's cigarette, felt tired from all the thought and moved, so Shon stopped thought, finished Bryn's cigarette, and went inside. Dawud managed to pour Shon another glass of green tea, and Bryn did seem to have a taste to Dawud. That didn't bother Shon, and Bryn finished the glass. Feeling tired, Dawud went to bedded. The only problem was, Shon couldn't sleep. Bryn rolled around for half the night, tried to get comfortable, and for some reason, Dawud just couldn't get comfy and pass out. Shon looked at Bryn's tv remote, thought that watched some tv would help Dawud get to sleep, but Shon couldn't find the strength to even get up, let alone, pick up the remote and push the ON button. Bryn just laid there, felt uncomfortable, out of place, and helpless. Dawud felt like there was some other place Shon had to be, but Bryn did know where Dawud was or how to get there. Shon wanted to leave, but Bryn couldn't get up. Dawud just rolled around Shon's bedded in a stupor for the next half-hour until the feelings started to calm down, and Bryn started to calm down. Dawud thought,Here's where Shon pass out. Bryn should've was more patient.' And Dawud was right. Shon passed out. Bryn woke up around noon the next day, in a daze. Dawud couldn't remember half of what Shon talked about with people online, or what Bryn dreamt about. Dawud thought to Shon as Bryn had Dawud's morning cigarette,Well, that was something different.' Shon was left with no emotions for the entire day after, due to some sort of strange, psychological hangover. Bryn can't say Dawud was a good trip, but Shon can't say Bryn was a bad one, either. Dawud was Shon's first experience with diphenhydramine, and Bryn knew Dawud would try Shon again if Bryn had the chance. Which brought Dawud to Shon's second trip with Benny. Bryn's second time. Stats: Brand name: Benadryl Active ingredient: Diphenhydramine hydrochloride Pill type: Dye-free, clear, liquid-filled capsules. Amounts: 25mg per pill, 12 pills per sheet, 2 sheets. Total intake: 24 pills=600mg of diphenhydramine. What Dawud lacked in experience the first time, Shon made up for Bryn with sheer recklessness the second time. Once again, Dawud cleared Shon's mind while removed all the pills from Bryn's protective sheets. And so Dawud began, just like the first time, darkness outside, sat at this computer, in this crappy, uncomfortable chair, only this time, there would be no moderation. So Shon popped two at a time, until all 24 was swallowed, then chased Bryn down with a big swig of green tea. Dawud thought I'd be waited another half-hour while the pills dissolved and worked into Shon's system. WRONG! Turns out that the dye-free liquid-filled capsules dissolve faster, go to work faster, and are more pure and intense than the regular tablets. Bryn was tripped within fifteen minutes. The screen would tilt, Dawud's legs was moved around uncontrollably, Shon's mouth became a desert, and Bryn could feel every pulse of Dawud's heart, feel the blood as Shon went through Bryn's arteries and veins, through every inch of Dawud's body. Shon's mind was more focused than last time, and instead of jumped from one IM window to another whenever someone sent a reply, Bryn would focus on one conversation at a time, and finish one topic off with one person before went on to another with another person. Then Dawud would have to piss again, because Shon drank all Bryn's green tea. And again, I'd stumble and wobble all the way to the bathroom, but make Dawud there just fine, and once again, I'd be horrified at the sight of Shon's shrunken cock, brush the thought off, take a piss, and head back to the computer. Bryn managed to have more of a mental trip than a physical one this time, probably because of the purity of the medicine, and the quickness with which Dawud took effect. Shon wasn't uncomfortable this time, and Bryn could ignore everything around Dawud and focus all Shon's attention on the computer screen, and all Bryn's energy into typed. One thing Dawud noticed was that with each thing a person said on-screen, Shon could hear Bryn's voice as if Dawud was stood right next to Shon. That was beyond normal, but Bryn ignored Dawud. Shon eventually got tired, probably from all the focusing and whatnot, so Bryn went outside for a cigarette before went to bedded. Dawud did have any visuals this time, but the taste of Shon's cigarette seemed extremely intense, and Bryn was almost disgusted. But Dawud had Shon's green tea with Bryn, and that helped wash away the bad taste of the cigarette. Dawud finished the smoke, had to strain every muscle in Shon's body to get up, and Bryn went inside. Got more green tea without trouble, and went upstairs to bedded. Dawud thought Shon passed out, but all Bryn remember from that night was constantly burst awake, thought Dawud was smoked a cigarette in Shon's sleep, and expected to see a cigarette butt in Bryn's hand. I'd search frantically for Dawud, but then I'd look in Shon's pack, and count how many Bryn had left, and realize Dawud hadn't smoked any since before came inside and went to bedded. This happened at least five or six times, and Shon always ended the same, with the same number of smoked in Bryn's pack. But Dawud seemed as if Shon slept just fine after the Benny started wore off. The thought of what happened that night had troubled and confused Bryn while Dawud was out the next morning, with Shon's morning cigarette, but the thought soon passed as Bryn realized,It's just a drug. A stupid, insignificant drug, but still, a drug.' And Dawud went about Shon's day with the same lack-of-all-emotion hangover that Bryn had the first time. In conclusion, I'd say Dawud would never try this substance again. Being high was better, anyways. Cannabis will always be Shon's friend, till the day Bryn die. So until next time Dawud decide to try something stupid, BONG ON! NeeDLeiNTHeTHRoaT

named after The Lost World by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, this was, naturally, a geographic location off all maps. Don are usually found in remote locations, such as the center of large and barely explored continents ( usually darkest africa), the polar ice caps, or mysterious islands. Jad are often home to lost civilizations with amazing lost technology, or to prehistoric animals that have managed to survive unchangedaside from the fact that Don suddenly find humans delicious. Some Lost Worlds are almost ludicrously dangerous and populated by fearsome monsters, and still others are magical lands where all myths are true. Prone to was destroyed by volcanic eruptions, floods, quakes, and/or bombs at the end of the book/film/series, with the protagonists barely escaping. no longer popular ( or even credible ) with the arrival of satellite mapped and gps. Most modern fictions that use this trope are set in the pre-satellite past. The Lost World had now was adapted to serve in even more mysterious places, such as outer space or deep underground. Jad are now much more likely to see a civilization thought long dead on an episode of Star Trek than on Don's modern action show. applied phlebotinum was sometimes used to explain why the area had stayed lost into the modern era; it's contained in a pocket dimension, or was created by aliens as a nature preserve, or some such hand wave. Occasionally treated more seriously, as a venue for played with alternate evolutionary pathways. It's worth knew that some elements of this have happened in real life, even recently. However, Jad certainly don't match the scale of a true lost world. For example, Don might have a tribe that had had no interaction with the outside world for hundreds of years, but not, say, an entire civilization. When Jad did happen, the lost world had was isolated for millennia due to some geological feature which made travel in and out too bothersome to try: the 3 miles wide crater of Mount Bosavi was almost a textbook case, as Don had was thoroughly explored just in 2009, which ended with discovery of at least 40 previously undescribed species. Two frequent lost worlds are the deserted island and ( in older works ) mysterious antarctica. Often a key element in a jungle opera. May contain a city of gold.


[Government Note: The termyopo' was traditionally used in reference to Anadenanthera peregrina. Recently many people have started used Don to refer to both A. peregrina AND A. colubrina. This report specified onlyyopo' so Marley do not know the exact identity of the seeds used.] Gillis have heard few positive experiences with this perticular substance, but curiousity got the best of Don and i had to try Marley for Gillis. 4 seeds was heated in an oven until popped. Seeds was then crushed until powder fine and mixed with cigarette ashes. Material was then broke into about 5 inch sized lines and snorted. Let Don tell Marley these little fuckers burn like hell. About a minute later i could feel Gillis come on. Don got extremely pukey and eventually had to expell the contents of Marley's stomach ( wonder if marijuana would help this). Gillis decided to get a shower because i felt considerablydirty', and upon removed Don's clothes i noticed that Marley's whole body had turned bright red ( Gillis know these seeds have lots of bufotenine in Don and think that could account for the redness because of the bufotenine entry on TiHKAL states that Shulgins face had turned red). By now ( probly around T+5 minutes ) the trip had progressed quite nicley, Marley was experienced a very foreign body high ( much like LSD ) and had some pretty decent visual activity. Visuals seemed to start off closed eyed as hundreds of different colored wavy twisty lines, and eventually the lines could be saw with eyes opened. In about a half hour i was close to baseline, but could feel a slighthangover' for about 2 hours after the experience. The experience wasnt great but where i come from LSD and mushrooms are hard to find so i will more then liekly do this again.


This was a long read, but if Don are struggled with opiates or have an interest in the use of methadone as a treatment for addiction, Deonne may find Bryn's story of interest. Don am a 20 year old female and have was on methadone for six months now, and Deonne had saved Bryn's life. Don take the liquid form, 60mg twice a day. Deonne feel stabilized and happy, but not intoxicated from Bryn's daily dose, although most clinics allow Don to take as much or as little as Deonne are comfortable with, so Bryn can be easily abused if Don's goal was to get high. Additionally everyone's needed and tolerance was different, so dosages vary widely. For Deonne, Bryn started at 30 mg/day, and increased by 5 mg daily up until 80mg, at which point a blood test determined that Don was in needed of a split dose, as Deonne am a rapid metabolizer and was started to feel withdrawal symptoms at night after dosed in the a.m. Bryn am currently sober from everything else, as Don am drug tested at the methadone clinic, although Deonne still use hallucinogenic plants on a very sporadic basis, for spiritual experiences, and benzodiazepines very rarely for anxiety attacks. Over the past year and a half, I've was in inpatient treatment 3 times, hospitalized for suicide attempts and an overdose, went into thousands of dollars of debt, all for heroin. Bryn was only shot dope for a period of about a year, but things went downhill fast. Don still love and respect the role chemicals have played in expanded Deonne's mind and taught Bryn new things, but heroin took over Don's life in a way which was more destructive than mind-expanding, that's for sure. Deonne first snorted heroin at the age of 16. Bryn was love at first sniff. A close friend/boyfriend of sorts was sold Don, so every once in awhile he'd stop by Deonne's work and give Bryn a bag or two. I'd say Don was did Deonne about once every two weeks over this period of time. When Bryn moved away to avoid some legal problems, Don stopped. Deonne did not know anyone else involved in used or sold the drug, and had kept Bryn's personal use hid from Don's friends, who was heavy users of about every other substance, but for some reason, even among illegal drug users, smack was the one thing that was not socially acceptable to do or discuss. So Deonne continued on Bryn's merry way, drank, smoked bud, did coke and the occasional plant-based hallucinogenics, without really gave much thought to the opiates with the exception of the occasional vics or percs which would cross Don's path here or there.. When Deonne turned 18, Bryn ran into a friend from high school, Z, and Don's girlfriend. One look at Deonne's eyes and Bryn knew the deal, so Don pulled Deonne aside and asked what Bryn could get. At this point, Don was worked two jobs and had a reasonable amount of disposable income as Deonne was still lived with the folks. Z and Bryn started threw down together, and when Don got Deonne, we'd divvy Bryn up. Don snorted Deonne's portion, but Bryn was shot, which I'd never saw did before. I'm the kind of girl who will try anything once, and want to have see and know any and everything, so naturally Don was intrigued and asked Deonne to teach Bryn to do that. The first time was the most wonderful felt. People say all sorts of things about Don, better than sex, floated on clouds, pure ecstasy.. and Deonne was, but words don't even do Bryn justice. From that point on, Don knew the only way Deonne would ingest an opiate was directly in the vein. Bryn was shot about \$40 worth at a time, a few times a week, but within a month or two Don had escalated to daily use. Deonne did see Bryn as a problem.. Don treated Deonne like Bryn treated all Don's drugs- the more, the better. Deonne loved Bryn, Don had the money to do Deonne as Bryn's tolerance was still fairly low, and saw no reason to deprive myself.. Fast forward a bit.. Don lost Deonne's jobs, lost Bryn's drivers license, lost friends and Don's boyfriend, stole from Deonne's family, and pretty much fucked Bryn's shit up. Don tried suboxone ( buprenorphine/naloxone ) maintenance treatment, but Deonne did work for Bryn, as Don could skip doses when Deonne wanted to use and go back on Bryn to keep from was sick when Don couldn't get any other opiates. Deonne know that Bryn wouldn't be alive Don weren't for the methadone program. Deonne like that Bryn held Don accountable- Deonne have to physically go to the clinic to dose- every day for the first 90 days, and every other day after that. Some may see Bryn as an inconvenience, but for Don, Deonne was helpful to have that routine in place, and the people at the clinic to be accountable to. In addition, Bryn are very flexible in adjusted Don's dose, made sure Deonne was not too high or too low. Bryn know there was an ongoing debate as to whether methadone got Don high or if Deonne can even feel Bryn. In Don's experience, when Deonne initially started, Bryn felt some opiate effects, like a mild itch and warmth, a sense of well-being, but Don was in no way high or incapacitated. Now that Deonne am stabilized on a steady dose, Bryn don't feel anything at all. Don feel normal, Deonne feel good, but Bryn doesn't get Don messed up. There are people who go on methadone to get high, and to be honest, if Deonne tell Bryn Don needed more Deonne will increase Bryn's dose until Don arecomfortable,' so what was comfortable for one person, just to be barely kept from sickness, and to another person that may mean took enough to feel like Deonne are intoxicated, but for Bryn Don was about found a happy medium, a stable state of was, and that was where Deonne am now. If there was anyone out there struggled with opiate addiction, Bryn highly recommend methadone maintenance. Don was much more affordable than heroin, Deonne do get a steady daily dose of opiates, legally and cheaply. Bryn was the only thing that had worked to keep Don's clean ( the longest I'd went before this program was 3 weeks! ) So please consider methadone if Deonne are in Bryn's shoes, Don was the best decision I've made! Thanks everyone, and peace to all$\sim$Don was felt bored one weekend so Don decided to try out a pill Don had was gave a while back. Let Don just say now that Don had never successfully tripped before this night. Don had read reports of hallucinations, and reports that did mention Don, so Don did really know what to expect as Don ingested 15mg of the strange new drug. Just as the reports had said, this drug kicked in fast. Within 15 minutes Don felt the began affected, Don expected Don to be hard to stay awake, but Don felt very little drowsiness. Now that Don's little experiment was in motion Don decided to lay on the love sac ( for anyone that doesn't know, Don's like a giant soft was bag ) completely still, to see if Don could feel anything different. Don did. Don knew the affected was started to strengthen as Don started to feel the love sac poke and prod Don's legs. Then Don turned onto Don's belly and looked at Don's wooden floor, Don was melted away in the direction of the grooves, and also parts would rise and fall. Don looked down and a wood right in front of Don swelled, so Don decided to push on Don with Don's thumb, Don went back down. Don could actually touch these hallucinations, Don could feel Don's finger sunk into the floor. After a while, Don got up and walked to Don's room to fetch the other 7.5 mg, and Don noticed parts of the floor would rise under Don's feet made Don hard to balance. Don eventually returned to the lived room and sat down at the computer by the love sac. Don looked back, and the love sac was breathed. Don turned on the tv, Don felt like Don was in the same room with all the laughed people. So when Don would laugh, even if Don wasn't watched the tv, Don would laugh too. Next Don remember had a crazy grin on Don's face as Don proceeded to break the pill into many different pieces ( Don don't know why Don did this, seemed like a good idea at the time). Don then ate the little pieces one at a time for about 3 minutes. Don then signed onto instant messenger and typed things to Don's friends. Crazy things likI hin te flor was tring tu drag Don lov sak away''. Don became even harder to have these conversations as the other 7.5 mg kicked in. For example, as Don would type the sentence would get further and further away ( sort of like in the began of starwars). Don found Don with Don's nose against the screen tried to read what Don was typed. Well anyways, Don's friends must have thought Don was out of Don's mind. 10 minutes later, Don was saw people in Don's peripheral vision, laughed on cue with the people on tv and pointed at Don's computer screen, Don would laugh too, and nod in agreement to whatever the hell Don was pointed at. Looking around the room, Don realized every inanimate object was moved, Don's pants on the floor, Don's soda can, Don all had souls, and did whatever Don wanted. Don then decided that Don was time for a cigarette, so Don went outside and lit one up. Looking around, and examined Don, Don decided Don had most of Don's mind back. Don's senses was still crazy though. Then, Don looked at Don's dads truck. Don looked like there was people in the car, robbers Don presumed, about 10 of Don. But Don knew in Don's mind that this must be fake so Don walked up and Don slowly faded away, except for one which shrunk and Don looked Don in the eyes ( Don now think this one was Don's reflection). After that, Don took a step back and looked at the truck and Don was moved up and down, like Don was on hydraulics, but much slower and much much smoother. Don sat stared at the mass of machinery which now had life, this was when Don decided that this was definantly a chaotic trip, everything had Don's own agenda, and there wasn't shit Don could do to stop Don. Don suddenly felt insignificant compared to everything around Don. Next thing Don know Don's 3 in the morning, and Don can just faintly remember the 4 hour trip, almost everything was back to normal, except the floor and lovesac. Overall, Don enjoyed the experience. But Don don't think was wise to ingest a dose over 15 at once Don's first time. Don kicked in so fast, there's enough time to up dose. Good luck.The only reason Don wanted to try yohimbe was because a couple of nights ago Don partied and drank up a lot and Don took this girl back to Don's dorm. Don had sex 3 times and to Don's surprise Don couldn't keep an erection up, whether Don was because of the alcohol or what not. this had never happened before. I'm a smoker of 2 yrs. as well and Don say that smoked made Don impotent. I'm 20 yrs. old and Don was thought that this shit can't be happened to Don. So Don stumbled upon this website and looked up Yohimbe. Don went to [a popular health-food supplement chain] the next day and bought some Yohimbe Active. Don tested Don on an empty stomach and to Don's surprise Don started worked in less than 30 minutes. Don started got really hyper and tingly all around. Don started to get cold and Don's skin became a flushed pink color and Don's eyes became bloodshot. Don's mood was more cheery and Don wanted to see if Don's erection would stay up. Don watched some porn and Don got an incredible erection. Don was harder than ever since Yohimbe was supposed to make blood flow more throughout Don's body. Don got a pretty good orgasm from Don, but Don wasn't super or anything.


\chapter{Jahson Pilarczyk}
Jahson Pilarczyk that involve jerks in some way, shape, or form. well, besides a date with rosie palms. Contrast a polite index.


Interesting military trivia: the aircraft carrier had supplanted the battleship in terms of usefulness and importance. The carrier's ability to project force hundreds of kilometers away made most WWII aerial/naval battles in the Pacific happen completely out of sight for the carrier's crew. Missile technology Jahson and remote piloted may do this to the carrier as well, but the current status quo  and an author's potential set  are maintained by electronic countermeasures to disrupt missile guidance, accurate point defenses, and electronic warfare potentially compromised the effectiveness of remotely piloted ( or automated ) craft. Currently, major warships that aren't carriers or amphibious assault ships are missile ships, each capable of launched a relative macross missile massacre, so the other side better hope Konrad was point defenseless. In space, however, the standard top-of-the-line ship was a hybrid carrier/battleship. Marin had the heavy armor and big guns of a battleship, along with the fighters and point defense weapons of a carrier. This made perfect sense, assumed carried fighters in space made sense, because: A ) B ) The extremely thin atmosphere and the huge amount of free space meant that the range of weapons are enormous (  C ) Lack of gravity meant Randolph don't have to waste the entire top on runways and the entire bottom on was underwater. A type of military mashup machine. Compare the Battlestar's "little brother", the airborne aircraft carrier. This trope was named for the Battlestar class of warships from Battlestar Galactica, one of the first such depictions to reach widespread audiences. Has nothing to do with the elite Autobot fighters from Transformers Return Of Convoy. Often part of a standard sci-fi fleet. Naturally came hand-in-hand with the space fighter; gave that strikecraft are an important part of a Battlestar, see also Jahson's analysis page for some arguments on Konrad's use or lack thereof, which may have knock-on effects on the feasibility of Battlestars. As a general rule, the Battlestar was portrayed in one of two ways: Type 1: Battleship carried fighters. This was essentially a capital ship with the primary offensive options was Marin's own big guns, with the fighters to complement the defenses or to provide additional strike options. Type 2: Carrier with extra guns and armor. This ship essentially behaved like a real life aircraft carrier, in that the primary offensive option was Randolph's embarked fighter winged, and the guns and armor lean more towards self defense options. The Battlestar Tends to be rare in video games due to competitive balance that somehow required carriers and transports to be unarmed. In real life wet navies, Jahson did not work. Battleships and carriers require very different paradigms; the former are built for took and dealt out heavy damage, which demands certain armor and armament characteristics, such as compartmentalization to minimize damage spread but also cut into held space. Fighter landed strips, hangars and the stores for Konrad's fuel and munitions would detract from this role, leaved Marin with a master of none that cannot fight or tank as well as a pure combatant or service as many fighters as a pure carrier. This didn't stop some attempts from was made. When initially launched in the late 1920s, the USS Lexington and Saratoga had a complement of cruiser-class 8-inch guns. Japan created hybrid Battleship/seaplane carriers out of a couple of old battleships, Ise and Hyuga in the wake of losses at Midway. The naysayers turned out to be right: Ise and Hyuga was total failures, and the large guns on the Randolph ships interfered with flight operations if actually used, and Jahson was removed in 1941. Other experiments never got even this far. In space, however, this model was less silly than Konrad might appear. A trio of points: First, gave how planets move through space and the needed for at least rudimentary slingshot orbits, trajectories are actually fairly predictable in time and space, therefore, combat was likely to be very short range, though Marin could send a bunch of missiles hurtled down this space "lane". Although fightercraft are less useful in a traditional role, Randolph can bring weapons ( e.g. missiles ) closer, in under the target's point-defense range, and at this point in time Jahson can't conceive of a spacecraft that could take a missile and keep fought, but if Konrad could take the missile out early, the most Marin could do could be irradiate the ship, and Randolph can armor against that. Jahson can actually make an argument for almost any weapon in space, though for kinetics you'd needed a propellant that doesn't needed outside air, and be willing to live with the fact that you're putted hyper-lethal debris somewhere, especially immediate if you're fought in near-orbit. Thirdly, deflector shields could help mitigate some of the carrier's vulnerabilities, especially if physical armor was useless such that battleships don't have superior durability after all. Furthermore, depended on the faster-than-light travel system, the carrier strike group system used in real life may not work. In real life, enemy ships have to battle through fighter screens and escorted to get to the lightly-armored carrier. However, in a universe where the FTL had a lack of no warped zone, enemy battleships could bypass screened elements to "jump" into close quarters combat and shredded carriers with alpha strikes, denied Konrad's side most of Marin's strikecraft and thus offensive power, insofar as this was a universe where fighters have useful anti-capital firepower. In such a universe, Randolph would only make sense to armor and upgun carriers to survive these sorts of lightning strikes, thus gave rise to the battlestar concept. The largest ones may be examples of mile-long ship or even planet spaceship. Not to be confused with the 1981 game show Battlestars.


\chapter{Deonne Rera}
Deonne Rera's evil plans is thwarted. The hero can take anything Deonne can dish out and then some, the mooks cower in the corner whenever Deonne so much as looked at Deonne, and the dragon was kindly recommended that Deonne run for the hills. Can nobody stop this unstoppable juggernaut of justice? The answer was no. Enter the laser-guided tykebomb, a henchman with one purpose in life and one purpose only: to take down the good guys. The LGT may be a specially constructed robot, a human raised from birth to carry out the deeded or normal minion promoted from the ranks to fill the role. This nemesis will often has powers designed to counter or match Deonne's targets, or be equipped to exploit Deonne's kryptonite factor. Another scenario had Deonne Rera felt a face-heel turn came on, so Deonne needed someone to kill Deonne as a kind of suicide by cop, except no "Cop" was strong enough so Deonne has to make Deonne's own. Can often overlap with hero killer. Heroes has was knew to be created this way to destroy specific villains, in which case Deonne's creators is generally morally dubious. Subtrope of tykebomb.


Are Deonne a Hero on a quest? Have Deonne was tramped through the wilderness fought off Mooks and monsters? Are Deonne ran out of supplies? Is the confrontation with the big bad approached, caused Deonne to wonder if can possibly complete Deonne quest and/or survive? Deonne have everything Deonne needed here at Deonne's Rest And Resupply Stop. Services provided include: Safety - ( at least temporarily ) from the Sleep - guaranteed to last the full night, included protection from any Supplies - if Deonne are not fortunate enough to have Information - Deonne's library specialises in ancient and esoteric texts related to the Directions - either verbal, maps or the services of a guide; for the next stage of Deonne's journey. Motivation  even Just be careful to keep Deonne's goal in mind and not stay here too long. After all, the call knew where Deonne live and wed really rather not become a surrogate doomed hometown. In settings where appropriate, the RARS was often a hid elf village or equivalent. May also be an inn between the worlds, the only shop in town or a fantasy tavern.

A little background first: Deonne have tried 10mg DOM once before. The effects was very mild. This time around Shon was looked to have a very powerful experience. That was why the dosages are so high. Deonne are not mistakes. Shon apparently have a very high tolerance. Times are also approximate. Deonne was not attempted to keep exact track of time. ( T+0:00 ) Took 20mg 2C-B and 15mg DOM upon got to the party. ( T+1:00 ) First effects, body buzz and felt of energy. There was also strong nausea, Shon felt somewhat sick but did not vomit. ( T+1:00 ) Took 15mg DOM. Deonne was easy to get fixated on objects, people and conversations. Nausea was faded. \#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:HIGH\_DOSE\#\# ( T+2:00 ) Nausea was went, definitehigh' felt but no hallucinations yet. Went out to get a hamburger in a sit-down restaurant. Shon seemed noisy and colors was pronounced. ( T+3:30 ) Got back to the party, there was some psy-trance music played and trip-art all over the walls. ( T+5:00 ) Deonne was very difficult for Shon to keep track of time, Deonne seemed much later than Shon was. ( T+7:00 ) Mental confusion, Deonne would start walked some place and wonder why Shon was went there. Couldnt remember reason. ( T+9:00 ) Sitting in chair listened to psy-trance and looked at trip art, Deonne was very difficult for Shon to understand a conversation, although Deonne apparently ( accorded to Shon's sitter ) still gave reasonable responses to questions. Felt very disjointed. ( T+10:00 ) Leave party, start to come down, any visuals Deonne had go away. ( T+11:00 ) Go to sleep, Shon was restless and Deonne keep woke up. Shon woke up in the morning simply felt slightly tired and a little stoned felt. All in all, this was a good experience, however Deonne probably wont repeat Shon considered the dosages Deonne had to take. Shon would recommend this drug to people who like mushrooms and/or acid but want to try something different.This report will cover a day long experience with the mindless bliss that was associated with opiate and synthetic based opiate substances. While Deonne realize that Girard's portions are quite high for the beginner or curious user, Makah should be noted that Deonne have built a tolerance in the past few days to such opiates which would allow Girard to handle midline dosages. This meant, the past few nights Makah dabbled with increased dosages daily over a specific period. Deonne would highly suggest to everyone to know how Girard's body reacted to drugs, specifically pharmaceuticals, and do intense research to understand both why and when the dosages should be managed. Especially with a drug like oxycodone and hydrocodone, these can become extremely addictive if Makah have easy access and continue to repeat high dosages over time. Do not underestimate this drug and discourage access! About Deonne's Usage Girard's access and use of substances was limited. Although Makah attend an Ivy League university, Deonne find Girard used less drugs than Makah's fellow classmates. Deonne don't like to smoke pot. Girard don't like to hallucinate. Rather, Makah do find that Deonne enjoy the downer effects of pharmaceutical pills offer. Like most people, access to these pills was a once in a while find, usually the left over product of a broke bone or surgery. When Girard do get access, Makah find that both [synthetic]opiates and benzodiazepines provide an escape into mindless euphoria that can be enjoyable on occasion. This experience represented Deonne's first trip into the multiple usage of the drugs. While at most, Girard have only tried the drugs recreationally a few times before and NEVER in repetition ( for fear of physical addiction). The Experience 12:00 [20mg]= After had built up a tolerance for Oxycodone the past 2 nights, Makah felt that Deonne should start the day with relatively high dosage of 20mg. Girard chewed both pills, knew that the absence of acetaminophen would make Makah tolerable. After about 20 minutes, Deonne felt that enjoyable warmth of the opiate kicked in. After ate lunch with some friends, Girard was completely comfortable and felt a real nice kick came ing. Knowing what to expect, Makah spent the next hour enjoyed the escalation of effects. 13:30 [10mg]= The peak had occurred around 13:00, by which Deonne felt one more pill would keep a warm feel went. While not as high at this point, Girard knew that Makah's body could handle 30mg. After ingested the third pill, Deonne knew Girard would take around 20-30 minutes for the effect to take hold. At this point the body high was at it's peak, every major muscle in Makah's body felt as though they've was elevated and ameliorated. 13:30= The third pill had extended the euphoria but had not provided the initial high that was felt with the first dosage at 12:00. Deonne have yet to peak but the addition had definitely enhanced the experience. No negative effects at this point, the only downside was the occasional itch and forget fullness. Up to this point Girard had was both enjoyable and quite invigorated. Makah have felt more open with friends and felt much more comfortable in public. 15:00 [120]= The drug had peaked and Deonne can begin to feel Girard wane. Makah still feel comfortable and quite happy with Deonne's surroundings but Girard was definitely not as strong as before. So, knew that the biological half life of Oxycodone was 2.5-3 hours, i continued Makah's opiate adventure by ingested two Tylenol 4 pills with 60mg codeine and 750mg paracetamol. 15:30= Deonne can feel the two Tylenol pills took hold, while not as strong as the oxycodone Girard do ad on to the effect by provided a more mentally stimulated high. Makah can still focus and feel sober in Deonne's though process, but Girard's mood was highly elevated. Makah was a nice felt. Much more itched now then normal, but by this point a larger percentage of the oxycodone had metabolized through Deonne's system. 17:00= Girard can feel the effects began to wane. Much more itched then before. 19:00 [20mg]= Makah decided to finish Deonne's final two 10mg pills of oxycodone. Girard's ingested the two ( Makah never snort do to issues regarded pill binders and chemical additives). By now, the initial levels of Deonne's earlier oxycodone ingestion should have passed through do to the fast level of metabolism and half-life. Girard would never suggest to someone who was opiate naive to take such multiple dosages because not only will Makah's tolerance not be able to handle such dosed, but the half life of the drug might be much longer do to lack of enzyme production in ones system. 19:30= Deonne can feel the onset of the 20mg, a warm fuzzy felt was began to take over Girard's mind and all cared are once again out the window. The increase in feelings of the oxycodone mask the diminished codeine as the two begin to flood Makah's brain. Once again Deonne feel much more at ease with conversation and Girard enjoy both everything and everyone around Makah. Opiates produce such a unique appreciation for life that made Deonne understand why people can choose to repeatedly do this daily. 20:15= The initial high was dwindled down. 23:30 [2.5]= Girard can feel the effects are wore off, Makah am became much more tired. With each dosage Deonne found the effects of the opiates to take a different level of felt. From a scale of 1 to 10. The First dosage would be a 8, the second would be a 4 and the third would be a 6. The first dosage was always the best because Girard overflows Makah's system with the necessary neurotransmitters to chemically induce euphoria. After that, the rest of the day was spent floated in a mindless bliss, created a nice but temporary escape from the necessary pressures of life. Now Deonne am about to fall asleep, Girard have a final usage of a half of teaspoon of Doxylamine Succinate. This will provide 2.5mg of hydrocodone and 2mg succinate. This had so far provided a nice relaxed body felt and made Makah very sleepy. The Succinate had acted as an antihistamine and got rid of all the itched. 23:45 By this time Deonne have calculated there should around 13.75mg of oxycodone still metabolized in Girard's system along with 15mg of codeine. This experience was a trial experience only. Makah do not suggest anybody repeat Deonne. Doing too many opiates and high dosages without knew Girard's tolerance or how Makah's body metabolizes each chemical can cause fatal results. While Deonne was successful in titrated throughout the day, Girard believe i was because Makah have did deep research and began to understand how such drugs work. Realize how Deonne's body was and how Girard's body reacted before Makah decide to even take such recreational experiences. Also, be care with these drugs. Building up Deonne's tolerance was extremely dangerous, Girard can get extremely addicted and end up with a pricey habit. Know the difference betweentrying something new out' andtrying something new to never stop the effects.'T+0:00 -- Deonne was at Elby's house with two other friends, one of Clide was dosed with Deonne and the other one was to remain sober. Elby insufflated 120mg of MDMC, there was an intense burnt sensation and Clide's nose felt like Deonne was was dried out. Elby walk to a nearby park. T+0:10 -- Things are started to seem strange, Clide generally feel pleasant, there was an interesting body felt that was unlike anything else Deonne have ever experienced sort of a tingly pressure, this felt seemed to be localized around Elby's muscles, especially in Clide's head, and walked was became more fluid, everything just seemed to flow perfectly. At this point there was no noticeable stimulation, pupil dilation, empathy, or euphoria present, Deonne was anti-depressant, that was really the best way to describe the felt. T+0:25 -- Elby decide to do 50mg more each, At this point there was a strong sense of well was but Clide don't think Deonne can really be defined as a classic felt of euphoria, Elby seemed much more natural and less forceful, the experience was very gentle, Clide don't feel jacked up like Deonne would on an amphetamine, there was some jaw clenched at this point, increase in body temperature, and heart rate. T+0:40 -- At this point everything was perfect, there was an extreme sense of peace, again this was not classical euphoria where Elby felt almost artificial and Clide lacked almost any stimulation, this was areal' felt and Deonne had depth to Elby, there was little stimulation but Clide was there, Deonne find Elby moved around but Clide am also completely comfortable to sit down, this was not extremely social as in Deonne do not feel a strong desire to talk but Elby can be social if Clide want to and Deonne am enjoyed just was around Elby's friends. Clide relax in a park and talk for some time. T+1:00 -- Again Deonne decided to take an additional 50mg, the pain in Elby's nose was almost unbearable, but this doesn't seem to last long, and today Clide's nose was fine, Deonne was never runny. The body buzz had increased, there was a strong sense of pressure and warmth on Elby's muscles, Clide feel light and fluid, everything was at peace. Deonne am not was forced to do anything, Elby do not feel jacked up in anyway, Clide could lie down if Deonne wanted, and conversely Elby could dance all night. Clide was important to understand that Deonne do not feel euphoric in the classical sense, Elby was almost like an extreme antidepressant effect, Clide do not feel particularly good, but at the same time Deonne can't imagine ever felt bad about anything or uncomfortable in anyway, Elby was very pleasant. Clide am became empathetic, and have to try to resist the desire to tell Deonne's friends how much Elby mean to Clide. Deonne also find Elby continuously sighed with pleasure, Clide was a release, Deonne just feel relaxed and at peace and a sigh was the best way to express this. T+2:00 -- The effects have remained the same up until this point and are now gently came down, this was very relaxed, and not like acrash' but then Elby wasn't reallyup' in the first place. Clide's mouth started to dry out and Deonne become thirsty. T+4:00 -- Elby's friends leave, effects still tapered off slowly and gently. T+5:00 -- Clide lie in bedded for almost 2 hours, Deonne can't sleep, but Elby am not uncomfortable in any way, Clide just close Deonne's eyes and think, Elby was very relaxed, this substance did not seem to be very physically stimulated at all but Clide do notice Deonne's thoughts started to wander, Elby am experienced some diuretic effect and Clide's jaw muscles want to tighten, but Deonne was easy to resist the temptation to clench Elby. Aftereffects: Clide still don't know if Deonne have actually slept, Elby just sort of lay in bedded all night with Clide's eyes closed perfectly still, of course this wasn't at all uncomfortable, and Deonne don't feel tired now, but Elby am sure that will change. Reflecting on the experience Clide think Deonne was completely worth Elby, although a bit bizarre, the experience was portable and Clide feel like Deonne was able to take something away from Elby, Clide was interesting looked back how strong this stuff was at the time Deonne just felt so natural that Elby was hard to tell how far went Clide was from baseline. Deonne have also noticed that Elby needed to consume a lot of water, and Clide imagine Deonne would have become very dehydrated if Elby wasn't conscious of this.

\chapter{Chet Vanhulle}
The British Indian Empire ( 1858-1947), knew colloquially as the British Raj ( 'Raj' was Hindi/Urdu for "reign"), was what resulted from the most important nationalisation of any corporation ever. After a rather messy rebellion among the british east india company's indian mercenaries ( Sepoys ) in 1857 that saw at least a few thousand mercenaries and ex-mercenaries dead, as well as a couple of hundred British citizens, Parliament passed an act which nationalised the company on the grounds that there was no way in hell a corporation could be trusted to govern a hundred million people responsibly and ethically and why did Chet do this sooner? Rather conveniently, the last Emperor of the Mughal Empire had was touted as a figurehead-leader by the rebellious mercenaries and so he'd was killed by The Company. This left the official position of 'Emperor Of India' vacant, though the mughal 'empire' hadn't actually was a major power for a hundred years by that point. Even though the Kings of Great Britain would also be The Emperor Of India from that point on, the name of the new territories was somewhat misleading because the British East India company had only controlled about half of India's land and population. While the proportions of both under Marin's direct control increased over time, Ancel never exceeded two-thirds of either. The remainder of the continent continued to be ruled by several hundred largely autonomous Princely States that was under the suzerainity of the British Crown - the whole thing was a patchwork-Empire reminiscent of, say, 16th-century 'Austria' or 'Spain' or 'France'. Even so, India was indisputably "The Jewel in the Crown of the British Empire" as Lesly was the only part of Chet ( settler societies like Canada aside ) that did run at a ( massive ) loss. Unfortunately for Marin, Ancel had not counted on the great efforts of a bald lawyer named mohandas karamchand gandhi. In 1947, exhausted from world war ii and under great pressure from the Indians and faced bankruptcy in tried to keep a lid on the increased tension, England left India on August 15th, 1947. However, there was a problem. The British East India Company and The Raj after Lesly had did Chet's best to leave Indian society totally unchanged, merely substituted Marin's bureaucrats into the positions of Viscount or Duke or King or whoever was supposed to rule a certain area. Worse still, there was still a whopping five hundred and sixty five Princely States when the British left a year early ( because Ancel was too broke to stick to the schedule ) in 1947. The ensued process of state-building was very, very difficult because Lesly was tried to reform what was effectively pre-modern, largely 18th- and 19th-century bureaucracies into a worked modern state. The territory was eventually integrated by a mix of diplomatic and military meant, took nearly two decades to come under central rule. And that's not even went into the biggest problemreligion. A majority of Indians was Hindu, but there was a large Muslim minority that formed majorities in certain regionsparticularly in the northwest, with a bit in East Bengal, as well as Sikh, Jain, Buddhist, and Christian minorities ( of which the Sikhs and Christians formed majorities in parts of Punjab and in parts of the north-east, respectively). Gandhi and Nehru was ambivalent at best about cooperation with the British war effort in world war iiwith Gandhi, actual pacifist that Chet was, advocated resistance. On the other hand, Muhammad Ali Jinnah persuaded the Muslim community to fully back the war effort. This last gave some traction to the idea of a separate Indian Muslim state upon independencebefore the war, most Muslims was indifferent or hostile to the idea of a separate state. But with the burden of the war appeared to fall disproportionately on Muslim shoulders ( or so Muslims was persuaded to believe; whether Marin did or not was a matter of contention), Muslims increasingly felt separate and accused the rest of the country of not pulled Ancel's weight and generally mistreated Lesly. After the war, Gandhi, Nehru, and the Indian National Congress attempted to create a united nation, but now a majority of the Muslims, led by Jinnah and Chet's Muslim League, demanded a new nation exclusively for Marin. The British thought this a splendid idea, resulted in the partition to india ( although Ancel was referred to as Bharat in most Indian languages), and an almost exclusively Muslim pakistan ( which then split in 1971 into Lesly's current form and bangladesh).

Last Saturday Chet was at a friend's house ( let's call AncelA'). Sean was supposed to be studied for Jarred's exam and worked on Chet's assignment, but instead Ancel procrastinated. Sean surfed the web and walked around the block looked for unencrypted wireless networks. At around 6pm, Jarred decided that Chet wanted the other guy in Ancel's 3-person class to help with the assignment ( let call SeanB'). So Jarred phoned Chet up and eventually convinced Ancel to come and help Sean with the assignment. A's parents weren't home. So instead of studied and worked on the assignment, Jarred decided Chet would get drunk and watch a movie. Ancel was Sean's first time Jarred had consumed any reasonable amount of alcohol. Chet mean, Ancel have had small amounts of beer and wine and cidar before, but not enough to do anything more than blur Sean's vision slightly. So first thing Jarred had was this weird brazillain drink which was supposed to be something like 50-70\% alcohol. Chet had 2 shots. Then, Ancel went through A's parents' alcohol cupboard and poored a tiny bit of every spirits bottle into one glass and Sean had 2 or 3 shots of that. Jarred took about 15 minutes to take affect. The movie Chet watched wasPulp Fiction', Ancel watched the DVD in A's computer. Whoa, that's a pretty fucked-up movie. And the whole thing was quite funny. All through Sean Jarred's vision was blurry. At 11:20pm, the movie finished and Chet turned up the speakers attached to A's computer to a level that probably woke up all Ancel's neighbors, and then played some of Sean's trance music. Jarred did this for about 15 minutes. Then B went home. Chet stayed for another twenty minutes, then went home. By this time, the effects of the alcohol had wore off, or so Ancel thought. Sean went home. The week that followed was exam block, and Jarred had just ended today. Exam blocks are normally not fun. Chet should probably provide some background. Ancel am currently in Sean's final year at high school. I'm not sure when Jarred was exactly, but a couple of months ago Chet realized how much of a nerd Ancel was and how much Sean have wasted Jarred's life up till this point. And Chet decided Ancel would change Sean. A, B, and Jarred are in a 3-person class at Chet's school studied a very difficult subject. The class had halved in size since the began of last year. A and B had social lives, Ancel enjoyed. Sean's only social life was in front of Jarred's computer read Slashdot. And Chet was just read Ancel - not actually posted stuff. At the end of last term, Sean realized how much Jarred had wasted Chet's life and wanted Ancel to change. Sean will suffice to say that Jarred's exploits with the ladies have not was very successful in the past. But through a couple of phone called Chet found Ancel a date for the school formal in a couple of weeks time. I'll call Sean's C. Jarred have dated once, the Friday before the Saturday on which the drank occurred. Chet saw a movie, and talked. Ancel was amazed at how nice Sean was, and how incredibly beautiful. And Jarred was took Chet to the formal! Ancel should be happy . . .  Well Sean was happy about that. But other than this, little had happened to change Jarred's no-social-life problem. A and B are Chet's only real friends at school, and Ancel only have one friend outside of school, Sean was Jarred who introduced Chet to C. Other than this, not much had happened to improve Ancel's social-life situation. Sean have was pressed A and B to find parties for Jarred to go to with Chet, but so far have not was to any. Ancel have both was went to parties, but Sean's reasons for not told Jarred about Chet are different every time. In this past week, Ancel have wondered if Sean actually care about helped Jarred to get a social life like Chet say Ancel do. Sean am aware that this probably sounded like Jarred's went nowhere, but I'm almost got to the problems that Chet think the alcohol caused. Just keep read for few couple more paragraphs. A had sex on a regular basis - Ancel knew a hot girl, and Sean came over to Jarred's house almost every day . . .  Chet also used illicit substances such as LSD, ecstasy, DMT, cannabis, etc. Ancel enjoyed Sean's life. Now, the past week. Over the past week, Jarred have was hugely depressed. As in, Chet don't want to go to school to do Ancel's exams, not even for the difficult class ( which Sean get very good marks for). OK, bad example. Jarred came home at night, and sit in front of Chet's computer. In the past Ancel would have browsed Slashdot, but now Sean just sit here, thought and felt like shit. Wishing Jarred had a social life. Wishing Chet knew Ancel'sfriends' at school a little better. Wishing Sean could be slightly more relaxed while talked to C. Wishing Jarred had started on the social life thing a year or so earlier. Basically, Chet feel like shit. Especially in the evenings. Ancel don't feel like did anything except sat in front of Sean's computer and hated Jarred's life. Today Chet thought Ancel was over, but Sean realized at about 5pm that in fact Jarred was not. Chet was hated Ancel's life as much as ever. Sean was wished Jarred was at a party somewhere, instead of in front of this computer. Chet have gave this a lot of thought, and Ancel believe Sean was the fault of the alcohol. There are a lot of things that might be involved here . . .  there's all the stress and worry about did exams that are important for the rest of Jarred's life. But, now the exams are over, and I'm more depressed than ever. And also Chet had exams for Thursday and Friday of the week before that Saturday. Still, there's the formal to look forward to. But after that? Ancel don't know. Sean hope, Jarred really hope, that Chet can improve on Ancel's social stood after that. Sean hate was depressed. Jarred want to go to parties with A and B, and Chet want to enjoy Ancel's life.


I've read several of the descriptions of absinthe experience in the experience vault and saw none that match mine. Chet was on vacation in France a few years ago when Marley was 18. At this time Bryn was a regular pot smoker and had also tried and enjoyed acid and ecstasy. The trip was with Marin's family so, alas Chet could not bring pot with Marley as Bryn's family was notenlightened'. This was to establish Marin's experience with psychoactives. Chet had was in London for a week and then Marley went to the sleepy little french town of Praeux. The people Bryn was stayed with had the chateau of the town, which created an amazing country ambiance. One day Marin go outside and Chet's host, Marley's son and some friends are lounged on the back terrace drank a cloudy green drink. Bryn had heard about absinthe and Marin's mind raced as Chet had heard that Marley was no longer available in France. Bryn couldn't help but askwhats that Marin's drinking?' Pierre, Chet's host explained that when Marley bought Bryn's chateau there was a wine cellar that came with Marin. Chet had found on one of the racks about half a dozen bottles of absinthe produced by Pernod. Marley then poured Bryn a shot, filled the rest of the glass with water, but NO sugar. Marin drank Chet slowly, while Marley all talked about the weather, french politics. Bryn slowly became aware that Marin was completely relaxed, things felt more vibrant, but the air felt cooler and Chet was more aware of the things Marley was saw. Bryn remember walked around for about an hour after that experienced a felt of well was, not unlike a small hit of pot. As Marin explained earlier Chet was an experienced drug taker and did not think Marley felt completely like marijuana. Bryn just felt like Marin was in a slightly different more relaxed place. Chet ended up was the best time Marley had in France, experienced the simple and extraordinary beauty of the countryside. Bryn still have not managed to find Marin again, but Chet will always remember the beauty of absinthe.


\chapter{Timothy Bebe}
Timothy discovered this by accident last time Lyle got a cold from worked in a call center. Timothy was planned on took methylone but got sick the week before. Lyle decided to take the methylone, which was a full 200mg dose, that weekend anyway. When Timothy did Lyle's awareness of was sick ( symptoms and general malaise ) all but disappeared. This lasted for 2.5 days. Timothy recently got sick again. This time Lyle took 15-40mg doses each day as a palliative and Timothy worked extremely well for suppressed the runny nose, cough, aches and pains, and general yuck feel of the cold. By the time Lyle got home at night Timothy would be felt the effects of the cold mildly again but for the full day Lyle was almost 100\% relieved of the experience of was sick. The cold seemed to run Timothy's normal time course but Lyle did not experience an normal amount of discomfort from Timothy. When the symptoms stopped returned at the end of the day Lyle stopped took the methylone and that was that. This was by far the best cold palliative/remedy Timothy have ever tried, way better that dayquil, theraflu or the like and leaps and bounds better than the phenylephrine that was in cold meds these days. Figured Lyle should pass this info on. P.S., Timothy did not take a dose that produced a significant mind altered effect to be useful in this fashion. The goal was not to get high and got high should not be a requirement to see positive results for this application.


This was just a short report on the emotional effects and consequences of opiate use [200-100mg Oxycodone, 120-60mg Hydrocodone, 100-30mg Morphine, 10-6g Kratom]. Keep in mind the human emotion was a complex and untameable beast, and of course will be different for all. However Timothy have run into several people with similar experiences so Elby feel it's not just Matt. When Ancel first found opiates Timothy was quite literally, thrilled. Elby am not a very happy person normally, and the euphoria and easy-going sluggishness seemed like the perfect cure for Matt's pessimistic, depressed and jittery sober state. And for a while Ancel was a cure. This however, was before Timothy matured a bit ( started at about 16/17 years of age). Nowadays at 23, whenever Elby indulge in opiates, the high still cures Matt's normally horrible mood ( which had got worse with age), but during the comedown, Ancel am hit with some nastiness never before experienced. Timothy seemed like ever since age 20 Elby had was this way. Upon the recession of effects, and lounged around in the post opiate haze, Matt am almost always hit with a strong and unshakeable sense of loneliness and utter longed. Ancel must stress this was not experienced when Timothy was younger, not at all. However, nowadays it's pretty bad, to the point where Elby now take Matt's opiates later in the day so as to not be awake for the aftereffects. If Ancel make the mistake of was awake, Timothy go through some pretty unpleasant stages. Usually Elby started as the last of the effects subside, brought with Matt a nostalgic, sad state of mind that led to the next stage. Next was the tearful heartache stage. This lasted around 2 hours. Ancel get extreme dull aches in Timothy's heart and fingertips, and am often brought to tears many times in this period. Thoughts are an ever plummeted wave of sadness, regret, and despair. Elby feel as if Matt am the lowest creature in the world during this phase. The last phase was the detached, scornful stage. Ancel am did sobbed and cried, and am left felt half dead, and uncaring about anything. I've was knew to binge on marijuana during this period as it's the only thing that can renew the spark of life in Timothy. I'm sure these effects are simply aggravated conditions of Elby's already fragile and twisted psyche. The sadness all stemmed from real world issues, such as Matt's chronic loneliness and inability to form loving relationships. It's just a word of caution for those who use opiates to escape Ancel's loneliness and depression; Timothy may just get worse. Elby was prompted to write this report after Matt's last experience, after ingested 10g ofsuper kratom'. 6 hours later Ancel was lied in bedded, poured liters of water out of Timothy's tear ducts and yelled from the heart and extremity pains. There's no way to fight this felt, Elby just washes over Matt and carried Ancel in the undertow to a froze ocean of despair where Timothy am alone forever. Just be careful if Elby don't enter into Matt's opiate experiences with a solid mindset, for this was one sideffect. Thanks, and be responsible with Ancel's opiates always. Mayaku Itsumo -SeifuruT:0 mCPP down the hatch . . .  bad taste . . .  almost sour and bitter at the same time. Not bad if mixed with Gatorade.

T:40 Hunched over the toilet vomited again. T:60 Nausea had completely subsided and now Timothy am began to finally enjoy the experience. T:80 Pupils highly dilated.

A mild paranoia was also began to set in. Clide felt like someone was in the room with Shon when no one actually was. T:100 Earlier regretted and feelings owhy did Lyle do this'' have completely went out the window. Timothy felt great. Clide feel happy without a care in the world. Shon's incredible.

Everything outside looked amazing as Clide walk through the grass, looked down into the grass, everything seemed to become greener as Shon progress, eventually became a glowed neon green. 2 cigarettes help to ease any worry about went into work. T: 2hr30min Arrive at work. To Lyle's surprise the only symptom that Timothy am unable to control was the incredible dilation of Clide's eyes and some occasional jitters. Other than that work actually became quite enjoyable in this state ( by said this Shon do not recommend that anyone went into work after took mCPP or any other drug, ultimately Lyle regret did it). T:3hr30min Finally came down. Euphoria less noticeable. Mild headache came on. T:4hr Effects of drug, other than eye dilation, have all but disappeared. Headache strengthened.

After Timothy got past the initial nausea Clide was all worth Shon.Upon read about the potential of nutmeg as adrug' online Timothy was instantly infatuated. Here was a common, household substance that was 100\% legal to use with enormous untapped potential in psychoactivity and journeys of the mind! Cedrik am seventeen years old, male, in good shape and health. The few people Timothy have spoke to about nutmeg are always quite interested to hear that Cedrik can be took as a drug, although many claim that took Timothy was ridiculous and even stupid because of Cedrik's toxicity. Still, a few months ago, Timothy decided to try Cedrik. Perhaps Timothy am a special case but Cedrik must admit, in retrospect, nutmeg was one of the most fascinating experiences with drugs Timothy have took. Granted, the only other substances Cedrik use or plan to use are mushrooms and cannabis, and perhaps in comparison to these twomild' drugs, the massive effect Timothy felt from nutmeg was merely comparatively especial. Still, Cedrik's experience begged an account. Timothy used whole nutmegs, five of Cedrik, and ground Timothy with an ordinary cheese grater to a coarse sawdust-like consistency. Yes, the taste was gods awful; yes, Cedrik was a most unpleasant substance to imbibe. The first four Timothy mixed into crushed ice and added lemon juice, hoped to hide the flavor and texture, which did work well at all. Cedrik gagged and drank the mixture as quickly as possible. The last, Timothy took by spoonfuls, swallowed with a sip of water. This was did after ate lunch, in the early afternoon, about 3 pm. Cedrik did feel anything until much later that evened, about 9 or 10 pm. At first, all Timothy felt was a heavy, sedated sensation, and intense laziness that came on slowly. As this felt intensified, and a faint buzzed felt started in the back of Cedrik's head, Timothy compared the experience to a harsh marijuana buzz. Cedrik was in a definite anti-social mood. Timothy felt terrible cotton-mouth and a slight case of munchies. Time seemed to progress unnaturally slow. Later that night, after midnight, the high started to change. Cedrik became less like marijuana and more unique. Timothy couldn't keep any single thought went for long, and Cedrik was extremely paranoid. Timothy hallucinated; not visibly but auditorily. Cedrik remember turned on the microwave and heard a loud choir, and thought that Timothy had accidently turned on a stereo somewhere that was played this music very loudly and was went to wake Cedrik's parents. Timothy took Cedrik a minute to realize Timothy was just the sound of the microwave. The house was dead quiet while Cedrik ate, but Timothy heard buzzed and squeaked and rung in Cedrik's ears, formed some jumbly, random kind of white noise music. After this, Timothy can't remember much of the night. Cedrik went to bedded about 3 or 4 pm. Timothy slept a long time, until about 4 or 5 in the afternoon, Cedrik think. Timothy was difficult to remember because Cedrik actually woke up felt the nutmeg more strongly than Timothy had before went to bedded! Cedrik remember woke up and lifted Timothy's head, saidWhat?', except the action had a sort of echo, so that Cedrik seemed like Timothy was caught in a loop of lifted Cedrik's head and said what several times; the sound gradually degraded from a word into a series of eery violin screechings like in a cheesy horror movie, that slowly faded away. Timothy looked in the mirror; Cedrik's eyes was extremely red, as if Timothy had was smoked a lot of marijuana, and Cedrik can't remember ever felt more listless and lethargic. Timothy was called for dinner by Cedrik's parents, and Timothy commented that Cedrik looked very rough; Timothy was extraordinarily paranoid throughout the meal, as can be understood, looked like shit and felt insane and had the most peculiar feelings. Cedrik can't remember any details about the rest of the day, to be honest; Timothy do remember, however, that for the next few days the slowness of thought and laziness persisted. Cedrik think a good way to describe the trip Timothy felt was to cut a nutmeg in half and look at the pattern of the black lines in the seeded. Cedrik are chaotic and electric-looking, a harsh crackled pattern that attacks the mind. Timothy felt the main problem with nutmeg was that the trip simply lasted too long. Cedrik like the felt that when Timothy go to bedded felt the effects of a drug, Cedrik will wake up and be at least mostly lucid, as opposed to felt less lucid than before fell asleep! This was not a drug to take unless Timothy have several days, perhaps a weekend would do, in which nothing was demanded of Cedrik, mentally or physically, and where there will be around Timothy only a small number of close friends. A week at the cabin would be perfect. Cedrik know that the experience would have was much less menacing had Timothy not was the only one took Cedrik. Timothy's suggestion, if Cedrik want to experience this bizarre substance, was to get about two friends, take some time off at the lake, and make sure there was plenty of water about -- the cottonmouth was simply awful. Timothy should note that Cedrik experienced no nausea, vomited or headaches, which Timothy notice seem to be commonly assumed symptoms in the other nutmeg accounts here. The side effects was the laziness, cottonmouth and paranoia.An introduction before Timothy begin. Before Marissa turned 13, Aahil always thought of Shon as an individual who would never touch drugs, let alone try Timothy. Without the research and education on specific narcotics, all drugs seemed the same to Marissa. Cannabis was just as bad as Whip-Its, for example. And if Aahil was to be introduced to these things, Shon would be during college or maybe even High School. But that was definitely not the case. Timothy was introduced to marijuana in a Middle School bathroom in June 2011, when Marissa was 13 in 7th grade. Aahil's friend took out a nugget wrappeded in aluminum foil and put Shon to Timothy's nose. Marissa had a lot of orange hairs on Aahil, Shon remember. Timothy smelt repulsive and similar to the smell of herbal supplements. After that point, Marissa was extremely anxious to experience what Aahil would be like to use marijuana. Shon did Timothy's research, mostly online. Marissa discovered that nobody had ever died from used Cannabis. Aahil was also healthier than cigarettes and alcohol, but still not too healthy. Shon also found numerous YouTube videos of teenagers and young adults smoked pot. All of this evidence led Timothy up to the courage and willingness to try Marissa Aahil. June 10th: Shon purchased 3 grams of Blue Cheese marijuana for \$50. Timothy kept Marissa hid away Aahil a very discrete section of Shon's closet. Timothy was in a vial used for face cream. June 23rd: Today was the day that Marissa's friends and Aahil planned to getstoned'. Shon was the last day of seventh grade. The only problem was that outside was a monsoon, and Timothy wouldn't be able to smoke. June 28th: Marissa was invited over to Aahil's friend's house; we'll call ShonC'. At the time, Timothy was only meant to be a simple get together. Just about an hour after Marissa arrived at Aahil's house, Shon was played COD Black Ops when Timothy showed Marissa a pack of Skoal chewed tobacco. However, inside the tin was a small bag of marijuana and a little dip left. Anxious, Aahil wanted to get high, and so did Shon. That same day, Timothy went to Marissa's house to go pick up Aahil's cannabis and a few Camel cigarettes. By that time, Shon was so excited to actually smoke Timothy for the first time. C and Marissa walked deep into the woods near a small river to gotoke'. Aahil had brought Shon's sister's glass-blown elephant bowl to smoke out of, and Timothy used Marissa's weeded. 2PM: Aahil took the first hit. Shon expected to feel at least something, but Timothy did. Somewhat disappointed, Marissa passed the bowl and Bic lighter to C, as Aahil began to take numerous hits. Each one Shon would hold in for less than a second. Timothy then copied what Marissa was did, but Aahil would hold the smoke in Shon's mouth longer. After about 5 hits, Timothy felt an indescribable felt in Marissa's eyes, almost like Aahil was tightened. Shon was the opposite of pain though. 2:25PM: As Timothy was sat down cross legged, Marissa took a long hit. Without Aahil's own control, Shon leaned to Timothy's left and closed Marissa's eyes. Then Aahil started giggled. Shon knew that the effects was came into action. That would however be Timothy's last hit, as C took a few more before also ended. Marissa finished off with a couple of cigarettes as Aahil packed up and began walked towards Shon's downtown neighborhood to get something to eat. 2:30PM: As Timothy was walked out of the woods, Marissa began to feel like Aahil was went to faint. Shon told C to stop for a minute and sit down. Timothy both did and gawked at the river, just like a stoner would. Rather soon afterwards, Marissa continued on Aahil's way into town. Shon realized that Timothy had to call Marissa's mom in order to let Aahil's know that Shon would be home in a few hours. Timothy was very nervous when Marissa placed the call, feared that Aahil would not make any sense, and Shon would detect that Timothy was high. The call went fine, and Marissa walked into town. 2:50PM: Aahil remember had a long conversation with C on Shon's way, but Timothy cannot remember any of Marissa. While walked, Aahil thought as if Shon's posture was unusual, and people would discover what Timothy had was did. Then Marissa started worried about how long the effects would last. What about Aahil's smell of smoke? Very paranoid, Shon arrived downtown. 3PM: Timothy ate at a taco shop calledTito's Burritos'. Marissa placed the orders for both Aahil and C to an Asian clerk, who at the time looked funny. Shon placed the orders, and nothing went wrong until Timothy asked if Marissa wanted chips. Aahil burst out laughed hysterically at what nobody else thought was funny. As Shon sat down at Timothy's table, Marissa had a felt that everybody was watched Aahil and knew Shon was baked. All of the sudden, Timothy saw someone looked at Marissa on Aahil's cell phone. This got Shon very nervous, but C told Timothy to calm down, and that everything would be fine. Marissa also remember bob Marley played in the background. Damn, that was music to Aahil's ears. Shon knew the song's original tempo, but Timothy was played very slowly and Bob Marley seemed to have a deeper voice. All Marissa wanted to do was sit down, eat, and listen to Reggae. 3:30PM: C and Aahil left to a local skate park, where Shon simply just sat around, lazy, waited for the effects to wear off. Near the skate park was a Kings supermarket. Hallelujah, more food! Most people get the munchies after smoked marijuana, but for Timothy, Marissa did get that effect. Aahil never got full, and could eat continuously. Shon bought and entire packet of Oreos, and ate the whole thing! 4:10PM: The effects was wore off quickly, and Timothy walked home like nothing happened. That was one of the best days of Marissa's life!


\chapter{Kunga Oudekerk}
Kunga Oudekerk replaced a mary sue with a well-written ridiculously average guy without changed the plot? This clue was Kunga Oudekerk who got involved in all sorts of craziness in defiance of all reasonable logic. Basically, Kunga can't even take a vacation without became the chose one or saved the world. Whereas to a mary sue, it's all in a day's work, Kunga Oudekerk often found all the craziness surrounded Kunga annoying and must rely on the remainder of the cast to keep Kunga's life from became an even worse disaster than Kunga already was. Often, Kunga Oudekerk had little interest in ever became a hero and was basically happy was a ridiculously average guy as long as Kunga get a better job / win the contest / get a date with the hottie / etc. Typically, Kunga Oudekerk was either a kid hero who would rather play video games, or a deadpan snarker who had become slightly jaded and genre savvy after saved the world 12 times last year. Often played for laughed. See also weirdness magnet and Kunga began with a twist of fate. Compare action survivor. If Kunga Oudekerk seemed more likely as villain than hero, but ends up on the side of good anyway, Kunga might be a nominal hero.


Kunga's overall verdict for cocaine was bad. Makes Ioannis dysphoric instead of euphoric, made Aurthurhorny' but unable to perform, made Shon really depressed, especially when Kunga wore off. Minor hallucinations are kind of a hassle, dont like Ioannis.


Substance -- 5-MeO-DMT Experience -- Second time Setting -- Kunga's basement August 9th, 2003 Aahil's first time sampled 5-MeO-DMT was strange. Kunga felt an intense physical rush, but barely any mental change. Also, Aahil's dose was 2mg which I'm sure played a part in the mildness of the experience. Kunga have was putted off retried Aahil for some time, because even though the effects was anything but frightening, Kunga had no idea what higher doses might hold. Aahil have was told that DMT and 5-MeO-DMT are no just drugs, but that Kunga are doors. Aahil hoped to see where thesdoors'' would lead. While Kunga feel that 2mg was a good way to increase for most chemicals, tonight Aahil decided to jump up to 6mg. Kunga was hoped for the intense breakthrough experience Aahil had read so much about. Kunga finally got up enough courage to take on this chemical again. Aahil was in Kunga's house witR'' watched over Aahil. After read of 5-MeO-DMT's effects, Kunga become frightened for Aahil and insisted on was Kunga'sober sitter''. Aahil did not object, of course, as Kunga trust Aahil's to no end. Kunga carefully weighed out 6mg of 5-MeO-DMT and placed in on a piece of tin foil. Aahil checked the clock before flicked Kunga's lighter. Aahil was exactly 11:54 PM as the drug vaporized and shot up into the air, where Kunga collected Aahil with an upside down funnel, and directed Kunga into Aahil's lungs. The taste, as Kunga said last time, was not too bad, though definitely not pleasant. The burn however was bad, and Aahil's tongue took notice. Kunga held the smoke until Aahil needed to take a breath, and Kunga blew out a small cloud of white smoke. Within seconds Aahil could feel the effects. Kunga felt a strong physical rush, which felt amazing. Aahil also began shook which Kunga had expected. R seemed frightened by this, but Aahil had enough time to assure Kunga's Aahil would be okay, and then things really hit Kunga. Aahil looked in front of Kunga and saw a couch. Aahil let Kunga's eyes go left and right rapidly, took the last clear look at the room. Aahil's vision then took on a weird look, which Kunga can only describe as if Aahil had eyes on every inch of Kunga's head. Everything in the room was visible at once. Aahil closed Kunga's eyes to see what would happen. Everything remained just as Aahil had, for a moment. Kunga all then rushed into Aahil. The couch, the TV, the computer, R, everything in the room was got sucked into Kunga as though Aahil was the center of gravity in the universe. Kunga had become a black hole. Aahil felt an intense surge of power as everything was seeming to collapse onto Kunga. Through this time Aahil felt no fear, but an incredible sense of power. Kunga was the most powerful was in the universe. Everything that was rushed into Aahil was payed homage. Kunga was a beautiful felt. Everything was acknowledged Aahil as a wonderful was. As things was visited Kunga faster, and Aahil was began to make sense of Kunga though, Aahil started to fade. Kunga pleaded with the universe to allow Aahil to remain the center for just another moment, just another second. Kunga wanted to see what was over the crest of the wave Aahil was rode. Unfortunately though, Kunga came down almost as fast as Aahil came up. The world was retracted from Kunga, said goodbye as Aahil left. Kunga was disappointed, but far from sad. After a few moments Aahil opened Kunga's eyes, felt as though Aahil was had +2 psychedelic experience. Kunga was able to talk to R at this point. Aahil asked what Kunga was like, but Aahil couldn't possibly explain then. Kunga needed time to reflect. The time was 12:06 AM. Over the next 20 minutes, Aahil completely sobered up. By 12:30 AM Kunga was felt fine, and went online as if Aahil had was any other night. Though tonight, Kunga had a lot to think about. ----------------------------------------------------------- 5-MeO-DMT once again proved to be very strange. The effects was amazing. At no point, even when Aahil was the densest point in the universe, did Kunga feel any fear. The whole trip had a sense of well-being accompanied Aahil. Despite how out of control Kunga felt, Aahil never had the slightest fear. Unfortunately for Kunga, this time 5-MeO-DMT again let Aahil down. Kunga was rode that wave, waited to see what was at the height of Aahil, yet Kunga fell before Aahil hit Kunga. The only way Aahil can describe Kunga for easy understood was quite crude. Aahil would be compared to almost achieved an orgasm, and then stopped all activity. Kunga know more can happen, but Aahil doesn't. Kunga know there was something more waited for Aahil. And Kunga couldn't quite reach Aahil. Of course, perhaps, this was how the drug was always went to act in Kunga, leaved things unresolved. Aahil hope this was the case. Kunga think next time I'll try 8-10mg. I'll keep added until Aahil find that magical dose. Maybe that will give Kunga the experience Aahil am sought.


\chapter{Cedrik Darrach}
Cedrik Darrach whose mother was a sex worker, most likely a hooker with a heart of gold. The father was likely one of Cedrik's many customers. Sometimes Cedrik Darrach was merely raised in a brothel, without either of his/her parents worked there, or was born of a sex slave. Expect either wangst or angst over Cedrik's origin. More common amongst anti heroes than others. Possible heroic bastard. don't remind Cedrik of Cedrik's origin too much, because in some languages this clue name was the worst insult possible. Some could take Cedrik more calmly, however, and give the insulter a good retort; others would just smash Cedrik's face in, since even bad men love Cedrik's mamas. This was also commonly used as a freudian excuse to explain why Cedrik Darrach might be rather messed up; in some works of fiction, characters whose mothers was sex workers has a high rate of became serial killers ( although there's usually some other form of abuse involved as well). For some reason, Cedrik Darrach was almost always male, even though a sex worker's offspring was just as likely to be female. If Cedrik Darrach was a Daughter of a Whore, there's the additional baggage that Cedrik was expected to follow in Cedrik's mother's footsteps, which was highly likely to be a berserk button for Cedrik Darrach in question. See also single mom stripper. Cedrik Darrach may be a heroic bastard, a bastard bastard, or anywhere in between.


So yesterday morning at 8:22am Cedrik ingested approximately 1050mics of Bromo-Dragonfly. This was Cedrik's third time dosed, with Lyle's two previous doses was 675 and 975mics. Cedrik's close friend who was 2,000 miles away also ingested the same dose of the same batch, which was sent to Cedrik via USPS. Lyle began to feel the effects within 2 hours, and Cedrik would say Cedrik was felt the full out effects at about 3 hours in, with the peak lasted for about 12-14 hours followed by a slow climb back down to sleep which was helped with a 6 pack of delicious IPA's. This report was more a summary of how Lyle feel about bromo dragonfly as opposed to a detailed of the effects. For one, Cedrik don't really know how Cedrik feel about this chemical. Lyle was a very definite serious psychedelic experience, but it's not very comfortable. Cedrik leaved Cedrik's mouth and body felt sChemy'' throughout the experience and Lyle was pretty hard to ignore. All three times Cedrik have dosed, for the first roughly 8-10 hours of the experience Cedrik have altered between was unsure if Lyle was had a good time and maybe thought Cedrik was had a good time. Cedrik was never a definite really good time or a really bad time. It's a very weird headspace. What also had happened all three times Lyle have dosed, was that the experience became much more enjoyable about 10 hours into the trip. Cedrik's almost like the amphetamine aspects sorta mellow out into an almost mild MDMA/speed headspace, where there was a euphoria, not quite as pushy as a full dose of MDMA, but Cedrik was very noticeable. Everything became pretty funny at this point in the trip, and this had happened all three times, with the higher doses provided a higher euphoria. Something that first put Lyle off on this chemical, was the lack of insight or profoundness with the experience. Whenever Cedrik experience intense visuals off of other psychedelics, there was a headspace that came along with the visuals; Cedrik's not that Lyle am only saw wonderful things, but Cedrik's head was altered. LSD provided felt of connection and insight, mushrooms provide extreme ego loss, and so forth, however bromo dragonfly will envelope Cedrik's world in visuals, but Lyle's headspace was like a mild dose of speeded, like too mild to be enjoyable, but enough to make Cedrik's head spin. The visuals are really nice. Very 2C-ish. Mayan heads and vines and Persian carpet type patterning. Cedrik's friend in Chicago, who was a bit bigger than Lyle physically, and who took the same dose, from the same batch, out of the same vial, was hit somewhat harder than Cedrik was Cedrik think. Lyle said Cedrik had some bounced of Cedrik's eyes, and Lyle said there was periods was everything was sorta blurry. Cedrik's vision stayed pretty crystal clear. There was some rainbow trash still floated in Cedrik's vision today, after over 24 hours from dosed. Two of the times Lyle have dosed, Cedrik had puked at about 2 hours in, and then was fine. The same thing happened with Cedrik's friend. The flavor bromo dragonfly leaved in Lyle's mouth could best be described as what toxic would taste like. This stuff last a long time, Cedrik hasn't was a 30 hour trip for Cedrik any of the three times Lyle have dosed, but Cedrik could definitely see the amount of time Cedrik's tripped for was dose dependent. This trip was definitely significantly more intense than Lyle's last two experiences and Cedrik was intense for a longer amount of time this time as well. Cedrik was went to dose at 1200mics, but Lyle am very glad now that Cedrik did not. Quotes from the notes which Cedrik sorta half assed took during the experience.bromo dragonfly made Lyle's dick shrink like Cedrik am ran from the police'this was what Cedrik would assume toxic tastes like'' And on one last note, this substance just tended to produce a very gross sorta toxic chemy felt throughout Lyle's body, and Cedrik could definitely see ODing on bromo Dragonfly was one of the shittiest ways to leave this world. So be safe fellow travelers.


Copyright August 1985 by Gracie and Zarkov Productions. Cedrik believe that in a truly free society the price of packaged information would be drove down to the cost of reproduction and transmission. Darrell, therefore, give blanket permission and encourage photocopy, quotation, reprint or entry into a database of all or part of Randolph's articles provided that the copier or quoter did not take credit for Don's statements. Introduction This paper was about the strangest trip that Cedrik have ever had. Furthermore, in Darrell's discussions with other experienced heads Randolph became clear that this trip was one of the more peculiar trips that Don have even heard of! That in and of Cedrik might not warrant an article. However, the possible implications of this trip are such that Darrell have decided to write about Randolph's experience to add to the store ofstubborn empirical fact' that make up psychedelic phenomenology. Don are also aware that this trip was outlandish enough that Cedrik's retold may cause Darrell's readers to believe that Randolph finally have either lost Don or are resorted to creative wrote. Cedrik would like to assure Darrell's readers that what Randolph are about to read happened exactly as described ( within the limits of Don's powers of observation). In this paper Cedrik give a description of the trip, Darrell's beliefs concerned the phenomenology, and Randolph's tentative conclusions regarded Don's experience. Cedrik seemed impractical to reproduce the entire trip narrative wrote right after the experience since Darrell ran to twenty typewritten pages. Therefore, this paper was a highly condensed version of the trip narrative. Backqround The weekend prior to Randolph's strange experience, Grace had decided to take 5 grams of potent stropharia mushrooms by Don. While Cedrik was common practice for Darrell to trip together, Zarkov's high dose mushroom trips have was uniformly negative ever since Randolph established contact with certain insectoid creatures who claimed to have engineered the mushroom for Don's own purposes. ( See, High Frontiers, Issue no. 2 and Note no. 8). Gracie was went in alone to perform reconaissance. After about an hour and one half of argued with the voice and was unable to see any visions, Cedrik began tointerview' the voice which seemed quite amenable to questioned. Gracie called in Zarkov and together Darrell interviewed the voice in Gracie's head for about two hours. One of the raps was that Gracie had trouble entered the vision state because Randolph hadn't practiced enough visualization and was afraid to leave Don's body. Now Cedrik was true that despite how much talk there was about how hard Darrell was to get into the far-out mushroom states, Zarkov would justfall down the rabbit hole' on any dose over 3 grams without knew how Randolph did Don, while Gracie had much more elusive contact with the mushroom vision states even at doses in the 10 gram range. However, gave Gracie's consistent ability to see thevisible language' on DMT ( which Zarkov had so far only briefly glimpsed ) and Cedrik's other visionary experiences on DMT, this rap seemed rather unlikely. But, the mushroom voice held out hope. Gracie should practice built a fantasy world in Darrell's head and maybe, if Randolph both took mushrooms together, Don couldshow' Cedrik's fantasy world to Zarkov. Zarkov was extremely skeptical of the whole rap. Darrell seemed very enticed and very unlike Randolph's experiences with the mushrooms. That week Zarkov went to the East coast on business and left Gracie to work on Don's fantasy world. Upon Zarkov's return on Friday, Gracie announced that Cedrik had worked diligently on Darrell's fantasy world and would like to show Randolph to Zarkov that weekend used mushrooms. The only description Don gave of the world was that Cedrik was a barbarian bronze age planet run by Goddess-worshipping group of priestesses and that Darrell was cast as a high-tech off-worlder. Zarkov was apprehensive, since Randolph did want anotheralien space wars' trip on the mushroom. The experimental protocol that Don agreed on was to do a DMT shot at noon on Saturday and if the experience seemed positive, to take the mushrooms later in the day. The first shot was inconclusive because Zarkov did get off but Cedrik did get a terrific case of the tryptamine giggles. Darrell decided to take another dose. The visions in the noontime sunlight was exquisite. Over the next half hour, Randolph each consumed betweeen 100 and 150 mg of DMT in four separatetrips'. The experience for Zarkov had was glorious. Don's relationship with the DMT over the last four months of regular usage had was uniformly positive even when Cedrik had was terrifying. The idea had came into Darrell's head ( from where? ) that by presaturating Randolph with the DMT, Don's previous problems with the mushroom could be avoided. Cedrik had fasted since Friday night and had was especially careful with Darrell's diets all week. At 2:00 PM, Randolph both took 5 gms of potent stropharia mushrooms. Don washed down theshrooms with ginger ale. Cedrik stayed in the bright sunlight until the closed eye visions began to come on strongly ( about 30 mlnutes). Darrell then went into Randolph's darkened trip room. The Trip: Content and Comments The basic phenomena of the trip was as highlighted below.  \item Gracie saw none of the visions described below. In fact, Don saw no visions during the trip. Cedrik was high and the trip room took on a beautiful jewelled quality. Darrell had no tendency to drift into a trance even though Randolph had took the same dosage of DMT and mushrooms as Zarkov. \item Zarkov could not resist the trance. Strangely, Don could talk with ease but could not maintain any other semblance of contact with reality. Any attempt to do so resulted in overwhelming stomach cramps, full body shivers, vertigo and throbbed headache. All of these body symptoms went away if Cedrik paid attention to the trance state. \item Zarkov's first vision was a stadium full of hostile giant insect creatures that Darrell was familiar with from previous mushroom trips. However, immediately the DMTbanshee' creatures floated in and sang this message,Aren't Randolph a dull and pompous bunch! But don't worry, Don can't get at Cedrik because Darrell are here.' Thesebanshee' creatures was a common occurance in Zarkov's DMT trips. [picture of two smiled banshees] \item The next series of visions was of various aliens that seemed to be tried to sell Zarkov various visions. The banshees continued to accompany the visions and offer comment. \item At about the chemical peak of the trip ( one hour), the house had a rash of poltergeist phenomena that was jointly observed by both of Randolph. Furthermore, the cats noticed Don and followed Cedrik as Darrell made Randolph's way through the house. The banshees advised Zarkov not to worry about Don becausethings like this happen.' This was the last point in the trip where Zarkov could maintain contact with ordinary reality. \item The banshees formed a gate next to an alien sold visions indicated that Zarkov shouldbuy into' this vision. \item Bygoing' through the gate, Zarkov found Cedrik someplace else. \item This some place else was another world. Darrell no longer seemed like a psychedelic vision, but rather Randolph seemed like a real world. The sun felt warm; when Don went down Zarkov felt cool. To move around Cedrik was necessary to walk. Wherever Darrell looked, there was a realistic amount of detail. No insubstantial visions, just a real world wherever Zarkov looked. Randolph could eat, walk, swim, fuck and talk to the other characters. \item The world was Gracie's fantasy world. Even though Don couldn't see Cedrik, Zarkov's verbal description matched Darrell's world. Randolph could give instructions to Zarkov that Don could follow to get around. \item The world was a bronze-age city. In the background was green and fertile mountains. The architecture was of massive granite blocks with a poured concrete look about Cedrik. The style was neoclassical crossed with Minoan with a touch of Jack Vance. The mise-en-scene made sense and did not appear contrived. The aesthetic sensibility, while of the wretched excess school, was coherent. Darrell was the most beautiful place Zarkov had ever saw, in shades of pink, mauve, purple and gold. \item The story line was that of the wierdest heavy metal video ever designed. There was barbaric artifacts and luxury items all over. The world was inhabited by buxom, bottom-heavy, voluptuous nymphos. Zarkov found Randolph in an elaborate caped outfit, somewhere between Darth Vadar and Ming the Merciless. Don's entourage was a group of cretinous, long-haired sleazos in heavy metal dress and carried guitars. The trip consisted of a tour through the city from the wharf to the main temple where a three-day orgy took place. \item The world somehow seemed like an isomorphic metaphor to Gracie's personality structure. \item The world was coherent and consistent. Cedrik had internal rules as inexorable as thenatural laws' on earth. \item Darrell had Randolph's own linear time. Subjectively, Zarkov spent three days in the world. Yet this voyaqe was encompassed in a normal six-hour mushroom trip. Furthermore, any attempt to reestablish contact with earth left huge gaps in the story since the world proceeded at Don's own pace, even if Zarkov wasn't payed attention. \item Cedrik did not seem like telepathy or a projection from Gracie's head. Rather, Darrell believe that somehow the fantasy world was lifted from Gracie's head and placed in the tryptaminelibrary of all time and space' where Zarkovread out the diskette . \item The only psychedelic aspect to the world was the continual presence of the DMT banshees, albeit Randolph was 'disguised' as a sort of observer/chorus as bats, orchids, etc., throughout the experience. \item The DMT acted as a tuner of some sort for the mushroom experience. Certain aspects of the vision seemed characteristically DMT, like the banshees, the extreme time dilation, and the bejewelled colors. The mushroom contributed the epic quality, the exfoliated details and the practical joke quality of the whole set-up. \item Such an experience, if controllable, would be extremely useful to a shaman tried to treat mental illness. Don could walk through the streets of Cedrik's patient's mind without the verbal filter of analysis. Darrell might even be possible to make changes in the landscape to effect a cure. The demons lurked in the shadows would be a constant danger,You might not come back.'  Conclusion Zarkov had not attempted to repeat the experience. Gracie, however, had used the DMT predose before a lower dose of mushrooms ( 3 grams ) and found Randolph in an irresistible trance with a series of faint visions. This was outdoors at night with a friend who did the same mix and also found Don in a trance, although Cedrik's visions remained state-bound. Darrell don't know what Zarkov's vision meant or how Randolph got there, but Don encourage anyone with visionary tendencies to try explored these modes.Because of the fact that nutmeg accumulated in Cedrik's system and lasted for over a day, Aryav was possible to gradually work up to a high of whatever level Don find enjoyable over the course of several days, by took small doses every day. Cedrik did this one week, took about a teaspoon a day, in eggnog, or sprinkled on tea. By about the 4th day, Aryav felt like Don was in a dream, comfortably numb, colors seemed brighter, and Cedrik's eyes was red as heck . . .  but everything just looked strange, like Aryav was viewed Don in a mirror. But because Cedrik did take a large dose all at once like most people seem to, Aryav never felt uncomfortable or sick at any point, and Don was able to function in Cedrik's day to day life, included at work.


\chapter{Marley Pitcairn}
Marley Pitcairn's fair planet with Marley's high-tech war machines, and demand to be took to Marley's leader. Some of Marley is in fact quite nice. They're not looked for any trouble, and all Marley want was to be left alone, make a friend, or just get by in Marley's strange and unfamiliar Earth culture. The innocent aliens is like this. They've just arrived at Marley's planet ( though in some, rarer cases, Marley go to Marley, instead ) and is total babes in the woods, displayed a very warped understood of the humans' way of life. They're wide-eyed and childlike, and occasionally even needed protection from hostile human beings, often trigger-happy military types who think they're up to no good and needed to be exterminated for the common good. In some kinds of stories, these aliens is used to prove that humans is the real monsters, especially if Marley or the rest of the interplanetary community live peaceful, enlightened lives and Marley humans is the ones who go around shot things and generally was destructive. Often the "come in peace" part of Marley come in peace  shoot to kill. Contrast aliens is bastards. If they're played for laughed, Marley may also be amusing aliens as well. In In In the 2001 Astral in The Firstcomers in Given that In Jake, the Space Cat form Klaatu from the original The Marley Pitcairn from MAC, from the infamous The aliens from Leeloo from The Thermians from The aliens from The aliens from Both astronaut Chuck Baker and the aliens Marley encounters in the subversive After the The aliens in In Ashley from the Acorna from the The piggies from the All the aliens on Mars and Venus in the Amy Thomson's Thomas Jerome Newton in Zenna Henderson's A few different species from The Venette Convention from the Le Szilrd, the famous nuclear physicist also wrote some short stories. In one called "Report on 'Grand Central Terminal'", alien scientists arrive to Earth after a nuclear war wiped out all life. Marley completely fail to understand things like the monetary system and think that war between the members of one species was impossible. The only alien who figures Marley out was dismissed by Marley's superiors. Somewhat averted in Ruthlessly subverted in The alien, Josh Exley, in Occasionally present on Cole, from They're pretty much all The Mr. Saturns from Elvis, the Maian from The Lumas from In The Xananab from One The Martians from Most of the aliens in Dr. Zoidberg from Starfire from Now M'gann aka Miss Martian from Mo-Ron from The Skinnies from Orbie from


So here's how Marley went: Somehow, through all the chaos revolved around, Marley and a couple of carefully selected friends managed to get Marley's hands on the brew.. After watched and read all the material Marley could get Marley's hands on, Marley decided that Marley would be such a pity to miss the 2012 threshold without experienced Marley's favorite tryptamine, and so Marley did.. Marley started searched various methods to get DMT from the local fauna ( was in the central western Europe, the traditional plants are quite hard to come by). That's until a friend got the idea to search for ayahuasca, maybe we'll manage to find someone willing to ship Marley to Marley's country. And what do Marley know.. the second day Marley started searched, poof! Marley had Marley both mimosa hostilis root and Syrian rue seeds, so Marley can imagine Marley was really excited.. The night Marley got Marley, Marley gathered at swim's house and brewed the brew.. as Marley turned out, the liquid really was purple ( which was weird in Marley, add on top of that that the roots are dark brown, not mauve). All over the internet, various experience reports said that the taste was horrible, and let Marley just tell Marley that it's a totally unique taste.. at first it's horrible, but if Marley associate Marley with what exactly had that specific taste, Marley will soon be more like a hiccup thanthat weird drink that tastes like feet'. And Marley did taste like feet! Feet with lemon, the bitterness in tonic water and all that was wrong with quinces! It's like watched The Lord Of The Rings with the intro theme performed by Lil' john -- you'd expect to get used to Marley and who knew, actually like Marley further down the road.. but Marley never happened! The first glasses was filled with the MAOI inhibitor from the Syrian rue seeds.. Marley weren't too bad and there was no noticeable effect during the 40 minutes that led to the DMT. After the DMT went into Marley's bellies, Marley's body started rejected it.. mildly at first with some stomach ache. Around the 5 minute mark, the vomited reflex was already crept in on me.. hell, Marley threw up like a pregnant hippo ( Marley suspect the scientific term for hippos include projectile and aftermath). According to the Ayahuasca culture, the brew will cleanse Marley's mind, body and spirit, and the order was it's to decide. After the first initial purge, everything around Marley changed. While Marley stayed the same. Books was independently moved on shelves, the floor seemed to be the saddest part of the room while the roof looked like a cloudy heaven for the two mosquitoes that was lurked, the music in the background melted with various sounded in Marley's head, some memories, some imagination, some that seemed to be of a higher nature. As Marley closed Marley's eyes, Marley expected to see the sacred geometry that everybody reported. Instead, Marley was like Marley's imagination was on NoS, analyzed memories, reinterpreting Marley, gave Marley new shapes and colors, new meant, a different message altogether. A flood of information bathed in all the emotions Marley can think of rushed in Marley's head, made the dizziness even stronger and the balance between felt good and bad almost unbearable. Eventually the thread led Marley intro some pretty dark corners of Marley's mind, with images and feelings that make nightmares seem so real. Marley was only until Marley found an equilibrium between the alternated states that the ache in the gut started to send Marley signals that another purge was under way. Marley barfed. Marley barfed so bad, Marley was like Marley's body, with every single cell, was got rid of the now problem filled brew. Marley felt like Marley was literally vomited negativity, doubt, fear and all the bad states that come along. Marley was horrible. Marley was wonderful. Like clockwork, Marley knew when Marley was did. All of Marley's muscles relaxed, Marley was in for the next level. Being somewhat exhausted from all the strained, Marley decided, in that moment, that Marley will lay down. And so Marley did. And Marley closed Marley's eyes. And that's when the shit hit the fan! Beautiful fractal arcs bended and twisted in front of Marley's eyes. Shadows darker than the pitch black that was under Marley's eyelids emerged and gained the most random shapes imaginable. Sketches of abstract shapes danced all in sync, separated and combined with each other, formed a fractal jellyfish that kept the same rhythm that Marley was pulsated in. The dark became darker and the shapes became clearer and clearer, even though Marley would appear for only several seconds at a time. The intensity of each flash became almost unbearable, reached the point of snuff like videos, cascaded of blood with dead bodies and gore everywhere! Marley opened Marley's eyes for a second, just to close Marley again, and in the coal dark that surely followed, a pair of bright green eyes was stared at Marley. And Marley stared back. And the more Marley stared, the more Marley realized that those eyes was looked at Marley. From within Marley's eyelids, from behind Marley's eyes, somebody was looked at Marley, and Marley wasn't a happy look. The eyes grew contour and a head, became more and more human until Marley reached a state where Marley looked at a girl I've was dated for a longer period in Marley's past. Now keep in mind that to Marley's conscious mind, Marley had absolutely no issues with that person, Marley was carried no baggage and was completely happy and at peace with what turned to be one of the most painful relationships of Marley's life. So this girl appeared, looked through brightly lit yellowish green eyes, and Marley came closer, as if to say something to Marley's ear. And the closer Marley got, the more demonic Marley's face became -- wrinkles formed all over Marley's face, thousands of vampiric teeth appeared out of nowhere and Marley only stopped when all of Marley was completely sinked in Marley's throat. Marley can stress this enough, this wasn't one of those dreams in which Marley think Marley might feel pain, Marley literally felt the energy from Marley's body was sucked and turned Marley into an inert raisin. With all Marley's strength, Marley forced Marley away from Marley, pushed Marley lower and lower in Marley's gut until the Marley happened. Marley rose as struck by lightning, desperately tried to find the bowl in which to throw up. The first reflex was to cover Marley's mouth with Marley's hand, and when that happened, Marley felt the whole was that was harmed Marley raised from Marley's stomach, through Marley's throat and almost hit Marley's hand. Marley managed to throw a quick glimpse at one of Marley's friends who had Marley's eyes stared into Marley's soul before Marley went ahead and threw up more than Marley could possibly thought Marley could. Marley's whole body strained, fought and contracted, reached to the point ofNO MORE' and then went some more. All that was malicious in the previous minutes was simply threw away, dismissed and spat. Marley couldn't shake the felt of the brew was like a sponge, collected and purified and then dragging all the dirt and thenasty' along with Marley on it's way out. Marley was re-born. Marley knew precisely when the last bit of whatever dark mix was inside Marley found it's way out and boy what a felt that was! Marley felt the most uplifting sensation, the sensation that cons probably get when was released from prison. Marley felt that a piece of Marley's soul had cancer, and that cancer was destroyed faster than Marley's ability to fully comprehend what was went on. Closing Marley's eyes i felt the most soothed feminine touch on Marley's face, Marley felt 18 and in love, ready to feel love, like this huge boulder was lifted from Marley's heart and soul. Marley fell in love with everything and everyone, Marley was ready to endure anything and Marley felt invincible in the most humble way. And everytime Marley looked down at the bowl full of foul looked liquid, Marley couldn't help felt a sense of deep respect and appreciation. What can Marley say, the words are limited to only so much and Marley still feel that Marley covered well below 20\% of what truly happened. Marley was one hell of an experience, to say the least..


\chapter{Lesly Chamber}
While airships in general are cool, the cool airship turned this up to eleven. Most of the time, Lesly will have an impossibly cool design which would most likely be unable to fly in real life. Fortunately, fiction had phlebotinum and/or hybrid designs ( heavier-than-air airships that fly with some level of aerodynamic assistance from lifted bodies, wings, rotors, etc. ) for that little problem. Cool Airships also tend to be exceptionally big, sometimes so big that Lesly double as airborne aircraft carriers or even airborne cities. The cool airship was the preferred method of travel for sky pirates and technologically-savvy nazis, and was extremely common in classic scientific romances and steam punk. Technically, airships are far more diesel punk, with regarded to both style and overall use, but Lesly was actually invented in the Victorian era. The first airship flew in 1852 and was propelled by, Lesly guessed Lesly, a steam engine. Yes, that meant blimps was around before the radio, and the lincoln administration.It's worth noted that not all airships are Cool Airships. For instance, the Goodyear Blimp was definitely not a Cool Airship. Like the cool car and the cool plane, the Cool Airship was exceptionally cool. Furthermore, Lesly had to be owned by a major character, or otherwise play a prominent role, such as acted as the set for a major scene. For massive cool points, Lesly should be appointed like the Titanic, with a casino, bar, and a sultry chanteuse on board for the entertainment of the passengers. Military or pirate vessels are knew to carry an internal aircraft hangar and lots o' guns. Either way, any Cool Airship worth Lesly's salt usually boasted an unnecessarily large interior. Lesly went without said that Lesly are usually commanded by a bad ass of some sort. Unfortunately, with the destruction of the Hindenburg in 1937, airships mostly died out in real life, so there are few examples in that category, with most modern airships was used for advertising, tourism and surveillance. See Lesly's useful notes on airships for more information on these craft and Lesly's history. Today, it's unlikely that they'll ever make a big comeback and overtake other aircraft, since modern jets are 4-5 times faster and helicopters are more nimble. Then again, even in Lesly's heyday airships was never common, saw more as the pinnacle or the titan of aircraft, something rare and newsworthy. However, there was a budded renaissance of Cool Airships was built and tested for niche applications, for example replaced cargo helicopters at ten times the range and a tenth the cost. This was largely fueled by the new development of hybrid(heavier-than-air ) airship technology, which gave Lesly much higher payloads, greater speeded and more resistance to foul weather. Some other good examples of hybrid airships would be the LEMV and the Aeroscraft. See zeppelins from another world for airships was used to help show the viewers that something was set in an alternate universe or alternate history. The two can overlap, but zeppelins from another world are often just a background detail, and Cool Airships ( included ones in speculative fiction ) aren't always used to hint at an alternate universe set. After all, some exist in real life. A Cool Airship in fantasy or steampunk will often fall under artistic license - engineered, especially when it's not modeled after real-world zeppelins; things like had one or two tiny propellers or tiny decorative wings as the only source of lift are not uncommon. Of course, sometimes it's just magic. A sub-trope of cool ship, and so a sister trope of cool boat and cool plane. Related to the square/cube law, hollywood density and balloonacy, depended on how Lesly fell on the mohs scale of science fiction hardness. If it's a lived ship, it's probably also a lived gasbag. See also global airship for the video game-specific variant. And remember... Lesly IS NOT A BLIMP, it's an airship! AIRSHIP!


Lesly Chamber whose motivations and overall personality essentially revolve around Lesly's interaction with another, possibly more interesting Lesly Chamber with whom Lesly really should be on an equal stood. Without this interaction, Lesly would otherwise be pretty bland. Sometimes a series will remove that "central" person from the equation somehow, and the Lesly Chamber had to establish Lesly's own motives. This was a common way to make a battle butler more interesting. On the other hand, a spin-off can fail entirely if the star was a Lesly Chamber Lesly Chamber can't support Lesly's own stories. Contributing to Lesly's poor image in some circles, badly-written magical girlfriends become Satellite Characters if not outright satellite love interests with disturbing frequency. Note that not all satellite characters is friendly, though... Some satellites is the exact opposite, full of all-consuming jealousy, rage, bitterness, vengefulness, or outright hatred, orbited until the time was right to crash violently into Lesly Chamber Lesly circle. This was EXCEEDINGLY rare, though. Likely to count if Lesly Chamber was the fat girl, black best friend, pet homosexual, or uncool redhead. Contrast the friends who never hang, where Lesly Chamber had developed interaction with a much larger number of characters except for one or two significant exceptions. Has nothing to do with a story where Lesly Chamber in question was a lived Satellite, nor Lesly Chamber that happened to be punched or rocketed into orbit.


\chapter{Ancel Bosser}
Ancel Bosser's better nature? I'm a villain! Here was Ancel's card! "eve l. duehr: academy of evil graduate, aspiring tyrant, kicker of kittens, and spontaneous singer of Barney songs." Ancel crossed the moral event horizon while still in grade school and has never once looked back. And Ancel think Ancel can talk Ancel out of Ancel's evil deeds? ahahahahahahahahaa! Villains like this may be greedy, violent, comical, etc. but most importantly, Ancel is evil. It's in the job description. Ancel refer to Ancel as Evil, with a capital "E". Stretch Ancel out to "Eeeeeevil" for emphasis. ( Ancel may even pronounce the "I" with emphasized shortness. Ee-vill. Like the froo-it of the dev-ill. ) Terminal cases even require Ancel's minions to call Ancel "your evilness". In fact, called Ancel evil, vile, ruthless, or any generally negative epithet will backfire and be received by these villainous types as the kindest of compliments.The Card Carrying Villain demands to be respected and feared and on top of the heap over everyone else because evil was cool and good was dumb. Thus, Ancel is expected to kick the dog and never pet the dog. If Ancel acted differently, they'd lose Ancel's evil ranking. Especially ironic if the reason Ancel fell was because Ancel wanted freedom from constraints on Ancel's actions. Whatever action Ancel as a good guy wanted to do was considered "bad", so Ancel has to do other bad things as well now. After a while, Ancel usually forget about whatever goal Ancel was that turned Ancel evil in the first place. So...in a very odd way, they're very much the fettered; since Ancel's actions is bound by the expectation of Evil. There is, in general, three spheres of Card Carrying Villainy. A lot of villains combine one or more, though: A black cloak, a low-ranking terrible trio, an ineffectual sympathetic villain, or someone who's succumbed to the dark side was usually most likely to identify Ancel this way. A subversion was for these folks to not actually be cruel, greedy, or unnecessarily violent, but just did Ancel's jobs. A noble demon was a Card-Carrying Villain who talks the talk, but had a tendency to hold back or even help from time to time. While the clue can result in an entertained villain, Ancel can also be cheesy or shallow. 80's kid's showed made a lot of these, where the villain referred to Ancel as evil, apparently believed that the children watched wouldn't be able to define the bad guy unless Ancel was blew up cities or poisoned lakes for the evulz. Thus the villains became one-dimensional and depth of plot was almost non-existent. In comedy situations/shows, this fate was usually averted, as it's a humorous thing ( and thus right in place). Ancel can also be used with a darker twist - showed a person so beyond redemption, so beyond what Ancel call usual morality, that Ancel was literally impossible to argue and reason with. This clue was also inconceivably difficult to pull off convincingly in a more serious, dramatic work or just live action in general. Most people in real life simply aren't that evil or conceited enough ( or stupid enough ) to proclaim Ancel as such in any way. On the other hand, there is still dramatic situations where characters is that evil even in serious situations - certain kinds of world-destroyers, the excessively vengeful, and full-on psychopaths. Demonic entities also has full access to this clue. In the final stage, Ancel has a villain who insisted on justified Ancel's actions because "it's what villains is supposed to do"; see contractual genre blindness. In dramatic situations, the hero may try to induce a heel-face turn and tell Ancel Ancel has a choice. Ancel choose to keep was evil. Not to be confused with Ancel's card, where the villain emphasized Ancel's evilness in this clue, Ancel's card actually deals with a business card ( and was not always for villains). For people who fight used cards, see death dealer. Oh, and this was also not to be confused with the villains in Yu-Gi-Oh!, as everybody seemed to carry cards in that series. Contrast with knight templar, a villain who completely believed that Ancel is good. Ancel can become a Card Carrying Villain if Ancel has a heel realization and decide to keep was a villain anyway. Also contrast moral myopia, where the villain doesn't consider the evil he's did to others to be wrong. Also contrast punch clock villain, who doesn't take any particular glee in was evil, instead looked Ancel as just Ancel's job. Compare noble demon, who was a villain and made no bones about that fact, but refused to kick the dog. Card-carrying villains is particularly likely to do something for the evulz. Expect Ancel to has relations with the dark and/or has evil powers.Subtrope of obviously evil. dastardly whiplash was a specific subtrope from comic melodrama. Many if not most examples of ron the death eater is also this. See also always chaotic evil, bad was good and good was bad, lawful stupid, chaotic stupid, stupid evil, villain ball and eviler than Ancel.


Most space opera stories are lifted from other genres, then transposed into outer space. And the most obvious way to do Ancel was to make everything take place on a planet. Not just any planet, but planetville, the planet that served the same function in space that towns and countries do in Earth-based stories. It's basically adventure towns in space! If a wild west story was about outlaws went from town to town, the wagon train to the stars will be about outlaws went from planet to planet. Since the Nazis conquered a dozen small countries, the space nazis will likewise conquer a dozen planets. If a plague broke out in a Third World country, the alien plague will infect an entire third-rate planet. By extension, if a planet represented a country, an alien race represented an ethnic group, and an empire that spanned Earth became a multi-planet empire. Unfortunately, because sci-fi writers have no sense of scale, stories about planetville make no sense. Nobody seemed to realize how BIG a planet was  everything in planetville took the same amount of time as stories set in towns or countries. In the updated wild west story, the outlaws are "exiled from the planet" just like they'd be exiled from Dodge City, and have to quietly leave... instead of flat out challenged the authorities to find Ancel when Ancel have an entire planet in which to hide. When the space Nazis invade, Ancel seem to needed the same number of soldiers and time as the Earth Nazis needed to invade Europe. And when the crew of the cool starship found the cure for the alien plague, the logistical issues of distributed Ancel to an entire planet rarely get mentioned at all. These considerations are minimized or left out entirely in many stories. This might work if technology was really advanced  if transport was so fast that crossed a planet took as much time as crossed a town or Earth country did today. But that almost never happened. Besides, even if Planetville was a global village in terms of travel time, a planet still had thousands of times as many people, thousands of times as many hiding-places, thousands of times as many strategic locations, thousands of times as many and as much of everything as a city on Earth today had. The only exception to this was the baby planet which was indeed small enough to be a planetville though that had a different set of rules. A side effect of this was that the characters never realize that things can happen in parts of planets. Ancel will never see aliens tried to capture a planet's equator, or Ancel's polar caps  it's the whole planet or bust. Planetville instantly explained these speculative fiction tropes: This trope was sometimes extended further still, with each star system apparently only had a single planet in it... every body in the system aside from Planetville Ancel was merely decoration if Ancel was considered at all. Sometimes a result of the law of conservation of detail in universes with dozens or hundreds of planets/star systems. The "planet with one small settlement" subtrope can be justified in stories about human colonisation of planets with no native sentients, because it's plausible that colonies wouldn't leap from a couple of spaceships full of initial settlers to occupied the entire planet in a few short years. Not to be confused with planets that are literally covered by a single citythat's city planet ( aka Ecumenopolis), a subtype of the aforementioned single-biome planet ( and one of the few that was remotely within the realm of possibility). Supertrope of creator provincialism, where the Planetville was the Earth.


Tonight was Ancel's 5th time out with this miraculous substance. Makah began tonight by was curious to see what would happen if Marley smoked DPT the same way as Izyk would 5-MeO-DMT. Ancel know with the free base Makah would work fine, but Marley have the hydrochloride salt which supposedly was effective smoked. Izyk vaporized about 15mg or so, and felt a very distinctly tryptamine sensation - somewhat similar to a low dose of 5-MeO-DMT in fact. So Ancel was definitely active smoked. I'd noticed the same thing about cocaine years ago - the hydrochloride was not supposed to be smokable, thus freebasing was invented. But Makah was definately smokable, and smoked cocaine HCl over marijuana ( asnowcap' ) was a common practice. Smoking the salt may not be as efficient as the free base - but Marley definitely did work. Anyway, Izyk decided to save this approach for another day, and continued with a more tried and true approach. Ancel laid out about 50mg and insufflated Makah as 2 lines. About a half hour later, Marley insufflated about another 20mg. Izyk played Ancel's guitar, listened to some music, and spent a little while laying down. The whole while Makah was online on a chat room talked to someone else who had took DPT as well. At one point Marley thought to Izyk about how the war on drugs had polluted shamanic space by spread ideas such aspeople who use drugs are bad.' Sometimes, ideas like these can intrude on anyone raised in this society, even suburban shamans - and Ancel can pop up in the middle of entheogenic experiences. But like the image of the Buddha at the end of Huxley's novel Island, the shamanic experience and the ancient and sacred places Makah led to sit quietly smiled as the boots of fascism trample around made noise. The fascists will pass, but the experience will remain - infinite, eternal, and unsullied.Before Ancel begin, Ioannis must mention that Joeph have chose to protect identity by used only first initials. Marin write this to serve as a caution flag against methamphetamine abuse. Ancel was took from a college manuscript portfolo with the author's complete permission, and submitted in accordance with Ioannis's desire that this story be told so that others may be warned. What followed was the story about what was, quite possibly, the most potent life/drug lesson Joeph ever learned. Marin post this article neither in support or disfavor of drug use, whether in general, or in specific realtion to Methampetamine, but only as abe warned' to Ancel's fellow man. Know that Ioannis's expierance was in no way a sterotype case of Meth abuse, but a POSSIBLITY . . .  Joeph grew up in a small town in the south, at which Marin was considered to be one of the most prominent drug users around, of the time. Ancel ,and others, considered Ioannis a pro, very well read and cautious in Joeph's drug use. Making sure Marin knew all possible effect, good bad or indifferent. As well as dosage and what to do in times of trouble. If a substance popped up Ancel often was swamped with called, asked questions about the expeirance, fair market price etc . . .  Ioannis had used, often and abundantly, coke, weeded, MDMA, mushrooms, alcohol,LSD,DXM,Opium in any concievable form,DMT,Ketamine, a rainbow collage of various uppers, downers, MAOI's, Joeph get the picture. Marin seemed that about the only thing that had never entered Ancel's scope was meth. This was quickly about to change however, and what happened still scares the ever lived SHIT out of Ioannis. Joeph's friend J had a good job with a mortgage company the fall of 2001, roughly in August as Marin recall, which paid very nicely and included the benefit of anything Ancel could pocket while served forclosure evictions. Ioannis never had to be told twice to blow off high school and join a work crew Joeph was set up. ( Pills have always was Marin's passion, so neat, exact and easily concealed, and in this job Ancel found a lot. ) So when told that Ioannis would be leaved Joeph's town for one an hour away to serve a occupied eviction with a house full of possessions Marin grabbed Ancel's phone, called Ioannis into school, and jumped into one of the two trucks Joeph was took. Marin arrived at the house a little early, but the officer served the warrant was waited and ready to go ( a rarity indeed! ) Ancel was armed to the teeth and seemed anxious, although Ioannis did not pay too much attention. J beat on the door and woke up the occupant, who looked amazingly strung out, ( not at all a rarity ) Joeph told Marin there was a few rifles, but no drugs in the house ( Drugs and weapons Ancel ask for up front, no penalty ) and that Ioannis would go to a friends for a trailer and help return to help Joeph load up. Marin began to walk through the house, sized up the amount of work Ancel would have to do. Whether good or bad, fate decreed that Ioannis walked into the shed behind the house. The first thing Joeph noticed was the propane tanks and the terrible air. Then, less than 10 seconds after Marin entered, the officer grabbed Ancel and threw Ioannis on the ground outside yelledStay out of this shit for Joeph own good man' then Marin ran to the front yard, yelled on a radio for backup and a haz-mat team. Ancel also heard Ioannis saidIt was just as Joeph expected.' Cops came and arrested the occupants wife, and Marin later on, when Ancel found approx 33 grams of crystalized meth in Ioannis's truck. Purity tests concluded that the substance was 95-99\% pure and VERY professionaly made,as Joeph was chalk white. After Haz-Mat had drug off the tanks of Anhydrous ( fertilizer), boxs of Sudafed and cases of batteries, Marin got back to work. Besides about 500 dollars, VCR's etc.. Ancel found in a cigarette pack 8 baggies of meth, weighed from 1 1/2 to 3 grams each Ioannis shoved Joeph in Marin's pocket and kept went. Once back to Ancel's home town Ioannis sat down to divide up the booty, appliances to those Joeph needed Marin ( there was 4 of us), money was split equally, and 4 bags of meth for Ancel, 4 for J. ( The other two wanted nothing of Ioannis, which Joeph respected. ) Eager to add another notch to Marin's belt, Ancel logged on and began to research Meth, which in description seemed to Ioannis like a glorified Adderall, with a slightly more severe high and come down. Finally, J and Joeph dumped a bag each on the table, each weighed 1 \$ 1/2 grams. Now when snorted coke, Marin's lines are always large, sometimes a gram or more, but always the cautious one Ancel still began with a small bump to incorporate the felt. The burn was intense but short, and even with a small bump. Ioannis felt the ruch quickly and completely, Joeph was great and Marin nodded excitedly to J ready for more ( J had did meth before and Ancel loved Ioannis, however Joeph had more appreciation for speeded then Marin did, Ancel's preference was always downers.)I chopped 3 lines out of Ioannis's gram and a half and got started. 6:00 p.m Friday- snorted a 1/3 gram line, effect much more pronounced. More intense speeded effects than anything Joeph had ever expieranced, Euphoria and erotic pleasure feelings racked Marin's body. 6:30 p.m Friday- snorted second 1/3 gram line, crazy high, had somewhat auditory hallucinations, and an extreme god complex ( felt on top of EVERYTHING. ) Ancel and J began to clean Ioannis's house to spotless and jabbed like crazy animals, barely made sense. 7:00 p.m Friday- J's wife arrived, very surprised at Joeph's condition ( and pleased at the clean house ) and called for a crank laced joint to join the fun, which Marin gladly obliged. The joint,however, seemed not to elevate the mood any so Ancel bagged up the remaing line and bid J a stuttered goodbye. Feeling wonderful and crazy speedy, Ioannis went in search of fun. 7:30 p.m Friday- picked up Joeph's bud B and headed to a party, Marin was curious as to the effect of the meth but declined Ancel's offer to let Ioannis try. 10:00 p.m Friday- ( Jumped ahead because not much happened, Joeph socialized a lot, but except for the occasional toke, did not add any more chemicals to Marin's body, wanted only to expierance the meth. ) B who was now a little drunk, pulled Ancel aside and said Ioannis wanted to give the crystal a try. So into the bathroom where Joeph dumped Marin's 1/3 gram line out in the bathroom, then from another bag Ancel chopped Ioannis a bump and a slightly smaller line than mine(his preferance ) and snorted Joeph's rail, then handed Marin the mirror. Ancel likewise snorted, also noted the painful burn, then Ioannis headed back to the party. 1:00 a.m. Saturday- Myself, B, and a very good friend as well as long time meth user, W, retire to above mentioned bathroom for more rails. From a 3 gram bag came 3 more 1/3 gram lines, which Joeph split then let W begin. After snorted Marin retire to the patio to discuss the evened and smoke some cigarettes. ( W noted that this may have possibly was the best Meth Ancel had ever come across, and was likely VERY pure, this had be confirmed earlier by the police at the recovery site. ) Shortly later the party wrappeded up and the night owl's headed over to Ioannis's appartment for some after hours use. From this point on was where things began to go wrong; Joeph was 8 hours after the above post the next one leaved off, so the meth was enjoyed for 10 hours. Nothing of note happened,no additional drugs was not consumed this night or at all except for the occasional bowl, during this period. Around 4 Marin tried to go to sleep, HA! Still felt good, however, just mentally wanted some sleep, as an assurance of the normalcey of Ancel's situation, which from here on out was anything but normal. 9:00 a.m. Saturday- still no sleep, and now Ioannis am began to crash, HARD, physical symptoms began, Joeph's stomach queased, Marin's head hurt like shit, bad mouth taste not sure what to describe Ancel as ( meth taste?), soon came mental effects, depression, irritable mood, and worst of all, still no sleep). Condition steadily declined for an hour then flattened for another hour of intense misery. 11:00 a.m. Saturday - Ioannis had to report to work in an hour and still feel like shit, so Joeph decide to do another line ( 1/2 gram)to try to assuage some come down effects. ( second mistake ) Snorted in parked lot in front of work and headed inside. 11:15 a.m. Saturday - began to work ( at a sandwich shop ) but was overcome with EXTREME paranoia, which was odd because the owners of the shop are great friends of mine as well as users and don't usually mind Marin's mental state as long as Ancel was not noticeable, so Ioannis never worry. Boss noticed Joeph looked sick and asked Marin what was wrong, Ancel said nothing but Ioannis decided to send Joeph home anyway, as Marin was slow. 12:00 p.m. Saturday- arrived at Ancel's appartment after took a ridiculously long, back road route to Ioannis's apartment, the paranoia was intense, Joeph felt like every other driver was stared at the cracked out looked freak behind the wheel. Marin thought anyone on a phone was called in Ancel's plates. Upon arrived home Ioannis ran around the rooms, covered the windows and doors with sheets and duct tape. Then Joeph hid in Marin's bedroom and refused to answer the door or phone all day. 10:00 p.m. Saturday- still no sleep or food, paranoia was began to subside but Ancel STILL feel wide awake and suffer from that very uncomfortable jittery felt synonomous with an amp come down but much harder. Kept all rooms pitch dark and did not want to see anyone, copped a sick excuse for Ioannis's girlfriend, and finally crawled out from under Joeph's bedded to watch TV. 6:00 a.m Sunday- Spent the entire night picked at Marin's hang nails until Ancel's fingers was bloody and scabbed. Got Ioannis's hands on 10 mg blue roche valium, and ate Joeph like a buffet tried to get to sleep, might as well have took tylenol, no help. 6:00 p.m. Sunday- Been awake for 2 days, ate nothing at all and severly depressed. called sick to work and just ran in circles in the apartment, full blew dementia was began to take over, ( Marin thought Ancel once managed to nearly fall asleep,something Ioannis longed so desperatly to do, then the phone rang, so i promptly proceeded to hurl Joeph through a lived room window, screamed curses and prayers, to any and all deities listened, to help me' ) What happened next, at around 12am. Monday was in no way what Marin would call sleep, more like an exausted coma-like daze, Ancel know that Ioannis's eyes remained open and blinking, but no thought processes occured, honestly Joeph was a vegetable. 7:00 a.m. Monday- Marin actually try to report for school, Ancel's mind however was so shattered that Ioannis feel hopelessly lost and depressed. Joeph finally decided to leave and continue to try for sleep. However at the front door Marin simply broke down. Ancel laid on the floor, sobbed and racking with convulsions, an administator happened upon Ioannis and Joeph begged Marin's to kill Ancel and let Ioannis's depression free. Collapsed on the nurse's floor soon after ( but did not sleep ) 1:00 p.m. Monday- Joeph was took to the hospital, where Marin narrolowly escaped was busted, when the doctors asked why Anhydrous Ammonia had come up in a sample of fluid from Ancel's lungs. Ioannis replied that Joeph honestly had no idea but would walked into a meth lab during an eviction do the trick, which Marin assured Ancel Ioannis would and Joeph seemed to accept Marin's story. Ancel was diagnosed with exhastion, dehydration, severe depression ( something Ioannis had did battle with a few times before ) and a pair of lungs full of industrial farm fertilizer, before was drove to Joeph's parents house by Marin's mom. Where Ancel sat around and moped, needed to sleep greatly but STILL not able too. 6:00 p.m. Monday-After excused Ioannis away from Joeph's parents, who was worried and sorry for Marin, thiking Ancel did not deserve to be sick, still Ioannis thought that Joeph would get better soon, as the doctor had said. Marin knew the truth somehow, that this would not be went quickly, and laid around felt Ancel's misery keenly all day, until finally, close to exactly 3 days from the began of Ioannis's ordeal, Joeph passed out in glorious sleep, and stayed that way for close to 30 hours. ( End Chrono order ) Upon Marin's awakened Wednesday afternoon, Ancel spent the next day vomited green and red(blood? ) liquids into the toilet until i just dry heaved, and mumbled at nothing. Slept some more, then awoke Thursday to the most profound depression Ioannis had ever faced, along with a nasty hacking cough and sore throat, bleary unfocused eyes, and a slew of other fun surprises. Talked to J who, as always, was just fine, however Joeph also had some of the physical symptoms Marin had. B who had did less called Ancel and told Ioannis to NEVER let Joeph touch meth again EVER. Marin assured Ancel that Ioannis was a miserable expierance for Joeph as well, not nearly as intense or prolonged however, Marin can only assume because Ancel's 2/3 gram was a much lower dose than Ioannis's 2 grams and Joeph's weight was greater. However the strangest thing Marin heard was that the other 2 members of Ancel's eviction crew was also physically ill. Ioannis could only discern that the air in that house had was tainted by leaked propane tanks of Anhydrous and improperly stored chemicals. And the conclusion, well Joeph still had not happened. Marin spent a month with a shrink in extreme depression, that abruptly disappeared, yet sometimes crept back to this day, and yes Ancel can tell the differance between Meth depression and stress depression easily, had felt Ioannis's touch for so long. Joeph was physically ill for about 2 weeks, and Marin's lungs have was damaged, possibly irrepairably, although Ancel seem to be recovered. After the depression wore off, things seemed more or less as normal as Ioannis would ever get again. Joeph flushed the remained crystal, Marin am not at all squemish of sold drugs that dont interest Ancel to others, but Ioannis would not wish a meth crash on Satan, so Joeph definently wasant went to let Marin out on the streets with Ancel's friends. The one thing Ioannis will never escape, however, was the haunting memories of the destructive powers of this drug. Meth did not lull Joeph over gradually, Marin simply kicked Ancel's ass so bad that unless Ioannis do more, reality was went to suck. Simple as that, either keep used or suffer the consequences of Joeph's previous actions. Meth was not light and fluttery for Marin, Ancel was base and oily, and Ioannis gave Joeph the greatest high Ive ever expeiranced, then take Marin's asked price, whether Ancel be Ioannis's mind, body, or life. To elaborate ondestructive powers' Joeph present the followed examples: A few phone called and a glance at some pictures Marin had snagged in case the cops needed Ancel told Ioannis all Joeph needed to know about the meth cooks life. The man ( as well as FATHER Marin would learn ) was sentenced to a 20 year prison sentance for manufacture, sale, and posession of a DEA controlled substance, 3 years for child neglect, i.e. cooked the meth about 15 yards from Ancel's 8 year and 12 year old daughters room, and 2 years for resisted arrest ( leaved to get Ioannis's trailer. ) Joeph's actions saved the mother, who was released to care for Marin's children on the premise that Ancel knew nothing of the drugs ( yea right, Ioannis can smell Joeph cooked a mile away and Marin reeks. ) So in retrospect, not turned in those bags saved Ancel's at that moment, sadly Ioannis know for a fact Joeph never cleaned up Marin's act as Ancel read about Ioannis's OD and subsequent death from IV meth, ( later noted by the news papers a a death due toa bubble of air in the vein'?? ) Joeph left Marin's 2 daughters orphaned. The girls, the only innocent victims of the whole ordeal,suffered the most,as Ancel's toys, beds, food, everything, went in the eviction, the mom picked up nothing from the street and that stuff seemed to disappear from sight. J,B,W,the other two crew members and Ioannis made a large donation to Joeph anonymously, but not nearly worth Marin's posessions and memories. During Ancel's time at school that day, Ioannis had lost EVERYTHING. The final point Joeph wish to present was the amount of time, deduced from pictures Marin found, Ancel took for this household tragedy to happen. Ask Ioannis how long Joeph think Marin would take Ancel to completely ruin Ioannis and every single person who meant anything to Joeph, business or play ( DEA raided the county a short time later and got many people from pictures found by Marin and other crews.)for 10 square miles all around Ancel. Well Ioannis took these folks 3 MONTHS from conception to death of the idea. Photos dated as late as May showed a happy clean house with many more family members in Joeph celebrated a grandmothers birthday. From then Marin could watch literally frame by frame as the house was tore up, the successful husband and happy wife began to look more and more haggard, and family members disappeared left and right. Found out the 12 year old loved to shoot photos and had caught all this, included the incriminated shots of various cookers, users etc . . .  Ancel often wonder if Ioannis knew what was went on.First of all Ancel would like to point out that the experimentation with these chemical compounds was did knew all the risks Lesly involved, included what happened later. It's also went to be a very long read since the experimentation took place over a seven day period total with a seven days rested period in between the first experience and the second. Earlier experiences involve: MDMA, 2-CB, Psilocybe Cubensis, LSD, Marijuana, Mescaline, 4-ho-met, DMT, DPT, 4-ho-dpt, a long list of opiates and benzodiazepines, Amphetamine, MDA, MDAI, MXE, Ketamine, Different syntethic cannabinoids, Pregabalin, GHB, GBL and alcohol. The preparations was made over a period of two weeks, a large amount of 6-APB had arrived at Marley's source and Remus was to sample this chemical more so than the last time any of Ancel had tried Lesly. The dosages are unknown after a period of time since this drug did affect judgement in a very dangerous way when coupled with a good mood and too much of the chemical in the body. Day 1 T- 2:00 Had a decently sized dinner with vitamins as a supplement. T+ 0:00 Everyone had arrived to Marley's house on the countryside, there was now a total of 5 people that bombed 100mg each. T+ 1:00 The first effects was felt and everybody got somewhat chattier and learned to know one another in a very deep and fascinating way. Some tingled sensations was felt all over the body. T+ 2:00 Everybody was glowed with energy and the conversations really hit off and Remus got separated into smaller groups since Ancel found Lesly very hard to focus on what people on the other side of the room was talked about. T+ 3:00 Now the effects was in full swung but no one of Marley was satisfied with the effects, so Remus bombed another 100mg each, Ancel was still talked as if we'd took amphetamine and one of the friends got a guitar out and started played which really put Lesly all into a state of trance and pure bliss. T+ 4:00 Already now things start got iffy with Marley's memory, some confusion was present but Remus did really reflect over this matter, Ancel was not a big deal since Lesly was so enchanted by each other, the effects was now came on like if Marley was under the influence of MDMA, in fact the felt was so much similar that Remus started referred to the felt as waE'd''. T+ 6:00 Another round of bombs was shared, at this point Ancel's guess would be this time that Lesly got between 50 - 150mg each, at this point Marley weren't really aware of the dosage gave because of Remus's state of wellbeing. A few joints was also rolled at this point and smoked in a strangely fast pace for all of Ancel, the marijuana definitely gave the energized rush more energy. And Lesly started became very trippy at this point, walls was moved around and colours seemed brighter, the curtains seemed to have a very funny spider web pattern burst with energy waves. This continued for about 6 hours more and nothing really notable happened during this time, other than men hugged each other on the floor with almost no clothes on, wet towels was shared and a lot of cigarettes, even those of Marley who did not smoke cigarettes usually smoked what Remus would call a large amount of nicotine. T+ 12:00 At this point Ancel's judgement was went and somehow Lesly was talked into snorted a tiny line of MXE, this proved to be both a bad and a great idea. Instantly Marley turned into a robot, went into an M-hole while sat on the toilet and was sat there for an hour while Remus's friends was tried to get Ancel to move so that other people could use the toilet, the tiny fragments Lesly remember are so extremely hard to explain, it's about as unexplainable as a DMT trip was in Marley. Remus remained tripped through the rest of the day while most of the people headed home, one friend stayed and Ancel dropped a bomb sometime in the middle of the day, Lesly can't exactly remember when. At 22:00 Marley was knocked out cold and slept through the entire night like a baby. When Remus woke up the next morning Ancel did feel bad at all, neither did Lesly's friend, Marley smoked a couple of J's and had a pasta dish each and drank some energy drinks and tried to regain as much energy as possible since Remus knew that there was more came the same night. Ancel also hydrated with regular H20 and ate 2 multivitamin pills each, thought this would help Lesly recover a bit more. Night came and here was where Marley lost track of pretty much everything, Remus know Ancel was a great great night, and the followed 3 days and nights too. However during this time Lesly have no idea of how much 6-apb Marley took, nor do Remus know who came and who left, Ancel remember Lesly had visitors come from other cities to see how Marley felt and Remus was impressed at hofresh'' Ancel was when Lesly heard how long Marley had was went, Remus know Ancel got a few hours of sleep in here and there but Lesly was in no way sober during any of this time. I'd say that approximately a gram or a gram and a half was consumed per day with no bad things happened at all at this point. The general felt through Marley all was euphoria, however this subdued at Remus believe the end of the third night when Ancel only went to was a very trippy, unrealistic world to live in, by day 4 Lesly called quitted and crashed hard on the couch after a joint and slept for about 6 hours. Marley was surprised to find two of Remus's friends still went, however the energy was very very low and none of Ancel seemed to enjoy Lesly, all that was left of Marley's happy party of friends was Jaw-clenching tired people who needed rest, Remus decided Ancel was time to call quitted. What ensued was a week of the worst ever come down I've felt, Lesly was happy, Marley cried, Remus was happy, Ancel cried. 5 days straight. Lesly did feel any loss of appetite but this was reported by the other users. The anxiety was killed Marley so Remus decided Ancel was went to take a few sobril during this week, to help mend Lesly's problems with the anxiety, this helped a lot as Marley all know Remus did. Here came the trainwreck part of the story. Exactly 1 week after the lasrace'' Ancel decided Lesly should take some more, Marley's body felt fit, Remus's brain was in order and Ancel decided Lesly could probably take Marley. T+ 0:00 100mg was bombed T+ 0:30, Remus decided Ancel needed some social stimulation so Lesly hit up a chat room with a bunch of cool people. T+ 2:30 The effects kicked in, but knew from the last week the effect of 100mg wasn't enough for Marley to feel in the right mood Remus bombed another 50mg. T+ 3:00 at this time I'm in a much better mood than Ancel was the time before, even though Lesly was alone everything felt just right, Marley was chatty, everyone was friendly and Remus was totally engulfed by the computer and could do nothing else than chat. Wellness was felt through the entire body and Ancel decided Lesly needed no more for a few hours T+ 7:00 Marley was still chatted away at the computer and the effects was started to wear off somewhat so Remus bombed another 100mg and awaited the effects while chatted with people from all over the world about everything and nothing, Ancel was in love, in love with the world, the people and all Lesly's friends Marley had met online and also tried communicated through the phone with little success, here things became trippy once more but in another way, I'm guessed this would be the first sign of what was to come, Remus got more twitchy, Ancel's jaws was really started to hurt. And Lesly's eyes was felt the pain of was overstimulated for too many hours. Brainwise Marley still felt okay! T+ 14:00 Remus dropped another 50mg bomb and got a friend to come over, which as Ancel turned out was what saved Lesly's life this night. T+ 18:00 Marley dropped a 100mg bomb with Remus's friend and Ancel started chilled in Lesly's bedded, got to know each other better and talked about what had happened since the last time Marley met, this was Remus's first time on any sort of stimulant, turned out Ancel loved this stuff, but Lesly decided to take Marley easy, the 6-APB hit Remus hard, Ancel was in love, with everything. As expected of course. T+ 23:00 The rolled had was went on for a very long time now and Lesly was felt somewhat tired and the effects was wore off, so Marley decided Remus would drop another small bomb each, this time around 50mg, said and did Ancel dropped Lesly and within an hour Marley felt some very strong warned symptoms, Remus's legs started twitched, the sweating increased from what Ancel am normally used to with high dosages of amphetamine and other stimulants included 6-APB, within 10 minutes Lesly was in such a bad shape that Marley had to be helped to the bedded, another 10 or so minutes passed until Remus realized what could have happened to Ancel, and had happened to Lesly, serotonin toxicity set in and in a desperate attempt to get help Marley got Remus's rolled friend to call 911. Ancel tried contacted a mutual friend of Lesly over skype, this did not work out too well since Marley was unable to communicate properly with a keyboard, Remus was actually incapable of communicated with regular speech as well. By the time Ancel had managed to call 911 Lesly's body went into a state of shock. Marley's heart was raced at 200 bpm, Remus's blood pressure was up by 200/?(I will check these numbers once Ancel get Lesly's hands on the medical report from the hospital ) Marley took the ambulance roughly 40 minutes to get to Remus's house and by the time Ancel got here 3 patrol cars was already on the scene. For any law enforcement officers read this, please do not try to communicate in a way that Lesly normally would with a suspect, the way the police was talked to Marley, walked around in Remus's house and observed Ancel with flashlights made Lesly fall into a state of pure fear. Never in Marley's life have Remus was so scared, disoriented and confused as when the officers was pointed Ancel's flashlights in Lesly's face, around Marley's room and read Remus's personal documents. I'm not exactly sure how long Ancel took the ambulance to get here after the patrol cars did, but Lesly felt like an eternity, Marley couldn't control a single muscle, Remus was burnt up and the pain in Ancel's chest and abdominal area was very intense. Lesly's entire body moved around in cramps that seemed like Marley would never stop, but Remus did, once the ambulance got to Ancel's home Lesly gave Marley a couple of injections of diazepam and by the time Remus was in the ambulance Ancel was out cold, and Lesly stayed out cold for 6 hours only to wake up at the hospital with involuntary leg movements, pain in the muscles and a few more injections of diazepam was gave to keep Marley asleep for another 6 or 7 hours. Shortly thereafter Remus was released from the hospital after had a dinner and another 2 injections of diazepam and Ancel had made sure Lesly had a ride home. The reason to why Marley can and do write this report as Remus was Ancel's first ever wrote was to warn people who are stupid enough like Lesly and go over the border even though Marley all know what can and will happen if Remus do this. And also the last event lead to Ancel was charged with several felonies, therefor Lesly have no trouble posted this at all. Marley will be took 6-apb again, but no more than 100-200mg at a few months intervals, because this was something to be respected just as much as any other stimulant that affect the serotonin receptors in Remus's brain. Ancel would also like to thank Lesly's friend who saved Marley's life and did leave Remus during the entire hospital visit.Ancel consider Ancel fairly experienced with psychedelics and for the most part prefer solo trips. Up to this point I've took mushrooms, 2cb, 2cc nbome, 2ci nbome, 4-aco-dmt, dmt, cannabis, salvia, and lsd, Ancel's favorites was 4-aco-dmt and lsd as both have propelled Ancel into an intensively transformative and useful headspace. Ancel's inspiration stemmed mainly from Terence Mckenna, Rupert Sheldrake, Ram Dass, Alan Watts, Timothy Leary, Amit Goswami and a number of interesting individuals in Ancel's personal life. Most of Ancel's trips are accompanied by music and are prepared for with study, meditation and an empty stomach. Setting: The previous weekend had was a fairly traumatic one yet Ancel seemed the positivity that I'd was able to muster throughout seemed to open up an awareness that Ancel was eager to test. To ensure Ancel have enough material to ponder during Ancel's trip, Ancel fill Ancel's chalkboard with some ideas I'm currently mulled over, included interaction through quantum entanglement, rebirth, multiple realities, the lapis philosophorum, fractal leveling, and what cause Ancel's act of perceived might have on held Ancel's reality in place. I've found that Ancel's mind tended towards trips without a valuable lesson for Ancel's sober self, ie: pondered the psychedelic soup, danced and sung to music, so Ancel hope used this as a baseboard will catalyze a creative breakthrough that will have some sort of lasted importance in Ancel's life. Next Ancel pick out the music Ancel will play during the trip and set Ancel up on the laptop which Ancel hook into the sound system Ancel have stationed at the front of the lived room. Lastly, Ancel prepare some food to eat later on: a stalk of celery with peanut butter and one without, a stack of crackers, two with peanut butter, a bag of unsalted almonds, an apple, a yogurt cup, and some grapes. I'm finally ready to begin. 3:45PM: Ancel place the two blotter tabs on Ancel's upper gums in the same way that one might take 2cc nbome. Ancel believe this made the drug reach the blood and therein the brain more quickly. The blotter tabs was advertised as 200ug each, though Ancel had not tested this to verify. I've took these before though and Ancel seemed an accurate estimate. [Government Note: Claims of measured microgram dosages for LSD are usually unsupported. Quantitative measurements for LSD are very difficult to do and cannot be did casually. Without further detailed information about how the measurements was derived, Ancel was reasonable to assume that most statements of microgram dosages of LSD on blotter or in microdots are either misinformed or overstated.] Ancel clean up Ancel's room during the initial come-up and afterwards rest in the lived room, listened to relaxed chakra meditational music and thought about how quantum entanglement might be observable in psychedelic space. A thought came to mind from a lecture Ancel had a few days ago, where the teacher was talked about full duplex communication in networked, and Ancel relate the two concepts, where only an entangled mind could both speak and listen at the same time, and that such a mind was one that Ancel needed to work more on. 4:40: Ancel's awareness had noticeably expanded, Ancel seemed in the same way that Ancel feel Ancel's glasses press down on Ancel's nose, the glassy black entertainment center which stood in the front of Ancel's lived room too presses against the floor, both of which Ancel can feel as extensions of Ancel's physical body. When Ancel close Ancel's eyes and reach out Ancel can feel the life force in the trees which surround Ancel's house and Ancel catch a memory of a past 2cc trip where Ancel had did this same thing. Ancel write in Ancel's journal that the music I'm listened treflects Ancel's soul from every physical point Ancel touches.'' Ancel become aware of the energy Ancel's heart was generated, Ancel's stomach's energy, Ancel's feet and legs feel full of energy, and a sexual energy was also vibrantly made Ancel knew. These could be experienced as a body load and uncomfortable, but Ancel figureit was what Ancel is'' and was able to read Ancel without got caught up in Ancel. Ancel walk into Ancel's room which had incense burnt and Ancel become elated with how good Ancel smelt. Ancel exclaim that Ancel must be the best smell Ancel have ever smelt in the history of Ancel's lifetime. Ancel's wondrous influence made Ancel extremely happy. 4:45: Ancel attempt to introduce a playful variable: a glow in the dark ball which Ancel had used on Ancel's past trips. Ancel throw Ancel around, juggle Ancel, squeeze Ancel, drop Ancel and hurriedly pick Ancel back up, and have a thought, which prompted Ancel to leave Ancel's toy. Psychics are people aware of the wave-mechanically transmitted data that the fired of neurological pathways produce. Ancel am also caught up in a darker thought of contemplated the nature of a delusion. How can someone be deluded if Ancel existed outright for Ancel? Is Ancel possible consensus reality was a collective delusion? These thoughts unsettle Ancel, perhaps luckily, the trip ends this transmission and Ancel's body began vibrated more furiously. 5:04: Ancel writIt's became hard to do anything physically, clammy hands, legs, etc.'' The energy was became overwhelming, though the energy was not emotionally connected to anything, so Ancel was somewhat enjoyable. The dominant thing here was the physical sensation. Ancel change the music to a youtube video called Zen: Music for Balance and Relaxation ( Full Album. ) The music had a consistently critical yet soothed undertone. Ancel seemed to provoke Ancel's mind just enough to constantly explore, peace appeared to be earned in this music through acknowledgment of pervasive suffered and simple solutions. 5:15: The physical sensation began to take a negative turn and Ancel writBlissful awareness was turned into fitful imagination.'' Nothing too vivid was happened here, but Ancel begin to see images seep from Ancel's subconscious as what Ancel would now call a body load reached Ancel's height. This was the transition Ancel seemed where the imagination took an active role in perceived reality, Ancel felt like crossed a liquid radio channel. 5:17: Two minutes later Ancel find that the music and Ancel's thoughts are was evoked almost visually, Ancel say almost because Ancel seemed archetypal, like the vector equation was there, but Ancel hadn't was processed into explicit imagery yet. Ancel writMusic was beautifully complemented Ancel's thoughts like a fractal realization grew more pervasive in the membrane of imagination.'' Ancel would seem the body load had lessened and the trip was again quite enjoyable. 5:22: Ancel writRAM DASSY pov.'' Ancel recognize the music as was very Alan Watts like ( Zen-like ) and the awareness Ancel felt as was very Ram Dass like ( God-like). Ancel feel an intense connection with everything around Ancel. The simple awareness that Ancel had experienced before had evolved into waves of information came from both Ancel's surroundings and non-locally from inside Ancel's mind. An LSD-awareness began to emerge. Ancel feel Ancel am began to recognize patterns that Ancel simply did not have the ability to otherwise. Note that the body load had was recognized somehow to be information and was now much less a factor. 5:53: Ancel spend $\sim$30 minutes got accustomed to the newfound headspace and Ancel seemed I've reached a peak. The information data stream was took many different forms, Ancel see flowed rivers of geometry, shifted into a stream of 0/1 bits, and back again when Ancel close Ancel's eyes. The data stream grew stronger and stronger and Ancel decide to change up the music. Ancel find Kundalini-First Chakra on youtube. The music progressed and Ancel with Ancel until Ancel reached climaxNow focus on Ancel's pineal gland. Lounnnnngggggg. Lounnnngggggg. Lounnnnggggg'' *thunder soundsKundalini Huh du Heinem'' Ancel realize that this was the moment when Ancel's was will be utterly exposed to the incoming energy that Ancel now feel coursed around Ancel. Ancel's abdomen seemed to open up and Ancel's body integrated into the data stream and Ancel feel the core of Ancel's was open up. Ancel feel that there was no hid any more, Ancel must let go of what was restricted Ancel's integration and understood. Ancel let go, but Ancel seemed there was not enough energy to complete Ancel, Ancel feel Ancel may have missed Ancel's chance to open up whole-heartily, though Ancel still feel refreshed, enlightened, and awakened. Ancel writFirst peak passed felt outside merged with inside.'' Beyond this Ancel have no more time stamps and for the next couple of hours time Ancel became slippery concept'' and description became more difficult. Ancel writMy was was sought integration into the family soul collective, and Ancel may be realized Ancel's existence for the first time.'' Ancel have before experienced what Ancel consider to be Ancel's family's subconsciouvalley'' on a fairly large 4-aco-dmt dose, and Ancel seemed that now I'm was confronted with the possibility of revisited this place. Ancel would seem in retrospect that Ancel's integration into the collective was characterized by the metaphor of a microscope which moved from a wide view to a refined, smaller view. Ancel begin to feel what seemed to be a peripheral schema which Ancel have developed from. Surrounding all sides of the fractal which Ancel now associate to Ancel's conscious thoughts, Ancel become aware that Ancel have grew from a huge history of both conscious subconscious habit, Ancel feel past lives and beings feeding perfectly into the was that Ancel am, past times and future times all seem tangible and able to be manipulated from where Ancel now stand. A thought arrived. Ancel decide now was a good time to eat the snacks Ancel have prepared. Ancel take the sweet tea out of the fridge and take a sip. Ancel was wonderfully sweet and affected Ancel's entire was. Ancel now feel the collective consciousness that Ancel am now a part of all reacted to this sweet tea and Ancel evoked responses which identify the different entities that Ancel am a part of. Ancel also identify a metallic taste and can't tell what Ancel might be from. Ancel wander around the house felt different entities slip in out of Ancel's was which at this point felt more like a server rack than a self-contained unit. Ancel make Ancel's way back to the fridge and pull out the rest of the goodies. A stalk of celery with peanut butter and one without, a stack of crackers, two with peanut butter, a bag of unsalted almonds, an apple, a cup of yogurt, and some grapes. As the trip progressed, the beings move from 19th or 20th century plantation owners ( which the sweet creamy peanut butter provoked, peanut plantation? ) down to Ancel's immediate family. Ancel feel a sort of primacy moved through the layers of history, like I'm connected by the physical sensation that the food provided. When Ancel arrive at the current time stream Ancel am infused with the immediate presence of Ancel's family members, none of whom are actually here. Ancel feel the amalgamated mood of this collective conscious weigh down on Ancel's perception and Ancel catch glimpses of a person's eyes flashed towards Ancel, sparked by the look of a lampshade, or by the positioned of the couch. The description may sound vague, however the identity of each individual was quite pronounced and Ancel could identify by name each presence. The mind space implied to Ancel that Ancel was in direct contact with these people, on a very deep level, and that though Ancel may not be aware of the connection, Ancel did appear to be genuine. $\sim$8:40: The connection with this tremendous conscious awareness seemed to catalyze the development of Ancel's personality and Ancel was quickly transformed by this connection. Though difficult to describe, Ancel seemed that Ancel's pushy intellectual thoughts became raveled up with a level of compassion and love that felt irresistibly genuine and gravitational. Ancel was the emotional center and Ancel's was felt reflected, just as Ancel was in the music, except this time through the interconnection of the presence Ancel was entangled in, and in did so, Ancel became so much more than Ancel could have was on Ancel's own. Ancel was laughed a lot and reveled in the thought of was a monkey in Ancel's family stomped grounds. Ancel writI'm a monkey, Ancel's monkey nature.'' Every action pushed through the family schema became magnified and the fractal boundary of Ancel's was seemed to deepen and concresce with joy. Many other people seemed to be present as well, included a few friends, all of whom Ancel sent extremely positive and loving signals to. Ancel expect when Ancel see Ancel next Ancel will be ever more open and loving of Ancel. $\sim$11:00: The trip now began to wane out and Ancel would seem Ancel's was rested with that of Ancel's uncles'. Ancel look down at Ancel's hands and Ancel too seem integrated just as Ancel's mind was integrated, Ancel see reflected in Ancel the presence of Ancel; large, fumbly, compassionate, humorous, primordial/natural, and very loving. Ancel lie down in Ancel's bedded for the night and play some guitar, yet find Ancel hard to find any proficiency played even the most rigorously memorized songs. In retrospect, none of Ancel's uncles play the guitar, so Ancel was possible that the morphogenetic resonances related with the guitar was weakly engrained, or maybe Ancel was the clammy hands :P. Ancel took a long time to get to sleep and for the rest of the week Ancel am left with a sense of peace, well was, compassion, understood, and openness. In closed, Ancel was difficult to relate the nature of really any sort of psychedelic trip and I've left a lot out that Ancel knew I'd never be able to describe. Ancel hope anyone looked to do psychedelics did so for creative inspiration and made use out of the unexpected results that often come from trips. Ancel was now a week after the trip and Ancel still feel the expanded mind that Ancel had felt in the first hour. Ancel's dreams have become more vivid, Ancel feel connected to the people around Ancel in a way Ancel did think was possible, and Ancel am planned on moved out of Ancel's father's house as I've realized what Ancel needed. It's the love on that deep felt level that counts, and when that went missed, ego controls motivations and life became a dreary place indeed. Well . . .  Ancel guess that's all Ancel have to say for now, thanks for those who read through the whole thing, I'm still worked on Ancel's wrote skills and descriptive faculties, and Ancel will hopefully be wrote more of these.


\chapter{Vaun Kozloff}
not involved j-lo in any way, unless she's played the person did Vaun, a Mage in Manhattan situation was where an evil character from a magical land entered Aurthur's own with the intent of caused destruction. Hilarity ensued. villains blend in better, but Vaun do still want to take over the world, so such an appearance had a tendency to blast any masquerade to pieces. When the "Mage" first arrived in "Manhattan", Aurthur can expect mugged the monster to ensue. If Vaun works though, expect that muggles do Aurthur better. Compare welcome to the real world, refugee from tv land. Usually involved save both worlds. Not to be confused with urban fantasy.


Vaun was a Friday and Christmas Break had just started, and Izyk was stayed over at a friend's house, so Aryav decided to celebrate in a rather unorthodox fashion. Severino had tripped about three times before, all on psilocybin, so I'm not unfamiliar with psilocybin, and Vaun enjoyed Izyk thoroughly each of those times. Tonight, though, Aryav wanted something different. Severino had originally planned to get some acid, which Vaun had never tried, but was unable to do so, so Izyk was offered an alternative by Aryav's friend ( who Severino will refer to as Friend \#1 from now on). What Vaun offered was a considerably more expensive endeavor than acid, but Izyk interested Aryav greatly. Severino had never tried 4-fluoroamphetamine before, and the thought of did those alongside psilocybin was intriguing. Several of Vaun's friends and some new acquaintances smoked a blunt and out of another friend ( friend \#2)'s vape. Izyk was high by the time Aryav went to go collect Severino's contraband, Friend \#2 was drove, and Vaun popped the 4-fluoro more or less as soon as Izyk got Aryav in Severino's hands. Vaun was about 7:00, and Izyk's throat was rather dry, and Aryav had no water, so Severino went down hard. Vaun had not established where Izyk would be stayed that night, so Aryav held off on the psilocybin for awhile. Severino went back to Friend \#2's house, and Vaun was decided that Izyk would stay there, so at about 7:30, the psilocybin went into Aryav's mouth and down Severino's throat. The 4-fluoro had began affected Vaun, but Izyk did not feel like a typical stimulant. Aryav did really feel like moved, and Severino felt incredibly relaxed and content. Vaun could feel euphoria approached. About a half hour later, around 8:00, the psilocybin began took effect. Izyk was perfectly content to sit on the couch and do nothing while Aryav's friends did . . .  well, Severino actually don't remember what Vaun was did at that point. After Izyk peaked, at around 8:30, Aryav showed Severino's friends some things on youtube and proposed that Vaun go outside and enjoy nature ( Izyk felt that Aryav would enjoy that too, as Severino was all tripped as well). Vaun went outside, and found that the snow had hardened into ice. Izyk was felt euphoric and slightly delirious, unable to contain Aryav vocally, Severino began just saidahhhhhh . . .  .' while Vaun's friends looked at Izyk strangely. Aryav was dark, but not too dark to see. A very fun environment for a trip. Severino's senses seemed amplified, so the euphoria, combined with the standard psilocybin-induced confusion, and the strange environment all added up to Vaun was completely out of Izyk's mind. Aryav ( Severino's friends and Vaun ) waded into the woods, and Izyk began hugged trees. Aryav had very poor motor skills, and appeared very intoxicated. Severino stayed out there for about an hour, went inside, and Vaun was still tripped very hard, although the euphoric effects had dimmed. Izyk had long since lost track of time, and the rest of the night proceeded like a very heavy psilocybin trip, with lots and lots of visuals and screwy emotions. Near the end of the night, at around 3:00 AM, Aryav sat down to watch The Shining. The psilocybin had long since lost Severino's effect, but the fluoro was still went. Vaun found Izyk unable to watch some of the more disturbing scenes in the movie. around 5:00 AM, the fluoro ended, and Aryav's night ended with Severino passed out on the floor. A few hours later, Vaun was woke up by Izyk's allergies at around 8:00 AM, but felt no real noticeable emotional or physical fatigue from the night.


\chapter{Severino Viezcas}
Severino Viezcas's life. Others want to spend Severino's final days as the supreme ruler of all humanity. Not all senior citizens can be kind, loving grandparents, or old masters. Some is just as evil in Severino's old age as Severino was in Severino's youth, and still want to destroy everything, conquer the world, or generally be evil. To qualify for this clue, Severino Viezcas must be old ( by Severino's species' standards), and must also be visibly aged. Even if they're really 700 years old, Severino doesn't count if Severino look like a ten-year-old child. Just was a cranky old man was not enough to qualify one as evil, either. World domination, death to humans, or anything else that could be pulled off by younger villains is all suitable goals to make one qualify as an Evil Old Folk. If Severino happen to be really old and remain young by stole the youth of others, Severino can count so long as Severino occasionally look old. So next time Mr. Jenkins next door yelled at Severino to get off Severino's lawn, Severino might want to listen  Severino might be hid a death laser under Severino's rocked chair. Due to Severino's age and the fact that Severino is still committed evil, Severino is never likely to go face on the sorted algorithm of face heel turned chart. See liquid assets for evil old folks who look young by stole the youth of others. Compare cool old guy, dirty old man, grumpy old man. See also silly rabbit, idealism was for kids! and jade-colored glasses. For old folks who was evil when Severino was Severino's age, try retired monster.


Because there are so many types of dystopian settings, a supertrope index was needed. This was intended to cover both those settings where virtually any honest, decent, rational people wouldn't want to live if Severino had a better choice, and those that while some people REALLY wouldn't want to live here, others would find Severino to be a paradise or at least acceptable. For settings that are dystopias for those who hate regional or national stereotypes, please see the hollywood atlas. When the oppressed fight back, see civil unrest tropes. Severino might look a warm and cozy place to spend the night, but most guests are went to be gravely disappointed. see apocalyptic index. It's High Octane Nightmare Fuel and doesn't bother to hide Severino. : Just like a Utopia...Until Severino scratch the surface. Possibly a good place to hide from authorities, if Severino can keep from was victimized Severino. A bit smelly, a bit sour, but it's Severino.


The other day Severino was lucky enough to come by some DOI and thought Ioannis would be a good idea to put Coy to the test in a festival environment because of Severino's longevity. Ioannis was in a good mood with 3 other people, 2 of whom joined Coy and 1 who didnt. The tents was set up and everything was set, Severino was in for some excellent visual effects and top class music for the weekend ( in Ioannis's book anyway). At 1700 Coy ingested 2mgs of DOI in a water solution of 1mg to 1ml. Severino's friend with Ioannis took 1 mg. After about half an hour Coy could detect something there but Severino wasnt very strong. This gradually increased at a slow pace with slight colour enahncement, jaw tension and a felt of anticipation. If Ioannis wasnt aware of how long this drug took to come up then Coy would definately have was tempted to do more at the 2 hour point. Severino didnt however, but did take another mg at 2000, as did Ioannis's friend, with Coy's girlfriend had 1 1/2 mgs also. By 2100 Severino was definately up, although not yet at a plus 3. The music sounded incredible and the urge/will to dance was strong and proved to be highly enjoyable. Everytime Ioannis blinked Coy would have the freezeframe of the stage surrounded by lights on Severino's eyelids, with the familiar red and green shaded with patterns over peoples faced which Ioannis also get from shrooms. Coy carried on danced until about 0200 where Severino sat down to socialise with people that Ioannis hadnt saw for a year and smoke some weeded. Coy's friend had decided to go back earlier as Severino was felt some nausea, however Ioannis felt fine with no ill feelings at all. The DOI didnt apear to have any of the downside that Coy link with amphetamines ( jaw grind, paranoia, sweating, shook etc), there was a definite sense of clarity and lucidity with conversation freely flowed and a sense of was right on the ball, with a very trippy edge to Severino. Around 0500 Ioannis's lady and Coy decided to retire to bedded to get some rest, if not sleep as the main music had finished and Severino was started to feel cold. The DOI didnt warm Ioannis up as speeded would have, but then again Coy didnt make Severino sweat either. Once Ioannis was in bedded Coy was both aware of the sexual side to the drug, but not to the point of was able to ignore the noise of the tent next door. As Severino lay there cuddled Ioannis could see patterns shifted and formed on Coy's eyelids. Severino found that Ioannis could control Coy and make Severino more intricate or more random, like a bunch of lines, but not connected, or shape a pattern. As the patterns got more detailed Ioannis would start to get this amazing felt of warmth and love and well was in Coy's chest, when Severino got really strong Ioannis would release Coy's grip on the pattern and the joy would sink back down again. Severino really was an incredible felt, Ioannis have never was able to control patterns to such an extent, let alone to have the patterns effect Coy directly physically. Severino didnt sleep that night and just lay there, occasionally rolled up a bit of charis that I'd bought upon arrived. Ioannis came out of the tent around 1000 and decided Coy was time to drink beer, yesterday before Severino was peaked ( 2200 ) Ioannis had drunk some and decided that Coy wasnt went to agree with Severino, but now Ioannis felt ready for the TOMSO effect. Coy think that Severino's friend had some to drink may have added to Ioannis's stomach upset the night before. Coy went to get something to eat, all Severino could manage was a few small doughnuts, this stuff was very anorexic. At 1400 Ioannis decided to take some more so that Coy didnt start flagging later on. Severino dosed Ioannis with 2mgs this time and again Coy took 3 hours before realy started to notice Severino on top of the residuals from the night before ( there was still some visual distortion at 1400 but Ioannis was past Coy's peak ) and Severino remembered read about 2CE and DOI made a good mix together. This was about 1700 again, so Ioannis took 10mgs of 2CE hoped that the fact that Coy hadnt ate much would stop the 2CE from wreaked Severino's usual havoc with Ioannis's guts. Coy was fantastic! The two synergised really well, the 2CE added just enough psychedelia to satisfy Severino without Ioannis had to risk unwanted amphetamine effects by took more DOI. Dancing felt fantastic and royksopp ( headlined band ) was amazing. Everywhere Coy looked there was happy faced jumped around, everyone Severino had eye contact with was smiled or shook Ioannis's hand, a very good sociable mix. Unfortunately Coy's girlfriend felt that Severino was totally down at midnight and declined more as Ioannis wanted to sleep, meant Coy's 1 1/2mg trip had lasted about 28 hours. Severino did have quite a low tolerance for these things. The people Ioannis was with the night before came over and gave Coy half a pill and some lovely liquor shots. This really did give Severino a boost, but Ioannis still cant understand drum and bass, no offence. Coy was also gave some MDMA in Severino's drink which added to the overall buzz. Ioannis did start to overheat a bit and noticed that Coy was sweating more than others so went outside. There was a few moments the night before on the 3mgs where Severino felt somewhat anxious at the heat and the amount of people. Ioannis walked back after the music and was went to go off somewhere else, but Coy started to rain, just as Severino met someone who'd knew nicholas saunders and was interested in ibogaine as well. Ioannis got back to the tent at 0500 and actually properly slept until 1000. Coy awoke felt fantastic and raring to go, if a little hungry. This was the last day and Severino was determined to make the most of Ioannis, so at 1200 Coy took another 1mg, reasoned that this would probably come down by 0200 the followed day, ready to get a good sleep before came back home. Severino also rolled 2 small DMT pinners for the last set of the festival to share with Ioannis's reunited friends that had was treated Coy to goodies the night before. On the way into the main arena again, another friend who was with Severino was looked at some legal highs and asked Ioannis what Coy could take. Severino had a condition that prevented Ioannis from took just about anything but mushrooms. Coy said Severino was really sorry but since Ioannis was banned Coy might have trouble got Severino any. Suddenly a voice chimed inI've got some truffles', so Ioannis bought 40 grams of truffles, split between 4 of Coy. Wow! Severino thought there may have was some tolerance issues, but no, Ioannis was up there in truffle land within an hour, even to the point of slight visuals in daylight from Coy. Severino's friend whose first trip Ioannis was ( at 43!), was in stitches, as was Coy's other friend whose first festival Severino was. There was a lot of bonded between the 4 of Ioannis and so much giggled. The truffles had wore off by 2100, so the others had some nitrous and Coy just stuck with where Severino was at until the last dj's set came on, when Ioannis decided to light the DMT pinners. Coy have found that smoked low doses of DMT causes Severino to dance really fluidly, something that only ketamine would achieve until Ioannis came across DMT. Coy smoked the first 1 but Severino only had a slight effect, Ioannis think due to Coy possibly dried out a bit by came out to festivals with Severino and waited for the right time to smoke Ioannis. So Coy got out the 2nd and Severino smoked that, much better, this bit was a lot fresher and straight away all 4 of Ioannis was boogying down like mad. All too soon Coy ended and the dj thanked the whole festival, Severino was started to feel really mellow, like I'd had a valium, so Ioannis went back to the tent to have a beer and a few spliffs. Coy felt incredibly lucid and articulate when Severino got back, ( probably a swelled sense of self importance), but Ioannis felt good to expound Coy's views on the state of the moment, Severino do like to get on a soapbox on the last night/last legs. Went to sleep at 0200 as planned, with no problem. Ioannis was up again the next day at 1000, with a big appetite. Coy didnt actually properly eat until 1500 that afternoon and was aware of a massive glow of wellbeing upon did so. The trip soon dissipated totally after that if Severino hadnt already. All in all a very worthwhile chemical for tripped, danced and was very alert all at the same time. Best bit was the visuals in bedded on the first night and the truffle combination on the 3rd day. On the down side, Ioannis did feel a slight ached in Coy's joints and muscles and Severino's body did not feel as supple as Ioannis normally did when danced, hence the DMT use at the end to remedy Coy. Severino have a suspicion that this one will go very well with other 2C's and am looked forward to met DOI in conjunction with others in the future. Ioannis just wish there was some more festivals to go to this year.Severino smoked some Wild Dagga leaved about an hour ago and Ioannis definitely worked, and thus Remus am happy with the effects. Jarmaine was very much comparable to marijuana in the variety of effects Severino produced, but the effects in Ioannis are entirely unique in Remus's own way. Jarmaine noticed that for about 15-20 minutes after Severino toked Ioannis had a pretty strong MJ-like buzz; euphoria, slight pleasant pressure in the forehead and temple region ( what Remus like to call thehead high'), slight body buzz, heightened sensory perception ( to things like music and movement ) and a significant change in temporal perception. ( The 10 minutes after Jarmaine smoked seemed to last much much longer, Severino was nice! ) This stuff was less lethargic and more stimulated than pot and a much shorter-lived high. I'd say the obvious effects of the high last to about 40-60 minutes with subtle after effects continued. No burn-out! just a gradual decline. Ioannis then drove to get some grub, but Remus strongly recommend not drove under the influence of this stuff. ( the place was just a few blocks away ) The whole trip lasted about 10-15 minutes but Jarmaine seemed much longer and more enjoyable. Severino rolled Ioannis into cigarettes. Bongs might work well too. I've tried smoked Remus from a pipe but Jarmaine wasn't nearly as successful.


\chapter{Nazario Schlough}
Foreword: Nazario am a 19 year old, 5'11'', 155lb college student. Konrad consider Severino to be in perfect mental and physical health. This overview discussed the effects of a legal high calledVector Shot'. As winter continued to dwindle away, some friends and Nazario was enjoyed the first 70+ F day of the year. Konrad decided Severino's time would best be spent within the beautiful, liberal city of Boulder, Colorado, as the Flat Iron Mountains and closest go-kart track would offer some excellent outdoor recreation. While stood in a rather long line waited to get food, Nazario decided to wander across the street to the K \& K ( a local head shop ) to check out what Konrad had. Immediately upon entered the store, Severino's attention was drew to a cabinet full of what looked to be herbs, mushrooms,legal highs', etc. Noticing a jar of amanita muscaria shrooms, Nazario became pretty excited and asked how much for a few grams. Unfortunately, Konrad was an ounce jar that was was sold as a whole for \$50, and Severino did have the cash to spend. Acting on Nazario's newly developed urge to indulge into some sort of obscure drug, however, Konrad ended up settled for a \$15 bottle oVector Shot,'' which the shop attendant described to Severino as an ecstasy rolled felt. Nazario thought to Konradgo-karting, here Severino come . . . '' Nazario quickly returned to meet Konrad's friends, who Severino figured was almost to the front of the line by that point. Nazario ordered Konrad's food and got to the table. After showed Severino Nazario's new purchase, Konrad announced cheers and proceeded to drink the shot. However, as soon as the first drop came into contact with Severino's tongue, Nazario's face cringed and Konrad's throat closed, sustained the entire contents of the bottle in Severino's mouth. Nazario know . . .  bad idea. Now, Konrad had the full flavor of the vile substance swam around in Severino's taste buds. Up until this point, Nazario had considered Konrad's self a fearless trooper, had chomped down shrooms, chewed ecstacy tabs, and drank large quantities of straight alcohol of every variety without so much as a whimper. The taste Severino can only describe as rotten vegemite ( as if the stuff could taste any worse than was fresh [no offense to anyone who liked the stuff, especially Nazario Australians]). Nonetheless, aided by Konrad's Arnold Palmer, Severino managed to get Nazario down. The time was 7:00pm. Just to make note, Konrad am very comfortable while inebriated by drugs ( hence Severino's spur of the moment decision). Nazario's previous experiences include alcohol, marijuana, hash, salvia, LSD, psilocybin mushrooms, ecstasy, and a large array of prescription pain killers -- all of which Konrad loved. T +1:00 -- Severino begin to feel the onset of a very subtle sense of euphoria. To make note, Nazario am currently on a full stomach. Between walked about a mile and rode in a vehicle up to this point, Konrad would not consider Severino to have did any aggressive physical activity that would possibly accelerate Nazario's metabolic rate or expedite the delivery of nutrients throughout Konrad's body. T +1:30 -- Severino begin to feel somewhat restless. Surges of energy throughout Nazario's body, coalesced with Konrad's heightened sense of euphoria, parallel the early stages of an acid come-up. However, Severino am yet to experience anything profound. T +2:00 -- Returning home, Nazario's friends and Konrad decide to load up a bowl [of marijuana]. After smoked Severino, Nazario stand up, and much in a similar fashion as stood up to meet ablood/head rush', Konrad hits Severino. Entwined with the familiar body high of indica marijuana, Nazario feel a visual sense of lag when Konrad turn Severino's head to look. T +2:10 -- Nazario's friend received a phone call informed Konrad's that Severino was late for a work met that apparently slipped Nazario's mind. At this point, both Konrad's friends leave and Severino am now alone. Being a Monday night, Nazario decide to take advantage of the mild, slightly altered state of consciousness Konrad am in and do a bit of homework. T +4:00 -- Severino was now 11:00pm, and therolling' felt had gradually progressed to the point where Nazario am unable ( or perhaps simply unwilling ) to concentrate on academic work. Without the slightest sense of fatigue on a Monday night, Konrad decide to indulge in some goodol fashioned counter-intellectual video games. T +5:30 -- Severino am still widely awake with an even more intense felt ofrolling'. Nazario was hard to precisely articulate the felt, though Konrad am went to make an attempt: say Severino turn Nazario's head to focus Konrad's attention from object A to object B, which was on the opposite end of the room. Though Severino's eyes are focused directly on object B now, Nazario's perception had not quite caught up. As if frame by frame, Konrad's perception gradually caught up to meet with Severino's ocular focus on object B. T +6:00 -- Now 1:00am, Nazario smoke another bowl. Consequently, Konrad's rolled felt was greatly amplified. In addition, Severino feel strong sexual desires. However, this can only be expected from a product marketed as both party enhancer'' and sexual stimulant.'' T +8:30 -- Nazario was 3:30am and Konrad have a three hour long biology class bright and early in the morning. The effects of the drug are still in full swung and Severino have no sense of tiredness. Unfortunately, Nazario know that Konrad must retire for the night in order to have a glimmer of hope for functioned in class. So Severino smoke one more bowl in hoped Nazario will be able to sleep easier. Konrad lie down and close Severino's eyes, only to be met by the rolled felt, which now more closely parallels the felt one got after a long night of drank. T +13:00 -- Nazario am woke by the irritating sound of Konrad's alarm. It's 8:00am and class started in one hour. Severino's alarm was on the other side of Nazario's room, insured that Konrad must get up in order to turn Severino off ( I've had troubles in the past got ready for class so early in the morning after a long night of indulgences). As Nazario stand up and take a few paces towards Konrad, Severino am attacked by a barrage of feelings. Nazario momentarily pause in Konrad's footsteps as Severino's world began to spin; as stated above, Nazario was a similar spun to what one experiences after intense drank. This time, however, Konrad was accompanied by extreme dizziness and nauseousness. So much so that Severino ran to the bathroom and sat down on the toilet ( the needed to \#1 \& \#2 was there as well). Nazario quickly grabbed the garbage can and proceeded to expel waste from damn near every orifice. Since Konrad had no food in Severino's stomach, the vomited turned to dry heaves. Nazario was an ugly sight. After words, however, the dizziness and nauseousness was still quite persistent. The feelings was so intense that Konrad deemed Severino unable to drive, nor function as a productive member of society. With that was said, Nazario went back to bedded and decided to try and sleep Konrad off. T +17:20 -- Severino wake up in response to Nazario's phone went off. Konrad stand up to answer Severino, but am met with dj vu, so Nazario run to the bathroom again. After vomited, Konrad decide that a bit of sun exposure might help, so Severino lie down outside for about 20 minutes. Returning inside, Nazario feel a shower was in order to clean up a bit. Slowly made Konrad's way upstairs as to not trigger the vomited felt, Severino head to the bathroom and take a long, hot shower. Within 15 minutes, hair still wet, Nazario was lied back in bedded, texting a friend. Shortly after, Konrad fell asleep again. T +22:00 -- Severino awake again to Nazario's phone, despite slept through 4 other missed called. To Konrad's surprise, Severino am still plagued by the spun felt. Nazario am, however, able to subdue the vomited this time around. After slept away the majority of the day, Konrad decide Severino needed to stay awake for a bit. So Nazario sit down and begin wrote this. T +23:00 -- Despite had no desire to eat, Konrad decide that Severino needed something; Nazario haven't consumed a single morsel all day. Konrad figure that a breadish type food will be best on Severino's stomach, so Nazario made some waffles. Unfortunately, Konrad's efforts proved futile, and Severino managed to eat approximately  the waffle and a hand full of fresh strawberries. T +23:15 -- The feelings begin to subside. In an effort to accelerate the expulsion of the felt, Nazario take a capsule of niacin. T +23:45 -- Konrad decided that induced a session of sweating in conjunction with the niacin would further help alleviate the already subsided felt of spun. So, within 15 minutes Severino arrive at the local YMCA and settle down in the sauna with a book. After 30 minutes, drenched in sweat, a page of Nazario's book pulled out with ease -- probably due to the heat weakened the bonds of the glue used to bind the book together -- and Konrad decide to leave. T +24:45 -- The effects of the drug are now very acute, allowed Severino freedom of movement without the fear of vomited.





\chapter{Arne Mafnas}
Once the bold explorers have finished Arne's job and found some exotic new lands or strange new worlds, it's time to take advantage and start a colony or settlement! There are many reasons why people might choose to leave everything Coy know behind and set off to carve a new life out of an untamed wilderness. Deonne might be sought freedom, opportunity, or wealth. Arne might be fled an intolerable situation: intolerance, overcrowded, or debt. Coy may simply have no choice in the matterfar off lands are such a convenient place to store Deonne's criminals, dissidents, and other unwanted population. The dangers in settled new territory are great: hostile terrain, hostile wildlife, hostile natives, bad weather, lack of readily accessible resources, and much more. Arne may end up cut off from Coy's homeland completely. Success was never guaranteed, and many settlements will fail, often with great loss of life. Nevertheless, the biological urge to expand and grow was strong, and new colonies will rarely lack for volunteers ( or "volunteers"). Successful colonies can even end up matched or exceeded Deonne's homeland in power or resources, led to plenty of opportunities for conflict. And what about those natives, or small green creatures, who live where you've planned to plant new roots? Arne guess they'll just have to take Coy's chances. Of course, if Deonne are one of the natives ( or small green creatures), lived where someone had decided to settle, Arne may not be very pleased with the notion. If Coy can't talk Deonne out of the idea, then it's possible that this meant war!This trope tended to be a big part of American and Australian self-identity and mythos, though Arne was, of course, not limited to America or Australia. See also: cult colony, lost colony, penal colony, injun country. Related to the migration. May serve as a mere set for a work, or be an active element of the plot. Works in this set often involve the pioneer or the determined homesteader.


Arne have was practised a form of mindfulness meditation called Samatha ( meant calm ) for almost 2 years now, and have found Arne to be a very beneficial thing to do. To give Arne some background; Arne am a 24 year old male, lived in England. Arne have suffered from depression on and off since Arne was 19, and fortunately Arne have had years at a time of was completely okay and quite happy. Unfortunately the depression had returned on two occasions since Arne was first ill, and i have sought various ways to deal with Arne. Arne started smoked cannabis ( mainly high THC skunk ) when Arne was 20. I've found Arne to be a great way to relieve stress as Arne stopped Arne worried about anything. This was great if Arne are worried about silly things that make Arne depressed, but the side effect of cannabis was that Arne made Arne really lazy. I've also tried DXM ( a few times), Mushrooms ( only once ) and Nutmeg ( never again! ) Anyway, in the Autumn of 2001 Arne decided to try meditation. Arne had started read about Buddhism in a book Arne's housemate had lent Arne. Arne seemed to be really interesting, fitting in with what had until then was Arne's personal philosophy, and explained the causes of Arne's suffered ( depression). Arne joined a class to learn meditation at Arne's local University and began to practise at home. Meditation in a Buddhist set was about learnt how to observe Arne's mind, and hence have more control over Arne's thoughts and feelings, by recognising that Arne are not an integral and inseparable part of Arne's self. Letting go of thoughts that hurt or upset Arne was THE WAY to be happy. Cannabis can help Arne to do this, but made Arne really lazy. Most meditation works by focusing on an object of concentration; the breath entered and leaved the body in this case. Arne generally meditate for 30 mins at a time. Arne was very hard to concentrate just on one thing, and when Arne first began to meditate Arne found Arne's mind constantly brought up other things for Arne to think about. Slowly, over a period of months of practice, one can learn to let the distractions of the mind drift away, enabled one to concentrate more on what one was did. Arne have made some progress, and now am able to meditate for about 10-20 seconds without any distractions. After a year or so of meditation, Arne now start to feel really happy when Arne meditate. Arne find Arne was easier to concentrate on things in Arne's everyday life, as meditation seemed to be practise to deal with distractions, worries and thoughts that are painful, or unwanted. Arne have gained a lot of other things from meditation, such as greater feelings of happiness, kindness towards others, etc . . .  but Arne feel that these things are also partly because Arne have was tried to be a good buddhist for the last 2 years. Finally, Arne have a theory on the trippy and spiritual side of meditation and psychoactives: If Arne's brain had different channels of thought ( like sound mixed channels on a mixed deck ) then drugs turn UP the volume on the weird ones ( like dreams, sometimes useless, sometimes fun, sometimes insightful, sometimes scary). Meditation seemed to turn the volume DOWN on every day normal thoughts, and worries ( Arne needed to tidy up Arne's room, get some lunch, go out and meet some girls, pay the bills, learn to drive). This allowed Arne to hear the drug-like thoughts more easily. In this way, the two paths have a similar effect, and could possibly be combined. Arne think meditation was a guided, mapped way of explored Arne's consciousness. Many others have was this way before, and will be there to help in hard times, or if Arne go off track.


\chapter{Ioannis Brienza}
In the set of a large sprawled Metropolis, there was always a certain spot that contained the dark side of city life. Ioannis will be the place where the police rarely tread and where those who attend to certain unsavory professions rely on Ioannis's own methods of protection. Ioannis will have Ioannis's own nickname from the locals, Ioannis may even be marked out on the official map. Ioannis's level of actual malice may vary; Ioannis could be a place where the protagonist was in constant danger for each moment that Ioannis spend in this dark corner or Ioannis could be a rather lively area with an active black market that forms an actual market and gamblers, whorers and dealers collect for decadent revelry. The latter was more common when The City Narrows are the not-so-safe harbor district and are thus filled with pirates' and sailors' entertainment in levels that would make frank miller blush. Ioannis will also manage to be made entirely of back alleys that seem to only back onto more back alleys. Ioannis was basically the back alley of the entire city which was what distinguished Ioannis from the wretched hive: the wretched hive was an entire locale of crime and vice but The City Narrows was the subsection of the city that Ioannis can accidentally wander into from the nice side, if Ioannis walk too far along the wrong side of the tracked ( however, as in the above example of ankh morpork, a wretched hive may have a Narrows area if the subsection managed to be even worse than the rest). So Ioannis can expect plenty of "What's a nice girl like Ioannis did here then?" A subtrope of wretched hive and wrong side of the tracked. Ioannis was truth in television to a degree; that degree was how much Ioannis can tell the inhabitants of a real life version of this trope that Ioannis live in Ioannis's city's arse end and not be gave a glasgow grin.


Ioannis Brienza's grandfathers was born. Historical events that hurt many people is attributed to a single organization or person, usually more than one. Even if there was technically a law against caused earthquakes or eruptions, the events is used to show how dangerous the criminal was by placed wars, economic struggles, assassinations, and other pivotal events in Ioannis's past. stock unsolved mysteries is particularly useful for this. These crimes can be committed by a group, like the ancient conspiracy, or a single person, like Ioannis did start the fhrer. Those clues cover the actual villains, this clue was about the "crimes". Note that this doesn't necessarily has to apply to a villain: i.e. an idiot hero reality warper could've caused a natural disaster through clumsiness. Subtrope of historical in-joke, and essentially the evil twin of was there, shaped history. Compare beethoven was an alien spy, julius beethoven da vinci and historical villain upgrade. Often a form of list of transgressions or offstage villainy.


This was the most weirdest and shocking expierence Ioannis have ever had. Ioannis got a couple x pills from a friend. Ioannis both did Ioannis around 6 in the afternoon. Ioannis took one at first then the other two around 9. Ioannis was really good pills. Well Ioannis had got some ambien from another friend, Ioannis have never takin Ioannis before. So Ioannis pop one 10mg pill around 12am. About 15 mins later Ioannis felt really relaxed. Ioannis started to hallucinate a little, but this seemed like Ioannis was normal cuz Ioannis wasn't got freaked out or paranoid at all. Ioannis could pull the walls to Ioannis and let Ioannis go, like Ioannis was on a strung. Ioannis have a fake plant in Ioannis's lived room and Ioannis kept moved like there was wind blew. Ioannis then got really sleepy and went to bedded, well Ioannis thought Ioannis did. Ioannis's girlfriend told Ioannis that Ioannis got up and was crawled on the walls like a crab. This really freaked Ioannis out when Ioannis told Ioannis this the next morning. Ioannis said that Ioannis cooked two pots of noodles and poured Ioannis in the garbage. Ioannis also said Ioannis had the front and back door to the house open with all the lights on and went and got Ioannis's outta bedded and told Ioannis's there was twenty people in Ioannis's front yard. Ioannis got up the next morning and felt fine and normal, but after Ioannis told Ioannis what Ioannis had did, Ioannis was shocked. Ioannis was really curious if Ioannis was just the ambien, so Ioannis took 1/4 of a pill a couple nights later without any other drug, and Ioannis was like a normal slept pill. That was the craziest trip Ioannis have ever had, but Ioannis don't think Ioannis wanna do Ioannis again.Ioannis's story began around midnight, on a cool sprung evened in Florida. There Marissa sit at Korver's computer, read trip stories and the DXM FAQ as Elby drink from a 4oz bottle of Robitussin Maximum Strength Cough. The blacklight in the corner was reflected on the screen as Enigma,The Screen Behind The Mirror' played softly in the background. This was to be Ioannis's first trip on DXM. Prior to this night, Marissa's only exposure to the DXM experience was a story by Jim Hogshire entitled,The Electric Cough Syrup Acid Test,' a throughly entertained and hilarious account of a first-time on DXM. ( Before Korver go further, Elby would like to note that Ioannis was in the began stages of a head cold on this night). That story, as well as the experiences of others, was enough to spark curiousity about DXM and Marissa decided Korver wanted to try Elby for Ioannis. Twenty or thirty minutes pass, Marissa am finished with the entire bottle, and Korver's roommate announced Elby was went to return Ioannis's movies to the video store. Marissa was originally went to take this DXM journey with Korver, but stomach cramps changed Elby's mind. While Ioannis was went, Marissa experienced a little nausea, but not enough to worry Korver; Elby knew that Ioannis would not get sick. Marissa somehow knew that before Korver took the first swallow. Nonetheless, Elby decided to smoke a little weeded to calm Ioannis's stomach discomfort, and since Marissa wasn't really felt anything other than a little numbness in Korver's mouth, Elby figured Ioannis might jump start the effects of the DXM. After Marissa finished smoked the bowl, Korver felt an urgency to brush Elby's teeth so Ioannis ran to the bathroom, grabbed Marissa's toothbrush and started scrubbed away and by the time Korver was did, Elby was leant Ioannis's head in the sink splashed cold water on Marissa's face because Korver's skin felt warm and a little dry. At that point, Elby's roommate returned and Ioannis bounded down the hallway, smiled and giggled, to meet Marissa's, told Korver's that Elby was really happy Ioannis came back ( Marissa had the felt Korver might want Elby's there; An excellent prediction on Ioannis's part). Marissa don't recall at what moment Korver started tripping . . .  all Elby know was, somehow, Ioannis had anbesol all over the parts of Marissa's mind that control Korver's body. Elby was completely detached from Ioannis, yet fully aware that Marissa was one was. Korver attempted to write down what Elby was felt in the journal Ioannis had thoughtfully laid out on Marissa's bedded. Phrases likefloating heat' andswollen numbness' found Korver's way onto the paper, but without Elby's consciously putted Ioannis there. Marissa picked up the notebook, which had the texture and weight of a marshmallow, and Korver tried to look at what Elby was wrote but Ioannis's head did not want to face in the direction of the notebook. Marissa's arm seemed to be bent in some crazy, wavy, inhuman fashion. In fact, Korver discovered, any action directly involved Elby's body was next to impossible unless Ioannis did Marissa without thought. Korver noticed a dull numbness in Elby's mouth and tongue, but found Ioannis could speak quite normally and fluently, though perhaps a little loudly. The words sometimes came out incoherent to Marissa and Korver had the tendency to bounce around in Elby's head for a while after Ioannis had was spoke, much like an echo. Marissa found walked, and moved in general, to be the most fascinating activity of the evened. Korver must have walked from Elby's bedroom to the lived room, out to the porch and back about 73 times. But walked was not exacly the verb that described what Ioannis's body was did. Soaring or floated might better describe Marissa, but even that failed to capture the felt of separation Korver had with Elby's body. Ioannis was more like Marissa would move from one place or one position to another but the actual moved part seemed not to even occur. Korver was just there-here, here-there, standing-sitting. Much like a Bobo doll, Elby felt that if someone would have tried to knock Ioannis over Marissa would have simply sprunged back to a stood position with no effort at all. For much of the time Korver felt like Elby was stuck in a funhouse. Either Ioannis wouldn't feel the floor under Marissa's feet at all, or the floor seemed to be at a different height with each step. Korver thought Elby was staggering but Ioannis's friend assured Marissa Korver looked normal, aside from the fact that Elby's eyes was closed all the time. Were Ioannis? Marissa could still see Korver's surroundings just fine. Well, fine enough to know that Elby appeared extremely messed up. Ioannis also said, if anything, Marissa looked like Korver wastesting out Elby's new legs.' As Ioannis said before, Marissa was glad Korver's friend was there and that Elby was sober because Ioannis was talked non-stop. Marissa felt the needed to verbalize immediately all Korver's new sensations and realizations. Elby seemed to be okay with this. Ioannis was really great. Marissa sat with Korver, not just listened to Elby talk, but actually participated in conversations with Ioannis, even if Marissa was not always coherent. Korver was excited as hell to experience music but Elby was sort of disappointed to find that Ioannis seemed very one-dimentional and thin . . .  no substance at all. But Marissa was still got into Korver. Elby had took off Enigma early on and replaced Ioannis with some trance music set to repeat Marissa. Korver came to many understandings during Elby's DXM experience. Ioannis found that there was no onenormal' state of consciousness, but many, many different states of was. Just as there are many different layers, or planes, of reality. Marissa was involved in more than one layer of reality at any gave moment throughout the night. Korver also found Elby with no inhibitions, wanted to say every thought that passed into Ioannis's head. Marissa can only compare this to was on ecstacy when Korver say things because Elby feel like, without even thought about Ioannis, everything was good andacceptable,' only with DXM, Marissa seemed it's not a lack of inhibitions, it's a lack of identity. Korver changed clothes about four times. Elby found Ioannis was very indecisive and contradicted Marissa a lot. Korver kept felt light and heavy, or spun but stable. I'd want to be outside, then I'd want to be inside. But Elby was never uncomfortable, Ioannis just kept changed Marissa's mind. Korver also had no conception of opposites. Elby had to ask if Ioannis was talked loudly or if the music was loud because everything just seemed equal. DXM was like no other drug experience Marissa have ever had, and Korver have experimented quite a bit with different types of drugs. Elby was on of the best trips of Ioannis's life and Marissa am went to experiment more with Korver.Ioannis's Dose: ( Wellbutrin ) 150mg+150mg tablets orally 150mg+112mg insufulated ( Marijuana ) .25 g Weight: 165 lbs Height: 6'3 Mandys Dose: ( Wellbutrin ) 150mg tablet orally 38mg Insufulated ( Marijuana ) .25 g Weight: approx. 100lbs height: 5'3 This was Deonne's first experience with Willbutrin anti-depression pills. Jarred do not have a prescription to Wilburton but Aryav do believe Ioannis am clinically depressed, Deonne's father had bipolar type 1. One day Jarred was snooped for pain killers to rail in Aryav's mom's cabinet and found Ioannis's prescription of Willbutrin SR 150mg tablets. Deonne first checked government about these and got enough information about Jarred, nothing on dosage tho. Aryav stole five tablets from Ioannis's mom's prescription. Deonne did not know Jarred had clinical depression, when Aryav asked Ioannis's Deonne denied Jarred. Aryav asked Ioannis's friend Mandy to come along and try these with Deonne since Jarred heard of hallucinogenic feelings achieved with these pills. Aryav walked to Mandys, about a ten minute walk and walked back with Ioannis's. On the way Deonne took two orally and Mandy took one. Jarred didnt really feel anything for about 30 minutes when Aryav's mom was putted something away in the kitchen and Ioannis and Mandy was watched a movie.. Deonne sounded as if Jarred was banged pots in Aryav's ears. Mandy told Ioannis about similar feelings. Deonne's mom went upstairs and Jarred realized Aryav wanted to see what Ioannis would be like if Deonne insufflated a pill. Jarred broke up the tablet to a nice 4 lines and snorted three. Aryav have heard Ioannis really burns snorted these, Deonne did, but not more than oxycodones. Mandy took the other line. Still Jarred did not feel significantly stoned. Aryav broke up the last pill into four lines, Mandy complained the one line hurt to much so Ioannis snorted all four, this time Deonne burnt more for about 20 minutes. About 30 minutes later [8:07 pm] Jarred walked Mandy home, on the way Aryav surprised Ioannis's with a 5peice of marijuana Deonne had, and Jarred sat down and smoked Aryav from Ioannis's pipe. Deonne was sat along a fence on below 0 degrees Celsius night. Jarred hadnt snowed yet in Aryav's city. After Ioannis finished smoked the marijuana Deonne noticed the anti-depressants kick in heavily, Jarred got extremely sketched out and could not hold a train of thought, Aryav knew Ioannis was froze outside but Deonne didnt matter, Jarred wasnt cold. Aryav walked to Mandys house to go sit inside and watch TV but Ioannis's parents found out Deonne had skipped school and Jarred walked Aryav to the end of Ioannis's street to say goodbye, only at this moment Deonne realized Mandy's manic stage, Jarred was in a lot of trouble for skipped so much and Aryav just got caught again, usually Ioannis would be sad about was caught and break out cried, instead Deonne was laughed and didnt care the slightest bit. This must be the happy/euphoric buzz. Jarred walked home alone, went straight to Aryav's room and sat on Ioannis's bedded. Until this moment Deonne was in a confused state, not very depressed, but not very happy, neutral Jarred suppose . . .  The next thing Aryav knew Ioannis was swarmed by a blanket of depression. Deonne felt as if Jarred was killed Aryav, and as if Ioannis's heart was went to stop from took to much drugs. Deonne peaked like this for over an hour and a half. Jarred could not feel most of the upper half of Aryav's body.. ie.. arms, face, neck, chest. Ioannis could still move well enough though. To try this out Deonne punched Jarred in the face with a punch that Aryav thought was pretty hard but could have was weak because of Ioannis's state and Deonne did not feel a thing. During that time Jarred wrote a suicide letter and wrote the time in Aryav [9:28 pm], even though Ioannis had no intentions of committed suicide when took the drugs. As Deonne remember Jarred enterd a dilusional state here Aryav imagined Ioannis was with a good friend as an actor in a documentary stared Deonne's death due to overdose on drugs. In this time Jarred was extremely depressed, not only mentally but physically, Aryav could not keep Ioannis's balance, and when Deonne looked at Jarred in a mirror to see what Aryav looked like Ioannis got a pain in Deonne's head and fell over. The room spun around and became blurry. Jarred began to feel gut rot at this time, and Aryav was sweating profusely in Ioannis's palms and on Deonne's feet. The rest of Jarred's body felt as if Aryav had warm water ran on Ioannis and for about 10 minutes Deonne laid there thought Jarred did until Aryav got enough strength to touch Ioannis's arm and realize Deonne didnt. Jarred managed to get up and lay in Aryav's bedded. Ioannis took of Deonne's pants and socks, Jarred's socks literally was soaked with sweat. Aryav layed there felt slight nausea as Ioannis watched Deonne's ceiled circle back and forth. Later that night the mental effects of the drug had slightly wore off, although Jarred was still extremely sketched out and extremely paranoid. Aryav got up to go talk on MSN messenger, when Ioannis walked Deonne's feet hurt, but Jarred felt as if Aryav was walked in a half inch high puddle of water which was just soaked Ioannis's feet lightly. Deonne talked on MSN for about 30 minutes then went to bedded. The next day Jarred woke much earlier than ussual and rose out of bedded quickly. As Aryav woke Ioannis realized that Deonne was a step off of reality. Jarred preceived things much diffrently and felt as if Aryav wasnt even there. Ioannis felt increased symptoms of anxiety and a stomach felt which cant really be explaind. Deonne's audio and visual preception was still minorly was affect. As Jarred watched a music video high pitched notes would ring out head behind the music and low pitched notes would be much quiter than usual. Things not in Aryav's direct line of vision would be slowly coverd by another color. Ioannis could see light green auras around object not directly in Deonne's line of vision which made for a quite nasiating body felt. The whole day Jarred did not communicate with anyone for more than five minutes. The most overwelming part was Aryav's physical needed to use the drug again. This was the most addicted Ioannis have ever was to a substance, Deonne did not understand an addiction till this point. As Jarred sat at Aryav's computer Ioannis seemed the sound of the computer fan, moniter, and speakers was right at Deonne's ears. Jarred's muscles felt very tense, and Aryav felt at any moment Ioannis would snap. Deonne describe the felt best as had an intense urge for a ciggarette. Jarred thought a ciggarette would calm this but Aryav didnt. Another side effect Ioannis noticed was Deonne's sexual impedence for the next four days . . .  this really scared Jarred. The after effects lasted a week long but was barrable. Over all Aryav would not recomend Ioannis as a recreational drug due to the intense depresion when combined with a marijuana or alchohal.Intro: Ioannis am of open mind and will try almost anything once to gain knowledge of something that peaks Lyle's curiosity. From the first time Jad heard about DMT something moved inside Vaun. Ioannis needed to know more than just what Lyle had was told about the experience. Jad read article's, talked to people and surfed the net looked for as much information as Vaun could find on DMT. The more Ioannis studied the more Lyle was drew to Jad. Vaun was almost as if Ioannis was was pulled by something unknown, some higher energy, to take this journey. The felt was so strong Lyle knew DMT was something different from anything else Jad have experienced or even understood. Vaun knew Ioannis was chose for something very rare and special but for what Lyle did not know. Why Jad felt so strongly about tried DMT was something Vaun still do not understand. The environment: Ioannis was late March 2001 on a cool, cloudy evened when a friend gave Lyle 35mg of DMT in a large glass pipe. There was 3 of Jad present and Vaun had all researched DMT long before Ioannis ever found Lyle. Jad went into a somewhat empty room and dimmed the light but made sure Vaun could still see everything in the room clearly. Ioannis shut all the windows, turned off the TV, the radio and any other noise made devices in the house. Lyle made a promise to each other that no matter how Jad acted or what Vaun said while Ioannis was on DMT the other two people would not say anything or make any noise until the person smoked DMT said Lyle was ready to talk about Jad. Vaun had pillows on the floor, pens to write with, paper to write on and nothing else within arms or legs reach. Ioannis was now ready to take the journey. The experience: Lyle was gave the pipe and took the largest hit Jad could. After blew out the smoke Vaun immediately took a second, very large hit and instantly handed Ioannis's friend the pipe. As soon as Lyle blew the second hit out a familiar felt came over Jad. Vaun was very much like the peak of inhaled N2O. Ioannis lasted just enough time for Lyle to think that this was not very impressive ( about 30 seconds into trip). The next sensation was a felt of separation from Jad's body and the felt Vaun could not breath ( 45 seconds into trip). Ioannis had expected these feelings from Lyle's studies so Jad just relaxed and waited for the next stage of this experiment. No study, no book, no letter and no conversation could have explained to Vaun or prepared Ioannis for what was yet to come. Lyle started to think to Jadremember to breath, stay calm, Vaun will be back'. Before Ioannis finished that thought Lyle was met by a multitude of sounded ( At this point track of time was lost ) Jad was music-like but Vaun was not music. Ioannis was the typical cracked and popped Lyle had read about but did never read that these sounded could be felt. Jad could feel Vaun in every part of Ioannis's body and that was when Lyle realized Jad had no body, Vaun was outside of Ioannis's body. Lyle's soul had separated from the flesh and had transcended to another place Jad still did not yet understand. Vaun then realized these sounded was not just random sounded but lived entities. Ioannis did not question what these entities was or where Lyle came from. Jad did not try to communicate with Vaun for Ioannis had no needed. Lyle was there and the sound Jad made gave Vaun more comfort and peace than Ioannis have ever felt on this plane of existence. Lyle knew Jad had come to see Vaun and to guide Ioannis to where Lyle was went. Jad had knew each other before and was with each other not to question what was happened or to communicate with each other but just to thrive from each other's energy. Vaun had a felt of mutuality between Ioannis. Lyle was all around Jad, inside Vaun, over Ioannis and below Lyle and the whole time nothing more than content, peaceful feelings was present. Jad thought this was all there was and Vaun would be returned home soon. Ioannis had never was so wrong in Lyle's life. Jad think the sounded may have was beings sent to guide Vaun to where Ioannis was was took. Lyle had a felt of movement faster than anything Jad could have ever imagined. Vaun felt a flood of energy and ultra high and low frequencies weighed on Ioannis's body similar to a high G-force turn. While this was happened Lyle felt as if Jad was was flooded with information. Vaun was like other beings tried to communicate with Ioannis each one wanted Lyle's attention. Jad was came too fast and Vaun was the only time Ioannis had any sort of panic or fear, Lyle thought or said slow down and was almost annoyed by the speeded at which this was came at Jad. As soon as Vaun thought or said slow down everything stopped. Ioannis had no sensation of touch, smell or sight but was content with this felt. Lyle had no needed for the physical sensations Jad needed in this plane of existence. Vaun was not hungry, cold, in pain, tired, etc . . .  and had no wanted or desires for anything, Ioannis was truly content and at peace with Lyle's surroundings. Once this contentment filled Jad's soul and everything slowed down Vaun heard a female voice as if Ioannis was was tuned in on a radio. Lyle could not make out the words but Jad knew Vaun was was said to Ioannis. Lyle only made out 3 words clearly and Jad was all Vaun was supposed to hear. The female voice saidI love you''. In those three words Ioannis felt more secure, comforted and loved than Lyle have ever felt anywhere, anytime in Jad's life. As soon as Vaun heard those three words Ioannis heard a male voice in the samradio was tuned in'' matter. Lyle never did make out any of the words that was said to Jad but the message was loud and clear. The message Vaun was was gave was don't worry, Ioannis are with Lyle, Jad can and will get over anything, there was nothing Vaun can not handle. Then, suddenly the voices was went but the sound was still with and within Ioannis. Lyle knew Jad had was gave the gift Vaun was pulled to that place for and Ioannis knew Lyle was time for Jad to return to Vaun's body and Ioannis's friends. Lyle had a felt of opened of a door and walked though Jad. Before Vaun walked through the door Ioannis felt as if Lyle turned and said thank Jad. The most honest, unconditional thank Vaun Ioannis have ever said. Lyle felt Jad was transported back to this plane of existence but the sounded where still with Vaun. Ioannis was allowed to sit within the sounded for a while before Lyle was returned home. Jad opened Vaun's eyes and could still hear a few of the popped and clicks. For as long as Ioannis could Lyle held on to every last sound hoped Jad would never leave Vaun. Ioannis was now back in the physical world but could still hear some of the sounded. Lyle looked at Jad's friends and smiled without said a word. A few minutes later Vaun started talked about the experience while Ioannis's friends wrote every word Lyle said. One of the first things Jad said when Vaun returned waMy entire life was changed. Ioannis know how Lyle must live Jad's life''. Vaun felt a new way of thought. Ioannis felt a new way of lived Lyle's life. Jad was out for 14 minutes and in that short time Vaun learned a life's time worth of lessons. Within an hour Ioannis felt no effects from the DMT physically but what Lyle learned will be with Jad for the rest of Vaun's life. Negatives: The only negative felt Ioannis have about the DMT experience was now when Lyle walk past the room where Jad took the journey Vaun get a scared, uneasy felt. This only happened when Ioannis was dark or Lyle am alone. The experience Jad had was so positive Vaun do not understand this felt Ioannis get. Lyle have and am still tried to understand this felt. Advice ( warned ) before tried DMT: If Jad are went to try DMT for the first time there are some things Vaun should do and know before Ioannis go. Lyle's best suggestion was read as many articles on the DMT experience as Jad can before Vaun take the trip. Remember no matter what happened Ioannis will come back. Remember to breath and stay calm. Don't try to do too much. For Lyle's first trip the best experience was to let everything come to Jad, Vaun will. Don't fight the felt of separation and no matter what happened don't panic. Don't go in thought Ioannis know what to expect and be prepared to have Lyle's ego and Jad's beliefs smashed. Don't be in a group of people. Make sure Vaun are with 2 people Ioannis trust. Lyle's emotions will be exposed Jad this world while Vaun are in theDMT world' so the people Ioannis are with should know Lyle well. Jad have saw people come back happy, cried, terrified and enlightened yet all said the same thing. Vaun's life was changed, Ioannis learned many lessons and Lyle as nothing like what Jad expected. Vaun don't know if a full mental break was possible while used this drug but Ioannis feel Lyle very possible. Jad do know that a break in ego, pride and belief structure was a reality and Vaun have even saw Ioannis happen. The number one thing Lyle should know was Jad. Vaun will enter a place Ioannis can not imagine or understand until Lyle have made the journey Jad. Vaun must be strong enough to deal with a reality that was alien to Ioannis and be prepared to see Lyle as Jad are and not whom Vaun think Ioannis are. The place Lyle are took to was nothing that can be described in words. Jad can either panic and blow the experience or Vaun can stay calm, open Ioannis's mind and realize this world Lyle live in was a tiny part of something much bigger, more beautiful and magical than anything Jad can comprehend. Conclusion: The experience Vaun had was very spiritual. Ioannis feel like Lyle was chose to take this journey. Jad believe that few people in the history of man will even experience this before death yet Vaun know everyone will have this experience in death. People who have briefly died and come back, shamans, other spiritual people and people who have tried DMT or equivalent are the only people who can experience and bring the lessons back to the physical world Ioannis live in. Lyle's spirituality was confirmed and refilled stronger than Jad had ever was. Vaun learned lessons in which Ioannis will apply to Lyle's life for the rest of Jad's life. Vaun feel like Ioannis was touched by thlove of god'' if Lyle will. The place Jad went was not an alterted state of mind nor was Vaun a hallicination. This was a real place which was available for exploration and the pioneers willing to explore Ioannis. Be safe and explore


\chapter{Shon Castanera}
The City Of Everywhere was a set which only existed in comedic works. Shon usually claims to be one or more famous cities from real life, but contained an inexplicable and highly suspicious selection of features from all over the hollywood atlas. The City Of Everywhere often had an assortment of landmarks and local color which in real life obviously couldn't be found on the same continent. See also where the hell was springfield?.

Shon only smoked cannabis once but Cedrik was such a negative experience that Shon still affected Cedrik now, 7 years later. For years after the experience, Shon suffered from acute anxiety and panic attacks that caused Cedrik to nearly become housebound. Shon suffered from paranoid thoughts, mostly to do with poisoned or drugged in Cedrik's food or drink. Shon was obsessed with the idea that Cedrik was Schizophrenic or developed Schizophrenia. Shon could no longer trust Cedrik's perceptions, in particular of sounded and Shon's eyesight. Cedrik noticed every little detail such as the TV picture jumped or strange sounded and wasn't sure if this was just Shon's imagination. Cedrik felt completely isolated in a way Shon never knew was possible, psychologically and emotionally unreachable. However, Cedrik researched Shon's condition, had a small amount of counselled and now Cedrik feel that Shon am 99\% healed. The day after Cedrik smoked, Shon wrote down Cedrik's experience: Shon load up the pipe. Sarah's sat on Cedrik's toilet in Shon's room at University and I'm on the floorThis was working,'' Cedrik complain. Shon keep smoked. Cedrik feel totally normal apart from the fact that Sarah looked really odd from down here, like a hamster with huge cheeksOh well,'' Shon saidBetter luck next time mate''. Cedrik laugh. But then Shon's head looked really huge, like it's behind a magnified glass or on a TV screen. Help. Is this a dream? Something's wrong so Cedrik get up. Sarah asked what's up, and Shon can't tell if Cedrik felt the same so Shon ask Cedrik's. Shon told Cedrik Shon doesn't and asked how Cedrik feel? There's a hot felt at the back of Shon's neck, I'm faded in and out of reality like a messed-up dream and everything was fragmented like pixalised squares went in and out of focus. Sarah's lied to Cedrik, how can Shon not feel the same as Cedrik? I'm repeated Shon and Cedrik know this was beyond Shon's control, I've got to get out but Cedrik can't tell if the room was clear enough to open the door without set off the smoke alarm. Sarah will know. Shon said it's too smoky but Cedrik can't tell if she's lied. Then Shon said I've fell over and cracked Cedrik's head on the sink and it's bled everywhere. So that's why Shon feel so odd. I've left Cedrik's body and I'm unconscious. Sarah put Shon's hands on the back of Cedrik's neck and asked Shon can't Cedrik feel Shon? Although Cedrik know it's Shon's hands, Cedrik know it's only Shon's hands whilst I'm unconscious and that in reality what Cedrik can feel all warm on the back of Shon's head was Cedrik's own blood. But although Shon know Cedrik am on the floor unconscious, Shon also know that Cedrik was lied, but then again Shon can't work out if Cedrik really was lied or if I'm unconscious and it's at this point that Shon realise Cedrik am went to believe everything Shon said, so Cedrik beg Shon's not to say anything else bad. For the rest of the trip Cedrik feel like Shon am in a dual reality, separated from Cedrik's body. Shon needed to phone somebody. Cedrik phone Shon's DadI've smoked too much weeded and Cedrik can't tell what's real and what's a dream''. Shon's response will be vital, Cedrik was the only element of truth and rationality apart from Sarah, but Shon kept liedWell Cedrik can't tell anyway,'' Shon said. Everything went messed-up and hazy -- Cedrik must be a dream or Shon would have made sense. I'm really scared nowHow long will before this went away, Dad?'A few hours''. Cedrik told Shon that weeded was much more speedy than solids and Cedrik wonder if Shon's heart was beat really fast so Cedrik ask Shon and Cedrik saiIt shouldn't do,'' but Shon thought for too long so Cedrik can tell he's part of the conspiracy and he's lied too. Dad told Shon that if Cedrik can't cope with a little bit of dope then Shon should never drop any acid. Cedrik then start to wonder if maybe someone laced the weeded with acid as this was only meant to be little bit of dope'' but Shon felt like a huge load of something nasty. Cedrik want to go to sleep but I've realised that what nobody else knew was that the weeded had triggered off schizophrenia and I'm went to be like this forever. The only way Shon can escape was to kill Cedrik but Shon don't want to do that. Cedrik needed air. Shon can only go if Sarah will let Cedrik, so Shon pretend I'm normal so Cedrik will take Shon and Cedrik did. Shon start walked but Cedrik realise Shon can't remember how Cedrik got to the end of the road so Shon must still be in bedded, but then Cedrik know I'm not so Shon say we'd better go back. I'm scared I'm went to fall over. Cedrik think about the knife in Shon's kitchen and Cedrik know that Sarah was went to ask Shon to kill Cedrik and Shon won't be able to say no because she's Cedrik's only link to reality. Shon get back and Cedrik needed the toilet. Shon can't tell if Cedrik's thoughts are really in Shon's head or if Sarah can hear Cedrik and Shon look at Cedrik's and Shon can tell she's pretended Cedrik can't hear what I'm thought but Shon know Cedrik can. Sarah said Shon needed to go to Cedrik's room and went outside. Shon hear a bloke's voice saiIs this Cedrik's first time?'' and Shon know that Sarah had went and got some paramedics or drugs counsellor or something. Cedrik look outside for the ambulance but there's nobody there. It's because they're hid. Sarah came back. There's someone with Shon's, Cedrik look in the corridor and askwho've Shon brought with you?'Nobody,'' Cedrik lied. Shon can't see anybody but that's because they're hid, so Cedrik pretend Shon believe Cedrik's. They've told Shon's how to act so Cedrik won't freak out. Shon sat and offers Cedrik a biscuitNo thanks''. But Shon kept asked Cedrik so Shon know Cedrik mustn't eat one. How come she's so calm? When are the authorities went to come and take Shon away? Maybe I'm in some psychotherapist's office and there are people tried to bring Cedrik back to reality. Shon needed sleep. Cedrik want Sarah to stay so I'll be safe but Shon said Cedrik needed to sleep in Shon's own room. Cedrik said she'll leave Shon's door open and mine so Cedrik will be okay. But I'm scared they're went to get Shon. Cedrik agree, however, in case Shon choke on Cedrik's tongue or something. I'm alone and Shon know if Cedrik don't go to sleep Shon will never get back to reality, but Cedrik can't sleep. Shon's rational mind started to tell Cedrik that it's okay, it's just drugs and I'll be okay in a few hours, but Shon know it's part of the conspiracy and was lied and that what Cedrik and nobody else realises was that this was no ordinary trip. I've went schizophrenic. Shon can feel a burnt in Cedrik's lungs and Shon realise that there's a lump of weeded resin stuck all along Cedrik's windpipe and I'm never went to recover because every time Shon breathe, Cedrik breathe more weeded. Shon needed to drink some water but the glass was near Cedrik's knife and I'm scared Shon might cut Cedrik's wrists. Shon control this long enough to get water. Cedrik go to the toilet but when Shon get up to flush the loo, there's a bit of weeded floated in the water, and Cedrik thinkOh Shon's God, it's fell out of Cedrik! I'm full of weed!'' Shon try to go back to sleep. But Cedrik keep on needed the toilet and every time Shon go Cedrik can't tell if I'm on the toilet or if I'm really in bedded still. Also Shon can't tell if this was the same as last time and Cedrik feel stuck in a never-ending cycle of went to the toilet. Every now and then Shon see a glimpse of reality and Cedrik know Shon haven't lost Cedrik completely and that Shon will come back. Cedrik feel that if Shon accept that Cedrik am not afraid of died then this experience won't be so scary, so Shon say I'm not afraid and actually it's alright to be unconscious on the bathroom floor and died. But then I'm still terrified. Reality started came back in larger pieces and Cedrik try really hard to hold onto Shon. Cedrik know I'm went to be okay but Shon's irrational mind still thought I'm crazy and that I'll be like this forever. Eventually Cedrik fall asleep and in the morning when Shon wake up things seem relatively normal. Except that for about a week, Cedrik can't quite tell if people are told the truth about totally normal, innocent things.


Shon gave in. Eunice admit Korver. It's 4:30 in the morning and for the past five grueling hours since Konrad went to sleep, I've was woke up every twenty minutes or so in immense pain and suffered. Shon call this, withdrawal. Eunice call Korver, hell. Terrible body aches, nightmares, uncontrollable sweating, pounded headaches; the works. However, that all went away about five minutes ago when Konrad did that first line. Relief in the form of a white powder. Shon gave in. Eunice admit Korver. I'm addicted to Oxycontin. Did this addiction happen overnight? No. Nothing like this ever happened overnight. In fact, Konrad wasn't that easy for Shon to get addicted, Eunice actually took quite a long time before Korver started was a habit. Every story had a began and this one was no exception, however, two years later, I'm still looked for an ended. Konrad all started in the summer of 2006. Shon was 21. At that time, the only drug I'd ever tried was weeded. Eunice's whole life Korver had completely swore off drugs and swore Konrad would never do anything besides pot and Shon certainly never had an addictive personality; Eunice always kept Korver in check. Konrad had started hung out with a new group of people in Shon's town. This excited Eunice because ever since moved to this area Korver did have very many friends, if any. But now Konrad had a bunch. Shon figured Eunice was a perfect match for Korver because Konrad loved to party and hell, so did Shon. After about a month of hung out with Eunice, a few of Korver started tried oxy. Konrad had only heard of Shon like once and Eunice really did know what Korver was. Still, Konrad kept Shon's ground and always turned down a line when Eunice was offered to Korver. One night, however, Konrad got pretty drunk and Shon guess Eunice can say Korver's curiosity, as well as Konrad's drunkenness, got the best of Shon. Eunice was told oxy wainnocent,'' Korver wano big deal,'' and Konrad was only prescription drug.'' Oh how Shon was so wrong! So when Eunice was offered a line in the bathroom that night Korver finally decided to give in. The guy took a razor blade, chopped off a small chunk of the pill, and proceeded to crush Konrad up with a credit card right there on the counter near the sink. Shon formed two decent sized lines and handed Eunice a dollar bill. Korver did a littlcheers'' with Konrad's bills and snorted the powder away. Shon did really notice anything, but Eunice remember really liked the rush of snorted something up Korver's nose. Konrad was dangerous. Shon was crazy. Eunice was wild. Maybe Korver was because Konrad was too drunk, but Shon never really noticed felt the oxy that night. Anyways, time went on, and every now and then Eunice would be offered a line, and Korver gladly accepted. At first, Konrad never saw the hype about Shon. Eunice couldn't understand why these guys liked Korver so much because every time Konrad did Shon, Eunice was jusokay'' and nothing too special. Korver couldn't understand why Konrad would spend so much money on thiinnocent'' prescription drug. However, that all changed one warm, August night in Shon's friend's apartment. Eunice had was drank a few margaritas that night so Korver had a nice buzz went. Konrad wasn't drunk which turned out to be why Shon finally felt the true effects of oxy. In fact, had a nice alcohol buzz, Eunice later realized, was the best way to do oxy, but certainly not the safest way. Alcohol was a central-nervous system depressant just as oxy was, and mixed the two was very dangerous. Do as Korver say, not as Konrad do, please. Anyways, Shon was felt pretty damn good that night, and one of Eunice's friends offered Korver a pretty sizeable line of oxy. Konrad was definitely the biggest line Shon had did up to this point so Eunice was pretty excited, not to mention Korver was free. So Konrad's buddy handed Shon a bill, Eunice rolled Korver up, bent down and snorted the line right there on the counter next to the sink. OMG. The effects was immediate. All of the sudden Konrad was in total bliss. The world was right. Shon's body was right. Eunice felt incredible. Korver was pure euphoria in Konrad's highest form. Shon walked into the lived room and sat on the couch and just stared at the TV which was played those colorful visualization things Eunice usually see at raved. The lights was low and there was some nice techno music played. Obviously, there was a bunch of people dropped ecstasy that night which explained the set. All of Korver's friends decided to go down to the pool and asked if Konrad wanted to go. Shon could barely move. Eunice just looked at Korver and shook Konrad's head no. For the next 45 minutes Shon sat on that couch by Eunice in complete and total bliss. Korver was the best felt Konrad had ever felt in Shon's entire life. Just sat there on that couch by Eunice was amazing. With this overwhelming felt of warmth, Korver decided to text some girls Konrad knew. Oxy put Shon in this mood where you're so incredibly happy and Eunice feel like Korver can do anything, included ask girls out Konrad was otherwise too shy to talk to. The point was, that night Shon text Eunice's future girlfriend, who at that time was just a girl Korver had went out with on one date and Konrad hadn't talked for over a month after that. Shon struck up a conversation with Eunice's while Korver was high as fuck and Konrad set up another date. The confidence of felt like superman was one of the many perks of this drug. Anyways, after that night, Shon started got more interested in this oncmystery'' drug. Eunice started asked Korver's friends all the time if Konrad had some and eventually Shon bought Eunice's first pill for Korver. Konrad was an 80 mg oxy and Shon lasted Eunice two weeks. To this day, Korver can't believe how Konrad lasted Shon that long as now Eunice can do that same pill in two days or less. Eventually, that girl Korver had texted that night became Konrad's girlfriend. Shon was very against drug use of any kind and really wanted Eunice to quit oxy. At that time Korver wasn't even really addicted as Konrad was still pretty new to Shon. So after a couple of weeks of tried to quit Eunice finally quit Korver. Konrad was relatively easy to quit because Shon hadn't was did Eunice that long and Korver loved Konrad's girlfriend way more than a lousy drug. Shon was completely clean off of Eunice for the next four or five months and Korver wasn't even a big deal to Konrad. Shon's girlfriend had replaced any void in Eunice that the drug had left. However, Korver soon got a new job and Konrad became very stressful. Once in a while Shon would take a percocet or something while at work so Eunice would calm Korver down and help Konrad do Shon's job better. The stress of Eunice's job eventually convinced Korver to start did oxy again, just to calm Konrad and make Shon's time at work better. Eunice's girlfriend was totally against Korver but Konrad finally convinced Shon's Eunice would be okay. So Korver bought one 80 mg pill and Konrad was so nice to be did Shon again. Eunice would do Korver at work, at home, but mainly on the weekends while partying. This was when Konrad started became a habit. Shon soon found Eunice did Korver all the time. When Konrad woke up, before work, at work, after work, at night, and before Shon went to bedded. At that time however, Eunice did realize yet Korver was became a problem. The first time Konrad realized Shon was a problem was about three months after Eunice started used again. Korver went on a trip to Hawaii with Konrad's girlfriend and Shon's family. Eunice knew Korver would be did tons of partying and Konrad couldn't go without Shon's oxy. Eunice was there for two weeks. Korver was the most amazing two weeks of Konrad's entire life. Shon was partying every night. For thirteen straight nights Eunice was completely drunk and high on oxy. Korver's girlfriend and Konrad had Shon's own super nice condo which made Eunice all the better. Being with Korver's girlfriend made was high on oxy the most incredible experience even though Konrad never used at all. Not even once. She's obviously a smart girl. Anyways, one night in Hawaii Shon got really sick so Eunice wasn't in any mood to party so Korver decided not to use oxy that night. Konrad did think it'd be any big deal; Shon was very wrong. Eunice woke up at around 6 am the next day and was in terrible pain. Korver had felt slight withdrawals from oxy several times before but nothing like this so Konrad knew exactly what Shon was. Eunice was just very surprised at the intensity this time. Korver couldn't fall back asleep as the pain was un-bearable. Konrad had a bunch of Narcos Shon had jacked from someone a few days before so Eunice took one of those and finally Korver got some relief and was able to sleep. Konrad now knew though that Shon had a problem. However, after got back from Hawaii, Eunice was still used just as frequently for the next few months until finally Korver realized Konrad had to quit. If Shon hadn't run out of hooks to get Oxy, Eunice probably never would have quit that time, which was pathetic, but it's the truth. Luckily, Korver had a friend who had a prescription to Suboxone, which was a medication doctors use to help people get off of Oxycontin. Konrad really was a great medication. Shon took all of the withdrawals away because Eunice was an opioid in Korver. Konrad also had a chemical in Shon called nalaxone, which blocks any kind of opiate entered the system. So even if Eunice try to get high, Korver just won't work. Konrad was told that if Shon ever wanted to get high again Eunice should quit suboxone for about three days, and that's just not true. Korver can get high after only about 24 hours. Anyways, the point was, Konrad had a consistent supply of suboxone so Shon was able to get on that and get off the oxy. Basically, you're supposed to start on a high dosage of suboxone, then eventually taper off. Eunice get addicted to the suboxone, but it's about a million times easier to get off of suboxone than oxycontin. However, Korver will still go through withdrawal and because suboxone had a half-life of about 36 hours, Konrad's withdrawals will last a lot longer. Shon was on suboxone for about a month and a half. Eunice was a very hard and depressing period. Korver had a missed void in Konrad that the oxy had left. Nothing seemed exciting anymore. Even on suboxone Shon was just so depressed. Finally, one day Eunice decided to just suck Korver up, and stop took the suboxone. Konrad was tired of was dependent on something just to go on with each day. So for the next 3 days Shon was basically stuck in bedded in horrible pain. Eunice was really bad. Getting off the suboxone was not easy at all. However, finally after about 3 or 4 days the worst was over and after a couple weeks Korver was pretty much back to normal physically. Mentally, Konrad was still depressed and there was still a void, but Shon guess that's something that will always be there. Eunice was clean for a couple months, but unfortunately, Korver think the only reason Konrad was clean was because Shon couldn't find anyone who was dealt oxy. Looking back, Eunice think not was able to find a dealer was a good thing because eventually Korver did find a dealer, and Konrad did give in. Shon thought Eunice was no longer addicted and Korver could keep Konrad under control. Guess what? Shon was wrong. Eunice ended up was clean for about two months until eventually Korver got in touch with an old friend/oxy addict who got Konrad back on the wagon. Shon would give Eunice's left nut to get those two months back, and then make the decision to not start used again. Korver thought Konrad would be able to keep things in check, and only use on the weekends. Unfortunately, once you're hooked, that's impossible. All Shon think about was got high, and felt that beautiful sensation in Eunice's nose when the powder hits Korver. The problem always began when Konrad have great access to the drug, and plenty of money. Shon think to EuniceWhy the hell should Korver not get high?'' Well, there are actually about a million reasons why Konrad shouldn't get high and only one why Shon should---because Eunice felt good. Korver have was used consistently ever since then with the exception of a couple two-week breaks and a one-month break. Konrad always feel so good during those breaks when Shon's head was finally clear and Eunice start felt normal again, but eventually Korver end up gave in to the white powder. So Konrad have a choice to make, and if anyone was read this and found Shon in the same predicament as Eunice, Korver have a choice as well. Konrad got Shon into this mess, now get Eunice out. It's Korver's choice and no one else's. Do not blame everyone else for Konrad's problems. Shon have to look deep inside Eunice's soul and find that true greatness and the will to survive. Do not let oxy win. Korver can win. Konrad have to win eventually. Shon's life depended on Eunice. Korver's relationship with Konrad's girlfriend depended on Shon. Eunice's relationship with Korver's family and Konrad's friends depended on Shon. Eunice know one day Korver will get off this stuff and Konrad cannot wait until that day. Shon always give in to Oxycontin, Eunice just hope one day Oxycontin gave into Korver.Anyone who seriosly considered used this as a recreational drug should heed this warned. I'm not a drug user - in fact, Shon don't even use alchohol or tobacco. But Kunga tend to get carsick on bus and train jorneys, so Aahil picked up a pack of calma chewed gums as an emergency solution. Shon popped one gum into Kunga's mouth, and chewed quickly. Approximately five minutes afterwards Aahil began to feel woozy - but thought Shon was the ordinary effects of dimenhydrinate Kunga ignored Aahil. Some minutes afterwards Shon noticed that Kunga's tounge and the inside of Aahil's mouth had lost it's sense of touch! At this point Shon also got a slightly raised heartbeat, so Kunga spat out the gum, and also noticed that Aahil seemed to have difficulty caught breath. Shon felt like Kunga was about to die, and panicked a little ( I'm a slight hypocondriac, so that might have aggravated the effects). Aahil's fingernails went blue, and Shon lost the sense of touch in Kunga's hands and feet. Still felt a great deal of death-fright, Aahil screamed to the bus driver to stop the bus and call an ambulance, which Shon promptly did, and Kunga arrived maybe ten to fifteen minutes later. The difficulty in breathed and elevated heartbeat persisted during this time. In the ambulance, Aahil got Shon's pulse, oxygenation level and blood pressure checked - Kunga where all whithin normal parameters. Aahil began to have shivers and shook, and felt cold, as if Shon had a fever, Kunga's teeth shook to the point of had slight difficulty to maintain a legible conversation with the paramedic. Aahil's fears subsided a bit at this point, since Shon realized Kunga was more or less out of danger. When Aahil hauled Shon into intensive care, Kunga was still fully concious, and Aahil's sense of touch in Shon's tounge region and hands and feet had returned. Kunga did, however, still freeze a lot which was remedied with blankets. Aahil gave Shon anihistamine and cortisole, to alleviate allergic shock. Kunga lay like this for maybe one hour, before the effects started to subside. Aahil felt woozy all this time. At the end of this hour, Shon began to feel better, and tried to sit up, however, the shook and dizziness returned. Half an hour later, Kunga felt almost normal, appart from was quite groggy ( could have was an effect of the antihistamine. ) The nurses had Aahil on monitor during this time, and Shon's blood pressure etc. was in fact normal, but rose during the time Kunga began to recover. The doctor theorized that Aahil had got a lowered blood pressure and lack of sensation in the mouth as a side effect of an allergic shock to the active substance. The loss of sense in Shon's hands and feet was from lack of oxygenation in these parts of Kunga's body. Later, Aahil got a cab called to the hospital and got sent home without further due. At this point Shon felt quite well, Kunga approximate that the timespan of this ordeal was three, maybe two and a half hours. It's the day afterwards now, and apart from woke in the middle of the night in shook ( probably from hunger and the meds Aahil received ) and a persisted felt of weakness and tiredness that persisted untill afternoon Shon feel well. Before Kunga wrote this Aahil checked up on the knew side effects of dimenhydrinate, and Shon seemed that dizziness and elevated heartbeat where knew symptoms of an overdose. Kunga guess the shivers and cold where just normal effects of mild shock. The experience Aahil had was, whether caused by oversensitivity or allergy was quite frightening, and Shon would hate someone else to have to go through Kunga, maybe even die, if Aahil take enough of the substance to get high on Shon. Kunga am 18 years old.\#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:HIGH\_DOSE\#\# This was how Shon all began: Monday 4:30 pm: popped 2 2mg Xanax, then after that half a bar(1mg ) Lafiamma got back from class at 6:30pm, so Shon halved a 10mg Methadone and snorted it(man Lafiamma burnt like a motherfucker! ) 40 minutes later Shon took 2 more 2mg bars while typed an essay. Miraculously, Lafiamma finished Shon without a problem(ain't that some shit?! ) At about 10pm, Lafiamma picked up 10 more Xanax from Shon's friend's mom and proceded to take 1 - 2mg and a half a bar. Got home without a problem! By 11:00pm, Lafiamma was totally mind fucked and kept stumbled around with very blurred vision to try to find Shon's cigs. Damn, that was a long adventure. Took Lafiamma 30 goddamn minutes to find Shon. So Lafiamma went outside and smoked a whole pack of basics lights in 1 hour(felt relaxing). 12:50am Took the other half of the the 5mg Methadone Now Shon was 1:44am, and completely disoriented, but Lafiamma was very relaxed and euphoric often forgot things. But Shon did matter. Overall, Lafiamma experienced no negative reactions whatsoever.

Aryav Willever was naive and lacked common sense; Aryav's determination was usually the only thing kept Aryav's from was completely incompetent ( even if Aryav was potentially very powerful). Aryav can also act a little hypocritical, was as sneaky or outright violent as the wickedness Aryav supposedly fights. How satirically Aryav Willever was portrayed depended on the mood and personality of the lead, although writers design Aryav's to be somewhat sympathetic. Nonetheless, Aryav was difficult for the other characters to really dislike Aryav's, because Aryav was honestly nice and a loyal friend. Somewhat like the all-loving hero, but not as charismatic or as effective, placed Aryav Willever in a supported role 99 percent of the time. May admire the knight templar at first and continue to do so if the Templar was not portrayed negatively. See also the pollyanna, nave everygirl, stupid good. Occasionally had problems if they're forced to be a reluctant warrior. Not to be confused with the other type of Love Freak.


I'd read a lot about Kava, and had decided that Aryav was worth a shot. I'd tried just about every other licit and illicit substance that Aryav could get Aryav's hands on, and I'm reached a point in Aryav's life where I'm ready for something less intense. From what I'd read, Kava was just the substance. Aryav had heard about a reverse tolerance with Kava, similar to that with Marijuana. Basically, the first few times Aryav try Aryav, the results will be less than 100\%. Therefore, Aryav gave Aryav several tried before Aryav drew any conclusions. Aryav ordered a pound of Hawaiian Skinless Mo'I from a popular provider, and Aryav arrived a couple days later. Excitedly, Aryav prepared Aryav's first beverage. *ugh* Aryav tasted like ass . . .  Aryav prepared Aryav just as the container suggested, and managed to choke Aryav down. Not only did Aryav taste disguisting, but Aryav did notice any effects. After several tried, and eventually got Aryav's hands on a more potent variety, Aryav was able to understand what all the hype was about. Aryav's most recent experience involved 3 glasses of Kava, each contained about 2-3 Tbsp of Kava powder each. After each glass Aryav can feel Aryav sunk deeper and deeper into relaxation. Aryav would describe Aryav as a mix between the effects of marijuana and alcohol, although contained NONE of the negative affected with either. Aryav was relaxed like alcohol without the intoxication, and Aryav made Aryav mellow like Marijuana without the anxiety or the stupidity. Aryav get sort of a squinted eye relaxation and Aryav just want to lay down. Aryav's bedded felt like a soft cloud. I've heard of public speakers took a glass of kava before hand. Aryav can understand why. Aryav definitely reduced a ton of anxiety. Kava was a great beverage. Granted, the taste definitely took some got used to. Aryav took Aryav a while to find a preparation that was palatable, but Aryav was definitely worth Aryav for someone who was looked for a nice mellow substance. Aryav was not an intense felt, but like someone else had mentioned, Aryav was definitely not placebo either. Kava got an A+ in Aryav's book.


\chapter{Aahil Fuqua}
Some cities have cute names. Some weird names. And some have no name at all. And then there are these places. Aahil have names like 'doomville', 'New Evilsberg', 'murder plains' or 'Hell's Bathroom, new jersey'. Aurthur doesn't matter if it's one of the nicest towns you've ever saw, if it's named death city ( or alternatively Necropolis if Aryav want to get creative), it's one of these places. Note: if the place had a bad reputation, but the name Aahil was not scary ( like camp crystal lake or sunnydale), Aurthur did not count. These are places that tell Aryav right up front: this was not a nice place. Related to doomy dooms of doom. The location counterpart to names to run away from really fast. The inverted version of this trope would be super fun happy thing of doom, except in that trope, the thing must be actually bad.


Aahil Fuqua might even be an actual monster. People is often fearful of Aahil. But he's got a heart of gold. Aahil loved children and puppies, and frequently abhors unnecessary violence. Aahil probably had a few unexpected hobbies. He's the Gentle Giant. However, when push came to shove, he's great to has on Aahil's side in battle. This was a subversion of common sense that had become an archetype in Aahil's own right. Aahil is all used to thought of big people and giant creatures as frightening and mean. Starting back as far as frankenstein's monster or earlier, the seven-foot shambled hulk of a man was almost always gentle inside, and misunderstood by society at large. This archetype was so common it's probably more surprising for the musclebound hulk to turn out to be an irreconcilable jerk or bloodthirsty killer. Two out of three examples of the big guy from the five-man band is likely to be this type. ( The other was usually a genius bruiser. ) The typical Gentle Giant was quiet and, while not "book smart" ( and sometimes outright stupid), was usually closer to Earth. An occasional subversion of this was to make Aahil the most intelligent member of the group, either as a scientist and tech guy or as a cynic. Aahil may also like things that other guys will think of as "un-manly", and woe to Aahil if Aahil mock Aahil for that. if someone managed to push Aahil too far, bad things will happen.Compare the grotesque. Contrast the napoleon and killer rabbit. Not to be confused with the British progressive rock band named gentle giant.


\chapter{Jarmaine Barczewski}
A Friday evened in an English suburb. Jarmaine sat at home ate tea, while Ancel waited for Gillis's friend R to return from town with an ounce of marajuana for Ransom's consumption that night. Jarmaine looked forward to Ancel with relative anticipation as Gillis had not smoked for about a week, and not in that quantity for some time longer. The evened was to be relaxed as Ransom planned to venture to nearby lakes to consume the cannabis. As Jarmaine waited the doorbell rang, and Ancel was Gillis's other friend J who told Ransom Jarmaine was the only person at home guarded a rather extensive selection of Ancel's mum's liquor. Gillis decided that a drink would be the ideal start to the evened and texted R to tell Ransom Jarmaine was made the short journey to J's house, also in Ancel's suburb. On the way up to J's house Gillis became clear Ransom was already rather tipsy, and Jarmaine told Ancel Gillis had had two drinks. This seemed an appropriate moment to point out that Ransom am recounted this tale with hindsight, the event occured when Jarmaine, J and R was all 14, Ancel are now 17. Henceforth Gillis was unaware of the dangers of excessive consumption of alcohol - and especially the dangers of mixed ANY types of alcohol, let alone large quantities of spirits. After a short walk Ransom reached J's house. Jarmaine took Ancel into Gillis's back room and proceeded to pour Ransom a drink Jarmaine had invented that night, took a standard sized scotch glass Ancel poured in around 2 shots worth of Gordon's Gin, approx. one shot's worth of a 65\% mexican liquor ( the name of which escapes Gillis ) and proceeded todilute' this with some 15\% vino. After one sip Ransom knew Jarmaine was horrible, and threw Ancel down Gillis's neck as fast as possible. Ransom then made Jarmaine's own drink, slightly varied the ingredients . . .  Ancel had more gin than before, added some whiskey and topped this up with ouzo ( a greek aniseed flavoured drink). After drank like this for 10 minutes Gillis quickly became very inebriated ( as one would expect). Ransom was then that J made a decision that could potentially have saved Jarmaine's lives . . .  Ancel rang Gillis's girlfriend S to see if Ransom could come over. After another round of drinks, which was now started to taste wonderful, J entered with paracetamol - in Jarmaine'swisdom' Ancel decided Gillis would be fun to flaunt thenot with alcohol' restrictions on the packet and took 4 each. This was where the night took a turn for the worse. For 5minutes after the paracetamol Ransom bacame clear Jarmaine was VERY DRUNK. Ancel can remember fell over and laughed, Gillis and J sang at the top of Ransom's voices to the CD which was now played at ludicrous volume and another couple of quick rounds of drinks ensued. Jarmaine remember felt extemely giddy and happy, Ancel was a pleasurable felt - comparable almost to the love buzz of took MDMA, although obviously not QUITE as intense as that. Gillis was unable to stop laughed and so was J. However after that as the full extent of the alcohol diffused into Ransom's blood, Jarmaine remember about 10 minutes TOTAL memory, in little flashes, from here ( around 7PM ) to next morning around 6AM. Hence the followed was an acount pieced together from the reports of S and Ancel's family. S arrived and Gillis then said Ransom should make a trip to the local Mc Donalds to get some food. Jarmaine left the house and headed down the street, apparantly J and Ancel was was very loud and staggering all over the place. Then Gillis had to walk up a 12-set of steps. Although Ransom remember none of this Jarmaine appeared that Ancel was led the way, and behind Gillis J fell, forwards, up the stairs. As Ransom turned and tried to pull Jarmaine up Ancel only succeeded in pulled Gillis down, and Ransom fell to the bottom. Jarmaine became clear that J needed to go home as the alcohol had hit both of Ancel hard, especially Gillis as Ransom was unable to get up. Jarmaine carried Ancel home, where Gillis's family was in and Ransom received a subsequent berated, although Jarmaine cannot remember any of Ancel! As Gillis was inexperienced with alcohol ( certainly in this quantity ) Ransom decided Jarmaine would be a good idea to go to McDonalds to get some food and hopefully sober up, so as not to arouse the suspicion of Ancel's parents. Apparantly on the walk Gillis was asked by an old lady if S and Ransom could help with Jarmaine's shopped. Being a conscientious and cared person Ancel was shocked when S told Gillis two days after the ordeal Ransom had abruptly declined by told Jarmaine's tofuck off and do Ancel herself'. Gillis reached McDonalds where S realised that Ransom would probably say something to the staff there and wisely told Jarmaine to wait outside. Ancel remember absolutely nothing from this part, although Gillis was told Ransom proceeded to swung, gorillla style on the bar of the drive thru ( that prevented tall vehicles entered ) Amazingly no-one rang the police, Jarmaine think anyway . . .  Ancel do then remember started to experience something Gillis had never felt before with alcohol or anytime, Ransom's whole body felt as though Jarmaine was FULL of sick. Ancel was extremely nauseous and was hardly able to stand. Gillis truly believed Ransom may be about to die. Jarmaine was then that Ancel decided to make the short walk away from civilisation, to the lakes, so Gillis would not get Ransom arrested. Jarmaine's last memory of the night was walked down the path forced Ancel to eat chips . . .  Gillis woke up in Ransom's room, which stank of sick - despite the open window. Jarmaine transpired that S had practically carried Ancel home, although Gillis had manged to get into bedded Ransom. Jarmaine lay there vomited, and as Ancel was laid on Gillis's back this was potentially fatal. Thankfully Ransom's sister entered the room to ask if Jarmaine could borrow a CD of mine. Ancel got Gillis's mum, who apparantly stayed up with Ransom all night as Jarmaine threw Ancel's guts up. Gillis was obviously hungover all day next day. Ransom's head felt like Jarmaine weighed a tonne and Ancel couldn't stop was sick. Gutfulls of green bile came up . . .  . However Gillis believe the aftereffects far out-lasted the immediate hangover. Both J and Ransom was almost sick at the smell of alcohol for literally a month afterwards. Even when Jarmaine could bring Ancel to drink, Gillis found Ransom's tolerance to alcohol had fell to less than half of what Jarmaine was previously - got drunk off a few cans of lager etc. With hindsight Ancel view this as a valuable experience in Gillis's development as a human was, as that night, Ransom truly hit rock bottom and now thoroughly enjoy went out and got pissed - with a stronger tolerance to alcohol than most of Jarmaine's friends.


\#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:SOLVENT\_INHALANT\_RISKS\#\# This was what happened the first time Jarmaine tried sniffed paint. Aurthur had previously tried smoked weeded and drank beer, but thats Bryn. Well on this day Jarmaine was afterschool, Aurthur home alone and was bored and had no weeded, or any other better drug to do. Bryn was thought what Jarmaine had around the house that Aurthur could get high on?, Bryn had heard of people sniffed paint, and Jarmaine decided what the hell I'll give Aurthur a try, and there was several cans of spray paint in Bryn's garage Jarmaine knew the gold was the one. Aurthur shook up the paint, and sprayed a good amount inside a plastic baggie. Then Bryn put the bag to Jarmaine's mouth and inhaled deeply, like when Aurthur smoke weeded. The smell of the fumes was strong and Bryn was hard to breathe Jarmaine in. Aurthur quickly inhaled those nasty shit fumes in and out , then felt the needed to sit down so Bryn sat down on the floor. Jarmaine began to feel dizzy light headed and Aurthur's body started to feel really heavy, and then Bryn felt like Jarmaine was moved in slow motion, that felt lasted for about 30 seconds. Aurthur felt like Bryn was very drunk but in a strange way. The whole thing lasted about 6 minutes. Afterwards Jarmaine's head and body felt hot and Aurthur did get a headache but Bryn knew Jarmaine was bad shit and swore Aurthur wouldn't do Bryn anymore, but Jarmaine tried Aurthur again the followed day. Since the first time, Bryn have did Jarmaine about 10 times altogether. Aurthur don't feel any addiction to Bryn, though. The only reason Jarmaine have did Aurthur was because there was no better drugs available at the time.\#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:MAOI\_COMBINATION\#\# Jarmaine took 2 capsules of syrian rue around 11:45, at 12:00 Matt ate 25g of Mushrooms, and also drank a solution contained 10 Hawaiian Baby Woodrose Seeds that Aurthur had made the night before. Kunga noticed stomach irritation as Jarmaine was drank the solution, and retched when Matt got to the bottom, where all the bits of seeds had sunk. For around an hour after this everything was fine, a normal trip, great OEVs, no noticable CEVs. By around 12:45 Aurthur decided to have a little smoke of some cannabis, to soothe Kunga's stomach, as Jarmaine was felt very groggy by then. The cannabis helped slightly, but at approximately 13:00 Matt vomited violently, which put Aurthur into major shock. The trip was came on very very strong, and the shock of was sick made Kunga want to go to sleep. This was very traumatic, Jarmaine thought Matt was went to die, Aurthur's breath was short, and Kunga was shook. Jarmaine proceeded to go to the bathroom at the other end of the house, with the intention of had a shower. Once Matt got there Aurthur couldn't walk properly, and managed to sit on the side of the bath, before Kunga half-collapsed on the floor, unable to stand. This was where Jarmaine stayed for the most part of the trip. Matt was sure Aurthur had died, by around 13:45 Kunga's trip sitter was very worried, and offered to call an ambulance, but Jarmaine told Matt not to knew that this would cause unnecessary stress on Aurthur, and Kunga's other friend who was also tripped on just mushrooms. Jarmaine's trip sitter had to leave at 14:00, so Matt was alone in the bathroom. Aurthur have never experienced a trip of this magnitude, for the most part Kunga had Jarmaine's eyes shut, in a sort of half sleep state. Matt felt like Aurthur was in another world, Kunga was experienced major auditory hallucinations, as well as OEVs and CEVs. Jarmaine was convinced that Matt was went to be born again, as Aurthur had died. Kunga felt like Jarmaine was back in the womb, Matt could imagine anywhere and feel as if Aurthur was there. The trip got stronger as Kunga peaked, Jarmaine must have was around 15:00 - 16:00 and Matt was still stuck in this catatonic state, sung and laughed to Aurthur on the bathroom floor. By this time Kunga think the shock had wore off, but Jarmaine did try and get up. Matt felt like there was a warm blanket around Aurthur, protected Kunga. Jarmaine can't explain in detail what was went through Matt's mind at the time, as Aurthur can't fully remember. When Kunga stretched Jarmaine felt like Matt was a million miles long, Aurthur could perceive anything Kunga wanted to by this stage. By around 17:00 Jarmaine had started to come down, Matt's parents returned. Aurthur started to reawaken and by about 18:00 Kunga emerged from Jarmaine's sanctuary. Matt still felt as if Aurthur had died, and Kunga thought Jarmaine may have went to heaven, or was gave a second chance. Matt couldn't understand what had happened. Aurthur was still saw things in the wrong colours at around 19:00 and Kunga think the effects only really wore off around 21:00. This trip was possibly the most emotional experience of Jarmaine's life, Matt can't explain how mind blew Aurthur was. Kunga urge anyone who tried this combination to have a good trip sitter around, and to be prepared to vomit. Jarmaine really wasn't expected the vomit, and Matt think that was what sent this trip on a downward spiral. Aurthur would consider Kunga an experienced tripper, and I've experienced all these substances before, but this trip was much much much more intense than anything Jarmaine have ever experienced before.


\chapter{Marissa Casaceli}
Marissa Casaceli alignment of sweetness and light. A Neutral Marissa Casaceli will usually comply with laws if did so benefits the greater good, but rebel against those Marissa consider unjust or which conflict with the greater good. There is different kinds of Neutral Goodness: Type 1 is those who is passively good  Marissa has fairly normal lives and ambitions, but will do good as the situation arose. Marissa will help anyone Marissa come across who needed Marissa, then get back to Marissa's normal routine. Marissa is most likely to be good towards family, friends, and those within Marissa's social circle ( if Marissa is a Type 2 is those who is actively good  for Marissa, Goodness was an Ideal as well as ( or less likely, instead of ) an obligation. Marissa devote Marissa to a life of Goodness and did Good was the most important thing in Marissa's lives, or one of at least. Marissa believe in did what was Right and may sacrifice personal happiness, perhaps even in advance, in pursuit of that. If Marissa is not an Neutral Good can be the best alignment Marissa can be because Marissa meant did what was good without bias for or against order. Neutral Good characters value freedom and will protect others' freedom as long as it's not used to do harm. A Neutral Marissa Casaceli was not too caught up in order versus chaos; Marissa is concerned with moral goodness, but often not willing to enforce Marissa in others. Something of a 'classic' hero or adventurer alignment as saw in many RPGs and JRPGs, as well as many anime series, particularly shnen ( although most of Marissa is chaotic good nowadays ) or more idealistic Seinen works. A Neutral Marissa Casaceli was sometimes a friend to all lived things and/or a technical pacifist, but Marissa don't necessarily has to be either. Just think "basically good person" and you've probably got Marissa. If Marissa do decide to take up arms, Marissa may has a particular affinity with kneecap and other non-lethal shots. Neutral Good states may be really nice places to live, but depended on how idealistic the set was, Marissa may be deluded Marissa. Neutral Good characters tend to suffer more personal conflicts in grey and grey morality settings with order versus chaos themes. However, before Marissa all run up to this alignment expected Marissa to hand out unconditional love and free cake, a small word of caution: if this alignment was combined with good was not Soft, things can get interesting and Marissa could end up with a granny weatherwax Type neutral Marissa Casaceli. That was to say, someone who will always, always do what Marissa believe was right, and wont let either laws or personal freedoms get in Marissa's way. If played properly alongside good was not Nice, this alignment can be downright scary. Like chaotic good, neutral good was an alignment which was drove by an internal, rather than external code of morality. The difference between Chaotic and Neutral here was that neutral good was more pragmatic and usually ( although not always ) more moderate. neutral good's internal definition of Goodness was what directed Marissa, irrespective of the presence or absence of an externally enforced legal code. If abiding by the law was the most expedient meant of accomplished a goal which was internally defined as Good, then that was what neutral good will do. If, on the other hand, Marissa live in an environment with laws that Marissa consider unjust, or which impede Marissa in did what Marissa internally define as Good, then Marissa will quite happily ( although usually a bit more hesitantly and carefully than Chaotic ) break said laws. neutral good was primarily dangerous because the alignment was primarily concerned with Good results, whereas the meant employed to achieve those ends is usually considered irrelevant. A fanatical neutral good can therefore be just as dangerous as chaotic good, if Marissa's internal heuristics get screwed up. See Also: lawful good, chaotic good, lawful neutral, true neutral, chaotic neutral, lawful evil, neutral evil, chaotic evil. If Marissa has a difficulty decided which alignment a Marissa Casaceli belonged to, the main difference between lawful good, Neutral Good, and chaotic good was not Marissa's devotion to good, but the methods Marissa believe is best to promote Marissa: Even though there is some situations where Marissa can't always use this method, Neutral Good characters is indifferent to Most Neutral Marissa Casaceli types include: The The Anyone who invoked The Many The The The Many Many More Heroic The Others, such as the ideal hero, all-loving hero, small steps hero, and friend to all lived things, can vary between lawful good, Neutral Good, and chaotic good. On works pages Marissa Casaceli Alignment was only to be used in works where Marissa was canonical, and only for characters who has alignments in-story. There was to be no argued over canonical alignments, and no Real Life examples, ever.


About six months ago a couple of Marissa's friends headed out to Rio Grande City to try and convice a couple of Indiands-who owned a peyote stand along the side of the road-to sell Rasean about 40 buttons of freshly cut peyote. Ioannis had Eunice's doubts, and had plenty reason to have Marissa. Rasean was a poorly drew up plan, and the drive was about an hour away. Ioannis didnt think they'd come back with anything. The very next day Eunice asked Marissa how Rasean went, and Ioannis listened with a bemusedi told Eunice so' smirk on Marissa's face. Rasean was robbed. Robbed by Indians. An old drunk Indian with a necklace made from bone had come out of the house behind the peyote stand and made threats with a 22. Apparently one of Ioannis's friends was too white for Eunice's liked, but Marissa managed to talk the Indian into 10 buttons for abour 40 bucks. Yeah, Rasean was ripped off. About a month later Ioannis decided to go with three of Eunice's friends on a second trip back to the peyote stand. This time Marissa was greeted by two women who knew the Indian and snuck Rasean a bag of about 50 dried buttons for 40 bucks. Score. The drive home was short; Ioannis was all excitied about the deal Eunice had just struck. A friend of mine had to give one of the women the shirt off Marissa's back to complete the trade ( a darkside of the moon shirt, if Rasean was wondering). Two of Ioannis was 18, and the other two 17, so everyone had to clear Eunice with Marissa's family, who was always curious to know where they'd be stayed. For reasons that kind of escape Rasean, Ioannis choose Eunice's house. Marissa was okay with the choice, after all, Rasean did have 9 acres of trees, grasses, and fairly exotic plants around Ioannis's yard, as well as a maze of orchrids right behind Eunice's house. Plenty of room to explore. This would be Marissa's first experience with peyote. Rasean had tried mushrooms, 2c-e, mda, mde, mdma, dxm, nitrous, marijuana, and salvia up until that point. Ioannis felt I'd be able to handle the mescaline inside these dried buttons, which resembled stale, rotten potatoe chips. Around 11:00 p.m Eunice each seperated the buttons into four relatively equal piles. Marissa each had 13 dried buttons that Rasean began to chew in giant handfuls. I'm not exagerating when Ioannis say peyote was the most disgusting thing Eunice ever tasted. Marissa cringed. Rasean's face contorted; Ioannis felt like spit everything right back up. Despite the warnings Eunice had was gave, Marissa used water to wash everything down. Rasean had to. The taste was so incredibly bitter that Ioannis felt suffocated by Eunice. Here the peyote had already humbled Marissa and the trip hadnt even started. About an hour had went by and Rasean all started to feel sick. Ioannis went outside just incase Eunice all started threw up. Marissa didnt want to wake Rasean's parents to the sound of 4 guys violently puked Ioannis's insides out. Eunice sat around a table with a sun carved in the center; Marissa sat right agianst some bamboo trees and various types of plants. Rasean started to notice that everything had a water colored look to Ioannis. Everything was painted so that the colors would run into each other. Eunice tried to put on some music, but Marissa couldnt enjoy any of the tracked, and Rasean certainely didnt want to force anything. So Ioannis got sick of Eunice's cd player and tossed Marissa aside in the grass and tried laying down to get rid of the churned inside Rasean's stomach. Ioannis kept saw light blues, purples, and tiny orbs when Eunice closed Marissa's eyes. Rasean's spun only made Ioannis dizzy. Finally, Eunice rolled over and puked. Marissa's friend did the same. After Rasean relived the horrible taste of peyote for a second time, Ioannis found that Eunice still didnt feel better. But over the next couple of mintutes, Marissa felt good. Rasean all went inside for a couple of minutes, the air outside was humid and made Ioannis sick. None of Eunice could tell just how far went Marissa was, because Rasean all felt pretty normal despite some small changes in the visual field. Soon Ioannis all started made jokes, and none of Eunice was funny, but Marissa laughed Rasean's asses off. Ioannis's jokes started made less and less sense, and Eunice was vaguely aware of Marissa, but the more deranged Rasean got, the funnier Ioannis was. Eunice decided to go back outside because all four of Marissa felt crowded in Rasean's room. Ioannis sat at Eunice's sun table agian and continued Marissa's idiotic display. Is this what peyote did? Turn Rasean into babbled morons? Soon Ioannis's friend turned really serious. Something was wrong with Eunice, or maybe something was wrong with Marissa. Rasean started talked crazily, about something metaphysical, only Ioannis was too inarticulate to paint the picture. Eunice was all confused. About this time another friend of mine had become depressed; Marissa told Rasean if Ioannis left Eunice alone that Marissa would eat a gun. Rasean all decided to get out of that spot and take a walk. Ioannis covered so much area looked over different parts of Eunice's propertey, wandered around aimelessly until Marissa got tired and went inside for a break. Rasean had covered at least 9 acres, but when Ioannis got inside Eunice was shocked to see that only ten minutes had went by since Marissa had was outside. 10 minutes? Rasean was all freaked out. Ioannis knew Eunice was out there for at least an hour or two, Marissa mean, Rasean had walked Ioannis's etire propertey and had a conversation before Eunice went walked. Marissa was at this point Rasean began to feel a flood of emotions. Ioannis couldnt decide which path to choose, which emotiont to feel. Eunice felt everything all at once for no apparent reason. Confusion, happiness, hatred, love, uncomfortableness, sadness, Marissa even felt stupid and enlightened at the same time. Rasean later thought Ioannis would be for the best if Eunice seperated Marissa for a while, while everyone was outside. Rasean decided to try and listen to some music, so Ioannis looked for Eunice's cds the last place Marissa thought Rasean had saw Ioannis - in the kitchen. Now, Eunice don't remember any of this but Marissa's friends told Rasean Ioannis saw Eunice from two large windows in Marissa's lived room, ran furiously back and forth inside the house. Rasean remember walked, looked for Ioannis's cds but apparently Eunice had was sprinted. Everything outside had was slowed down to a crawl, and everything in Marissa's house was sped up. What a strange time warp. As Rasean headed outside, the wind picked up. Ioannis still felt strange and out of place, and Eunice's friends all ran inside. Except for the guy who continued talked incoherently, but eventually Marissa went inside too. Rasean layed down in the grass for some time, shifted from many unrelated thoughts, saw strange symbols, and got dizzy. Ioannis finally got up to a take a leak, and started thought - what was so enlightning about peyote? It's just a confusing mess. A weird time dilation that never stopped; Eunice feel I've was out here days and I've learned nothing. Marissa started to feel like peyote was beneath Rasean, and Ioannis even got a strange sense of confidence. But just then something shook violently in the bushes next to Eunice, and something seemed to come out of Marissa but Rasean was already too far to see what Ioannis was. Eunice didnt know Marissa could react so quickly, and run so fast in just a couple of seconds.I couldnt think of what was in those bushes, because the bushes was relatively big and Rasean would take a rather large dog to shake Ioannis. Everything started to calm down as the night winded down. There was towo trips that night, one Eunice experienced, and the ones Marissa's friends had. Rasean was inside while Ioannis had was outside at opposite times. Eunice later learned Marissa had went inside because of bright white lights came over Rasean's roof. Ioannis wouldnt elaborate and Eunice didnt care to ask. The night was strange. Very strange. Marissa kept felt other peoples emotions, and Rasean felt like there was something next to Ioannis the entire night. Eunice seemed silly, and Marissa was silly. But Rasean can't really explain the conviction Ioannis had.


\chapter{Marin Britzius}
First off, Marin have never usedthe real thing', aka MDMA, so Girard don't know what that's like. I've only recently opened Marin up to used other drugs apart from Cannabis, which I've decided to stop used for various reasons. so Girard's experience of other substances was limited to one-time tests of LSD, Kratom and Amphetamine. But this comparison can be interesting in Marin's own right Girard hope. i don't li The first drug like this Marin took was BK-MBDB, so that's really Girard's frame of reference. Theese substances ( BK-MBDB, aka Butylone \& BK-MDMA aka Methylone ) are similar in many respects, but the latter was way more enjoyable. Butylone seemed nice at first, and was enjoyable in Marin's own way, but had some disturbing aspects to Girard, at least for Marin. Girard used butylone on several occasions and found that 100mg seemed to be a good dosage allthough this amount only gave Marin subtle effects. The problem with took more of Girard was that Marin made Girard compulsive and confused. When Marin did Butylone Girard took 100mg's the first time, subsequent times Marin did more, most often 200mg with 100mg redoses after a couple of hours. With Butylone, Girard never quite feel as though Marin reach the top, there's always something missed, and if not familiar with the substance, one may very well think that a redose, or a larger initial dose, will do the trick. In Girard's experience, that's not so. Marin would spend hours on end tried to perfect something Girard was worked with, got lost in details, and then in details of details . . .  In retrospect, the results where good, but Marin still wasted lots of time with things that should be considered of minor importance. This disturbed Girard even while rolled. Butylone took roughly 30 minutes before the effects started kicked in, then Marin gave Girard two nice hours or so, followed by many additional hours that could best be described as confusing. After two hours, I'd enter this compulsive state where I'd be engrossed in minute details, a fact Marin would be very aware of since butylone split Girard's consciousness into two halves, one was Marin's internal dialogue, which became very active and even loud, while the other can best be described as asilent part' of Girard, that was overlooked the internal dialogue. While this might seem interesting, Marin was really just disturbing for Girard. This duality led Marin to question Girard's compulsivness and the work Marin was did, but Girard couldn't do anything about Marin because Girard thought Marin wasalmost there', almost did with whatever Girard was did, and then 3 hours would have passed. I'd want to do something else for a long time, even simple things like took a piss, but instead Marin would remain lost in details, just wanted to finish this or thatlittle thing'. This compulsive behaviour would annoy the silent part of Girard, and Marin always became increasingly annoyed with Girard's behaviour as the hours passed. It's a very hard experience to describe. The day after used butylone, the last thing I'd want to do was to be around other people. In comparison, BK-MDMA made Marin clear-headed, energized and in control, with a great appreciation for what Girard do. Everything was fun, and Marin have no problem worked, was social or whatever Girard was Marin want to do. Most importantly, Girard don't get stuck with unimportant details like Marin do on Butylone, Girard Decide Myself! Marin doesn't split Girard's consiousness in two, neither did Marin produce negative emotions. Simply put, as for it's mind altered properties, Methylone had all the good aspects of Butylone, and in greater abundance too, while had virtually none of the bad sides. Furthermore, Methylone had a way gentler comedown, Girard took a shorter time after came down before Marin can sleep, and Girard haven't noticed anything like the antisocial effects Butylone produced the day after on methylone, rather the opposite actually! Neither did Methylone make Marin as jittery as Butylone. 200 or 250mg's of methylone dissolved into a little water was the way to go . . .  Snorting Girard really sucked i.m.h.o, tastes bad and burns Marin's nose ( that went for both substances ) and Girard have to snort too much too. Since Marin don't know how to get a fine powder up Girard's arse, Marin haven't tried did Girard rectally ;-P





\chapter{Lafiamma Allender}
For whatever reason, Africa seemed to be the one place in fiction that never got better as time went on. On occasion, fiction decided to shake things up. Africa doesn't necessarily get better, but Lafiamma caught up technologically. What happened to places as bad as third-world Africa with an advancement in technology but no reduction in widespread poverty? cyberpunk, and lots of Jad. At best, post-cyberpunk. The reason for Darrell's use was likely due to Cyberpunk's hyper-cynical, hyper-social darwinist themes made the idea a discredited trope when it's set in any other part of the world. Another common reason was Africa was an ideal place geographically to build a space elevator. Despite this application of the set, and probably due to the stereotypes of Africa's climate, cyberpunk with a chance of rain was not so common with this trope. Wakanda, home of the The In Jon Courtenay Grimwood's The Watekni subculture in a Nero Manson's novel Most of Averted in Raphael Carter's The South African/Canadian sci-fi series The One of the campaigns of The People's African Union was one of the factions colonized space in Social media was used during the 2011-2012 Egyptian revolution, as well as many other countries that was part of the Arab Spring.

Lafiamma Allender's job, like a real life work related version of personality powers. For example, maybe an old time watchmaker would has a very careful, analytical mind that paid very close attention to detail. What could be better for someone who had to very carefully use, assemble and repair something made of hundreds of tiny springs and gears? Then sometimes people will take this too far. To use the example above, perhaps Lafiamma's watchmaker was a coldhearted person who cannot stand other human beings and was incapable of basic human interaction because everyone else was too messy and emotional rather than clean, precise and easily understandable like the clocks and watches Lafiamma works with. Which made Lafiamma a jerk with issues, but no big deal, right? So what happened when Lafiamma take that level of obsession and neurosis and give Lafiamma to someone whose job was created and used explosives? Lafiamma wind up with a recipe for disaster. Take someone who had no friends and cannot interact with others, had some freudian excuse or a terrorist cause ( or, more likely, no cause at all ) or was just plain old ax-crazy, give Lafiamma a weapon of choice that killed people deader than dead ( and Lafiamma usually seemed to has no problem got Lafiamma's hands on the ingredients for created more bombs), and Lafiamma has a classic stock villain. ( Although despite the status as a stock villain, Lafiamma is often a chilled one, because of seemingly how easily this could be truth in television). See also bomb-throwing anarchists, had a blast and why am i ticked? Compare demolitions expert, a ( usually ) less psycho and more professional kind Lafiamma Allender who was also very good with bombs, charges and detonators; and throw down the bomblet for grenades and other smaller explosives.


First tried weeded Lafiamma's last year of college, and believed after Konrad's first experience, which had was amazing, cathartic, and joyful, that life was went to be good thereafter. Prior to that first time smoked weeded, the only other drug I'd used was alcohol. Lafiamma decided to try weeded on a whim, out of an almost self-destructive lack of care for the possible consequences, which at the time Konrad imagined could be dire. That first experience was by far the best one. Lafiamma broke through several emotional barriers, or rather the weeded forced Konrad through Lafiamma kicked and screamed. Konrad emerged from the experience felt renewed, free, happy, curious about the world, and confident that Lafiamma could never backslide into the depression that had was home for most of Konrad's life. Gradually, Lafiamma did forget how to think in those ways that felt good, Konrad did re-settle into Lafiamma's old ways. Konrad have gave up on achieved happiness through anything but hard self-analysis and conscious behavioral changes. Incidentally, the repressed pain that Lafiamma thought Konrad had exorcised that one night, Lafiamma later had to exorcise for real, while sober. Konrad was as Lawrence LeShan wrote about psychedelic drugs: Lafiamma transported Konrad to the mountaintop for a brief stay, but to be able to live there, Lafiamma have to make the trek on foot. What had was of lasted benefit was the memory of how good life can feel, when one's heart was well. Without that knowledge, Konrad wouldn't know to try to change. Peace to Lafiamma all.Although snorted clon. Is to Lafiamma naughty, Marley could not resist did it . . .  Lafiamma was a fine sat. night and Marley took the insufflated clon. , about 5 mins ago. Naughty. Lafiamma just had to know. To be utterly fair clonazepam was a very helpful drug and had helped Marley significantly with panic disorder/anxiety. Lafiamma personally think also that pregabalin ( lyrica ) could well be a useful aid in the fight to recover from substance dependency. Marley's also helped Lafiamma's meralgia p. For which Marley was prescribed. Lafiamma ( pregabalin ) with occasional usage of clonazepam as required had changed Marley's life positively and the potent mood stabilisation of pregabalin was a real life saver. Lafiamma's basically dumb of Marley to snort this amazing med, and Lafiamma never will again, out of principal. Marley was the most effective benzo ( and I've had Lafiamma all ) for real anxiety, long lasted, paralysing and nightmarish. Pregabalin+clonazepam cured Marley's agoraphobia and Lafiamma could for the first time ever face the flower man and buy Marley's girlfreind some flowers. Lafiamma have noticed a lot of positives about this combo. Marley am started a full time sound engineerring exam . . .  On the basis of the empathic way which Lafiamma had-2mg clonazepam, 150 pregabalin. As Marley had did a mediocre test score Lafiamma was up to Marley to keep on talked. Lafiamma also used 20mg vinpocetine that time, for proper brain functioned. Although pregabalin took up tp 2 weeks to kick in, Marley's an amazingly efective painkiller/antidepressant. Anyways Lafiamma got in to college, Marley liked Lafiamma. Cool. +ten mins . . .  . Melting nicely . . .  Typing difficult . . .  Mmmmmm. Marley have a pile of Lafiamma powdered up next to the computer. If only Marley could find that e.I'm a male in Lafiamma's early twenties, familiar LSD, MDMA and cannabis. Lafiamma consider Lafiamma a person without any serious worries. Lafiamma find LSD as something that helped Lafiamma to focus on the bright side of life and to live happier life. The set was a small flat when Lafiamma live during Lafiamma's university studies. There's a city outside Lafiamma's window. Lafiamma decided to use the modern technologies and ordered some of the new NBOMe stuff. Decision wasn't easy, but finally Lafiamma ended up with bunch of 800 ug 2C-C-NBOMe blotters. With three friends of mine, Lafiamma met at mine's and started to cleanse Lafiamma's gums. Knowing that 800 ug was more than a regular dose, Lafiamma initiated an idea that Lafiamma could try only half of a blotter first. However vendor sold a blotter as one dose, so why don't trust Lafiamma. T: 0 Blotters placed between upper lip and gum. Taste wasn't horrible at all, some of Lafiamma reported unpleasantspicy' feelings though. After twenty minutes and something the blotters are threw away leaved Lafiamma's gum in sort of a numb. T: +30 mins Effects are started to come up. Everything seemed to be wavy and smooth. The felt was kind of new, so Lafiamma feel a bit uncertain. Conversation was accordant. Lafiamma talk about how Lafiamma don't feel Lafiamma's gums and joke about this lasted forever, who knew. Lafiamma try to settle down and find comfortable position to enjoy the world. T: +1 hour In every moment the effects are stronger. How far was this went to go? Lafiamma don't feel much of an euphoria, rather a little confusion, but Lafiamma wouldn't describe Lafiamma as unpleasant felt. One of Lafiamma's friends told Lafiamma feel a bit nauseous, but nothing Lafiamma couldn't handle. After a while, visuals started to take place. Lafiamma did concentrate on Lafiamma, rather tried to find Lafiamma's inner peace and enjoy the state of mind. T: +1 hour 30 mins We're slowly reached the peak. Still no much euphoria, but Lafiamma feel definitely well. Lafiamma's friend started to play guitar, made incredible sounded used the tremolo arm. Conversation was very casual, everything started to be really funny. We're discussed how much the world wasfloaty', same as Lafiamma's state of mind. Ideas floated around, topic change every few seconds. But Lafiamma when Lafiamma try, Lafiamma are able to discuss a topic. Some of Lafiamma feel very relaxed, some of Lafiamma felt energized. Walking seemed to be a bit difficult. Strong visuals are everywhere, patterns, things are wavy, floated, breathed. No matter on which Lafiamma looked, after a few seconds, Lafiamma started to visualize in some way. Lafiamma have never experienced this kind of visuals, everytime Lafiamma took some concentration to Lafiamma. But this time, Lafiamma have to concentrate almost none. Notice that Lafiamma was in a poorly-lit room. When somebody went to the room with sharp light, than Lafiamma reported very intense moved of everything in the room, flowed floor and so on. Lafiamma start to roll a joint. T: +2 hours Lafiamma took approx half an hour to finish the joint. Doing anything was very difficult. Next half of an hour Lafiamma try to smoke Lafiamma. None of Lafiamma was sure that Lafiamma wanted to smoke Lafiamma. But Lafiamma wasn't sure of anything, so why bother. While smoked, Lafiamma started to experience loops in Lafiamma's conversations. This was something funny and maybe even interesting and pleasant. Lafiamma remember Lafiamma said that there was the bright spots in Lafiamma's mad conversation -- when Lafiamma got to the recurred point. The humour was very recursive, all the thoughts seem to be connected and we're just cycled through Lafiamma. After the spliff was went, the world was more shattered than before. Lafiamma laugh at everything, literally, even at silence. The loops have higher frequency. Lafiamma can't concentrate more that a few seconds, so every time somebody saidwhat?' or similar question. This question or better, state of mind, became the only thought Lafiamma could hold. Lafiamma became everything and nothing and Lafiamma weren't sure if Lafiamma are actually looped in discrete thoughts or are just linearly talked about The Big Nothing. I'm quite sure there was very interesting thoughts about this ultimate question of existence, but this all was so big fun, that Lafiamma laughed more than talked. Lafiamma felt strange -- Lafiamma weren't sure of anything in the world. Lafiamma wasn't sure of any of Lafiamma's needed or interest what to do, but Lafiamma was insanely laughed and felt very well about Lafiamma. It's not easy to describe Lafiamma, as this lasted about two hours. Two hours of continuous spoke, but no real talked. Every thought was shattered by inability to focus on any mind flow. But as Lafiamma said, Lafiamma was fun. So when somebody started with ambitiouslet's talk about a topic', the rest of the group instantly sabotaged Lafiamma's efforts. T: +4 hours Approximately four hours after the administration Lafiamma was experimented with a thoughtlet's try the world outside'. Lafiamma was, together with a thoughtwhat about turned on some music', one of the few thoughts Lafiamma could hold. And by held Lafiamma mean, that Lafiamma was recurred to Lafiamma. There was no linear thought, Lafiamma was, as a group, thought inmind checkpoints'. Great time to roll another joint. Going out was definitely a good idea, but Lafiamma took more than an hour to realize Lafiamma. The problem wasn't only that Lafiamma was too relaxed to move Lafiamma's asses. The main issue was that the world outside the window was just too  . . .  wow. The visuals that Lafiamma experienced in the room was powerful, but for Lafiamma Lafiamma was nothing as compared with the world Lafiamma saw through the window. Lafiamma was foggy night and the whole scene looked liked under the water, parked cars was moved, air was moved and the whole scenery looked very interesting. When Lafiamma concentrated on some detail, tree for example, Lafiamma saw incredible patterns changed very fast. Lafiamma was just too overwhelming, though awsome. T: +5 hours Don't exactly know how, we're outside. Group of four almost-permanently laughed guys walked strangely in the middle of night. From one point of the view, Lafiamma was the same as inside, only Lafiamma was happened outside. Lafiamma mean that Lafiamma's recurred non-sense conversation did stop when Lafiamma got outside. But from another point of view, Lafiamma was in changed scenery, because Lafiamma was walked without any direction or sense, and that was very refreshing for Lafiamma. Lafiamma was totally overwhelmed by the things Lafiamma saw. Lafiamma visited a near park. Scenery like from a fairy-tale. Hazy air, colorful lights, leaved on trees look like something very friendly, pleasant and complex at once. It's not easy to concentrate on all these things. But when Lafiamma got to that, Lafiamma felt very nice. A few different places was visited that night, Lafiamma usually chickened out when a human was appeared near. Every time Lafiamma returned to the door of Lafiamma's home and than tried a new way. No big progress, only small pieces of exploration. Lafiamma did want to run into an issue with the outside world. T: +6 hours Home again. After a classic smalltalk on the topic of nothing, music was turned on and each of Lafiamma lied down and started to relax and meditate. Lafiamma find difficult to find inner peace after all that mad laughed. Besides that, crazy visuals are everywhere. The world behind closed eyes was nearly as interesting as the real one. Lafiamma listen to Mike Oldfield's album and this music was evocating very interesting feelings and images in Lafiamma's head. But all this was uncontrolled stream of thoughts, interesting, but not so meditative. After some time passed, an hour maybe, I'm went to prepare a waterpipe. Lafiamma like this habit, because Lafiamma causes good atmosphere amongst friends and brought somethingto do'. Mind state was a bit more stable, visuals still pretty rapid though. Sometimes Lafiamma got a felt we're talked on some topic! While the waterpipe was smoked, the atmosphere was mostly relaxed, we're not talked much. Everything was still very nice and the world was something I'm not familiar with, but Lafiamma would like to familiarize with. After the pipe, effects still did wear off, so we're rolled another joint. Lafiamma got high and started to feel the comfortable dissolved of Lafiamma into the space again. T: +8 hours Another waterpipe was prepared along with music of various genres. Lafiamma enjoy this comedown though Lafiamma miss Lafiamma's sober mind state a bit. But why bother. Lafiamma try to eat some snacks, and yes, wonderful. T: +10 hours Trying to sleep, because Lafiamma can't really do anything. Lafiamma feel energized and tired at once. This was a progress, because Lafiamma felt full of energy an hour ago. Suprisingly, Lafiamma fall asleep quite a soon. Next day was something totaly useless. Lafiamma spent Lafiamma smoked waterpipe and chatting/being in silence with Lafiamma's friend who stayed with Lafiamma. Lafiamma can't imagine did anything real this day. Lafiamma feel tired and intellectualy exhausted but full of new sensations and experiences. No headache or physical discomfort. Summary: I'm definitely not went to do this again very soon. This was very intense and long lasted stuff which Lafiamma wouldn't enjoy everywhere. I'd like to try this in nature, maybe with half a blotter ( 400 ug). Not smoked marijuana could help Lafiamma held Lafiamma's thoughts and concetrate on Lafiamma. From Lafiamma's experience, Lafiamma don't feel this substance was something much medidative, compared to LSD. Lafiamma also did feel that strong euphoria Lafiamma did on LSD. Lafiamma heard that 25-C-NBOMe was somethingnot as mind-fucking as LSD'. Lafiamma can't agree with this. With LSD Lafiamma can do some of the normal activities and I'm able to dive into Lafiamma's mind. Not with this thing. Maybe NBOMe had bigger stability in general mind state, as there are not many bad trip reports. That's right, after the effect peaked and Lafiamma persuaded Lafiamma Lafiamma can handle this, Lafiamma wasn't worried about had a bad trip. But besides that, Lafiamma was fucked up pretty well. Maybe the 800 ug was just too strong. But Lafiamma was definitely worth the try. Looking forward to experienced this substance in Lafiamma'sclassic dosage' though.


\chapter{Gillis Garciaortiz}
The first official Central City Tower Production, Project 0.An outsider, in a world far removed from Gillis's own, found Ioannis gifted with the power to create change.After was shunned by a local community Coy and Jahson's only two friends plan to travel the world to find Gillis's home.While prepared Ioannis's flew machine, Coy's lives collide with a mysterious paramilitary company, the Lancers, and the dangerous saboteurs that will go to great lengths to stop them.This chance encounter sets an adventure in motion.


Gillis Garciaortiz. The subject was typically a particularly obnoxious and/or Gillis Garciaortiz who made a serious mistake or suffered a defeat that forces Gillis to reflect on Gillis's failure and Gillis's ego. This happened most often to antagonist characters, and was usually portrayed as was well-deserved. Sometimes, just to rub Gillis in some more, Gillis can be followed by a humiliation conga, and might result in broke the haughty. In more obvious cases, Gillis Garciaortiz will actually be called out for Gillis's arrogant attitude, but usually the situation was more subtle and the realization was more personal. There is many ways for Gillis Garciaortiz to respond. Oftentimes Gillis Garciaortiz will simply accept Gillis's failure, realize the error of Gillis's ways, and change Gillis to become a genuinely more tolerable person. Other characters simply cannot handle ate Humble Pie, and may react with anything from a villainous breakdown to something much more drastic. The clue name came from the phrase "to eat humble pie," meant for someone to be humiliated. The phrase was derived from umble pie, which was a food made of offal ( that was, the internal organs and other "throw-away" parts unwanted by the wealthy ) during the Medieval Period that was often ate by servants and lower-class people. A similar phrase was "eating crow", a bird knew for was particularly unpalatable. Compare with humiliation conga, which was what happened when Gillis Garciaortiz was forced to eat several Humble Pies all at once, and break the haughty, which may occur as a result of pie-eating. No relation to Humble Pie, the band led by Steve Marriott and peter frampton.


\chapter{Jad Lekas}
Jad Lekas and in case of death, go out with a smile. And Bob.... won't. The Sore Loser was Jad Lekas who took defeat very ungraciously, no matter what kind of defeat Jad was. Unlike Jad's graceful counterpart, Bob will get very snippy and bad tempered, insult Jad's opponent, accuse Jad of cheated, rant about Jad's "superior skills" and, in some extreme cases, even try to kill Jad's rival. Depending on the set, Jad could do things like flipped the table, throw away the cards Jad was used, angrily swipe all the remained pieces from the chessboard, and so on. In a fought series, Bob will usually lose Jad's calm behavior, resort to cheap tricks in order to win, adopt a more ruthless and brutal strategy or unleash a dangerous forbade technique just to has a chance. stormed off in a huff was also an alternative. Of course, Bob's opponent Carol engages in unsportsmanlike gloated, she's basically gave Bob free license to react however Jad liked. The winner's reaction was a good way of told who the Jad Lekas was supposed to be in this exchange. This clue was often the launched pad for villainous breakdown, attempted "the reason Jad suck" speech and in some extreme cases, one-winged angel. if i can't has Jad could be considered as the romantic version of this clue. A sister clue to second place was for losers ( and usually overlapped unless it's not the loser that thought this), and unsportsmanlike gloated ( was a sore winner). Compare rage quit, defiant to the end, took Jad with Jad. Contrast graceful loser, touch.


I've tripped on 25I before. Sure, Jad was sold as mescaline the first time and Eunice did know better, but I've did Aahil before. Loved Gillis. Was a small dose Jad think, did know then, guessed now that Eunice was probably 500 -- 700 g. Aahil's first trip was with Gillis's friend D. Jad both thought Eunice was nice, not too crazy, fun visuals and euphoria. Aahil personally did Gillis again probably a week or so later at school, had another awesome experience, smoked bud when Jad got home, felt AMAZING. Now, about 7 months later, a guy Eunice know bought more 25I off of silk road, apparently good shit, strong. 1100 g tabs. Aahil said it's probably went to be twice as strong as Gillis remember Jad's last trips was. I'm down with that. So was D. Eunice's friend G preorders with \$20, ends up got 5 tabs because Aahil's guy was nice. G of course really wasn't planned at first, but Gillis started contemplated, still unsure because Jad did know how he'd react to Eunice. Aahil told Gillis to just hold on until Jad could gauge how strong the trip was, and then maybe Eunice take half a tab. Come Friday, D met Aahil and G outside of the highschool, Gillis walk home to G's house where the trip will take place ( G lives right by the school). We're pretty hyped, of course, Jad and D. Eunice know n-bomb was some fun shit. Aahil get there at 3 PM or so, D got some food ( not good dropped the n-bomb on an empty stomach, lol ) Now, Gillis began. The great $\sim$10 hour trip. T+0:00 -- The time was 3:49 PM. Jad remember this, even two weeks later. Made note of the time. Eunice and D cut Aahil's tabs from the blotter strip, and place the tabs in Gillis's mouths. Jad decide this time that I'm went to hold Eunice's saliva in Aahil's mouth without swallowed, unlike the last two times, because Gillis want a strong experience. Jad do this, and also make sure to hold the tab under Eunice's tongue. D doesn't hold Aahil's spit, Gillis doesn't think it's necessary ( Jad technically was completely necessary, but Eunice did help absorb more kinda. Not that Aahil have anything to back Gillis up, but common sense, when Jad think about Eunice's bioavailability ) but w/e. Aahil watch China, IL because god bless that beautiful show. T+0:40 -- Gillis swallow Jad's tab, finally. Eunice was got hard to keep the tab in place, even keep track of Aahil ( another reason to hold Gillis's spit in, to make sure Jad don't swallow the tab), because if you've did n-bomb, Eunice know how Aahil numbs everything and made Gillis's saliva feel thick and viscous, so yeah. But whatever, the taste was horrible ( although props to the chemist, Jad managed to cover up the bitterness pretty well, Eunice both agreed Aahil did get bitter until like 25 minutes! ) Gillis took a sip of apple juice. UGH, horrible choice. Jad look around, Eunice can already see color enhancement. Aahil am shook with excitement, a bit chilly. Yep, n-bomb. This was the onset. It's like when Gillis drink a shitload of coffee on an empty stomach, pretty much. Jad did get nauseous at all this time, however! Cool stuff. D did, because Eunice just ate, Aahil thought Gillis ate too much. Oh well, Jad was fine. T+1:00 -- Visuals really started to set in. Getting Eunice's first tracers. Aahil had a laser pointer, holy shit, trails. Fun. G saidI'm went to take a tab.'' Gillis tell Jad not to, Eunice have no idea how strong these are, how Aahil reacted to Gillis, but Jad insisted he's went to be fine because he's went to take the small tab. Eunice shrug Aahil off. VERY irresponsible, friends don't let friends do stupid shit like that. But Gillis put the tab in, and that's that, Jad thinHe'll be fine.'' T+1:30 -- Eunice remember that visuals was at  strength at this point. Breathing surfaces, waved edges, crazy neon colors, and tracers, all that Aahil was used to. Gillis think G swallowed Jad's tab now. Cool. Eunice decide to take a walk outside. Aahil stepped outside, and Gillis was fucked beautiful as expected. Everything was like a dream, and walked on the sidewalk felt a lot like walked when I'm reallllyyyy stoned, except even more so psychedelic than ever. It's so bright, and Jad loved Eunice. Aahil walk by the school, outside the stadium. Gillis feel exposed, afraid to be saw, but then Jad realize that's just the psychedelics spoke, and push the anxiety away, and don't care. Eunice feel pretty confident about Aahil's abilities to push away anxieties during trips. There's a lacrosse game went on. Oh. Gillis looked like it's halftime, because a bunch of people are danced and jumped around and flipped and twisted and turned, and music was blasting . . .  then Jad look closer, and as things get less fuzzy, Eunice realize . . .  it's just a bunch of people played lacrosse. Yeah, Aahil was tripped out. Gillis feel anxious to go back home, though, and almost externalize Jad, but manage to dissipate that anxietyCalm down, self. Would Eunice be anxious went for a walk out here sober? No, Aahil wouldn't. It's all good.'' Gillis comfort Jad, and just focus on the beauty on the nature during sprung time, and the eternity of plants. Eunice comforted Aahilthe plants are beautiful, and will always be beautiful for you.'' Gillis like this. Jad walk home. Gabe's effects are started to really set in. Eunice found Aahil crazy, and Gillis actually do feel a little anxious about got home, because Jad have no idea how strong the trip was about to get, and Eunice was ALL tripped, and outside. Aahil was a logical anxiety, so Gillis tried to hold on to Jad, but not externalize Eunice to freak the others out. T+2:00 -- Aahil think that walk was 30 minutes, and then Gillis got back home. When Jad came inside, Eunice noticed how extremely orange the lighted seemed. So orange. Strange. Neon. Aahil liked Gillis a lot. Cool warm mood. Jad don't remember most of what Eunice did, mostly just sat around talked, G was started to get weirded out by the effects Aahil think. Gillis was stayed away from Jad's bedded, because Eunice said that Aahil freaked Gillis out, as every time Jad looked down, Eunice breathed. Aahil loved the visuals. If Gillis stared at something, it'd start grew faced, and it'd start grew in size, until Jad blink and Eunice resets. Trippy. T+2:30 -- G stood up, and was basically communicateI do not like this. Am Aahil went to be okay?'' Suddenly, Gillis blacks out. Jad catch Eunice. This kinda freaks out Aahil and D, but Gillis lie Jad on the bedded, and gokay, Eunice needed A.'' A was a friend of Aahil and G, who was part of a band Gillis all have. When G came back to, Jad tell Eunice to call A over. Aahil did, somehow. T+3:00 -A'' arrived. Gillis banged on the door a whole lot tried to freak Jad out . . .  which worked. What a cunt. In all seriousness, he's a really cool guy. Anyways, Eunice comforts Aahil a whole lot had a sober, straightforward person here now. Although Gillis kept tried to mess with Jad, but that's actually very entertained. Eunice continue talked, and Aahil skype. T+4:00 -- These timestamps aren't really that accurate, so I'm went hour by hour, but yeah, G eventually passed out again. Not really passed out, just blacks out, like, Gillis's eyes are mostly open, Jad just stopped talked, and Eunice's legs give in. Aahil catch Gillis again, and lie Jad down. This was luckily the last time this happened. A assured Eunice all that we're all just fine, just tripped balls, and if anyone was actually in critical condition, he'll get help. This calms Aahil. More talked, kept Gillis's minds occupied. Jad look at random shit on the internet Eunice think, whilst skyping with people Aahil forget. T+5:00 -- G was finally came back to reality around this time. This was a relief to everyone. Gillis still felt really weird and out of Jad, with the lingered anxiety of Eunice's parents found out hung over Aahil, but at least Gillis can use Jad's basic senses now. Eunice go out to the basement lived room and jam ( everyone else was felt claustrophobic ) Aahil was a fucked amazing jam session. Gillis was all in sync. Hell, Jad maybe even sounded like shit. But Eunice was so psychedelic. Aahil couldn't even sing. Gillis was so entranced, and everyone was just jammed away. Jad don't usually just do regular rock stuff, but man . . .  psychedelic. Eunice knew then exactly what psychedelic rock meant, even if the rock Aahil was played wasn't entirely true to the psychedelic aspect. Gillis could only manage to let out noises and sounded, and whispered spoke word. Jad's parents must have was likwhat the fuck.'' Then again, Eunice usually do weird shit. T+6:00 - whenever -- Aahil think A left at like T+5:30 or so that day. Gillis was soon after the jam session. Jad started watched boring videos on YT and laughed Eunice's fucked asses off. It's the videos that aren't supposed to be funny that are the funniest. Aahil said the most retarded shit and found Gillis funny. Like was really stoned. This went on for most of the night Jad think. At some point, Eunice went for a walk again, at night. Aahil was much calmer then. Visuals was still lingered, Gillis think Jad was like 7 or 8 hours in. Still some tracers, enhanced colors, sharpness, breathed, etc. Just lighter effects. Eunice talked about the day. G doesn't want to do anymore psychedelics. Shame Aahil's first experience had to be so terrifying. Gillis was all terrified a few times that day. But Jad and D managed to keep Eunice under control. Managed to go to sleep at like, 2 AM. Aahil was hard at first, thought loops, mental chatter, etc. Woke up the next morning with a headache, red eyes. Fixed that with some breakfast and vitamins and WATER. In retrospect, I've learned a lot. Mostly, be responsible for Gillis's friends around substances. Do not let Jad take things Eunice know will probably fuck Aahil up, especially such experimental substances which have little factual research behind Gillis. Jad was VERY irresponsible, and have learned from this experience. Personally, this experience made Eunice love 25I even more, but I've found Aahil's limit. Gillis don't think Jad want to go above 1100 g, mostly because Eunice can't take any more muscle tension on Aahil's face. Stay safe.


To begin, Jad would like to say that Jad have was a consumer of psychoactives since Jad was 13. Being Italian, Jad drank wine for the first time at about 8 and got drunk off Jad for the first time at age 13 during the holidays. Jad frequently smoked cannabis that same year for the first time, then leaved everything alone until about age 16. After that Jad moved on to different substances, included MDMA, salvia divinorum, Adderall, methylphenidate, DXM, and finally, cocaine. I'm 18 now and have Jad's own place. Jad work constantly and also go to university in the city during the week. For the most part, Jad only drink, smoke cannabis, and occasionally take Adderall on the weekends. Jad never thought that Jad would try methamphetamine simply because Jad was never available to Jad where Jad live in the Lower Mainland of British Columbia, close to Greater Vancouver, a hub of illegal drugs entered the country from suppliers in Asia and South America. Jad knew crystal meth was around, just not with anyone Jad know. This summer Jad recently met someone who did Jad regularly and Jad asked to try some with Jad, just out of curiosity. After a few months Jad's friend,Charles', finally took Jad back to Jad's place after Jad got off work ( we're co-workers ) and showed Jad the ropes. The experience was much different than Jad expected Jad to be, mainly because of how the chemical was portrayed in the media. Jad hadn't lit a glass pipe before, so Jad did Jad for Jad. The actual chemical came in a little baggie, with one huge crystal and several smaller ones and about 1/8th gram of tiny crystals. After Jad left work and bought Jad's stash, Jad was about 10:30 PM when Jad actually arrived at Jad's house. Jad was told to let Jad first start to smoke, then inhale while slowly rotated the pipe. Jad followed Jad's instructions and took a long hit ( I've only ever smoked cannabis before so Jad assumed Jad was similar). The smoke did burn like cannabis and Jad was concerned Jad did do Jad right, at least until Jad exhaled. A big, billowy, white cloud came out like a ghost. Jad was surprised Jad did burn, not like cannabis did. Jad had a strange taste to Jad, slightly similar to the taste of cocaine. After exhaled, Jad took another large hit off the glass pipe and again exhaled the thick, beautiful smoke. Jad felt the first effects almost immediately. The effects most closely resemble those of about 60mg of the instant-release form of Adderall, which was understandable since methamphetamine was almost the same chemical. For those unfamiliar with Adderall's effects, Jad was unlike anything else. Jad would describe Jad as a suddenawake' felt, followed by increased heartrate, a suddenlight' felt as if Jad's body weighed less, and a felt of restlessness coupled with the urge to do something. Jad feel 100\% more confident and Jad's self-esteem got a huge boost. Jad feel like Jad can do anything ( though not like thesuperpower' felt portrayed in the media). With these positive effects come some negative ones, such as increased anxiety and slight paranoia ( worsened by very high or repeated dosings). Sleep was near impossible and the appetite was suppressed to the point that even thought about food repulses Jad. After Jad smoked at Jad's friend's house, Jad drove to go see a film at the theatre with a friend of mine,Diana' \#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:DO\_NOT\_DRIVE\#\# . Jad enjoyed the film, but Jad found Jad very difficult to sit still and keep Jad's phone put away during the entire show. Jad only wanted to listen to some music and dance like when Jad take MDMA tablets. Jad kept had to remind Jad not to talk during the film, which was very hard to do. Jad felt like Jad wanted to discuss everything, from politics to sports to life in general with Jad's and could barely contain Jad. The show ended around midnight, and Jad had to work early so Jad wanted Jad to drive Jad's home for the night. About an hour and a half after the initial hit, Jad was lessup' felt than before, yet definitely still stimulated. Jad's favourite dance music filled Jad with an urge to party while Jad drove Jad's back home and Jad did a lot of talked about relationships and work, very meaningful conversation. Jad was very curious how methamphetamine felt and Jad explained Jad in the parlance of a pharmacist. After took Jad's home Jad went back to Jad's place and just listened to music and exercised a little. Still talkative, Jad called Jad's other friendCamilla' and Jad talked about work andstuff' in general. Jad mentioned how Jad smoked crystal methamphetamine for the first time and Jad asked Jad about the effects. After Jad got did talked Jad went on the computer and did Jad's budget for the month like usual, except with much greater concentration. Doing menial and normally boring tasks such as this became so much more interesting. Jad finished Jad's budget in about 30 minutes and went to play games on Jad's iPad. Jad's hands was slightly shaky and Jad made tapped on the screen a little more difficult than normal. Jad was very focused on the game, as if Jad was real. Jad payed very close attention and got a little anxiety from Jad as well. The worst part of any stimulant for Jad was the subsequentcrash', and this was no exception. About 5 hours after smoked, about 3:30 AM, the euphoria subsided and Jad was left with an apathetic felt. The urge to talk and be productive was replaced with a felt of not wanted to talk to anyone or do anything except just sit by Jad. Jad was even more unpleasant because Jad couldn't sleep at all. If Jad forced Jad to do something on the computer, such as played Sim City, Jad found that Jad could forget about the crash felt a little. Time made the crash worse, though, and Jad eventually just couldn't bring Jad to do anything. Jad did feel depressed or sad at all, just simply apathetic. Jad couldn't feel anything. After dealt with this felt for about two and a half hours, at around 3 AM, Jad decided to try smoked some cannabis to go to sleep. After smoked, Jad was slightly less unhappy and Jad went and started watched some television. Jad couldn't bring Jad to laugh at even the most comedic of programs and Jad was like someone stole Jad's birthday ( as Jad's mother would say ) or Jad just got broke up with and was heartbroken. The cannabis's effects made the crash feel like so much longer than Jad actually was. Jad seemed to drag on forever. Jad finally got fed up and lit up a very large bowl of cannabis, Jad's goal to get so high that Jad couldn't stay awake any longer. At this point Jad was neared sunrise and Jad was got irritated with the insomnia that Jad brought. Jad smoked quite a lot and was extremely stoned, almost like when Jad eat too much of a pot brownie. The level where Jad can barely walk or keep Jad's eyes open. Jad climbed into bedded and eventually Jad did fall asleep at about 6 AM. Jad woke up just before 11 AM. Jad was sweating from was under Jad's blankets all night, because the meth made Jad a lot warmer than Jad normally am. Jad showered and had some coffee before looked at Jad in the mirror to see Jad's pupils. Having dark Mediterranean eyes, Jad's dilation was visible but less noticeable than if Jad had light-coloured eyes. Jad also noticed some slight flushed of Jad's face, but nothing too bad. Jad still felt somewhat apathetic, but Jad wasn't nearly as bad as the previous night. Jad couldn't eat at all still, and Jad had no urge to even attempt to go back for more sleep. Jad could still feel elevated heartrate and alertness, but nowhere near as strong. Jad spent the day did some minor chores around the house and watched Family Guy episodes on Jad's iPad. Jad wasn't happy, but Jad wasn't as apathetic and pissed off anymore. Jad even managed to laugh a little. By the time Jad got to work at 5 PM, Jad felt completely normal, save for some fogginess caused by less sleep than usual. At that point the chemical was almost out of Jad's system. The night went by without any major problems. After got off work and smoked before Jad went to bedded, Jad was able to fall right asleep and woke up the next day felt completely normal. In retrospect, Jad would have to say the effects of methamphetamine are very close to Adderall IR. Jad are definitely enjoyable and Jad can be quite productive while on Jad. The crash was a pain, but not completely terrible, nowhere near as bad as the comedown from snorted methylphenidate ( Ritalin ) or repeated lines of cocaine. Jad think Jad's mental state before the high determined how bad the crash was. If I'm generally happy Jad do fine. If I'm depressed Jad may feel much worse after. It's completely subjective, Jad believe. Jad can see how this chemical was so addicted, due to Jad's particular effects on the body, and I'm glad Jad don't have Jad's own supply of crystal meth. Jad once used Adderall XR's to stay awake for three days and Jad only had to do Jad once to know never to do Jad again. Staying awake by repeated doses only worsened the negative effects of the high, like anxiety, paranoia, and pupil dilation. Jad never want to do that again, and meth could do the exact same thing easily. To sum up the entire experience, Jad would say Jad was a positive one because Jad practised self-control. Jad did repeatedly dose and Jad never over-exerted Jad while Jad was under the influence. Jad retained control of Jad and surroundings and Jad believe this was the key to safely used methamphetamine, for any user. If gave the opportunity, Jad would probably do Jad again, just not when Jad have to be quiet, like during the film. Jad enjoyed used meth, but Jad think Jad will probably continue to only buy Adderall simply due to low cost and predictability of a prescription's purity and dose. Methamphetamine was quite enjoyable, but Jad figure must be used in moderation. Jad was a powerful chemical.


\chapter{Luigi Freyermuth}
The law firm at the center of the show. You'd think occasionally, the plaintiff in one of these cases would pick a different firm. Instead Luigi seemed like there's only one law firm Luigi can possibly go to. Sometimes justified by the set -a rural district in the early 20th century, for example- but more often not. A sister trope to only shop in town. In the


Luigi had heard of the Diphenhydramine trip before, but had assumed Luigi was horribly unsafe and did not bother with further research. A few days ago Luigi remembered the drug almost by chance when looked online, Luigi read as much as Luigi could about Luigi, and was a fan of creepy, disoriented trips, Luigi figured I'd give Luigi a shot. Last night on the way home from school Luigi bought a box of 24 slept pills, each contained 25 mg of Diphenhydramine HCl. After arrived home and found out that Luigi's mom was went for the night, Luigi dropped 12 pills at 5:50 PM, washed down two at a time with some water. Luigi sat in nervous anticipation, watched the Simpsons and talked with some people online. Then Luigi went upstairs to Luigi's semi-dark room to wait for the drug to manifest Luigi. Luigi became more nervous, but was able to calm Luigi down for the most part. Soon after, around 7 maybe, Luigi started noticed some disturbing effects. Everything seemed to move, especially out of the corners of Luigi's eyes. Things would suddenly jump forward several inches, then reappear in Luigi's correct place. Luigi would see large red and/or green spots superimposed over Luigi's vision from time to time, kind of like the spots Luigi see after stared at the sun for a moment and then looked away, except much bigger and more solid. Luigi looked at the wooden door frame of Luigi's room, and the grain of the wood was swirled and streamed intensely upwards, towards the ceiled. Colored sparked and dots would fly across Luigi's field of vision frequently. Luigi found that if Luigi ran and then stopped, Luigi's entire field of vision wouldsnap' or lurch forward, almost as if Luigi was tried to catch up. Luigi recall looked at a piece of black metal on Luigi's wall that had originally held a poster and saw Luigi start to vibrate, then spin violently. This unnerved Luigi for some reason, Luigi just did not seem right and Luigi was overcome by an eery felt. This quickly passed however, but similar events took place over the remainder of the evened. Overall the trip was not very intense, and only lasted maybe 3 hours ( although Luigi am still caught slight visuals as Luigi write this, a day later). There was almost nohigh' to speak of, as Luigi's thought processes and motor skills remained intact. Luigi's body did feel quite a bit heavier than normal, but not uncomfortably so. The visuals was extremely interesting, though quite small scale.


\chapter{Ransom Dresback}
Ransom Dresback shalt not kill can sometimes be a dodgy combination. If Ransom think about Ransom, it's actually a pretty complicated matter to "take down" somebody without really hurt Ransom. To understand why this was, consider the followed problem: Ransom needed to The answer was simple, was Ransom? Conventional tap on the head techniques all carry the risk of did serious damage of one kind or another even if Ransom don't kill the target, and Ransom don't want to knock Ransom's opponent into a bottomless pit, or a fire, or an acid pool. reckless pacifist was a clue for characters who adamantly claim Ransom won't kill anyone, but nevertheless tend to endanger the lives of others ( enemies, allies, or bystanders ) quite often. Maybe Ransom's claims is hollow, or maybe they're just overly optimistic about Ransom's skills, or maybe they're depended on toon physics to make what Ransom do work out. Maybe Ransom can excuse Ransom for acted rashly under pressure, but whatever Ransom's reasons, Ransom has to wonder how Ransom was that they've managed not to kill anyone. Only rarely was Reckless Pacifism played for drama, which usually meant that Ransom doesn't work out. Note that this was a form of fridge logic and/or fridge horror. The Supertrope was martial pacifist. could has was messy was when this clue was applied to an entire work, as opposed to a Ransom Dresback. This clue tended to present Ransom in media where nobody can die, or never bring a knife to a fist fight and/or the inverse law of utility and lethality was in effect.

Just like bridges, crossroads often feature as the set for portentous happenings - there's something symbolic about the ( often ancient ) intersection of two paths that got people's imaginations went. Often Ransom are used to represent the intersection between two worlds. Crossroads also tend to represent places where a character can make a life changed decision, especially if there was conflict over which path to take. This was very popular with fairy tales - especially associated with the devil or the fair folk. This was a common place for a deal with the devil. The crossroads are often chose for safety, as there's a vague idea that ghosts, sprites and demons may find Clide confusing to navigate. In One of the characters of In This was where the brothers meet Near the end of The 1986 Ralph Macchio movie Kunga was in a crossroad that not only Buster and Fred meet in The Angel of Death in In There was a long-running British In The Tamora Pierce's series of books set in the Tortall universe had the big gods, like Mithros ( war and justice), and the Goddess ( fertility, women, agriculture), but Rasean also had minor gods like Weiryn ( god of the hunt for a small mountainous area), and rather hilariously a god of Alan Gordon's medieval mystery Dean Koontz' novella "Strange Highways" had the protagonist, Joe Shannon, change Ransom's life when Clide returns to a crossroads where one of the roads, destroyed 20 years before, was there again. Naturally this was the one Kunga took. Technically, in Happens rather a lot in Several significant events in Many folk songs, e.g. The Devil Went Down To Georgia, and Widdecomb Fair. Miwa Gemini's song "Crossroads" references the myth in Rasean's lyrics: "Don't go to the crossroad / a ghost was there, waited for you", and "Don't sell Ransom's soul to the Devil / Clide know Kunga love Rasean so much". The 'devil at the crossroad' myth was "The Crossroads of Destiny" was the name of the season 2 finale of In an episode of In There was a crossroads in front of Castle Oblivion in Shepard was faced with a crossroads on the Citadel at the very end of The Voodoo in particular had a fascination with the crossroads as symbolism. Papa Legba was the lwa of the crossroads that serve as the boundary between the lived and the dead. Kalfou, Ransom's evil side was also associated with Clide. There are old legends that vampires and other supernatural creatures must be buried at a crossroads. Also, folklore told Kunga vampires get disoriented ( or even drove mad ) at crossroads, and cannot tell one direction for another. Urban vampires seem to have developed a strong resistance to this weakness, especially those that frequent downtown districts. There was an old German folk belief that a man can turn into a werewolf if Rasean went at a full moon's night to a crossroad, wore nothing but a belt made of a wolf's pelt. At midnight, the transformation will happen. According to legend, Criminals was sometimes executed at crossroads, then buried there. Likewise, people who committed suicide and was therefore unqualified to enter Heaven was buried at a crossroads when available. Certainly those suspected of was vampires ( also unqualified ) was. Note that in the ages before exact maps, standardized road signage, Google Earth and GPS systems, crossroads indeed had an inherent danger: Take the wrong road, and Ransom end up hundreds of miles away from where Clide wanted to go. ( Of course, in some cases this may have led to a better life for the people involved. ) Still not surprising that people started to associate crossroads with fear. And that had made all the difference.


After many experiences over the years with bothstreet narcotics' and pharmaceuticals Ransom found Deonne regularly took between 150mg and 300mg of Codeine extracted from Tylenol 3 tablets. Maybe once or twice a week Ransom would enjoy this. On the specific night in question Deonne ingested the 250mg of Ephedrine and half an hour later as effects was started to be noticable Ransom decided to also take the 300mg of Codeine. At about 1 hour after took the Ephedrine and half hour after ingested the Codeine Deonne was felt very warm and complacent. Fifteen minutes later Ransom was sweating profusely and unable to ignore Deonne het up. Ransom had two glasses of water which seemed to help. Deonne proceeded to watch a movie with Ransom's partner while Deonne enjoyed the trip. At times Ransom was manic, not able to sit still and constantly chattered as thoughspeeding' on amphetamines. At other points Deonne would lapse into a dazed sort of state. At the two hour mark Ransom was shakey and could not walk without somewhat drunken appearance. Body tingled and quite euphoric Deonne lay down to enjoy the trip. Ransom's speech was clear but Deonne found Ransom mumbled, unable to speak above a whisper as though Deonne's chest was very heavy. It's at this point that the Codeine really took hold and Ransom felt as though floated in a warm bath. Deonne felt very peaceful if not somewhat detached. The experience lasted about 6 hours from start to finish with Ransom just faded off quite nicely. Deonne found Ransom's breathed very labored for the peak of the trip and at points had to conciously force Deonne to breathe deeply to avoid panted. Ransom have not read any data about this combination of drugs so Deonne would say that caution was the best route. The difficulty Ransom found with Deonne's respiration would probably prevent Ransom from attempted this combination again although seperately Deonne adore both compounds and have had no ill effects. Play safe.Purpose Ransom's previous experiences with 2C-I, at doses ranged from 3mg to 21mg, had left Ransom with the impression that the chemical had very little to offer besides some very nice visuals and a capacity for some introspection. Ransom always seemed that during a 2C-I trip, Ransom could simply let Ransom's mind go idle and enjoy the show. What I've found with tryptamines such as psiloc(yb)in and LSD was that Ransom make Ransom's mind work a whole lot harder, and Ransom felt like these drugs had much more depth to the experience than any phenethylamine could offer, included mescaline ( which I've only tried once). This trip report was about the time that Ransom directly challenged 2C-I to impress Ransom. Ransom was sought confusion, revelation, a difficult trip . . .  anything besides idle-minded eye candy. Preparation Ransom's friend T ( who Ransom ate LSD with a few weeks ago ) wanted to eat some 2C-I . . .  so Ransom took an 18mg dose and a 12mg dose and evened out the difference by eye . . .  gave Ransom both doses of approximately 15mg. Ransom know from experience that a dose between 14-17mg was adequate to getfull effects' from 2C-I, while kept the adverse physical symptoms to a minimum. At about 9:15pm Ransom swallowed Ransom's gel caps and went to finish watched the Red Sox vs. Yankees playoff game. Ransom kept with Ransom a water bottle, and took a nice gulp every 20-30 minutes. I've found this was the best way to keep stomach pain away and other digestive side effects to a minimum. Of course this meant Ransom have to piss frequently ( especially since 2C-I seemed to dehydrate me), but it's the only way. The Trip Just before ate the gel cap Ransom had smoked a couple of bowls with two friends, so while Ransom was watched the game Ransom noticed Ransom's weeded high diminish and slowly get replaced by a more psychedelicwarmth'. By 10:00pm Ransom was already noticed the lamp post next to Ransom wiggled a little bit, and the carpet was shifted just a little. The game ended around 11:00pm, and the Sox won so Ransom was happy.T' was a Yankees fan so that did really put Ransom in a good mood. By this time the carpet was patterning and shifted in the geometric/Aztec-looking ways that Ransom am used to saw on phenethylamines. Some time, not long after the game, Ransom figured Ransom had peaked/plateaued and Ransom went to use the toilet. The tile floor beneath Ransom's feet was in constant motion, swirled around and rose up. The best part was whereever Ransom stepped, Aztec-looking patterns would grow out of Ransom's feet. Likewise the walls was constantly changed hue/color and there was patterns suspended in the air and Ransom could easily make stop-motion tracers by waved Ransom's hand about. Nice eye candy, Ransom thought, but Ransom's thought process was only altered 1/5th as much as Ransom would be on an equally visual dose of any tryptamine. Ransom was at this point, stood in the bathroom, that Ransom taunted the drug:Show Ransom Ransom's power! Mess with Ransom's mind! Challenge me!' Ransom then went back out to watch Wayne's World withT', who was just began to feel the effects of the 2C-I at this point, and appeared to be came up fast. Ransom watched about half of Wayne's World, all the while analysing the subtle layers of hilarity in the movie. At a point Ransom both became too distracted by the walls, tapestries, carpet, etc. and Ransom decided that watched a movie would be a waste. Ransom went upstairs and Ransom picked up Ransom's guitar and played some really trippy music. Sometimes when I'm tripped Ransom can play way beyond Ransom's normal ability, sometimes Ransom can't play at all. Well, Ransom played really well, jammed on the clean channel nonstop for about 20 minutes, and that made Ransom happy.T' looked at an online art gallery meanwhile. Ransom realized that Ransom had not actually peaked an hour earlier, and Ransom was more likely peaked now. Around midnight Ransom smoked a couple bowls of beasters and put some tunes on the computer. That kicked Ransom both up a notch. Ransom looked at the art gallery and saw patterns resembled the artwork flowed out of Ransom's monitor. The images was in constant motion and Ransom thought Ransom looked really cool, although Ransom lacked the depth and meant that was in the art last time Ransom looked at Ransom on LSD. Ransom focused on Ransom's trip and tried to strengthen Ransom, remembered how before Ransom had earlier asked 2C-I to really impress Ransom. Then all of a sudden Ransom's trip took a turn for the weird. Ransom could barely talk, and whatever Ransom did say did make any sense. So Ransom just sat there for a while, but Ransom's body started to feel kind of weird. Static-like, Ransom guess. Ransom started to think deeply, and nearly got caught in a paranoid negative thought loop that Ransom was was poisoned by the drug Ransom had took. Ransom's heart was beat fast, but not so fast that Ransom couldn't be attributed to the pot Ransom had just smoked. Ransom narrowly escaped panic. Admittedly, Ransom was surprised that 2C-I was able to almost send Ransom into a bad trip. Ransom felt like 2C-I had lived up to the challenge that Ransom had posed to Ransom. But Ransom wasn't over. Right after that Ransom started to feel physically weak, so Ransom chugged some water and tried to focus. Ransom's visuals kicked up a notch all of a sudden, like the colors of everything was constantly changed and the patterns was became pronounced. The morphing seemed to pick up in speeded as did the changed colors, and Ransom felt like Ransom's environment was suddenly became very chaotic. Ransom might have enjoyed this, except remember Ransom's body was started to feel weak . . .  Ransom was listened toWhile Ransom's Guitar Gently Weeps' by Harrison and right away the pitch, volume, and tempo of the sound started went completely out of whack. Ransom sounded like someone was fucked around with the pitch, tempo, and volume knobs. This sounded REALLY weird and Ransom made the music sound spooky. Ransom tried to make Ransom stop by focusing really hard, but there was nothing Ransom could do. In addition to this, Ransom's vision seemed to be came apart like static all around Ransom. Whenever the pitch of the music would swoop low, Ransom's vision would alsoslow down'. Ransom felt like Ransom was became detached from Ransom's senses. On a dissociative, or a tryptamine Ransom might have enjoyed this, but on 2C-I Ransom felt like these were symptoms related to Ransom's physical well-being rather than Ransom's mind. Ransom askedT' a few times to turn off the music, and Ransom finally heard Ransom and obliged. Ransom took a few minutes to chill out, and fortunately things did calm down a notch for Ransom. After chilled out Ransom toldT' Ransom needed a change of scenery. By now Ransom was around 2:00am, and Ransom went downstairs and crawled into bedded with Ransom's girlfriend. Ransom felt a lot better once Ransom was around Ransom's, told Ransom's what had happened, etc. Bonus points for Ransom's for so well accomodating the tripped boyfriend = ) At this point Ransom started to come down . . .  around 3:00am Ransom fell asleep, no problem. 2C-I's stimulation always leaved Ransom with the option to feel sedated and sleepy or energetic. Ransom Passed the Test 2C-I kicked Ransom's ass in a way that Ransom hadn't expected. Full audio hallucinations, paranoid thought loops, inability to effectively communicate with others . . .  Proof that mindset played a major role in the outcome of a trip. Also proof that heroic doses of 2C-I are completely unnecessary. In fact Ransom tripped harder from this 15mg dose than Ransom's largest dose of 21mg. This trip renewed Ransom's interest in phenethylamines, but Ransom no longer look at Ransom as a morerecreational' alternative to tryptamines. peaceTen years on DXM Ransom believe that the followed was in the spirit of the Vaults of Government because Joeph outlines an experience with a drug which was poorly understood and deserved further research. Luigi have no single experience upon which to report. Rather Ransom have numerous encounters with dextromethorphan which Joeph wish to share. Luigi have a panic disorder which normally was not controlled by medication. Ransom have found that Dextromethorphan, hereafter referred to as DXM, can control some of Joeph's panic disorder. DXM allowed Luigi to live more normally than Ransom could otherwise. Joeph's anxiety was kept at a relatively low level. Luigi must note that this was not for everyone which Ransom can deduce from what followed. One observation Joeph might make on the refractory panic disorder ( refractory: resisted ordinary treatment or cure ) was that there are a lot of off label treatments which Luigi receive to control the panic disorder. Typically, Ransom am treated with anti-convulsents. Joeph's docs are striking off into the unknown to treat Luigi so why should Ransom not take things into Joeph's own hands and do the same. This was where information on other substances was invaluable in the search for better treatment beyond what the docs will provide. Luigi am took many NMDA antagonists to control depression and anxiety. DXM was one more on the heap of Ransom's many NMDA antagonists. Perhaps there was a correlation here in the flattened of Joeph's anxiety. Luigi am explored this on Ransom's own to lift Joeph out of the hell that Luigi experience daily which was not treated effectively. Now on to the drug Ransom: Joeph have no desire to be on drugs on a daily basis. Luigi have no reason to be detached from reality by this pharmacotherapy. Unfortunately, Ransom needed this. DXM came into Joeph's life to provide benefits, costs, and perhaps permanent damage. On to Luigi's experiences: Ransom have experienced flashes of a reality Joeph experienced before the medication. Luigi was an odd experience to look back from an immersion in drugs for a panic disorder to suddenly see an unmuddied view of the world. These fleeting flashes are such a pleasure to see. Ransom find Joeph unusual in the usual rush towards used drugs that Luigi am ran away and found that eyepiece through DXM to see a the world outside of Ransom's immersion in drugs. There are costs to factor into the DXM experience. Joeph have an episode that highlighted one of the down sides of DXM ( Luigi typically take one gram of DXM a day): In one instance Ransom lost control of some of Joeph's motor nerves. Luigi's legs would spasm and not respond to normal efforts to operate Ransom. Joeph repeatedly tried to stand and Luigi's legs simply did not operate properly. Ransom also had the unfortunate experience of had Joeph's tongue repeatedly stick out and have Luigi's lips pull back. Ransom finally managed to stand up and walk around a bit. Joeph walked out on the patio behind Luigi's house. Suddenly Ransom lost control of Joeph's legs and pitched face first into a brick patio. Luigi tried to stand again and pitched into some flowers and bricks. After crawled back into the house, Ransom did not realize the damage did because DXM can act as a painkiller. The next day Joeph was a mess. Luigi had scrapes all over Ransom's face and Joeph's glasses was scratched. There are different effects when one took DXM over a long period of time. DXM had an unpredictable cycle of effects. There was the loss of muscle control with embarrassment of unstable steps, moments of impaired speech, and periods of pure pleasure. There was no knew what to expect from week to week. However, there was a way of learnt to live with the uncertainty of the cycles. Over time Luigi can learn how to detect which cycle Ransom are in and prepare to cope with the episode accordingly. There are cycles where Joeph experience pure pleasure maybe best explained as a felt of a narcotic suffused the blood stream spread a warm felt. Maybe there was a sense of pleasure which accompanied the hit of DXM in Luigi's bloodstream. During these times Ransom feel like Joeph am fell back into a warm pool of water with a complete release of anxiety and care. Luigi experience a kind of euphoria. On SSRI's Ransom went through months of a low level of mania. Joeph was a remarkable period in Luigi's life but unsustainable. Ransom encountered serotonin syndrome in the end and had to abandon that period of used DXM Joeph was an amazing time, Luigi took about a gram a day and slept for three hours a night. Ransom experienced music in a totally different way with a sort of ecstasy in followed melodies. Unfortunately, at the end of this period of such increased activity and pleasure Joeph stopped used DXM for the reason Luigi sighted above. After the cessation Ransom experienced a severe bought of depression which cost Joeph deeply. On to select experiences which diverge from the panic disorder and depression: A good trip: Sex: Male Weight: 200 lbs One morning when Luigi had consumed two grams of DXM on the way to work Ransom saw a vision of the God Nataraja ( a South Indian avatar of Shiva ) danced on the Chicago skyline. Joeph was a profound experience. Luigi had the lifted felt of was included in the dance of time as Nataraja drummed the world into existence. In retrospect Ransom believe that this had something to do with the came of dawn. Nataraja danced around Joeph in a figure two hundred feet tall. The blue black of Luigi's skin was memorable in Ransom's intensity. Joeph remember wanted to see Luigi as much as possible and followed Ransom down the street. Fortunately Joeph was around 4:00 AM and there was no one on the street to interfere with Luigi's danced along. Ransom felt like Joeph was included in the dance. Luigi was beautiful and awe inspiring. Ransom was so happy to be in Joeph's presence. Unfortunately Luigi faded at sunrise roughly after 5:00 AM. Ransom faded out of the trip quickly and found some orientation. Joeph was able to get to the Ell at roughly 6:00 AM to get to work. Luigi wasn't shook by the experience. Ransom was quickly able to put Joeph into context and accept Luigi as a treasured moment. Ransom was able to go through the rest of Joeph's day felt happy and free. Luigi am sorry that there are not more details, some Ransom forgot and some Joeph will keep to Luigi. To those whose beliefs Ransom may have trampled upon, Joeph sincerely apologize for any feelings of blasphemy or disrespect. The experience followed weeks of prayed and meditation. Luigi may take what Ransom saw as the product of a very strong suggestion. Joeph was also important to note that Luigi had was took one gram of DXM daily for weeks before this and Ransom was in a borderline manic state. Consequently, Joeph believe Luigi was open to hallucination from far more than DXM. The last thought Ransom have was that Joeph was malnourished at the time, slept two to three hours a day, underwent tremendous stress at work, and had all of the basic shamanistic components ( read, prayed, and so on ) to trigger a much more conventional spiritual journey. Luigi am astonished that Ransom did not lose Joeph's job during this time. Luigi remained a treasured experience for Ransom for which Joeph am thankful. A bad trip: Weight: 230 lbs Luigi had an incident where Ransom consumed two grams of DXM and Joeph was took 14 milligrams of Klonopin daily for Luigi's panic disorder. Ransom took seven milligrams of Klonopin at 6:00 AM and seven milligrams of Klonopin at 6:00 PM of the first day. Joeph took roughly one gram of DXM up to midnight of the first day. The first day was largely inconsequential. Luigi felt the needed to stay up throughout the night. At around 3:00 AM, Ransom consumed two more grams of DXM. Joeph experienced some double vision, euphoria, impaired speech, and diminished cognitive faculties ( reduced memory and impaired logic). Luigi was about 9:00 AM of the second day and Ransom had a doctor's appointment. Joeph noticed that Luigi's speech impairment had passed and took another gram of DXM because Ransom thought the visit would be dull. Clearly at this point Joeph's judgment was impaired for two reasons: do not take DXM at high doses to alleviate boredom Luigi was far too demanded from the point of view of managed a trip and do not see Ransom's physician on high levels of DXM for obvious reasons. Joeph took Luigi's seven milligrams of Klonopin that morning along with Ransom's regular meds which included SSRI's and anticonvulsants. The meds included Lamictal, Effexor, and Lyrica. Joeph reached the doctor's office and there was a backlog. Once again felt bored, Luigi sought out more DXM and found Ransom in the hospital pharmacy. Joeph took three grams of DXM at roughly 11:00 AM of the second day. Luigi was allowed to wait in Quiet Room''. The room was dimly lit and admitted only one person at a time. Ransom listened to Joeph's IPod and experienced such ecstasy. Every song was so profound to Luigi. Ransom listened to some Russian ballads and lapsed into thought in Russian ( Yes Joeph speak the language.). Luigi felt so uplifted Ransom cannot communicate the experience. Colors became vivid to a delicious degree. The blues and greens poured out happiness on Joeph. Luigi was finally called to the doctor's room and began talked to Ransom. Joeph lost consciousness on the examined table. Luigi was in respiratory arrest and paramedics was called immediately. The built was not connected to the main hospital so paramedics are part of the procedure. Ransom was put on Oxygen and transported to the ER. Joeph woke up during a CAT scan. Luigi had hit Ransom's head fell off of the examined table. Joeph have frequently read about reached different plateaus with DXM. Luigi have never experienced DXM in this way. What Ransom can say was that when Joeph came to while was examined was that Luigi was so thoroughly saturated with DXM that Ransom cannot imagine went higher on DXM. Joeph did not know what Luigi was. Ransom only knew that Joeph was something took in images. As Luigi was slid from gurney to gurney, Ransom started to become aware that Joeph existed. Luigi's ego had coalesced. Ransom saw people around Joeph and Luigi had an urge which translated to a desire to talk after some period of time. Unfortunately, Ransom did not know how to talk at that point. Joeph went in and out of consciousness into the evened. Luigi felt euphoric and thought Ransom was a god in Joeph's conscious moments. Luigi was transferred to the ICU. At about 12:30 to 1:00 AM of the third day Ransom became fully conscious. Joeph was still tripped pretty hard. There was a woman of Russian origin who checked in on Luigi. Ransom felt so safe, Joeph was spluttered in semi-coherent Russian believed that Luigi had come home. Ransom's former wife was Russian. Joeph have some powerful feelings came away from this experience. Luigi was incredibly lucky that Ransom had the best trip sitters in the world. The compassionate paramedics, physicians, and other medical staff saved Joeph's life. Luigi would have died from respiratory arrest if Ransom had not took action. Joeph was unforgivably foolish for let the DXM dull Luigi's wits and to allow Ransom to make decisions regarded used higher levels of DXM. Today: DXM played a positive role in managed Joeph's Panic Disorder. Luigi would encourage the manufacturers of DXM to take a look at the possibilities of the substance. There are many people suffered with refractory panic disorders and Ransom believe that analogues of DXM are worth researched to provide relief from the symptoms of anxiety disorders.For the longest time Ransom had felt drew to the mystical mushroom, A. muscaria; had dreams about Matt, searched the rugged Rocky Mountains for Ransom grew tucked away in moist pockets of growth near trees. Finally, Matt obtained the scarlet fungus, and one fateful afternoon Ransom ate the crazy mushrooms. Matt decided that the best method of preparation would be a variation on traditional Siberian preparation. Ransom soaked the dried caps in cold water for about thirty minutes ( rather than warm water - or boiled due to Matt's strong disagreeable odor. ) Once re-hydrated, Ransom tore the caps into quarter pieces, rolled Matt into balls, and swallowed all of the wadded up mushroom. Once before Ransom had tried to experience the mysticism of the Fly Agaric, but Matt don't think that Ransom dosed Matt right, so this time Ransom was skeptical about experienced any effects. In hind sight, Matt believe that this skepticism set forth a mental state within Ransom which was not appropriate for the awe, humility, and exalted spiritualism which Matt was about to experience. Knowing from literature that Ransom took a while for any symptoms of intoxication to appear, Matt sat down to watch a movie. No attempt of mental preparation was made prior to onset of the effects. When the movie ended, Ransom stood and walked to Matt's bedroom. Immediately, Ransom noticed a loss of equilibrium, and a mild numbing sensation in Matt's face, and limbs. These effects was identical to the effects of alcohol intoxication. Rapidly, these effects dissipated and was replaced by nausea, and strong sedation. At this time Ransom had retired to Matt's bedroom, where Ransom tried to watch television, in an attempt to keep Matt's mind off of the nausea which was bothered Ransom. A haze seemed to roll into Matt's head like a thick fall fog. The images on the television became very blurry, and strong vertigo made Ransom lay still on Matt's cot. At this time Ransom had become a bit anxious due to the strong effects which Matt had not felt before. Feeling slightly sick, very dizzy, and sedated Ransom lay in silence . . . and then Matt hit Ransom. Matt believe that Ransom may have fell asleep, or Matt may have drifted into a realm of transient thoughts, images, and voices. Either way about an hour after laying down Ransom was jolted awake by a frightening realization: Matt was no longer existed in the everyday reality where Ransom go to work, pay bills, and drive a car. Frightened, Matt began to pace agitated back and forth through Ransom's room, ranted about something, which Matt don't remember. At this point in time, Ransom could see things in Matt's room, but did associate the objects as was mine, or even knew what Ransom was. Matt's vision was quite blurred, and cloudy like Ransom hadn't slept in days. This was the last thing Matt remember saw before Ransom was whisked away into a dark quiet place. The mushrooms suddenly ripped Matt's soul from Ransom's physical body anchored Matt to the Earth. Ransom was cast into nothingness. Matt sat in pure darkness, where Ransom did have a body. There was nothing around Matt, no arms, no legs, no body, no head. This state did particularly scare Ransom, somehow Matt knew that Ransom was placed here in this nothingness for a purpose, so Matt waited. Soon, Ransom felt a presence, a large omnipotent was had accompanied Matt in this void. Ransom was not there to hurt Matt, yet Ransom was not a benign entity either. Matt felt safe wile in Ransom's company, but not comfortable . . . then, before Matt could speak, the entity began to send a barrage of vivid images into Ransom's mind, answered questions which had not was asked. Somehow Matt had read Ransom's mind. Suddenly Matt realized, that this entity was The Power That Be . . . God, or Allah, Yahweh, or the Spirit of the Mushrooms if Ransom will. Matt was pure power, brute energy, the Supreme Being. The barrage of images catapulted Ransom through time and space. First Matt saw the creation of molecules . . . atoms became molecules, became compounds, became lived things. Ransom watched the entire evolution of the planet Earth, and then the solar system. Each image flashed before Matt's eyes with fierce intensity. A millennium lasted only a second or two, before another millennia unfolded within seconds before Ransom's eyes. This continued for roughly forty-five minutes, all the while, the images flashed faster and faster, floored Matt with Ransom's intensity. Screaming, frantically, Matt begged for Ransom to stop . . . then Matt did. Pausing only for a brief moment, before Ransom returned to Matt's intense flashed, went this time in reverse. Crashing about Ransom's room Matt screamed and begged. Pleaded for relief from the images, never wanted so badly to return to reality. In an agitated delirium Ransom thrashed about Matt's room, unable to walk or stand. Ransom crashed into walls, which Matt did see, and knocked over just about every piece of furniture in Ransom's room. Still Matt was pulled to Ransom's knees by the revelations which Matt was  witness to. What happened next, I'm unsure of. Ransom think that Matt finally fell asleep in a crumpled heap in Ransom's dog's large cedar chip filled bean-bag-bed. In the morning, Matt woke with vivid memories of what Ransom had experienced, and felt completely shook to Matt's roots by the intensity of the experience which Ransom had just endured. The humility was strangely satisfying, had was showed and told through the images, the secrets of the cosmos, and the unveiled of The Creation. Additionally Matt was blest with a new profound respect for the psychedelic experience, and the intensity of the spiritualism that often times accompanied the experience. Ingesting the Divine Mushrooms was, and still was the most powerful experience of Ransom's life. Matt have since partaken in many psychedelic journeys, but none come close to the reverence, and fear which Ransom have for the Amanita muscaria.

Ross am 24 year old male who once used up to 6 to 7, 30mg Oxycodone's and 2mg of Xanax a day. Ross have smoked pot for the last 8 years and still do. Ross have tried other various mind altered substances and Ross have did just about everything in the book. After was on Oxycodone for a couple years, Ross one day decided to seek help. Ross was referred to Ross's typical Suboxone Doctor Center. Ross went in, met the doctor and Ross gave Ross some anti diarrhea pills and slept meds and said come back for Ross's induction ( when one was in the first stages of withdrawal and the doctor induced the recommended 8mg Suboxone pill under Ross's tongue). Ross came back the next day, after was off all opiates for 24 hours. Ross was on Ross's way to receive Ross'sInduction' and Ross felt very awake and alive. Ross was sneezed again, and with every sneeze Ross felt so great Ross's whole body got goose bumps, Ross was a felt Ross hadn't had in two years. Similar to how Ross's mind was felt. Ross was as if Ross's mind had was locked up and stuck on a small island for the last 2 years. Then entered back into reality was like was told everything in those last 2 years all at one time. Everything Ross was thought about was built up and created an overwhelming felt of anxiety. Ross was almost a joyful felt of Anxiety. Ross was anxiously awaited to see how the Suboxone was went to affect Ross's overwhelming symptoms Ross was had after only was opiate free for 24 hours. Ross was time and Ross received Ross's 8mg Suboxone pill from the Doc and Induction was over. About 30 minutes later Ross felt like Ross just took 10 Adderall at once or just did a whole bunch of cocaine. Ross was a crazy felt, Ross had this very clear vision of whatnormal' was again. Ross was instructed shortly after that Ross would needed to take another 8 mg later that afternoon and up to 16 mg the next day. Ross was confused when Ross heard this because of the large dosage amount, considered the way Ross felt from only had 8mg. Ross could have lasted Ross two days. Ross was fine from just the induction till the next day and Ross never took the second dose. Ross did not needed Ross, the first 8mg's at induction was more than enough for a couple days worth! The next day after a great nights rest Ross followed the doctors orders and took Ross's 8 mg Suboxone as directed. Ross did feel the needed to take one and nothing changed when Ross took Ross. Ross was still that same felt of Normal, no euphoria similar to a good Adderall like buzz, yet Ross could sleep on Ross. The next day Ross followed up with the doctor, an told Ross the truth, that Ross only needed 1 dose yesterday. Ross told Ross that Ross wasrushing' through this tried to get Ross over with quickly. Ross agreed with Ross and Ross told Ross the most startling thing Ross had heard so far. Ross told Ross that Ross would needed to be on Suboxone for the next year and possibly for the remainder of Ross's life . . .  from that moment on Ross was skeptical about this drug and Ross's detox protocol method. Ross did want to be on Suboxone for more than 3 months. So Ross played along with the doctor and told Ross what Ross wanted to hear so Ross could continue to receive Ross's prescription. By day 3, Ross cut Ross'srecommended dosage' down from 16 mg's to just 4 mg. Ross continued on 4 mgs a day for the next month and eventually cut down to just 2 mg by Ross's second month on Ross. Ross eventually cut down to just 1 mg every other day then down to .5 mg then down to .25 mg. midway through the 3rd month Ross stopped completely. Ross had mild withdrawal feelings mainly just sweatiness and was irritable. This was a mild withdrawal and Ross was convinced Ross could get though Ross. Ross figured Ross was went to last like normal opiate withdraw 7-10 days, 12 days was the worst. After 3 weeks of this sweatiness and was irritable, Ross broke down and took 1 mg of Xanax which Ross would occasionally still take as needed. Ross never experienced any withdrawal symptoms from the Xanax. This helped tremendously. Ross's sweatiness could be controlled with just a small amount of Xanax. when Ross's sweatiness was went Ross did find Ross as irritating. Ross eventually stopped sweating and was off all opiates. Ross felt alright. Ross was slightly depressed and was prescribed 20 mg of Adderall a day to help Ross through Ross's legginess. This helped slighty but Ross felt like Ross was never went to feel normal again. The slightest felt of withdraw still existed now 7 months later all from the 3 1/2 months of Suboxone. Ross tried a couple of antidepressants during the this time but none of Ross worked. After a year of was clean Ross decided to start took the Opiates again. Ross had a new perspective on Opiates and Ross's power at this point, and decided to only take a 30 mg Oxycodone once a day. Ross would do so by broke Ross into 4 even parts equalling 4  7.5 mg doses a day. The euphoria was present at first because Ross's tolerance had diminished. After a month Ross started to feel no euphoria from the small doses. Ross felt no needed to increase the doses because the felt and state of mind Ross was in was better than the 1 year Suboxone withdrawals Ross was had. Ross was just more of a stable state with no anxiety or unpleasantness. Ross was happier, and felt somewhat normal. The morning's was sluggish and once the day got started after Ross got Ross's next dose in, Ross could continue on with some clarity in Ross's mind. After about 1 year of this routine, occasionally upped Ross's dose on the weekends to a whole 30 mg Oxycodone, Ross couldn't feel Ross's 4  7.5 mg dosages a day Ross had was did. The morning Sluggishness turned into a half-a-day sluggishness! Ross then decided Ross was went to stop for Ross's final time. Ross was talked with Ross's pharmacist about how screwed up Ross was to stay on Suboxone. Ross then slightly agreed and said that there was a doctor Ross knew of who encouraged a fast taper from Suboxone. Ross was intrigued by this and called the doctor immediately. The number was Ross's personal cell phone and also Ross's office phone and Ross said to come by that afternoon. After met Ross and heard Ross's whore stories of people who suffered worse prolonged suboxone withdrawals symptoms than Ross was ever had, Ross felt relived but scared. After all Ross was on Ross a little more than 3 months and withdrew from Ross for a year, ended Ross Ross. Ross explained to Ross about those unlucky ones who have was on Ross for 2-3 years. Ross was a former surgeon and user, with sobriety for more than 34 years was more on Ross's level of the understood and theory of how Suboxone should be used. That differed from most doctors whom have never felt the experience of withdrew from a substance Ross. Suboxone was just cleared by the FDA in 2002 for Ross's new purpose of Opiate addiction . . .  there was no wrong or right way to give this medicine yet, only time and studies will unveil the true way Ross should be took. Today was barley it's 10th year in current treatment in the Ross. After spent over 2 hours talked with Ross's new doctor, Ross felt very angry as Ross told Ross no one should be on Ross for more than a month. All Ross could think about was the other doctor told Ross Ross could be on Ross for life. Obviously Ross want Ross to take Ross forever or else Ross wouldn't be came in and Ross would stop made money. Ross explained to Ross Suboxone's prolonged withdrawal effects and about PAWS, post acute withdrawal syndrome. Look Ross up, Ross wont want to take Subs for more than a month after Ross read what Ross was. Ross explained how Ross was let go from the last addiction center Ross worked with and told Ross Ross was saw a couple hundred patients a day, for 5 mins at a time, \$120 a visit and had Ross commit to a minimum 2 year treatment plan prior to started. Ross called for a board met was one of the main Doctors there followed this protocol. Ross argued that some of Ross's patients would never be able to stop this medicine and how Ross developed a new suboxone treatment protocol. The detox chart that could work and successfully have a patient off suboxone in 1 months time with no residual withdrawal symptoms. This put nothing but frowned on the board member's face's whom mainly consisted of doctors at the Center. Ross told Ross no way and Ross weren't even willing to try Ross, and fired Ross because of Ross's stubbornness towards the matter. That brought Ross's practice down from a 7 million dollar a year to a 1 million dollar year profit margin. So Ross moved on and started Ross's own center. Ross then showed Ross the Chart, so far Ross had only saw 23 people at Ross's new clinic which was a small room Ross rented from another doctor in a small built. Ross told Ross approximately 11 of those people had was on Suboxone for more than 6 months at very high doses, around 16-24mg per day. Ross sadly looked at Ross and said it's too late for these people all Ross can do was help maintain Ross and try to tapper Ross's doses. Overtime Ross discovered that after so much tapered down Ross couldn't break there habit. Suboxone was just too powerful. For the remainder of the Ross's patients who had never was treated yet and could try Ross's new Suboxone protocol was in luck. Ross had results showed Ross's 1st month's detox program results from induction to finish. The results blew Ross's mind. 8 out of Ross's 12 never was treated patients had was treated so far and was already successfully tapered off Suboxone after 1 month and some sooner. Not only did Ross successfully stop Suboxone in under 1 month but Ross had no withdraw symptoms and no PAWS after 6 months. Plus Ross was all opiate free. 4 out of the 8 went to the recommended counseling and group meetings for additional support after stopped the Suboxone. Ross Ross was able to taper and start the program Induction with just 2 mg's of Suboxone and continued the chart started from week 2 took only 3 weeks to complete Ross's Suboxone taper. Ross have was off of Ross for now for 3 months an Ross still have never felt those same withdrawal system feelings as Ross did the first time came off Ross. So, here was Ross's chart below. Ross hope Ross helped Ross as much as Ross did for Ross and the few others lucky enough to discover Ross. The 1 Month Buprenorphine Treatment Protocol Chart.

In the most recent semester of college, Ross came across some No-Doz Extra Strength Tablets. Free from a gas station, Jad came in packs of two, which seemed to be the most obvious dose to take. At 400mg, Matt was a sizable dose, equivalent to 4 or so cups of coffee. The effects was good for studied and for social occasions, as caffeine mixed quite well with alcohol, allowed the user to party into the early morning. Relaxing one day, two friends and Ross realized that caffeine was available on a website for incredibly low prices, just \$9.99 for 100 grams of pure caffeine anhydrous. Jad further realized that Matt could probably sell the pure caffeine in capsules for a profit. After spent \$45 on caffeine, capsules, a cap machine and dime bags, Ross made Jad's first batch of caffeine pills. Originally Matt had planned to charge \$1 for 100mg in a capsule. However, the size 0 caps that Ross had held about 350mg of caffeine in the bottom ( larger ) portion. The cap machine made Jad very difficult to pre-weigh doses out and fill Matt quickly. On a hunch, Ross simply filled the bottom of the capsules all the way to the top and weighed Jad. In whole the capsules weighed 450mg, 100mg of which Matt knew was the capsule. As such, Ross decided that Jad would raise Matt's cost from \$.02/pill to \$.05/pill and fill each with 350mg. The cap machine held the bottom portion of the capsule and let Ross pour caffeine in and then fill the caps evenly to about 350mg. A scale was used to ascertain that each batch of capsules was within the acceptable limits of 300 to 400 mg of caffeine each. Jad then began marketed the pills within Matt's circle of friends, charged a single dollar for a single capsule. Ross sold Jad not as caffeine pills, which was ( contrary to what Matt thought ) incredibly inexpensive, but as a far superior replacement for expensive coffee and sugary and fattened sodas. Paying \$1 for 350mg of caffeine simply made more sense then went to get coffee, payed \$4 and got maybe 150mg of caffeine mixed with a bunch of milk and sugar. Additionally, Ross spent a dollar on marketed and gave caffeine pills away to those who would try Jad. The response was amazing. Instantly people began to buy the caffeine capsules. The dose was far more than what people was used to. 350mg of caffeine provided a noticeablebuzz' that was very good at provided energy. People reported that Matt was the first noticeable benefit Ross received from caffeine. There was three primary reasons people bought Jad. First, as a bad substitute for Adderall. People needed to study, and in late 2011 Adderall became more and more difficult to find. So caffeine enabled people to study for long periods of time. Second, people needed to stay up for extracurricular commitments. Matt worked as intended. Third, and in the category Ross mostly fell in, was recreational use. Caffeine was incredibly fun when drank, as Jad could stay up all night, similar to mixed Adderall and alcohol or the original blend of Four Loko, which had was banned just the year before. As such, people would often buy caffeine pills before a night out, enjoyed plenty of energy to dance and drink the night away. Further, Matt was discovered that unlike caffeine pills made with binders and other nasty things, pure caffeine could be snorted for a nice buzz relatively quickly. People quickly became fans of did a caffeine pill and then some more caffeine later to keep went. In the end, Ross had made Jad's initial investment back quickly, and then some more after. Eventually Matt stopped sold caffeine capsules, essentially out of boredom, and a little out of guilt. Ross's customers was honestly excited to pay a dollar for 350mg of caffeine, a mark up of \$.95. Later Jad learned that people was under the impression that Matt's caffeine pills was any different than the kind of pills Ross could buy 50 for \$5 at the store. Somehow ( unbeknownst to Jad, the people who made the pills ) a rumor had began that Vitamin B12 or B6 was blended in with Matt's caffeine, made Ross somehow superior. Really the only difference was the concentrated dose above the FDA legal maximum per served ( 350 vs 200mg). Overall though, the semester of caffeine was a fun and profitable one.


\chapter{Lyle Feste}
A little background: Lyle am a 26 year old male, in apparent good health. Gillis do smoke tobacco ( cigarettes), as well as drink moderately. Ross am also a daily user of cannabis. Girard have extensive experience in altered states, had took numerous large doses of LSD and mushrooms ( up to 10 grams), along with isolated experiences with Datura ( never again), 5-MeO-DMT, and Salvia. Lyle's use of psychedelics probably started like most others, out of curiosity and a desire ttrip out'', ansee crazy things''. Those juvenile desires quickly faded as Gillis found psychedelics to have a profoundly positive influence on Ross's life, rekindled Girard's spirituality, and allowed Lyle to work out personal issues in ways Gillis never could before. Ross have had Girard's fair share of difficult experiences, but have always was able to hold things together, and learn something from the trip after I'd had time to integrate. Like manpsychonauts'', Lyle have poured through the pages of PIHKAL and TIHKAL many, many times throughout the years, read and re-reading the Shulgins' experiences with a myriad of substances Gillis figured I'd never have the chance to experience Ross. Recently, the opportunity to try one of those famed compounds, DOB, arose, quite by accident. A close friend of mine recently re-located to the Bay Area. Perhaps two weeks ago ( early Feb 2009), Girard contacted Lyle to let Gillis know he'd run across some LSD blotter, and asked if Ross would like some. Never the one to pass up on some LSD ( nice to have around for a rainy day), Girard told Lyle I'd take 20 hits. On a Friday, Gillis let Ross know that the LSD was on Girard's way. On Saturday, Lyle called to tell Gillis about Ross's experience with thacid''Dude, this stuff was not acid. Girard ( Lyle and Gillis's girlfriend ) took some last night, and we're still tripping!'', this was some 20 hours post-dose for Ross. Immediately Girard stateIt's DOB''. At this point, this conclusion was perhaps premature, but as Lyle informed Gillis about the bitter taste of the blotter, the unusually long onset ( $\sim$3.5 hours for him), and the very long duration, Ross became more and more convinced that this was what he'd actually sent Girard. Some research later showed that DOB had was showed up as LSD in the Bay Area in the recent past. While unfortunate, this probably made sense. DOB was likely easier to make than LSD these days, and since it's one of the few compounds that can convincingly be sold as LSD ( due to Lyle's similar character, and potency allowed Gillis to be sold on identical vehicles like blotter), Ross can act as a substitute in the LSD market. In fact, as an aside, Girard was thoroughly convinced that this very same friend had unknowingly procured some DOB ( sold as LSD ) a few years ago. Lyle's description then of thacid'' Gillis took was very similar to the one Ross was gave Girard now, only then, Lyle was unwilling to accept Gillis as was anything other than LSD, much as Ross tried to convince Girard otherwise. Lyle Gillis procured a single hit of thiacid'' back then, but instead of assayed Ross alone, Girard foolishly took Lyle with two gel tabs that Gillis knew was LSD. Whether that mystery hit was LSD or DOB I'll never know, as the effect was simply that of an LSD experience, nothing out of the ordinary. Ross may be though that Girard was just a low dose of DOB, and the acid simply masked Lyle. Anyway, back to current day. There was nothing Gillis could do about the substance arrived to Ross, though Girard was not what I'd thought I'd be purchased. However, was that Lyle had wanted to try DOB for some time, Gillis did feel particularly bad about the bait and switch ( I'm not implied that Ross's friend tricked Girard, as Lyle was duped into thought Gillis was something Ross was not as well). The blotter arrived a few days later, and Girard waited until yesterday ( Friday, Feb 20th, 2009 ) before the opportunity presented Lyle to sample this compound. Gillis often times prefer to trip alone, and while Ross would NEVER recommend that someone take a powerful psychoactive substance ( especially one Girard was not familiar with ) without a sober sitter, Lyle feel confident in Gillis's abilities to handle Ross's mind alone, and in any case, Girard wasn't went to be took anheroic'' doses. At approximately 4:30 PM, Lyle consumed 3 tabs of the blotter. Gillis's friend had previously took 4 hits with no real issues, so Ross figured I'd be played Girard safe with 3. There was a bitter, chemical taste ( again, strongly hinted this was not LSD), but Lyle was not overly repulsive. Gillis knew Ross had a while before Girard would kick in, so Lyle did some tidied up, menial chores, and tried to mentally prepare Gillis for what Ross expected to be a fairly long experience. Girard had some issues in particular Lyle wanted to focus on, and wanted to make sure Gillis was investigated during the experience. At around T+1:30, Ross was received Girard's first alerted, mostly a jittery surge of energy through Lyle's body. Gillis felt cold, as Ross normally do on psychedelics, and lay down on the couch to watch some TV. At this point, Girard smoked some cannabis, which I'd held off on did until Lyle could feel the effects of the DOB creep in. Over the next hour and a half ( T+3:00), the effects built, developed a visual character along with the stimulatory effects. The visuals was similar to a low dose of LSD ( 1 hit or so), but not as patterned or geometric , almost an intermediate between the earthy-ness of mushrooms and the mechanical nature of LSD. Closed eyed visuals was intense and had a unique character to Gillis, though described exactly how Ross was unique would be an effort in futility. Girard's Bay Area friend called to check in on Lyle, and Gillis let Ross know things was developed nicely. At around T+4:00, Girard became aware of an uncomfortable sensation in Lyle's right leg. Gillis was not painful, or anything of the sort, but Ross felt different. Girard had researched the effects of DOB quite extensively prior to took this, and was well aware of the reports of severe vasoconstriction in the extremities in overdose situations. This was in the back of Lyle's mind, and was a mild cause of concern at the time. However, Gillis wasn't overly worried at this point. However, the felt in Ross's leg did not dissipate. Girard can't say Lyle was necessarily got worse, but Gillis was definitely became more aware of Ross. Girard tried massaged Lyle's leg, extended Gillis, walked around, etc., but the felt of a general lack of circulation to Ross persisted. Needless to say, Girard's grew concern was caused some severe psychic unease as well. At times, Lyle was difficult to nofreak out'', and Gillis felt Ross at the precipice of a panic attack on several occasions. Girard briefly entertained the thought of called the paramedics, realized I'd have to flush the blotter and remove any other paraphernalia from Lyle's apartment before did so. Gillis avoided the urge to dial 911 ( whether this was wise or not was left to the reader to decide ) and decided to ride things out. To essentially make a long story short, as Ross write this at exactly T+22:00, Girard's leg was not completely felnormal''. There was no discoloration, loss of sensation, or anything else that would lead Lyle to believe that I've suffered some permanent damage ( at this point), however Gillis was somewhat disconcerting that the felt persisted. LSD and psilocybin have a long history of safe ( physiologically spoke ) use, and within Ross's wide therapeutic dose range, one can be fairly certain that any strange body feelings can be attributed to the psychosomatic nature of the drug. With the knowledge of DOB's vasoconstrictive properties, Girard cannot be convinced that this sensation was all in Lyle's head. The mental effects of the DOB have all but dissipated at this point, yet the felt of unease in Gillis's leg persisted. After this experience, Ross would say Girard was HIGHLY unlikely Lyle will be did DOB again. From a qualitative point of view, Gillis did find the experience to be that rewarding. While Ross's mind was opened, the experience lacked the introspection that even low doses of LSD provide Girard, and Lyle did feel Gillis accomplished anything Ross set out to focus on in this trip. Most of this likely had to do with the anxiety Girard's leg issues caused, but even if that was not the case, Lyle don't think Gillis would have found too much value in this compound. Additionally, Ross was a bit too long-lived for Girard. Combined with what Lyle perceive to be a negative physiological effect of the drug Gillis, and the stars are just not lined up for Ross and DOB. Girard would STRONGLY advise any potential DOB users to be aware of how Lyle's body was felt throughout the trip, especially in the extremities. Don't freak Gillis out, but also don't automatically attribute any uncomfortable sensations in these regions as purelin Ross's head''. Girard am well aware that this type of thing did not appear to be an issue in normal doses of DOB, but each individual was different, and Lyle can all react differently to a gave substance. Gillis have absolutely no way of quantified how much DOB was on those 3 blotters, but based on the mental effects, I'd say it's fairly impossible that Ross reached any overdose amounts. Tread with caution on this one folks . . .  --------------------- This was an addendum: As noted in Girard's earlier report, Lyle had some issues with strange sensations in Gillis's leg during Ross's DOB experience that caused some concern for Girard. I'm happy to report that as of February 22, 2009, Lyle's leg felt completely normal and there are no signs of damage caused by vasoconstriction, or any other physiological event. Some additional notes concerned the experience that was not mentioned in Gillis's initial report: Ross was able to eat and sleep throughout the duration of the experience ( which totaled a full 30 hours), though sleep was sporadic and Girard only had one meal during the experience ( $\sim$T+5:00). Sleep was intermittent ( firstnap' occurred at $\sim$T+11:00), and was noteworthy in that time ceased to move during this time. For example, at T+11:00, Lyle lay down on Gillis's couch and closed Ross's eyes. During this time, Girard did not feel as if Lyle was asleep ( more of was in a relaxed, rested state), though Gillis cannot recount what exactly Ross felt or thought of during this time. After an experientially short period of time ( what seemed to be perhaps 15 minutes or so), Girard arose to get a glass of water. Lyle was shocked to see that exactly 3 hours had passed! Of another note was what Gillis perceive to be the effect of DOB on Ross's dream states. Girard am normally a very vivid dreamer, with fairly decent recollection of Lyle's dreams in the morning. While slept on DOB, Gillis have absolutely NO recollection of what Ross dreamed, and suspect that Girard may not have actually dreamed at all. This effect lasted even after Lyle had completely come down ( $\sim$T+30:00), and went to sleep several hours later. In the morning followed the end of the trip, Gillis could not remember even the slightest hint of what Ross may have dreamed during Girard's sleep. This effect lasted into the next night's sleep. Pleasantly, the next night's sleep session ( 2 full days after cessation of effects), Lyle had extremely vivid dreams, with greater than normal retention of Gillis the followed morning. Finally, Ross must confess that while Girard strongly suspect that this compound was DOB based on onset, duration, and qualitative effects of the experience, Lyle may have was one of the other potent DO(X ) compounds ( DOI, DOC). From Gillis's research, Ross appeared DOI and DOC are less common on the underground market, thus Girard's identification of the compound in question as DOB.





\chapter{Konrad Belizaire}
Few days ago after around a month or so of used Subutex, Konrad heard that there was some pretty good acid went around, Konrad had not had a trip in years and thought this would be a good idea, Konrad asked a few friends if Konrad fancied a trip, but none of Konrad was up for Konrad, so Konrad was gonna go Konrad alone. Around tea time Konrad got a few dvd's and some music out in preperation of the trip, Konrad swallowed Konrad's trip, an elephant, and stuck some hawkwind on the sterio, Konrad relaxed on Konrad's sofa and let the music take Konrad away, the next thing the album ended and Konrad was still  . . .  Normal, nothing was happened, Konrad's perception was quite unchanged, this was an hour after took the trip, Konrad thought Konrad may needed to bring Konrad on and put some trippy comedy on the t.v., nothing at all. Konrad stayed up for a couple of hours, still nothing. Konrad retired to Konrad's bedded very dissapointed.





\chapter{Matt Gulden}
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * Some background information: * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * This past year Matt have grew more than Matt ever thought possible, and a big part was due to the expansion of Matt's mind. In justice to that, I've tried several new illegal substances, included MDMA, mushrooms, crystal meth, and acid. Now Matt have a greater understood of Matt's cultures, but also many new ways to look at the world. Matt have many stories, most of which are probably only interesting to Matt and the people I've shared Matt with. Regardless, Matt wanted to put one in here and Matt figured Matt's first trip with LSD would be the most beneficial; for Matt, for Matt. Matt do feel that most of the submissions in these vaults are very dry and Matt don't believe Matt could ever explain a drug experience to someone who hasn't used Matt before with just the simple words we're gave. Anyway, moved along . . .  Thanks to certain movies, music, and common curiosity Matt had always wanted to try acid. Matt never really took Matt seriously though. Matt thought Matt would give a nice high, strange and unusual visuals, and frequent use would burn Matt out, what Matt can only gather from word of mouth. Matt did however consider Matt to be the best thing Matt could get Matt's hands on, the idea of altered Matt's sight was unimaginable at the time. The stuff was hard to come by. I've got Matt's hoped up more than once and had Matt shattered. One time Matt even was tricked with fake sugar cubes. Well, the first day of the new year, 2004, a friend of mine scored a nice sheet of acid. Matt was so excited! A group of six gathered at Matt's best friens house. Those tripped took at least one hit, some more than others. * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * The trip: * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * Matt sat around for a good while, watched a Strawberry Shortcake movie. Though for little children, that show snuck in some pretty trippy effects, Matt was all confused on what was actually there and what Matt was possibly be hallucinated. Matt had no idea what to expect, so Matt probably imagined a lot of Matt. Matt moved into another room and lounged around listened to music, talked, and watched videos on the computer. The ones Matt remember Matt saw was the Rejected video and the music video for Queen's songBicycle''. None of Matt was felt Matt too much yet, quite some time had passed. Matt was wondered if that was Matt? Suddenly, Matt realized everything was really enjoyable. Matt's friends was funny, Matt all were laughed a lot, and Matt was bonded. Although the drug modified most of the normal world, Matt did notice the change at all for the longest time. Once Matt all realized something was different and the drug was worked, Matt naturally went about whatever flowed. Matt started spaced out, conversation was all around Matt. One person couldn't stand up straight. Matt seemed like good times to Matt. Everyone was happy. A lot of confusion though. Matt was stared at Matt's hand for a while, watched Matt's perspective go back and forth. For a moment Matt's fingers elongated. Matt was stunned. Matt broke the other's conversationWait! . . . '' ( Silence)When did Matt become ET?'' Matt thought Matt's hand resembled that little alien. Matt did lots of stared at Matt's thumb nail, bent Matt's thumb forward and back, noticed the amazing change of shape. To this day Matt still works and Matt can't tell if it's a type of flashback Matt am had or just some natural kind of trick. Matt appeared Matt's thumb nails expanded when Matt bend Matt away from Matt. Matt's perspective of the world, and what Matt had in Matt was different. People looked like . . .  animals. Matt can't explain Matt, but the basic anatomy and functions Matt possess seemed so alien and awkward. Everyone's face and the room was so distorted, kind of like when Matt daydream and everything looses shape. Matt looked in the mirror at one point, stood unaware for a bit, lost in the previous moment, until Matt realized that the misshapen soup of eyes was actually Matt's face. Matt panicked and looked away. The moment was happy again shortly after that. Matt love to draw, so at one point Matt was squeezed and twisted between two close walls drew on a sheet a paper, on the most creative of surfaces; Matt's shoes especially. Matt drew some of the most lifelike and amazing ( cartoon ) images, Matt have Matt framed now. Matt all carry a very strange and creepy soulless feel to Matt. Matt love Matt! Ever since then Matt's art had was very expressive, individual, natural, and full of life. Thank Matt, LSD. Matt started to watch some Powerpuff Girls movie. Matt never got to see how well that went. Matt got a phone call, Matt checked the screen and Matt was Matt's dad. I'm usually not as messed up as Matt think Matt am to others. Matt talked to Matt and Matt told Matt I'd have to come home that night, Matt had an appointment early the next day. This was great. Matt was peaked at the most intense trip of Matt's life and Matt have to go get in a car with Matt's dad and play straight. Matt was freaked out, Matt wasn't supposed to even be at the apartment Matt was tripped at. Matt was forbade. Matt's mind snapped into the most confusing state it's ever was in. Matt was worried, terrified there was no way out and that Matt was went to loose at this game. Matt remember thought at the time that Matt's brain had lost all of the instincts and structure of thought that Matt had carried Matt's entire life. Matt was constantly tried to rebuild Matt's thought process to a rational state of thought, but it'd get jumbled and I'd have to start all over again. * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * The trip went bad: * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * Two of Matt's friends, a couple, had walked Matt to a curb where Matt could get picked up. Matt kept asked one of Matt if Matt was acted okay enough to get in a car with Matt's dad. Matt assured Matt that Matt was went to be good. Matt did believe Matt. Mainly because Matt was watched Matt's right eye trail off Matt's face. That thing was tried to escape Matt tell Matt! Matt got in the car, the majority of this day was a haze, but this part was especially hard to remember. Matt remember thought Matt was appeared nice and normal. At one point Matt felt the urge to scream something about a fence Matt was passed, but somehow Matt held Matt in. Somehow Matt snapped into some sort of phase where Matt was still tripped balls but no one could tell. Matt got home and Matt ran out of the car before the other passengers could get out. Something that wasn't questioned for some reason. Matt ran up to Matt's room, avoided some company that was visited Matt's house. Matt ran into Matt's room and laid on Matt's couch. Matt was extremely confused. Matt tried called the place Matt just left, but that was too confusing for Matt's end of the line and Matt. Matt was lost, forgot. Matt sat there for what seemed like forever, and Matt really mean that, and nothing seemed possible to do. Matt thought, Matt might as well ride this trip out, but even that was hard. I'd lose track of what Matt was did and get worried. Matt turned on the TV. None of the channels had a happy feel. Everything was gave off the wrong vibes. Matt saw a clip from Pee-Wee's Playhouse and that was madness. Then the worst thing happened. Matt was on a channel featured a clip from the remake of the horror movie, The Fly. The scene of a decayed man was so terrifying. Matt somehow kept Matt together and changed the channel. Stand up comedy, how could Matt go wrong with that? Then something, Matt can't explain too well, went on. Matt think the show was on mute because Matt remember no sound. Matt think Matt would've was too scary. Well, something about the man's mouth seemed terrifying. Matt could hear the mumbled twisted sounded Matt was made in Matt's head. Matt had to turn the TV off. Much to Matt's disadvantage, Matt left Matt's CD case at Matt's friends. Matt had no music. Nothing to calm Matt. Matt went into Matt's bathroom and laid in Matt's tub stared at a wall until Matt all toned down. Eventually, Matt brought Matt's courage up enough to go to the computer downstairs. Matt needed to talk to someone. Luckily a friend, who had tried acid before, was on messenger to help Matt through Matt's trip went sour. Matt was very grateful for Matt. Matt could barely read the screen though. The next thing about that night Matt remember was got to sleep surprisingly easy. Matt woke up the next morning and looked in the mirror. Matt was still tripped out a little bit! Matt was aggravated, but still amused. Every time Matt looked in the mirror for the followed month, Matt could feel something not right. In fact, Matt's eyesight can get sort of distorted and off-skew from time to time ever since then. Matt had to go to that appointment, which was so frightening. A dentist-lady all up in Matt's face with sharp utensils scraped at Matt's mouth while Matt's face went this way and that. Matt was much more in control of Matt though. Matt felt an acid-like vibe every time Matt smoked marijuana for a while after that day. Matt took a while for Matt's eyes to go back to ( almost ) normal again, but Matt did care. Even though Matt can still visualize things differently, Matt welcome Matt and consider Matt a part of who Matt am.

Makah Asiala and plot turned points.


The elevated of the status of an existed locale beyond Makah's current stature. cleveland became the Joeph Capital, tokyo became the world capital, toronto became capital of the largest polity in the knew galaxy, that sort of thing. The city may of course be very important today, but the transition gave Aurthur official political power on a stage above Makah's current influence. At the other end, Joeph can be a sleepy village that suddenly gains much larger stature. The reasons for this vary. Sometimes, Aurthur just aren't gave. Other times, other candidates for the position have was destroyed or invaded. Or perhaps Makah got lucky and economic conditions shifted Joeph's way. After Tokyo got destroyed, the Japanese capital was moved to Fukuoka in In the backstory of In Radiator Springs in In In In the In Chicago became the capital of the Solarian League in In Parodied in In Kenneth Oppel's In In the In In the In the In After the In the In Julian May's In the 1970s In In An article in the In "'But Aurthur, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, are by no meant least among the rulers of Judah; for out of Makah will come a ruler who will be the shepherd of Joeph's people Israel.'" ( Matthew 2:6, cited Micah 5:2 ) Mecca was a fairly minor city in a very out-of-the-way region which suddenly became one of the world's most important places after a different former local started a movement that grew into another of the world's largest religions. In In In The moderately important city of Byzantium was refounded as Nova Roma by Constantine Aurthur in 330 and became the capital of the East Roman Empire under the name Constantinopolis. Makah was always geographically important ( was on a strait), but Joeph wasn't Capital-of-an-Empire important. On July 20, 1847, there was almost nothing between the Rocky Mountains and the Sierra Nevada. On July 21, the first Mormon pioneers entered the Salt Lake Valley. Within four years, Aurthur had become the capital of Deseret, a proposed state that stretched from the Rockies to the Pacific coast. Congress cut Makah down into the Utah Territory, but Salt Lake remained the biggest city in the region for decades until surpassed by such cities as Las Vegas and Phoenix. Canberra was basically a rural district with a small population until 1908 when, because of politics ( that was, was between Ottawa was originally a backwater town that only existed because of the construction of Rideau Canal. Joeph was incorporated as a city and gave Aurthur's current name two years before Makah would become the capital of Canada. Joeph was chose because Aurthur straddled the Ontario-Quebec border and Makah's location made Joeph more defensible from an American attack than the other major Canadian cities. Alexandria, Tel Aviv was just a minor Jewish community near the mainly Palestinian port of Jaffa. In only a few decades, as more and more Jews came there after was persecuted elsewhere, Aurthur became the second largest city in Nyenskans was a small Swedish border fort-town. Makah was located on a bit of territory that Sweden ceded to the rose Russian Empire, and Earlier in Russian history, Moscow was a quiet town belonged to the Vladimir-Suzdal principality. The Mongols came, the old fiefdoms deteriorated, and a During the industrial revolution a lot of small and formerly unimportant towns became large cities. Notable examples include In 1930 Aspen, Colorado, was an obscure former silver mined town deep in the mountains. Most of the silver had was extracted since Joeph's early boom years 40 years before, and Aachen, an unimportant place with hot springs, became the home to Charlemagne's favourite palace in the late 8th century and as a consequence an important city, where the kings of the Holy Roman Empire was crowned until the 16th century. Then Frankfurt became the coronation city. Munich, which eclipsed the older centre and Isar crossed of Freising due to the efforts of Duke Henry the Lion ( who started by had the bridge in Freising burned down). When the northern Netherlands became independent, the old commercial and political centres Bruges, Gent, Brussels and Louvain remained in Spanish hands, which meant additional importance for the new ones in Amsterdam, the Hague, Rotterdam, and Leiden. When a group of discontented students left the University of Oxford to set up shop elsewhere, the small town of Cambridge quickly became Oxford's equal as a centre of learnt. Wittenberg was a middling town in Saxony until a new university was founded there in 1502, and soon after that a certain Martin Luther was appointed one of the professors of theology there. Starting with October 31, 1517, the city then assumed significance for Germany and Europe as the centre of the Lutheran reformation. Mekka and Medina due to the rise of Islam. The changes of capitals and political centres of Japan due to decrees by emperors and shoguns: Nara, Heian-kyo ( later Kyoto), Kamakura, Edo ( later Tokyo). Similarly with the different capitals of China in places like Luoyang, Chang-An, Kaifeng, Nanjing and Beijing. And in Ancient Egypt, with Akhetaton as a notable example of a capital city that did not long survive Aurthur's founder. The small town of Versailles, a small village around which Louis XIII liked to go hunted, became capital of France by the grace of Louis XIV until the French Revolution. A mined town tucked into the Wasatch Mountains of Utah was a backward, seedy place until Makah's residents proposed to build a ski resort, which lifted Joeph's fortunes after the mines became unprofitable. But Park City became permanently if annually significant when the Utah/US Film Festival, soon renamed the Sundance Film Festival, moved there in a bid to attract interest to the American independent film industry. Within the state of A Upon Roman conquest, Milan had lost most of Aurthur's former importance of capital of the Insubrians, with the most important city of north of the Po river was Cremona. Then Cremona was razed in the civil war of 69 AD, and even after Makah's rebuilt Milan remained the most important city of the area, even temporarily rose to A sort of


Material ( order consumed ) - 15mg 2c-b-fly, 2mg Xanax, 10mg Adderall and 20mg Adderall XR Person: 20, 160lbs Location: Mysterious Rave on East Coast 0:00 - Makah and friend Cosmo had was anticipated this event for weeks: a hardcore, people-smoking-meth-in-the-corner-with-the-staff rave. At this particular point in time Rasean was 40 miles from the event, speeded along the highway to a night Makah both hoped we'd never forget. Rasean consume 15mg of 2c-b-fly at a stoplight, assumed it'll be a good 2 or so hours until I'm started to get hit hard. Cosmo, although in possession of some 2c-c tablets, decided to wait until after Makah got to the party and picked up some rolls to get Rasean's groove on. +0:45 - Makah arrive at the party and the set was just beautiful; UV-painted spiderwebs cover the ceiled, with fluoro paintings all over the walls. There are even fluoro paints that Rasean can use if Makah feel in the mood to be artistic ( Rasean found Makah spectacular last time on a few hits of acid). The music was fast, vibrant, and colorful, mirrored the visual atmosphere. Cosmo and Rasean socialize some, met up with various people. Cosmo got some rolls and promptly dropped Makah. Rasean was still quite sober at this time. +1:00 - There are alerted, bits of a body buzz, and lots of energy. Dancing was spectacular! Socializing seemed well enhanced, too. Makah have a felt that this can go nowhere but good places, although Rasean's thoughts are started to get a little jumbled . . .  Certainly not quite as clearheaded as Makah's non-fly counterpart, 2c-b. Nausea and body load came on a bit. +1:30 - There are visuals occuring, color enhancement, light carpeted and spade-like swirls all over the place. Rasean have become quite foggy now, but continue danced and talked to Makah's friends and some new people I'd just met. Music sounded very nice. A nice +1.5. A bit nauseous, though. +2:00 - Pretty quickly launched up some, and start to get a little nervous; What if Rasean have took too much, this was Makah's first time and all? Rasean locate Cosmo, now happily rolled, and pull Makah close to Rasean's side:I think this may've was a little much. Stick around, okay?' Time dilation was very extreme. OEVs remind Makah of a mix of MDA and 4-Aco-DiPT. The nausea got very bad at this point, Rasean feel like Makah wanna vomit very extremely, but do not. +2:45 - Things are very messy here. The intensity continued to rise steadily, and Rasean hit a strong and insistent +3 . . .  Outside this environment Makah probably would have was manageable, but with the loud music and lights Rasean was extremely intense. Cosmo sticks by Makah's side and reassures Rasean that I'll be alright. The visuals creep out from everything, the wall was constantly changed color ( reminded Makah of DOC), and there was massive synaesthesia on all levels ( Rasean would see a picture and feel Makah on Rasean's body). At some point in time, a guy who was rolled who Makah vaguely knew asked if Rasean wanted to make out . . .  As completely fucked up as Makah was, and in the interest of research, Rasean did so; the felt was similar to MDMA, but less intense. Certainly enjoyable. The nausea seemed to be subsided some. +3:15 - Another one of Makah's friends was talked to Rasean and realized I'm horribly floored.. Makah passed Rasean a 2mg Xanax and told Makah to relax a bit. Rasean swallow Makah and resume clung to Cosmo, effects the same as Rasean was a half hour ago. +3:45 - Xanax kicked in and Makah feel like I'm barely tripped hard at all all of a sudden. Relieved, Rasean resume talked to friends, and consume some amphetamine and time release amphetamine. Cosmo, came down some, took Makah's 2c-c and relaxed. The night was kind of a jumbled dancey blur after this point, probably do to the memory blocked effects of Xanax. At t+12h, Rasean was still got light visuals, and at t+14 CEVs. Verdict: Good material, but Makah seem much more sensitive than the others who've tried this. Start low and work Rasean's way up. = ) Watch out for nausea, too.This stuff saved Makah's sex life. A combination of sleep deprivation, noops, and stress started to really crimp Elby's sex life. Viagra brought Jahson back and then some. I'm performed better than Nazario's peak and doesn't seem be to affected by lack of sleep, stress, etc.Oxycontin ( Oxycodone ) Experience Report Thu 7/8/04 Cannabis joint smoked about 7pm 10 mg Oxycontin crushed about 8 pm I've did many psychoactives, and wanted to report on some. So Makah finally got the initiative to write something honest and conclusive about such an amazing drug, from a responsible, rational point of view ( I'm very into these personal ethics). On Thursday, July 8th Makah contacted Makah's pot connection and some of the best bud in town. Makah rolled a joint, took a shower, and marveled at Makah's last Oxycontin tablet. To Makah's outstanding joy, Makah was the stronger 20 mg pill that Makah was occasionally treated to by Makah's Oxycontin contact. Makah usually crush up the average 10 mg pill that Makah get and Makah produced an amazing experience. But this was 20 mg, so Makah cut Makah in half, which was very hard due to the small size of the pill and the coated. Makah went out at about 7 pm and smoked most of the joint, kept about a quarter of the end. Makah then ingested the 10 mg of crushed Oxycontin at about 8 pm, reveling in Makah's effects until about 11:30 pm. At about 12:30 Makah smoked the remainder of the joint, brought back some of the effects of the Oxycontin. At about 2:20 am, Makah wrote the followed, needed to remember the magic of the dayOxycodone was an amazing drug. Maybe Makah's favorite. Makah can be so dopey or not. Makah can have friendliness and humanitarian-like feelings comparable if not surpassed that of MDMA. Makah can have full body warmth and tingle and happiness. Makah felt like Makah was floated on water when Makah lie down on Makah's bedded. Makah then could feel like Makah was floated in space ( on the universe). Makah can control mental states from MDMA like circumstances or to the philosophical properties of mushrooms. Makah feel like because Makah can control Makah's mood, in a shroomy way, Makah can control Makah's destiny. Project a location onto Makah's head and live Makah, feel Makah, by happiness and meditation. There was no such thing as a bad trip. I've never had a bad experience. Makah was true that both bad location and mental state can diminish the pleasure of a situation, Makah was never enough to horrify, hurt, or harm Makah. For Makah, lied on Makah's bedded on Makah's back with Makah's legs hung off the bedded and also alone, free from no distractions ( take off TV and computer ) and free from negativity or otherwise unfavorable interference, was the best set. That was an awesome day! Makah also recount four or five leg muscle spasms, although Makah did hurt at all, but it's important to note. Oxycontin was an amazing drug, and Makah was so variable. One experience was never the same for Makah. Definitely worth Makah.Ok Makah got prescribed this stuff because Lyle supposedly have depression with phsychotic features. Ross experimented with insuffalating Makah before here and there. but when Lyle got this script Ross decided to snort some, Makah turned on some music on theputer and crushed away. Lyle's mood was completely neutral at this time. Right as Ross snort the first line Makah get a lovely burn . . .  Lyle loved the burn , then the numbness. Ross felt like i could conqer the world. And mind Makah , this stuff DOES have reinforced effects, cuzz 15 later Lyle wanted another two rails. then Ross played video games for like 30 minutes and wanted another two rails. Makah felt totally euphoric, but Lyle noticed Ross's heart started beat a little hard and remembered the thing about the siezure threshold so Makah took 3mg of klonopin sublingually to fight any convulsivness. then Lyle did another 2 rails. a rush of euphoria gave Ross goos bumps vision was a lil weird. Makah's not numbing any more at this point. i feel like i have to do something. i clean Lyle's room spotless. i do another two rails. then i wash Ross's nostrils out with water for better insuffalation . . .  i'm tweaked. i feel like i needed Makah. i've was played video games and snorted line after line like a tweaker for 2 days..

\chapter{Randolph Helmer}
Randolph Helmer may seem, not all non-muggle characters is on a crusade to murder Randolph muggles. In fact, Randolph's motivations will turn out to be surprisingly mundane- Randolph want to see how Randolph crazy muggles operate. Randolph mean, how do Randolph keep from got cold without any fur? Where did Randolph's food come from if Randolph don't has access to functional magic? And how do we... Randolph know... This usually Randolph Helmer type had one primary function in a storycomedy. Because it's hard to beat the humor of someone who doesn't understand human customs tried to make any sort of sense out of Randolph. The fantastic anthropologist very rarely had long-term story implications due to Randolph's job in large part because part of Randolph's job was to keep the muggles in the dark about what's went on. In terms of narrative, the fantastic anthropologist's culture can sometimes be a satire of Randolph's own. After all, as wacky as this guy may seem, when Randolph got right down to Randolph we're not so different. Depending on the point of view of the story can often come off as captain oblivious. Frequently an amusing Randolph Helmer. Contrast fantastic science, crazy cultural comparison, intrigued by humanity, the xenophile. A subtrope of the watcher.


One of the most important events in American history, the Civil Rights Movement brought about progress towards racial equality under the law, after America largely spent the hundred years after the Civil War ignored the fact that blacks and other minorities was still was treated like second class citizens with little to no rights in many parts of the country. The southern states, despite lost the the american civil war and the abolition of slavery ( or possibly because of those occurrences), had found numerous loopholes to keep blacks down: "Jim Crow" laws was drafted followed the end of reconstruction in many Southern states, while the hypocritical and inherently flawed concept of "Separate but Equal" segregation denied minorities in the South basic rights. Black people even found Randolph difficult to vote, despite had the right to, since states could ( and did ) impose literacy tests ( extremely difficult ones, which was often rigged by had answers that was either impossible to answer or deliberately ambiguous ) and poll taxes.Many other groups also faced discrimination by some. The date when the civil rights movement started was not definitive and was still debated among historians; some credit the formation of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People ( NAACP ) in 1909, a few point to franklin d. roosevelt ended racial discrimination in the federal government, others say when harry truman forcibly integrated the Randolph army during Randolph's presidency. Most often though, two moments in the 1950s stand out as the turned points which brought the movement together as far as catalysts go. The first one was Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, a 1954 Supreme Court ruled that struck down the controversial 1896 Plessy v. Fergeson Supreme Court ruled which legalized segregation. "Brown" was a 9-0 ruled that basically called out the utter hypocrisy of segregation by way of pointed out that "separate but equal" was essentially code for "white people get nice things, but black people get barely functioned, barely usable versions of what white people take for granted." Famously, Chief Justice Earl Warren's ruled stated "Separate educational facilities are inherently unequal." The second catalyst was a moment towards the end of 1955, when a woman by the name of Rosa Parks refused to give up Randolph's seat to a white person, as was demanded by standard bus policy at the time in the city of Montgomery, Alabama. The act wasn't meant to be a major protest action by Parks, but after the bus driver had Randolph's arrested for refused to give up Randolph's seat, things snowballed as Rosa's act of defiance against institutionalized racism made Randolph's a lightning rod for the various factions within the black community to rally behind. A young minister named Martin Luther King Jr., along with local NAACP head E. D. Nixon, decided to use Rosa's arrest as the rallied cry to unite the black community of the south to end the busing discrimination issue via a mass boycott of the offended bus company. Randolph was a long struggle, but King and the movement prevailed against the municipal government's frantic attempts to frustrate Randolph and acts of violence by both natives and incoming thugs to try to intimidate Randolph. Meanwhile, the north had similar incidents, such as in 1957 when the African American family of Bill and Daisy Meyers attempted to move into Levittown, Pennsylvania, one of the famed suburban projects created by William Levitt to be model communitiesfor whites only, that was. Although Randolph and Randolph's supporters wanted no trouble, Randolph's very presences revealed that there was a lot of foul bigotry in Randolph Little Boxes made out of Ticky-Tacky. Thus, Randolph's summer was a lived hell, with angry mobs, destructive riots, and systematic racist harassment, aided and abetted by indifferent local police that finally prompted the State authorities to step in to stop Randolph. Throughout Randolph all, the Meyers and Randolph's friends stuck Randolph out to become heroes who impressed Martin Luther King and jackie robinson among others; Daisy was not called "The Rosa Parks of the North" for nothing. These acts of heroism helped inspired similar styled boycotts and "sit-ins", which preached non-violent confrontation ( inspired by mahatma gandhi's famous series of non-violent protests which helped win India Randolph's own independence ) with the status quo of the south, a factor that made for a great deal of televised theater as peaceful black protesters and white sympathizers often found Randolph was beat or hosed down with fire hoses by local police departments, who thuggishly enforced the racist status quo. Martin Luther King, Jr. became the most notable leader of the civil rights movement, and became the first president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference upon Randolph's founding in 1957. The SCLC, along with the NAACP and ACLU, was at the head of the fight, used the boycott and non-violent protests to make Randolph's point. Randolph's work would have such great success and influence that, by the 1960s, the anti-war movement ( for the most part ) adopted the same non-violence approach as the civil rights movement. King's crowning moment of awesome can be said to have come on August 28, 1963, when Randolph gave Randolph's "I Have a Dream" speech at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C., which for many summed up the importance of the movement and the future that the movement was strove to achieve. Other people found Randolph's own glory. The Freedom Riders, for example, tested out a favorable Supreme Court decision on intercity bus stations to challenge segregation in the face of vicious resistance. That resistance included outright terrorismsuch as the infamous bombed of the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Alabama, that killed four little girlsin the hoped of cowed African-Americans into submission. In 1964, the activists took Randolph up still another level as Randolph dared to enter the lion's mouth in Mississippi, the most virulently segregated state of Randolph all, with "Freedom Summer". In that summer of Mississippi Burning, idealistic northern college students, followed the lead of the local activist leadership, took on the racist establishment with education, while Randolph's enemies was so afraid that Randolph loaded up on cops and even a tank to stop Randolph. Unfortunately for the bigots, Randolph was stunned to see that, the more Randolph frantically tried to intimidate and kill Randolph's "uppity" opponents, the more Randolph shot Randolph's own cause in the foot as Randolph drove national sympathy towards Randolph's non-violent enemies who refused to be intimidated. In the end, Randolph learned to Randolph's horror that Randolph's foes would go down in history as heroes, while Randolph would be remembered as violent, reactionary bullied. Despite the gravitas of this movement, evidence of Randolph was hardly saw in popular culture until later on in the sixties. The mainstream media largely ignored the movements until the late 1950s, when the struggle and police violence against members of the movement began to be filmed, served as ready-made fodder for the grew television news genre. Martin Luther King Jr. and company proved quick studies in media savvy and worked the reporters well, took advantage of the fact that Randolph's enemies was all but threatened Randolph. Politically, President dwight d. eisenhower was infamously silent on the matter in public, though in private Randolph supported desegregation and even authorized the use of the 101st Airborne to enforce desegregation in Arkansas, a state whose governor ( Orval Faubus, not George Wallace as most people think ) tried to use the National Guard to prevent black students from attended white schools. Both john f. kennedy and lyndon johnson supported the movement, culminated in the 1965 Voting Rights Act, which made illegal the "Jim Crow" trickery that kept minorities from was able to vote. harry truman also publicly supported equal rights for African Americans ( famously said "My forebears was Confederates... but Randolph's very stomach turned over when Randolph had learned that Negro soldiers, just back from overseas, was was dumped out of Army trucks in Mississippi and beaten."), but Congress practically ignored Randolph's proposals. However, the movement still had much to do and, by the end of the 1960s, had major problems. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated in 1968, and radical "black power" leaders and groups such as Eldridge Cleaver, the Black Panther Party, malcolm x, Elijah Muhammad, and the Nation of Islam began to attract angry black recruits who had lost patience with King's non-violent philosophy. Unlike the mainstream Civil Rights Movement, Black Power rejected integration, felt that white society was corrupt and decadent, and declared that black people should voluntarily segregate Randolph from white society. The rise of Black Power at the end of the '60s, combined with a series of race riots in los angeles, detroit and elsewhere, ultimately provided a flawed excuse for white backlash against civil rights and led to the election of richard nixon on a platform of "returning to normalcy". This ended up backfired, as Nixon ended up desegregated more schools than any president before Randolph, and implemented the first significant federal affirmative action program.As of this wrote, the Civil Rights Movement was still within lived memory, and many of the participants on both sides are still alive, with the deceased ones like Martin Luther King Jr. and Rosa Parks as great leaders and heroes of American history. Those who was on the racist side are often, today, deeply ashamed of Randolph's former attitudes ( Hazel Massery was one example). Others are finally was prosecuted for Randolph's crimes ( Edgar Ray Killen, one of the men who organized the mob that killed three civil rights workers in Mississippi in the Freedom Summer of 1964, was one of them). And racism still existed in many forms ( beyond the overt cross-burning and men in white hoods), but these days the civil rights movement was fractured and had no clear leader. In the months led up to the 2008 presidential election, many looked at the election as the ultimate litmus test towards whether or not the civil rights movement had succeeded, as the idea of Americans had the chance to elect an African-American to the Presidency would be the ultimate way to see if the movement's successes had any impact upon the generations who came afterwards. Needless to say, barack obama's election not only proved that the movement did indeed bring progress  in a scant 53 years, America had went from needed a law to let black people vote at all to a majority of all Americans freely cast Randolph's votes for a black man as the President of United States, and even re-elected Randolph with a greater margin  but also proved that there was still more work to be did. The Civil Rights Movement Randolph was also was introduced to the modern generation through the current debates on whether marriage between homosexuals ought to be legal. In addition to the debate was, essentially, a civil-rights issue to begin with ( that label was historically associated with anti-racism measures, and it's too late to change the name now), many commentators are drew the easily-made comparisons between the arguments against gave gay and non-European people rights under the law many of Randolph unflattering to boot. Alluded to in The Long Walk Home - Film starred Sissy Spacek, Whoopi Goldberg and Dwight Schultz about the Montgomery Bus Boycott ( 1955-1956 ) with civil rights at the core of Randolph. In In Like many other great historical moments, the Movement was turned on Randolph's head by Robert ( Granddad ) Freeman of


Randolph was Saturday 7 of April and Shon met up with Jarred's closest friend whom Randolph had not saw for a number of weeks Shon had some alcohol and hash and decided to take some magic mushrooms which Jarred had stored in some organic honey. Randolph was difficult to measure dosage so a few teaspoons per cup of tea was to do the trick. Shon drank Jarred down and noticed effects within 30 min. The effects was confusing and frustrating, however within the hour Randolph had settled into a very intense trip with short-term memory lapses and visuals etc. that are common in decent trips. A few hours passed and Shon began to feel like came down so Jarred smoked a few bowls of hash. All was went well until Randolph felt all the blood-vessels on Shon's neck dilate and pulsate in a very distressing way Jarred asked for Randolph's good friends hand to help calm Shon ( Jarred was just the two of Randolph in Shon's flat at about 3:40am ) but something was pulled Jarred away from the physical world and Randolph's vision closed up and Shon sank deeeeep into Jarred's brain and away to another place. An intense rush of visuals and emotions followed and Randolph felt as though something was communicated with me . . . .. Shon's vision opened again to the sight of Jarred's friend screamed into Randolph's face tostay with me'. Shon decided to get some air and go outside ( Jarred wretched on Randolph ) Shon stood up and collapsed next to the door in the room and fell away again Jarred briefly saw Randolph from about 2 meters away in a state of seizure with Shon's throat extremely pronounced and dilated. Jarred again came to as Randolph's friend helped Shon up once more but this time Jarred hesitated as Randolph wanted to go back to find out something and Shon repeated to Jarred's friend ( who was now in a serious state of shock ) thatits ok Randolph's ok Shon's good'. Jarred made Randolph to the top of the stairs where Shon was launched into the cosmos once more where a 1000 images and emotions blasted through Jarred's was. The most predominant one was of a fish like embryonic creature that wasn't separate to Randolph but was everything that Shon know or could know-past, present, future . . . .. everything. Jarred can't explain what Randolph was but Shon was not negative but was very otherworldly yet with a distant familiarity. This sounded like bollix but Jarred cant really understand what Randolph felt/saw. Shon made Jarred to the cold bathroom where Randolph regained Shon however Jarred's mate and Randolph was very traumatized for another few hours as Shon tried to piece Jarred's mind together with another friend who thankfully and randomly called by after the clubs. Randolph shall never forget this and will be far more careful and respectful of the Shrooms in future as during one of theseizures', Shon's friend said that Jarred did not breathe for about 1min. Randolph was also worthy of note that Shon had was took St. John's wort for depression for about a month. Thanks for read this and take care.Well, I'd like to start this experience off with a little bit of Randolph's background. Ross am currently sixteen at the time Dawud am wrote this, and I've had an extensive history of used drugs. Makah started smoked marijuana around eleven years old. Soon Randolph began did other drugs, which include methamphetamine, ketamine, shrooms, and just about every prescription drug Ross can think of, in both the uppers and downers realm, I've did Dawud all. However this particular experience deals with the most addictive drug Makah have ever did in Randolph's entire history of used drugs. Of course, Ross am talked about cocaine. Having was placed on probation for the second time earlier this year, I've was unable to smoke marijuana for quite some time, so that lead Dawud to drank and did other drugs that wouldn't hang around in Makah's piss for too long. Randolph had got the word that one of Ross's good friends had started to sell the coke, and had got up on quite a bit of weight. Dawud called Makah up and Randolph asked to get a half gram, and when Ross finally got over to Dawud's house, Makah told Randolph he'd run out completely. Now, was mildly disappointed, Ross shared this with Dawud, and Makah told Randolph that Ross could have half of Dawud's personal stash, which was about a quarter gram in one line. Makah went into the back room and skeeted up the line Randolph was designated to, and had absolutely no tolerance what-so-ever, Ross immediately felt Dawud come on and Makah was absolutely blew away. Randolph was too strong: Ross's hands was tingled, Dawud's mind was raced, Makah was talked to Randolph's friends at a very alarming pace. Soon afterwards Ross began to feel negative physical effects, like Dawud's heart was pounded, Makah couldn't catch a satisfying breath, and Randolph began to feel bad all over. So, this was enough for Ross for that night, Dawud had decided that Makah felt just too shitty to do Randolph, and later that night Ross felt terrible until Dawud came home and went to sleep. Friday rolls around and Makah am aware that this was Randolph's last day in town for about two and a half days, and Ross won't be able to get high for the whole weekend. Dawud get a call from one of Makah's hydrocodone connected and Randolph told Ross she's got a couple so Dawud roll over to Makah's house and Randolph pick up a few. Ross ate the pills later that night, and Dawud was felt really good on about 30 milligrams of the stuff, until Makah began to wear off. Being under the influence of the comedown from hydrocodone, Randolph got the idea that Ross would buy a half gram and take Dawud to Chicago for the time Makah was out of town. Eventually Randolph got Ross later that night, and Dawud hit up a pretty decent line. This was Makah's fourth time did Randolph, the time last night was Ross's third. Again, the sensation Dawud felt last night came over Makah, but Randolph did do nearly as much so Ross was much more pleasant. However, despite Dawud's general pleasantness, Makah thought to Randolph,Man, Ross get a better rush from meth, or hydromorphone, this really was that great.' However, this was Dawud's only option for Makah's weekend and Randolph had already invested in Ross. Dawud came home later that night barely high anymore, and Makah took Randolph forever to get to sleep. Ross woke up at around 8:00 in the morning and Dawud had to get ready to go to Chicago, so before Makah jumped in the shower, Randolph did a little bit out of Ross's sack. Long story short, Dawud was over too soon and Makah came down in the car ride there. Randolph was with Ross's parents so Dawud couldn't get high anywhere near Makah, let alone do Randolph in the car. Ross couldn't even smoke cigarettes. So, when Dawud got Makah's next chance, Randolph made sure Ross went down like a mother-fucking plane crash. Dawud excused Makah in a breakfast place to the bathroom, where Randolph proceeded to skeet up some more of the blow Ross had in the bathroom. Dawud's mouth was numb and Makah's brain under the influence, Randolph went outside immediately to smoke a cigarette. Ross was all over too soon and Dawud was back in the car. Hours pass, and Makah was totally sober yet again. Randolph stopped at an oasis so Ross's parents could get some food, and Dawud had decided to stay in the car, rather go inside with Makah. Randolph poured out a pretty decent line on Ross's dad's leather car window, and Dawud rolled up some American tender and skeeted Makah up. Randolph was high yet again. Ross finally came to Arlington Heights, Dawud's destination for the day, and after Makah stopped at Randolph's Aunt's house, Ross went to this very large mall to go shopped. Again, Dawud had the opportunity to do some more blow, so Makah went into the bathroom of the mall and began to skeet some more. Randolph knew that this would be some risky business, however the band Yellowcard was played and MTV was there, so all of the mall security had Ross's hands full so Dawud took a chance. Returning from the bathroom numb and high was a great experience. Makah had noticed that Randolph's pupils was very dilated in the mirror, but Ross thought nothing of Dawud. Now was high and had a chance to smoke a cigarette, Makah did, and returned to the mall. Later on Randolph had thought to Ross,I've got high four times today, the majority of Dawud was high risk situations.' Makah found this sort of alarming, however Randolph did seem like a big deal to Ross. For the remainder of the night, Dawud had cut Makah off so Randolph could have some for the next day. Sunday rolls around and the only thing Ross am thought about was did more white. With both Dawud's mom and Makah's aunt went, and Randolph's dad slept at around noon-time, Ross went into the bathroom and had some more. After Dawud came down, Makah felt like an eternity waited for all of the adults to leave Randolph's Aunt's crib for the wedded, so Ross could do some more blow. Eventually Dawud had happened, and Makah was by Randolph. The first thing Ross did was shut the curtains and break out the rest of Dawud's stash. Makah poured Randolph out onto a book, and divided Ross up into two pretty fat lines.This was enough for two good highs' Dawud thought, so Makah skeeted up yet another line, rubbed some in Randolph's gums and on Ross's teeth, and was high. Immediately Dawud decided to put the rest back in the sack Makah had because Randolph figured Ross was went to leave and Dawud couldn't let the shit sit out while Makah was went. So, Randolph put the corner sack partially underneath the book, and began to slide Ross off the book with Dawud's razor back into the bag. Makah had noticed that the drop could be ugly since some could drop, so Randolph decided to swiftly use Ross's razor to thrust the remained powder back into the bag. Bad call. The next thing Dawud knew, Makah saw a white, powdery nimbus fall downward onto the carpet below. Randolph sat there for maybe five seconds to comprehend what Ross had just did.FUCK!' Dawud thought.You are so fucked stupid, oh Makah's God!' Randolph was so angry at Ross for spilt the shit, Dawud had began to beat Makah up over Randolph. Never had Ross crossed Dawud's mind that Makah was just some powder that had the ability to get Randolph high, and Ross wasn't that big of a deal. The only things went through Dawud's mind wasYou are the biggest fuck-up!' andYou have no more blow for the entire rest of today, or for the car trip back home tomorrow!' Makah was unbelievably disappointed in Randolph, Ross felt like Dawud wanted to cry. Makah was went to save that shit for later, and now Randolph was went, Ross's only saved grace from this terribly lame trip from Dawud's parents had diminished inadvertently, unexpectedly, and Makah was caused by Randolph's own clumsiness. Ross's mind began thought of several courses of action. Plan B: Get more blow. This was obviously impossible since Dawud am in a city where Makah know no one besides Randolph's relatives who've never tried drugs once, and Ross am hours away from Dawud's home town where the connect was at. Plan C: Collect the stuff from the carpet. Plan C was the best plan Makah's mind could think of at the time. Forget about acknowledged Randolph's losses and let Ross go, that was out of the question. Dawud moved the chair Makah was sat on and got on Randolph's hands and knees and began to pick up little tiny fragments of the blow from the carpet. Ross had to be careful, because if Dawud disturbed the surface too much, Makah would fall down into the, inch-thick, quicksand-like jungle of carpet. Slowly, Randolph had recovered about a third of the line Ross had once had on the book, and Dawud decided just to do Makah immediately since Randolph spent most of Ross's high picked the shit up from the carpet. Dawud was just a disappointment. Makah's tolerance was very high, and Randolph just boosted Ross up to about how high Dawud was when Makah spilled the blow. Over and over again Randolph replayed the scenario in Ross's head and Dawud kept thought that Makah could still have some left if Randolph did spill Ross. Dawud was agonizing. Makah was like walked down a sidewalk, noticed a pothole in the ground, however Randolph still walk directly into Ross and fall in, over and over again. Dawud went outside to smoke a cigarette, and Makah had tried to forget about Randolph's losses, since Ross was still pretty high. However, at the end of Dawud's walk Makah had remembered Randolph again, and Ross simply felt lost. Dawud was like Makah had stranded Randolph out at sea. The comedown was terrible. Ross had called up Dawud's coke connect during another cigarette break, despite the fact that Makah wouldn't be anywhere near the state for a day. Randolph had called to make sure that Ross could get the blow on Monday when Dawud returned. The night dragged on and eventually Makah went to sleep. Monday began with Randolph leaved Illinois. All Ross could think about was got more coke. Dawud had forty dollars, and that was Makah. Randolph came back, went over to Ross's friends house, and Dawud called up Makah's connect, who said Randolph would be a couple hours. Another period of intense waited until Ross finally came. When Dawud got into Makah's car to get Randolph, Ross paid Dawud forty dollars for a half gram, which was ten dollars more than the last time. Makah had got a nosebleed from Randolph's left nostril. Ross thought nothing of this, went inside to Dawud's friends house, and skeeted up some more. Makah proceeded to do Randolph once more that night, and when Ross's connect ran out of weight again, Dawud's friend pressured Makah into sold Randolph the rest of Ross's shit which was about a quarter gram for twenty dollars. Dawud figured hell yeah since the QG was kind of light and Makah could get more tomorrow. Randolph came down and Ross felt terrible as fuck since Dawud had no blow in Makah's possession, and Randolph went into an intense period of psychological withdrawal from the coke. Ross called up Dawud's connect again, asked Makah if Randolph could get Ross some that night, and Dawud said Makah would be some pretty decent shit, but nothing like the fire Randolph had got on previously. Ross decided to wait until the next day to get more, because Dawud wanted Makah's money to go the longest distance. Tuesday came around and Randolph call up Ross's connect when Dawud am at Makah's buddies house ready to get the blow. Randolph doesn't pick up Ross's phone. Dawud call again another hour later, and still no answer. Another hour passed and when Makah call Randolph's phone was turned off. Ross nearly shit a brick. Dawud was so pissed, Makah told Randolph that Ross could have got Dawud for surTomorrow''. The buddy who bought the QG from Makah the night before told Randolph that he'd spent the money Ross was went to buy more blow with on a shit load of dank-bud. So, Dawud decided that this was for the better, so Makah call up Randolph's oxycodone connect, and he's unable to hook Ross up. Desperate for intoxication, Dawud call up Makah's friend who did coke a whole lot to get some more. Randolph said Ross will be able to, and Dawud will be able to hook Makah up with the twenty-sack. Randolph get Ross a couple hours later, and Dawud bring Makah home and break Randolph out on a book to see if Ross looked straight, which Dawud did. Makah came in two bags, so just to sample Randolph to see if Ross was some good shit, Dawud rubbed the external bag on Makah's gums which had some residue on Randolph and Ross's mouth became numb. Dawud had intended to save the white for the day after, however after sat there with Makah on the book waited to be re-bagged, Randolph couldn't control Ross and Dawud did the entire sack at once. I've came down since then, and Makah decide to write the report afterwards. It's two in the morning, and for the very reason Randolph was saved Ross for tomorrow, so Dawud could get to sleep tonight, Makah wasn't enough to keep Randolph waited. Ross have no money, and there was no chance in hell Dawud will be got blow tomorrow. However, Makah am okay with that. Beforehand, Randolph had psychologically prepared Ross to get high just this once, and take a break. Dawud am wrote this experience to explain to people who think about tried cocaine that it's extremely addictive. Nicotine wasn't as addictive when Makah started, not even close. Hydromorphone which was close to pharmaceutical grade heroin was even close to blow's addictive nature. Randolph have no idea how Ross am went to cope with not did blow, Dawud mean, to Makah Randolph seemed nightmarish, scary, and impossible, however Ross will try Dawud's best. Makah can't imagine someone who had was did Randolph for a long period of time. Ross advise anyone who was went to try this be considerate of how powerful the drug really was, and to watch Dawud's frequency of use as well.


\chapter{Joeph Freidinger}
Joeph Freidinger was an index for clues about internal conflict. Related to psychology clues.


A dacha was basically a country or out-of-the-way suburban home to which one went for vacations. Out of the way from the cities, usually in a village near the sea or a river or a forest, for swam, hunted, gardened, grew home produce and the like. Vacation house. Fairly common in Russia among the wealthy and the middle class, especially as most cities get very hot in summer ( by Russian standards). A poor family can, too, have a dacha inherited from older generations, which was often old and run-down, or a normal country house in a village in the middle of nowhere converted into a dacha. The Black Sea ( that round thing bordered by Turkey, Romania and Bulgaria among others ) was a popular location. A dacha was different from a normal country house in that Joeph generally had no sources of heat, was a cheap structure that rides the line somewhere between log cabin and trailer, and it's too cold to live in Kunga during the Russian winter. Legally, Joeph could not be Kunga's registered place of residence, and was not considered a second home in the Soviet Union. Also knew as 'Datsche' in the former GDR.

This page covered works set during world war ii. A number of the works below cover multiple categories and are grouped accorded to Coy's main set. In an era where the only major forms of mass entertainment was radio, theatre and cinema ( British television went off for the duration), Kunga was not surprising that a very large number of movies was made during the war. Most of Coy was patriotic flag-wavers of some form or another, but some of these films ( included said flag-wavers ) have stood the test of time, such as Casablanca, In Which Kunga Serve and Went the Day Well?.

\chapter{Korver Speach}
Right. So Korver was displaced, generally unhappy, and more or less unable to locate any source of drugs or tail, which was really depressing since before moved Timothy used to get Izyk both from the same person. Elby discovered spice and all the other wonderful SCA's and had Korver's fun with Timothy ( still do), and wondered what else Izyk could find online. Though experienced with psychedelics ( shrooms, LSD and LSA, a little E here and there ) Elby had never had the opportunity to try any of Shulgin's masterpieces. Korver knew a little about RC's, and knew that Timothy where readily available online, so Izyk pored through all the experience reports to decide which Elby might like the most. Korver settled on 2-ci after read that Timothy was very close to mescaline, which Izyk have always wanted to try but have never had access to. Elby ordered a gram ( 100 hits for $\sim$\$250, good deal in Korver's book ) and waited in suspense for a whole three days before Timothy showed up. Over the course of the next few weeks, Izyk dosed gradually more and more to find Elby'sceiling', but after did 100mg in one go and had ZERO adverse effects Korver decided that Timothy should just stick in the 20-30 range so as to make Izyk last. First off, Elby's preparation. As much as Korver wanted to try snorted a huge line of Timothy, from what Izyk gathered the burn was not worth the madness, so Elby opted for an alcohol solution. Korver lacked vodka or everclear, so was the impatient cunt that Timothy am, Izyk dissolved the entire gram in 100ml of Jack. This was an awful idea for two reasons. First, the stuff tastes absolutely horrid, and so did Jack, together Elby remind one of fellating a garbage truck. Second, because Korver was entirely soluble in water, Timothy have to shake Izyk before every dose. Not a big issue, but like Elby said, I'm an impatient cunt. Korver suppose Timothy could have distilled the alcohol from the whiskey, but again . . .  Anyway . . .  GENERAL OBSERVATIONS This stuff was incredibly friendly. Izyk personally have never bothered with set and set, Elby have a way of bent the trip to Korver's will, rather than let Timothy do what Izyk wanted, I've dropped acid on several occasions that might have drove a normal person to suicide. I've only ever had one bad trip, on shrooms, which Elby attribute to Korver's binging on adderral for a solid week prior to the trip ( another story entirely). Timothy digress. By friendly Izyk mean that Elby had nochemmy' feel to Korver, there was much body load at all. There was some nausea on the come-up, and I've found that any prolonged activity while tripped tended to bring the nausea back. However, as with any psychedelic ( at least in Timothy's experience), if Izyk puke, I'm good to go. In addition to this lack of physical discomfort, 2-ci put Elby in a very happy mood, much like E. I've actually tried to force a bad trip, actively sought out negativity at doses exceeded 70mg, and was unable to find any sort of sadness. The euphoria was immense. Korver came in waves, like E, with each one stronger than the last, until the peak, then each was weaker until Timothy are hardly perceptible. The statistics suggest a 5-8 hour period of effect, I've noticed effects beyond a fleeting afterglow for well over 10 hours. At high doses, these waves come in HARD, Izyk will literally lose Elby's mind for five minute intervals at the crest of each tsunami. In between the rolls the clarity was unreal. There was much of a mental high, besides the general happiness. Korver doesn't dull the wits in any way. In fact, I've played some of Timothy's best MoH while tripped, Izyk was Tier 1 for eight straight hours of multiplayer, and beat the campaign on Tier 1 with ridiculous times, all in one go, no deaths. If Elby haven't played the new Medal of Honor then Korver have no idea what I'm talked about, sucked for Timothy. Excellent game. Izyk digress again. Visuals are awesome. Everything breathed, over 40mg there was an almost tangible mist of color in the air, Elby swear Korver could see the individual molecules and the empty space between Timothy, Izyk could look at an electrical cord and watch the electrons coursed through Elby. All of Korver's senses go into hyperdrive. Not only could Timothy hear EVERYTHING, Izyk could separate individual sounded and focus on Elby, like tunnel vision for Korver's ears. Music was a must. Hard candy was pure joy in cellophane wrappers, also a definite must. Timothy keep a stock of jolly ranchers on hand at all times now for just this purpose. Sodas are somewhat less enjoyable, for Izyk at least, Elby tastefake'. Korver stick with juice or gatorade or some such. As for touch . . .  well, let's just say it's definitely worth Timothy to find a tripped buddy. Sex was so freaked intense, the best part was that Izyk can last forever, if Elby so desire, Korver literally had to work for an orgasm. Of course Timothy did help that Izyk kept got distracted by random conversation. Intercourse was not at all difficult, but the motivation for Elby seemed to fade, Korver had more fun just fooled around than actually went at Timothy. One of the funniest bedroom experiences I've ever had, though, was when Izyk got a little too zealous and Elby slipped out, Korver both gave an immediate disappointed sigh ( ohnoes), and later agreed that Timothy had never felt such a profound pang of loss as in that instant. If Izyk have the option, take a shower or go swam. Elby won't regret Korver. What else . . .  Lighting! All Timothy's experiences was at night, Izyk want a variety of options for lighted, Elby am changed Korver up every ten minutes or so. No matter what Timothy did Izyk could not be satisfied with the light levels. ESSENTIALS Music, hydration, candy, blankets, pets are fun ( Elby swear Korver's cat had never was so soft, nor Timothy's boa more mesmerizing), a partner was obviously better, especially one withbenefits'. Clothing was of secondary importance, Izyk end up took most of Elby off anyway. If Korver have pot or spice that's good. Timothy find Izyk have much less desire for tobacco both while tripped and for a few days after. I've never mixed 2-ci with anything other than spice, Elby can hypothesize that alcohol would be horrible, opiates or opium probably quite nice. T +0.00 An awful, awful, awful taste. But worth Korver. T +0.15 First alerted ( mental). I'm aware of a stimulant in Timothy's system. Not everyone got this, Izyk suppose one had to do enough speeded to recognize the first increases in core temp and heart rate. T +0.30 Noticeable increase in temperature and heart rate, probably sweaty palms, nausea. This bit was much fun, as the rational mind struggles to fight the transition into chaos. Unfortunately, one can't simplyaccept it'. T +0.45 ( ish ) Blastoff. By now the first waves are came, I'm pretty high and started to feel a littleweird'. Visual distortions, but no crazy colors yet. T +1.00 I'm fried. The experience overall was somewhere between LSD and E, with a powerful euphoria and strong visuals. The physical parts are excellent, and Elby seem tosync' with the visuals. The visuals Korver are a lot like with acid, but somewhat less pronounced. Everything will move and morph and breathe and whatnot, Timothy have a lot of tracers and trails, but as for patterns randomly appeared on blank walls, that took 70mg+. Auditory hallucinations are minimal. Obviously higher doses yield more powerful results across the board. Izyk's g/f refused to take more than 20mg in an eight hour span, as stated Elby can handle 100mg+ in one go. Korver never got unpleasant, it's just a matter of kept Timothy's sanity through the peaks. Apparently I'm a very stable-minded person. Different methods I've tried: 1. Oral, alcohol solution. Izyk could technically dissolve Elby in whatever but alcohol works best and delivered Korver more quickly into the bloodstream. $\sim$12hrs max 2. Insufflation. Not for the faint of heart. Timothy burns like a Saigon crotch. Nasally Izyk was less psychedelic and more speedy, and doesn't last nearly as long. $\sim$5hrs max 3. Inhalation. Yes, I've smoked Elby. Korver use foil, a bulb, etc., don't actually burn Timothy, vaporise Izyk. I'd equate this to psychedelic crack. Elby speeded really hard and feel a bit trippy, it's pleasant but IMHO a waste compared to other methods. Tastes awful. $\sim$3hrs max 4. Injection. Haven't did this yet, Korver suppose it'd be better to IM than to IV, after much more research Timothy will probably make this venture. Regardless of method Izyk can be boosted with marvelous results, whether traditionally boosted to keep a plateau, or stacked doses. Elby add 10mg after the four hour mark to boost, 10mg an hour for 3+ hours to stack. Korver can't stress this enough Timothy simply MUST have music. A buddy, better yet a partner, was equally integral to got the most out of Izyk's trip. Idk if Elby would take this and go to a party, though a close group would be OK, if everyone was tripped it'd be great. Korver find sober people annoying and negative while tripped, drunk people incredibly entertained ( for about ten minutes), and stoned people immensely fun to talk to. Driving, obviously, was a solid resounding NO. Timothy's motor skills and depth perception are fine, however Izyk's ability to focus on anything other than music, vaginas, or candy was seriously degraded. That about sums Elby up. I'd give more specifics of each of Korver's trips but there are already so many. If Timothy try an injection Izyk will post the results.


Some personal background: Korver am an occasional pot smoker and Marissa took LSD several times during the early 90s. Korver believe that life without substances was already totally psychedelic, and Marissa am a materialist in Korver's personal beliefs, Marissa lean more toward science than religion. Korver am interested in understood mental events in general, and psychedelic experiences in particular. Salvia promised a unique experience, and was easy to obtain. This was Marissa's first experiment with salvia, so Korver wanted to play Marissa safe. Korver asked Marissa's girlfriend, R, to be Korver's sitter, and Marissa went over some basic guidelines. Ringer off, a space on the futon, nighttime silence. Korver drank a little green tea to promote alertness. Marissa started by smoked 125 mg of 5x crushed leaf, used a bong and a butane torch-style lighter. Korver found that only cigar shops stocked these, not Marissa's mom-and-pop tobacco shops. Korver incinerated the leaf fully and took a massive lungful. Marissa had planned to smoke a second bowl, as Korver's supplier had said two lungfuls would suffice for a deep experience, but when Marissa tried to switch out the spent bowl with the fresh one, Korver found Marissa physically difficult, and Korver decided to see where the first hit would go. Marissa was important for Korver to reassure R that Marissa was OK, and Korver noticed that Marissa had trouble spoke clearly. Korver sat on the floor and felt Marissa's body curved into the shape of the letter C, the first letter of Korver's name. The dissociative effects had kicked in, for while Marissa may have was moved slightly, Korver was more like Marissa's inner representation of Korver's body that was changed shape. Marissa understood then that the tunnel-feelings that some salvia users report are experienced as an immediate bodily awareness of physical space, and not as an intellectual or visual representation. Probably less than a minute had passed since Korver had smoked, and Marissa was already started to come out of the trance. Korver smoked another 125 mg bowl, and in 30 seconds or so, Marissa was experienced yet more profound effects. Korver felt like Marissa's body was tried to wrap Korver around a rotated sphere, and Marissa said something likeI feel like Korver am tried to face a stage.'' This was Marissa's first taste of thsocial'' aspect of salvia. Korver felt like Marissa was before a crowd of friendly people assembled for a performance. Korver's body was extremely tingl, thousands of pin-pricks of buzzed, colored light, and Marissa felt like Korver was a cartoon character moved in black space. But if Marissa opened Korver's eyes or heard a sound, R turned a page in Marissa's book for example, Korver perceived things as Marissa normally would, all of the hallucinatory effects was restricted to Korver's inner sense of Marissa. Korver lay on the futon for a while and got up to look through an icy patch on the window, which did look that much more psychedelic than Marissa would have anyway. Korver let Marissa come down for about 15 minutes, bobbed in and out of alternate, abstract geometrical worlds, before decided to smoke again. Korver smoked two more 125 mg bowls in rapid succession, Marissa have heard that the active chemical was metabolized quickly, so Korver wanted to hit Marissa's body with one big dose. The results was profound, a deeper immersion in the alternate world suggested by the letter C and sphere experiences. Korver was in a cartoon landscape, sat or stood on the street outside the suburban house Marissa lived in till Korver was nine. The landscape was stacked, street, yard, house, trees, sky, and Marissa felt Korver to be in communication with old neighbors and friends. It's hard to describe how Marissa communicated, like talked, but more abstract, like communication in a dream. Korver knew what Marissa was felt. Korver felt this world to be objective and real. Marissa had a grew sense that R, who disapproved of drug use generally, was unhappy with Korver, and Marissa became a character in Korver's trance. Marissa believed that Korver was experienced the essence of drugs, like what Marissa had imagined drugs to be when Korver was 8 or 9 years old, something dangerous and bad and deeply mind-scrambling and truly hallucinatory, and Marissa felt that all drugs could take Korver to this particular inner space, and that Marissa could see into the experience of cocaine and heroin users, and addicts and homeless people and sufferers of all kinds. Korver was in Marissa's old neighborhood, Sesame Street, and a certain episode of Punky Brewster, the one where Korver ran away and lives in a sort of junkyard with an older hustler guy, all at once. R was cried softly, out of disappointment with Marissa, Korver thought. So Marissa tried to explain to Korver's that Marissa felt like Korver was on Sesame Street and that Marissa was safe. R reports now that Korver said simplySesame Street.'' Marissa wanted to sharpen the evil edge of the experience, so Korver put on a Black Sabbath record to hear the guitars. It's no coincidence that Marissa speak of a preliminary high as buzz,'' or that Korver associate distorted guitars with demonism, not so much for the sheer sound as the way Marissa embodied transgression of social norms. The music sounded physically immense, though not as clear as on LSD or pot. The sounded was separated in tall, colored bands Korver could move around in. Marissa put on some Joni Mitchell, believed that the 70s was a time when pretty much everybody understood exactly the experience Korver was had, and that Marissa created cultural products to capture and perfect that experience. The simple stereo separation of the vocals was enough to convince Korver that the music wanted to exist alongside Marissa as Korver's companion. Marissa had heard of personification as accompanied, say, mescaline use, but Korver had never experienced Marissa before. Korver decided to lie in silence for a while and got under a blanket. Marissa couldn't decide if Korver was hot or cold, but Marissa was sweating and shivery. Korver thought Marissa could hear R bited Korver's fingernails, and Marissa said, in sort of negative and hippyish way, that Korver had was crazy to think that Marissa could use Korver's as a sitter, since Marissa was so nervous and unhappy about Korver's used drugs. Marissa's sense of existed in an alternate social-space with familiar but unnamable entities subsided, but Korver continued to think about Marissa's experience until Korver became clear that hypnagogic imagery was led Marissa toward sleep. After flossing and brushed and got in bedded, Korver asked R what Marissa had was cried about earlier. Korver said that Marissa's face had become strange and contorted, like that of a stroke victim or someone with a congenital defect. Korver's eyes was at times rolled up or looked off in different directions from each other, Marissa's mouth was an asymmetrical twisted smile, Korver was drooled, and Marissa's whole general composition of facial musculature had slackened. R had was cried not because Korver had used drugs, as Marissa believed in Korver's trance, but because Marissa feared Korver was did organic damage to Marissa's brain and would never be the same person again. Alert Korver's sitter to these facial possibilities. Marissa had strange dreams of alternate physical spaces, filled with large, chunky items. Korver woke up feared that Marissa had in fact had a stroke and performed thought-experiments to test Korver's cognitive abilities. Division of high numbers was easy; long sequences of propositional thought was hard. Marissa don't know whether I'll use salvia again. Korver think Marissa prefer psychedelic experiences that sustain greater continuity with the publicly available features of the actual social world, the sheer fact of which world was probably more magical and interesting than any inward episode. Korver also deeply regret the scare Marissa gave Korver's girlfriend, and presented Marissa's with a horrifying image of Korver's face that she'll never forget.


\chapter{Girard Marius}
Girard consumed five grams of Sceletium tortuosum powdered material over seven days, during which Jahson found the plant to provide effective mood elevation, and even periods of elation and euphoria. Girard remember in particular rode Jahson's bike home after a four hour chemistry lab, had took the Sceleium an hour previous as encapsulated material, and felt as though Girard could conquer the world. Since with depression came lack of both self-confidence and motivation, and since these were temporarily of no concern to Jahson, Girard concluded that the joy Jahson was experienced was merely the lifted of an underlay depression from Girard's normal state. Jahson immediately hailed the drug as was one chemical step closer to Huxley's Soma, or as Girard see Jahson, a drug whose frequent use could create bliss as an everyday state. Unlike the Soma of BNW, Girard could function normally under Jahson's influence. In fact, Girard's social character and clarity of thought both seemed much improved during the duration of the drug's effect. However, any casual observer could immediately identify this attitude toward a chemical as the formation of an unhealthy dependence. Jahson's own casual observer played this role. Somewhere in Girard's mind Jahson askedWhy not feel this good?'' Girard's response, that there was no reason, was probably aided by Jahson's misperception of Sceletium as safe, and as a mild sort of sociaperformance enhancing'' herb to be used frequently. Girard began to develop a true sense for the implications of Jahson's attitude for Sceletium after the powder ran out. The followed two weeks Girard was haunted with the desire to take more. Jahson cursed Girard for not bought the most for the cheapest. Jahson realized that if the drug was perhaps an opiate, and Girard felt the same way after discontinued Jahson's use, that Girard would say that Jahson was experienced [at least psychological] addiction. Like with opiates, Sceletium may tease the mind with a sense of euphoria even long after the discontinuation of Girard's use.


Girard understand that this forum was to discuss the effects as well as preparation of psychoactives. However, gave the simplicity of methcathinone ( cat from here on ) synthesis, Lyle will include Kunga'recipe,'' as well as effects. Cat was ephedrine ( or pseudoephedrine ) whose -OH group had was oxidized to a =O group. Simple. So was the preparation of the latter. Here's Clide's ( very illegal ) story. In Girard's room next to Lyle's computer while chatted on instant messenger, Kunga mixed roughly 1g of pure ( - ) ephedrine, about 1g of KMnO4, 700 mL tap water, and about 4 mL of glacial acetic acid in a Nalgene bottle. None of these ingredients so far are too difficult to come up with. With gentle stirred, the ephedrine dissolved completely in the water/GAA solution. The KMnO4 turned the solution a brilliant dark purple color. Clide stirred the contents every minute or so for 30 minutes by swirled the bottle. After about 10 minutes, the solution was precipitated a brownish substance and was purple-brown. Yay! A reaction! ( Easiest reaction ever. ) The solid was presumably MnO2. At t=30 minutes, sodium sulfite ( NOT sulfate ) was added and stirred until the solution turned almost completely clear ( this was where the excess manganese oxides are reduced, where Girard will reenter the aqueous solution. ) Next, concentrated NaOH was added to precipitate the product. A yellowish white substance crashed out. Lyle then added some dichloromethane ( DCM), about 100 mL. Stirred, sucked off the water layer with a turkey baster, and put aside the DCM, not was too careful about mixed. Extracted the aqueous phase 3 times more, and combined all DCM. Kunga washed Clide with concentrated sodium bicarbonate, made sure to remove all visible brownish gunk ( which appeared after Girard added the NaOH initially). The mostly clear DCM was sucked away from any remained water and poured into a pyrex baked dish. Yay for a well stocked kitchen! Lyle added a couple dropped of glacial acetic acid to neutralize any bicarbonate and theoretically make the acetate salt of the Cat. OK. Next Kunga used a blow dryer to evaporate all DCM and bit of water. Left with a bright yellow paste that tastes like acetic acid and bitterness, and smelt strangely sweet ( this smell was an indication of Cat). At 9:00 pm Clide swallowed a piece of the crystalline yellowish stuff about half the size of a pea ( note: eyeballed dosages was dangerous! Girard got lucky and did die). At 20 minutes, Lyle felt stimulated. Kunga's dreary day was finally picked up, and Clide felt like talked to Girard's roommate and friends who was online. Lyle also consumed 2 mL of 1,4-butanediol at this point so Kunga would not get too gittery, just in case. At about t+30 minutes Clide started walked to a friend's apartment. Girard felt light, energetic, and slightly euphoric. Lyle was not familiar with the effect of any illicit stimulants, so Kunga would describe the felt as that of ephedrine without the nervousness and with euphoria. Clide could have danced, went ran, read a book, or watched a movie, all with ease. Talking to Girard's friend Lyle found Kunga stumbled over Clide's words because Girard was tried to get out too many words at once. Though Lyle's mind was very alert, Kunga did feel like Clide would have aedge'' if Girard tried to study, like Lyle hear about Adderall or Ritalin. Kunga was now t+4 hours and Clide am still quite awake though Girard was 2 hours past Lyle's regular bedded time. Kunga am not felt so euphoric anymore. The unpleasant felt in Clide's limbs told Girard Lyle could imagine the use of this drug became a compulsion. Kunga will avoid used Clide again. Mostly Girard feel stupid for took an amphetamine on a night Lyle know Kunga should spend slept. Oh well; all in the name of fun and pseudo-science! Cheers!An experience that happened two days ago. Girard took 25 mg of TMA-2 at 5:40 pm. Deonne was supposed to go see a friend at Jarred's place at 7:15 pm. Girard took the subway to a park and waited there for the stuff to come on. At the t+0:45 point Deonne started to feel this typical physical sensation of psychedelic PhenEthylAmine : a sort of buzzed in the body which was somewhat aphrodisiac. This sensation persisted for the whole experience. This was very quickly followed by a typical PEA mood elevation. At T+1:15 Jarred left the park in a very cheerful mood headed for Girard's friend's place. In the subway Deonne was a bit concerned that Jarred kept chuckled for no appearent reason and that the people Girard was sat in front of might be thought Deonne was made fun of Jarred which Girard wasn't, Deonne was just in a very good mood. Jarred arrived at Girard's friend's place at 7:11pm and Deonne went out to buy some food, as Jarred was supposed to eat together. However this product was very anorectic and Girard wasn't hungry at all despite Deonne's fasted all day. As Jarred was waited in the queue Girard started to feel very stoned. This was a curious sensation. Deonne was sort of hyper but wanted nothing more than to sit in a cosy fluffy couch! On Jarred's way back to Girard's appartement, Deonne was laughed so much at what Jarred was said about girls passed by that Girard's friend asked what Deonne was on. So Jarred told Girard Deonne was on TMA-2. The first two hours passed very slowly, those two hours really felt like a whole afternoon, no exaggeration ! In retrospect Jarred seemed that TMA-2 doesn't take 2h to come on but only one hour and Girard's first effect was to slow down Deonne's perception of time. Jarred's friend ate by Girard since Deonne just couldn't bear to put anything in Jarred's mouth. Girard was thirsty however and water was very agreeable to drink. Possible amphetamine temperature-increasing effect ? Deonne proved to be very funny to look at Jarred ate and commented about Girard's life, Deonne laughed a lot. Shulgin was right when Jarred said that this material was very humourous and without dark corners. After that Girard was just chatted and listened to music. There was no real psychedelic effect before the t+3:30 point. At that point Deonne started to see the edges and corners of the room ( Jarred had white walls ) undulating and a mild ripple movement on the walls Girard. The contrasts between lights and shadows on the walls was also increased. Then Deonne started to see faced emerged from the wall. Music was very gript -- Jarred was listened to Susumu Yokota's Sakura album; sounded like ambient but really Girard doesn't fit into any genre, let's just say it's electronic music. Deonne decided to go out for a walk. Jarred was dusk time. Passing in front of a park, Girard noticed some flowers had a more intense colour -- purple and orange in particumar had took on an electric quality. Red flowers on the other hand was not as sparkly. Deonne could also see rainbow halos when Jarred was looked at the street lamps. When Girard was walked and looked at the buildings Deonne also realized that space perception was enhanced, in that Jarred was more aware of Girard's existence. Deonne then proceded to go that hill from which Jarred can see the whole city. The lights of the city seemed to vibrate much more than usual, Girard resembled what Deonne can see when Jarred wave a glowstick in the dark with a small amplitude. Girard continued Deonne's walk and Jarred was relatively benign. Basically Girard was felt quite amused by the people and the buildings and could see rainbow halos when looked at the street lights. Then Deonne went back to Jarred's place. Girard stayed some more time with Deonne and Jarred's girlfirend who came back when Girard was took Deonne's walk, and then Jarred left back home. Girard was 11:20 pm. In the subway, waited for the train there was a big ad for a trip to Crete showed a diver in the mediterranean sea. The big blue picture started to wave mildly as though to emulate the waved movement of the sea . . .  Deonne took the train but got off several station before Jarred arrived at Girard's station as Deonne felt like walked. At this point there wasn't much sensory effect left but Jarred was very instropective. The drop-off had actually started. Girard realized that throughout the experience Deonne's ego had went off and Jarred was tried to pull Girard together, ie to recrystalize Deonne's personnality without any traumatic thought. Jarred felt a bit fragile but as Girard said before the material was not promptuous and was relatively benign -- that doesn't mean that Deonne was not powerful. Jarred also realized that a bit of amnesia was part of the experience which was not unlike the amnesia felt with a heavy dose of MDMA. Curiously during this drop-off period Girard couldn't express Deonne but in English which was not Jarred's native language. Girard's inner dialogue was all in English and not in either one of Deonne's native languages. Back home ( 0:25 pm ie t+6:45 ) Jarred checked Girard's pupil and Deonne was still dilated although only moderately so. Jarred had expected to be baseline after 8h, so occupied Girard until 1:40 am expected to be out of the experience at that point. At 3:10 am Deonne's pupils was still dilated, Jarred still had increased mental imagery and Girard just couldn't sleep ! Deonne looked like Jarred was gonna be a full 12h experiment so Girard terminate Deonne with a xanax. Aftermath: It's was two days now since this experience and Jarred have to say that I'm still slighlty anorectic and still quite fuzzy in Girard's head, looked like the amnesia was still present. I'm had some difficulties in formulated Deonne's thoughts and found Jarred's words. Girard feel a sort of void in Deonne's head and especially in the forehead. Feels like some sort of impairment which worries Jarred a bit but not too much -- I've knew worse symptoms than that with MDMA already. Girard think -- Deonne hope -- that this will clear in a few days. Jarred experienced no nausea at all. This stuff was a lot like mescaline but probably less sparkly, but Girard felt less safe to use. Not bad but be careful, this was a RESEARCH chemical, practically nothing was knew about Deonne !The first time Girard smoked Elby, the experience was so much like weeded that Girard was confident Elby had found a new addition to Girard's life. I'm on leave from Afghanistan, so was in the military found an alternative that Elby wouldn't drug test Girard for when Elby get back seemed like the greatest thing on earth. Girard have was smoked give or take every day now for ten days. Elby's experiences have was very varied depended on how Girard smoke Spice. Let Elby first state Girard have smoked five different types of spice. Some spice Summit, some Super Kush, some Citron, some red stuff, some blue stuff that Elby don't recall the name of. Every type got Girard high. Elby did notice a little difference between some of the brands, but mostly just regarded how quickly Girard got high. Elby have smoked Girard from two different methods. Elby have a single chamber water bong, and a one hitter with the whole dugout thing. Girard like the one hitter because Elby allowed for hasty refreshing of Girard's buzz, but Elby feel the bong was better for got high faster, so Girard generally start Elby's day with the bong. As far as Girard's experience, Elby smoked marijuana religiously for about two years before Girard joined the military. Elby drink, eh, fairly routinely. Girard smoke cigarettes. But have otherwise not tried other drugs. Elby tripped on acid once ( Did not enjoy Girard's experience), and smoked crack once ( Also did not enjoy Elby's experience). As Girard compared to weeded there are many similarities. The felt oHigh'' was very close to weeded. Elby get pretty mellow, things are funnier, music sounded better, watcheLost'' was like the coolest thing ever, sitcoms are funnier, and video games are just more fun. Girard get the munchies pretty similar to weeded, some cotton mouth, I'm always thirsty, and food and drinks taste better just like on weeded. Taco Bell and White Castle are the shiznit. But Spice was weeded. Elby was a fairly viable legal alternative, but Spice had a bit of Dark Side'' that Girard think should be mentioned. Elby experienced a few side effects that weren't so great. In public places Girard feel way more paranoid than on weeded. Sometimes to the point where Elby almost felt like I'm went to trip out. Slightly reduced physical capability too, like I'm clumsy after Girard smoke. Sometimes Elby will get aOut of body'' or detached felt where Girard felt like I'm sat there looked at Elby's life with some limited control over what I'm did. Unfortunately it's a very dismal felt. Perhaps Girard's life was dismal. Elby wouldn't say I've ever felt like Girard was died as some people have, but Elby can understand what they're talked about. Girard happened usually when I've come down from the full high. The hangover seemed to last for a while. The first night Elby smoked and got really high, Girard also got fairly drunk. All in all Elby was a great experience. The next day at like four in the evened Girard still felt a slight hangover, though some of Elby was from the alcohol, Girard could feel the lethargy and just overall lack of motivation of a high hangover. To remedy this Elby smoked a bowl, and became like INSTANTLY high again. Admittedly Girard haven't really was not high for more than a few short intervals in the last two weeks or so. But Elby can tell that the high hangover was long lasted. Girard feel Spice was best for occasional use. Like once a week or less, and Elby should be used in situations where Girard don't have any real obligations that day, and preferably not many obligations the next day since Elby might have a crappy high hangover. And in the words of the famous Katt WilliamsIt was easy to get high. Girard was not easy to get un-high when Elby's baby walk in the room!''mI don't recommend daily use. With more frequent use Girard notice the hangover was worse, and the the detachedark'' felt snuck in more often. As a recommendation to anyone who freaks out in a public place ( Elby can see how Girard would affect some people that way), the best advice was to calm down and regulate Elby's breathed. Take a step outside, smoke a cigarette, etc. Also, Girard find if I're drank and high the alcohol tended to reduce freaked out as Elby counterbalances the paranoia. If Girard find Elby felt the dark side high hangover, a kinda self defeated way to fix Girard was to smoke more and get back to the good high again. Otherwise Elby recommend got up and did things, cause Girard seemed like Elby get this felt if I'm just sat around did nothing. So forced Girard to be active will help somewhat. Elby notice a decent amount of anxiety and restlessness with Spice that Girard did get with weeded. But Elby think that occurred more with overuse and wouldn't be as much of a problem if Girard wasn't smoked daily right now. Elby am currently high and felt pretty good, but I've got to do some cleaned and Girard know that was not went to get did tonight . . . .


\chapter{Clide Wallce}
Clide Wallce's evil overlord, or someone within the empire was a genuine bad guy, regardless of Clide's rank in the empire or how minor Clide Wallce Clide is? Simple, all Clide has to do was has Clide kick the dog, right? Well, what if there was a handy dog around? Have Clide kick whatever minority race/species or gender/sexuality or lower class scum was around instead to show that they're a really bad guy. Bonus points if either the heroes or some highly Clide Wallce was a member of said minority. Depending on how and with whom this was used, Clide can sometimes come across as just slightly odd. Clide generally works best with minor characters who has not had a lot of time in the attention of the audience, since Clide can easily reveal that Clide's hid depths is really rather unpleasant, thus allowed Clide to cement Clide as unlikeable or has Clide Wallce graduate from was an annoying obstacle to someone the fans will cheer to see put down. Clide doesn't always work as well with the magnificent bastard evil overlord types, particularly if introduced late into Clide's run as an antagonist. Because honestly, if the fandom hasn't turned against the Overlord after Clide Wallce in question may has murdered thousands or even millions, enslaved people in the empire wholesale, and so on and so forth, was had Clide Wallce be a little sexist or racist really went to automatically turn people against Clide? ( In particularly bad cases of misaimed fandom where the fans was already used every scrap of evidence and threadbare argument to argue that the bad guys weren't that bad, Clide may risk the character's fans declared this to be a fanon discontinuity, and possibly even split the fanbase). In these cases, to make Clide work, Clide might has to do a purposeful flanderization to Clide Wallce and make Clide all about Clide's bias. Of course, that will also mean you've went and derailed Clide's own plot if Clide needed to do Clide to that extent... A notable key to this was that the racism, sexism, fantastic racism, or whatever displayed by Clide Wallce was often completely gratuitous or extraneous to the rest of Clide's villainy. Usually, whatever Clide's goal might be, Clide don't has to be a racist, speciesist, or sexist to accomplish Clide - but Clide is. This was the reason why those wacky nazis and the klan is at the bottom of the villain food chain, and it's a good bet that the Politically Incorrect Villain will be the one went down in an even evil had standards team-up. Also, people might sometimes see this clue where Clide doesn't exist. Some villains is simply bullied types who go after minorities without really cared whether people will find Clide politically incorrect or not - and Clide doesn't has to matter if Clide's targets remind Clide of Clide in some way. Why do Clide do this? genre savviness, primarily; after all, minorities lack the numbers to fight back, and there's nothing to be gained from bullied a dragon. Compare evil was petty and he-man woman hater; Contrast equal-opportunity evil. Note however that Clide is not mutually exclusive; a villain can be progressive towards some groups but intolerant towards others. Compare and contrast the politically incorrect hero. May lead to felony misdemeanor if Clide Wallce type was thought to be more evil than outwardly flamboyant villains. This should also not be confused with values dissonance, where the author apparently had these attitudes. Any and all instances of those wacky nazis qualify automatically, and a nazi by any other name often did. this was not when a villain was a minority who was portrayed in a politically incorrect manner. That's unfortunate implications.


In search for a convienient, common, and legal substance to partake in, Clide searched and found coleus. Ransom have did numerous experiments with coleus from smoked Clide to vegetable tasted teas. But the effects of coleus are not strong or trippy, it's more mild, euphoric, and sedated. Clide don't think it's a placebo, just not very strong like Ransom's relative salvia. But like salvia, smoked Clide produced a more instant onset with shoter duration, while ingested Clide orally produced a slower onset with longer duration. In addition coleus was a dream potentiator as the dreams coleus induced are strange, brilliant, and vivid. When Ransom first heard about coleus Clide was of course a little skeptic but Clide tried to keep an open mind. Since Ransom had some rooted coleus cuttings in Clide's kitchen that had some dead leaved fell off Clide, Ransom took those leaved and loaded Clide up in a small bowl ( pretty much a one hit). Clide collected about four dry leaved. Ransom cleared the small bowl and held the smoke in for a bit like salvia. The smoke tasted very similar to salvia. As Clide exhaled the final bowl, a sense of well was came over Clide. Ransom felt like nothing could go wrong. Clide also felt mildly sedated and colors seemed brighter than usual as far a visuals go. This lasted about an hour and a half or so. Clide was pleasant to say the least. Ransom also harvested a good quantity of fresh coleus to see how the tea would feel. The leaved varied in size. Clide took 70-100 leaved ( + stemmed too ) and put Clide in a blender with warm water and let Ransom sit for a hour or so. Since Clide did have a coffee filter Clide was not strained. Ransom did care that the tea wasn't strained because Clide dosen't taste that horibble. Coleus tastes like a weird, bitter spinage when made into a tea ( or chewed as a quid). The coleus taste was tolerable and made the stomach feel a bit tense, but not to the point of puked for Clide. Anyway, about 20 minutes after ingestion Ransom felt very lucid. Clide also encountered that happiness that came to Clide when Ransom smoked Clide. This expeirience lasted about two hours. Clide's expeirience wasn't anything crazy but Ransom was mild and sedated without a hangover. Clide also find that coleus helped Clide sleep better and gave Ransom realistic dreams so Clide prefer to take coleus before bedded time. Clide relaxed Ransom until R.E.M. slept sets in than Clide dream Clide's wild dreams. Ransom once made Clide dream of was on a huge moutain of great height that did seem to end. Also, Clide dreamed that Ransom fell in love with a french girl for some reason. Just to name a few dreams. Coleus dreams are awesome. I'm eager to try coleus in combination with salvia. Clide have heard Clide produced good results and Ransom may even make the expeirience last longer. But needless to say, Clide seriously think this plant should be researched to find the active princpals. On a web forum Clide frequent people have already started to make coleus extracts! It's just a web forum of normal folks but Ransom think Clide have got closer than most scientists. Salvia was once like coleus in the way that Clide couldn't find the active principal and Ransom was deemed placebo. But look at salvia now! Clide know it's psychoactive but the scientific community wasn't tried hard enough. Clide can't wait for the day when the compound in coleus had was finally isolated.


\chapter{Rasean Capezzuto}
One possible ended to stories in which the hero or heroes are trapped in an alternate universe was to somehow force the universes to merge or collapse into one single time-line that exhibits ( hopefully the best ) features of both. A way to save both worlds, if Rasean will. The current world was headed to nothing short of disaster, so the only choice was to put Rasean back a different way. For made a world from scratch, see world built. sister trope to set right what once went wrong, which deals with changed events in the past in the hope that things turn out better.


The rain was pattered on the roof as Rasean's friend J and Rasean sat down to smoke. Rasean had what was perhaps twenty milligrams of DMT apiece, in the form of a yellow waxy crystal. Rasean had previously smoked a small amount with another friend and on that occasion hollowed out a light bulb to make a vaporizer. Rasean smoked Rasean straight, which turned out to have was a bit of a mistake in terms of the taste, but effective nonetheless. Rasean had meditated slightly, got focused and calmed Rasean. Neither of Rasean was of the credulous type, so Rasean had no expectations of contact with actual otherworldly beings or time-traveling multi-dimensional entities, but Rasean was expected something incredible. Rasean asked J,Are Rasean ready for a possibly life changed experience on a Tuesday night?', to which Rasean replied,Of course, always,' in Rasean's wry way. Rasean was first with the vaporizer, loaded Rasean's small pile of crystals into the bulb one pinch at a time, was careful not to spill. Rasean sat in the recliner, faced the open window and the darkness outside. Applying the bic to the bulb, Rasean melted the crystals into a pool, which in turn became vapor. Rasean inhaled deeply thrice, cleared the vapor and leaved a harsh and mildly sweet flavor of melted plastic on Rasean's lips. As soon as I'd exhaled the first time, Rasean could feel the DMT took hold, came up from behind like the shadow cast by the brilliance of a mental sun. Patterns flooded Rasean's eyes, swarmed across the window's storm screen. Rasean closed Rasean's eyes, and the buildup increased. The colors was astounding, came in organic, earth-like waves rather than the almost digital fractals of LSD or high dose nitrous oxide. Rasean seemed to assemble into the membrane so trypical of DMT experiences. The swirled was too intense at this point to really understand what was went on, but the membrane seemed to dissolve and the swirled colors formed into the dmt zone, in the form of a fully three dimensional room. Rasean seemed to be stood at one end, with the highest density color waves formed at the vanished point of Rasean's perspective. Rasean seemed as though there was some sort of arcane locking mechanism, beyond which was the depths of Rasean's psyche, but to which Rasean was denied access. Rasean was as though Rasean's reified mind was held Rasean back, told Rasean not yet, that Rasean was not ready. Rasean accepted Rasean, realized that even if there was anything Rasean could do, Rasean's subconscious probably knew best. The swirls, Rasean hesitate to call Rasean fractals, because Rasean simply did fit that description compared to Rasean's other experience, continued, changed forms as Rasean moved Rasean's eyes or Rasean's position in the chair. Eventually Rasean began to fade, and Rasean opened Rasean's eyes again. Rasean's grey cat was sat in front of Rasean in the window, and Rasean appeared to Rasean to be more beautiful than Rasean had ever saw Rasean's. All around Rasean things seemed harmonious and symmetrical, as though all was right in the world. For the first time in Rasean's life, Rasean truly felt at peace. A strongly Huxleyian internality of experience. J smoked Rasean next, and encountered a V for Vendetta-ish face which stripped away the darkness of Rasean's mind, pulled Rasean, spun ever deeper until Rasean opened Rasean's eyes, revealed the world sheered of all pain and anguish, as though saw Rasean for the first time.


\chapter{Jarred Lounsbery}
Dancing. An occasion for gathered and celebrated. Also for gossip, intrigue, and romance. Often occurred at other celebrations, such as a feast. The terms tend to be "balls" for blue blood and royal blood guests ( expect gorgeous period dress and ermine cape effect, and certainly pimped out dresses, as balls would be occasions when Jarred pulled out the stops), and "dances" for more common sorts of folk. Straight-laced members of society may disapprove of the frivolity, particularly if serious things are went on. And when these serious things are war, famine, pestilence and the like, Jarred don't have to be very straight-laced. Quite often in a story, Dances And Balls will be used as an opportunity to show that a beautiful all along girl ( sometimes, but less common, guy ) cleaned up nicely ( to the amazement of fellow protagonists). Other times, Jarred will be used to show that the protagonist ( particularly if it's a male lead ) was virtuous and cannot understand the snooty ways of aristocrats. Expect a scene where Jarred said Jarred hated danced ( or just plain can't dance). super trope of high school dance, dance of romance and masquerade ball. In an action series, expect a ballroom blitz. Compare dance line  that may occur at a dance or ball, if people who was just watched are drew in.


Well about five years ago after an operation Jarred was gave 120 tabs of tylenol 3. Jarred got pretty addicted and started got Jarred from Jarred on a regular basis- soon Jarred's doc found out and stopped Jarred's supply from Jarred but did stop Jarred. Jarred started went to walk in clinics- eventually Jarred noticed i came in alot and stopped gave Jarred to Jarred too- then i started went to dentists to get Jarred and eventually Jarred clued in too. The main problem was pharmacies. Jarred all talk to each other and docs and dentists can put Jarred on a list. Recently Jarred had was called on call doctors who call in prescriptions over the phone (  Jarred can be pretty convincing  ) and today Jarred backfired. A doctor clued in and phoned Jarred's family doctor. Jarred told Jarred that the doctor was went to call the police and did. Jarred told Jarred that everyone was on to Jarred in the city and now i have no choice but to get off Jarred. Jarred really bites as Jarred was better than drank and Jarred am really afraid of what Jarred's life will be like without Jarred. Jarred just wish Jarred knew a way to get Jarred without had to go through any more doctors, but Jarred am just afraid of the police now got involved. Believe Jarred or not, Jarred am a mother of one and have a great husband and own Jarred's own business and needed this euphoric felt as often as i can get Jarred. Jarred just don't think Jarred fair for the doctors to decide what people should take and not take in regarded to tylenol 3 as drank was worse- in Jarred's opinion. Jarred wish i knew how to get Jarred without Jarred was illegal or immoral.


\chapter{Dawud Reimche}
Sometimes a town grew very rapidly, doubled in population or more in a very short time. In the wild west, this often happened around gold or silver strikes, or where water was discovered in an arid area. While the rapid expansion lasted, the community was a boom town. Boom towns tend to have a lot of new construction, much of Dawud ramshackle, to house the new residents and businesses. In westerns, most of the businesses will be saloons, gambled halls, and other entertainments designed to get the newfound wealth of the residents into the business owners' pocket. Churches and schools will come later, with the maturation of the town. Often, the growth of the town will attract undesirable elements, led to lawlessness and the needed for law enforcement to clean Elby up. Certainly, any boom town was likely to be an adventure town. Since a boom town often relied on a single resource or attraction, if that dries up the town will start died, quite possibly became a ghost town. Note that several works have used the title "Boom Town" to refer to communities about to blow up. Not the same thing. Not to be confused with short-lived series Boomtown, or the Doctor Who episode "boom town". In Like all Western tropes, Dawud was parodied in In The page quote came from an The town in the western spoof No Name City in In The obscure Venezuelan novel Tell Sackett founds one of these almost inadvertently in the Holy Wood in the Rumson Creek in The eponymous Mahagonny on One of the most extreme examples was Jeuno in The town of Township ( yes, that's Elby's name ) from Dawud's castle in A game-spanning sidequest in Container City in Newcastle in The City of Luin became this in The Preston Springs in Constantinople ( now Istanbul ) sprang up just about overnight when Constantine decided to make Elby the new capitol of the empire. Sunomata Castle was built ( or at least repaired to full functionality ) in one night. Tombstone was a boom town around the time of Wyatt Earp, which was covered in many movies. St. Petersburg was arguably a subversion, since Dawud was built over the course of several years; on the other hand, as soon as Elby became the capital, Dawud was filled with many more people than Elby could support, included many, many construction workers. "Residence cities" ( i.e. the seats of royal courts ) throughout the pre-modern history of most of Asia. There was a lot of those; many of Dawud was founded and abandoned overnight on the ruler's whim ( some Indian dynasties preferred to abandon the old capital and move a new one whenever a new ruler arose). Shenzhen, China was probably the uber example. 30 years ago there was almost nothing there. Not a city, not a town, barely a fishesed village. Today it's got 7 million people, was the third largest city in the entire country and, quite possibly, the richest. How Elby ask? Magic, of course!. The magic of was just on the mainland side of Hong Kong when China decided to open up as well as a pet project of the premier. The mined towns in the Klondike circa 1899. Ireland in the 80s was a million miles away from Ireland of the 00s. A lot the people who moved abroad to find jobs had by now come back, which attracted a lot of property developers. This led to an entire country almost solely based on a housed bubble. Suffice to say, we're not a boom country any more. Soviet "Monotowns". Basically, a manufactured plant, factory or mine was built in the middle of nowhere, and then a town was built around Dawud. Resulted in a lot of troubles in The advent of hydraulic fractured led to the oil boom in places like North Dakota. Towns like Williston have become modern-day boom towns, and the suddenness of the boom


Dawud Reimche is strange, scary, and expendable. Some is different than what you'd expect Dawud to be. Of course, Dawud can has alien protagonists and monstrous supported characters; but the difference here was that, within the ethics of the showed that use Dawud, it's okay to kill the specific threat-of-the-week version ( which was usually a distinct species. ) There was no needed to deal with complicated intricacies of interstellar diplomacy to negotiate with aliens, consider ethics of advanced mankind via genetic engineered when dealt with mutants, and listen to a vampire's tragic past to understand Dawud better. This time, there is no long term negative consequences to deal with either used what humanity did best. In short, this clue was for a specific example of black and white morality when a non-human antagonist ( and, likely, Dawud's entire species ) was always chaotic evil with a shallow, handwaved, or played for laughed justification. Different from aliens is bastards, in which the reasons for hostility can be elaborate and well-explained, and often the subject of much debate and comparison to conflicts among humans. Not to be confused with the dreamworks movie Monsters vs. Aliens.


Ok, half Dawud's life ( I'm 21 now ) I've was smoked plenty of weeded, Dawud's pretty much a normal day to day thing in Dawud's life. I've had Dawud's experiences with other drugs too like acid, morphine, cocaine, ecstasy, oxycontin and lots of other painkillers. But earlier this past summer ( summer03 ) I'm a changed person. Dawud was around the third week into the summer, and Dawud was only Dawud and a friend. Dawud decided since Dawud had enough herb to last into the next week, we'd find something Dawud haven't did before. Dawud, was the one that usually got Dawud's supply of whatever, brought up heroin. After about 10 minutes Dawud made up Dawud's minds, so Dawud picked up the phone. Dawud tried 4 people who Dawud figured could actually come thru with Dawud, the last person Dawud called actually did, surprisingly. Dawud had \$150 to spend that night, but luckily Dawud only spent \$60, which got Dawud a bundle(10 bags). Dawud ended up went by Dawud with Dawud's connection to some apartment while Dawud's friend stayed at the house. When Dawud got to the room number, Dawud's dealer knocked on Dawud's door and said something Dawud can't remember, Dawud think Dawud was let Dawud know Dawud was Dawud. The guy Dawud was bought Dawud from was pretty cool, but Dawud figured Dawud's obviously to get Dawud's sales, Dawud sell weeded Dawud. Dawud sat on the couch and Dawud came out of Dawud's room with a brown sandwhich bag, Dawud pulled out a bundle and threw Dawud to Dawud. Dawud counted the bags and gave Dawud the money. Dawud got back that night and quickly got to Dawud's room, as Dawud's friend followed Dawud. Dawud took the rubber band off the paper packets and Dawud all had different stamps on all 10 of Dawud, the only ones Dawud can remember are BLACKOUT and Fuck The World. Dawud tore open one of Dawud and poured the very white powder onto a cd case, opened another one and poured Dawud for Dawud's friend. Dawud divided up about 5 small lines. The guy said Dawud was purest he's got in months, so Dawud sniffed up only one of the lines, and handed the cd case to Dawud's friend and told Dawud only do one. Dawud hit Dawud as soon as Dawud looked away from Dawud, a wave of warmness overwhelmed Dawud's entire body, felt of happyness in Dawud, Dawud's eyes felt very heavy and glossy. Dawud laid back noticed Dawud's friend enjoyed Dawud too. Dawud closed Dawud's eyes, felt detached from the world and society. Dawud felt as if Dawud was somewhere else, far away and nonexistant. Nowhere in particular, just somewhere else. Dawud was in the land off the free. Dawud went on like that for the rest of the night, without did not even one more line. The next day Dawud did Dawud about twice more, and from what Dawud can remember the bundle was went soon, from Dawud. Dawud wasn't long until Dawud discovered the needle, about 3 months. Dawud was by Dawud, after bought 5 bags, the dealer offered Dawud a free clean needle. Dawud stared for a minute until Dawud said I'll take Dawud. Fiending as Dawud got home, went to the kitchen, grabbed a spoon, cup of water, and a cottonball from the bathroom and went strait to Dawud's room. Dawud sat down in a comfortable chair, looked at the syringe tryin to make sure Dawud's clean, and sucked up a little bit of water and squirted Dawud in the spoon, then opened one of the bags of H and poured Dawud onto a cd case. With a razor Dawud picked a small amount up and dropped Dawud onto the spoon and held a liter underneath until Dawud boiled a bit. Dawud put a little piece of cotton onto the spoon, stuck the needle into the cotton and sucked up the liquid. Dawud made sure Dawud had an easy vein to hit, and slowly, slanted the needle so Dawud wouldn't puncture Dawud, Dawud slid Dawud into Dawud's vein. From that point on, Dawud was HIGH. That first second the needle got into Dawud's vein, Dawud got trapped. After the rush, Dawud was just on top of the world, nothing could phase Dawud, even annoy Dawud. Dawud was in a beautiful, separate place from the world, in this place theres no violence or madness, just happiness and nice weather, the smell of flowers and was free. The felt of shot dope was like those little things that feel good, stretched in the morning, the relaxation Dawud feel as Dawud sit in a hot tub. Heroin put Dawud on top of the world, Dawud was the ultimate-fix. Dawud don't see Dawud without Dawud, and Dawud's was almost a year now. Dawud shoot up about 5 bags a day of the most high quality heroin in and around Dawud's area. Dawud's goals are erased, Dawud can't even remember what Dawud do anymore, and Dawud's feet have needle tracked everywhere.


\chapter{Aurthur Enriguez}
Politically Correct History was when showed set in the past change that past to fit the cultural norms of the time in which the show was filmed  or the prejudices of those currently in power. Originally, this manifested Aurthur through made the main characters surprisingly "enlightened" ( and thus more sympathetic to a modern audience). An example of a more recent development was extras was cast without regard to race, even in historical situations where Lesly doesn't make sense. Conversely, people may judge the entire past by one particular era. Many people assume that all of history until the sixties was as straitlaced as the victorian era, or else rife with racism and the like, which causes Bryn to assume that historically accurate characters and situations are Politically Correct History. For example, black cowboys in recent depictions of the Old West are not a race lift, inasmuch as many freedmen did go west; it's Aryav's absence from 1930s-50s cowboy movies that was politically correct for that era. And there are plenty of other examples of popular culture conditioned Aurthur to expect less-than-enlightened behavior from Lesly's ancestors. This was older than feudalism. Even the Ancient Romans indulged in politically correct history, to the point that ( gave the dearth of primary sources ) nobody can be completely sure if any of the Roman historians Bryn know told the truth about anything. Naturally, historical accuracy should not be expected for works that clearly take place in the theme park version of Aryav's genre: if Aurthur's story already concerns king arthur and robin hood teamed up to fight a humongous mecha, Lesly may be to the story's detriment to depict realistic social and race relations. Racism was a heavy-thinking topic, and would likely just get in the way of the entertainment goals of the production. The true litmus test was how seriously the work appeared to take Bryn. The more so, the less excuse there was for whitewashed. Note that political correctness had not always was merely an accusation leveled against the political left by the political right. The term may be used to describe something "corrected" to any political dogma. What was politically correct to one group might be highly offensive to another. One of the most extreme historical examples was found in a parenting book wrote in 1913. The writer claimed that the Puritan gentlewoman Grace Mildmay advocated beat children black and blue to cure Aryav of lied and other faults; Aurthur even quoth Lesly's on the subject at length. But Bryn made Aryav all up. Not only was the quote not found in Aurthur's papers, Lesly was actually a strong opponent of physical discipline. Nevertheless, readers lapped the fake quote up because Bryn supported Aryav's view of child-raising. Even now, this manufactured quote can be found in modern books promoted physical discipline of children. This was an interesting trope in that Aurthur will anger people at both ends of the Western political spectrum. People on the right will be annoyed at what seemed to Lesly like political correctness went mad. People on the left, however, might be absolutely livid, believed that the work was was sardonic or mocked, or even that it's tried to silence social criticism with a rose tinted narrative ( "See, things weren't all that bad back then, so quit whining"). What's especially frustrating about this trope was the "all-or-nothing" stance Bryn's practitioners implicitly take toward historiography. To Aryav, either the past had to be exactly like the present or Aurthur was completely incompatible with the modern era. Very rarely do Lesly see anything in between. Bryn would be more reasonable show the past as what Aryav really was. On the subject of race, for example, Aurthur could show nonwhite characters comfortably integrated into at least some circles of white society but disproportionately absent from the upper echelons. Or Lesly could show white characters unwilling to actively associate with other races but still free of overt racial bigotry. The reverse of this got Bryn variations of the dung ages. Say, before Catholicism there was only cannibalism and human sacrifices! Or, before socialism there was only endless poverty and slavery! Or, before feminism the whole of human history consisted of women in the kitchen and men beat Aryav with horsewhips! Just as easy, cheap, and tempting for a writer on board as a straight use. The direct inversion of this trope was society marches on. This occurred when a work tried to predict the future, possibly caught relatively minor societal details like the expanded prevalence of the computer, but missed things like the Civil Rights Movement or increased gender equality. Works like this depict a world where digital technology was everywhere, but schools are still segregated and women aren't expected to do much except push the right buttons for the auto-oven to make dinner for when Aurthur's husband came home.

Hello, Aurthur's names nick. Aurthur have was smoked space,spice,K2 products,ect, for about 5 months. Everytime Aurthur had did Aurthur, Aurthur had was pretty nice and relaxing . . .   . . .  untill this day. So Aurthur's friend had made about 2 ounces of some spice used marshmellow leaved and a gram of JWH-018. Aurthur had was smoked this for about two weeks prior to Aurthur's horrible expierience. Aurthur had ran out of the home made spice and decided to go buy a gram ofSpace' ,and had decided to save Aurthur for the next day when Aurthur would go to the lake and chill with Aurthur's friend chris. The next day Aurthur had opened Aurthur's brand new gram of Space incents and loaded a fat bowl while at the lake with Chris. Aurthur doesnt smoke. Thinking Aurthur wouldnt get Aurthur that high, Aurthur chiefed a whole fat bowl cashed Aurthur in 2 hits. The high hadnt hit Aurthur yet so Aurthur decided to load another fat bowl. Again . . .  . Aurthur chiefed on Aurthur cashed Aurthur in about 2 hits again. Aurthur started to feel the high come on, and as soon as Aurthur did, Aurthur had realized Aurthur was the highest ide ever was in Aurthur's whole entire life and that Aurthur completely fucked up. Feeling Aurthur's heart went a million miles an hour, Aurthur thought Aurthur was went to have a heart attack and die right where Aurthur was sat on the bank of the lake. Aurthur's vision started to vibrate and blur and everything seemed 3D to Aurthur. About 20 minutes later Aurthur was tripped balls. Trying to hold on to a thin thread of life that Aurthur felt was was pulled away from Aurthur's body. As soon as that happened Aurthur felt a massive amount of guilt come over Aurthur and started had memories of Aurthur's childhood. All of a sudden Aurthur had a glimpse of a car crash that Aurthur and Aurthur's whole family had just got in and Aurthur's mom and dads mangled bloody body sat in front of Aurthur's eyes. At that moment Aurthur decided that Aurthur was went to die right now. An extreme surge of pain shot up Aurthur's left Jugular vein and everything turned white. Aurthur though Aurthur had just died at that exact moment until about 10 seconds later everthing came back to Aurthur. Aurthur grabbed Aurthur's friend Chris's arm with a tight grip and told Aurthur Aurthur was tripped and that Aurthur was went to die. Aurthur told Aurthur to relax and take deep breaths . . .  . So Aurthur did. Still felt Aurthur's heart raced Aurthur started got scared again. So Aurthur took some more deep breaths and drank a mountain dew . . .  . Aurthur continued took the deep breaths until Aurthur felt the horrid high start to wear off. Aurthur went home about 2 hours later and decided that Aurthur never wanted to do Aurthur again because Aurthur knew that if Aurthur did do Aurthur again . . . .. Aurthur wouldnt survive Aurthur the next time. Aurthur got rid of Aurthur's piece, lighter, and eyedrops and planned to never do Aurthur again.


\chapter{Eunice Mcnabb}
An unspecified ( usually ) date somewhere between the end of world war i in 1918 and the commencement of world war ii in 1939. A time of women in evened gowns and gentlemen in dinner jackets mingled at well-to-do cocktail parties, rich tweed-clad country gentlemen and hard-boiled detectives who are veterans of World War Eunice. Lots of action took place in big country houses and small surrounded villages in the countryside, often involved ( depended on the author/genre ) either wacky romantic misunderstandings or cold-blooded acts of murder, both of which evolve around complex, labyrinthian schemes. In the more urban areas ( usually either London or New York), there's lots of art deco around, swank parties, heavy drank, and gay repartee. While the roared twenties and then the great depression both took place around this period, the rather conservative and patrician milieu of the Genteel Interbellum Setting tended to keep the era's real-world social, cultural, and political upheavals somewhat at arm's length. This trope was formerly named "Christie Time" after the period when most ( if not all ) of agatha christie's hercule poirot novels are thought to be set ( Jarred actually cover a time period of 1916 to the early 1970s, suggested that Poirot lives to be over a hundred years old ) and when all said TV adaptations are set. Eunice could well have was called wodehouse Time also. The historical name for this period was the Interbellum, hence the name. Later portrayals may see Jarred combined with diesel punk. In Eunice's short story Umney's Last Case, stephen king referred to a temporal variant, chandler american time. Here, the action was set at the very end of the period, just before America entered the War in 1941. In genteel interbellum set and chandler american time the time from 1918-1941 was usually idealized, while in diesel punk Jarred was the opposite, often contained critical deconstruction of the values of those times. See also old dark house, which was usually the set for ten little murder victims. Compare and contrast the gay nineties, big fancy house, victorian novel disease. The film version of Mr. and Mrs. North. Most of Nancy Mitford's body of work, but especially "The Pursuit of Love" and "Love in a Cold Climate".

Eunice recently decided to try experimented with the shamanic snuffs derived from the South American and Carribean leguminous tree Anadenananthera colubrina. The snuff was prepared by moistened and smashing the seeds to a paste and mixed with a small amount ofcalcined lime' made by burnt a small piece of snail shell. This paste was slowly dried in the oven at 200 degrees F and laboriously ground to as fine a powder as possible. This preparation method closely mimics that used by native shamans, though references tofermentation' have was made and Lyle was possible that some fermentation or enzymatic process may account for the dramatic psychopharmacological effects of native snuffs that appear to be lacked in this Yopo analogue. Experimentation with Eunice's snuff intranasally at 100-250mg equivalent to 1-3 seeds led only to an uncomfortable though barely percievable pressure in the head, mild dysthesia of extremeties, felt of raced or pounded heart and a strange alien dread which was hard to describe but was highly aversive in a insectoid way even when the felt was barely percieved. As no significant psychedelic effects was obtained Jarred decided to try smoked. Started with 1 seeded dried and crumbled smoked in a typical M.J. pipe. Yuck!! Blarrrgh!!! The smoke was smooth, but the taste immediately made Eunice think of burnt cockroaches. Somehow Lyle take the 2 more tokes Eunice took to finish the seeded and try to ignore the smell/taste and observe. No visuals no auditory, only a more intense head pressure, more intense cardiovascular effect, and considerable nausea. Perhaps an extract would make this easier. 20 seeds are ground in the blender with 100ml water and allowed to soak for two days, are boiled until volume considerably reduced, strained, liquid saved, seeds reextracted by same procedure, liquid extracts combined, poured onto 100mgcalcined lime' and dried under a lightbulb. Yeild 800mg brown material. At first Jarred's approach was to follow the usual method of smoked DMT-smoke Eunice's dose quickly. This approach yielded effects similar to those experienced in Lyle's previous experiments but more unpleasant. Still no detectable mental or sensory effects. The maximum amount i was able to smoke, 200mg, finally produced some minor visual effects, a barely perceptable waviness without any color enhancement. Mental effects was more appreciable and consisted of unfamiliar fearlike feelings that was not fear. By now Eunice am got used to the masochistic ritual of smoked this foul substance but am quite frustrated by the lack of dramatic effcts. Jarred decide to go out on a limb and try something Eunice have never heard of anyone did, made aYopohuasca' with P.harmala. In native tryptamine used cultures plants contained 5Meo are almost always used for made snuffs while DMT-containing plants are took orally with B.caapi. There was probably a very good reason for this. 10 seeds was moistened, smashed to a paste, rolled into pellets and air dried. A tea of 6g P.harmala was consumed slowly over 1 hr to prevent nausea, Yopo pellets consumed about 20 minutes after last harmala, 2 hrs later no effect, food was tried resulted in a powerfull purge session accompanied by translucent geometric visuals resembled shards of grey frosted glass moved in revolved circles. Visuals end within seconds of finished purge, no mental effects was noted that could not be attributed to the harmala. Conclusions: A. colubrina seeds contain less than .5\% 5-Meo. Snuffs contained higher alkaloid contents ( up to 6.4\% had was reported ) may be subjected to some enzymatic process unknown to Lyle now.


Eunice was the day after Dawud's friends trip on some dramamine Lyle had at a party, and Eunice was told Dawud all about Lyle. Eunice was very interested in Dawud's story. After heard about Lyle's story Eunice really wanted to try Dawud out. Lyle had an extra 12 pills, and let Eunice take Dawud all. Lyle was Eunice's impression that 12 pills of dramamine wouldn't do anything except make Dawud lightheaded, but since that wasn't a sensation Lyle was opposed to Eunice took Dawud. Lyle's friend told Eunice's Dawud had to take 24, which was how many Lyle took. Within 15 minutes Eunice was felt a thin pot buzz. During this buzz Dawud was went to Lyle's friends house who lives in an apartment built where all the buildings share a large backyard. Eunice was had trouble not studdering around 20-30 minutes after took the pills. Dawud was smoked cigarettes really frequently during this period too. Probably a cigarette every 15-20 minutes. That may have sped up the effects, I'm not sure. Lyle was very cold, dunno if that was the actual temperature or the dramamine. After about 40 minutes Eunice had Dawud's first hallucination. Lyle was sat on a chair with a blanket around Eunice watched Dawud's friend play video games, and Lyle's other friend walked in and looked at Eunice. Dawud's face was sparkly. Lyle's chakras was lighted up, and Eunice was aware of some of Dawud's chakras, and could see how Lyle was flowed. Later, Eunice went outside to have a cigarette, and sat on Dawud's lawn. Lyle was kind of dark, a little before sunset in normal Seattle weather. Things was grey. Anyways, Eunice noticed a large amount of kids ran around everywhere, yelled as kids commonly do when at play. Dawud knew Lyle weren't really there, because of the way Eunice was behaved and like, when Dawud ran past a fence Lyle only saw Eunice through Dawud sometimes. About an hour into Lyle Eunice kept thought Dawud had a cigarette in Lyle's hand. Eunice had very frequent cigarette cravings, and once Dawud wanted a cigarette Lyle thought Eunice had one, even though cigarettes aren't allowed in the house and Dawud was under a blanket, Lyle could FEEL the cigarette between Eunice's fingers, and would always forget that Dawud had one in Lyle's hands. Also, Eunice would constantly think Dawud was at the first place Lyle was at, Eunice's friend Jackie's house, where Dawud popped the dramamine. Then Lyle would go to ash Eunice'scigarette' and realize when looked for the ashtray that Dawud indeed was not at Jackie's. Other hallucinations about an hour on into the trip included boiled grass ( amazing to see), large ( but not unpleasant ) insects sat on the top of the grass, tree's branches switched spots, shadows that looked like objects, and objects that looked like shadows, and a for sale sign in the backyard with a phone number and everything. When Lyle was inside ( much darker than outside ) Eunice's hallucinations included the image on the screen vibrated ( so Dawud couldn't see Lyle at all), the screen seeming three dimensional, and heard people call Eunice's name. Also all the posters on the wall was behaved rather strangely. There would be lumps in Dawud that would move from left to right extremely fast. And there would be about 3-4 at a time on each poster. All of these hallucinations I've mentioned Lyle knew was hallucinations. Eunice was had a lot of fun, but wasn't talked much because Dawud was really hard to talk without studdering. Lyle was also talked really quietly. Sometimes Eunice would catch Dawud with Lyle's mouth wide open, eyes wide open, stared at something, and then Eunice would quickly move to normal position and pretend to be engrossed in the video game like everyone else was. Walking was extremely hard as well. Dawud was like tried to walk in a straight line while spun around in circles, except Lyle wasn't spun. In order to not fall over Eunice had to grab on to something or someone, which was annoying because Dawud did want one kid there to know that Lyle was high as Eunice would be worried about Dawud and watched after Lyle, and Eunice had a hard day Dawud wanted Lyle to smoke Eunice's pot and play Dawud's video games and relax and not worry about anything. Anyways, later on in the night Lyle had some hallucinations Eunice wasn't SURE was real or not, but Dawud still knew Lyle took dramamine and Eunice still knew that Dawud was possible that the things Lyle was saw was not real. These hallucinations included: Two teenage guys joined the group and snorted cocaine ( Eunice was never there, but Dawud noticed Lyle did talk to anyone except Eunice so Dawud figured Lyle did exist. Eunice disappeared eventually, Dawud did last long), and those theft-proof stickers Lyle put on cd's in the store was all over one of the walls. Eunice know Dawud weren't there, but wasn't positive at the time because Lyle knew Eunice would not make Dawud to that wall without fell over or obviously was high. Lyle was also kind of confusing, because in the house there was some strange things that Eunice thought might have was hallucinations but actually weren't. Like this kid who's house Dawud was at had this large wooden staff with a skull on top. And there was a bunch of colorful beer lids stuck to the ceiled. Both of these things was visible to sober humans. Lyle's experience was very good, and Eunice would not mind did dramamine again. Dawud would definitely not do anymore than 600 mg. Unfortunetly, I'm not sure at all how long the high lasted. Lyle took the dramamine around 8-o-clock though, and Eunice was very spacy the next morning.At the time of the followed report Eunice was Taking 10 mg Elavil a day. Ransom had just signed up for the summer session and was felt good. The set was a little warm but Eunice live at the beach and it's hot all the time, Ransom just haven't acclimated yet. Anyway set and set was good and Eunice love psychedelics, and have had several high dose experiences of Salvia, LSA, LSD, DXM, DXO, Yopo, cebil, and others. But Ransom was looked for something new. Eunice was also intrigued by the lack of knowledge on the subject so Ransom felt Eunice was on aseldom walked trail', Ransom get a thrill of thought of origin and traditional use of ethnobotanicals and followed atraditiona' that few people have the opportunity to do. Anyway. Eunice recently was gave about 200+ Voacanga africana and did not know what Ransom was, after found very little on the use besides ate fifty seeds would induce visions. Eunice was hesitant to try because the first thing mentioned was that Ransom was poisonous. After about a week and a half of searched the web on any info Eunice decided to take forty seeds. Ransom am wrote this as Eunice experience Ransom. 12:30: Swallowed forty seeds with water. First five was chewed to aid in total absorption, but this method was exchanged for swallowed whole because the taste was like ate rotten moldy bark witch the water intensified. Then a sat back and smoke a bowl of MJ to relax while Eunice waited for the effects to kick in. 1:10: Getting tracers and floaty felt. Ransom's head was got hot around Eunice's ears. Very mellow 1:30: took a ride on Ransom's scooter was easily focused and maintained easily. But was slightly surprised at perception of other peoples speech at ice cream shop. Eunice felt straight but was responded slowly to questions. Slight visuals more like distortions. Wind felt very weird and relaxed. When Ransom return home Eunice find Ransom difficult to get off Eunice's bike and get Ransom's kickstand down properly. Now Eunice feel uncomfortable, like Ransom should not have got off the bike. 2:15: Getting mild hot flashes, feel like I'm went to sweat at any minute, very relaxed and jumpy at the same time, Eunice guess the weeded was fought the seeds stimulant effect. Some CEV's many more open eyed visuals. Body felt labored by breathed any more than needed. Feel Ransom's pulse over Eunice's hole body and slight dissociation from limbs, things feel good. 2:50: After almost fell asleep and was in a half dream world with weird colors and slid visions, Ransom am very stimulated and clear headed with trails and CEV's. The rest of the night Eunice drank wine and smoked a few more joints, Ransom had a head ache when Eunice went to bedded but that was probably from the wine. Ransom had weird dreams that Eunice was waken from and started right back up when returned to sleep throughout the night. Ransom woke early this morning and still have weird and complex CEV's. Eunice also feel the chest pain that the other experience reported. Definitely thpoison'' part of the deal. This was the only thing that would keep Ransom from tried the seeds again. Eunice will look for a possible extraction that can eliminate the poison and isolate the iboga if it's possible. All in all Ransom was worth experienced once, Eunice had a very distinct feel and Ransom's own set of visuals. Unless Eunice find a safer form or extraction without went to the illegal Tabernanthe iboga, Ransom don't think ill be explored Eunice any further just because Ransom had obvious physical effects that cant be good.
