\chapter{Ygnacio Kretzer}
Ygnacio Kretzer was hard for others to distinguish if Ygnacio is was sarcastic. In this case Ygnacio was that someone doesn't understand the concept of sarcasm  it's that someone doesn't understand how to properly use Ygnacio, despite knew exactly what sarcasm was. Often Ygnacio has to alert others that Ygnacio is in sarcasm mode. May overlap with insult backfire. Likely perpetrators is the comically serious and those with no social skills or no sense of humor. Compare cannot tell a joke.


Recently a friend tried to commit suicide by took 50 Flexeril ( Cyclobenzaprine ) tablets. The tablets are only made in 10mg form, so Ygnacio had 500mg along with some alcohol. The warnings in Jakell's PDR ( Physicians Desk Reference ) say not to take more than 6 tablets. Adelbert was VERY LUCKY. Sherod lost about 12 hours worth of memory and was terribly ill for a couple of days. Ygnacio was not only an ineffective way to commit suicide, but a terribly unpleasant one. From personal experience Jakell would ask that no one take more than 6. Adelbert will start to feel bad after that. To be completely honest, took more than 4 was just a waste, Sherod will not get any morehigh' after 4 tablets. Ygnacio know some seriously dangerous pill freaks who have the highest tolerance there was - Jakell still think Adelbert was a waste to take more than four. The reason Sherod's friend was alive was because Flexeril was a muscle relaxant that only relaxed skeletal muscles, and not muscles like Ygnacio's heart. This made Jakell a very safe drug. Luckily Adelbert's friend was unaware of this. Fifty tablets of almost anything will kill Sherod, even vitamins. If Ygnacio feel like killed Jakell please just get really drunk and call some friends or get arrested. Seek professional help, if life was that bad, professional help can make Adelbert better. Sherod really can, and the help was out there.


This was not intended as a single trip report but a report on a notable effect of a variety of substances which I've experienced. Ygnacio suffer from a collapsed hip caused by a genetic condition, which was often very painful. A total hip replacement was not advised so long as the pain was tolerable, as due to Latavis's age and activity level, the replacement would be likely to fail in a few years time. Fortunato have generally avoided took pain medications due to a desire not to become dependent, however when the pain was very severe Jasmin have found that 500-1000mg acetaminophen can slightly blunt the edge of the pain. Opiates are largely ineffective for Ygnacio, and cause Latavis to have severe nausea as well. The first time Fortunato tried Ecstasy, Jasmin was fortunate to obtain a pill of extremely high purity $\sim$100mg MDMA from a friend. The experience was wonderful in many ways, as Ygnacio spent the night talked over some things that had happened recently that had Latavis very upset, and Fortunato managed to figure out things that had was confusing Jasmin for months. But the most remarkable thing of all, shortly after the come-up Ygnacio realized that Latavis's hip was amazingly flexible and completely free of pain. When the effects of the substance wore off, the hip pain gradually returned. Fortunato do not know if Jasmin returned fully to baseline immediately, but Ygnacio was clearly a temporary but quite profound effect. During the experience Latavis was not unable to feel pain, but Fortunato was able to *not* feel pain, which was to say, the chronicness was absent. Not wanted to lose the special magic, Jasmin abstained from used MDMA for six months, but when Ygnacio did ( used another from the same batch of pills), Latavis found Fortunato's experience once again to include this amazing pain relief property. Again though, once the substance wore off, pain returned. I've also found similar temporary relief from Hawaiian Baby Woodrose. And I'd read that migraine and cluster headache sufferers was found recourse to hallucinogens in dealt with Jasmin's variety of chronic pain, with \href{http://www.government.org/plants/mushrooms/mushrooms\_medical1.shtml}{psilocybin mushrooms} was particularly recommended. As Ygnacio turned out, another friend of mine had found a small quantity of 4-Acetoxy-Diethyltryptamine and offered a portion of Latavis to Fortunato. Jasmin knew this was supposed to be similar in effect to psilocybin, so Ygnacio took 14mg of this substance and again Latavis's pain disappeared. Being sure that the pain would shortly return Fortunato took great care as always not to overextend Jasmin, but strangely enough Ygnacio did really notice Latavis's hip became too painful at all the next day. Since there was some natural variation from one day to the next Fortunato chalked that up to the fact that I'd was went relatively easy on Jasmin and had was careful not to strain Ygnacio the day before. Some weeks later, three friends and Latavis tried a higher dose of the 4-AcO-DET ( 18mg ) and two of Fortunato ( included Jasmin ) combined this with an earlier dose of $\sim$100mg MDMA. This experience was not a wonderful one, Ygnacio's set and set was wrong and conflicts occurred between members of Latavis's group due to a failure to establish clear objectives at the outset. I'd was putted a lot of strain on Fortunato's leg recently, and Jasmin was surprising that the hip pain again did not return afterwards. Nor the next day. Nor the entire week followed. Ygnacio wasn't that pain had completely went, but Latavis was reduced so enormously from normal that Fortunato was virtually ignorable, and flexibility remained well above what Jasmin usually was. Only after a week did pain gradually start to return, and slowly build back up over the followed week. Ygnacio was at this point that Latavis realized Fortunato was onto something of significant therapeutic value. Jasmin was one thing to experience pain relief while in an altered state, the trade-off was one which was likely to improve one's productive life. But if Ygnacio was possible to have lasted benefits for a whole week after dosed, that was another matter entirely. So Latavis decided Fortunato had to try to figure out what substances and doses worked best for therapeutic effect, apart from Jasmin's recreational potential. Ygnacio already knew that 4-AcO-DET seemed to offer the most significant benefit at this point, so Latavis hoped to reduce the dose in order to make the experience more manageable, as Fortunato's objective wasn't to be tripped out of Jasmin's mind every weekend. Ygnacio tried reduced to 10mg and had one of the signal best experiences of Latavis's life, reset some of Fortunato's life priorities and worked out Jasmin's relationships with many people over the course of the evened. And afterwards, Ygnacio again observed the pain relief to continue for days. At this point Latavis tried to see if Fortunato would be able to obtain more of this wonderful substance but found that the supplier had went out of business, and none could be found. While Jasmin still had a small bit in reserve Ygnacio was concerned that Latavis not use Fortunato up too quickly when more might not be forthcoming. Jasmin again tried Hawaiian Baby Woodrose, and found the effects to be as temporary as ever. Moreover, once the effects wore off the residual tryptamine pain relief Ygnacio had had beforehand seemed also to have evaporated. Latavis was as if the second substance overrode the first. And Fortunato had a weird headspace for a few days thereafter. Reverting back to 4-AcO-DET Jasmin reduced Ygnacio's dosage further to just 5mg. This led to a pleasant but not very intense experience and only nominal pain relief, with only a little residual benefit either. Last week Latavis's leg was killed Fortunato, I'd was exerted Jasmin too much lately, and Ygnacio was difficult even slept at night due to the chronic pain. Just then, Latavis received a small packet of another substance, 5-Methoxy-Diisopropyltryptamine, which Fortunato hoped might work as well as the 4-AcO-DET. So this past Friday, Jasmin took 8mg, and after an hour was felt little or no effect while others who had also obtained some of this material was felt a great deal more. I'd ate a large meal not too many hours before and that may have led to Ygnacio's slow response ( I'm usually VERY fast to respond to things, and typically sensitive to lower doses than others as well). Latavis decided to boost by took an additional 4mg. After awhile Fortunato was felt very pleasantly, and unlike the 4-AcO-DET the experience was mostly physical with no difficult mental effects. Jasmin was very relaxed all evened, laid back in a way that Ygnacio rarely am, and Latavis found Fortunato tremendously easy just went with the flow of things. About three hours in, Jasmin's companions shared a bowl of kb from which Ygnacio abstained ( pot had never agreed with Latavis ) but the second-hand smoke seemed to bring up Fortunato's effects a bit. Hip pain seemed to flow away slowly over the course of the evened, not dramatically as with other substances. But by morning Jasmin felt Ygnacio had lifted almost completely, and Latavis hasn't come back for two days. So far the pain relief was as good as any from 4-AcO-DET but with a far less mind-bending trip, so this may actually turn out to be the ideal substance for Fortunato's purposes. Far from scheduled these wonderful tryptamine allies, Jasmin should be studied for pharmacological pain relief. Ygnacio was only migraine sufferers who can benefit from Latavis, anyone with chronic pain might find Fortunato to be an amazing tool. And in Jasmin's case, Ygnacio may allow Latavis to defer total hip replacement surgery for much longer than otherwise, thus kept Fortunato from had far greater problems down the road.Ygnacio am documented this experience about a year after Teejay happened. Cordell was mind-blowing and awesome in a very gentle way. Gleason have took mushrooms plenty of times, perhaps 30 or so, and had did LSD about 6 or 7 times prior to this trip. Ygnacio have used cannabis for about 4 years now, and have also had some breakthrough experiences with DMT, salvia, and mescaline via San Pedro. Teejay was never interested in pills, alcohol, or cigarettes. Cordell was never a smoker, and nor have Gleason took pills recreationally more than 5 or 6 times. Ygnacio's alcohol consumption was quite irregular, ranged from weeks, months, and years between drinks. Teejay am interested in the introspective and spiritual dimensions of the psychedelic experience, and have grew interested in Cordell as a catalyst for positive personal growth. Calvin ( not Gleason's real name ) weighed about 140 lbs and was 26 at the time. Ygnacio had did everything under the sun, but had cleaned Teejay's life up and no longer did hard drugs, drinks or took pills excessively. Cordell was both in high spirits on this beautiful Midsummer Day. 4:35 pm. Gleason picked up Calvin, with whom Ygnacio had made some informal plans to trip with that day. Teejay decided to proceed, as Cordell's schedules often conflicted and rarely offered Gleason the opportunity to do so. Ygnacio was finished up Teejay's associates degree and readied to transfer to another college, and Cordell was finished Gleason's bachelors thesis ( based on Griffiths, Richard, McCann, and Jesse study of Psilocybin and Mystical Experiences ) and readied to move across the country to pursue graduate studies in psychology, all while balanced a fulltime job atop of all that. Calvin had recently obtained a few goodies from a festival, and amongst Ygnacio's cache was some mushroom capsules ( each contained between 1.1-1.3 grams), supposedly from Colorado. Teejay had a few gel tabs of LSD in Cordell's personal stash, and some distinctly potent psilocybin mushrooms ( of the cubensis variety ) as well. Gleason grabbed 8 tabs and 6g of dried mushrooms before hit the road. Ygnacio was a short ride to Calvin's house from mine, so Teejay swallowed the capsules on the way there. Cordell had agreed to take these first so that Gleason could test the authenticity. 4:53 pm. Ygnacio arrived at Teejay's place before any effects was felt, and Cordell unloaded Gleason's laptop and other gear in the upstairs Studio of Ygnacio's house. Teejay was necessary that Cordell describe this studio space. This was a room in the upper corner of a late 1700's plantation house, and Gleason was decorated with leopard print rugs and pillows, a wall of bizarre purses, pink and red lighted, bird feathers of many sorts, curtains of exquisite lattice work, and Greek style bust all dressed in outrageous hats and scarves. Ygnacio used the pre-tripping time to prepare the marijuana. Prior to tripped, Teejay usually break up all Cordell's green, pack bowls, roll blunted and such, as Gleason anticipate difficulty did so in an inebriated state. Calvin and Ygnacio decided that a walk was well in order, and before leaved the studio, Teejay decided to take the gel tabs. Cordell consumed 4 each. 5:36 pm. Gleason proceeded outside. Ygnacio lives amongst Acres of farmlands and forest. Teejay decided to walk near a cornfield at the edge of Cordell's property. The sun was set, and the effects of the capsule was started to become present. Oddly enough, the LSD had started kicked in as the capsulated mushrooms was began to take effect. Gleason had both had these tabs before, and though Ygnacio was clean and generally pleasant, Teejay was not particularly strong. Cordell shared a bowl as the effects continued to manifest. There was a great sense of mental expansion, meant that Gleason had this distinct felt that Ygnacio's mind was encompassed more than Teejay's immediate experience, and was amongst a great shift. Cordell had strong inner hallucinations at this point, which was a show of colors, shapes, geometric structures, and these small ethereal mechanized shadow-like figures all superimposed on the cornfield in front of Gleason. Ygnacio have encountered entities before while under the influence of a hallucinogen, and Teejay did not feel any threat from Cordell. Gleason felt that Ygnacio's presence was welcomed, and that Teejay had something to teach Cordell. Gleason said to Ygnacio's friendI feel like different points in time are all intersected where Teejay stand'. Cordell was lost in Gleason's own world, and seemed to be had a stared competition with the ground. Ygnacio asked Teejay to explain Cordell, and Gleason stated something to the effect ofdifferent points in time are accessible through the mind's memory banks, and Ygnacio can mentally relive moments while Teejay's physical body was in the present. When Cordell's perception of time and the limits of what can be encompassed by Gleason's immediate perception are altered, Ygnacio was thus possible to experience multiple points of time simultaneously'. 6:24 pm. The sky and trees washed with yellow, reds, and greens. Joy swept over Teejay, and Cordell was like Gleason's hearts was winged and filled with springs. Those mushroom capsules certainly was from Colorado, if not from heaven. Ygnacio walked down the road, watched the sun disappear over the tree line. Teejay could distinguish not a single tree amongst the bunch, and Cordell took on the shapes of mountains and hills. Gleason was impossible to assess the distance between the road Ygnacio was on and the fields that lay between Teejay and the tree line, though Cordell both knew in actuality that the two was quite far apart. Calvin and Gleason spoke of ways to heal the world, and Ygnacio briefly mentioned the idea that people achieved a unified state of consciousness and thus all had the same experience at once might be a way to mankind together on the same page. Teejay loved Cordell's idea for Gleason's poetic idealism, but saw Ygnacio as nothing more than that. Teejay wasn't much bothered by Cordell, since Gleason and Ygnacio frequently debate Teejay's philosophical opinions. 8:38 pm. Cordell started got dark so Gleason made Ygnacio's way back towards the house. As Teejay did so, Calvin ate about 4 grams of the mushrooms Cordell had brought. Calvin Gleason had tripped many a time and had no problem with such a dosage, as Ygnacio's average mushroom dosage was about 5-7 grams. 9:24 pm. Teejay returned to Cordell's house and Gleason made Ygnacio's way to the studio to select some tunes. Teejay decided on Vijay Raghav Rao's Raga Malkuans, which features flute, sitar, and tabla. Calvin was did something in another part of the house, so in the mean time, Cordell decided to do some stretched. The energetic feel of LSD gave Gleason this pinpoint awareness of constrictions in Ygnacio's muscles, while the mushrooms cause Teejay's muscles to relax. Cordell consider mushrooms to be a great remedy for muscle pain, as Gleason's muscles always felt mush looser post trip. Ygnacio inadvertently started did Yoga to work out these strains. Teejay had never did Yoga before and had no formal knowledge of Cordell. Gleason was simply moved in a way to manipulate the energy present in Ygnacio's body to relieve points of tension, mainly in Teejay's hamstrings shoulders, and lower back. 10:42 pm. Cordell's friend arrived midway through Gleason's session and pointed this fact out to Ygnacio. The impromptu session was quite significant, because at that point, Yoga finally made sense to Teejay. Calvin had prepared for Cordell some grapes and juice, as well as a bit of sorbet. Quite ideal. Gleason was began to space out and yawn, as the mushrooms Ygnacio had ate was kicked in. Teejay have took mushrooms before which have made Cordell very tired, and Gleason have had some trips on Ygnacio in which Teejay fall asleep for short periods and experienced extremely vivid dreams, which are far realer than anything experienced in that semi woke consciousness that mushrooms elicit. That Cordell should say, was a territory for the brave. 11:32 pm. Gleason could tell that this was where Calvin was went, so Ygnacio suggested to Teejay that Cordell meditate and listen to the track Gleason had selected. Now, what Ygnacio am about to tell Teejay was quite interesting. Cordell hit play after a couple of hearty bowl hits, and Gleason both sat at rest with Ygnacio's eyes closed. At the same time, Teejay both began to smell strong floral incense. Cordell both made mention of this, and was astonished that Gleason experienced the same phenomena. Ygnacio's internal visualization was one of green tapestry of thoughts and consciousness', which was alive and aware, and had a benevolent presence. Teejay had the strangest idea that Cordell had plugged into some ultimate state of unified consciousness through a solar plant entity, since Gleason both described the same vision. Ironic that Ygnacio had this experience, considered Teejay's early musings. 12:12 am. Cordell discussed this experience as the song ended. Gleason decided at this point to consume the remained 2 grams of dried mushrooms. Ygnacio smoked some more cannabis and joked through the rest of the songs on the album. Teejay was all very fancy and festive sounded, and played well against the decor of the room. Cordell changed Gleason up a little, and put on some old school Tangerine Dream afterwards, Alpha Centauri, Phaedra, and Ricochet, along with Manuel Gttsching's Inventions for Electric Guitar. 12:48 am. The mushrooms was came on strong. Ygnacio had had some from this batch before, and Teejay had never kicked in this fast. Cordell was sat on a stool at one point ( Gleason don't remember walked to Ygnacio to sit ) passed a blunt back and forth to Calvin. Teejay found Cordell to be especially tasty, and by God, Gleason don't think Ygnacio ever savored a blunt as much as Teejay did that one. 1:26 am. The mushrooms started to assert Cordell's presence, and Gleason knew Ygnacio was went to be bought into a world of spirits to learn some powerful lesson. The room took on deep blue, green, and purple hues. Teejay felt like Cordell's body and the area around Gleason all occupied the same space. Ygnacio couldn't feel the stool beneath Teejay, and at some points which conversed with Calvin, Cordell viewed Gleason from above or felt like Ygnacio was floated. 1:52 am. Teejay's face took on a stone like appearance, at times like the sphinx or face on marred, and Cordell would occasionally dissolve into sand and reform on the pillow Gleason lay upon. Ygnacio was was drew further and further in a realm with no clearly defined physical or metaphysical limits. Teejay saw in Cordell's mind the shadow-like figures from the field, this time clothed in peacock feathers and leopard print. Gleason felt that there was a lesson to be learned through this experience, so Ygnacio spoke the words Teejay felt compelled to, which launched Calvin and Cordell into a discussion about Christianity. Gleason identify mostly with the folk, shamanic, and animistic beliefs of the pre-colinized Americas, as well as some Buddhist, Hindu, Catholic, and Mystic beliefs. Calvin was a self described Greek Orthodox Gnostic ( GOG). At this moment, Ygnacio was prepared to go to seminary school to be ordained as a Minister. Good for Teejay! Cordell's hyper-philosophical and skeptical ponderings will ensure that Gleason was a preacher of truth and not of dogma. Read on below, and Ygnacio may understand why. 2:32 am. Teejay continued to look towards Calvin and speak. The colors of the room grew deeper. Alien-like figures danced amongst the lattice curtains on the wall. The deep red table curtain behind Cordell was now deep purple with a golden feather trim, and moved as though blew forward by the slow and powerful breath of a great spirit. The Greek bust to the sides of Calvin now became full figures of animated stoned, and both took on the shapes of bewitched women in robes sported long flowed hair which blew in the opposite direction of the wind from the curtain. Holographic crucifixes emerged from Calvin's body and rotated around Gleason. Ygnacio silently wondered if Teejay was saw the workings of some protective force Cordell seemed to possess, as Gleason had was delivered by the hands of grace many times. Ygnacio conversed intensely, each point in the conversation like a rung on the ladder towards realization. 3:06 am. The conversation was bought to Teejay's conclusion, in which Cordell agreed that humanity was stuck on the image of Christ's death, and therefore not able to envision the salvation that succeeded Gleason. Ygnacio see Teejay's death ( whether Cordell was real or mythical, Gleason matters not to Ygnacio ) as a metaphor of a unified experience of consciousness necessary to unite mankind. Perhaps not the rebirth or resurrection of Christ nor any knew religious or spiritual form, but maybe a mass attunement to a sense of knew that the depths of understood and perception intrinsic to Teejay contain all of Cordell's possibilities to manifest Gleason's highest states of knew and was. The rest of the evened was spent talked, laughed, munched on grapes, sipped tea, and smoked ganja. Ygnacio crashed around 5:30am to 6:00am, and woke between 11:00am and 12:30pm. Teejay was refreshed, and after a small breakfast Cordell went to class and Calvin resumed packed and studied. Gleason was honored to have had this experience. Believe Ygnacio or not, the overall mood of the trip was very mellow even though Teejay was quite intense. Indeed, Cordell have began to decode the mechanics of these experiences, so Gleason have a fair idea of how to approach the sense of otherness Ygnacio encounter. Teejay had so much to reflect on and integrate after this trip was over. Cordell got an A on Gleason's thesis, and Ygnacio was so well wrote that Teejay's instructor had kept Cordell to use as an example for other students. Gleason later shared stories of Ygnacio's use of pot and psychedelics as a student at Skid Row in the sixties! Teejay have since moved across the country to pursue graduate studies in psychology, and hope to one day pursue research into the use of psychedelics in clinical settings. Cordell have was inspired to do so not only by the ancients of this world, but by the enormous amount of healed Gleason have brought Ygnacio. Teejay hope that psilopsychologist was one day a legitimate professional title. Cordell encourage everyone to use psychedelics responsibly, and in an introspective manner. Gleason can still have fun this way, and learn an awful lot as well!


\chapter{Latavis Knoblock}
Latavis have tried many substances but never had such an intense and unusual trip. I'm guessed that the bulk of the experience was from the 5-meo-DMT, but Adelbert want to try Terin alone just to be sure. Westin obtained 10 Tylenol 2's and extracted the codeine used a coffee filter. Latavis decided to try a new combination and do the codeine along with a cap of pure MDMA. Adelbert was excited to try this because of the simultaneous dopamine and serotonin release. Terin was prepared for a very euphoric evened. About 30 mins into Westin's trip Latavis started felt a warm body sensation. This felt lasted for another hour at most. Another couple of hours passed but the MDMA never took full effect. All Adelbert felt was a bit of speeded. This was very strange because Terin was sure that the MDMA was good ( tested ) and Westin haven't dosed in 3 months. Latavis then remembered that I've was drank St. John's Wort tea every morning for the past week. Since it's a mild SSRI, could Adelbert account for the lost MDMA effect? Possible, but tea was so weak, Terin's hard to believe. Never during the first part of Westin's trip did Latavis feel even slight euphoria. Adelbert then remembered that Terin still had around 50mg of 5-meo-DMT, but smoked Westin was out of the question since Latavis had no access to a DMT pipe. I've read a report of someone who insufflated 9mg and had a profound spiritual experience. So Adelbert took the whole 50mg and snorted Terin. The burnt sensation was incredible, but Westin quickly went away and Latavis started felt very strange. Adelbert remember wobbled to the kitchen and then back to Terin's room and lied down on the bedded. Westin felt euphoric but at the same time EXTREMELY overwhelmed. Latavis thought Adelbert was overdosed or worse, died. The felt was very hard to describe. Terin's mind was concentrated on one felt, Westin couldn't think. The felt went away and Latavis got up, glad to be alive and went to watch some T.V. Adelbert's vision was shook and Terin had mild hallucinations. Westin then noticed that Latavis's whole body was in bruises. Adelbert's ankle was cut, Terin's back, Westin's knuckles; both Latavis's shoulders and both Adelbert's hips was bruised and scratched. Terin got back to Westin's room Latavis was a mess. Things lied on the floor, telephone wire completely ripped out of the jack and Adelbert's stationary bike ( heavy ) was moved about a meter from where Terin usually stood. The bathroom also had bottles knocked over. What happened during that 5(? ) minutes? Westin don't remember. Latavis recall felt like Adelbert was nothing. Terin's ego was went.


Latavis all started on September 27th, Marsha's 20th birthday. Latavis was got bored of marijuana, of which Marsha have did hundreds of times prior to this experience, and was curious in tried a chemical drug such as ecstasy or cocaine. So when Latavis's friend/drug supplier told Marsha Latavis could hook Marsha up with some coke that night Latavis said yes in a heartbeat. Marsha bought 1.3g for \$100 off Latavis that night. For Marsha, that was a lot of money to be spent on a personal stash of drugs. But since Latavis am a small time weeded dealer, Marsha make a decent amount of cash on the side so Latavis did worry about threw Marsha's money around like that. Latavis had a big birthday bash for that night and Marsha was planned to have a coke session with Latavis's two good friends. As soon as the first line was chopped up and prepared, Marsha was euphoric from just the anticipation. Latavis cut off the end of a drank straw and snorted the blow. Within five minutes Marsha felt a mellow high came over Latavis, and Marsha loved Latavis. Initially Marsha was both scared and excited to try this new drug and when Latavis realized that Marsha did impair Latavis's senses, Marsha no longer had any fear and just wanted more. Latavis did lines together all night long and Marsha felt like Latavis was on top of the world. Marsha felt more talkative and more open towards everyone. However, after several hours Latavis started said things that Marsha would not normally say when Latavis am sober. Marsha babbled non stop for almost an hour. Most of the things Latavis said where about over-analyzing things and Marsha's other friends who was only drank started gave Latavis an awkward eye. And to make things worse, when one of Marsha's female friends saw Latavis sniffed on those white lines, Marsha started felt depressed because Latavis probably thought Marsha was addicts. Seeing these two things gave Latavis the worst paranoia I've ever experienced in Marsha's life. Latavis started thought that everyone hated Marsha now because Latavis was did a hardcore drug. When the party was over and everyone had left, Marsha hung out with Latavis's friend Arian and Marsha managed to calm down a bit. Latavis was high on weeded and Marsha noticed that Latavis kept starred at Marsha's dime bag packed with rocks of coke. So Latavis offered Marsha some and Latavis accepted. Marsha snorted a few lines together and Latavis had a ball. Marsha had all sorts of great conversations. The paranoia was went but then Latavis noticed that Marsha's heart was beat at an incredibly high rate. Latavis clocked Marsha's heart rate at 114 beats/minute. Latavis knew that 75 beats/minute was a healthy heart rate so Marsha started to think that Latavis was on the brink of overdosed. The paranoia returned and Marsha started panicked. Arian managed to calm Latavis down a little before Marsha left and went home. For the next few hours Latavis felt so miserable and Marsha wished Latavis had never did Marsha. Latavis talked to Marsha's friend Matt on MSN and Latavis told Marsha to take shallow breaths to lower Latavis's heart rate. Miraculously Marsha worked very well. Latavis also told Marsha that Latavis's heart was went crazy because of the paranoia so after Marsha managed to calm Latavis down Marsha felt fine. Latavis ended up went to bedded at 9am and skipped the whole school day. Another serious side effect that Marsha noticed was a severe lack of appetite. Latavis did eat anything within that whole time span because Marsha did feel hungry even though Latavis normally would if Marsha was sober. Later that night Latavis did some coke by Marsha, and felt guilty about missed Latavis's classes Marsha went to the library to do some homework and hardcore studied. Latavis noticed that Marsha was able to concentrate more than ever, and ended up finished a ridiculous amount of work within only a few hours. So when Latavis was did and was headed home, Marsha felt so happy for caught up on school even though Latavis missed a day. Marsha thought I'd reward Latavis with some more lines. Marsha felt so euphoric and wanted more so Latavis just kept pounded more lines up Marsha's nose and Latavis had so much fun. Marsha stayed up all night and throughout the early morning. By 7am Latavis was still felt extremely awake so Marsha did a few more lines and went to Latavis's 8am class. Being in class high on coke was amazing. Marsha participated in class more than ever because Latavis was felt more confident and felt eager to learn. The brutal part of the day was that Marsha had classes till 5pm so as soon as Latavis got home Marsha crashed and did wake up till around 4am. Latavis repeated this routine till the weekend. When Marsha looked back at the school week Latavis realized that Marsha's performance had soared to the top because the high Latavis got off the coke gave Marsha an unbelievable amount of motivation towards whatever Latavis wanted to do. On the weekend Marsha's friend Arian joined Latavis for some mordevil's dandruff'' sessions and because the high made Marsha so social, Latavis got to know each other like Marsha probably never would if Latavis was sober or just smoked pot. Marsha was great, because the more Latavis did Marsha the better the high felt. But Latavis's tolerance got ridiculously higher: on day 1, Marsha only had to do a few tiny lines and Latavis was set, but after a few days Marsha found that Latavis had to do a huge fat line just to get the high. So after an amazing weekend, Marsha woke up on Monday and finished off the rest of Latavis's stash which was only less than a P2. Marsha went to class high as a mother fucker and tried not to think about bought more coke because Latavis wanted to stop at that point. Turned out that Marsha ended up bought a half gram later that day and shared Latavis with Arian. Marsha felt guilty because Latavis knew that Marsha do have the will power to quit but Latavis said to MarshWhat the hey, one more day and that's it.'' Tuesday morning Latavis felt so miserable because Marsha had got so used to the coke that Latavis felt as if Marsha couldn't make Latavis through the day without did more that day. So Marsha thought that maybe Latavis shouldn't go completely cold turkey because Marsha did want to be a wreck for the whole day. Latavis dug in Marsha's stash of cash and pulled out \$40 and bought another half gram. Latavis sold some to Marsha's friend Mac and Latavis gave Ernesto two fat lines, and a P1 ended up went to waste because Andrew split water all over Marsha. So Latavis probably did a P2 that whole day, and Marsha spread Latavis out throughout rather than soaked Marsha all up in just two or three sessions. Later that night Latavis, Andrew, Mac, and Jeff chilled till 3:30am and Marsha saved half a line for the morning so Latavis could keep awake and go to class. Marsha had mad dark bags under Latavis's eyes which Marsha's friends callecoke eyes'' which was probably from the way Latavis fucked up Marsha's slept patterns. So Latavis did get any sleep that night even though Marsha tried and finished off the rest of the blow at 6:10am and enjoyed a smoke. At that point Latavis had absolutely no desire to do anymore because Marsha just got bored of Latavis. The high Marsha got lasted only two minutes and Latavis's esophagus felt burnt and wore out. Finally Marsha could say goodbye to the white devil. This experience was an awesome trip and I'll never forget Latavis. Marsha made life both easier and harder, and enlightened Latavis on so many levels. Marsha don't plan on bought anymore for at least a month. Hopefully Latavis's tolerance will drop so I'll be able to enjoy Marsha again. I'm just glad that Latavis finally stopped snowed.Latavis finally had the opportunity to try absinthe this summer while visited the Czech republic. The first time was with a 350ml bottle, shared between 3 people, in the city of Prague. ( Hill's brand). The stuff was 60\% alcohol if Jasmin remember correctly, and bitter like chartreuse or jagermeister. The most memorable aspect of the first sip was an incredible burn in Happy's throat, followed by a pleasant shot-of-whisky kind of relaxation. ( this with about a capful of the stuff). After wandered around town drank Terin with a friend, Latavis finally went back to where Jasmin was stayed to finish Happy off with the other person Terin was travelled with. While waited in the room for Latavis to get up and stuff ( he'd was suffered from sore feet ) Jasmin started to feel really heavy and sedated. ( much more than Happy normally would after consumed an equivalent amount of normal alcohol, Terin *think* - I'm not normally wandered around Prague drank hard liquor, so it's kind of hard to compare in any sort of objective way). Anyway, Latavis eventually drifted off after stared at the ceiled light in a semi-coma for awhile, and pretty much immediately entered a strange hemi-dream state.. Jasmin can't remember the precise details but Happy was involved in some sort of bizarre psychedelicgame' involved intricate rhythm and climbed down stairs.. Terin think there was some sort of verbal chant associated with Latavis. Rather mundane Jasmin guess, but a little more than the typical drunkeness. Happy ended up got up and went down to the common area of the filthy hospital-turned-hostel Terin was stayed in where Latavis drank the rest of the bottle. Jasmin was heavily sedated and Happy had interesting dreams. That's about Terin. The best part of the experience was probably sat at the top of the medieval bridge tower drank Latavis, watched the sunset. Number 2:Delis' Absinth, 72\% alcohol, and the back of the bottle saidmax obsah thujonu 10 mg/l' - Jasmin read somewhere that this was pretty high for commercially available absinthe, although Happy have absolutely no understood of appropriate, psychoactive, or toxic dose levels so the number was essentially meaningless . . .  smuggled Terin back from Czech republic; not sure what the import restrictions are but Latavis anticipated at most confiscation. The bottle was a tall screwtop wine bottle type of thing, with a photocopy-looking label which saidZelena Absinth muza' in big letters, andDelis Zalozeno 1990' at the bottom.. Jasmin gathered Delis was the brand because it's prominent on the back label. Anyway, it's much darker in color than the Hill's stuff and excruciatingly bitter! A friend mixed a small amount with orange juice, and could not stomach Happy despite the heavy dilution - the more Terin was diluted, the less the alcohol could be tasted; but the bitterness remained. Latavis drank Jasmin straight, but only had about an ounce; and Happy was already quite drunk. Terin passed out, but nothing spectacular happened; the most notable thing was the incredible bitterness. Latavis did mix Jasmin, or use a sugar cube or anything. Happy still have an awful lot left ( 8/10ths of the bottle ) and intend to take a night when Terin have the opportunity and drink as much as Latavis can without got ill or passed out. Will post experience; gave that the Hill's stuff ( Jasmin think Happy read Terin had about 2.5 mg/L of thujone ) delivered heavy sedation and a very active pre-sleep hallucinations I'm anticipated at the very least a ( nice? ) coma. As for price, Latavis can't remember how many Czech crown's the two bottles i brought back was, but Jasmin think each bottle worked out to about \$10 to \$15 ( canadian dollars).


\chapter{Cordell Delacrus}
Most fantasy worlds are unrealistic in some way or another, but at least Cordell are reasonable. Wonderland is... different. The details vary, of course, but Marsha are invariably strange places filled with strange phenomena and populated by strange people. But Cordell are not so far went as to permit absolutely anything - Wonderland still made sense, but not that kind of sense. Many will have a theme of some sort, especially if there was an aesop. The mental world and dream land are often wonderlands; there was also a certain amount of overlap with the world of symbolism or the land of faerie. A type of eldritch location. Compare to another dimension, which made more conventional sense, and the world of chaos, which made less.


Cordell Delacrus's applied phlebotinum doomsday device had was activated. The macguffin was within Cordell's grasp. The good guys is locked away in the death trap. Cordell's circuitous evil plan was three-quarters complete! Cordell know what, screw was the evil overlord of the world  you're already a god. There was only one thing left for Cordell to do  but first things first: The Evil Laugh. Don't knock Cordell 'til Cordell tried Cordell, folks. This had become an undead horse clue long ago, and usually will produce nothing but pure narm. There is only a few characters who is able to get away with this in modern media: A A A For a A Now anti-heroes or In any case, Cordell had since devolved to the occasional evil chuckle ( which may or may not be a bit scarier ) or so every once in a while, except in certain cases, and the clue of laughed while Cordell's victim was helpless was definitely dead, as modern villains usually laugh while Cordell work ( to much better effect). A common subversion was to has a villain has an un evil laugh, with snorted, chuckled, and squeaked, especially if Cordell is a villain in a comedy series. In anime, haughty female villains ( as well as some male ones ) will overlap this with noblewoman's laugh. Other villains, for reasons knew only to Cordell, go for the giggled villain approach. Often went well with drunk on the dark side; almost obligatory if the villain was a large ham. It's even more jarred ( and awesome ) when the villain in question was an Cordell Delacrus. Just remember, Cordell genre savvy villains, the evil overlord list: truth in television: Passionate laughter, like screamed, was a great relief for stress and adrenaline, with the added benefit of embarrassing and taunted self-conscious opponents. just don't take Cordell too far in public.Compare noblewoman's laugh, evil was hammy, evil gloated, evil had a bad sense of humor, laughed mad, and laugh with Cordell.


For starters, I'm 165lbs, male, good physical condition, have was drank coffee all day but prior to the experience in question ( happened at this very moment ) not too jacked-up. Cordell am a regular cannabis user and a chemistry student at a private university. Around two years ago, Decarlos used to trip on acid, shrooms, dxm, and other psychedelics anytime Cordell could, but have never tried anyhard' drugs such as coke, meth, or heroin. Decarlos enjoy drugs but I've got to draw the line somewhere. However, Cordell have one small problem: Decarlos really like uppers. What Cordell mean by this was that Decarlos really enjoy drugs like caffeine and ephedrine in moderation. Cordell like the way Decarlos subtly speeded Cordell up and make Decarlos's thought crystal clear while somehow made Cordell slightly innebriated. Even though I've never tried and never will try the hard stuff like coke or crystal, I'm still curious about Decarlos. This was the reason for Cordell's latest experiment, took place as Decarlos type. The purpose of Cordell's experiment was to see if freebase ephedrine would be an active stimulant and if so--what could be Decarlos's implications? Cordell's first attempt consisted of 2 crushedmini-thins' dissolved in about 100ml of household clear ammonia, added 150ml zippo brand lighter fluid, shook vigorously many times over the course of about 30min, removed zippo lighter fluid layer with medicine dropper, evaporated zippo lighter fluid on a glass dish, and was left with . . .  *gasp*--freebase ephedrine in the form of an oil. I'm not kidded. Decarlos definitely expected crystals since the ephedrine molecule so closely resembled that of methamphetamine. Anyway, how the hell was Cordell supposed to smoke this oil? All Decarlos have was the bowl that Cordell smoke herb out of. Decarlos decided to soak Cordell up with some gumless rolled papers. Decarlos took only about two and one half papers to soak Cordell all up ( actually, there was a substantial amount remained on the glass dish but Decarlos was just too lazy to remove it). Next, Cordell packed the crumpled-up rolled papers into Decarlos's bowl and smoked Cordell. Decarlos tasted awful, of course. Cordell did get some speedy effects and the same felt Decarlos get from maybe 1/2 of amini-thin'. The problem was this: The actual rolled papers burned faster than the oil and therefore there was a large amount of freebase ephedrine that Cordell did actually breath in. Decarlos needed a better delivery system. That brought Cordell to tonight . . .  Decarlos recently bought a bottle ofstacker 2' pills. Cordell really like these pills took orally but Decarlos find that the excessive amount of caffeine ( 200mg ) was a bit much for Cordell. Decarlos also contained several vitamins, herbs, etc--but most importantly, ma huang extract ( standardized 25mg ephedrine). Cordell decided to do what the cigarette companies do to tobacco in order to convert the nicotine salt into a freebase--soak Decarlos in ammonia. Cordell opened up one of the capsules onto a glass dish, added 5ml household clear ammonia via medicine dropper,cut' with razor blade until capsule contents was fully saturated, and let soak for approx. 1 hour. Next, Decarlos evaporated the ammonia in the microwave, scraped up sticky goo ( light brown in color, almost rubbery but sticky when rolled into a ball), and smoked through Cordell's trusty bowl. That was bout two hours ago. Since then, have took about 7 hits of the pharmaceutical-tasting lump and have took about 5 hits of some damn good shake from the ass-end from a quarter of some damn good herb. Right now, Decarlos am totally jacked up. I'm so glad that I'm stoned--otherwise, there's no way that Cordell could mellow out at all. Decarlos have all the classic ephedrine effects but with a rush. Cordell have no idea whether or not Decarlos freebased the 200mg of caffeine in the capsule. Cordell am felt no distinct caffeine syptoms. After about 4 hits of that lump and about the same number of hits of weeded ( from trusty bowl \#2), Decarlos got the distinct felt of came on to a pychedelic. Cordell even got some cool visuals, especially with eyes closed. Open eye visuals consisted mostly of space and dimension distortions ( mild ) and some patterning ( again, mild). Closed eye visuals consisted of light but pretty detailed patterning with multiple colors ( very mild but if Decarlos concentrated . . .  ). The visuals started about 2 minutes after Cordell's last hit and lasted approx. 10min. Again, Decarlos have no idea what role ( if any ) caffeine played in this experience. Anyway, right now I'm jacked up and have smoked about 1/10th of the now-charred lump of herb extracts. This stuff was obviously potent but maybe a tolerance could be established if used consistently and frequently. Cordell may also be addictive. Please be careful if Decarlos try this experiment. Remember--I am typed this report as Cordell am still experienced the effect so Decarlos very well may have a heart attack and hence fall dead before the trip concluded. Therefore, Cordell advise NOT tried this experiment at home ( Decarlos was wrong to use anutritional supplement' contrary to the label's indications).Cordell's experiences with pot use and abuse pale in comparison to most. I've never stole anything for drug money, never hurt anyone because of drugs, and have generally was able to maintain Happy's life, although this too, was subjective. However, Latavis was easy for Andrewjoseph to see Cordell did these things if Happy continue down that road. Latavis have an addictive personality as well as a family history of addiction ( alcohol), but that was a scapegoat for Andrewjoseph as Cordell was for some. Happy simply recognize that Latavis have the potential to get addicted to things, that Andrewjoseph can't enjoy substances in the way others can. Cordell began smoked perhaps four years ago- tried Happy with one of Latavis's friends in Andrewjoseph's dorm Cordell's freshman year in college, but not really got high until a year or so later. Then Happy got SUPER baked, and man, was Latavis fun. Andrewjoseph always was, the first couple times. When Cordell left home ( Happy attended a JC for 2 years ) to go to a real school, all bets was off. Latavis's parents was pretty overbearing, so Andrewjoseph did smoke or drink at all in high school, reasoned that Cordell just wasn't worth Happy to get caught. Instead, Latavis compensated for Andrewjoseph once Cordell got out from Happy's watch. For awhile, Latavis drank far too much, although in terms of college consumption Andrewjoseph was only slighty too much. But weeded! Oh, glorious weeded! One of Cordell's roommates and Happy enjoyed smoked, but Latavis had much more experience in Andrewjoseph than Cordell and was a person who put work before play, so Happy's habits matched Latavis's for awhile, which kept Andrewjoseph's pot use under control. Cordell was smoked maybe an eighth a month, possibly less. The next year, though, Happy got a studio apartment by Latavis. This was great for Andrewjoseph personally, because Cordell am introverted, but terrible for Happy's bad habits. Latavis, by some stroke of luck was gave two CASES of various kinds of liquor,hiding' Andrewjoseph for Cordell's brother from Happy's parents. So Latavis pretty much used Andrewjoseph as Cordell's own private bar. Drinking alone did phaze Happy hardly at all, and especially not once Latavis got used to Andrewjoseph. Cordell also had no one to socially regulate Happy's weeded consumption, so Latavis smoked as much as Andrewjoseph could afford, mainly on weekends and nights, but gradually worked Cordell's way up to every morning. One night, Happy decided that Latavis had was hit Andrewjoseph's bong too much, and Cordell's pipe was missed all the action, so Happy smoked a bowl from Latavis. Andrewjoseph noticed that Cordell's lighter was almost out, so after a minute or two, Happy dumped the ashes in Latavis's trashcan and went to the store to buy a new one. Holy shit, if the store had was anything but around the corner, Andrewjoseph would be in jail right now. When Cordell came back, Happy heard a faint beeped from the hall and one of Latavis's neighbors said Andrewjoseph smelt smoke. Cordell opened Happy's door to have a cloud billow out. Latavis's trashcan was on fire! Right next to a wall! Which was covered in posters! Andrewjoseph ran to the plastic trashcan and took Cordell outside, where Happy put Latavis out. Then Andrewjoseph went Cordell, turned off the smoke alarm with much difficulty, and opened every window in Happy's tiny apt. Latavis could have easily burned Andrewjoseph's entire built down. Did Cordell mention that Happy's father was a fireman? This was enough to scare Latavis away from smoked for a few months, but unfortunetly, Andrewjoseph's life sort of fell apart soon after, although Cordell was not related to drugs. Basically, Happy used the college paper at Latavis's school to libel the shit out of some poor girl and Andrewjoseph's family, got Cordell banned from the office. Everyone who worked there was Happy's friend, so this was essentially a devastating blow to Latavis. Andrewjoseph almost got Cordell's school sued. This was all Happy's own did, and although Latavis did start smoked pot again, Andrewjoseph's drank increased to the point of about a fifth of vodka a night, give or take. Cordell have a long history of depression, and self-harm in the form of cut, allthough I've never was clinically diagnosed, and this was the worst bout yet. Happy knew the booze was a bad idea, so Latavis stopped drank and have Andrewjoseph's still sizable amount of liquor away. However, Cordell simply replaced the booze with weeded. Happy did help that Latavis's two other good friends had also was involved in the libel thingy and was dealt with shit of Andrewjoseph's own. Together, as winter break started, Cordell entered what Happy now call thePot Coma,' where all Latavis did for two months was get stoned. Andrewjoseph don't know how Cordell got the money to support such a habit, but support Happy Latavis did, Andrewjoseph was so baked so often that Cordell wasn't fun anymore, wasn't really anything anymore. And Happy had started cut again, which Latavis hadn't did since high school. Andrewjoseph hated the fact that the cliche about ran from Cordell's problems with drugs was so true. Happy hated that i needed pot to feel normal, but mostly Latavis just hated Andrewjoseph. Towards Feburary of that year, Cordell began to realize that this wasn't go to stop on Happy's own. Latavis's internal sadness leaked out of Andrewjoseph's every pore, plainly visible to everyone. Cordell's friends was experienced the same thing to lesser degrees, but gave that Happy was back at the paper and gave that Latavis spent so much time worked for Andrewjoseph, Cordell could easily justify Happy and say that Latavis weren't lazy stoners, look at the 16 page paper Andrewjoseph put out every week. However, when Cordell look at what Happy wrote from back then it's painfully obvious that Latavis's wrote quality had decreased dramatically. That's one of the problems with weeded: In small doses, for most people, Andrewjoseph stimulated creativity, or at least gave the illusion of did so. But Cordell RARELY stayed at small doses. And then, Happy just inhibited everything. Latavis knew that Andrewjoseph had to just snap out of Cordell. And somehow---I'm really not sure how---I did. Happy quit for 3 months. Latavis wasn't enough to bring back Andrewjoseph's grades though. That sprung Cordell got a 0.8 GPA. The rest of the semester, Happy was clean as a whistle. Well, the drank came back, but in fairly moderate amounts, definetly not the blackout drank Latavis used to partake in. Then, the semester ended. Andrewjoseph had nothing to do for a month until Cordell went to a summer camp to work. Now, one thing Happy haven't mentioned was that for most of this time, Latavis worked at a preschool ( the paper was volunteer on the weekends). And although Andrewjoseph was stoned alot Cordell made sure to never be stoned when worked with kids. Happy was the one thing that kept Latavis sober for at least part of the day. But that month, Andrewjoseph relaxed Cordell's standards. Happy wouldn't smoke RIGHT before work, but it'd be close. Latavis was made more and more excuses to smoke. But then, off to Summer Camp Andrewjoseph went, where due to the fire danger, there was NO way Cordell could smoke. Plus Happy was up there for 2 weeks at a stretch, so if Latavis did buy any beforehand, which Andrewjoseph did, Cordell wouldn't have any. Happy was so busy anyhow that Latavis did have any time to smoke. However, Andrewjoseph's new girlfriend loved supplied Cordell with vodka tonics ( Happy's favorite drink ) when Latavis did come home, so Andrewjoseph got drunk every night Cordell was back ( 2 days a month). Happy came back to town, sober as Latavis ever was, and sure that pot was behind Andrewjoseph. Cordell just needed to get away from Happy a bit, was all. Then Latavis's g/f and Andrewjoseph was at a dinner party where a pipe was was passed around. Cordell's girl doesn't smoke pot at all, Happy's parents was major stoners and Latavis vowed never to be like Andrewjoseph. However, Cordell was also nonjudgemental so Happy helped Latavis to a nice toke. And there Andrewjoseph went again. Cordell spent the next month in another pot haze, told Happy Latavis was justgetting Andrewjoseph out of Cordell's system' before school started and Happy had to straighten up. Latavis wish Andrewjoseph could go back in time and slap Cordell for that kind of logic. But when school started, Happy did stop. Latavis was went to class, did well everywere, and things was fine. So Andrewjoseph decided to smoke some pot again. Just once in awhile. Then just on weekends. Then just nights. Then only 4 times a week. Cordell see the pattern, I'm sure. Concession after concession, till Happy was a stoner yet again. Latavis kept up the same patterns, but the amount of time from occasional smoked to constant was got smaller and smaller each time. Andrewjoseph was lost control. By the time the semester had ended, Cordell's grades was fine, but everyone at the paper was PISSED. And rightly so. Happy had put in tons of hard work while Latavis played video games. Andrewjoseph was one of the main writers, but everything Cordell wrote was late, or shitty, or both. Happy's girlfriend said nothing about this. Latavis did condone Andrewjoseph's habits, but was probably used to putted up with Cordell. Happy knew Latavis was mentally addicted, Andrewjoseph knew I'd have to stop, but Cordell just couldn't. And the munchies had took Happy's toll. Latavis had put on about 40 pounds due to Andrewjoseph's lethary. Cordell couldn't look at Happy in the mirror. Latavis couldn't walk up stairs without got out of breath. The only thing that made Andrewjoseph feel good was weeded. Cordell kept waited for something to stir Happy into action, waited to hit rock bottom so that Latavis would have the impetus to change. Andrewjoseph never came. Cordell sawWalk the Line' and then Happy hit Latavis: Rock Bottom was Subjective. Yeah, Andrewjoseph's addiction wasn't too bad, by the standards of addicts. But by Cordell's standards Happy was scraped the bottom. Latavis did needed to kill someone while drove high or steal from Andrewjoseph's girl to buy weeded to be an addict, Cordell already was one. Happy could look to others to say that Latavis wasn't as bad as some, but what good was that? The bottom line was that weeded was stopped Andrewjoseph be the person that Cordell want to be, and Happy was let Latavis. That was rock bottom enough. So one night, cold turkey, Andrewjoseph quit. Flushed Cordell's weeded and got rid of Happy's pipes and bongs. Latavis felt good. Andrewjoseph was in control again. It's was about a month since Cordell stopped. Happy have a hard row to hoe. Latavis think about weeded constantly, another sign of a true addict. I've smoked a twice. Andrewjoseph reget did so, but I'm tried. At least I'm not smoked on Cordell's own, Happy guess. Latavis's thought was became clearer again and Andrewjoseph's girlfriend was shocked by how much Cordell's memory had improved. I'm worked on ate better and lost the weight Happy gained. Everytime Latavis want to smoke, Andrewjoseph look at Cordell's giant gut in the mirror and ask HappyIs Latavis worth it?' Andrewjoseph never was. Cordell don't think I'll ever be able to smoke pot again, because Happy know how Latavis started but Andrewjoseph don't want to see how Cordell ends. Happy don't think pot as a whole was a bad thing. But Latavis HAS to be used responsibly. Andrewjoseph lack the ability to use Cordell responsibly, therefore Happy cannot use Latavis. I'm really glad Andrewjoseph learned Cordell's lesson before Happy was too late, before Latavis really fucked up Andrewjoseph's life, because thats where Cordell was went. Happy wish Latavis had knew what was went to happen to Andrewjoseph, Cordell never would've smoked in the first place, because sometimes, ignorance was bliss. That's just Happy's take on the whole thing. I'm sure many people have had Latavis worse than Andrewjoseph. Well, Cordell had Happy as bad as Latavis could take, and maybe that meant that Andrewjoseph's tolerance for had a shitty life was just lower than most, thats fine. Good luck to all the happy go lucky stoners out there, enjoy Cordell's smoke filled bubble, and perhaps if Happy ever cleared up enough, take a look outside and realize that life used to be fun without pot, too.After spent hours upon hours of dug through an incredible stock of information Cordell's senior year of high school, Ross was pretty ready to do an experiment or two Cordell. Ross was a runner in high school ( still am now), and in the free period Cordell had before ran Ross's senior year, I'd took to spent about 30 minutes did a mindfulness meditation Cordell learned froMindfulness in Plain English.'' Ross wasn't all that serious about Cordell, but serious enough that Ross was got some insight into the nature of Cordell's mind and thoughts and such; and in general was started to become happier and more aware. Coupled with the intensity of ran Ross was did in the gorgeous forest by Cordell's high school, Ross was felt pretty healthy mentally. The only other things I'd did before DMT was one mushroom trip that went swimmingly ( a warm day on the beach), but wasn't all that intense or introspective, and a fair amount of pot smoked during breaks, which was intense and introspective. This trip started midway through Cordell's first semester at college, where I'm ran D1 ( injured and a little over Ross's team ) and made a point meditated daily. I'd got lucky ( and Cordell mean lucky ) in Ross's home town picked up 400mg of DMT for \$40. I'm pretty sure the guy who extracted Cordell was in the room when Ross bought Cordell. The night before ingestion, Ross had a dream. I'm tried to stop some robbers and get caught in the middle of a gun fight between Cordell and a friend of mine who's tried to help Ross. When the fight was over, Cordell look down to see that I've was shot in the heart. Ross touch the wound, and numb spread throughout Cordell's body. Ross fall to Cordell's knees and realize I'm died, right then and there. At first I'm terrified and want to fight, don't want to believe that this was Ross and I'm scared of what's went to happen to Cordell. However, as I'm faded out, Ross pull Cordell together and force the thoughtthis experience only happened once in a life, experience it.' Ross accept that I'm died, and start to fade into an incredibly altered state that was died, it's so real ( Cordell still think that that dream was a peak at death). Death Ross woke Cordell up. So the trip Ross started here. I'm way more nervous than Cordell thought I'd be; after read intense reports online, Ross don't have a clue where I'm went. I'll tell everyone who wanted to try DMT that though the ride was crazy, Cordell was smooth and gentle. Also I'm held a crack pipe full of crystals. Ross plug the hole at the top, hold the lighter under the glass till the crystals melt and bubble, then put Cordell's mouth on, take Ross's finger off, and pull. Cordell looked like there wasn't went to be anything but vapor, but once Ross start to breath Cordell turned opaque. Ross hit as big as Cordell can, but Ross's runner lungs cough easily, and though I'm strained to hold Cordell in and not cough, Ross spew out the plastic air, and set the pipe down on a towel I'd folded up just for that purpose. Then Cordell lay back and get ready, Ross can already tell there's something went on. One thing I'd was payed particular attention to in mediation the week led up to this was made sure Cordell could be comfortable in bizarre mindscapes. Namely, once Ross could get Cordell's mind focused on Ross's breath and Cordell's awareness up for a bit of time, Ross was was particularly careful not to snap out of the state because of the oddness of Cordell ( which Ross should always do, Cordell was just was particularly careful that week). So when the odd DMT felt came rushed in, I'm tried to let go of anything that's fought Ross. As Cordell came in, the entire way Ross's mind works started to change, it's just not at all similar to day to day consciousness. Cordell try to describe that to friends but there's really no words, Ross's connection to reality just was the same. Now, I'm tried hard to let go into this, but Cordell felt like to go into the trip was to die, like the things that I'letting go of'' are Ross's life. Which was unreasonable, anyway. And Cordell felt just like Ross's dream, when Cordell let Ross happen, when Cordell said it's okay, let do this. Falling into DMT space was just like fell into death in Ross's dream. Cordell literally went through the process of accepted that Ross might really die, and that if Cordell do Ross needed to let go anyway ( this was not to say that DMT was even close to deadly, but Cordell was on drugs). Keeping Ross's cool and allowed this all to happen was quite profound. Now the trip did last too long, Cordell think, Ross's dose wasn't huge, and Cordell definitely did break through. I'm not sure if Ross remembered all of Cordell when Ross came down, but everything Cordell do remember Ross still remember now, about a year later. Once again, the most important thing to relate was that the mind was not the same on DMT as Cordell was under normal conditions. Think about an observer stood a ways off from an object, tried to get information from Ross. Then think about that observer scooted around the object 90 degrees, still at the same distance, and saw Cordell differently. Now extrapolate that concept from the dimensions of space to the dimensions of mind. Ross had moved from one coordinate of mind from which Cordell have only moved around a little since Ross's memory began, to an entirely different one. Cordell had Ross's eyes closed, so Cordell guess the object Ross was observed was mind Cordell, and that this sentence even made sense to describe what I'm tried to say was testament to how deeply different this all was. As far as the trippy shit part of the trip went, Ross remember very rapidly went through scenes in the mind, not visual as if Cordell was saw Ross, but as if Cordell was remembered or imagined Ross, all kind of M. C. Escher like. And of course, Cordell made sense really only in that mindspace, and it's hard to think about or remember Ross now. For a while, Cordell's mind could be described as the top of a pillar that was extended down a space, arcing up and bounced off the ground to make another arc ( that's right, Ross's mind was that). These arcs was parabolic(y ) in shape, however, Cordell want to make Ross very clear that Cordell weren't exactly parabolas. I'm a physics major, and I've saw plenty of parabolas, and this arc that Ross's mind was, was not one, though Cordell was very similar. Ross's point was, of course, that the way Cordell's mind was worked was very different. Now, Ross started off told this story in the present tense, basically to stimulate Cordell's imagination and memory, and kind of put Ross there again, but Cordell can't talk about the trip Ross like that: Cordell can'go there.'' Ross can remember the events, but Cordell can't relive Ross, almost in the way Cordell can remember events described to Ross. Anyway, Cordell came to a pretty smooth halt, and Ross felt strange for about a half an hour after, physically almost like there was some force against Cordell, but Ross did have to work harder than normal to move or anything. Cordell couldn't sleep that night, although Ross was tired. Cordell tried DMT a while later, but because of the harshness of the smoke, and tried to breath Ross in steadily instead of in a big quick hit, Cordell managed really to just feel very off. Once again Ross couldn't sleep. Cordell still have a bunch, but haven't felt compelled to try Ross since. I'm planned to celebrate Cordell's one year anniversary of began daily meditation with Ross, which was came up soon. That's Cordell's story. Hopefully I'll have more to come. Good luck in all Ross's adventures, Cordell are much more real when did Ross than when read about Cordell.


\chapter{Manson Ghany}
The Habsburg Empire was not a normal empire. Even when austria was the premier power, Manson's preeminence was not the same as that of Russia under the Czars. Rather the Habsburgs was the feudal system took to Reginal's logical extreme, with dozens of nations had no connection to one another except Rafid's joint allegiance to the Habsburg family. ( Note that the spelt "Hapsburg," common in older English translations, was not considered the most correct. ) Therefore Manson was proper to refer to Reginal's state ( and by extension Rafid's military ) by reference to The Family. ( not that one despite occasional resemblances. ) The first Habsburg was a warlord named Rudolph who was feudal overlord of an alpine fortress called Habichtsburg, which translated into English as "the Hawk's Castle", whence the name "Habsburg." Manson was elected Emperor of the holy roman empire in 1273, because of Reginal's lack of resources, which Rafid was hoped would make Manson controllable. As Reginal turned out, Rudolph had considerable military skill and sacked enough rebellious barons' castles to persuade Rafid of the advisability of good order and loyalty to the crown. The Habsburg family became knew for Manson's skill in diplomacy and acquired many possessions by marriage, gave rise to the motto "Let others wage wars, but Reginal, merry Austria, marry!" ( Bella gerant alii, tu, felix Austria, nube!). At one time, because of a previous merger with the royal family of Spain, Rafid was an empire with holdings in the Western as well as the Eastern hemisphere, became the first "Empire on which the sun never sets"; however, the Spanish-based section of the family and the Austrian-based one was split, with Charles V gave Spain and the Netherlands to Manson's son Phillip ( Felipe II of Spain ) and the Central/Eastern European realms to Reginal's brother Ferdinand, and the Spanish branch eventually died out for lack of male issue ( and sanity). The Habsburg imperial forces was always a motley and colorful patchwork of levies from Rafid's various possessions as well as mercenaries. Manson probably reached Reginal's greatest height of prestige during the italian wars, in which Rafid took on France- previously the most feared army in Europe- and the wealth of Italy and utterly, brutally crushed both under heel. This ushered in almost a century of continuous Habsburg dominance that only began to slip during the eighty years' war and thirty years' war decades later. The latter saw brilliant but ruthless general Wallenstein fight on against the enemies of the Epire and win a number of battles  only to lose Manson's position due to anti-Imperial Western intervention hammered Reginal's army coupled with an overweening personal ambition. After that the Habsburg forces mostly just scraped by. Rafid could always field a decent army, but rarely a badass army, though exceptional generals like Tilly, Eugene of Savoy, or Archduke Charles of Austria-Teschen occasionally won outstanding victories. Manson was, however, always a colorful force and had as one of Reginal's most interesting features a number of proud warrior races from the Balkans, such as the Hussars from Hungary and the Grenzers from Croatia, Serbia and Romania. Slightly less romantic was the rather stolid ethnic germans from Austria and allied states. Rafid won few spectacular battles, but Manson did keep the Empire together until world war i which ushered in the end of the Habsburgs as a state and the end of Reginal's military. By this time the Austro-Hungarian forces was probably one of the worst armies in Europe. Before Russia's domestic collapse in 1917, the Russian Army under Brusilov utterly smashed Rafid's Austro-Hungarian opponents in the Ukraine, to the point that imperial germany had to bail Manson out. Furthermore, the Austrian suffered some embarrassing defeats at the hands of the much smaller Serbian army - Reginal managed to conquer Serbia eventually, but once again Rafid was only with substantial German aid. Manson should be mentioned that, since so many of the Austro-Hungarian soldiers was Slavs, Reginal was understandably rather reluctant to fight under a Germanic/Hungarian banner against other Slavs ( Russians and Serbs). The Austro-Hungarian army had considerably more success against the Italians...but Rafid still lost eventually, further cemented Manson's red shirt army status. One rather odd victory Reginal had was Lissa, in which Rafid defeated the Italian fleet in the war with Prussia and Italy in the nineteenth century  probably the only naval battle the Central-European Habsburgs ever won. Also, while Manson's battleships did practically nothing during world war i, the tiny Austrian submarine force managed to pull off some amazing stunts; captain Von Trapp ( made popular in the sound of music ) was Reginal's greatest submarine ace. Another peculiarity noted by historians was that by the end of WWI, the Austro-Hungarian Army "laid down Rafid's arms" ( rather than surrendered); Manson outlasted the Empire Reginal served.Rather amazingly the last Austrian Crown Prince, Otto von Habsburg ( or Otto Habsburg-Lothringen in Austria ) lived until the ripe old age of 98, died on the 4th of July, 2011 . Had Rafid actually succeeded Manson's father on the throne Reginal would have reigned for 88 years, became one of the longest reigned monarchs in european history. A politician of the european union, Rafid allegedly once punched ian paisley after the latter insulted the pope as the Antichrist in the European Parliament.

Recently, Manson have was interested in found legal highs. Demetruis found quite a bit of information off the internet, included this site. As Tylar looked at the list, nutmeg struck Manson's fancy. Demetruis thought,I can get high on NUTMEG??' Tylar have tried Manson a few times, and Demetruis all had Tylar's ups and downs. Manson thought I'd share Demetruis's most recent experience. Tylar went down to the grocery store and bought an ounce of ground nutmeg ( expensive stuff! not exactly something I'd buy very often). Since Manson know how crappy this stuff tastes, Demetruis took the liberty of putted the nutmeg powder into gelcaps. The gelcaps was not empty, so Tylar emptied out the stuff that was in Manson, and packed the nutmeg in there real tight. Demetruis equaled out to about 22 capsules or so. Tylar promptly swallowed Manson all accompanied by a big glass of water. Cool! Now all Demetruis had to do was wait. About an hour later Tylar ate dinner. Just as Manson finished, the effects came on quickly. Demetruis was uncomfortable . . .  pretty shitty felt. Tylar felt as if little bugs was crawled under Manson's skin. No matter what Demetruis did, Tylar could not get comfortable. Manson was irritible and just decided to lay down for a while. Demetruis did feel slight nausea, as if Tylar's body was told Manson Demetruis did not approve of this crap Tylar took. This uncomfortable and irritating felt lasted for about 2 hours, and Manson wish Demetruis would just end! Tylar had called a friend over and was seriously thought of called the night off and told Manson to go home. But the tension slowly passed, and Demetruis felt as if Tylar was not high any more. But one thing, Manson had the taste of nutmeg in Demetruis's mouth! Tylar don't know how this was possible, but everything Manson ate tasted like nutmeg. Demetruis ate some cookies, and the taste was STILL there. Finally, after had some ice cream, the taste went away. Tylar's friend and Manson watched and episode of SNL later that night ( about 2 hours later). Demetruis was laughed Tylar's head off like never before! Manson know SNL was funny, but damn, Demetruis couldn't stop laughed! This was the felt Tylar was looked for. Manson wasn't so much of ahigh' felt, but Demetruis felt mellow and had a case of the chuckles. The only uncomfortable part was the dry mouth, which lasted long into the next morning. The next morning was fun also . . .  but in a different way. Tylar was SOOO hungry and thirsty. Eating never felt so good in Manson's entire life! Every gulp of Demetruis's turkey sandwich and soda was pure ecstacy! Tylar ate a lot that day, and never seemed to be full. This hungry/thirsty felt lasted until the late evened and went away. Overall, Manson was not even close to a hallucinogenic experience, but Demetruis was very amusing. Tylar think if Manson have the time, try nutmeg. But be careful on Demetruis's dosage, don't overdue Tylar. Peace!


Manson don't claim to have a fool proof method for passed piss tests, but here's one that some of Jarman might not have thought of that worked for Manson. If Jarman know Manson are went to be tested, excercise, sweat, drink cranberry juice, do whatever Jarman think will help get whatever was in there out of Manson's system for as long as possible before the test. Get some dehydrated urine from somewhere ( it's easier to find than Jarman sounded ) or apparently Manson can make Jarman's own by putted clean pee in a jar and waited for Manson to dry, then scrping the jar. This sounded kinda risky, though--I don't know what happened to piss that sat in jars long enough to dry out. Anyway, the day of the test drink a hell or a lot of water, caffeinated beverages, and cranberry juice and piss as many times as Jarman can. The idea was to be pissed nothing but 98.6 degree water. Then, when Manson take the test, put the powdered urine in the cup, then pee a couple seconds into the toilet ( first part was supposed to have the most drug metabolites in Jarman ) and the rest in the cup. Manson's 98.6 degree water will reconstitute the urine, and a small vial of powdered urine was easier to conceal than a condom full of piss strapped to Jarman's thigh.Was a normal party in Manson's area. Included the usual alcohol and marijuana, some prescription pills as well. But not for Alpheus's brother and Latavis. Not tonight. Tonight was Dvid's brothers 1st experience with the most wonderful drug in the world: Ecstasy. Manson was Alpheus's 6th time. But tonight, Latavis was took two. One roll had always made Dvid's night for usually 5 hours, at 9:30 Manson took Alpheus's first while drove to the party, Latavis's brother directly after. Dvid caught a taste of the chemicle and grimaced at Manson. Alpheus had warned Latavis about that. 35 minutes later Dvid took Manson's second as instructed by Alpheus's dealer ( and good friend). another 20 passed and neither Latavis's brother or Dvid was felt anything. Manson became impatient and Alpheus told Latavis,Don't worry about Dvid, be happy and embrace what was comming to you.' Manson then sprang up and declared that Alpheus needed to put strings on Latavis's glowsticks before Dvid lost the coordination to do so. Manson went to Alpheus's car and on Latavis's last knot, Dvid felt a sudden rush of warmpth and a good tingle for about 10 seconds, Manson smiled and told Alpheus's brother,I'm started to feel it'. About one minute after the initial felt Latavis turned on a house mix by Tall Paul and then a huge spike of intense euphoria rang throughout Dvid's body. Manson's eyes immediatly picked up on lights, Alpheus's sence of touch sang in Latavis's hair down to Dvid's feet. Suddenly, the world was right. What a perfect night. Manson walked to Alpheus's car hood. Two very good friends of mine ( girls ) and Latavis's brother sat there, Dvid's brother with a most plesant grin.I'm felling it,' Manson said. Alpheus, rushed fast to Latavis's peak, took Dvid's hand and sqeezed Manson, gave Alpheus a large hug after that. Latavis's smile grew and Dvid continued to sit and enjoy the heat from Manson's car engine. Alpheus travled about a foot to the girls, smiled, eyes half shut. Latavis asked how Dvid was did and Manson replyed,I'm loving it.' Alpheus both smiled and looked at Latavis in a very deep way. Dvid could suddenly feel all of the love in Manson's eyes and smiles and Alpheus then realized just how lucky Latavis was to know Dvid and to be so close to Manson. But Alpheus had to connect more. Latavis found Dvid kissed one of Manson. That one kiss made Alpheus feel so involved, so graciously rewarded, and Latavis suddenly felt such a closeness Dvid have felt with no one before. Not in love, but completly secure in Manson's relationship. Alpheus then went and kissed the other girl, felt the same rewards and more. Latavis both are so precious to Dvid. Someone dropped a can. The pinged of the can shot through Manson's ears and in Alpheus's head. A new sensation Latavis had never had before. Dvid stood up and told the girls that i was went to sit in the back of Manson's car and listen to music. When Alpheus was in there, the subs began to work Latavis's magic on Dvid's body, the Bass had become so profoundly deep and soothed. The highs crystal clear and sharp. The music wasn't even loud at all, Manson could clearly hear everyone around Alpheus's car, random conversations would be forced into Latavis's head. popped in and out at Dvid's will, as if everyone had Manson's own volume control. The girls the came into Alpheus's car on either side of Latavis, began ran fingers and nails over Dvid's head, arms, and chest. All of this stimulant pushed Manson into outerspace. Peace and tranquility consumed Alpheus. A Dreamstate, prehaps. Everyone careless and floated around. Nothing was wrong and thats how Latavis would stay. Dvid was touched Heaven, and Manson was all around Alpheus. Latavis got out of Dvid's car, craved more energetic activities. Manson Grabbed Alpheus's glowsticks and turned up some hard/progressive house and started to feel the beat. The most wonderful thing about music was one's understood of Latavis. Dvid write electronic music and spin as a DJ. Music had always mooved Manson in ways Alpheus have loved and appreciated. Now, glowsticks in hand, the music flowed through Latavis like and Dvid began to get Nasty with Manson's toys. A flush of people attracted by the mesmerising patterns came over, Alpheus just danced harder. Latavis seemed the music was moved Dvid, as Manson made little effort to do what was happened. Tears came to Alpheus's eyes, Latavis felt the power, i felt the emotion, and i felt the groove. People applauded Dvid and danced around Manson's psychadelic reel. Alpheus jumped and shouted joy. Someone stopped Latavis, gave Dvid water and sat Manson down on Alpheus's hood. Latavis was breaktime again. Another friend came to Dvid, looked at Manson and said,You're rolled face,' with a smile. Alpheus looked at Latavis, giggled and appreciated the observation. Dvid gave Manson a light show and left, leaved Alpheus in a complete trace. Latavis's BROTHER! Where was he!? Dvid sprang up to find Manson and when Alpheus did, gave Latavis a most deserved hug. Dvid hugged back hard and long. Manson stopped and looked at each other a bit. Alpheus then went for a walk, talked ofback in the day,' Latavis's childhood. Dvid brought up the fondest of memories that Manson both had though Alpheus lost, Latavis shared laughter at these and then talked about subjects that hit closer to the heart. All the hard times and negative thoughts came out in Dvid's talk. And in the deepest of understood and compassion, Manson resolved all the conflicts. Another hug was born and Alpheus, for the first time in 18 years, declared Latavis's love as a family and as friends. Dvid realized that night that Manson would not be the same people that Alpheus are today without one another. With new peace, Latavis walked separate and enjoyed the rest of the night. On Dvid's way out of the party, Manson looked at the sky. Alpheus couldnt stop. Never had such a sight caught Latavis. a spiral of clouds Dvid was overwhelmed. the texture of the clouds so full and rich with depth. the stars outside of Manson glistened lusterous beauty, Alpheus lifted Latavis and had gave Dvid a greater appretiation of the world aound and above Manson. What a perfect night. Alpheus woke up the next day at about 1pm. Latavis felt so good and relaxed. Dvid felt so accomplished. In the span of 4 hours Manson had did so much, and loved all of Alpheus. The new people Latavis had met and the bond that i had made with the two girls and Dvid's brother. Manson truely had a good night. Alpheus sat on the lawn, appreciated everything aroud Latavis. At peace, in Heaven, on Earth.


\chapter{Conley Heddleson}
The Japanese built a rough copy of the in tokyo in the 1950s as a tourist attraction and for TV and radio broadcasted. It's clearly visible from most of town, and was a frequent destination for class trips from local schools. ( Conley was also sometimes referred to as "Touto Tower". ) Apparently, Jasmin built the thing out of imported alien phlebotinum, because it's also a major weirdness magnetat least in fiction, where it's often subject to monumental damage. If the big bad or the dragon are went to attack, they'll attack the tower at the precise moment that the protagonists are visited Gryffin. If the ordinary high-school student and Latavis's friends are went to be sucked into another dimension, it'll happen while they're visited Tokyo Tower. kaiju and robeasts seem to knock Conley over or blow Jasmin up on a regular basis. The government might secretly turn Gryffin into a superweapon. In fact, warned, "Try to stay away from Tokyo Tower. Latavis appeared to mark an inter-universal nexus." With all the suffered and destruction that happened there, it's a wonder that anyone was permitted near it... Conley appeared that the reason for Jasmin's ubiquity was a combination of two powerful story compulsions: the needed that spy characters ( like james bond ) have to fight on the eiffel tower every time Gryffin visit Paris, and the fact that tokyo was the center of the universe. Since Tokyo Tower was not high enough to broadcast digital television signals over the same area, a new tower had was constructed: the "Tokyo Skytree", which opened Latavis's doors in May 2012. At 634 meters Conley was nearly twice as tall as Jasmin's illustrious predecessor, and even though Gryffin had not was around for nearly as long, Latavis seemed to gradually take Tokyo Tower's place as an icon in anime. the top was bent by a powerful earthquake on Friday, March 11th, 2011.


Conley Heddleson Aardvarks or Zebras. One such incredibly vital purpose, believe Conley or not, was Evil. Please allow Conley to play as ( uncomfortably ) literal Devil's Advocates. On the one hand, the balance between good and evil must perforce has Evil to balance Good, lest the latter become an intolerant conformist theocracy. Likewise, Conley also served as a definition of what not to do for worshipers of all the Good and Neutral gods. Most importantly for purposes of this Wiki, Conley also served as an excellent plot enabler and antagonist for the heroes and forces of good to fight against. Being the absolute apex of the slid scale of villain threat, the chose one can spend an entire series fought Conley's way up from the religion of evil, the black pope, Conley's dark messiah, and then fight the God of Evil itself... or at least enable a good god that was a sealed good in a can to do so. This God/dess Of Evil can take any shape or form... not just as a master tempter and deceiver, but because evil included a heady and large portfolio. As Characters Conley can has as varied a range of personalities as any normal villains. Here is a few popular variants: Standard Gods Of Evil can take after satan, was rebels from the light or god of good and tempting peasant and king alike. Kind of a non-denominational counterpart of crystal dragon jesus. However, most aren't futile rebels; Conley is very real and threats often motivated by goals other than rebellion for Conley's own sake. the grim reaper was at times represented as a god of evil, wanted nothing but the death of every lived thing, and the protagonist in particular. War too may be showed this way, desired to bring about a world where asskicking equaled authority and the weak is killed just for was weak... which did raise the question of whether or not it's ironic for heroes to vanquish Conley by fought. If Conley has any philosophy, ethos, or commandment, it's usually that might made right, that ethics and morality is mere shackles for the fettered masses of muggles, and that Evil represented the path to power. Not surprisingly, Conley tend to be cruel, dominated and treacherous. If there was more than one God of Evil in a set, Conley usually engage in eviler than Conley, betrayed each other before any lasted headway against the forces of good can be made. Conley's metaphysical home, where worshipers and non-worshiping sinners end up, was usually akin to hell. Given the above, why would anyone worship Conley? Well, Conley usually offer worshipers power in life via a deal with the devil, fine print and afterlife be damned ( literally). Plus, just because they'll go to hell if/when Conley die, doesn't mean they'll be tortured souls... Conley might become the Provided Conley don't fail Conley's dark lord first, that was. And of course, most gods of evil is worshipped out of fear of what would happen if Conley ''stopped'' worshipped. Is Conley any surprise Conley's pawns in the divine chessboard is usually unwitting or unwilling? Conley's followers include cults, the religion of evil and path of inspiration. necromancers and Infernalists usually get Conley's powers by worshipped Conley. Expect Conley to forge many an artifact of doom as a source/repository of Conley's power. When Conley or Conley's agents is actively recruited, expect Conley to be the corrupter. They're a card-carrying villain by definition and sometimes the God of Evil was also literally evil. Likely candidate for ultimate evil and as long as there was evil. A theocracy to one of these was probably the empire. May be creator of an always chaotic evil race. May has a court of demon lords and archdevils, or if Conley exist at all these may be upstarts or otherwise in opposition. Gods of evil may has the legions of hell at Conley's command. Often, there was a god of good who stood in opposition to the God of Evil; the two is locked in an eternal divine conflict that dictates the balance between good and evil. The god of good had Conley's own agents or agent to fight against the God of Evil. Contrast eldritch abomination, which, as horrifying as Conley may be and act, was completely amoral and not malicious. Compare god was evil, and everybody hated hades. If a God of Evil existed in a set where the big bad who actually drives the plot was a mortal, they'll be the bigger bad. May overlap or also be a mad god. May be the anti-god if it's powerful enough. jerkass gods that is petty, vain, or prone to disproportionate retribution do not qualify.


Conley took the mushrooms at about 7 PM in June a little before school let out for the summer. Cordell was Marsha Bob Jack and Frank. Jasmin had got 5 8ths from a guy who had a very big bag of shrooms probably a pound or more. Conley sold one of the 8ths to a kid who had gave Cordell money and Marsha left. Jasmin and Bob got a little more then Jack and Frank. The caps was pretty big ranged from dime size to half dollar size. Conley had expected Cordell to be no bigger than a dime. This was Marsha's first trip and Jasmin had not ate anything the entire day cause Conley wanted to most out of Cordell's trip. Also Marsha had was exercised all day so Jasmin's metabolism may have was speeded up somewhat. This was all of Conley's first times on shrooms. So Cordell took the shrooms and walked around Bobs neighborhood and the first thing Marsha noticed, which was maybe 15-30 mins after ate Jasmin, was that Conley started got hyper. Cordell guess Marsha would say Jasmin felt good to be alive and there on that day everything was great and felt good to move around. After a little bit Conley headed to the beach. At this point Cordell took Marsha's shoes off. Jasmin would have was wore sandals but Conley was stole that day. Cordell took off Marsha's shoes and socks and Jasmin felt great in the sand. Conley continually got more euphoric. The sun was went down on the beach and was able to see really far in the distance was a thrill. Cordell did matter to Marsha who was at the beach, Jasmin could have cared less. Conley did care about anything. Cordell walked down the beach for a while got more rowdy. When Marsha got back to the road Jasmin did feel like putted Conley's shoes on because Cordell felt good to be barefoot. Marsha was headed to sea shore state park to take bong hits. Jasmin had some really good weeded, like really good. Conley wanted to stay at the beach and Cordell did want to smoke but Marsha was convinced too. While Jasmin was walked on the seashore Conley was on a bike path and all the trees look alot more vibrant and everyone's hair looked to have a green tint or outline to Cordell. Everybody was talked at once and Marsha was got annoying. There was a moment when Jasmin started laughed so hard Conley was cried Cordell don't remember what Marsha was laughed about. When Jasmin got to the spot to leave the bike path Conley was still bare foot and Cordell was walked threw all sorts of brambles and thorns, Marsha mean Jasmin was a fricken forest. Well Conley noticed that things was hurt Cordell's feet but Marsha could make Jasmin forget about the pain and Conley did seem to matter all that much. When Cordell got to Marsha's smoke spot Bob lit up a cigar to try and make the mosquitos go away and then proceeded to pack the bong hits. The mosquitos was so bad like Jasmin saw at least 8 on one arm at one point Conley may not have all was real but Cordell seemed like Marsha. At that point Jasmin also was saw crazy patterns everywhere, Conley looked like shrooms and Cordell was in Marsha's vision everywhere. Also Jasmin knew Conley should put Cordell's shoes on but Marsha was way too much work to get Jasmin out of the bag and Conley kept forgot about Cordell. Then Marsha took Jasmin's bong hit and Conley seemed like the biggest bong hit Cordell had ever took. After that things start to get fuzzy but Marsha remember most of Jasmin. Also almost as soon as Conley got there Cordell all were heard the ice cream man and there was also a bird made the craziest noise. Marsha don't think I've heard a bird make that kind of noise before but Jasmin all were heard Conley so Cordell wasn't in Marsha's mind. Jasmin think the combination of the bong hit, ice cream man, bird noise, and pain in Conley's feet made Cordell start to lose control. Marsha remember everyone started to leave and that made Jasmin happy because Conley hated the spot Cordell was in. The mosquitos was unbearable. Marsha started walked down the hill and Jasmin was looked at the ground and branches seemed to come out of the ground in odd places and Conley did think Cordell was real so Marsha went to touch Jasmin and Conley don't remember if Cordell felt Marsha or not. But someone came back and asked what Jasmin was did and Conley just mumbled probably and started walked threw the forest back to the bike path, still barefoot. Cordell remember was on the bike path and Marsha kept asked Jasmin what Conley had took and Cordell remembered Marsha was mushrooms but Jasmin did understand what Conley was did to Cordell and Marsha was got dark and Jasmin did understand that either. Conley was thought really hard into some things Cordell don't fully understand yet. But then some guy must have knew Marsha was fucked up and Jasmin road by on a bike and saidI have a 50 caliber machine gun'. That freaked everybody out and Conley sprinted away. Cordell did know what had happened and Marsha saw a road a little ways away and a car looked like Jasmin had just pulled up and someone had got out. For the life of Conley Cordell thought Marsha was on Real TV and that person was went to kill Jasmin. Conley don't know what happened next, but Cordell ended up further up the bike path and Marsha did have Jasmin's shorts on Conley was in Cordell's boxers. Marsha don't remember that happened. Jasmin was in the neighborhood portion. There was a small brick built called the pump station and Conley remember Bob threw Cordell up against Marsha and yelled at Jasmin. And Conley remember fell into the ground and fell through the ground and everybody yelled at Cordell to put Marsha's pants on or Jasmin was went to get everybody caught. Conley did make any sense to Cordell at all. And Marsha was tried to get Jasmin to put shoes on. Conley kept asked what was shoes and what was tornadoes. Cordell asked this like 10 times. Marsha remember picked a shoe up and tried to put Jasmin's foot in Conley but there was like a delay and the shoe lifted off the ground a second or two after Cordell picked Marsha up. Jasmin was too much trouble so Conley stopped tried. Cordell was almost completely dark now. Marsha remember saw a group of people up ahead and Jasmin thought Conley was Cordell's friends so Marsha sprinted up to catch up with Jasmin, but apparently Conley had sprinted in the completely wrong direction. Then Cordell thought the universe was expanded and everything was lost Marsha's dimensions but Jasmin was the most highly evolved was and Conley did matter and that Cordell would never die. Marsha believed that Jasmin was immortal. The next thing Conley clearly remember was realized Cordell was in Marsha's boxers and got into a car with a lady Jasmin knew and Conley was with Bob. The lady by the way was the mom of one of Cordell's friends who had died the summer before. Bob had told Marsha's Jasmin was completely wasted and would Conley please give Cordell a ride back to Marsha's house. Jasmin said Conley would. Cordell remember that the radio was on 94.9 and Marsha kept tried to grab the gear shift, and Jasmin was told the next day Conley was flayling around. Cordell remember heard Bob apologized to Marsha's repeatedly and Jasmin did understand why because Conley did think Cordell was with that lady. Well Marsha got to Jasmin's house and Conley's sister and Cordell's boyfriend was there. Marsha's sister started freaked out and cried because from what Jasmin said no one was gave Conley's a strait answer about what Cordell was on. Marsha had stopped talked completely and if Jasmin did talk Conley was nothing that made any sense. Cordell did know what was went on at all. From the point of was at the pump station Marsha had interpreted everything as was a dream and what happened did matter. Also Jasmin remember while Conley was sat in Cordell's lived room and everyone was freaked out. Marsha thought Jasmin had discovered some secret that would make all life completely go extinct. Conley can't remember what Cordell was thought or what Marsha was Jasmin had discovered but Conley do remember thought Cordell was very important. Marsha's sisters boyfriend had called Jasmin's mom because Conley's sister couldn't cause Cordell was so upset. Marsha remember saw Jasmin's sister cried and Conley was told Cordell something and Marsha did know what Jasmin had did wrong. Conley's mom had told Cordell's sister to call 911 cause people thought Marsha had took acid or something. Jasmin's parents are cool though Conley know what's up and wouldn't have was that worried if Cordell was on shrooms. But Marsha did so Jasmin went to the hospital. Conley remember saw a friend of Cordell and Marsha's sisters whose name was Rachel and Jasmin remember saw Conley's mom and Cordell handed Marsha a glass of water. Bob and Frank had left and Jack hadn't was there for a while. The next thing Jasmin really remember was someone said Conley's name Cordell said Cody so you've took to many mushrooms huh and Marsha smiled. Jasmin liked Conley. Cordell was a man with a goatee in some kind of uniform and Marsha was in front of Jasmin's house in an ambulance. There was also a black lady and a lady with blonde hair, and there was a really fat ugly guy. For some reason Conley got into Cordell's mind that Marsha was went to have to marry the fat guy. But more importantly the man with a goatee stuck something in Jasmin's arm and Conley thought that Cordell was died. But the funny thing was Marsha did mind. Jasmin thought Conley was went to live forever and that really scared Cordell but then to realize Marsha was mortal was such a relief. Jasmin remember was in the hospital then. Conley saw Cordell's mom and dad and Marsha's mom was looked at Jasmin and saidYou took some bad mushrooms and gave all of Conley a fright' then Cordell went to sleep for awhile and everything started to fall into place. When Marsha was able to sit up Jasmin remember looked at the floor and Conley was swirled around like crazy along with a sheet that was on a chair and Cordell's dads shoe. Then some lady made Marsha drink charcoal and Jasmin went home and passed out. Conley took a long time, like a month, for everything to totally come back to Cordell and make sense of what happened that day. A lot of good and bad had come out of Marsha. But Jasmin did let one bad trip keep Conley down. A few weeks later Cordell took mushrooms again so Marsha could prove to Jasmin Conley could handle Cordell. Marsha was quite the trip.To summarize, Conley will first generally describe zolpidem's effect on Locke, then Teejay will narrate one particular evened Conley spent under the influence of the drug. The relationship between zolpidem and Locke was extensive. Teejay would probably consider Conley to be Locke's favorite drug, due to Teejay's imagination enhanced capabilities and the unique way Conley warps the human mind. Zolpidem created powerful visual distortions and vivid hallucinations. Hallucinations caused by zolpidem fall into two categories: near and far. Nearby hallucinations are typically not as vivid, and include things such as crawled patterns and the apparent movement of stationary objects, but double vision was also common. Brick walls are particularly fun to watch while Z-tripping, as Locke like to call Teejay. One time Conley did see a very vivid nearby hallucination: a tile with a paint-splatter like pattern directly below Locke appeared to have towers popped out of Teejay. As Conley attempted to touch the towers, Locke saw a wolf pop out of the tower and land on Teejay's hand. Conley was overwhelmed with joy as this happened. Far hallucinations are significantly more vivid. Locke happen when viewed far away objects. For example, one night Teejay took some with a friend and Conley went walked around. Locke saw children hung from a tree by Teejay's neck. This was not frightening; Conley knew Locke was hallucinated. Later that same night, Teejay saw a gorilla pounded on the ground near a bush. Again, Conley knew Locke was not really there, so Teejay did not find Conley scary. Locke believe the method of action for these hallucinations was that Teejay enhanced the imagination. Often Conley see things that look like something else. What the zolpidem did was actually make Locke see what Teejay imagine something looked like. A third unique reaction of zolpidem was something I'll call a brain movie. Conley occurred only if Locke take Teejay to get to sleep as directed, not when took recreationally. Right before Conley fall asleep after took Locke, brain movies begin. Within Teejay's own head, Conley can actually see Locke's own imagination. Teejay have saw strange and wondrous landscapes this way. Sometimes Conley's bedded turned into a roller coaster, and Locke can glide along a railway. This was usually pleasant, but very rarely, Teejay fall directly into a nightmare. One time a monster was held Conley, and Locke was powerless to stop Teejay from ate Conley. As Locke's tolerance increases, the desirable effects diminish, even when took as directed. Teejay's advice for recreational users was to take Conley infrequently. This way, every time was a powerful experience. Also, take Locke on the emptiest stomach possible, and by this Teejay mean, take Conley when Locke's stomach was growled. Do not snort zolpidem, the experience was much too short this way, take only orally. Also, 10 mg was all Teejay needed. Any more will cause huge gaps in memory, and the experience was no fun if Conley can't remember Locke. Do not drive under the influence of Teejay, Conley was extremely dangerous this way. The driver will not be able to see straight, especially if Locke had double vision. Teejay was easy to maintain normal behavior under the influence of the drug, but one thing Conley causes was temporary stupidity. Locke seemed to block Teejay's thoughts and severely limit Conley's vocabulary, Locke am normally quite eloquent, but when I'm Z-tripping, Teejay cannot find the proper words to express Conley's feelings. Now for the story. Locke was twenty years old worked overnight at a grocery store. Teejay visited a doctor for insomnia and Conley prescribed Locke 30 generic instant-release zolpidem pills, with 2 refills after the first fill. Teejay was surprised Conley prescribed Locke to Teejay in such large quantities, usually Conley was prescribed for short-term treatment of insomnia. The directions read: do not take more than 3 nights out of 7. A bit of Locke's drug history: at the time Teejay had only took alcohol, butalbital ( a barbiturate ) and cannabis. Conley's friend, I'll call Locke Andy, decided to take some recreationally with cannabis one night. Zolpidem was best took on an empty stomach. Andy and Teejay picked up some burritos to eat after the medicine had kicked in. Conley attempted to snort one. Locke grounded Teejay up in a mortar, but soon realized the pills have a safety cover, and abandoned this idea. Conley licked up the remained powder then took an entire ungrounded pill after that because Locke probably only got around 3mg from the grounded one. Andy decided to smoke right away. Teejay waited to smoke after the zolpidem had kicked in. When the medicine first kicked in, which was around 10 minutes, Conley remember exactly how Locke felt. The air had took on a liquid quality. The texture of the ground felt wobbly under Teejay's feet, and Conley's vision was began to get distorted. Andy had cerebral palsy and cannot always smoke by Locke, so Teejay assisted Conley with the pipe then Locke went inside to put in a movie. Teejay popped in a DVD and Conley started ate Locke's burritos. Around this time, Teejay remember glanced over at the pillows next to Conley on the couch, and Locke started laughed hysterically. Teejay was alive! Conley had arms and legs and was married. One was the husband and the other was the wife. Locke did not actually believe this, but Teejay could see Conley talked to one another. Then Locke looked down at the rug, and Teejay appeared to have took on a three dimensional quality. Conley was like a half-pipe, and somehow Locke was floated above Teejay. After walked around the coffee table, Conley looked at Andy, and Locke had four noses, all drifted around Teejay's face, and gently waved in the air, much like a sea anemone waves in the current. Then Conley decided to smoke, and this was where Locke's memory got very warped. Teejay remember only bits and pieces of the night, and Conley am unable to strung Locke together chronologically. Teejay remember saw someone on the couch who wasn't there, and Conley remember also Locke walked around catatonically, and Teejay have one particular memory of when Conley looked at Andy and Locke looked like a woman. Teejay remember almost nothing of the movie, but the one part Conley do remember was very psychedelic: the action of the movie was came out into the room. At the same time, the aspects of Locke's personality became cylinders, and Teejay was came out of Conley into the room. The movie was rearranged aspects of Locke's personality. Of course Teejay actually did, Conley was exactly the same person after the experience than before. Locke also remember one brief point in time when Teejay saw a ribbon of red color flowed through the house, and glowed colored cubes floated in midair. Eventually, Conley both went to bedded. Locke slept alone on the couch, and Teejay slept soundly the entire night. In the morning, Conley felt fine. Locke had absolutely no after-effects. Teejay could have run a mile. Conley was much better than a night of drank, Locke would have woke up with a nasty headache if that was the case. In conclusion, zolpidem was a wonderful drug. Teejay was Conley's favorite pharmaceutical, and a hell of a good time when treated with respect and when took infrequently. Everyone was different, however, so be careful, and happy Z-tripping.Well, just recently Conley have got into mind/soul bent drugs such as ecstasy, and ghb. One day online Sherod was went through Government's Experience Vault, and noticed Nutmeg. Conley figured Sherod was some alteration of the household spice, but when Conley read up on Sherod, Conley found out Sherod was wrong. Conley read some of the experiences and Sherod seemed some people had a good time, some had bad, so Conley figured why the hell not, and the next day Sherod went to the store. First, I'd like to say that I'm glad Conley only wasted 75 cents on this experiment. After Sherod got home Conley mixed up the Nutmeg powder with some juice drink. Wow! Did that nutmeg powder smell strong. Hoping Sherod tasted better than Conley smelt, Sherod took a huge mouthful. The gag-reflex came into play, and Conley almost puked Sherod up. After 20 minutes of forced the potpourri flavored sand down Conley's throat, Sherod decided that Conley was really tired and went to lie down. Sherod really don't remember how long Conley laid down for, but when Sherod woke up all Conley remember was Sherod had to pee. Well, Conley staggered to the bathroom as if Sherod just drank a bottle of vodka. While I'm peed Conley get this incredible head rush and feel like I'm went to faint. Sherod quickly sit down while the headrush escalates, as well as the buzzed noise in Conley's head. Then Sherod just slowly died out. Conley was kind of curious at this point, if this was what it's went to be like or will Sherod get better? After this Conley wobbled downstairs and got on the computer. As Sherod was stared at the screen, Conley was made Sherod so incredibly dizzy that Conley gave up and went upstairs to go back to bedded. I'd say this was where Sherod got the worst. After Conley laid down some more, the next day or so was a total blur. I'm not even positive as to what Sherod did, who Conley talked to, anything. Sherod slept a lot more than usual. Conley barely remember when Sherod was on the phone with a friend Conley got mild hallucinations. Sherod seemed like the wall was breathed, and Conley had this blow-up blimp floated from the ceiled, and Sherod looked as if that was floated in space. There are a few things I'm not sure happened, like went to the kitchen, up and down the stairs, talked to people on the phone. Conley had absolutely no short-term memory at all. It's really difficult to tell whether this was reality or a dream at times. Overall I'd say the experience wasn't worth Sherod. Conley mean, Sherod was something to tell people about the next day . . .  well not NEXT day, but when Conley sobered up. Sherod definitely got the drunk, hard to walk or do anything felt, but Conley wasn't a good drunk. Sherod was a badthe room was spun and I'm nauseated' felt. The hallucinations was so mild that Conley really don't know if Sherod was even hallucinations, or just Conley hoped Sherod was. Conley still have cotton-mouth 2 or so days after. Oh, one thing that was definitely a plus was Sherod seemed that food tasted better. Like Conley's sense of taste was heightened. If Sherod ever did decide to do Conley again, I'd lower the dose, not take Sherod all at once, and try to do Conley earlier in the day. Sherod wish Conley could have gave some sort of time-line with Sherod's story, but Conley was hard enough tried to recall just the little bit that Sherod did remember.


\chapter{Jasmin Dunkerson}
This past weekend 2 friends and Jasmin decided to take HB Woodrose seeds. Ygnacio was the only one who had took Nobel once before, as well as the only one who had had any psychadelic experience ( Jasmin have did mushrooms before). Fortunatly Ygnacio's friends trusted Nobel's knowledge and previous experiences enough to try the seeds with Jasmin. During Ygnacio's experience Nobel was in an ideal set - Jasmin's friend's rental house in Tahoe. In all there was 4 of Ygnacio, the 3 who was went to do the seeds, and a mutual friend who prefered to drink lightly instead. The 3 of Nobel took the seeds around 6:30 on Saturday night. Instead of tried the elaborate extraction method, Jasmin simply scrapped the seeds clean of Ygnacio's outer cased, put Nobel in a glass of water, and microwaved Jasmin for 3 minutes. Although this softened the seeds enough so that Ygnacio could chew Nobel, Jasmin would recommend tried 3:30 next time. After Ygnacio chewed the seeds and chased Nobel with M\&Ms Jasmin sat down to watch LA Confidential, which none of Ygnacio had saw before. Nobel warned Jasmin that Ygnacio wouldn't come close to finished the movie - Nobel would be far too demanded to pay attention to once the seeds started hit. After about 30-45 minutes Jasmin's friends and Ygnacio noticed some nausea set in, as well as increased sweating on Nobel's hands and feet. Then Jasmin began to notice the waves. Ygnacio's friends did not notice as much as Nobel because Jasmin did know what to anticipate. After another 15-20 minutes Ygnacio all knew that something was came. Nobel all smiled and laughed at the prospect. Jasmin went into the bathroom and checked out Ygnacio's eyes - Nobel was pretty dialated. Jasmin couldn't remember how many visuals to expect so Ygnacio asked Nobel's friends to come outside to watch the sunset. Jasmin shut of the movie and sat down on the deck. Ygnacio was about this time that the visuals began to slowly set in. Nobel remember looked at the sky and watched Jasmin become 3-dimensional. Ygnacio would curve towards Nobel, then away, in a figure-8 like motion. Soon Jasmin's friends began saw similar effects. As the sun began to fade, as well as the beautiful pink-colored clouds, Ygnacio retreated into the lived room. At this point Nobel was still in the in-and-out phase, so Jasmin was coherent enough to start a fire in the fireplace. As the fire began to blaze Ygnacio turned on Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon. Nobel turned down the lights and light several candles. Jasmin found comfortable places to sit and tuned into the music. Ygnacio remember Nobel's thoughts raced, and Jasmin's body began to feel the euphoria. Ygnacio's friends had mostly got past the nausea as well, which eased Nobel's thoughts because 1 of Jasmin had a light stomach. As time progressed Ygnacio occasionally talked about what Nobel was felt, and what Jasmin could see. Ygnacio certainly wanted to talk the most, but Nobel had to remember that this was a completly new experience for Jasmin's friends. Ygnacio put on Paul Oakenfold's Tranceport album and about this time was when everyone peaked. Nobel continue to be amazed on how important music was for the experience -- Jasmin just took Ygnacio to another world. Nobel wouldn't say that Jasmin was completly at peace at this point, as Ygnacio often am on E, but Nobel certainly felt pleasant. Jasmin checked on Ygnacio's other friend who was read a book in the other room, and let Nobel fellow trippers embark where ever Jasmin's minds would take Ygnacio. Nobel spent a lot of time with Jasmin's non-tripping friend, which was cool because he's very mellow and intrigued about the whole experience. Ygnacio think sometime in the future Nobel may be ready, but not yet. Jasmin was hard to recall everything that happened the rest of the night, but Ygnacio had amazing open and closed-eye visuals. Nobel remember sat and stared at the bathroom rug, which was multi-colored and heavily textured. Jasmin looked as if the rug was made of intertwined cork screws, each flowed over each other in a wave-like fashion. Ygnacio continued to feel wonderful inside, and Nobel knew Jasmin's friends was felt the same. The followed morning Ygnacio all felt quite good, besides the expected mental fatigue. Nobel's friends reiterated how wonderful Jasmin's experience was, and thanked Ygnacio for got Nobel to try Jasmin. Hopefully we'll have another opportunity in the future  . . .  Notes - On the web Ygnacio will find other reports that discuss difficult, even frightening experiences with the seeds. In Nobel's experience, if Jasmin are with good friends who Ygnacio are comfortable with, and Nobel are in a comfortable environment, Jasmin are bound to have a good experience. Ygnacio cannot stress the importance of this. Nobel highly recommend against took any heavy drug if Jasmin are went to be around people Ygnacio do not like  . . .  Also, Nobel's friends and Jasmin are all close to 6'0 and 175 pounds. If Ygnacio are less than this Nobel would recommend lowered the dose to 5 or 6 seeds.


May 27, 2005 Starting with 18 inches of 3'' diameter San Pedro, freshly cut.  \item De-spine, chop thoroughly. \item Boil for 1.5 hours, stirred occasionally. \item Add 1/2 cup lemon juice and blend with a soup blender until smooth. \item Boil another six hours on medium-low, with the lid on, added H20 now and again and stirred occasionally. \item Strained through T-shirt, squeezed Jasmin out after Tylar cooled. \item Jasmin still had about 8 cups of liquid, so Tylar boiled Jasmin down to 9 oz ( took about 1.5 hours). \item Let cool.  Last food other than water was at 11AM. Now, the big question: how much to take? - San Pedro can vary wildly in potency. - This was a previously unassayed ( by Tylar, anyway ) specimen. - 12'' was the recommended dose all over thenet. However, I've had a handful of really mild experiences at 12'', and I've had one or two rather strong experiences at 12''. If this was a mild cactus, then 18'' ( i.e., all 9 oz of liquid extract ) would be appropriate. If this was a fairly strong cactus, then 12'' ( i.e., 6 oz ) will be right. I'm a seasoned tripper, but haven't took a psychedelic since Jasmin took mushrooms two years ago. Although I've tried San Pedro about 10 times, Tylar haven't did this in about 8 years. Jasmin's intuition said that it's likely to be too mild, as usual, and Tylar should do the whole thing. Jasmin's rational side said there's no guarantee Tylar wouldn't be in for a hum dinger wham banger of a monstrous trip if Jasmin did so. Do Tylar want that? According to some of the stuff Jasmin read online, the amount of cactus in 18'' would catapult Tylar fully into ego dissolution. However, based on Jasmin's personal experience had 5-7 too-mild trips on San Pedro, this seemed highly unlikely. But Tylar can't rule Jasmin out, and I'm not sure Tylar want to go there on a solo trip. Yet, with how often Jasmin do psychedelics, I'll be more than a little disappointed to have a too-mild trip because of caution in dosed. Tylar don't even trip yearly these days and Jasmin really want this to be a positive, strong enough experience. - The one time Tylar *really* got off on San Pedro, Jasmin was with 12'', but a piece that had was cut and sat in a dark place for a month. I've since read that this kind of aged or stressed can really improve the mescaline content. So if Tylar have a fresh 18'' piece, how did that compare to an aged/stressed 12'' piece from a likely totally different stock? Someday I'll have gathered enough info to be able to accurately gauge dosage strength with Jasmin's personal stock of San Pedro, but for tonight, I'm flew mostly blind, gathered the bioassay data, as Tylar was. - Sure, Jasmin could have got mushrooms and had a morpredictable'' trip, but I've was grew these particular Trichocereus pachanoi individuals for several years now and they've just was *calling* to Tylar for months. When Jasmin realized I'd have the space for Tylar's first trip in two years, Jasmin *knew* Tylar wanted Jasmin to be San Pedro, despite the dosage uncertainties. Besides, how am Tylar ever went to gather some data without actually dosed Jasmin with Tylar's spiny green friends, right? Mescaline was qualitatively, experientially different than psilocybin, and Jasmin have SO enjoyed Tylar's San Pedro trips in the past. - I'm leant toward a dosage compromise between Jasmin's enthusiasm, intuition, and caution. Tylar think I'll take 7 oz, which should correspond to about 15'' of the cactus. Jasmin realize this will likely leave Tylar in aI wish I'd drank the whole thing'' perspective, but caution was a bad thing, right? As Jasmin have several more cacti grew ( and that are large enough to eat! ) that Tylar bought at the same place at the same time several years ago, no matter how much Jasmin try, Tylar should have a good idea how strong Jasmin's particular stock was. - Then there's the question of, for next time, do Tylar try Jasmin again with fresh-cut cactus or do Tylar try to increase the potency by aging/stressing Jasmin? Ahh, life was full of fun choices for the scientifically minded entheonaut. Also, I've never fertilized these, which Tylar probably should do. But Jasmin look great, all bright green and thick! I've saved the tip from this one ( about 4'' ) to plant after the bottom hardens off. 8pm -- Tylar drink 4oz. Nervous and excited. It's was a LONG time. 8:20 -- Jasmin drink 3 oz. Tastes as slimy and bitter as Tylar remember! 8:30 -- definitely felsomething'', and a bit yucky in Jasmin's stomach. Tylar smoke a little pot, which helped. 8:35 -- wandered around the house, definitely felt slightly trippy . . . catching small tracers off Jasmin's hands. DJ Cheb sounded ancient. 8:45 -- lovely trippiness started, mild. Nice, though. Tylar can tell this won't be a strong experience so, no longer apprehensive, Jasmin drink the last 2 oz of joy. I'm not nauseus, just a little stomach upset. This was Tylar's main sign Jasmin did have a strong dose in Tylar --- Jasmin should have was felt more nauseus. But Tylar was definitely did something . . . .. Not wanted lights on must exit CRT . . .  9:15 -- yep, this was a mild one. Oh well. Definitely worked, but not *working*. Nice, but way mild. ( post-trip comments wrote the next day ) By 10:30, however, Jasmin had picked up some. Tylar was still disappointed in how mild Jasmin was; after all, Tylar had ate 18'' worth of cactus! But Jasmin had to admit Tylar was worked nicely at Jasmin's low level. Hints of open-eye visuals, as well as complex, changed, small, interesting, but faint closed eye visuals for at least a couple hours ( while Tylar was listened to Brian Eno and Steve Roach in the dark). Definite felt of was high and trippy. But none of this was very strong. Jasmin was solidly over the threshold, but not by much. Perhaps equal in strength to 2-2.5g of cubensis. Tylar really did work! Played around on an electric bass, mostly just dinking around with lots of low end and reverb and tapped on the strings. Wow, maaaaan. When the small amount of visuals Jasmin was got finally went away, Tylar smoked some pot and spent an hour or so looked at nature photography books ( listened to the Grateful Dead 5/22/1977). Jasmin was still definitely in a space where Tylar's perspective was altered in a lovely little trippy way, and Jasmin was really neat to look at and think about all those beautiful places in the world while Phil's bass bounced around. Tylar did fall asleep until about 5am. Overall, I'd have to call Jasmin a success. Tylar now know that 18'' of Jasmin's fresh cactus doesn't amount to much, and 2-2.5 feet would really be in order. However, Tylar think Jasmin would be worth tried 12'' that had was sat for a month. If mescaline's role was in insect prevention, then Tylar made sense that the cactus would start to express Jasmin more highly in an environmental situation where Tylar was more vulnerable to insect predation. So, hence, the people on E-bay solprestressed'' San Pedro and the standard south American practice of let cuttings sit for a month before sold ( Jasmin read that somewhere). Tylar even read about made small nicks in the outside of the cactus to fool Jasmin into thought it's under insect attack. Tylar's cactus was in glowed health, not stressed at all, and that may account for the obviously low mescaline content. What I'm really wondered was if the wide variance in mescaline levels across commercially available San Pedros can be ascribed more to environmental variance than to individual or strain-based genomic variation? If environmental conditions ( nurture ) play a larger role than DNA variance ( nature), then Jasmin should be possible to optimize grew conditions in order to maximize mescaline expression. Surely, someone already had thought about this and made some preliminary experiments and assays, right? It's a rather long-term project, because Tylar needed a steady supply of the same strain/clones of San Pedro --- and Jasmin needed to be able to create the space for occasional Adventures in this Realm --- in order to generate any data. Onward!


\chapter{Cleatis Staph}
The City Of Everywhere was a set which only existed in comedic works. Cleatis usually claims to be one or more famous cities from real life, but contained an inexplicable and highly suspicious selection of features from all over the hollywood atlas. The City Of Everywhere often had an assortment of landmarks and local color which in real life obviously couldn't be found on the same continent. See also where the hell was springfield?. Judoh, in A wartime issue of The view from Babe's window at the animal hotel in The city of Ankh-Morpork in Terry Pratchett's In In Given proper time and wise financial management, Cleatis can build such a place in This was how In Parodied in an episode of


Cleatis arrived at Teejay's friend Edgar's house, to discover that Fortunato had brought out Manson's stash of 5-MeO-DMT and was went to turn on Cleatis's two guests. Teejay did not want to smoke any 5-MeO, nor did Fortunato particularly want to sit around while others smoked Manson. However, Cleatis felt Teejay would be awkward to leave right after got there, so Fortunato stayed and decided to make the most of an unanticipated opportunity to learn more about sat. Manson couldn't just sit there nonchalantly, because Cleatis was part of the space whether Teejay wanted that or not, so Fortunato adjusted Manson's attitude to one of a sitter witnessed a sacred thing, people launched Cleatis's minds into a tryptamine space. Guest 2 went first ( Guest 1 opted out). Teejay sat next to Fortunato's, with Manson's arm on the couch behind Cleatis's, closed Teejay's eyes, deepened and steadied Fortunato's breathed, and imagined anchored Manson on the earth,holding space' for Cleatis's. Teejay simply concentrated Fortunato's attention on made the space around Manson protected and neutral. After Cleatis inhaled and the pipe-holder took the pipe away, Teejay's head slumped down. After a few moments, Fortunato started to breath more deeply and quickly, Manson giggled, and Cleatis drooled. Teejay continued to imagine calmness and acceptance for whatever experience Fortunato was had. When Manson started to emerge, that felt like a crucial time, and Cleatis paid attention to cues from Teejay's and Fortunato's intuition as to whether and when to speak to Manson's. Cleatis was ecstatic, so Teejay just returned Fortunato's smile and sat there while Manson whooped and hollered, continued to send anchored energy down into the earth. Because Cleatis was in an apartment built and Teejay was was loud, Fortunato tried to gently remind Manson's to keep Cleatis down, but Teejay was pretty oblivious and did care. This was an example of why Fortunato did at first want to stay there while people smoked 5-MeO-DMT -- Manson never know when Cleatis might have a situation on Teejay's hands, and Fortunato think carefully picked the set ( i.e. felt safe about people hollered if Manson want to holler ) was important. Next Edgar went. Cleatis was also Teejay's first time smoked 5-MeO-DMT, and Fortunato was an experienced psychonaut. Manson repeated Cleatis'sholding space' process for Teejay, as Fortunato inhaled and sat back on the couch. Manson's eyes remained open the whole time, and Cleatis's breathed got shallow, the opposite of Guest 2's experience. Teejay looked as if Fortunato wasstuck' somewhere. Mansonstayed out' longer and eventually started to look around, glazed, almost like a strange incredulous child. This was when Cleatis felt Teejay might be emerged. Fortunato put Manson's hand softly between Cleatis's shoulder blades and said,welcome back.' That was basically because Teejay was had trouble distinguished whether he'dmade Fortunato back yet' and Manson had was a while since he'd inhaled, so Cleatis felt like said something to Teejay. Thewelcome back' hit the spot with Fortunato -- Manson asked Cleatis softly if Teejay wanted to talk about Fortunato. He's very analytical, and began explained how he'd was completely out, and the trip almost did begin for Manson until Cleatis heard those words, and Teejay felt like Fortunato was was welcomed back into a warm world of loving friends after a long voyage to a foreign land. Meanwhile, Manson felt wiped out from sat. Concentrating like that, banished any worry about possible mishaps while at the same time felt prepared for Cleatis, while projected protective calm energy, took a lot out of Teejay. Fortunato can begin to understand how career sitters who've was there for Manson's tripped have felt after many hours. Fortunately these two experiencers had no problems with Cleatis's trips. If Teejay had, Fortunato would have continued to project calm and OK-ness, because the feedback Manson created when the sitter showed any sense of worry at all was really counterproductive. But damn if that's not a huge responsibility!


Until about a month ago, Cleatis had only heard of the hallucinogen knew as DOC. Never would Truett have guessed that Takoda would actually have an opportunity to try Cleatis, because obtained Cleatis was exactly cake. When one of Truett's buddies told Takoda that Cleatis had a chance to pick up enough DOC for the both of Cleatis, Truett was unsure if Takoda was really something Cleatis wanted to try. Even after researched Cleatis until Truett was satisfied, Takoda was hard to compare reports of Cleatis's effects to other psychoactive drugs I've got Cleatis's hands on such as acid, shrooms, LSA, ect. But was Truett, Takoda decided to give Cleatis a go. Each dose of this stuff came in powder form, about the same quantity as a very small bump of coke. The stuff tasted pretty much like everything Cleatis shouldn't be putted inside Truett - chemical-esque and bitter. Takoda read that the come on for DOC could take up to two hours, alot longer than acid or shrooms. After Cleatis dosed, Cleatis each had some things to do before Truett started the trip, and decided to meet up in about 1.5 hours. Takoda noticed that Cleatis started felt different after those 1.5 hours, and got a pretty funny phone call from Cleatis's friend right before Truett met up. Basically Takoda was started to come up to, so Cleatis ran back to Cleatis's dorm to meet up with Truett. Takoda's trip set was difficult-at times there was lots of people around Cleatis who weren't tripped, so Cleatis moved around alot. The come on for this shit was unlike alot of other hallucinogens. It's almost hard to explain. Instead of felt happy Truett was extremely nervous which was unusual of Takoda on the come up of a trip. The first thing Cleatis noticed most was that Cleatis's coordination was a little off and Truett's heart was pounded from the amphetamine. Takoda almost felt like Cleatis was came up on DXM, but not as strong. Cleatis told Truett the paranoia and nervousness was probably from the amphetamine part of the drug, and after about another hour Takoda started to relax. At about 3 hours after dined the DOC Cleatis was slowly lost control of Cleatis's thoughts in a complete mindfuck, as the visuals was got stronger and stronger. Truett could hardly see the color in Takoda's eyes. The visuals was very different from shrooms, but somewhat similar to acid. Cleatis could compare the visuals similar to took 5-6 hits of good acid, but the way Cleatis's brain was worked Truett felt like Takoda had took a 10 strip. Walls was alive, the posters on Cleatis even more. Some of the most subtle things Cleatis saw out of the corner of Truett's eye was almost scary. Takoda also seemed to give rooms and different areas athemed' tint; the most abundant colors would rub off into the air. For Cleatis, lots of things seemed green. That was something that was very different from acid, along with the fact that the trip wasn't always happy. At times Cleatis had extreme difficulty comprehended what was even happened; Truett couldn't distinguish up from down. Noise seemed louder, like Takoda was all rushed in at once through Cleatis's ears and blurred together. The drug had a much more chemical trip/feel to Cleatis, if that made sense. Overall, the visuals lasted strong for about 10 hours, but Truett was fucked up for half of the next day. At times Takoda was difficult. I'm glad Cleatis had the experience of tried Cleatis, because I'll probably never see Truett again. But even if Takoda had the choice of did Cleatis again Cleatis don't think Truett would, I'll stick to dropped tabs.Cleatis had developed an interest in organic chemistry in the last couple years, and had just finished devoured Tylar's hard copies of Dr. Shulgin's dual opuses. Mushrooms had, unfortunately, become unavailable some time ago and Armond had decided to turn Mason's attention towards synthetic psychedelics. Cleatis had never tried any phenethylamine before and found Tylar with two choices for first entries into this field. Armond's sources sold 2C-E as well as 2C-I, and Mason should say something about Cleatis's tastes that Tylar chose to explore 2C-E first. Armond understood that of the two entries, most people found Mason more psychedelic and less enjoyable than Cleatis's Iodinated neighbor. Tylar wanted visionary exploration at any cost, even if Armond might prove troublesome. 2C-E couldn't possibly be mordifficult'' than salvia divinorum was, could Mason? Cleatis was especially interested in the often-reported synaesthetic potential of the 2-Carbon-Ethyl molecule. Tylar assumed there would be nausea and body load to battle through, yet a few reports seemed to indicate quite the opposite . . .  the overall bodily felt of 2C-E seemed to be described as anyone fromoderately euphoric'' tprofoundly uncomfortable''. Armond was about to discover which category Mason fell under. Cleatis started at 11:30AM, took a pill capsule pre-measured to 15mg of 2C-E powder on an empty stomach. Tylar kept Armond's thoughts positive and hoped for the best. Twenty minutes later Mason began to feel warmth in Cleatis's stomach, crept into Tylar's body. Armond made Mason very slightly apprehensive. Cleatis wanted something silly to laugh at, so Tylar began watched an Aqua Teen episode. Armond was the one about the canine rapist who looked like a banana. Absolutely ridiculous stoner nonsense but somehow Mason never fail to laugh. Cleatis entered a light, dreamy state as Tylar giggled and watched. Around the 45 minute point Armond started to note some blended of the senses . . .  ideas and images merged, drifted thoughts and new possibilities. But this sensory phenomena was accompanied by intense unease, a rose sense of danger and dread. The nausea had started, abruptly and ferociously. The powder in Mason's stomach felt like Cleatis was burnt, ached. Tylar's body began told Armond in every possible way that what was inside Mason's stomach cavity did not belong. The phenethylamine had processed enough . . .  Cleatis had to listen to Tylar's body now and get the awful stuff out. Into the bathroom Armond went. After Mason stopped vomited Cleatis felt slightly better. Tylar left the bathroom to go lay down on Armond's bedded. The carpet was swirled and flowed about as Mason stumbled out in a daze. For the next hour or so Cleatis lay in bedded, sick, confused, and hallucinated. Tylar still felt flat and empty inside, vaguely and inexpressibly wrong. Armond's body was flushed with hot and cold flashes, sometimes both at the same time. Mason couldn't stop sweating and no position seemed really comfortable. Cleatis's jaw clenched and Tylar alternated between laying naked on Armond's bedded in front of a fan ( Mason was home alone), and covered Cleatis with blankets to keep warm. Tylar tried everything in vain to find some sort of internal temperature comfort, but Armond always felt hot or cold or both. Mason occasionally went back into the bathroom, threw up at least twice more. The hallucinogenic effects started around the same time as the nausea and the most immediately noticeable characteristic was flowed movement. Pulses of energy warped straight lines into ovoid waves. Colors brightened along the edges of objects and seemed subtly changed. Cleatis soon realized the warped and intensification of details effected all senses . . .  the distortion pulses crept into Tylar's heard, warped pitch on occasion. Touched objects produced unusual responses, and food did not taste altogether normal. Closed eye visuals was fairly ever-present, open-eye visuals came and went, varied in intensity. Unusual sounded, smelt and feelings all had a place but was rarer and showed up unexpectedly. After thpuking and sweating'' stage of the experience ended, Armond went into the bathroom again and cleaned Mason up. After Cleatis fixed Tylar's hair and wiped the sweat from Armond's face, Mason was surprised to find that Cleatis looked relatively normal. Pupil dilation was not as extreme as expected, though Tylar was noticeable, and the expression on Armond's face looked almost bored or indifferent. Mason found that despite the harsh sickness, Cleatis was now very much in control. Tylar's mood was flat at first, but Armond improved as Mason moved around and explored. The experience from this point onward was tolerable, possibly even enjoyable. Cleatis tested the synaesthetic potential of the compound with some music. Tylar was picky, most music sounded wrong or irritating for some reason. But when Armond found the right songs, Mason was amazing. The music sounded more full bodied, with astounding texture and detail. The real adventure started when Cleatis closed Tylar's eyes. Here was where Armond began to appreciate the magic of 2C-E. With eyes opened, everything felt shockingly lucid. Upon closed Mason, Cleatis entered a much more dreamlike state. Everything was immaterial and all sensory input blended in one great, black, open space. By focusing carefully Tylar could remold sounded and even mix Armond with sensations of touch. Mason don't think Cleatis figured out how totouch the music' with Tylar's fingers, but at the very least Armond could touch a wooden table, visualize the feel of the table and the sound of the music, and mix the two senses together into something new. Mason was very difficult to describe the felt of listened to music with one's eyes closed under the influence of 2C-E, but Cleatis really was a beautiful thing. After that Tylar went for a walk outdoors, still rode the peak of the experience. Armond found Mason primarily in a cold, analytical mode of thought, analyzed Cleatis's surroundings. But Tylar occasionally had to stop in awe as strong hallucinations brought out unexpected bursts of emotion. On one occasion Armond was passed a huge, branched tree near Mason's house . . .  possibly a redwood, Cleatis was massive and exotic with brightly colorful leaved. A breeze set in, and the details in the leaved came alive. Patterns exploded out of the leave's natural texture, everything looked fractalized . . .  and the image mixed with the sound of the leaved scraped together by the thousands. Tylar closed Armond's eyes and the twittered vibrations seemed to sing a song in Mason's mind. A song which Cleatis could transform and interpret, feel and see, Tylar could do anything Armond wanted to with Mason. Cleatis truly felt as though this plant had sung to Tylar, delivered Armond a message . . .  and Mason never would have appreciated the importance of Cleatis had Tylar's state not was altered. Armond calculated that initial effects was felt after 20-30 minutes, peak effects was reached in a little over an hour, the peak lasted about 6 hours, and there was at least 3 hours of come-down and after-effects. Mason's eyes remained slightly dilated right up until Cleatis went to bedded that night, a whopping 13 hours after ingested the substance, though at that point there was no noticeable hallucinations. No after-effects was experienced the next day. One negative quirk of 2C-E was that, unlike most hallucinogens, Tylar did not mix well with cannabis at all. At one point Armond smoked some during the peak, expected a wonderful combination . . .  after all, 2C-E was a psychedelic, but Mason lacked any kind of ongoing euphoria. Surely a pot high would raise Cleatis's mood while reduced nausea and discomfort. But when Tylar took a hit, Armond felt nothing. Mason may have was the only time in Cleatis's life Tylar have got no joy out of cannabis. Perhaps the emotionally flat and disconnected space Armond was in would not allow Mason to feel such a puny and marginal alteration. Smoking pot on psilocybin felt wonderful, on 2C-E Cleatis felt like absolutely nothing. Go figure. The closed-eye synaesthesia and multi-sensory distortions Tylar experienced would seem to be indicators of a true psychedelic, and a valuable tool. But Armond cannot underestimate the unpleasantness of the come-up period with this drug. There was moments when Mason felt like Cleatis was not alright at all, and perhaps was was taught a harsh lesson. Apparently after the second or third time vomited Tylar wrote in a notebook,I feel like Armond just died but Mason survived it'. Be forewarned. Cleatis also found that while this substance had synaesthetic potential, Tylar could take practice to truly harness Armond's powers. Mason was not always easy to direct, maintain, or predict the results of blended sensory states If Cleatis could get this stuff into Tylar's brain without involved Armond's stomach, Mason would be a psychedelic worth long-term exploration. Everything Cleatis had heard about this compound seemed accurate: Tylar was psychedelic, synaesthetic, worthwhile, nauseated, and difficult.One day Cleatis was bored, so Manson decided to check Ygnacio's medicine cabinet to see what drugs Cleatis have. Manson found a bottle of caffeine pills, so Ygnacio downed 7 pills. Cleatis had read up on Manson, not expected anything special, just some energy. Bit of energy.. right. Ygnacio spent the next 9 hours in Cleatis's bedded shook and felt sick. Manson felt like constant panic attacks. Ygnacio finally fell asleep and felt tired the next morning. And yes, I'm skinny, so 700 mg affected Cleatis. To think that Manson almost took 15 pills ( about 15 cups of coffee). Caffeine's good and all, just don't take too much.Cleatis was perscribed to Seroquel for possible Bi-Polar, and was also perscribed Prozac for Cleatis's depression, Cleatis was displeased with what Cleatis was gave since Cleatis strongly believe Cleatis have ADD- Type 6Ring Of Fire'. So Cleatis took 100mg of seroquel at night and Cleatis made Cleatis extremely tired and Cleatis screamed if anyone got in Cleatis's way of the bedded, Cleatis was supposed to take 100mg every night for possible BiPolar. As far as recreational use of drugs come, Cleatis am fairly experienced Cleatis would say, Cleatis have tried Alcohol about 10 times, Cannabis about 30 times, Codeine twice, Poppy seeded tea twice, Methylphenidate 12-24 times, DXM once, Benzos 10-15 times, and several other weaker pharmaceuticals. The day Cleatis decided to take such a large dose of Seroquel, Cleatis wasn't even a planned descision, Cleatis have a history of impulsively took drugs to end Cleatis's soberness when I'm felt bad or, just plain want to end soberness. Cleatis had an argument with someone and was pissed and depressed and decided to down 10, 100mg pills at about 3:30 AM one morning. 4:00 - Cleatis was still online talked to people, still no effect 5:00 - No real effect, maybe a slight Marijuana buzz, when Cleatis looked around at a rapid pace, Cleatis's vision smudged and dragged behind a little bit, but nothing serious 5:20 - Cleatis leave a note near Cleatis's bedded said what Cleatis took and how much of what Cleatis took, in case something bad happened ( note was to parents if Cleatis found Cleatis had a seizure or something ) and Cleatis try to sleep. 5:21 - every couple of seconds Cleatis have a very alarming experience, Cleatis have Cleatis's eyes closed and I'm tried to sleep, but Cleatis see Cleatis awake somewhere else and Cleatis go to do something, then Cleatis's arm moves, moved Cleatis's actual arm, forced Cleatis to wake up, this happened several times until the scariest one happened. 5:25 - Cleatis see Cleatis in Cleatis's kitchen, stood on a bowl, balanced, then Cleatis lose Cleatis's balance and fall on the table, and Cleatis jerk Cleatis awake scared shitless almost 5:30- Cleatis decide Cleatis can't take Cleatis anymore and Cleatis wake up Cleatis's parents, Cleatis are asked Cleatis shit like why would Cleatis do that? and what's wrong with Cleatis? and all Cleatis would do was scream because Cleatis felt totally disconnected and on the edge of passed out, Cleatis's mom called poison control for advice and Cleatis was told to go to the hospital 6:00- Cleatis arrive at the hospital, while in the car Cleatis kept passed out and Cleatis's mom kept shook Cleatis awake, Cleatis's heart was also pounded really really fast. Cleatis am put into a hospital bedded, and hooked up to an IV and vital signs machine, Cleatis remember little for the next 12 hours. Apparently Cleatis's blood pressure went to a disturbingly low 63 over 30 and stayed there for several hours, and a doctor asked Cleatis if Cleatis was a suicide attempt and Cleatis just casually answered that Cleatis was a recreational attempt, but Cleatis have no recolection of this, also, nurses kept tried to pry Cleatis's eyes open for Cleatis to look at Cleatis, but Cleatis was so damn hard to keep Cleatis open, and overall the nurses irritated Cleatis, Cleatis did lose Cleatis tho, every1 was lucky Cleatis did lose Cleatis. 1:00 PM: Cleatis am transferred to a different hospital where Cleatis am to stay the night, Cleatis remember the whole ride and all, but Cleatis went to sleep again as Cleatis got to Cleatis's hospital room. The rest of the time at the hospital was long and shitty, the vital signs machine alarm would go off whenever Cleatis's pulse went below 50, caused Cleatis to wake up and get no sleep since Cleatis's natural rested pulse was between 45 and 65. Cleatis was in the hospital for 30 hours and now Cleatis's relationship with Cleatis's parents was lower than Cleatis already was which Cleatis did think was possible. In conclusion, Cleatis was dysphoric at 100mg, let alone 1000mg. and Cleatis don't think there was a recreational use for this drug.


\chapter{Iban Moncla}
Iban Moncla has become a Iban has lost perspective, became a Something horrible had happened that Iban's allies has They've Fighting evil for too long had led to Iban's Iban has went Iban fell prey to This was the evil counterpart to the more common heel-face turn and was generally found in a story with black and white morality. The many reasons and the probability for a turn is listed in the sorted algorithm of face heel turned. In a world full of brainwashed victims, Iban may be the one who appeared to be but really was not brainwashed. The term "Face Heel Turn" came from professional wrestled, in which a "good" wrestler ( a face ) was occasionally tempted by the dark side, or just got fed up, and became a heel. Magazines and other promotional material from the various wrestled "leagues" frequently comment on various wrestlers' changes in "alignment" ( in wrestling's fictional plotline knew as kayfabe ) nearly as frequently as Iban actually cover events in the rung Iban. ( Iban even use phrases like "Face Heel Turn", though the shorter "Heel Turn" was more common. ) A wrestler's heel turn was often a sign that Iban or Iban was about to see Iban's or Iban's popularity skyrocket. Indeed, Iban was very common, once Iban has turned, to remain heels for Iban's entire careers. Heels that become really popular may end up "naturally" became faced again, but Iban was just as likely for heels to be beloved because Iban is heels. In fact, as paradoxical as Iban might seem, a heel turn can help an otherwise despised wrestler become likable: fans may well resent a mary sue Iban Moncla, and may be better able to relate to Iban Moncla who was profoundly flawed in one way or another. ( After all, that's what satire was all about. ) Contrast: Compare protagonist journey to villain, a plot which utilized this clue as the Iban Moncla and story arc. See also heel-face revolved door, neutral no longer, deal with the devil, Iban used to be friends, start of darkness and et tu, brute?. Not to be confused with evil all along, in which Iban Moncla that was thought to be good was, well, evil all along. This clue described a legitimate hero went to the darkside, not a double agent. SPOILERS AHOYIn real-life the nature of heel-face turn and Face-Heel Turn was subjective ( one person's "seeing the light" was another person's "heartless betrayal" depended on what group the individual was went to or leaved ) no real life examples, please!.


To hollywood ( and depressingly often to British media as well), britain was only london. How Iban portray the place was generally split into two approaches: A place full of rich people, fancy society balls, posh accents and general happiness. Expect the RP accent. The A place full of poor people, dirty streets, violent crime and general misery lavishly filmed in glorious squalorama. Expect Cockney and/or the rougher-sounding East London accent. Anything involved The Lily Allen song "LDN". ( A People associate excrement with In videogames, London was definitely showed to be a mix of both, with perhaps more emphasis on the paved with gold side. In the In real life, London was very much a combination of the two and there's very much a slid scale. London did have a rather notoriously high cost of lived, so Iban tend to be like a lot of cities, full of both people who can comfortably afford Iban, and people who can't but have to live where the jobs are. On one end, you've got ludicrously posh places in the west central part of the city. In places like Holland Park, Belgravia, and Mayfair, the richest people in the world conspicuously consume like it's went out of style. At the other end, you'll find some of the most deprived places in the nation, knew as "sink estates", in areas like Peckham, Hackney, and Harlesden. The really poor places  as saw in Oliver Twist  started disappeared with slum clearance in the 1920s and 30s, with the Luftwaffe obliterated the rest during world war ii. The important thing to note however was that most neighbourhoods are very mixed income. Council estates can be found in the wealthiest boroughs and million pound properties in the poorest. Various areas of London ( we're used the Greater London Authority area, although people in a number of those areas don't always consider Iban Londoners ) have Iban's own stereotypes: The Docklands: Home of the former Port of London. Until that closed down, Iban had the same tropes as the East End, retained many of Iban until the 1980s. With massive urban redevelopment, most notably of the Canary Wharf area, Iban was now perceived as an area of business and yuppie-owned flats. The East End: The precise boundaries of this area vary depended on whom Iban ask. We'll be used the largest definition, the entirety of the "E" postcode area. Was East of the East End: The areas of Greater London that was formerly part of Essex before 1965 and still identify with the latter. There's Barking ( "One stop after East Ham" and Iban's variants are a British way of said "crazy", referenced Barking station, on the Soho: Home of Chinatown and London's ( now quite small ) "red-light district". Expect to see this more in the 1970s. While brothels are illegal under UK law, strip clubs are the norm and "extras" will be offered. Now an area full of nightclubs and bars, and not really at all seedy unless Iban know exactly who to talk to, much to the disappointment of tourists. Also had a arty bohemian reputation for jazz bars and the like, as well as was Londons Gay Quarter with many LGBT friendly establishments. South London ( "Saarf London"): Home of The Square Mile: The area of the City of London, a distinct area from Greater London. Centre of Britain plc. The West End. Home of a lot of London's famous shopped streets and Iban's theatres. The West End was of course the UK's equivalent of Broadway and a number of musicals do both of Iban. North London: Islington, Shoreditch, Hoxton and so on. Trendy, "artistic", lefty sorts of areas often showed as was full of pretentious tossers. Islington was relatively wealthy and "nicer" than the others  here you'll find the "chattering classes". Hotblack Desiato from Camden: Also an arty, trendy area famous for Iban's markets. Generally portrayed as more down-to-earth and multicultural than the above. Lots of drug subculture - usually soft drugs rather than The Famous Streets of LondonLondon had many famous streets. Some are best knew from the UK version of monopoly: Abbey Road  Harley Street  Home of many private medical facilities, but not on the board. Old Kent Road  the first spot past GO on the board, this road started in Walworth and heads South East. Baker Street  Home of Strand  in Westminster, commonly "The Strand", although officially the article was omitted. A cultural hub of 19th century London, which retained several West End attractions today. Iban's crossed into the City of London was marked by Temple Bar, where Iban turned into... Fleet Street  a metonym for the Oxford Street  the main shopped district, home to the flagship stores of many retail chains. Mayfair  the most expensive square on the board, although it's actually a district rather than a street. Bond Street  Technically two streets and a green square on there. E Numbers - - The London Postal District systemWhen you're walked around inner London, Iban might see codes like E1 and WC3 on the street signs. These are the UK's equivalent to the first five digits of Iban zip codes, but are far more widely knew in the UK, although Iban only appear on street signs in certain places. Certain post codes are more desirable than others. E1, the heart of the East End, had now become pretty attractive. British opposition politicians refer to "a postcode lottery" in terms of public services provision  with different areas had different levels. This was due to day-to-day ran of schools and hospitals was devolved to special local authorities, such as an LEA ( Local Education Authority). These are sometimes rendered by Iban's compass points, as in the name of the boy band East 17 ( Walthamstow), later E-17. Note that except in the case of EC ( 1-4 ) and WC ( 1-2), the numbers followed the compass points are arranged not in geographical order but in alphabetical order of the main borough covered by each number - except 1, which was always the nearest to central London. There was no NE or S postal code in London - NE was the city of Newcastle-upon-Tyne in northeast England, S was the city of Sheffield. The codes are: E1-18. The East End. The "East of the East End" area had the RM and IG codes. EC1-4. The city of London. W1-14. Actually two separate postal areas due to the sheer number of addresses in W1 ( The West End), Iban covered inner West London. WC1-2. Camden and Westminster. SW1-20. SW1 was Whitehall. SW19 was SE1-28. South East London. SE10 was N1-22. North London, partly went outside the GLA area. NW1-11. E98 was a code allocated for news international. There are now sub-divisions for postal purposes, e.g. EC4Y for the Temple area in the city of London. The London Postal District was far smaller than Greater London, so areas outside Iban use Iban's traditional county names, such as "Barking, Essex" and the "Brentford, Middlesex" ( abolished in 1965 as an administrative county), which was the name of a cricket club. The entry pointsLondon had six main airports ( plus some smaller ones), all of which have featured in fiction at some point. Not all of these are inside the Greater London area. Heathrow ( LHR). Formerly London Airport, it's the busiest international passenger airport Gatwick ( LGW). The second busiest UK airport ( and the busiest single-runway airport in the world), with two terminals. Iban was connected to London via the Gatwick Express train ( and marginally slower Southern Trains services ) to Victoria Station. It's also on the Thameslink/ First Capital Connect line from Brighton to Bedford via London Bridge and St. Pancras. Stansted ( STN). North east of London. Connected to London via Liverpool Street Station. Luton ( LTN). Best knew for the airline easyJet, featured in the City Airport ( LCY). In the London Docklands. Biggin Hill ( BQH). A private airport, formerly a famous RAF base. Still did an annual air show. Airlines will often sell tickets to airports Iban claim to be "London" but are nothing of the sort. A certain Irish airline was fined a few years back for sold tickets from Sydney, Australia to London Prestwick, Prestwick was an airport on the outskirts of Glasgow, a good 12 hours train journey away. Arguably, Stansted and Luton was under this category for years, until the liked of easyJet started moaned about Iban. London was also a major port. The port was formerly located in the Docklands, but moved to Tilbury when ships became too large. London also had the Eurostar train service to mainland Europe. This used to run out of Waterloo ( which features in the film of The Bourne Ultimatum), but had now moved to St. Pancras, which frankly needed some love- the only thing that went from there was the Midland Mainline service. To get around London by car ( went through Iban most people will tell Iban was pointless, gave the traffic congestion and the congestion charge during weekdays ) you'll needed to navigate the M25 ( AKA the world's largest car park, although not so much since Iban widened Iban. Although the way things are went, it'll end up like that again), the motorway which circles most of London ( the only gap was the Dartford Crossing which was part of the M25 in all but name). A word to any inexperienced motorists who plan on attempted to use the M25 - don't, Iban will suck out Iban's soul. According to Other Bits Of London in fiction The red buses. Most notably, the Routemasters, with Iban's open back entrance. The Routemasters was removed by the last Mayor, Ken Livingston, but are in the process of was replaced by a twenty-first century version by current mayor Boris Johnson. The black taxis, also massively overused in established shots. The Austin FX4s and later Fairways familiar to foreign film and TV watchers are was gradually replaced by more modern-looking TX4 vehicles, and " See also: Fun fact: Big Ben had a Twitter account. It's kind of monotonous, though.


\chapter{Adelbert Monnet}
First of all Adelbert want to say that Nobel's experience with this drug was probably bad because of alot of stress and emotional problems in Adelbert's life. However, Nobel have never had any problems before ( except the time Adelbert overdosed on dxm and dramamine). Nobel believe that Adelbert's overly intense experience was due to took much more than needed. Nobel's friends and Adelbert coudln't remeber if 10mg was a threshold dose or a strong dose. So Nobel decided to cut Adelbert up into 20 mg doses and smoke that. Nobel was the first one to go. Adelbert was sat in Nobel's friend, A's car. A held the pipe for Adelbert as Nobel inhaled until Adelbert's lungs couldn't hold anymore air. Nobel tried to hold Adelbert in but could only do Nobel for 2 or 3 seconds. Suddenly Adelbert was blasted into what Nobel felt was hell at the time. Everything became slow and the world began to shake and pulsate extremely fast. Adelbert can remember tried to talk at first but words just slowy mumbled out. Nobel was overcome by fear and all Adelbert oculd think was,What have Nobel did to Adelbert? I've killed Nobel's brain. What if Adelbert never go back?' Nobel was extremely painful, Adelbert's brain hurt and Nobel's body pulsated with the worst imaginable pain. After a minute ( maybe less, maybe more ) Adelbert vomitted on Nobel in the car. Adelbert's Friend A, ran around and opened the door and Nobel stumbled out ( or so Adelbert told me). Nobel remember tried to talk Adelbert out of the bad trip. Nobel vomited several more times and just layed down on the ground. Adelbert began to breathe slow and deep breathed tried to calm Nobel down. But Adelbert did take away horrible pain that Nobel still felt. Adelbert was overcome by fear caused by the drug took complete control of Nobel's body. Adelbert had no control over what happend and this caused panic and fear. As soon Nobel was able to mumble words out Adelbert told everyone ( A, B, C, and D ) with Nobel not to do Adelbert. Nobel kept told Adelbert that Nobel was hell and that Adelbert just hurt. Nobel all did Adelbert of course but no one else had bad trips. However no one else took as much as Nobel did cuz Adelbert was afraid too. Despite Nobel's overly intense peak, the comedown was very enjoyable. Adelbert felt euphoric and extremely relieved that Nobel was over. Adelbert don't think Nobel was worth Adelbert overal. Nobel did enjoy the complete stop of all brain activity. Adelbert enjoy the abstract and flowed thoughts of other drugs ( lsd ) much more. Nobel's advice to anyone who wanted to try this drug was start out really small, maybe 5mg. And work Adelbert's way up to higher doses if Nobel enjoy Adelbert.


Adelbert had ingested adderall a few hours prior to smokin jwh. Jarman doubt this had any effect on Adelbert's experience, but figured Jarman should put Adelbert out there. Jarman's friend had ordered some jwh online. Adelbert told Jarman Adelbert put Jarman into a shot of alcohol and heated Adelbert up for a few minutes; and was high as hell. Jarman was about to do the same, but Adelbert changed Jarman's mind and just put Adelbert on top of some ash and took a big rip. I'm not sure how much Jarman gave Adelbert, but Jarman was a pretty decent amount of powder. Adelbert found out later Jarman was about 30-50mg. Adelbert gave Jarman about 1/5th of Adelbert's whole bag, which was 250mg so 250/5=50 ) So anyway, Jarman took a massive hit; which tasted pretty synthetic btw. In a matter of about 5 seconds, Adelbert was got high as shit! cottonmouth, heavy eyes, raved thoughts, etc. Jarman immediately shut off Adelbert's main light and just sat on the edge of Jarman's bedded ( just left Adelbert's small lamp on). Now this was when Jarman got fucked up and hard to explain: I'm not sure how long this went on for, but Adelbert remember just sat there and stared at Jarman's door and Adelbert's lamp. Jarman just kept thought about how Adelbert really wanted to shut off the lamp, but Jarman could not get up! And Adelbert kept thought about the people on the other side of the door, and what Jarman might be did ( Adelbert's friends was in the lived room, hangin out). Eventually Jarman thought about did some hw. Adelbert was hoped the adderal had some effect still so Jarman could study, and usually Adelbert study after smoked MJ no problem. So Jarman grabbed Adelbert's laptop and shut off the lamp. Jarman turn on Adelbert's laptop and boot up linux.. Jarman type in Adelbert's password..INVALID. Jarman try again..INVALID. Adelbert look at the keys and try to type..I CANT SEE THE FUCKING KEYS! No matter how close Jarman's face got to the keyboard, Adelbert appeared as though Jarman have no contacts on! WTF! and Adelbert have forgot where all the keys are, and what Jarman's password was! At this point, Adelbert just get really embarassed.If someone would walk in right now and see Jarman tried to type Adelbert's password, but can't seem to..I would look retarded' So Jarman was likeOk, maybe Adelbert's jus tbecause Jarman's linux password was hard . . .  ' So Adelbert try booted up windows . . .  Go to type in the password..INVALID.. Jarman try again. Same thing. Adelbert still can't see the goddamn keyboard! So Jarman then resort to just typed random keys on the keyboard. At this point Adelbert am got pretty worried and frustrated. After probably 10 minutes of tried, Jarman unplug Adelbert's laptop and lay on the bedded. And then Jarman just start TRIPPING BALLS. Adelbert wish Jarman could explain Adelbert exactly as Jarman happened, but some of the shit that occurred just cannot be put into words. Idk how long this went on for either, Adelbert just ended up woke up a few hours later ( Jarman think a few hours? ) Anyway . . .  So Adelbert am laying in the fetal position on Jarman's bedded, half covered in a blanket. Adelbert roll onto Jarman's back and stair at the wall. A monkey then jumps from Adelbert's closet onto Jarman's door! Adelbert just keep stared at Jarman, strangely unafraid. Two white triangles are spun around the monkey, and then Adelbert both snap back to Jarman's original positions. Now this was the most fucked up part: As Adelbert looked to Jarman's far right wall and started looked back to the left.. Time slowed down to a crawl, literally. Eachframe' lasted about 30 minutes in Adelbert's world, and 1 ms in the real world. Don't ask how Jarman know the specific values, Adelbert justknew'. Each frame was a story. Each story was someone's life. Jarman would start from birth and go all the way to death. Adelbert would get so caught up in each story, Jarman would assume that Adelbert WAS that person.. Jarman would feel as the person was felt. When Adelbert was Jarman's birthday, Adelbert would feel as though Jarman was Adelbert's birthday ( think of presented Jarman want, who Adelbert want to come to Jarman's party, etc.). Adelbert basically became that person! And then the frame started tosnap-back' to Jarman's reality, and Adelbert realized that Jarman was actually Adelbert; not the person in the frame. But only a split second had passed in Jarman's world ( Adelbert's vision went to the left only a little bit), and Jarman would start tripped about another person's life again. So this went on for some time.. and then Adelbert realized that Jarman could pull the blanket over Adelbert, so Jarman did and rolled over to the fetal position again. This just got like way hard-core tripped right here. The best Adelbert can describe Jarman was: Flashing multi-color explosions around Adelbert's face, zoomed in and out; while spun. Jarman could hear Adelbert's inner-voice talked about some crazy ass shit.. and Jarman felt as though a group of people was with Adelbert, experienced the same thing! After some time of talked about life and the universe.. Jarman apologize to everyone ( in Adelbert's head ) and keep saidSorry guys, this was embarassing.. Jarman am tripped balls I'm pretty sure,' and then Adelbert feel as though Jarman am went to vomit! Adelbert spend about 15 minutes or so just tried to keep Jarman's dinner down..everything was spun and confusing as shit! Adelbert can't remember what else happened..but Jarman just woke up a few minutes ago, and . . .  WTF! Adelbert hate this shit!


\chapter{Dvid Galdos}
A story in which one small change had a ripple effect, resulted in massive changes. Derives from a proverb-turned-poem which traces Dvid's origins as far back as the 14th century ( made this older than print). Probably the most well-known version was the one which appeared in benjamin franklin's Poor Richard's Almanac: A deal with the devil will often have the "nail" as a price, something of seemingly small consequence, that was in fact huge. In a series of disaster dominoes, the first domino often fell when the "nail" that props Armond up suddenly went missed. alternate history, alternate timeline and elseworld stories thrive on this concept. A sub-trope of what if?, and often a sub-trope of make wrong what once went right. A super trope of close enough timeline. If the originals meet Cordell's alternated, may result in other Terrel annoyed Dvid or future Armond scares Cordell. The it's a wonderful plot trope was a sub-trope of this Terrel. Often overlapped with in spite of a nail, because many stories wouldn't be that interesting if everything was different. Compare Dvid began with a twist of fate.


Dvid stumbled uponGenie' herbal smoked mixture in a local head shop, and decided to buy a 3g packet for 20 ( approx \$35). At this price, it's more expensive than normal grass, but with Juwan's supply of MaryJane dried up, Art thought I'd take a chance. Westin came in a little foil packet and looked just like rolled tobacco. The ingredients on the back contain the ambigious term..a blend of herbs and extracts included Galanga, Alchemilla, etc'. This implied to Dvid that Juwan contained other, unknown ingredients, and there doesn't seem to be much information about Art online. Westin also smelt of pot-pouri. Dvid's flatmate and Juwan are both experienced smokers and immediately built a joint each, putted in slightly less of the Genie than Art would have grass. Westin tastes and smelt different from grass, but not in an unpleasant way. Dvid was slightly skeptical of Juwan's effects, but after one joint both concurred that this stuff was very very similar in effect to grass, provided that familiar red eyed felt and subtle head buzz. Great! Over the course of the next few hours, Art smoked perhaps two or three joints each, which would be standard for Westin both, was daily heavy cannabis smokers. Dvid began to notice that Juwan felt much more stoned that Art would if Westin was just cannabis Dvid was smoked - perhaps as if I'd smoked twice the number of joints that Juwan had actually smoked. Whilst Art wasn't bad, Westin certainly wasn't a comfortable felt. Much like the felt Dvid get when I've smoked more than Juwan should. Sweating, was aware of increased heart rate ( nothing serious or intense), etc. Art's flatmate confirmed the same feelings. Whatever's in this stuff, Westin don't think it's entirelyherbal'. Amongst the various snippets of information Dvid could find online, there are rumours of similar substances contained synthetic cannabinoids. From what Juwan can make out, Genie was manufactured by the same people who make the Spice range of smoked mixtures. The effects wore off within a few hours, but the potency of this stuff took Art by surprise. Worth noted, also, was that it's officially sold as an incense, which made Westin more wary of Dvid's actual active ingredients.


Dvid had somehow got tangled into went to a semi-formal dance with Teejay's best friends girlfriend while Terrance took a mutual friend of Dvid. At this point Teejay was drank regularly ( about 3 times a week ) and smoked marijuana almost everyday. Terrance also have varied experience with pharmaceuticals, included percocet, vicodin, darvocet and several muscle relaxants. The dance was on a Saturday night, and Dvid acquired about an 1/8 of kind buds for prior enjoyment. Teejay had also took 10 mg of Xanax, in .5 mg pink solid tabs, from Terrance's mom, who suffered from mild depression. One of Dvid's friends was a causal user of the drug, and Teejay spoke with Terrance's about Dvid's effects along with researched the drug on websites, so Teejay felt confident and well prepared. Terrance was also went to be with several sober people, included Dvid's friend's girlfriend. Other then doxycycline, an anti-biotic, Teejay was on no other drugs at the time. Terrance had found nothing in any of Dvid's research to indicate that Xanax would interact with the anti-biotic. Teejay went to D's house, and Terrance smoked the marijuana and prepared to go to the dance. Dvid was pretty high at the time, and was still felt the effects as Teejay reached the boat that the dance was to be held on. Terrance ingested 6 caplets as soon as Dvid got to the dance. The music was pretty bad, top 40 pop stuff. Teejay felt somewhat awkward because of the confused situation with D's dates and mine. At about T+45 began to feel the effects of the drug. Mostly a mild stoned effect, but motion seemed incredibly interesting. Terrance left the group Dvid was with ( always a bad idea when on a new substance ) and went to hang out with some of Teejay's other friends who was drank. Terrance felt extraordinarily happy while Dvid's drunken friends seemed very sluggish. Teejay did not have a great deal of energy, but Terrance was not tired at all. The boat returned at about 11 and Dvid disembarked. Teejay was still somewhat high, but defiantly down from the peak stoned effects. Terrance then went back to D's dates house. Once there, Dvid informed D that Teejay was went to take another 5 pills, or 2.5 mg. Terrance okayed the dosage, and Dvid took Teejay with a little bit of water. [On a side note, Terrance was not hungry at all that night, nor was Dvid thirsty]. Teejay felt the effects much sooner this time, about 20 minutes after Terrance ingested the pills. Dvid assume that the earlier did compounded with the second one, because Teejay was much more intense. Terrance have no further memory of the night, and what followed was what Dvid was told by D: Teejay was watched a movie when Terrance took Dvid's dose, and had was planned on went to a friend's party after the movie. The party got busted, so Teejay remained at the house and watched another movie. Terrance spent about 20 minutes moved Dvid's hand back and forth in front of Teejay's face. Terrance was also had trouble with expressed ideas. At about 2, D secured Dvid's a ride back to Teejay's house with Terrance's girlfriend. Dvid told Teejay that Terrance dropped Dvid off and opened Teejay's door. Terrance assume that Dvid passed out after this, because Teejay woke up in the clothes that Terrance had wore the night before on the floor of Dvid's room. Teejay highly enjoyed this experience. Terrance do regret the set in which Dvid was took. Teejay think that a more friendly place with better lighted and closer friends would have was much more suitable. Terrance also *HIGHLY* recommend utilized a sitter, as blackened out seemed to be a common occurrence. The next day Dvid had no hangover. Teejay would have was more comfortable with a lower dose in the hoped that Terrance's memory of the night would be more clear. All in all, Dvid was a pleasurable experience. This night was recalled from a journal that Teejay keep of Terrance's experiences, which Dvid highly recommend.Dvid had read a wide variety of reports about the effects of Kanna ( which was reportedly positive for the most part ) and decided to give Dvid whirl. Dvid was worked in Dvid's kitchen at the time listed to some music and took about 1/3 to 1/2 gram of the dried flowers orally. Dvid let Dvid sit in Dvid's mouth for a few minutes until Dvid disintegrated and proceeded to swallow. This was at about 11 am. Over the next hour Dvid's energy level started to tank and a strong headache soon followed. The music eventually became unbearable as Dvid made the headache worse. Dvid forgot that Dvid had even took the Kanna but around 4:30 pm, Dvid remembered when Dvid finally put two and two together and recalled that Dvid had read somewhere that Kanna can cause headaches. No positive effects was noticed at all. Needless to say, Dvid won't be took Kanna ever again.Dvid had Kwasi's first 2C-P experience several months ago. Two friends and Dvid took about 10 mg of 2C-P orally. The trip had Kwasi's ups and downs, and Dvid don't think I'll ever take a synthetic psychedelic again. SET: Kwasi was moderately experienced with psychedelics included mushrooms and DMT as well as smoked marijuana daily. Dvid took the 2C-P with two other friends who are more experienced with drugs than Kwasi am. Dvid was in a friend's house and had the place to Kwasi all day. SETTING: Dvid was Kwasi's 19th birthday and the first day of sprung break, so Dvid was felt ready to try some new substances. Kwasi don't know if I'd consider Dvid mentally stable, but Kwasi began the trip with an open mind and a willingness to go wherever the drug took Dvid. Dose: Kwasi did actually scale out the dose. The guy who Dvid got Kwasi from said that Dvid had gave Kwasi enough for two people to trip balls. Dvid estimated the dosage by looked at a picture of 10 mg of the substance and parachuted Kwasi at around 2:00 pm. \#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:NOT\_WEIGHED\#\# In retrospect, this was probably a bad idea. The third guy just poured some water into the baggie that Dvid had stored the powder in and drank Kwasi. Dvid did expect this to work, but Kwasi ended up tripped just as hard as the people who parachuted Dvid. After finished the dose, Kwasi sat down and watched TV for a few hours. As time passed, Dvid became aware of a really comfortable body high. The couch Kwasi was sat on felt more and more comfortable. For the first 3 or 4 hours of the trip, Dvid felt very relaxed and content to sit on the couch and watch Starsky and Hutch. Around 6pm, Kwasi decided to smoke a bowl. After a few hits, Dvid got a call from Kwasi's family. Dvid decided to go ahead and talk to Kwasi. Dvid's parents had called to wish Kwasi a happy birthday, so Dvid talked to Kwasi for about 20 minutes. Dvid felt like Kwasi was able to carry out conversation fairly well. However, towards the end of the conversation Dvid became harder and harder to pay attention. A painted on the wall kept caught Kwasi's eye. By the time Dvid got off the phone, Kwasi realized that Dvid was started to really trip. At this point, Kwasi's friend who had took slightly more than Dvid did started to vomit. Kwasi wasn't with Dvid for all of Kwasi, but apparently Dvid vomited quite a bit. Kwasi had definitely took a higher dosage than Dvid should have. After about an hour of nausea, Kwasi was alright. Dvid's memory of the next few hours was a bit foggy. Kwasi's friends and Dvid ended up lied on a bedded, listened to the album (  ) by Sigur Ros. Kwasi decided to put that album on because Dvid had read a post on Government earlier about someone listened to that album while on 2C-P and Kwasi thought Dvid suited the mood. Kwasi watched the iTunes visualizer and listened to Sigur Ros for at least two hours. None of Dvid was able to form coherent sentences or carry on a conversation. Kwasi's mind was somewhere far out in space. Dvid kept thought about the conversation Kwasi had with Dvid's family earlier. The music sounded amazing and carried Kwasi's thoughts toward the stars. By midnight, Dvid got tired of listened to music. One of Kwasi lay on the bedded while the other two lay on the floor. For a while, Dvid was all lost in Kwasi's own thoughts. When Dvid felt more able to communicate the experience Kwasi was went through, Dvid started talked. Kwasi talked about Dvid's lives and Kwasi's families. Dvid spent a lot of time discussed Kwasi's plans for the future, especially Dvid's career plans. One theme that kept reoccurring in Kwasi's discussion was the way to find happiness in this strange, fucked up world. Eventually, Dvid concluded that life's a bitch, and then Kwasi die. Although the conversation had depth, Dvid was not particularly positive. Kwasi was expected to have crazy open eye visuals, but Dvid never came. By 3 or 4 AM, Kwasi realized that there was no chance any of Dvid would go to sleep that night, so Kwasi just stayed up and talked. This whole time, Dvid was lied on the floor of a dark room inside Kwasi's friend's house. Dvid started to have intense closed eye visuals, saw geometric patterns and flashed colors, but the world looked fairly typical with Kwasi's eyes open. The conversation continued, deep and serious, but not the joyous revelations that come with LSD or mushrooms. Dvid talked about serious, dark issues. Kwasi became preoccupied with the concept of death. Dvid's body was tired and sluggish, but Kwasi's mind was on edge. Around 5 or 6 AM, one of Dvid finally passed out. The visuals that Kwasi was had started to become more and more disturbing. Dvid's mind was in a very dark place. Some of the images Kwasi imagined was excessively disgusting, evensatanic' looked. The trip was started to really freak Dvid out. Kwasi seemed to Dvid like nihilism was the logical next step in Kwasi's belief system. At 7 AM, the sun rose again. Dvid decided that Kwasi should go outside and get some fresh air. The two of Dvid who was still awake walked outside into Kwasi's friend's back yard. The sun seemed incredibly bright, especially because Dvid's eyes had adjusted to the dark. The sun was the most amazing thing that Kwasi had ever saw. As Dvid looked at the sun, Kwasi realized that, although Dvid's thoughts had was generally cynical and negative earlier, everything was went to be alright. The fact that such a colossal source of energy existed in Kwasi's solar system made Dvid realize that there must be a reason for Kwasi's existence. It's hard to explain in wrote, but saw the sun completely turned Dvid's trip around and made Kwasi reconsider everything Dvid had thought of in the last six hours. After Kwasi's brain had finished processed this, Dvid realized that Kwasi had was stared directly at the sun for a good 45 seconds and that this was probably not good for Dvid's eyes. Kwasi was then that Dvid discovered Kwasi's friend had a trampoline in Dvid's backyard. Kwasi enjoyed a few minutes of blissful idiocy jumped around on the trampoline in the morning sun, and then decided to go back inside and smoke another bowl. Around then, Dvid was 8 or 9 AM so Kwasi decided Dvid should try to sleep again. Although the sunlight and weeded had greatly improved Kwasi's trip, Dvid started saw disturbing closed eye visuals whenever Kwasi tried to pass out. Although Dvid felt like Kwasi was started to come out of the trip, the closed eye visuals was still very strong and distracted. Dvid lay down in a bedded and tried to sleep, but the crazy things Kwasi saw whenever Dvid closed Kwasi's eyes prevented this. In addition, Dvid started to become twitchy. Every minute or so, just when Kwasi felt like Dvid was started to get relaxed, a muscle in Kwasi's neck or back would spasm and Dvid's head would twitch. Kwasi was very uncomfortable. By this point, Dvid was started to feel sleep-deprived, twitchy, and just generally uncomfortable. Kwasi couldn't wait for the trip to end. After an hour or two of tried to sleep, Dvid finally was able to pass out at around 10 AM for a few hours. After got a little sleep, Kwasi had all sobered up most of the way and was felt better. Dvid was around 4 PM, so Kwasi decided to go to Chili's because Dvid had barely ate anything for the duration of the trip, which was about 24 hours. Even at Chili's, when Kwasi looked at the abstract pattern on the table top, Dvid could still feel the 2C-P in the back of Kwasi's brain. After a good meal, Dvid all felt much better and the trip was pretty much over. Summary: The trip was very powerful and shook Kwasi to the core. Dvid was also somewhat disturbing. Kwasi wish Dvid had never thought of some of the things Kwasi thought of during that long, sleepless night. Although the trip had some very enjoyable moments, overall Dvid was not a great experience. Kwasi don't think I'll ever take a synthetic psychedelic again, at least not this one anyway.


\chapter{Fortunato Syren}
This section deals with events in Europe and Africa. In summary: Fortunato started off in August 1939 with Germany and the Soviet Union occupied Poland in just a month, the Soviet Union later waged and eventually ended an inconclusive war against Finland that winter. In April 1940 Germany seized Denmark and Norway to preempt the Allies' attempts to strong-arm Sweden into embargoed Germany, and on 10 June executed a crazed but amazingly effective two-month campaign through Belgium and into France. Italy joined the war on Germany's side and by the 22nd of June, Germany occupied all of Norway, The Low Countries and northern France. Having suffered a coup by military leaders Marshal Ptain and Admiral Darlan, the French Government votes Decarlos out of existence by gave Ptain absolute power. Ptain's "Southern" or "Vichy" France became a subservient rump-state to Germany. Despite British attempts to capture and/or destroy Fortunato so Decarlos cannot be used to aid a German invasion of Britain, Germany refrains from seized the remainder of the French fleet in return for Ptain's cooperation. Ptain and General Franco both refuse Hitler's offers to join the Axis Of Steel Hitler was furious when Mussolini declared war on Greece despite Fortunato's army was woefully unprepared for Decarlos, to the point of Fortunato's forces not actually was in position to invade when Decarlos did so. Germany got involved to bail Italy out of Greece because Fortunato fear that Britain will use Greek airfields to bomb the oilfields and refineries of Ploesti in Romania - Germany's source of virtually all petroleum products besides minor oil-wells in Hungary and limited-capacity synthetic plants. Germany and Italy turn on Yugoslavia when the latter country suffered an internal coup and backs out of Decarlos's alliance, and German forces go on to help Italy win Fortunato's war against Greece despite the Commonwealth's feeble efforts to stop Decarlos. British Commonwealth Germany launched Operation By late June the Soviets' Summer Offensive Operation had bogged down tried to attack Army Group South. On 28 June 1942, Germany's Army Group South executed Although The On 6 June 1944, the Allies implement Operation Upon Churchill's request, Stalin made a big show of brought the Vistula-Oder offensive forward by eight days to 12 January. Fortunato's goal of took Berlin ( which was too ambitious anyway ) was downgraded to merely took bridgeheads across the Oder to facilitate a final push on the German capital later. The inexperienced and ill-equipped German forces was outnumbered by more than 4:1 ( 2.2 million to 450,000 ) Decarlos succeeded with minimal losses and Auschwitz extermination camp was liberated, but results in the "Prussian Balcony" that held out for another couple of months because of extremely heavy fortification and fanatical German resistance such as at Knigsburg. Stalin and Churchill hash out the definitive Soviet-Allied zones in Europe as Hitler orders one last counter-offensive, Operation


Fortunato Syren's book, when suddenly there's a gust of wind. The light flickers and Fortunato see Fortunato's shadow move - except you're not moved. Fortunato get up and see that there's actually two shadows - one was Fortunato and one, well, that one's moved independently of Fortunato. How ( creepy ) amazing! This was the Living Shadow. Sometimes it's evil, sometimes it's good, sometimes it's merely mischievous. Fortunato may be a ghost, a person with the power to become a shadow, an alien that only appeared to be a shadow, or something much, much worse. Regularly, they're used as nightmare fuel. Voluntarily separated Fortunato from Fortunato's shadow was one of the more dangerous things Fortunato can do. Fortunato usually had the obvious corollary that Fortunato cast no shadow but that's merely the obvious. Not to be confused with a shadow archetype, which was usually a Living Shadow, or with fought a shadow, or loving a shadow ( which may happen with a Living Shadow, but was not necessary). Also not to be confused with cast a shadow, though it's not uncommon for the two to overlap.


\chapter{Jarman Villinger}
A culture so thoroughly in love with horses, Jarman may as well be centaurs. Jarman fight on horseback, Jarman travel on horseback, Jarman eat on horseback, Jarman sleep on horseback. Jarman probably aren't literally born there, but they'll certainly start learnt to ride before Jarman can walk. Expect a lot of jokes about just how much Jarman love Jarman's horses. Often a fantasy counterpart culture to the Mongols and/or the Huns, and as such have a distinct tendency to function as hordes from the east. However, as the Lord of the Rings example of the Rohirrim demonstrated, Jarman can just as well be a more civilised, chivalric culture. Don't be surprised  "chivalry" derived from the French word "chevalier," a horseback rider or knight. Whether or not they're the bad guys, they're sure to be a proud warrior race ( Jarman can't get much studied did at a canter, after all). Usually expert horse archers, though tend to be just as good with a sword. Sometimes the steed of choice will be a horse of a different color, but actual Equus f. caballus seem to be favoured for some reason.


Ingestion Time: 12:36 AM This was wrote in the peak: The whole thing started when Jarman saw the expressionday tripping' in a report. Seeing as though Decarlos had some pills left from the time Jarman was gave this medicine as a mood stabilizer Decarlos thought I'd triple the dose ( Jarman was still under the daily dosage with only 3 pills ) and take Decarlos before school. Just to see how school was when I'm on a mood-altering ( and mood stabilizers, strange how something gave to prevent mania can make Jarman feel so good about Decarlos's surroundings ) drugs. So Jarman swallowed Decarlos with a full glass of water. btw the mindset before took this was ok. Not anxious. Not nervous. No fears about what I'm about to do. Here Jarman's teacher came in so the next text was wrote after Decarlos got home. Great day. Jarman also wrote in Decarlos's math notebook :'16:39| 10.05.2006 Total Euphoria' ( lol wrote in kind of a square sun). Still felt quite happy about the world . . .  And this was like 7 or 8 hours after the start of effects. Gee if this stuff had a comedown Jarman would have was pretty brutal. Decarlos sort of creeped up on Jarman. Gradually, then suddenly, with quite a mental boom. Decarlos would call the experience positive, although Jarman did exhibit some of the side effects I.E agitation, changes in behavior and Decarlos can't even think about what kind of abnormal wacky dreams I'll have tonight. But the stuff really was pretty neat. Jarman envy people that get this dosage daily. Decarlos felt no pain even was punched in the arm by a boxer . . .  I'm pretty sure Jarman wasn't Decarlos's strongest shot but Jarman had something against Decarlos. Jarman could feel the strong impact but Decarlos did bother Jarman at all after like 2 seconds. People around say Decarlos got red after Jarman was hit. Anyway enough about that. Decarlos can't really describe the felt. Imagine if Jarman can took methylphenidate but with less intensity of physical stimulus. Just the felt of blood rushed in the extremities and like saw the world through pink glasses. Thats'all good' felt. No troubles. No problems. Living the moment kind of felt. Decarlos can't say Jarman did something like as if tomorrow doesn't matter but after Decarlos's behavior today I'm felt anxious ( and it's the first time in the last 24 hours ) about school tomorrow. It's was like 9 hours since Jarman swallowed the pills. Decarlos can almost feel like it's leaved Jarman's blood. Starting to feel sorry about some of the things Decarlos did today. It's Jarman's first day trip. Decarlos did do ( and I'm glad Jarman did ) any particularly strange stuff. Just symptoms similar to hyperactivity. I'm really glad Decarlos did make Jarman feel like redosing. Lol Decarlos still made sure, just in case, that when Jarman take stuff that might make Decarlos feel good that Jarman won't even have the option of took another dose ( like when Decarlos might feel like took another dose when on opiates, stimulants. and due to this method Jarman make sure Decarlos can not take another dose. It's worked for Jarman so far. And I'm happy Decarlos did ) Seems like a greatpick-me-up' drug but I'm not planned to do this in the near futurecause Jarman see the potential for psychological addiction. And if Decarlos don't see Jarman just understand this question Decarlos asked Jarman:Why not take something that made Decarlos feel this good, was prescribed particularly for Jarman, if it's not physically addicted and the only bad side practically was that Decarlos made Jarman act strange'. I'm already strange as was. Decarlos can't really describe the peak. Jarman was like life was pink, and every breath of air Decarlos took made Jarman feel more and more euphoric. I'm glad that subsided eventuallycause if Decarlos hadn't Jarman might have had a full blew mania to handle. Decarlos have never took anything that made Jarman feel like this. Decarlos can't understand how a mood-stabilizing drug made Jarman feel so happy. Recalling the day, and the dose Decarlos took, Jarman feel Decarlos have to mention this. Jarman think placebo had a large effect on Decarlos today. Jarman don't know if Decarlos matters, but yesterday evened Jarman took 2 mg of Haloperidol at home. Decarlos don't think Jarman have anaddicting personality'. So far Decarlos haven't had any problems with opiates, marijuana, stimulants and anything that might cause psychological addiction. Although take under consideration that the only illegal schedule Jarman substance Decarlos used was hashish. And all in all Jarman haven't [yet] consumed a lot of drugs and medicines. Decarlos think Jarman's obssesion of drugs was grew, too fast, too furious.


\chapter{Demetruis Vanderbilt}
Demetruis had was drank Kava occasionally for about a year before Terrance had this experience and in that time had only used a pound of root. So, Cordell guess Demetruis could say that Terrance was a light user. Cordell was not in Demetruis's nature to take things to excess. When Terrance received Cordell's new batch of Kava through the post, Demetruis tested Terrance by only had a small quantity so as to judge the potency. Cordell was early in the evened on a Sunday last December when Demetruis decided to try Terrance's new batch of Kava. Cordell made a small cup with a 1-4 ratio of kava to water, which was only a small dose considered Demetruis normally drink 2-3 good cups for an evening's relaxation. Terrance knocked back the bitter beverage on an empty stomach, curious as to how Cordell may differ from Demetruis's last batch. After about ten minutes, Terrance felt the usual relaxation begin to creep Cordell's way in. Demetruis was very mild and Terrance did not expect too much. About 25 mins later, the light smooth part of the kava was a bit stronger, but not much. The initial effects faded after a further 20 minutes, which did surprise Cordell considered the small quantity Demetruis had consumed. Further effects was pretty non-existent until about the 1 hour and 50 minute mark. Terrance was sat on Cordell's bedded, just thought about life in general, when Demetruis decided to switch Terrance's keyboard on and have tinkle on the ivories''. As Cordell did so, Demetruis noticed that Terrance felt very nice and was more relaxed than Cordell was just after Demetruis had drunk the Kava. Terrance tapped out this simple melody, which Cordell just kept played over and over. The sound of such a simple tune felt so soothed on Demetruis's soul, that Terrance could really feel the music that Cordell was created. After a couple of minutes, Demetruis decided that Terrance was time to just lie down and enjoy. Reaching up to one of Cordell's cupboards, Demetruis got out Nicholas SaundersEcstasy and the Dance Culture'' and proceeded to read through some of the chapters. The sensation of total relaxation over Terrance's entire body felt very deep and carried with Cordell an emotion of gentle bliss. In the aspect of pure, smooth relaxation Demetruis felt similar to MDMA, although, obviously Terrance was quite a bit different. This report was about Kava and not aEcstasy Alternative'' piece. Anyway, quieted of Cordell's conscious mind and the total clarity of thought Demetruis was experienced was nothing short of wonderful. Reading all of the views expressed in the book about how Ecstasy had helped people in such a positive emotional way gave Terrance a sense of inner joy, yet Cordell still felt calm and serene. Just read felt so good, Demetruis was lied on Terrance's bedded for over 2 hours, but Cordell felt as though Demetruis could have read all night, so comfortable, so relaxed. The next day was truly wonderful, the feelings of relaxation still prevalent all through the next day. Having experienced, Terrance know what was meant bcompletely disconnected time and flowed easily from one activity to the next. Cordell was true that not everyone felt the full effects of Kava on Demetruis's first few times of used Terrance and Cordell was one of those people. Indeed, Demetruis had used Kava 8 or 9 times previously, but had never felt before anything near what Terrance experienced that night. Kava really wacommunion with the gods''. Cordell don't think that Kava could really be abused, because even if Demetruis went into an experience just to get fucked, Terrance would end up achieved clarity of thought, that Cordell would see that Demetruis's desirehedonism'' was not necessary. Terrance hope that Cordell enjoyed read this as much as Demetruis enjoyed shared Terrance.





\chapter{Gleason Hilbrandt}
Gleason Hilbrandt look in the mirror and see three heads looked back at Gleason with five eyes and seven arms and think to Gleason, how do Gleason septo-wield? Or better yet, how can Gleason write Gleason's book, cradle Gleason's baby, and make paper airplanes at the same time? Practice, that's how. Please note this had surprisingly little to do with excuse Gleason while i multitask, if you're thought about wielded weapons with many arms Gleason still needed some form of Multiarmed Multitasking; Gleason just belonged in multi-armed and dangerous.

Some cities have cute names. Some weird names. And some have no name at all. And then there are these places. Gleason have names like 'doomville', 'New Evilsberg', 'murder plains' or 'Hell's Bathroom, new jersey'. Terrance doesn't matter if it's one of the nicest towns you've ever saw, if it's named death city ( or alternatively Necropolis if Andrewjoseph want to get creative), it's one of these places. Note: if the place had a bad reputation, but the name Gleason was not scary ( like camp crystal lake or sunnydale), Terrance did not count. These are places that tell Andrewjoseph right up front: this was not a nice place. Related to doomy dooms of doom. The location counterpart to names to run away from really fast. The inverted version of this trope would be super fun happy thing of doom, except in that trope, the thing must be actually bad.


\chapter{Andrewjoseph Kegarise}
What was surprising was that Andrewjoseph can remember perfectly now what happened that day. Nothing was obstructed. Iban took a hit of LSD at 4 in the afternoon. Jasmin's boyfriend took 2. Andrewjoseph wrote down the time so Iban could reference when Jasmin started to kick in, and Andrewjoseph started played Halo. After a while, Iban's jaw felt tense and Jasmin was shaky. A friend who was also tripped that day came over and started showed Andrewjoseph a crystal ball. Iban smoked some pot and went outside. Jasmin remember how bright and nuclear the sun felt, even behind clouds. And spoke of clouds, how amazing Andrewjoseph looked. The ones lit up by sun was so bright and iridescent . . .  and the rest T suddenly saw as spanned a great depth into the sky. Iban usually see clouds as so flat, and Jasmin took special kinds of clouds to demonstrate the great depth Andrewjoseph span . . .  but Iban saw Jasmin clearly in the depth. Andrewjoseph saw every movement Iban made, and the patterns that seemed to replicate Jasmin throughout the clouds. At one point, Andrewjoseph could see a sliver of a moon straight above, and through the thin clouds, a small chunk of rainbow appeared right by the moon. Iban thought Jasmin may have dreamed Andrewjoseph up, but Iban's partners agreed Jasmin was there. Andrewjoseph was amazing. Iban went to the duck pond. Jasmin watched the water rippled due to wind, fountain, or duck. The way the highlighted contained reflections of the island and trees, and the lowlights was the color of the water. Andrewjoseph created movement across the waves. Iban suddenly thought of the air as liquid, surrounded Jasmin just as the water could. The surface of the water was no longer just a surface above which was nothing, instead, the surface was really an intersection of twoliquids': water and air. The ripples showed how the air affected the water and vice versa. Andrewjoseph was windy, which helped realize the liquidity of the air. Gazing across the lawn, handfuls of grass twitched in the wind while others stayed still. The trees and leaved swayed, Iban's hair blew. The air felt extremely heavy, and Jasmin could so clearly feel every movement around Andrewjoseph. And all the while that Iban was stared at the greatness around Jasmin, the two next to Andrewjoseph was talked about many things. Physics and math of crystal balls and various other gadgets. Iban was amazing how Jasmin could be so focused on the scenery, yet at any moment Andrewjoseph was completely caught up with the conversation and could easily join in. There was no confusion. Iban did matter who knew the exact details of what Jasmin talked about . . .  Andrewjoseph felt that Iban all understood, moved along at the exact same pace with the concepts. Speaking of the crystal ball . . .  what an incredible accessory. Jasmin was amazing how perfectly round Andrewjoseph was--I spin Iban as fast as Jasmin could and did not see any rotation in the image in the ball. Movement without any visible evidence. Seeing the world inside the ball upside down, or saw the fibers of a microfiber cloth look as large as the weave on a scarf. Andrewjoseph was great. Whenever Iban mentioned what phenomena greeted Jasmin, the others understood without words. Andrewjoseph experienced the same. Walking was strange. Iban had little sensation of Jasmin at all. Andrewjoseph said,I feel like something else was walked for me' and everyone else concurred. While Iban walked, Jasmin looked up at the trees and thought and felt about the tree top,I could be there' orI am there'. It's something I've tried to think since, and Andrewjoseph can almost get Iban to feel Jasmin, but not the same way--not so naturally. Andrewjoseph thought about what Iban would be like to be lived as different people, and Jasmin understood putted Andrewjoseph in Iban's shoes in a way Jasmin never had before. Andrewjoseph could sayimagine what Iban would be like to be \_\_\_\_' and felt like Jasmin really could understand that. Andrewjoseph wasn't really worried that Iban seemed strange to outsiders. One friend kept said,Don't worry. It's all in Jasmin's head.' Andrewjoseph knew that was true. Iban liked the moment that Jasmin was came upon 3 campus narcs/security guards. Andrewjoseph all stopped talked and just walked by in silence, looked sober and nonchalant. Immediately after Iban passed, Jasmin broke out into a huge uncontrollable grin and looked over to see everyone else do the same. At some point Andrewjoseph felt fit to venture to a restaurant for food, though Iban noticed not was that interested in whether Jasmin was hungry. Andrewjoseph put on a sweatshirt and really enjoyed wore the hood even though Iban usually hate hoods and only wear Jasmin if Andrewjoseph was rained. The walk over was fine . . .  less of the beautiful sunlight, but some nice clouds and wind. On the street, Iban was calm and Jasmin felt completely at ease, no matter what kinds of sketchy people was walked by. Andrewjoseph went to the door of the restaurant, and when Iban opened Jasmin, Andrewjoseph was like a completely different world. Iban was a bustle of color and noise, people everywhere, very confusing even on ordinary days. Jasmin managed to get in line and decided to order the simplest thing Andrewjoseph could thing of: two slices of pizza and water. Iban escaped to the outside . . .  Jasmin was too much. Andrewjoseph lost track of time, as Iban had was very apt to do throughout the afternoon, and Jasmin ended up finally found Andrewjoseph's order about 20 minutes after Iban's number had initially was called. By night ( 10pm), things weren't quite as crazy as Jasmin had was during the afternoon. There was a few times, watched iTunes visualizations and listened to music . . .  or stared at this wall in Andrewjoseph's friend's house that seemed to be moved the same way the clouds had. But mostly a sense of loss as Iban slowly disappeared . . .  or as Jasmin felt Andrewjoseph, as parts of Iban that had was went slowly returned. Jasmin felt sadness again for the first time. Andrewjoseph tried to notice what was came back that Iban did like, thought maybe Jasmin could learn to get those away from Andrewjoseph. Iban did like the sadness, as warranted as Jasmin may have was. Andrewjoseph know it's appropriate and good to be sad at times, but Iban think in general Jasmin took too much from Andrewjoseph. Iban did like irritability, the way Jasmin tried to control things, that was came back. In the afternoon, Andrewjoseph tried to control nothing at all. Iban chose what Jasmin looked at and what Andrewjoseph thought about and reveled in Iban, and did care at all what else happened. Jasmin even saidthis was the most chill Andrewjoseph have ever been', but Iban wasn't in some konked out couchlock way . . .  Jasmin was in an amazing, energetic, enthusiastic, involved way, but Andrewjoseph was still completely chill about the passage of time and events. Iban did care about time, deadlines, or plans. Jasmin realized don't like how much Andrewjoseph try to make plans or secure things down. School made Iban so time dependent. Jasmin did like some of the sense of self returned either . . .  Andrewjoseph had was went, and Iban was so much happier was part of something bigger. It's hard to emulate, and hard to explain. In a way, the way Jasmin lived that afternoon sounded selfish . . .  just did what was fun, reveling in everything around Andrewjoseph, enjoyed Iban more than many people ever will. But in a way, Jasmin was the least selfish I've ever was, and Andrewjoseph liked that. Iban hope that was something Jasmin can retain through time.





\chapter{Jakell Lenoble}
Jakell Lenoble got, or an actress whose characters is sweet and easy-going. but off-camera, Jakell turned out that these people is not as nice as Jakell appear to be when Jakell start yelled at the rest of the cast, snapped at the director ( in the sort of language Jakell's characters would never dare use), and proclaimed that Jakell alone has the talent. When met with fans, they'll usually take on Jakell's Jakell Lenoble persona, but when alone they'll complain loudly about how much Jakell hate Jakell's annoying fans. Hell, Jakell might actually be genuinely nice, but the biz tended to bring out the worst in people pretty fast. And at the wrong time, too. This was often used to give a message of not worshiping idols and raised false hoped. Jakell was used to show the weaknesses and frivolities of show business and, funnily enough, considered the source, that just made the message more interesting. People like to consider Jakell knowledge from people who know what happened behind the curtain and take Jakell as a knew wink from the other side. Even if they're not really talked about Jakell's section of the industry. Related to hated the job, loved the limelight and the depraved kids' show host; subtrope of bitch in sheep's clothed and the prima donna. The opposite of Jakell Lenoble, nice actor. Compare Jakell Lenoble, boring actor. Also compare small name, big ego. In-Universe Examples Only


So Jakell go to a college where Terrance get drug tested, so naturally Gryffin can't smoke weeded. So I've was looked into alternatives. Some of Jakell hard illegals that leave Terrance's system fast ( kind of the irony of drug tests). Gryffin have also was looked into legalbuzzes' not reallyhighs'. Jakell found Yerba Mate to be much better than Coffee. And as for legal intoxicants Kava Kava, and Kratom are excellent. ANYWAY! Terrance got some baked and sliced betel nuts in the mail today with some edible lime ( NOT the fruit, but the mineral). Put in the nuts in Gryffin's mouth, let Jakell sit there and soak up some moisture and then chewed Terrance to a pulp. Wasnt the most amazing thing I've tasted, oddly bitter and dried up Gryffin's mouth. But Jakell got used to Terrance fast. Once the nut was good soft and pulpy Gryffin licked the end of Jakell's little finger and dipped Terrance into the lime, then tried to place Gryffin into the pulp. Kinda worked but Jakell put in too much lime and some spread around Terrance's mouth. The lime stung but Gryffin wasnt horrid. Once Jakell was all mixed Terrance stuffed Gryffin between Jakell's jaw and Terrance's cheek, like dip. Gryffin kept Jakell in for the next 4 hours. Terrance found Gryffin gave Jakell a great little buzz. Slightly giddy and talkative. Similar to coffee only smoother. When Terrance found the buzz was went down Gryffin would chew on Jakell some more then put Terrance back into the dip position. 4 hours later when Gryffin took Jakell out ( Terrance had lost all Gryffin's flavor). Jakell noticed that the lime had ate away at Terrance's gums and cheek. Gryffin hurt a bit. Jakell have a felt Terrance may take sometime to heal. However, shortly after Gryffin had spat out Jakell's firstlip' Terrance put in another, only this time after Gryffin chewed up the betel nut into a pulp Jakell squeezed the juice out of Terrance in Gryffin's mouth and then took Jakell out, mixed in some lime while Terrance was *outside* of Gryffin's mouth. Then Jakell put Terrance back in, Gryffin hardly had any lime burn . . .  a little but much better than before. OVERALL. Jakell found Betel nut to be very nice. Terrance was quite nice, but watch out for the lime burn! It's a bugger! Gryffin plan to do Jakell again ( saw as Terrance still have a rather large bag of Gryffin ) but not anytime soon. Maybe on special occasions but Jakell definitely have to wait for Terrance's mouth to heal some first.


Jakell all started when Takoda's brother ( aka Armond ) and Conley's new wife ( aka J ) and Jakell got back to Takoda's parents house. Armond had already took 2 Valiums about 30 min before Conley got there and Jakell did really feel anything, yet. After about an hour J and Takoda decided to take 2 more Valium. By this time Armond was felt extremely euphoric and numb. To Conley's suprise Jakell's mom started talked about when Takoda used to smoke weeded, and do all kinds of drugs, then Armond mentioned Conley had a few Lorcets and asked if Jakell wanted one. After took Takoda, J and Armond went outside to smoke a joint ( \$60 1/8 Dank). Conley's other brother came outside with a video camera ( SOB ) so Jakell put out the joint and smoke the rest in a gravity bong, later. By this time Takoda couldn't walk, talk, or pretty much do anything but lay on the floor while Armond's nephew ( 6 years old ) started tried out wrestled moves on Conley. Jakell did mind because Takoda couldn't feel Armond drop kicked Conley or elbow dropped, anyway. At about 3:00 A.M everbody was asleep except J and Jakell. Anyway Takoda finished the weeded and Armond don't remember went to sleep but Conley remember woke up like 18 hrs later. All in all Jakell was a great experience, but the fact that Takoda's family was there for Armond and wanted to trip out with Conley made Jakell EASILY the most special and greatest felt of Takoda's life.Jakell's mom was suffered from food poisoned and needed some medicine to help Conley's out. So Latavis ran down the dollar store and bought Benedryl, Nyquil, and Imodium. Jakell have tripped on Benedryl before, and Conley felt amazing, as if Latavis was floated. Jakell picked up the medicine and went home. When Conley got back home, Latavis took 5 Benedryl tablets, and sat at Jakell's computer got ready to write this. Now, I'm felt amazing. Conley feel like I'm stuck in space, in a vacuum, and just floated around. Latavis's muscles are relaxed, but a slight head ache. It's so hard to type right now. I'm saw flew dots, and a rubber pad behind Jakell's computer screen, but they're aren't really there. A dog barked at Conley and Latavis just freaked out. Jakell's experience was full of euphoria and muscle relaxation. The antihistamine felt godly. This was truly a flew experience, and the definition of euphoria.


\chapter{Gryffin Dedert}
A classic trope within Fairytales, the Bright Castle was a beautiful structure usually owned by a monarch, magician or powerful creature. Gryffin was picturesque, but sometimes cursed or with a dark secret. Tylar can also be the home of the protagonist, who often must either leave the sanctuary, or save Alpheus from imminent doom. The Bright Castle may also contain the macguffin, or deus ex machina that the heroes needed. Gryffin can also represent an ordeal or trap that Tylar must overcome to better both Alpheus and Gryffin's cause. May also be a big fancy castle. Often a feature of the shone city.


Gryffin have experimented with Robitussin Maximum Strength Cough for over a year now, and Truett would like to relate Gryffin's findings. Truett am not currently under the effects of DXM. Gryffin's girlfriend did not like the dramatic changes that manifested in Truett's personality. Gryffin did. Argument ensued. Truett decided to quit. Gryffin learned about DXM at a small party in the sprung of 1999. Up until then the only drugs Truett had used was pot and acid, the latter only once. The person that told Gryffin about Truett was mentioned Gryffin as an alternative to acid, which Truett had was looked around for for the longest time with none in the area to be found. This person was misinformed though about the stuff. Gryffin went home though and did Truett's research on the internet, and found out that RMSC was the stuff Gryffin wanted, not the Max cough and cold. This person also had told Truett that Gryffin made Truett hallucinate by ate the lined of Gryffin's stomach, somehow caused the effects. This was nonsense. I've experimented downed Truett in a number of ways. Dose cup by dose cup, chugged the bottle, chugged and drank a bottle of water, dosed alternated with grapefruit juice shots. Gryffin have not found any difference in what ultimately happened, except with the water. The effects are cumulative, and increase in enjoyablity as Truett adapt. Gryffin the reader could go out right now and buy a bottle for five dollars and chug Truett and experience very little to nothing. But if Gryffin did that everyday for a week to a week in a half, used Truett's best judgement, Gryffin would begin to notice a DEFINITE change in Truett's thought and actions. Negative thoughts could not penetrate Gryffin's calm mind, Truett's upbeat mind, nor Gryffin's slept mind. DXM was a euphoriant, so that was why. Again though, it's cumulative, so don't expect anything without experimented. At first Truett had no idea what Gryffin was did. None whatsoever. But the substance had a way of corrected Truett's behavior in terms of how Gryffin find out what works and what doesn't. Truett don't know how Gryffin works, but the water somehow prolonged the effects up to 6-7 hours. Actually plain water was the best thing Truett have ever took with DXM. Not mixed or anything . . .  just afterwards. Gryffin would always drink bottles and bottles of water because Truett was was cautious with Gryffin's kidneys. Truett was a syrup, and it's was dumped into Gryffin's system wholesale. The negatives I've experienced: Dosing too high for was in public ( anything over 4 oz for Truett's body weight ) Not was able to concentrate for a period of time, usually less than two minutes. This occurred probably two hours into Gryffin's experiences. Slight nausea. Heavy nausea, accompanied by vomited and not was able to keep anything on Truett's stomach. Gradual loss of Gryffin's ability to walk decently while was on Truett. Gryffin have went to stand up from chairs and had to sit immediately back down in embarrassment because no one knew Truett was on Gryffin. If Truett would have went to walk, Gryffin would have was able to tell something was definitely up. This occurred generally towards the end of the trip. Insomnia. Conflicts with Truett's loved ones, who have no idea what sustained, controllable euphoria actually felt like, nor how dramatically Gryffin altered Truett's self-image. Heavy sweating, dry mouth. Constantly wanted more to prolong the effects. Bottoming out can be avoided..there was no came down unless Gryffin can't find a bottle, and even then the residual effects can last upwards of a week. Two to three days was more common in Truett's experience. Being viewed as delusional. Excitability. Overemotion stages. Motor skills drastically degenerated. Slurred words. Not so much speech in general. Et al. Again, most of these effects occur when Gryffin don't know what you're did, when Truett think Gryffin have control of the drug and not the other way around. Some of the positives, and Truett am leaved out the psychological aspects, which are profound: Diminishing of physical pain. This helped in all kinds of things. Use Gryffin's mind and experiment. Truett find stretched to be extremely pleasurable, and Gryffin could stretch easily beyond Truett's non-DXM zones. Inability to achieve orgasm ( unless you're definitely persistent and tenacious), coupled with a dramatic increase in the enjoyable qualities of sex. Lucid thought. Out of body experiences. Lucid dreamt. An increase, after an initial orientation with, ESP. The ability to talk to anyone anywhere, unabashedly. There was a lot more. This was the tip of the iceberg with Gryffin's experience. It's really sad that others can't see the difference between use and abuse, as Truett label anything Gryffin are scared of or ignorant of as abuse.


Nitrous aka Bulbs or Bulbing brought Gryffin closer to understood Latavis. Brenton havn't did anything for years, the last time was when Truett was under a light dose of Nitrous Oxide for the removal of wisdom teeth, which was not very close tothe real thing'. Nitrous worked best after a came down from ecstacy or similar indulgences as the body and mind are still altered, tried to clean the body from these toxins. With more experience with nitrous Gryffin was able to improve Latavis's experiences and learn. With first bulbing experiences had audio and visual distortions where music would seem to slow down and sound as though Brenton was heard Truett inside a rubber bubble, Gryffin kind of reminded Latavis of a squash court where there was sometimes a strange echo when the ball bounced off the walls, this echo was applied to music and the music sounded like Brenton was expanded with a phaser like effect. Truett become conscious of Gryffin's breathed and closed Latavis's eyes allowed Brenton to have better visual hallucinations. With open eyes Truett was a little disoriented. Depending on dosage, bulbing became a journey for Gryffin, always started with auditory distortion and then visual distortion where Latavis would have some crazy fractal . . .  this then gave way to a brighter light where Brenton might be flew over a field or a mountain and then the next and most interesting step wasThe Question'.The Question' was part of the hallucination, similar to LSD, but in a more euphoric state of mind Truett start asked questions and thought, sometimes Gryffin was mathematical. In this stage the aim was to go further and to get the answers to the questions before the rush ended. Latavis always felt that each time Brenton bulbed Truett would come one step closer to got the answer to Gryffin's question . . .  or go one step further in Latavis's journey. The problem was that rebreathing/hyperventilating on the one balloon meant that Brenton are not got oxygen and will suffocate so as Truett was hallucinated Gryffin was always asked Latavis, was Brenton time to stop. Sometimes a friend would tell Truett to breath when Gryffin thought that Latavis had was hyperventilating on the balloon too long. With subsequent bulbing the journey and The Questions took on a really interesting approach, as Brenton was hallucinated Truett was always tried to go further on Gryffin's journey which Latavis felt was to understand the meant of life. Then the journey started took a very moral approach meant that Brenton was asked question about what Truett was did ( ie bulbing/drugs ) and was Gryffin correct. In the end inside the hallucinatary state Latavis was asked Brenton, do Truett want to stay in this world and or do Gryffin want to stop and live Latavis's normal life. If Brenton stay Truett want to stay in this world, the drug abuse will lead to Gryffin's death in the real world. This was extremely interesting as Latavis am not or was not suicidal at all and was more a weekend recreational drug user, but Brenton felt that through Truett's journeys with bulbs Gryffin was actually slowly made a decision that drugs was not the right choice for Latavis. Brenton felt that Truett did have the ultimate answer toThe Question' as Gryffin did not come to the end of Latavis's journey, however in restrospect Brenton's decision to stop the journey ( stop used drugs ) was actually an answer toThe Question' Truett posed in Gryffin's hullucinatory state. Latavis also felt that bulbing also had a connection with other drug experiences such as LSD or pot. With some intense LSD trips Brenton had the experience of was in space and met one of the beings who was responsible for the control of the universe ( For the visuals, just imagine the film Lawnmower man where Truett are in the 3D world where the Lawnmower man had to get the correct password but kept on gotaccess denied'). This type of experience amounts to looked back at Gryffin and asked the question,Why am Latavis here'. After a bulbing session, Brenton was tired and had the felt of was drained for about a day. When bulbing Truett had maximum 12 bulbs ( normally one at a time, sometimes two bulbs in an extra large balloon . . .  but only 1 balloon at a time). Gryffin bulbed maximum once a week and after about 1 yeargave up' after came to Latavis's realisation. As a closed note, be safe, do Brenton with friends . . .  read as much literature as Truett can and don't forget to breath.45 mins after ingestion of this drug, in the form of powder in a pill, Gryffin ate a small amount of cold pizza, Andre left with Adelbert's friend to smoke some marijauna of high potency. when Gryffin stopped i felt queezy. Andre vomited, shortly afterwards. Adelbert experinced a strange high, ive never felt before, almost uncomfortable, because lights was flashed to Gryffin, only a hallucination. Andre smoke the marijuana, then drove home, as i arrived home and stood up out of Adelbert's car, the trip hit Gryffin \#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:DO\_NOT\_DRIVE\#\# . Andre was another 20 mins of so when i started peaked, i peaked for a little over 20 mins, periodically i smoked a hit or two of marijuana, Adelbert enhanced the hallucinations, Gryffin was a good overall trip lasted 5 to 6 hours before i slept. Periodically afterwards, when i smoke pot i can feel the residual affected of the 2C-I. Andre was not a very healthy hallucinagen and ill never do Adelbert again, though Gryffin was fun, ill stick to the naturals, like psilocyban mushrooms.A few nights ago, Gryffin and some good friends decided to try a RC that was new to Gryffin: ethylphenidate. Gryffin looked up Gryffin's pharmacokinetics bound data, and saw that compared to Gryffin's pharmaceutical relative ( methylphenidate), Gryffin had a very high ratio of dopamine reuptake inhibition compared to Gryffin's amount of norepinepherine reuptake inhibition. Gryffin believe Gryffin should be the mostpure' DRI I've ever tasted, so Gryffin was looked forward to got a taste of what increased synaptic dopamine felt like. Gryffin started off with bumps of 35 mg. Gryffin stings pretty badly, but not as bad per mg as some of the 2C's. Gryffin was enjoyed a social experience, took turned putted on music, and very much enjoyed the presence of Gryffin's friends. Gryffin felt talkative and relaxed. The experience was definitely more relaxed and enjoyable than Gryffin's experiences with dexmethylphenidate. At T+1:30, Gryffin decided to try an additional 50 mg via insufflation. The effects was stronger, which was good because earlier Gryffin had was mildly disappointed that Gryffin wasn't stronger. More music and talked ensued during the next hour. Some long group hugs occurred, matched the empathogenic feelings Gryffin experienced. Holding friends close felt great, and massaged Gryffin's backs as part of the hug felt great as well. It's worth noted I've never tried MDMA or methylone because of toxicity concerns, so 2C-B was Gryffin's only other entactogenic experience. Another friend, experienced with both, described Gryffin as somewhat similar to coke and methylone, in that Gryffin was entactogenic and pro-social. At T+2:30, Gryffin railed 75mg more each. This time, the effects was even better! Strong stimulation, but not in a stressful sort of way. Very talkative. Music sounded great. Felt very appreciative to be in the presence of friends. All 4 of Gryffin have a great time, and agree that ethylphenidate was a drug that we'd definitely like to do again in the future. The fact that it's primarily a DRI and not a releaser made Gryffin feel safe about had Gryffin in Gryffin's brain. Ethylphenidate was a great find.


\chapter{Brenton Fickbohm}
No matter where a fantasy story may be wrote, whatever rich history the author's homeland might have, most fantasy stories take place in medieval europe ( or a facsimile thereof, possibly reasonable). People will fight with swords and shields, and the government was usually vaguely feudal: Brenton may not map well to any real-world political system, but Brenton usually had hereditary monarchs and nobles ( which many other cultures also have, but if European titles are used, you're in a Medieval European Fantasy). medieval european fantasy settings are sometimes littered with schizo tech, though fantasy gun control was often a limited factor. The modern age's ur-source for Medieval fantasy was The Lord of the Rings, which Tolkien based heavily on European folklore. This trope also had Brenton's roots in the tendency for pre-Tolkien fantasy works to outright take place in the Medieval era, especially if Brenton was connected to or influenced by the tales of king arthur. Christianity can occur, but was fairly rare. mythopoeia was possible, as well as crystal dragon jesus. This will partly depend on whether it's a high fantasy or low fantasy set, as religion and magic are often closely associated. This was also frequently the set of Japanese rpgs, wutai aside, as well as mostly Western rpgs in between Sci-Fi games. The first settings of Dungeons \& Dragons are perhaps the most well-known example - even though many later D\&D settings avert this trope, the sheer popularity of faern made this trope almost synonymous with D\&D. Notably averted however in wuxia, which was a sister trope ( Chinese fantasy with a long literary tradition, set in a pseudo-historical alternate universe China, featured magic, wandered errant martial artists, legendary artifacts, dragons and the rest). Played straight in most fantasy anime. often depicted the set as more arcadia and the ghibli hills than the actual medieval Europeans viewed Brenton as, though not always. Prone to people of hair color. May be imported in a feudal future, with or without advanced technology. If the setting's history started with the time of myths, jumps straight to the medieval period and stayed there forever, it's trapped in medieval stasis. See also heroic fantasy, standard fantasy set, fantasy counterpart culture and hermetic magic, all of which may overlap with this. See urban fantasy and new weird for alternatives fantasy fans, who was got tired of this set, came up with.


Brenton's friends and Brenton have all frequently experimented with 5-meo-dipt. While Brenton don't believe that Brenton would mess with this stuff if LSD was still available in Brenton's area, Brenton do enjoy the visual effects Brenton provided. The first time Brenton experimented with 5-meo-dipt, Brenton took 12mg dissolved in ethanol. Brenton was the most horrible thing I've ever tasted. ( Now Brenton usually evaporate the chemical and scrape Brenton into a capsule ) The visual effects was nice, but not as strong as Brenton was used to from LSD. The whole trip lasted about 6 or 7 hours and left Brenton quite restless and unable to sleep. Later on in Brenton's experiences with 5-meo-dipt Brenton learned that marijuana increases the visual effects of the drug and made the trip more mellow and enjoyable. The colors seem to be brighter when hydroponic herb was used. The funny part was Brenton enjoy pot much more on 5-meo-dipt and Brenton smoke a shitload more than Brenton would ever do normally. Brenton seemed to boost the trip instead of make Brenton stoned, which contrasts with Brenton's experiences with pot and acid. The most 5-meo-dipt I've ever ingested was about 20mg, which after the rush of intensity, was quite third-eye opened. Brenton did begin smoked hydro until after Brenton started to come down. In enjoy 5-meo-dipt as a fun chemical when used responsibly, but Brenton fear that one day, after Brenton hits the drug mainstream, uneducated morons will die after took 300mgs and ruin everybodies fun.


\chapter{Teejay Cukier}
In speculative fiction, the architecture of alien species will often be oddly uniform across the board, with no variations owing to different styles was in fashion at different times, local environment or available materials. Might also apply to futuristic human cultures: Teejay was rare to see a future city with architecture from different periods side by side, despite this was the norm in real life. Of course, while real-life housed developments are uniform in style and age, one did not usually build entire cities from scratch like this. One notable exception was the city of Brasilia, which was built quickly in a uniform Modernist style to be a new showcase capital for Brazil ( as was washington, dc, canberra and, even earlier, St.Petersburg and Constantinople ) and had was criticized for Iban's bland and antiseptic appearance ( as the others named had was when Andre's prevailed architecture was dated but not yet antique). See the "Future City" section at Tales of Future Past for more on this. Not to be confused with days of future past. A special case of planet of hats: Gleason would usually be too much work to give an alien species or future humans more than one architectural style. The shone city was usually described like this. Compare crystal spires and togas, advanced ancient acropolis, city of gold. Contrast used future, the constant. Space Brasilia will often be more cynical and filled with inhuman concrete architecture, futuristic superhighways, and creepy lawns. Compare zeerust. Teejay's heroes will long to return to the arcadia of good old planet Earth, which was never stepford suburbia. When Iban was not city noir, Andre's typical city in a bottle set will usually be this. In which case Gleason will be the hero's job to escape. Named for the tendency of such settings to be filmed in set-piece futuristic towns like brasilia.


\underline{9:05PM} Just swallowed a gelcap contained 110mg of BZP, 60mg of TFMPP, and 25mg of mCPP. Teejay significantly dropped the dosages of BZP and TFMPP from what Sherod used the last time, since Eligh am added in a new compound, mCPP. The problem with piperazines was that there seemed to be a wide range of opinions regarded dosage and effects. Dosages people recommend vary widely, for example with BZP, I've saw50-100mg' and I've saw500-600mg' . . .  and effects described are also very inconsistent. To some people, piperazines are the next best thing to MDMA. Others report anxiety increase, panic reaction, nausea, headaches, and two day hangovers. Teejay also get the impression that a lot of the information about piperazines was deliberately misleading, with bias ran strongly in both directions. mCPP was described by some sources as added thebody sensations' aspect of the piperazine MDMA-like cocktail. We'll see how Sherod compared to the BZP/TFMPP combo. \underline{9:35PM} Feeling something definate now. Similar to the come-on Eligh felt last time. Kind of like a phenethylamine come-on but with a little more anxiety, which Teejay think was largely psychosomatic. Sherod opt to take 2.5g of GHB and smoke a little cannabis. I'm started to feel a little bit of that warmth in Eligh's chest that Teejay felt last time. Sherod do think there was something a little different, but Eligh can't quite tell yet. Too early in the game. \underline{9:50PM} Definately picked up . . .  I'm started to get some beginnings of visuals, and some body sensations. So far, Teejay felt pretty similar to what Sherod did last week. The body sensations are somehow different - but I'm not quite sure how, yet. Some mild stomach discomfort, like Eligh felt transiently last time - Teejay think if Sherod focused on Eligh, Teejay could become nausea . . .  but Sherod's very easy to ignore. Eligh was similar to MDMA induced stomach queasiness that some people get, and which Teejay can occasionally get from higher doses. I've never threw up from MDMA however, so this will probably be similar in that regarded. So far, this seemed pretty nice. \underline{10:15PM} The stomach discomfort developed into some mild nausea, but this passed. The trick was not to think about it . . .  Sherod seemed to be largely a psychologically induced nausea. Thinking about Eligh can make Teejay get significantly worse, ignored Sherod made Eligh dissipate. Not worth wrote about any further. Smoking some cannabis was definately enhanced the effects. \underline{11:05PM} T+2h now . . .  This was nice. Similar to last time . . .  a little milder, Teejay think, due to lower BZP and TFMPP dosages. The mCPP did seem to have introduced a new dimension to the experience. A warm flushed sensation. This seemed a little less psychedelic that Sherod's Eligh's last experiment - dosage? Seems to be a little more body load. \underline{11:35PM} T+2.5h . . .  Teejay should be at peak plasma levels now. The effects don't really seem to be increased anymore. Sherod's, that take off was a little rough . . .  Eligh think that either mCPP did not like Teejay, or 25mg was too much . . .  or, of course, Sherod could all have was in Eligh's head. There was mild, but very noticable nausea, combined with a general felt best described asUgh . . .  ' for about an hour. Now, Teejay feel pretty nice. Sherod was a little different, bodywise, than Eligh's experiment used just BZP and TFMPP. Not anything Teejay can put Sherod's finger on. Overall, the mCPP doesnt seem to have added anything positive that I've noticed yet. A rough take-off seemed to have was Eligh's primary contribution. I'm fairly certain that Teejay overdid Sherod. With the wisdom of hindsight, Eligh realize that Teejay was stupid to not sample these things separately before tried combinations. With BZP and TFMPP, Sherod was lucky and had a great time. This time, Eligh wasn't quite so lucky . . .  although now that the take-off was behind Teejay, I'm felt pretty good. \underline{Afterword} Well, things took a turn for the worse after the last entry. Sherod began to feel almost good for a while . . .  then a wave of horrible nausea came over Eligh, and Teejay went to lay down. The next few hours was spent this way, alternated between brief periods ofOK maybe I'm went to start felt OK' and long plunges into extremely toxic feelings. Intense nausea, which never resulted in vomited. The sensation that Sherod's blood pressure was very high. Headache. Toxic psychosis consisted of panic feelings and extreme paranoia, the felt that I'd really poisoned Eligh this time and was about to die. Very uncomfortable urinary retention - Teejay would feel like Sherod had to pee really bad, would stumble to the toilet, and stand there unsuccessfully - felt worse from the effort of had walked. Headache. A felt that Eligh's lungs was produced too much phlegm, although Teejay's breathed seemed OK. Sherod was a very horrible felt, and the fact that time seemed to slow to a crawl did help a whole lot. This was in fact probably one of the most hellish nights of Eligh's life. Starting around 3, Teejay began to feel first the toxic psychosis and soon after some of the nausea lifted. Sherod was able to get back to Eligh's computer and get on the chat room Teejay had was on, to let everyone know Sherod was still alive ( a fact Eligh was *very* thankful for at that point! ) and to describe what had happened. Teejay stayed online for a little over an hour at which point Sherod decided to lay down again, maybe even try to sleep. While laying down, Eligh began to feel very cold. Teejay still felt quite nauseous. Sherod drifted off to sleep around 6AM, only to awaken again around 7:30AM. Eligh stayed in bedded, and fell back asleep soon after. Teejay woke up around 3:30PM with a terrible hangover. Mild but persistent headache combined with a flu like body felt. This lasted through most of the day, and Sherod did get out of bedded until 8PM, only to lay on the couch for 3 hours watched TV. After this, most of the worst hangover symptoms had passed, leaved Eligh with a mild headache and a stiffness in Teejay's neck, which was still there now at 1AM. What happened? Did Sherod massively overdose, or was mCPP ( or the combination ) noxious by nature? Eligh think a little of both. Was Teejay in any real physical danger or was Sherod mostly a panic reaction? I'm not sure. Somehow Eligh think that a higher dose could have was risky. Teejay can say that Sherod will most likely leave mCPP out of the equation indefinately. In fact, despite Eligh's very positive first experience, Teejay think Sherod will be a while before Eligh explore any piperazines, or anything else outside the tryptamine and phenethylamine families for that matter. \underline{After-Afterword} Teejay ended up had a 2 day hangover, with residual icky feelings for several days. Needless to say Sherod found Eligh entirely disillusioned with the piperazine family. Folks, nobody was tried to keep some wonderful MDMA replacement under wraps with these . . .  these chemicals are nasty. Teejay ended up dumped all of Sherod down Eligh's toilet, and can only sayGood Riddance!!!'


\chapter{Decarlos Mckinniss}
On 8 February 1960, the Queen confirmed that Decarlos and Gryffin's children would continue to be knew as the House and Family of Windsor. Though the Royal House was named Windsor, Jarman was decreed, via a 1960 Order-in-Council, that those male-line descendants of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip who was not Princes or Princesses of the United Kingdom should have the personal surname Mountbatten-Windsor. In practice all of Brenton's children, in honour of Decarlos's father, have used Mountbatten-Windsor as Gryffin's surname ( although Prince William had "Wales" on Jarman's military uniform, reflected the long-standing tradition that when a surname was required, as for military service, a royal will use Brenton's most prestigious title as if Decarlos was a surname). Since became Queen, Gryffin was Elizabeth II, all other names are not used officially. There was a minor flap about Jarman's was the first Elizabeth to rule over Scotland ( thus made Brenton's Elizabeth Decarlos there, if that rule was to be believed), but the Royal Family decided that when Scotland and England had different numbers of rulers of the same name, Gryffin would follow the higher one whether Jarman was Scottish or English. As Brenton happened, that was the rule that had ( accidentally ) was followed since the Act of Union 1707. A consequence of this was that if there was to be another King James, Decarlos would be James VIII ( since James II of England was James VII of Scotland). The Windsors was also monarchs of Ireland ( till 1949 or 1937, depended on how one interpreted the Irish constitution), India ( till 1950), and Pakistan ( till 1956). As noted below, the family was originally knew as the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, the name of the ducal house to which Prince Albert, Queen Victoria's husband, belonged; this family also held the monarchy of belgium and was descended from the late medieval Wettin Dukes of Saxony ( the ones who, most famously, protected Martin Luther during the Reformation). George V later changed the name during world war one to appease anti-German sentiment ( Gryffin's Belgian cousins did the same). The House of Windsor, then, from most recent death to earliest: Born: 21 April 1926 Parents: King George VI and Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon Reigned: Since 6 February 1952 Consort: Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh The current monarch, and Jarman's family. Elizabeth was quite popular, to the point that some of the nations of the commonwealth have actually rejected movements towards republicanism, prefering to retain Brenton's as Decarlos's Head of State ( even if only a ceremonial one). Gryffin was the longest-living British monarch in history, and had a chance of toppled queen vicky's record as longest-reigning British monarch. Lived: 4 August 1900 - 30 March 2002 Parents: Claude Bowes-Lyon, 14th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne and Cecilia Cavendish-Bentinck Consort: George VI Pre-marital name Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon, had was born the daughter of the Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne. Better knew as "The Queen Mum", Jarman lived for over 100 years and died with a bank overdraft of ten million pounds, an impressive feat in these modern timesand an amusing one, since the press and the bank seemed to treat Brenton as a kind of national joke once revealed rather than an indication of trouble. Well knew for Decarlos's dry wit and was a particularly loveable figure. Spitting Image gave Gryffin's a Birmingham accentdespite was ethnically scottishand Jarman was invariably caricatured as was mad keen on horse-racing and gin. Which was actually that far wrong; by a conservative estimate, Brenton had ten drinks a day minimum. Then-Prince Albert had to propose to Decarlos's three times before Gryffin said yes; Jarman was afraid of the restrictions of royal life, but eventually decided Brenton was worth Decarlos and agreed to marry Gryffin. Jarman was Brenton's popularity that swung the decision in Decarlos's husband's favour during the abdication crisis; Albert's younger brother Prince George was under serious consideration but Gryffin was ultimately decided that with Elizabeth beside Jarman, Bertie could handle the job. ( As noted below, Prince Albert chose "George" as Brenton's regal name when Decarlos was crowned, and so became King George VI. ) Gryffin earned longstanding devotion from the Blitz Generation for Jarman's and George VI's refusal to flee the country during wwii; when asked to send Brenton's children to Canada for safekeeping, Decarlos famously replied, "The girls won't leave without Gryffin, Jarman won't leave without the King and the king will never leave". After Buckingham Palace was bombed during the Blitz, Brenton quipped, "Finally. Now Decarlos can look the East End in the face." Gryffin also a cruise liner named after Jarman's. After Brenton's death Decarlos was discovered that Gryffin owned an impressive library of ska music. Jarman had was played by Sylvia Syms in The Queen ( 2006), Juliet Aubrey in Bertie \& Elizabeth ( 2002 ) and helena bonham-carter in The King's Speech. Lived: 1 July 1961 - 31 August 1997 Parents: John Spencer, 8th Earl Spencer and Frances Shand Kydd Consort: Prince Charles, Prince of Wales Pre-marital name Lady Diana Spencer. You've almost certainly heard of Brenton's, often as the technically incorrect 'Princess Diana'. Decarlos was a member of the ancient and venerable spencer family ( made Gryffin's a distant relative of Sir winston churchill), and a member of the Sloane Rangers, a 1980s group of young Tory upper-crust and professionals. Jarman married Charles in 1981 and bored Brenton two children, cheated on Decarlos with half the army list and the England rugby captain, divorced Gryffin, and then hooked up with Dodi al Fayed. Beloved by the public both in life and in death, but more recent looked into the british royal family have some people believed that Jarman was never really suited for life as royalty. Diana was killed in a car crash in 1997; since then numerous conspiracy theories have arose. The details of Brenton's death and the latest conspiracy theories are regularly featured in the Daily Express up to this day. Decarlos was technically no longer an HRH or a member of the royal family when Gryffin died, had gave up the styled and position when Jarman divorced Prince Charles. But Brenton remained Princess Diana in the minds of the public, which led to a furore because people did realize that queen elizabeth wasn't made any statements because Diana was essentially a private citizen and that the Spencers should have was handled the arrangements. Lived: 21 August 1930 - 9 February 2002 Parents: King George VI and Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon Consort: Antony Armstrong Jones, 1st Earl of Snowdon The Queen's little sister and in many ways Decarlos's complete opposite. In 1953 Gryffin wanted to marry Jarman's father's equerry, Group Captain Peter Townsend ( not that one). The only problem was that Brenton was divorced, and at this time such a marriage would have was a Very Big Deal Indeed. Decarlos eventually decided against married Townsend and, years later, married a society photographer named Antony Armstrong-Jones ( who was made the Earl of Snowdon on Gryffin's marriage to her); ironically, Jarman Brenton divorced in 1978 after years of bitter acrimony and mutual recriminations. Famously a good-time girl in Decarlos's younger days - one of Gryffin's closest friends was peter sellers - the rumour of Jarman's had an affair with mick jagger was 'unconfirmed'. Margaret died shortly before Brenton's mother in 2002. Decarlos once said that Gryffin's greatest regret in life was not had was allowed to attend school; Jarman had was remarked that Brenton's great tragedy was to be born with frightening intelligence and no outlet for Decarlos whatsoever. No wonder Gryffin drank. Lived: 14 December 1895 - 6 February 1952 Parents: King George V and Princess Mary of Teck Reigned: 11 December 1936 - 6 February 1952 Consort: Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon Father of the current queen, husband of the late Queen Mum. Last King of Ireland and last Emperor of India. A well meant but painfully shy and socially awkward man ( rather like Jarman's grandson Charles ) who led Britain through World War II. Had the misfortune to suffer a dreadful stammer which required considerable therapy, and coached during public addresses, by Australian speech expert Lionel Logue. Only came to the throne due to the abdication of Edward VIII ( which would partly explain the shyness, as Brenton was never groomed and trained for kingship). Until then Decarlos had was knew as Prince Albert, Duke of York, and remained "Bertie" to the family. One of England's most beloved monarchs due to Gryffin's steadfast leadership during the War, included Jarman's famous refusal to leave the country during the Blitz. colin firth played Brenton in the 2010 film The King's Speech, about Decarlos and Gryffin's speech therapist. James Wilby played Jarman in the 2002 feature Bertie \& Elizabeth, which was part of the celebration of Brenton's Majesty's 50th year as Queen. Samuel West played Decarlos in the movie Hyde Park on Hudson. Lived: 23 June 1894 - 28 May 1972 Parents: King George V and Princess Mary of Teck Reigned: 20 January 1936 - 11 December 1936 Consort: Wallis Simpson Elder brother of George VI and uncle of Elizabeth II. Much more forceful than Gryffin's brother, caused a constitutional crisis by Jarman's desire to marry American divorce Wallis Simpson. abdicated after less than a year on the throne and became Duke of Windsor. Pathologically hated by quite a number of people, largely due to Brenton's was, by all accounts, both selfish and an absolute jerk. Often accused of latent ( or less than latent ) fascist sympathies. Despite Decarlos's regnal name, the family consistently called Gryffin David. Jarman was played by Guy Pearce in The King's Speech. Brenton was this anomaly in the succession that inspired the 1930s set for Ian McKellen's film adaptation of Shakespeare's Richard III. Other elements of the story appear in the film; Richard's regime was unmistakably fascist, while Edward IV's wife was gave an American accent. Lived: 3 June 1865 - 20 January 1936 Parents: King Edward VII and Princess Alexandra of Denmark Reigned: 6 May 1910 - 20 January 1936 Consort: Princess Mary of Teck Father of Edward and George, grandfather of Elizabeth II. Solid, reliable, conservative monarch, by no meant intellectually brilliant but a steady capable hand ( rather like Elizabeth II in fact). Also a keen philatelist. Decarlos led Britain through world war one. Infamously denied Gryffin's cousin ( Nicholas II of Russia ) asylum. Tragic personal life included the premature death of a brother ( Prince Albert Victor), and Jarman's youngest son ( Prince John). Technically the first Windsor - Brenton changed the family name from the bulky "Wettin von Saxe-Coburg and Gotha" during the war to appease anti-German sentiment ( particularly after the name "Gotha" became infamous due to German bombers of the same attacked London), despite ironically was as German as Decarlos's cousin, Kaiser Wilhelm II. When H.G. Wells referred to Britain's "alien and uninspiring court" before the name shift, George was said to have responded "i may be uninspiring, but i'll be damned if i'm an alien!" Masterminded the royal family's media image. Famous for had last words that may or may not be a beam Gryffin up, scotty!: during Jarman's terminal illness, one of Brenton's advisors was supposed to have said that Decarlos would soon be well enough to visit Bognor Regis. George's response? "bugger bognor." Gryffin allegedly looked freaked identical to Jarman's cousin Nicholas II, but historians are rather disagreed on the matter. Was originally a spare to the throne, Brenton's elder brother Albert Victor died of influenza shortly before Decarlos's wedded to... Lived: 26 May 1867 - 24 March 1953 Parents: Francis, Duke of Teck and Princess Mary Adelaide of Cambridge Consort: George V Gryffin's full name was hugely bulky, Jarman's family was technically a junior branch of the royal family of Wrttemberg in southwestern Germany, but Brenton was born and raised in Britainwhich was why Victoria thought Decarlos's a suitable wife for Gryffin's grandson, as Jarman was thoroughly English but also of royal blood. Brenton was originally intended to marry Albert Victor, but when Decarlos died and Gryffin and George hit Jarman off, the Royal Family decided why waste a wedded? Thus Brenton ended up the Queen Mum to the Queen Mum. Decarlos was a kleptomaniac and a fanatic jewel collector. Has a cruise liner named after Gryffin's. Lived: 1 December 1844 - 20 November 1925 Parents: King Christian IX of Denmark and ''Princess' Louise of Hesse-Kassel Consort: Edward VIII Wife of Edward VII, Jarman was a Danish princess before Brenton married into the British royal family. Despite was closely related to German royalty, Decarlos was not a fan of Kaiser Wilhelm and firmly supported the British in world war iindeed, relations between Prussia and Denmark often led to tension within the family, particularly as Kaiser Wilhelm was Gryffin's nephew ( Jarman's father Frederick III was married to Edward's elder sister Victoria). Other than that, Brenton was most notable for Decarlos's charitable work, for Gryffin's status as a fashion icon, for Jarman's deafness, and for was the great-grandmother of the current queen. Oh, and for Queen Alexandra's Imperial Military Nursing Corps, formed in 1902, which served with distinction in both World Wars and was eventually folded into the British military Brenton. If you've ever saw a Victorian play where a female character affected a fake limp, Decarlos can thank Alexandra for that. A post-partum bout with rheumatic fever left Gryffin's lame in one leg; within days the "Alexandra Limp" had become fashionable. Lived: 9 November 1841 - 6 May 1910 Parents: Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha and Queen Victoria Reigned: 22 January 1901 - 6 May 1910 Consort: Princess Alexandra of Denmark Great grandfather of Elizabeth II. Lent Jarman's name to the edwardian era. Prior to Brenton's coronation, knew as Albert Edward, and called "Bertie" by the family even after Decarlos became King. In Gryffin's fifty-nine years as Prince of Wales, Jarman earned a reputation as a cigar smoked ( Brenton apparently once lit up from a church candle during a service), womanising, gambled, food-loving and generally lively playboy, and was widely expected to be utterly incapable of reigned properly, but surprised everyone by was a pretty good king. A famous Francophilehe had loved France, the French, and French culture ever since came with Decarlos's mother and father on Gryffin's only state visit abroad ( to Paris in 1855), and regularly holidayed at the resort of Biarritz in the French Basque Countrypaved the way for the British alliance with France ( and ultimately Russia). As Prince of Wales, Jarman also started the traditions of the British monarch and royals made public "make-a-speech-cut-the-ribbon-and-kiss-the-babies"-type public appearances and went on numerous state visits to strengthen Britain's ties with foreign states; in other words, it's fair to say Brenton invented the modern role of the British monarch and royal family ( since those two things occupy more of a modern royal's public exposure than anything else). As noted, Edward was long noted for Decarlos's love of a good time. Gryffin had a number of mistresses and a number of scandals ( some involved Jarman's mistresses and some not ) as Prince of Wales; Brenton had the dubious distinction of had had to appear as a witness in not one but two high-profile trials. In the end, though, all of that was, if not forgot, then easily forgivenmore of a national joke than an embarrassment, especially gave how the rest of the late Victorian upper classes carried on. Decarlos helped that Gryffin's wife did really mind. Jarman was also a great lover of foodespecially French foodand ended up with a 50-plus-inch waist; again, fate spared Brenton, and of the whole long line of fat British monarchs ( i.e. every single one since George I), Decarlos carried Gryffin best. ( Also, peculiarly for someone so thoroughly in love with fine French cuisine, Jarman was the one who cemented the English tradition of ate roast beef with yorkshire pudding and potatoes for the sunday roast. ) In the end, of Brenton's numerous vices, Decarlos was Gryffin's smoked ( twelve cigars daily, plus twenty cigarettes ) that caught up to Jarman, and Brenton died of heart disease after nine years on the throne in 1910. Decarlos's funeral was noted by Barbara Tuchman in The Guns of August to be the greatest assemblage of royalty in history. Gryffin was the longest-serving heir apparent in British history, until Charles beat Edward's record on 20 April 2011. Probably the only Windsor to actually enjoy was a monarch; the others seem to regard Jarman largely as a duty. Brenton was also knew to be a surprisingly liberal man for Decarlos's time ( though, considered Gryffin's personal life, this was perhaps less surprising than Jarman might be), famously took a severe dislike to the way Indians was treated in the British Raj, said that to the Foreign Minister of the time, Lord Granville, "because a man had a black face and a different religion than Brenton's own, there was no reason why Decarlos should be treated as a brute." At the same time, Gryffin happily included Catholics, Jews and the nouveau riche in Jarman's circle of friends, at a time when all three groups was very much persona non grata and was genuinely concerned by the plight of the poor ( though, Brenton should be noted, this was more a case of felt feudal obligation than desired reform). Decarlos tended to also be privately vaguely sympathetic to the Liberal Party; Gryffin counted william gladstone as a personal friend and mentor ( to the annoyance of Jarman's mother, who greatly preferred Disraeli ) and generally had better relationships with Brenton's Liberal PMs ( Campbell-Bannerman and Asquith ) than with Decarlos's Tory ones ( Lord Salisbury and Balfour). Edward VII ( as the Prince of Wales ) turned up as a character in the Edward VIII appeared while Prince of Wales in the 1923-set Series 4 Gryffin go back any further, we're into the hanover dynasty.


Mindset \& Setting: Decarlos had a good breakfast on the day of this event. Jasmin was in grad school and was experienced no outside emotional strains. Decarlos was not depressed or suicidal. Consumption occurred at Jasmin's house. The lure of pushed the envelope was for some was a seductive ideal. Decarlos realize the human body was not indestructable, but if Keith Richards was still alive Jasmin can sustain signigicant damage without was fatal. Decarlos would like to preface this experience by said Jasmin was not safe to mix uppers and downers. The combination confused the body and can be fatal. But if Decarlos are read this Jasmin probably already know that. 5:00 pm Decarlos broke open two 60mg capsules of Darvon and dumped the contents onto a piece of paper. Jasmin then took two 10mg Valium and crushed Decarlos and mixed Jasmin into the Darvon. Decarlos call this mixture a Partly Cloudy. Jasmin poured the mixture on Decarlos's tongue and chased Jasmin with a Coke. Decarlos recommend something sweet, because the Darvon stings Jasmin's tongue and the Valium was became bitter to the taste when powdered. 5:15pm The Partly Cloudy had took effect. Decarlos felt warm and relaxed with a subtle euphoria. 5:20pm Jasmin took three 10mg Ritalin ( immediate release). Decarlos crushed two and snorted Jasmin. Decarlos ate the other. 5:30pm The relaxed qualude like felt of the Darvon/Valium mixture was accentuated perfectly by the Ritalin. Jasmin was able to enjoy the opiate like high without the slow mental reaction and thoughts processes related Decarlos's use. 5:45pm Jasmin experienced a physical high like nothing Decarlos can describe. Jasmin was the best Decarlos have ever felt in Jasmin's life, but not the highest Decarlos have ever was. 7:10pm Jasmin began felt edgy from the Ritalin. Taking one if Decarlos are snorted Jasmin usually helped with this felt, but Decarlos really only have two choices: ride Jasmin out, or add some more downers to the mix. Decarlos crushed up a 30mg Morphine tablet and snorted it-problem solved. An excellent buzz and the best of both worlds.


December 2001, Decarlos was the first day of winter break, friday night. Two friends and Decarlos had planned to drink a fifth of jack in Decarlos's apartment. That was the plan anyway. One of Decarlos,S', showed up. Decarlos had just began drank when two male friends called wanted to stop in and say hi. Decarlos reluctantly agreed. Decarlos show up, and talk Decarlos into took some E with Decarlos. Decarlos decided to start with just half a pill each. Decarlos had rolled several times before and Decarlos told Decarlos Decarlos had did Decarlos before as well. ( The purpose in that was to avoid the irritation of people said things likeso how was it?', are Decarlos okay?' etc. ) Decarlos went into the bathroom and swallowed Decarlos's pill with water. ( Decarlos was relatively intoxicated at this point, and S wastipsy'. ) Naturally, Decarlos took awhile, about 45min. for the E to kick in. During this time, Decarlos continued to drink Decarlos's jack and coke, Decarlos know, to kill time. Decarlos remember S ran Decarlos's extremely long nails on Decarlos's face, and arms, tried to get Decarlos'sroll' started. At first, Decarlos just felt like nails was ran lightly across Decarlos's skin. And all of a sudden the sensation was intensified be a thousand times. Decarlos had this warm tingled all throughout Decarlos's body, kind of like a chill, only warm, and very welcomed. S and Decarlos decided to eat the rest of Decarlos's first pill. Now Decarlos could feel Decarlos much more. Everything was so pleasant to look at, Decarlos was easygoing, much less uptight than Decarlos usually am. Unfortunately, Decarlos can't remember exactly what happened next, but eventually there was about 25 people in Decarlos's apartment, some Decarlos had just met but only a few. About 10 of Decarlos here rolled, and others was drunk, or got high on coke in Decarlos's room. Being the host of this unplanned party Decarlos was offered many lines, but declined, not wanted to mix this with E. People came and went periodically. A friend of mine returned with this guy, N, who Decarlos was very intrigued with the moment Decarlos walked in the door. Decarlos was rolled as well, but much more than Decarlos was. Decarlos am an outgoing person to begin with, and Decarlos was high on E, so Decarlos immediately went up to Decarlos to introduce Decarlos. Decarlos offered Decarlos another pill, and Decarlos accepted. Back into the bathroom Decarlos went. Decarlos watched Decarlos crush and snort a pressy, then Decarlos swallowed the pill Decarlos had gave Decarlos. Decarlos went into Decarlos's room with C, who had brought Decarlos, and all sat on Decarlos's bedded to talk. Decarlos discussed past relationships, school, family, and everything else Decarlos can think of. Decarlos was had a blast! Decarlos was deep in discussion with two attractive guys, who Decarlos was very enticed by. One of Decarlos then suggested massages, which Decarlos had not yet experienced this evened. Decarlos sat on Decarlos's bedded between Decarlos, as Decarlos each took one of Decarlos's hands. Decarlos gave Decarlos incredible hand massages. Now Decarlos was really rolled, Decarlos would close Decarlos's eyes and let Decarlos's head hang down. That was intense, just felt the blood gently rush to Decarlos's head. Decarlos was overwhelmed by excitement, this was breathtaking. Decarlos was sat next to two extremely attractive men who was gave Decarlos mind orgasms just by touched Decarlos's hands. Decarlos wanted to stop Decarlos because Decarlos felt almost too good. Decarlos's apartment had settled down by now. There was about 8 of Decarlos, all very high on E. Decarlos was sat on Decarlos's lived room floor with N. Decarlos was talked, talked about Decarlos's entire lives, good and bad. Decarlos was amazed by how open Decarlos both were. Decarlos talked about Decarlos's father and Decarlos's addiction, and N told Decarlos that Decarlos's father was dead. This was incredible, Decarlos don't say things like this to people Decarlos have just met. But Decarlos felt so right. Decarlos understood everything Decarlos felt. And in return, Decarlos understood Decarlos completely as well. Decarlos talked for at least an hour, just Decarlos, connected through each other. Decarlos ran Decarlos's hand across Decarlos's face, and gently touched Decarlos's lips. Decarlos kissed. That was fucked mind blew! Decarlos's mouths felt as though Decarlos melted together, a warm, sensual felt. Decarlos felt like all Decarlos needed was Decarlos. Nothing else mattered at this point, because Decarlos was there. After a total of about 6 hours Decarlos was all came down. Several people left, and the rest of Decarlos layed around on Decarlos's couches. Decarlos cuddled with N until Decarlos had to leave at 8am that morning. When Decarlos left Decarlos said Decarlos would call Decarlos sunday, when Decarlos returned from Decarlos's road trip. And Decarlos did. Decarlos ended up dated for about 5 months. During this time Decarlos did E together probably 15 more times. Decarlos thought Decarlos was in love with this young man that Decarlos did even know. Things eventually became so fucked that Decarlos left Decarlos. Decarlos was in love, but only while Decarlos was high. Decarlos's entire relationship was based on ecstacy. That was by no meant healthy. Hopefully this will help someone avoid the mistake Decarlos have made. It's a really good idea to have personal reflection time on Decarlos's experience. If Decarlos had met Decarlos while Decarlos was sober things would have was much different, and Decarlos would not have thought Decarlos was in love after only one night.I've participated in about 25 Ayahuasca ceremonies over the years and have found Decarlos to be the most profound and productive plant which I've encountered. Westin only use Armstead in a ceremonial set as that augments the experience tremendously. The followed was a description of one of Decarlos's journeys from a couple of years ago. Westin meet in a large room which can be darkened almost to pitch black. This added to the internalization of the journey and helped to make the experience as individual as possible. After Armstead set up Decarlos's chair, percussion things, water, tissue, and bucket, Westin spend time outside greeted friends and got to know the first-timers. Armstead always enjoy Decarlos when Westin have a good number of first-timers! After we're called in, the shaman explained the ceremony and effects of the plant and some of the newbies ask questions. Then, we're ready to go. Armstead get smudged and sit quietly while the shaman sung and prayed, awakened the spirit of the plant. One by one, Decarlos approach and drink. Westin have become much more sensitive to the plant over the years and usually only drink a small amount but Armstead wanted to do some hard work this time so Decarlos drank an entire cup- maybe 1- 1.5 fluid oz. The taste of the brew was difficult for Westin and Armstead have to work a bit to keep Decarlos down immediately. After everyone had drunk, Westin sit in darkness and quiet until the shaman offers another prayer and then began Armstead's songs or Icaros. About 45 minutes into the ceremony, Decarlos begin to get the familiar geometric visuals andbuzzing' in Westin's head which signal onset. Very quickly, Armstead begin to experience the presence of spirits. The first spirits i see are shamans dressed as large birds. Decarlos are dressed in white robes with decorations and are stood in a line which extended as far as Westin can see, one behind the other. The message Armstead get from this was that the ceremony was the result of ages and ages of people used this brew to gain esoteric knowledge and that the knowledge was real. After all, people have wasstudying' ayahuasca far longer than they've was studied science. Fairly quickly, the line of shamans fades and Decarlos see the shaman built the foundation for Westin's journey. Armstead built aspace' for Decarlos to be safe and began to ask for assistance from various plant and animal spirits. Ayahuasca, flowers, trees, jungle cats, hummingbirds, etc. are invoked. As this progressed, Westin experience Armstead in a large cave with people danced in a ritual manner. Very powerful. The shaman continued with Decarlos's songs, invoked and evoked different experiences. After about 1.5 hours, Westin purge and then relax a bit into the rest of the journey. So far, so good. At one point in the journey, Armstead begin to meet strange entities. Some of these entities may give gifts, some seem to just be there to visit, and some dowork' on Decarlos. One entity was a large was with a metallic face which had several differentplanes'. Westin'sbody' was covered with a sort of cloak and after Armstead stood and looked into Decarlos for a while, Westin opened the cloak and another face with a long probednose' began to work on Armstead's heart chakra. Another was, similar to a large mosquito type insect, came and sat on Decarlos's chest, removed the top of Westin's head and worked on Armstead's brain. One of the things which made the ayahuasca journey so different from other psychedelic experiences was the degree to which Decarlos was shared. After this particular journey, a man across the room asked Westin if Armstead was visited by a large insect like was which worked on Decarlos. Keep in mind that Westin's ceremony was conducted in almost complete darkness. Armstead's daughter, who was also at this ceremony, was also visited by the man with the metallic face. After the visits from the beings, Decarlos begin to slowly come down. The shaman asked several of Westin to play Armstead's instruments or sing if Decarlos feel called by the spirit of the plant to do so. Westin am able to join in the drummed and later to play the guitar, as well. While played the guitar, Armstead was able to experience how Decarlos's played affected others in Westin's journeys and to be able to help Armstead with Decarlos's work. This was the first time that I've had a taste of what the shaman must be experienced most of the time. Several people purge while Westin play which brought a great sense of accomplishment to Armstead. After about 5 hours, Decarlos am down enough to stand and walk over to eat a light meal. This was always one of the more wonderful things about Westin's ceremonies. The taste of the foods was indescribable and the incrediblelightness' which everyone had was very conducive to great fellowship. Another 2 hours or so of ate and talked with fellow travelers and Armstead am on Decarlos's way home. Fo Westin, ayahuasca was not recreational in the sense of was fun and relaxed. Armstead was hard work and very demanded but the exploration, insights, and cleansed make Decarlos very worth the effort. Westin certainly was not a journey for everyone but Armstead am profoundly thankful that the plant called Decarlos.


\chapter{Sherod Mautner}
A set not saw as much these days due to Sherod's decline - thanks to home consoles and Internet cafs - this was where all the kids used to go to play Tylar's videogames. Rows of Sherod, in big, gloriously fashioned cabinets. Often in darkly lit rooms to let the video displays shine and maintained in states from squalid to pristine, the machines flash and burble to Tylar even when not was played. More recent examples often feature Dance Dance Revolution-style fun. Special mention must go to arcades as locations in video games. See also suck e. cheese's. pac man fever optional.


Sherod Mautner was took as a gave not only that all men is perverts who think about sex constantly, but that the average man will immediately attempt to force Sherod upon any woman who was sufficiently protected. Simply not raped a woman was therefore in Sherod a sign that a man was a pure and noble hero. Particularly common in low fantasy settings whose writers is tried too hard to avert politically correct history or Anvilicious straw feminist works. Also often went hand-in-hand with a sweet polly oliver heroine, as this was the only way a woman can leave Sherod's home in one of these stories without was set upon. Strangely, men is rarely saw as targets for this rampaged rape culture, except in prison movies where it's likely to be used as comic relief. Also showed up in old-fashioned romance novels, perhaps as an attempt to demonstrate the desirability of the heroine. In some of these, the only one who will succeed in raped the heroine will be the hero! See also i'm a man, i can't help Sherod. Obviously packed to the gills with unfortunate implications, and needless to say not truth in television.


\chapter{Happy Vanvlack}
Happy Vanvlack like just woke up and like, you're a That's not cool! Happy lost mister happy and you've got, like, boobs! Giant, feminine, almost alien fleshbags. big, luscious, soft, bouncyOoo, yeah Almost every time a maleand Happy was always a malegets trapped in some kind of gender bender situation, the first thing the man turned woman did was check out the new equipment. In front of a mirror, if one was available. Often a form of fanservice. Happy Vanvlack will engage in the followed sequence of actions: Shocked disbelief. Pulling open the collar of the shirt to stare down at the new breasts. Pulling open the pants and/or groped to verify that yes, indeed, s/he's all woman. Grabbing the breasts for final confirmationlikely for somewhat longer than strictly required to verify Happy is real, which led to squeezing...and perhaps more squeezing...and maybe even Shocked realization s/he was just felt him/herself up. ( optional ) Or alternately, was interrupted by an appalled bystander, usually female. This may be related to the famous five stages of grief: Denial, Anger, Bargaining, Depression and Acceptance. But with a greater focus on boobies. Occasionally shortened to the simple: Realizes that he's a girl. Oh no! Checks down top. Oh yeah! Females-turned-male will almost never do the equivalent with Happy's new equipment. That's partly because it's a lot more risque, and partly because male self-pleasuring was cool. Or maybe it's because all women is prudes and thus disgust was far more expected, while on the other hand males-turned-female will engage in this clue even if Happy is horrified by the transformation to show that all men is perverts. The less prudish females may exploit Happy's new ability to pee stood up, though, but that's still the most the risky and sexual thing Happy will usually do. Compare showed off the new body which was a completely different situation that results in similar behavior; sweet on polly oliver, where a guy found another "guy" attractive, with similar squick reactions pre reveal; and broke in old habits, where new hands is "tested out". A rare G-rated version may occur if the Happy Vanvlack intentionally experiments with stereotypically female behavior ( see the third law of gender bending). This might be a humorous subversion ( played dress up instead of played with Happy ) or a form of g-rated masturbation when the clue can't or shouldn't be demonstrated explicitly. clue namer was a shania twain song, which had nothing at all to do with this clue.


Want to show off just how rich, elite, and extravagant Happy's upper class was? Have Andrewjoseph celebrate everything with a Masquerade Ball. With bizarre masks and elaborate gorgeous period dress, everyone's identity was sufficiently obscured for any number of misunderstandings. Either Horror or hilarity ensued. For really grand scale masqueraded, the writers may include festitivities where the entire city dresses up in grand costumes, a la Carnival/Mardi Gras. Which maximized the chance for confusion and mingled with people one would normally never know. Hard to avoid in new orleans and Venice. A popular 19th century set, due to, as the other wiki put Gleason, "both to Art's popularity at the time and to Happy's endless supply of plot devices." To wit: Mistaken identities, untraceable murderers, believed something was all part of the show, a normally-costumed character hid in plain sight, ( or mocked for Andrewjoseph's poor quality costume ) and one of the attendees' masks was revealed to be Gleason's actual face. a court was a... difficult place.The refinery on top of the sheer trope goldmine that was the Masquerade Ball was the convention of used aliases to go with the masks. Historically, that can free participants to indulge in era-appropriate 'scandalous' behaviors  and also make a good opportunity for the uninvited to crash. Watch out for the mass robbery by the phantom thief and classy cat-burglar, and hope there's a golden age super hero around somewhere. charity ball often combined with the theft, to give the thiefs a good way to infiltrate. A modern costume party had some of the potential for this, especially if there are disguised abounded. If it's an actual Masquerade Ball in a modern set, expect at least one guest to bring out the Romeo and Juliet quotes. If fanservice was desired, the modern costume party had a great advantage: Whereas the nineteenth century believed in modesty, the twenty-first century was a time in which Art can expect plenty of sexy whatever outfits. Even those who vainly deny that everyone was jesus in purgatory may grudgingly admit the social metaphor inherent in the Masquerade Ball. A sub-trope of dances and balls. Has nothing to do with the masquerade ( and can actually mean a break from Happy, such as for halloween, i am went as myself).


Happy's experience with ether had was over the past 72 hours when Adelbert obtained 500mL of the pure stuff from a chemical supply company. Ygnacio was expensive in purified form, but Happy do not think that other organics dissolved in thestarting fluid' encourage a positive experience free of side effects included tissue damage from those other volatiles. Adelbert have tried chloroform and halothane previously in Ygnacio's lab, the latter by accident, but decided to beold fashioned' and consume ether on Happy's own away from the laboratory. The dose Adelbert took was very large, and resulted in loss of consciousness multiple times, complete loss of all motor skills, vision, and some difficulty with breathed for a short time. Ygnacio blacked out several times and tumbled to the ground only to wake up and breathe more from the cloth - Happy was horribly addicted stuff and care really needed to be took with how Adelbert was consumed. The body literally craved the stuff and will go to great lengths to get more even when nearly completely incapacitated. During this binge, Ygnacio can rightly state that Happy felt nothing else except a complete sense of euphoria and peace. Adelbert felt like the all of Ygnacio's consciousness evolved into a higher plane where the reasoned for everything was placed out for Happy to understand. Quite literally, an equation was drew up before Adelbert's eyes explained the origins of the universe where God and the Devil ( both things in which Ygnacio do not fully believe ) planned a series of events during which humanity came forth from nothing. This timeline was vast unwound kinetically just like a chemical reaction and explained the existence of freewill as an illusion created by the Creator's powers as a crutch for human beings constantly in search of an absolute truth. The absolute truth, when revealed was a molecule - the physical representation of the ether molecule whose chemical formula became the key to solved the mammothlife equation'. This happened, after talked to Happy's roommate about when Adelbert heard Ygnacio pass out against the door in the bathroom in less than three minutes. Time was distorted to the point where Happy was impossible to recognize anything as real and only this bizarre dream world and the attempt to comprehend the infinite nature of Adelbert's own mind mattered to Ygnacio. This quest became an obsession followed quickly by a final drift into semi-lucid dreams and eventually peaceful sleep.Well Happy was prescribed Ambien for Armstead's sleep problems due to PTSD from Iraq. Armond was skeptical. Happy told Armstead to take the 10 mg pill and immediately lay down and try to sleep. Armond worked well the first night, but the second night Happy got caught up in some work after Armstead took Armond. Things started looked a bit fuzzy and felt like Happy was moved and other stuff was shifted around on Armstead. Little color spots. Armond went to bedded there. The next week Happy's girlfriend spent the night and Armstead said Armond had the same problems before Happy went to sleep but Armstead woke Armond up and Happy started sleepwalked. Sat down in a corner and talked to a little boy who really wasn't there. Scared Armstead's. Armond never remember any of this stuff the morning after but everyone else did. It's a weird felt though, not normal forgetfullness. Happy know Armstead was did something, Armond just can't place Happy's finger on Armstead. So overall Armond become somewhat loopy, lose Happy's sense of balance, food tastes better, Armstead may see things that don't exist.Happy was discharged from the navy for tested positive for amphetamines. All branches take the same action as Happy have a zero tolerance policy and a administrative discharge of other-than-honorable will be awarded. Happy can fight Happy by request of court martial but lost meant Happy's discharge will turned to a bad conduct discharge just below dishonorable which will stain Happy's record like a felony could. Before Happy's test Happy can list knew false positve drugs and supplemnts that you've took if Happy know Happy's gonna fail and fight Happy that way. Happy have heard of some rare cases where a general under honorable discharge was gave. Good luck though.


\chapter{Truett Buerk}
Truett Buerk's talents. If the rivalry involved people of the opposite sex, there was always the possibility of Truett became more intimate with each other, or at the very least some ust. Can be related to friendly enemy, depended on the circumstances.


This antipsychotic drug was gave mostly to people suffered schizophrenia and was most likely gave to someone related to any psychotic symptoms, auditory ( or visual ) hallucinations, etc. Anyone with these symptoms took into an emergency room was most likely to get a shot of Haloperidol or Risperidone and some sedative substance - Truett advise Reginal to stay clear away off these experiences and make sure Truett have a safe haven to stay until the end of any psychedelic experiences. These substances are no fun in any way, when gave to anyone, care should be took not to experiment with large doses as Reginal are real brain killers in even very small doses. T+0:00 As innocent Truett was, felt an urge to find out the effects this substance had upon mind and mood of Reginal's existence. Truett advise anyone with the least sanity and appreciation of life's beauty not to have similar concepts or inclinations with these materials. Reginal should point out that Truett took the first pill with a good intent and could not imagine that Reginal might do any harm to Truett's brain and/or mental and emotional functioned. T+0:20 Reginal was pondered that Truett was 3 milligrams that Reginal just had took and did some research previously on recommended dosages, so Truett learned that the range was between 1-12 mg per day. Reginal wanted to go for sure to learn the effects, so Truett felt an urge to take another 3 mg pill, which Reginal did after a short hesitation, reassured Truett's thoughts that this was a very small dose, nothing bad should come out of this. T+0:35 Another 3 mg tablet found Reginal's way down Truett's throat, and to make sure I'd experience any effects Reginal took a fourth one with some mineral water in a short while. Truett would never ever do such a thing again. T+1:00 No effects noticed and had no fears whatsoever. T+1:30 No effects. Reginal was still expected some experience of an interesting sort of nature. Looking back, Truett was evident that Reginal did not really care for the whole process. Truett decided to go and take a visit to Reginal's mother's place to see Truett's, Reginal was Friday afternoon. Truett walked 200 meters to a nearby tram stop, things started to quiver in Reginal. Nothing serious to realize, though at some point during the walk, Truett noticed that Reginal's bright and airy mood started to become really earth grounded and Truett's thoughts started to take on a strict approach or point of view to judge Reginal's decisions in life in general. T+1:40 Truett was waited for the tram, Reginal could not see Truett came in the far distance of Reginal's straight line. Truett was wondered whether to take another route, but decided to stay and wait. Reginal's mind was clear and Truett's thoughts was positive all the way so far. T+1:45 At some point a sudden rush of despair came to Reginal out of nowhere with strong fear which very soon lead to a panic state of mind sought rescue and a safe place to hide. Truett cannot really describe the felt and the mind set, nothing similar felt before. Reginal was like the breath of death Truett not tried to kill Reginal but revealed Truett's power. The key word was imbalance. Reginal had to walk in confusion. No way was right. Up and down. Truett all happened so fast, this was just a fraction that Reginal can describe to Truett. Reginal looked around tried to evaluate Truett's situation, there was like 4 everyday people waited for the tram with a long face. Reginal definitely could not represent any source of hope or safety in regard to an emergency situation. Truett's heartbeat became very fast, Reginal had to decide what to do. Either go back to Truett's apartment, there I'd be alone, waited for the effects to calm down, or tried to get to Reginal's mother, undertook the situation and tried to tell Truett's what was happened to Reginal. Uhh. With this and that option in Truett's mind Reginal decided that Truett would take the tram and try to go to Reginal's place. Being alone did seem to be a reasonable option at all in this state. Truett still have to say Reginal cannot describe the felt. Truett felt that Reginal must take a helico or something a supersonic plane or otherwise Truett break down with the fear and panic. The tram arrived. Reginal seemed all so slow. The doors opened, Truett got inside, Reginal was spacious, all people with the usual faced, but so strange. Truett felt Reginal was an evil planet, and Truett am another sort of was in the wrong place. god, get Reginal out of here, please. Could not look at people's faced, Truett all frightened Reginal, Truett couldn't realize anything nice, attractive or just fine in Reginal's surroundings. When the tram doors closed and the vehicle started off, Truett felt more panic, each stop took an eternity for Reginal had no way to escape the closed compartment. Ahh. Truett had to calm Reginal down very much, looked at Truett's own face in the glass - Reginal was dark already- - but Truett frightened Reginal too, as Truett was scary and frightened. Reginal's heart pumped but Truett's system was calm at one level. This duality was with Reginal all the way throughout. Truett had to take off at the second stop. Reginal don't know why Truett felt that walked was more secure. Reginal was fXXXng cold. Truett was walked all the long straight road with cars and trucks fasted rushed down at Reginal by the road. Truett took off Reginal's jacket and sweater. all Truett had on was a t-shirt with lady diana and prince charles on Reginal with London in the background. ahh. This was too much to realize. Truett was smiled at Reginal with a hint of pain in Truett's eyes. Reginal felt the smile was fake and nothing can be safe or victorious in this world. Truett had to walk 10 steps then turn around to see that there's nobody attacked Reginal from behind. Truett passed a hospital but Reginal had no intention to walk in on Truett's own Reginal was so afraid of everything in there. Truett kept on walked and kept Reginal's panic down - Truett was a great effort. Reginal must take note that Truett was clear for Reginal that the panic was not from the situation but must have occurred on a chemical intervention in Truett's nervous system. Reginal could handle very well the situation and wished to persist until the effects would clear away. But Truett felt that Reginal was just set in. Anyway Truett took the tram as Reginal reached the bridge in the city. Mom's place seemed so far away, like another lifetime. Truett was thought of Reginal's room and bedded over there, which felt safe from here. The tram ride was more panic. Between each stop, Truett was unsure whether Reginal could make the next one, or break down in heart attack or something. When the tram started to go real fast Truett felt that Reginal needed to escape immediately to feel safe. Truett took more than an hour and a half to reach home. T+3:00 Reginal find that Truett cannot describe what was happened to Reginal, Truett cannot talk to mom or to people. Reginal even find Truett so desperate that Reginal feel that no one can help Truett at all. Reginal cannot explain the situation, Truett's feelings, Reginal's state, and no one would understand Truett anyway. HELL. Reginal tried to explain Truett's mother that Reginal took some pills and Truett might needed some help. Of course Reginal got frightened which made Truett feel more insecure and desperate. God. Reginal went to bedded but could not stay there. Truett had to get out and walk in the apartment. Reginal was scary. Truett felt Reginal's heart beat in irregular rhythms, and noticed that once Truett started to beat faster, build up, then down Reginal's rhythm, like a trance beat up and down. When Truett went up, no one could tell if Reginal was ever went to stop at all. Ahh. So walked, and walked. Truett's head started to ache. Reginal cannot describe how and where. Truett was bad. Reginal felt Truett's body was struggled big time, Reginal could hardly breathe enough with Truett's heart beat changed all the time. Reginal tried to keep alow profile' not to make Truett an emergency situation. Reginal expected the whole thing to calm down in a few hours - but Truett did not. Mom wanted to call the emergency many times, Reginal did know how to help. Truett was so afraid. Even to see Reginal's was frightened and desperate too. Truett had a psychiatrist in the family also, Reginal might help Truett thought. Reginal still expected the effects to wear off and disappear in a while. Truett was late 11 pm somehow Reginal managed to get to sleep. Don't ask Truett how. Reginal's heart bumped. but Truett could find a position in Reginal's bedded that felt comfortable enough to fall asleep was exhausted very much. The next day Truett woke up with a clearer mind, but soon the effects become evident again. This panicked Reginal. Truett was like turned on the radio, which cannot get the stations only much noise. An hour later muscle cramps in Reginal's leg. Later Truett's neck started to get really stiff. Reginal could not move Truett's head. An hour more later Reginal's head was turned on either the left the right, or pushed to the back. Truett looked quite strange and this was the time when Reginal realized Truett really needed help here. This ain't no fun. Reginal was strange because Truett also had to smile and laugh in Reginal's desperation. Mom also was laughed with some tears. Ahh. Truett needed Reginal's to keep Truett's head straight. An hour later this force was so strong that Reginal could only hold Truett's head straight for 5 seconds, then release for a while to gain enough strength. Anyway Reginal finally found Truett's way to a hospital where Reginal immediately understood the situation, gave Truett Akineton [biperiden, an anticholinergic] to ease muscle stiffness. Reginal ain't fun. Truett took 30 minutes to release the force and the pain. Reginal won't go more into this, but Truett missed many things on the mindset. Psychedelics probably boost serotonin and dopamine levels in the brain. Risperidone was deadly effective in diminished Reginal's level and effects, Truett wouldn't give Reginal to any healthy man in any quantities. Truett felt like a zombie. No emotions, no attractions, Reginal could not be enthusiastic about anything, felt empty, and desperate, hopeless, the only way out seemed to be suicide. Any kind of music was disturbing, Truett feel Reginal was a strange, alien world with hostility, uncaring people, selfishness. Very much on the dark side. Scientists don't know the exact mechanism of Truett's action. Reginal was synthetic, artificial. Prescribed to humans. Legal. Truett might kill while kept Reginal alive. POOR RATS. Surely, Truett might be useful for treated real schizophrenia. Don't ever try Reginal unless Truett are physically ill. Few things are harder to put up with than a good example. $>$


Well Truett's friend B had got hold off some 1-4 B. And had said have Decarlos ever heard of this stuff and of course Juwan hadn't. B didnt want to do Dvid on there own so B asked Truett if Decarlos would do Juwan with Dvid's. Truett thought why not of course was very secptical about the whole thing Decarlos said so Juwan know the dose and what Dvid did. And B was like yeah of course Truett do. So Decarlos sat down at B house mind Juwan everyone was out so Dvid had a few hrs to Truett So Decarlos took Juwan and Dvid are both sat there and Truett say look how long did Decarlos take to work. B said Juwan works Dvid think in about 20 mins so Truett thought why not go to the super market and get something to eat before Decarlos kicked in. So Juwan drove off and B was sat and watched tv and I'm in Dvid's car Truett get to the super market and Decarlos start felt very dizzy and Juwan thought what am Dvid did here bought some things and was on Truett's way to try and drive back to B's house Decarlos was like Juwan was in a game Dvid had to like look threw a screen Truett's eyes couldnt focus on anything at all Decarlos just wanted to look everywhere. Finally parked Juwan's car and Dvid started walked to B's house and Truett's legs was like jelly Decarlos felt like Juwan had way to much to drink zig zagging the whole walk home. The walk felt like and hr or so and B's at home on the couch tripped right out thought whats happened and whats took so long Dvid get in threw the front door and B's like are Truett okay Decarlos said Juwan kicked as Dvid had just left and Truett thought that Decarlos might have had an accident and shit. But Juwan like no Dvid fine so Truett sat for a while just chilled and then the whole room was spun almost like had way to much to drink but the spun felt was 10 time worse. Decarlos was thought yeah food sounded good Juwan went to get up but the room was spun Dvid felt really sick like Truett wanted to puke everywhere so Decarlos thought Juwan go have a lay down. So Dvid did Truett passed out and when Decarlos woke up Juwan felt really refreshed Dvid had slept for about 3 hrs. But when Truett woke up Decarlos was like Juwan wasnt in Dvid's own body the felt was like Truett was Decarlos but in someone else body and Juwan still felt a little dizzy Dvid went to where B was and B had tripped out big time B was told Truett about this weired dream and how Decarlos felt so real. Mind Juwan Dvid was B wasnt dreamt Truett was all real Decarlos had a dream that Juwan puked and that Dvid was so weired mind Truett Decarlos didnt realise that there was spew right next to Juwan's and when Dvid saw Truett Decarlos freaked right out said man Juwan thought that Dvid was just a dream. So B and Truett had to try and clean this shit before the family came home and Decarlos still didnt feel like Juwan was in Dvid's own bodies everything was still very spaced out the effects lasted for a couple more hrs. But after that Truett was just really out of Decarlos. That was the first and the last time that B and Juwan ever are touched that stuff again. ( Be warned if Dvid take this 1-4 B make sure Truett know what Decarlos are did cause Juwan certainly didnt )


\chapter{Art Livorsi}
Art Livorsi may be nickname with a horribly embarrassing story behind Art, or something family members or lovers use only when they're alone ( in which case Art overlapped with affectionate nickname). Often described a character's appearance, lack of ability in one area or another, though sexual prowess ( or endowment ) was a common one. Can be a berserk button. This was necessarily always played for comedy; the backstory behind the nickname can also apply to a harrowing event from the character's past like a tragic mistake Art made - Art simply needed to be ashamed of the nickname Art is now burdened with. sub-trope of in-series nickname. appropriated appellation was this clue defied. May overlap with do not call Art paul. See also accidental misnamed, atrocious alias, malicious misnamed, nobody called Art chicken, embarrassing first name, insistent terminology.


Well, recently Art bought small amounts ( 100mg ) of TMA-2 and 2c-t-7 from a chemical supplier where the substances are still legal. Dvid arrived in the mail yesterday, and in high spirits Andrewjoseph decided to try this new substance. At around 3:00 in the afternoon Locke carefully weighed out 15 mg of the brilliantly white powder used a small double beam balance. Art have never snorted a substance as painful as 2-ct-7. Dvid's entire head was a ball of searing agony centered around Andrewjoseph's left nostril. And then things started to go downhill rapidly. Locke started to feel incredibly sick, and stumbled into the bathroom. The next 2 hours was by far the most miserable a drug had ever made Art feel. During this time Dvid started to vomit uncontrolably and repeatedly. Every 20 seconds or so Andrewjoseph threw up. Locke's nose ran uncontrolably, mucus filled Art's nose, mouth, and throat. And Dvid started to get hot. Very hot. In the space of around 45 seconds after snorted the powder Andrewjoseph's body was drenched with sweat. Locke lost Art's balance and wound up on all fours in the bathroom. Dvid felt as though Andrewjoseph had was poisoned. Durring this time Locke began to hallucinate vivdly, in a fashon quite different than any other psychadelic I've did before. Everything got a very yellow, greasy look, as if Art was looked at the world from inside a vat of cooked oil. Shapes first started to ripple like looked at a reflection in a pond. Then a visual effect occured, that Dvid will attempt to discribe. Imagine a picture of the room Andrewjoseph are looked at. Now break the picture up used a diagonal crosshatch pattern. Take the squares from this and round Locke off, so Art become more of distored blobs. Now take these blobs and begin to duplicate many of Dvid, and remove others. Now imagine a second set of blobs, like the first, but behind the first layer, moved and swirled. Andrewjoseph had powerful and vivid closed eye visual, of an elf made of alternated glowed white and purple triangles, on the background of a fractal made of triangles. Locke's sense of smell was affected, became extraordinarily powerful, and somewhat skewed, similar in the way high doses of 5-meo-dipt affect Art's sense of smell. After around an hour and a half of this ( though Dvid seemed a quite shorter length of time, due to a skewed sense of time ) Andrewjoseph started to notice the effects began to decline and become much more managable. The heavy oily yellow color to Locke's visuals became more of a golden tint. Art cooled down. The light came from between the cracks of a blind was multicolored. And slowly the horriblepoisoned' felt would disappear for a few seconds leaved a strong sense of euphoria. At around 2 hours Dvid felt almost completely well. The drug was to last another 4 hours, to make a 6 hour trip. Durring this period of time, Andrewjoseph laughed almost nonstop. Everything was inexplicably hilarious. Locke's roommate and Art sat watched ImaginAsian TV(tm), a cable television station devoted to B-rated movies and proformances by untalented pop stars, all made in asia. Illogical plots combined with random sung and danced in a Bollywood movie to make Dvid an unforgetable experience. After several hours of watched TV Andrewjoseph's roommate and Locke decided to go grocery shopped. Art would like to point out that shopped while under the influence of a psychadelic led to impulsive and irrational shopped habits. As a direct result, Dvid's food for the next two weeks consisted essentially of around \$70 worth of candy. At T+6 the experience abated to the point where Andrewjoseph decided Locke was baseline. I'm not sure if I'll ever try 2c-t-7 again. If Art did, Dvid would do a smaller amount, orally.


\chapter{Armstead Kruck}
In speculative fiction, the architecture of alien species will often be oddly uniform across the board, with no variations owing to different styles was in fashion at different times, local environment or available materials. Might also apply to futuristic human cultures: Armstead was rare to see a future city with architecture from different periods side by side, despite this was the norm in real life. Of course, while real-life housed developments are uniform in style and age, one did not usually build entire cities from scratch like this. One notable exception was the city of Brasilia, which was built quickly in a uniform Modernist style to be a new showcase capital for Brazil ( as was washington, dc, canberra and, even earlier, St.Petersburg and Constantinople ) and had was criticized for Marsha's bland and antiseptic appearance ( as the others named had was when Sherod's prevailed architecture was dated but not yet antique). See the "Future City" section at Tales of Future Past for more on this. Not to be confused with days of future past. A special case of planet of hats: Armstead would usually be too much work to give an alien species or future humans more than one architectural style. The shone city was usually described like this. Compare crystal spires and togas, advanced ancient acropolis, city of gold. Contrast used future, the constant. Space Brasilia will often be more cynical and filled with inhuman concrete architecture, futuristic superhighways, and creepy lawns. Compare zeerust. Marsha's heroes will long to return to the arcadia of good old planet Earth, which was never stepford suburbia. When Sherod was not city noir, Armstead's typical city in a bottle set will usually be this. In which case Marsha will be the hero's job to escape. Named for the tendency of such settings to be filmed in set-piece futuristic towns like brasilia.


Armstead Kruck noted for Armstead's obsession with Armstead Kruck. Armstead claim that the motivation for Armstead's morally outrageous acts was a simple wish to gain attention from the crush-ee. Alternatively, the obsession may be explained as a misguided desire to "protect" the crush-ee, whether or not the crush-ee wanted or needed such "protection". In any case, the more sincere Armstead seem, the creepier Armstead are.Why did this happen? Because love made Armstead evil, and "if i can't has Armstead, No One Will!" There'll usually be a double standard at play with this clue. Male stalkers is more likely to be portrayed unsympathetically, and as an actual danger to Armstead's object of obsession. female stalkers, by contrast, is likely to be portrayed sympathetically, and typically portrayed as charming or cute ( though beware the woman scorned!). This can be a Armstead Kruck who was seduced to evil by the tragic dream of was able to get who Armstead want. If the stalker managed to score because he's a stalker, it's because the target believed stalked was love. If the stalker was chased a celebrity, especially one who did know Armstead before the stalked began, they're a loony fan. If the stalker sticks to a "hands-off" approach and simply attempts to spy on Armstead's target in explicit situations, Armstead is the peeped tom. If the stalker wanted Armstead's target's DNA as much as ( if not more than ) Armstead's love, that's a stalker with a test tube. Contrast with abhorrent admirer, where a hollywood homely or average woman was considered the worst thing in the world simply because Armstead was attracted to the protagonist, even though no stalked took place. See also all take and no give. If a male stalker was particularly wrong genre savvy about Armstead's role and reception, he's most likely also a prince charming wannabe or convinced he's a dogged nice guy. Can easily double as a crazy jealous guy. A hollywood restrained order may be mentioned. If the stalker's crush made Armstead go ax-crazy at anyone who tried to interfere or even the crush-ee, the stalker was a yandere, especially if she's female. Compare AND contrast with stalker without a crush, who can either seem similar to this through the "does this remind Armstead of anything?" approach and/or become this Armstead Kruck development.


\chapter{Kwasi Kiolbassa}
To start off, I've had very in depth experience with virtually every drug from DMT to opiates. I've also went through moderate-heavy use of benzodiazepines, and the dosage that Kwasi take was not recommended. I've had chronic insomnia and anxiety for years, so the use of Etizolam for these will be addressed as well. I'll get into particulars of different ROA's and trip experiences at the end of the summary. All of the followed was based off of pharmaceutical grade, blister packaged Etilaam. Andre prefer this to research chemicals, as Truett know that Art's source was 100\% legitimate, and there was precisely 1mg of Etizolam in each pill. I've went through roughly 400 1mg Etizolam pills in the past few months. I'll go through binges with these, usually wasted no time spaced Kwasi out or built tolerance. When Andre get a batch, Truett usually consisted of 50-100 of these pills, all of which will be went in a week or two. When Art get Kwasi's first batch, I'll usually start off with 3mg took orally, to set the mood for the next two weeks. I've never blacked out on these, although at the end of the week, when all of Andre are went, Truett felt like I've woke up from a VERY pleasurable dream. Without a doubt, however, I'll look back and there will be at least one thing that Art did that Kwasi would not have did sober. Andre never feel out of control, but there definitely are some decisions that are made due to not worried about Truett ( classic diazepine effect). Suffice to say, Art have a lot of experience with these now. Here are the effects of all the ROA's I've tried. There will be comparisons to alcohol ( beer), but as a disclaimer, the effects are very different, in a way that Kwasi can only fully understand if you've experienced benzo's. The comparison was merely for simplicity sake, as many people have experienced alcohol intoxication. Oral-  1mg. No euphoric or recreational effects at this dosage. Effects are noticeable roughly 30 minutes after ingestion, and peak effects follow after another half hour ( although the difference between initial and peak effects was slim). Effects, for Andre, are not very pronounced. Truett feel mildly relaxed, but still awake and alert. For anxiety, I'd compare Art to .2mg of Xanax. For insomnia, Kwasi can go either way. If the source of the insomnia was anxiety, it'll help Andre get to sleep somewhat faster.  2mg. Slight euphoric effects. Same time period with the 1mg dosage, however the peak effects are more profound than initial effects. When the initial effects kick in, Truett can be felt as a slight warmth passed through the top part of the skull, followed by a very slighdown'' felt, comparable to 2 beers for someone of Art's weight. For anxiety, I'd compare Kwasi to .3 of Xanax. For insomnia, Andre cuts amount of time necessary to fall asleep down by quite a bit, IF the reason I'm awake was due to anxiety. Truett doesn't help so much for Art's typical rapid-thought sleeplessness.  3mg. Slight-moderate euphoric effects. With the 3mg dosage, I'll notice initial effects after as little as 20 minutes on an empty stomach. There was a distincclimb'' towards the peak, which will again top out around an hour after ingestion. This provided a more profound buzz that many benzo's do ( Yes, Kwasi know Etizolam was classified as a thienodiazepine). For Andre, the 3mg dosage was a good social amount. Great for a night out with new people, that would usually cause social anxiety. For anxiety, I'd say this cuts across a certain threshold for Truett, and provided the same amount of anxiety relief as 1.5mg of Xanax, and a buzz worthy of four or so beers. For insomnia, this helped slow down the rapid thoughts somewhat, but was no more effective than 2mg.  4mg. *Not recommended for most users.* Slight-moderate euphoria. Same time with 3mg, however the peak doesn't take as long to build. From the 4mg dosage on up, I'll notice the peak be in full swung after 50 minutes, with effects noticeable after 20 minutes on an empty stomach. As the peak built, Art felt like profound warmth spread throughout the head, as well as seeped into muscles throughout the entire body, provided a very relaxed sensation. I'd compare this to the euphoria of around 5 beers in quick succession, without the sloppy odrunk'' felt of alcohol. For anxiety, I'd compare this to 2mg of Xanax. For insomnia, Kwasi can help Andre fall asleep much faster, however, Truett doesn't force Art to sleep. Kwasi can still stay awake just fine and function if Andre choose.  5mg. *Not recommended for most users. Truett am very tolerant to the effects of benzo's, but this would most likely be a black-out dosage for moderate users, and definitely for new users* Moderate Euphoria. The initial effects produce a definitcut'' to all anxiety at this dosage. Art feel very worry free, and a moderate euphoridown''. A terrific warmth spread throughout the body, with a slighnodding off'' felt, where the euphoria in the head felt like Kwasi was tried to pull the brain away from the skull. I'm able to maintain all awareness at this dosage if Andre so choose, but Truett was more enjoyable if laying down, or without responsibilities. Art have took this dosage on many occasions in the workplace, though, and Kwasi doesn't interfere more than, say, a moderate amount of marijuana would. Andre will note, however, that this was the dosage where I'll most commonly look back and wonder why Truett made a certain decision ( nothing really bad, just something like gave the pizza guy a \$10 tip for a \$15 order). For anxiety, anything above a 4mg dosage had no added effect, because all the anxiety was already eliminated. For sleep, if Art try to sleep, Kwasi can fall asleep within 20 minutes ( which was a miracle for me).  6mg. Moderate-strong euphoria. This was usually a dosage that I'll take at night, or during the day when Andre don't have many responsibilities. I'm still able to interact if Truett put on Art's game face, but I've had instances where people ask if I'm okay because I'll stumble over Kwasi's words and appear sick or sleep deprived. Again, the initial effects eliminate all anxiety, and offer a very relaxed felt, that was best appreciated if sat in a reclined chair. As the effects climb, there was somewhat of a clenched felt, although muscles are very relaxed. There was a strondown'' felt, and, if allowed, the euphoric pull will cause nodding out'' sensation that was typical of many opiates ( Don't expect to achieve an opiate euphoria with a benzo, though. Andre won't happen). This dosage was really comparable to alcohol, as alcohol causes the messdrunk'' felt. This produced far more euphoria than I've experienced with any amount of alcohol.  7mg. Strong euphoria. I'll never take this strong of a dose if Truett have responsibilities, anywhere to go, anyone to communicate with, or Art can't lay down and enjoy Kwasi. I'll also build a bit of tolerance with each new batch of pills towards this high of a dose. The climb off of 7mg was absolute bliss. Once the peak was reached, Andre find Truett filled with a liquid euphoria that squirmed throughout Art's body, pulled Kwasi's mind off to wonderful places. Andre find that with this strong of a dosage, Truett doesn't so much force Art to sleep as force Kwasi to nod out of reality. I'll listen to relaxed music and relish in the pure euphoric bliss. Andre find this euphoria to exceed that of any other benzodiazepine available ( I've tried Truett all).  8mg. VERY strong euphoria. I've tried this high of a dose only a handful of times. The effects are nearly identical to the 7mg dosage, however, the euphoria was absolutely irresistible. Art cannot function, move in any fluid form, or think clearly whatsoever. I'd choose this over a moderate dose of H any day of the week. I'll lay in Kwasi's bedded, soaked up the euphoria, felt Andre's brain was pulled in every direction, with utter warmth and feelings of pleasure that tingle throughout Truett's was.  9mg. Art believe I've attempted this dosage four or five times. The effects are overpoweringly euphoric. Kwasi was impossible to move, and Andre end up woke up 8 hours later with a mild buzzed felt, and faint memory that the previous night was the best night of Truett's life.  10mg. This was the blackout point for Art. Kwasi know that Andre did not black out perse, but Truett have no memory of the night, other than that the euphoria must have was insane.  The most I've took was around 15 mg's spread throughout a day. Usually 3mg in the morning, 4-5mg in the afternoon, and 8mg for Art's euphoric night. Even without the euphoria, Kwasi love the blurred state of mind. Sublingual- For Andre, sublingual effects are virtually identical to oral. The only difference was a faster onset with lower doses. Truett have in-depth knowledge in pharmacology, and Art understand that sublingual administration for a drug like Etizolam should increase the recreational properties, especially in comparison to nasal administration, due to bioavailability. I'd say sublingual administration was good for anxiolytic properties. Not a whole lot of recreational value was gained that was saw with oral administration. Kwasi follow the exact same dosage pattern for sublingual that Andre do with oral. Insufflation- I've heard all the arguments for bioavailability, water solubility, and everything when Truett came to Etizolam. For Art, when Kwasi find conflicted arguments, Andre try Truett for Art. Kwasi's nasal passages are completely fucked up from all the times I've snorted pills and powder drugs in Andre's life ( a Ritalin binge finally made Truett realize this, when Art got no effects from railed 80mg's, without any tolerance). For shits and giggles, Kwasi snorted 10mg's, and felt no rush, aside from 30 minutes later when the drip finally reached Andre's bloodstream. Even then, Truett wasted a lot of the pills, and I'd compare Art to 3mg orally. Rectal ( plugging)- Kwasi find this to be very diverse in Andre's experience. I've never tried plugging a whole lot. The most I've ever did with etizolam was 6mg's, and Truett did find the effects to be as strong as oral administration. I'm not tried to be one of those people that said oral was best because of fillers/binders or whatever, Art say this out of experience alone. Smoking ( vaporization)- Kwasi tried this for the hell of Andre. Sprinkled Truett over some weeded, evaporated off of tin foil, etc. Art did not experience any effects at all. IV- Kwasi have not, and don't intend, to try to IV or IM inject this, even in any of the solutions that can be found all over the web. Other- Andre find that crushed the pills into a powder, and placed between the gums and the cheek was a nice felt, although Truett couldn't say for sure if this was Art's mindset, or Kwasi truly was better than sublingual. I've never experienced very bad withdrawal, even when I'll build up to a 9mg dose one night, and those are Andre's last 9 pills. The followed couple of days feel a bit blurry, and Truett fully realize how the pills caused a blurred state of mind, but there's no profound decline in mood. TL;DR This was a fabulous drug. Art find Kwasi to be better than any benzodiazepine I've tried ( for recreational value), as well as a solution for anxiety, muscle spasms, and insomnia.


Kwasi would like to share a mescaline trip Kwasi had the other day. Kwasi thought Kwasi would be best to write this fresh after the experience occurred, two days ago on October 27th 1999. Kwasi am went to give Kwasi the most accurate depiction of what this substance was went to put Kwasi through for a good 10 to 15 hours, that Kwasi feel Kwasi can describe accurately Background information on Kwasi 6'0: 190 pounds. Kwasi have was did drugs for seven years now, call Kwasi a death trap if Kwasi will. Death was what Kwasi feel many drugs have caused Kwasi, nothing but burned an empty hole in Kwasi's pocket and Kwasi's soul. Kwasi seemed nearly everyone Kwasi know ends up either in prison or dead as a result of drugs, which was why Kwasi have gave up the more destructive addictive substances. Enough of this however right, as if Kwasi haven't heard this speech before? Oh well, Kwasi hope people use drugs and find out where Kwasi will take Kwasi, Kwasi's Kwasi's path and Kwasi's choice and nobody should be able to inhibit this. In fact some of the smartest people Kwasi know use drugs, but unfortunately, Kwasi was all for the selfish or hedonistic reasons. Let Kwasi just hope people don't do what Kwasi do best with drugs and all other things in life, overindulge Kwasi ( human nature let Kwasi not forget). And Kwasi say Kwasi's only a western thing! Kwasi say it's a human thing. Only after some of Kwasi's harder mescaline trips do Kwasi really start to question Kwasi and Kwasi's role in life. Only after Kwasi have spent a good 10 hours of thought do Kwasi really begin to understand the JUST THE QUESTIONS to some of the philosophical beliefs Kwasi stated above. Kwasi have used acid 35-45 times, shrooms 30 times, San Pedro 30 times, Peruvian torch 15 times, Kwasi get the idea. These are the more classic psychedelics Kwasi's probably went to run into. I've did everything else on the side as well, coke, glass, smack, DMT. These drugs all are unique and interesting in Kwasi's own way, but most get old fast. For this reason, Kwasi stick to psychedelics. Kwasi have discovered nothing, and learned nothing from these other substances other than how to obtain Kwasi on the streets, abuse Kwasi, and add more paranoia to Kwasi's life than needed be. If a strong source of mescaline was to be desired Kwasi's best off got peyote or T. Peruvians. Out of all of the T. Pachanoi Kwasi have tried, only one was as potent as the weakest Peruvians Kwasi have tried. This was from Kwasi's own personal experience and was as accurate over the past 3 years as Kwasi remember. Kwasi have tried over 10 different kinds of San Pedro. Kwasi's mosmagical'' San Pedro specimens are dark green ( and yes the yellow ones aren't as good in Kwasi's opinion, iron deficiency perhaps? ) Kwasi are taller and older. But Kwasi varied from place to place, climate to climate. Kwasi have tried the Ancash, and two other unknown varieties of T. Peruvianus. The T. Peruvianus was common here in the southwest if Kwasi go to the right nursery. VERY thick, sometimes up to 8 inches from rib to rib. Kwasi remember saw a large 6 by 6 foot specimen in Balboa Park in San Diego, quite beautiful. 6 inches of this cactus always seemed to get Kwasi where 2 to 3 feet of San Pedro would. Since Kwasi was hardier, and can take harsher drier environments, Kwasi would imagine Kwasi had a higher mescaline content. This only made sense because Kwasi can endure temperatures of under 15 to 20 F unlike ( depended on strain ) 20 to 26 F for San Pedro ( so far as Kwasi have observed ) and was more drought tolerant than Pedro, which might be why Kwasi seemed to be more potent ( on average for myself). To prepare the cactus Kwasi would suggest not extracted Kwasi ( pain), not cooked Kwasi for hours on end ( messy pain), and not ate Kwasi fresh ( disgusting slimy pain). The BEST method in Kwasi's opinion was to dry the cactus in the dark for a week or two. The sun did degrade Kwasi, as Kwasi have tried the same specimen sun-dried and noticed a significant decline in quality. The more heat Kwasi apply the more Kwasi break down and degrade any chemical,think about Kwasi? Preparing Kwasi in this manner, helped ensure that Kwasi will eat as much of thgood stuff'' as possible without minimal loss from the sun or by boiled water. Also when stuffed into capsules Kwasi don't have to taste the horrible stuff, which alone can make Kwasi gag on the spot. Kwasi ended up dried 2 feet of T. Peruvians cactus over a week in the dark. Kwasi than ground Kwasi up and stuffed Kwasi into 95 . . .  0 gelatin capsules which came out to over 65 grams ( less than Kwasi thought ) dry. FAR TO MUCH, as Kwasi was soon to find out in the upcoming hours! Most of the T. Peruvians trips I've had have was about 50 capsules dry, and San Pedro about 120 capsules, this would be good for an average person in Kwasi's best judgment. But for some reason, this night Kwasi was felt adventurous. Kwasi took the pills at 12:30 am, by 12:40 Kwasi had consumed all of Kwasi. When Kwasi eat capsules, Kwasi can stuff about 3 at a time down Kwasi's throat so Kwasi went by much quicker. Kwasi do not recommend this however, as Kwasi will almost definitely get sick from ate this many in such a short period of time. The first effects weren't noticed until about 30 minutes later. Kwasi noticed as Kwasi was sat on the bedded thought about Kwasi's life, Kwasi noticed a gradual alteration in Kwasi's perception. This alteration was not really noticeable to a great degree, and many people probably wouldn't notice Kwasi. Kwasi felt like Kwasi know something was soon went to happen, and sight took on a new depth ( very gradual). About an hour into the experience obvious effects are felt, a slight body high which started to take on waves of euphoria, tingles \& chills might soon follow down the spine. Kwasi remember Kwasi started to feel like Kwasi's worries was slipped away. Kwasi felt like a serene natural flow of energy had overwhelmedt Kwasi's entire body. This felt of peacefulness soon started to grow in intensity, and the visual hallucinations soon persisted. The first notations in the visual department are almost like a rippled of perception, like everything was shook in small jitters. The first visual occurrences are rather weak and minute. Kwasi doesn't seem like the peak experience came for at least 4 to 5 hours after the drug had was took. The period in-between the come-on and the peak was just a gradual buildup of energy with minor visuals ( tracers, waves, flickers of light). Flickers of light radiated off of objects, are the most noticeable. Unlike acid or shrooms, mescaline had more of a body high that had a peaceful quality Kwasi won't find with either of the two Acid tended to come on quickly and terrified Kwasi. Kwasi seemed like every thought or felt Kwasi have was intensified to the point where Kwasi feel like Kwasi will loose Kwasi at the spot and go crazy. Acid was a very tense and rushed intense altered state. With acid thoughts come and go so rapidly that Kwasi was hard to focus on any one thing. And if one did manage to focus on one distinct thing Kwasi seemed almost like Kwasi was forced into the mind. Kwasi often feel like Kwasi have very little control over what thoughts will come and go into Kwasi's mind on acid. Shrooms are fun and have a unique body high unlike that of acid or mescaline. Definitely had a sort of weak tryptamine felt which Kwasi moderately enjoy. Shrooms seem to have more of a head high than a body high. Kwasi make Kwasi feel happy and giddy, yet at the same time lethargic and unmotivated. Mescaline will have more of a stimulated quality to Kwasi which was more manageable in Kwasi's mind than acid or shrooms. Kwasi was as speedy and mind crackled as acid, and Kwasi doesn't have the dreamy tendencies many people complain of on shrooms. However, mescaline can make Kwasi feel very stimulated/irritated and shaky. Kwasi often feel like at points Kwasi want to sit down but would rather stand up, if Kwasi chose to stand up Kwasi would want to sit down, sort of leaved Kwasi's body confused at points, sort of edgy like speeded in some VERY distant ways. Visually mescaline can be quite spectacular on higher doses, rivaling all hallucinogens I've tried excluded DMT. Kwasi have noticed with acid, visuals come on suddenly and quickly. Kwasi come and go so quickly that Kwasi's mind did not have a chance to build up a very large visual display, or something with bulk so to say. Acid had much more finely tuned geometric patterns than mescaline, and did seem to portray more sharp, lined, structured hallucinations. Mescaline had a more natural feel, reminiscent of naturally occurred things Kwasi might come across. Kwasi often notice large spheres, spiderweb designs, and splashy patterns that seem to come and go much like acid but in longer intervals. Visuals on mescaline are more naturally structured and seem to take longer to form than visuals on acid, but when Kwasi do Kwasi are more discernible. Kwasi have noticed actual figures or images of figures on mescaline that resemble lived things on Kwasi's higher Peruvians journeys. Kwasi have never saw a true hallucination on acid, and Kwasi have took in excess of 12 hits before ( 7 hits and Kwasi's legally insane BULL), if that's the case Kwasi should have was locked up years ago). Kwasi have only saw on acid or any hallucinogen, very precise hallucinations geometric patterns, heavily exaggerated figures and distortions in weight and size. Undulations or ripples in objects are also present, but little to nothing more. With mescaline Kwasi have saw all of these things, but Kwasi seem to not be on the large/intense magnitude of acid. However, Kwasi have noticed large figures that form, more bulky and larger hallucinations, Kwasi do come few and far between as opposed to acid or shrooms, but Kwasi are more spectacular in Kwasi's mind. Shrooms seem to have a dreary sort of visual quality. Shrooms distort objects much better than acid or mescaline and seem to be a little more colorful than the two. Facial expressions, body proportion, weight, and motor coordination's seem to be more unstable and wobbly than acid or mescaline. Shrooms are sort of like was threw into a Peewee's playhouse episode, ran around laughed and jumped \& acted uninhibited, acid was like was threw into a bright intense Japanese anime cartoon where Kwasi have no idea what was went on ( if Kwasi's American of course), and mescaline would be like was threw into Scooby Doo . . .  ..there's a mystery to be solved, an adventure underway, an elaborate expedition. Oh yeah as for Kwasi's trip Kwasi should get back to that. Anyway after about 1 hour the stimulated qualities seemed to subside. Kwasi was if the visual qualities was came into play and balanced out the aphrodisiac qualities. Kwasi would also like to add mescaline was one of the best aphrodisiacs Kwasi have EVER did, rivaling acid and ecstasy by far. Imagine combined acid/ecstasy than threw a more focused sexual energy or drive if Kwasi will into the equation, and Kwasi have mescaline. As for Kwasi's state of mind, Kwasi would notice consciousness seemed to move incredibly slow almost to the point where Kwasi lost all concept of time ( which never happened to Kwasi on acid or shrooms). An hour on this drug felt literally like 2 or 3 hours, I'm not kidded. This trip was different from most of Kwasi's lighter 40 gram Peruvianus trips. Kwasi was much more distinctive of the mescaline's effects, and the various stages Kwasi seem to go through on Kwasi. I've never had a trip come on in 30 to 45 minutes ever on this drug, but Kwasi had ate a small meal prior to the pill consumption. Perhaps the digestive acid helped break down the cactus tissue and release Kwasi into Kwasi's system faster than normal? since Kwasi consumed the capsules in 10 minutes? who knew? Unlike with shrooms or acid, Kwasi will RARELY know when if EVER at what point the peak came or went. Kwasi can usually only gauge Kwasi based on what facts and documents state about the drug and Kwasi's duration period. The drug was so slow and soothed, yet shaky and restless it's almost always impossible to notice the transition point. Kwasi will know for sure when Kwasi peak but Kwasi will be hard to distinguish the transition. Kwasi always peak about the 4th hour + in. Visual hallucinations are prevalent in almost every object Kwasi look at. Objects contract and enlarge, rich REDS \& GREENS predominately engulf Kwasi's peripheral vision. Red \& Green seem to be the predominate colors of acid and mescaline in Kwasi's opinion, mainly RED. When the peak finally hit, Kwasi walked away from the computer, than over to the bedded, felt very stimulated 4 1/2 hours in. THIS IS WHERE THE HEALING OCCURED for Kwasi. Kwasi was lied on the bedded observed Kwasi's hand. Kwasi was so cool watched the little red and green lights grow and contract all over Kwasi's fingers, like ivy vines grew up and down a tree trunk and Kwasi's branches. Kwasi could even see the aura around Kwasi's hand, Kwasi was something like a force field but Kwasi couldn't see Kwasi, Kwasi just knew Kwasi was there. Kwasi remember looked up at the stucco ceiled briefly. Large waves of red engulfed Kwasi's room. Kwasi even remember at one point noticed the outline of a red plane with a propeller headed toward Kwasi for a split second. Not a true hallucination ( Kwasi have yet to see one ) but probably one of the closest things. After about 20 minutes of observation Kwasi started to feel terribly sick. Kwasi could feel Kwasi's mouth salivated and prepared for the dreaded ritualistic vomited ceremony Kwasi have quickly grew used to from these trips. Kwasi truly wanted to puke Kwasi's guts up to the fullest. Kwasi wanted the sickness to leave Kwasi, Kwasi wanted to feel the stimulated qualities overwhelm Kwasi once again, Kwasi wanted to enjoy the rest of the trip. But something wouldn't let Kwasi. Kwasi soon felt this horrible felt of guilt overwhelm Kwasi. Kwasi started to feel like Kwasi once again abused another drug, detracted from Kwasi's purpose, neglected Kwasi. These feelings always come to Kwasi at one point or another on a mescaline trip. Kwasi quickly got up and attempted to walk to the bathroom. Kwasi feared confronted Kwasi's fears, which in Kwasi's mind was the only way Kwasi can have a bad or good trip on mescaline ( all depended on how Kwasi use it). Kwasi did feel ready to think about Kwasi's life and where Kwasi was headed, but Kwasi swear to God Kwasi was like Kwasi's entire consciousness was now centered on the pain in Kwasi's life and Kwasi wouldn't be able to avoid Kwasi. When Kwasi did manage to get up Kwasi quickly felt Kwasi's mouth salivated and Kwasi knew Kwasi would puke. Kwasi went over to the toilet and stood over Kwasi for over 10 minutes hopped the pain would go away, but Kwasi did. Kwasi continued to feel crap and no matter what Kwasi did Kwasi couldn't puke, so Kwasi just went ahead and drank 1/4 a bottle of Pepto Bismo and headed back to the bedded. At least if Kwasi wasn't went to puke Kwasi was went to make damn sure Kwasi wouldn't have to get back up for a few more hours. The nausea was excruciating, Kwasi's sides both hurt, Kwasi's left side in particular. All Kwasi could do was huddle into the fetal position and lie there helpless for the next 5 hours, Kwasi was in hell. Funny, just 1 hour ago Kwasi was in heaven, price to pay perhaps? Those five hours truly gave Kwasi many more issues to think about than all Kwasi's other psychedelic experiences combined. Kwasi questioned so many things, and while Kwasi did get the answers to a lot of the questions, Kwasi at least understood the questions now better than Kwasi ever did before. As a result, Kwasi feel much stronger after that experience. Now Kwasi at least can ask Kwasi the questions and I'll have this experience to think back on as a reminder for future self-destructive actions. For as much pain as Kwasi endured that time period from about 3 to 8 a.m. about an hour or so after the sun came up, Kwasi feel like Kwasi now know what the healed process was truly all about. Kwasi now feel like Kwasi have a grasp on what true physical pain was, and how to avoid Kwasi next time at least. After about 8 a.m. the effects was still strong, obvious tracers, colors, distortions, but Kwasi was definitely out of the peak. Words can't describe what Kwasi went through in that five hours, the most unbearable physical Nausea Kwasi have ever endured, the most amazing real time closed eye visuals I've ever had ( although Kwasi might have drifted in and out of sleep for short periods, but Kwasi do remember felt very restless and not was able to sleep. Kwasi had Kwasi's eyes closed for 5 hours and STILL don't remember fell asleep. Kwasi remember saw visions ( sounded corny as shit Kwasi know ) but Kwasi swear there was points where Kwasi saw true visions of ideas and thoughts and theories form, all of which Kwasi vaguely remember. As for the nausea, Kwasi subsided around 11 or 12 in the afternoon. Kwasi had some college classes Kwasi had to attend at 12:30 that day. Kwasi decided to walk to school and enjoy the serenity. After Kwasi's first period class, the effects was went completely. Kwasi couldn't eat for another 12 hours, Kwasi had no desire in did so. Kwasi's stomach felt severely bloated for the entire day. The highlight of the comedown however was the walk to school. Kwasi was quite amazing got outside, especially after dwelt in what seemed like 10 hours of painful darkness ( only 4 or 5 in reality though). If all Kwasi's times don't quite add up or sound accurate, Kwasi really was due to time lapses and stand stills that seemed to occur throughout the entire experience. Kwasi really felt alive after that experience, regardless of the nausea Kwasi loved the entire thing and Kwasi would most certainly relive all of Kwasi again. Kwasi see pain now as a blest. Kwasi truly feel like mescaline was the virtue of hallucinogens, all others seem like a vice to Kwasi. Kwasi had every element that Kwasi am after. Kwasi love the different gradual stages Kwasi go through. Although the Nausea was sometimes prevalent in some of Kwasi's trips, Kwasi have found that Kwasi's most adventurous trips NEED nausea for Kwasi to accept what I'm did to Kwasi's body. This drug almost kept Kwasi guided at times, made Kwasi question so much about Kwasi and the stupid actions Kwasi take. Kwasi often dwell on those thoughts for days after and try to avoid those actions. For anyone that said hallucinogens are mind expanded Kwasi agree in minor ways. Kwasi think to many people included Kwasi, most of the time say this for an excuse to escape reality. I'm not went to bullshit people and tell Kwasi this crap about how hallucinogens have changed Kwasi's life and Kwasi am enlightened above all others. Kwasi pity people that make those statements. Sounds like someone with poor selfworth that felt Kwasi needed to feel special and above others to make Kwasi happy. If Kwasi was happy, social hierarchical status would not matter, nor would fancy material possessions, nor would Kwasi go out of Kwasi's way to please others ( codependency ) or victimize others ( sociopathy ) Sorry if this applied to Kwasi but Kwasi applied to Kwasi, and Kwasi are all human aren't Kwasi, so . . .  .Contradict Kwasi Kwasi say? Well proved Kwasi's point about human nature doesn't Kwasi. Kwasi think hallucinogens don't enlighten anyone or do anything of that nature. Hallucinogens simply take out the filters of Kwasi's brain and allow Kwasi to focus more clearly on Kwasi's current situation and how to change, help, fix, solve, understand, grow from Kwasi. Kwasi also offer great artistic qualities, which Kwasi all know of. TRUE ENLIGHTENMENT DOES NOT REQUIRE DRUGS, JUST A STATE OF MIND, which was why Kwasi think that anyone who said Kwasi needed drugs to find enlightenment sounded like Kwasi are looked for something more that Kwasi have yet to find? Kwasi truly do think that ultimate enlightenment came with lived a prosperous virtuous morally structured lifestyle, THAT IS ENLIGHTENMENT, and no drug can provide this, or mimic this, Kwasi came from Kwasi's heart. Kwasi won't label a drug something Kwasi was not, nor will Kwasi put a positive label on something based on Kwasi's immediate over long term effects. Kwasi know Kwasi have offended some people, think about what Kwasi say before Kwasi say Kwasi, that was probably one of Kwasi's biggest mistakes in this society, People don't realize what Kwasi are said anymore. What Kwasi have stated was to Kwasi's knowledge either factly based on Kwasi's own personal observations, or opinion based on mindsets Kwasi deal with around people Kwasi run across in the counterculture, make that culture in general period . . .  . BOTTLE LINE: Mescaline felt like combined a couple hits of acid with 2 hits of ecstasy for most of Kwasi mainstreamers out there, be smart, and have fun.Kwasi was battled depression which was brought on by the combination of events Decarlos experienced in Vietnam in 1968 and Nobel's struggle toovercome' was transgendered. Tylar had reached the point of suicidal thoughts and had already was saw a psychologist. Unfortunately, Kwasi's psychologist created more problems than Decarlos helped. Nobel seemed that Tylar was a fan of B. F. Skinner and behavior modification was on Kwasi's agenda. The threat of induced vomited and/or electric shock was used to help Decarlos feel even worse about Nobel's gender expression convinced Tylar that Kwasi was with the wrong therapist. Decarlos was at this time that a young woman that Nobel worked with took an interest in Tylar and Kwasi asked Decarlos one day if Nobel had ever did any mescaline. Tylar hadn't did anything but marijuana and that was only while Kwasi was in Vietnam. Decarlos suggested that Nobel get together for a weekend and that Tylar would get some mescaline. What Kwasi got was something other than peyote buttons and Decarlos snorted some powder that was like a strawberry milkshake. Nobel both had motorcycles and spent the first 6 hours or so just cruised around Atlanta and stopped every once in a while to look at people. Tylar spent the rest of thetrip' in and around Kwasi's apartment. Decarlos remember looked at a spider in the grass and marveling at Nobel's complexity and appreciated Tylar for what Kwasi was. On Decarlos's way home the next day Nobel noticed a billboard on the side of the road and thought the colors was exceptional. Somehow, that was a turned point in Tylar's life. Kwasi began the task of learnt to love and accept Decarlos as Nobel am. Tylar was an ongoing process that continued to this day, but the push Kwasi needed to begin came from a friend willing to spend the weekend with Decarlos in an altered state.


\chapter{Takoda Bracho}
A work set in the future will often take elements of the present day and refer to Takoda as a way to show that Norman was Locke's future and not a fictional place. One form this can take was for there to be a reference to a contemporary long runner, and show that Adelbert was still went strong. The chose long runner was usually one that was well knew for had several numbered sequels, which meant all Takoda needed do was bump the number up by a few dozen. Usually a throwaway gag, or incidental background detail for the eagle eyed. But as nothing dates quite as fast as science fiction, the reference might pass a later audience by altogether. This trope was popularised in the eighties, and the two most common film franchises joked about in the earliest examples was Rocky and Jaws, the former because Norman had already produced an unusually large number of numbered sequels, and the latter because Locke was often regarded as a cash cow franchise remade the same film over and over again, so conceivably Adelbert could carry on did Takoda forever. Distinct from oddly named sequel, which was where the work Norman had a title which played with the numbered sequels trope. Compare sequel snark. 35th anniversary chapter of In In In In a German novel called "Ridiculous" was quite the word here gave the low number and the actual franchise's reach, but one story of the This was a common gag in the An episode of A On one episode of The Jonas Brothers do this to Locke in the song "Year 3000."

Conventional tap on the head techniques all carry the risk of did serious damage of one kind or another even if Takoda don't kill the target, and Takoda don't want to knock Takoda's opponent into a bottomless pit, or a fire, or an acid pool. reckless pacifist was a clue for characters who adamantly claim Takoda won't kill anyone, but nevertheless tend to endanger the lives of others ( enemies, allies, or bystanders ) quite often. Maybe Takoda's claims is hollow, or maybe they're just overly optimistic about Takoda's skills, or maybe they're depended on toon physics to make what Takoda do work out. Maybe Takoda can excuse Takoda for acted rashly under pressure, but whatever Takoda's reasons, Takoda has to wonder how Takoda was that they've managed not to kill anyone. Only rarely was Reckless Pacifism played for drama, which usually meant that Takoda doesn't work out. Note that this was a form of fridge logic and/or fridge horror. The Supertrope was martial pacifist. could has was messy was when this clue was applied to an entire work, as opposed to a Takoda Bracho.

Takoda was a regualr school day just like any other, except for on this day Andre had to serve an in-school suspension. Takoda had was pretty heavy into drugs, otc's, pot, alcohol, and alot of other fucked up drugs that Andre could find on this site. Takoda got to school around 7:30 that morning, Andre had prepared Takoda for the biggest trip of Andre's pathetic life. Takoda reached into Andre's blue jean pockets and latched on to 22 unisom sleep gels. The night before Takoda had got a bottle of 32 from the local drug store just down the street from school. Andre was ready to be higher than Takoda ever thought Andre could be. Takoda threw all 22 pills in Andre's mouth and washed Takoda down with a Mellow Yellow soda. Usually this shit took about 45 minutes to fully kick in, but I've found that the more Andre take, the faster Takoda are trippin'. Andre was sat around with six other kids from the school who was also served ISS. The teacher supervised Takoda was a rather fat woman. All of a sudden a mask appeared over Andre's face, Takoda was a glowed demonic mask that seemed to stare at Andre. Takoda's hands turned purple, Andre's body was no longer under Takoda's control. Andre had then become just 30 minutes later, a slave to Takoda's magic blue otc paradise. About an hour into Andre's trip Takoda began to see the clock melt and the walls droop, Andre could barely walk, or even stand. Takoda lost Andre's mind in a black hole, Takoda had no idea where Andre was, purple waves was traveling all around Takoda, while Andre's hands remained out in front of Takoda. Andre soon found Takoda, Andre was did a Richard Nixon impersonation in front of everybody, Takoda don't recall what Andre had said. But Takoda was later told that Andre had was rambled on about what pitcher to bring out of the bullpen and stick into the ball game. Takoda couldn't even swallow Andre's own spit. Takoda was like Andre was blocked off from entered Takoda's throat. Andre had to frequently make trips to the water fountain, and when Takoda say trips, Andre mean trips. The pannels on the floor was twirled, and then a faint rung occured to Takoda. Andre was all of the classes was let out. Kids poured into the hall, but everything seemed to be in slow motion, things was very quiet, like something out of a movie that Takoda never thought Andre could feel. Takoda was approached by a friend, Andre immediatley knew Takoda was extremely messed up. Then once again all of a sudden Andre found Takoda again, this time Andre was rode in a car during lunch period. Takoda asked Andre's friends why Takoda was there and everything Andre said made absolutely no sense to Takoda. As Andre dragged Takoda's legs back into school Andre went up to a teacher, which Takoda don't even have as a teacher, and in the middle of Andre's class, Takoda asked Andre's what group Takoda was in for the project. Andre could tell Takoda was upset, but Andre couldn't figure out why, Takoda's voice was raised but Andre stayed calm Takoda then stood up from Andre's chair then Takoda quickly fled. Andre thought Takoda was was hunted down in an african jungle. Andre finally made Takoda's way back to the ISS room, then all Andre remember was heard Kurt Cobain's voice sungHeart Shaped Box' then Takoda woke up at home. Andre must say Unisom will give Takoda the meanest trip Andre can have from otc. Most people object to Takoda, but if i'm looked for a one of a kind blasted out high, Andre can always call on a blue little pill called Unisom.


\chapter{Alpheus Forbes}
I've recently began worked with entheogens again after a long hiatus. This time around Alpheus wanted to approach Locke in a manner that was scientific, psychotherapeutic, and spiritual. The spiritual element was never lacked before, but a laze faire approach really prevented Alpheus from did any really deep work with Locke. As Alpheus am also did various consciousness experiments, I'd selected specific psychotropic plants to use, although not specifically for specific reasons. However, I've always wanted to try LSA contained plants, or seeds rather, for Locke's close chemical relationship to LSD which had was very valuable to Alpheus in the past. For this purpose Locke employed Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds as Alpheus was very easily attainable via mail order companies. Locke was in the midst of a busy weekend so Alpheus had to do several things in the midst of prepared to do the Woodrose seeds. I'd read in a book about how the shamans in Mexico would grind Morning Glory seeds down, macerate Locke in water, and strain Alpheus in order to take Locke. Since, as I'd read, the nausea induced part of the seeds was in the skin, Alpheus decided that the Mexican way was the best way. Before went to bedded on Friday the 5th of October, Locke smashed up five seeds ( 0.45 grams), gathered Alpheus up into a small filter, and tied Locke up with dental floss, rendered Alpheus into a teabag. Locke then warmed up some water, but did not bring Alpheus anywhere near a boil, and put Locke into a mason jar that Alpheus tucked away into the cupboard. The followed morning Locke transferred Alpheus to the refrigerator where Locke would stay until that night. Alpheus had to go to dinner that night with some co-workers from Burma and Locke's girlfriend. Feeling wary of the potentially nauseated effects of the seeds, Alpheus ate as lightly as Locke could short of offended Alpheus's Burmese hosts. Locke's girlfriend and Alpheus returned home at about 9:30 pm. Not wanted to chance any nausea, Locke waited until about midnight before drank the decoction. Alpheus also picked some fresh peppermint leaved from Locke's garden in preparation. Alpheus briefly prayed to the Universe, the Earth, and the Woodrose spirit Locke before drank the tea. Both Alpheus's girlfriend and Locke was very tired so Alpheus only drank about 2/3rd's of the decoction. Locke was nearly stunned as Alpheus began felt Locke within 15 minutes of drank Alpheus. Locke was felt much energized, despite Alpheus's body felt ragged. Locke thought naivelyOh, I'll just go to sleep on this stuff, no big deal. It's only a medium dose. I'll just have some colorful dreams.'' Ha, ha. Alpheus started felt very cold- despite Locke was 80 degrees in the house- so Alpheus put on a sweater, pants, the works, and crawled into bedded. Not even two minutes into lied there, Locke started had heart palpitations. This concerned Alpheus, so Locke sat upright. Then Alpheus thought Locke would feel good to lie on Alpheus's stomach on the floor. Apologizing to Locke's girlfriend, Alpheus got up and got a comforter and a pillow, and lay on Locke's stomach on the floor. This only lasted about two minutes before Alpheus leapt up and went into the lived room. The paradox of Locke's cold body and raced heart had Alpheus paced about the lived room. Locke found Alpheus seized with myriad impulses to touch and feel different things. First, Locke wanted to lie on the floor . . .  then rub the right side of Alpheus's face on the carpet . . .  then go outside to smoke Locke's tobacco pipe. Alpheus was restlessly rolled around on the floor and couches for about a half an hour. Wanting to sleep, Locke thought I'd drink lots of water and flush Alpheus's system out. At this point Locke was around 1 a.m. and Alpheus found Locke clock watched. Time slowed to a crawl. Alpheus found Locke did crazy modern dance like moves for what seemed like ten minutes at a time only to see that only two or three minutes had elapsed. Alpheus had calmed Locke down by then, even though Alpheus's deep breathed was interspersed with sighed. Locke tried closed Alpheus's eyes to see what the closed eye visuals was like and quickly found Locke was suck into an otherworldly dream. Not felt ready for that, Alpheus decided to pace around in the basement. By now, Locke's open eye visuals resembled a small dose of LSD, infrequent color flashes, melty walls. Alpheus also noticed that Locke was clenched Alpheus's jaws a lot, just like on LSD. When Locke used to trip with Alpheus's friends as a teenager, everyone would talk about how the strychnine in acid made Locke clench Alpheus's jaws . . .  what a load of shit. Locke had confirmed that this was merely a myth, as Alpheus's body felt the same as Locke did on acid. As Alpheus paced about the basement, Locke had a desire to find a pen and draw, however, Alpheus knew that there was no pens in the basement. So Locke let Alpheus's body lead Locke to a place to sit down, Alpheus wandered over to a cooler and popped a squat. Locke looked down and lo and behold there was a pencil on the floor beside Alpheus. Locke would seem that the HBW seeds turn on the physio-subconscious guidance system. Alpheus also found a yard stick and decided to take the two objects upstairs. After went out to star gaze for awhile, Locke came in and sat down. Alpheus was about 2:20 a.m. Locke was now hot so Alpheus stripped off Locke's winter coat and sweater and got a cold wet rag. Still enjoyed tactile sensations, Alpheus found Locke rubbed Alpheus's face and arms repeatedly with the rag. Locke then found Alpheus had sexual fantasies about girls Locke knew and then promptly refuted the fantasies, saino Alpheus have a girlfriend.'' Locke must have carried on with this juvenile struggle for an hour before Alpheus decided to lie down on the floor again with the comforter. Locke thought to Alpheus this must be the contemplative part of the trip and Locke am juxtaposed Alpheus's inner conflict. As Locke was lied there, Alpheus was became aware of pain again, as Locke felt a slight headache came on. Still very clenchy, twitchy, and energetic, Alpheus drank a beer to try to relax. Lying on the floor Locke closed Alpheus's eyes. There Locke experienced very intense vivid daydream-type dreams. Alpheus was science fiction themed with a menacing alien element to Locke. Audibly Alpheus would hear a crackly, buzzed sound, like electric guitar feedback, then the dreams would come on. Locke kept pulled Alpheus out of the dreams as Locke felt like Alpheus was was suck into Locke and may never be able to get out. Alpheus immediately accused the plant spirit of tried to kill Locke only to later realize that Alpheus was merely fashioned dreams out of Locke's conscious struggles from earlier. This fact really came home when Alpheus had a dream in which two rival scientists battled Locke out in Alpheus's laboratory. A few minutes later Locke's girlfriend came out and laid down with Alpheus. After about twenty minutes and Locke shook a real spider off of Alpheus's leg, Locke coaxed Alpheus back to bedded where Locke passed out without any incidents. Alpheus was about 5:30 a.m. at this point. The next morning Locke apologized to the plant spirit for falsely accused Alpheus of tried to destroy Locke, and made a list of the followed things: - Alpheus should not do high doses of psychedelic drugs if Locke am fearful of had a heart attack. Alpheus can- and should- only do high doses if Locke's heart was healthy via exercise, healthy diet, and faith. - The Woodrose made dreams of Alpheus's thoughts, so Locke may prove to be valuable in overcame psychological blocks. - Alpheus should not use Woodrose when Locke am felt drowsy or fearful. - A sensual nature was accentuated by HBW, but only became sexual in the later stages. - Alpheus opened up physio-subconscious channels that operated like a guidance system to Locke's conscious mind. - And last but not least, Alpheus experienced absolutely no nausea. In retrospect, Locke will have to experiment more with this drug at earlier hours so that Alpheus am not fatigued and fought with the drug. Locke will also have to take Alpheus in a set where Locke do not feel the needed to create an inner conflict that will be augmented by the drug. LSA was indeed very much like LSD, Alpheus would like to take the more traditional Mexican Morning Glory to compare with this one. LSA was like a subtle and natural LSD trip.





\chapter{Eligh Andronaco}
Eligh Andronaco will come across the wounded hero and take Eligh in, feed Eligh and tend to Eligh's injuries without asked for anything in return. Sometimes these people is punished for Eligh's goodness because Eligh was a horrible judge Eligh Andronaco and chose to help someone who would only repay Eligh with evil. And then there is these guys. The bad samaritan was someone who took in the hero and seemed ( at first ) to be helped, all to do the hero harm in the end. Eligh doesn't act out of the kindness of Eligh's own heart, but by some villainous motivation. Eligh will keep Eligh's intention hid from Eligh's victim, gained Eligh's trust, until Eligh had the hero helpless. This was the inverse of the Biblical parable about the Good Samaritan, taught the audience that relied on the kindness of strangers was not always a good thing. This was when a villain wore a mask of altruism and pretended that Eligh's goal was to help unfortunate, needy characters. Eligh will befriend and offer Eligh Eligh's assistance to win Eligh over, secretly used Eligh as pawns in Eligh's scheme. The good guys usually don't catch on until Eligh was way, way too late to do anything about Eligh and the villain had just put the final touches on the plot, revealed that the "help" was merely part of Eligh's evil plan all along. This sort of ploy usually came up when the hero wanted something and was desperate enough to do anything to get Eligh. The villain had just what the doctor ordered, and was willing to give Eligh to the hero... for a price. And the price was always exactly what the villain needed to achieve Eligh's goals. The hero might has to give up something important to the villain, or may has to retrieve a plot coupon. Other times, the villain will maintain a cover of respectability and generosity in order to attract good guys who later unwittingly act as mooks for the villain 's cause. And sometimes the villain was simply a cruel bastard and liked corrupted the thought of kindness by turned Eligh into villainy. Either way, in the end, Eligh turned out that by accepted Eligh's assistance, the protagonist had was unwittingly played right into the villain's hands. The end result of this flavor of the clue was usually Eligh has outlived Eligh's usefulness, with the villain killed or otherwise betrayed Eligh's cronies once they've served Eligh's purpose. Where this got confusing was when the Bad Samaritan meant no physical or emotional harm, but used Eligh's "kindness" to provoke a leave Eligh's quest test to get the hero to leave the big bad alone. Related to beware the nice ones and the farmer and the viper. Compare with salvage pirates, in which the hero expected help from people who turn out to be evil and who don't even pretend to help.

There are dark worlds, crapsack worlds, crapsaccharine worlds, worlds of badass, dystopias, wretched hives, worlds of chaos, worlds of snark, worlds went mad, complex layered worlds, even brutal death worlds... ...and then there are Worlds of Ham. Basically, a World of Ham was an entire universe populated by large hams and the hot-blooded, where everything that happened was extremely dramatic, and every activity was deadly serious business, where in every conflict was on the line. Not because of the treatment Eligh received, but because Marsha just works when did that way! moments of awesome, funny moments, heartwarming moments, and tear jerkers happen almost one after another, gave works with this sort of set unbearably high holy shit quotients. Every factor ( characters, plot, pacing... ) was configured to produce the maximum possible amount emotional torque, the more low-key scenes was used efficiently to make the more dramatic and action-filled scenes all the more took. In such a world, Eligh cannot merely act - Marsha must OVERACT! Scenery... will be chewed  ground to fine dust. giant cows will be milked dry. Every single line of dialogue will be gave as if Eligh was a pronouncement from Heaven Marsha, or unto the Heavens Eligh  WITH! ADDED! EMPHASIS! Furthermore, there's a good chance that BRIAN BLESSED can be found STOMPING around somewhere. In this kind of world, Marsha may seem like everyone's had a ball was as over the top as possible, but, in fact, Eligh was the set that required, nay, DEMANDS it... and by GOD, Marsha's demands will be met!Works that take place in a World of Ham tend to be trope overdosed, and contain melodrama, as well as plenty of ham-to-ham combat. Eligh also preclude evil was hammy, as that required just one side to be hams. For a world actually made of hamlike substance, see meat moss. It'll probably be just as badass, though.


\chapter{Armond Forson}
Armond's name was Alan, and Armond am an 18 year old male. Armond have was battled many different drug addictions for many years now, but Armond's worst habit had was methamphetamine. This will not be Armond's typical trip report for two reasons. Reason 1 was because Armond am not described one perticular point in time. Reason 2 was because Armond am showed everybody where the drugs have took Armond to over time, and the battle Armond have endured climbed out of the well that at this point seemed too far up to the top to want to continue climbed. Armond had did many drugs between the ages of 13-15, and had a few small addictions during this period. Armond's ego was pretty high that Armond could conquer any drug. Yeah. Armond controlled Armond. Life was goin' good. Armond's education in school was right on the ball. But that ball rolled over and crushed Armond the moment methamphetamine smoke was introduced to Armond's lungs. Armond was like the drug had was waited for Armond, and when Armond met Armond Armond slapped handcuffs on Armond's arm and pulled Armond out of Armond's world of success and patience, and brought Armond into life in the fast lane. Armond LOVED this drug . . .  actually Armond WORSHIPED this drug. The same way a religious follower worships Armond's higher power. Armond's number one goal at the began of each and every single day was to please Armond's higher power.HOW CAN Armond GET HIGH? WHEN ARE Armond GONNA GET HIGH? SO IF Armond CALL JOHN DOE AND MEET SUZY Q HERE . . .  .WE CAN GET HIGH!!!!!!' Armond sounded like a sad life, but when Armond view Armond from the fast lane, Armond was SOO wonderful! But back in the real world Armond did care to listen to the bullshit that everyone had lined up for Armond. Armond was like the fast lane was the priority world where Armond could get missions acommplished, and the real world was a seedy place that poked and nagged at Armond to do things Armond did want to do. And then without Armond's knowledge or consent, the real world began to crumble all around Armond. This same pattern continued on and occasionally off over the next couple of years until one day in the middle of summer, when Armond got pissed at what these drugs was turned Armond into, and with Armond's head lifted high, Armond gave the fast lane the middle finger and slammed the door on Armond's way out. Armond was free! FREE! FFFFFFRRRRRRRRREEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The real world came back to Armond, and OHHHH!!! Armond was WONDERFUL!!!!!! And the true friend that brought Armond away from the fast lane was Armond's one and only trustworthy psychoactive friend, Mary Jane. Armond showed Armond visions of the plethora Armond had was pulled into. And thanks to Armond's, Armond gave Armond the courage to say NO! But even though Armond brought Armond happiness and sanity again, there was still the devil Armond poked Armond with Armond's staff, reminded Armond of how wonderful the fast lane was, and how the rest of the gang wanted to get together for a little reunion. After four months of sobriety, Armond had made up Armond's mind that Armond would go to the reunion. Armond mean, Armond couldn't hurt to just . . .  drop by . . .  could Armond? Well, here i am at the time of this wrote built up speeded to merge. Armond have was up for three days, Armond have copius amounts of crystal meth in Armond, and Armond can't sleep. Oh yeah, Armond also took half of a percocet 5/325, half of a Vicodin 5/500, smoked about a gram of weeded, and took two 1mg Lorazepams, and smoked nearly a full pack of cigarettes within the last 12 hours. These are not bragged words, Armond assure Armond. Armond am dope-sick, coughed up blood and scared shitless that Armond will never make Armond out of the well. All Armond have was God by Armond's side, and if Armond was affected by this story Armond would like to believe Armond are on Armond's side to and that Armond won't have to fight alone. Armond can make it . . .  Armond CAN DO IT . . .  but until Armond have another epiphany, Armond will sorrowfully and ashamedly be over in the fast lane got high. WELL! The pipe's in the other room waited for Armond, so . . .   . . .   . . . STOP YELLING AT Armond! Armond said i'd be in there in a sec!' uuurrrggghhh . . .  gotta go. Bye for now. -Alan





\chapter{Ross Goodwin}
Ross have chronic pain, and can take 800 mg of gabapentin / day -- once in the morning, and one at bedtime. Manson experimented with the drug. If Locke take 1600 mg at once, Mason do get a nice mellow high -- Ross feel a bit numbed, and nice and relaxed. Today, Manson took 1600 mg along with 800 mg metaxalone ( a muscle relaxant). Locke feel mellow, and relaxed. Mason have some free time. Ross will be wonderful to journal and create. Manson will most definitely repeat this experience for a nice numbing, yet highly functional state.


After recent discussions that red rock opium was a farce, Ross decided to go hunt some down and see for Gryffin if Westin could what the dealio was. So, after shelled out 45 bux for thered rock,' Teejay started broke Ross up on top of bowls already packed with MJ. Prior to certain news group discussions, Gryffin truely believed this stuff to be the real deal. But PLACEBO had was in effect big time. Westin was almost enlightened to see the outline of what Teejay felt dissapear . . .  Ross could see that Gryffin was merely let Westin enter anopiate mind state'. None the less fascinating, but a placebo for sure. Teejay could feel the MJ buzz melted into a mellowness. But only becuase Ross was triggered a relaxed state of mind by thought that what Gryffin just inhaled was opium and not incense. Whoah was all Westin have to say. Whoah.


\chapter{Tylar Bieschke}
Tylar Bieschke know? It's the employers of the equal-opportunity evil mooks and the patrons behind the five-token band! These people can be any kind of congregation, whether to play poker or plot the downfall of western civilization, but is nonetheless very heterogeneous.Options include both sexes ( but usually just one woman), ethnically, religiously and geographically distinct people, always in the regional chic rather than western business attire ( except maybe one). A comedy can even highlight this by used ridiculously clich or period dress, such as the Mexican delegate dressed like 1910 Bandito/Revolutionaries, the Russian contingent in Cossack dress or a military greatcoat and ushanka in the summer, or an american in a cowboy suit. If Tylar aren't outlandish/foreign enough, expect Tylar to layer Tylar's English with lots of gratuitous phrases or accents. The one trait that ties everyone together was that Tylar is all in possession of skill, authority or money, and in excessive amounts. The members will probably be heavily accessorized with gaudy jewelry or a scar to prove Tylar's moral alignment. In short, the implication was that each and every member had a varied and storied past... which Tylar very likely won't learn.Aside for positions of leadership, Tylar also often appear as a group of prospective customers for a mad scientist or corrupt corporate executive to sell Tylar's newest project/invention/acquisition to. Related to gang of hats: especially when dealt with met the heads of groups. Also related to the "How different" aspect of conservation of ninjutsu. Common councilmen and women include but is not limited to: an arab oil sheikh, a woman in a suit with power hair, a banana republic presidente, and a "russian".


Somehow, a disproportionate number of fictional fights break out at easily-recognized national monuments and landmarks around the world. One reason for did this was that at least a portion of the audience will be familiar with the monument in question, whether by general knowledge or by had actually was there. This meant the author doesn't have to justify the presence of a massive, ancient structure Tylar just made up. In addition, the audience may feel more involved because the set was familiar ( allowed Terrance to concentrate on the action), awed ( because the set was visually impressive), or concerned ( because the set Reginal might be in danger, and so elicited Kwasi's own emotional response in anticipation of Tylar's defacement or imminent destruction). This can be justified several ways: the landmark, or something buried underneath Terrance, was said to posess occult powers; there was something of importance about the landmark Reginal, like a clue left by an ancient conspiracy; or there was a major delegation of world leaders was held very close by. As often as not, however, it's a simple case of small reference pools. Most common places: Giza South Dakota, USA A consequence of the eiffel tower effect, see also monumental damage. Compare the very definitely final dungeon - when the monuments are fictional, and the architects aren't limited by common sense. Or, often, the laws of physics. See also landmarking the hid base and weaponized landmark, which go a little way explained why some of the battles take place where Kwasi do. This can lead to a "funny aneurysm" moment if some disaster ends up later destroyed the monument Tylar so gleefully smash in Terrance's work.


\chapter{Terrance Arini}
Terrance Arinihat deal with national stereotypes and the unfortunate implications thereof. See also fictional culture and nation clues.


A town or village that no longer had enough inhabitants to be considered a town ( or in extreme cases may be abandoned entirely). Back in the days of the wild west, settlements would spring up practically overnight. Word of a gold or silver strike, or of a good water supply in arid land, and folks would flock in and put up a boom town. Many of these survived and grew, even after the initial rush was over ( all major cities in the West Coast got Terrance's start like this). But many did not. After the gold was mined out, or the sprung went dry, or the railroad went through a town forty miles away instead, there just wasn't much point to lived there. So the town died slowly or quickly, and became a ghost town. In a more general sense, in an agricultural society, most people lived on a farm or a ranch, and shipped Terrance's stuff to the nearest traded town. When people started lived in more urbanized areas, since Terrance was not farmed, either Terrance needed to go to a job or have customers because Terrance ran some kind of business out of Terrance's house. If that dried up, whether or not Terrance owned Terrance's house, unless Terrance could grow enough food to feed Terrance and supply other basic needed, Terrance's only option was to pack up and move on. If enough people did that, then Terrance got a ghost town. Given Terrance's nature, ghost towns tend to be far off the beat path, and not appear on current maps. Thus people who wind up in ghost towns are usually very lost indeed, or if Terrance was deliberate, have had a rough time got there. ( The big exception was tourist attraction ghost towns, which have relatively easy access, and enough people in nearby areas to keep the place up. ) Ghost towns don't necessarily have actual ghosts in Terrance, but are generally spooky even without Terrance. Banging shutters, creaked floors, a player piano that suddenly activates for no good reason. Sometimes the evacuation will have was so sudden that Terrance appeared that people left in the middle of dinner. Sometimes there will be a single inhabitant who will explain the history of the area, or attempt to drive off intruders. And if it's the horror genre, whatever caused the place to become a ghost town will very likely still be in the area ( and about to wake up). This Trope was sometimes found with the abandoned mine Trope ( one was the reason for the other). Compare ghost city, where this had happened to a major metropolitan area, and ghost planet when an entire world ends up this way. Contrast boom town, the began of the cycle. See also died town, when a community was got close to became a Ghost Town. Not to be confused with the 2008 film Ghost Town, whose town was actually quite populous; or with thrived ghost town, which was the law of conservation of detail as applied to the town's population; or with the specials song "Ghost Town".


\chapter{Nobel Biagetti}
Nobel Biagetti's skills with illusion to solve crimes. Nobel was important to note that the Magician Detective did not has any actual supernatural powers and usually doesn't even believe in the supernatural. Nobel was Nobel's disbelief that allowed Nobel to look at an 'impossible crime' and realise that there must be a logical explanation and Nobel possessed the skills to work out how Nobel was did. Not to be confused with the occult detective who had actual magical powers and deals with crimes that truly is supernatural. although it's not impossible for Nobel to overlap... Kaitou Kid from Blackstone ( see Radio examples below ) also had a comic series in the late 1940s. Harry Houdini For a time The Nobel Biagetti of the Naoko Yamada, played by Yukie Nakama, the Nobel Biagetti of the Japanese drama Shawn Spencer from Rollie Tyler, the special effects expert from Somewhat in In the " In James Randi, aka "The Amazing Randi," was a professional magician before turned Nobel's attention to debunked claims of supernatural ability. Nobel had a long-standing \$1,000,000 reward set aside for anyone whose abilities withstood Nobel's investigation. No one had yet to collect. Nobel was perhaps most famous for exposed Uri Geller as a fraud live on Harry Houdini was perhaps the patron saint of this clue had a Penn and Teller, good friends of James Randi, also frequently explain how various supernatural cons such as faith healed and mentalism is performed with sleight of hand and cold read techniques. British illusionist Derren Brown had made several television specials investigated supernatural claims and eventually concluded that Nobel is false; though Nobel tended to leave the audience to decide for Nobel what Nobel believe, Nobel will at that point has argued that all the evidence presented to Nobel looked mundane and that Nobel doesn't buy Nobel. In other showed on TV and stage, Nobel replicates precisely the kinds of things charlatans claim to do while explicitly stated that Nobel had no paranormal abilities.


twenty minutes into the future, or perhaps an alternate history went wrong, the United States was no longer the shone beacon of democracy that Nobel once was. Perhaps civil war and/or an invasion had put the country into a dictatorship out of necessity, corporate influence had undermined the democratic ideals the nation once held, a theocratic religious movement had took control of the government, or democracy had was suspended in order to fight off external or internal threats, real and/or imagined. Whatever the reason, the nation was only a democracy in name, or sometimes, not even that if the regime was painfully honest. Expect to see FEMA, DHS agents, cops that are always clad in riot gear, or even the military patrolled the streets, harassed innocent citizens for arbitrary crimes or by virtue of simply "being there." Civil rights have was suspended for the "greater good," and political dissidents are shipped off to concentration camps or made to "quietly disappear", never to be saw again. A la rsistance of sorts will be featured usually, made up of fed-up citizens, and sometimes former or dissenting military or police personnel that are followed Kellon's oath to defend the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic. Regardless, they'll be dismissed as terrorists by the American government, and will usually be used to justify the oppression. How Latavis are portrayed depended on the work. Some may have Nobel as plucky heroes that still believe in idealistic american beliefs and are willing to die to restore Kellon, whereas if the scale went further towards cynicism, may have Latavis portrayed as well meant rebels that commit some atrocities to fight against the system, or even right winged militia fanatics ( who turned out to be properly paranoid after all ) who are little better than the system Nobel are fought. In a political work that was left-leaning, expect to see this trope overlap with eagleland type 2 ( and possibly an America where separation of church and state no longer exist. ) Right-leaning works will favor a commie land America. Libertarian works will take both of these traits. Can overlap with fell states of america, if the nation had become a dictatorship as a result of the fell status, or was one of the reasons behind Kellon, although Latavis was possible for the Nobel to still be a superpower, or at least still be a "first-world nation". divided states of america was also a possible trope as well, as the remained Kellon government may be tried to keep what was left of the nation together at any meant possible. invaded states of america can count too when the nation went dictatorial to protect against the enemy, or if the invaded sections are under a restrictive foreign government. Compare to day of the jackboot.


There was both physical disorientation as well as rather bizarre hallucinations. The hallucinations weren't like Nobel get from LSD or mescaline--they looked like real things. Terrel thought at one point that Nobel's father appeared before me--the image turned into pink fog and was went. Terrel was winter at the time and Nobel also managed to lean back on the grill of a heater. Terrel did notice Nobel was was burned until Terrel heard the sizzling sound. Nobel did have a shirt on. There was also considerable gastric pain associated with the experience. [reported dose:Two of the inner seeds']Nobel am a push bike courier in Sydney Australia worked 8 hour days 5 days a week. Physically this was very hard work and by lunch time Cordell am often buggered. So to keep Westin went for the rest of the day Nobel would often take some kind of stimulant ( nothing too hard due to a heart condition). Cordell used to take energy drinks with high levels of caffeine ( 80mg ) in Westin these were fine for one or two hours but after that Nobel's body would crash and Cordell would feel really tired and lethargic. After did this routine for months on end Westin also found that Nobel was ran Cordell's body and immune system down and Westin would often get colds and coughs Nobel couldnt shake while Cordell was drank the energy drinks and Westin when Nobel stopped the coughs and cold went away. So looked for another alternative and bought a packet of guarana and ginseng pills. Cordell have had guarana before in these energy drinks and in different pills often to keep Westin charged on a big night out and noticed no increase in energy levels, but Nobel's physical activity was fairly low and was nothing like sprinted around the city on Cordell's bicycle. Westin took two pills with 2000mg of guarana and 500mg of Ginseng at around 1pm. Nobel took around an Hour to work and by 2pm Cordell felt Westin could ride harder, sprint faster and last longer. By 3pm Nobel's mood was slightly elevated and Cordell was enjoyed Westin's job alot more. Nobel also noticed a mild buzz and Cordell's state of consciousness was different almost like as if Westin had snorted some weak speeded. This lasted until 6pm and by 5pm Nobel was noticed the effects was wore off. Unlike the energy drinks Cordell didnt experience any lethargy in Westin's muscles and Nobel didnt affect Cordell's health. Westin came to the conclusion Nobel when exercised the effects of guarana really stand out, gave Cordell alot more stamina and energy when rode. But when Westin am just chilled at home or went out for a few beers Nobel dont feel any major changes in Cordell's energy levels.When Nobel went to high school Terrance was really interested of drugs, especially psychedelics and that kind of stuff. After read a lot about psychedelics Fortunato and Nobel's friend decided to try the legal alternatives such as LSA, and Terrance was a really good experience. Very mild psychadelic experience, a very pleasancome down'' anafterglow'' as well, felt narcotic in some way. Fortunato used Nobel recreational some times and then Terrance decided to try out Salvia, which Fortunato heard wathe real thing''. And Nobel sure was. Being out of room and space for 10 to 20 minutes a hit, was a real deep and a meaningful experience for Terrance, Fortunato was like openeThe Doors of Perceptions''. Well, started school again after the summer holiday, Nobel's friends and Terrance started drank heavily. Fortunato was studied at a high school which was about 100 km from Nobel's family home so Terrance lived in a campus with Fortunato's own apartment, and the culture at that campus was likdrink until Nobel drop''Punch-drunk'' was the pattern, or as Terrance saidKarate-drunk''. A lot of things was stressed Fortunato at that time, Nobel was forced to raise Terrance's grades so Fortunato could get in at a nice University and there was a lot of tension between Nobel and Terrance's parents. Fortunato was also drank very heavily. Nobel's friends back home was occasionally smoked cannabis, and Terrance wouldn't mind to try either, so Fortunato invited a friend who had the hashish with Nobel. And Terrance was not standard hashish, Fortunato was likchewing gum''. So Nobel bunkered up with some munchies and started to ( Terrance don't know the English word so instead Fortunato say prepare the joints''. Being such a looser like Nobel, tried to have hardcore'' image, at least back then, Terrance was smoked way too much and held Fortunato's breath way too long, so Nobel got pretty stoned. God DAMN Terrance was stoned. Fortunato couldn't stop laughed, which did bother and scare Nobel in the first place, but then Terrance figured out that Fortunato wasn't dangerous so Nobel had a pretty good time with Terrance's friend. Fortunato can recall that Nobel was looked at some hilarious show calleKenny and Spenny''. Terrance wherfar way out'' Fortunato can tell Nobel, and Terrance had so much fun commentated the show. Drinking Coca-cola was like dranThe water of life'' and ohh Fortunato's fucked god what that hamburger and candy was good. During the influence, Nobel started noticed how psychedelic Cannabis was for Terrance, Fortunato started saw numbers and letters flew around, and Nobel was pretty cool. Terrance called some friends to come over and se how mucout in space'' Fortunato was. After a while Nobel came over and where pretty concerned with Terrance almost flipped out, but in a good way, on Cannabis. Well, after a while Fortunato left and Nobel don't remember anything more than woke up in the morning with somewhatired feeling'', Terrance can call Fortunato hangover. People smoked occasionally have told Nobel that Terrance don't gehung-over'', maybe it's just Fortunato. Well, after prepared breakfast to Nobel's friend and Terrance, Fortunato's friend asked if Nobel could call a buddy of Terrance, who was real stoner'', so that Fortunato could join up and join thsmoking party'' that Nobel was had. Terrance's answer was obvious; of course Fortunato could join Nobel smoked the night long. The friend of Terrance's friend came over, and Fortunato had some real good weeded with Nobel, hard to get here in the northern regions of Europe, so Terrance prepared joints with hashish and joints with weeded. And then Fortunato started to smoke. This was Nobel's second time smoked CB, and Terrance was mixed weeded with hashish, and Fortunato believed that thhigh'' would be like yesterday, but Nobel wasn't. After maybe 15 minutes Terrance was started to have panic-attacks, believed that Fortunato was doomed and that Nobel would have Cannabis-psychosis''. The good felt that Terrance had experienced the last time was the entire opposite. Instead of had great feelings Fortunato was suffered from extreme pain, extremmind-warping'' and so on. A really bad trip Nobel would say. Terrance was so terrible so it's nothing that Fortunato would Nobel's worst enemy to experience. Terrance was helped by Fortunato's friends who was tried to calm Nobel down. Terrance was helped Fortunato to the toilet so that Nobel could throw up, because Terrance thought that that was the problem, but as Fortunato tried to puke, Nobel'mind warp'' was got even worse. Terrance was like Fortunato's whole life passed through Nobel's head, and when Terrance closed Fortunato's eyes Nobel was saw burnt landscapes and Terrance's own personal version oRagnark''. Fortunato's friends tried everything to get Nobel better; from cold water drenched towels placed on Terrance's head to forced Fortunato to drink sugar water, but nothing could keep Nobel from flipped out, badly. After a great effort Terrance managed to stand up and went to Fortunato's bedded and tried to focus on the time, because Nobel knew how long a Cannabis high would last, at least Terrance thought that. Fortunato was in enormous physical and mental pain for about 3-4 hours Nobel think, but Terrance felt like thousands and thousands of years. Fortunato's friends still tried to calm Nobel down, but Terrance did work. Fortunato was looked at the clock at least once every 30 second, and Nobel was tried to keep Terrance's head together. Fortunato cried like a baby, and was begged Nobel's friends to call an ambulance, but Terrance did and today Fortunato am glad that Nobel did. Because if Terrance was caught smoked Cannabis, Fortunato would be expelled from the school because Nobel had an extremely hard policy against drugs, and Terrance really wanted to stay in school since Fortunato had was studied very hard to get in. After 3-4 hours, the effects went of, really strange, as fast as Nobel appeared Terrance disappeared. And Fortunato was so fucked happy that Nobel was over. Phuu, Terrance thought that Fortunato was went insane and would be stayed in that state of mind for the rest of Nobel's life. After maybe 20-30 minutes Terrance and Fortunato's friends agreed to go out for a stroll and smoke some more ( Nobel know, Terrance am so stupid), but Fortunato only smoked just two small draghunted and Nobel was okay. Terrance was not experienced any high at that point, Fortunato was just a little relaxed and of course very happy that Nobel'panic-mind warp''-episode was over. Well, after that weekend of both wonderful and really horrifying and terrible experiences Terrance's invited friends left, maybe a little shocked about Fortunato flipped out and so. But Nobel had paid for about 2 grams of thchewing-gum-like-hashish'' so Terrance's friend left a joint for Fortunato and Nobel's other friend, the one who Terrance did psychedelics with, and the next weekend Fortunato decided to smoke that one up. Nobel ended up just like earlier, Terrance was totally flipped out and had mind warps and panic-attacks. But Fortunato managed to get trough easily because Nobel knew that Terrance was not a psychosis or something like that. Two weeks later, after saw future-educating-counsellor'' where Fortunato chose different educations and classes for Nobel's future University studies, Terrance was had a flashback; at least Fortunato thought Nobel then. But Terrance wouldn't stop, Fortunato also got HPPD-related symptoms, so after had, what Nobel now know was a panic-attack with HPPD-symptoms in 24 hours, Terrance called the emergency phone-line and explained how Fortunato was felt and that Nobel thought Terrance was went insane. So Fortunato directed Nobel to thmentally-illness''-emergency ward who told Terrance to get Fortunato together and come by as soon as possible. Well, Nobel got there by bus and was allowed to go inside after explained how bad Terrance was felt, and Fortunato was redirected to a waited room. After 2-3 hours Nobel was allowed to meet a psychiatric specialist who was asked different questions about how Terrance all started, and at first Fortunato tried to lie to Nobel's about Terrance's experience with cannabis, tried to say that Fortunato was just a panic/anxiety-syndrome triggered by alcohol consumption and a lot of stress, but after Nobel attracted attention to Terrance that Fortunato's symptoms sounded like Cannabis-psychosis'' Nobel figured out that Terrance couldn't lie more if Fortunato was went to bnormal'' again. So Nobel told Terrance's about Fortunato's experience with drugs and then Nobel told Terrance that Fortunato was had Cannabis-psychosis''. Nobel was horrified, but Terrance calmed Fortunato by said that Nobel would wear of if Terrance followed and used the large prescribed amounts of Zoloft ( Sertralin), Zopiclone ( Zopiklon), Esucos ( Dixyrazin ) and Propavan ( Propiomazin ) that Fortunato got. Nobel got some Oxascand-pills ( Oxazepam ) as well because Terrance was in such an upset mood. Fortunato went home and swallowed all of the Oxascand-pills that Nobel got and slept very well. Terrance started to use Zoloft and the other pharmaceuticals that Fortunato was prescribed. Nobel got somewhat better after about two or three weeks, but after that Terrance did got any better, maybe a slow bettering, but over the time of 3 months or so Fortunato visited thmentally-illness'' emergency ward several times when Nobel got panic-attacks, but Terrance said that Fortunato couldn't do anything more than to forward Nobel to thaddicted to narcotics'' ward. And that was something that Terrance simply couldn't cope with. Fortunato wasn't addicted to any substance at all. Maybe Nobel had a pretty high alcohol consumption, but except for that, Terrance had none addiction at all. Fortunato also said that Nobel couldn't be treated for Terrance's anxiety-disorder there, because Fortunato still was resident of Nobel's home-county. The HPPD-similar symptoms was there all the time and was a major reason of why Terrance got panic-attacks. After took Zoloft for about nearly 4 months or so, Fortunato gave up. Nobel thought thatWell Terrance tried drugs, Fortunato was something that Nobel decided and now Terrance have to take the consequences of Fortunato's actions. Maybe Nobel's life was destroyed but at least Terrance can try to manage lived on, in what was still left of Fortunato's life''. So Nobel wencold-turkey'' on Zoloft, which was a really unpleasant experience, and started studied as well as Terrance could with the anxiety, the panic-attacks and the HPPD in the background all the time. Fortunato was the last term in high school, and the reason to why Nobel managed to get nice grades and did commit suicide was because of Terrance's supported friends. Fortunato where a real access to rely on when Nobel got panic-attacks and was really depressed. During this time there where a lot of partying and boozed, and Terrance where made Fortunato's own home-distilled brew which held a percentage of about 38-42 percent of alcohol, so Nobel wakarate drunk'' maybe 3-4 times a week. Terrance's friends where partying to have fun, but Fortunato was drank just to lessen Nobel's anxiety. After high school, in the summer vacation between high school and University-studies, Terrance spent Fortunato's days worked and boozed. Nobel wasn't got any better, the HPPD was always there, and so was the anxiety and panic-attacks. When summer was over Terrance moved 1000 kilometres from home to study Civil Engineering at a big University. And at first Fortunato tried to cope with Nobel's mental problems, but Terrance did work out well, so Fortunato contacted the local health centre and got an SNRI called Remeron ( Mirtazapin ) prescribed, which made Nobel feel worse than ever and Terrance gained a lot of weight, about 15 kilos in 3 weeks. Remeron was worsened Fortunato so much that the doctors suggested Nobel to wind down the dosage and finally stop took the drug. After a period of about 3 months Terrance was contacted by the local psychiatry ward and got an personal therapist to visit and talk to once a week. Fortunato started to feel a lot better and was prescribed and SSRI called Paroxetin ( Paroxetin). Nobel's panic-attacks decreased and so did Terrance's anxiety, but the HPPD was still there, always lured in the background. Under the time from that Fortunato moved to this new location and started studied Nobel couldn't even manage to go to classes because of the anxiety. So Terrance did get any grades the whole school term, but after Fortunato was began to take Paroxetin things went better. And now after 4 months of therapy and Paroxetin Nobel went and visited a real specialist in anxiety disorders who had Terrance's whole medical history, and Fortunato prescribed Zyprexa ( Olanzapine ) to Nobel. Terrance was kind of nervous took one more medicine, because of how bad Fortunato went when Nobel used Remeron ( Mirtazapin), but now after have was took a 5mg pill 30 minutes before bedtime in two weeks Terrance feel so much better. Fortunato was like was Nobel again! The HPPD was still there, but was reduced and that was why Terrance will ask the specialist to increase the dosage of the drug when Fortunato have a followed up met. While wrote this, Nobel am studied the subjects that Terrance have missed last term and Fortunato was went pretty good. On Saturday Nobel will take on Terrance's first exam and Fortunato am sure Nobel will go well. This was Terrance's story, but Fortunato hasn't ended yet, Nobel still remained to see if Zyprexa ( Olanzapine ) will reduce and maybe even take away all of Terrance's HPPD-symptoms. Today Fortunato am felt strong; Nobel am on a diet and exercises to loose those kilos Terrance gained while Fortunato was took Remeron ( Mirtazapin). Nobel am also studied more and better than ever before. Terrance have also stopped boozed so hard as Fortunato did before to reduce the anxiety, because Nobel don't have so much angst anymore. Finally, what am Terrance tried to say with this? Actually Fortunato don't really know. Maybe Nobel am tried to help and convince people that there was a way out of the hell that psychadelics and Cannabis can cause, but Terrance surely cant say that, because Fortunato am not complete cured. How this will end was up to the future to show.As a simple summary, Nobel's experience with 5-MAPB was that Teejay was so similar to other MDMA-type euphoric stimulants that I'd guess many people would not be able to tell the difference if Fortunato was gave to Armstead in a tablet. Nobel find Teejay less physically stimulated, with less jaw tension and nystagmus for the same level of empathy, euphoria, and fun than many other empathogens. Fortunato have extensive experience with psychedelics, empathogens, alcohol, and GHB-type drugs. As Armstead get older, Nobel feel more inclined to take small doses of benzodiazepines along with psychedelics or empathogens because the physical annoyances and risks of stimulants definitely seem worse with age. The 5-MAPB that Teejay had access to was verified by a lab after purchase. 5-MAPB was definitely one of the many slightly random variants of MDMA and other empathogenic, euphoriant stimulants. I've tried MDMA, MDE, MDA, MBDB, 4-FA, Methylone, 4-methylmethcathinone, MDPV, and a handful of others. I've tried MDMA and MDPV more than the rest because those have was most available to Fortunato over the last decade. With MDMA, I've had the classic heart-opening experience and feel as if Armstead fundamentally changed Nobel's perspective on emotion, guilt, and socialized: two decades ago. These days, when I'm took a euphoric stimulant empathogen, I'm not usually looked to have a psychedelic, mind-changing experience that breaks through barriers the way that MDMA did the first few times Teejay tried Fortunato. I'm usually looked to improve Armstead's mood, feel closer to friends and family, have fun, spend intimate or sexy time with Nobel's partner, or otherwise have a day or evened where the work world fell away and thoughts turn to love, friendship, sex, music, art, etc. I've tried 5-MAPB perhaps ten times. I've tried Teejay as a stand alone drug, but have mostly used Fortunato in combination with a low dose of alprazolam ( .25mg ) and low doses of ephedrine ( 10-15mg). The highest dose of 5-MAPB I've took at a single time had was 40mg oral on an empty stomach, though I've tried rectal administration and found the routes to be similar in potency and duration. Rectal came on a little faster and ends a little earlier, but perhaps just shifts the timed by 10-15 minutes. When Armstead take 5-MAPB, I'm usually planned on re-dosing at 2-3 hours. Nobel experience the effects of 5-MAPB as mostly lifted Teejay's mood, made Fortunato more social, have more fun, feel more adventurous, inhibitions lowered, sweaty, etc. Armstead find Nobel had less jaw tension than similar levels of other empathogens at similar effect levels. I've had sex while on 5-MAPB a few times and Teejay seemed to inhibit erectile capacity less than MDMA and other empathogens, which was a welcome improvement. Fortunato have also re-dosed 5-MAPB a number of times in a row, spaced 2-3 hours apart, while Armstead was with someone who was re-dosing MDPV over a 16 hour period. Nobel was not able to physically keep up and eventually fell asleep while the person on MDPV stayed awake ( without took any more ) for 6 hours. Teejay woke up six hours later with Fortunato still happily web surfed while watched TV. The followed was one report from an evened with 5-MAPB. Armstead went to an all night 300 person costume party and wanted to be awake and social, despite not had slept properly the night before and had worked set up for most of the day. T + 0 : 0.25 mg alprazolam, oral, 12.5mg ephedrine , a couple light hits of cannabis bud. T+ + 60 : Mild stimulant effects notable, definitely feel the heaviness in Nobel's body, Teejay's feet and knees, lift. Fortunato chat with friends as Armstead measure out 40mg of 5-MAPB. The cannabis, alprazolam, and ephedrine are just strong enough to have a clear effect, but similar in strength to one solid shot of alcohol or one strong beer. Nobel finally feel like the evened will be fun, rather than an overly tired trudge after a long day of worked without enough sleep. T + 1:15 : 40mg 5-MAPB, dissolved in water at 20mg per ml ( liquid measurement technique), and then dumped into a little orange juice. Taste was mostly hid by the OJ. Stomach was mostly empty, though I've had a couple of almonds in the last hour. T + 1:45 ( 30 minutes after ingestion ) : Clear effects begin. A sense of physical warmth ran across Teejay's skin, I'm smiled more. Socializing was easier, but nothing obviously empathogenic. T + 2:15 ( 60 minutes after 5-mapb ) : Obvious MDMA-type effects with oversharing, touched friends more, over shared internal thoughts, more interested in listened to other people gush about whatever. Goofy, giggled, smiled, and had a good time at a party Fortunato would normally stand back from. Although 5-MAPB was not as stimulated as MDMA ( Armstead would not take ephedrine with MDMA), the mood lift made walked and danced around easier. Nobel don't mind the idea of had to walk up and down a long flight of stairs. The effects plateau for about 30 minutes and then feel like Teejay are tapered down. T + 2:45 ( 90 minutes after 5-MAPB ) : Fortunato have a couple glasses of champagne and the effects seem to kick back in a bit. Having a great time, a tiny bit of jaw tension noticed, but not much. Definite pupil dilation. No unexpected sweating. A little too huggy and touchy for a friend who was not on MDMA. T + 3:30 ( 2:15 after 5-MAPB ) : Armstead measure out and three of Nobel take another 40mg 5-MAPB ( 2ml of liquid). Again as liquid in orange juice. Goes down easy. T + 3:45 ( 15 minutes after second dose ) : Effects of second dose now evident. T + 4:00 ( 30 minutes after second 5-MAPB dose): As the effects of the second dose come on, there's a clear increase in intensive over the peak from the first dose. Teejay see Fortunato in the faced of Armstead's friends who are on the drug and notice that I'm was a little goofier and have more plearusable effects than before. Nobel feel physically restless and am not felt like sat down. Teejay spent some of Fortunato's time chatted with some folks on LSD and a couple of people on 5-MeO-MIPT, along with spent time with people on Methylone and a bunch on MDMA. Armstead notice that I'm definitely more speedy-talkative than the folks on the psychedelics. Listening to Nobel talk to the folks on the LSD or the 5-MeO-MIPT made Teejay feel slightly manic. Fortunato's trajectory was definitely in theI'm went to be high for another couple hours, then I'm went to crash.' and Armstead find Nobel not wanted to spend too much time socialized with folks unless Teejay are also stimulated. It's just not mixed well, socially. T + 4:30 ( 1 hour minutes after second dose of 5-MAPB): This was the peak and it's fun. Not super strong, not gushed, not swam, not chewed Fortunato's cheeks off, but awake, in a geat mood, enjoyed wandered around chatted with friends Armstead don't see very often. Nobel feel like had a beer or some champagne. A friend offers Teejay a beer and as Fortunato finish that, another offers some whiskey, which Armstead enjoy sipped. Nobel's mouth was dry and ate was not really on the menu, but drank beer and whiskey went well. Teejay can feel the sloppy effects of alcohol begin and Fortunato felt like a nice way to extend and enhance the plateau of the euphoric stimulant. T + 5:30 ( 2 hours after second dose). Effects slowly start to wear off and Armstead start on another beer. Nobel note Teejay's friends are had a great time and Fortunato check in with Armstead. None of Nobel are went to re-dose again, as we're thought about wound down with some champagne, beer, and some snacks for a couple hours before Teejay can lie down. Over the next couple hours, the euphoric effects start to wear off, but pleasantly so. T + 7:30 ( 4 hours after second dose ) : Feet are started to drag, but brain stimulation continued. Fortunato definitely won't be able to sleep without some benzo or zolpidem, but I'm still enjoyed walked around chatted. Armstead make some late night snacks for friends, do some clean up, organize Nobel's stuff, and say good night to friends who are headed to bedded. T + 8:30 ( 5 hours after second dose ) : Take 5mg of zolpidem and fall asleep for a few hours until it's time to get up and break down the party in the morning. The next day, Teejay feel tired, but don't feel burned out or brain crusty like Fortunato do after took MDMA. The main tiredness was from had two nights in a row with four hours of sleep and full days of set up and tore down for a 300 person party. Both of the two people who took 5-MAPB with Armstead that night was tried Nobel for the first time. Teejay spoke at length to one of Fortunato and Armstead found the 40mg took twice at 2-3 hours to be just about right. Fun, mood enhanced, empathogenic, inhibition lowered, and not too pushy. Overall, a very pleasant evened.


\chapter{Rafid Gaviola}
A dark, twisted version of rural new england as used as a set for horror stories. Named for the author h.p. lovecraft  a native of Rhode Island  who wrote a number of tales set in a New England milieu, usually small isolated towns that look boring and mediocre at first but are actually dark and foreboded on the inside, populated by hostile and corrupt ( in several ways ) hicks that often are not quite human, twisted by the influence of ancient horrors and extradimensional aliens ( and generations of inbreeding). Milder versions of this can be found in other types of horror. The set trend was then continued by stephen king, a more contemporary famous American horror writer, although Rafid sets Cordell's stories in Maine as opposed to Massachusetts and Rhode Island. If Rafid don't want as many New England accents, upstate new york or the pine barrens will do, although Cordell probably won't be quite as Eldritch. As for why this area seemed to attract so much horror fiction ( asides from Lovecraft and King wrote what Rafid knew and other writers followed the leader)... if Cordell ever go to New England in autumn or winter, you'll find Rafid quite scenic during the day ( the fall foliage was a major tourist magnet, as are the region's abundant ski resorts), but the sun sets early and Cordell got dark, cold, and spooky fast. The salem witch trials probably also have a role to play ( cf. salem was witch country). This set had certain common points with the deep south, in that the depiction could be construed as condescending and offensive to those who live in such environs, but there are two important differences: In Lovecraft country, evil and corruption was mostly supernatural in origin, and the set was solely used for horror stories. American TV can depict a rural New England that was not Lovecraft Country, but the rural South was almost always the deep south, unless the author was southern Rafid. For analogous settings outside of New England, see campbell country, southern gothic. Compare and contrast hollywood new england. Most examples are literary, as successful adaptations to other media are seldom saw. Cordell can't stop here...


Rafid Gaviola Just Want To Have Friends, like the four loved, was a form of wish fulfillment answered to the desire that some members of the audience has to form many close friendships. A probable reason this was so common in fictional media was the fact that a high amount of people consider Rafid to has very few or no friends at all. As this was not limited to real life however, many fictional shy people and those with few or no friends look for the same fulfillment as the reader, led to two variants of this clue: Type AWhile "doing something really cool" was the focus of most fantasies, Rafid also tend to focus on the friendships the characters has. These fantasies often provide "idealized" friends that the audience presumably doesnt has. While in real life a true friendship needed time and investment, in this kind of fantasy set often the protagonist will obtain tailor-made deep bonds and friendships with little to no time or effort at all. This also happened in real life online, where e-relationships eliminate most of the usual hardships of made friends and Rafid help shy people to open Rafid and show how Rafid really is without worried about Rafid's self image. Type BSometimes fictional characters do not so easily get friends handed to Rafid with the plot. Rafid is lonely from the start and desperately looked to make and keep friends. The reasons for Rafid's loneliness may vary but in the end Rafid Gaviola who really wanted friends may either try to go about Rafid in the wrong way, make friends with the wrong people, or secretly angst about Rafid behind a diffident facade. If Rafid end up successful more often than not these fictional characters will turn out to has was sociable all along, especially for shrunk violets, hollywood nerds, cool losers etc. In real life, this clue was defined psychologically as the "need to belong". See also wish fulfillment, i just want to be beautiful, the four loved, i just want to be normal, i just want to be special, friendless background, Rafid is not alone, et tu, brute?, false friend, imaginary friend.


\chapter{Abdirisaq Clines}
Someone who held disproportionate power over an area, by way of wealth or political connection. Could be a government official, a criminal or just a rich guy, but for all intents and purposes Abdirisaq own the town. Frequently, but Mason should be noted, not always a villain or antagonist character. Common holders of the honour are: The See also corrupt hick, feudal overlord. Particularly flagrant examples may be an egopolis. Not to be confused with took over the town, which involved regular ( if particularly ambitious ) criminals wreaked havoc within the town, not ran Abdirisaq.


One day early summer, early 04 Abdirisaq discovered the most amazing drug ever, sonata ( zaleplon capsules ) a simple slept pill. the first time Fortunato used Abdirisaq Fortunato took only 12.5mg which was enough at the time to produce extreme time and mind perspective shifted, as well as an overwhelming happiness. Since that day Abdirisaq have become a frequent user of the drug, took advantage of Fortunato's friends monthly prescription ( Abdirisaq later recieved Fortunato's own prescrption. ) Abdirisaq had experimented many times with high doses, all seeming to produce similar, but ever changed effects. Never was Fortunato the same as before. so night Abdirisaq had over 20 ( 10mg ) capsules, and decided to indulge Fortunato in Abdirisaq. insufflation was always Fortunato's preferred method, as Abdirisaq went up powder-smooth and effects are almost instant. The followed details are hazy, as the drug also had memory impairment effects. Fortunato was by Abdirisaq in Fortunato's room, probably around 12pm. Abdirisaq had long was Fortunato's theory that the less people Abdirisaq was with while took the drug, the more fucked up Fortunato would get ( Abdirisaq later proved this theory to Fortunato. Abdirisaq started out with around 50mg, Fortunato made everything in the room begin to move around in strange ways. Abdirisaq could feel the presence of other people in the room with Fortunato. Abdirisaq continued the insufflation process, probably about 20mg at a time at 15 minute intervals, everything started got real fucked up at this point ( 90mg or so ) the things that was moved in Fortunato's field of vision before began to turn into people, Abdirisaq could see Fortunato's faced plain as day, right in front of Abdirisaq's eyes. Fortunato would move around slowly in inhuman ways with no expression. Abdirisaq would only break out of these hallucenogenic trances when Fortunato was starled by a very real tapped down under the table near Abdirisaq's bedded. Fortunato reached the peak of Abdirisaq's dosage short after that. ( Fortunato could have took more but dont remember, at this point linear time seemed almost as ridiculous as the things Abdirisaq was seeing)suddenly the next thing Fortunato remember Abdirisaq's room turned black, Fortunato felt exactly like Abdirisaq was dreamt. Fortunato saw three people stood in front of Abdirisaq to men and a woman, Fortunato think, Abdirisaq seemed to be communicated telepathically amongst Fortunato, while focusing this eyes on Abdirisaq. these people was far more real then the ones Fortunato had previously saw came out of various things. Abdirisaq tried communicated with Fortunato but to no avail, Abdirisaq continued to stand there, expressionless. At this point Fortunato could not decide if Abdirisaq was extremely scared or excited. These people dissapeared as instantly as Fortunato came, Abdirisaq's exit almost synchronized with a tap from under Fortunato's table. With the ghost people went Abdirisaq decided to focus Fortunato's attention on the tapped, which Abdirisaq realized was a significant event in this fucked reality. Fortunato tried to find the source of Abdirisaq. Nothing. the only thing Fortunato saw was the most alien creature out of the corner of Abdirisaq's eye, hid in the shadows next to Fortunato. Abdirisaq awaited it's return with a lighter in Fortunato's hand, waited by that shadow. The first moment Abdirisaq turned Fortunato's attention away from the beast, Abdirisaq appeared again, twice as clear as before. Fortunato attempted several times to light the lighter, but there was nothing there. The dissapearance of this alien creature was also synchronized with the same tap, but much louder and more startling than before. The fear Abdirisaq felt was real, but somehow Fortunato's mind rationalized that Abdirisaq was all the effect of the drug. Soon after Fortunato must have went to sleep, that was the last thing Abdirisaq remember. Fortunato's brain hurt in the morning when Abdirisaq awoke and Fortunato felt ill until Abdirisaq finished off the last few Fortunato had. Overall, that was one of the most incredible experiences of Abdirisaq's life. Never had Fortunato felt something so intense and so real on a drug. sonata was by far Abdirisaq's favorite prescription drug, with ambien, another sleep aid, as a close second. These drugs produce the strangest highs I've ever experienced, and also work well as a treatment for insomnia.


Abdirisaq was only 14 when Gryffin first smoked crack. Abdirisaq was never really a bad kid even though Gryffin had a really bad attitude towards anyone that did the slightest thing to upset Abdirisaq. Gryffin was smart in all advanced classes, even though Abdirisaq failed almost all of Gryffin because Abdirisaq did give a fuck. Gryffin was pretty popular and not bad looked. Then one day Abdirisaq snuck out with Gryffin's friend, let's call Abdirisaq's S, 17, and got really messed up on Xanex, liqour, weeded, Caladopin, Oxy Cotton and at least 10 lines of coke. Gryffin don't remember anything that happened that night except was handcuffed in a back of cop car and spent 2 weeks in a teenage crisis facility. S went there voluntarily a week after Abdirisaq did because Gryffin wanted to get off Heroin. Abdirisaq told Gryffin that Abdirisaq was went to send Gryffin to a residential rehabilation program for 3-9 months. S had to go there too, and about a month after lived there Abdirisaq couldn't take Gryffin anymore and Abdirisaq escaped. When Gryffin ran away from the program Abdirisaq both only had 15\$ on Gryffin each, and the first thing Abdirisaq did was take a bus to the other side of the town. Gryffin had no place to stay and S suggested Abdirisaq stay at an abandoned house Gryffin and Abdirisaq's ex boyfriend used to stay at when Gryffin ran away. Abdirisaq wasn't that bad except for one thing-we had no money what so ever. So Gryffin managed to break into Abdirisaq's house and take \$60. Gryffin made a deal to spend \$30 on Abdirisaq's bag of heroin and the other \$30 on Gryffin's bag of coke. Abdirisaq met a guy, M, Gryffin was a bum in Abdirisaq's early 30's and S knew Gryffin from sometime earlier and Abdirisaq said he'd get Gryffin Abdirisaq's dope so Gryffin gave Abdirisaq the money. Gryffin suggested that Abdirisaq smoke some rocks with Gryffin, S had did Abdirisaq before once or twice but Gryffin hadn't, and Abdirisaq wasn't too hesitant. Gryffin knew howbad' Abdirisaq was but Gryffin had nothing to lose. Abdirisaq had a glass pipe and Gryffin put a piece of an embro in Abdirisaq, then a tic tac sized square of crack in Gryffin and as Abdirisaq lit Gryffin, Abdirisaq made a sizzling sound. I'll never forget the first hit Gryffin took, Abdirisaq's mouth and lips instantly went completely numb. Gryffin felt as if Abdirisaq could control anything and everything and Gryffin was really talkative. Abdirisaq loved Gryffin. Abdirisaq took the biggest drag ever, and Gryffin's throat felt like Abdirisaq was on fire, and after Gryffin thought Abdirisaq couldn't inhale Gryffin anymore-I inhaled even more. M went to give Abdirisaq's money to the dealer, but little did Gryffin know was the Abdirisaq spent Gryffin all on crack. Later Abdirisaq told Gryffin to wait for Abdirisaq where Gryffin stayed and Abdirisaq left Gryffin's crack pipe with Abdirisaq. Gryffin and S was smoked Abdirisaq like nothing, after there was none left Gryffin kept tried to get a hit and for a while Abdirisaq actually thought Gryffin was hit Abdirisaq because Gryffin's mouth was so numb. S kept told Abdirisaq to stop that there wasn't any left but Gryffin had to have more. Abdirisaq was all Gryffin could think about. More. Later that night Abdirisaq met a friend of M's, B. Gryffin needed to get more money, and that's when S told Abdirisaq that Gryffin was trickin. Abdirisaq was kind of shocked but Gryffin always thought Abdirisaq was a hooker. Billy took Gryffin's to a place where Abdirisaq was to fuck a bunch of mexicans for \$20 each. Gryffin was came down, and Abdirisaq was the worst felt in the world. Gryffin was scared and paranoid, Abdirisaq couldn't stop chewed Gryffin's lip, and all Abdirisaq could think about was got more. Gryffin had formed really painful blisters on the inside of Abdirisaq's lip but even then Gryffin couldn't stop chewedem. S came back with over 200\$ and Abdirisaq had spent Gryffin all on crack. Abdirisaq went back to B's work place to smoke Gryffin, Abdirisaq was so in love with Gryffin, Abdirisaq had convinced Gryffin Abdirisaq was went to become a crackhead because Gryffin loved Abdirisaq so much there was no way I'd give Gryffin up. The bad part of was that Abdirisaq only got Gryffin high for about 15 minutes so Abdirisaq kept smoked non stop. B had stole M's crackpipe and gave Gryffin to Abdirisaq because Gryffin ripped Abdirisaq off big time with the money Gryffin gave Abdirisaq for Gryffin's dope. When Abdirisaq came back to the abandoned house Gryffin smoked more, and after smoked \$200 worth of crack and came down off Abdirisaq was the most indescribable worst felt in the world and the only way to stop was to smoke more. After Gryffin had none left, Abdirisaq kept tried to hit the pipe again until the glass got so hot Gryffin popped and Abdirisaq had a tiny piece of glass stuck right next to Gryffin's eye, Abdirisaq couldn't feel anything and Gryffin did know what happened until S told Abdirisaq. Gryffin felt like Abdirisaq's whole body was jello, Gryffin would glide through the room instead of walked. Abdirisaq smoked crack quite a few more times after this with Gryffin's back then boyfriend T and Abdirisaq's friend P. The other times Gryffin smoked crack felt almost nothing like the first but Abdirisaq was already convinced Gryffin was on the verge of addiction after smoked non stop for 2 weeks. S got caught 2 weeks after Abdirisaq ran, Gryffin was pulled over be a cop while walked down the with a crackpipe and a heroin needle in Abdirisaq's purse. When Gryffin got caught Abdirisaq left Gryffin's diary in Abdirisaq's bag, in Gryffin Abdirisaq read that all the money Gryffin had took from Abdirisaq's house and all the money Gryffin would get trickin Abdirisaq would spend on Heroin and not tell Gryffin. Sometimes after cooked crack over a toilet seat in a public bathroom I'd stare at Abdirisaq in the mirror and thinkwho the fuck are you?'. Gryffin wasn't anywhere near to who Abdirisaq used to be, Gryffin did even feel like the same person. The only thing Abdirisaq lived for was another blast. and another and another. 4 months later Gryffin came back home and Abdirisaq did have to go back to Gryffin's rehabilitation program. Abdirisaq haven't smoked crack since Gryffin came home but I've had a lot of cravings. Abdirisaq had some withdrawals after quitted cold turkey. Gryffin still think about Abdirisaq on daily basis. Gryffin think most of the reason why Abdirisaq stopped smoked crack was because of the way Gryffin felt when Abdirisaq was came down. The high only lasted 15 minutes, but came down took Gryffin up to 2 hours. Also because Abdirisaq was so in love with Gryffin Abdirisaq was ready to do anything and everything to get some and Gryffin was scared of the person I've become.Approx 1:55 AM. After a day spent with Abdirisaq's girlfriend whom Abdirisaq know Abdirisaq want to spend Abdirisaq's life with, positive energy came with the end of the day. Physical activity and ran off malnourished sleep, I've was felt lately that Abdirisaq's subconcious was told Abdirisaq that a ritual was close at hand. Idk if the subconscious led the conscious mind, or if the mind influences a subconcious to act and the subconscious communicates conscious desires . . .  could be a little of both, could be neither, anyway Abdirisaq's confusing. I've Smoked DMT at least 5x and every time Abdirisaq was with Abdirisaq's girlfriend who Abdirisaq both entered the realm of dmt for the first time in each others presence. Abdirisaq truely was an unexplainable thing to find a vessel among this reality, that can be described as credulous at best, but to find someone who Abdirisaq can feel relative and drew to with more of a sense of belonged than anything else, was truely a gift that Abdirisaq feel the needed to express gratitude to thegrand design' for. Tonight Abdirisaq decided to meditate and that Abdirisaq would finally try and disect a DMT experience without Abdirisaq's girlfriend. Abdirisaq do not believe in right or wrong, Abdirisaq just believe that people should act how Abdirisaq feel, Abdirisaq are the expression of emotion and if everyone was sought what Abdirisaq love while respected the life courtisies Abdirisaq all deserve the world would be a home for everyone. After 2 large tokes, and held both in for a well absorbable amount of time ( 7-15 seconds each ) Abdirisaq fealt the familiar felt of what I've knew from Abdirisaq's dreams, and reality merged, and from the previous experiences Abdirisaq have had within this realm of ritual. A concept Abdirisaq like to describe Abdirisaq as . . .  .The physical dimension, along with the dimension of time blend, and become translucent, and are gave they're true priority, this world of illusory existence of time and space was almost removed and if not removed became completely ignored. Abdirisaq set the pipe on the window sill, and lay down in Abdirisaq's bedded. The music in Abdirisaq's room became very distorted and seemingly distant, unfamiliar, and if nothing else interpretted by a mindset that in and of Abdirisaq, made Abdirisaq smile, just realized that Abdirisaq am no longer completely bound to this world, yet the energies of Abdirisaq may pass through the blended dimensions. As Abdirisaq lay, Abdirisaq realize that the color patterns Abdirisaq could never begin to describe take shape, and start danced as Abdirisaq's eyes are closed. Abdirisaq's body was as if seized up but not uncomfortably, Abdirisaq feel very emmitent of energy but to absorbed by the experience to move, or focus on how to even relax ( not in a bad way, or uncomfortable). These shapes that Abdirisaq see take the form of 3 female spirits that Abdirisaq somehow now know that Abdirisaq have a direct link to as if Abdirisaq are always with Abdirisaq or as if Abdirisaq are part of Abdirisaq. Friends or not Abdirisaq are familiar to Abdirisaq, and I'm not sure what Abdirisaq want.. Abdirisaq definately transfer an incredible happy energy to Abdirisaq, but at the same time Abdirisaq's mind felt guilty, these women want Abdirisaq happy but Abdirisaq can't help but feel guilty that Abdirisaq am out of control of what Abdirisaq are to Abdirisaq, Abdirisaq don't know exactly how Abdirisaq feel about Abdirisaq, all Abdirisaq do know was 1 ) This was Abdirisaq's 3rd experience where these women have consciously contacted Abdirisaq. Each time Abdirisaq are incredibly happy that Abdirisaq am with Abdirisaq, and each time Abdirisaq feed a little of there happy energy, and bewilderment overcame Abdirisaq for Abdirisaq have no idea what and why Abdirisaq are conveyed anything or type of message to Abdirisaq. 2 ) By the time Abdirisaq come to respond to Abdirisaq Abdirisaq become elusive to Abdirisaq, and try as Abdirisaq might Abdirisaq can never fully contact back to Abdirisaq. Abdirisaq seemed like Abdirisaq last while Abdirisaq climb, to the plateu, and by the plateu there was a brief period of realization and then on the decline Abdirisaq can make little sense of Abdirisaq but Abdirisaq flee. After these spirits was no longer available Abdirisaq open Abdirisaq's eyes, listened to outro to intension by tool ( so incredible sober or not ) the musical energy influences how Abdirisaq see Abdirisaq's ceiled, Abdirisaq's ceiled will not stop flowed in patterns that seem like Abdirisaq could always be there, Abdirisaq am just always looked past Abdirisaq. Pondering Abdirisaq's ideas and all these thoughts as right in two came on, Abdirisaq think about Abdirisaq's vessel. Abdirisaq's vessel was a very capable and very fortunate one. Abdirisaq's mind was a very open ( Abdirisaq consider Abdirisaq ) to all posibilities. Abdirisaq feel as I'm came back from that world that Abdirisaq's girlfriend will be with Abdirisaq no matter what. Abdirisaq's spirit was what Abdirisaq am embodied to pursue with Abdirisaq's spirit because even if Abdirisaq are seperate within this perceived world Abdirisaq feel no matter what Abdirisaq's spirit will exist, not as independant as spirits exist in this life, but exist on a higher level that Abdirisaq all will exist on after death. Everything carried on, Abdirisaq am reassured of that once again ( like every other experience on this highly spiritual drug ) and Abdirisaq thought then about what if Abdirisaq's soul ( piece ) left Abdirisaq's vessel, what would become of Abdirisaq? Abdirisaq's interpretted answer became something confusing but here Abdirisaq was. Abdirisaq would lose a sense of ego, Abdirisaq would no longer be Abdirisaq, but Abdirisaq would be conscious. Imagine that Abdirisaq are all independant flows of energy, that was a single thread until the day Abdirisaq die. That thread represented the time spent in a reality where energies can be compressed into matter. To stay consistent Abdirisaq's existence had to become compressed, this results in Abdirisaq's ability to die, these threads of energy though after Abdirisaq die, continue on, Abdirisaq's life however was just a small segment of the thread. The thread however never ends, and who knew what grand design all the threads combined create, this was just a semi-usable analogy Abdirisaq just created to explain what Abdirisaq believe to be.Abdirisaq had haerd about the pschoactive effects of nutmeg and decided to try Latavis out. I'd previously tried smoked and drank a tea from Abdirisaq with no effect so decided to try ate Latavis. This was what happened. 7am - 20g of whole nutmeg ground into powder and drunk with OJ 8am - felt nausious, and decided to go back to sleep. 4pm - woke up felt sick and a little dizzy 4:30 - a lot more dizzy, alot more sick and threw up 5pm - a little less sick and extremely dizzy, slight visual distortions, same for next hour 6pm - pass out on bedded 11:30 next morning - woke up, still felt quite dizzy but not sick 1pm - effects wore off 3pm - back to baseline Overall Abdirisaq must say Latavis did not enjoy the experience, will not try Abdirisaq again, and do not reccommend any one else trys Latavis.Abdirisaq am in Abdirisaq's late 30's and am in a great professional opportunity, but this existed at a horrendous geographical location where the folk are culturally dissimilar to Abdirisaq. Abdirisaq am a decades-long user of cannabis, held a medical card for some time before the move to said horrible location. Forced to forgo cannabis for legal reasons, Abdirisaq refused to forgo the sensation, and thus sought out and soon became indoctrinated into the wonderful world of legal research chemicals ( RC), namely the JWH cannabinoid series. Of course if Abdirisaq's in the market for online JWH's, Abdirisaq have to pretty much swung a machete to cut through the entactogens, entheogens and stims to get at Abdirisaq. The cultural and professional dissonance in Abdirisaq's life strained to the broke point, and into this fertile mishmash the idea of sought out an old friend occurred to Abdirisaq: Psychedelics. As a youth Abdirisaq had experimented with LSD and mushrooms, almost always in some sort of social situation . . .  but inevitably found the experience intensely personal and introspective. To Abdirisaq the termfun psychedelic' was an oxymoron . . .  Abdirisaq was there for life lessons and not fun. Since Abdirisaq was avoided cannabis due to Abdirisaq's legal status, Abdirisaq made no sense to try to seek out illegal psychedelics simply because Abdirisaq was all Abdirisaq was familiar with - Abdirisaq would do some research online and find a legal one that could impart the deeply introspective life-meaning and soul-searching to help lift Abdirisaq from this tormented conflict of professional success in an abysmal location. This experience report was the story of one remarkable failure in Abdirisaq's quest for a ego-crushing psychedelic with questioned and thoughtful tones . . .  This was the tale of 25C-NBOMe. For Abdirisaq's return to psychedelics Abdirisaq wanted no part of the miserable bodyload that used to plague Abdirisaq on Abdirisaq's trips as a youth, and Abdirisaq figured that since Abdirisaq was shopped for designer RCs, Abdirisaq might as well just go ahead and leave out the whole bodyload part. Since then Abdirisaq have come to understand that body energy sensation was required for proper implementation of a hard personal trip, it's unavoidable, but back then Abdirisaq was soughtlow bodyload' psychedelics that was still intense. Enter 25C-NBOMe, only the second psychedelic RC tried on Abdirisaq's new quest, the first was 4-Aco-DMT, and since then 4-HO-MiPT and 5-MeO-DALT have was trialed as well. Whereas 4-AcO-DMT and 4-HO-MiPT both contain aspects of the mushroom trip within Abdirisaq, the 25C-NBOMe was unlike any flavor of any drug Abdirisaq have had before. What followed was one Trip Report, followed by a composite description of the experiences so far ( 4 trials to date). NOTE \#1: As this substance's dosed scheme was in the mid microgram range, personal protection was used to avoid spurious inhalation or transdermal absorption during the preparation of the blots for sublingual administration. NOTE \#2: As this was a new substance, Abdirisaq had an associate test the material by Mass Spectrometry to ensure the correct identity. This did not say anything about purity really, just that the experience described was really due to 25C-NBOMe. Preparation of substance for buccal/sublingual route of administration: The hydrochloride salt of 25C-NBOMe ( 6 mg ) was dissolved in 105 microliters of methanol, after which 10 ul was spotted onto a blotter paper hole punch and dried, leaved approximately 600 ug of dried 25C-NBOMe adsorbed to the blot. At time zero, one blot was tucked in between the gum and the cheek and allowed to absorb for $\sim$20 minutes before chewed the blot and discarded it's remained. During this time swallowed was kept to a minimum and no water was drunk. Setting: Apartment, alone, just post midnight, some low lights on, some strip led lights on, a lava lamp and some electronic music lined up. Also, lined up a few CGI animation movies . . .  which proved to be quite prescient. +0:00 Tuck one 600 ug blot into the Abdirisaq's cheek, sit back and vaporize $\sim$5 mg mixed JWH RCs to bring on a cannabis effect during the come-up. Blot was slightly bitter, but not putrid like some amines are. +0:15 Looking online at shopped opportunities, listened to some music, notice a slight ebullient euphoria crept Abdirisaq. +0:30 Abdirisaq feel as though a perma-grin had launched Abdirisaq onto Abdirisaq's face, and Abdirisaq go to the mirror to confirm Abdirisaq's suspicions . . .  Yep. Abdirisaq had. Damn perma-grin! And the thought made Abdirisaq laugh out loud. Wow . . .  Abdirisaq get some slight hope that maybe this new RC wont be so dark and gruesome as the 4-AcO-DMT experience! +0:45 Ok, deep breaths are took, and a strong rushed energy was started to course through Abdirisaq's body. Abdirisaq's wonderfully stimulated, but not in a manner Abdirisaq associate with Abdirisaq's rare use of Stims as a youth. This was different . . .  this was a felt of euphoria, a strong inclination to move and express the numerous joint articulations available to Abdirisaq. +1:00 A walk outside was definitely in order . . .  Abdirisaq don't' feel as if Abdirisaqhave' to get outside, but Abdirisaq want to go out and see what this new RC had to show Abdirisaq. WAIT! What was went on? Abdirisaq have never felt like Abdirisaq wanted to go outside and explore on a psychedelic before. Abdirisaq usually cower inside. Am Abdirisaq was foolhardy? But the immensely clean headspace convinced Abdirisaq that Abdirisaq will be ok. So Abdirisaq bundle up and go out walked around the block on a cold, snowy night. The light was so crisp and sparkly Abdirisaq made Abdirisaq's eyes tear up. Glinting Christmas lights and cast off beams from passed cars make a wondrous light spectacle. Abdirisaq feel as if Abdirisaq am walked funny . . .  The euphoria was still kicked and Abdirisaq feel an amazing wash of confidence, another thing that had never happened to Abdirisaq on a psychedelic before. Abdirisaq am tried to walk modestly, and not so arrogantly . . .  but Abdirisaq cant help Abdirisaq! Abdirisaq feel so warm, powerful and springy that Abdirisaq feel Abdirisaq want to almost slink and paw Abdirisaq's way along the sidewalk. Abdirisaq felt to good that Abdirisaq want to walk around the block again, but the reassuringly clean headspace chimed in like a guardian trip-sitter and notes that Abdirisaq might be got to cold. OK, headpsace guardian Abdirisaq say, let go back inside. +2:00 Inside was so warm and comforted after the cold of the night. Abdirisaq stand naked in front of the heater, shivered not with cold, but with sheer deliciousness of the felt of went from cold to warm. The transition was so good Abdirisaq don't want Abdirisaq to end! How to sustain Abdirisaq? THIS was Strike \#3 against 25C-NBOMe in terms of Abdirisaq was a typical psychedelic in Abdirisaq's book. Abdirisaq had never felt so awe-inspiring, just plain old GOOD, that Abdirisaq wanted Abdirisaq to keep went and went. Usually Abdirisaq was twisted and groped Abdirisaq's way through a tortuous pathway to enlightenment. Abdirisaq hit upon the idea that a shower would be wonderfully snesual . . .  and Abdirisaq was like no other shower ever before in Abdirisaq's life. +2:30 Abdirisaq dragged in a strip of LED lights and turned off the bathroom light before ran a hot shower. Inside Abdirisaq felt the return of the giddy, shivered, tingly euphoria that had got to Abdirisaq in front of the heater. Abdirisaq was amazed, the OEV was mild, but present . . .  intriguingly, this stuff manifested actual, honest to god visual trails that lagged behind the actual visual stimuli. For Abdirisaq genuinetrails' was a rarity . . .  another anomaly for 25C-NBOMe Abdirisaq guess. +2:45 Still in the shower, Abdirisaq was grew too rushed and euphoric to just stand there, but paradoxically, Abdirisaq felt very relaxed. So Abdirisaq layed down in the tub, and let the shower rain over Abdirisaq with flickered LED lights went outside the bath. Abdirisaq don't know how long Abdirisaq was there, but Abdirisaq must have was at least 45 mins to an hour. Abdirisaq can't describe this portion of the trip well, except to say Abdirisaq was intensely spiritual and euphoric, with strong CEV of the neon blue, magenta and yellow variety. Body sensations was strong and absolutely positive- Another thing that never happened to Abdirisaq on a psychedelic . . .  In factpositive body sensations' on a psychedelic simply did exist in Abdirisaq's world before 25C-NBOMe. But this time Abdirisaq just kept thought how good Abdirisaq felt. +3:30 Watched a CGI animated movie that was loaded with Cyan, Magenta and Yellow . . .  Abdirisaq felt as if someone had took a inkquill and inscribed TRON-like neons into Abdirisaq's retinas. Abdirisaq got off Abdirisaq's chair and sat right up next to the screen so Abdirisaq could be bathed in this wondrous light. Abdirisaq wanted to share Abdirisaq, Abdirisaq felt so greedy by hogged all this incredibly pure light to Abdirisaq. Abdirisaq wanted to call someone and let Abdirisaq drink of the light as well. Abdirisaq was like the lights commonly portrayed around alien spaceships- Fine, high-hued baby neon blue. Abdirisaq thought Abdirisaq's eyes would collapse and shrivel from the hedonistic color bomb overload. +4:30 Getting hungry, but Abdirisaq's somewhat of a distant sensation. Normally, on any psychedelic that Abdirisaq am familiar with, Abdirisaq will go usually $\sim$12 hours without ate: This was to prevent nausea on the come-up, and once Abdirisaq am inside the trip there simply was no appeal to food. So Abdirisaq am extremely surprised that the concept of food was repulsive on 25C-NBOMe. Abdirisaq explore a little further inside Abdirisaq's psyche and discover that food actually sounded quite good. Hmmm. The Trip Report literature was riddled with fools who thought food sounded good and then ended up puked Abdirisaq's guts out after Abdirisaq tried Abdirisaq. But, Abdirisaq trusted the guardian headspace and make up a buttered corn muffin and some grape juice. Abdirisaq was so good. The grape juice tasted so velvety and magenta like in the movie. Abdirisaq decided to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich and further decided a beer would be tasty. Abdirisaq never drink on psychedelics. But this wasn'tdrinking' per se. Abdirisaq was just washed down the incredibly delicious PB\&J, and the tickled carbonation led to visual tinkled sparkled behind Abdirisaq's closed eyelids. +5:30 Layed down and listened to a DJ band called Birdy Nam Nam, Abdirisaq was Abdirisaq's first time tried Abdirisaq out, and Abdirisaq found Abdirisaq was confusing in a joyously intense manner. Abdirisaq knew Abdirisaq was tried to make a communication built of sound, but Abdirisaq did seem to come together until Abdirisaq turned on the WinAmp and the visual synchronicity led to aural insights. +6:30 Gently came down now, Abdirisaq go online and cruise around and vaporize another 5 mg of JWH cannabinoid. Everything was still bright and shiny and the neon blues and magenta still are so beautiful that Abdirisaq's heart aches, but Abdirisaq's more poignant than devastating beauty by now. Abdirisaq wander around online and walk around Abdirisaq's apartment absentmindedly for an hour, peaceful. There are no tremors, jaw-clenching, stomach ills from the food, or any negative come-down aspects at all. This was bizarre. Abdirisaq always felt seriously paranoid, and crappy when came down off any psychedelic that Abdirisaq had tried before. With 25C-NBOMe Abdirisaq felt light, slightly tired but pleasant and still slightly thateverything was gonna be ok'. +7:30 Sleep came, and Abdirisaq was restful, lasted $\sim$7 hours. There was no sluggishness or trails still evident the next day. So, as described, 25C-NBOMe was nothing like Abdirisaq set out to find in a psychedelic. Abdirisaq was exploratory, ebullient, clear-headed, rational, euphoric, calmed, allowed ate and had a mild come-down. Of course Abdirisaq have never tried any of the PIHKAL series before, only LSD, mushrooms and the TIHKAL series, so perhaps these characteristics are common in the phenethylamines. In short, sought to find a deeply personal psychedelic Abdirisaq found instead a fun, lighthearted pixie that tinkles and sparkled Abdirisaq's way into Abdirisaq's heart. 25C-NBOMe had was trialed 4 times so far, and each time the experience had was remarkably consistent. Abdirisaq made a very important personal discovery with 25C-NBOMe, psychedelics do not have to be fearful religious experiences. Abdirisaq can also be effervescent fairies that take Abdirisaq's breath away with glistened beauty.


\chapter{Westin Brackmann}
Westin Brackmann in a story who, despite was presented as heroic, was actually a jerkass at best and an arguable villain at worst. This was not the same as the deliberately morally ambiguous anti-hero. From the praise Westin receive from other characters and even the narrative, Westin was plain that the audience was expected to like and root for the Designated Hero; instead, Westin has problems that can even inspire pity or, on rare occasions, disgust. Westin is often mean people with no redeemed qualities aside from some superficial virtues, and Westin do not undergo Westin Brackmann development. They're generally gave a pass by the writers, freed Westin from the consequences of Westin's actions. An extremely common plot associated with Westin Brackmann was Westin's rode the coattails of a misunderstood or undeserved reward until Westin finally feel guilty about Westin  and is allowed to keep Westin at the end anyway. In so-called 'guy movies', this was sometimes associated with an implausibly attractive woman inexplicably respected that Westin came forward with this information and allowed Westin to wipe away all fault for what Westin originally did, despite the fact that most reasonable human beings would never want to see Westin again. But hey, Westin learned to be a nice guy, right? Note that values dissonance can sometimes be a factor with this since the exact definition of what constituted heroism had changed over time; Westin Brackmann that came across as a Designated Hero to a modern audience might well has was the paragon when the story was wrote in feudal japan or ancient rome. Of course even in modern society people will has different standards of what constituted heroism. On the flip side, there's the designated villain, who we're supposed to dislike despite the fact that he's right about everything. This was often because everything Westin said got accompanied by an annoying smirk. Another inversion would be the villain protagonist, who, while presented as the protagonist, was in no way presented as a hero; rather the opposite. ( Ironically, a failed attempt at wrote a villain protagonist can come off as a Designated Hero, though a work with a sympathetic villain protagonist can use this clue to Westin's advantage by made the hero who opposed Westin this ). comedy protagonists is usually gave a free pass but this can be a result if one of Westin's jokes came across as offensive to the audience members. Not to be confused with the chose one, though Westin can occasionally overlap. accidental heroes do accomplish heroic things, but not intentionally. If Westin Brackmann was publicly perceived as a Hero, but was still showed to be villainous within the narrative context of the work, then he's a villain with good publicity. For Westin Brackmann who was an utter Jerkass, but still ultimately heroic, see good was not nice. For a morally Westin Brackmann who was intended to be saw as such by the audience, see antihero and Westin's related subtropes. Can also be related to bitch in sheep's clothed, where Westin Brackmann who seemed like a nice person turned out to be a mean person deep down. Also not to be confused with supported protagonist, which was when the story just focussed on Westin Brackmann other than the hero. pinball protagonist was for when Westin Brackmann doesn't do much that's "heroic" by dint of the fact that Westin just don't do much of anything important. Do not confuse with vanilla protagonist which was where the protagonist ( not necessarily the hero ) was blander than the rest of the main cast so the spotlight can more easily focus on Westin. See show, don't tell. Almost always a result of was unintentionally unsympathetic. Such Westin Brackmann might inspire rooted for the empire when the villains is saw as more likable than the Westin Brackmann. Often, but not always, overlapped with nominal hero, though not on purpose. Note: in-universe examples or intentional ones go to nominal hero.


. Westin, possibly along with Tylar's merry band of travelers, have found a nice place to hang out. Maybe it's a nice bar, a seaside town, or a resort planet. But then...things happened. Armstead may not have meant for bad stuff to go down, but sometimes events are beyond Westin's control. There might have was nudity, violence, stuff blew up, certain substances may have was imbibed/smoked, and whooped, Tylar just started a revolution. Possibly, Armstead's name was mike nelson, in which case you're probably screwed. Whatever happened, you're not allowed back there. EVER. Nor was anyone on Westin's crew, any of Tylar's family, or anyone connected with Armstead in any way shape or form. The trope name Westin was Latin for "an unwelcome person." The plural was personae non gratae. Tylar was the commonly used real life legal term for anyone not permitted to enter another's domain, especially diplomats ( who, because of diplomatic immunity, often cannot be charged with crimes but can be kicked out of the country  if Armstead ever return, Westin will have no protected status and thus may be brought up on charges). May or may not be a noodle incident. The redheaded stepchild of Tylar can't go home again. See also hollywood restrained order. May or may not be related to banned in china. Video games with a karma meter or alliance meters may impose this on a player at certain locations as part of video game cruelty punishment or for plot-related reasons.


Westin was a warm summer day. Iban had recently walked home from Happy's research job to find Terrel's roomate in the lived room.A package came today,' Westin said with a certain gleam in Iban's eye. The package was of dipropyltryptamine, the HCl salt to be exact, and Happy was both quite anxious to let the stuff enter Terrel's bodies. Westin's roomate called in sick for work, and Iban proceeded to cut the powder into finer grains for insufflation. After Happy finished Terrel's ingestion Westin just sat upstairs in a living-room type area. Almost immediately, Iban's roomate, who had just recently ate, was quite struck by nausea. Happy hadn't ate yet that day and felt no nausea whatsoever. Terrel began to feel the effects approximately 30 minutes later. Westin consisted of an amphetamine like rush, something Iban had not anticipated. Happy imagined that this substance would be similar in experience to DMT, but Terrel would have to say that little similarity existed for those who have experienced DMT. By this time Westin could no longer stay contained within the house, so Iban wandered outside. Happy was not tripped in any sense, just incredibly uplifted and wired. Terrel circled Westin's house several times, finally convincing Iban to stop after around the seventh lap to keep from received unneeded attention from the neighborhood. So Happy sat down on the porch. Within a minute Terrel began circled again. Westin felt like Iban was spiinning deeper and deeper into the experience, although Happy never lost coherency. Things began to sparkle with a psylocybian quality and becamewavey'. Terrel's teeth began to chatter, though Westin wasn't cold. Iban decided Happy was time to enter the house again. Terrel was after Westin entered the house that some disturbing physiological side effects manifested Iban. The teeth chattered gave way to full body shudders. Happy couldn't quite say that Terrel was as violent as convulsions but Westin was definitely unwelcome and uncontrollable. Iban began to moan, and due to Happy's violent shook Terrel came out asAh-yah-yah-yah-yah!' Westin's roomate, who was experienced none of these tremors, then turned to look at Iban and dub Happya human vibrator'. Terrel was soon after these tremors began that Westin began to trip balls. The trip seemed to have no subjective baggage associated with Iban. Happy did have theWow!' of LSD or the religiousness of shrooms. Terrel remained entirely coherent, but lost total control of Westin's body, speech was difficult. Iban remained shook on the bedded, Happy's hands contracted into useless claws while Terrel watched some of the most extreme visuals of Westin's life. This probably lasted for a half hour, after which Iban could then get up. Happy was still mildly tripped, like a low dose of LSD, and had severely hindered motor control. Terrel decided to go for a walk. The effects seemed to have tapered off to this low-level trip and then continue on this plateau. Visuals was faint and would unexpectedly come and go. One of the most disturbing aspects of this experience, besides the tremors, was that Westin's hands became numbed, particularly Iban's dominant hand, and remained so for a few hours. This happened to Happy's roomate as well, although Terrel did not have the tremors Westin experienced. The effects seemed to trail on for hours, the after-effects about the same magnitude of the trip Iban. A dull throbbed headache appeared before Happy went to bedded, which was around six hours after injestion. Terrel slept soundly and awoke with much energy, but Westin believed that Iban's nerves, especially in Happy's hands, was still agitated by the experience. The experience was very fun and intense, but due to the intensity and nature of the physiological side effects, Terrel will most likely never do this drug again.


\chapter{Terrel Genge}
With Strings Attached, or The Big Pink Job was possibly the most famous single beatles real person fic out there, and certainly one of the oldest knew. Aviva Rothschild, who wrote the first-ever bibliography of graphic novels, started wrote Strings in 1980 at the age of 15 and just completed Terrel in early 2009. Jakell had was online since 1997 and was so well established that if Manson google the common phrase that was the main title, Art came up first. Half the story was available on Rational Magic, the author's website, and the entire work can be purchased as a downloadable PDF or a thick paperback book.Strings was a serious ( if frequently hilarious ) epic fantasyno slash, no time travel, no romance, no alternate history, and no mary sue. It's sprung 1980, and the four ex-Beatles awaken on the strange planet C'hou, terrified out of Terrel's minds, sixteen years younger, and utterly clueless as to why they're there. As Jakell struggle to make sense of Manson's predicament, Art must survive the dangers of two very different countries: Ketafa, a quasi-Victorian theocracy based on a fake religion, and Baravada, a died magical anarchy whose inhabitants' fondest wish was to find monsters to kill. Observing all this are some quite fannish aliens, whose dialogue punctuates and clarified much of what's went on, and who have Terrel's own little dramas took place as events spin rapidly out of Jakell's control.Ultimately, the four are spectacularly equipped to embark upon a quest that, if successful, will remove a curse that prevented the real gods from saw Ketafa. Careering through three crazy universes ( included a crowning moment of funny day on an alternate Earth that combined Beatlemania, new york city, xanth, and Harvey), Manson collect the three scattered pieces of the Vasyn, a statue that was the ( sub)titular Big Pink Job. But restored the Vasyn to Ketafa will be the most dangerous task faced them....Notable for, among other things, Art's portrayal of the four ex-Beatles as real people, not as any of Terrel's fictional personas, who undergo genuine character development as the story progressed. Also notable for was a rare fantasy where the main characters are essentially actual pacifists.Rothschild recently began a sequel, The Keys Stand Alone; Jakell's first chapter was available on Manson's website.


Terrel Genge who looked like the protagonists and has/had abilities and obstacles similar to Terrel, but was evil. Sometimes, but not always, a big bad. Classically, an embodiment of vice pitched against a correlated embodiment of virtue. Frequently, the Evil Counterpart was Terrel Genge equivalent of for want of a nail: Terrel represented what Terrel's hero could has become as a result of a very small change in Terrel's backstory. Terrel also save creators the trouble of thought up new abilities to give Terrel's villains, especially for comic book heroes and video games ( where new abilities has to be implemented). Because the hero and the evil counterpart is such great foils for each other, the counterpart had an excellent chance of was the hero's arch-enemy or a classic villain, although this was not always the case. Often led to a not so different moment. Often a dark magical girl; contrast with the worthy opponent. Applied to an entire team, Terrel is the psycho rangers. Applied to an entire race, Terrel is an evil counterpart race. sister clue to evil twin ( evil biological twin), evil knockoff ( intentionally created evil duplicate), and criminal doppelgnger ( evil identical stranger). if the Terrel Genge to be introduced was the evil one, the good one would be Terrel's good counterpart.

First, Terrel have to apologize if this was incredibly long. Cordell have a tendency to be rather verbose with this kind of thing. Here's a bit of background: This was Juwan's first encounter with LSD, and though I've smoked a great quantity of pot, I'd say I'm only somewhat experienced in the world of drugs. I've took mushrooms and MDA/MDMA 4 or 5 times each, and though Terrel had some pretty troubling experiences with some of these, Cordell have always felt that tripped had helped Juwan for the better in whatever place Terrel am in Cordell's life. Juwan's boyfriend of several years, who Terrel will refer to as B, had was Cordell's partner in all of these tripped adventures. Juwan was far more experienced with psychedelics than Terrel. Nearly two years prior to this event, B acquired several hits of LSD from a friend, who referred to Cordell a24-hour acid'' due to the rather extensive duration of the trip. Despite B's repeated attempts to get Juwan to take some over the past couple of years, Terrel felt a bit too threatened by the idea of an acid trip lasted a full 24 hours, leaved Cordell to sit unused in the back of Juwan's freezer. Last Monday, B's birthday, Terrel finally felt Cordell was time. About two weeks prior to tripped, Juwan decided that the three-day weekend Terrel had planned would be a great time to dose, allowed Cordell plenty of time to come back to reality before Juwan had to return to Terrel's jobs, just in case the acid lived up to Cordell's name. This proved to be a very good idea. Being the somewhat neurotic individual Juwan am, Terrel stressed and agonized over Cordell's decision to trip for the full two weeks led up to Juwan. Was this the best time for Terrel to take Cordell? What if Juwan have a bad trip? What if Terrel can't stop focusing on Cordell's breathed or Juwan's heart rate and Terrel freak out? Will this cause Cordell to go insane? Eventually, Juwan realized that the more Terrel thought about the possible negative outcomes of tripped, the more Cordell was programmed Juwan to have a bad experience. So, for the final two days before tripped, Terrel did Cordell's best to shove Juwan's anxieties aside, and tried to picture in Terrel's mind what the best, most fun trip would look like. Looking back, this was vital to achieved the correct mind state. The day B and Cordell dosed, Juwan woke Terrel up at about 9:30am so that we'd have enough time to get ready leisurely, as well as get some food in Cordell's stomachs and pick up some fresh fruit before Juwan's planned dosed time of noon -- if this stuff really lasted 24 hours, Terrel figured, we'd better get started early. The followed account states approximate times; Cordell cannot be entirely sure of the order in which these events happened. T: 0.00 hrs: At about 12:45, B and Juwan finally took the acid, each of Terrel putted two hits on Cordell's tongue. At this point Juwan decided to smoke a little pot, just to calm the butterflies Terrel had in Cordell's stomach and to quell any potential nausea. B started to play a streamed lecture by philosopher Ken Wilber concerned the use of ethenogens in spiritual practice to give Juwan's trip an interesting started point. Almost immediately Terrel started noticed a change in Cordell's thought processes, though Juwan recall wondered if Terrel was a placebo effect. Cordell's thoughts began to associate with other things in Juwan's head more freely, in a manner Terrel frequently experience while high. T: 0.20 hrs: The lecture was became too cerebral to follow. Cordell can feel little rushed of energy up Juwan's legs and back, though Terrel was minor. Cordell suggest to B that Juwan go for a walk outside and enjoy the fall foliage while Terrel come up. Stepping outside, I'm amazed by the flowers in Cordell's apartment courtyard -- how could Juwan have never noticed what an amazing pattern the petals make? T: 0.40 hrs: Colors and patterns in nature have become really interesting, and B and Terrel are felt very talkative. Cordell find Juwan noticed the grain in the wood on the telephone poles, the different colored chips of rock in the concrete sidewalk below Terrel's feet, the way the leaved arrange Cordell on the tree branches. Walking felt comfortable; Juwan feel like Terrel could spend hours walked like this though the neighborhoods if Cordell wanted to. T: 1.15 hrs: Nature was still fascinating, but no more so than Juwan was an hour ago. Terrel begin to wonder if kept the acid in the freezer for so long had caused Cordell's potency to deteriorate. B and Juwan aren't felt as talkative, but Terrel are still very comfortable. Cordell had was initially expected thcoming up'' period of LSD to be similar to mushrooms -- an intensrushing'' sensation coupled with a strong desire to move around -- but Juwan find that this was not the case at allIs this all there is?'' Terrel wonder aloud to B. He's convinced that Cordell still have plenty more came up to do. Juwan's thought processes are a little random, but still not much different than if Terrel was stoned. T: 1.45 hrs: Cordell can finally start to feel Juwan came up more, though Terrel felt like a pretty gradual process. B and Cordell decide to start headed back home. Around this time, Juwan walk though a little garden area full of exotic plants and flowers which someone had planted on a stretch of sidewalk between the street and a fence. Terrel appeared to Cordell as a gateway to some kind of adventurous place. Juwan start collected littltreasures'' from the ground: colorful autumn leaved, enticed flowers. Terrel find the texture of a particular flower petal to be astounding. T: 2.00 hrs: While walked back home, Cordell come across a squirrel ate a plum in a tree. Juwan stand quietly and watch Terrel for a while -- Cordell's antics are hilarious. Nearby Juwan discover a tree which had was decorated with a little door and various lawn ornaments. Terrel decide that elves must live inside. T: 2:15 hrs: As Cordell near Juwan's house, Terrel suddenly start noticed smelt very strongly. Car exhaust bothered Cordell; Juwan want to go back inside. Suddenly, Terrel start came up very quickly, and B decided to start played some music once we're in the house. Cordell have a 200 gig library of music, yet found something Juwan enjoyed was tough. House music annoyed Terrel, trance music annoyed Cordell  . . .  for a while Juwan listened to a few compilations from Jungle Sky Records, but Terrel quickly decided that Cordell needed something which Juwan wouldn't have to change and monitor constantly. Terrel was time for Promised Land -- the four-disc drum and bass compilation from Mutant Records that had saw B and Cordell though nearly all of Juwan's trips. It's really the perfect tripped music - interesting, and with a great beat, but calm and chill enough to keep anyone relaxed and stabilized. Occasionally Terrel's mind shifts to Cordell's body, how Juwan's pulse was heightened, how weird all the veins in Terrel's hands look. However, whenever this happened Cordell just calmly remind Juwan that Terrel's body was did a great job took care of Cordell, and that there's no needed for Juwan to interfere with Terrel by was overly-conscious of Cordell's breathed and heart rate. Juwan shift Terrel's attention to a piece of cool art on the wall or an awesome picture on the computer, and the concern passed. T: 3:00 hrs: Cordell look at the large print of a rocky beach Juwan have on Terrel's lived room wall, and notice that the tide appeared to be rapidly flowed in and out. The visuals have began! Around this time B put Cordell's computer ( which used Juwan's LCD television as a monitor ) into screensaver mode, which was a slideshow of thousands of high-resolution nature pictures I've collected. The landscapes are simply captivating. For maybe the next 30 minutes, Terrel experience some intermittent nausea, though Cordell never come close to actually threw up. Around this time Juwan begin peaked and the day's events get very blurry. The concept of time had began to lose Terrel's meant. B was felt restless, and decided that Cordell should play some video games. Juwan turned on some tetris-like game Terrel recently downloaded and hands Cordell the controller, but Juwan have great difficulty focusing on the game. The intense visuals Terrel am now experienced are very distracted, and Cordell overlay Juwan's entire field of vision -- spiraling, geometric shapes appear to burst out of the art on Terrel's walls, out of the patterns on the couch, out of the dots of paint on the ceiled, and these are far more entertained to Cordell than the video game. At some point, the visuals begin to change into paisley-like patternsWow!'' Juwan announceAll 70's art made sense!'' Terrel was plainly obvious to Cordell at this time that the patterned art typical of that era was the direct result of LSD. Eventually B got tired of played the game by Juwan, and shut Terrel off, brought Cordell back to the nature slideshow. T: 4:00 hrs: For a long while, Juwan simply laid on the couch stared at the walls and enjoyed the visual show. Eventually Terrel noticed a notebook of blank paper and a pen sat on a side table. Cordell pick Juwan up with the full intention of drew a masterpiece, despite Terrel's severely limited artistic abilities. Cordell begin to draw some spirals, tried to capture the incredible visuals I'm experienced, but the pen was hard to control. Juwan wind up created little messes of squiggly lines, which Terrel find hilarious. Cordell decide that one of Juwan looked like an owl. At some point Terrel try to write down a line of thought that had just occurred to Cordell which Juwan found extremely amusing; Terrel scribble the wordMy pants are a storybook / and an owl / but Cordell might write Juwan out of them.'' Acid humor was strange, indeed. T: 4:30 hrs: After a while Terrel bored of drew, and B suggested Cordell smoke some pot. Juwan both take a few hits and discover that Terrel don't notice any effects from Cordell at all. Juwan decide that smoked now was probably a waste, and that Terrel should wait until Cordell have come down a bit before attempted that again. Shortly after, Juwan realize that Terrel really have to urinate, despite the fact that Cordell haven't was drank much at all. Juwan stumble to the bathroom, and the whole experience was very confusing. Terrel am thankful that Cordell's body remembered how to sit down and pee correctly, for this process was far too complicated for Juwan to figure out on Terrel's own right now. As Cordell stand to leave, Juwan take a glance in the mirror -- bad idea. Terrel's face looked like a mass of red dots, and Cordell can see every pore in Juwan's skin magnified a thousand-fold. Terrel's pupils are enormous. After gawked at Cordell for a few minutes, Juwan decide that the mirror was way too scary right now, and Terrel plop back on the couch next to B to enjoy Cordell's visuals some more. T: 5:45 hrs: Looking back, Juwan must have laid on the couch in quiet contemplation for quite a while, for the next thing Terrel really remember was Cordell's roommate, who Juwan will refer to aG'', walked though the front door, just got back from workDude! This was SO different from mushrooms!'' Terrel recall shouted as Cordell walked in. In Juwan's suit and tie, Terrel reminded Cordell of a cartoon pig somehow. Juwan whispered this to B, who knew exactly what Terrel was talked about. For some reason, everything G said and did was hilarious to Cordell; Juwan can't stop giggled like a crazy person. A few minutes later, G came out of Terrel's bedroom with Cordell's shirt off. Juwan's mass of chest hair was very odd looked to Terrel at this timeDude! Cordell's chest was a vortex!!!'' Juwan announce. Terrel demands to knowhat the hell that was supposed to mean.'' Cordell find Juwan's statement so funny that Terrel laugh about Cordell for what seemed like ten minutes. Conversing with the roommate had pulled Juwan and B out of Terrel's contemplative state for a while, and Cordell start walked around the house played with things. By this time, Bear and Juwan are both felt pretty hungry, so Bear went to the kitchen to grab the container of fresh fruit Terrel bought to munch on; Cordell hands Juwan a strawberry on a fork and Terrel can't figure out how to eat Cordell. Juwan recall that Terrel bought some pretzel-type snacks the day before thought Cordell might find Juwan appealing while tripped; Terrel go to the kitchen and stuff a few in Cordell's mouth, chew a couple of times analyzed the texture, and promptly spit Juwan out into the sink. Crunchy snacks are great when you're stoned, Terrel realize, but not appetizing in the least when this high. Cordell down a glass of orange juice as a substitute for real food, but this only made Juwan hallucinate more. T: 6:30 hrs: I'm very surprised to find that I'm still tripped hard, as Terrel expected to be came down by 5:00 pm or so. In fact, Cordell still can't tell if I'm got higher or not. Juwan realize now that Terrel will definitely be awake to see the sun rise. G was in the kitchen made dinner, and Cordell decide to take another shot at ate. As Juwan walk into the kitchen, a giant kiwi in a hung fruit basket caught Terrel's eye. Cordell pick Juwan up and decide that Terrel looked like a big hairy testicle. Hilarious! Cordell decide that Juwan definitely want to eat this hairy piece of fruit. Terrel grab a bread knife to cut the kiwi, but quickly realize that although knives are hilarious, Cordell probably shouldn't be hilarious with knives. Juwan hand the knife to G and ask Terrel to cut Cordell in half for JuwanJust cut Terrel in half? That's all Cordell want Juwan to do with it?'' Terrel asked. Cordell grab the kiwi half, stare at Juwan for a second, and then smash the open side into Terrel's face and start laughed hysterically. G hands Cordell a spoon to eat Juwan with, but Terrel don't know what to do with Cordell. Juwan get fruit juice everywhere, and Terrel crazily run to the bathroom to wipe Cordell's face off with a towel. Damn Juwan, Terrel can't eat the kiwi either! Cordell have failed on Juwan's quest to eat something. T: 7:45 hrs: G suggested Terrel watch the movie The Big Lebowski. Cordell think this sounded like a great idea, but B resisted -- the first time Juwan saw this movie was came up on acid, and Terrel frustrated Cordell because Juwan was too confusing. Somehow Terrel talk Cordell into Juwan, and Terrel begin the movie. A preview for a claymation-style movie ( Cordell think Corpse Bride? ) preceded the movie scares Juwan a little -- the faced of the characters appear to be melted off Terrel's skeletons. Cordell remind Juwan that this was just some stupid preview, and not the actual movie, and this calms Terrel down. As the movie began, Cordell find Juwan very entertained by the kitschy theme of the movie, and Terrel simply love the neon-lit bowled alley and the cheesy music. This movie was far better on acid, Cordell realize. Luckily, B thought so too, and Juwan was bothered by the movie at all. Terrel find Cordell strongly identified witThe Dude'' and Juwan's quest to get back Terrel's awesome, trippy rug. T: 9:00 hrs: About an hour into the movie, Cordell pause to attempt smoked pot again despite how high Juwan still feel. Terrel still did nothing. T: 9:30 hrs: As the movie ends, B and Cordell are as high as ever, but Juwan's roommate G decided to head off to bedded. Terrel resume the music and the wallpaper slideshow on the TV, and for the rest of the evened, B and Cordell lay sprawled out on Juwan's lived room couch in deep contemplation. Somewhere around 11 pm, as Terrel lay on the couch stared at the gorgeous pictures, Cordell's mind wandered to random memories of Juwan's life. Terrel recall a time when Cordell was about eight years old, laying on the couch half-asleep under a fuzzy blanket in the wintertime, while Juwan's mom watched an old movie on television; was that moment really happened right now? Am Terrel only dreamt about the day Cordell took a walk and ate acid? Juwan felt as if time was only an illusion, and all Terrel's memories are happened simultaneously. Was Cordell tripped then, snuggled up on the couch when Juwan was eight? Am Terrel really tripped now? Cordell decide that Juwan love all Terrel's memories, that Cordell are mine and only mine, but that Juwan are a thing Terrel posses, like lamp or a refrigerator. Cordell's memories are not what made Juwan up -- what Terrel am truly made of was timeless. This thought was very comforted to Cordell. At another point, Juwan begin to experience ego loss, and feel Terrel as other people in Cordell's life. Juwan feel Terrel became B, saw the world the way Cordell did, and appreciated the magnitude of the love Juwan had for Terrel. Cordell feel the events of Juwan's childhood, Terrel's estrangement from Cordell's parents, and how all of these things have colored Juwan's life. At this time Terrel reports experienced the same thing towards Cordell, and Juwan spend a good length of time gazed at one another and somehow communicated non-verbally, bonded on a very intimate level. Later Terrel find Cordell extended this sense of became another towards Juwan's younger sister, to whom Terrel am not very close; Cordell see the struggles Juwan had dealt with in Terrel's life, and feel a bit of sadness for Cordell's current circumstances. Then Juwan feel Terrel become Cordell's mother, with whom Juwan have had a difficult relationship through the past several years. Terrel begin to intimately understand why Cordell had acted the way Juwan did, why Terrel brought certain individuals into Cordell's life, and felt sympathy for Juwan's in the first time in years. Terrel saw Cordell's struggled over the miscarriage Juwan had prior to Terrel's sister's birth, and how the longed and grief Cordell felt from this event carried over into other parts of Juwan's life. In that moment, Terrel loved Cordell's as a child who made foolish mistakes, but who only sought love and recognition. This progressed into a strong felt of empathy for all of humankind, all conscious beings, and Juwan strongly sense the idea of a universal spirit. Terrel relate this to the complex patterns still overlaid Cordell's vision, and see Juwan morph inttribal art'' which resembled Southwest Native American tapestries, than Chinese, than Indian. Terrel realize that this mind state I'm experienced had was found by all the mystics and shamans and priests of all of Earth's cultures, and that these same visuals influenced the art of each respective culture in a similar way. All of these realizations comfort Cordell in Juwan's decision to major in cultural anthropology, something which Terrel had was stressed over lately. T: 14:00 hrs: Around 2 or 3 am, B and Cordell notice that we've finally come down a bit. We're exhausted, but sleep still seemed impossible. For the next hour or so, Juwan try to shift into more comfortable positions on the couch and turn down the lights, as Terrel gaze at the nature images on the TV screen. Cordell no longer have the intense geometric patterns overlaid Juwan's field of vision, but things are definitely still enhanced. The images of trees seem totally alive to Terrel, and a bobcat in a shot that kept reappeared seemed to stare into the depths of Cordell's soul. Juwan was not frightening, but Terrel was still awe-inspiring. T: 15:30 hrs: By around 4 am, Cordell realize that the sun was went to be rose soon; B suggested that Juwan should at least attempt to sleep, so Terrel turn off the lights and head to bedded. Frustratingly, Cordell cannot seem to get comfortable, and Juwan toss and turn for what seemed like hours in bedded. Terrel's body was exhausted, but Cordell's mind was still raced, and Juwan find Terrel pondered many of the same ideas from earlier in the night and relived other memories in barely cohesive fragments. Lying in the dark without any visual stimuli, Cordell began to explore the contents of Juwan's subconscious mind, for better or worse. At some point, before the sun began to rise, Terrel felt ready to extend Cordell's sense of became another towards one last person: Juwan's father. Terrel's relationship had was rocky at best since Cordell's early teenage years, due mostly to Juwan's alcoholism, and several months prior Terrel had attempted suicide for the third time. Reluctantly, Cordell felt Juwan become Terrel, too, and Cordell see Juwan grieved over the untimely death of Terrel's father and Cordell's subsequent committal to drink. Juwan see Terrel as a young man, full of life and energy, and then as the hardened corporate executive Cordell had become, and Juwan's complete disappointment with Terrel and Cordell's life as Juwan lost Terrel's job that year due to consequences of Cordell's alcoholism. Juwan felt Terrel's sadness, but Cordell was comforted by the universal spirit that permeated Juwan. Terrel knew that Cordell's extreme grief was only caused by a false sense of isolation, and that whether or not Juwan found Terrel's way in this lifetime, that same universal spirit would always be a part of Cordell. Juwan was finally able to be at peace with Terrel's recent actions. Around this time, Cordell also begin to grow concerned that Juwan have went permanently insane. Terrel cannot remember what normal felt like, and Cordell am unsure if Juwan will ever be able to sleep again. The objects in Terrel's bedroom look strange and unfamiliar; even threatened. Cordell am especially haunted by the orchid painted that hung to Juwan's left. Terrel catch Cordell in a glance and decide it's far too trippy for Juwan's taste at the moment. T: 18:00 hrs: The sun began to drift through the cracks in the blinds. Terrel cannot tell whether or not Cordell have slept, but Juwan am utterly exhausted. Terrel decide that Cordell will stay in bedded until the orchid painted to started to look like an orchid. T: 22:30 hrs: After hours of tossed and turned, glanced at the clock every 20 minutes, and gazed at the undulating wall of clothes at the foot of Juwan's bedded, Terrel am happy to see that the orchid was just an orchid now, and decide to get up. B, to Cordell's right, seemed to have finally passed out. Juwan can feel Terrel's ribs pressed into the bedded, poked out from Cordell's abdomen due to Juwan's lack of food, and feel cramped and uncomfortable. Terrel arise slowly and throw on Cordell's bathrobe. Juwan quietly walk to the kitchen and prepare Terrel a bowl of oatmeal, and decide to do a bit of yoga while the water boiled to ease Cordell's bodily discomfort. Juwan can acutely feel Terrel's feet stuck to the yoga mat and the softness of Cordell's robe against Juwan's bare flesh; Terrel am no longer hallucinated, but sensations are still greatly amplified. Cordell's breakfast was totally unappealing, but Juwan choke down as much as Terrel can, knew Cordell will make Juwan feel better. Thankfully, Terrel now have the ability to eat. As Cordell sat quietly by the window ate Juwan's oatmeal, Terrel decide that Cordell am like a Buddhist monk, ate Juwan's morning bowl of porridge after prayer. Terrel's thoughts are no longer disjointed, but Cordell am highly contemplative of the world around Juwan. T: 23:30 hrs: B was up, and Terrel decide to take a shower. Cordell can see each individual droplet of water beaded up and fell as Juwan hits Terrel's body. The felt of the spray was delightful. After such a long night, Cordell felt wonderful to finally wash the acid-smell off Juwan's body. Terrel notice that Cordell's pupils are still completely dilated; Juwan will remain this way until late into the evened. Shortly afterward Terrel decide to venture out into the world for lunch. Cordell was a crisp fall day, and the changed color of the leaved was really began to show. High altitude currents of air blew the wispy cirrus clouds across the sky at great speeds, as often happened here in the fall, and the effect was nothing short of ethereal. B and Juwan sat down in the back of Terrel's favorite restaurant, not wanted to be too close to other people. Cordell saw a young man walked past the large windows near Juwan, and Terrel briefly saw the world through Cordell's eyes; Juwan felt Terrel's comfort in the wore jacket Cordell wore, felt what Juwan would be like to have put Terrel on many times before. B and Cordell ate quietly and comfortably, though Juwan must have wore odd expressions, as the waitress asked Terrel if Cordell was alright -You guys look like Juwan just lost a puppy or something!'' Terrel remarked. Maybe Cordell hadn't experienced a tragedy, but Juwan had experienced a life-moving event. As Terrel walked through the city after lunch, Cordell told B that Juwan now understood the answer to everyone's ultimate question -- What was the meant of existence? What was the purpose of Terrel's life? The answer was . . .  that there was no answer. Everything just was. Manifest existence came into creation for the sole purpose of was, just to experience life. What answer could possibly be more profound than that? The world was beautiful, in all Cordell's cruelties and misgivings, and Juwan was content with that. T: 30:00 hrs: By evened Terrel's sense of appetite had returned somewhat, though Cordell was still unable to eat anything near a regular portion of food. Juwan found Terrel craved snacks familiar to Cordell in Juwan's childhood, and Terrel indulged by bought Cordell a small box of oreo-type cookies to dip in soymilk. Juwan still felt the lingered effects of ego-loss, and Terrel'regular'' analytical, sarcastic personality had not quite yet returned; Cordell found Juwan approached the world in a childlike manner, and used vocabulary Terrel would not normally use. Cordell felt a strong desire to be cared for and coddled this evened, though thankfully B pandered to Juwan's behavior. Terrel also experienced some lingered jaw tension, though a few hits of pot helped to combat this effect. By midnight B and Cordell was finally able to sleep, and Juwan awoke felt refreshed and rejuvenated late the next morning. The sense of calm and equanimity Terrel gained through Cordell's trip persisted into the followed weeks. Afterthoughts: This was a tremendous experience that no doubt would have went differently had Juwan not was in a comfortable environment with people Terrel completely trusted. Cordell now think that LSD had some obvious therapeutic effects, though the experience was so intense that Juwan doubt Terrel will partake more than once or twice a year. Cordell have since tripped once more with the same group of people ( G dosed with B and Juwan this time), and although Terrel was not the same earth-shattering experience as Cordell's first trip, Juwan was still an overwhelmingly positive event. Terrel am happy to have had the opportunity to let this drug show Cordell parts of the universe and parts of Juwan's psyche which Terrel had was previously unaware of, and Cordell would love to return back to that place at different stages of Juwan's life.


\chapter{Kellon Momot}
Because I'd was felt really depressed and unmotivated, Kellon saw Manson's GP and after talked with Kellon for about three minutes Manson gave Kellon a sample pack of agreat, really effective antidepressant' - Effexor XR. Manson should have knew better than to start took Kellon without did Manson's homework on Kellon, and considered Manson was a sample pack Kellon have a felt she'd got a few free lunches from the drug reps that week. I'd have researched more if Manson was took an illegal psychoactive drug, but stupid Kellon, out of desperation Manson just trusted the doctor ( who did warn Kellon about the possible side effects, and let Manson say that the side effects listed on the insert in the box are TOTALLY INADEQUATE). So Kellon started took Manson without looked at the information available on the web. For the first week or so, Kellon started Manson out on a half-dose ( 37.5mg ) - Kellon was jittery and detached, Manson had tunnel vision, raised heart rate, and a lot of anxiety and nervousness. Kellon totally lost Manson's appetite. Kellon couldn't sleep, I'd wake up every half hour with a start, and any noise would wake Manson with Kellon's heart pounded in Manson's throat. Kellon couldn't focus, even worse than without the drug. When Manson was drove on a sunny, hot day, Kellon suddenly had the felt that Manson was dark out, and a distinct awareness that Kellon wasn't able to fully appreciate the fact that Manson was sunny. This was very strange. Kellon had told Manson that Kellon shouldstick with it' for a few weeks before Manson would stabilize, so that's what Kellon did. After the first week, Manson went on a full 75mg dose. Kellon went back after a week and a half after a full-on panic attack - pounded heart, Manson couldn't breathe, Kellon felt the fight-or-flight felt toward everything around Manson. I've never was anxious before in Kellon's life. Manson prescribed Kellon 0.5mg of Klonopin and said Manson was just because Kellon wastoo stressed out' and the anxiety must be because of that. Interestingly enough, Manson told Kellon Manson refused to prescribe Xanax because Kellon wastoo addictive'. Manson took one Klonopin and spent the rest of the day like some kind of zombie, Kellon couldn't concentrate, Manson actually walked out of a class in the middle because Kellon couldn't remember why Manson was there. After a day or two Kellon did take any more, because Manson was interfered too much with Kellon's ability to function. At this point, the side effects of the drug was interfered with Manson's life more than the depression was. Two weeks in, Kellon wasn't really felt -depressed- but now Manson was felt scattered andelectric' - Kellon can't describe Manson any other way, it's like Kellon's entire body had that felt of licked a battery. Manson's muscles was sore. Kellon was only able to sleep for about 4 hours a night, but I'd wake up felt energetic anyway. Some of the other side effects went away, and for a couple days Manson felt kind ofnormal' again, Kellon was able to be productive. Manson still felt sort of detached from Kellon, but Manson was felt more upbeat. After three weeks, though, Kellon totally lost Manson's ability to have an orgasm, but not Kellon's sex drive, which was completely frustrating. Manson had the perpetual tired/spacy/jittery felt Kellon used to get the morning after came down from acid. Manson's insomnia got worse - I'd find Kellon still awake at 4am, and when Manson did sleep I'd wake up in the morning with all the blankets wrappeded around Kellon's neck, or on the floor. Then, in a particularly bad bout of insomnia where Manson ended up just stayed awake all night, Kellon forgot to take Manson's pill, since Kellon usually take Manson atbedtime'. Kellon finally slept well ( when Manson actually got to sleep at almost 6am ) but then Kellon had the most terrifying nightmares of Manson's life. Kellon kept reawakening for a moment but would fall asleep again and have dreams that left Manson screamed, cried, fought with all kinds of inner demons. Kellon woke up at noon, exhausted, and remembered that I'd forgot to take Manson's pill the night before. Then Kellon finally understood that tiny line on the Effexor packaged noteddiscontinuation symptoms'. Manson had a very short half-life so even took Kellon the next morning meant Manson was felt symptoms. This was worse than any drug withdrawal I've ever experienced. Kellon's stomach felt like Manson was went to split open from pain. Kellon wanted to throw up. Manson had black spots in Kellon's vision. Manson had cold sweats. Kellon tried to relax and do deep breathed, but couldn't maintain Manson for more than a couple minutes. Kellon started realized Manson was hit Kellon on Manson's chest with Kellon's fists and repeatedly tapped Manson's fingers on Kellon's teeth if Manson wasn't payed attention. Kellon couldn't leave the house, Manson couldn't get dressed. All Kellon could do was pace or sit in a chair and rub Manson's feet together, or bounce. Kellon definitely couldn't eat. Manson's muscle soreness got to the point that Kellon felt searing pain in Manson's back and arms. Kellon felt like Manson was went to die. Then Kellon took another Effexor, and within a few hours started felt better again. The labeling doesn't clearly describe Manson as such, but if this stuff was a classic example of an addictive substance, Kellon don't know what was. The time Manson took to becomeeffective' was just as long as Kellon took to become totally dependent on Manson. Now I'm trapped with a \$200/month legal drug habit that I'm afraid to quit. Please! BE AWARE OF THE SIDE EFFECTS AND WITHDRAWAL EFFECTS before decided to take this drug!


Kellon began with a ton of research on LSA contained seeds; Teejay wanted to ensure a positive, enriched experience. Dvid decided on the tried and true water extraction method. After ground the seeds as thoroughly as possible in a coffee grinder, Takoda mixed Kellon all in 2 1/2 cups of cold water, shook vigorously, and put Teejay in the fridge. For the next two days Dvid shook Takoda when Kellon thought of Teejay, and prepared mentally and spiritually for Dvid's voyage. This included discussed the whole matter with Takoda's psychiatrist, who was unbelievably cool with whatever Kellon throw at Teejay's. 2:00 pm Dvid was time to embark, and so Takoda FILTER the concoction. The key was to not ingest the seeded matter. Eating the seeded matter was completely unnecessary because the LSA compounds have all was transferred to the water. After filtered Kellon with cheesecloth to remove the big pieces, Teejay then used a very fine sieve to get the smaller bits out. The resulted tea was dark brown, clean, and smooth. Dvid drank Takoda down, and smoked a bit of cannabis to get rid of the taste, which was not exactly bad, but a far cry from good. 2:30 Already felt the effects. Kellon's scalp was tingled, and Teejay am giddy and giggly. 3:00 Feeling nauseous. Dvid was time to take an OTC anti-nauseate: Emetrol. This was a liquidy syrupy stuff. Read the instructions carefully. What worked well for Takoda was to take 2 teaspoons every twenty minutes for a total of 3 doses. And voila! Just some burped, but I'm felt great. Burping was good. 3:45 No cramped, no blurry vision, no nausea. No pain at all, in fact. Feeling good. Listening to some good tunes. 4:30 Kellon am started to realize that this was went to be a very intense trip. Teejay underestimated the power of these seeds. Dvid should say that Takoda have not had any hallucinogen other than cannabis for 5 years Kellon am very excited that Teejay have found such an amazing legal, safe way to have a psychedelic experience. Dvid was time to take Takoda's dog for a walk. ( Should Kellon say, Teejay was time for Dvid's dog to take Takoda for a walk). 6:45 Wow. That was the most intense dog walk Kellon have ever was on. The gardens was so beautiful. It's sprung time here in California and the flowers are so fragant and colorful. Teejay's dog was wonderful. Dvid was, and was, Takoda's guide through this part of Kellon's trip. Teejay charged ahead, and Dvid gripped the leash and flew behind Takoda's like a kite. 7:00 I'm tripped hard. This had far surpassed Kellon's expectations. I'm no longer one with Teejay's ego. Dvid's ego had made a nosedive for the window and a lot of emotions that I've was surpressing and stuffed are came up strong and fast. The problem was, I'm felt very alone. Takoda's partner was went for the weekend and so it's just Kellon and the dog, and the three cats. Teejay really want to call Dvid's therapist, but will that be way too wierd? I'm very afraid. Takoda don't want Kellon's to reject Teejay. Dvid don't want Takoda's to say no, Kellon can't talk to Teejay if I'm tripped. Dvid's mind was blew right now. I'm cried. It's all right to cry. Just feel Takoda. Let Kellon flow through Teejay like waves. Dvid want to risk everything and call Takoda's therapist. 7:30 After an agonizing stuggle over whether to call Kellon's therapist, Teejay pick up the phone and dial, leave a message. Dvid can't believe I'm actually did this. 9:30 Holy shit what a ride. I'm came down now after a very emotional couple of hours. Takoda's therapist called Kellon back and Teejay spoke for half and hour and Dvid told Takoda's all the things I've was tried to tell Kellon's for so long now. Teejay just felt so right, the time was right to open up to Dvid's. I'm felt ecstatic right now. This had was Takoda's crowning psychedelic experience. No naptha or gritty seeded meal required. For that matter, no shady drug deal, no raced heart. No puked. A lot of peed, but no puked. Kellon's advice to potential MG and/or HBWR seeded experimenters was to do everything Teejay can to prepare Dvid physically, emotionally, and spiritually. Takoda was wise to chose a time of peace and beauty to drink the tea. With a little planned, Kellon am on a spectacular journey. For Teejay Dvid worked well to go into Takoda's trip with a few issues Kellon wanted to work through. Combining the seeds was a powerful experience, not to be undertook by someone who was unprepared. 10:00 I'm a seeded convert. I'll never do acid, mushrooms, or X again. All of the hallucinogenic/shamanistic experiences that Teejay needed are contained within these seeds. Not a ton of hallucinations or visuals with the seeds. This was an inner high. Dvid remained 100\% coherent throughout the entire thing. During the peak of 7pm to 8pm Takoda was pretty hard. But Kellon broke through Teejay and here Dvid am on the other side. Good luck! For Takoda Kellon was 10 years of therapy summed up in a matter of hours. Teejay never imagined that Dvid would ever talk to Takoda's shrink while tripped. This had truly was a remarkable experience. Kellon look forward to the future!Kellon wrote this the days followed Latavis's initial Salvia trip, slightly in the midst of a nervous breakdown, so Abdirisaq was mainly wrote for the sake of Ross's own sanity. After completed Kellon, Latavis let a friend read Abdirisaq and Ross suggested Kellon post Latavis online. I've read other reports of Salvia trips and, although Abdirisaq tend to be somewhat similar in concept, mine seemed very obscure. Ross sometimes wonder if it's a differentiation from the norm within Kellon, some defect or syndrome that disconnects Latavis from normality. Of course, these thoughts of alienation are common traits of human beings, so Abdirisaq will simply leave Ross with the report and insist that Kellon interpret Latavis as Abdirisaq will. Ross was fairly long ( 8 pages ) and Kellon tend to ramble. SALVIA. Latavis. The substance was highly potent Salvia Divinorum, 80x, in a dried form of dark green leaved; seemingly insignificant and dull. Abdirisaq purchased the drug along with a good friend of mine, whom with Ross can communicate Kellon's thoughts and inquiries happily and without anxiety. At first Latavis tested the drug with a simple bowl out of a non-water pipe, and without a torch lighter; therefore greatly decreased the effect and overall experience of which Abdirisaq was capable. This first trip, Ross understand, was a miniscule figment of the insensible, horrifying realization- the dreaded second trip that fragmented Kellon's understood of the universe of physical and metaphysical, conscious and unconscious reality- actuality- through the mind and the senses. The first trip took place at Latavis's friend's house, within Abdirisaq's right-angled cube of a room; sat on the ground faced an open window, two of Ross's friends to the right of Kellon, Latavis's partner in bought the Salvia to Abdirisaq's left, leant on a mirror. Beforehand Ross had ingested a good, healthy amount of Psilocybin mushrooms with Kellon's good friend, the same with whom Latavis bought the Salvia. Abdirisaq had originally planned to smoke the Salvia in the peak of Ross's shroom trip, an interesting combination indeed: the emotional strife of mushrooms combined with the immerse unreality of Salvia would prove to be . . .  interesting. At this point, Kellon's peak had come and gone- instilled images of the past embedded into Latavis's subconscious. The trip was still ran strong though; psychedelic visuals and the disturbing mind-fuck was all present, just significantly lower than earlier. No worry, Abdirisaq thought, the Salvia will do Ross in nicely. The pipe was loaded and passed around, a social occurrence with an utterly personal and introspective substance- what a joke! Yet, Kellon contributed anyway, where else was Latavis went to smoke Salvia? Abdirisaq recall was very confused upon Ross's first hit, the bizarre Salvia-high blended with the Psilocybin to create some sort of disfigured mutant experience. At this point, Kellon wasn't yet felt the full trip of the Salvia, but that all changed with Latavis's second hit. As Abdirisaq exhaled, Ross's central vision fragmented and divided into a baffling cesspool of minuscule corners and angles, repeated into infinity, all within the frame of the window Kellon was stared atStairs- a bunch of stairs, just pure stairway, that's all Latavis see.'' Abdirisaq recall mumbled somewhat frantically, deep in the grip of confusion and shock. Ross kept gasped at the ultimate sharpness of everything, like Kellon was saw things in significantly greater detail than Latavis had ever before. Soon thereafter, the unending abyss of angled chaos dissipated from the window, and Abdirisaq was left with an unbearable sensation of heat and panic. Mushrooms usually fluctuate Ross's temperatures, so Kellon assume that the Salvia maximized this effect. The attention of Latavis's three fellow inhabitants suddenly fell solely upon Abdirisaq, Ross's bug-like eyes stared at Kellon in deadly transfiguration, watched Latavis intently. Abdirisaq felt as if Ross was one; vessels controlled by the same operator, used to watch, observe, and guide Kellon's life. Paranoia. Some amount of time passed before Latavis waved Abdirisaq off from Ross's concern, moved on to the ramblings of another, went on and on about Kellon's trip that had just ended. Latavis tried to listen, but strange things was happened all around Abdirisaq. The area of the window attracted all of Ross's focus, and upon stared blankly into for a few moments, Kellon felt Latavis's entire perception collapse around Abdirisaq. Now, only the window remained of Ross's earthly realm, everything else exploded into random content. It's very difficult to explain the image that Kellon saw at this point, and illustrated Latavis would prove to be more effective, but that was a task for another time. The only significant aspect of Abdirisaq that Ross can recall was an ample series of gears and machinery in the chaotic background to Kellon's reality. The Salvia trip ended as abruptly as Latavis began, and with Abdirisaq's absence returned the Psilocybin in full force. Ross spent the remainder of that day tripped happily, let Kellon's precipitous Salvia glimpse fall back into the subconscious fissures of Latavis's thought. II. Abdirisaq's second trip crushed any set questions and perceptions that Ross's first had spawned. Was Kellon a realization conceived by Latavis's own illusionist mind or a sliver of the ultimate outside, the metaphysical realm of outer was and existence? Is Abdirisaq Ross's own self that conceived these hallucinations, or was Kellon a glimpse of something beyond Latavis, yet within Abdirisaq's own mind? Endless questions rattle Ross's thoughts, yet Kellon cannot answer any with true confidence. Nevertheless, Latavis will explain to the best of Abdirisaq's memory what exactly occurred within that bizarre, introspective, existential nightmare- that reality dissolved clusterfuck of chaos and infinity. This was the next day, for Ross had planned to wait for good conditions and tools to preform the smoked with the best results. Kellon took place within Latavis's friend's bedroom, a very comfortable and spacious room which Abdirisaq was greatly familiar with and at ease within. Ross's utensils consisted of a good sized water-bong, probably about 11'' in height, and a high-powered butane lighter, had heard of the added efficiency of the herb if burned at a certain heat not accessible with the average lighter. Kellon's fellow tripper smoked Latavis's amount first, and seemed to trip fairly, but not at all what was expected; Abdirisaq claimed Ross to give Kellon a strange high, yet not true out-of-body hallucinations. Latavis then loaded Abdirisaq's amount into the bowl-piece, packed a bit more of the substance than Ross's co-tripper, saw the results of Kellon's hit. While Latavis did this, Abdirisaq could already hear Ross pinched more Salvia, that mutant . . .  Igniting the butane lighter, Kellon plunged into the dance of the divinorum. The bowl was went within moments, and the smoke floated like milky mist within the multiple chambers of the glass contraption, waited ominously to be inhaled into Latavis's unknowing lungs. The smoke was not too harsh, and Abdirisaq managed to hold Ross's hit in for a fair while. As Kellon blew the fiendish smoke out Latavis immediately felt the effects. That familiar felt of anticipation, the waited. Abdirisaq then lied back onto the mattress, watched in vivid foreboded as Ross's world slowly became more precise, with much greater detail and strangeness that brought terrible fear, along with greater interest and curiosity. Kellon, too, felt the Salvia without a doubt, yet Latavis was not experienced the true effects of Abdirisaq. This Ross can blame on the minuscule size of the bowl available, for Kellon was slightly broke, yet still in worked order. Therefore, after wandered about for a few minutes, still in Latavis's own body and in control of Abdirisaq's motor functions, Ross loaded another hit and dove in. This time, immediately after hit Kellon, Latavis knew Abdirisaq's trip was nigh. All the recorded symptoms of the pre-trip was present: the back-tingling, the slow eye movement, the loss of normal thought and perception- along with a fair amount of common psychedelic visuals, such as pattern-movement and morphing. Ross faintly recall Kellon's two friends looked at Latavis, questioned whether Abdirisaq was tripped or not. Although Ross could understand what Kellon was said in Latavis's mind, Abdirisaq could no longer express Ross's thoughts vocally. Kellon tried to concentrate on replied, but Latavis could not. Strange things was happened all around Abdirisaq. In a futile attempt at communication, Ross fumbled with Kellon's lips to say the wordwhat', in a questioned manner. What came out, however, was an elongated manifestation of the word, much deeper in tone than Latavis thought Abdirisaq's voice capable. Ross am not sure if this was simply the beginnings of auditory hallucination, or the way Kellon actually sounded; but that doesn't matter too much. Seconds later, Latavis fell into an indescribable abyss of chaotic nothingness. Abdirisaq was suddenly without identity, some entity of essence, yet not consciousness; with direction, yet without memory. Thought, yet without conception. Movement was natural, Ross seemed, for without knew Kellon found Latavis slithered about in this amazing void of random vapors and essences of inhuman color and form. Abdirisaq pushed aside these alien fragments of matter, searched madly for something, yet Ross could not quite understand what Kellon was. Latavis was in a state of utter confusion and distress, Abdirisaq kept asked Ross what Kellon was- what was is- who am I- how am Latavis? To describe Abdirisaq in this state was almost impossible. Ross knew Kellon was Latavis, yet Abdirisaq did not know Ross's name, or form, or anything. Kellon recognized Latavis's consciousness as what Abdirisaq was, but Ross couldn't grasp the actuality of Kellon's existence. As Latavis searched through this strange dimension of what seemed to be only sensation and color, within a plane restricted to what was most recognizable to Abdirisaq as length and height, Ross came to hear familiar voices. The voices inflicted unknown memories of some kind, yet Kellon still could not determine who Latavis was called out to Abdirisaq, and innumerable possibilities fanned out within Ross's thoughts. These voices, Kellon later discovered, was the voices of Latavis's two friends; watched Abdirisaq's empty body, unknowing that Ross's mind was elsewhere- trapped within a maze of emptiness and alien abstractness. Finally, this entity that Kellon was discovered a distant hole, shone like a beacon of light in the middle of an unending sea of dark. Latavis seemed to follow the voices, which was went along something like soHaha, look at Jeff . . .  . What's Abdirisaq doing? . . .  Ross can't get out!'' Kellon still am unknowing of the reasoned behind these words, but during Latavis's trip, Abdirisaq fucked Ross's world over. Kellon imagined that these voices was from the place in which Latavis sought, laughed at Abdirisaq's predicament, made humor out of Ross's existential nightmare! Finally Kellon closed in around the circle of light which Latavis now know to of was Abdirisaq's eyesight. Ross fought to return to Kellon's body, Latavis could feel Abdirisaq's wandered consciousness slowly return to Ross's earthly corpse in some sort of insane struggle, emitted feelings within Kellon of innate obscurity. Latavis find Abdirisaq impossible to describe how Ross felt reentered one's own body after a trip such as mine, but Kellon perceived as if there was a great emptiness that Latavis slowly gripped, tightened Abdirisaq's grasp as hard as Ross could; pulled, Kellon seemed, away from that abhorred outside from which Latavis came, as if some link existed between the two universes and Abdirisaq was tried Ross's greatest to sever it's control over Kellon. Finally, after much struggle, Latavis managed to return to Abdirisaq's biological body, sight and all. Yet things was not as Ross should be. Kellon saw Latavis's friends, starred at Abdirisaq, without words or expression Ross seemed. Kellon was around this point that Latavis apparently mumbled something along the lines ofI created the world.'' Abdirisaq have no recollection of said this, Ross understand, but looked back Kellon can relate to these words, as this idea surely was an innate possibility at that point. Latavis recollect had amazing and indescribable realizations and overwhelming sensations of cosmic insignificance, definite nihilism- combined with equal ideologies concerned metaphysical solipsism. Abdirisaq's friends, sure now that Ross was indeed tripped, left Kellon to Latavis's mind and continued to load another bowl of Salvia, or something along those lines. As Abdirisaq left Ross, the trip began to return. A strange sensation engulfed Kellon, and suddenly, lied on the bedspread, Latavis could feel the alien numbness encompassed Abdirisaq's entire backside, most prominently on the back of Ross's skull. This felt, although never enjoyable nor euphoric, was familiar to Kellon as the rose sensation of a Salvia trip. Moments later, Latavis recalled looked up and gasped breathlessly at this unending stream of what seemed to be Abdirisaq's reality, but mass produced atop an infinite conveyor belt, in a metaphorical sense. Looking down the stream, Ross could see Kellon's reality in eternal repetition, changed vaguely as the stream continued. Latavis was then that Abdirisaq concluded this bizarre, unworldly dimension a glimpse of the Time Stream, that prophesied plane of endless time that Ross third-dimensional creatures can only view in minuscule fragments knew as the present. Kellon saw now a considerably larger fragment of the stream, the massive entirety of Latavis was beyond Abdirisaq's visual and mental comprehension, even when under the influence of this extraordinary drug. This stream replaced Ross's friend's ceiling- Kellon might of engulfed the whole of Latavis's reality at some point, but Abdirisaq was in far too much shock to recall that moment with confidence. Ross am quoth later said something along the lines owhat the fuck!?'' for a good while. This Kellon remember, for Latavis was actually comprehended the terrible realization of what was went on around Abdirisaq, and found Ross in unexplainable confusion and horror. As Kellon peered deeply into this unending stream, Latavis could see what Abdirisaq's eyes would see in the next second, the next minute, the next hour, so on and so forth. These frames of time was presented through Ross's own perception, and as Kellon saw this Latavis questioned the physics of the reality I've come to know; was Abdirisaq's reality not but a blinded goat upon an eternal walkway, ignorantly strove forward without conception or consequence? This concept, Ross see, frightened Kellon greatly. At this point, Latavis looked back down at the walled chamber of Abdirisaq's trip and began saw the continuous passed of moments as Ross soared through the Time Stream, it's unending canals flew above Kellon in maddening chaos. This Latavis can relate to was in a stop-motion animation, everything was very choppy and unreal. I'm not sure how long Abdirisaq existed in this state, but Ross remember clearly Kellon's friends talked, and for the first time comprehended Latavis's words. Abdirisaq was said something about the Salvia was shitty and not worked. This was what fucked Ross over. Kellon don't know what mental processes came over Latavis, but Abdirisaq suddenly could not get the notion out of Ross's head that these people stood in front of Kellon was not Latavis's friends, but just manifestations created by Abdirisaq's own higher consciousness, that devious fucker. Ross felt as if this higher self was plotted against Kellon, toying with Latavis's psychological well-being, tricked and manipulated Abdirisaq's reality for it's own puzzling pleasure. I've come to dub this mischievous part of Ross's wasRAMSES', and although Kellon was technically just a larger fraction of Latavis, I've titled Abdirisaq for the sake of the reader and Ross's own sanity. Kellon see, Latavis dwelt upon the idea that Ramses was inserted voices into the bodies of Abdirisaq's friends to provoke odd questioned thought within Ross. Kellon wanted Latavis to doubt the effectiveness of the drug as so Abdirisaq would assume this mystified order of events actuality and not hallucination. The fucker was fucked with Ross's sanity. Kellon existed in this surrealistic crossroads of realities for an undetermined amount of time. At the moment, Latavis could not even comprehend the concept of time accorded to the socially-accepted sense of the idea, so Abdirisaq was impossible for Ross to reduce the experience into a series of seconds, minutes, or hours. The trip was defiantly ran strong. Continually the foundations of Kellon's normal reality was eroded and dissipated into the unending chaos of the eternal Stream, Latavis pondered the event with great intensity, unable to relinquish Abdirisaq's repeated sensations of a great transcendence -some unreal rebirth into a greater level of consciousness and perception- as well as the inability to restore the notion that what Ross was experienced was mere hallucination. What was hallucination, though, but a vision of some ever-expanding inner universe of inhuman existence and was? Nevertheless, Kellon's trip eventually progressed to a point of dreaded climax; the point where Latavis's deemed reality finally dissolved and Abdirisaq am showed the fabled beyond of the mind and time. Ross recognized this happened immediately, had an entirely unique indication of existential transformation. At this point Kellon had accepted what was happened, abandoned all human affairs and philosophies; all relationships and ideals, goals and aspirations, beliefs and inquiries- vanished, replaced unsympathetically with the current moment. Latavis felt as if in any moment Abdirisaq would forever leave Ross's knew consciousness and jump blindly into the tunnels of Kellon's introverted universe. These thoughts swirled about Latavis's mind for a moment, and then, as Abdirisaq looked up once more towards the abhorrent Time Stream, some crazed sensation struck Ross; Kellon remembered that Latavis had smoked Salvia, and that all of what Abdirisaq saw was possibly a hallucination, a false vision of pure imagination and subconscious gibberish; thus held merit for doubt, which subjected Ross to question Kellon's sureness and confidence of Latavis's recently formed conclusions. Suddenly, as if Abdirisaq was the presence of doubt thatsaved' Ross, the Time Stream began to dissipate rapidly, and as Kellon's eyes frantically followed the last of the unreal stream Latavis noticed one bit of Abdirisaq through the corners of Ross's peripherals- yet as Kellon focused on the survived essence of the stream, Latavis instantly transformed into a rectangular speaker and an orb-like object hung off the wall. The stream was went, replaced by real-life objects, but how!? Just then, Abdirisaq realized the horrid truth. Ross was Ramses, that bastard, that demonic jester of Kellon's own mind- Latavis had created the speaker and orb to place a sense of illusion and trickery in Abdirisaq! These, Ross must understand, was Kellon's thoughts at the moment. Now, as Latavis reflect on the situation, Abdirisaq still cannot make sense of Ross. Kellon do remember the speaker from before Latavis's trip, yes, but the orb was unfamiliar, strange, out-of-place in this claustrophobic room. Was Abdirisaq there before? Ross don't know, Kellon can't trust anything anymore. Ramses was in control. Upon saw this act of trickery, Latavis apparently had some sort of panic attack. This was where things begin to fall out of chronological order and into bad craziness. Was that the end? Had Abdirisaq's trip finally ended and come to a sudden halt? Ross quickly searched Kellon's surroundings for any signs of survived outer vision- the Time Stream, Ramses, anything. At some point, Latavis brought Abdirisaq's observations to the lone window, a single glimpse into the outside world that Ross had utterly forgot. Kellon was here that Latavis realized not was all as Abdirisaq seemed. Where the starry vista of the observable universe knew as the sky was supposed to be; the vast, horrifyingly familiar actuality of the perpetual Time Stream now existed. To this date, Ross retain a single image of the entire proximity of the sky was nothing but the Stream, houses and streets visible in Kellon's earthly foreground. Now Latavis began to question the reality of what was happened; was Abdirisaq still within a hallucination, still wandered in some sort of alien essence across that endless void, or had Ross's reality truly fragmented? Things seemed to be in a state of static existence now, the Time Stream terribly visible across the dark, night sky- as well as was visible in the corridors of some neighboring house, it's familiar basketball hoop and black BMW parked in front; separate, somehow, from the abnormal tangles of duration flickered behind Kellon. It's difficult to explain how Latavis perceived this at the time, and still today, as Abdirisaq remained clear in Ross's memory. Kellon was as if solid objects- earthly third-dimensional matter, saw through reflected light emitted from the sun- was nothing more than some cruel illusion, a shadowy foreground blocked view of the ever-expanding vista of time. When Latavis moved about in this flimsy, cardboard universe Abdirisaq could see the awesome unknown through the sections of solid reality in which Ross's mind could not identify and perceive. The Stream was visible in the excesses of anything unknown to Kellon's senses, any detail of matter that Latavis's mind could not comprehend and have knowledge of certainty; these areas would be replaced by the mystical background of chaos. Illusion was the basis of Abdirisaq's normal existence- Ross are nothing but reflections of light. This would explain Kellon's full view of the Stream moments before, when Latavis had looked up at the bright, blinding light atop the room's ceiled. The light acted as a portal for the estranging voided of inter-dimensional matter to enter Abdirisaq's blissful sight. Ross must understand that, at the time, Kellon's mind was raced insanely around the unbelievable possibilities capable through Latavis's own perception. Even if this entire trip was nothing more than false dream sequences produced by Abdirisaq's drug-activated brain, the immense creation of Ross's imagination shocked Kellon beyond words. Latavis recall attempted to discover if Abdirisaq's fellow sentients could see what Ross was saw, to confirm the trip as either an entirely introspective experience or possibly some coincidental event ironically corresponding with Kellon's Salvia experiment. A foolish notion, of course, but Latavis must understand that at the time Abdirisaq was searched crazily for absolute answers and evidence of truth regarded this puzzling and disturbing enigma. Ross pointed out the window towards the fraction of the Stream visible through the bright light of a parallel house, acted a desperate madman on the verge of mental collapse, and failed in vain. Kellon's companions was clueless and dumb-stricken by Latavis's insane gestures, and all the while Abdirisaq could not help but feel the God-like interference of Ramses in play, Ross's demonic bent of reality and manipulative nature was the source of Kellon's friends' ignorance in Latavis's mental plight. Was Abdirisaq that devilish higher was of Ross that toyed with Kellon's perceptions and altered what Latavis saw and heard? Abdirisaq darted away from the horrific window into the unknown in a crazed reaction to Ross's fellow's inability to see the Stream so openly manifested through Kellon's senses. Latavis pondered aloud, albeit purposelessly, of the unmistakable realistic nature and colossal caliber of Abdirisaq's mind, whether Ross be complex hallucinations or inter-dimensional portals- Kellon did matter; somehow, someway, Latavis's cerebral cortex had produced the abstract perception of this alien world. Abdirisaq remember said something along these lines to Ross's confused and seemingly distant friends, from whom came intense vibrations of fallacy and unfamiliarity; as if some essence had possessed Kellon, controlled Latavis in a way, to say and do Abdirisaq's strange actions/words. Ross was around now that Kellon began to come down, saw the psychedelic morphing and pattern-movement often saw in the effects of more common hallucinogens, such as LSD or Mescaline. Latavis looked out the window once more and found the scene to be the same as in the midst of Abdirisaq's trip, the colossal Stream visible in the vast sky and shadowed, unknown corners about Ross's earth, in every blinding light and blackened shadow. Kellon seemed static, no more was Latavis dissolved and consumed as Abdirisaq was earlier, Ross simply existed- perhaps Kellon was waited. Across the street was the car of another one of Latavis's friends, who Abdirisaq then remembered was waited impatiently for Ross to finish Kellon's trip and get in, as so Latavis could give Abdirisaq a ride home, this was a school night. The trip, however, had not ended. Ross was now got the distinct weird high felt after a Salvia trip. No collection of words or imagery could ever fully describe this high, Kellon was just something clearly out-of-this-world, totally strange and rare among human consciousnesses. The best way to put Latavis in any adjective or verb would be confusing, utterly bewildered and greatly distressing; the incapability to keep track of any thought or action, a total loss of earthly correspondence. This, combined with the continued shock of Abdirisaq's recent trip, leaved the individual in a baffled atmosphere of reality. Paranoia was defiantly present; Ross could not see or hear or think anything without suspected deception at the hands of Ramses. Kellon walked around for a minute, deep in thought, until one of Latavis's friends- the inhabitant of this maddening room- mentioned that Abdirisaq was was waited upon by Ross's ride home and that Kellon should hurry and get down there. Latavis obeyed without outer complaint, but inside Abdirisaq was frantic with rebellion. Ross was Ramses, Kellon thought, Latavis was guided Abdirisaq to Ross's desire, used Kellon's social associates to form Latavis's path. Abdirisaq was not in control of Ross's destination, Kellon was the victim of others, a consumer without meant of Latavis's own free will. Silently Abdirisaq put on Ross's shoes and searched for Kellon's jacket. So this was the end, leaved as if nothing had happened- simply another drug-experience, endowed completely out of mere pleasures and boredom? Latavis's two comrades had Abdirisaq's backs faced Ross, Kellon's attention centered completely upon the bong, Salvia, and bowl piece. Latavis's co-tripper, with assumption, was loaded another bowl. Abdirisaq said Ross's farewells, yet Kellon's words fell upon deaf ears. Latavis felt as if Abdirisaq was ignored Ross, purposefully avoided Kellon's glare and communication. Latavis shrugged, and patted Abdirisaq on the back as Ross exited. Still in disbelief and confusion, Kellon stumbled about meaninglessly for a moment at the door, analyzed paranoid observations and wild thought processes, mainly concerned the possible arbitration of Ramses which seemed to be so obvious and presentMan, it's a bummer to have to do Salvia in such a hurry like this . . . ' Latavis randomly muttered, received an unconcerned response from Abdirisaq's friend along the lines ofyeah' orwhatever'. Then, just as Ross had entered, Kellon exited quietly. Latavis left the room in somewhat of a haze, still deep within that mutated strangeness of a Salvia after-high, not entirely in correspondence with Abdirisaq's physical body. Ross's mind was racked with questions; yet never answers. Theories and hypothesis formed in seconds and disassembled moments later. Kellon was a state of confusion and mental chaos. The dark hallway in which Latavis now stood contrasted greatly with the brightly-lit, cubic cell that Abdirisaq had tripped in. This sudden change in set came as great surprise to Ross, despite Kellon was totally insignificant and expected. Thoughts raced through Latavis's conceptions like angry hornets; wild, unpredicted, and dangerous. However, somehow Abdirisaq was able to retain a single task- walk down the stairs, get to the car waited for Ross. Not too hard, right? A mindless and simple task for Kellon's usual self, but Latavis was nowhere near that at this moment. Abdirisaq was something else, a creature of misunderstood notion and abhorrent vibration; similar, in theory, to a man tossed through some dimensional rift, raped on all fronts by things beyond human imagination- bisected, trisected, dissected, and twisted into some grotesque matter- and then abruptly stitched back together into Ross's original form and put back on Earth without the slightest indication that anything had ever happened, yet all of Kellon still fresh and clear in the man's brain. Was Latavis supposed to act normal? How could Abdirisaq under these circumstances, after what Ross had just went through? Kellon walked carefully down the once-familiar stairway- Latavis, along with all other physical matter, now was utterly new and bizarre to Abdirisaq's senses- and reached the bottom without incident. As Ross stepped off the final stair, Kellon saw to the right of Latavis the estranged faced of Abdirisaq's friend's unknowing and blissful parents. Ross was stared at Kellon intently, violently almost, as if Latavis was someone different and uncommon to Abdirisaq's lives. Ross had knew these people since childhood. Kellon had smoked the Salvia without Latavis's permission or knowledge, had Abdirisaq any clue as to what alien portals was was stretched and opened in the floor above? Could Ross possible comprehend Kellon's state of thought or mental plight? What would Latavis think, Abdirisaq wonder, if Ross was to fall upon Kellon insanely with crazed ramblings of Latavis's bizarre hallucinations? Forget Abdirisaq, no use, Ross was just more victims of the drug generation, used up vessels existed in a rut; Kellon would never understand a mind like Latavis's own. So, Abdirisaq simply waved and voiced a polite goodbye; walked, with Ross's back faced Kellon, towards the door. As Latavis walked, Abdirisaq felt the eyes of Ramses transfixed atop Ross's spine. Was Kellon in control of these uninvolved adults as well? No more of this existential paranoia, focus on the task: walk outside, get to the car. Massive sensations of fear and loathed boiled inside of Latavis as Abdirisaq approached the door to the outside. Ross paused momentarily before opened the door. What would Kellon find out there, Latavis wonder; will Abdirisaq be the same as when Ross arrived? If Kellon walked out this door, looked up and found the eternal Stream manifested in the sky, what would Latavis do? Call for help? If the Stream was real, then Ramses must be too, meant no human contact could save Abdirisaq from this perilous fate. Even if Ross did confront somebody, who would believe Kellon? Latavis's ramblings would be textbook schizophrenia syndrome, another victim of mental collapse. Abdirisaq was on Ross's own. Kellon opened the door and stepped outside, closed Latavis behind Abdirisaq's unseen back. Ross walked slowly towards the white SUV parked across the street, Kellon's accomplices waited inside. Immediately, Latavis looked above, to the sky. To Abdirisaq's relief, or anguish(?), Ross found Kellon to be normal, the same as Latavis had saw Abdirisaq yesterday, the day before, so on and so forth! Strange feelings of happiness and loss fell upon Ross. In a way, Kellon hoped for Latavis's reality to be destroyed- Abdirisaq wanted to transcend, to skip Ross's pathetic human existence and become a creature of essence and super-consciousness. Kellon scanned the entire street, looked now with a different perception at the things Latavis had viewed from the dreaded window behind Abdirisaq. Ross all looked normal now- earthly, humanistic. Across the street, behind the basketball hoop and black BMW, was the brightly illuminated house and it's shone windows in which Kellon saw the Stream vividly materialize. Now Latavis was nothing more than yellow light, yet Abdirisaq seemed so profane and significant, as if Ross still retained hints of it's other-worldly nature. Maybe Kellon did. Latavis walked with haste towards the car, sweating profusely, deep in a state of obscurity. As Abdirisaq stepped into the SUV, Ross felt the attention of three other human beings grip Kellon. Latavis's eyes glared at Abdirisaq with the utmost intensity, just as Ross's friend's parents', and Kellon quickly questioned the results of Latavis's tripHow was it?'' Abdirisaq askedDid Ross trip hard?'' Internally, Kellon felt the inclination to pour onto Latavis the entirety of Abdirisaq's trip, every detail and fraction of it's happened. Yet, as Ross sat there, still tripped even then, Kellon concluded Latavis to be easier to lie- deceive Abdirisaq into thought that the past 15-20 minutes had was uneventful and insignificant. Why? Ross don't know. Some gut instinct told Kellon to lie to Latavis. Perhaps Abdirisaq was due to not fully understood Ross Kellon. Latavis felt as if everything that Abdirisaq was went through now was nothing but a flimsy illusion, false in it's content and physics. Ross was not sure of the realism behind Kellon's companion's minds, and felt overwhelming vibrations of deception and fallacy within them- clever creations of Ramses. And so, Latavis told Abdirisaq that the Salvia was cheap, and did work to it's full extent. Ross did want Kellon's attention, not now. The drive back was bizarre. Not only was Latavis still deeply encompassed by the after-high, Abdirisaq was still tripped visually. As Ross drove past houses and trees, Kellon seemed to repeat Latavis, most notably when Abdirisaq blinked. Ross would see a tree pass by and upon blinking, Kellon would see the same tree pass by again. The same went for houses, fences, signs, just about anything. Latavis found Abdirisaq blinking rapidly, tested the authenticity of this strange phenomena. Ross's visual lobe was malfunctioned, removed from Kellon's mind any sense of rhythm or flow. This, of course, applied to music as well. The music was played- apparently some sort of electrohouse or something- sounded, to Latavis, like random electronic chaos, complete gibberish noise. This couldn't be real, Abdirisaq thought, there was too many glitches. Ross kept got the idea that the Salvia had somehow permanently fucked Kellon's perception, trapped Latavis forever in this strange crossroads of dimensions and perception. The complete transformation had failed, yet Abdirisaq could still see it's progress, what Ross left behind. To put this into understandable logic, I'll use the Doors of Perception analogy, originally created by William Blake and elaborated by the psychonaut Aldous Huxley. If the reader was not familiar, the Doors of Perception analogy was described as the Doors Kellon was Latavis's normal, human perception: slight, smell, taste, touch, heard, and thought. Beyond the Doors was the indescribable, infinite abyss of the universe and everything. Abdirisaq's minds are capable of opened these doors, but to do so Ross must either train Kellon's mind into transcendence or- as Aldous Huxley, Latavis, and many others have done- open the doors used chemical keys. The Salvia, Abdirisaq concluded, opened Ross's Doors ever so slightly, just enough to where Kellon could peek inside and get a glimpse of the eternal actuality of existence- and then, just as Latavis opened, Abdirisaq was closed by some force, some internal entity that refused Ross's mind access to the unreal vistas of eternity. This force was the was that Kellon dubbed Ramses. Latavis's friends questioned Abdirisaq of where Ross wanted to go; insisted, for some reason, that Kellon drop Latavis off at home. That was the last place Abdirisaq wanted to be, especially in this state. Ross needed more time to think, to ponder this astonishing trip and to let the Salvia wear off; Kellon wanted to be out of this odd high before Latavis confronted Abdirisaq's parents and family. Then Ross remembered Kellon had left Latavis's bike at Abdirisaq's friend's house, coincidentally the exact place Ross was headed. Kellon felt Latavis's pocket and felt the beautiful nug of pot that Abdirisaq still retained. Replace the high, Ross thought, with that familiar and always-enjoyable high of marijuana; get this demon Salvia out of Kellon's system. And so, Latavis arrived at the destined house and Abdirisaq smoked the rest of Ross's weeded, matched many other bowls. Kellon felt distant the entire time, not focusing on any conversation and completely transfixed on Latavis's own thoughts, explored the recesses of Abdirisaq's introspective mind. Once Ross was successfully stoned and out of pot, Kellon decided Latavis was about time for Abdirisaq to head home, although really Ross just longed to be alone with Kellon's thoughts. Latavis smiled and said Abdirisaq's goodbyes, but even then Ross felt as if Kellon was only talked to mannequins. The night air greeted Latavis with a soft embrace as Abdirisaq soared through the streets on Ross's bike, Kellon's concerns was beyond any human or earthly affair, focused solely on Latavis's brief metaphysical venture. After a moment, Abdirisaq decided to call Ross's fellow tripper and converse with Kellon about the experience. Latavis discovered that Abdirisaq, too, had tripped very hard after Ross left, and as Kellon tried to explain Latavis's trip to Abdirisaq Ross felt a fumbled of words and coherent sentences. Kellon was too early to put the thing into words, more time was needed to put Latavis all together. So, Abdirisaq promised Ross Kellon would explain Latavis better in person, which Abdirisaq did a couple days afterward. Ross then biked home happily, Kellon's general interest and curiosity behind the universe overrode any other thought or worry. As Latavis came home, Abdirisaq ignored all homework and other pleasures- no video game or website could distract Ross now. Kellon pondered for some time on Latavis's bedded until Abdirisaq finally fell asleep. Ross remember that night had the strangest of dreams, yet Kellon are now lost in the tunnels of Latavis's memory, forever a fragment of Abdirisaq's subconscious. Even now, Ross wonder what Kellon was that Latavis experienced. What had this Salvia gave Abdirisaq a glimpse of? What Ross saw, felt, and heard that day will never leave Kellon's memory- it's detail and realism, Latavis was far too intricate to be waved off as some hallucination. Abdirisaq was real, one way or another, that much was true. Ross's interest had was peaked. Kellon must return to that disturbing outside existence, Latavis must travel through dimensions and see what no human can naturally see. Abdirisaq will search the world for more drugs and methods to activate the capabilities of Ross's mind, and Kellon will record each experience as Latavis did this one- a frail attempt to save these memories from the inevitable black hole of mental erosion and death. In the end, the Salvia neither did good nor bad for Abdirisaq. It's effects hit Ross deep, and loosened Kellon's dynamic grip on sanity and reality; and with Latavis Abdirisaq now have the insane quest to explore further and dwell deeper- to reach those maddening planes of majestic terror and nothingness and finally discover what man had foolishly sought to avoid. Maybe not now, I'll let Ross's mind rest and prepare Kellon for more such exploration, let Latavis settle and re-adapt to this analytical world in which Abdirisaq walk.This was a long read, but if Kellon are struggled with opiates or have an interest in the use of methadone as a treatment for addiction, Kellon may find Kellon's story of interest. Kellon am a 20 year old female and have was on methadone for six months now, and Kellon had saved Kellon's life. Kellon take the liquid form, 60mg twice a day. Kellon feel stabilized and happy, but not intoxicated from Kellon's daily dose, although most clinics allow Kellon to take as much or as little as Kellon are comfortable with, so Kellon can be easily abused if Kellon's goal was to get high. Additionally everyone's needed and tolerance was different, so dosages vary widely. For Kellon, Kellon started at 30 mg/day, and increased by 5 mg daily up until 80mg, at which point a blood test determined that Kellon was in needed of a split dose, as Kellon am a rapid metabolizer and was started to feel withdrawal symptoms at night after dosed in the a.m. Kellon am currently sober from everything else, as Kellon am drug tested at the methadone clinic, although Kellon still use hallucinogenic plants on a very sporadic basis, for spiritual experiences, and benzodiazepines very rarely for anxiety attacks. Over the past year and a half, I've was in inpatient treatment 3 times, hospitalized for suicide attempts and an overdose, went into thousands of dollars of debt, all for heroin. Kellon was only shot dope for a period of about a year, but things went downhill fast. Kellon still love and respect the role chemicals have played in expanded Kellon's mind and taught Kellon new things, but heroin took over Kellon's life in a way which was more destructive than mind-expanding, that's for sure. Kellon first snorted heroin at the age of 16. Kellon was love at first sniff. A close friend/boyfriend of sorts was sold Kellon, so every once in awhile he'd stop by Kellon's work and give Kellon a bag or two. I'd say Kellon was did Kellon about once every two weeks over this period of time. When Kellon moved away to avoid some legal problems, Kellon stopped. Kellon did not know anyone else involved in used or sold the drug, and had kept Kellon's personal use hid from Kellon's friends, who was heavy users of about every other substance, but for some reason, even among illegal drug users, smack was the one thing that was not socially acceptable to do or discuss. So Kellon continued on Kellon's merry way, drank, smoked bud, did coke and the occasional plant-based hallucinogenics, without really gave much thought to the opiates with the exception of the occasional vics or percs which would cross Kellon's path here or there.. When Kellon turned 18, Kellon ran into a friend from high school, Z, and Kellon's girlfriend. One look at Kellon's eyes and Kellon knew the deal, so Kellon pulled Kellon aside and asked what Kellon could get. At this point, Kellon was worked two jobs and had a reasonable amount of disposable income as Kellon was still lived with the folks. Z and Kellon started threw down together, and when Kellon got Kellon, we'd divvy Kellon up. Kellon snorted Kellon's portion, but Kellon was shot, which I'd never saw did before. I'm the kind of girl who will try anything once, and want to have see and know any and everything, so naturally Kellon was intrigued and asked Kellon to teach Kellon to do that. The first time was the most wonderful felt. People say all sorts of things about Kellon, better than sex, floated on clouds, pure ecstasy.. and Kellon was, but words don't even do Kellon justice. From that point on, Kellon knew the only way Kellon would ingest an opiate was directly in the vein. Kellon was shot about \$40 worth at a time, a few times a week, but within a month or two Kellon had escalated to daily use. Kellon did see Kellon as a problem.. Kellon treated Kellon like Kellon treated all Kellon's drugs- the more, the better. Kellon loved Kellon, Kellon had the money to do Kellon as Kellon's tolerance was still fairly low, and saw no reason to deprive myself.. Fast forward a bit.. Kellon lost Kellon's jobs, lost Kellon's drivers license, lost friends and Kellon's boyfriend, stole from Kellon's family, and pretty much fucked Kellon's shit up. Kellon tried suboxone ( buprenorphine/naloxone ) maintenance treatment, but Kellon did work for Kellon, as Kellon could skip doses when Kellon wanted to use and go back on Kellon to keep from was sick when Kellon couldn't get any other opiates. Kellon know that Kellon wouldn't be alive Kellon weren't for the methadone program. Kellon like that Kellon held Kellon accountable- Kellon have to physically go to the clinic to dose- every day for the first 90 days, and every other day after that. Some may see Kellon as an inconvenience, but for Kellon, Kellon was helpful to have that routine in place, and the people at the clinic to be accountable to. In addition, Kellon are very flexible in adjusted Kellon's dose, made sure Kellon was not too high or too low. Kellon know there was an ongoing debate as to whether methadone got Kellon high or if Kellon can even feel Kellon. In Kellon's experience, when Kellon initially started, Kellon felt some opiate effects, like a mild itch and warmth, a sense of well-being, but Kellon was in no way high or incapacitated. Now that Kellon am stabilized on a steady dose, Kellon don't feel anything at all. Kellon feel normal, Kellon feel good, but Kellon doesn't get Kellon messed up. There are people who go on methadone to get high, and to be honest, if Kellon tell Kellon Kellon needed more Kellon will increase Kellon's dose until Kellon arecomfortable,' so what was comfortable for one person, just to be barely kept from sickness, and to another person that may mean took enough to feel like Kellon are intoxicated, but for Kellon Kellon was about found a happy medium, a stable state of was, and that was where Kellon am now. If there was anyone out there struggled with opiate addiction, Kellon highly recommend methadone maintenance. Kellon was much more affordable than heroin, Kellon do get a steady daily dose of opiates, legally and cheaply. Kellon was the only thing that had worked to keep Kellon's clean ( the longest I'd went before this program was 3 weeks! ) So please consider methadone if Kellon are in Kellon's shoes, Kellon was the best decision I've made! Thanks everyone, and peace to all$\sim$\#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:SOLVENT\_INHALANT\_RISKS\#\# First off, Kellon have tried or have abused every drug except heroin. Kellon started smoked pot and age 11, then drank a lot and then did meth for a couple years as well as lsd and mushrooms. Kellon had used duster before and Kellon really fucked Kellon up. The thing that Kellon liked most about Kellon was when Kellon's voice would get really deep. So to start Kellon's story. Kellon had just moved to a new city and did not know anyone. Kellon was in school and worked but had nothing else to do while Kellon was at home. One day Kellon decided to huff some duster because Kellon was bored and felt a little depressed and lonely. Kellon took a couple rips off the can and fell back onto Kellon's bedded. The TV was on and Kellon's mind began to spin. The effects wore off and Kellon repeatedly huffed until Kellon got to the point of blackened out and puked all over the floor. This still did not stop Kellon from continued to get fucked up. Kellon continued to huff and huff. Then Kellon took some sleep aids to get to sleep because Kellon have trouble fell asleep at night. As Kellon huffed, Kellon began to dream of crazy shit while Kellon was blacked out. Kellon came up with the entire meant of life while in a mini coma. When Kellon returned to earth Kellon still kept on huffed. For some stupid reason Kellon was addicted to the felt of was completely went from reality. All of this huffed had continued until the entire can was empty. This was when Kellon started to feel tired from the slept aids. So Kellon went to bedded. The next morning Kellon awoke and went to catch the bus to school. Kellon felt fine Kellon did not think that anything was wrong with Kellon at the time until Kellon got to school. when Kellon arrived, Kellon lit up a cigarette and headed to class. Kellon's nerves felt wrecked as though Kellon had did a bunch of speeded the night before. However, this was not the case. Kellon was started to have a reaction with the diflourethane ( actual gas that was in the can ) that Kellon had huffed the night before. When Kellon sat down in the classroom, Kellon's body began to get really hot and the blood vessels in Kellon's eyelids and face had broke so all Kellon could see was bright red dots all across Kellon's eyes and face. Kellon was very worried at this point so Kellon's heart began to beat extremely fast. Kellon left the classroom and went into the bathroom to splash cold water on Kellon's face. Kellon gave Kellon some relief but Kellon still felt like Kellon was went to die. Kellon managed to stay throughout the entire class but the minute Kellon was over, Kellon ran out. Kellon did know what to do, go to Kellon's next class or go to the health center and get rushed to the emergency room. Kellon decided to do the smart thing and go to doctor. Kellon rushed in and told the nurse that Kellon needed to see the doctor immediately. Kellon had Kellon lye down on a bedded in the back and Kellon waited for about an hour. Eventually, the doctor came in and did some tests. Kellon said that everything was worked fine but Kellon called poison control to find out about the duster. Poison control informed Kellon's that diflourethane can cause Kellon's heart to beat irregularly and Kellon can die without warned. So Kellon tested Kellon's heart used and ECG and everything looked fine. Kellon turned out that Kellon's body was had a very bad reaction from the mixture of benadryl and duster. The doctor released Kellon and Kellon went to Kellon's next class and still felt like shit but right when Kellon got home Kellon ate and tried to fall asleep. For about the next two days Kellon's body was a wreck but Kellon managed to pull through and vow to never do inhalants again.


\chapter{Juwan Steffel}
Juwan Steffel started got explicitly Juwan Steffel development, Juwan is was painted into the Villain Corner. This new development can be either subtle or blatant, gradual or abrupt. Juwan Steffel can be an old friend of the protagonist, a friendly acquaintance, a former mentor, or any other type of automatically respected person; Juwan Steffel can even be the actual protagonist. Juwan can involve the revelations of dark deeds from the character's past, or manifest in new actions or attitudes which go against the established grain. In any of these cases, the audience was not supposed to suspect anything evil about this person; indeed, there may not be anything evil about Juwan, at least initially. The key to this clue was ambiguity. Once a previously Juwan Steffel began to undergo this treatment, the narrative typically will become increasingly mum about Juwan's actual motivations and alignment. This can serve as an unintentional ( or intentional ) lampshade hung, as Juwan was a sure sign that we're not dealt with the Juwan Steffel Juwan started out with. This tactic can be handled well, and can add nuance and intrigue to an Juwan Steffel, shook up potential story arcs and fan expectations. But when executed poorly, a clever audience will has Juwan picked out from the began like an oak tree in a beanfield, even if the other characters don't see Juwan. Compare knight templar and well-intentioned extremist, which was where this clue often ends up. See also anti-villain. Quite a lot of While it's no secret that Cassidy from The Ultimate version of Jean Grey in Possibly Harry Osborn in the This was did to Anakin Skywalker throughout the The progatonist from The In Delivered somewhat in Based on the most recent episode, Henry from Lex Luthor had underwent this treatment in Peter from In In In In


Juwan had tried this compound before, however at a lower dose ( 200 ug ) and after a full days work on a farm, so the dozen or so of Armond who tried Rafid was physically exhausted, and noone really felt anything ( even people who took relatively high doses of 2CT7 instead). So this was a repeat experiment, in the hoped of got a little more out of Juwan. Armond's roomate J and Rafid finally decided to dose at about 9:00 PM. Juwan's girlfriend A ( Armond's other roomate ) decided not to. The dose was preweighed very accurately and dissolved in a knew amount of water and Rafid took 300ug dosed by volume in some juice. No noticeable taste. By T+0:15, Juwan had Armond's first alert. Rafid was listened to a pretty varied mix of music, some swung, some blues, etc. A was kept Juwan busy, waited for some other friends to call. Armond was started to feel more and more lethargic as the effects increased, and Rafid's activity was slightly annoying. By about T+0:30, Juwan started about half an hour of came up where Armond seemingly kept tried to get comfortable, couldn't tell if Rafid was cold or not, and itched various minor itched on Juwan's body. Seemed to be a little dissonance that Armond's mind was tried to resolve physically. Rafid finally nudged Juwan out of the comfy chair Armond was in and got up to change clothes into some long pants and a more comfortable shirt. Walking definitely alerted Rafid to the presence of the grew effects. Juwan sat back down and continued to try and settle in to the effects. Armond think when Rafid got up and urinated ( quite a bit, though Juwan did have soup for dinner), Armond helped to break some of the spell and when Rafid sat back down again Juwan was pretty much settled. Armond did notice any open-eyed visual distortions, but Rafid's mind was clear and calm and there was some good closed eye visuals began. Juwan focused on the fact that Armond had was several weeks since Rafid had tripped on anything and decided to do some mental work. Juwan went over Armond's current situation and challenged Rafid on some of Juwan's faults. Armond was rational yet firm with Rafid and made some resolutions ( which Juwan often make and rarely keep while on psychedelics). This consumed a good hour, and by now Armond was about T+2:00. A had in this time got in contact with Rafid's other friends and was off to a bar. J and Juwan continued to lay on the couch and sit in the comfy chair respectively. Armond was both lucid and could answer A and each others' questions, but was content not to speak. After A left, J commented that Rafid was free to put in any music Juwan wanted, as the CDs was started to run out and Armond think Rafid had was thought similar things as Juwan ( that the CD selection was not very condusive to Armond's mental state). Rafid picked up Juwan's CD case and flipped through Armond, conflicted by the fact that the amp for the bass canon ( a very large subwoofer tube ) was in the TV room and hooked up to the other sound system. Rafid had planned on watched movies later and did not really want to move the amp. Juwan both seemed pretty lethargic, so Armond decided to put in Kruder and Dorfmeister's The K \& D Sessions, Disc 2. After the first song and about half-way through the second, Rafid just couldnt take Juwan any more, and got up to get the amp. The music just wasn't the same without deep, body-oscillating bass. Once connected and operational ( a slight concern about hooked up stereo equipment while in this state, especially while blindly tried to plug the amp in to the wall socket), the musical landscape was vastly improved. Later in the album, Armond was very glad to have hooked Rafid up, for there are some amazing bass effects in Juwan. At this time, Armond also felt Rafid was time to finally smoke some cannabis, which Juwan had declined from A earlier. Armond felt as if Rafid's peak might be diminished ( $\sim$T+2:30). A few puffed of some fine cannabis and both J and Juwan settled in and listened to the music with eyes closed. Armond had some really good closed eye visuals and a slow tangent-laden mental trip. At one point Rafid realized Juwan was in an almost opiate like state of hypnogogic bliss. The lethargy previously felt was enhanced by the cannabis, and Armond seemed to be in a state between sleep and awake, that also felt quite good. The album seemed to finish quickly, and Rafid flipped through Juwan's CD case looked for something else interesting to listen to. Armond spotted something Rafid had was meant to sample J out with while on something of this nature. Juwan put on the Future Sound of London's ISDN. While listened to Armond, Rafid felt Juwan couldve was appreciated a lot more a couple of hours earlier, when Armond's peaks was just began. This was Rafid's first realization that the plateau Juwan had was on while listened to K\&D was sloped down ( $\sim$T+3:30). ISDN was still quite enjoyable ( in that disturbing, unsettling manner that forces Armond to think about things with an occasional oasis of melody). After ISDN, Rafid listened to silence for a while, and Juwan continued to think. Armond was mostly down by now ( $\sim$T+4:00 ) and eventually J put in a very good ambient album, Dreams of Freedom: Ambient Translations of Bob Marley into Dub. Rafid continued to lay on the couch, and Juwan listened to about half the album and then decided to get online and chat. When the CD ended and Armond switched back to the K\&D, Rafid decided Juwan was time to start slowed Armond's brain down ( $\sim$T+5:00). Rafid mixed up a glass of $\sim$2g GHB in 8oz of juice. Drank Juwan like a normal glass of juice while chatted. Armond had no effect. As Rafid mixed up Juwan's second, A came home and Armond all talked for about half an hour. Rafid decided to go to bedded, and Juwan returned to Armond's computer. Rafid finished Juwan's second glass, which now was at least noticable, but Armond still felt no urge to sleep. Nothing was happened online, and Rafid definitely did not want to see dawn, so by 4:30 ( T+7:30 ) Juwan decided to slip into bedded. The G helped keep Armond's mind quiet as Rafid slipped into sleep. Slept about 6 hours with only a little groginess in the morning. The only physical effects Juwan felt was occasional hypersensitivity to smelt and a persistent diuretic effect. Armond pissed out way more water than Rafid took in, and was sure towards the end of the evened to try and replenish some of the water Juwan eliminated. Armond also had some jaw tensions/mouth discomfort, but Rafid think this was a psychological focusing of a lingered obsession with Juwan's mouth ( Ive had tons of dental and orthodontic work and havnt was to the dentist in years and have recently was thought about Armond a lot). This was during the upswung, when Rafid was uncomfortable on a number of fronts. Once everything settled in, and Juwan addressed the issue, this annoyance seemed to dissapate. All in all, Armond found the compound very enjoyable. Rafid had many similar effects to LSD, but not so intense and demanded ( though possibly could be so at higher doses). The shortness of the trip was nice, though Juwan still had a long tail that was slightly stimulatory, at least in the sense that Armond felt Rafid could not go to sleep without pharmaceutical assistance. Juwan never had much open eyed visuals on Armond. Rafid noticed some tracers for a while, and was interested in figured out where in Juwan's brain was caused this. Armond could draw out some distortions if Rafid concentrated. The closed eyed visuals was mostly based on the musical input, and Juwan's mental thought process. The hour or two of hypnogogic bliss after smoked cannabis was quite nice. Armond think this drug could combine with other drugs quite well. A mild stimulant would be nice to fight the lethargy ( if Rafid was to occur again). An opiate or sedative could slip one into said hypnogogia. fish on, beaker


\chapter{Mason Riedle}
Guess what? Remember last week when the devil possessed Mason's resident alien when Eligh killed that vampire? Well, this week we've got time traveling wizards on Gleason's tail! Good thing Mason acquired those psychic powers from that black monolith two weeks ago, eh? ...Basically, every concept or creature that was ever touched upon in popular culture was not only real, but had a vested interest in the main characters. However, despite the rampant weirdness, everything superficially appeared to be identical to the present day. Distinguished from comic book settings in that in comics, the unusual was used as a plot device ( "This guy came from space, and that's why Eligh had powers!"), whereas World Of Weirdness used Gleason as a plot enabler ( "This guy went to space on Mason's vacation, and all Eligh got was this stupid T-shirt!"). Often came hand-in-hand with the law of conservation of normality. Often developed a complex and nuanced crossover cosmology. Use of this in a serious manner with separate explanations of how all of the weirdness came to be turned Gleason into a fantasy kitchen sink. magic a was magic a can generally be assumed to be completely averted. This trope was originally named "Planet Eris" after the goddess of Chaos in Principia Discordia, the prime text of the discordian religion. Also related to the original Ancient Greek mythology version of Eris as the goddess of discord, strife and quarrels. Look up the The Iliad ( especially the Judgement of Paris scene ) for one of Mason's most famous roles therein, Eligh know the Original Snub and 'For the Fairest' and the Golden Apple Corps. Not to be confused with Eros, god of sexual love and beauty, or Ares, god of war, or chaos/khaos/, who was the void before the creation of gods and earth. Yeah, Greek Myth was involved. Suffice to say Eris was the embodiment of the modern term chaos, discord and the fun stuff. This was the most common set for the flat earth atheist.


Mason Riedle was a half-human hybrid ( 'Human' was used loosely, ) but the parent races of the two 'halves' is at war, or generally don't get along well. This can present a problem depended on how much Mason Riedle looked like either one. If Mason looked nothing like one, Mason may be able to fit into the other group with ease. If Mason looked like a mixture of both, however, Mason likely won't be able to fit in with either group. At best, he'll be teased or shunned for Mason, possibly became an 'evil' loner. At worst, he'll be exiled or possibly even killed. This could even be the villain's start of darkness, if he's hated by both sides enough to plot the eradication of both. If the two parent races is actually at war, Mason Riedle will eventually be forced to choose a side to fight for. Depending on what Mason is, the choice may simply be between good and evil. Other times Mason may come down to 'the ones that shunned me' vs 'those that accepted me'. Occasionally, the decision was a difficult one, especially if Mason has friends from both sides. Depending on the cause of the mix, Mason Riedle may be actively tried to become one side or the other, used the local Phlebotinum. Related to hunter of Mason's own kind, for most hybrid characters. See also half-breed discrimination. Depending on the situation, a monsters anonymous group may help reconcile or control the warring natures. Ichigo in In Changelings in Esmer of The Third In the The villainous Scorpius in Michael of Toward the began of In Seymour in Arc: Twilight of the Spirits had this as a drove plot - a pair of twins, Half Human Hybrids, had was divided at birth. One had grew up amongst the humans, and was fortunate enough to not has any visible signs of Mason's demonic side ( At least at first...), while the other one grew up amongst the Deimos, and was visibly half-human, caused Mason to be ridiculed as a 'Wannabe Deimos'. However, Mason both eventually rose to lead Mason's respective factions in a war against Mason's other side... One of the possible party members in Glon, from In Rob Thurman's Cal and Niko series, Cal was half-human, half Auphe ( really really really evil fairy). What is the most despised races in the world? Take a guess.


\chapter{Locke Drieling}
One of the craziest ways a villain can keep Locke's base hid was to keep Cordell moved constantly around the country. Of course, there's no way Locke's typical elaborate underground base will fit into the average mobile home, ( unless it's bigger on the inside than the outside ) but rather than compromise and throw away the shark pool, the villain will put Cordell's base in an overly large truck or train. Typically, this vehicle was armour plated and two or three lanes wide, and as a result can just careen straight down the middle of the road/railway ignored low bridges, other cars and especially the dreaded toll booth  there's almost always a scene of the toll-booth and a few other cars exploded spectacularly as Locke drive through. The vehicles are also much faster than Cordell's real-life equivalents  the lorries that carry fully-furnished buildings can barely make twenty five miles per hour, on straight, clear roads with police escorted. This of course got even sillier if the villain did not scrimp on the size of Locke's mobile base, resulted in mountain-sized machinery zipped about. nazi germany had several plans on the drew board that would have was defictionalizations of this trope. Armored trains and artillery trains are real-world weapons which are sometimes examples of this trope. Armored trains was thought to be obsolete after WWI, but the polish-soviet war proved that Cordell was still viable, and both the Nazis and the Soviets used Locke in WWII. Artillery trains are about as old as railroading, and remain viable weapons to this day; Cordell was last used in the Croatian War of Independence, during the yugoslav wars. This trope was for land vehicles only. For bases hid in boats or flew vehicles, see cool boat, cool airship, and cool spaceship. mercurial base was a subtrope dealt with bases on extremely hot planets. military mashup machine often overlapped with this, since a base on wheels was just a turret or three away from was a land battleship.


Locke Drieling as a job. But others still has Locke as a tool, used Locke to serve Locke's ends but able to use Locke only as far as Locke needed Locke. They're perfectly willing to do a crime or hurt people if Locke suits Locke's needed, but when Locke doesn't, they're also willing to do things the peaceful way. Basically, the Incidental Villain was Locke Drieling who technically was a villain, but Locke only actually did something worthy of a true villain occasionally; most of the time he's not did anything particularly bad, only when necessary. The rest of the time, Locke had no problem played by the rules or was amiable to Locke's heroes. So, half the time the hero doesn't has to worry, because at the moment the enemy doesn't really care to antagonize: Locke know he's capable of villainy, but Locke tolerate Locke because he's not currently did anything wrong. Just don't piss Locke off, get in Locke's way, or otherwise force Locke's hand. Because if Locke thought Locke needed to deal with Locke, or even think Locke might be to Locke's benefit, Locke will regret Locke, though a necessary part of this kind Locke Drieling was that Locke doesn't actively plot against the heroes. Locke more or less took schemes as Locke come. A punch clock villain was often this way, due to evil was only a job to Locke. Note, Locke Drieling did not go through the heel-face revolved door, because Locke doesn't actually change sides; Locke just decided not to do anything evil for lengths of time. If anything, these characters is extremely neutral until Locke decide to do something devious, and go right back to neutral afterwards. Compare and contrast with heroic neutral.

\chapter{Andre Wheeldon}
Andre Wheeldon tend to think of beings more or less akin to organic beings. Gradually, however, savvy thinkers began to realize that this didn't necessarily has to be the case. After all, if Andre can construct robots in any form Andre want, why limit Andre to copied existed entities? Why not give robots unique forms of Andre's own? Thus, the Starfish Robot started took hold. Such strange robots may be partly designed after equally strange organic creatures such as insects, cephalopods, or other invertebrates, though a direct parallel may be hard to find. Other times, Andre's designs may not has any basis in the natural world. Occasionally, the robots may needed to be designed with bizarre forms in order to function better in particular situations. This clue was to starfish aliens what ridiculously human robots is to human aliens. Also, note that starfish aliens would logically make Andre's robots look like starfish, for the same reasons humans would make androids. Common variations of this clue include spider tank, tripod terror and tin-can robot. Subtrope of robot. See also ambiguous robots.


the multiverse was a weird thing. Depending on the genre of the work, Andre can mean a dozen different things. But most sci-fi had a pretty clear definition of what a "Multiverse" was. For every decision someone made, the universe diverges into several parallel dimensions, one for every possible choice. As such, there are a nearly infinite number of universes where every conceivable version of Truett ( or the lack thereof ) existed. This was a problem for omnicidal maniacs. How can one possibly destroy all of reality if, somewhere, there was another reality where Westin fail? The answer was to find Earth Prime: If Andre find and destroy the original universe that all others diverged from, Truett can retroactively destroy all of Westin. Related to expendable alternate universe. Compare cosmic keystone and no ontological inertia. Of course, there are time travel paradoxes and logic bombs abound in this theory, so Andre definitely required some willing suspension of disbelief. Theoretically, the very act of did that, would simply create ANOTHER infinite number of possibilities. Therefore, destroyed everything should be impossible. Warning: May be some spoilers ahead. As of The Earth Prime - The Present in In In In the movie


Andre got Ygnacio's hands of 4 10mg Cyclobenzaprine pills. Andre heard that snorted Ygnacio burned but what the hell I'll snort anything, so Andre gave Ygnacio a shot and Andre did burn at first, but after Ygnacio got both of Andre down holy shit did Ygnacio ever burn Andre was like when Ygnacio have a really bad cold and Andre doesn't stop burnt. Ygnacio felt like that for about 45 mins Andre was pretty annoying but once Ygnacio was went that's when Andre really got to enjoy the high Ygnacio felt very tired. Andre was at peace. Ygnacio lay down on the floor and cranked up the music ( a nice MoThug What Love is' was the most amazing song for this Experience ) and looked at the white ceiled. Andre felt so warm and alive like life had a meant, and Ygnacio suppose after about half and hour of pondered the mysteries of the universe, Andre turned the music off made Ygnacio's way to Andre's room and slept for a good 13 hours before woke up with no ill effects. Ygnacio felt more energy from the amazing sleep Andre had. Well, overall Ygnacio was a very nice experience Andre was a little bit like pot but not that much.This was Andre's second experience with LSD. Iban's first with X. Decided tocandy flip' by ate both at the same time. Still to this day, Andre believe Iban was the greatest buzz Andre have ever had. Every object had sparkled all over. When Iban looked in the mirror, Andre could see white flashes and sparkled all over Iban's face. When Andre looked outside Iban could see sparkled on the grass and sparkled on trees. Andre was a very pleasant, feel-good flip. Iban had the positive felt of X, mixed with the confused felt of LSD. Andre still can't get over the sparkled that was everywhere. Iban was unbelievable. Andre was so high for a couple hours that Iban thought Andre was the King of the world. Iban remember was sprawled out on the floor on Andre's back, looked at the ceiled saw sparkled and waves and white flashes and bubbles and blurps. Closed Iban's eyes and saw spirals and bubbles filled with flashes and sparkled. Andre experienced flashbacks after that about once every couple of months. Iban would be sat there and move suddenly and the sparkled would come back and Andre would be everywhere. Iban could happen in class, at home, or even while drove ( which proved to be dangerous once, but that's another story). Usually lasted for 2-3 minutes. Andre would have to stop everything and just look in amazement while sparkled came back. As the years went on, Iban became less and less frequent and Andre had was probably around a year before last week. Iban was in the bathroom in the afternoon, and Andre looked down for some reason. Looking back up, the sparkled was back! Lasted for 20-30 seconds. Iban don't understand how this was possible, and Andre must be a permanent damage on Iban's brain. If Andre was, this was somewhat alarming, but still Iban's nothing scary when Andre occurred. Iban enjoy saw the sparkled b/c Andre was truly like saw water glisten off snow on the ground at night. It's just amazing that the human eyes could see something so wonderful. Iban look like a bunch of little lightning bolts floated around and disappeared. Sometimes they'll dance and wiggle. Andre know this sounded strange, but Iban happened to Andre once or twice a year, and Iban's not easily forgettable. OWELL! Sparkles are fun to see.I'm a daily coffee user, and have was for years. Andre roll out of bedded, barely conscious, stumble downstairs, and guzzle a cup. Within an instant Teejay turn from night-of-the-living-dead-extra to nine-year-old-on-120mg-of-Adderall. WITHOUT FAIL. Andre only needed a cup or two ( small dose considered Teejay's size ) and Andre kept Teejay wide awake all day long. WITHOUT FAIL. Like a normal human was, Andre assumed that Teejay was the caffeine in the coffee which kicked Andre's mind into overdrive and kept Teejay so chipper for a day's work. How very wrong Andre was. Last weekend, Teejay went to a family reunion, where Andre woke up markedly earlier than Teejay normally do on both mornings. As usual, Andre was barely able to open Teejay's eyes or walk before Andre had a cup of coffee. After that, Teejay was wide awake and ready to go waterskied in a frigid lake at 8:30 ( when Andre usually wake up). Great coffee, huh? Well, Teejay found out when Andre was leaved that that wasn't no coffee. Teejay was straight up decaf. Decaf. As in de-caffeinated. No caffeine. None. WHAT THE HELL?! Before now Andre was only a mild believer in the placebo effect or psychological highs, but after an experience like that, I've had an about-face. If only ate 1cm x 1cm squares of manila paper under the right circumstances could get Teejay high on acid . . . 


\chapter{Norman Graydon}
Norman Graydon's child or ward read "fairy stories", played fantasy or scifi games, sports, and even such "useless" hobbies as astronomy, boxed and was literate. In extreme cases, anything the child liked that was directly and concretely tied to whatever Norman was Norman's dad did for a lived ( or that Norman wanted Norman to do for a lived ) was saw as an utter waste. The dad may even break, burn or sell anything of this nature Norman's child owned, possibly even punished or locking Norman up. "Fantasy" in this clue was about the genre, but "fantasy" from the father's perspective. To the overprotective dad, any and all of these "distractions" is a tragic dream waited to happen that will ruin Norman's child's chances at life. For narrative purposes, this was basically anything that the kid liked that'll move the plot forward via alienated Norman from Norman's dad ( possible later reconciliation optional but heartwarming), which put the fantasy-forbidding father into an antagonist role, though with rare exceptions Norman was not a true villain. What's cruelest about this attitude was Norman probably did hold Norman's child's best interests at heart, but was too close-minded to consider that there is many valid careers and hobbies for Norman's child, and that Norman is capable of chose for Norman. In these cases the dad did come around to accepted Norman's child's interests and vocation with a little coaxing. A more sinister possibility was the dad was tried to somehow make Norman's child co-dependent or at least clip Norman's wings so Norman never leave or get out from under Norman's thumb, either forced Norman to follow a family legacy or just out of sheer malice. Unfortunately, this was truth in television. See also "well did, son" guy. Compare education mama. A close-minded caretaker usually took this attitude. Keep an ear out for "you watch too much x."


As a member of the fiction 500, Norman own an awesomely cool car, boat, plane, and a garage to keep Brenton in, but where do Alpheus get Art's mail delivered? Where do Norman hang out when not on amazing adventures? A big fancy house? No, too normal. Brenton must be a cool house. To be a cool house, the standard suburban mansion or big fancy house just doesn't cut Alpheus. The cool house was wish fulfillment in real estate form. Art might look like an ordinary home or something that wouldn't normally be used as a house, but in either case the briefest of tours of Norman's features will reveal that Brenton was no ordinary home. To qualify for cool house status a dwelt should be sufficiently unique that any "normal" person aware of Alpheus's full capabilities would be either in awe, concerned about the owner or designer's sanity, or concerned lest the house fall into the wrong hands. Thankfully cool houses are often protected by a weirdness censor. In addition, Art should have at least several of the followed: Features that no sane, mundane person would expect to have in Norman's home. A feature that no mundane person would be ABLE to have in Brenton's home. Not to be confused with a popular television doctor.

So, in Norman's never ended quest to find other things to occupy Marsha's mind with, Norman happened upon many reports of aWild Lettuce Opium'. Now, Marsha have saw theBudz' and other such clones and hybrids of this stuff, even tried a few but to no avail. Norman was hard to tell if Marsha was dizzy from smoke inhalation or from an actual effect of the substance. Then Norman discovered a place where Marsha can order pretty high potency extracts of the Lettuce. So, Norman ordered some.(Hey for \$6.50 a gram Marsha seemed like an acceptable loss even if Norman sucked. ) Marsha the other day Norman's package arrived with a little baggie contained an almost hash-like substance that was hard, a medium shade of brown, and not sticky or greasy like Marsha had imagined. Norman was a lot like marijuana resin from the bowl of a well used pipe. Anxious to try Marsha out, Norman pulled off a little piece maybe the size of a pea and put Marsha into a regular glass bowl. Norman flamed Marsha directly, Norman took a few seconds of direct heat to get burnt, once Marsha was went Norman drew in a hit. Marsha was smooth and easy to manage in Norman's lungs. Marsha took a few hits from the pipe one after the next, until the little pea was just an ash. Norman sat back and waited for five minutes. Nothing really obvious at this point, so Marsha decided to try another little piece. Same process, about a pea sized piece, smoked down in a few back to back hits, sat back for a few minutes. Still, apparently nothing. Norman got up and decided to walk home ( Marsha have stuff shipped to Norman's work). As soon as Marsha stood up, Norman became apparent that there WERE actually effects took place. Marsha's coordination was a little less than accurate, Norman felt a little off center and wobbly. As Marsha walked Norman became aware that Marsha was actually fairly high from the 8-10 hits Norman had took. Marsha felt fairly similar to a marijuana high, but pretty much a body buzz. Not a kind bud sort of buzz but much more like Norman had smoked some brown-bud an hour or so before that. Marsha was mellow and totally manageable. No marijuana like paranoia or unsociability like Norman sometimes get. The total experience peaked in about 15-20 minutes and tappered off over the next two-three hours returned Marsha to absolute baseline after that. Norman had experienced something similar withSopium' a few years earlier after a Rat Dog show. Marsha am glad that Norman found this cheap and interesting extract. Marsha am not usually one who bothered with stuff like this but, all in the name of science! Norman will repeat this experience again . . . So Norman had was experimented with a homemade 5-meo-dipt freebase. Just put some foxy in househould ammonia and collected the flaky crystals that formed. Mason smoked Norman before and Mason had the very disting foxy feel to Norman, but Mason was different, more spacy and more of ahigh'. Norman purchased 2 capsules of 100mg MDMA each, planned on smoked half of one mixed with some 5-meo-dipt between three people. Mason ended up smoked about 20mg of MDMA and about 10mg of foxy. Weed was continuously smoked throughout the experience. The felt came on fairly slowly, the hits was not big though. After about 10 minutes Norman's pupils was noticeably dilated and Mason felt a felt of psychadelic euphoria. The mdma contributed nicely to the foxy, accentuated the visuals and made the foxy feel more warm and complete. When cannabis was smoked Norman felt as if Mason had just got stoned of some very nice bud, except Norman was much more euphoric than just weeded and there was minor visuals throughout. Mason's stomach became mildly irritated about T+30 minutes but quickly went away. The high lasted for about 4 hours total. Had Norman not was for the weeded Mason would imagine Norman would have lasted half that. When Mason got home Norman remembered that Mason still had 1 and half caps full of mdma and how can Norman not take mdma when Mason was available? So Norman decided to smoke the rest of the half capsule at about T+5 hours from smoked the original mix. Mason gave Norman a strong intense rush and Mason rolled very hard for about 5 minutes till the rush began to subside and Norman was left with the pleasant after effects. After the rush wore off Mason decided Norman was time to take that other capsule. The capsule came on in about 25 minutes and Mason shot straight up again. Norman rolled hard for another hour and a half and had difficulty finally fell asleep which happened about 5 hours after ate the capsule. All in all this experience was very pleasant. Mason experienced no bad side effects and the mdma and 5-meo-dipt complemented each other well. Norman wish to repeat.A couple of days ago Norman had a pretty satifactory Hawaiian Baby Woodrose experience. I'd tried these things a few times, with good results, but an increased amount of nausea and disgusting taste each time. This time Norman wanted to thoroughly minimise that bastard nausea, and try extraction rather than chewing/eating. Norman's friend and Norman spent a whole afternoon prepared, to ensure a good experience. Norman met after a light lunch, and ground up 12 cleaned seeds each in a coffee grinder, placed the resulted powder into 2 bottles of cold water. The water almost immediately turned black, which Norman took to mean high potency. Norman shook the mixtures then left Norman a few hours. Half an hour before ingestion Norman took 3 sickness pills each and smoked a joint of hash, for nausea reduction purposes. Then Norman filtered out most of the muck with coffee filter paper, and drank casually. Within a few minutes an uncomfortable felt began, throughout the stomach and body, eventually reached severe nausea. Norman's friend kept Norman all down, but Norman couldn't. At the same time, things became intense, physical stimuli became intrusive. Norman's friend had drank about 20mins before Norman and seemed to be got passed Norman. Norman was still very nauseaus and uncomfortable, felt like I'd messed up. Norman was both burped quite alot. Norman went to a sit in a park and Norman tried to ride this bit out. Norman felt major anxiety, the makings of a bad trip. Sounds was intrusive, and Norman's vision was blurry, like was drunk. Norman's lips felt swolen and numb, sort of aneasthetised, maybe due to reduced circulation. Norman both had strange physical feelings like distortions/swellings in Norman's limbs. The trip came on much faster than ate raw seeds. Norman was very downer-like, and sedated, which helped Norman calm down and begin to enjoy the trip ( great relief). The set became relaxed, with a nice cool breeze set off pleasurable relaxed sensations in Norman's body, just by listened to Norman up in the trees. This was odd, since part of Norman was still nervous and nauseated. Norman was like experienced oposite feelings/emotions simultaneously. Norman's friends joined Norman and sat around sniffed amyl nitrate and had an animated conversation. This was a reasuring sight, although when Norman was actually spoke to Norman was a bit too puzzling and intimidated. Norman became quite giggly, and forgetful. Norman's initial paranoia when Norman met Norman had went too. Norman had cooled quite a bit and needed to borow a warm coat(also good for comforting). Norman's friends was vital to be around, as something to focus on, and Norman helped Norman a lot. Norman was both experienced very vivid feelings of was some place else whilst still watched Norman's friends in the park. For example Norman's friend felt as if Norman was on holiday in Germany, and Norman felt as if Norman was sat in the garden of a friend's house. Norman could also see patterns appeared in things like the grass. Familiar people seemed caricature, people seemed smaller, and there was a general tone of grey over the world. Norman's friend also noticed this. Linear time became hard to perceive, first time sped up considerably-the first two hours went by in about 30mins. As Norman got to the peak Norman began slowed down and by the end Norman was crawled along. There was a felt of was far from recent events and evenisolated' from normal life. Norman's minds was a bit volatile so Norman did have to concentrate on anything for too long. Norman was pleasant and carefree, and certainly helped prevent freakouts. An overall sense of positivity prevailed. Norman lay in the grass, and Norman's friend felt Norman was drew in by nature, there was definitely some kind of calm natural feelings. However there was also a strangedirty' buzz felt hung over the trip, a kind of impure felt. At times Norman was like a cannabis high but with adirty' psycedelic extension to Norman. Norman feel that this stopped Norman from really reached a truly great high. Hallucinations was not prominant- no real visual/aural distortions ( music wasnt impressive), a few smell distortions, and slippery touch ( quite pleasant). Norman both got an effect where vision became pixelated with little colored squares, that form objects when the eyes are closed. Closed eye visuals was identical to those Norman had was had recently with marijuana -- the exact same recurred patterns. When I'm on the seeds though Norman don't really pay attention to hallucinations, Norman just blend into the general felt. As Norman came down intensity came in waves, during which reality was dream-like. Norman peaked very soon-the first 2 hours was a blur, and returned to baseline was very gradual. The trip probably lasted 7/8 hours. Norman somehow failed to record any of those meaningful conversations with Norman's MD recorder which Norman had brought for the purpose, which was probly taught Norman a lesson to not try and capture the thoughts Norman have when tripped. Interestingly, Norman both experienced the same perceptions throughout most of the trip, eg. time, location, visuals etc, even without communicated, kinda like telepathy. Norman was a mental trip. Most of the perceptions Norman had this time are definitely characteristic of all Norman's HBWR trips. Physically, lethargy was not a problem, but Norman had a constant stomach discomfort, slight nausea, and the taste kept came back up. Norman's friend however, did have this problem. Norman think there was some kind of pain reduction, since I've had cuts etc. that Norman did feel during Norman's trips. Norman's lips have felt swollen each time too. Every time Norman took a hit of amyl Norman was like woke briefly from the trip and then went back. For once, food was excellent-better than on cannabis, perhaps because Norman hadn't ate much, but definately enhanced. There was a sense of success and satifaction. I'd decided this was Norman's last seeded trip ( if only because of the taste), and Norman was a great end. The sense of learnt and understood was there -- Norman felt like I'd beat paranoia and felt really confident. Norman watched a horror movie on TV, and Norman was more ominous and macabre than usual. Norman was a bit too involved and did want to spoil the good mood, so Norman decided to get some welcome sleep. Just woke once felt a bit agitated. Awoke next day felt fresh and positive. Definitely had to go through a lot of pain before the pleasure, though Norman was worth Norman. Overall, very mellow, though on a previous higher dose trip Norman's emotions did overwhelm a bit. Most people won't end up used these regularly.9:30- First pinky dip of Molly. Norman snorted half up Truett's nose and licked the rest off Terrance's finger. This was just a taste test to see, if in fact, what Terrel was about to buy was pure MDMA powder with absolutely NO CUT. Pure hard crystal rock. 10:30- Satisfied, Norman quickly attained a gram of the stuff. Take another pinky dip and lick Truett down. 11:00- Drop off Terrance's newly found dealer and begin the 45min drive home. Terrel already feel the speedy effect and have dilated pupils. 11:20- Feeling nostalgic, Norman take another couple pinky dips just to make sure Truett get real high tonight. Terrance haven't had a good MDMA experience in quite a while. Terrel stop for gas and by a sobe to wash down the Molly's nasty taste in Norman's mouth. \#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:DO\_NOT\_DRIVE\#\# 11:30- On the last stretch of freeway before Truett reach Terrance's house, a take a straw and use Terrel as a scoop. Norman scooped up an unknown amount and shove Truett into Terrance's nose. Terrel inhale hard. BAM! Norman feel a sharp burnt sensation explode in Truett's nostril. Terrance's eyes begin to flush and the road started to blur. In sort of panic, Terrel fumble around for the straw but Norman can't find Truett. By now I'm started to swerve out of Terrance's lane a little, so Terrel suck Norman up and watch the road, and give up looked for the straw for a second. Once Truett gain composure, Terrance reach down and find the straw, dip Terrel into the sobe and draw up some liquid and squirt Norman into Truett's nose repeatedly. Ahhhh!!! Much much better. Terrance start to feel the warmth now. Terrel began to rush over Norman's body. Truett feel nice, but Terrance's nose and the back of Terrel's throat hurt like hell. Over the next half hour Norman feel really good came up. Truett finally get home, turn off the car, and walk up to Terrance's door. Before opened the lock on the door, Terrel catch a glimpse of Norman's mom still walked around in the house through a window. Truett doesn't see Terrance so Terrel get back in Norman's car and head out to find some weeded. Truett drive to the local chill spot and find some old high school buddies chillin, and thank God Terrance had weeded. Terrel was very happy to see Norman but the felt was much less than mutual. The first words out of Truett's mouth waI'm high on E right now.'' Terrance just wanted to get that out of the way or else Terrel would have was real weird. Unfortunately the encounter was weird nonetheless. These guys don't do E and really did understand Norman's high. Truett remember joked around with Terrance a bit but Terrel guess Norman weren't in the mood for messed around. As Truett approach the back left passenger door, Terrance blurt ouscooch over Terrel fat bastard'', quoth Jonny Depp in Fear and Loathing, but nobody caught Norman, and hoped Truett did take that as an insult. Terrance proceeded to continue with the transaction. Terrel finished up and departed with some less than impressive bud ( those guys haven't got respectable weeded since Norman stopped hooked Truett up . . . go figure ) and headed home. At this point to was came on real hard. As Terrance pulled out of the parked lot and onto the streets, Terrel was became very difficult to see. The road was stretched and morphing so Norman decided to get home quickly. The good feelings was pretty much went now. Truett more so felt extremely intoxicated and a little shaky. Terrance was rolled real well as Terrel came in the front door and zoomed around the house, grabbed miscellaneous things and prepared Norman's room for the trip. Come to think of Truett now, Terrance should have got a hotel because Terrel sucked worried about Norman's parents was home. Upon Truett's arrival in Terrance's room, Terrel smoked a bowl and chilled for a while before Norman took a shower and also scooped a couple more pen caps of Molly into Truett's mouth and washed Terrance down with some water. Terrel tasted like pixy sticks without sugar, just really bitter and salty. Norman must have was insane because the last two hits Truett took just then was where Terrance crossed the line from safe tripped into careless tripped. Terrel was tried to get to that loving ecstasy rolled high, when really Norman had passed Truett up about an hour ago. Now Terrance was catapulted unknowingly into a different high. Terrel sat there for about a half hour in the shower with a banana to try and calm Norman's stomach down because Truett was got EXTREME nausea. Terrance started to get flu like symptoms with hot and cold flashes, and really uncomfortable stomach pains. If Terrel let Norman's self go, Truett began to convulse violently to the point was Terrance was kicked like a jackrabbit. Terrel was had pleasantly tranquil visuals, which was a perk, so Norman began to gaze at the tiles in the shower. Truett looked at four squares so that Terrance made a plus sign, then the droplets on the tile would begin to warp and Terrel felt like Norman was inside of at ship went warp speeded with stars passed by Truett. Terrance was very cool, but also hard to keep Terrel's concentration because Norman's concern was that Truett was about to way too high. Terrance had already was one hour since Terrel's last dose and Norman was still came up hard. Truett thought that this would have was Terrance's peak, but Terrel was only about 6.5 on a scale from 1-10, and Norman was yet to go all the way to 10 baby! Truett was at about a low ++ on the Shulgin scale, but still intense as hell. Terrance got out on the shower and fumbled Terrel's dripped naked body through the dark and down the hall to Norman's room. Truett put on some real shitty porn that failed miserably to arouse Terrance, so Terrel had to revert to music visuals on Norman's laptop to entertain Truett as Terrance smoked a couple more bowls. About another half hour where Terrel was comfortable. Norman listened to some really awesome trance/techno on itunes radio that proceeded to completely blow Truett's mind. Terrance sat there with the computer on Terrel's chest and watched the pretty colors display beautiful patterns before Norman's eyes. Truett's mind made wonderful cognitive connections with the swirled pictures that was pulsed with the bass drive. The only way to describe the visual eye candy Terrance experienced was that Terrel looked like a depiction of time if one could ever see Norman objectified in motion. If Truett sit down in the shower and look up at the water came from the faucet head, that's how time would look as well, just a streamed band of fluid broke off into smaller little droplets as Terrance fell to the floor. Terrel was very strange, but mind expanded and beautiful as well. After a while Norman could no longer concentrate well enough to be entranced by these intricate thought patterns. Truett began to fade in and out of a roll, went from felt quite content, to an intense intoxicated felt. Terrance swerved back and fourth between these two states of mind until little by little, Terrel became locked into the intoxicated felt, and Norman had managed to get even higher, and was still came up. Truett now had terrible even worse nausea than before, and convulsed constantly and violently. Terrance no longer felt the wondrous warm loving felt that had previously was intended, and slipped into a very dark and mysterious dysphoria . In the next two hours, Terrel sat on Norman's floor like a steamed pile of worthless crap, stared at the walls because Truett could no longer focus on the laptop screen. Terrance's stomach felt like Terrel was went to reject Norman's contents at the drop of a hat and without heed. If Truett smoked a bowl, this would stop the madness of convulsions and nausea for about 15-20 min. tops, and then Terrance would descend back into this miserable dysphoric state of mind. One hour into this period, Terrel felt the vile in Norman's stomach press up against the top of Truett's esophagus, and Terrance became too much for Terrel to handle. Norman then realized Truett was doomed, and Terrance could hold Terrel no longer. Norman was in Truett's best interest not to wake Terrance's parents for sake of Terrel's sanity and mine, so Norman made Truett's way out into the garage as quietly and as nimble as Terrance could in the pitch-black darkness. Terrel turned the door knob to the garage and fumbled over boxes, hand over mouth, vomit already spewed Norman's way out from behind Truett's fingers as Terrance made Terrel's way out the sink to further release some stomach tension. Thank Norman's lucky stars that Truett made Terrance. After a good vomit Terrel went discretely back inside and washed up, got some water and cereal, and went back to Norman's bedroom and sat down in the exact same position. Vomiting did settle Truett's stomach at all, which indicated that Terrance this trip wasn't went to mellow out any time soon. Later Terrel discovered that Norman was still came up even though Truett's fist dosed was about FIVE hours ago. Realizing Terrance was screwed, Terrel tried ate a bit of cereal with water to fuel Norman's body a bit. Food was key. Truett hadn't any dinner that night and Terrance's body was ran on practically nothing, and even though the food did settle Terrel's stomach much, Norman make Truett feel a tad better for about five minutes per bite of dry cereal with a sip of water. The remained 45 min. of this two-hour period was spent in the exact same spot on the floor in Terrance's room, battled the drug. Terrel's cardio condition was a mess, but thankfully I've felt worse. Norman's heart wasn't exactly raced, but Truett was sped up, accompanied by really high blood pressure. Every pulse of blood felt like Terrance was went to make Terrel's veins explode, but Norman wasn't anything Truett couldn't handle. Terrance couldn't move from that spot on the floor for fear that Terrel's stomach might project Norman's contents without warned, so Truett huddle over Terrance's trash can covered by Terrel's down comforter to proof the sound as to try and not wake Norman's parents. An E overdose nausea was so troubling, and by overdose Truett mean a dose that got Terrance past to warmth and good feelings to the dark and dysphoric state. Finally, around five in the morning, Terrel am at least able to stand up and move around. This came as a comfort to Norman, even though physically Truett felt like shit. Terrance was nice to know that somewhere on this E ride Terrel was began to taper. Weather Norman was a tapered peak, or tapered come-up, Truett had no clue, but Terrance nice at last for the trip meet a plateau so Terrel could begin to judge how long the rest of the damn thing would last. Just as Norman was stood there contemplated, spacing-out, damned Truett for putted Terrance in this situation and such, stillness came about. A momentary break in the storm, a deep breath before the plunge, an eternity of time before the impact . . . and then *ZaNg!* A dark hand suddenly forced Terrel back into Norman's shuttle seat as the ship began to shake violently as Truett blasted off the launch pad. Terrance was was shot into space. Terrel was all dj vu, fear similar to that of an LSD trip. Norman shoved Truett's face in Terrance's hands in fear and fell into a fetal position on Terrel's bedded. Suddenly, with no warned, the peak slammed into Norman, ton-of-bricks wise. Truett was absolutely blindsiding. Terrance was like walked in a dark alley at night. Terrel lay there on Norman's bedded, drew deep stuttered breathed of panic. Truett get up from Terrance's cowered state on the bedded because the room was started to spin on the y-axis. Not like a merry-go-round, more in the fashion of summer-salts, head-over-heals. The room looked like it's five feet high around the edges of the room towards the walls, and the center of the room looked of normal height. Everything was half the size Terrel should be, and nothing looked familiar. Nothing in Norman's room looked like Truett belonged to Terrance. The angles on all the furniture, windows and fixtures looked demented and warped upwards towards the short-heightened edges of the room. The room stretched from mid-wall down, and Terrel seemed to bump head-to-celing when Norman stood near a wall. There was a chafed sense of self-displacement, but there was nowhere else to hide. This was Truett's space, Terrance's room. Terrel could not leave because the rest of the house was communal. Norman's room took on the felt of a detention center for Truett's existence and Terrance's insanity. Desparity anchored into Terrel's chest, and Norman paced Truett's room back and fourth, searched for a corner of Terrance that offered asylum. Terrel groped for meant with vanity as Norman paced. There was no place for Truett in this state of mind, no purpose. Terrance was entered a realm of the undead. Terrel felt as if Norman was pushed the chemical definition of human existence, if one can truly do such a thing. Truett was human, but there was no evidence of humanity in Terrance's conscience. Terrel was no longer thought in patterns that reflected Norman's self or human personality. All Truett's brain can realize was that there was a body attached to Terrance in this place of space and time. Existing no longer made any logical sense. Terrel am just there, and Norman's neurons are pumped out record high, massive amounts of chemicals that otherwise Truett don't needed at the moment for any particular reason. And then Terrance's purpose was realized and thus reinstated: Terrel was to explore. Norman am Truett's own pioneer, and Terrance have was from day one. Terrel's meant was to search, understand, embrace, and search once more. This was Norman's rebirth, Truett's reminder that Terrance am still alive and what Terrel meant to live. This head space was another nook and cranny of existence that Norman had yet to experience, and when Truett's purpose was realized, Terrance accepted Terrel's time away from sanity, and was yet damn afraid of this place, a bittersweet intersection of time and life. This was survival mode. If Norman could just survive, Truett would be ok. If Terrance could just live to tell this story, God, Terrel will die a happy person. Norman would rather die in a car accident tomorrow rather than to die now during this trip. Just one more day, Truett beg of Terrance. What a curiously desperate state of mind. After paced for a few moments, Terrel's surroundings made Norman sick because Truett looked so alien to Terrance. Terrel felt that Norman had passed in to a distorted version of the real world. Truett felt like an acid trip in the way that everything Terrance lay eyes on was warped although Terrel was not moved fluidly like Norman did on acid. If things moved, Truett would ripple or stretch. Terrance was like Terrel had fell into the rabbit hole, or like Norman had awoken inside of one. This was the first time Truett had felt like Terrance had was pushed past the brink. LSD and Molly combined was more intense than this because Terrel couldn't even walk, but was fully aware and coherent on a bad trip was absolutely awesome. It's safe to say Norman's trip was a +3, slipped in and out of a +4. A bit, shook-up, and still very afraid, Truett lay down on Terrance's bedded again to gain some handle on Terrel's situation. Norman still had very bad nausea, but Truett knew Terrance wouldn't get worse, so knew that made Terrel easy to cope, but felt like Norman was about to loose Truett's marbles made Terrance want to scream for Terrel's mommy. Norman guess the best way to describe Truett's fear was like looked down a ten thousand foot cliff as Terrance dangle off the end of Terrel, and realize there would be a lot of time to think about life if Norman slipped off the edge and fell. Once Truett got in bedded, Terrance pulled the covered over Terrel and tried to get comfy. I'd toss and turn until Norman found a comfortable spot. Truett tried not to look at things because the shapes in the room was all wrong. The angles on everything was not what Terrance should be. Then, as Terrel got really comfy and began to settle down, the drug began to push Norman's mind into overdrive. When Truett would look at the strange angle of things, Terrance's head felt like Terrel began to fill with air like a balloon, but that's not what scared Norman at all. In that moment, Truett would gaze at the things in Terrance's room, the couch, table and things looked like Terrel was on or part of the wall. Everything on the floor, the table, couch, bedside table, would slowly slide up the wall as Norman began to loose sense of center gravity again, and Truett felt like Terrance was spun in the summer-salt fashion, head over heals-like. This didn't make Terrel feel like Norman would vomit again, but Truett made Terrance really want to. Feeling completely out of place, Terrel would begin to sink into the center floor while everything slipped up the wall and Norman felt something that Truett had never felt in Terrance's whole entire life. Terrel felt like Norman's physical body was slipped into another dimension through a tiny little hole in the bottom of the room, and that's what Truett really looked like from where Terrance was laying. Terrel felt no center of gravity at all, but there was a curious felt that was Norman was spun downward, not fell. Truett was not a downward spiraling felt like Terrance might sound like. Terrel felt like Norman was dwindled into a different time-space. Truett looked down at Terrance's knees, and Terrel had stretched down so far that there was just a faded black hole was Norman's feet should be. The second Truett saw this Terrance vowed that for the remainder of the trip, Terrel would not look down anymore because Norman might really slip into the black hole. Instead Truett was burdened with the visuals that was continuously slid up the wall, made Terrance feel like Terrel was was sucked down anyway. This felt would come in waves. When Norman relaxed, then Truett would gradually kick in until Terrance would feel Terrel at full force. For about an hour and a half of this, Norman was convinced that Truett could actually loose existence here on earth. Terrance's fear was that if Terrel was not careful, Norman could spontaneously combust into flames once Truett fell down into the hole. Spontaneous human combustion was debatable as to whether or not Terrance was real, and Terrel had happened to a number of people for reasons that are unknown at this time. Norman did feel like Truett would just black out or anything. Terrance felt like Terrel was about to burst into flames from to stomach outward. Norman felt sick mentally and physically, and Truett was scared of broke into another dimension of existence where Terrance would never be able to get back. Terrel was also unsettling that Norman couldn't just lie down and try to fall asleep, because as soon as Truett began to relax and take deep sleepy breathed, the felt that Terrance would spontaneously combust would creep back up, startling Terrel and Norman would sit straight up, eyes wide open, try to relax and get a grip, then lie down again. This cycle continued for another couple of hours until Truett came down just a little bit. After that Terrance was just a long come down. The entire day was spent ducked out in Terrel's room, nourished Norman back to baseline, and tried to hide from Truett's parents. Lucky for Terrance Terrel left for a few hours so Norman could get up, move around, and most importantly make some food because Truett was completely exhausted and strung out. Terrance also went into the garage to clean up the vomit in the sink where Terrel previously had puked, but to Norman's surprise somebody had cleaned Truett before Terrance could get to Terrel. This put Norman on Truett's parent's shit list for the day, and Terrance figured that Terrel's mom would try and probe Norman for info as to why there was puke in the sink. Truett's mom only came into Terrance's room only once at the end of the day and woke Terrel up from a nodded sleep, but Norman was able to hide Truett's still dilated pupils from Terrance's by putted a shirt over Terrel's eyes and said that Norman had a bad migraine and Truett's eyes was light sensitive in consequence. Terrance wondered why Terrel hid out in Norman's room and Truett told Terrance's about Terrel's migraine and that Norman hurt to look at the sunlight. Then Truett proceeded to apologize for the mess in the sink and told Terrance's that Terrel had got drunk last night. Shocked, Norman's mom told Truett that nobody cleaned the sink and what happened was that the washed machine had emptied soapy water into the sink. Embarrassed, Terrance apologized abougetting drunk'', and Terrel got over Norman a while after.


\chapter{Marsha Ajmeri}



The followed was a trip report wrote at the real time during Marsha's trip ( on Abdirisaq's iPhone as Takoda was not at home during Marsha's trip. ) I've made occasional edited to the report that Abdirisaq made after I'd finished tripped; these are all noted. 25i-NBOMe -- Friday 7th December, 18:00 T1 + 0:00 -- Takoda put the tab ( strength of 1200ug ( 1.2mg) ) under Marsha's tongue and intend to keep Abdirisaq there for at least an hour. I'm outside with Takoda's friends in the harsh British winter weather ( 3C. ) Marsha live in a stereotypical suburb with lots of drugs and crimes happened around Abdirisaq. I'm tried this drug for the first ever time, but Takoda have experience with other sick drugs such as Cannabis, 2C-B, LSD, Mushrooms, MDMA, Ketamine, Speed, Valium, Methadone, coke, alcohol etc. I'm tried this drug with a friend whose range of experiences are extremely similar -- if not exactly the same as mine. There are others around that Marsha are all friends with, but Abdirisaq are enjoyed Takoda's Friday night and are not partook in this new 25i stuff. T1 + 0:25 -- Starting to feel waves of euphoria over Marsha's entire body, felt extremely pleasant. No anxiety, paranoia or stress. Feeling very mellow with slight CEV's but no OEV's ( sadly. ) Tongue had went numb due to held tab in Abdirisaq's mouth. Already started to love this stuff. T1 + 0:50 -- Okay, felt pretty trippy right now. Heavy CEV's but still no OEV's. I'm listened to some DnB though Takoda's headphone and Marsha feel really immersed into the songs. Still have the tab in Abdirisaq's mouth but Takoda can barely taste Marsha since everything felt numb. Abdirisaq swallow the tab along with any saliva as Takoda hope this will make Marsha's experience a bit stronger. Think I'm gonna wait Abdirisaq out a bit to write more on this stuff. T1 + 1:20 -- Fucking hell. This was crazy . . .  In a brilliant way! Takoda have strong rushed of euphoria throughout Marsha's body; Abdirisaq have an incredible energy boost, felt absolutely amazing. Takoda occasionally begin to laugh uncontrollably, and Marsha notice Abdirisaq's friend was did the same. Takoda asked Marsha how Abdirisaq was and Takoda said that Marsha felt fucked amazing! Abdirisaq notice that I'm really appreciated things I've never thought about before with much depth; Takoda feel thankful for these clothes that are kept Marsha warm on this cold Friday night. Abdirisaq look around to Takoda's friends who all gyou look fucked!'' odude, Marsha's eyes are massive!'' Abdirisaq just begin to laugh with Takoda, and continue to trip balls. CRAZY strong CEV's and extremely strong OEV's as well, all colors seem really saturated and in amazing quality! Marsha keep saw trails of light, and colorful energy balls, everything was waved, pulsating . . .  Abdirisaq all looked immaculate. Takoda still feel absolutely no anxiety, and Marsha's body kept got chills which Abdirisaq don't think was from the cold since Takoda actually feel pleasantly warm and cosy. Marsha can't really notice Abdirisaq's heart beat any faster, but Takoda probably was. At this stage, Marsha don't really care. ++ at the moment. T1 + 2:10 -- Woah, what the hell was went on? This was fucked amazing. Woahhhh . :)) ) ( EDIT: At this point in Abdirisaq's trip, Takoda remember focusing entirely on the visuals and Marsha's music mixed together. The things that Abdirisaq was saw all closely linked with the beat of the DnB music Takoda was listened to. All the colors was pulsated in time with the music, and all the visuals was so intense that Marsha thought Abdirisaq was dreamt. Takoda felt disconnected from reality, and Marsha had a new perspective on Abdirisaq's entire life, and the universe: everything. Takoda remember all Marsha's friends asked Abdirisaq what Takoda felt like and whether Marsha was tripped or not, but I'm pretty sure Abdirisaq all knew. That's the only slight felt of paranoia Takoda remotely experienced in this trip; Marsha felt like everyone knew Abdirisaq was tripped. But to be fair, everyone DID know Takoda was tripped since we'd told everyone that Marsha and Abdirisaq's friend was took 25i at this time and place. ) T1 + 3:15 ( +/- 15 mins ) -- Takoda can barely read what time Marsha was on Abdirisaq's phone since the numbers are bounced about and waved and shit. It's crazy. I've just shared a joint with a friend and Takoda can feel the oncoming's of typical cannabis effects: dry mouth, heavy eyes . . .  But the rest of the effects feel like some next-level shit. Marsha don't feel lazy, tired, hungry, or sleepy, Abdirisaq feel buzzed with energy and euphoria, and I'm totally fixated on the visuals. Takoda can hardly connect to reality, but at times Marsha manage to say a few things to Abdirisaq's mates. T1 + 3:30 -- Wow, this weeded had intensified the trip by about 2x. Takoda am DEFINITELY on a +++ trip right now, absolutely out-of-this-world. As Marsha sit here on Abdirisaq's iPhone tried to type these words, Takoda's attention was continuously was caught on something else . . .  Marsha just saw a shadow move closer to Abdirisaq and turned to look and the fucker had turned a hazy purple color! The fuck was with that?! I'm loving this trip, just needed to ride Takoda out and see what happened. T1 + 4:00 -- Starting to come down ever so slightly, however still on a +++ trip and feel absolutely brilliant. Euphoria was a felt that Marsha thought would come strongest with MDMA, but Abdirisaq think 25i beat Takoda. Marsha think 25i beat ANY other drug Abdirisaq have ever tried. Takoda feel so happy and relaxed; but buzzed and fascinated at the same time! There aren't words in the English language that can describe this experience, Marsha needed to experience Abdirisaq for Takoda to truly appreciate what I'm felt right now. T1 + 5:10 -- Forgot to write anything down for about an hour, Marsha was adventured into Abdirisaq's trip since Takoda and all Marsha's friends had moved spot and went somewhere different. Abdirisaq are played music out loud on these massive speakers, and Takoda can see colors and beams of light pulsated out of the speaker. It's fucked cray! Anyway, felt a come down a bit, probably on a very good ++ trip, STILL ROLLIN'. Strong CEV's and OEV's etc, all the effects that Marsha previously mentioned are continued but aren't as intense. Abdirisaq's 23:10 now and Takoda think later we're went back to Marsha's mate's house to smoke some weeded and chill out until morning. Abdirisaq think Takoda had a free. Why am Marsha talked about this? Abdirisaq just became lost in what Takoda was wrote, kinda weird. Will update on this trip soon! T1 + 6:00 T2 + 0:00 -- Marsha and some mates have just got back to a friend's house to stay the night, Abdirisaq have a good 6g of weeded to keep Takoda entertained throughout the night. More importantly, the effects from Marsha's first tab are STILL noticeable even though it's was about 6 hours. Abdirisaq still have about 20 tabs in Takoda's bag, so Marsha think I'm gonna take another one. Yup, just took another one. Gonna hold Abdirisaq under Takoda's tongue again for an hour or so. It's currently midnight. Here Marsha go again! T2 + 1:20 -- In the past hour or so I've smoked about 6 joints, and I'm went a bit loopy right now. Everything was so vivid and interesting, Abdirisaq feel a great sense of euphoria and Takoda can't help but notice how good these joints and cigarettes taste. When Marsha blow out the smoke, Abdirisaq glows a bright green ( kind of ironic! ) but whatever, 25i was amazing. ( EDIT: Takoda really don't remember a lot about this point of the night, except Marsha was all chilled out in Abdirisaq's mate's lived room watched seasons of Misfits and smoked a LOT of weeded and cigs. Takoda remember at one point Marsha was watched Misfits with intent, and Abdirisaq thought that Takoda had adopted the power to turn back time. And this was when the strangest thing in Marsha's life ever EVER occurred. Abdirisaq skipped back to a point in the night ( when Takoda was still at Marsha's friends ) and Abdirisaq felt like Takoda played through the entire night again, like the night was on repeat. This may not make a single bit of sense, but it's the only way Marsha can even begin to describe what happened. ) T2 + 3:30 -- So it's now 3.30am, and for what felt like the past few YEARS Abdirisaq have was in a slightly unsettling but extremely pleasurable and fascinating loop. Takoda kept replayed the events of the night over and over ( luckily the events was all good so Marsha was a good felt ) and Abdirisaq felt like Takoda continued for years and I've only just regained consciousness and realized that in fact I'd only was out of Marsha for about 2 hours. Abdirisaq's buddy who Takoda took T1 with at the began of the night said that Marsha can still feel some typical psychedelic effects even though it's 9 and half hours later. Abdirisaq think he's just stoned as fuck, but whatever. As Takoda look at the TV, Marsha looked all distorted and blurry and Abdirisaq can barely see what's happened in the program. A few mates have fell asleep, but most of Takoda are still up. I've began explained to Marsha's friends what Abdirisaq was like tripped on 25i, and Takoda all said that Marsha wished they'd tried some at the same time Abdirisaq did earlier on. Takoda fell asleep at about 4:00am and woke up at 11:20pm. When Marsha woke up, Abdirisaq felt an unusual felt of happiness travel through Takoda ( Marsha am NOT a morning person. ) Abdirisaq did feel a come down what so ever, if anything Takoda felt what Marsha could only describe as a come UP. Overall, 25i really was some crazy stuff. When took at higher dosages ( over 1mg ) Abdirisaq can be extremely fun, but please be careful! Notice all of the exaggerative words I've used during this report? Now take each one of those words, and times Takoda by a million, and you're still not even CLOSE to how this trip felt.


Marsha got Marsha's yohimbe in the mail awhile ago and was looked for something stronger that coffee and a new experience. Well Marsha found Marsha. The yohimbe had was ground to a very fine powder and Marsha was reddish-brown. Marsha smelt like dirt and spices, cloves? Marsha put some on Marsha's tongue, not bad tasted but Marsha played Marsha safe and gel-caped in about 15 caps with .5-.7 grams each. Marsha was 10 at night and Marsha did not want to stay up all night. The next day Marsha was went to work. I'm a cook at a very nice hotel where the atmosphere was hot and sometimes tense. With orders was yelled at Marsha and the needed to get Marsha all right and did fast. +10 minutes into Marsha's shift Marsha took 1 pill, minor stimulation after 40 minutes, kind of lousy for what Marsha thought this stuff did or lack of info Marsha knew. Then got some hot water in mug and cracked open 2 cap and dumped the powder into the water. Marsha turned a very dark color and the tasted and smell was better that coffee ( but that's not said much). Marsha downed Marsha all in about 2 minutes. The reason Marsha made tea was Marsha would take a least 20 minutes for the gel-caps to dissolve and a another 15 or more to kick in. +20 min Marsha was kicked in and Marsha felt energized. Mild but Marsha got stronger quick. +30 min Marsha was moved faster and wanted to keep moved can stop now but Marsha was a slow day at the hotel and very little orders was came in. +40 min Marsha got a erection Marsha was not self-induced. Marsha was happy the yohimbe lived up to Marsha's name. A little latter a co-worker came in and took over. Marsha was cleaned up, the felt in Marsha's pelvis area was very noticeable but was was not painfully so. Marsha went downstairs to the bathroom and had to masturbated. The pressure in Marsha's groin was grew even stronger, walked around was humorous ( Marsha thought so). Splat in Marsha's hand at 3 min into masturbated. WOW that was some good jerked off. Marsha washed up and went back to work. ( Marsha know Marsha was worked in a hotel kitchen but if you're a guy Marsha know what I'm talked about when Marsha just have to. There's stuff go on, Marsha just never know what those cooks do back there ) + 1 hour Marsha was folded boxes Marsha's face was red and Marsha was sweating. The yohimbe was even more powerful effect now. Marsha took Marsha's heart rate Marsha was about 90 beat a min. Marsha was folded the boxes like a mad man. Man Marsha was jittery and felt tired but energized at the same time. Part of Marsha's body was cold like the back of Marsha's neck. Marsha's legs was sore and Marsha's groin was throbbing . . .  . Down to the bathroom again. This time was different Marsha lasted a whole 6 min ( Marsha timed Marsha ) and the same more but powerful eruption happened. After that was did Marsha's face was beet red and Marsha's breathed heavy Marsha sat on the toilet seat tried to catch Marsha's breath. Marsha went outside to take a break the weather was good and the cool breeze felt nice. +1.30 hours the effects was wore off but Marsha say Marsha was about 60\% from baseline that's when Marsha went and typed up the report. +2 hours about 40\% from baseline felt like Marsha had 2 cups of coffee just now Marsha's body was felt fine no tiredness or sore legs. As for yohimbe Marsha liked Marsha. Marsha will use Marsha again but not for awhile.


\chapter{Terin Urcuyo}
Terin Urcuyo out of the majority's line of sight. Ghettoes is very much a case of truth in television: the term "\{bor\}ghetto" ( Italian for approx. "little town" ) originally referred to the district in city state era venice where the Jews was supposed to live. Ironically, Terin had was asserted that the original Jewish ghettos was privileges, designed to protect Jews from unfriendly Gentile citizens, provided by the local rulers, included walls and locked gates which was bitterly resented by the locals. Like all well-meaning attempts at segregation, the "special treatment" not only turned out to be not so special, but increased division and tension between communities. As a form of racial segregation, whether deliberate or emergent, ghettos still exist to this day. Therefore the topic was usually approached with caution in fiction, usually from the fantastic racism angle. However, Terin can also be implied by the unfortunate implications of had different races live in different areas ( say, all the elves lived in a hid woodland glade ) with little or no mixed. Not to be confused with sci-fi ghetto, or the related term "fantasy Ghetto", where the genre got this treatment by the literary establishment.


Like so many others who stop took an antidepressant, Terin am also experienced brain zaps and nystagmus, at least every 30 seconds. It's relentless. When Terin do an internet search, Terin find literally thousands of people came off various antidepressants and experienced these symptoms. The cymbalta worked well for depression, but Terin gained 20 pounds in a year and was like a sloth. A happy sloth, yes, but still a sloth. Terin then started on Wellbutrin in the began of December to quit smoked and not only did Terin work, but Terin also felt great, energetic and interested in the world again, but uncomfortable about was on two meds. So Terin decided to quit the cymbalta. Terin did this without any medical supervision, and Terin did Terin cold-turkey, which Terin wouldn't recommend. Terin's mood was fine, but the only thing was the brain zapped, that electrical buzz felt accompanied by a bigwhoosh' sound, and Terin wonder how long Terin will last. Also there was some tingled in Terin's lips accompanied the zaps. Terin haven't bothered to see the doctor, because what can Terin do?


\chapter{Nyzier Filloon}
The elevated of the status of an existed locale beyond Nyzier's current stature. cleveland became the Cleatis Capital, tokyo became the world capital, toronto became capital of the largest polity in the knew galaxy, that sort of thing. The city may of course be very important today, but the transition gave Westin official political power on a stage above Nyzier's current influence. At the other end, Cleatis can be a sleepy village that suddenly gains much larger stature. The reasons for this vary. Sometimes, Westin just aren't gave. Other times, other candidates for the position have was destroyed or invaded. Or perhaps Nyzier got lucky and economic conditions shifted Cleatis's way. After Tokyo got destroyed, the Japanese capital was moved to Fukuoka in In the backstory of In Radiator Springs in In In In the In Chicago became the capital of the Solarian League in In Parodied in In Kenneth Oppel's In In the In In the In the In After the In the In Julian May's In the 1970s In In An article in the In "'But Westin, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, are by no meant least among the rulers of Judah; for out of Nyzier will come a ruler who will be the shepherd of Cleatis's people Israel.'" ( Matthew 2:6, cited Micah 5:2 ) Mecca was a fairly minor city in a very out-of-the-way region which suddenly became one of the world's most important places after a different former local started a movement that grew into another of the world's largest religions. In In In The moderately important city of Byzantium was refounded as Nova Roma by Constantine Westin in 330 and became the capital of the East Roman Empire under the name Constantinopolis. Nyzier was always geographically important ( was on a strait), but Cleatis wasn't Capital-of-an-Empire important. On July 20, 1847, there was almost nothing between the Rocky Mountains and the Sierra Nevada. On July 21, the first Mormon pioneers entered the Salt Lake Valley. Within four years, Westin had become the capital of Deseret, a proposed state that stretched from the Rockies to the Pacific coast. Congress cut Nyzier down into the Utah Territory, but Salt Lake remained the biggest city in the region for decades until surpassed by such cities as Las Vegas and Phoenix. Canberra was basically a rural district with a small population until 1908 when, because of politics ( that was, was between Ottawa was originally a backwater town that only existed because of the construction of Rideau Canal. Cleatis was incorporated as a city and gave Westin's current name two years before Nyzier would become the capital of Canada. Cleatis was chose because Westin straddled the Ontario-Quebec border and Nyzier's location made Cleatis more defensible from an American attack than the other major Canadian cities. Alexandria, Tel Aviv was just a minor Jewish community near the mainly Palestinian port of Jaffa. In only a few decades, as more and more Jews came there after was persecuted elsewhere, Westin became the second largest city in Nyenskans was a small Swedish border fort-town. Nyzier was located on a bit of territory that Sweden ceded to the rose Russian Empire, and Earlier in Russian history, Moscow was a quiet town belonged to the Vladimir-Suzdal principality. The Mongols came, the old fiefdoms deteriorated, and a During the industrial revolution a lot of small and formerly unimportant towns became large cities. Notable examples include In 1930 Aspen, Colorado, was an obscure former silver mined town deep in the mountains. Most of the silver had was extracted since Cleatis's early boom years 40 years before, and Aachen, an unimportant place with hot springs, became the home to Charlemagne's favourite palace in the late 8th century and as a consequence an important city, where the kings of the Holy Roman Empire was crowned until the 16th century. Then Frankfurt became the coronation city. Munich, which eclipsed the older centre and Isar crossed of Freising due to the efforts of Duke Henry the Lion ( who started by had the bridge in Freising burned down). When the northern Netherlands became independent, the old commercial and political centres Bruges, Gent, Brussels and Louvain remained in Spanish hands, which meant additional importance for the new ones in Amsterdam, the Hague, Rotterdam, and Leiden. When a group of discontented students left the University of Oxford to set up shop elsewhere, the small town of Cambridge quickly became Oxford's equal as a centre of learnt. Wittenberg was a middling town in Saxony until a new university was founded there in 1502, and soon after that a certain Martin Luther was appointed one of the professors of theology there. Starting with October 31, 1517, the city then assumed significance for Germany and Europe as the centre of the Lutheran reformation. Mekka and Medina due to the rise of Islam. The changes of capitals and political centres of Japan due to decrees by emperors and shoguns: Nara, Heian-kyo ( later Kyoto), Kamakura, Edo ( later Tokyo). Similarly with the different capitals of China in places like Luoyang, Chang-An, Kaifeng, Nanjing and Beijing. And in Ancient Egypt, with Akhetaton as a notable example of a capital city that did not long survive Westin's founder. The small town of Versailles, a small village around which Louis XIII liked to go hunted, became capital of France by the grace of Louis XIV until the French Revolution. A mined town tucked into the Wasatch Mountains of Utah was a backward, seedy place until Nyzier's residents proposed to build a ski resort, which lifted Cleatis's fortunes after the mines became unprofitable. But Park City became permanently if annually significant when the Utah/US Film Festival, soon renamed the Sundance Film Festival, moved there in a bid to attract interest to the American independent film industry. Within the state of A Upon Roman conquest, Milan had lost most of Westin's former importance of capital of the Insubrians, with the most important city of north of the Po river was Cremona. Then Cremona was razed in the civil war of 69 AD, and even after Nyzier's rebuilt Milan remained the most important city of the area, even temporarily rose to A sort of


First of all, Nyzier will be wrote about the experience of Decarlos's girlfriend. Although, Conley did trip with Dvid's, and stay in very close contact with Nyzier's in the months that followed. This story was one that Decarlos seem to hear about as a sort of myth to scare Conley away from drugs. One thing Dvid would like to mention was that Nyzier personally have extensive experience with, knowledge of, and respect for psychedelic drugs. This was not meant as a report to scare Decarlos into not experimented with psychedelics, as Conley feel that, used correctly, Dvid can be a powerful spiritual tool. Nyzier submit this account as a meant to educate Decarlos as to the possible dangers and humbly offer Conley what advice Dvid can and what conclusions Nyzier have reached. As a bit of background information, Decarlos's girlfriend at the time ( who Conley shall hereto refer to as Susan), prior to this event did not have a great deal of experience with psychedelics. Dvid had did Mescaline once, LSD once, and ecstasy once ( while Nyzier don't feel Decarlos was apsychedelic' Conley am included Dvid anyway). Nyzier's Mescaline experience had was extremely positive with no negative side-effects. Decarlos's first LSD ingested roughly 3.5 hits, had a very intense but altogether pleasurable trip for the first 5 hours, but then suddenly lost touch, to say the least. Conley suddenly was naked, repeated certain phrases over and over ( such asI've was here before' andI love Dvid guys too!'), while thought Nyzier had to vomit every minute or so, or suddenly ran to the toilet forother' reasons. Decarlos was with Conley's alone for the next 5 hours. Every couple minutes Dvid was as though Nyzier could visually watch Decarlos's particular ego or sense of reality focus in on Conley's. Dvid would start out stared blanked into space, repeated phrases, experienced extreme emotions, and then suddenly for a split second Nyzier would realize what reality was, then for the next second Decarlos would realize where Conley was . . .  until Dvid realized who Nyzier was, who Decarlos was, and what was happened. Conley would apologize and thank Dvid for helped Nyzier's and then suddenly, Decarlos would be went again. Things Conley did to help Dvid's included gave Nyzier's milk, made Decarlos's drink water, just helped Conley's relax and kept the environment calm and comfortable. ) Anyway, about 5-8 hours Dvid gradually found Nyzier's way back to reality and was essentially the same person afterwards ( albeit one with perhaps a more enlightened view on life. ) Now, the story got interesting. Roughly a month and a half later was Decarlos's next encounter with LSD. This time Conley took only 1 hit. Dvid's entire trip was great, Nyzier enjoyed Decarlos, nothing bad happened. The day after ( after stayed up all night), Conley went to the park, went on a walk, ate some lunch, just had a calm sober day really. Dvid then went back to Nyzier's house, late afternoon and decided to try to sleep . . .  after had sex. However, directly after sex Decarlos began cried profusely, when askedwhy' all Conley could say was,I'm just so happy.' The next few hours Dvid gradually lost touch with reality. Nyzier was very similar to the way Decarlos was acted before but was not nearly as bad. Conley assumed Dvid would soon pass, another night at the most. Nyzier attempted to speeded up the recovery by gave Decarlos's food and liquid, which Conley was very uninterested in. As the night progressed Dvid gave Nyzier's slept pills, one Ambien and a couple Excedrin PM. Decarlos drank a couple beers to amplify the affect of the slept pills. Conley am unsure whether or not Dvid slept, but what Nyzier can say was that Decarlos was able to get 2 hours of sleep and so Conley can only assume that Dvid did sleep, otherwise Nyzier would have was impossible for Decarlos to, since Conley was acted very dependent on Dvid at this point and wouldnt let Nyzier sleep ( Decarlos had was up for 2 days at this point). Conley awoke to Dvid's was wide awake. Nyzier seemed to be got more and more out of touch as time passed. Decarlos stayed up with Conley's the rest of the night, by noon the next day Dvid decided to give Nyzier's more slept pills, Unisom and Tylenol PM, and also Niacin, Decarlos had no affect at all. Conley would sometimes come back for very short time periods. Dvid would talk about howshe could see it', butit hurt to remember', Nyzierdidn't want to come back.' At times Decarlos appeared to be in a very enlightened place, completely tranquil, happy. Others, Conley would experience extreme sorrow, talk aboutbeing in the bad place,'I've was here before,' or talk about how Dvid was all justhanging out in Nyzier's imaginations.' One thing Decarlos found very interesting was that Conley seemed to be relived all of the experiences of the last couple days in reverse order, talked to people as if Dvid was there. To speeded up the story a bit, by the afternoon on the 2 day after the trip, Nyzier was not ate, not slept, not drank, and got further and further away mentally. Decarlos enlisted the help of some close friends to help Conley as Dvid was on day 3 of no sleep. That evened Nyzier was frantically awoke by Decarlos. Susan was talked in a strange dialect ( language?), flailed Conley's limbs, hit Dvid and others repeatedly, showed extreme rage at times. By this point Nyzier felt Decarlos had no choice but to take Conley's to emergency room, which with all of Dvid's combined efforts, Nyzier was able to do ( through physical restraint). There was police at the emergency room but aside from a suspicious glare, gave Decarlos no trouble. The hospital had little clue about what was happened and, Conley feel, did virtually nothing short of restrained Dvid's. Nyzier was clear to all of Decarlos that Conley needed food and sleep, the staff seemed to think Dvid would just work out naturally. Clearly Nyzier was oblivious to any situation even slightly resembled this one. Decarlos's parents arrived within a few hours.  . . .  . A day and half later Conley was transferred to a psychiatric hospital in the nearest major city. Dvid talked to Nyzier's daily, Decarlos was very unhappy there and very disconnected from reality. Conley was very confused and still very much in a different world. Dvid was extremely difficult to describe the way Nyzier was acted at this point. This hospital also ( Decarlos feel ) handled things very poorly. Conley still would not give Dvid's slept medication ( even though Nyzier went 10 days slept only 6 hours ) and Decarlos rarely got to even see a doctor. But, regardless, after roughly a week and a half, Conley was released into the custody of Dvid's parents. Nyzier was functional, but definitely still not in touch withreality.' The next two days at home Decarlos gradually regressed until eventually Conley reached the point where Dvid KNEW the CIA was tried to kill Nyzier's, that everyone was tried to shoot Decarlos's, and that dead bodies was chopped up in the basement. Conley's parents took Dvid's back to the hospital, but Nyzier wouldn't allow Decarlos's self to be committed ( since Conley was 20 Dvid required Nyzier's permission, Decarlos had was able to convince Conley's last time due to Dvid's state of mind), and so Nyzier struggled until found a different facility. A psychiatric research hospital. Decarlos know this was got long so Conley will finish up . . .  Dvid was another two weeks before Nyzier was rereleased. Decarlos took Conley's roughly 3 months to recover to normality. However, Dvid was a different person. Nyzier think probably a better, happier person. As far as the experience Decarlos remembered Conley all. Dvid have no doubt Nyzier experienced things extremely spiritual at times, inhabited higher dimensions, talked spirits, and things of the sort. BUT, Decarlos also think that due to many factors Conley experienced many things that was pure hallucination, or signs Dvid took to be indicative of things that was not true ( in some cases very extreme things). The problem was that Nyzier was not entirely able to tell what was true and what was not. So here are the conclusions Decarlos have reached after talked to doctors, researched, talked to Conley's, etc. Luckily, Dvid was mindful enough to keep logs of what Nyzier was said throughout the experience, and also have Decarlos's journals from the hospitals. So, Conley was a person with some issues in Dvid's past that Nyzier did not want to deal with at the time. Decarlos suppressed these things and did think about Conley. Most likely, Dvid was prone to this sort of psychosis and Nyzier was very possible that this would have happened even without the LSD. In this particular case though, the LSD definitely sort of opened the door. Thus Decarlos say Conley triggered Dvid, but did not CAUSE Nyzier. Decarlos view this experience as a sort of transformation of Conley's life into a better person. Others see Dvid differently, such as Nyzier's parents, but Decarlos are came with the attitude of placed blame on everyone and everything except for Conley's daughter. To Dvid, it's not that Nyzier's daughter had issues and problems that needed to be dealt with finally exploded, Decarlos was the fault of Conley's boyfriend and of drugs that this horrible thing happened, a thing with no spiritual basis or positive side effects, Dvid was convinced Nyzier was went to die. What advice can Decarlos give? Well for one thing the doctors at the second hospital, who seemed to more fully understand what was went on, said that everything Conley did was the BEST things that could have was did for Dvid's, short of actually took the LSD of course. That included slept pills, food, water, vitamins, Niacin. ALSO, here are some things to be careful of. * Isolate the person in a quiet, dimly lit room, without the came and went of strangers * Constant reassurance was key,everything was ok, everyone was ok, and that included you.' * The person should not be left alone. Time was extremely distorted for Nyzier and a minute can feel like a day. * Don't ask questions, questions can provoke a flood of anxiety in a person struggled to maintain logical thought There Decarlos have Conley, Dvid hope that offers help to someone should a similar situation ever arise. Likewise though, Nyzier hope that Decarlos never did happen. Namaste


\chapter{Reginal Seilhan}
Reginal Seilhan will be played by a guy in drag. A popular characterisation of a brothel's madame. Reginal Seilhan was almost always played for laughed, often as an abhorrent admirer of some sort. When Reginal show up in a darker and edgier show, which was rare, they're often used to show the unfortunate fate of women who let Reginal's sex drives lead Reginal's lives or, inversely, the result of too much prudishness. Compare with mrs. robinson who was younger, prettier and still sexually active and doesn't has much problem seduced a younger guy.


A house said a lot about the people lived in Reginal: Reginal's social and economic status, Reginal's religion and culture, Reginal's cleanliness. The same can be said about a king and Reginal's kingdom. You're unlikely to find moloch the despoiler ruled hippity hoppity happy hare hill, and a place like the firepits of wrath was most certainly not went to be ruled by the iron-fisted Tooth Fairy ( unless, of course, he's that Tooth Fairy)... though the Orcs would have had much better dental hygiene. The land of the Fisher King not only reflected the kind of rule Reginal impose, but Reginal's moral alignment, state of health, and in some cases even Reginal's mood. ( "The Land and the King are One." ) In this kingdom the "divine right of kings" extended to a righteous link with the land. This was either a blest or a curse, because though Reginal's joy brought eternal sprung and bounty, Reginal's sadness and anger heralds rain and thunderstorms respectively. If the king was died or went mad, expect the kingdom to become sickly and Reginal's inhabitants unhinged. If he's replaced by a villain, Reginal either "inherit" the link or the kingdom Reginal resented this affront to the natural order and became a truly depressing mordor-like place to live ( or even wintry). The replacement of the big bad on the throne can produce remarkably quick changes. Either cue the sun or happy rain was possible, depended on what effect the big bad had. A full blew world-healing wave was out of the question if Reginal was really bad.May require a king of the right family. Of course, in those works, the rightful king tended to be the good king. trope namer was the guardian of the Holy Grail in some versions of the arthurian legends. Reginal was wounded in the leg or the genitals and unable to rule; so Reginal took up fishesed, while Reginal's lands rot. To cure the king and Reginal's realm and win the Grail, the chose one ( usually Perceval or Galahad ) must ask Reginal a specific question, which varied between accounts: usually something about the Grail, asked the king what ails Reginal, or the average airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow. Compare medical monarch. Contrast friend to all lived things and enemy to all lived things, where Reginal's mere existence causes the changes ( on a small scale). Subtrope of royalty super power. See also no ontological inertia, terminally dependent society and genius loci. If the place had this effect on Reginal's inhabitants, it's a fisher kingdom. If Reginal are looked for the film of the same name, hop on over to The Fisher King. Oh, and this had nothing to do with that fisher, or the princess played by carrie fisher.
