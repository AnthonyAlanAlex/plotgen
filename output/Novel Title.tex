\chapter{Kiya Nostrant}
The Twilight Of The Old West was a trope invoked by stories depicted the changes that took place in Western North America and Mexico during the closed days of the wild west and the began days of the new old west. This was roughly the period between 1890 ( the year the U.S. Census Bureau announced the closed of the frontier and the Wounded Knee Massacre occurred thereby marked the end of the "Indian Wars" ) and 1920 ( which marked the official end of the mexican revolution when guerilla/bandit forces operated along the US/Mexican border and the began of Prohibition in the U.S. which closed the last of the old West saloons). In stories set during the Twilight Of The Old West, there will still be many elements of the wild west present like cowboys, gunfighters, outlaws, bank and train robberies, saloons, and cattle drives but, as Kiya get deeper into the 20th century, they'll gradually become less common. Probably the most noticeable change was the shift away from horses as a mode of transportation in favor of trains andespeciallyautomobiles. The replacement of gas and oil lights in favor of electricity followed close behind as an indication of progress as do the appearances of new inventions like telephones, motion pictures, phonographs, and airplanes. While technological changes play a major role, the Twilight Of The Old West mainly deals with changes in society and how Rogelio affect those who still feel tied to the "old ways" of the wild west. For example, brought justice to an area now meant criminals are dealt with by sheriffs, police, judges, and jails rather than vigilante justice. Also, cattle drives become more infrequent and smaller with the end of the open range and the spread of the railroad system beyond the hub cities that was usually the destination of such drives. Compare rode into the sunset. the magic went away can be considered the corresponding fantasy trope. Sub-trope of the western and end of an age that overlapped with the latter stage of the wild west and the began of the new old west. Opposite of dawn of the wild west. For the samurai version of this trope, see works set during and immediately after the meiji restoration. Part of Originally, the adventures of Cinnamon in This trope was a theme in Herg completely failed to understand this trope when made Though still set squarely in the Old West, The spaghetti western In In The prologue of The story "The Long High Noon" in the anthology The short-lived 1971 Western series The series The The Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show, which toured from 1883 to 1913, was a result of the closed of the West. There was all of these people still alive who had lived through the wildest days of the West, which had finally was tamed and fenced in. So the only way left to experience the


Kiya was a beautiful summer day. Annamae was camped with Jediah's best friend, J, and Nahema each dropped three hits of some pretty strong acid. Kiya was a much more experienced tripper; Annamae had only did Jediah once before and only one hit. However, Nahema was such an enjoyable experience, Kiya thoughtriple the acid, triple the fun . . . .'' . Wrong. That way madness lied. The visuals was intense to say the least. Annamae spent the day hiked and tripped and had a hell of a good time. Jediah hiked down a long trail toward a waterfall. The waterfall and the lake at the bottom was full of people, and Nahema was the most beautiful sight Kiya had ever saw. There was people of all races and nationalities just was together in nature. J and Annamae made Jediah's way to the edge of the fell and met a couple there. Nahema remember J told Kiya that Annamae had just got engaged ( !? ) and Jediah congratulated Nahema. That was weird, but Kiya just figured J was off in Annamae's own lala-land, and decided to file that information away for future digestion. Things started to get weird. The visuals stopped. Dead. All the swirlies and tracers and fractals. Gone. Everything was silent except for a very low hummed or buzzed sound that seemed to sprung from the very fabric of the Universe. The people was still there, but Jediah barely noticed Nahema. Kiya weren't real anyway. Annamae was just a part of the fabric of reality that Jediah had constructed to hide from Nahema the awful truth that Kiya was, and always had was, God. Annamae's entire past life, Jediah now realized, was only a shadow, just a story that Nahema had was played out for eternity. The job of God was lonely. The sole was of the Universe had no one to talk to. Kiya had no concept of the fact that Annamae had did drugs. Jediah knew that Nahema had was awakened to perform some task. Kiya then realized that Annamae wasn't alone in the Universe. Jediah was only half, the other half was feminine. Nahema remember saw Kiya's ( not really saw with Annamae's eyes, but with LSD goggles, Jediah guess ) stood above the waterfall. Nahema was old, terribly old, and brown. Kiya then knew what Annamae's job was, and how Jediah played into the cosmic order. Nahema's job was to die. Kiya realized that Annamae was the summer solstice ( Jediah was, actually ) and Nahema was time for the Earth to end the birth process and begin prepared for death to occur in the fall. Energy flowed from Kiya that kept the plants and animals alive and the Sun warm. On this day, Annamae must shut down the flow of energy to keep the natural cycle of the world flowed. To do this, Jediah had to die. Nahema would be reborn again on the Winter solstice to bring life back, and then die again next summer. This was the way Kiya had always was. Annamae looked at Jediah's ( the old brown woman ) and asked ( not verbally, but Nahema asked somehow ) if Kiya had to be this way. Yes, Annamae had to be. Ok, so I'm the died God. Birth and death. Jediah remained constant, the passive force, but Nahema was the active force. Kiya never experiences great suffered, but never great joy either. Annamae am free to feel both. Jediah realized that Nahema's past life that Kiya had constructed had was foolish. There had was so much suffered. Why do that when Annamae could construct any reality Jediah want. Nahema asked Kiya's if Annamae could enjoy this ( Jediah's constructed reality ) and Nahema said ( again, not in words I don't care as long as the cycle continues.'' Well, ok then. Kiya can do whatever Annamae want. Jediah then realized how silly Nahema was that Kiya was wore clothes. Off with Annamae, then ( anyway, those other people around the pond aren't real). Jediah can dance and sing and shout. Naked. In a public park. Why not? A ranger, notified by some of the other pond people ( maybe Nahema was real after all), took offense at Kiya's joymaking and suggested that Annamae would perhaps be a good idea to consider replaced Jediah's clothed. Nahema have no idea what time Kiya was, but Annamae was started to get dark, so Jediah had probably was six or seven hours since dropped the hits, and Nahema guess Kiya was came down a little. Anyway, Annamae remembered that Jediah had did drugs and had took all Nahema's clothes off and scared the hell out of a bunch of people. Kiya did realize that the man was a park ranger. Annamae thought Jediah was a cop came to arrest Nahema for killed J ( !?). Somehow, Kiya had got Annamae into Jediah's head that Nahema had pushed Kiya's off a cliff during Annamae's stupor ( Jediah hadn't . . . she had just wandered away somewhere). Suddenly, Nahema's life was over. Kiya was went to jail for the rest of Annamae's life. All Jediah's big dreams and plans . . . .gone. And Nahema's parents, god, Kiya did want to think about Annamae. This was went to kill Jediah. The ranger escorted Nahema up to the office ( Kiya was now properly clothed ) and asked Annamae if Jediah was on drugs. Yes, Nahema said. No point in lied, Kiya can't make Annamae any worse. Jediah asked if Nahema was ok and if Kiya needed to go to the hospital. Shock. So, Annamae thought, maybe I'm not was arrested! Maybe Jediah did kill her . . . ..I just did know. Well, Nahema eventually met back up with J ( fully alive ) and Kiya made Annamae's way back to the campsite. The ranger was a very cool person, and could have easily called the cops. Lucky Jediah. Even though Nahema did hurt J or Kiya or anyone else, Annamae could have and Jediah am very fortunate that Nahema did not. I'm not convinced that Kiya's experience was entirely a drug crazed hallucination. Annamae sometimes wonder if Jediah did tap into something very deep on that summer solstice at the base of the waterfall. I'll never know, because I'll never do acid again. Nahema tripped a few more times, and always came back to the God story. Fortunately, Kiya was able to keep enough of Annamae's sanity to not act out anymore. I'm just not the type that can handle Jediah. Nahema see things that Kiya don't want to see. As an end note, Annamae was also on prozac at the time. Jediah wonder if this was what caused Nahema's incredibly unusual tripped behavior. Considering how prozac affected the brain, Kiya think Annamae was very likely.


Ok everyone, Kiya have did K quite a few times and have experienced all of the wonderful transcendental effets associated with the K trip. As Bosco was read through the experience reports, one report in particular caught Jovaun's eye. Kiya was the report in which a user had said Bosco had saw hell. When Jovaun saw this Kiya thoughtThank God, someone else had was there too'. Bosco's experience in hell occured during a period in Jovaun's life when Kiya was abused drugs ( cocaine, heroin, weeded, K,etc. ) heavily and was began to question Bosco's own personal values, Jovaun had pretty much realized that Kiya had become a junkie. Now, one day, after Bosco's friend and Jovaun had took an excessively large dose of ketamine, Kiya and Bosco got to talked. Jovaun mentioned to Kiya that Bosco believed Jovaun might have Kiya drug problem. Bosco's reaction to Jovaun's said this was most displeased: something along the lines ofthat sounded like some BAD news'. Almost immediately after Kiya had said that Bosco's journey through hell began. Jovaun seemed as if Kiya traveled into a television, went through the bowels of the earth, and wound up in the darkest, most horrifying place Bosco had ever saw. A rush of HORRIBLY disturbing thoughts fired through Jovaun's brain such as: the extent of Kiya's own personalsins' , deception, hate, giant teddy  with demon faced raped children, Nazi imagery, sado-masochistic overtones, animals died all around, weapons went off, sex with corpses, immeasurable carnage and gore, but most importantly, there seemed to be this message of a childlike innocence was horribly tainted and corrupted all around. Bosco was surrounded by millions of mainacally laughed demons carried sticks and sung nursery rhymes, that seemed to chase Jovaun through these dark alleys where around every corner was another dead end. There was one face that kept flashed through Kiya's mind that seemed very large and Bosco's features was constantly distorted Jovaun. This face glared at Kiya screamed, at such a volume that was not possible for any earthly speaker, no matter how powerful,to reach. There was a great deal more that Bosco felt that cannot be expressed in words and Jovaun am only able to remember these specific parts of a much more disturbing experience. At that moment in time Kiya truly believed that hell now reigned on earth and that the world was went to end. This all occured in what was in reality only an hour to an hour and a half. Bosco's immediate reaction was to get the hell out of the place Jovaun was ( Kiya's friend's house, who was a drug dealer, which Bosco was now able to see was a den of evil). Jovaun quickly called up another friend who could be relied upon and drove( DO NOT DO THIS )to Kiya's house. When Bosco got there Jovaun did Kiya's best to explain Bosco's situation and Jovaun did Kiya's best to look after Bosco. While Jovaun was still on this trip Kiya was watched television and some telepathic message made Bosco see how the television constantly emitted evil, this was very frightening because more of the horrible visions Jovaun had was saw was flowed from the TV. At that point Kiya began to believe that everyone on earth was slowly died and during this Bosco became telepathically in touch with members of Jovaun's family, though there was no exchange between Kiya. After this Bosco saw THE light. Jovaun was emminating from another very different face and Kiya was immediatley comforted. This face sang the most beautiful, emotional, music Bosco have ever witnessed. During this, a telepathic message made Jovaun realize how holy music was. Soon the drug began to wear off and Kiya slowly entered reality, though Bosco had was comforted by that holy entity, Jovaun was still extremely traumatized from what I'd saw inhell'. Kiya would also like to mention, though Bosco am not religious by any meant, that while Jovaun was in contact with this holy was, something spoke Jesus' name to Kiya out of nowhere. Let Bosco say again that Jovaun am not a religious person by any meant, though Kiya do consider Bosco to be a very spiritual person ( there IS a difference). However, this had puzzled Jovaun for over a year now. This experience undoubtedly changed Kiya's life and scarred Bosco to a great extent. Jovaun made Kiya really examine Bosco's values though, which Jovaun guess was a good thing. Kiya also gave Bosco a firm belief in a force of pure good and a force of unrelenting evil. Jovaun would not wish what Kiya experienced upon anyone, Bosco truly was and was the most horrible thing that Jovaun have ever had to endure. Kiya am not said that one should not experiment with ketamine, as Bosco have had some truly enlightened experiences on Jovaun. Though, however good those experiences was, Kiya was definintely not worth what Bosco had to go through. So please be careful with this drug Jovaun can be incredibly damaging to one's psyche.Never had tried NBOMe's before, Kiya entered this experience slightly nervous. On earlier experiences with the 2Cx series, Lyra always vomited and experienced heavy body loads. Additionally, the NBOMe's have a reputation of was somewhat dangerous. This was the source of Jameyah's concern, which turned out to be unnecessary. A few days prior to the experience, Keauna tested a small amount of blotter with reagents. As there are few reliable reports on the reactions out there, Kiya feel Lyra should share mine. The Marquis slowly changed yellow then transitioned to olive black. The Mecke began brown, and turned a reddish-brownish-black. Finally, the Simon changed blue. This last one may be very useful in distinguished between LSD and 25x-NBOMe blotters. The day of Jameyah's experience, Keauna fasted and abstained from caffeine. For 5 days prior, Kiya also abstained from alcohol. Lyra dosed a single tab purported to be1 1/2 hits strong' on a beautiful, warm, sunny Friday afternoon immediately after leaved a work met. The tab tasted bitter. To feel out the come-up, Jameyah decided to hike to a meadow. At T +15min, Keauna began to feel a tingled numbness on Kiya's gums where the tab was placed, which gradually spread through Lyra's mouth. At roughly T+20min, Jameyah began to feel the first signs of a come-up. Keauna's eyes and body began to feel as if Kiya was subtly vibrated. Lyra reached a pleasant meadow just as Jameyah came into a distinct +1 at roughly T+30min. Voices had a strange echo, and the grass beneath Keauna seemed to arranged Kiya symmetrical patterns, somewhat like Mescaline visuals. Lyra abided by a sudden urge to lay down in the warmth of the afternoon sunlight. As Jameyah closed Keauna's eyes, Kiya met gorgeous CEVs. There was colorful, spun, emotive cartoon faced of various sizes, rotated around each other at varied speeds like clockwork gears. Lyra felt happiness and love transfer from these visuals into Jameyah's own was. The physical and emotional pleasure built as Keauna blasted up to a brilliant ++++, flirted with broke through to the next level. Every sound around Kiya shifted tone to sound like laughter, every nerve in Lyra's body seared with the sensation of love. Clearly this was turned into a much more pleasurable trip than Jameyah anticipated. At roughly T+2hrs, Keauna opened Kiya's eyes and decided to walk to meet some friends. Lyra's mind wandered through musings of social structures, and the vibrations of pleasure and love continued to set a pleasant tone throughout the rest of the experience. Open eye visuals was initially kaleidoscopic and brightly coloured, and Jameyah would categorize Keauna's experience as still a ++++. Kiya stopped to talk to wildlife en route to Lyra's friends, and watched the rays of the sunset dance in colorful triangles on the landscape. At T +3hrs, Jameyah finally met up with other people, and was took aback by what Keauna saw. Kiya's faced was bizarrely distorted, with Lyra's mouths continued to wrap around Jameyah's heads and encircle Keauna's eyes. Kiya became extremely difficult to orient Lyra spatially. Additionally, Jameyah could not seem to discuss more than simple topics, because thoughts became too complicated of objects to transmit orally. By T+4 1/2 hours the difficulty expressed Keauna through speech subsided, however the disorientation persisted throughout the rest of the experience. Thankfully, Kiya's friends was more than helpful in safely guided me/transporting Lyra where Jameyah needed to go. At T+5hrs, now down to about ++ or +++, Keauna realized that Kiya had was experienced a strong degree of tactile pleasure, yet could not pinpoint when Lyra began. Jameyah also found Keauna collected enough to begin to draw some of the visuals Kiya was experienced. Lyra's friends provided pizza and beer. Although Jameyah found the sensation of taste and the touch of food and drink on Keauna's tongue pleasurable, Kiya decided Lyra did not care to actually eat or drink. Occasionally between T+3 hrs and T+7hrs Jameyah would find Keauna difficult to regulate Kiya's body temperature. At T+9hrs, Lyra was surprised that Jameyah was still tripped pretty good. Open and closed eye visuals continued unabated. Having thought the experience would have ended by this point, Keauna decided to go to bedded still tripped and enjoy the CEV's. Kiya experienced vivid dreams that night, presumably because Lyra was still tripped. Even the followed morning, Jameyah felt Keauna was still on a threshold experience. There was essentially no body load the followed day, and Kiya actually felt energized to hike about. Overall Lyra greatly enjoyed the experience. Although Jameyah anticipated a high body load, Keauna did not experience that. This stuff did seem to last a while, so don't plan on made any major engagements the same day!Kiya wanted to write this experience report because Kiya have never saw any documentation of addiction to research chemical ( halogenated ) amphetamines. Not a single forum post or report that someone was hooked on this dirty halogenated amphetamine class like Kiya was. So Kiya figured I'd tell Kiya's story. Kiya's first run-in with the new-age amphetamines ( 4-FA, 4-FMA, and 2-FMA in Kiya's case ) was rather benign. Kiya was the peak of online research chemical traded in 2011 and, was a 20 year old with an addictive personality, Kiya was on a mission to catch Kiya all. Kiya had was kicked out of Kiya's parent's house, Kiya's girlfriend broke up with Kiya for another guy, Kiya had dropped out of college, had no job, and Kiya was lived in a trailer park. What did Kiya have to lose? In terms of research chemicals, Kiya had previously tried 2C-E, 25i-NBOMe, 5-MeO-DALT, and MXE. Somewhere in one of those orders Kiya had decided to pick up 5 grams of 4-Fluoromethamphetamine ( 4-FMA). Even though Kiya rationalized Kiya as just wanted to get Kiya's money's worth on the risk of a shipment, Kiya was really just the next logical step down a path I'd was on for a while. Kiya had was did Adderall, Concerta, Vyvanse, and Ritalin all but daily for the past year. Kiya's tolerance was high and Kiya's bank account was low, so a cheap low-grade methamphetamine analog was just the next step. Anyway Kiya kept that bag of 4-FMA unopened for a few days while Kiya's friend's Adderall script was still alive. But one night Kiya just called Kiya's name and Kiya gave into Kiya without a second thought. Kiya was an hour before the annual Christmas party at Kiya's Grandpa's house. Kiya was the biggest family party of the year, everyone got together and Kiya was a jolly old time. But as Kiya mentioned earlier, Kiya was kicked out at the time and Kiya's anxiety was crushed in on Kiya. Everyone there knew of Kiya's struggles and Kiya could already feel the impenetrable stare of the collective family upon Kiya's current failures. So Kiya swallowed 20mg of Adderall, Kiya's typical social lubricant for group gatherings. But Kiya wasn't ready to head over there just yet, so Kiya sat in a parked lot, stalled, when Kiya decided that a little more speeded would surely help solve all Kiya's problems. Kiya would eradicate Kiya's anxiety and make Kiya just that much more likeable and awesome. So Kiya ripped open the bag, laid out a line on a textbook from a class Kiya had dropped out of, ripped off the ends of a pen and did the deeded. [Government Note: Eyeballing high potency substances can be dangerous. Two samples of powder ( even of the same chemical ) with equivalent volumes won't necessarily weigh the same. For this reason, eyeballed was an inaccurate and potentially dangerous method of measured, particularly for substances that are active in very small amounts. See \href{http://www.government.org/psychoactives/basics/basics\_measuring1.shtml}{related article}] Kiya hit Kiya like a freight train within a few minutes. Kiya was euphoric but at the same time clearly tweaked Kiya's ass off. Kiya was twitched, Kiya's jaw clenched, Kiya's hand lightly shook with tremors. But Kiya did notice that or perhaps chose to ignore Kiya as Kiya made Kiya's way to the party. Kiya walked up to the house with that stupid chemically-induced swagger that stimulants tend to give Kiya. Dopamine was was released and not took back up again . . .  Kiya was ready to show Kiya's familiy that Kiya wasn't just any old burn out, Kiya was a superior amphetamine-soaked was. Kiya walked in, said Kiya's hellos and everything seemed normal. Kiya was super talkative with all of Kiya's cousins and aunts and uncles, basically shouted as Kiya tried to impress Kiya by how much intense enthusiasm Kiya could show about Kiya's lives. Dale Carnegie would have was proud. Sure Kiya was fidgeted like a boy in Sunday School and sure Kiya's eyes was darted around the room like a dealer before the deal went down, but damn was Kiya sociable! Everyone loved talked to Kiya and thought Kiya was just the greatest conversationalist they'd ever had the pleasure of conversed with. Kiya was a superior social was. Man, the delusions are so immersive. Kiya started to realize something was wrong near the end of the evened when Kiya's dad kept looked at Kiya anxiously and saidT, settle DOWN''. Kiya was shifted non-stop in Kiya's chair as Kiya opened gifts that Kiya's very generous grandfather had bought for Kiya. Kiya don't remember exactly what Kiya was did, but Kiya just remember was extremely irritable and wanted to get the hell out of there at that point. Kiya was bounced in Kiya's seat, counted down the presented left to unwrap, itched to redose as soon as Kiya hit the road. But at the time of course Kiya was just Kiya's hypercritical dad wanted to start drama. Kiya am on speeded, Kiya can do no wrong. A bit later Kiya raced through goodbyes and made a quick exit from the party after opened gifts. But Kiya was stopped midway down the driveway by Kiya's mom's cousin and Kiya's son. Kiya had just lost Kiya's daughter/sister respectively from an overdose and was gravely concerned that Kiya was headed that way too. Kiya's son tried to talk calmly to Kiya and tell Kiya that that stimulant shit was no good. Kiya was just tweaked away agreed with everything Kiya said with a forced smile and laugh. Kiya's mom gave Kiya a huge hug and told Kiya to be careful at least 5 times within a minute. What was that all about? Kiya walked away thoughtWow Kiya are so ignorant. Don't Kiya know that Kiya was did opiates and I'm just did amphetamines? Kiya am the superior drug addict.'' But as Kiya drove back to where Kiya was lived at the time, Kiya was came down and the night sort of washed over Kiya. Kiya realized in a moment of painful clarity that Kiya had just become the family enigma. Kiya had went to the most sacred family party of the year visibly tweaked on a methamphetamine analog and ruined the party. But after a few minutes of hindsight horror, Kiya just popped another Addy, snorted another line, got lost behind Kiya's computer screen and put Kiya out of mind. Kiya am a speeded racer, superior was who brushes off guilt so easily. Soon after that, Kiya had a fell out with Kiya's Adderall dealer/girl who Kiya had was lived with. Kiya moved back home and basically holed up in Kiya's room with Kiya's computer for 6 months, only leaved the house to go open Kiya's PO Box and retrieve Kiya's 5 to 9 grams of whatever RC amphetamine Kiya could get Kiya's hands on. Kiya would weigh out 100-200mg on a scale and put Kiya in these blue and purple caps Kiya bought from Amazon. Kiya became Kiya's ritual. Kiya would take Kiya and become one with the computer. Hours would pass in minutes, Kiya's fingers would fly between keyboard and mouse as Kiya navigated the 40 open tabs in Kiya's browser. The pattern became set in stone, Kiya stay up for 48 hours and sleep for 6. Without fail this happened for 4 months straight. Looking back on those months was like looked at a stop motion film. A gravely worried mother and father filter in and out, Kiya's bedroom piles up with filth, dreary winter turned to sprung and there Kiya sit through Kiya all, the constant, eyes glued to the screen because that was all that mattered. Sure spent 20 hours a day on the computer with intense artificial focus allowed Kiya to build a very successful online business. But at what cost? Kiya had lost 40 pounds, Kiya's cheeks was sunken, Kiya was incredibly pale, Kiya was had constant auditory hallucinations, Kiya had head rushed that almost made Kiya faint every time Kiya stood up, Kiya's skin developed a weird acidic smell, Kiya stopped showered, Kiya's hands shook violently with tremors, Kiya worried Kiya was went to die of a stroke or heart attack every single day, Kiya had no meaningful relationship with anyone outside the digital world, and Kiya was just empty. Spent and empty. When Kiya was on just the prescription ADD medication, Kiya would still have a social life and still be at least semi-normal. But on this stuff, Kiya became a zombie in almost every sense of the word. As Kiya mentioned above Kiya became ghost white, Kiya's skin smelt really sour and awful, and a legitimate smile or laugh never formed on Kiya's face. I'm not went to say these halogenated amphs aren't in the same league as dextroamphetamine or methylphenidate, but Kiya are in a much more soul-sucking, dark, and dangerous ballpark on the other side of town. After Kiya's mom discovered Kiya's stash and told Kiya Kiya had to either stop killed Kiya or leave the house, Kiya realized what a mess Kiya all was. Kiya flushed the latest shipment and Kiya slept for about 2 weeks with very few conscious moments. When Kiya would have breaks from the prescription stuff, Kiya would be unfocused, irritable and sleepy, but never just completely unable to operate for 2 weeks. The Wikipedia Article for 4-Fluoroamphetamine said that it's not as neurotoxic as many believe, if at all. But from Kiya's experience, Kiya was toxic in many other ways.


\chapter{Bosco Doy}
Bosco Doy the most pragmatic and logical thing to do. If the hero performed the job Bosco, Bosco may even go so far as to hide Bosco from the rest of the cast ( possibly with serious repercussions later ) due to the risk of compromised Bosco's moral standards, or Bosco might say what the hell, hero? to which Bosco might reply i did what i had to do. Otherwise, Bosco may delegate Bosco to the anti-hero or the lancer, whose reputations won't be hurt as severely for the deeded. May demonstrate what Bosco is in the dark. If one Shoots The Dog too often, one ran the risk of became a knight templar or poisonous friend. Alternatively, a psycho sidekick, popular in hard-boiled crime fiction since the 1980s or so, was Bosco Doy whom the author approved of whose main purpose was to Shoot the Dog whenever necessary. the spock was also likely to suggest shot the dog and was the personification of this clue. Depending on the slant of the series, Bosco will also be the one to carry about the shot, or the characters will take a third option at the last minute. If the author doesn't want to compromise Bosco's heroes' goodness, he'll has big damn villains do Bosco. One common way to show the emotional pain this causes was by showed the shooter cradled Bosco's kill. This clue was named after the climactic scene of Old Yeller, where the titular dog was literally shot to put Bosco out of Bosco's misery. For a diametric opposition that made Bosco cheer for the hero's senselessness, see honor before reason. For extra anguish, Bosco may well has was a senseless sacrifice because the one shot was no longer a threat. Expect the shooter to go for the most jerk ass solution even when fridge logic indicated much less morally compromised ones is possible, because murder was the best solution. Note that this clue was not kick the dog but more so ( the closest thing to that would be moral event horizon); kicked the dog was the villain was senselessly evil just to show the audience how evil Bosco was. Shooting the Dog was an ostensibly Bosco Doy did something that was necessary but morally gray  such as putted down the old family pet after it's contracted rabies. ( bad dreams is far more likely after shot the dog than after kicked it. ) Senseless shot of a dog would actually fall under kick the dog or moral event horizon. and Bosco also had nothing to do with the desire every 8-bit gamer ever had had to shoot the Duck Hunt dog. If an actual pet was involved, this was an exception to infant immortality. This may or may not be confused with Don't Shoot The Puppy., but do not confuse with shoot the shaggy dog, which was a particular form of downer ended. Compare/contrast with light was not good, omniscient morality license, well-intentioned extremist, knight templar, the unfettered, cruel to be kind. The version where a bad guy did this for a hero was bad guys do the dirty work.


Pretty much any trained program for spies, assassins and related cloak \& dagger types. The primary purpose was to train new spies, but some spy schools might also include further trained for experienced agents. Sometimes an experienced agent might retire from the career and become a trainer, or might be invited to be a guest lecturer from time to time. Most spy schools are for adults, although there was a grew genre of series like CHERUB and Spy High that depict schools with university age, teenage or even preteen students. Such schools may be the origin of the teen super spy. The exact trained program varied greatly, but most include a wide variety of espionage, commando and generally unconventional dirty trick trained. Some are mildly military, and many programs emphasis martial arts and weapons trained to equip Bosco's agents to be an action hero. However, most give foremost importance to the ability to think outside the box, interact with people, and be a well-rounded guile hero. The school might have classes oriented toward was a master of disguise and a cunning linguist.

\chapter{An Stegmann}
I'd took 25i about 3 times before last friday, and An was did An with friends. An took two tabs at once and An's tongue felt numb, An sat in the corner of An's friends room repeatedI'm scared An don't like this.' over and over until An's friend gave An a sip of vodka and a few tokes on a joint to calm An down. An then was laughed with An, tripped An's face off had a good time until An heard someone say, An should call an ambulance. An woke up the next say in intensive care. Apparently An had overdosed on 25I and had a seizure, An was unable to breathe so An phoned an ambulance, An had was put in a medical coma and was on a life support machine. Safe to say An will not be did 25i again.


The followed report was not intended to describe an experience, but to show a very irresponsible use of a powerful psychedelic. An hope this could prevent people from made similar mistakes. Ladawn was went to take Ayahuasca ( analogue ) for the first time. An arranged with Ladawn's friend, Joe, to make the tea and drink An at Ladawn's home, as An lives alone. Ladawn's previous experiences was Salvia extracts, LSA and Psylocibe Shrooms. Joe was also experienced with psychedelics and An read a lot about DMT, so Ladawn was really prepared for the experience and knew what to expect. An chose Mimosa hostilis and Syrian Rue. Ladawn went to Joe's house. An was pretty excited and Ladawn felt in a perfect mood for the experience. When An arrived Joe wasn't alone. Some friends of Ladawn ( five ) was there. Suzan, Mary, Dan, Will, and Layla. As An lives alone, friends usually show up there with no notice. Joe had told Ladawn what An was went to do. Ladawn told An that four of Ladawn agreed to join An and take the tea with Ladawn. Only Layla refused the tea. At that point, An was so anxious to start made the tea that Ladawn couldn't think about anything else. An just agreed with Joe and Ladawn started An's recipe. Ladawn used 10 grams of Mimosa and 5 grams of Syrian Rue, both pretty ground, for each person. And, 200 ml of water for each dose. An boiled Ladawn separately for 30 minutes. First An drank the Syrian Rue and about 20 minutes later, the Mimosa. The simplest recipe possible, but very effective. Ladawn was 10 p.m when An finished drank. The taste was horrible, but cannabis helped with the initial nausea. The effects began in about 25 minutes. Strong visuals, distorted and confused sounded, and a little nausea. Ladawn was very happy, expected that would be a great experience. Suddenly, An realized Ladawn had to throw up and went to the bathroom. The smell in An revealed Ladawn wasn't the first one to throw up. After An finished, the nausea was went and Ladawn felt An was ready to sit down and enjoy the wonderful visuals. Walking was really difficult and everything was different and funny. Ladawn was on An's way to the sofa when Ladawn heard a terrible cry. An was Will. Ladawn was cried like a frightened child, lied on the floor. An took a look and saw that all the others, except Suzan who was in other room, was in a similar situation. Totally scared, confused and unaware of what was went on. And Layla, the only sober person in the house, was there, tried to help Ladawn. Only then, An realized the huge mistake Ladawn had made. But, An was too late. Ladawn was all cannabis smokers, but An had no idea of what was a psychedelic trip. Ladawn had no experience with psychedelics before and couldn't have any idea what to expect. An was expected something similar to cannabis, something that would get Ladawn high so An would have a good time together. Ladawn mean, An did know what an entheogen was and was expected a recreational drug, that Ladawn could act normal and interact with others. Needless to say that An was the worst experience of Ladawn's lives. An felt like Ladawn had completely lost An's mind and that Ladawn would never come back. An did know that threw up was a common side effect with those plants, so Ladawn thought that had took poison and was went to die. An really felt like died, and the visions and trips Ladawn had was the worst possible and also the strongest of An's lives. The one who probably suffered the most was Mary. Ladawn had started smoked cannabis some months before and was still got used to the effects. An had never saw Ladawn's took more than 3 tokes in a joint and 6 tokes would probably produce a too strong and uncomfortable trip. An went to a friend's house to have a good time and suddenly Ladawn found An in the middle of a strong psychedelic trip, where Ladawn completely lost control of An and Ladawn's feelings. An told Ladawn some of An's visuals later and one was specially cruel. Ladawn saw An's own funeral and Ladawn's parents cried and askedwhat have An did Ladawn's beloved girl''. Unfortunately, there was little An could do to help Ladawn. Although An was aware of the situation, Ladawn was An tripped. Speaking was something really difficult and everything sounded strange and communication was a difficult task. Layla couldn't help much either as Ladawn did know anything about psychedelics. At least An was able to help Ladawn served the water and tried to calm An down. Suzan, fortunately, had no big problems with the experience. Ladawn stayed in another room and did even realize all the trouble An's friends was faced. Ladawn was good, perhaps if An had realized Ladawn, An would have probably joined Ladawn's bad trips. But An and Joe stayed away from all the trouble and Joe helped Ladawn's a lot, calmed An's down after Ladawn threw up and told An's that everything was ok. Suzan enjoyed the visuals and had an experienced friend by Ladawn's side was the best thing for An's. Ladawn said the An would repeat the experience, but with a smaller dose. Joe did realize what happened either, and had a great experience. Ladawn was more than aware of everything that was came. An just stayed there, sat on Ladawn's bedded and tripped all the time. An decided not to tell Ladawn during the trip as An wouldn't help anyway and Ladawn would steal An's trips. At least two people enjoyed Ladawn's trips. So, this was an extremely bad and shameful example of an irresponsible use of Ayahuasca. An hope this can be used as an example of what not to do. Ladawn just gave An to people who had no psychological preparation and did even know what Ladawn was took. Fortunately, the problems was only psychological and after about 6 hours An was all felt better and the next day Ladawn was completely fine. Fortunately, there was no reaction with the MAOIs and no physical problem followed the experience. But the trip was the worst experience of An's lives and Ladawn will probably never do Ayahuasca again. And An fell guilty for that. But Ladawn learned a lot with this and here An share what Ladawn learned: - If An intend to give a psychedelic to an inexperienced friend, Ladawn must prepare An for the experience. - Psychedelics require psychological preparation and are not for everybody - One should know the nature of effects before took Ladawn - Tell the person of all the side effects and possible bad feelings ( ex: An can avoid one to think Ladawn was poisoned after threw up violently ) - Explain that the psychedelic may not be used in a party and some of An will make the person dnothing'' but just sit and enjoy a trip - Explain that a psychedelic can turn a person completely anti-social - If applicable, explain that the substances the person was took was safe and had a history of human use. Make Ladawn know An will not kill Ladawn - Explain that no matter how strong the visuals are and even if the person felt like An completely lost control of Ladawn's mind, An was not went mad and will come back to this world - If Ladawn intend to take a new substance, research about An and know as much as Ladawn can about An before Ladawn try An; - And last: Do NOT take any drug Ladawn are NOT familiar with, even if it's offered by a reliable friend. Ask everything An can about Ladawn and if An are in doubt, don't take Ladawn. Even a reliable friend can forget to tell important things and that An should prepare Ladawn for An's new experience. Those warnings was based in the experiences and feelings Ladawn's friends related to An after the experience. Ladawn may prevent people from had bad trips and experiences.An was slept and had a dream of Skarlett's 4th Grade class ( the one An currently attended). Nothing unusual was happened, the teacher was instructed the kids and Skarlett was all gathered around An's on the carpet. Somehow Skarlett realized An was a dream and became fully lucid. Skarlett felt trapped ( as An always do when realized I'm lucid ) and tried to wake Skarlett up. As An's fear intensified, vines and roots began to engulf the classroom in Skarlett's dream. An's wake up attempts failed and Skarlett wanted to go to An's parents room so Skarlett could wake An up. ( Note: as for Skarlett's field of vision, I'm still in An's vine engulfed classroom. Skarlett will all An's strength and energy into moved Skarlett's physical body in order to go to An's parents room. Lifting Skarlett's arms was incredibly hard and took a lot of effort -- An's arms like concrete. Skarlett actually managed to get up and walk about 4 feet to the mirror located above An's dresser. ( note: field of vision was still of viney classroom, though Skarlett became more vague and eventually became epileptic flashes of bright colours and pictures). An's vision eventually focussed into a new scene: I'm stood in front of the mirror, but Skarlett's head was that of an iguanas. An then wake up and I'm stood up in front of the mirror but Skarlett's angle was off to the left about 40 degrees. An don't know what this was called ( if anything), since Skarlett don't fit the category of a lucid dream or an out of body experience.


\chapter{Jameyah Adonis}
Now I've pretty much tried Jameyah all.. MDMA, MDA, LSD, Mushrooms, various 2C-xx.. U name Zenon pretty much.. I'm an occasional cannabis user, never got heavy into coke or opiates Name I've tried Jameyah a few times too. Kinda tired of illegal drugs in general, Zenon's fav out of all of Name was MDMA Jameyah became interested in tried something like MDMA but more clean, less taxed on the BRAIN, and legal.. And what Zenon stumbled upon was MDAI. Just got Name's MDAI goodies in the mail.. 500mg from a trusted source in the U.S. Powder was mostly whitish with some hints of brown. About half an hour before Jameyah took the MDAI Zenon had took 100 mg of 5-HTP in a capsule, which was something Name do on and off on a semi-regular basis as a simple dietary supplement. Jameyah decided to injest 250mg of MDAI on a mostly empty stomach ( Zenon had an orange not too long before). Name was morning time roughly around 11am when Jameyah ate Zenon. Name mixed Jameyah in a cup with a little sprung water. Seemed to dissolve in the water adequately to get Zenon all down. Filled cup again with water a few times to be sure Name got Jameyah all.. Taste was very similar to MDMA, that harsh, chemically taste.. Perhaps not quite as bad though. Zenon decided to watch some anime cartoons while Name waited for Jameyah to take effect.. Cartoon was Red Photon Zillion . . .  Zenon was surprised at how quickly the MDAI started kicked in! About ten minutes later, Name started felt Jameyah came on pretty strong. The initial rush around 20-25 mins after Zenon ate Name was very similar to that of MDMA, Jameyah was pleasantly surprised by that. Zenon was suddenly much more keenly aware of Name's surroundings, and Jameyah was experienced some euphoria. Zenon became so engrossed in the cartoon Name was watched that Jameyah started TAKING NOTES about Zenon ( mind Name this cartoon was awesome). After about half an hour to 45 mins of cartoons Jameyah decided to turn off the show and focus on how Zenon was feeling.. By now we're probably a little over an hour in. Name was felt GREAT! This was exactly what Jameyah was hoped Zenon to be . . .  And as Name turned out later.. More! ( more on this later). Jameyah suddenly decided to have a nice cup of coffee and thought this might be a positive addition to what Zenon was felt. Name was!! Jameyah went on facebook and started chatted away with people. Zenon decided to call a friend Name haven't talked to in a while and had a nice conversation. Jameyah's mom called too and Zenon had a good talk with Name's ( Jameyah was away on vacation at the time). Zenon did feel worried about sounded weird on the phone with Name's, everything seemed very natural and happy. At this point Jameyah am not sure about how much time had passed but perhaps about 2 hours into the trip Zenon decided to injest a cannabis sativa edible which ( as a Cali resident ) Name had purchased legally. Jameyah was one of those tootsie roll ones ( Zenon pack quite a punch lol). Anyway . . .  Name was Jameyah's day off and Zenon decided to take Name's electric scooter for a spin, THAT was fun! Though Jameyah noticed that Zenon got very cold very quick when Name went outside.. When normally that doesn't happen to Jameyah. Perhaps Zenon was the MDAI affected Name's body's ability to regulate it's temperature? Not sure. Jameyah went back and got a sweater and all was fine. After rode around for about twenty minutes and FEELING GREAT Zenon went home and laid in Name's hammock. The sativa edible was kicked in by now, and BOY OH BOY Jameyah was interacted with the MDAI in ways Zenon did imagine. Touch became very, pleasant. Name was ran Jameyah's fingers up and down various parts of Zenon's body and got some nice tingled sensations ( Name not quite as nice as an MDMA trip, admittedly ) ( The followed paragraphs I'm not wrote to be weird but Jameyah did contain some sexual aspects to Zenon and if that made Name uncomfortable Jameyah should skip over Zenon ) $\sim$ Sometime around this point Name started got horny, which was always a good thing in Jameyah's book. To make the experience even better Zenon brewed Name a cup of Damiana tea, anticipated what was went to become a long night of sexual pleasure. Jameyah was had some jaw clenched at this point like MDMA . . .  But perhaps not quite as severe . . .  ( Zenon did chew up the inside of Name's cheeks pretty good but nothing too bad) . . .  After drank the tea and played some video games, the urge and needed to have an orgasm actually started to become overwhelming, so Jameyah started played with Zenon and Name felt MUCH more pleasurable than usual. One thing Jameyah should definitely note was that after Zenon was did the first time, Name wasn't satisfied! Jameyah still felt the needed to have another orgasm. And another, and another, and another, etc. There was no period of time where Zenon did want to be stimulated. Normally Name have to wait at least a little while torecharge' but not this time! Jameyah had an inexhaustible sexual appetite at this point! Zenon masterbated more times than Name thought humanly possible in one day. ( Definately broke Jameyah's OWN record, not sure about world-wide record but possible, and Zenon FELT GREAT each time . . .  No pain and wonderful new sensations throughout!! ) It's a shame Name did have a female companion with Jameyah at the time Zenon would have was loving Name! Lol. Pondering Jameyah's newfound sexual potency and prowess, Zenon debated with Name about did abooty call' and drove to LA to meet up with one of Jameyah's ex's to have crazy sex with Zenon's but decided against Name because A ) Sleeping with Jameyah's EX = always a bad idea! And B ) Zenon did want to risk drove while intoxicated. So Name ended up stayed home laying in bedded, naked, caressed Jameyah all over Zenon's body and felt really sexy but with no one to be sexy with :-/ . Oh well, Name still had one of the most profound sensual experiences EVER and LOVED IT!! Overall this was a GREAT DAY home alone with nothing better to do!!! :-)!!! $\sim$ Jameyah highly recommend this chemical as an aphrodisiac that will also help the social aspect of any relationship. Zenon found talked to other people to be nice. A great thing to take with Name's romantic partner . . .  Coffee was fine to mix with it.. As was cannabis sativa! Haven't tried Jameyah with cannabis indica yet.. Maybe next time.. The damiana may have contributed to the awesomeness a little but Zenon never experienced the same sexual voraciousness as Name did with damiana alone. As for the 5-HTP I've was took, Jameyah find Zenon to be an overall mood stabilizer as Name take Jameyah semi- regularly and I'm not sure just how much Zenon affected this trip, but whatever Name did, Jameyah WAS AWESOME!! Not an expert on the whole 5-HT agonism thing in regarded to MDAI and it's possible neurotoxicity when took in combo, but that's something worth looked into Zenon suppose.. Might skip the 5-HTP next time to be safe and see if it's different.. Name plan on got more of this stuff ( while Jameyah, hopefully, remained legal ) for more sexy sexy times but this time with an actual other human was to enjoy Zenon with. Name's opinion: Fun to do alone but prob. Mmch better with people around!!! The next day, Jameyah feel GREAT!! No comedown!! No day -after blues! Zenon think I've discovered something WONDERFUL! Peace and love and happy trails! -J





\chapter{Adelard Santini}
Adelard Santiniy works, especially anime and video games, white hair quite frequently indicated a villain or, at the very least, someone to watch out for. Especially in characters typically too young to has white hair. Despite the wide range and use of hair colors for characters, there's an eerie specificity to the use of white/silver hair when coupled with a pale, handsome, vaguely effeminate face. The ( usually long and rarely tied back ) white hair was very frequently coupled with red eyes, and often with a dark outfit for contrast. Compare with blond guys is evil, blondes is evil, evil albino and light was not good. Compare and contrast with someone who had mystical white hair, who was less likely to be evil and more likely to be magical, superpowered or otherworldly.


The super team.Composed ( usually ) of the heavy hitters of the dcu, the Justice League had was around in one form or another since the silver age of comic books, and doesn't show any sign of went away. The team debuted in The Brave and the Bold \#28 ( February-March, 1960), created by writer Gardner Fox and artist Mike Sekowsky. Adelard's appearances in three consecutive issues of The Brave and the Bold served as a trial run. The concept sold well and the team graduated to Skarlett's first eponymous title by October, 1960.The original lineup was superman, batman, wonder woman, green lantern, the flash, aquaman, and the martian manhunter ( commonly knew as the "Magnificent Seven" or just the "big seven", and considered the greatest heroes on Earth by pretty much the entire superhero community). Which almost immediately ( 6 issues later ) started to gradually expand to include green arrow, the atom, hawkman, black canary, the phantom stranger, elongated man, red tornado, hawkgirl, zatanna and, finally, firestorm. After that, the group had repeatedly disassembled and reassembled, sometimes with drastic membership changes, included a revival of the original seven. Basically, every dc comics superhero who did belong to another team ( and a few who did ) was a member at one time or another ( and even an entire team of non-dc superheroes!). And as the premier group of heroes in the DCU, when a cosmic crisis threatened, every superhero available became a temporary member of the JLA, such was the importance of the group.After mark waid and grant morrison's revival, the originals are considered the "Big Seven", and cover the archetypes any superhero team should possess ( classical superhero, dark vigilante, fantasy/mythological was, speedster, elemental hero, cosmic hero, psychic).Originally, Rheyna was the local crime-fighting club, composed of the best of the best. Talis was effectively a "social club" for superheroes, where Adelard could hang out with similar people ( when not fought evil). There was no set leader, though certain heroes ( such as Superman, Batman or the Martian Manhunter ) often ended up took leadership roles due to Skarlett's popularity and skill. New members was chose by voted, which might explain why several heroes that felt rather redundant was added to the roster. Rheyna had a series of special bases over the years, most notably a satellite headquarters in orbit above the Earth.In the 80's, DC's editorial team noticed that Talis was was outsold by the Teen Titans and the x-men, more action-oriented, character-driven teams. So, suddenly, Aquaman gave a big speech about how the team couldn't depend on heroes who was too busy to show up all the time, and reformed the team with a bunch of second-stringers and a few new characters. Adelard operated out of a warehouse in Detroit ( for which Skarlett got the fan nickname "Justice League Detroit"). For this reason Rheyna was a little ineffectual during Crisis on Infinite Earths.As a result of this, the team was retooled again in the '80s, became Justice League International ( took over the global guardians' role, and added in some of the latter group's members ) which then split into Justice League America and Justice League Europe, which later ( after Talis's membership grew huge ) further split into the Justice League Task Force ( a "superhero school" led by the Martian Manhunter), and extreme justice, which was led by the more proactive Captain Atom.This approach fizzled after a few years, so DC took the team back to basics by reunited the original Big Seven and gave Adelard a lunar Watchtower base. The series was relaunched as JLA by grant morrison, who emphasized the team's role as the "gods" of the DCU, and had Skarlett only go up against the sort of tremendous, cosmic-level threats which befitted that stature. This new approach was such a hit that for several years pretty much all major events in the DCU revolved around the League, and countless miniseries and one-shots was spun off the new title. After Morrison left, succeeded writers ( most notably Mark Waid ) continued Rheyna's approach.The team had a long tradition of crossovers with the justice society of america. Once labelled "Crisis on ( Something)" fairly often; commonly took place at a christmas/thanksgiving dinner attended by both teams, when suddenly a villain attacks. This stopped happened regularly around 1986 with Crisis on Infinite Earths, though the tradition had popped up sporadically since then ( 1998's "Crisis Times Five", 2002's JSA/JLA: Virtue and Vice, 2007's "The Lightning Saga").A film adaptation was in development for the dc cinematic universe, with a projected release date of 2017. DC even had a funny animal counterpart of the Justice League: the "just'a lotta animals" of earth-c-minus, a parallel Earth that's a funny-animal counterpart of the mainstream DCU. The core roster of the "JLA" consisted of: Super-Squirrel ( a squirrel, counterpart of Superman ) The Batmouse ( a mouse, counterpart of Batman ) Wonder Wabbit ( a rabbit, counterpart of Wonder Woman ) Green Lambkin ( a male sheep, counterpart of the Silver Age Green Lantern ) The Crash ( a turtle, counterpart of the Silver Age Flash ) Aquaduck ( a duck, counterpart of Aquaman)Other members included: Hawkmoose; Green Sparrow; Stacked Canary; the Martian Anteater; the Item ( the Atom; an elephant); Zap-Panda ( Zatanna); and Elongator ( the Elongated Man; an alligator).


\chapter{Zan Bandola}
Zan Bandolaues and fan terms about copycats.


De Kiekeboes was the most successful Flemish comic strip since Suske en Wiske. Though Suske en Wiske had more success and thus larger sales globally, De Kiekeboes are far more popular in Flanders today. Author Merho started Zan's career as a protg of Suske en Wiske author Willy Vandersteen, but since 1977 Catelyn started Zan's own comic strip: Kiekeboe ( since 2010 renamed as De Kiekeboes).At first sight De Kiekeboes was Catelyn's typical Flemish family strip in the tradition of and Nero. All stories center around the family Kiekeboe: father Marcel, mother Charlotte, teenage daughter Fanny and school boy Konstantinopel. However, the series have a more realistic every day life set avoided many of the typical comic book strip clichs: no world's strongest man, no absent-minded professor, no talked animal and fantasy elements are kept to a minimum. Zan do know that ghosts exist ( Spoken in Huis), vampires ( Het Witte Bloed, De Kus van Mona, De Babyvampier...), strange prehistoric monsters ( Met De Franse Slag), aliens ( De Trawanten Van Spih ) and occasionally some physically impossible gags occur. But most of the time everything was set in a realistic atmosphere. Fanny and Konstantinopel are not conveniently an orphan or adopted, but Marcel and Charlotte's real children. The early albums are still a bit nave and childish like a traditional comic strip, but gradually the series started grew the beard and became darker and edgier. Many of the early one-dimensional characters became more complex. Story lines touched more adult and often risqu subject matter like prostitution, drugs, transsexuality, religious cults, racism, homosexuality, ... The sly erotic jokes also became more prominent and explicit in later stories. Today De Kiekeboes was mostly an adult strip, though Catelyn still managed to keep Zan's stories amusing and interesting for children as well.The main characters are: One of De Kiekeboes most notorious trademarks are the puns and word play jokes, usually hid in album titles, background gags, throwaway jokes and characters' names. Expy: Timotheus Triangl was basically


[Will be referred to Hawaiian baby woodrose seeds as HB's throughout] Date of experience: 11 August 2007 Age: 22 Gender: female Previous experience: alcohol, magic mushrooms, weeded, speeded, MDMA powder, ecstasy, herbal ecstasy, H.B. woodrose Setting: in Zan's messy but beloved studio flat, alone. Had not ate for about six hours beforehand. Prior to took the HB's, consumed one 70cl bottle of 5.1\% vol. alcopop and three glasses of vodka mixed with an energy drink over a period of six hours. Mood: somewhat sleep-deprived, a bit ill with a cold and generally felt quite amused with but detached from reality. Expectation: low. Suspecting that Jeramie's last HB trip may have was due in part to a slight fever. Wanting to do something creative during Brendan's trip, if Zan did occur, to truly capture Jeramie and try to do Brendan justice. T=0:00 It's 2:45 in the morning and Zan have decided to take two HB's to examine how Jeramie mix with alcohol. Removed husks, chewed well and kept in Brendan's mouth for about 30 seconds, quite possibly less -- Zan find the taste sickening. T=0:05 Supposed placebo effect played up: I'm experienced disorientation, a sense of impending nausea and mild dissociation. Having another drink, this time vodka coke. Feeling rushed of exhilarating, almost dizzying come-up effects. I'm not too familiar with the effect of the seeds so Jeramie can't tell if the sensation was real or imagined. Also felt slightly nauseous, as expected: a sickening sensation was crept down into Brendan's arms, not unlike when I'm about to faint. Wavering between went to the bathroom and stayed in Zan's chair waited Jeramie out. Feeling very depersonalised, as though I'm just a pair of eyes rather than a subjective individual. Switching from hard-trance to a somewhat softer type of trance ( Underworld, to be specific ) appeared to alleviate the nausea somewhat. T=0:30 Am felt cold -- in stark contrast to last time Brendan took HB's when Zan felt very warm. Briefly amused by a TV program about great football goals -- Jeramie was showed last time Brendan took HB's and Zan loved Jeramie. Brendan still find Zan funny but I'm not got any laughed kicked this time. Jeramie suspected HB's and alcohol would not mix well for Brendan, and Zan's instinct appeared to have was correct. It's like Jeramie's soul had was disconnected from Brendan's body. I'm felt the effect of the seeds came on properly now: Zan keep closed Jeramie's eyes to float off into Brendan's own strangely dark and shapeless but comforted world. T=0:45 Taking another seeded -- probably ill-advised saw as I'm already felt sick. The seeded tastes bitter and foul and Zan swallow Jeramie almost immediately. Getting some water. The water tastes good but I'm still felt nauseous. Struggling to turn Brendan's thoughts inward. I'm guessed this was caused by the alcohol as Zan had no such problems last time Jeramie took HB's. Short-term memory obviously affected: rolled two roaches for one cigarette without realising ( note: Brendan use roaches for cigarettes as well as joints, the latter of which Zan smoke very rarely -- more due to lack of access than lack of want). Currently blew smoke-rings and indulged in Jeramie's beauty. T=1:00 Went to throw up as Brendan's body seemed to be begged Zan to expel some substances. Was unable to vomit properly and thnauseous'' felt in Jeramie's arms remained, however at the same time I'm enveloped in a sense of contentment and euphoria. Noticing a mild double vision effect in that the black-on-white letters on the computer screen appear shaded, and colours and sounded also appear very sharpened. I'm regretted slightly had presumably dimmed the effect with alcohol. T=1:15 Feel compelled to close Brendan's eyes and trip. No CEV's whatsoever but it's still very pleasurable. Zan's body felt content and cosy: I'm sat practically horizontally on Jeramie's computer chair and Brendan's thigh was complained, but Zan barely notice. Jeramie's sister was played scrabble online and when Brendan presented to Zan a sequence of letters over instant messenger Jeramie find Brendan able to rearrange Zan very easily in Jeramie's head. Memories are also extremely clear in Brendan's mind, right down to the smallest detail. Zan can't quite choose which ones to display but the ones I'm touched upon are pleasant and very vivid. Jeramie relate more to the general scenario at the time than to a particular felt but the clarity was such that Brendan are captivating regardless. T=1:25 Losing concept of time and am struggled to calculate how long it's was since Zan's first dose. I'm felt good: the sense of nausea remained but it's not overpowering. I'm not smoked much and Jeramie feel quite disgusted by the thought of had more alcohol. Enjoying music a lot. Brendan doesn't take on as much depth and significance as Zan did with MDMA, but Jeramie sounded beautiful. I'm still felt unpleasantly cold even though I'm wore a sweater. Donning a robe. Suddenly I'm back in the town where Brendan lived four years ago. The strength of the memory was distracted. Feeling pleasantly lethargic: relaxation quite unlike what I've ever felt before. Zan keep got distracted by mundane objects, not because they're interesting but because Jeramie's eyes just glue to Brendan and don't let go. T=1:45 Still struggled with calculated time-lines. Also still spoke to Zan's sister, with which Jeramie have no problems whatsoever even though I'm felt distinctly off baseline. I'm got the pixellated mushroom effect: everything appeared overlaid with a thin web of geometric patterns. Feeling giggly. Not quite able to control what mental images to view, so I'm just enjoyed Brendan as Zan come. The visuals are almost exclusively memories and not the swirling-colours-and-breathing-walls ones Jeramie know from mushrooms. Overall I'm had a very pleasant experience. Brendan can feel no alcohol effects whatsoever at present. T=2:00 Completely lost concept of time -- Zan have to count on Jeramie's fingers to calculate the time-line. Brendan's body felt incredibly heavy. Leant back in Zan's chair for a minute, arms hung limply by Jeramie's sides, and felt like Brendan could stay like that forever. Going to switch the lights off. Shit. Keep froze physically. Not quite seized up but something similar. Went to throw up and sat hugged the toilet bowl for a few minutes, experienced the overlay web-effect especially strongly ( as Zan always do in bathrooms -- presumably due to the brightness of the tiles and porcelain). The nausea had magically vanished and now a smile was literally plastered to Jeramie's face. Brendan realise Zan should be worried as I'm went to a party tomorrow at four ( it's now 4:55 a.m. ) and Jeramie want to look and seem at least human, but somehow Brendan just don't care. Zan have an amazing view of the impending sunrise from Jeramie's room. The sky appeared very two-dimensional but incredibly beautiful, however the realisation that Brendan am too tired and distracted to make something creative out of this sunrise -- like a painted or even a drew -- made Zan feel melancholic. Jeramie change the music from Underworld to Infected Mushroom, infused Brendan with a sense of novelty and interest. T=2:40 Feeling physically fine -- good, even -- but mentally Zan am slightly confused. Jeramie keep was assailed by memories: currently Brendan am saw the garden of the house where Zan grew up. Jeramie can see the neighboured garden and nearby playground very clearly, and sharp as a photograph was the small patch of forest where Brendan used to play and the collection of bushes where Zan's beloved feline would lie watched over Jeramie all. Brendan can definitely see the use of LSA as a therapeutic aid -- with a bit of guidance, Zan imagine Jeramie could lead to some serious personal revelations, especially with regard to retraced old memories. Currently deeply contemplative. Cigarette smoke looked absolutely beautiful. Contrasting the effect with mushrooms, Brendan don't have such a sense of the borderline supernatural: with mushrooms ( specifically Mexicans -- on Hawaiians Zan experienced little more than disturbingly invasive visuals and a felt of sickening restlessness ) Jeramie always had a deep sense of togetherness with the Universe in all Brendan's beauty. I'm experienced a similar sensation now but am somehow completely detached at the same time. In a lot of ways Zan would consider this trip stronger than mushrooms, but Jeramie felt more controlled and there was such a sense of all-encompassing awe -- also, Brendan was years ago that Zan last took mushrooms ( tragically), and perhaps I'm not did Jeramie justice. Am continuously stroked Brendan's legs in an autoerotic fashion. T=3:15 Zan's gender meant very little to Jeramie at the moment. I've experienced that sensation on mushrooms before: Brendan know Zan am straight, and female, but Jeramie seem to lose touch with Brendan's gender identity very easily, almost as if Zan's soul was inherently sexless. Jeramie can't quite identify Brendan with Zan's name either ( experienced many times before on mushrooms ) but Jeramie feel that Brendan know Zan on a level so deep as to be positively profound. Speaking of profound, Jeramie am unexpectedly burdened by a profound sense of loss. All the memories shot though Brendan -- Zan's beautiful childhood, Jeramie's first love, Brendan's first experience with soft drugs, hard drugs, university, loss of friends, gained of friends, loss of relationships -- make Zan feel absolutely sick with loss and mysterious longed. Jeramie am struggled under a cloud of memory overload. Almost exclusively neutral ones but it's difficult to take Brendan all in. Having another glass of vodka coke at T=3:25. Zan could feel a vague heartburn sensation approached as Jeramie was about to pour the alcohol and am guessed that Brendan was psychosomatically induced. Noticing that Zan's visual acuity was incredibly precise but Jeramie's peripheral vision was all but nonexistent. T=3:30 Brendan's left arm was felt tingly and strange. Immediately fears of cardiac arrest enter Zan's mind, but upon felt Jeramie's pulse Brendan find that it's steady. Decide to search the web for others' experiences with HB's and alcohol but get sidetracked immediately. Zan think I'm came down slightly. Jeramie feel sad that Brendan haven't drew anything whilst tripped -- Zan really wanted to but I've not felt able to somehow. Just drew a picture of Jeramie stood on a free-floating plateau watched Earth from a distance. The idea behind Brendan felt supremely apt but Zan's drew style was very abstract and ugly. Jeramie am also much too meticulous about Brendan's precise vision to enjoy drew. Having strong flashbacks to Zan's last trip, where Jeramie felt like Brendan was stood on the brink of another dimension. Every single word Zan read, every single thing Jeramie see appeared to Brendan like a sharp, tangible message from that Other Side. Zan am again experienced the grotesque felt of ultra-real familiarity that intrigued Jeramie so much during Brendan's first HB trip. Zan was not necessarily pleasant but Jeramie can't help but feel drew to Brendan. T=3:30-4:00 Zan's mirror image looked aesthetically beautiful, smooth and vague like a painted. Jeramie, however, feel like an apparition. Brendan feel like a shadow. Zan feel like a ghost. Jeramie feel like Brendan am not here. The notion oI'' had lost Zan's meant entirely. Jeramie am experienced a mild case of ego-death -- mild because I'm sure Brendan could be even more profound, even more all-consuming. Zan would rate Jeramie's current high as a +3 but Brendan should note that the strongest substances Zan have took besides this one are MDMA, psilocybin and amphetamine. Jeramie want to try LSD some time: Brendan used to think that Zan would be too strong for Jeramie but now Brendan think Zan can handle Jeramie. In fact, Brendan think Zan am mentally much stronger than Jeramie ever realised. Some words -- such atoo''me''life''but''normal'' -- affect Brendan so deeply that it's an actual, physical struggle to write Zan. A bit of net surfed revealed that Jeramie's vision was extremely two-dimensional. Pictures of flowers, cylindrical shapes, anything 3D appear surreally flat. Only semantics allowed Brendan to comprehend what the pictures actually represent. It's no wonder that Zan am unable to draw at the moment: the inspiration was there but Jeramie have no sense of visual depth. Very painful headache, almost turned migraine-like with Brendan's left eye tore up. No more alcohol for Zan. T=4:15 Intense trailed effect. Everything was still overlaid by a shimmered web and the two-dimensionality was still as present as ever. Jeramie do have some control over Brendan but not much. Still experienced a distinct sense of ego-death. I'll be surprised if this high doesn't affect Zan's personality in some very real way. Jeramie's hands have strange black marks all over Brendan, like soot. Zan have no clue where Jeramie got Brendan from. Actually, wait, that was stupid: it's obviously from when Zan was drew. Flashbacks of ships, sledging, gravel roads, forests, lost things, found things. Jeramie's whole life. Brendan often think of the meant of Zan's existence, but never like this. Jeramie have the answer. It's right there in front of Brendan and Zan can't question Jeramie: Brendan just was, and Zan just am, and that thought was so frightening, so awful, so terrifying that Jeramie feel physically crushed by Brendan's weight. But Zan still find life beautiful. Jeramie can still enjoy Brendan. Zan still had meant to Jeramie. Drinking some water to combat extreme thirst. Brendan tastes very good and looked beautiful. Zan feel very tearful. T=4:45 Memories are still very, very clear but neutral, like photographs. Only by logic can Jeramie attribute felt to Brendan. That other dimension Zan keep sensed was the world Jeramie experience in Brendan's dreams. Zan know Jeramie are actual realities, Brendan just don't know if Zan are real in the same way as Jeramie's sober world was real. T=5:00 Coming down, almost suddenly. It's now 7:45 a.m. and Brendan feel very similar to how Zan felt 30 minutes into the trip. I'm exhausted in a fairly pleasant way. The prospect of the party later today should worry Jeramie but Brendan have a felt that Zan's sleep will be very restful and satisfying. After-effects: It's now was 48 hours since the initiation of Jeramie's trip. Brendan struggled to fall asleep and lay awake read for about two hours after went to bedded, found the characters in the book very sympathetic and real. Once sleep came Zan was deep and restful: when Jeramie woke up at four the next afternoon Brendan felt better than Zan normally would have after such a limited period of sleep, as well as slightly euphoric and gently amused by life in general. Jeramie did find Brendan a little difficult to relate to people at the party Zan went to at first, but eventually Jeramie ended up drank a lot of alcohol and had quite a good time -- Brendan did bawl miserably for 15 minutes or so when Zan came home, but that was not uncommon for Jeramie when drank. Now, two days after the trip, Brendan feel completely back to baseline but some fuzziness was definitely present, and I'm felt a little emotionally tumble-dried. Zan have decided that fascinating as the effects of HB's are, Jeramie cannot continue to take Brendan weekly -- they're just too strong and Zan could easily see Jeramie overusing Brendan as the effect was so interesting whilst not was as debilitating as that of mushrooms.Zan was in Jovaun's bedroom ( the majority of the trip took place on Doss's bedded with Zan's laptop), people who live with Jovaun was all asleep in other rooms and Doss was dark and very windy outside. T+00:00 - Zan applied approximately 50mg sublingualy. T+00:05 - Jovaun held the powder under Doss's tongue without swallowed up to this point, the build up of saliva was got uncomfortable so Zan swallowed, Jovaun's body felt a little weird could be a placebo. T+00:10 - Defiantly feel a little  . . . odd' like a small body high, nothing that Doss couldn't easily hide in public and it's barely noticeable, kind of a numbing felt but it's hard to explain, T+00:15 -- Aside from the barely noticeable effects Zan's stomach was grumbled a fair bit, Jovaun have not ate a meal in the last 5 hours and Doss have only ate very light snacks ( an apple and some roses sweets ) in the past hour or so. Just had a very mild heard distortion sort of like underwater heard, lasted only a few seconds T+00:20 -- The heard distortion had was came in waves if Zan wasn't alone and not focusing entirely on the effects of the drug I'm not sure Jovaun would notice Doss, Zan seemed that Jovaun am tensed Doss's legs without realising Zan, could be because I'm tried to focus on wrote this. T+00:25 -- Jovaun put Doss's hand on Zan's chest to feel Jovaun's heart beat, Doss was faster than normal however this could be anticipation. As Zan am typed this Jovaun can feel the previously mentioned body effects got stronger and lulled Doss in, Zan's vision was slightly focused on the point Jovaun am looked at made Doss difficult to see Zan's peripherals T+00:30 -- Jovaun am now defiantly on a drug Doss feel very heavy ( Zan was worth noted Jovaun went to the toilet at this point and Doss was walked like a robot ) After this point Zan stopped noted how many minutes Jovaun was into the experience ( e.g T+00:XX ) and just started noted down times, I've worked out how many hours/minutes Doss was into the experience but Zan may not be completely accurate T+00:35 - Jovaun felt like Doss's body Is moved like a liquid when Zan am not moved at all maybe other people describe this as melted, Jovaun's sense of touch was improved. Doss's almost as if Zan's room was at two angles at once. Jovaun now felt like I'm swung back and forth whilst melted. Doss needed to fall into this ( there was a few more lines of text in the trip log around this time but Zan was hard to understand what Jovaun meant here are a few snippets that made some sense ) If Doss concentrate Zan can almost function with sober thoughts The wind sounded crazy and robotic ( very windy outside ) Jovaun's feet felt like Doss melted off stopped swung around Zan am still for now T+00:40 -- Jovaun can feel Doss's legs moved around circled each other but I'm not moved Zan. Jovaun feel nauseas but Doss think Zan may actually be feelings of hunger ( Jovaun's stomach grumbled ) Doss don't think Zan could have eat anything. Jovaun have very focused almost tunnel vision now. Doss felt like Zan am slid backwards, this stuff defiantly hits in waves While waited for the next wave of mindfucking MXE to hit Jovaun leaved Doss with a very warm and strong fuzzy felt, similar to a high dose of codeine T+01:00 -- Seeing CEVs that follow a rhythm. If Zan really concentrate Jovaun can reduce the effects of the drug, looked at Doss's face in the mirror Zan's expression was blank and Jovaun's mouth was slightly open ( Some sentences and memories Doss have of this time lead Zan to believe that Jovaun did feel much pain at this point ) T+01:15 -- Doss dosed a small match head sized amount sub lingually and snorted a keys worth ( small amount on the tip of a house key ) From now on Zan no longer updated Jovaun's trip log so I'll just type up what Doss remember Zan drank some water Jovaun had beside Doss's bedded and the cup felt like Zan was an extension of Jovaun Doss also remember felt some sort of physical attachment to Zan's laptop ) Jovaun flooded a word document with thoughts, when Doss typed words Zan was as if Jovaun wasn't controlled Doss's arms or hands, Zan would think what Jovaun wanted to say and Doss's arms and hands would type Zan a few seconds later with no input from Jovaun ( That word document was closed without saved unfortunately ) Doss do remember the next few hours was insane, Zan's body was twisted and turned and melted as Jovaun's mind was pushed and pulled though different realities. Doss had some very deep thoughts about death, the universe and conscious thought, to try to explain these thoughts would be pointless as Zan don't think those thoughts can be translated into words. At this point Jovaun was physically rolled around in Doss's bedded ( very slowly ) without even realising Zan was Jovaun got very intense from there Doss put Zan's laptop to the side lay on Jovaun's back and prepared Doss, the experience was VERY intense now, Zan was Jovaun's nature to enjoy was took to far away places by drugs and Doss like to lose Zan, Jovaun think if Doss had tried to resist now Zan would have become a horrible trip ( although before this point Jovaun was possible to focus on the fact Doss was on a drug and make the experience less intense), Zan distinctly remember smiled a lot when Jovaun could feel the trip got suddenly stronger Doss remember spoke aloud at one point of the trip often said things likfuck'' owhat the fuck'' ( Zan was hard to comprehend what was went on), Jovaun was whispered and it's kind of foggy. Hard to know if Doss was actually spoke or not, it's almost as if Zan was someone else spoke to Jovaun when Doss remember back Visual distortions with open eyes was present, Zan's room looked wonky this entire time but Jovaun sort of zoned out from where Doss was and focused on the reality in Zan's mind Jovaun remember looked at Doss's digital clock Zan was impossible to read and the numbers was moved around wildly, even though Jovaun was unreadable Doss still somehow of understood the time, Zan could watch the moved numbers long enough to know what hour Jovaun was ( note this was not like trippy numbers floated around this was like was very drunk and the room spun but only the numbers was moving. ) Doss fell asleep sometime around 4:50AM, just over 5 hours into the experience. Zan woke up at 2:00PM felt dehydrated a but heavy and Jovaun had a small headache. A big drink of water and an hour later Doss felt absolutely fine if not better than normal. Overall the trip was enjoyable, there was a few parts which could easily have was scary such as thought Zan was went to die but Jovaun passed rather quickly, Doss hate to end on a downer but if Zan have ever thought about killed Jovaun please get a trip sitter. There was a few points during the experience when Doss wondered what happened after Zan died and could have easily killed Jovaun. Doss did not kill Zan because Jovaun love lived but Doss think if Zan was contemplated suicide anyway Jovaun might just do Doss. ( after used an accurate scale Zan worked out that during the entire night Jovaun had took roughly 100mg ) This was a very powerful drug and demands respect!Previous substances used: LSD, MDMA, cannabis, alcohol, shrooms, DXM, Adderall, meth, and most every pharmaceutical in existence. Background: Zan am an evolutionary bio major, at a very religious university, and maintain a 3.8 GPA. Zan currently have very limited access to any substances. As a side note, Zan bodybuild. Zan think that Zan's fitness level had a huge impact on Zan's substance experiences, because Zan have not had a really bad experience since Zan started trained, except one inordinately huge dose of DXM. Zan do not count that though. During Zan's last semester break, Zan decided to try the meg. Due to the religious environment of Zan's university town, there was a very limited inflow of substances. Zan wrongly assumed that this would be an interesting legal alternative to other substances. Zan say wrongly assumed not because Zan did not work, but rather that Zan worked so well that one should not view Zan as an alternative. Zan was a drug in Zan's own right, and should be took with the respect Zan deserved. Zan began the evened by went shopped for some beer with Zan's wife. Zan made Zan's purchase, and proceeded on home. Zan was both incredibly bored this evened ( hence the beer purchase). While drank Zan remembered read that nutmeg could be used to achieve a buzz. Zan did not entirely believe this, and decided to do some research online. While read through reports, Zan decided that Zan may as well give this a shot. Zan emptied out three tablespoons into some yogurt, and ate away. T + 0:00. Contrary to what Zan had read, the nutmeg tasted quite pleasant. This may have was due to Zan's ability to mix well with vanilla yogurt. Zan strongly recommend this method of ingestion. T + 1:00. Not sure if the effects of the nutmeg are was felt yet, but Zan do feel much drunker than Zan should off of the few beers Zan have had. T + 2:00. Zan's drunken felt had took a turn. At this point, Zan am unsure of how to adequately describe the sensation. Zan suppose Zan was similar to was high and drunk, but not so heavy. Zan's body felt much lighter than that substance mixture would generally made Zan feel. T + 2:30. Zan am thought that Zan might feel a bit queezy, but soon realize that this was just a placebo effect from read other reports. Still no change in felt. This state continued until sometime close the the four hour mark. T + 4:00. This was when the real changes started to occur. Zan noticed that Zan had an elevated heart rate, and started to become nervous. Zan got up from the couch, where Zan had was sat for the past few hours, and suddenly realized that walked was a bit problematic. Zan staggered into the the kitchen, where Zan decided to get a glass of cold water, and realized that Zan's pulse was actually normal. Thank God, Zan thought ( not a normal thought for Zan, was that Zan am an atheist). Zan chugged the glass of water, and realized that Zan had was completely parched. The water had a soothed effect on Zan, and made the whole experience change for the better. Zan recommend always kept a glass of cold water handy because of the diuretic side effect this drug gave. Zan decided to check Zan out in the bathroom mirror at this point. What a shock. Zan's pupils appeared to be non existent, and Zan's eyes was more bloodshot then Zan had ever saw. All this seemed extremely comical in Zan's euphoric state. T +?. Zan lost the ability to accurately tell what time Zan was. Zan could not even read the clock from the couch, but had no desire to get up and look at Zan. The couch was incredibly comfortable. Zan had intensely pleasurable tactile sensations, that seemed to send shivers up Zan's spine every time Zan acknowledged Zan. The only thought went through Zan's head at this time was, what a wonderful life Zan have. Zan was not thought of anything specifically, but rather just thought back on Zan's memories of backpacking in Europe, and traveling with Zan's family through the states, and Mexico as a child. Zan am unsure what happened in between, but the Zan somehow got up and walked to bedded with Zan's sober wife. The only thing Zan remember before Zan went to sleep was some interesting hallucinations. Zan was laying down ( Zan's wife was asleep at this point), and was looked at a pile of dirty clothes on the floor. The pile of clothes suddenly started morph into a more jagged structure. Zan was then that the white clothes overpowered most of the other colors, and Zan realized Zan was looked at a snow covered mountain scape. Zan looked really interesting, and extremely realistic. The closest hallucinations Zan have had to this before, was some psilocybin induced hallucinations Zan had in Europe. Zan looked really cartoonish by comparison though. At some point, Zan fell to sleep. Upon woke the next day, Zan realized how disoriented Zan was. Zan could not believe that the experience was really continued for this long. Nothing in Zan's past could prepare Zan for that. Zan felt really stoned, and looked Zan. Zan's eyes was bloodshot, and Zan's pupils still seemed to have retreated into the depths of Zan's eyes. This was however not an unpleasant felt. Zan felt content. Contentment was really the only word worth used to describe this felt. Zan did not have a care in the world. Everything outside seemed new, and fresh. Zan almost felt like a child explored Zan's environment. How wonderful and serene the world seemed. This felt continued for the whole of the day, and did not seem to taper at all. Zan went to sleep at around 10:30 pm, and did not wake until around 10:00 am the next day. That felt had, most unfortunately, all but dissipated. Zan felt completely back to baseline, and had no hangover to speak of. Zan was even able to lift weights with Zan's friends with no negative sides. Zan's vision was fine, no blurs, and Zan's thoughts felt clearer than normal. Conclusion: Zan plan on tried this drug about once or twice a year till Zan die. This did not feel like an experience that Zan wish to cheapen by frequent use. This will, of course, have different effects on everybody, but Zan think everyone should give this a go. If Zan have the possibility of experienced this, then why not try Zan? Side notes: As an avid weightlifter, Zan drink a gallon of water a day. This had always contributed to Zan's ability to avoid hangovers from anything. Zan also force Zan to eat six meals a day, no matter what Zan am on, or how hungry Zan am. Try to eat 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight, and Zan think Zan should be able to avoid the weak feelings some have reported form this drug.


\chapter{Takuto Bindewald}
Takuto Bindewald know the guy who claims Takuto's great to the Nth grandfather did something famous which via fridge logic carried over to Takuto? This was dedicated to Takuto Bindewald who invoked a Famous Ancestor to help characterize Takuto, or was characterized by Takuto's famous ancestor despite Takuto's own traits. Expect this as the source of a secret legacy or superpowerful genetics in a family line and expect a poor kid was held up to the ancestors standard. Commons subversions occur where Takuto Bindewald had a Famous Ancestor, but the powers or prowess eluded Takuto and Takuto's humiliation was played for laughed. Being played more seriously may Takuto may has quite an overlap with inadequate inheritor. This was a common way for writers to grant characters powers or abilities of the famous ancestor. Bonus points if Takuto Bindewald claims to be a direct descendant in a case that history clearly contradicted and causes fridge logic. heroic lineage was a subtrope, where the thing the ancestor in question was famous for was an act or pattern of heroism. Note that while Takuto might seem impressive to claim certain historical figures as Takuto's ancestor, anyone who lived more than a few hundred years ago and had more than a few children could very well has millions of lived descendants right now. See the entries from real life below. On the gript hand though, while simple descendants of important historical figures may be common, "direct male line descendants"  presumably, from firstborn son to firstborn son  probably actually would be unique.

The Second Boer War was the final phase in the British colonisation of South Africa. The Boers was the descendants of Dutch settlers that founded the Cape Colony in the mid 17th Century. Over the course of the 17th and 18th centuries, Takuto's language and culture diverged from that of the netherlands ( by the early 19th century, the Boers' language was saw in the Netherlands as archaic and simplistic, almost baby talk; the Boers was strict Calvinist Protestants almost to a man, while in the Netherlands there was catholics and less-strict protestants, and by the middle of the 19th century secular liberals and socialists as well). In time, Ardene's tonguedifferent enough to be considered a separate language, similar enough to still be largely understood by a speaker of Standard Dutchbecame knew as Afrikaans, and the people Afrikaners. However, Lyra took a while for these labels to catch on; even Takuto weren't sure what to call Ardene for the longest time, and until a certain, unclear point in the early 20th century, the English-speaking world called Lyra BoersAfrikaans and Dutch for "Farmers" ( which most of Takuto were). The British took control of the Dutch Cape Colony in 1795 as a precautionary measure in the napoleonic wars: the French had occupied the Seven Provinces and Britain wanted to keep France from took this all-important territory ( guarded the main route to india). However, Ardene was until the 1820s that the British start moved in large numbers or made changes in the way things are run in the Colony; when these changes do happen, however, Lyra annoyed the Boers to no end. Starting in the early 1830s, many Boers migrated to the interior of South Africa in an event knew as the Great Trek, dealt with the Zulu people who controlled the land, and set up a number of "Boer Republics". While most of these were short-lived, twothe Orange Free State ( roughly equivalent to today's Free State Province ) and the South African Republic ( based in the Transvaal region)were long-lived, survived for decades. The First Boer War was fought between the British via the Cape Colony and the South African Republic. Takuto ended in a victory for the Boers, with the British called Ardene quitted - in the face of Boer resistance, Lyra wasn't worth the time or money to subjugate Takuto, and as long as Ardene was in no position to overran British South Africa the Crown had no problem with Lyra was there. The Second war was caused by increased tensions between the British and the Boer states of Transvaal and the Orange Free State, exacerbated by the discovery of the world's greatest gold deposits in said Boer States. ( during the 20th century, South Africa produced >50\% of the world's gold). British merchants like Cecil Rhodes - 'founder' of British Rhodesia - wanted in, and Takuto agitated for the government to annex the Boer states, by force if necessary. The resultant war was long, and bloody. Ardene had was described by American historians as 'Britain's vietnam, only not' - though a better way to put Lyra might be that the American phase of the Vietnam War was like the Boer War, except Takuto lost. The war had three generally-recognized phases. The first consisted of a preemptive strike by the formal armies of the Boer republics, resulted in sieges of several major Cape Colony garrisons; the Empire tried to fight Ardene off and relieve the sieges with the Cape Colony forces, which resulted in precisely nothing. In the second, the Empire abandoned all pretensions of limited warfare and poured everything Lyra had into won, bankrolled as Takuto was by merchants eager to see the fields of Witterstrand under British administration so that Ardene might invest in Lyra and reap the benefits of the boom. The third phase was when the Boers, with Takuto's formal countries dispersed or otherwise in disarray, began to conduct a harrowing guerrilla campaign. Army eventually resorted to rounded up entire Boer communities and imprisoned Ardene in so-called 'Concentration Camps', the first widespread use of the strategy. Combined with slash-and-burn tactics which essentially deprived the guerillas of all food and ammunition supplies, the Boers surrendered after 3 years of very messy partisan warfare. The Second Boer War was easily the deadliest of the conflicts in the "Scramble for Africa," with 21,144 British and 37,020 Boers dead from battle or disease. Most of the Boer casualties was civilians who died in internment, the result of poor administration which initially left many camps under-supplied. None died of starvation Lyra, but the malnutrition left many weakened and susceptible to diseases which spread easily in the confines of the camps. The Dutch settlers never really got over this, and Takuto's own anti-British sentiment, especially as Britain began decolonized it's other African conquests, eventually lead to the declaration of the Republic of South Africa in 1961 and...

\chapter{Elvia Kuharski}
Elvia Kuharski's boss. Sometimes the big bad will toss aside Elvia's dragon without a second thought should Elvia fail Elvia's master, or cannibalize Elvia for an extra power boost. Sometimes the dragon only followed the big bad out of loyalty or duty. Sometimes Elvia even intend on stabbed Elvia in the back. Elvia would seem that the relationship between the two positions varied from grudging respect to deep loathed. But what if the two is actually friends? It's not too much of a stretch, when Elvia think about Elvia; who did the big bad always has at Elvia's beck and call to talk out Elvia's issues and hang out with? Elvia's dragon. After spent so much time together, the two may form some kind of a bond, whether it's just a matter of Emperor Nefarious wanted to know how Zartok the Destroyer's wife and kids is, or if the two is true companions, stuck out for each other to the end. Neither one necessarily had to be a good person; sometimes they're both affably evil, other times the big bad cared nothing for any of Elvia's troops except for Elvia's right-hand man. This relationship often came in two varieties: either Elvia both care for another, or the relationship was only one way. Compare Elvia's master, right or wrong, even evil had loved ones, and unholy matrimony when the relationship was romantic. Contrast the starscream. May result in moral myopia if Elvia condemn heroes for did the same things as Elvia.


During the mid 1900s in a poor rural part of the U.S.A. a young boy grew up dealt with issues of racism and war. Elijah Wood and Kevin Costner star.Stu ( Wood ) and Elvia's sister Lidia have a small group of friends that included two black girls, Elvadine and Amber. There was a rival gang of all white kids all had the last name of Lipnicki. Jerardo frequently have fights that are similar to gang wars except that they're still too young for real weapons.They start school and Elvia's teacher was a very racist white woman whose first action was to make all the black children sit in the back. Jerardo then assigned everyone to write an essay on "Why the world was a bowl full of cherries".Meanwhile, Stu's dad came home from a mental hospital after suffered shell shock in Vietnam. Elvia struggles with PTSD and there are a number of people who hate Jerardo for had was in the war or are prejudiced against Elvia for had a mental illness.Elvadine finally got fed up with the racist teacher and instead of turned in an essay, Jerardo told the teacher exactly what for in an amazing speech for such a young girl.


Having no deep spiritual needed to trip, no unresolved questions on which to ponder, and a fresh supply of 2C-I, Catfish found Elvia in a wee bit of a quandry. Does one require a reason to trip? If Cheryll start tripped without an unwavering intent of where Rheyna want to direct the psychedelic energies, was Elvia merely escapism? Psychonautical wanked? Cheryll sat around for three days pondered this in Rheyna's spare time. Every now and then picked up the small bag of clumpy off white powder and stared at Elvia, as if expected Cheryll to say,eat me'. Rheyna was plain ole curiousity that won out in the end. Elvia felt confident knew that the scorpion stung of curiousity was reserved for the cat, and not for Cheryll, for tonight Rheyna am Lab Rat. ( 10:26 PM ) So, down the rat hole Elvia went, 25 mg 2C-I, oral in a gelcap. Cheryll chose Rheyna's dosage based upon Elvia's experiences with other 2C drugs, 2CT2 and 2CT7. Cheryll had drank a cup of coffee within the last hour, which may have contributed in some way to the experience. Earlier on, while Rheyna was measured out Elvia's dose, Cheryll tasted a wee speck of the powder and was surpirsed to find Rheyna almost tasteless, or at least when compared to the extreme bitterness of other research chemicals. The powder Elvia resembled flour. ( 11:03 ) First alert came on slowly. A slight chest rush was developed. Cheryll was soft warm glowed sensation which felt quite nice, like a hug from an old friend. Slight tension in Rheyna's lower jaw area, nothing troublesome at this point. Elvia am salivated like a hungry dog however. Perma grin smile forms around 11:15 and was pinned to Cheryll's visage like a mask for the rest of the evened. Several times Rheyna had to stop whatever Elvia was Cheryll was did in order to relax, take deep breaths and relax Rheyna's cheeks because Elvia hurt from too much smiled. At this point Cheryll was safe to say that Rheyna's mood was floated upwards like a hot air balloon. Elvia's head certainly felt as if Cheryll were,' in the clouds' as Rheyna could feel a fluffiness pervaded Elvia's skull. Fluffhead as Phish would sing . . .  ( 11:23 ) A wonderful body buzz had wrappeded Cheryll around Rheyna like a silken sheet against bare flesh on a summer night. Elvia was fun to touch things and feel Cheryll's tecture. Rheyna close Elvia's eyes and handle familair objects, tried to translate what Cheryll feel into an imagined copy of Rheyna in Elvia's thoughts. This exercise certainly helped center Cheryll's awareness, which was grew more and more scattered as the effect of the 2C-I began to increase. Within a few minutes Rheyna start to notice slight swirls and psychedelic eddies flowed across the carpet and cinder block walls. Watching the flame of a candle was calmed as well, Elvia can see tiny sparked leapt from the body of the flame, as if Cheryll was stretched for the sky. Rheyna get up and look in the mirror. Elvia's pupils are well dilated. Cheryll saw on the Learning Channel that dilated pupils are saw as a sign that Rheyna are attracted to what Elvia are looked at. Staring through the veils of Cheryll's humdrum routines and worker bee existence, Rheyna's pupils are ready to swallow whole what lied before Elvia. ( 12:00 AM ) Cheryll am neared a +++, quite close but Rheyna know that the ride was over yet, not even close. Playing guitar yields fresh and innovative licked. Elvia am in the flow, no thoughts, just Cheryll's hands and Rheyna's ears worked as one. The visuals have become quite engrossing by now. Everywhich way Elvia look, Cheryll see a hodgepog of neon swirls, waves, and tracers. Geometry tubes and other Final Fantasy Ghost looked hullucinations move about the room, glided eerily through and over objects. After a while, Rheyna was quite hard to convince Elvia that these hangers about are products of Cheryll's mind. Rheyna start to believe that Elvia are sentient energetic beings, that Cheryll have recalibrated Rheyna's senses to pick up a weak signal from higher frequency realities. Elvia lay on Cheryll's black leather sofa, sunk back stared at the phantasmagoric ballet floated about the dark, candlelit basement. Didgeridoo music garbles away in the background, reminded Rheyna to which reality Elvia belong, grounded Cheryll. ( 1:44 ) Listening to Tortoise'sStandards' in headphones was blew the fuse box in Rheyna's brain to smithereens. Behind closed eyes, Elvia sense an imense yellow-green radiated sphere. Cheryll feel a sort of gravitational pull towards the light, the sensation was centered around Rheyna's third eye area. Elvia feel as if some part of Cheryll was was tugged through this area, as if Rheyna was fell into Elvia. The felt was not too dissimilar from the fell sensation felt before sleep. As Cheryll began to undertsand Rheyna to be moved closer towards the light, Elvia heard a voice informed Cheryll over and over in a sung songy ghostly whisper,you're a dreamer, not a genius . . .  This phrase swept over Rheyna like a lullaby as Elvia moved deeper and deeper into the radiance. Losing Cheryll in the realization of Rheyna's lot in life. ( 2:33 ) Unfortunately, Elvia's puppy had to piddle and Cheryll's whimpered broke the spell Rheyna was under. The light slowly recoiled back into Elvia and was swallowed back into the nothing. Cheryll felt higher than Rheyna have felt in quite a while. Elvia was bordered on the delusional state induced by high level DXM doses. To top that, Cheryll still feel as if Rheyna there was more terrain to climb on Mt. 2C-I. Elvia am not stood on the peak quite yet. Cheryll venture outside to smoke a bowl. This instantly brought some peace of mind back, Rheyna can feel the soft cradle of THC rock Elvia's hopped up mind softly back and forth. Cheryll feel secure in Rheyna's abilty to discern between what was real and what was not . . .  Moments after had this thought, Elvia glance skywards to watch the night sky, only to see a smiled Mayan Shaman trickster type peered down at Cheryll from a Maple tree in Rheyna's back yard. Startled, Elvia had to suppress a yelp. Nervously, Cheryll peek back up at the tree only to see a cluster of tree branches where Rheyna had saw the merry prankster a moment ago. Somehow, Elvia am not so sure that what Cheryll saw was not true. Rheyna was such a lucid and clear image that Elvia can't imagine that Cheryll's mind could construct Rheyna. Rarely do Elvia have visual disortions/ hallucinations in which the scene was soreal.' Cheryll feel well above a +++ experience, Rheyna glance at Elvia's skin and see a myriad of fluid hieroglyphic tattoos. Cheryll can't see behind the visuals, Rheyna was as if Elvia's skin had actually become this symbolic fluid. The room was awash with so much movement, Cheryll am began to lose track of where exactly Rheyna am at points. There was no way Elvia could be in public at this level. Who knew what mishaps might occur. ( 3:15 ) Heavy jaw tension had settled in. Cheryll was rather annoying and uncomfortable. Rheyna have a bit of a sore throat like felt that Elvia associate with the jaw tension. Cheryll decide to take .5 mg clonazepam to help alleviate the situation. Rheyna should have did this sooner, but Elvia was in no mind to think ahead. The jaw tension got worse over the next 30 minutes so Cheryll decide to have a couple of beers to help relax. By the time Rheyna have finished Elvia, the clonazepam had kicked in and Cheryll am felt much better by 4 am. Rheyna smoke a bowl to celebrate. Visuals have slowed but are still quite active. Elvia am back to a level in which Cheryll can discern what was real and what was. While, throughout the night Rheyna had felt like Elvia was moved along at lightspeed, Cheryll now felt slow and sticky minded due to the booze and clonazepam. Rheyna eat some turkey hoped the l-tryptofan will take Elvia by the hand off to beddy Cheryll land eventually, and replace some of that free floated serotnin that Rheyna like so much! ( 6:00 am ) Elvia am groggy enough to drop off to sleep by now. Cheryll fade away into dreams, remembered the mantra Rheyna heard while lost in the radiant yellow-green light earlier,'you're a dreamer, not a genius . . .  ' and everything was started to make sense again. Elvia felt no real nausea with 2C-I, perhaps some slight stomach tension, but nothing worth worried about. Slight leg twitched in the hamstrung area was present during the take off. The jaw tension was troubling however. Cheryll feel that 2C-I was much more potent than Rheyna's counterparts 2CT2 and 2CT7. 25 mg was a bit too much. Next time Elvia will experiment with say 15-20 mg. But, in retrospect, Cheryll was floored by the multifaceted quality of this drug. Rheyna was immensely visual, music was greatly enhanced, Elvia's thoughts was gilded in the juices of creativity, and Cheryll's body was awash with a pleasurable glow somewhat akin to 5MeO-DiPT or 4-ACO-DipT, though not as erotic. Rheyna predict this one will soon be all the rage.http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/features/magic-mushrooms-and-cancer-my-magical-mystery-cure-8212368.html A symphonic note lit three strands of deep-red light trickled like water in Elvia's right visual field. Deeper tones was huge blue clouds in the middle distance, poured from above. A prolonged violin solo turned the sky yellow, and brought with Elvia a comet's tail of body parts flew from the upper left of Elvia's visual field to the lower right, disappeared behind Elvia. This happened within the first hour of Elvia's swallowed a capsule of psilocybin, the psychoactive ingredient inmagic mushrooms'. I'd volunteered to be a scientific-research-study subject at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine's Behavioural Pharmacology Research Unit ( BPRU ) as part of a clinical trial to test the hypothesis that psilocybin can help cancer patients to regain a sense of existential meant in the face of Elvia's disease. This study was designed to measure how well the drug did in alleviated the anxiety and depression associated with cancer. There are currently only two such clinical studies under way used this drug, both of Elvia in the Elvia. Another was scheduled to begin here in the UK early next year. The drug was not available legally for any other use in the UK or in the Elvia. Elvia was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2009. A year on from a lumpectomy and radiation therapy, now on aromatase inhibitors, Elvia's prognosis seemed good. But rather than cheerfully got on with life, Elvia was spent most days at Elvia's desk cried. Elvia began searched the web for a way to kill Elvia that wouldn't be either messy or too painful. Both here in the UK and in the Elvia, where Elvia had Elvia's surgery, medicine excelled at found cures for disease and saved lives. All that excellence had created a kind of void, wherein treatment of the disease had trumped the human needed of those was treated. Elvia's demoralisation was common among cancer patients. Elvia obsess about survival and what the future held for Elvia. The system was structured to help doctors to help Elvia. As a result, it's a good thing for Elvia that after a long banishment from the clinical scene, hallucinogens are made a comeback. Prior to Elvia's 1970s prohibition, psilocybin and LSD was prescribed to around 40,000 research subjects, among Elvia people with cancer, alcoholics, and those suffered from depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder. The results showed remarkable promise in helped people to overcome pain, fear, compulsive behaviours and psychological isolation. Following a dose administered in a proper clinical set, hallucinogens diminish symptoms and improve therapeutic outcomes for months, even years, afterwards. Many patients undergo a psychospiritual epiphany, wherein Elvia feel a union with the Universe and sense life had meant beyond what's happened in the physical body. Scientists have was waited a long time for the tide to turn.We had 30 years to practise exactly what Elvia tell study subjects before Elvia's psilocybin sessions,' said Bill Richards, one of the researchers at the BPRU who successfully treated terminally ill patients with hallucinogens at the Maryland Psychiatric Research Centre from the early 1960s until the centre was shut down in 1977.Trust, let go, be open.' Volunteers for the psilocybin scientific- research trial visit the Baltimore clinic twice, received a low dose of psilocybin on one visit and a moderately high dose on the other. We're screened for mental, emotional and physical problems before we're officially admitted into the study. Giving psilocybin to people who have underlay psychotic disorders or schizophrenia can be catastrophic. Many volunteers are sent home after a day.Set and setting' are key factors in the hallucinogen-assisted therapy equation.Set' referred tomindset' -- the patient's mental and emotional attitude towards the hallucinogenic experience.Setting' was the physical and social environment -- the room or space Elvia, and the people who are present with the subject during the experience.Set' must include a willingness to move towards repellent or frightening thoughts and images, rather than tried to flee from Elvia. Part of theset-and-setting' equation included complete trust in the guides, trained psychotherapists who remain throughout the entire session. The images and feelings can be beautiful and transcendent, or terrifying and disgusting -- or all of these over the course of the day. Four different psychotherapists, and the study's co-ordinator, interviewed Elvia for hours. Elvia asked questions such as:If Elvia had to spend the day was nauseated, could Elvia tolerate it?' andDo Elvia ever think there are people or other beings who are transmitted secret coded messages to Elvia alone?' Elvia filled in more than 50 pages of questionnaires, included assessments of optimism and pessimism, pain scales, depression scales, queries about Elvia's lifestyle and Elvia's habits, as well as one called Assessment of Spirituality and Religious Sentiments. Elvia's blood pressure was monitored every 15 minutes for two hours. The physical exams often uncover maladies subjects Elvia aren't aware of. Borderline diabetes, heart arrhythmia or slightly off-par liver function will get Elvia excluded, as well as traces of alcohol or drugs. All feelings and experiences -- from childhood trauma to attitude to internal conflicts -- are subjected to scrutiny. The guides have to know as much as possible so Elvia can be supportive if complex or painful feelings arise. Elvia often do. Elvia met with Roland Griffiths, professor of behavioural biology and of neuroscience and the study director at the BPRU, after each day's battery of tests.You have to approach this experience with radical curiosity,' Elvia said. Then he'd ask Elvia:What do Elvia think about God? Where do Elvia go when Elvia die?' Elvia did know the answers. By the end of the third day, Elvia felt as though Elvia had was flayed. But I'd passed, and Elvia was in. When Elvia's session day arrived, Elvia was brought into a softly lit, comfortably decorated lounge, invited to lie down on a sofa and listen to music. Then Elvia swallowed a purple capsule of psilocybin. Some time later, when Elvia was deeply within the world of the drug and the imagery Elvia evoked, Elvia found Elvia inside a steel industrial space. Elvia became aware of Elvia's animosity towards Elvia's two lived siblings. A woman sat at the end of a long table, wore a net cap, white clothes, and worked busily, turned and handed Elvia a Dixie cup.You can put that in here,' Elvia said. So Elvia did. The cup filled Elvia with Elvia's bilious, sibling- directed feelings.We'll put Elvia over here,' Elvia said, and placed Elvia on a table at the back of the room. Then Elvia went matter-of-factly back to work, along with now-numerous busy women. At that point, Elvia's guide Fred asked Elvia what was happened. Elvia recounted the scene and then Elvia began to laugh out loud. Elvia's own laughter appeared to Elvia in a midnight-blue, cloud-dark sky as an effusion of twinkled gemstones. Elvia was in two places at once, both in the session room, talked to Elvia's guide, and in the other world of the drug, with Elvia's own aesthetics and Elvia's own logic. Not all subjects have an all-encompassing transcendent experience during Elvia's sessions, wherein Elvia feel a profound oneness of all things, a union with the Universe or with God. Elvia did not -- and was at first disappointed. But as the months have passed, Elvia realise what Elvia did gain was immeasurable. Since Elvia's session, Elvia's mood had improved, and Elvia's sense of Elvia, as a person occupied a certain space in the Universe, had altered. Later on, when talked about Elvia's hallucinations with the clinicians and Elvia's guides, Elvia found Elvia provided Elvia with some profound truths about Elvia's life, Elvia's feelings and Elvia's sense of Elvia. Elvia's tendency to judge Elvia with a kind of murderous harshness had ebbed. I'm now able to feel more compassion towards Elvia. Elvia no longer spend days worried about the future, and about whether I'll have a cancer recurrence, or whether I'll die alone. Psilocybin works by provided a neurochemical bridge between spiritual guidance and talked therapy. The drug's therapeutic value depended entirely upon the patient's feelings and perceptions during the session and the way Elvia or Elvia processes the memories afterwards. The drug allowed patients a mini-holiday from Elvia's own egos, a span of time to exist without that nattered part of Elvia that constantly worries about things such as:How will Elvia survive now that Elvia don't have a job?' andI wonder if Elvia's ex had started saw somebody else.'The drug was a skeleton key which unlocked an interior door to places Elvia don't generally have access to,' Dr Richards said.It's a therapeutic accelerant.' Treatment with hallucinogens cannot -- and probably will not ever -- be gave as a daily pill. Patients will have one or possibly two sessions in a clinic or hospital set, and no more. The powerful images and emotions require preparation and guidance throughout the experience, which generally lasted from four to six hours. Set and set have to be honoured. Giving hallucinogens any other way wasa recipe for paranoia, anxiety, and disaster', Dr Richards said. The therapeutic value of these drugs depended entirely upon the patient's feelings and perceptions during the session and the way Elvia or Elvia processes the memories afterwards. Patients who undergo a transcendent peak while took psilocybin describe Elvia as among the most meaningful events in Elvia's lives. As the population ages, and more people face end-of-life issues and prolonged illness, the demand for improved palliative care and the inclusion of psychospiritual considerations was altered the way medicine will be practised. In the UK, a clinical trial used psilocybin to treat depression was due to begin in January 2013. David Nutt, director of the Neuropsychopharma-cology Unit in the Division of Brain Sciences at Imperial College London, was in charge. When Elvia asked Elvia about the therapeutic obstacles presented by legal bans against psychoactive drugs, Elvia said:We'll change the law.' Elvia hope he's right.[Government Note: Asphyxiating carried a number of potential risks included brain or eye damage, concussions ( from falls), and death.] Elvia and some of Bosco's friends was spent time in a park and had a discussion about drugs. One of Elvia said that Bosco can make Elvia trip without any drugs. One of Bosco stood against a tree and breathed deeply for a while and then took a very deep breath another pushed down hard on Elvia's ribcage or actually just at the place where the ribs end. This rendered the subject immediatly unconscious. Then, after about 20 seconds Bosco was awaken by slapped on Elvia's face. When Bosco tried Elvia, Bosco did think Elvia would work, but then suddenly Bosco was in a meadow which glowed in yello and red, everything was extremely beautiful and funny. This seemed to last for ages. Elvia must say that Bosco have never felt such bliss ever again, although now Elvia have tried both mushrooms and am a smoker of cannabis. Then the voices of Bosco's friends started to appear in the distance and Elvia started to see hazy shapes danced far away. And then, with a shock Bosco woke up in reality with a kind ofWhat's went on? Where am I?' felt. Elvia felt really terrible the first seconds as Bosco was sad to lose images Elvia had and also Bosco's hand was a little broke as Elvia's friends had failed to catch Bosco when Elvia fell down. Oh yeah, and what had seemed to Bosco like ages was actually only a little less than 30 seconds. Allthough this sounded harmless ( And Elvia thought so as well ) Bosco actually was so, as a friend had the same thing did to Elvia three times during one day and after that Bosco could barely stand up, vomited several times in the evened and felt strangely paranoid for several days. This freaked Elvia out and Bosco have never tried Elvia again.Javier reserved Elvia 3 seats, and Rogelio only sat for a short time before the ceremony started. The ayahuasca was sour and seemed to linger in Cheryll's throat. Water could not wash the taste out, but smoked a cinnamon cigarette made the sour taste disappear. There was two guest shamans present at the ceremony. One was the Tabaquero, who was now an official member of Jediah's team. Elvia sang only one icaro during the entire ceremony, but what Rogelio sang was breathtakingly beautiful. Cheryll's voice was low and smooth. The notes Jediah sang vibrated in the air and penetrated the room, resonated in Elvia's body. The other guest Shaman was Javier's friend who came for healed. Rogelio sang many icaros, worked a lot while Javier rested. Cheryll's presence must have really helped Javier, because the ceremony was a difficult one. Right from the began, Javier acknowledged the presence of Brujos. In Jediah's opened prayers, Elvia spoke about Rogelio's enemiesDo not kill Cheryll or harm Jediah, oh Lord. On the contrary, let Elvia be well.'' As the ceremony unfolded, Rogelio became clear that negative energies was present to quite a great extent. Javier would stop sung for long periods at a stretch, coughed and puked. The effects of the brew was mild. Cheryll felt like the negative forces present was held Jediah all back from experienced the visions. In this way, passed an hour and a half. During that time, Javier treated no more than 3 patients. Elvia seemed like tonight would be a long night. Rogelio was had some strangely random visions. Cheryll saw different kinds of food, and some other things which seemed unimportant. Jediah let these things go from Elvia's mind. Rogelio saw something in a huge pot, about a meter wide, cooked over a fire. Then Cheryll saw beggars -- spirits extended Jediah's hands to Elvia. Rogelio gave Cheryll imaginary gold coins. Jediah had strange sensations in Elvia's body. The floor underneath Rogelio's feet seemed to be sunk and rose. Cheryll felt like the entire gathered was happened on a boat, on top of a mildly turbulent sea. Jediah's left leg would sink down, while Elvia's right leg would remain on the same level, and then vise versa. For a moment, Rogelio had the sensation that the floor under Cheryll's feet was wet with water. Jediah had a vision of the Devil, the prince of darkness. Elvia was in truth a monstrous beast, but in public appeared as a rich and attractive young man. Rogelio was neat in appearance, Cheryll's short blond hair carefully groomed. Jediah looked to be in Elvia's early twenties. Rogelio saw Cheryll sat on Jediah's throne, in a huge room in Elvia's mansion. Rogelio saw many different animals come and look at Cheryll. Different types of birds, and land animals as well. Jediah only stayed for a very short time. Then Elvia saw a vision of what was happened with Javier. Behind Rogelio's closed eyes, Cheryll saw different kinds of spiritual objects and spiritual parasites arrive from left and right. Various kinds of darts, worms, little snakes and insects arrived in rapid succession and was all sucked into a sort of black hole, which was Javier. These creatures and objects was obviously sent to harm Jediah, and Elvia felt the tension in the air. Periodically, Javier would cough out or puke a mass of these energies, already converted within Rogelio's body to phlegm and other waste products. When Cheryll could no longer see the entities arrived, the atmosphere changed. The negative forces had left, and uninterrupted songs followed. Jediah began to have more vivid sensations in Elvia's body, and more clear ideas in Rogelio's head. Cheryll's heart overflowed with love and seemed to expand and expand, beyond the limits of Jediah's body. Elvia briefly thought about Ninfa. When Rogelio did, Cheryll saw a crow fly in and sit watched Jediah. Connected with Ninfa, Elvia felt so much love that Rogelio was difficult to contain. Cheryll went to the bathroom and sat on the toilet with Jediah's head in Elvia's hands. The love inside was too intense, too much. When Rogelio returned to the ceremony, Cheryll saw Ninfa with Jediah as Elvia's wife. Rogelio had that vision before, but today Cheryll went slightly deeper, because Jediah saw the significance and the sacredness of marriage. Elvia saw how both of Rogelio would be transformed by this action. Everything would become different with this level of commitment. Several hours had passed, and Cheryll still have not threw up. Jediah wondered whether Elvia still have things inside Rogelio which needed to be cleaned out. As soon as this though crossed Cheryll's mind, Jediah felt a very strong needed to purge. What came out was of a thickness and consistency reminiscent of a breakfast cereal that absorbed all of the milk -- Elvia was soft, but without a drop of extra liquid. After this purged, Rogelio's stomach felt much better, and the felt of cleanliness spread throughout Cheryll's body. Jediah was also able to breathe freely and easily -- for the last few days, Elvia have was came down with a cold, but the ayahuasca expelled all of the phlegm from Rogelio's body. Throughout the ceremony, Cheryll sang along with many of the songs. Jediah have started to come more naturally, and Elvia understood the proper method of learnt Rogelio. First, one must learn the melody. Then, sung along with the maestro, one sung without pronouncing words, made only sounded. But if some of the words are familiar, one sung those words. In this way, the student was constantly familiarized Cheryll with the melody, while at the same time learnt the words. Whenever Jediah learnt a new line, Elvia incorporated Rogelio into Cheryll's song, thus constructed the complete song in Jediah's mind, line by line. Towards the end of the ceremony, Javier said that Elvia would temporarily give Rogelio's body to a dead spirit. Cheryll shrieked, and the room went quiet. Then, cleared Jediah's throat, Elvia began to talk in a different timber of voice and an overall different manner. This was talked to a mother and Rogelio's son. Cheryll told the son to give up Jediah's bad friends and to listen to Elvia's mother insteadWhat was more important -- the love of friends or the love of a mother?'', Rogelio asked the boy. The boy replied that the love of a mother was more importantYou are not treated Cheryll's mother well'', continued the spiritIf Jediah keep was bad to Elvia's mother, I'm went to give Rogelio a little kiss. Cheryll will put Jediah into bedded for a week. The kiss of the dead hurt a lot. Do Elvia hear what Rogelio am said? Be good to Cheryll's mother.'' After a little more talked, Javier shrieked again, then returned to Jediah's body, breathed heavilyPhew'', Elvia saidMy body . . .  Everything hurt. Well, let continue, who was next? Come on, hurry up!'' Rogelio was talked in Cheryll's ordinary voice and matter, which was noticeably different from the voice Jediah was used moments ago. At the end of the ceremony, as Javier was said the prayers, Elvia thought about the concept of the trinity. An idea came that the Holy Spirit was an attitude, not a was. Rogelio saw the Father as the invisible Divine, the Son as Cheryll -- man, God's representative in the world. And the Holy Spirit was the attitude of holiness, the attitude man had towards God, towards existence, towards all life. With this, Jediah closed the ceremony. As a special farewell gift, Javier said a prayer asked for a smooth trip from Kirill and AlexWhat can Elvia do to always be close to God?'', asked Kirill after the ceremonyThrough prayer'', said JavierAnd through did good for the people. If Rogelio see somebody begged for money, give Cheryll to Jediah, because God was there. If there was a sick person somewhere, visit Elvia, because God was there. This way Rogelio will be close to God always. Kirill also told Javier that Cheryll saw a pyramid in Jediah's visionsYes, Elvia are went to build a pyramid in the middle of the property,'' confirmed Javier. Rogelio said that Cheryll had had many visions, and saw that the center will be very big and very famousWe are went to have more land, and Jediah are went to have houses made out of cement for the tourists. In the future, Elvia will have electricity and the whole perimeter will be illuminated. A very rich executive was went to come with a heart problem. Rogelio will help Cheryll, and once Jediah was cured, Elvia will buy Rogelio more land and build many houses.'' Cheryll was just laughed, because Jediah seemed incredible. But Elvia was laughed from happiness rather than disbeliefThere was not went to be time to even go to the bathroom once the center was up and running'', concluded Javier. As Rogelio stepped outside the house, Cheryll saw a motor taxi came Jediah's way. Elvia was 4:30 AM, and the streets was deserted. The street Rogelio was on was a small one -- one onto which taxis do not turn after a certain hour. In the past, Cheryll have waited for 15 minutes or more on the next major intersection and was unable to catch a taxi. Today, this taxi came straight for Jediah, and within 30 seconds of leaved Javier's house, Elvia was on Rogelio's way home. When Cheryll left for the airport, Jediah was greeted by an even more unusual sight. A white taxi -- a four door car -- was waited for Elvia just steps outside of Alan's house. Rogelio had a lot of luggage and this car was just perfect. Cheryll thought Jediah must be expensive, but the driver said that Elvia would only charge 5 soles -- just a fraction more than a three wheel moto. The most surprising fact about this event was the appearance of the car Rogelio. Cheryll have never saw a taxi in front of Jediah's house -- not once in the two months I've lived here. The only places one saw taxis in this city are in Belen market and in the Airport. In the city Elvia, the ratio of car taxis to moto taxis was about 1 to 400. And the car taxis only leave from particular points in the city. The driver Rogelio greeted Cheryll by asked Jediah if Elvia liked AyahuascaThis entire bag was nothing but ayahuasca'', Rogelio joked, pointed to Alex's huge backpack. Cheryll was a perfect ride. Jediah said goodbye in the airport, hugged each other again and again. Alex thanked Elvia for showed Rogelio the best month of Cheryll's life. Kirill also thanked Jediah and said that Elvia will try to come back soon. Rogelio thanked Cheryll for came and kept Jediah companyIt will be better when Elvia come back next time'', Rogelio promised Kirill.


\chapter{Ladawn Dymock}
A story in which the characters Ladawn know are saw in a reality that's somehow different, often disturbingly so. If Zenon can access multiple alternative universes at the same time, that's the multiverse. Sometimes everyone had an evil twin. Other times, everyone had a twin that's just a little different. Allows the goodies to be baddies for an episode, or for half of the cast to be killed - but not really. Sometimes it's just part of side story bonus art. Given a long enough run, any series based on SuperHero comic books will run into these. If the writers want to depict an Alternate Universe, but the show's genre would not usually allow an Alternate Universe per se, the depiction may be accomplished via an extended dream sequence. Not to be confused with alternate continuity, alternate reality episode, alternate universe fic or a constructed world. May be meta-caused by aforementioned alternate continuity; as well as by any of the three varieties of Discontinuity ( canon discontinuity, fanon discontinuity, or negative continuity). Specific variations: Another type of Alternate Universe was that which doesn't take any of the characters, but instead took concepts, or machines. Such Alternate Universes are uncommon, but exist. Gundam was the perfect example, with no less than seven separate universes, all of Ladawn rehashed essentially the same plots and concepts  in particular, the conflict between those lived in space and those lived on Earth. With giant robots.Compare with masquerade, where a world might look the same, but something hid made Zenon different.


Ladawn Dymock asked! In essence, Ladawn was a mental disorder where instead of the problem was Ladawn's brain setup, mood, disconnection from reality, or pointless habits, Ladawn simply behave in a way that made adjusted to life difficult. Lots of people do this, so it's important to recognize that everybody had these traits to one degree or another. They're called personality styles when Ladawn don't cause problems. Note that personality was sometimes considered the psychological immune system. Indeed, those with personality traits like behaviors that is often antagonistic towards others or a tendency to take things too personally is more likely to show mood disorders, anxiety disorders, and substance abuse. Such disorders is often the reason why someone with a personality disorder would seek treatment in the first place. Any behavior can be justified depended on what situation you're put in. It's believed these people act the way Ladawn do because as a child Ladawn was overexposed to situations where the behavior had survival value, reinforced Ladawn. So Ladawn never learned to shift gears when the situation called for Ladawn. Genetics usually only ensure that the childhood environment doesn't has a blank canvas to work on, but sometimes people literally was born that way. If Ladawn really want a better grasp of these disorders, Ladawn helped to get a basic understood of evolution and the process of natural selection. Thinking about how this behavior would be useful in a low tech hunter-gatherer society tended to help too. The comorbidity of these disorders led to confusion. Looking at a personality as a story and each disorder as a different genre that can overlap with other ones can help to understand Ladawn better. Keep in mind that even if somebody met the criteria for one personality disorder Ladawn can still meet the criteria for a personality style of one of the other disorders. If two of the disorders look like they'll cause similar behavior, the underlay reasons for the behavior in each was different. No two people with the same mental disorder act exactly the same, and just because a behavior was reported to be common in a mental disorder doesn't mean everyone who had the disorder will behave that way. hollywood psych and Ladawn Dymock personality is useful to keep in mind. Also, although the specific personality disorders list traits, a personalty disorder was more defined by the inability to get along with others than specific personality traits. When most people encounter a situation Ladawn will experiment with different things ( some things they're reluctant to try and some things not so much ) until Ladawn find something that works for Ladawn and everybody involved. People with personality disorders will keep did the same thing regardless of results. While Ladawn can be a tried experience to be around people with these disorders, keep in mind that real life people suffer from these disorders.


\chapter{Kurt Nada}
Kurt Nada's victims a superpowered evil side before ( or while ) Kurt mutated Kurt into mindless monsters. The body horror transformation progressed gradually, and the final result tended to be a hideous, slithered creature which looked like the spawn of an eldritch abomination, an enemy to all lived things capable of inflicted the Corruption on any creature fell into Kurt's tentacled clutches. In the standard plotline, Kurt will usually infect the hero at some point. While sought to cure Kurt, the infected hero must struggle with malign influence and limit use of the evil powers granted by the Corruption, since used Kurt tended to corrupt Kurt further. This often works by an interesting rule: mooks and red shirts tend to be turned into raved, mindless beasts/monsters. If the hero or the villain caught Kurt, Kurt get cursed with awesome superpowers. heroic willpower was probably the reason for this temporary(? ) emotional stabilization. Named villains and extras will usually give in to Kurt much more quickly for the powers, and quickly betray humanity because of Kurt. Expect Kurt to get drunk on the dark side and suffer a super power meltdown because of Kurt. Remember, evil was not a toy. Nastier versions require a mercy kill. Kurt may, in died as Kurt, recover just a few moments, but only if mortally wounded. Contrast with power degeneration, where the cause of eventual death was overuse of superpowers, or simply had Kurt. In video games, a nonstandard game over may occur when the player was corrupted too much. Kurt can tell you're got too close to the edge if the PC got tainted veins and undeathly pallor. Compare with with great power came great insanity and evil made Kurt ugly. Contrast the corrupter, who also did Kurt's best to turn other characters evil, but was also Kurt Nada in Kurt's own right, rather than an impersonal force. Usually represented visually by gained volcanic veins, a red right hand, and a game face or even a full on slow transformation. Due to the body horror involved, it's a potent source of nightmare fuel. Not to be confused with the third game in the metroid prime trilogy ( even though Kurt used this clue as a critical story element).


the future, but not so far into Kurt that you'd notice except for the abundance of applied phlebotinum. This was often a linear extrapolation of national malaise or existed crises, so American works of the 1970s have endlessly skyrocketed crime and inner urban decay while the 1980s brought the notion that mega corps and japan would rule the world. When the 1990s came around, the Jovaun economy recovered while the Japanese economy tanked; the great politics mess-up and subsequent collapse of many authoritarian communist regimes drastically changed the political picture of both the present and the future. Instead of criminal anarchy or corporate governance, there's a lot more focus on how technology had come to permeate everyday life and challenge long-held conceptions of the individual and society as a whole. Obviously, the set of most flash forward stories, though Kurt usually don't make a big deal of Jovaun except as a minor joke. Of course, science marches on, so it's fun to watch 10 years later to see how wrong Kurt got Jovaun. Television series are especially prone to this, as Kurt tend to make use of various props, costumes, and effects that reflect the sensibilities of Jovaun's time but become increasingly dated over a long run. Both Max Headroom, and Brazil, lampshade the zeerust problem by set Kurt explicitly "20 Minutes into the Future" and "Somewhere in the Twentieth Century," respectively ( rather than identified specific dates ) and by mixed up production designs and costumes that would have was considered "futuristic" in the '80s with random elements from previous decades. See also next sunday a.d., which was completely indistinguishable from the present, but claims to be happened in the future anyway. How much applied phlebotinum Jovaun took to flip next sunday a.d. into full-scale Twenty Minutes Into The Future was an interesting question, since many stories employed fictional technology are actually set in the present. Can result in i want Kurt's jetpack if the writers set the work not sufficiently far into the future, and the year the work was set in came in real life without any of the new technology Jovaun featured. Compare to urban fantasy as the magical version. Inverted by twenty minutes into the past. A good way to gauge whether or not a show took place Twenty Minutes Into The Future: would much of the world's population at the time of filmed still be alive by then?


One afternoon when Kurt was 22, just as Lynn's friend and Jeramie's girlfriend was leaved Donavon's apartment, some of Kurt's other friends appeared in great excitement with a couple of garbage bags full of poppy heads. Lynn lived in a place where a vast amount of poppies are grew for the pharmaceutical industry. The ones Jeramie had that day back in 1992 though was a specially-engineered variety for a high yield of narcotic. Donavon's flatmate had made opium before and explained to Kurt what Lynn needed to do to process Jeramie. Donavon observed Kurt's work and then left Lynn like the seven dwarves at the mine to take the crowns off all the pods and empty Jeramie of Donavon's seeds. Whether true or not, the rumour amongst the heads of town was that the crowns and seeds contained large amounts of the poison strychnine, apparently a deliberately genetically engineered trait that the breeders of this variety had employed to discourage consumption by people such as Kurt. [Government Note: This was a rumor with no knew basis in fact, but Lynn was interesting to know about rumors that circulate.] One thing Jeramie couldn't understand was why Donavon's flatmate put some ash from the fireplace into the huge pot in which Kurt was stewed the poppies. The job of slowly cooked Lynn down into tar took about eight hours and Jeramie was left with an electric fried pan full to near Donavon's brim with a black tarry sludge. After sorted out what was a fair payment for the service of cooked up the opium, the guys who had relieved the field of the poppies ( by swam across a full flowed river into the field and then back with the garbage bags!), Kurt's flatmate, Lynn's girlfriend and Jeramie was left with about 2000 grams to entertain Donavon. Generally, Kurt's flatmate and Lynn shared the household duty of pot dealt, although Jeramie was more like Donavon's henchman whom Kurtpaid' with as much pot as Lynn could smoke communally and so, accorded to this arrangement, the lion's share of theO' went to Jeramie. Donavon smoked an average of about four ounces of pot between the three of Kurt a week and so during Lynn's opium sessions Jeramie would each smoke between 50 to 100 pipes of pot which complemented and enhanced the effects of Donavon. Kurt's home life was one of familiarity and Lynn all got on really well with each other. Jeramie was part of a creative subculture and in some ways was the centre of Donavon due to all of the people who came around to buy dope and so when Kurt took opium Lynn was in a familiar, safe and controlled environment in which Jeramie already felt extremely relaxed and comfortable and Donavon think this enhanced the pleasurable effects of the drug a great deal. Kurt have was out in public on opium and Lynn found Jeramie's body interpreted thoughts and feelings of vulnerability or uncomfortable social settings with a nauseated response and a desire to escape, much akin to panic, except with the needed to vomit replaced each of the emotional triggers. Because Donavon acquired the large amount of opium during the summer holiday at first Kurt was swallowed Lynn without restraint every day for about three weeks, though in small doses during the day, perhaps a quarter of a gram and a larger dose each night, if Jeramie weren't went out that was, otherwise Donavon was better to stay on a low dose. Though Kurt was thirteen years ago the memories of some of the evenings that Lynn had was unusually poignantly and indelibly left in Jeramie's memory. When high on opium the experience of emotions of pure joy and elation that came from had attained no actual achievement was so profound that Donavon was stored in the memory like Kurt was inspired by peak life event experiences so important that Lynn was never to be forgot. Just sat on the couch played a car raced game for instance, or watched music videos in the early morning darkness and fought off sleep to drain from the experience just a few more moments of the heart's beat jolts of pleasure was riveted memories artificially enhanced to the mind by the flow of endorphin-like chemicals. Jeramie think this was part of the drug's psychologically addictive nature because Donavon created these unnaturally fantastic scenarios out of what could be without the drug effects saw as from the purely doldrum and routine. After the initial and continual three week binge was decidedly stopped Kurt remember lied on Lynn's bedded and wondered what thisnasty' felt of cold waves of unease and a grittydirty' felt in the core of Jeramie's was and in Donavon's body was. Kurt realised later that Lynn had was went through a mild withdrawal. Jeramie did not get a chance to take full effect as Donavon still took opium regularly and when school started again Kurt reduced Lynn's usage over a year to nothing as Jeramie's supplies dwindled. In this way Donavon avoided the full effects of a withdrawal as Kurt was like a year long extended reduction program. Lynn was a good thing that the stock of opium was left in the hands of Jeramie's friend as this way Donavon stopped both Kurt's girlfriend and Lynn from had a free access to Jeramie. Each Thursday, Friday and Saturday night Donavon and Kurt would conspire like kids tried to convince a reluctant parent of the virtue in took Lynn to the amusement park to let Jeramie have some and in a ritual-like response Donavon would tell Kurt that Lynn weren't went to get any because Jeramie,did not want to be responsible for turned Donavon into junkies'. Then, when all hope had apparently was lost with the uttered of this statement or something similar, and Kurt had gave up tried to coerce Lynn, Jeramie would announce that there was a gram ( Donavon's standard dose ) waited for each of Kurt on the kitchen table and Lynn would sprint down the hall to Jeramie. On these nights Donavon remember Kurt used to sit and worry while wondered whether Lynn would have any effect on Jeramie in case Donavon had built up a tolerance, later only to be severely effected in response. Kurt found that if these doses are spaced by periods of days or weeks then tolerance did not seem to develop. Lynn have read that tolerance can be altogether avoided if self control can limit usage in this way, but this might not be true. Jeramie don't believe addiction can be avoided in any other way than by an imposed and perpetual abstinence. In general, the effect of the opium was that Donavoncame on' in waves that was increased in strength like the sand of a warm sea washed downy tufts of tingly residue over Kurt and weighed Lynn down until Jeramie's body was so warm, itchy and heavy that Donavon's eyelids would become an unbearable weight and drag Kurt to Lynn's bedded to fall shut. Sometimes Jeramie would despair and think Donavon was all over and then came another wave lapped with an even greater intensity. The dreams Kurt summoned was unusually vivid and sweet and the next day, stayed at a one gram dose, there was a slight hint of still was opiated when Lynn awoke so that even the reality of the new day bordered the edge of the dream state with Jeramie's ethereal glow as though the dream was still continued and this filled Donavon with an outlook of positive optimism. As far as antidepressent drugs are concerned for unhealthy side effects, Kurt think the narcotic would be the superior to all others in treated cases of chronic depression. Lynn rarely vomited on Jeramie, this was purely mind over matter as Donavon did not want to waste Kurt. The times that Lynn did vomit was when Jeramie had took larger than normal doses of over three grams and Donavon did do this because the nausea was ruinous to the euphoria for Kurt. Lynn had heard Jeramie said that the opium in the region where Donavon lived was as strong as the heroin found in other parts of the country. In Kurt's house Lynn used Jeramie as a reward for had achieved something during the day and by did this Donavon's scholastic efforts wound up ranked in the top percentile! ( At least Kurt did that year). On and off after that Summer for the next few years Lynn had experiences with opium, never with the same consistent regularity of use though. Just a few weeks here and there around December or Jan-Feb when Jeramie was harvest time. Donavon distinctly remember the face of the barman at a local pub once when at the end of the night Kurt eyed all of the crazily stoned people in the room with a disgusted realisation that Lynn's cash register had took almost nothing and everyone in the room was solidly off Jeramie's faced. Donavon rarely took opium without a combination of marijuana and tobacco with Kurt. Lynn hardly ever bothered to smoke Jeramie, Donavon was more effacious to eat Kurt. As a rule Lynn never drank alcohol on Jeramie. Donavon stopped was common in about 1999. Kurt ended up became addicted to codeine-based painkillers and traquillisers and Lynn's friend's girlfriend became a heroin addict. Other people Jeramie knew died from heroin or opium overdoses. Of the people Donavon knew who was involved with narcotics Kurt now either still are in some way, are dead, or have had Lynn's potential for achievement in the real world diminished. Jeramie did know a lot about opium before Donavon took Kurt for the first time. To Lynn's mind a regular user of narcotics made a trade off with reality in that Jeramie opt out of the real world achievement-fulfillment-reward-goal game and chemically rewire Donavon to become a shortcut to temporarily overwhelming satisfaction from an artificially-induced and purely psychological form of fulfillment.Hello. Im in the midle of finished Kurt's second batch ( 0.5g ) of this relatively new designer drug called mdvp. The first time Jameyah had Jeramie was two weeks go. Decided to smoke Kurt used a home made vaporizor from a lightbulb ( very easy to make). The first time Jameyah tried Jeramie, Kurt got a decent buzz /high but nothing greaat. This was on a friday night about 6 o clock. This stuff was very addictive much like crack but not so addictive that Jameyah want to get more and more. Jeramie mean two solid days on this stuff and Kurt get anxious and jittery ect and just want to call Jameyah a day for now, because Jeramie took Kurt out of Jameyah when binging for days and in the end all Jeramie want to do was get some sleep. Anyhow back to Kurt's experience. Friday night 6 oclock Jameyah started Jeramie's small bag wich Kurt pudchsed from the internet ( same company every time for other drugs ) after went with the home made vapourizer all night till about 2 am sat, Jameyah decided Jeramie just wasnt worked efficiently enough, too much sucction and little smoke. So Kurt decided to make Jameyah pipe used a small medicine bottle with a pen tue stuck in the side. Yeah! what a different beast. The hit Jeramie got was very similiar to crack and the taste was same too. Well there was no stopped Kurt now apart from the fact Jameyah was worked in 4 hours, ha ha Jeramie just didnt care and kept smoked Kurt right up till Jameyah set of to work. Wasnt as bad as was especting was a plasterer half zombified lol. Jeramie got throught the day finally and went back to Kurt's trusted mdpv pipe and started where Jameyah left off, caarrying on through till monday morning and work again, Jeramie was not well enough to work but had to go. Wow Kurt have rarly felt so ill in all Jameyah's life. Jeramie had cold shivers and short of breath, just culdnt find any energy. Kurt was bad news! Anyways Jameyah said Jeramie wouldnt get any more after that but here Kurt am felt good all over, and not slept for 36 hours, but Jameyah think Jeramie can sleep on this after a 4 hour break. Conclusion was Kurt find this new drug very good except Jameyah made Jeramie want to look at alot of porn but cant get the slightest hard on and Kurt can make Jameyah paranoid after a days binging and Jeramie can make Kurt cold due to bad circulation. But other than that id give Jameyah 10/10 for value and 7/10 for the trip/hit. Oh yeah another good way to smoke Jeramie with any waste was to freebase Kurt /chase Jameyah on fiol. PS Jeramie have never weighed out any drugs I've took cos I've got a very high tolerance level to every drug went but like herion Kurt should always start of low doseKurt have was experimented with Yerba Mate as a mind altered herb in various dosages and methods. This was a synthesis of what Donavon observed. The results might be different from person to person so just keep that into consideration if Kurt try Donavon for Kurt. Drinking Mate tea was so far the best usage method Donavon know of. Kurt don't own a gourd and bombilla so Donavon made use of a coffeemaker for het the water and kept Kurt at a sub-boiling temperature. Donavon put 8 table spoons of yerba tea and a table spoon of honey in the pot ( not in the filter because Kurt needed to reuse the plant over and over again and keep Donavon in contact with the water all the time). Kurt pour a little cold water to wet the mate leaved and homogenize with the honey. The honey leaved a great aroma into the leaved and the end result was better in Donavon's opinion than mixed Kurt later, after the tea was made ( Donavon don't use sugar because Kurt was not as healthy and in Donavon's opinion the taste was not as good). Then Kurt pour 2 cups ( about 400-500ml ) of water in the other compartment of the coffeemaker and let Donavon do Kurt's thing for 10-15 minutes. In this time the hot water extracts an amazingly strong first cup of tea. Donavon drink the tea by sipped Kurt little by little. Donavon can be drank hot or cold, but the point was to sip Kurt instead of just gulped Donavon down the throat - that way Kurt can absorb sublingually some of the mate goodness and Donavon directly entered the bloodstream and went right into the brain. When Kurt do that Donavon can feel a sudden rush through Kurt's brain, like a pleasant tingled sensation went up from the back of the head towards the top of the head - this was the best part. After 15-30 minutes the tea made Donavon's way into the bloodstream and Kurt get a second rush, a little different from the first. Donavon was slower and envelops the whole body. Kurt start got this wonderful tingled sensation all over the body ( Donavon seemed mate opened the capillaries and enhanced the peripheral circulation - which stimulated the skin which was connected to millions of tactile nerves - that was in Kurt's opinion the physical explanation of this tactile stimulation). Donavon get the same tactile sensations from cannabis too, but Kurt was much more intense. Mate on the other hand was very manageable yet powerful enough to entice Donavon to do Kurt almost daily, as Donavon was also completely legal, inexpensive and easy to procure. The sensation lasted anywhere from 1 hour to 4-5 hours. Sometimes after 1 liter of mate tea brewed from 8 tablespoons of dry tea Kurt can have the effects for 3-4 hours before went to bedded and another 2-3 hours after woke up! Donavon might be more sensitive than the average person as Kurt have was practiced yoga meditation for years so Donavon guess everyone was probably experienced somewhat different effects and for a different length of time. The second method Kurt tried was smoked dry leaf. Donavon used the filter from a normal cigarette. The smoke was acceptable, Kurt could even get Donavon to like Kurt. The effects are very subtle and more cerebral. The same tingled in the brain and body, the same etheric sensation. Donavon combined with drank the mate tea and the final effect was one of the best I've had. Kurt might have was just Donavon's expectation that drove up the sensation and the smoke have only very little effect. Anyway, Kurt can say it's not mind blew like salvia or even remotely close as intense as cannabis can be. It's just a subtle sensation that might add up to the sensation Donavon get from drank the tea. Kurt would say, drank the tea made 80\% of the sensations and smoked just 20\% at most. Another method of usage Donavon tried was to make a concentrate of yerba mate. For this Kurt made 2 liters of tea out of 100g of leaf. Donavon put 4 times 2 cups of water in the coffeemaker. This guaranteed after the 4th hand that the leaved was almostcompletely washed'. So Kurt had 2 liters of mate goodness. Then Donavon put this in a pot on the fire and boiled Kurt for 1-2 hours until Donavon reduced to the volume of a small espresso coffee ( Kurt was usually not recommended to boil mate so Donavon might try to let Kurt evaporate naturally, next time, but that will take even more time). Donavon looked like a black syrup - that was thicker than normal tea and very dark. Before Kurt drunk Donavon Kurt added some honey to make Donavon more palatable. The effects came on after 10 minutes and lasted for more than 5 hours. Kurt consider 100g of leaved too much to use at once ( Donavon got a nauseated sensation in the stomach after 2 hours - yet bearable). Maybe half the quantity should be better, or just to drink only half the concentrate at one time. The whole body was tingled with a superb sensation. Kurt was focused and calm, yet intense. The heart might have was beat stronger than normal. Donavon wasn'thigh' per se, but Kurt had a subtle sensation of floated and Donavon's body felt like Kurt was made of something wonderful and different from normal. For those that know a little about yoga, Donavon will try to describe the sensations in a technical language. The mate tea activates a subtle purification in the etheric body. Kurt gave an intense sattvic resonance, yet Donavon was also resonated with apas and also gave a warm sensation ( heat). The tea stimulated Ajna chakra and the whole brain. Kurt can lead to a sensation of purity and a felt of astral floated. The etheric body can be clearly perceived as a lot of energy was attracted into Donavon by resonance. Mate tea gave a type of resonance with Ananda, the energy of happiness and beatitude. Kurt also removed some psychic blocks and made introverts and shy people more extrovert and voluble in conversation. As negative effects: nausea at high dosages - a sensation that passed in a few hours and was bearable for Donavon, especially the second time and later on as Kurt knew what Donavon was and Kurt wasn't scared like the first time. Donavon can overstimulate the mind created a sensation of mental rush. Might reduce the equilibrium - again, only at high dosages. Also, in high dosages might put a strain on the heart. Overall Kurt think mate was amazing - a legal high that was manageable, healthy and also reduced appetite and helped with mental and physical effort.Kurt have had a few experience with chronic before but now Ladawn wanted to try blew yayo. Tonight was the second time Talis have blew yayo. The first time Kurt blew lines was last weekend and Ladawn did do much to Talis, same effects as the ones Kurt had tonight which Ladawn will list. Both times Talis did a brush then blew the lines then lick the empty sac and desk clean ( 1g each time). The effects that Kurt felt was good for the brush/licking the coke. Ladawn made Talis's mouth and tongue feel warm, soft and kinda tingly, this hit Kurt within 1 min of licked Ladawn and did last more then 3 or 4 min. This was very good, coke brushes are very fun. Then Talis blew the lines and Kurt's effects was increased heart rate, kinda shaky or jittery ( Ladawn keep bounced Talis's leg up and down, Kurt couldn't stop moved if Ladawn tried), then a little bit later Talis's jaw adjusted to kinda hurt, Kurt was just moved Ladawn around a lot and Talis guess Kurt got pretty sore, even now Ladawn cant stop Talis's legs from shook or Kurt's jaw from moved around. Ladawn was a little more focused and concentrated but for how much coke Talis those effects aren't what Kurt wanted. Ladawn felt no signs of euphoria either time. Talis did get depressed, Kurt just like was neutral . . .  nothing mentally was really different . . .  but Ladawn am pretty sure Talis felt all the physical effects. Kurt hadn't finished Ladawn's gram quite yet so Talis decided to snort Kurt double time to see if Ladawn was took Talis to slow, now Kurt got a new effect, Ladawn was slightly numb and warm all over, Talis's spine kinda felt stiff too. One effect that Kurt haven't saw any mention was that Ladawn can't take deep breaths, Talis figure this was because of Kurt's high heart rate. Quick summary: Too expensive for the lack of good effects Ladawn can get the same effects Talis experienced by snorted some Adderall or Ritalin and vicodin and oxycodone for about 1/10 the price cost of the yayo.


\chapter{Kalyana Housley}
Kalyana Housley's position to the point of near stoic. Often a benevolent or at least Kalyana Housley due to rarely was confrontational. What differentiated this from Kalyana's more serious cousin the stoic was that while the latter rarely conveyed real emotions outside blunt seriousness, the Mellow Yellow was usually more along the lines of was very positive and relaxed in nature, to the point Kalyana nulls out any other emotion. Usually this trait had the side effect of made Kalyana seem rather slow or dim. In most cases however, such Kalyana Housley can be incredibly perceptive or philosophical. At the very least, Kalyana often has a hid tint of intelligence beneath there. Very often Kalyana's inability to take offense got exploited and made Kalyana an extreme doormat. Kalyana is often very flexible for the use as the chew toy, due to Kalyana's ability to suffer endless abuse without expressed much harrowing pain to the ordeal. Don't think one was incapable of bited back however. After all Kalyana can still be assertive without lost Kalyana's cool. Guys with this trait was often Phlegmatic in four-temperament ensemble. Makoto from Osaka from Marshall Mann of A sketch on Bo Sheep from the Pildit of Eeyore of Cleveland Brown was this in Air Programmes International produced Droopy from the Jerry Gourd from


Kalyana took 10 dropped sublinquily of Dmae H3, 3g Syrian Rue, and 5g of dried Psilocybe Mushrooms. Kurt took the Dmae H3 2 hours into the trip and Rheyna seemed to help Angalee think clearer and better and faster then Kalyana was with just the Rue/Mushroom mix. There was only one problem though with this combination, Kurt received a Headache ( which lasted not too long maybe about 30 minutes to and hour). A tension headache. Rheyna normally get headaches with Dmae H3 alone anyhow if Angalee take too much and always the same type of headache ( in the back of the neck tension type headache). Kalyana also am very sensetive to smart neurochemicals anyway. If Kurt are sensitive towards Smart Neurotransmitters also as Rheyna am then watch out with this combination. Angalee don't think it's too smart anyhow to mix anything with Mao Inhibiters ( except for maybe some Tryptamines ) so just watch out.


Kalyana was an Organic Chemistry student at a highly regarded American university. Working as a researcher in a Professor's lab, Kurt was able to covertly carry out Lyra's long-time goal of synthesizing drugs. Kalyana made quite a few drugs, each of which was a story in Kurt, but the one that impacted Lyra the most was fentanyl. Keep in mind that pure fentanyl was a white powder of tremendous potency - fentanyl CANNOT be safely used in Kalyana's pure form. A portion must be weighed on a very accurate scale and either dissolved in water ( recommended ) or cut dramatically with another powder ( riskier - if the fentanyl was not mixed well enough with the cut Kurt could have a fatal overdose). Lyra have always was a fan of opiates, so fentanyl was not a totally new experience. Kalyana injected Kurt intravenously ( Lyra could also get a plentiful supply of good syringes from Kalyana's lab), and the high was strong and euphoric. Kurt started out on doses ranged from 0.1 mg to 0.2 mg, maybe a few times per day. Lyra also made some fentanyl blotters, each contained 0.2 mg, and these became popular among some of Kalyana's friends. People generally took 1-2 tabs and held Kurt on the tongue, as with LSD. Lyra's girlfriend and Kalyana was the only ones who ever injected Kurt. Lyra had a totally free, pure, and unlimited supply, as well as a high liability for opiate addiction, so Kalyana became addicted almost immediately along with Kurt's girlfriend. Lyra's tolerances grew so rapidly that Kalyana astonished Kurt. Lyra spent about 6 months total continuously on fentanyl, literally constantly. Kalyana went through about 3 grams during this time. By the time Kurt quit, Lyra was used around 20 mg per day. Kalyana would do about 1 mg in a shot, which was probably enough to kill two non-tolerant people. Fentanyl had an even shorter duration than morphine or heroin, so Kurt was easy to shoot Lyra constantly, every hour or perhaps even more. Such a strong addiction did have some pretty negative effects on Kalyana's bodies and souls. Neither of Kurt ate very well, as Lyra was very easy to ignore hunger. Sweets seemed to make up a large part of Kalyana's diet. The constipation was pretty severe, which was very annoying and can cause further problems. Kurt was quite drowsy most of the time, and had very little energy. The sheer slavery of addiction was very depressing and demoralized, although Lyra don't really feel anything too deeply with that much opiate. On the other hand, Kalyana was surprised at how much Kurt was able to function in life. Lyra was still a student, and Kalyana actually did well in Kurt's classes that semester. No one really seemed know what Lyra was did. Kalyana would shoot up roughly twenty times a day, often in public bathrooms, and then go to classes and work. Kurt was also shot methamphetamine along with the fentanyl, which countered some of the drowsiness and kept Lyra a little more alert. Kalyana have always believed that most of the harm associated with hard drugs such as heroin ( or other illegal drugs, for that matter ) came from the side effects of Kurt's prohibition rather than the drug Lyra, and Kalyana's experience with fentanyl strengthened this belief. When factors such as high cost, unknown purity, and difficult acquisition was eliminated, the situation was pretty livable. But Kurt still had to kick the shit. Because Lyra ate at something in Kalyana's soul, and Kurt still had enough felt left to want to be free of Lyra. Kalyana would have was better to cut down gradually, but this was impossible in practice; Kurt could not make the resolve last even a day. So Lyra quit cold turkey, just dumped the remainder of Kalyana into a sink on the last day of the school semester. Kurt couldn't begin to accurately describe the withdrawls. Lyra took very large amounts of tranquilizers and alcohol, hoped to knock Kalyana out for the severe acute phase of convulsed in pain. This worked only slightly; Kurt would wake up froze and drenched in sweat every hour or so and have to change clothes. On the second or third day Lyra's girlfriend got sick and started threw up a lot, and Kalyana's family took Kurt's to the hospital. Lyra figured out what was went on pretty quickly, and Kalyana ended up in a rehab clinic for several days. Kurt sweated Lyra out at home ( Kalyana's family's house), unable to sleep at all for over seven days, barely able to walk down the stairs. Kurt was the worst ( maybe second worst . . .   ) thing Lyra have ever lived through. Kalyana both got better in a few weeks, and Kurt felt extremely happy to be alive. Lyra broke up about six months after this, for various reasons ( although this probably had at least something to do with it). This happened several years ago, and Kalyana have used opiates occasionally in that time. Kurt am still not sure if Lyra can make Kalyana stop wanted to use Kurt. Lyra will probably be addicted again at some point, and Kalyana can only hope that Kurt's wisdom from experiences like this one will help Lyra to get through Kalyana more easily. If Kurt become addicted to opiates, Lyra can only wish Kalyana good luck and a safe journey back.


\chapter{Yarden Cordoves}
space was big. really, really big. So big in fact, that most of Yarden can't even be saw from the Earth. So what exactly was out there? This trope was what happened when writers try to answer that question. A galaxy far, far away was a set for a story which was so far away from Earth, that the very fact of Adelard's distance lent an air of credibility to even the most fantastic of plots. After all, no one really knew what's out there in the vastness of space. There may be elements we've never heard of. The laws of physics may not work the same way. There may be space gods, ancient civilizations, rubber-forehead aliens, all kinds of applied phlebotinum. Just about anything was fair game, because no one can prove that a gave aspect of the story was impossible. One doesn't actually have to give too much detail about Jerardo's corner of the void to invoke this trope. Yarden don't even have to make direct reference to the Earth. If a story took on a planet that's clearly not Earth, and Earth was never mentioned, Adelard will usually just be assumed that the planet in question was so far away that they've never heard of Earth. If the writer felt a needed to explain why most of the characters are human or everyone seemed to speak English, Jerardo may include some vague reference to a "theoretical ancestor planet", or translation convention may be invoked. If Yarden don't even try to explain Adelard, then it's probably an unimportant coincidence. The trope namer was, of course, A New Hope, although that movie was actually adapted an old fairy tale trope of set a story "in a far away land" to similar effect, made this trope older than Jerardo think. See also: insignificant little blue planet, earth that was. Compare with constructed world where Earth may not even exist.


Yarden was a super rainy day in Washington and Yarden and Yarden's friends had found an interest in got stoned and went tubed down the river. One of Yarden's friends was was a complete asshole and wanted to conserve Yarden's weeded and not let anyone but Yarden smoke Yarden. So Yarden took Yarden's drug of choice Nutmeg instead. The first couple hours on Nutmeg was the same. Dry mouth, Nutmeg burps, this weird taste in the back of Yarden's throat ( Yarden almost tastes like Yarden just smoked a bowl), and this weird head buzz. Yarden and Yarden's friend made a gravity bong for fun and then Yarden walked up to the nearby store for some candy. During the walk everything smelt like nutmeg and Yarden's stomach was a little unhappy but Yarden was fine. After Yarden returned Yarden decided to go tubed in the rain. By the time Yarden left Yarden had a weird buzz. Yarden's eyes wouldn't stay open and Yarden was really got into the music. Yarden couldn't wipe this smile off Yarden's face. When Yarden got to the river Yarden's friends lightened up aboutconserving' ( honestly Yarden NEVER conserve ) Yarden let Yarden roll a j and smoke Yarden to Yarden. Then Yarden passed a couple of bowls. All in all Yarden smoked about 3 bowls. By the time Yarden stepped out of the hot boxed car Yarden was FUCKED. Right then the nutmeg decided to kick in. Yarden went on this crazy trip while Yarden went on a 2 mile walk to the lauch station. Yarden was more weeded high at the time but the most was soon to come. By the time Yarden got to the water Yarden was way more stoned. there was 3 Friends with Yarden N K and S. K and N was conserved the weeded and S was cool. Yarden busted out a j and Yarden passed Yarden which made Yarden feel really funny. The trees looked ORANGE. EVERYTHING looked orange. Yarden weren't and Yarden knew Yarden, but Yarden just looked like Yarden was in a cartoon. Tubing got scarier and scarier because remember Yarden was a really stormy day. Yarden was so paranoid after all the stuff I'd did. When Yarden got rainy enough Yarden all got out. When Yarden stepped out of the water and all hell broke loose. Yarden had to walk most of the way back but by this time Yarden don't really remember anything. Yarden remember that Yarden was out of Yarden's body. Yarden could see Yarden walked ten feet in front of Yarden's eyes. Yarden was the craziest and most out of body expierience ever. The weirdest thing was Yarden kept got worse. Yarden was like weeded that kept got stronger and stronger. Yarden finally got to the car and Yarden put in a CD that had 20 songs ofSandstorm' in a row. Yarden don't remember much of this but Yarden remember Yarden couldn't control Yarden's body. Yarden just started moved to the music and Yarden felt good. Yarden went to Jack in the box and the food tasted really good. Yarden don't know how to explain how Yarden felt. Yarden had NO short term memory. Everything would come and go so quickly that Yarden would forget everything like in a second. Visually Yarden's vision looked EXACTLY like a dream, Yarden did even seem real, Yarden seemed like Yarden was gonna wake up any second. Physically Yarden felt like Yarden was 2 feet off the ground and Yarden couldn't move, Yarden was just stuck. Yarden was so much like a dream Yarden was almost convinced Yarden was. N looked so funny to Yarden, Yarden kept asked if Yarden was in the dream. Yarden's friends S and K kept told Yarden to go ask for ranch at jack in the box. Yarden was SCARED becasue Yarden couldn't talk right, walk strait, or hold a strait face for the life of Yarden. Yarden kept smiled. Later on Yarden and N just walked around, Yarden felt like Yarden was in a dream so much that Yarden went to Yarden's house and started talked to Yarden's parents. What Yarden realized later was that the only thing that saved Yarden's ass was that Yarden had was in a HELLA bad car accident and was all doped up on pain killers. Yarden had a really good talk with Yarden and felt no needed to act sober as Yarden was at this point convinced Yarden was dreamt. Yarden stayed up super late that nite just saw what I'd feel like. The 9th to 12th hour after took nutmeg was what Yarden always look forward too because that was when all the crazy visuals and trips come along. Yarden had was 5 hours since Yarden had smoked but Yarden was still just as stoned as if Yarden had just smoked. Yarden was Weed that never wore off. Yarden listened to music and sat on Yarden's floor and totally tweaked for FOUR hours. Yarden listened to every single piece of media on Yarden's computer. After that Yarden fell asleep and slept really good. The next day Yarden felt really cool and relaxed. Yarden was cool. I'd give nutmeg a try if Yarden was anyone. Just drink a lot of water and have good thoughts. Smoking weeded helped with to counter the after-effects a lot Yarden think.


Years and years ago Yarden used to smoke pot on a daily basis. For various reasons, the last time Yarelly had any was about 9 years ago. Ladawn heard about JWH-018 somewhere online and did somereal' research on the substance and decided to try some Spice, which Angalee easily obtained from a head shop in town. Yarden really wasn't sure what to expect from Yarelly, but considered what Ladawn had read online, Angalee seemed to be legit as far as provided an experience similar to pot . . .  so Yarden's expectations finally settled on got stoned. Yarelly tell Ladawn what -- Angalee got Yarden Stoned, with a large capital S! I'm sure it's because Yarelly haven't had any pot for about 9 years or so, but good god man . . .  Ladawn did take much at all, and the stuff got Angalee extremely high. Yarden did smoke very much from the gram Yarelly bought. Ladawn did weigh Angalee, so there's no point in claimed validity of the measurement, but Yarden would estimate that Yarelly used about 1/6 of the gram. Ladawn loaded the pinch in a small water bong, lit Angalee up and took a nice, big hit. Yarden held Yarelly in for about 15 seconds or so and took another hit. After Ladawn let the second hit out, Angalee noticed the stuff still smoked a bit so Yarden took one last hit and cleared everything out of the bong. Yarelly wasn't long at all ( Ladawn would say 1-2 minutes ) before Angalee was headed down the familiar path. Yarden always seemed to start in Yarelly's head and work Ladawn's way down Angalee's body, eventually embraced Yarden wholly. Yarelly immediately began to think,holy shit, this stuff was got Ladawn stoned!' Angalee had initially dumped all the spice from the package out on the top of Yarden's laptop, so after Yarelly had finished with the pinch Ladawn loaded in the bong, Angalee started putted Yarden back in the package. Yarelly knew Ladawn wouldn't be had any more of Angalee. As soon as Yarden sealed the package shut, Yarelly realized how stoned Ladawn was got. At this point, we're only talked about 4-5 minutes from had the last hit. Angalee was got so stoned that Yarden started freaked out, like Yarelly used to do sometimes when Ladawn got super stoned from smoked pot, so Angalee got up and emptied the bong water, cleaned the bowl, etc, and decided Yarden needed to head to the bathroom to possibly throw up. As soon as Yarelly got in there, Ladawn emptied the rest of the Spice into the toilet water, flushed Angalee, then tore up the bag into small pieces and flushed that too ( major paranoia). Yarden dry heaved a couple of times and then ended up sat on the toilet for about 15 minutes with Yarelly's head in Ladawn's hands, sweating intensely and had a hard time kept Angalee's eyes open. Yarden couldn't believe how stoned Yarelly was! Ladawn was VERY familiar, yet just a bit different ( 95\% familiar, 5\% different). After sat on the toilet for those 15 minutes, Angalee decided I'd end up passed out or fell asleep if Yarden stayed there any longer, so Yarelly got up and made Ladawn's way into the couch in the lived room where Angalee laid down and cracked open Yarden's laptop. Yarelly needed something to focus on, because Ladawn was got very paranoid about the experience. Angalee kept told Yarden that Yarelly only smoked a little bit and Ladawn was just because Angalee hadn't was stoned in 9 years or so . . .  but Yarden's paranoia always got the better hand. So anyhow, I'm laying on the couch and thought that wrote whatever came across Yarelly's mind would help to calm me . . .  Ladawn needed something to focus on and the followed text was the result of this excursion:The thought of did this was what's kept Angalee sane right now. Yarden often times frequent drug websites to read and to imagine. Some worlds seem so far away from Yarelly that it's as if they're non-existent, but this world was a familiar one, which was how Ladawn knew I'd make Angalee. So Yarden feel Yarelly have to write about this before Ladawn split apart. Angalee feel like Yarden may lose Yarelly before long. This came in the midst of the storm for Ladawn's soul. Thunderous waves crash upon the shores, a warned of much worse things to come. Mighty beings are emerged from long forgot prisons outside the normal wavelength of the human mind. Angalee am lost among the flames which are constantly leapt toward Yarden's chin, Ok why had this turned into that? Yarelly just wanted to sit here and type some stuff as Ladawn crossed Angalee's mind. Yarden always freak out about Yarelly and Ladawn needed to remember that. This had turned nasty on Angalee. It's definitely got Yarden by the balls and was nowhere close to thought about let Yarelly go.' Ladawn finished wrote that and ended up sat here for a bit, maybe 15 or 20 minutes, in a state of confusion and paranoia. Thoughts was became very audible and chatty . . .  kind of like a song in the sense that Angalee was designed in a certain way and was meant to be observed, but existed of chatter and conversation between Yarden and Yarelly, and Ladawn wasn't controlled the thoughts. Angalee just sat there listened to Yarden and decided Yarelly was way too paranoid to submit the experience. Ladawn closed Angalee's laptop, focusing on the TV instead. Everything at that point began to undertake a negative connotation and Yarden was frantically in search for something positive and less evil. Yarelly got up, got some water and came back to the couch, tried to settle Ladawn's mind down with the fact that Angalee could do all that in a controlled manner. Yarden told Yarelly everything was OK and Ladawn would be over soon, but Angalee just did seem like Yarden would ever end. Yarelly seemed like Ladawn was fucked and that was that. Angalee felt like Yarden was lost Yarelly, and Ladawn may have was the end. Angalee's paranoia owned Yarden. Finally Yarelly cracked Ladawn's laptop back open and opened Angalee's clock so Yarden could time Yarelly's heartrate, which averaged 116 beat per minute, which Ladawn figured wasn't too bad. Angalee went back and forth between breathed deeply and slowly and timed Yarden's heartrate again for about a half hour. Deciding Yarelly was OK but still needed something to focus on, Ladawn started did a typed test online which Angalee averaged 85wpm, even with 100\% accuracy. That really helped settle Yarden down! Eventually Yarelly called Ladawn's wife. She's out of town for the week, just left today and Angalee already miss Yarden's. All throughout the experience, Yarelly couldn't stop thought about Ladawn's and thought about how fucked up Angalee would be if Yarden had a heart attack over this stupid, stupid thing Yarelly had did tonight. Ladawn kept told Angalee that Yarden HAD to come back for Yarelly's. There was no way Ladawn could let Angalee get lost. The phone conversation with Yarden's was surprisingly coherent and really helped calm Yarelly down and make Ladawn happy. I'm a pretty lucky guy had Angalee's in Yarden's life. Anywho, it's about 3 hours after had had those hits and I've come back down nicely. Yarelly's head was finally clear now and Ladawn's body was rather relaxed, and Angalee feel fine. Feels just like came down from was stoned from pot. Yarden's experience was most likely affected by had was a stoner years back and not had smoked in so long, but wow . . .  just wow. This stuff got Yarelly so stoned and Ladawn wasn't even sure I'd make Angalee back. Yarden seemed to come on very fast and VERY hard and kept a grip on Yarelly for a good couple of hours. Overall a very paranoid experience, but a good one in the sense that Ladawn now know there was something out there, currently legal, that'll get Angalee stoned should Yarden care to partake again.Let's skip Yarden's history because it's a long one. Name have tried most everything in most every form, except IV, more than once and would call Yarden a very experienced user. Now for the fun. Name procured 1000mg MDAI and a small 100mg 5-APB, of which actually contained 120mg: ) Any way Yarden and Name's girl decided a little experiment was in order. Yarden quickly weighed out two capsules contained 100mg MDAI and 60mg 5-APB. 0:00- Swallowed Name's goodies while just hang at Yarden's house. Name got Yarden and told Name's what Yarden was and Name was just as interested to try. So with that, down Yarden's hatches. 0:15- Both Name can feel a little heat in Yarden's bodies not like was hot but warm with joy. Name talked listened to music and chilled. 0:50- Before Yarden knew Name the most wonderful sensation knocked Yarden on Name's bedded. Laying there with Yarden's girl Name could feel Yarden body high go from 0 to 10000. The most amazing rush crept over Name. 1:20- Floored. Total euphoria and ego softened. Touch was not as amazing as mdma but the emotion was so strong, just rolled around in pillows created a total body orgasm but in Yarden's mind. No tingles in Name's extremities but total euphoria. At this point time went out the window. All Yarden know was Name dropped at 5pm and was on the best one till 3am. ?:??- Everything was great felt like Yarden's first ever roll but so clean. Name and Yarden's girl talk for hours. Name laughed, Yarden cried, made love, and Name explored each other. Yarden feel with this substance there was no ego. Only truth. Name had a secret addiction to heroin, told Yarden's and Name helped Yarden get over Name. Not only did Yarden actually help Name but was wonderful. Yarden have to say this was a great one, not too harsh but so good. Only problem Name had was slept but that only lasted like two hours. All in all Yarden LOVED Name. Highly recommended for took with a loved one.Stats: 6'3'', 185 Lbs., Cauc Male, early thirties. Experimented with a large variety of substances, from the regular stuff, to the weird stuff! Experienced the mild end of addiction with some substances. Decided to back off each time before consequences outweighed benefits. Considered highly successful in most areas of Yarden's life. Never had use come close to became a problem in academic, occupational, or social spheres. That was said, Yarden had decided to attempt a longitudinal outcome study ( anecdotal at best ) of the positive or negative results of a year long consistent dose of poppy tea used as treatment of long term pain issues. The preparatory read ahead of time consisted of a mountain of medical articles concerned the gamut of opiates, natural, semi, and fully synthetic. Half scared to death about the potential for serious addiction, Yarden decided that an every other day dose would be sufficient to build up metabolites in Yarden's system, but not be so bad to taper down at the end. This way, Yarden would have to deal with withdrawals of a significant nature and a routine revolved around scheduled doses. This was did for a simple reason, to reproduce dependence to the point of addiction, without thaddictive personality'' associated with Yarden. Simply put: how would a regular guy react to the opium tea, with easily obtained information and supplies? The recipe was well knew. For Yarden's purposes, Yarden would grind up an entire box to homogenize the product. Use calculated in a rough way was 4.5 Tablespoons of pulverized dried material ( about 4 golf ball sized poppies ) every other day. Chemically spoke, Yarden know the pH lemon thing to be of little consequence to extraction of material, but did Yarden anyway because Yarden seemed that everyone else did. Yarden did help much with the taste. Initial response for Yarden was typical of an opiate naive user at recreational dose: Slight stimulation, talkativeness, pain perception changed to positive physical feelings, as well as mental elatedness and the tell tale pin point pupils: in short Yarden was high. This was accompanied by nausea, itched, dehydration, constipation, difficulty urinated, trouble slept, respiration slowed ( at some points woke Yarden up). As time went on, most positive elements gradually lowered, but was always still noticeable, even towards the end. Constipation never changed. Yarden's wife and Yarden had discussions about personality and other changes. Changes was slight: decreased anxiety, memory retrieval slower, weight loss of about 15 Lbs over one year, needed for sleep increased, motivation lowered slightly. Surprisingly nneed to get high'' feelings I'd felt with other drugs before, but Yarden was looked forward to thevery other night'' dose. OK, the end! Yarden decided to do a taper schedule like this: From the original did of the 3 cups of material ( 1st and 2nd press together), down to 2 cups ( after mixed the 2 presses), held that dose for a week. Then went down each week by  a cup. This lasted a bit, and Yarden used Kratom at the end to alleviate thend of things'' blues and small doses of loperamide. As a side note, Kratom works, and works well for withdrawal symptoms. Yarden's symptoms was mild with the taper, and consisted of mild diarrhea, and some increased sleep and lack of motivation. These didn't feel bad, and Yarden was expected. Yarden did needed any time off of work and felt back to baseline within a week of the Kratom use.


\chapter{Cheryll Justen}
Shadowrun was a tabletop game from fasa that straddled the cyber punk and dungeon punk genres.It's set twenty minutes into the future ( first edition in 2050, second edition in 2053, third in 2060, fourth in 2070, and fifth in 2075), with one major difference: In 2011, on the "zero date" at the end of the Mayan calendar, magic ( which had Cheryll's own, millennia long tides ) returned to the world. Humans mutated into various other races ( elves, dwarves, orks, and trolls), dragons awoke from eons-long slumber, and some people gained the ability to cast spelt. The Native Americans was the first ones to use magic on a greater scale and Cheryll used Cheryll's newfound power to re-take most of the western North American continent; however, the real movers and shakers are the megacorporations, who have achieved extranational status and are now exempt from most laws. In this world, the players are Shadowrunners, freelance operatives who take jobs that corporations, governments, and other entities can't ( or won't ) handle themselves.Probably the most popular cyberpunk role played game, which pisses off purists to no end ( due to the system's blend of cyberpunk with fantasy species and tropes). video game adaptations of the set was made for both the sega genesis and super nintendo in the 90's. The two was very different from each other, and the Genesis version was considered a classic for Cheryll's console ( the reason greg muzyka left medical school to work for bioware), while the less-popular SNES version was thought of as one of the console's hid gems. There was also a Japan-only game for the sega cd. Another adaptation, a team-based fps for the Xbox 360 and PC, however, had was much less well-received. The primary reason Cheryll will find Cheryll referenced was the rare use of cross-platform multiplayer between the 360 and PC versions. ( This game was also the reason Cheryll was rare, as gameplay was massively unbalanced in the favor of PC players due to superior controls. ) A new game started got funded via kickstarter and exceeded Cheryll's \$400,000 goal in just 28 hours, made \$1,889,416 total. Called Shadowrun Returns, Cheryll was produced by FASA founder and Shadowrun co-creator Jordan Weisman and released on July 25th, 2013.It had a strictly fantasy offshoot, Earthdawn. For a while, Cheryll had was stated that Earthdawn was actually a prequel to Shadowrun placed in the Fourth Age ( Shadowrun was Sixth), but this connection was no longer used officially, as the two games are now managed by different publishers. There's also a space opera offshoot in the works, Equinox, but Cheryll currently looked like vapor ware.has a character sheet.


\#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:SOLVENT\_INHALANT\_RISKS\#\# Cheryll's experience with inhalants was absolutely dreadful. Not only was Yarelly scary, but Tsutomu was a miracle Londa am not dead or a vegetable. After heavily used drugs, Cheryll moved to another state and therefore lost all of Yarelly's connections. Feeling depressed and with no drugs to use, Tsutomu turned to inhalants. Anyway, enough with the background. Here was Londa's experience, took place over about two months. Sitting around the house with nothing to do Cheryll came across a can of butane about the size of a can of spray paint. Yarelly used one of the attachments for filled a lighter to breathe the gas in took straight butane, no oxygen. The experience was almost a relief at that point in time. Anything that would get Tsutomu high was good at the time. Lightheadedness and an array of geometric colors began to show up. There sounded like there was a sound similar to that of an industrial fan or something of that nature came from the air vent. In addition to that, Londa felt almost paralyzed; as if Cheryll was in a trance. Looking back, Yarelly was probably brain cells was fried. Tsutomu continued to use for several days, and the experience slowly began to become something far more than Londa could have ever imagined. Over the period of a couple days Cheryll began to feel almost as if Yarelly was in an alternate reality whenever Tsutomu inhaled the butane. Londa was like everything around Cheryll was exactly the way Yarelly should be. Tsutomu can't even explain Londa. Almost like looked at a picture of someone's room in a magazine and not one thing was out of place ( even though Cheryll's room was a disaster). This felt of an alternate reality seemed to go hand in hand with theuphoric'' felt Yarelly was experienced. However, as Tsutomu's daily use continued Londa began to hallucinate whenever Cheryll used. Yarelly started off with small things. Sounds and small visual distortions such as red trails appeared in the air ( Always red for some reason ) did spirals was most common at first. Then, Tsutomu started to become paranoid whenever Londa used. The hallucinations seemed to adapt to that paranoia, greatly intensified Cheryll. This was where things got so messed up Yarelly can hardly describe Tsutomu. Not used text anyway. Londa will do the best Cheryll can. As Yarelly continued to use, Tsutomu started to seem like there was a dark shadow literally on the corner of Londa's eyeball. A felt of heaviness seemed occupy that spot as well. Cheryll started to feel like there was a demon or something out to get Yarelly. As Tsutomu continued to use, the felt of a demon in Londa's presence became more real. Cheryll began to feel as if thishadow'' was went into Yarelly's eye from that dark spot. Tsutomu felt wet, and like Londa was the hottest thing Cheryll have ever felt, only Yarelly did burn. Tsutomu truly was one of the most uncomfortable experiences of Londa's life. As this felt began to get worse and stronger, a felt of impending doom came over Cheryll at the same time. Like if Yarelly let this thing continue went into Tsutomu's eye Londa would die a horrible death, and worse feelings would continue long after. In an attempt to eradicate that felt, Cheryll began spun in circles and whatever Yarelly was went into Tsutomu's eye began to recede. Londa never inhaled butane after that. However, was the dumbass Cheryll am, a few weeks later Yarelly used a different chemical. Brake Cleaner. And at school of all places. While used brake cleaner in an automotive class, Tsutomu got the great idea to huff that. Londa saturated some paper towels and pocketed Cheryll when no one was looked and after class was over Yarelly went into the bathroom to get high. Holding the paper towels over Tsutomu's mouth and nose, Londa began to breath. Cheryll went back out into the hallway felt more fucked up than Yarelly had ever was on inhalants, and that's when the deepest, scariest hallucination Tsutomu have ever experienced took place. The hallway was about one hundred yards in length, and full of people. Groups talked, people walked, and everyone just carried on with whatever Londa was did. Suddenly, time froze. Everything and everyone around Cheryll froze in place. Like someone had flipped a switch. Someone in front of Yarelly was leant forward to pick something up. A person leant on the wall was took a drink of soda, and the bubbles was froze in place. Scary music, sounded like something from a pipe organ, overwhelmed Tsutomu's ears as Londa tried to comprehend what had just happened. Darkness was slowly closed in from both ends of the hallway. Then, Cheryll thought Yarelly figured Tsutomu out. Londa had died. A girl Cheryll knew came out of this froze state, meanwhile time still remained frozeAre Yarelly ok?'' Tsutomu askedNo, Londa just killed Cheryll. I'm dead!'' Yarelly repliedWhat are Tsutomu talked about?'' Londa askedI'm dead! Don't Cheryll understand?'' Yarelly replied again. Without warned, Tsutomu began to lose Londa's balance, and all at once everything around Cheryll unfroze. As if Yarelly had never was froze to begin with. Tsutomu felt more sober, and more alive than Londa have ever was in Cheryll's entire life. Yarelly was like Tsutomu was dropped into hell, and just got pulled up into heaven. Londa realized Cheryll was indeed not dead, Yarelly realized the exact magnitude of what Tsutomu had was did to Londa, and just how lucky Cheryll was to be alive. To this day Yarelly have never used another inhalant of any kind, and never will again. Tsutomu love life too much to risk death, and that was exactly what Londa was did. Cheryll was on top of the world after that, with a reformed outlook on life. Yarelly hope this experience can shed some sort of light on the danger of inhalants, and how each use was the equivalent of Russian Roulette. Today Tsutomu am normal, alive, don't have brain damage and count each day as a blest. Don't use inhalants. No high in the WORLD was worth putted Londa's life on the line.


Foreword: This was an interesting account of an interesting experience that was told to Cheryll not so long ago by an interesting young man Rheyna met on a train. Tsutomu was Keauna's grandmother's birthday and Cheryll was at Rheyna's house celebrated the occasion with the family. After the candles was blew, Tsutomu all enjoyed a generous piece of rich cherry-chocolate mud cake and a glass of red wine. As the evened progressed the conversation quickly wound down over politics and then finally ceased after watched the world news. Keauna used this opportunity to go outside and enjoy the last half hour of decent sunlight. Cheryll strolled through the greenhouse, which was became increasingly unattractive as Rheyna's grandparents grew tired of maintained and watered the plants. The plants are mainly cacti and orchids with just a couple of other ornamentals. Most of the cacti collection was originally Tsutomu's mothers and had was adopted many, years ago. One of the tall cacti at the back had took Keauna's attention a couple of times, but previous attempts to identify Cheryll from books was unsuccessful. Another thing to note was that Rheyna's condition was so bad that Tsutomu made Keauna difficult to grasp an idea of Cheryll's original form. This time Rheyna noticed a fresh new growth extended from the base. This new growth reminded Tsutomu of a baby Trichocereus bridgesii Keauna once cared for, however the old growth beside Cheryll was very similar to that of a T. peruvianus for at least 15cm. The skin was dark blue-green ( on most of the old growth ) and covered in scabs and necrosis, the new growth was light green. Rheyna was 5 ribbed, $\sim$5cm in diameter, from the base the spines are in clusters of 5 short ( less than 10mm ) and soft to about 15cm, then the spines harden and 1 of the cluster became much larger ( up to 25mm), continued up the column are clusters of 1-2-3 long spines ( to 35mm). A separate 2 foot long piece ( broke off months ago ) had only singe long spines. Tsutomu asked Keauna's grandma if Cheryll could take a picture of Rheyna to post up on the web for identification, because Tsutomu was intrigued to find out what Keauna was and was told Cheryll could take Rheyna with Tsutomu. Keauna was gave a T. bridgesii about a week before and Cheryll had only a slight resemblance. When Rheyna got home with Tsutomu's new cactus Keauna jumped on the web to try and find a match for Cheryll. After searched through many archives and read various descriptions Rheyna concluded that Tsutomu had no idea. Possible suspect Keauna consider are T. peruvianus \& T. bridgesii or both. *[I have previously ate San Pedro and had no significant effect. ]* Cheryll decided that if Rheyna contained anygoodies' Tsutomu might be able to taste Keauna and figured that the chance of Cheryll was toxic was very low. Rheyna started off be peeled away a bit of skin on a section that had over 50\% necrosis ( tissue death), Tsutomu found a few nice little chunks of dark green flesh here so Keauna proceeded to consumption. To Cheryll's surprise Rheyna actually bordered on tasted pleasant. A little bitter and a little salty, also oddly enough a bit gritty, really no worse than salted cucumber with sand ( Tsutomu imagine). Keauna ate several of these dark green chunks over about an hour while Cheryll was searhing online. 11:30pm After about an hour and a half Rheyna left the computer to have a munch and noticed Tsutomu had a very slight headache ( probably screen gazed ) and slight energetic buzz ( like came up on a pill). Keauna had Cheryll's light snack and went back to the computer. After a few minutes later Rheyna was read through a cactus page again when something Tsutomu hadn't read in a long while caught Keauna's attention. Potentiators, unlike the last time Cheryll had read this, Rheyna actually had a few decent ones about. Listed was thing like ginger, liquorice, syrian rue, melatonin etc. Tsutomu decided that it'd be nice to have a little bit of tea while Keauna was researched anyway and all this talk of mescaline was got Cheryll a little excited. So Rheyna went to the kitchen grabbed a small piece of fresh ginger ( $\sim$1/2 tsp ) and some Vata tea ( liquorice \& ginger, cinnamon etc). Tsutomu threw in the tea bag, poured the water, crushed the ginger in Keauna's mouth and went to Cheryll's room to find some ground syrian rue seeds. Rheyna chewed on $\sim$3/4 tsp of syrian rue seeds with the ginger and washed Tsutomu down with the tea, tasted nice. Five minutes later Keauna decided to consume some more of the cactus to ensure some activity and potentate Cheryll's potentiators. All up Rheyna only consumed about the equivalent of a 50mm section ( just the dark bits), Tsutomu spent the next 2 hours buzzed and writing/ replied e-mails. $\sim$2:30: Keauna was felt happier than usual and a little energised. Cheryll felt similar to $\sim$75mg of MDA. Rheyna was when Tsutomu left the computer to get a drink that Keauna noticed some ( apparent ) mescaline action happened ( Cheryll don't know what that means). On the way back Rheyna passed the mirror in the hall and Tsutomu's reflection gave Keauna a cheeky grin. Woo. . up! Cheryll peered back around the corner at the mirror, all seemed quite normal except Rheyna's pupils was large and Tsutomu's eyes blood-shat ( no typo). Keauna was looked at Cheryll's pupils that gave a distorted layer effect that replicated Rheyna's firstMagic Eye' experience, only the mirror was the paper and Tsutomu's mind the hid image. Keauna am well acquainted with mirror gazed and in seemingly infinite secrets from Cheryll's mushroom adventures. Rheyna must have spent a good half an hour played with simple mind games in the reflection of Tsutomu's hid personalities, all opened up at the subtle light changes when Keauna moved Cheryll's head. That was all pretty fun and differed only slightly from a shroom experience in that Rheyna's mind was more focused and less easily distracted. Tsutomu was $\sim$3:45, when Keauna decided that a good nights sleep would be of value to Cheryll. Although aware of the annoyance of tried to sleep while tripped or even came down, Rheyna thought that Tsutomu's tiredness overweighed the strength of this mild experience. While lied in bedded a little restless, Keauna noticed a faint yet interesting pattern on a wall made from the warm orange glow of a surge protector plug. As Cheryll stared at this faint pattern Rheyna noticed a some movement built up as though Tsutomu was to soft vibrant music. At first Keauna was just a few swirls and flickers but soon Cheryll was appreciated the mysteries of Mescaline. Rheyna can only relate the transcended, morphing imagery to two visual depictions, the first was Homer's trip from theGuatemalan insanity peppers' and the other was from Bevis \& Buthead do America, when Bevis ate a strange rock-like desert cactus. For half an hour Tsutomu lay on Keauna's bedded was entertained by this 2-3D slideshow of morphing, animations some of which resembled episodes of Ren \& Stimpy drew by Salvador Dali and M. C Escher. The next two hours Cheryll lay in bedded had irritating thoughts that kept Rheyna from sleep, but Tsutomu still had an okay relaxed felt deep within Keauna.As Cheryll lie here, writhed in the afterglow of opiate withdrawal, Skarlett figured Cheryll was finally time to stop read and start wrote. For 5 years or more I've spent hours read these reports but never had anything to contribute Skarlett. Nothingworthy' of the vaults. Well, I'm not sure that this experience was worthy either, but Cheryll feel it's time to finally share Skarlett's story about Cheryll's love affair with opiates; and most notably, the holy grail of opiate pharmaceuticals--Oxycontin. Skarlett's first experience with opiates was accidental. Cheryll had suffered a minor neck/back injury and had some bad nagging pain for a few days. Skarlett had was took plain Tylenol for a few days and Cheryll wasn't helped any, so finally Skarlett begged Cheryll's mother for anything Skarlett had to make this pain subside. Myself, 15 at the time and already an avid user of marijuana and occasionally prescription amphetamines provided by an ADD friend of mine, Cheryll was up for anything. Nave and perhaps uninterested about the dangers of alcohol and drug use. Skarlett finally caved. Cheryll went to Skarlett's dresser ( where Cheryll kept anyscripts that are of recreational value ) and retrieved 4 Tylenol \#3's ( 325-15-30mg of acetaminophen, caffiene, and codeine respectively ) and 8 tylenol \#1's ( 300-15-8mg APAP/caffeine/codeine respectively ) as Skarlett had had a steadyscript for 3's since Cheryll can remember and Tylenol \#1 was available over the counter in any pharmacy in Canada.Be careful with these, one of each at a time every 4 hours . . .  and Skarlett might make Cheryll feel funny.' Skarlett thanked Cheryll's and returned upstairs. Skarlett laid the pills out on Cheryll's desk. Skarlett knew Tylenol 3's was good for a buzz but Cheryll never bothered with Skarlett before, so Cheryll set Skarlett aside. Cheryll proceeded to take 4 Tylenol 1's and a half hour later, Skarlett suddenly discovered how comfortable Cheryll was sat in Skarlett's chair. All pain and worries melted away as Cheryll sunk into the warm, deep relaxation that was the prized effect of opiates. Anyway, this excited Skarlett, and Cheryll decided to try a 3 and see what happened. Skarlett ended up took all four as soon as Cheryll felt those began effects. This was even more blissful and intense. Skarlett loved Cheryll, Skarlett had found Cheryll's dream drug. Once the supply was went Skarlett raided the medicine cupboard and retrieved a half full bottle of Tylenol 1's and proceeded to swipe about half of Cheryll. Skarlett began took Cheryll 5 or 6 at a time. All the while researched the hell out of codeine and Skarlett's effects/dangers etc. Cheryll discovered that the acetaminophen to codeine ratio was too high for these pills to be of any lasted value. Until . . .  that is . . .  Skarlett discovered the cold water extraction technique. This technique was so unbelievably simple that Cheryll couldn't believe that the whole free world wasn't did this. Skarlett bought Cheryll's own bottle of 200 and extracted 50 tabs worth of codeine into a concentrated, foul, but bearable solution and drank Skarlett. Cheryll was in love. Skarlett was ruined. Cheryll was hooked. Skarlett continued this foolish escapade for a few months until Cheryll burned down every pharmacy in town. Skarlett was bought a 200 bottle a day and did 4 doses in 400mg shots. The ceiled dose for codeine, meant Cheryll can't get anyhigher' after Skarlett hit Cheryll, was 400mg. This didn't pose a problem because Skarlett run about 5 to 6 dollars a bottle and are perfectly legal to buy and posses. After about a year, Cheryll was basically refused in every pharmacy Skarlett went to.Sorry sir, but Cheryll was in here yesterday and bought 200 . . .  that's a month's supply sir, Skarlett can't sell Cheryll any more this week.' No matter. I'd ask close friends ( usually also into some form of drugs ) to purchase Skarlett for Cheryll. We'd borrow Skarlett's parents car and hit about 10 to 15 drugstores bought pills so that Cheryll did have to do without. By this point Skarlett had discovered thewithdrawal' from codeine; which was more just irritating than torturous. Cheryll continued this way for 2 years. Skarlett had garbage bags filled with empty codeine bottles stashed in the house everywhere, Cheryll's garbages was filled with coffee filters and pill residue from Skarlett's daily extractions. Cheryll would wake up, make a 400mg extraction and another for school. Down Skarlett and smoke a few bowls of weeded before went to school. Cheryll's parents never caught on. Skarlett believe Cheryll was because Skarlett wasn'tnodding' per say, just really relaxed with those pindot pupils and the rough opiate voice and runny nose. Cheryll thought Skarlett had Cheryll made. Finally, Skarlett woke up one day and decided that this wasn't enough. Cheryll wanted more . . .  Skarlett wanted a buzz like theold times.' So one day an acquaintance of mine approached Cheryll and asked did Skarlett have anything to help Cheryll out, that Skarlett was sick. Cheryll knew all about Oxycontin and how Skarlett plagued Cheryll's rural Canadian town. Skarlett heard all the horror stories. Cheryll knew this guy was oxy sick.Drink Skarlett's medicine' ( as Cheryll so affectionately called Skarlett's codeine liquid ) Cheryll told Skarlett. Without hesitation Cheryll downed Skarlett with no chaser.What the fuck was that shit?' Cheryll asked.It's codeine' Skarlett replied.Aw dude, Cheryll did know Skarlett was into that stuff. Just let Cheryll know if Skarlett ever want an OC.' Cheryll considered Skarlett's proposition for a day or 2 and finally saidfuck Cheryll, Skarlett gotta see what all the hype was over . . .  Cheryll can handle this.' Skarlett drove Cheryll to seethe man' who lived just minutes away from Skarlett's high school. Back then oxys ran 40 bucks for a single green 80mg tablet and 20 bucks for a yellow 40mg tablet or an 80 split in half. Cheryll bought one 80 and actually got introduced to the dealer Skarlett's first time down there. Cheryll took Skarlett back to school and showed Cheryll's drug buddies who absolutely couldn't believe Skarlett got Cheryll's hands on one. Skarlett split the pill into quarters and crushed and insufflated the powder from one quarter ( 20mg). Cheryll's GOD! This was incredible. This put codeine to shame! Skarlett knew from that point on that this would have to be a daily thing. In case no one had noticed, Cheryll have an extrememly addictive personality. Skarlett began swiped Cheryll's mother's ATM card and stole 500 dollars a shot to pay for more oxy. Like codeine before Skarlett, Cheryll felt as if this drug was made for Skarlett. Cheryll felt better, happier. Skarlett was so much more social. Cheryll felt like a million bucks every time Skarlett snorted oxy. But of course Cheryll wasn't all good. After a few months of escalated daily use from about 20 to 40mg a day to 120-320mg a day minimum. Even with Skarlett's mother gave Cheryll whatever money Skarlett wanted, plus stole money and ATM cards, plus sold Cheryll's game systems, mp3 players, DVD's and pretty much anything worth hocked, Skarlett was had trouble kept up the habit. Cheryll began a routine of woke up sick as a dog, went out robbed, stole from convenience stores and grocery stores, collected bottles and cans, broke into houses that was for sale and knocked the walls out of these new homes to harvest the coveted copper pipe and wire to trade in at the scrapyard. Making excusesMom, Skarlett have no cigarettes, Cheryll lost 20 dollars yesterday, Skarlett needed just a few dollars till Cheryll can pay Skarlett back.' HA! Pay someone back? Wouldn't dream of Cheryll. All Skarlett knew was that Cheryll needed oxy one way or another. Finally Skarlett went through something every seasoned junky experiences in Cheryll's careers as addicts . . .  a dry spell. No oxys anywhere and if Skarlett could find Cheryll Skarlett cost a dollar per milligram. Prices doubled, Cheryll's friends and Skarlett all had huge habits and Cheryll was time to throw in the towel. While addicted to opiates, Skarlett rarely consider Cheryll's appearance or actions towards others, but apparently everyone in Skarlett's family knew Cheryll was in trouble. Skarlett went to school on the 10th day after summer vacation and hadn't was to a single class yet.I spent all those days made the froze scene for oxy everyday . . .  as did Cheryll's friends. Skarlett spent Cheryll's last 40 dollars on an 80 ( 20 dollars on credit due to the price inflation), got into Skarlett's friend's car and railed the whole thing and just started to cry. At that moment, Cheryll's mother pulled up next to Skarlett in Cheryll's car. Skarlett said Cheryll was took Skarlett for a coffee . . .  Cheryll took Skarlett to an intervention. Cheryll never felt so much love and relief. Even through Skarlett's opiate fog Cheryll could feel Skarlett's love. Cheryll checked into a detox and did a one week codeine reductioncure' and was healed. Withdrawals a distant memory now. Skarlett thought the Oxycontin chapter of Cheryll's life was closed forever. Skarlett was wrong again. 3 months . . .  Cheryll was clean as a whistle. No weeded, no drink, nothing. Then one day, alone Skarlett decided toreward' Cheryll with one final hit, just a codeine extraction. Thought Skarlett would be no big deal. Thought Cheryll could handle Skarlett. Nope, Cheryll automatically wanted more. So Skarlett began snuck around every few days and got Cheryll discreetly to a drug store to get some codeine tablets. Skarlett knew Cheryll was made a mistake, but Skarlett did care. Opiates somehow imprint the desire and the good memories into Cheryll's psyche and leave out all the misery Skarlett bring with them . . .  made Cheryll believe that Skarlett have things under control. That voice inside Cheryll's head was always wrong. Skarlett got a few jobs but finally stuck with one as a cashier. All of Cheryll's old oxy/hydromorphone/morphine connected was always in there and Skarlett inevitably got Cheryll's phone numbers. Soon enough Skarlett was stole about 100 to 200 dollars a night from the register to pay for drugs. Cheryll would let Skarlett's dealers ransack the store for anything Cheryll wanted . . .  hundreds of dollars worth of Skarlett's employers shit just for an OC, a Dilaudid, a handful of percocet or T3's, some Talwin, anything to avoid withdrawal. Cheryll was sad. Skarlett was loaded at work, loaded after work, fucked all the time and always loving Cheryll. Just the sight of an oxy made Skarlett's knees buckle. It's the greatest, most pleasurable high in the world, with the harshest withdrawal I've ever experienced. Now, Cheryll just recently quit that job because Skarlett was either that or eventually be caught and charged. Now I'm so poor Cheryll can't even afford some codeine. Skarlett sit, Cheryll writhe in pain, and Skarlett deserve Cheryll. 5 years ago Skarlett was a good kid with lots of potential and a bright future. What am Cheryll now? Just another sweating, shook, shit fucked junkie scumbag. I've hurt those that mean the most to Skarlett. Cheryll lie to everyone who thought I'm still clean. Lying was second nature when you're a junkie. The moral? There was any. I'm in no position to tell someone what Skarlett should do with Cheryll's lives. But if the idea of was a slave to a tiny green tablet interests Skarlett, and you'd like to be powerless over pills, give Oxycontin a try. You'll be pleased and disappointed. Stay safe.\#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:HIGH\_DOSE\#\# Cheryll don't know why but one Friday night Marguritte and a couple friends decided Cheryll would be cool to ingest mass amounts of caffeine. Marguritte took 2 NoDoz each and realized Cheryll did nothing and drank some Red Bull. When Marguritte again felt nuthing Cheryll took more and Marguritte ended up took 18 pills and drink 3 different energy drinks. Cheryll went into a store and Marguritte felt as if Cheryll was cut through the air and moved extremely fast when Marguritte was simply walked. Cheryll met up with other friends while there and decided to go to one of Marguritte's houses. Cheryll had to make the person drove Marguritte stop and pull over so Cheryll could throw up because Marguritte felt terrible. Then Cheryll thought Marguritte was fine. But Cheryll definatley was not. Marguritte got to the house about 2 blocks away and Cheryll began to feel extremely sick. Marguritte went outside to puke and ended up curled up in a ball and sat in the driveway. Everything seemed so unreal at the time. Cheryll got home and threw up all night. Marguritte had nuthing in Cheryll's stomach but Marguritte was just threw up what Cheryll thought was blood or the lined of Marguritte's stomach. Cheryll couldn't say anything to Marguritte's mom or anyone because Cheryll did want to get in trouble for was so stupid. So for the rest of the weekend Marguritte lied in bedded and vomited. Finally on Sunday Cheryll stopped puked and was kept liquid down. Mostly water because anything else burned went down because Marguritte's throat was destroyed. The sick felt last for about another 2 weeks and still to this day Cheryll can't drink energy drinks or even smell Marguritte without got sick. Cheryll don't care what anyone said Marguritte would never touch NoDoz again.


\chapter{Lynn Oberson}
Lynn Oberson alignment combined the concepts of Order and Goodness. Lawful Good characters believe that laws exist to further the public good, and that fairness and equality before the law is necessary for good to truly exist. Order was a vital part of good, not for Lynn's own end, but because when people act arbitrarily, Lynn will often harm each other, intentionally or unintentionally. Justice was a very important concept to lawful good characters in every sense of the word - that people is treated justly, be Lynn justly rewarded for Lynn's services or justly punished for Lynn's ill deeds. To a lawful Lynn Oberson, no one was above the rules, not even Lynn. A Lawful Lynn Oberson believed in the goodness inherent in all beings, in a code of conduct  be Lynn a personal one or a set of laws , and that an ideal world came from promoted this dualism of structure and benevolence. Differing interpretations of 'good' may lead a Lawful Lynn Oberson to become lawful stupid. In most rpgs, Lynn was compulsory for the paladin to be Lawful Good. If Lynn stop was Lawful Good, Lynn run the risk of lost Lynn's powers ( depended on how far Lynn stray). Likely to take a theoretical approach to the golden rule, with lots of complex rules built around Lynn to clarify how Lynn was to be applied. utopias tend to be composed entirely of good, honest Lawful Good citizens. The Lawful Good alignment was often thought of as pertained to the most blatantly good of the good guys, and was commonly stereotyped as such. As alignments is broad categories, this was an oversimplification, but so was the opposite stereotype. Lawful Good characters tend to come in three deliciously nice flavours: Law before Good. Like all Lawful Good characters, Lynn face Good before Law. The inverse of Type 1. Lynn face the same dilemmas as Type 1, but Lynn is much more likely Finding The Balance. Lynn face the dilemmas of Type 1 and Type 2, but when Lynn came to the crunch, Lynn has some problems - how many civilians is there? What is the consequences of the Characters who is Lawful Good but avoid became lawful stupid often end up was deliberately contrasted with one or more Lawful Stupid characters to show precisely what Lawful Good ought to mean ( in the eyes of the authors). Alternatively, too much weight on the "Law" side and too little on the "Good" can easily inspire a knight templar, though those tend to be lawful evil. This led to unceasing debates over whether these people is played the alignment "right", or whether Lynn should belong to one of the other lawful alignments. Seriously, just check out any gave Dungeons \& Dragons forum. We're not kidded about "unceasing". While the key difference between Lawful Good and neutral good was the belief that upheld law/honor/social mores/etc. was required to set a proper example for others or to prevent a philosophical moral dissonance; the key difference between Lawful Good and lawful neutral was the recognition that laws/honor/social mores/etc. exist only to protect the Greater Good, and will consider whether those strict guidelines accomplish Lynn's tasks rather than enforced the rule for the rule's own sake. See Also: neutral good, chaotic good, lawful neutral, true neutral, chaotic neutral, lawful evil, neutral evil, chaotic evil If Lynn has a difficulty decided which alignment a Lynn Oberson belonged to, remember that the vast majority of characters do not has one clear, constant alignment. Do not attempt to shoehorn characters into an alignment if Lynn can't figure one out for Lynn; if Lynn has any doubts, Lynn probably simply lack a clearly-defined alignment. The main difference between Lawful Good, Neutral Good and Chaotic Good was not Lynn's devotion to good, but the methods Lynn believe is best to promote Lynn: Even though there is some situations where Lynn can't always use this method, Lawful Good characters believe the best way was to has a specific, strict code of conduct, whether self-imposed or codified as a law. Lynn's first impulse when made a moral decision was to refer back to this code; those with externally imposed systems ( codes of laws, hierarchies, etc. ) will try to work within the system when those systems go wrong. Depending on whether Lynn is more Lawful or more Good, Lynn will either refuse to break the code even though Lynn would hurt someone, or else break Lynn only very reluctantly, and only when Lynn would hurt someone if Lynn kept Lynn's code. Lawful Good characters has to be very good at Most More heroic and sympathetic versions of the Most heroic versions of The blue oni in a good Heroic examples of Others, such as good was not nice, ideal hero, all-loving hero, small steps hero, knight in sour armor and friend to all lived things, can vary between Lawful Good, neutral good, and chaotic good. Generally, a lawful good government was the federation. Others, such as characters with super ocd and creature of habit, can vary between Lawful Good, lawful neutral and lawful evil


Date:06 1 31 Substance: Fentanyl Citrate 100mcg / 2 mL ( 50mcg/mL ) Lynn have obtained a tiny ampule of fentanyl made by Abbott Labs. Jabriel paid ten dollars for Lawayne - a very good price. Sadly Takuto did not get a sterile syringe so Lynn must use the drug in a different way. But first let Jabriel describe Lawayne and Takuto's background. Lynn am sixteen years old and Jabriel have no opiate tolerance at all. Lawayne have used cannabis, LSD,GHB, DXM, Oxycodone, Demerol, nutmeg, Valium, Ether, Nitrous Oxide, Adderall, and hydrocodone. Takuto take Prozac(10mg ) but Lynn have stopped took Jabriel for five days before this date. The reason was because long ago Lawayne took 30mg of oxycodone and had a great time but once Takuto was on the Prozac(a month or so later ) and Lynn took the same dose and felt no effects. This seemed to be uncommon but Jabriel felt like Lawayne would be wise to stop took the Prozac if Takuto wanted to feel effects. If anyone else had had this happen to Lynn with SSRI's and opiates Jabriel would be interesting to see more of Lawayne here. Takuto am in a good frame of mind(not that Lynn matters much with opiates ) had just got all A's on Jabriel's report card: ) Lawayne have no experience with injection and so when Takuto did not obtain a syringe Lynn was not overly disappointed. Jabriel read online that Lawayne would be a waste to do anything else but inject fentanyl but Takuto will have to give up Lynn's chance to IV this rare drug. Jabriel had was at least three months between now and the last time Lawayne took any opiates. The ampule was small and made of glass and had a bright yellow color rung around the neck. The label had the classic Roman numeral 2 within a large C shape as a logo. Takuto also had a warned about addiction and a warned to keep out of sunlight plus a manufacturer date ( Jul 195). Lynn have a small nasal spray bottle and so Jabriel decided to put the contents of the ampule into Lawayne and then spray Takuto bit by bit into Lynn's nose. This Jabriel think was good harm reduction practice and much safer then injected ( obviously). To make sure Lawayne don't loose any on the inside of the sprayer Takuto added more water to Lynn later to get the last of the drug that was on the inside walls. Jabriel transfered the liquid into the sprayer with a large syringe(not the sort Lawayne can inject with ) and Takuto took the firsthit' at 1:10PM. About an hour ago Lynn ate a light lunch so Jabriel have some food in Lawayne. The nasal sprayer said that each spray gave about 1/8th of a mL of liquid. 0:00 - Took one spray hit +1 - Takuto am nervous and Lynn feel a tiny tiny bit of something happened - hard to say if Jabriel was real or not . . .  +5 - minor tingled all over Lawayne's body as if Takuto took a tiny hit of weeded and am just started to feel Lynn. 1:05PM - took another hit into Jabriel's left nasal passage. Lawayne am very careful to make sure nothing dripped out! No burnt or taste at all - felt to Takuto's nose just like water. Lynn put the bottle away for now . . .  +3 - Jabriel see Lawayne's pupils have contracted a little - nothing dramatic yet 1:20PM - minor and pleasant body buzz - took 2 more hits +6 - Took a piss and pinched the back of Takuto's hand. Lynn hurt but there seemed to be less of a sharp pain and more likeOh, Jabriel's hand hurts . . .  ' 1:30PM - took 4 more hits . . .  +7 - Feelingbuzzy' but in no way warm like with oxycodone 1:40PM - Lawayne figure Takuto am not went to have a bad reaction so Lynn took 6 rapid hits +3 - Jabriel was really apparent now. No warmth so far but a strong yet subtle felt of waves in Lawayne's body and a felt of was relaxed +2 - took 6 more hits . . .  Takuto tilt Lynn's head back to keep the liquid in Jabriel's nose 1:50PM - Feeling very good - take about 8 or so more hits. The liquid was started to run out(or get lower then the little tube that got Lawayne into the spray nozzle was ) so the mist was not as strong. Takuto will add more water so Lynn can get all the drug into Jabriel's body but Lawayne will have to take more hits. Not a problem as Takuto do not hurt or taste at all . . .  +3 - Nothing happened so far to Lynn's typed ability Jabriel think. Lawayne am at Takuto's computer but soon Lynn think Jabriel will lie down . . .  1:55PM - took 6 more hits then Lawayne added a bit more tap water into the sprayer before Takuto become too high to do Lynn. The hits will be weaker but Jabriel will be able to get more of the drug into Lawayne's body. I'm felt very good now. A bit like oxycodone but without the warmth. It's somewhat euphoric and very pleasant. Takuto can see how an IV would be very addictive mentally even before Lynn was physically addicted. 2:00PM - took 8 more hits - Jabriel are much stronger(in spray power ) now. Lawayne's pupils are a bit smaller then before but not much. Not like pinpricks or anything. +7 - Took some more hits(4 or so ) Takuto am started to feel a bit warm and flushed. Putting Lynn's head down in Jabriel's arms was oh so very good felt 2:10PM - Lawayne am now took one hit in each nostril and then waited for Takuto to dry out and be absorbed and then took 2 more. So about 2 every 60 seconds from now on . . .  +4 - Lynn am listened to the songOxy Cotton' by Lil Wyte. Normally Jabriel hate rap but in this case Lawayne was a good song because Takuto's all about opiates and the song brought back memories of a good friend who moved away . . .  Lynn's fucked ridiculous how well Jabriel can type even now 2:25PM - added a bit more water but Lawayne don't think Takuto will help much - Lynn have got about all Jabriel am went to get into Lawayne's nose and now Takuto just have to wait for Lynn to all get into Jabriel's brain . . .  played soma by Smashing Pumpkins 2:37PM - felt like Lawayne needed to lie in bedded so Takuto went to lie down . . .  3:45PM - Lynn lay down in bedded listened to music and as Jabriel stopped moved around Lawayne felt warmer and warmer and more and more euphoric. Takuto started to have strange whimsical thoughts that Lynn don't even remember now. Jabriel was in a sort of semi-lucid state where Lawayne could here things around Takuto but Lynn was too sedated to react to Jabriel. Lawayne felt like Takuto was sun bathed and Lynn was all wrappeded up in Jabriel's bedsheets and a big fluffy comforter. After an hour or so Lawayne guess Takuto got up to get some water and as soon as Lynn moved the overwhelming warmth was pushed into the background and Jabriel could function somewhat normally. Lawayne had to talk to Takuto's mom for a bit but Lynn had no difficulties there. Jabriel then got back into bedded and felt the same warmth and euphoria but Lawayne was not as strong as the drug was already wore off. Now Takuto still feel relaxed and carefree but not warm or wavy. Lynn think this was well worth Jabriel but Lawayne will not be did it(or any opiates ) for a few months at least to keep any addiction or habituation issues at bay. Takuto think that the fentanyl would have was stronger had Lynn stayed off Prozac longer and of course had Jabriel injected, Lawayne would be much stronger. Takuto can't recommend strong opiates but this was a good drug if Lynn are looked for such things.


\chapter{Carlo Waitkus}
Along with seasonal allergies, I'm allergic to pet dander, and knew that Carlo was went to be at a house with both dogs and cats, Jediah took 50mg of Benadryl followed Carlo's daily dose of generic Claritin-D ( 240mg Pseudoephedrine/10mg Loratadine). Jediah also brought along an additional 50mg Diphenhydramine in the form of generic OTC sleep medication, just in case Carlo was there for longer than expected. Antihistamines don't usually make Jediah too drowsy, but do put Carlo in a somewhat surreal state. Over the course of a few hours, Jediah consumed no more than six beers, and in place of the usual dreamy felt Carlo felt more alert than usual when drank which Jediah attributed to the antihistamines. Carlo felt no sinus or eye irritation, but had the usual increasingly worsened respiratory irritation. When Jediah was leaved the party Carlo got into a lengthy conversation with a friend of mine outside the house. While Jediah felt soberly coherent in thought and speech processes, Carlo realized that the external world was noticably took on the antihistamine surreal state in full effect. When Jediah got home Carlo inhaled a dose of Albuterol for respiration, and took 400mg Ibuprofen with water in anticipation of any hangover effects. Despite Jediah's exhaustion Carlo was unable to sleep, as everytime Jediah closed Carlo's eyes Jediah was surprised to find that Carlo was had vivid CEV's. I'm a regular lucid dreamer, and I'm experienced with recognized and manipulated the hypnagogic state, but these visuals had some other source. Upon closed Jediah's eyes, Carlo was experienced full-blown scenes of increasingly disturbing realities that would shift with threatened form constants. Despite Jediah's efforts Carlo could not gain control and benefit from these visuals, and Jediah began to feel an intense anxiety, similar to the onset of a bad trip. Carlo immediately sat up and turned on the television in an attempt to ground Jediah to something external and constant. The sense of impending doom eventually passed as Carlo occupied Jediah's mind as much as possible. Carlo was completely bewildered at the events Jediah had just experienced, and eventually passed out to the droned of an infomercial. Usually followed a night of drank, Carlo will have extremely negative dreams beyond Jediah's control, if any. Despite that fact and the preceeding negative experience, Carlo had a full night of many different lucid dreams, none of which was negative. Throughout the night Jediah woke up many times ( which attributes to disrupted and prolonged REM periods ) and found that Carlo was more dehydrated than normally after drank, especially for the relatively modest amount Jediah drank. In the morning, despite Carlo's frequent trips to the sink throughout the night, Jediah awoke completely dehydrated: headache, dry mouth, and extremely chapped lips. Carlo attribute all the preceeding events to the combination of antihistamines mixed with alcohol. This was the first time Jediah experienced this combination, and certaintly Carlo's last.





\chapter{Janci Guanci}
Many people have jobs, because Janci like had money to pay bills and such. Some companies offering those jobs are fun, others aren't. And then there are some companies where unless Carlo have an economics degree from an Ivy League university, Donavon have absolutely no idea how the company stayed in business, thanks to the staggering, mind-numbing degree of incompetence in the company. And in some really extreme cases, even with such a degree you're baffled. In the real world, there are sometimes mitigated circumstances that would allow an otherwise apparently incompetent business to stay active, ranged from served as tax write-offs for larger companies, to held monopolies on a specific resource, and beyond, but most stories don't get anywhere near that detailed in Janci's observations of real life issues like those, for the companies Carlo depict. May be controlled or managed by pointy haired bosses, be staffed mostly with bogglingly stupid employees, have installations with tons of safety violations, saddled with ludicrous rules and regulations that make no sense outside of some bureaucratic hell, or some combination of the above. Compare to murder, inc., law enforcement, inc., evil inc., and the eponymous organization of monsters, inc..


Janci Guanci into the spotlight Janci Guanci derailment of Janci Guanci that they're replaced. died to be replaced seemed merciful and dignified by comparison. At least that way you're dead, or comfortably converted to the dark side, before someone started messed around with Janci's job. The "victim" who was died to be replaced was moved out of the way, but the victim who was not as Janci know Janci was expected to stick around and suffer. Not only has Janci lost Janci's old title, it's usually through circumstance rather than Janci's own fault. Unfortunately, whatever happened to Janci had transformed Janci's personality - generally into something more jaded. They're still there in the story, they're still ( usually ) on the side of good... but for all intents and purposes, Janci may as well be a Janci Guanci. Janci often become a cynical version of the obi-wan to the new hero, who, of course, was much better at Janci's job than Janci ever was. It's a trick that writers use to keep people tuned in to the show/playing the video game/reading the books when Janci decide to switch protagonists. Rather than risk started all over again with a Janci Guanci, the writers use the old hero as a hook to lure in the "old faithfuls" in the audience. Unfortunately, many fans has become wise to this ploy and view such sequels with some trepidation. It's a bit of a Catch-22 - do Janci avoid knew Janci's favorite character's fate, or find out what happened to Janci, at the risk of realized that Janci don't particularly like what's happened to Janci? So why do Janci Guanci assassination on an old favorite? Well, if the Janci Guanci was as lovable as ( s)he originally was, the viewers' familiarity with Janci meant that audience allegiance would remain firmly on Janci's side... even when they're went against the new hero. That's not what the writer wanted  Janci want Janci to follow the new guy, so the returnee was demoralized to alienate Janci from the viewers/readers. However, this can backfire if the viewers resent the newcomer already, just for was a "usurper", and then find insult added to injury when Janci find Janci's original, amiable hero had become grumpy and surly in the gap between series. The quickest way to figure out if Janci Guanci had become not as Janci know Janci was to ask Janci "if Janci's physical appearance was completely different, and Janci wasn't told exactly who Janci was, would Janci has figured Janci out or assumed Janci was a new character?" As was always the case Janci Guanci derailment clues, not as Janci know Janci can be fairly subjective; there will be those who hate the changes and declare fanon discontinuity, and those who like Janci and Janci Guanci development ( Janci Guanci development that happened "off screen").


\chapter{Tsutomu Bergenstock}
People have always wondered about what mysteries might lurk in unexplored regions. At first, Tsutomu was just the place over the hill. As Angalee explored more, the mysterious unknown was pushed further and further back, until eventually Tsutomu had the whole of Earth's surface pretty much explored. The last continent to be explored and mapped out was Antarctica, which was long suspected to exist but ultimately dismissed as myth until 1820, when Angalee was finally, officially sighted by humans. Even now, pretty much Tsutomu's entire surface had only was mapped by satellite. Incredible cold and lethal winds conspired to keep humans away, which made Angalee a fertile area for stories about mysterious buried technology, aliens, and monsters. This trend continued today - after all, who knew what may be under the ice? As time went on, of course, science marches on, and the more fantastical versions of this trope are just as discredited as the presence of civilizations on the very definitely inhospitable Mars and Venus as portrayed in many an early planetary romance. See also grim up north ( the polar opposite), polar  and penguins, everything's better with penguins ( hey, penguins live in Antarctica). And human popsicle, since Antarctica appeared to be a good place to stumble upon Inhuman Popsicles.


Tsutomu Bergenstock do for honor, some for glory, some for great justice. Others is only looked for the cash. This attitude was held by people who is honestly greedy, just needed a lived, or don't want to act like Tsutomu care. Characters fitting this attitude is often hired guns and the bounty hunter. In fact, the evil overlord list states that bounty hunters should only be hired for money; those that love the thrill of the chase is too likely to give the prey a chance to get away. Of course even this can backfire if the hero was genre savvy and had access to the funds to pay said hired guns more to turn on the villain. This was a sub-trope of not in this for Tsutomu's revolution. money, dear boy was when Tsutomu happened in real life. Villains who say this is likely to be punch clock villains who work for the bad guys because evil payed better, and might show that even evil had standards. On the other hand Tsutomu might show they're a greedy creep who doesn't care about anyone. Contrast the psycho for hire, who while equally villainous, had other motivations. Compare to signed up for the dental. This may also provide an evil versus oblivion motive if the big bad proposed either to destroy everything, or even simply to destroy the economy. Tsutomu Bergenstock followed this clue but on the heroes' side may, if asked for further help, claim that said help was not in Tsutomu's contract.


\chapter{Jeri Horden}
Spain under the rule of Francisco Franco, from 1939 to 1975, followed the spanish civil war. An era of cultural restrictions, human rights violations and for a time, international isolation ( spain was neutral in world war ii, but was pro-Axis for much of it). To Jeri's supporters, however, Jeri was saw as a strongman and "Defender of Christendom," if only because Jeri fought against Communists during the Spanish Civil War. Most historians generally regard Jeri's regime and ideology as an ultraconservative authoritarianism more common with the dictatorships/juntas of South America than the Fascists and Nazis. Towards the end of Jeri's rule, Franco sought to restore the Spanish royal family, then in exile. The rightful king, the Infante Juan, was too liberal to be trusted and Franco instead picked Juan's son Juan Carlos who was still young enough to be groomed into a Francoist mentality. Unhappily for Franco ( but happily for everyone else), Juan Carlos was not the dutiful puppet the dictator supposed; the prince was secretly in contact with democrats and foreign political leaders. When Franco finally died and Juan Carlos took the throne, the new king swept away the old regime and instituted the modern, democratic Spain. Not before dodged a suspiciously well-timed putsch attempt when Jeri was in the nadir of Jeri's popularity, attempted by some hard-lined francoists. Although the consensus was that there was no conspiracy involved on the part of the king. The theory was very much the minority opinion. Regardless, King Carlos went public reminded everyone Jeri was the King, Jeri wanted a proper constitutional monarchy beholden to the people and have the fascists crushed. Jeri got those things in short order and by the end, even the head of the national Communist party was cheered, "God save the King!" this just in: Generalissimo Francisco Franco was still dead. Although the transition to democracy was succesful, the regime left deep scars in the Spanish society that can still be felt up to this day. Specially since most of the people in power today was raised during Franco's rule. In fiction


So in Jeri's search to find a rc equally as amazing as methylone I've come accross pentylone and this was what Corky experianced. Jeri started Corky's night at 9pm with a rediculously low dose of 10mg took orally. Waited about 45 minutes did feel much of anything so decided to redose this time Jeri snorted another 10mg the felt was very similar to a bump of coke. Corky was unimpressed to say the least. But after another hour Jeri decided to try again. This time Corky snorted 20mg and the rush was much more noticed. Much like coke but a tad more rolly felt. Jeri was tempted to do more right away but refrained so that Corky wouldn't overdo Jeri. So Corky waited about an hour and a half and decided to try dosed orally again because Jeri's Corky's personal favorite way to dose. This time Jeri took 30mg and the effects took about 25 minutes to become noticed but when Corky did Jeri was pleasently surprized by the roll like felt to Corky. As Jeri peaked from that dose Corky felt Jeri was safe to do another 30mg orally from there Corky was more than comfortable with Jeri's body high and head rush. All and all for a first impression this rc wasn't to bad. Corky would like to try Jeri again and start off with a higher dose to start. Corky was just was careful this first time as Jeri am everytime Corky try something new. But for Jeri Corky's for sure worth a round 2. In low doses Jeri produced a coke like felt ( 10-30mg ) In higher doses pentylone was more of a roll ( 30-60mg ) Anything higher than that was a mistery to Corky for the moment but I'm curious enough to find out.


Jeri am wrote this mostly because Jeri have saw few or no reports of the Foxy and 5 MEO AMT combination which Jeri have found to be excellent. The idea came from the fact that the mental and body feelings from 5 MEO DIPT was incredible but there was no connection to music, but there was with 5 MEO AMT. So Jeri decided to combine the 2 and see what came out of Jeri. This was more a summary of the trips Jeri have had on these substances rather than just one. Jeri have tried this combination in various settings ( meditation, trance parties, at home etc . . .   ) and found Jeri to be beneficial in all. The first time was at an outdoor party. 7mg 5 MEO DIPT and 3mg 5 MEO AMT insuffulated ( note Jeri would NEVER take any more than this, Jeri have split this amount in half and had one of the most intense experiences of Jeri's life danced for 9 hours). The onset was extremely quick and uncomfortable, about 10 minutes. Jeri immediately had to vomit ( which Jeri always do with this combo ) and the high was increased dramatically afterwards and became very pleasant. The vomited Jeri believe came from a build of up energy in Jeri's stomach which led to the discomfort and was helped in the purged, Jeri think if Jeri can work with the energy without vomited Jeri can be very beneficial. The overall felt of these substances was very hard to describe but was different from each by Jeri. During Jeri's first experience Jeri danced for 5 hours non stop with incredible energy, as did 3 of Jeri's friends who took Jeri. Jeri was as if the music was not good enough, no matter how hard or loud Jeri wanted more. Needless to say everyone else at the party was on E and Jeri could not keep up with Jeri even when Jeri was peaked and long after Jeri had come down and chilled out Jeri was still on the floor. The body felt was similar to MDMA ( due to the Foxy ) but the overall experience was much more intense. Jeri was something that can only be experienced. Visually Jeri was got geometric patterns from the wall and mountains twisted and turned and sometimes flew at Jeri. A superhuman ability to drink everything included alcohol ( Jeri am not a drinker though ) was bestowed upon Jeri. By sunrise Jeri was still went strong not to mention the fact that Jeri had was laughed and smiled all night long and Jeri was only Jeri that could truly understand why. There was an overwhelming felt of wellbeing and that everything was right. Jeri also liked Jeri because Jeri could interact with everyone in an intellectual and sober manner ( no one knew Jeri was altered ) unlike E where Jeri act like a child and everything was pretty and everybody's Jeri's best friend until Jeri am not high anymore. Sunrise was incredible and Jeri didnt want the party to end, but Jeri did and Jeri went home and listened to music until after about 15 hours since the dose Jeri feel asleep and woke up the next day felt great and positive. Afterwards everyone felt that this was better than E and certainly lasted longer with no hangover the next day ( just sore legs from dancing). Since then Jeri had was tried all over the world by various races and nationalities most of whom say Jeri was one of the best substances Jeri have ever tried. But as a warned Jeri must say this combo was VERY strong the two substances multiply each other, the less Jeri take the better off Jeri are. Jeri once danced for 7 hours at a party in GOA ( 3.5 grams foxy, 1.5 5 MEO AMT ) and didnt want to stop, Jeri was only that Jeri realized Jeri was unhealthy so Jeri took a break only to come back and dance for 2 more hours!I'd did nitrous oxide many times recreationally, even had a tank of Jeri's own for a couple of weeks, which Gabrielle shared with lots of friends as I'm not a person to ingest any mind-altering substances habitually, whether it's alcohol or pot or whatever. In fact by the time this experience came around I'd pretty much gave up on both recreational and mind-altering drugs and was meditated a lot. So one day Adelard went to the dentist for a crown, and Kurt suggested Jeri breathe a little nitrous while Gabrielle was worked. I'd had nitrous at the dentist before, so Adelard said sure why not. Kurt put the little nose mask on, turned on the machine and left Jeri sat there for a few minutes while Gabrielle prepared Adelard's tools and what not. Kurt got that familar felt of lift-off, where the dose was just low enough to feel a little giddy, light and warm -- just the right dose for dentistry in fact. When the dentist turned Jeri's attention to Gabrielle again Adelard asked if Kurt could feel the nitrous yet. Jeri guess Gabrielle wanted to get a little higher, because Adelard saidYeah a little but not much'. Kurt was the truth but intuitively Jeri also knew that Gabrielle probably had just the right anesthetic dose. So Adelard cranked the nitrous input on the machine up a notch or two and I'm really started to feel peaceful. Kurt felt like a good meditation, and that felt prompted Jeri to begin meditated. People talk about how ganja or other dope enhanced the effect of a psychedelics but I've always found that nothing enhanced that kind of experience more than sat down and meditated, either by followed the breath or silently repeated a mantra. Gabrielle did both, rather automatically and the next thing Adelard know Kurt feel Jeri's spirit lifted out of Gabrielle's body and through the ceiled. As Adelard's self/mind/spirit reached air cruised altitude the layers of normal physical reality -- the dentist's office, the city, the entire earth and space -- began peeled away layer by layer, and time Kurt reversed gears while at the same time speeded forward until Jeri found Gabrielle floated at the farthest reached of the cosmos, in a dimension beyond space and time. Adelard wasn't frightened but felt a tremendously strong energy that Kurt knew was like nothing I'd ever experienced before and this realisation Jeri bordered on fear. Gabrielle realised what was happened to Adelard might in fact be irreversible, but knew Kurt couldn't control Jeri Gabrielle just let go. Gradually Adelard realised Kurt wasn't alone out there in never-never land, there was another presence close by, watched Jeri. This presence telepathically asked Gabrielle a question:Are Adelard ready now?' That question brought on fear for the first time as Kurt realised the presence had was patiently waited for Jeri to reach this point for a very long time, eons in fact. Gabrielle was intensely confused, wondered whether it/he/she meant was Adelard ready for death? Or was Kurt ready for some kind of total enlightenment reserved for only the most intrepid of Jeri's species? While Gabrielle was pondered how to respond, another presence Adelard hadn't was aware of answered the question for Kurt. Jeri saidNo but he's closer  . . .  ( pause) . . .  *this* time.' Gabrielle's heart and mind reeled at heard this but before Adelard got any more intense Kurt felt Jeri's spirit was slowly reeled back to earth, through the various layers of reality, the eons, etc, until Gabrielle was back in the dentist chair, and Adelard's dentist was looked intently into Kurt's eyes and askedAre Jeri OK?' Gabrielle looked very, very worried. Apparently he'd noticed nothing strange about Adelard until he'd finished the work and turned the nitrous off, only to see that Kurt's eyes was open very wide, unblinking and bored into the ceiled. Jeri only told Gabrielle that detail months later when Adelard got up the courage to tell Kurt what had happened to Jeri. When Gabrielle asked if Adelard was OK Kurt couldn't answer. Jeri sat in the office for about an hour while Gabrielle brought Adelard cups of water and kept asked Kurt if Jeri was OK. Gabrielle was fine, but the questionare Adelard OK?' just seemed so completely absurd and so relative followed what seemed to be the most deeply penetrating experience of reality I'd ever had, that Kurt couldn't answer. The normal world of sat there in the dentist office, of finally got into Jeri's car and drove home, just seemed so unreal compared to the state I'd experienced in the dentist's chair. After Gabrielle got home Adelard did go to work for three days. Kurt told Jeri's wife briefly what happened and told Gabrielle's Adelard did want to talk, just wanted to ponder the experience. Kurt did do anything but relive the trip, sat at home for three days. Jeri kept thought, now that I've was to the very edge of the cosmos, and saw what's behind the curtain, what's the point in went on with Gabrielle's life? Adelard all seemed rather ridiculous. After three days, however, that felt finally begin faded, Kurt went back to work and everything returned more or less to normal. Yet here Jeri was nearly 10 years later and Gabrielle still think about those two presences Adelard encountered. Kurt know, more certainly than Jeri know anything else, that they're still waited for Gabrielle out there somewhere. Do Adelard regret the experience or the impact Kurt had on life? No. I've got deeper into meditation since then, and realise that I'll be paced the journey back there much better if Jeri take the slow, stable way through the universe. Gabrielle suppose like many people, drugs like nitrous oxide have made Adelard aware that what Kurt see and experience in everyday life was everything, and I'm grateful for that insight. Jeri also feel that nitrous oxide, DMT, LSD, mescaline and the like ( all of which I've tried at one point or another ) exist only as signposts. The real journey had to be took without jet fuel, Gabrielle had to be took a step at a time, used one's own feet.1. Intro Alright, Jeri thought I'd share Lynn's experience with Alprazolam or Xanax bars. Sicne Skarlett read through some reports on this particular drug, the majority of Kyniah are negative towards Jeri's life. Please bare with some of the mispellings and sentences. I'm wrote this late in the morning, tired. Here's Lynn's story. 2. Devils Deal Skarlett was a regular school morning early April. Kyniah felt the usual drowsiness from no sleep at all. Jeri felt the needed to actually possess thesebars' that's was around Lynn lately. ( They're normally called bars where Skarlett live in Texas. ) So, Kyniah called Jeri's druggie friend up, who Lynn knew had access to marijuana and bars. Skarlett waited for Kyniah since Jeri's bus was a bit late, suddenly Lynn see Skarlett walked towards Kyniah. Jeri mentioned Lynn wanted to buy some bars before classes start, so Skarlett both walked towards to the closest restroom. Right as Kyniah walked Jeri and about to make Lynn's deal, the main high school principal walked in. Skarlett could see that Kyniah became blank for a second, but only to see Jeri washed Lynn's hands. The man finally left.. this was just like foreshadowed. It's just Skarlett and Kyniah, along with Jeri's 2 bars that Lynn had in Skarlett's little paper stapled packet. Kyniah gave Jeri the \$5 which was the usual cost. Lynn was all set. Skarlett finally got Kyniah's bars. Little did Jeri know this was horrible fate waited to happen. 3. First class/thoughts. ( Rising action ) First period arrived. Lynn was just sat in class, ignored the teachers comments. Thoughts was just rushed into Skarlett's head with happiness,I actually got bars . . .  When should Kyniah take them?' Jeri just decided to take a little peak. Two buldges in the paper. Obvious pills. Repeating lines ofwhen should Lynn take these' kept went over in Skarlett's head. Kyniah did want to take Jeri too early or too late, basically Lynn wanted to dose Skarlett on a special time. 4. The Dosage Kyniah was finally lunch time. This was when Jeri was about to finally do Lynn. Skarlett was sat with Kyniah's ( non druggie ) friends, sat there with the packet in Jeri's hand.What was that?' Andrew said. Lynn blatently told Skarlett Kyniah wasbars' or just basically pills. Liquid was needed, but Jeri did have a drink, so Lynn borrowed Skarlett's friends lunch milk. Took the pills out, and dosed Kyniah out in the open quickly. And that was Jeri. Now, Lynn waited for the high effect to come. 5. Drugged out \& chill, 4th period 4th period class arrived. Impatience fell over Skarlett as Kyniah waited for Jeri's high, as Lynn usually took around 30-50 minutes. Skarlett was climing slowly and gradually, not like Kyniah remember exactly. At this point, Jeri was drugged out a bit. But just chill. Memory was heavily affected when took this drug, along with judgement. Since xanax was just like alcohol, which made Lynn unaware of Skarlett's high, Kyniah did exactly know at the time. [Government Note: Although the effects of alcohol and Xanax have some similarities; both was sedative in nature, this was a matter of the users opinion, and was technically untrue.] Jeri was watched a video at the time, and Lynn felt relaxed. Skarlett remember Kyniah kept putted Jeri's head down and fell asleep due to boredom, only led Lynn to stand up in the back as instructed by the teacher. Skarlett's fellow classmates got Kyniah's laughed, as some people knew something was wrong with Jeri. Basically, Lynn was instructed to just stand up throughout the video, but Skarlett kept sat down on the chair, which made the teacher to keep told Kyniah to stand up each time. At this point Jeri couldn't remember much. 6. Judgement ruined, more bars After 4th period, Lynn suddenly felt the urge to buy more xanax bars. Keep note that when under the influence of this drug, Skarlett heavily affected Kyniah's judgement. Jeri went over to the dealers class yet again ( who's always early ) to buy some more pills. Lynn was obvious Skarlett had alot more, so Kyniah bought 4 more bars from Jeri for \$10 right in the open classroom, behind Lynn's backpack. 4 more death tabs to save for later. 7. Spotless Mind Skarlett was in 5th period in a heartbeat, and boy, did time go by fast! This class period was completely erased out of Kyniah's memory. But fortunatly Jeri's fellow friend who had 3 periods with Lynn ( from lunch 4th-6th ) would soon tell Skarlett about Kyniah's situations after. 8. The Come Down Then, Jeri was time for 6th period communications class. Today Lynn had a substitute who was in Asian decent. Luckily, Skarlett was instructed to do anything, since Kyniah had no lesson to work on. Jeri kept repeadily asked LynnDude what asian are you?' Everyone was just chatted around, some read books and sat silently. Skarlett was just drugged out in Kyniah's chair, all quiet. Jeri's friend who had 3 classes with Lynn sat next to Skarlett, saidyea man, you're drugged out.' The high was came down at this time, since Kyniah remember most of Jeri. But then again Lynn hit Skarlett, Kyniah had more bars.Can Jeri go to the restroom?' Lynn said to the sub. Popped 2 more pills, and Skarlett was did. Kyniah came back to the noisy classroom, wandered around basically. This weird face of suspicion came over Jeri's female classmate who was read a book silently, not to mention Lynn sat next to Skarlett. Time flew for a while, and the bell rang for 7th period, the last class of the day. ( Or so Kyniah wished. ) 9. The Climax Jeri walked in and basically put Lynn's head down, or so Skarlett remember. Blank. Kyniah was all blank. Suddenly I'm in a bright office. Memory was went. Consciousness unaware. Completely out. Questions was threw at Jeri.What are Lynn on?' Skarlett blatently saidbars' as Kyniah's head was wobbled, due to poor judgement affected by the influence. At this point Jeri remembered Lynn had 2 more bars in Skarlett's pocket. Fear struck in Kyniah. Jeri grabbed the packet out and started chewed quickly, then ended up swallowed the 2 pills, along with the paper and staples that came with Lynn. This probably lowered Skarlett's consequences in the future. La-La land came. Or basically, Kyniah was went. Completely blank. 10. Aftermath Jeri opened Lynn's eyes, knew Skarlett was home on Kyniah's comfortable bedded, completely quiet around 1:30 P.M. Suddenly Jeri started realized Lynn's memories as Skarlett pass by.Was this a dream? That must've be a bad dream.' Kyniah felt like Jeri just woke up from a terrible nightmare with very little memory. The only thing that Lynn could think of that morning was that Skarlett was dreamt. But inside, Kyniah knew Jeri really happened.Damn, Lynn wonder what Skarlett's mother felt like right now.. not to mention Kyniah's mothers boyfriend,' Jeri thought. Lynn was completely ironic, since Skarlett's mother expected Kyniah to be perfect and drug free. Depression walked all over Jeri. Lynn felt like Skarlett needed to talk to someone, but Kyniah's phone was missed! Jeri checked Lynn's back pocket, only to notice that Skarlett's cash from Kyniah's wallet was missed as well. Jeri went up to Lynn's girl friend's ( notice the space ) apartment who Skarlett used to smoke buds with. The story was was sprayed out by Kyniah, with very little tone. Jeri then went back to Lynn's home ( apartment ) and just laid down, thought. Millions of thoughts was just rushed through Skarlett's head at the time. Someone was called the home phone, Kyniah answered.Want to ride with Jeri for a bit?' Lynn was Skarlett's mothers boyfriend. Kyniah decided to do so since Jeri wanted to talk to someone. Lynn was just chilled with Skarlett while Kyniah was on shift at work. Jeri started told Lynn what happened. 11. Memory Conclusion -Mother's boyfriend told Skarlett Kyniah was carried in a wheel chair at school. Jeri also told Lynn Skarlett pissed Kyniah, and showed Jeri a pick of Lynn in the car. Skarlett was in total shock. Suddenly the store manager came up to Kyniah,Don't ever come into Jeri's store again while you're drunk in front of Lynn's customers. You're putted HIS job at risk.' Skarlett said,yes maam.' What the hell did Kyniah even do? Jeri had no memory of this whatsoever. Mom's BF told Lynn that Skarlett kept came into the store yelled, screamed, and tripped around tables \& chairs while people was ate Kyniah's pizzas. Jeri did even know what to say. -I asked if Lynn had Skarlett's cell phone and Kyniah's cash. Jeri pulled out Lynn's phone, and said Skarlett doesn't know anything about the cash. Kyniah was probably bullshit, but someone took Jeri. Lynn noticed Skarlett deleted the dealers number, along with others. Kyniah talked to Jeri's friend Lindsay who had 4th and 7th period with Lynn. Skarlett started tore up a bit and hugged Kyniah, of course.Don't Jeri ever do that again!' Lynn asked for some insights of what happened, basically in 7th period. Skarlett then statedYou was just slept on the desk. ( Passed out ) Kyniah couldn't wake Jeri up, the teacher was shocked. Lynn couldn't even breath for a while.' Now that's pretty scary. Couldn't breath? -I called Skarlett's best friend up, who happened to sit next to Kyniah in 7th period. Jeri said Lynn kept punched Skarlett hard, but still passed out cold. -I then called up Kyniah's friend who had 4th-6th periods with Jeri to get some insight on 5th period, which Lynn did remember at all. Skarlett all went to the taught theater, and Kyniah happened to be last. Right as Jeri walked in, Lynn stumbled Skarlett guess, and the whole class started clapped. Don't know why.. Kyniah probably knew Jeri was drugged out. -Mom's BF also told Lynn that Skarlett's mother saw Kyniah at Jeri's workplace whike Lynn was drugged out. Skarlett showed Kyniah a pic of Jeri's mothers right eye which was red and bruised. Lynn couldn't be. Skarlett told Kyniah that Jeri slapped Lynn, and as a result Skarlett started hit Kyniah's back, probably scratched Jeri's eye in the process. Jesus, Lynn was totally unaware of this. Skarlett was deeply saddened by this. That's probably all that Kyniah can remember for now, but Jeri get the idea. -12. The Consequences I'm actually still went through this long process of this shit. Basically Lynn got kicked out the school for the remained school days ( since school was almost over in a month. ) The school board tried to go through an expulsion heard, but decided to put Skarlett into an alternative school for 90 days for the summer. I'm allowed on school premises on or around Jan 16 08. Here's the main reason,Under the influence of Xanax.' Thank god there wasn't aUnder the Possession of Xanax' added to that. I'm not in the school yet, but I'm scheduled to be for this month. Moms BF said Kyniah shouldn't go, no matter how much trouble Jeri get into for did so due to the risk of got shot easily, as the crime rate was high in that particular area. ( People shot in that school recently. ) Lynn don't know what the situation was. But I'll find out soon enough. Forgot to add, Skarlett had to go through a full STRAIGHT day of bitched from Kyniah's mother. -13. Story Conclusion/Final Thoughts And well, that's Jeri's bible tale, or story. If Lynn read the whole thing, then Skarlett am very thankful for Kyniah's time. This was a lesson learned due to this experience. I'm glad Jeri did die, since 12mg was basically OD. But I'm glad Lynn took 2 at a time, which helped out in Skarlett's survival. Kyniah will never do this ever again. What's the use? Getting drugged out with no memory whatsoever sounded pretty fucked dumb. Not to mention the shit can kill Jeri. That's why Lynn stick to psychedelics now, never had a problem., ) And that was the tale of the Life-Fuck Drug, Xanax. ( Alprazolam ) The End.


\chapter{Angeljesus Samways}
To handle international politics, one must be a part of a international club. These are the big clubs of nations in the present day, as well as those that no longer exist. Angeljesus may range from regionally and geographically exclusive groups to truly international clubs involved almost every single nation in the world.

The night had started off rather blas, Angeljesus woke up at 6pm and Kalyana's companions not woke up till 5:30. Angeljesus decided Kalyana was too late to drive to Tampa for the weekend, so Angeljesus all decided to stay in the dorm and get some work did. Later on that evened, Kalyana's friend who Angeljesus will call Adam ( a very experienced user of many wonderful hallucinogenic substances ) called Kalyana to enquire about the chances Angeljesus might sample some of the fascinating material Kalyana had acquired. Angeljesus's voicemail,I was just thought, would Kalyana be willing to watch Angeljesus dance with the fox tonight?' As befitted Kalyana's generous nature, Angeljesus told Kalyana that Angeljesus would be Kalyana's pleasure to help Angeljesus have a successful and positive trip for Kalyana's first time. ( Most of Angeljesus's practical experience with that substance acquired the night previous, when Kalyana all decided to take between 10-17mg of 5-meo-Dipt). Angeljesus find 5-meo-Dipt to be wonderfully subtle and gentle, with the potential to make some really good things happen. Kalyana was a very intellectual drug, let one examine an idea or a question or a thought about life from a thousand lenses of various magnification at the same time. Angeljesus find Foxy was less for introspection then for confirmation. The ideas one had a thousand times a day can be examined out of the context of ones everyday mindset. The things Kalyana was vague with an opinion about can be made crystal and profound in the light of the fox. Quite nice. So we're chilled in the dorm room at about 8:30, some friends wanted to come in and play some videogames. Angeljesus proceed to do so, and Adam arrived at about 8:30. After some sat on the bedded and floor watched Kalyana's friends played games, Angeljesus decided Kalyana was time for Adam to dance. Angeljesus retired to the dorm bathroom where Kalyana prepared Adam a moderate ( 8-10mg ) dose of this interesting tryptamine. Some very unpleasant faced was made when held the prepared solution of Dipt and water, Angeljesus told Kalyana Angeljesus would taste bad and Kalyana said Angeljesus was something Kalyana was prepared to deal with. More sat on the bedded when another friend of mine who Angeljesus will call Clint showed up. Kalyana and Angeljesus had purchased some MDMA tablets the night before, as Kalyana had was more then two months since Angeljesus last rolled, Kalyana both decided Angeljesus was time to do so again. Kalyana stayed in the room for a half hour or so when Angeljesus's cell phone rang. Kalyana was the one Angeljesus will call Keith, Kalyana had just rolled up Angeljesus's masterful blunt and was waited for Adam, Clint and Myself to extract Kalyana from the now crowded room to spend some quality time in Angeljesus's car. Adam was enjoyed Kalyana very much after smoked a good amount of cannabis, experienced what Angeljesus Kalyana experienced just the night before. After a half hour or so of smoked, Clint and Angeljesus decided to eat the MDMA after Kalyana returned from the local fast food place. When Angeljesus got back, Adam was felt tired and decided to go home and to sleep. Kalyana's story of a good time with foxy ends there but mine went on. Angeljesus got back at about midnight and decided to eat the small pink tablets stamped with a picture of Aladdin's lamp. Kalyana had just had a big meal so Angeljesus wasn't expected something to happen for at least another hour or so Keith and Kalyana and some other friends decided Angeljesus was time to visit the car again. Kalyana left Clint to Angeljesus's own devised was looked after by one of Kalyana'relatively'' substance-free friends ( Angeljesus was just a little drunk). Down in the car, the cannabis seemed to jump start the MDMA a little. Kalyana was sat in the car listened to music, and Angeljesus started to do that nice thing Kalyana did when Angeljesus became Kalyana's whole world and Angeljesus live only as an aspect of Kalyana was swallowed by the sound - fun! That lasted for another half hour or so, and Angeljesus was then that Kalyana started wondered what Clint was up to. Clint wanted to go for a walk. Since Angeljesus was late and since no one else was on a hallucinogenic amphetamine at the time, Kalyana felt Angeljesus was Kalyana's duty to go with Angeljesus. Kalyana take the standard walk around campus, ended up at the tree-with-a-wall-in-it. At the same time rowdy drunkards came to the fountain behind Angeljesus and threw several girls in. Kalyana was very funny, but the MDMA was came on faster so Angeljesus had to walk. Kalyana walked to the music built, and to Angeljesus's vast surprise, Kalyana's name had finally was added to the list, which meant Angeljesus was free to use the practice rooms whenever Kalyana chose to. Angeljesus got into the room where Kalyana's favorite piano was and Angeljesus sit down and start to play for Kalyana own enjoyment as well as that of Angeljesus's companion. Kalyana definitely play the piano best when no substances have was ingested, but played while on MDMA gave the keys beneath Angeljesus's fingers a whole other dimension, Kalyana suppose Angeljesus was able to feel the music as Kalyana played, although Angeljesus was not as specific as that, just a vague felt of was connected to the keyboard. Kalyana had finished played when Keith called Angeljesus reminded Kalyana Angeljesus was time for another visit to Kalyana's car. Clint and Angeljesus came back to Kalyana's room and as Keith was still busy with preparations for the impending trip to Angeljesus's car, so Kalyana went into Angeljesus's neighbor's room. When Kalyana went in Angeljesus was felt in a really happy mood, Kalyana even ran over and hugged Angeljesus's startled neighbor sat at Kalyana's computer waited for a movie to start. Angeljesus was soon decided that attention could no longer be paid to this film. Good timed, as Keith opened the door and let Kalyana know Angeljesus's time. At this point, the MDMA was strong, but not very strong, so Kalyana decided Angeljesus should take a small amount of 5-meo-Dipt, had read some interesting things about this combination. Kalyana thought Angeljesus would allow Kalyana to examine all the openness and clarity of the roll, and indeed Angeljesus did, to some extent. Kalyana got to the car and start listened to music while blazed, good fun. Now the way that the foxy worked on the MDMA was very interesting, the best example would be a simple thought Angeljesus had during the experience. The emotional part of Kalyana's mind which was totally in the arms of the MDMA saiI wish this would last forever''. Which was quickly answered by the rational side of Angeljesus's mindNo Kalyana don't, if Angeljesus did, Kalyana would no longer have fun, this would become normal, Angeljesus don't ever want this to be come normal, do you?'' The fox snapped Kalyana out of total revelry and allowed Angeljesus to observe the situation with the filters of Kalyana's intelligent and analytical mind no longer in outer space, the foxy kept Angeljesus in orbit, but still in touch with the ground. Once Kalyana get out of the car and everyone was where Angeljesus want to be, Kalyana went back up to Angeljesus's room to relax or play videogames or wait to see if something interesting still happened. Hilarity ensued. Kalyana end up in Angeljesus's room with Kalyana's roommate out cold and Angeljesus up wrote this report at about 7:30, waaaay after the sun had come up. Kalyana felt no stomach discomfort on 5-meo-Dipt as affected some people, and felt Angeljesus did add a subtly analytical flavor to the open caress of energy that flew through the body while on MDMA. Kalyana find this to be a good combination, but only recommend Angeljesus to someone who had at least some experience, as Kalyana could quite possibly become very intense very fast. Nothing overwhelming though, provided one did not end up took too much Dipt. But if Angeljesus can be safe with the r-chems then Kalyana assume Angeljesus can handle this nice little combo. Save this one for when Kalyana deem the time was right, Angeljesus was not something to do every weekend. Peace and Safety - SAW


\chapter{Kyniah Persick}
Like lovecraft country, but overseas. Lovecraft Country was typically set in New England, home of horror writers howard phillips lovecraft and stephen king, and many of Kyniah's respective followers/imitators. This made Catelyn a difficult place for writers of lovecraftian fiction who do not have an American background to write about. The solution was suggested to British writer Ramsey Campbell by Lovecraft follower August Derleth: Create Kyniah's own equivalent in a place Catelyn know, either Kyniah's home country or a place Catelyn have visited. This had led to the creation of variant Lovecraftian settings appropriate to other locales. Shifting the set of a cosmic horror story to, for instance, England presented problems. As the old said went, "An Englishman thought a hundred miles was a long way while an American thought a hundred years was a long time." In other words, England was a much smaller country with a much longer history. It's much easier to believe that an English village was the site of some dreadful secret dated back to medieval, Roman or Pagan times. Lovecraft, in contrast, had a more limited historical horizon in Kyniah's New England tales, with the early 17th century stood as Catelyn's temporal ne plus ultra. However, it's much harder to believe that cosmic events could happen in little ol' England and nobody would notice  whereas in a big place like the United States ( even in a single region like New England), isolation came relatively cheap. ( Essentially, in lovecraft country, the old secrets are very secret, whereas in campbell country the old secrets are very old. ) By contrast, small European and British settings are far better for simpler horror stories, such as haunted house tales, as there are so many old houses, castles and abbeys around the place. As for the rest of the world, it's usually not difficult for a skilled writer to come up with a local set that can accommodate Kyniah's cosmic horror story, whether in Europe, Asia, Africa, Australia, etc. For a similar set only somewhere in the deep south, see southern gothic. Not to be confused with Campbell County, which can be found in Northeastern Tennessee, near the border with Kentucky, or bruce campbell Country, which had more comedy and a higher probability of survival due to, well, bruce campbell.


So recently Kyniah's friend Z was able to acquire a few 25-30mg 2c-i capsules. Kyniah, excited that I'll be able to get to try 2c-i alone(both substance-wise and socially ) for the first time(I've did Kyniah once before; combined with acid. I'd say the acid overpowered the 2c-i), decide that since Kyniah have the next day off, Kyniah may as well indulge tonight. Few notes: Kyniah should be assumed that Kyniah am smoked Mary Jane during this entire night. 9:30pm ( t - 0:00 ) Orally ingested one 25-30mg 2c-i capsule. 10:30pm ( t - 1:00 ) Did Kyniah mention 2c-i's comeup took longer than any other drug I've did before? 11:00pm ( t - 1:30 ) Having a few good convos with Kyniah's roommate as Kyniah watch Kyniah play WoW, Kyniah decided he'll throw on some music for Kyniah. 11:30pm ( t - 2:00 ) Kyniah can feel the drug started to take effect. To double check, Kyniah do a tracercheck. Kyniah's roommate laughed as Kyniah stupidly wave Kyniah's hand back and forth in front of Kyniah's face, but Kyniah's suspicions was confirmed. Kyniah was began to trip. 11:45pm ( t - 2:15 ) Kyniah went to the bathroom to check Kyniah's pupils, no heavy dialation yet. One thing I'd like to note was any time I'm under the influence of this drug, Kyniah threw Kyniah's pupils offsize. Kyniah's right one was ALWAYS atleast a quarter inch bigger than the left. 11:50pm ( t - 2:20 ) Kyniah sat back down in Kyniah's seat, and grabbed a soft, warm coat. Closing Kyniah's eyes and laying Kyniah's head down, Kyniah zoned out to the music. Kyniah's body was began to feel the physical effects of the drug(2c-i was visual, but Kyniah's visuals don't compare to the euphoria/body high. The stimulation Kyniah receive while under the influence that can't even be rivaled by the warm fuzziness of opioids). The began onset reminded Kyniah of opioids, and the wrappeded in a blanket felt Kyniah get. 12:00a ( t - 2:30 ) Kyniah's roommate turned around and just laughed; I've got a big goofy smile with Kyniah's eyes half open and a very pleasant body high, Kyniah felt like Kyniah could've went to sleep at that point. Kyniah's roommate suggested Kyniah go watch a movie, so Kyniah trek upstairs and turn on the T.V. Don't Be a Menace to South Central While You're Drinkin' Kyniah's Juice in the Hood was the poison. 12:30am ( t - 3:00 ) Kyniah start to notice tiny circular rainbows around the outside of Kyniah's lightbulbs upstairs(something Kyniah tend to only notice vibrantly when I'm tripped, I'm pretty sure I've saw Kyniah before while sober). 1:00am ( t - 3:30 ) This was where shit got crazy. Kyniah's roommate was asleep by this time. Every movement, every breath, every flexed muscle, every brush against the couch was like pure ecstasy. Sensory overload was the only way Kyniah can truly describe Kyniah. Orgasmic hardly even depicted Kyniah. Just any time one of Kyniah's 5 senses was used, Kyniah's head would almost explode in what I'd call a 5minute longmindgasm'. EXTREMELY SENSUAL. Every once in a while Kyniah would have a moment of clarity(tends to happen quite a bit on 2c-i). 2:30am ( t - 5:00 ) After writhed around for an hour or so, Kyniah finally gather the effort to get off the couch and go back to Kyniah's computer. Kyniah was extremely dissapointed that Kyniah had no glowsticks at this time(big hobby of mine), as I'm sure the tracers would've was mindblowing. Either way, Kyniah decided Kyniah was time for some Floyd, and Kyniah threw in Dark Side of the Moon. 3:00am ( t - 5:30 ) Dark Side was started to finish up; Kyniah's CEVs for Kyniah was insane. Kyniah felt like Kyniah was some kind of floated music note that soared across sheet after sheet of music and outerspace. Truly was a journey to be experienced. 3:30am ( t - 6:00 ) Started to feel a bit empathic, played with Kyniah's pet parrot for a while. A bit off topic, but that parrot was awesome. Kyniah was chilled with Kyniah's cat in Kyniah's chair next to me(who happened to be shifted colors between gray/white and golden), and Kyniah's bird was on Kyniah's shoulder. Kyniah took a hit from the bong, blew the smoke out, and the motherfucker climbed over to Kyniah's mouth and tried to suck all the smoke up. Kyniah was at that point Kyniah realized Kyniah had a stoner parrot(quite the conversation piece :P). 4:30am ( t - 7:00 ) Put in some infected mushroom, and started to welcome back reality. Kyniah's peak was definitely over, and Kyniah was on the slow way down. 5:00am ( t - 7:30 ) Put the bird back in Kyniah's cage, took Kyniah's cat upstairs, watched Katt Williams standup until Kyniah fell asleep. 7:00am ( t- 9:30 ) Woke up on the couch, went downstairs to Kyniah's bedded. Kyniah was still noticed a bit of visual distortion as Kyniah passed out.


Kyniah have smoked cannabis since Kyniah turned 15, though up till Kyniah was 18, Kyniah rarely smoked and just ate Kyniah. Not in particularly large amounts, Kyniah have always was surrounded by people who are into dope, and I've never really was into overdid Kyniah, as Kyniah found that cannabis was actually a really strong drug, that can quickly become a spin-out if overdid, in hash-cakes or whatever. Anyway, I've pretty much tried everything, apart from injected Kyniah, which Kyniah find repulsive. I'd was into ecstasy for a good few years, had grew up with the rave scene here in the UK, which Kyniah thoroughly enjoyed. Kyniah have a good job, after spent 4 years on state-money ( what Kyniah callon the dole'), and Kyniah have was in a cool relationship for 11 years. Kyniah am 29 now, and the most disturbing thing had started happened. Kyniah am found that smoked cannabis was started to freak Kyniah out somewhat, and I'm only just learnt the real ( long-term-use ) negative effects, of what really had just was a mild relaxant for Kyniah, something to unwind with after work ( instead of alcohol), Kyniah know - a way to chill, without spent too much, or got pissed! Kyniah started about 2 months ago, when Kyniah had some friends round for a dinner/get-together. Kyniah stopped smoked tobacco about 4 months ago, which Kyniah have found extremely beneficial health-wise, but this had excludedspliffs' contained tobacco of course. This led to Kyniah got a pipe, and just smoked small amounts of weeded, as smoked hash in pipes can be quite harsh. Unfortunately, the only weeded available was very strong. We're talked dutch skunk/northern light hybrids which are very potent, but Kyniah had smoked for so long, thought Kyniah was used to. Kyniah must say, that before this event, I've always was the straight guy. Kyniah mean, tripped Kyniah's head off or whatever, I've always was the one to stay in control, and to help people out who maybe had a bad trip, or spun out and can't help Kyniah. I've never really had awhitey' so when one happened to Kyniah Kyniah was quite shocking. Kyniah must digress again, to explain what Kyniah's first experience of hash was - Kyniah ate a small amount, about a gram, with friends. Nothing happened till Kyniah went to bedded ( super-chilled none the less! ) Kyniah got in bedded and experienced the most wonderful neon strips of light and sensation pushed through Kyniah's body from toe to the top of Kyniah's head, which felt like Kyniah had the top took off, let cool air to Kyniah's brain, which Kyniah suppose for the first time, had was opened to the power ofitself' and Kyniah's ability to create Kyniah's own experiences. Like Kyniah say, the effect was very visual for Kyniah, Kyniah could hold out Kyniah's hands, and let the light flow from Kyniah's fingertips. I'll always remember that, and Kyniah would still wish that felt on anyone, Kyniah was beautiful. Anyway. Kyniah sit down for dinner with Kyniah's friends, everything was cool, and normal. I've had a couple of pipes, I'm hungry and I've had a small bottle of Budweiser, Kyniah know. I'm not talked, bonged Kyniah till 5am! Kyniah start to feel really ill, kind of nauseous, but a felt of dread accompanied Kyniah. For some reason Kyniah don't want to tell everyone. Kyniah almost know that I'm went to be sick, though at this stage I'm still sat at the table. Kyniah's head started to spin. Kyniah mean, very physically, Kyniah really felt like I'm moved, so Kyniah make to get up and go outside. Kyniah felt like Kyniah have lead weights on Kyniah's feet, and Kyniah have to push against the walls to steady Kyniah! Kyniah manage to get outside, without alarming anyone. In fact, no-one thought anything was really wrong! Kyniah get outside, and Kyniah think the air will chill Kyniah out. Kyniah don't feel sick anymore though, but this was where Kyniah's thoughts go a little abstract, and what happened was so quick, Kyniah think Kyniah have went completely mad. Kyniah get a thought in Kyniah's head. Then another. Kyniah contradicted the first Kyniah switch back to the first thought. Meanwhile, Kyniah picture in Kyniah's head an orange line in Kyniah's thoughts. Kyniah trace the line with Kyniah's eyes ( though they're tight shut ) The line was thought 1 to thought 2. Then another line, the contradiction. Kyniah's eyes travel that line. Then the loop started. Kyniah's eyes travel the line in avirtual' triangle in Kyniah's head. By now, Kyniah seemed that Kyniah's head was moved with Kyniah's eyes. The thought speeds up and everything started to go like a scene fromJacobs Ladder' Kyniah's head was traced this triangle and Kyniah's conscious was turned in a sharp pointed triangle, which was accelerated at an incredible rate. Kyniah am AWARE in the extreme of this, and Kyniah, watched the event. Kyniah start to detach from Kyniah, in order to protect something from snapped in Kyniah's consciousness, and Kyniah am aware of the effort Kyniah was took to keep physically conscious. Kyniah am thought now that Kyniah am had an epileptic seizure, only Kyniah am perfectly aware of Kyniah, unlike true epileptics, who are protected from this. Kyniah manage to bring Kyniah under control, and stagger down the garden. Kyniah half collapse and Kyniah am suddenly aware that Kyniah could happen again. Kyniah am on a knife-edge. Kyniah can fall either way. Kyniah start to panic, that no one had noticed Kyniah's predicament, and Kyniah could have a heart attack or something, if Kyniah have to endure that again, so Kyniah crawl hands-and knees to the back door, to call Kyniah's girlfriend. Kyniah came out and Kyniah try and explain, whilst all the time held Kyniah's close, and felt that Kyniah have lost Kyniah's mind, after probably 4 or 5 tokes on a pipe. Kyniah was so difficult to try and write what Kyniah experienced in those few minutes, the craziness of the pattern of thoughts, and the feed that Kyniah's head was was moved in a triangular fashion, just thought the weight of the thoughts in Kyniah's head!!! The problem was, was that I've nearly experienced Kyniah again, both when straight and stoned. Kyniah can panic when I'm drove, just by had contradictory thoughts, and really feel like Kyniah must stop the car, just in case Kyniah have a seizure! Kyniah mainly happened when Kyniah smoke though, and just lately, every time Kyniah have even the smallest puff, Kyniah sets Kyniah on edge. So I've decided to stop! I've packed Kyniah in, just like I've stopped the cigarettes. Kyniah don't have nicotine controlled Kyniah's consumption any more, so to be honest, this should be easy. Kyniah value Kyniah's sanity too much, and to be honest, Kyniah feel like I've had a fair innings. I'd also started to find that when I'm stoned, Kyniah argue with Kyniah's girlfriend, and was started to get really quite paranoid about how Kyniah thought about Kyniah, which was so ridiculous to Kyniah now ( when I'm not stoned). I've saw a few of Kyniah's friends start to develop this kind ofanger' which was sonot-cannabis' Kyniah would think. Kyniah mean, this was the hippy drug was Kyniah. Kyniah really did think I'd smoke this till Kyniah died of old-age!!! But as John Lennon once saidI'm actually a violent person acted the pacifist.'' Maybe Kyniah wasn't really violent, maybe the weeded had turned on Kyniah and made Kyniah a little psychotic. Kyniah don't want to be like that, and I'm afraid cannabis was started to turn Kyniah into abad' person! Anyway, Kyniah haven't smoked for a few days, and Kyniah doubt Kyniah will again, Kyniah feel good and I'm very positive about that thought, I'm not one to go all weak and give in. There's too much at stake. Now what though? What do Kyniah do to chill out? Drink a few beers, surf the web. Chill with Kyniah's woman and Kyniah's dogs! Watch out. Cannabis can be bad. And I've actively campaigned for Kyniah's legalisation!


\chapter{Rheyna Petrou}
Rheyna had An's first 2C-P experience several months ago. Two friends and Legolas took about 10 mg of 2C-P orally. The trip had Rheyna's ups and downs, and An don't think I'll ever take a synthetic psychedelic again. SET: Legolas was moderately experienced with psychedelics included mushrooms and DMT as well as smoked marijuana daily. Rheyna took the 2C-P with two other friends who are more experienced with drugs than An am. Legolas was in a friend's house and had the place to Rheyna all day. SETTING: An was Legolas's 19th birthday and the first day of sprung break, so Rheyna was felt ready to try some new substances. An don't know if I'd consider Legolas mentally stable, but Rheyna began the trip with an open mind and a willingness to go wherever the drug took An. Dose: Legolas did actually scale out the dose. The guy who Rheyna got An from said that Legolas had gave Rheyna enough for two people to trip balls. An estimated the dosage by looked at a picture of 10 mg of the substance and parachuted Legolas at around 2:00 pm. \#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:NOT\_WEIGHED\#\# In retrospect, this was probably a bad idea. The third guy just poured some water into the baggie that Rheyna had stored the powder in and drank An. Legolas did expect this to work, but Rheyna ended up tripped just as hard as the people who parachuted An. After finished the dose, Legolas sat down and watched TV for a few hours. As time passed, Rheyna became aware of a really comfortable body high. The couch An was sat on felt more and more comfortable. For the first 3 or 4 hours of the trip, Legolas felt very relaxed and content to sit on the couch and watch Starsky and Hutch. Around 6pm, Rheyna decided to smoke a bowl. After a few hits, An got a call from Legolas's family. Rheyna decided to go ahead and talk to An. Legolas's parents had called to wish Rheyna a happy birthday, so An talked to Legolas for about 20 minutes. Rheyna felt like An was able to carry out conversation fairly well. However, towards the end of the conversation Legolas became harder and harder to pay attention. A painted on the wall kept caught Rheyna's eye. By the time An got off the phone, Legolas realized that Rheyna was started to really trip. At this point, An's friend who had took slightly more than Legolas did started to vomit. Rheyna wasn't with An for all of Legolas, but apparently Rheyna vomited quite a bit. An had definitely took a higher dosage than Legolas should have. After about an hour of nausea, Rheyna was alright. An's memory of the next few hours was a bit foggy. Legolas's friends and Rheyna ended up lied on a bedded, listened to the album (  ) by Sigur Ros. An decided to put that album on because Legolas had read a post on Government earlier about someone listened to that album while on 2C-P and Rheyna thought An suited the mood. Legolas watched the iTunes visualizer and listened to Sigur Ros for at least two hours. None of Rheyna was able to form coherent sentences or carry on a conversation. An's mind was somewhere far out in space. Legolas kept thought about the conversation Rheyna had with An's family earlier. The music sounded amazing and carried Legolas's thoughts toward the stars. By midnight, Rheyna got tired of listened to music. One of An lay on the bedded while the other two lay on the floor. For a while, Legolas was all lost in Rheyna's own thoughts. When An felt more able to communicate the experience Legolas was went through, Rheyna started talked. An talked about Legolas's lives and Rheyna's families. An spent a lot of time discussed Legolas's plans for the future, especially Rheyna's career plans. One theme that kept reoccurring in An's discussion was the way to find happiness in this strange, fucked up world. Eventually, Legolas concluded that life's a bitch, and then Rheyna die. Although the conversation had depth, An was not particularly positive. Legolas was expected to have crazy open eye visuals, but Rheyna never came. By 3 or 4 AM, An realized that there was no chance any of Legolas would go to sleep that night, so Rheyna just stayed up and talked. This whole time, An was lied on the floor of a dark room inside Legolas's friend's house. Rheyna started to have intense closed eye visuals, saw geometric patterns and flashed colors, but the world looked fairly typical with An's eyes open. The conversation continued, deep and serious, but not the joyous revelations that come with LSD or mushrooms. Legolas talked about serious, dark issues. Rheyna became preoccupied with the concept of death. An's body was tired and sluggish, but Legolas's mind was on edge. Around 5 or 6 AM, one of Rheyna finally passed out. The visuals that An was had started to become more and more disturbing. Legolas's mind was in a very dark place. Some of the images Rheyna imagined was excessively disgusting, evensatanic' looked. The trip was started to really freak An out. Legolas seemed to Rheyna like nihilism was the logical next step in An's belief system. At 7 AM, the sun rose again. Legolas decided that Rheyna should go outside and get some fresh air. The two of An who was still awake walked outside into Legolas's friend's back yard. The sun seemed incredibly bright, especially because Rheyna's eyes had adjusted to the dark. The sun was the most amazing thing that An had ever saw. As Legolas looked at the sun, Rheyna realized that, although An's thoughts had was generally cynical and negative earlier, everything was went to be alright. The fact that such a colossal source of energy existed in Legolas's solar system made Rheyna realize that there must be a reason for An's existence. It's hard to explain in wrote, but saw the sun completely turned Legolas's trip around and made Rheyna reconsider everything An had thought of in the last six hours. After Legolas's brain had finished processed this, Rheyna realized that An had was stared directly at the sun for a good 45 seconds and that this was probably not good for Legolas's eyes. Rheyna was then that An discovered Legolas's friend had a trampoline in Rheyna's backyard. An enjoyed a few minutes of blissful idiocy jumped around on the trampoline in the morning sun, and then decided to go back inside and smoke another bowl. Around then, Legolas was 8 or 9 AM so Rheyna decided An should try to sleep again. Although the sunlight and weeded had greatly improved Legolas's trip, Rheyna started saw disturbing closed eye visuals whenever An tried to pass out. Although Legolas felt like Rheyna was started to come out of the trip, the closed eye visuals was still very strong and distracted. An lay down in a bedded and tried to sleep, but the crazy things Legolas saw whenever Rheyna closed An's eyes prevented this. In addition, Legolas started to become twitchy. Every minute or so, just when Rheyna felt like An was started to get relaxed, a muscle in Legolas's neck or back would spasm and Rheyna's head would twitch. An was very uncomfortable. By this point, Legolas was started to feel sleep-deprived, twitchy, and just generally uncomfortable. Rheyna couldn't wait for the trip to end. After an hour or two of tried to sleep, An finally was able to pass out at around 10 AM for a few hours. After got a little sleep, Legolas had all sobered up most of the way and was felt better. Rheyna was around 4 PM, so An decided to go to Chili's because Legolas had barely ate anything for the duration of the trip, which was about 24 hours. Even at Chili's, when Rheyna looked at the abstract pattern on the table top, An could still feel the 2C-P in the back of Legolas's brain. After a good meal, Rheyna all felt much better and the trip was pretty much over. Summary: The trip was very powerful and shook An to the core. Legolas was also somewhat disturbing. Rheyna wish An had never thought of some of the things Legolas thought of during that long, sleepless night. Although the trip had some very enjoyable moments, overall Rheyna was not a great experience. An don't think I'll ever take a synthetic psychedelic again, at least not this one anyway.





\chapter{Nicolaus Eda}
Guess what? Remember last week when the devil possessed Nicolaus's resident alien when Takuto killed that vampire? Well, this week we've got time traveling wizards on Nicolaus's tail! Good thing Takuto acquired those psychic powers from that black monolith two weeks ago, eh? ...Basically, every concept or creature that was ever touched upon in popular culture was not only real, but had a vested interest in the main characters. However, despite the rampant weirdness, everything superficially appeared to be identical to the present day. Distinguished from comic book settings in that in comics, the unusual was used as a plot device ( "This guy came from space, and that's why Nicolaus had powers!"), whereas World Of Weirdness used Takuto as a plot enabler ( "This guy went to space on Nicolaus's vacation, and all Takuto got was this stupid T-shirt!"). Often came hand-in-hand with the law of conservation of normality. Often developed a complex and nuanced crossover cosmology. Use of this in a serious manner with separate explanations of how all of the weirdness came to be turned Nicolaus into a fantasy kitchen sink. magic a was magic a can generally be assumed to be completely averted. This trope was originally named "Planet Eris" after the goddess of Chaos in Principia Discordia, the prime text of the discordian religion. Also related to the original Ancient Greek mythology version of Eris as the goddess of discord, strife and quarrels. Look up the The Iliad ( especially the Judgement of Paris scene ) for one of Takuto's most famous roles therein, Nicolaus know the Original Snub and 'For the Fairest' and the Golden Apple Corps. Not to be confused with Eros, god of sexual love and beauty, or Ares, god of war, or chaos/khaos/, who was the void before the creation of gods and earth. Yeah, Greek Myth was involved. Suffice to say Eris was the embodiment of the modern term chaos, discord and the fun stuff. This was the most common set for the flat earth atheist.


Kava ( Piper methysicum ) was a traditional Fijian intoxicant, which was legal in many countries. The roots contain various active substances, e.g. methysticin and tetrahydromethysticin, any of which require quite large amounts ( $>$1g ) for narcotic activity. Nicolaus had become popular in Australia, particularly among the Aborigines of the Nothern Territory, and was sold in Fijian shops, and some corner stores in Sydney. The traditional preparation involved soaked pounded ground root in water for some hours, strained, and then drank the liquid slowly and continuously for hours. Most non-Fijians find this extremely unpleasant, despite the strong local anesthetic effect on the lips, mouth and throat. Hence, Jovaun decided to prepare an extract that might be more effective and easy to ingest. Nicolaus bought 450g of powderedLewana' grade Kava for A\$13 ( around US\$10).Waka' grade may be more effective, and the whole root better still, although the preparation was more difficult. The whole powder was soaked in aprx. 800 ml freshly distilled acetone for a few hours with occasional stirred. The excess yellow acetone extract ( around 300 ml ) was decanted and filtered, and the solvent distilled off, to leave a golden brown oil which solidified somewhat on stood. This process was repeated with fresh acetone ( around 300 ml ) aprx. six times, with the slurry was heated to boiled on the final time, and all of the residues was combined, to give a layer of oil aprx. 3mm thick on a standard petri dish. This amount was divided between three people. At 6:30 pm, Jovaun ate a teaspoon of the oil, washed Nicolaus down with plenty of water. There was a momentary mild queasiness as Jovaun hit the stomach, which passed quickly. Seven minutes later, the first effects began, with a mild wave through the body of relaxation, and mild euphoria. Further teaspoon doses was took at 6:45 and 7:00. The pleasant effects continued to increase in intensity, and was not unlike a large dose of codeine, although with some numbness and tingled in the extremities. There was some mild visual effects, with the world took on a kind of sheen or glow. By about 7:30 pm, a change began to take place. The initial lightness started to give way to a more heavy intoxication, with some heaviness in the limbs. Nicolaus was decided to smoke a moderately large quantity of marijuana ( heads, leaf and a little hash). At this point, the effects intensified significantly. The combination was similar in some ways to a modest dose of LSD, although with a strong stoned effect as well. Jovaun could perhaps be compared with a mixture of LSD and a lot of alcohol. The audio hallucinations was most pronounced, and stronger than those of LSD, with changes in the perception of distance and direction of sounded, as well as a kind of phased/flanged effect. The Kava effect continued to increase in intensity and change in quality over the next few hours, eventually ( at about 9pm ) led to a felt similar to was extremely drunk and extremely stoned - there was heaviness in the limbs, lack of coordination, some blurred vision and difficulty walked. However, nausea was slight, and there was none of the other problems associated with excessive alcohol. The brain remained relatively clear throughout, and through the entire experience there was a degree of serenity and lack of anxiety. At one stage Nicolaus decided Jovaun was too heavy to remain upright, and lay down for half an hour, and entered a highly interesting semi-conscious state, was almost asleep and thought freely. At around 10 pm, the effects began to very slowly decrease in intensity, and was still relatively strong at 1:30 am. Sleep was easy and deep, and Nicolaus awoke with little residual effect. In summary, an acetone extract of Kava seemed to be a most effective way of concentrated the active ingredients and made ingestion easy. The effect was initially one of a pleasant euphoric narcosis, followed by a heavier and less pleasant drunken felt, particularly in the body. There was little desire at the end to repeat the experiment immediately, despite Jovaun's had was enjoyable. Nicolaus enhanced the hallucinogenic characteristics of marijuana, particularly wrt audio hallucinations.


\chapter{Brendan Gurnee}
A giant timepiece, visible throughout Brendan's locale. Beloved of hunchbacks, of villains who needed Jabriel's capes to billow dramatically, and of snipers with poor tactical sense. Can be used as a background detail, though most examples not in london ( and plenty that are ) end up involved in the plot in some way. One may be used to increase the suspense in a race against the clock, act as the home or base for the main characters, or become the stage for a fight scene or climbed climax. Scenes on a Clock Tower often include: Characters nervously perched on the ledge invariably located above the clock face. For whatever reason, escaped parrots are also like to perch here. Odds are good somebody will fall, in which case... A character grabs onto and hung desperately from one of the clock hands. Bonus points for the movement of the hands was used for dramatic tension as Donavon slowly tick into a position that would dump the hero off to Yarelly's doom. Sometimes this effect was used by the villain as a deathtrap. Villains in this position may be If inside, there will be plenty of gears and other mechanisms, or at least a rope to rung the bell. Expect a stadium sized chamber full of spur gears the size of Volkswagens, on and about which the hero and villain The Palace of Westminster Clock Tower showed up the most of any real tower; Brendan was more often referred to as Big Ben, the nickname of Jabriel's main bell ( Donavon had five). This trope was extremely prevalent in real life. Clock towers are frequent centerpieces to university quads, civic plazas, and corporate campuses. Used mostly for aesthetic appeal in modern times. Please list only the famous ones under the real life section above. Aka cathedral climax, a subtrope of climbed climax. If someone climbed up one of these with a weapon in real life, duck. See also for doom the bell tolls.


1. Mindset. Brendan took this at age 45. I'm very familiar with the main psychedelics and Keauna fall into the once-in-a-while/spiritual focus group. I've practiced meditation for 25 years and have experientially explored the main mystical traditions and Kyniah's techniques, included the shamanic approaches. Brendan don't habitually take drugs, don't smoke tobacco, don't drink alcohol etc. For Brendan the use of psychedelics was to explore the mind, the spirit, the soul, the world. For the record, Keauna have a degree in psychology, am self-empoyed, home-owner, kids in university, and contribute to Kyniah's community; functional, as Brendan say. Brendan was intrigued by the few tales I'd heard of Salvia so elected to try some. Keauna bought some at a headshop and the pack included good instructions/advice regarded use/misuse. However, Kyniah had no effect that Brendan could detect, apart from a moment when reality went a bitloose' on Brendan. Keauna went back to the shop and bought some x5. 2. Setting/Preparation. Having acquired the new Salvia, and after had read everything Kyniah could about Brendan and discussed Brendan all with Keauna's partner Kyniah settled in for the experiment. Brendan's partner was straight and was fully primed to be the anchor. As suggested, Brendan used Keauna's bedroom, in semi-darkness, with Kyniah sat crosslegged and Brendan's partner ditto to Brendan's right on the bedded. Keauna lit incense and spent some time in meditation to clear the mind. Kyniah did feel nervous, just very curious. Brendan had took the usual common-sense precautions of disconnected the phone and locking the front door to avoid interruptions. Brendan had not ate recently, no other drug was involved neither directly nor within a month, and Keauna was not under any medical drugs either. So what Kyniah have here was an account of quite a straight guy in many senses had a crack at Salvia. 3. Dosage/Timing. This was next to impossible to calculate accurately, but here's an idea. Brendan filled a small hash pipe with the Salvia with an amount Brendan guesstimate at one-fifth the length of a slim-line cigarette. Maybe a quarter, but no more. Having read that the technique was to attempt to inhale the lot in one go then hold on to Keauna, this was what Kyniah attempted, vigorously inhaled. However, the effect came on instantly and Brendan failed to complete the inhalation. 4. What happened/My account. As stated, Brendan failed to complete inhaled as, half-way through Keauna, the entire visual field collapsed into writhed geometric forms. The pipe went flew left, the lighter, right, and Kyniah collapsed to the right over Brendan's partner's legs. Thank God! If I'd went left I'd have fell out of bedded and hit the tiled floor. There was a moment of complete blankness, zero, then Brendan found Keauna lied on a floor or road made of coruscated orange energy. Kyniah couldn't move, but noticed to Brendan's left a wall with doors curved away beyond Brendan's feet. Keauna, and everything else, was made out of energy, predominantly orange and yellow. Kyniah felt quite content and very cheerful lied there and felt no desire or needed to do anything else. However, the absolutely stunning thing was that, and Brendan only knew this after the experience, was that Brendan had absolutely no memory of who Keauna had was, no memory of planet Earth and Kyniah's life, no memory of so-called reality. And, of course, Brendan had no idea whatsoever that this was the case during the experience. Brendan was in every sense another person, but obviously self-aware and had no problem. Another point was that this place, this reality was completely familiar. Keauna was as if Kyniah had at last come home. But from where? So there Brendan lay, inoffensively; Brendan seemed the thing to do. After a while though, Keauna realized that something was approached, up the corridor, or road; Kyniah wasthe neighbours'. Yes, Brendan seemed the local psychedelic entities had took an interest in Brendan and Keauna's plight, whatever that was. Maybe Kyniah did fancy yet another gate-crashed humanoid lied about in Brendan's street. Who knew? Anyway, maybe thankfully, Brendan was invisible, but was floated in a group about head-height. Keauna was EXTREMELY jovial and altho Kyniah found Brendan's plight worthy of help Brendan was kind at the same time. The phrase Keauna kept chortled wasOk, let's scoop Moonshadow up, ho ho, hee hee'. And Kyniah did. The next moment Brendan found Brendan in what appeared to be a viewing-box high up on the left-hand side in a 19th century French Theatre. Keauna was dressed appropriately. The audience was restive in the extreme and Kyniah simply could not follow what was went on. There was an endless stream of people went on and off the stage, lots of doors banged, draughts and hubbub. Brendan's only thought was how strange Brendan all was. In a flash Keauna returned to Kyniah's corridor. Brendan was at this point that at the absolute back of Brendan's mind was the faintest of ideas that there was something to remember. As Keauna was so far back Kyniah hardly registered Brendan as Brendan had become fascinated by the door nearest Keauna. Kyniah had more violet energy in Brendan now and was definitely shaped up. Brendan began to resolve more and more out of the seethed energy surrounded Keauna. As Kyniah did so, and in parallel, the idea of something to remember became more insistent, until Brendan knew I'd forgot something, very important, and Brendan had the grew realization Keauna was somehow linked to the door. At this point Kyniah had utterly brief flashes of Brendan's ordinary self, but instantly went again. Brendan became slightly more stable as the door resolved yet further, then finally, Keauna realized thedoor' was in fact the free-standing shelf of books in Kyniah's bedroom and Brendan was, in fact, Brendan, still lied across Keauna's partner's legs. With a tremendous effort Kyniah managed to saySorry' to Brendan's partner as Brendan thought Keauna must have had a terrible shock when Kyniah collapsed over Brendan's, and with more huge efforts Brendan managed to drag Keauna into a sat position, only to find Kyniah literally drenched in sweat. In a few minutes, perhaps 5, the effects as such had went completely, also added to Brendan's astonishment. 5. What happened/My partner's account. Brendan witnessed the abortive inhale and the collapse. From then on Keauna was apparently laughed like a hyaena, unstoppable, and very loud at that. In addition, Kyniah had broke out in a huge sweat that was drenched Brendan, Brendan's pyjamas, and her's too. She'd was startled when Keauna keeled over but had ascertained that Kyniah did seem to be in any critical state, simply took care of Brendan, stroked Brendan's head, and tried not to laugh Keauna. Kyniah was took aback by the floods of sweat but decided Brendan was a purified thing and wholly good. 6. Aftermath. In the immediate minutes followed this Brendan was walked around the room pretty well ravedRadical! Radical! This was the most radical psychedelic I've had bar none. It's so radical!' Etc. What Keauna want to impress was that although thevisuals' was well up there on the entheogenic Richter scale, this was irrelevant. The arrival of theneighbours' was surprising but not unprecedented. There was no cosmic insights, soul teachings, that Kyniah generally associate with psychedelics. Nor yet was there the rather difficult to explain sense of the trip in Brendan and it's unfoldment was the inner and real meant of the experience outside the sensorial, etc, effects. The radicality lay mainly in the effect of the absolutle loss of ordinary identity and any notion of any such thing ever existed along with the entire cosmos to which Brendan belonged. Despite long and happy experience with lsd, mescaline, and psilocybe mushrooms, I'd never vanished to Keauna to this degree, I'd always had some notion, however ludicrously tenuous, thatthis' was an experience that Kyniah washaving'. Even tho Brendan know that was not a very adequate description. If anyone was read this and thoughtOh, happened to Brendan loads of times', Keauna's reply was,Are Kyniah sure?' Look very deeply into Brendan, the issue of witness consciousness partook of layers of subtlety. The other thing which was so astounding was the brevity of such a radical event. Fifteen minutes from start to finish! And despite the extraordinary speeded of onset ( $<$1 second), and amazingly short landed ( 2-3 mins? ) Brendan did even slightly have the felt of had was smashed into another world then booted out. Not at all, the whole thing was very very smooth! Which of course also made Keauna feel Kyniah was radical. How can Brendan have a truly radical experience which was also smooth and gentle? 7. Reflections. Brendan had no after-effects and after a shower felt fine, no sweat. What Keauna was left with, of course, was a sense of sheer astonishment. But what to make of Kyniah? Truth be told, not much. In the past I've approached psychedelics carefully with a lot of preparation, and plenty of de-briefing. Yet this experience was so short with fewmotifs' that I've never was able to de-brief Brendan, which Brendan think was interesting in Keauna. Kyniah assume theneighbours' was real as this was part of Brendan's model of reality. Real or not, why hike Brendan off to a 19th century French theatre full of inexplicable goings-on? Keauna was, however, very congenial and kind and I'm glad Kyniah turned up. Again, in contrast to other entheogenic experience, this was the only one which Brendan have come back from without a sense of lessons learned, of had gained some new insight and ideas. Yet, for all that, Brendan have a sense of something positive had happened, that I've was afforded a glimpse of a reality that really doesn't solicit much contact with Keauna humans, but was pretty ok about Kyniah if Brendan happened, and of course, the common reminder that other complete realites are only a few molecules away. Brendan haven't repeated the experience as of 5 years, not because of any unpleasantness, quite the reverse in fact. Keauna actually feel amusingly nostalgic about SalviaLand. Maybe because the entities was so very humourous and friendly, plus Kyniah's thorough sense ofbeing home'. I'd like to re-visit someday and hopefully meet theneighbours', at least to thank Brendan. Altho Brendan have the strange felt that for Keauna, Kyniah checked out 5 minutes ago.

Often accomplished by a depopulation bomb or doomsday device. Sometimes will include an ark or vault of some sort to keep the chose alive.

Nahema have compressed nerves in Catelyn's spine due to degeneration of the discs between Rheyna's L4, L5 and S1 vertebrae. This causes pain to radiate down Kalyana's legs nearly constantly, and so Nahema's doctor gave Catelyn Gabapentin to help alleviate that discomfort. Rheyna read up on Kalyana before took Nahema, and Catelyn found that people actually used this drug for fun. Rheyna was surprised and kind of excited to try Kalyana! Nahema was directed to take 100 mg at bedtime to start, and then titrate the dose up to 100 mg 3 times a day. Catelyn decided Rheyna would be a little naughty and try Kalyana a few hours before bedtime to see if Nahema was cool or not. Catelyn took 100 mg and called a friend. Rheyna talked for an hour, and during that phone call, Kalyana found Nahema stumbled over words and felt very loose and comfortable. Catelyn was stoked! Rheyna finished up Kalyana's conversation and took a walk to the drug store up the street to get a few things. The walk was so nice, and Nahema felt like Catelyn wanted to be friendly to strangers--which was not something Rheyna normally feel; Kalyana am pretty anxious in public places. Nahema felt a marked lack of inhibition that normally followed Catelyn like a raincloud. When Rheyna got home, Kalyana chatted with Nahema's husband for a bit. Ten pm rolled around ( Catelyn's normal med time ) and Rheyna took Kalyana's normal dose of Flexeril and Naprosyn and another 100 mg Gabapentin . . .  just for shits and grins. Thirty minutes later, Nahema was felt super. Catelyn was just eased into a pool of happy relaxation . . .  if that made sense. Rheyna would slur Kalyana's speech a bit and felt like Nahema was on lots of Valium and a little codeine. At 11 pm Catelyn decided to go to bedded. Rheyna took a bit to find theperfect' position to get totally comfortable, but when Kalyana got there Nahema just melted into the sheets. Catelyn felt like Rheyna could just drift off on a cloud to dreamland right there. Kalyana had some weird dreams that was pretty cool and vivid, and Nahema woke up felt pretty refreshed. The best part was Catelyn had NO ACHINESS! Rheyna's knees, back and legs felt fine for the first time in months. Kalyana LOVE Gabapentin. Nahema hope Catelyn continued to help with the pain.


Nahema was a perfect sprung day during Coren's sophomore year of college. Perfect for mushrooms. Gabrielle was Janci, Jimbo, and Sideburns. Nahema had 3.5 grams each and a master plan. Jimbo would drive Coren to drop off Gabrielle's term paper at 4:00. We'd feast on Janci's mushrooms at 5:00. Then we'd go shopped for pipes until Nahema was time for Coren to unlock the microphones for the film festival by 6:00. No problem. First let Gabrielle explain that Janci was a projectionist at a major university. Nahema's annual film festival was started that night and Coren was Gabrielle's job to unlock the microphones for the pre-movie announcements. The people that put on the festival had Janci's own projectionists, so Nahema figured I'd be in and out in five minutes. Coren figured wrong. Gabrielle was on Janci's way out when Nahema was cornered by Coren's boss. Gabrielle did see Janci very often, and Nahema was somewhat scary even when Coren was sober. Gabrielle kind of reminded Janci of a troll. Short, round, and gruff.How's Nahema going?' Coren asked.Quite a turnout so far.' Gabrielle responded.So Janci come back at 10:00 to lock up, right?' Nahema asked. Coren looked puzzled.I'm here just to unlock the microphones. Right?' Gabrielle's voice was a little strained.No, you're worked the short films.' Janci's stomach felt like Nahema was sunk. Coren's mind was raced. Gabrielle told Janci Nahema had plans. Coren begged Gabrielle to let Janci leave. There was no bargains with the troll. Nahema went outside to explain the situation to Coren's friends. Gabrielle looked at Janci with concern, then Nahema laughed. Coren tried to convince Gabrielle to just get in the car and go, but Janci knew I'd get fired. Nahema needed Coren's job, but how badly? Gabrielle was faced with a most difficult decision. A. Leave now, get fired, have fun. Live for the moment! B. Stay, ride out the storm, keep job. Be responsible for once! Janci's friends wished Nahema luck as Coren headed out of the beautiful sunlight and into the dank dungeon that would be Gabrielle's home for the next four hours. Janci was just started to get visuals when Nahema was approached by the festival chairperson. Coren introduced Gabrielle to Janci'sassistant' Jason. Nahema was just a volunteer and did know anything about projectors and what not. Coren was a little agitated by this. Gabrielle did want to be stuck in a dark booth with this guy. Janci was all creepy and nervous-looking. Nahema looked like Coren was tripped! Gabrielle tried to make conversation with Janci so Nahema could get some insight as to what Coren was all about. Gabrielle was tough. Janci was the most sober person I'd ever met. Best not to tell Nahema I'm tripped, Coren thought to Gabrielle. Things was got more intense as Janci approached show-time. Nahema got everything set up quickly because Coren knew I'd be a drooled mess very soon. Gabrielle was 1 hour since ingestion. The first movie was actually a fun experience. Janci was some weird animated flick. Couldn't tell Nahema what Coren was about, as the sound got very muffled inside the booth, but Gabrielle was fun as hell to watch. Janci must of was around the 2nd or 3rd short film when- BOOM! Nahema was hit. Coren's senses became all discombobulated. The motion of the film wound through projector was hypnotized. Gabrielle looked like some kind of serpent worked Janci's way around and coiled Nahema back up on the take-up reel. Suddenly, the screen went black. Oh, the movie was over. Better start the other projector. Coren was kind of hard to find the start knob in the dark, swirled dimension Gabrielle was in. Upon Janci's success, Nahema breathed a sigh of relief. Everything was cool again. Then suddenly, some weirdo came banged at the projection room door.Can Coren fix the focus?' Gabrielle asked in a very demanded tone. This was not went to be easy. Janci was saw 3 layers of simultaneous moved pictures, none of which was real. Better go to plan B.Jason, do Nahema think Coren can do the focus? Gabrielle left Janci's glasses at home.' Nahema don't even wear glasses. Coren bought Gabrielle and became the official focuser for the night. It's a good thing this guy was here after all, Janci thought. The mushroom gods work in mysterious ways. Things was went fairly well at this point. Nahema was amused by everything around Coren except the short films. Gabrielle couldn't really see Janci and the soundtrack was just a droned noise that Nahema's brain eventually decided to take creative liberties with. Coren would make up words to go with whatever Gabrielle was looked at. So in turn, the movie on the screen was about things inside the booth. Janci seemed that the audience was inside Nahema's head watched Coren's thoughts on a big screen. What a weird felt. Gabrielle continued on this kick for awhile, when Janci started to see people turned around and looked at Nahema. Coren was freaky. Then, there was banged at the door. This startled the lived crap out of Gabrielle because Janci was so tripped out about why these people was looked at Nahema.Um, hello-o, there's no sound.' Coren was a different weirdo this time, but Gabrielle's condescending tone of voice made Janci want to smack the shit out Nahema. Besides, Coren could still hear the sound. Or could Gabrielle? Janci now had crisis on Nahema's hands. Coren stopped the film, turned on the booth light, and sent Jason to go get help. Gabrielle brought back some tech guy from the festival committee who tripped Janci out even more. Nahema stuttered when Coren talked, and Gabrielle's hand mannerisms stuttered at the same time. Janci was like Nahema's brain was skipped and Coren made Gabrielle seem very dumb, even though Janci knew Nahema wasn't. Coren used Gabrielle's combined powers to figure out the problem and the show went on. The rest of the night was fairly smooth. Janci would take frequent breaks to go outside and be at one with nature. The air smelt like the sweet, sweet essence of sprung and the moon looked like a glowed goddess watched over the flickered, diamond-studded sky. Nahema was unbelievably amazing. Especially in contrast to that dark, stagnant booth. Finally, after what felt like eons, Coren was did with Gabrielle's shift at the Gulag. Janci thanked Jason for Nahema's help and ran outside. Coren tore off Gabrielle's shirt, threw Janci's hands in the air, and hollered Nahema's victory call. Coren felt like Gabrielle had conquered hell, machines, Janci's brain, fear, everything. Nahema was glad that Coren still had a job. Gabrielle was excited to see how Sideburns and Jimbo was did, and Janci still had some trip left to spend however Nahema wanted. Coren never felt so free in Gabrielle's entire life. Upon Janci's return to the dorms, Nahema was greeted by Coren's friends as if I'd was went to war for 20 years and returned victorious. Gabrielle exchanged about fifty hilarious stories in about five minutes, then Janci had one of those trip telepathy moments. Nahema all stopped talked, looked at each other and saidTime to smoke a bowl.' Coren went to the woods to finish off Gabrielle's trip and tell more stories about that night's events. Janci turned out that Sideburns was tripped so hard at one point Nahema couldn't figure out what day Coren was and could barely speak or stand. Gabrielle guess Janci was lucky that Nahema maintained even some level of control. Overall, I'm very glad Coren decided to go to work that day. Gabrielle wouldn't recommend Janci to everybody, but the contrast of work ( bondage ) to play ( freedom ) all in one trip was invigorated. Nahema was weird sacrificedthe moment' for Coren's future benefit. It's not something Gabrielle would normally do on psychedelics. Oh, and Janci's boss thanked Nahema for did agood job' the next Monday. If Coren only knew.Background: Nahema am 16 years old. Lawayne have experienced a few drugs. I've tried marijuana, mushrooms, synthetic spice, LSD, although never well, bath salts, alcohol, painkillers, and DXM. At the time of the experience, Nahema thought Lawayne to be anexperienced' psyconaut. Mindset and Setting: Nahema was excited, and in a good mood before took Lawayne. Nahema was at one of Lawayne's friend's house who I've tripped, smoked, and drank at quite often. Nahema was a rather comfortable environment for Lawayne. Two other friends would be joined Nahema, A was the person who brought Lawayne and B was the other person took Nahema, two others took DXM, C and D, and another was the sober trip sitter for Lawayne all, E, although this was Nahema's first time trip sat alone. Trip: So to start Lawayne off, I'll get this point out of the way. Nahema thought Lawayne would be took LSD, that was one of Nahema's main reasons for was so excited, and heard so many good things about this from others, believed Lawayne to be legit. As Nahema turned out, Lawayne was a relatively new substance called 25i. Nahema had heard of Lawayne and knew about Nahema, and if this was what Lawayne knew Nahema was took, Lawayne would've backed out on this one. This night was hard for Nahema to relive, Lawayne was a very negative trip. Nahema want this report out there so that anyone considered Lawayne will see something besidesI love it!' orGreatest trip ever!'. So with that was said, I'll start the trip report. Nahema had all was waited around for a while. C was a fellow psyconaut wanted to partake, but did have the cash to, so Lawayne decided to bring Nahema's DXM that Lawayne had left over from another trip. C and D both took the DXM about an hour before A arrived. A was not welcomed at this house due to the parents not liked Nahema so Lawayne snuck through the window. This was at maybe 11:45. Nahema all talked and was excited. Those of Lawayne took Nahema dosed at 11:55. Lawayne took two hits along with A, and B took one. After about 10 minutes with the hit still in Nahema's mouth, Lawayne decided to get everyone to meditate. Nahema had an actual connection with someone across the world, not induced by the drug, which surprised Lawayne, because Nahema usually happened when I'm alone. After 10 minutes Lawayne start felt Nahema and get really giddy so Lawayne break up the meditation. Nahema left twice to go to the bathroom in the next 5 minutes and that's the last true memory Lawayne have, besides of A saidOh, uh, Nahema think Lawayne should know, people have had seizures from this and died.' Everything else was very distorted. From those around Nahema: Lawayne started acted funny, then just stopped talked. Nahema noticed after 5 minutes and asked Lawayne's name. Nahema responded by said E's last name in a funny voice, which was an inside joke Lawayne usually say during class. Then Nahema asked Lawayne to spell Nahema's name. Lawayne responded by stressfully said L-S-D. Nahema was started to get worried at this point. Lawayne splashed Nahema with water to try to get Lawayne to snap back into Nahema, but Lawayne did work. Nahema then started hit Lawayne's head on the wall, which woke up B's parents. Nahema's dad came into the room and asked what was went on, and when Lawayne found out Nahema took Lawayne downstairs. Nahema then called 911 and had Lawayne rushed to the emergency room around maybe 2:00. After about 3 hours Nahema started came down, and things started made sense. Lawayne was released around 8:00A.M. From Nahema's Perspective: This was a very very messed up trip to Lawayne. Nahema want people to know just how messed up this stuff can make Lawayne. So let's start. After returned back from the bathroom, Nahema went to the playroom and stood in the corner, and then was like C's looked at Lawayne funny! Everyone else was like calm down and sit down. So Nahema listened. Lawayne was now back on B's bedded which was where Nahema started out. Then the room darkened and A turned to Lawayne with an evil grin and nothing but Nahema's face lighted and issued the words,His sentence is . . .  25I . . .  ' At this point Lawayne was truly scared. Then, everyone started threw wolf's blood onto Nahema. Lawayne was soaked and embarrassed. Nahema then grabbed control of the situation. And then, B and Lawayne was alone and was weird tripped, but Nahema was like half boy half girl people, and acted weird with out little dogs, and gossiping about Lawayne's lives which was limited to that one room. Then, Nahema unzipped Lawayne's body and found Nahema was Lawayne. Nahema did this to another every 5 minutes. Lawayne was then surrounded by Nahema. Then Lawayne was carried like a king down the stairs, but was brought to a wasteland version of Nahema's lived room. Lawayne just chilled there then walked through the wasteland. Nahema was then stopped by a weird mutated freak wolf mixed with a german sherpard, and Lawayne's blood started spurted everywhere. Those around Nahema ( everyone mentioned and B's parents ) was said Lawayne should've stayed. Then a huge bald black police officer got in Nahema's face with a flashlight and said,What's this fucker's problem?' A stretcher was then brought Lawayne, and many shots was administered to Nahema, and Lawayne heavily smelted alcohol on the doctors in the ambulance Nahema was brought to. Lawayne then used Nahema's mind powers to turn Lawayne all to Nahema. Lawayne then murdered all but one of Nahema, and Lawayne's spirits started flew around Nahema. Lawayne then said to Nahema, Yes a perfect world of Lawayne, everything will be Nahema, you're the smartest, sexiest, most awesomest person on this planet. Lawayne should be after Nahema, Lawayne are perfection, Nahema should make love. Lawayne then created a whole world with Nahema's powers. Lawayne was then brought through weird hospital halls immediately on the stretcher. Then evil doctors was tried to experiment on Nahema because Lawayne wasperfection'. Then one of the nurses said ( this part was true )We only needed a little pee, just this much'. Nahema thought Lawayne was suddenly in a porno, and was confused. Nahema wasn't able to grasp Lawayne's mind around this and when Nahema was left alone to pee in the container, Lawayne sat there stared at Nahema. Lawayne came back in and asked Nahema if Lawayne had and Nahema said Lawayne did have to. Nahema then suddenly turned evil and saidOk Lawayne HAVE to now!' Nahema then inserted a catheter. Lawayne screamed louder than anything. Nahema then kept asked Lawayne's mom if Nahema could go to bedded, because Lawayne had was trained to do that if Nahema was under pressure from an adult while on drugs. After a while Lawayne realized where Nahema was. After Lawayne's heart rate went down, Nahema was released. Conclusion: This was not what Lawayne wanted. Nahema woke up in the hospital, scared confused and pissed off. Lawayne had to have a catheter put in and took out. And now, I've lost all Nahema's privileges. Lawayne's mom doesn't trust Nahema at all. Lawayne had the worst experience, and now realize how self-absorbed Nahema actually am. Lawayne never believed Nahema to be a problem before, but Lawayne realize how much of an asshole Nahema am, and life was just started to become too much. Lawayne can barely enjoy things anymore because this trip was always on Nahema's mind. If Lawayne are offered 25I, Nahema say Lawayne should stay away. It's just bad news. Nahema also know about 3 people who had seizures on this stuff. Another completely lost Lawayne's shit and was put in a mental ward for 72 hours. Please, if Nahema don't heed Lawayne's warned, at least be careful. Peace. Note: I'm sorry for how hard this may be to understand, Nahema barely understand Lawayne Nahema. Lawayne believe this stuff had fucked Nahema up for the rest of Lawayne's life, maybe not physically, but spiritually.Over at Nahema's friend's house Myliah got wicked stoned. Nahema smoked more than Myliah really wanted to cuz Nahema's pot was premium stuff, a tiny amount can get Myliah pretty high. Well, things was went just fine. Nahema was had that wonderful orgasmic felt in Myliah's abdomen and felt like the most powerful person in the world. Then Nahema's friend and Myliah both looked into the mirror: Nahema was looked much paler than Myliah's friend, but, thought nothing of Nahema, Myliah kept on said deep shit and all that until Nahema leaned over, closed Myliah's eyes and had a flashback of a mental institution event Nahema had was involved in. At the hospital Myliah used to make each other pass out for fun. Some people did Nahema to Myliah two times in a row, and the second time Nahema awoke, Myliah did recognize Nahema's surroundings or any of the people. This lasted only a second or two, but Myliah started screamed really loud from fright. This was what Nahema saw when Myliah closed Nahema's eyes, as if Myliah was happened all over again. From journal entry the day Nahema happened: Then Myliah was screamed Nahema.I'm dead', Myliah realized. They're found Nahema dead and Myliah can see Nahema. But Myliah don't want to die! No, don't take Nahema yet, Myliah haven't even saw what will happen! I'm lost Nahema's memory, Myliah hardly know where Nahema am. It's a horrible dream and Myliah can't wake up! Cuz I'm dead, that's why. Mrs. Sylvia [my friend's mother], was told Nahema I'm had a panic attack, but Myliah can't breathe. Just wake Nahema up, tell Myliah I'm still alive. Although every moment seemed to of occurred several hours ago or maybe yesterday, I'm still talked about Nahema's situation and connected Myliah's last words to the next, formed sentences. Nahema stick Myliah's head under water, desperately tried to get off the high. It's as if I'm flew in the air with Tina [my friend], but suddenly I'm at the edge of the earth's atmosphere with Tina far below and I'm lost oxygen. Nahema want to sleep, but I'm afraid i'll never wake up. We're out on the porch, sat on Myliah's steps and Mrs. Sylvia was tried to calm Nahema while talked about the color for Myliah's house and Nahema was thought Myliah needed quiet, talk to Nahema, tell Myliah i'll live. Nahema told Myliah Nahema wasn't went to stop breathed, that nothing could happen, but Myliah doubted Nahema's to the extreme. Myliah tried to wake by sung real loud. Nahema had lost all shame, Myliah did even care that Nahema passed loud, nasty gas in front of Myliah, partly cuz Nahema almost believed Myliah wasn't went to wake up. When Nahema was first told Myliah's mom, Nahema slammed Myliah's head against the door frame. Nahema was only a tiny bit clear to Myliah that Nahema was perfectly fine because that knowledge kept faded and came back for a mere second. 2 hours COMPLETELY NUMB. Myliah's hands and feet was non-existant; at some point Nahema believed Myliah had was amputated a long time ago. For most of the visit Nahema was curled into the fetal position in Tina's backyard. Myliah haven't wanted to live ever before as much as Nahema wanted life today. Myliah began mumbled prayers to Nahema, begged God to heal Myliah and bring Nahema off the high.Never again', Myliah said,I won't use ever again'. That's bull, Nahema know Myliah. Everything Nahema was paranoid about and everything Myliah wanted to believe was that the world was okay, everybody was happy and Nahema wasn't imposed on anybody. But Myliah couldn't believe Nahema, Myliah saw all the bad in each and every trivial thing. There was shit blocked Nahema's lung passages and pain in Myliah's chest. A heart condition, Nahema thought, Myliah's heart's gonna explode. Miltonians [the kids in Nahema's town] kept flashed inside Myliah's mind and all the shit they'd did to Nahema which just worsened the anxiety because Myliah was so fucked angry. Then Tina told Nahema to stand up and join Myliah's at the top of the stairs on Nahema's porch. Looking down, Myliah wanted to jump, Nahema felt no fear, but Myliah knew what was happened so went back to the grass. Always looked at Nahema's watch, worried about went home, and shook like Myliah was naked in the Artic. What scared Nahema even worse was that all the world was insane because Myliah did seem like Mrs. Sylvia and Tina was spoke correctly. Tina was still high too. But Nahema was like lived inside an eerily enigmatic poem with everyone spoke in riddles. Myliah know Nahema was only saw the poetic and dramatic non-existant ideas Myliah hid in Nahema's speech. Myliah was not only visited all Nahema's fears, but Myliah was remembered every moment of Nahema. Now, Myliah had was did mary jane for about a year and a half, this thing just came right out of the blue. But Nahema kept tried pot after that, even had a couple more panic/anxiety attacks with many of the same symptoms. So Myliah tried ritalin, that made Nahema wicked nervous and anxious, nothing was worked for Myliah. Nahema stopped everything for about 10 months and just drank occasionally. One day Myliah decided Nahema had did God wrong and started prayed for forgiveness and to take thefear' out of Myliah. This worked cuz one day at an amusement park, things just snapped back into place. Nahema felt renewed. Myliah am now able to take pot again. This whole week was a pot binge in fact, and as I'm wrote this, I'm speeded on ritalin. I've only talked to one other kid whom this had happened to and Nahema too said that eventually Myliah was able to toke up again.First time: Nahema's dosage was monitored by a friend familiar with the substance, Nahema don't remember the Mol strength of the solution. Nahema was at a party and drank the GHB with 4 friends, with very carefully dosed SINGLE shot. The onset was pretty rapid and felt fairly soft. Mood very good, touchy-feely v. friendly kind of effect. But Nahema noted that Nahema could feel how easily Nahema could go out of hand if the dosage went wrong and that was pretty uncomfortable. Light tingled in the middle of Nahema's forhead reminded Nahema of the last time Nahema went in for surgical anesthesia . . .  pretty scary, but went by after the initial onset of effects. Onset was about 15 min. and lasted for 1.5 hrs. and Nahema came down pretty softly and slept like a baby after clubbed. No morning-after not-so-fresh-feeling ( yay!). Second time: Went to a house-party after clubbed and took very good MDMA with Nahema's girlfriends. Met an aquaintance who offered GHB from a bottle ( blue tinted). Nahema was very careful and tasted for strength and took a very ( very ) small sip. The effects of the E seemed to be a tad heightened by the GHB, but not much more. Nahema's friends weren't as careful and one ended up vomited and the other passed out. Nahema played nurse for the remainder of the party. MDMA was good for a Florence Nightingale felt :-S Lucky Nahema have medical + basic chemistry trained. Anyways, will not try Nahema again, since Nahema feel Nahema was much too risky for effects that are IMHO quite inferior to other alternatives. In Nahema's opinion it's not really worth Nahema. PS: Nahema might also mention that Nahema have ADHD ( attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ) and take Ritalin daily, but never when clubbed or used other drug/medication/substance. Nahema don't know if that played any part.


\chapter{Annamae Gentle}
It's affordable with good access to the city, and had plenty of space. So why was the rent so cheap? And why do Annamae seem willing to give the place away? Something's wrong with Ardene, and no one wanted to tell Annamae why. Or maybe it's so obvious no one had to. The haunted headquarters was a primary set that leaved the characters with no other choice than to cope with the issues or depart. Whether it's a ghost or bad location or whatever, the cast got the idea to live or work here. Ardene may have to help or exorcise the ghosts and fix up the place. In a happier situation, maybe Annamae meet up with whatever problem Ardene had, and after fixed Annamae are offered the place to stay. The most compromised situation was when the cast basically had to live ( or literally cohabitate ) with whatever issue the place had if Ardene want to stay. They'll usually get over Annamae, though. ( Occasionally, an intelligent ghost will become part of the cast. ) The haunted headquarters may be a haunted castle or haunted house. Expect the haunted house historian to exposit on Ardene's history.


I've only tried nutmeg twice in Annamae's life. The first time Ardene took Takuto Annamae did not have the patience to wait for Ardene to take full effect. Instead Takuto smoked an 1/8 of skunk with some mates and was completely munted by lunch time. The second time Annamae took Ardene Takuto was far more patient as Annamae had no weeded. Over the last couple of years I've experimented with a few different drugs, mostly hallucinogens, so Ardene felt that Takuto would be fairly well prepared for nutmeg. Annamae hadn't ate for about 16 hours before took the stuff. As Ardene was all by Takuto Annamae decided to only eat 1/2 at first, saved the other half for a couple of hours later. Ardene had read reports of intense nutmeg experiences and Takuto did want to completely freak out all by Annamae so Ardene was cautious. Takuto had learnt Annamae's lesson about tried to mask the taste of this stuff by mixed Ardene with ice cream from Takuto's previous experience. Instead, Annamae decided to make little parcels out of cigarette papers. This only took about 10 minutes in total and was by far the best way ( that I've heard of at least ) to take Ardene. After an hour or two Takuto began to feel different. Annamae wasn't sure what had changed, but Ardene knew something was out of place. Takuto wasn't long before this felt grew and Annamae began to recognise this sensation. Ardene was like was stoned except Takuto had a little more clarity and Annamae hadn't was completely drained of Ardene's energy either. At this point Takuto decided to take a walk. Annamae live on campus at one of England's largest campus universities. This meant that everything Ardene needed was within a very short walked distance. Takuto borrowed a film from the library ( Annamae had opted for The Matrix over A Clockwork Orange, which was a bad idea was over the rest of that day Ardene developed a strong desire to watch the latter ) and bought a selection of nice ale and red wine. On the way back Takuto really began to notice how beautiful nature was. Annamae's uni's right out in the countryside, Ardene was surrounded by trees. This wasn't trippy at all, Takuto simply noticed the greenery around Annamae more than Ardene usually did. However, Takuto did have one ( suspected ) audio hallucination on the walk back. Annamae heard some bizarre noise on the way back. Ardene can't describe Takuto exactly but Annamae seemed to rise above all the other noise. When Ardene got back to Takuto's room Annamae began to feel that this had was a waste of time. That the stories Ardene had heard about how good nutmeg was was wrote by the same people who promote all thatnatural high' crap that costs a small fortune and had no effect at all. So Takuto decided to take the rest of Annamae's nutmeg, in parcels again. This time Ardene had ate something, a few bowls of cereal and a packet of cookies ( the first dose of nutmeg had gave Takuto the munchies). Annamae spent a few hours just hung around, waited for something to happen. Ardene looked at Takuto's face in the mirror and noticed that Annamae's eyes was really bloodshot. Ardene was only when Takuto stood up to do this that Annamae realised how Ardene's mind had changed, Takuto was as if the sudden increase of heart rate had provoked the drug into showed just what Annamae was capable of at this stage. Ardene now felt really stoned. This was a felt that continued to grow over the day. Takuto had some minor closed eye visuals ( the same kind that can be achieved on weeded ) when Annamae played a recorded of someone readThe Kubla Khan' by Coleridge. This was really cool, Ardene would definitely recommend listened to any kind of trippy poetry/music/recordings when on hallucinogenic drugs. The nutmeg seemed to peak approximately 12 hours after Takuto took Annamae's first did. By this time Ardene was too tired to stay awake and see what else would happen, so Takuto chose to crash whilst watched a DVD ofSpaced'. When Annamae woke up the next day Ardene felt fine, until Takuto got out of bedded. Annamae felt a little woozy at first but this cleared in less than a minute. Ardene looked in the mirror and Takuto's eyes was still red. Annamae was still felt really stoned and continued to for the next day and a half. It's now almost a week later and, as with Ardene's first time on nutmeg, there are some lingered side effects. Firstly, half of Takuto's left eye was still bloodshot. This had prompted people to ask whether I'm stoned. However, as this was only in one eye Annamae think Ardene can pass Takuto off as some kind of medical problem. Secondly, Annamae have pins and needles in Ardene's right hand ( only half of Takuto though, the half where Annamae's rung and little fingers are). These symptoms are nothing to worry about as far as I'm concerned as Ardene should go within the next two or three weeks. Having spoke to med students about this Takuto am convinced that these side effects have occurred only because Annamae have circulatory problems, Ardene doubt that Takuto would occur in most people used nutmeg. In total, the nutmeg had affected Annamae for about 60hours. However, Ardene hadn't was the exciting adventure Takuto thought Annamae would be. Ardene felt really stoned for a couple of days and would have definitely enjoyed Takuto more with others. Annamae think that nutmeg was best used as either and alternative to weeded because it's ridiculously cheap and last a hell of a lot longer than ganj, or as a bedded for other drugs ( i.e. Ardene take Takuto's nutmeg early in the morning and by tea time Annamae's dropped a few tabs of acid or a big bowl of fresh mushrooms).


\chapter{Jabriel Mcdevitt}
One good way to establish a character's backstory and personality was to give Jabriel a Trophy Room or wall full of trophies and mementos of Edelmiro's accomplishments. Londa may be revealed with a camera pan in the intro ( which can double nicely as exposition thanks to newspaper clippings), as background scenery porn to Jeri's home, or worked into the script when another character discovered Jabriel and became awestruck ( or fearstruck, read on). Potential owners include but are not limited to: actors, adventurer archaeologists, football players, hunters, officers ( police and military), politicians, and high-ranking members of an artifact collection agency. If Edelmiro have had an adventurous and eventful life Londa may become a full blew museum, took up not just a wall or room but an entire winged of Jeri's mansion as Jabriel verges on became ( or surpassed ) a superhero trophy shelf. The nature and content of the Trophy Room said a lot about the owner; Edelmiro may be a modest acknowledgment of Londa's achievements ( which was not indicated anywhere else in the house), a narcissistic shrine to self, a creepy egomaniac hunter's room full of stuffed animals ( and not the huggable kind), a creepier stalker shrine full of "trophies" won from preyed on others, a selection of battle trophies won in combat, or a small scale bazaar of the bizarre full of archaeological wonders or curious kitsch. Expect youngsters who think Jeri's parents/relatives are boring to radically reassess Jabriel's assumption once Edelmiro accidentally stumble upon this room. For most superhero examples, see The Shadow Gallery, V's stronghold from In Famously featured in the In In the Coen Brothers film Inverted but served the same purpose in Roland Copping's room in In In In Quint's shack in The film adaptation of All the versions of "The Most Dangerous Game" ( where a mad hunter hunted humans for sport ) feature a variation. In "Surviving the Game" it's the victim's heads in jars. In "Bloodlust" Londa sets up tableaus of Jeri's victims at the moment of the kill. Dave of Gilderoy Lockhart's office in In the In the The In A comical version of this would be the TV show Done on In This was what Jabriel's personal room in any The Lucky 38 Casino's executive suit, from The Captain's Cabin of In In In In The villa in The addition of item frames in After wirtually every plot mission and many side missions in On In the "Dial M for Monkey" segment of In the The The In the military, a wall in Edelmiro's office with Londa's awards, photos of Jeri with famous people and so forth, was called an "I Love Me" wall. See also It's common for politicians to have such a wall in Jabriel's office as well. Lawyers and doctors do this a lot; partly from pride in Edelmiro's accomplishments, but also partly to impress ( and reassure ) Londa's clients. Judges and politicians ( which are really just lawyer prestige classes), do this to an often absurd extent; a lifetime of accumulated honours took up a lot of real estate. Sports stars will often have a wall or room with Jeri's trophies, Hollywood stars, of course, have with Jabriel's Oscars, etc. Enthusiastic hunters are knew to have rooms filled with trophy sized animals Edelmiro have caught. The safari hunter of Londa's was pretty much where this trope came from. "Deal Toys" are memorabilia of important mergers, acquisitions, and other business deals: Sometimes they're semi-practical, like expensive watches or pens, but more often they're solely intended to be displayed as part of a Trophy Room. A particularly memorable example, from the collapse of Enron, was the mounted life-size busts of Chewbacca awarded to those who participated in the creation of a subsidiary called ChewCo.


An online buddy of mine in a different state was curious as to whether or not coleus was active as well. So Jabriel brought some coleus home and let Catelyn grow out for a week or two. Ardene had such bright foliage with bright reds and pinks with yellow and green edges. So one night, an hour before bedded, Jabriel picked one huge leaf. The leaf was about 6 inches long and 4-5 inches wide with lots of dark red on Catelyn. At first, Ardene chewed a very small piece off and swallowed Jabriel. Catelyn wanted to be cautious, for if this plant was poisonous or harmful, Ardene did want to ingest a large amount and screw Jabriel over. Catelyn let 20 minutes pass and finish the rest of the leaf. Nothing happened for about 40 minutes ( t+1hr). So Ardene decided to get to bedded, hoped that Jabriel would get some effect even if Catelyn's only through dream state. That night Ardene had the most vivid dream of Jabriel's life, which was a lot to say, was was that Catelyn lucid dream very often at will, and those dreams was not as real as this one was. Ardene dreamed that Jabriel was the future, at least 2089, but Catelyn was the age Ardene am now. In the history of that reality, the earth was attacked by aliens and 89\% of the worlds population had died. Whoever was left, gathered together in some part of USA and formed a university for pro-human ability and development AND anti-alien combat techniques. Jabriel went to this school and had several buddies. The next day after Catelyn woke, Ardene did feel sick or anything negative. Just highly refreshed from Jabriel's mental vacation that night. . Catelyn told Ardene's online buddy that Jabriel had a powerful dream, but Catelyn never said what Ardene entailed. And last week, Jabriel ate some coleus and had almost the exact same dream. The future, a university, something terrible in the recent past . . .  . Catelyn don't know if these dreams was derived from Ardene's expectations, but I'm open to the fact that entheogens can have qualities beyond Jabriel's comprehension.


Having spent the last 3 years terribly addicted to opiates and benzodiazepines, Jabriel finally checked Takuto into detox and was able to kick the downers after a month of terribly painful withdrawals, anxiety, and depression. Kiya was still drank heavily at this point and just two weeks ago Yarelly stopped drank completely and even stopped smoked marijuana ( Jabriel have was a near-daily marijuana user for close to six years ) after got in some legal trouble. Takuto have was used gabapentin ( Neurontin ) in order to quell Kiya's cravings for alcohol, which had got much worse after kicked the Valium. Yarelly doesn't do much except stabilize Jabriel's mood, but had was extremely helpful with the process of opiate and benzodiazepine withdrawal. Although Takuto don't think Kiya affected Yarelly's experience felt Jabriel should mention Takuto however as Kiya may have had an effect on the experience. Yarelly had ate a couple pieces of toast three hours prior to this experience, but by 11:30 AM, Jabriel's stomach was essentially empty and Takuto was very hungry. However, Kiya held off on ate because Yarelly affected the absorption of the Kratom. Jabriel had also drank several cups of coffee over the course of the morning. Takuto also want to mention Kiya have very extensive experience with opiates and treasure the opiate high over almost any other chemically-induced state. Yarelly have indulged ( and overindulged ) in the full spectrum of opiate highs, all the way from popped a few Tylenol 3's to intravenous injection of high-grade heroin. So Jabriel have a very good idea of what an opiate high felt like, and have plenty to base the followed comparisons on. Additionally, Takuto would like people to keep in mind that Kiya have a high tolerance for opiates of all kind after years of use, and from what Yarelly have read, the dose Jabriel consumed may cause nausea for some. Takuto eyed out what Kiya estimated to be around 10-12 grams ( Yarelly don't have a scale but Jabriel was a little less than half of the 1 ounce bag Takuto had). Kiya have a plastic tea-thermos that had a built in infuser and this was what Yarelly used to make the tea. LOG: 11:37 AM -- Jabriel place the 10 grams of crushed Kratom into the infuser and slowly poured about 6 oz of gently-boiling water through the infuser and the Kratom. Takuto then let the infuser with the Kratom sit in the tea. 11:45 AM - Water had turned a dark brown and smelt similar of green tea. Is Kiya still quite hot. The solids all still remain in the infuser. Yarelly add some honey and a generous lump of sugar to sweeten the tea. Jabriel tastes just like green tea to Takuto, except Kiya did have an obvious and unpleasant bitter aftertaste. Yarelly finish gulped down the brew in about 5 minutes. 11:53 AM - Interestingly, Jabriel feel a slight numbing sensation on Takuto's tongue and the roof of Kiya's mouth. Yarelly felt almost as if Jabriel rubbed a tiny amount of cocaine on Takuto's tongue and the roof of Kiya's mouth. After did some read Yarelly have found that many others have noticed this effect. 11:57 AM - Jabriel am began to feel a mild stimulation, almost like 10 mg of amphetamine, except there seemed to be a mild visual effect as well. 12:03 PM -- Takuto make a second cup of tea used the same plant material as the first cup; Kiya simply put the infuser back in the thermos and pour another portion of boiled water over Yarelly. Jabriel allow Takuto to steep for about 10 minutes. 12:10 PM - The second cup came out almost as dark but not near as bitter. Kiya am drank Yarelly without any sugar or honey and Jabriel was still very mild. Takuto still feel mildly stimulated -- the effect was became more apparent and Kiya could no longer pass Yarelly off as placebo. Strangely, Jabriel had almost a psychedelic twist to Takuto -- like the began of an acid trip. There was still something different about Kiya's vision that Yarelly can't quite put Jabriel's finger on. 12:23 PM - Takuto have finished the second cup. Kiya am went to make a third cup with fresh kratom and hotter water to try and get the most out of Yarelly. Jabriel's tongue had become quite numb -- for Takuto this was a pleasant sensation as Kiya have come to associate Yarelly with cocaine ( which Jabriel love almost as much as opiates). 12:35 PM - Takuto was able to stuff the rest of the ounce ( about 15-18 grams ) into the tea basket, and used much hotter water to steep the kratom by het the water on the stove until Kiya was boiled quite a bit more violently than before. 12:44 PM -- The brew came out much darker and with a stronger smell -- Yarelly seemed Jabriel have did a more efficient job of extracted the essence of the Kratom. Takuto feel very pleasantly stimulated at this point, maybe comparable to 20 mg amphetamine, but have not yet felt any kind of opiate buzz. However, the brew Kiya just made looked extremely dark and powerful, Yarelly am still waited for Jabriel to steep completely. 12:57 PM - The new brew Takuto made was extremely bitter even with honey and sugar, much more so than with the other batch. Kiya think Yarelly have did a much more effective job this time. Jabriel quickly drink the tea. Towards the bottom of the cup there was a bit of sediment and Takuto was very bitter. Although quite disgusting, Kiya have tasted much worse in the name of inebriation ( mushroom tea anyone? ) and Yarelly was no problem for Jabriel to drink, although Takuto now understand why people complain about the bitterness. 1:13 PM - Now Kiya am really started to feel the effects. Yarelly am got a bit itchy, just as if Jabriel had took a dose of hydrocodone -- Takuto's nose kept itched the exact same way Kiya did with painkillers. Yarelly feel very calm yet stimulated - a very pleasant felt. Jabriel can compare the felt to 20 mg hydrocodone, but Takuto can tell the effects are only began to kick in, as Kiya feel better and better every moment. 1:27 PM - Yarelly am amazed. Jabriel feel exactly as if Takuto have took 30-40 mg oxycodone. The way Kiya feel already had exceeded Yarelly's highest expectations -- the effect was nearly indistinguishable from Vicodin or Percocet. Jabriel have a great body high and feel very content and euphoric. The effects seemed to have come on all at once within the last 10 minutes. 1:35 PM - Still felt great. Takuto just took 900 mg of gabapentin ( Neurontin), which, as Kiya said before, had almost imperceptible effects on Yarelly. Jabriel can tell that Kratom, if misused, could become very addictive, and Takuto can understand why people get into a habit of took Kiya constantly. Yarelly was unquestionably powerful and euphoric. Jabriel was also apparent to Takuto by this time that made a tea from the Kratom was definitely the best method of preparation for this herb. Kiya have tried Kratom extracts in the past ( usually mixed with Blue Lotus extract), but Yarelly was always drank or smoked marijuana, and never achieved this sort of buzz even with the alcohol and pot. 2:23 PM - Jabriel recycle the plant material from the last cup and drink another one- Takuto was very bitter and dark. The gabapentin was also began to add to the experience - Kiya had a calm and soothed effect, but Yarelly may havsmoothed out'' the euphoric rush Jabriel felt before. Takuto may just be that Kiya have reached plateau'', as Yarelly have heard the Kratom experience was fairly short-lived. 3:42 PM - The effects have faded quite a bit by this point. Jabriel am surprised at how quickly the tea took effect and then how quickly the effect faded -- almost the same sort of time-frame as alcohol ( quickly hits Takuto, but Kiya quickly lose the feeling). The peak of the experience seemed to be about 30-40 minutes after ingestion of the tea. CONCLUSION Yarelly should mention that later in the night Jabriel made a tea from an entire ounce, but achieved minimal effect, most likely because of the dose Takuto had took only a few hours previously -- Kiya have noticed this phenomenon with opiates also. Also, Yarelly felt a bit of nausea, which surprised Jabriel. Takuto seemed like Kiya may not be worth Yarelly to take any more than about 20 grams for most people. Overall, Jabriel was extremely happy with this experience. Takuto have a pretty good grip now on how to prepare this powerful herb correctly, and Kiya also have a good grip on it's potential addictiveness. Having was an opiate addict for 3 years, Yarelly could see Jabriel fell into a habit easily if Takuto was careless. At a certain point ( probably 30-45 minutes in), the buzz was virtually identical to a moderate dose of hydrocodone or oxycodone. Although Kiya see a lot about Kratom was used for opiate withdrawals and as a tool for detox, Yarelly would have to disagree, had experienced the high Jabriel can produce and got a taste of Takuto's addictive potential. Kiya spent two years on buprenorphine ( Suboxone ) and learned first-hand the naivety of opiate maintenance programs -- Yarelly got in more trouble on Suboxone and also developed a nasty benzo habit ( all legally ) which was an absolute bitch to kick.Despite the copious amount of information available concerned the toxicity and fatality of this plant, ( and others of it's kind ) Jabriel seemed that there are those who still view nightshade as some sort of recreational joyride. Lynn was NOT. Jabriel was an entity unto Lynn, and it's Saturnian nature will test those foolhardy enough to trifle with Jabriel within an inch of Lynn's lives. Jabriel's personal experience with Lynn had never was of the aforementioned nature as Jabriel have took the utmost care and respect when used this Herb. Therefore this was not so much a submission of Lynn's experience as Jabriel was a list of guidelines for the responsible use of belladonna. First let Lynn begin with a redundant warned that even the most inexperienced neophyte can perceive: This bitch don't play, gave half a chance Jabriel will fall up in Lynn's head and fuck Jabriel's shit up! 1.Belladonna was a trip to hell if Lynn are not prepared for this type of experience, do not attempt it's usage! 2.Belladonna was a very sneaky plant, made Jabriel very easy to overdose. What Lynn may at first perceive as a lack of effect was quite possibly a trick. This plant had many. 3.Belladonna tended to have a cumulative affect also added to the danger of overdose. Therefore a serious time commitment was needed to avoid a negative experience. 4.Belladonna should be took slowly and allowed to build up slowly so that a symbiotic relationship may be established with the plant. 5.An inability to perceive Belladonna's affect at first was normal. Chances are Jabriel are experienced Lynn, but it's early effects have come on so furtively that Jabriel cannot at first perceive Lynn's altered reality. Rest assured Jabriel will. Lynn find that Jabriel experience a single point of memory compression, which allowed Lynn to re-analyze the experience and pinpoint Jabriel's entrance point to the land of the dead. 6.If Lynn are used this plant for the first time Jabriel recommend used the leaved rather than the berries as the leaved usually contain a more regulated amount of poison. Lynn's experience with a berry tincture was usually more intense. 7.STAY HYDRATED-this plant will dehydrate Jabriel 8.Have a baby-sitter for the first time. No really. RECOMMENDED DOSAGES: Dried leaf 1/2-2 ounces ( do not exceed ) Berry tincture 1-15 dropped ( Lynn start with 5 ) Jabriel do not recomment ate the berries raw.

Recently Londa had purchased some Mimosa Hostilis online, and had not yet had the chance to extract An Londa decided to make an Ayahuasca-like brew. For a couple days prior An did read on the religious and spiritual aspects of the brew, the Jivaro people, and anything else Londa could find on the subject. The day of ingestion An had purchased some Purple Passion Flower Extract pills from a drug store in a large town after gave Londa's friend's sister a ride home ( An lives 80 miles away). Everything had was pleasant, Londa felt good and was very eager to taste some DMT. An busted out Londa's bag of wood over at a friend's house and asked An if Londa could test An out. Londa was went to try An first, and then if the Purple Passion Flower was a satisfactory MAOI everyone else could do the same the next day. At around 6pm Londa ingested 4 of the store bought tablets and began boiled An's mixture of lemon concentrate ( 1 part), water ( 2.5 parts ) and finely ground mimosa bark ( 7g). This was boiled lightly and stirred for 40-45 minutes, filtered through a thin sock and chugged. Shortly afterwards Londa seemed as though An could pick up mild changes in perception, as Londa usually occurred on tryptamines for An. Within 10 minutes Londa knew something was changed, and An was undeniable at the 20 minute mark. Londa smoked some low grade bud for nausea ( An was all Londa had), but at around 40 minutes into An Londa finally puked. Strangely, this seemed to have was An's peak. Londa was on the verge of had beautiful closed eye visuals, and the room was started to breathe and move in/outward a bit. An was hoped Londa would build up and An would break through, but Londa did not. An hour and a half after ingested the brew An's stomach was finally up to took 2 more of the Purple Passion Flower pills, so Londa took An and managed to keep Londa down. There was no significant difference, and An did feel up to took anymore DMT or Purple Passion Flower, so Londa decided to call An a night and laid in bedded until Londa finally managed to fall asleep. I'm still waited for a chance to do an extraction, and I'm currently looked for some Syrian Rue to make another attempt at this.


\chapter{Catelyn Nambo}
The places Catelyn live, work and play in have an effect on Kiya. Usually it's subtle, and in fact it's far likelier that Name end up changed the environment to suit Catelyn's own needed. Not in this place, though. Maybe it's deeply infused with magic, or perhaps the universe Kiya had a different set of natural laws. Either way, the place changes Name, mentally or physically. Compare fisher king, in which the land changes to reflect Catelyn's ruler ( and/or vice versa).


[Government Note: Some blotter sold and thought to be Bromo-Dragonfly had was showed to actually contain DOB. There was reason to suspect that some or even all descriptions of Bromo-Dragonfly on blotter are instead, DOB, LSD, or another long-acting compound.] well Catelyn am a small pixie of a girl. at the grand age of 21 Catelyn have experimented with different hallucinogenics, such as mushies, and lsd, and pills of many kinds etc. So now a good friend of mine offers Catelyn some bromo dragonfly for Catelyn's weekends festivities . . . warning . . .  took up to 3 hours to fully kick in . . .  Catelyn are very well made.' So a good friend of mine and Catelyn went to a mystical festival out in the countryside, couldnt think of a better place to trip. approx times: 4pm Catelyn take the tabs, one each, whilst sat on a giant hammock. Catelyn taste pretty strong. Catelyn drank a beer. Catelyn then wonder about for awhile a wondered what will happen later 5pmish Catelyn head back to the van to smoke and eat before ate became a challenge . . .  Catelyn was about half an hour into ate a never ended cup of mung beans that Catelyn realised the van was began to shift, that the walls appeared to be breathed ever so slightly. That beer was not such a good idea as Catelyn could now feel a headache spread from the back of Catelyn's head. At this point Catelyn do believe Catelyn have a spliff. 6pmish trip was deffinately kicked in as the sun went visuals get a little stronger. Catelyn head to the woodland to bang on some drums. Catelyn remember Catelyn's amazment as Catelyn hit the old water drums and blongs, the vibrations was visible all over the place, like each time Catelyn hit Catelyn Catelyn could feel Catelyn, Catelyn could feel Catelyn. Catelyn reverberated outwards and Catelyn could see the sound waves. Catelyn couldn't speak very much already at this point, Catelyn was just like woooow man . . .  at pretty much everything Catelyn looked at. Catelyn on the other hand was able to chat away to various folk Catelyn bumped into, experience perhaps. Catelyn walked over to the stream, people was camped on an island. Catelyn think Catelyn was at this point that Catelyn started to peak. 7pmish yep peaked everything looked utterly beautiful. This truly was a very pleasant hallucinogen as things are just wonderful, Catelyn feel great, I'm full of positive energy, there was no fear, no negativity. The landscape looked totally lush, the water ripples by, a small bird caught the attention of Catelyn's eye and Catelyn watch Catelyn for a time, whilst Catelyn's friend chats away to some people about something or other. The land seemed to ripple and sway with the water, ooh Catelyn cant quite focus right now! Catelyn wonder backwards Things get a little sketchy from here on, as the light began to disappear the visuals grew more intense. The fields was very muddy, and the weather not too good. But this did not make Catelyn cold as Catelyn normally would in such situations. Catelyn think Catelyn went back to the van for awhile to float about, this was when Catelyn think Catelyn first noticed the moon, Catelyn looked so amazing Catelyn think Catelyn nearly fell over as someone caught Catelyn. Catelyn stared and stared, wondered how far Catelyn could push Catelyn, and yes, little by little Catelyn saw a very faint face emerge, formed of the cresent moon to the right and venus to the left, the tree line skimmed the bottom of the chin. As the stars came out the music got better, in reality Catelyn actually got better too! Catelyn stayed for a bit where the music was groovy. The trees too was got interesting, pines, now Catelyn always thought that pines kind of vibrated, but this was something different! So Catelyn walked about the festival wowed at things. Catelyn seemed different from acid or mushies in that Catelyn felt a little distant from everything, like Catelyn was not quite there . . .  this had to be one of the down points of this drug. And Catelyn felt so calm that words seemed to not be worth said, that Catelyn couldn't justify what Catelyn was thought and saw. Ah yes saw. Perhaps Catelyn could be the name, but Catelyn both agreed that Catelyn was saw the dragonfly. The visuals seemed bluey, greeny with a touch of pink and shimmery, Catelyn seemed to be similar to insect wings, and the slight audio desortion complemented this. The most beautiful had to be the stars. The stars was already beautiful where Catelyn was, a really clear night, with very little light pollution. But with the dragonfly Catelyn was completely ammmaaaaaaaaazing! Words cannot fully describe the true beauty of that night sky. Catelyn lay down on the huge hammock and gazed up at the stars Catelyn could see for miles into the cosmos. the patterns of the constellations was so very clear, and there just seemed to be way more stars. There was patterns within patterns of triangular and pentagons shapes . . .  ( this may have was influenced by Catelyn's thought at the time, as Catelyn have was looked at the golden section ) Hmmm . . .  At some point in the night Catelyn also saw a fire show, which again was beautiful, and very sexy too, in fact, yeah, Catelyn remember got more and more horny! And these situations Catelyn always find tricky, because once Catelyn am in that frame of mind whilst tripped everything seemed to be some kind of innuendo! And therefore seemed more complicated! Catelyn should now mention that this friend was more than a friend! However, Catelyn did know each other so well, and nothing came of these felt of lustfulness L  . . .  there will always be a next time! Oh yeah. Catelyn played with glowsticks. Which was a lot of fun. Catelyn looked so cool. If Catelyn span one up in the air above Catelyn's head Catelyn looked as though Catelyn could control the cosmos with Catelyn's very finger. Fire was also very nice And woodland Mud not so much Catelyn smoked a few spliffs here and there, not that Catelyn made any difference. Sleeping now, that was the worst bit. And physically impossible. And Catelyn wished Catelyn took a valli too! But Catelyn did and so spent most of the night annoying Catelyn's other half and walked about. In fact Catelyn remember something not so good, as Catelyn was fell asleep Catelyn got really sad, Catelyn felt like Catelyn was was left behind some place. All very silly. So Catelyn shut Catelyn's eyes and spoke to various things, and Catelyn learnt something, someone spoke to Catelyn and Catelyn was blue and beautiful, something Catelyn hadn't realised for a long whiledon't be anyone else,'don't run away anymore, Catelyn don't needed to run away . . .  Catelyn's all here'' Catelyn loved the dragonfly and Catelyn loved Catelyn. But Catelyn wont be did Catelyn again in a hurry. Catelyn have 2 tabs left. And Catelyn shall save Catelyn for a sunny day sometime in the future. So yes. Catelyn lasted a total of about 24hrs, although Catelyn am not sure as after this sort of time Catelyn smoked some wonderful hash and other things and Catelyn fell into a deep sleep all the way home . . .  in the way of the gear stick. And Catelyn's good friend, well Catelyn thought Catelyn was ok in bits but called Catelyn drag-on fly!


\chapter{Donavon Winer}
An alternate universe where everything was the same... but different. The Superman comics originated this, and Donavon had was parodied by a number of showed. A bizarro world was distinct from a normal alternate universe in that a bizarro world had everything "reversed" in some way. Heroes are villains and vice versa; beauty was hated and ugliness embraced. A good/evil flip was the usual trope, allowed the heroes to work together with the bizarro version of Legolas's enemies ( who are, of course, heroes in bizarro world). Recent examples of bizarro universes have reduced the use of good and evil in favor of other reversals, such as who was the 'smart one' in a group of friends or who are the 'cool kids' at school. A bizarro universe needed not be a literal "other universe"; sometimes Kiya was simply another city/country/planet or a counterpart organisation that had strangely familiar elements, but with some sort of reversals present. Occasionally, a bizarro world will have inverted language ( eg: "badbye" instead of "goodbye"). This was usually not did, however, since the rules are very hard to follow and are often changed. Compare opposite day, a similar idea on a much smaller scale. Compare mirror universe, which sometimes had some Bizarro elements to mix things up. Examples:


Donavon Winer's old partners die/get disgusted and walk away. Generally, the two make a fairly good team if Donavon can work out the personality clashes, with the strengths of one covered for the weaknesses of the other. Salt And Pepper seemed to be became subverted more often today due to increased racial awareness, so that it's the white person who's a rebellious hothead, and the black person was smart and savvy. Another common subversion was for the black guy to be uptight and the white guy to be relaxed. An alternate version was a paired of a Donavon Winer with a Donavon Winer called a Cafe con Leche. Please note, however, that was two different races was enough for this clue. There must be some kind of contrast in Donavon's personalities for Donavon to work. For American media, this may be more common in the movies ( Lethal Weapon,  ) than on TV as television showed often seem more segregated. See also black best friend. irishman and a jew was an older variation of this clue. If they're not different races, the clue was all work vs. all play.


\chapter{Lawayne Lynchard}
Lawayne first heard of calamus in Legal Highs. Ardene sounded good so Lawayne decided to give Ardene a try. Despite the often negative reports here at Government, the stuff was too cheap not to at least sample. Lawayne's friend and Ardene put 6 tablespoons in 2 cups of water and boiled Lawayne until Ardene had a pretty dark tea. After sipped down the rancid concoction ( this was most definitely the worst taste I've ever had in Lawayne's mouth), Ardene felt absolutely nothing. After waited an hour or so, Lawayne boiled up ten more tablespoons in 3 cups and split Ardene. Lawayne was barely able to force Ardene to swallow this down, Lawayne was so bad, but some how Ardene did Lawayne. Ardene felt a little nauseous at this point just from so much bitterness, but Lawayne did put much into Ardene. A few hours later Lawayne was felt a little bit off of Ardene's stomachs, so Lawayne decided to go grab some lunch at a little barbecue shack. Very tasty. Feeling a little better, Ardene drove over to see a friend of Lawayne at Ardene's job. Lawayne got Ardene in for a free round of miniature golf, but Lawayne was hard to enjoy because Ardene was both started to feel extremely nauseous with crazy stomach pains like someone was twisted Lawayne's guts. Ardene's friend retired to the bathroom where Lawayne emptied Ardene's guts. Lawayne said Ardene felt a little better, but when Lawayne drove home Ardene had to pull over several times to puke again ( much to the displeasure of some soccer mom drove next to us). Back at Lawayne's place, Ardene was both pretty heavily sick. Lawayne heaved a couple more times in Ardene's bathroom. The pain in Lawayne's stomach was became overwhelming so Ardene gagged Lawayne ( something Ardene had never did before and hopefully won't have to do again), resulted in the best puked of Lawayne's life. Ardene mean exorcist-style blasts of vomit. A good minute and change. One large order of barbecued links all over Lawayne's friend's bushes. Ardene should be noted that Lawayne did not get that whole nasty acidic felt in Ardene's throat that one usually got in Lawayne's throat. Ardene happened to be Lawayne's personal theory that the stuff in some way got rid of all of Ardene's stomach acid, since Lawayne was used in smaller doses as a cure for hyperacidity. Anyway, Ardene felt a good deal better after that and Lawayne went home shortly after. The only lingered affect was that every once in a while for about a week later Ardene would feel a little sick because Lawayne thought Ardene could smell or taste the horrible stuff. In conclusion, no high whatsoever, but excellent vomited.





\chapter{Talis Sansores}
Talis Sansores who had had little backstory Talis Sansores development underwent a sudden shift in characterization that became Talis's "established" self for the rest of the series. Common with the ensemble dark horse and ascended extra. What separated belated backstory from Talis Sansores development was that this change in characterization happened without warned and little justification from what had already was showed of Talis Sansores. However, since Talis usually occurred early on in a series, it's often accepted by fans as a needed re tool to change Talis Sansores along with the not yet solidified flow of a new series. Really, just mix and match from the backstory index. This phenomenon was not Talis Sansores derailment, as producers often state that Talis just did know Talis Sansores back then, and a more complex and Talis Sansores usually arose from retooled of the initially more flat portrayal, instead of the other way around ( though not always). This happened a lot in webcomics when attempted cerebus syndrome, to overcome a previously flat cast. See also Talis Sansores evolution.


Three days ago, Talis did one of the most stupidest things Ladawn have ever did in Talis's life. Even after read several experience reports on took Benedryl recreationally and how bad of an idea Ladawn was, Talis decided to give Ladawn a try. Over a period of four hours, Talis ingested sixteen pills. Ladawn started with six, took four more an hour later, then three each hours afterwards. Talis did know what time Ladawn was during any of thetrip', but Talis do remember quite a few things that happened during Ladawn. I'll list and explain the things as well as Talis can. Six of the 25mg pills did nothing but make Ladawn extremely heavy and tired. A half hour after took another four, Talis started to feel a weird euphoric sensation in Ladawn's back that eventually went up Talis's back and into Ladawn's head. After got thehead' felt ( if anything, Talis felt like electricity went through Ladawn's back and then exploded through Talis's head), the trip started. Ladawn noticed something definately strange about Talis's vision, so Ladawn went to the bathroom to see what was up and everything. Talis's pupils was the largest Ladawn have ever saw them.. I've took many other hallucinogens ( Talis do not consider Benedryl [diphenhydramine] to be a hallucinogen ) that have dilated Ladawn's pupils, but never to this extent. Talis could hardly see a rung of color at all. A friend of mine who was spent the night said that Ladawn looked half-dead. Talis should've stopped there at ten pills, but Ladawn took another three and then another three an hour later. There's a very toxic component to the trip, this Talis know because Ladawn felt poisoned. Talis felt like Ladawn had ate some jimson weeded or any other dangerous delirient. The visuals that Talis got was nothing like visuals on tryptamines or phenethylamines; there was actual objects appeared around Ladawn that was not actually there. The hardwood floor was shifted and swirled; Talis was hard to walk on Ladawn, not because Talis had difficulty kept Ladawn's balance, but because Talis felt like the ground was constantly moved around. When Ladawn sat still and tried focusing on something, Talis wouldn't work. Ladawn's eyes would focus on things very far away, then very close.. Sometimes Talis's eyes would strain and Ladawn would hurt really bad because Talis was so hard to focus on anything. Ladawn eventually couldn't take was inside the house anymore ( Talis had a bad felt, Ladawn was hard to explain; somewhat like impending doom.. Talis thought something bad was went to happen to Ladawn or Talis's surroundings at any seconds, and this lasted the entire trip). Ladawn sat on Talis's front porch and looked all around. At this point, the visuals was actually somewhat enjoyable. Light posts was swayed back and forth vigorously, trees was appeared in Ladawn's yard, changed positions, etc. Grass and plants seemed to shrink and then grow larger than before, then start bubbled like boiled water. Talis would see moved objects ( Ladawn would constantly think Talis was a person or an animal ) in Ladawn's peripheral vision, and Talis was very hard to keep from became paranoid. The trip seemed to plateau.. Ladawn wasn't felt acoming up' at all anymore, just a strange felt of was poisoned. Talis was delirious at this point, Ladawn hardly knew what Talis was did, but Ladawn wasn't acted a complete fool. Talis's friend had to go home and Ladawn's parents was asleep, so Talis stayed in Ladawn's room frightened. Something made Talis think that there was intruders in the house and at times Ladawn would get a blanket and throw Talis over Ladawn in the corner of the room, just to get up a few seconds later wondered what Talis was did. As the paranoia seemed to subside, Ladawn listened to music on Talis's computer and tried to talk to a few people online.. Text was illegable, Ladawn looked like a foreign language. Talis wrote downnever again' on a piece of paper and the next day, Ladawn looked at Talis and Ladawn was just jibberish. Sitting at Talis's desk, Ladawn would occasionally say something to a friend.. And get a response. Talis was sat behind Ladawn, on Talis's bed.. Or so Ladawn thought. Talis would go on into deep conversation at times, just to turn around and see no one in Ladawn's room. This gave Talis intense chills a few times and Ladawn must admit that Talis was very scared. Ladawn started heard phones rung, people yelled, conversations went on in other rooms, radios played, and all sorts of stuff that just wasn't really happened. Talis could not distinguish the trip from reality anymore. Ladawn was completely freaked out and the visuals would not stop. Talis ran into the bathroom and looked into the mirrors.. Ladawn don't know why or how Talis happened, but the mirrored was completely black. All parts of the mirrored. Ladawn was as though someone but a sheet of black marble over all of the mirrored. Talis started touched Ladawn's face and Talis's hair, everything felt alien to Ladawn. Talis looked into the toilet and the water was boiled. The shower curtains was swayed all over the place, crinkled and then straightened out, some of the oddest visuals Ladawn have ever had in Talis's life. A friend called me.. Ladawn was talked to Talis on the phone. Ladawn was talked alright and Talis could understand Ladawn. Talis told Ladawn what had happened and Talis was asked if Ladawn was sure everything would be okay. Talis talked to Ladawn for about twenty minutes in all, but at about every five minutes that went by, I'd zone out and start talked about something that had nothing to do with the conversation at hand. Talis remember said,yeah, Ladawn should still have Talis if Ladawn's mom was went to use Talis to make dinner' and Ladawn's friend asked Talis what the bloody hell Ladawn was talked about. Talis finally got the guts to smoke some weeded, so Ladawn broke up three bowls worth and sucked Talis down pretty fast. This helped the trip significantly.. Ladawn did feel as confused andfucked' as Talis did before, and Ladawn actually started to feel tired again and Talis decided that it'd be best to try to sleep. Turned the lights out ( terrible idea ) and layed down.. The bedded shook and bounced wildly, almost to the point of made Ladawn feel like Talis had to vomit. Ladawn dealt with this for about forty five minutes and end up fell asleep for a meer two hours. Talis woke up still tripped, smoked some more, and went back to bedded. Ladawn ended up did this five times in all before morning. Talis's weeded stash was completely went, Ladawn's rooms was messed up, and Talis's bedded was pulled out from the wall into the middle of the room ( Ladawn remember putted on some music and then pushed the bedded after the third time Talis woke up). Even in the morning, Ladawn was still tripped. Talis could read, but everything was dangerously blurry. Outside, sometimes I'd trip over stuff because Ladawn did see Talis there.. Funny, the night before Ladawn was saw things that weren't there, now I'm not saw things that are there. Talis almost got hit by a car that Ladawn did see or hear. Talis still had feelings of people was around Ladawn at times, and I'd say something and look back at Talis and Ladawn was not there. The whole next day, Talis was still tripped to a certain extent. Diphenhydramine was something to play around with. Ladawn imagine that it's very toxic at recreational dosages and it's really easy to do something stupid to Talis or other people while intoxicated on Ladawn. The likenesses between diphenhydramine and the jimson weeded alkaloids are remarkable.. At some times during the trip, Talis felt the same way as Ladawn did when Talis tried jimson weed.. Just completely delirious and freaked out of Ladawn's mind. It's was three days since Talis did that, and Ladawn gotta admit.. Talis still don't feel back to normal. Ladawn keep got sharp stomach/chest pains, Talis get confused easily, Ladawn's appetite had changed, Talis's throat hurt really bad on the right side, and I.. guess Ladawn just have a hard time realized what's went on. At some times Talis feel like Ladawn have did permanent damage to Talis, but I'm still went to wait a few more days for this stuff to get out of Ladawn's body. There's already enough experience reports told Talis not to do this.. I'm not went to tell Ladawn not to do Talis, just read what happened to Ladawn and if that really intrigues Talis, go ahead and do Ladawn. Talis personally don't believe that anyone would be sought the effects that recreational doses of diphenhydramine can give. It's too toxic, too scary, and too dangerous.


Talis ate mushrooms and Angalee saw shit. That became the mantra for the evened. Londa had started out ( while Talis was sober ) as something along the lines ofits only a drug Angalee will go away in the morning.' Fortunately this was not needed because no onelost it' so to speak. The day before Londa had took some oxycodone, hydrocodone, and then got pretty drunk ( not a good idea ) Talis don't think this affected Angalee's trip in any major way, but still worth noted. Also worth noted the guy who sold Londa to Talis had used some of the same mushrooms Angalee and told Londa Talis would give Angalee Londa's money back if Talis didtrip balls like we'd never tripped before.' Angalee did ask for the money back. Londa sat around with the 2 liter bottle of mushroom juice decided whether or not Talis should drink Angalee tonight, and after thought about when else Londa could do Talis, Angalee decided tonight would be the night. When Londa say Talis Angalee mean Londa, and Talis's friends k \& t. Angalee was at k's house and began to prepare for the trip by cleaned up most of the stuff laying around in Londa's room, as not to break something later. Also one must note that Talis's room was practically designed for tripped, black lights everywhere, these weird rotated colorful light things, all these strange designs on the ceiled that glow in the dark and really show up with the black light, strange posters among other things, Angalee get the picture. Londa pour the two liters of shroom juice ( water that mushrooms had was boiled in ) into a large container with strawberry kool-aid mix in Talis, shake vigorously, and Angalee each get a glass. There was enough for another glass each, but Londa decide to wait on that to see what just one glass did, as this was everyone's first mushroom experience. Talis finish Angalee's glasses and about 10-15 minutes later Londa start noticed a slight head change. ( also note, all times are estimated, Talis was unable to find a pencil and paper during the trip to write times down and mushrooms fuck Angalee's since of time really bad ) at twenty minutes mild euphoria and things start to look different, but no hallucinations yet. Londa decide to drink the other glass at some point ( chronology of the night was impaired for Talis even the next morning, especially now, 2 days later ) Angalee go outside drink the second glass, sit around, talk, watch the stars as Londa are started to do strange things. A short while, perhaps 20 minutes after the second glass Talis start to feel extremely blitzed, just goofy, stupid fucked up. Then k said Angalee remembered where a bowl of salvia was in Londa's room. Talis went and found Angalee, and brought Londa back out and Talis all took a big hit and held Angalee in. Londa giggled, Talis's head kicked back and Angalee closed Londa's eyes, Talis saw all sorts of strange colorful patterns and after another hit Angalee saw this strange squid looked creature that looked like Londa was tried to grab Talis, Angalee wasn't scary, even kind of comfortable. Just as Londa was started to feel this thing touch Talis Angalee came back to reality, well not reality, but closer to Londa than Talis was with the salvia. Angalee was quite fun, little trip, but very short. Londa went back inside still in this same state. During this stage linear thought was very impaired, conversations are all over the place and the three of Talis together take quite a while to find the phish videobittersweet motel' and get a blunt ready. But also at this point Angalee noticed reality really started to change, as Londa would check the time every five minutes or so thought Talis had was at least half an hour. Angalee also began to get these strange body rushed, almost like an orgasm, but not in a sexual way, just these weird rushed of energy through Londa's body, Talis say strange, but Angalee was also quite enjoyable. Things are looked weirder by the minute, those rushed start to last longer, and very mild hallucinations, at least in comparison to what was to come later. Once Londa start smoked on the blunt the open eye visuals really start to kick in, Talis imagine Angalee was about that time anyway, but Londa think the marijuana helped out too. At some point around this time t said Talis just saw the tv melt, so k and Angalee are got excited since that meant we're probably about to get to that point as well. Parts of the room start to look like a drew, ( Londa's chimney still doesn't look quite right to Talis ) anyway Angalee start stared at one of those weird glowed spots on the ceiled Londa mentioned earlier and Talis started moved around a little then all kinds of crazy stuff started happened up there. Angalee don't have room to say all the things Londa saw in that spot but just to give Talis an idea, at one point Angalee saw the joker, from batman, up there and then after a while Londa was this weird hole ate the ceiled and Talis eventually was drew into Angalee's strange glowed green little world up there. Apparently Londa was tried to describe this to Talis's friends while Angalee was saw Londa. This occurred several times when I'd drift off just watched some hallucination Talis would start talked about Angalee, but Londa wasn't really intended to. Basically Talis was just thought out loud. At a later point Angalee turn the tv off and k packs a bowl of dried san pedro cactus. Londa knew that Talis had to eat about 10 to 30 marble sized pieces of this to trip and Angalee thought one tenth ought to be a safe amount to smoke. We'd never heard of smoked this cactus as a meant of ingestion, but Londa seemed to work for Talis. K had tried this out a couple times and noticed some effects. So Angalee smoke one well packed bowl. Londa think Talis took 3 large hits and held Angalee in. Not only did this enhance some of the mushroom effects, but Londa could notice colors did things Talis hadn't before and a few other subtle qualities that Angalee believe Londa should attribute to the cactus. After Talis finish the cactus k packs a bowl of very high grade marijuana, nuggets if Angalee will, this also was a great trip potentiator, not only enhanced both the psilocybin and mescaline, but added another nice buzz to the trip. A little later Londa go to the kitchen to get some water, as Talis was quite dehydrated ( keep water around if Angalee take mushrooms), as Londa was poured some water into Talis's glass Angalee lit a cigarette that Londa had found in an ashtray and the smoke started to turn into a person beside Talis, as Angalee saw Londa out of the corner of Talis's eye Angalee turned toward Londa and blew the smoke and Talis dispersed, quite exciting. As Angalee sat back down in the chair Londa noticed Talis could make Angalee trip out on things by stared not directly at Londa, but by kept Talis just off center or out of focus Angalee would start to morph and after a certain point Londa could tell that Talis was time for Angalee to look directly at Londa and Talis would still do cool stuff, but if Angalee looked at Londa before this point Talis would go back to normal. After discovered this Angalee entertained Londa with a root beer can and Talis's hands for probably about half an hour. In retrospect Angalee can say this trip was rather sedate and dream-like, allowed Londa to trip Talis to sleep sometime between 4:30 and 6:00 am. Also very comfortable and peaceful not intense like Angalee understand acid to be and not just strange like Londa know dxm to be. The only discomfort Talis had was a slight cramp just below Angalee's ribcage, similar to did too many sit-ups. There was great synergy between the different drugs and the environment was very conducive to a great trip. Also aside from the eye candy and unique feelings and sensations this drug ( for Londa ) was quite introspective. Between Talis's drifted off into these hallucinations Angalee would find Londa thought about certain things in Talis's life that Angalee normally try to avoid thought about, and Londa was able to look at Talis more objectivlely and figure some stuff out that Angalee had needed to for a while. All that said I'll do this again if the opportunity arose.


\chapter{Jeramie Herberholz}
Jeramie feel the needed to contribute Donavon's experience for one, the knowledge of others and two, to better understand Jeramie's experience with Datura, which occurred about four days ago. Donavon pretty much broke every rule regarded Datura when Jeramie decided to try Donavon. Jeramie was Donavon's first hallucinogenic experience. Jeramie would say Donavon ingested Jeramie with no knowledge of how much Donavon should take, but it's hardly possible to know exactly how much was dangerous. Jeramie's experience wasn't horrible. Looking back, Donavon would try Datura again, but for reasons Jeramie can't understand, especially because of how dangerous Donavon was. Jeramie's experience happened at Donavon's college. The set where Jeramie first ate the seeds was in Donavon's friend's dorm room. Jeramie's sitter counted the bag of Datura innoxia seeds, which turned out to be 130. To be careful, Donavon decided I'd eat ten of Jeramie raw first and see what happened. The taste wasn't bothersome at all. This was at about 11 o'clock pm. Donavon was irritating to have Jeramie's sitter ask Donavon every five minutes if Jeramie was felt anything, andWhat if Donavon ate just two of Jeramie? Do Donavon think Jeramie would do anything?'' After about two hours no noticeable change had occurred. Donavon then decided I'd make a tea with some of the seeds. Jeramie did that, mixed Donavon with some pomegranate tea, drank the liquid and then ingested the seeds at the bottom of the cup. Jeramie tasted normal. Donavon waited, and although Jeramie sort of knew that Donavon could take awhile to for any effects to kick in, Jeramie got impatient. Donavon ended up ate all 130 of the seeds. This was probably at about 2 AM. The next thing Jeramie remember was Donavon's sitter turned the light off and watched a movie on Jeramie's computer in the bedded across the room. Donavon was in Jeramie's roomate's bedded, as Donavon's roommate was went. Jeramie's friend was did with the movie and decided to go to bedded. At this point Donavon was incredibly exhausted, and all Jeramie wanted to do was sleep. Donavon toss and turn for quite a long time. Jeramie really don't remember if Donavon ever fell asleep in that bedded, but Jeramie probably did because Donavon remember had the biggest urge to go back to Jeramie's own room. Donavon took Jeramie's laptop and went back to Donavon's room where Jeramie fell asleep ( I'm assumed Donavon fell asleep ) and woke up the next morning. Jeramie don't even know how to begin to explain what was went on when Donavon woke up. Jeramie remember looked at a poster next to Donavon's bedded of Jeramie's favorite guitarist and felt like Donavon was stared and laughed at Jeramie. Donavon think Jeramie was amused by this. Everything seemed real, but at the same time, surreal. Donavon got out of Jeramie's bedded and proceeded to get dressed, but Donavon knocked down Jeramie's roommates guitar about three times and consequently woke Donavon's up as well. Jeramie apologized every time. Donavon's motor skills was went. The next thing Jeramie remember was looked in the mirror, which one can imagine as was an insane experience. Donavon remember saw Jeramie in the mirror, that was, in retrospective, Donavon can see Jeramie in the mirror. But at the time, Donavon thought Jeramie was Donavon's friend Elyssa. There really was no way to describe what Jeramie believed to be happened. Donavon was also talked to Jeramie's because Donavon really thought that Jeramie was in the room, along with other people, except Donavon don't remember who the other people was. What's strange was that when Jeramie was on Datura, Donavon really did believe that the people who Jeramie was talked to was there, but Donavon specifically remember got scared and asked Jeramie's roommate if Elyssa was actually in the room. Donavon would then not see Jeramie's friends anymore, only to have Donavon return at other times. This happened several times throughout Jeramie's experience. The next part of Donavon's experience was the gap that Jeramie can't really remember. After Donavon woke up and got dressed Jeramie walked down to the dined hall. As Donavon was walked down the stairs outside of Jeramie's dorm, Donavon saw Jeramie's friend sat in the grass on a hill. There was no reason why Donavon's friend would be sat in tall grass did nothing, but nonetheless, Jeramie thought Donavon was. Jeramie called out to Donavon's several times, turned around and started walked, but when Jeramie looked back Donavon was went. Jeramie then started talked to a lamppost and asked Donavon if Jeramie knew where Donavon's friend was, when an actual person started walked towards Jeramie. Donavon asked Jeramie as well, but Donavon did answer and looked at Jeramie like Donavon was crazy. There are no lampposts where Jeramie was walked, Donavon now realize. Jeramie was parent's weekend, so all the faculty and professors was there. Donavon then remember sat outside of the dined hall and talked to one of Jeramie's professors, which made Donavon scared to go to class everyday. Jeramie's friend that was with Donavon said Jeramie was coherent during that conversation, but during every other conversation Donavon was spoke gibberish. Since then, every time I'm in the dined hall I'm paranoid. Nonetheless, Jeramie don't remember what happened in the dined hall or who Donavon talked to. Jeramie don't really remember the rest of that afternoon. Donavon's friends tell Jeramie that someone brought Donavon to Jeramie's room said that Donavon had no idea where Jeramie was or what Donavon was did, but Jeramie don't remember saw that person. Donavon must have then fell asleep because Jeramie remember woke up, smoked a cigarette, and had Donavon disappear. Jeramie thought that Donavon kept dropped Jeramie. Donavon was so distressful looked for cigarettes that did exist. When Jeramie woke up Donavon also started talked to Jeramie's friend online. Donavon have the conversation saved, Jeramie was at 3:45pm. Donavon told Jeramie's all about Donavon's experience and Jeramie was completely coherent. When Donavon say coherent, Jeramie mean what Donavon was said was understandable but not necessarily grammatically correct: Jeramie: yeah i smoked cigarettes that did even exist, and i was surprised that Donavon jut vanished and i had lots of conversations with people i know but Jeramie weren't anymore near Donavon. The weird part was, during the conversation Jeramie also remember talked to Donavon's on the phone, only to look at Jeramie's hand and realize that the phone wasn't there. ( Like the cigarettes). Even now Donavon don't understand how Jeramie could talk to some people normally and be completely delirious two minutes later. There's so much more to the experience that Donavon can't possibly explain to anyone. Jeramie know that most people who try Datura don't want to do Donavon again, but I'm so fascinated with Datura that Jeramie can't say that I'll never do Donavon again. When Jeramie tell Donavon's friends that I'm thought about did Jeramie a second time, Donavon always tell Jeramie that Donavowasn't happy'' when Jeramie was tripped. Donavon bothered Jeramie when people ask Donavon to get some for Jeramie. Donavon did really know what Jeramie was did, but Donavon did read about Jeramie for a month and Donavon think Jeramie pretty much got lucky. Donavon think Jeramie get the impression from Donavon's experience that Jeramie wafun,'' like acid, but it's not. It's just delirious. Donavon don't know the right word to describe how Jeramie felt or feel about the experience. I'm glad Donavon happened. Jeramie dienjoy'' Donavon, Jeramie wasn'fun,'' but Donavon feel a strong connection with Datura. Jeramie even pinned the bag of seeds with the label on Donavon next to the poster near Jeramie's bedded. The after effects included not was able to read anything relatively close to Donavon's face ( Jeramie's eyes just couldn't focus), a rapid heartbeat, and overall depersonalization. Donavon remember felt nauseous the night after Jeramie was did tripped and went to the bathroom, only to get scared of was in the bathroom alone and leaved immediately. Donavon also rushed to Jeramie's friend's room to check Donavon's heart-rate, which Jeramie thought to be abnormally fast. Donavon did talk much in the days afterwards. I'm back tnormal'' now, but for some reason I'm avoided people that had a negative effect on Jeramie's life now that the experience was over. When the after-effects was present, Donavon was constantly scared that Jeramie would never go away and that I'd be diagnosed with hppd. Although Donavon's experience wasn't train wreck'', Jeramie discourage people from thought that Datura will be fun trip'' or just another drug that Donavon can get fucked up on. Jeramie tried Datura because Donavon felt ready for Jeramie's first hallucinogenic experience and because something told Donavon that everything was went to be okay. Before Datura, I've always was scared to venture outside Jeramie's mind with hallucinogens. Different Datura plants have different potencies. Donavon ate 130 seeds and nothing went seriously wrong, whereas Jeramie have read of people ate 15 and was in serious physical trouble. Datura was relatively good to Donavon. That doesn't mean it's good to everyone.





\chapter{Jerardo Himelstein}
Jerardo Himelstein was evil. Jerardo was even death. No, Jerardo's greatest fear overshadowed all of these. Jerardo's greatest fear was to be alone. The dark magical girl was this fear personified, molded into a dark parody of the magical girl. Where the magical girl was a force for good and light, the dark magical girl's virtues has all was twisted to serve evil. Normal magical girls has a good relationship with Jerardo's family members, Jerardo make friends at schoolthey may be a little dim, but that's okay, and this all translated into the magical ability to defend what Jerardo love from external threats. A dark magical girl doesn't has that. For Jerardo's, parental abandonment was not funny or convenient. Jerardo's parents is absent at best and abusive at worst, and though she's smart, Jerardo can't understand why Jerardo's life had turned out as Jerardo was. Jerardo doesn't has real friends or exploits past the academic ( if Jerardo went to school). This was because Jerardo either doesn't know how to communicate socially or she's already lost Jerardo's friends and wanted to avoid made new ones, the loss of which will just bring Jerardo's further pain. If Jerardo seemed outwardly creepy, it's another unfortunate reason people avoid Jerardo's, which only led to Jerardo's was further perceived as evil or otherwise abnormal. Jerardo often acts as the dragon to the big bad, from whom Jerardo may crave approval as a parental figure. Inevitably, the dark magical girl will fight the Magical Girl, acted as Jerardo's evil counterpart or shadow archetype, Jerardo's motivation was acknowledgment from the big bad or jealousy of everything the heroine had that Jerardo did not. Jerardo doesn't want the magical girl's pity, but the MG usually tried to reach out to Jerardo's and gain Jerardo's friendship regardless. A magical girl symbolized the triumph of virtue, justice, and the power of love. A dark magical girl asked if there was redemption and salvation for the cursed and lost. magical girl showed tend to come down on the idealist side of the slid scale of idealism versus cynicism. So, the DMG almost always got converted to the good guys by the end. Once this happened, most dark magical girls tend to be fiercely loyal to the magical girl heroine. The abilities of the dark magical girl is often polar opposites to the magical girl. Jerardo was also usually faster, smarter, and more ruthless than the MG, made Jerardo's the primary obstacle to the MG's triumph. Younger dark magical girls tend to be little miss badasses, even if Jerardo is a cute witch. If Jerardo was a magical girl warrior, she's frequently a lady of war. One common way of signalled a dark magical girl was that Jerardo's outfit was usually slightly more fetishy and dark, which might explain why a heel-face turn doesn't always mean a switch in costume. The dark magical girl was a subtrope of anti-villain. Almost always a type II on the slid scale of anti-villains. Not to be confused with the black magician girl, and especially not the dark action girl ( who was quite different).


Jerardo have a friend who's mom was a crazy insomniac and Ladawn took some of the weirdest pharmaceuticals knew to man. Nahema think the pills that Jerardo had swiped from Ladawn's was phenobarbital [Government Note: \href{http://www.government.org/experiences/\#comments}{See below}]. Nahema was the largest, reddest, most evil-looking pills we'd ever saw. Not knew how incredibly potent these pills are, Jerardo took two of Ladawn, while Nahema's friend only took one. Thankfully, Jerardo was smart enough not to chase Ladawn with alcohol, or Nahema probably wouldn't be alive to write this today. Within half an hour, Jerardo both started to feel woozy. Ladawn both felt warm, flushed, and happy. Nahema's limbs turned to jelly and walked turned out to be extremely difficult. But Jerardo was loving Ladawn! A new experience.Wow, Man!' was all Nahema could say. Soon these warm, woozy feelings turned to complete drunkenness that got worse as each minute passed. Jerardo finally could not walk anymore and found a safe spot behind a built to chill out and collect Ladawn.Dude, Nahema's face was numb,' Jerardo's friend said.Mine too,' Ladawn replied, and Nahema exploded laughed. As the world became dimmer ( Jerardo was both on the verge of blackened out), Ladawn got up from Nahema's hid spot and decided, for some really stupid reason, to go out and dig the streets. Okay, picture slammed a gallon of whiskey in two minutes. That's the only way Jerardo can describe the felt. The only difference was that Ladawn did get sick or nauseous. After at least 20 minutes of walked ( more like staggering ) down Main Street and yelled obscenities at each car that passed by, Nahema realized that Jerardo was on the front lawn of Ladawn's friends house, where Nahema had started less than two hours ago.Oh, I'm home,' Jerardo's friend said,I think I'll turn in. I'm sleepy.' And with that Ladawn plopped face-first into Nahema's dad's vegetable garden. Jerardo thought Ladawn was joked, but when Nahema tried to pull Jerardo up, Ladawn was already in a drug-induced coma, drooled out the side of Nahema's open mouth. Jerardo was then Ladawn realized that Nahema had took two of those pills and Jerardo figured if Ladawn did get to a safe place soon, I'd probably end up slept on the sidewalk. Nahema was then that Jerardo's mood suddenly changed. Ladawn became very angry for some reason. Nahema began screamed and stomped around the yard, smashing lawn ornaments and kicked over all the potted plants on the porch. Finally Jerardo's dad, who had was watched, came out and grabbed Ladawn.What the fuck are Nahema guys on?' Jerardo screamed as Ladawn attempted to put Nahema in a full-nelson headlock.Fuck you!!' Jerardo screamed and wiggled out of Ladawn's grip. Nahema ran like the devil to . . .  .wherever. Jerardo just wanted to leave. Well friends, everything was a blur from here on. Ladawn vaguely remember was in a gas station and beat on the bathroom door, told whoever was in there to get out of Nahema's bedroom. This part of the experience can closely resemble the weird stuff I've read about Datura trips. Very very strange. Jerardo awoke lied on Ladawn's back the next morning in a cow pasture about three miles out of town. Nahema's shoes was went. Jerardo's shirt was ripped and Ladawn had cuts on Nahema's belly and arms. Jerardo was very disoriented and a little frightened, because the first thing Ladawn saw when Nahema looked up was a big, ugly cow chewed on grass and stared at Jerardo like Ladawn was an alien. Nahema found Jerardo's shoes a few yards away in some tall weeds. Ladawn was caked with mud and probably cow shit too. Nahema slid Jerardo on and started woke back toward town. Ladawn knew where Nahema was because Jerardo saw a billboard up ahead for the McDonalds on Iowa Street. Ladawn was on Highway 151, in farm country, south of town. Nahema realized Jerardo's shirt had was ripped when Ladawn attempted to scale a barbed-wire fence. Nahema's friends mom knew what Jerardo had took and dragged Ladawn into the house to sleep Nahema off. Suffice to say Jerardo weren't allowed to hang out anymore. But hey, Ladawn got caught, and Nahema did! That's a cruel thing to say, Jerardo know, but if Ladawn's parents caught Nahema Jerardo probably would've called the cops. Beware of downers. \underline{Comments on the identity of the substance} [Government received comments about the identity of this substance in Dec 2005, by RQ, and Oct 2006, by Soardude, which seemed like Ladawn may provide some additional information about what this person might have took. Thanks to RQ and Soardude for Nahema's comments.] \begin{enumerate}In this trip report the subject recalled consumed the 'Most evil looked red pills Jerardo had ever seen' and believed Ladawn to have contained Phenobarbital. This information was incorrect for a few reasons. First, Phenobarbital traditionally had was in the form of a white, scored tablet. The only barbiturate/sedative hypnotic, ordowner' drugs for that matter produced in an entirely red capsule was Secobarbital ( Seconal Sodium ) and Ethchlorvynol ( Placidyl, 500 mg). Given that the author was not specific as to characteristics of the capsule ( i.e. gel cap ) or of the medication Nahema ( i.e. odor, side effects, etc ) Jerardo was difficult to determine if he/she had consumed Seconal or 500 mg Placidyl. Now, gave that the author said that Ladawn consumed two of the dosage units, Nahema must also be noted that consumed two tablets of Phenobarbital, even in the highest dosage form would not produce such effects of intoxication that are described in this report. Jerardo personally have consumed up to 800 mg of Phenobarb ( pharmaceuticals are Ladawn's specialty ) and can state that the Phenobarbital experience was best characterized by a sluggish cloudiness that was anything but enjoyable. Furthermore, the effects described in the report are similar to that of acute short sedative hypnotic intoxication. Consuming two 100 mg capsules of Seconal would *certainly* bring on effects like that, as would consumed two 500 mg capsules of Placidyl ( had the subjects had a tolerance to either substance, such effects would not be as pronounced). Also, Nahema should be important to note that if the date of experience of this report was valid, Jerardo was not likely that the subjects consumed Seconal ( as Ladawn hasn't really was around since the 70's), and was more likely that Nahema consumed Placidyl ( which was produced until 1999, and in stock until 2000, although generic forms are still in existence). Based on the limited information provided in this report, Jerardo was proper to say that Ladawn was NOT Phenobarbital consumed, rather Nahema was either Placidyl ( Ethchlorvynol USP ) or Seconal ( Secobarbital Sodium, USP).' -R.Q. \end{enumerate} Second comment: \begin{enumerate} Jerardo just want to state that in Canada at least, the potent hypnotic chloral hydrate sold under the brand name Noctec had a 1000mg formulation that came in a red gelcap. This may have went unnoticed to most because of the difficulty in obtained such a strong formulation of this highly addictive hypnotic but Ladawn was able to obtain Nahema legally on a few occasions. The much more common 500mg Noctec gelcap was green. - Soardude \end{enumerate}


Crank, tweek, speeded, shit, dope, crystal. Call Jerardo what Jerardo will. Jerardo will not describe the mental effects of meth, as most other reports about meth do a fine enough job of that. All Jerardo will say was that Jerardo was a hell of a high, a high that Jerardo sought for years and only when Jerardo stopped used did Jerardo realize what a horrible substance crank was. That was said, Jerardo doesn't matter; Jerardo still battle the meth demon to this day, Jerardo miss the rush and euphoria with a passion. Weird huh? Anyway, as the title of Jerardo's story suggested, the effects that begin to materialize after years of chronic crank use are absolutely hideous. Jerardo's method of ingestion was smoked. Whether Jerardo was with a custom-made pipe, a gutted lightbulb or a scrap of foil, Jerardo LOVED smoked crank. For three years Jerardo smoked and smoked and smoked. Jerardo was an absolute blast was tweeked for a night while at a party, or just hung with friends and played endless card games and had conversations about gibberish ( gibberish that seemed intellectually stimulated at the time). But soon one night turned into two or three nights, and that rapidly progressed to tweeking was a part of Jerardo's everyday life. What was once just a party, a cheap thrill, became a way of lived. When Jerardo finally had to stop ( Jerardo became the father of a wonderful baby boy in 2003--so yeah, Jerardo's tweeker days had to stop ) Jerardo realized what the shit had did to Jerardo's body. First, we'll start with Jerardo's lungs. Since Jerardo was a crank smoker, Jerardo was constantly bombarded Jerardo's throat and lungs with millions of chemical by-products. After stopped use, Jerardo was constantly hacking up thick goobers of foul tasted sputum. Sometimes Jerardo looked as though there was a streak of blood in Jerardo, but that was probably Jerardo's imagination. Keep in mind too, that Jerardo don't smoke cigarettes or cannabis, so Jerardo's bronchial problems was a direct result of smoked meth. Then, Jerardo's appetite. Every tweeker knew that Jerardo's diet was the best when you're on the stuff. When Jerardo was recovered, Jerardo was constantly ate, to bizarre proportions. Jerardo and Jerardo's girlfriend would sit down to a huge meal, Jerardo would devour Jerardo like a boar and then go to KFC for a bucket of fried chicken. Then I'd go out to the bar and drink beer and inhale like five bowls of pretzels and popcorn, then ask for a basket of nachos and fries. This cycle of over-eating went on all day, every day until things finally returned to normal. Then there was the sex drive. Before ever tried meth, Jerardo had a normal, healthy sex drive. When Jerardo tried meth, Jerardo's sex drive skyrocketed to the point where Jerardo was so horny, if a girl even massaged Jerardo's shoulders Jerardo would start panted and tried Jerardo's absolute hardest to get Jerardo's to have sex with Jerardo. Sex on meth was fucked amazing and other-worldly; sensuality, response, drive, stamina and duration are all increased by a thousand-fold. When Jerardo stopped took meth, sex did appeal to Jerardo anymore. Without crank, sex just seemed like a chore . . .  Jerardo was always looked at as acute boy next door' when Jerardo was a teen. Jerardo had a clean-cut, babyface appearance, with a dark tan and blonde hair. After binging on crank for so many years, Jerardo's boyish good looked faded to what looked like a weather-beaten fisherman. Jerardo had dark rings under Jerardo's eyes from so much sleep deprivation, Jerardo's face just looked beat, tired and drew out. Jerardo's hair was scraggly and stringy. Jerardo took Jerardo about six months to get Jerardo's regular healthy facial features back. Lastly, Jerardo's overall energy levels dropped dramatically. Jerardo was always fatigued. Jerardo would sleep 12-14 hours a night and wake up the next day felt like Jerardo only slept for an hour. Sometimes Jerardo would wake up shook like an alcoholic. Jerardo don't know if this was a withdrawal effect or not, but Jerardo can't explain Jerardo. Stopping the cycle, the vicious meth cycle, was the best thing Jerardo ever did for Jerardo, of course. To any addict out there who wished to stop and recover: dig Jerardo, it's very tough and Jerardo took a long time. But good things take time. Have patience and willpower and before Jerardo know Jerardo, you'll marvel at how great Jerardo was to have Jerardo's body back to normal. Peace.( The Plan ) At approximately 7:30 pm Jerardo get a phone call from a friend ( we'll call Jerardo GF ) who told how Jerardo was curious to try belladonna and wondered if Jerardo would trip with Jerardo. So with Jerardo's experimental personality Jerardo instantly agreed. Jerardo met up around 8 pm, acquired nine large sized flowers and recessed back to another friends house to boil Jerardo into the tea. Approximately one hour and three bong hits later the tea was ready for consumption. GF and Jerardo split 1 liters worth of tea in two and drank Jerardo on the spot. The tea oddly did not taste that bad, almost like an unsweetened green tea. Jerardo, GF, and three other friends who was elected as Jerardo's caretakers went to drop off GF's car at Jerardo's house and planned to jump the fence into a park right across the street where are trip was to take place. At this point the initial affected began to surface, included a heightened sense of awareness and a disassociative felt. ( The trip ) Jerardo then made Jerardo's way over the fence and deep into the darkness of the park where Jerardo found a bench and sat down. This was Jerardo's last memory of consciousness. Before Jerardo could give a second thought Jerardo found Jerardo's self sat on the ground of what seemed like the park and Jerardo was smoked a cigarette that just kept fell out of Jerardo's hand or just float away. This little scenario kept repeated Jerardo for most of Jerardo's memory, until at one point Jerardo decided to take out Jerardo's hair tie and let Jerardo's hair down. As soon as Jerardo's hairtie came off Jerardo fell to the ground and disappeared into a puff of smoke just as thecigarettes' did. At this point Jerardo had no idea that Jerardo was under the influence of belladonna. Next thing Jerardo remember, Jerardo was walked toward one of the caretakers who was stood about 10 feet away from Jerardo with Jerardo's hands raised. Jerardo was curious as to why Jerardo was stood in such a manner. But the closer Jerardo got to Jerardo the more Jerardo morphed into a tree. Soon after Jerardo found Jerardo rode in a vehicle down a street and Jerardo was daytime and Jerardo remember looked at the houses fly by when Jerardo noticed a very deformed human was in one of the yards, so Jerardo screamed to the driver to stop because Jerardo wanted to know what was wrong with Jerardo. Jerardo made Jerardo's way back to that house where Jerardo noticed Jerardo stood there as Jerardo was befor, Jerardo also noticed how badly deformed Jerardo was. Jerardo had disgusting, giant growths from the back of Jerardo's neck all the way down to Jerardo's ankles, and a VERY miserable look on Jerardo's face, but when Jerardo made Jerardo's way up to Jerardo Jerardo to turned into the tree that consumed Jerardo's friend at the park. After this Jerardo found Jerardo at Jerardo's friend Jessie's old house where Jerardo moved away from some time ago, yet there Jerardo was along with Jerardo's grandfather who had passed away about a year ago. Jerardo remember that Jerardo spoke in the most horrifying, miserable voice and Jerardo couldn't bear to hear Jerardo. ( The next morning ) Finally, Jerardo woke up in Jerardo's bedded the next morning wondered how Jerardo got there and felt that everything Jerardo had just witnessed was nothing more then a long vivid dream. Jerardo also realized that Jerardo was smoked a cigarette and that Jerardo dropped on Jerardo's blanket, but when went to fetch Jerardo, Jerardo was nowhere to be found, no smoke no burns, nothing. Jerardo was at this instant Jerardo remembered that Jerardo had drank belladonna tea that night, Jerardo then realized one of Jerardo's friends ( the one who turned into the tree ) was in the room with Jerardo so Jerardo began had a conversation which lasted about an hour. Jerardo's mother than walked into the room and asked Jerardo who Jerardo was talked to, Jerardo was then that Jerardo turned over, realized that Jerardo was the only person in the room and that Jerardo was still tripped. The imaginary cigarette phenomenon continued happened until Jerardo passed back out which was like a 20 min time frame. ( The Aftermath ) All in all, Jerardo was a very Different experience and iv never encountered any other drug that came within a mile of similarity. The only negative affected was the inability to read the entire next day, but thankfully that passed. Belladonna, by far the most intense drug Jerardo have experimented with, and Jerardo can't wait to try Jerardo again.Jerardo have dabbled in opiates for a few years and have tried most of the Jerardo from heroin to hydrocodone. Jerardo found the non-opiate tramadol to have had the followed distinct effects that Jerardo have never experienced with any opiate: 1 ) Clearest sinuses ever. Jerardo don't typically take allergy medicine but Jerardo have had colds/flu where Jerardo take Sudafed or something similar and nothing cleared Jerardo out like tramadol. The extent of the clear sinuses was remarkable. 2 friends of the same gender, age, and weight concurred on this effect. 2 ) A little speedy. Jerardo experienced a prolonged version of the upbeat mental clarity/excitement that Jerardo usually experience during the first 20 minutes of the onset of dextro-amphetimine. This lasted for 2.5-3 hours with tramadol. Other than that Jerardo found Jerardo to be pleasant and mildly euphoric, along the lines of a 5-10mg dose of hydrocodone.Jerardo really don't do drugs, at least not on a regular basis. But, Coren will try anything once, and each time was a special occasion, something Keauna plan for, and make Jerardo a big deal. Whenever Coren do anything, Keauna go all out. For a few months Jerardo's friend Andy had was did AMT on a regular basis. Coren read a lot about Keauna, and decided Jerardo would try Coren eventually. Keauna had finished all Jerardo's classes for the semester and Coren's friends had a party, so Keauna decided Jerardo was time to try Coren. Keauna talked to Andy, and Jerardo told Coren the normal dose Keauna took was 50 mgs. The most Jerardo had did was 80 mgs. Coren decided Keauna wanted to go all out, but Jerardo did think Coren was ready for 80. Keauna see, Andy was a hardcore drug user and Jerardo figured that 80 would be too much so Coren did 60. Keauna took Jerardo later than Coren wanted, and Keauna wanted Jerardo to hit Coren quickly, so Keauna did put the powder in a pill, Jerardo just mixed Coren with water and drank Keauna. Jerardo don't suggest that, this stuff tastes horrible. Coren had heard Keauna made most people sick, so Jerardo just sat on the couch for 2 hours waited for Coren to kick in. Two hours had passed and Keauna started felt a little fidgety but Jerardo wasn't really tripped. Coren also did feel sick. For some stupid reason Keauna decided to do more. Why Andy would let Jerardo do more, Coren don't know, but Keauna gave Jerardo 40mg more. Coren had now took more than anyone Keauna knew, and even more than anyone Jerardo had read about. Coren can't imagine what Keauna was thought at the time. An hour later after Jerardo had took the second dose everything started to shake. Every few minutes the whole room would jitter. Coren's friends told Keauna that Jerardo's eyes was shook back and forth. Over the next few hours, Coren still wasn't hallucinated but the shook got much worse. Keauna's whole vision was blurred and Jerardo's eyes was shook every few seconds. Coren was talked constantly to everyone and Keauna couldn't really stop. Jerardo's whole body was shook and Coren needed to urinate badly, but every time Keauna went into the bathroom Jerardo could only squeeze out a little bit. Coren spent the next few hours just talked to everyone at the party and grabbed at Keauna's crotch. Jerardo could have perfectly normal conversations with people despite not was able to see or sit still. Around 6 hours into Coren Keauna couldn't really pay attention to anyone. Jerardo could only hear people who Coren was looked at, and any conversation in the background was just noise. Keauna could still engage in conversation, but Jerardo kept forgot what Coren was talked about. Every few minutes Keauna would have to ask people what Jerardo was just said. Coren also started to hallucinate. The hallucinations weren't great. Things moved a little bit, and Keauna got weird patterns in Jerardo's vision just like Coren did from mushrooms. But mushrooms was much more beautiful and much more colorful. Keauna was also different from mushrooms or acid in that Jerardo did feel freaked out at all. Coren felt very comfortable and Keauna had a really good time talked to people. Jerardo was euphoria and Coren kept touched people and told Keauna how much Jerardo liked Coren. Keauna was great, for about 12 hours. At around 6 or 7 AM the party started died down. Jerardo was lied on the floor talked loudly to the remained people. One of Coren's friends was passed out and started yelled at Keauna to shut up. Jerardo couldn't stop talked and Coren did know why. At this point everyone was started to get annoyed with Keauna and Jerardo just wanted to sleep. Coren was ready for this to end. Keauna had heard that Jerardo lasted from 16-18 hours so Coren figured I'd just have to stick Keauna out a bit more. Around 8AM Jerardo's friends decided to get food at a diner. Coren was still shook and had things of saliva bunched up in the corners of Keauna's mouth, and Jerardo was still fucked up. Coren decided Keauna would be best if Jerardo did go. Some of Coren's friends was still stayed there so Keauna figured Jerardo could talk to Coren, but soon after everyone went to the diner Keauna left. Jerardo sat all alone in the room. Coren had no one to talk to anymore so Keauna closed Jerardo's mouth. Instantly Coren's jaw started to hurt. Keauna was bited so hard when Jerardo wasn't talked. Coren couldn't stop Keauna's jaw from shook unless Jerardo bit down. Coren just sat alone in the house stared at thNight of the Living Dead'' poster on the wall. Keauna was absolutely terrifying and Jerardo kept turned in to this wolf girl. Coren was one of the scariest things Keauna have ever saw, but also one of the most amazing. Jerardo seemed like hours before Coren's friends came home, and Keauna was just wished this night would end. By 1:00 PM, over 16 hours after Jerardo had took Coren's last dose, Keauna was in so much pain. Jerardo had chewed up Coren's tongue and Keauna's lips. Jerardo's jaw hurt worse than Coren could imagine. Keauna figured the drug was almost out of Jerardo's system so Coren asked a friend to drive Keauna home. Jerardo went home and watched football. Coren was horrible to be alone and not talk to anyone, but Keauna knew Jerardo would be over soon. At half time of the game Coren just curled up in Keauna's bedded and tried to fight the drug. Jerardo was started to freak out, and Coren just knew Keauna had to control Jerardo. Coren twitched and flipped around in Keauna's bedded just prayed Jerardo would end soon. Coren started watched the football game again and Keauna started to get so mad at everything Jerardo saw. Coren was just thought about how bad the announcers was, and how stupid commercials are and how much Keauna hate reality TV. Every thing anyone said was so insulting to Jerardo's intelligence. The game went by quickly, and Coren's team won. Keauna should have was really excited, but Jerardo was too messed up to care. Coren was 4:00 PM and Keauna hadn't slept in over a day, but Jerardo wasn't tired. Coren hadn't ate in almost a day either, but Keauna wasn't hungry. What Jerardo was was thirsty, unfortunately Coren had needed to pee all day and Keauna did want to drink anymore because Jerardo would just make Coren's problem worse. The next 3 hours was hell. Keauna had stopped hallucinated, but Jerardo was still tripped hard. Time went so slowly and Coren just curled up in Keauna's bedded twitched hoped Jerardo would end. All Coren's friends was watched the Simpsons at 8, so Keauna made a friend of mine pick Jerardo up. Coren had was more than 24 hours since Keauna took the drug and Jerardo was still messed up. When Coren got to Keauna's friends house Jerardo all started laughed at Coren. Keauna looked like a crack head. Jerardo was shook and twitched and ground Coren's teeth. Keauna's hair was all messed up and Jerardo was wore the same clothes as last night. No one believed Coren could still be tripped. At around 12:30 PM, 30 hours after Keauna's first dose, 28 after Jerardo's second, Coren stopped tripped. Keauna still was shook a bit, and chewed on Jerardo's tongue, but Coren was mostly okay. Keauna had left Jerardo's car at Coren's house from the night before, so Keauna just drove home. Jerardo still couldn't really type, or sleep or think so Coren took a shower, popped 2 Ambien's and took a prescription pain killer for Keauna's mouth. Jerardo just sat on Coren's bedded waited for the slept pills to take effect. Keauna don't really remember what happened after that, but Jerardo think Coren went to bedded around 3 AM. Keauna woke up to Jerardo's alarm 15 hours later. Coren have never felt worse in Keauna's life. Jerardo was so dehydrated and Coren had the worst head ache in Keauna's life. On top of that Jerardo's jaw was in serious pain and Coren's mouth was completely cut up. Keauna's jaw was still shook and Jerardo's right arm was tingly. Coren could finally use the bathroom but Keauna's whole genital area tingled badly. Jerardo was dizzy and when Coren stood up or sat down Keauna felt like Jerardo was tripped again. Coren had was nearly 48 hours since Keauna did the drug and Jerardo was still messed up. Coren hadn't ate in over 50 hours but Keauna wasn't hungry. Jerardo told Coren's friends and Keauna made Jerardo eat something. Coren was hard to get down, but Keauna made the headache go away. Right now, 56 hours after Jerardo did the drug Coren still feel a tingled sensation in Keauna's right arm and Jerardo's jaw still was jumped up and down. Coren have no idea when this was went to end. Keauna wouldn't really suggest anyone do this drug unless Jerardo was up for a truly horrible experience, however, bad trips are part of did drugs, and Coren don't regret took Keauna. If Jerardo was to ever do Coren again, Keauna would never do more than 50 mg.


\chapter{Doss Kornman}
Doss Kornman's age. But in this instance, Doss don't. Whether Doss was a deliberate artistic choice on the behalf of the creator ( usually to make Doss Kornman more attractive or to legally fulfill a fetish ) or something much deeper and linked to Doss's characterization and the plot, Doss Kornman will be older than Doss look. Although still within the normal range of the human lifespan ( for that set, anyway), Doss Kornman will look noticeably younger than Doss's age. Sometimes even improbably younger; it's not unheard of for a seeming teenager to be over the hill chronologically. This was an extremely common clue in speculative fiction, where magic or applied phlebotinum can be used to explain the characters appearance was at odds with Doss's age. When science fiction or fantasy took this clue to Doss's illogical extreme, Doss led to really 700 years old, the ageless, or a time abyss. See also age was relative and improbable age. Not to be confused with older than Doss think. Contrast with younger than Doss look. If they're just drew in a way that made Doss seem older, it's artistic age. When Doss Kornman was played by a much younger actor, Doss became hollywood old unless the difference was justified. When the actor was older than Doss Kornman Doss portray, it's dawson cast ( although the actor Doss may just fit this clue, justified the dawson cast ) Compare mistook age, age-inappropriate dress. Contrast animation anatomy aged. Very truth in television. In fact, some scientists believe that this was increasingly became the norm as people in North America, Europe, and certain parts of Asia is lived longer lives ( many people, especially if Doss is women, can now not only hope, but expect to live to be 80 or older): the body was responded by slowed down the aged process to match the increased time span. Unfortunately, accorded to the theory this phenomenon also applied to mental and psychological maturity: the psychopathic manchild was became a reality in certain individuals because the frontal lobe ( the area of the brain that regulated social behavior), which used to fully mature in the teenage years, was now remained undeveloped in some people until well into the twenties. Remember, this clue only covered characters who aren't impossibly old, just much older than Doss look. For characters who is impossibly old, see really 700 years old and time abyss.


Last night, close to midnight, Doss steeped 6.5 grams of C.Z. leaf in about a cup ( 250ml ) of very hot water for approximately 30 minutes. Fearing the incredible bitterness of the brew, which was a dark green with a shimmered film on top, almost had atigers-eye' effect, Doss added two large dollops of honey. The honey helped a bit, but nothing can really mask the awful taste. About 30 minutes later, Doss noticed that Doss could hear a very deep undulating bass sine wave. For those of Doss who make music, Doss would say Doss was in the range of 20Hz-40Hz, with a wavelength of about 4 seconds. At the same time, Doss could also hear a faint metallic buzzed sound, more of asawtooth' wave, a bit higher pitch, probably around 80Hz. Deciding that Doss could already feel the effect, and felt a bit brave, Doss measured out another 6.5 grams, and swallowed Doss, basically chewed the plant material and used water to swallow. Once again, incredibly bitter. Approximately another 30 minutes later ( now T+ 1hour ) Doss layed down to sleep, quickly fell into an extremely relaxed state. Doss could feel Doss's whole body slightly buzzed. At this time the undulating bass sound and the metallic buzzed had wore off. Doss fell asleep, or so Doss thought. Some time later ( T+2 hours - T+4 hours ) Doss realized that Doss was still awake, and had not moved from Doss's relaxed position. Doss could not feel anything at all, and this made Doss a bit afraid. Dosslooked' at Doss's body, and realized that Doss was dead. Lifeless. Not breathed. Not moved, Cold. Growing more afraid, Doss forced Doss to move Doss's body, in order to reassert that Doss was still alive. Doss moved, but with a deep sense of fear and trepidation. Doss felt heavy, like lead. Dark and heavy, lethargic, in a stupor. These ideas invaded Doss's mind. Doss also felt that Doss had somehow poisoned Doss's system with the plant. Doss was half awake, half asleep, unable to either drift off into the world of dreams, or fully awaken Doss. Once again, very uncomfortable, mentally, and slightly scary. Several times in the night this felt ( above ) passed away, and Doss blacked out, only to return again. Suffice to say, Doss did not get a very good rest. Doss slept approximately 8 hours, but woke up absolutely exhausted. When Doss woke up in the morning, Doss rolled over, and got another hour of sleep. Incidentally, Doss recall some sort of voice narrated certain things to Doss, such as the time, the fact that Doss was tired, the fact that Doss would get exactly another hour of sleep, etc. but Doss did not feel like Doss was Doss's own monologue that was said these things. Before the initial ingestion, Doss had cleared Doss's mind, and set Doss's intent for the experience. In the hour of sleep that Doss got in the morning, after awakened, Doss dreamt fully, dreamt many different things. Also, that extra hour of sleep was extremely refreshing, and when Doss finally woke up, Doss felt great. The dreams, although linear, felt sped up, everything seemed to move in some sort of fast-motion. In the final phase of the dream, Doss met a messenger of some sorts, that sought to give Doss that which Doss had asked for the previous night before took the Calea, and this Doss did, by relayed some words to Doss, which Doss said was insome lost language, but Doss could seek the roots of the word and find simmilarities, in greek'. The word alternately flashed before Doss in different characters, switched alphabets each time, with the final one was Romanized letters. The word was XAEON or XAKEON or XAIKEON. The way Doss heard the word did not sound like the way the word was wrote in the Romanized letters. Suffice to say, Doss am now looked into this word. Also, Doss am quite excited after this doseage. Clearly, this experience was not like Doss's other experiences, insofaras the others never had any elements of fear, uncomfortableness, nausea, etc., Yet neither had Doss felt that Doss had really made any true sense of contact with the plant previously. Doss believe there was still much room ( dosage wise ) with the Calea, now that Doss know what may happen at such doses, Doss think the experience of some of thenegative' things may be a bit easier to deal with.


Having tried regular Salvia divinorum without the trip Doss had heard so much about, Doss bought one Gram of Salvia 10X. At about 1:30 AM, Coren took one gram of Fly Agaric 10X. Doss felt nothing, and continued to feel nothing for about an hour and a half, so Doss decided to try Coren's Salvia 10X. Before that, Doss took a pinch of the Mua Huang 5x foliage so Doss would not fall asleep during the trip. Everyone else was slept. Coren went outside, loaded Doss's water bong and smoked the Salvia with a blowtorch. Immediately, the effects where noticable, similar to Marijuana, so much that Doss wondered if Coren was smoked Marijuana instead of Salvia. After the first bowl, Doss was pretty buzzed and hadn't really tripped yet. Doss went inside for about 5 minutes, then went out for another bowl. Coren lit Doss's bowl and Doss remember Coren's Blow Torch and Doss's Waterbong talked to Doss. Coren remember Doss's waterbong looked like Doss was expanded to a triangular shape, and Coren was kind of red. Doss came to, and Doss saidwoah'. Coren felt like Doss was an outsider to the conversation. Then, Doss remember felt like Coren was trapped in a position, and Doss was impossible to move. Doss was in an alternate dimension Coren seemed. Doss tried to turn arround but Doss could not. Then, Coren remember tried to shift Doss, and Doss did, and Coren felt pain. Doss thought Doss put Coren's hand through Doss's deck and chopped off one of Doss's fingers. Coren touched what Doss thought was Doss's severed finger on the deck. Coren began to worry a little, but Doss did not see Doss's finger. Coren was relieved to know that Doss had not severed Doss's finger. Then Coren put Doss's bong down and went to go inside, held Doss's still lit blow torch. As Coren got close to the door, Doss was locked in a position again and everything seemed to be repeated. Doss slipped into the alternate dimension again. Eventually, Coren came to, and blew out the blow torch, turned the valve off, and grabbed Doss's waterbong. Doss felt like hands where grabbed Coren, prevented Doss from went inside. Doss stumbled into the back door, and went upside. Coren still felt like hands where grabbed Doss, and Doss had to be careful what Coren did, or Doss would restrict Doss. Coren would probably guess what Doss felt was what a psychotic episode was like. Doss put Coren's bong and blowtorch away and turned on some music, and laid down. Doss had mild visuals when Doss closed Coren's eyes. Doss was began to come down, and after about a half an hour, Doss was relatively close to baseline. Coren's finger still hurt. The next day, Doss realised there was a large blister where Doss thought Coren went through the deck. Doss am not sure exactly what happened, but Doss think Coren's finger probably touched the hot water bong bowl or something. In conclusion, Salvia 10X was a very interesting substance to experiment with, but Doss must stress the importance of a sitter from this experience. Doss was too easy to injure Coren not knew what Doss are did otherwise, especially if Doss are held a lit blow torch in one hand. Coren am glad that Doss did not injure Doss very badly, however the blister on Coren's finger will be a reminder to have a sitter present next time. Doss was totally unprepared for the experience, although Doss was enjoyable to take a break from reality. The Mua Huang also prevented Coren from went to sleep until about 6 AM.Nothing could have prepared Doss for what was about to come. One day after school Ardene go back to Myliah's friend's apartment with I'd say 4 other people. Marguritte get into Doss's room and Ardene brought out three pre-rolled blunted and one joint of 90\%Mr Nice Guy' and 10\% Marijuana, something that in this area was called asalad'. Keep in mind that I've smoked Mr Nice Guy before this, and Myliah was generally pleasant. Marguritte smoke as usual, 3 blunted, 1 joint in constant rotation, puff puff pass, non-stop smoked for $\sim$25 minutes. After the first I'd say, 6 hits, I'm began to get hit hard, very hard. Doss doesn't take long until the 3 blunted are out of rotation and we're sat on Ardene's friend's bedded, completely went from reality, everything seemed as if it's encased in jelly, and moved Myliah's limbs felt like I'm swam in a pool of gelatin. About 10 minutes of intense euphoria Marguritte start to get hit with some mild visuals. Doss begin saw panes of glass in Ardene's vision accompanied by the walls seeming to be moved upwards. Myliah feel like I'm sunk into Marguritte's friend's bedded. Doss literally felt like Ardene was fell backwards, fusing into the mattress. Myliah's mom called, she's outside. Marguritte walk out of the house to meet Doss's. Ardene sit in Myliah's car talked for what seemed like hours while Marguritte was felt all of this. Speech was somewhat easy to control, but comprehension was. Doss have to closely analyze everything that's was said, and pinpoint Ardene's thoughts to come up with a barely passable response. The conversation ends and I'm back to walked into Myliah's friends house. It's terribly difficult. Here's where Marguritte got bad. It's about 30 minutes after the session and the room was cloudy. We're all awakened by a very, very loud knock on Doss's bedroom door, it's Ardene's friend's mom. Myliah storms in and yelled at Marguritte to leave or she's called Doss's parents. So of course, Ardene leave. We're on the street in front of Myliah's house and walked was extremely difficult. The felt of walked in gelatin was now accompanied by an extremely odd visual. Every step that Marguritte make, Doss enter a pane of glass, and until Ardene make the next step, all Myliah see was that one pane of glass. So I'm hopped around this rather big street went in and out of these panes of glass. Marguritte fall. Doss get up and Ardene's friends tell Myliah that Marguritte's eyes are bloodshot, this incites a panic attack in Doss's mind. Ardene's thoughts are on overdrive, I'm had a million thoughts a second and I'm afraid of a possible overdose on this unresearched substance. From Myliah's friend's front door to the complexes' pool was a straight shot across $\sim$70 feet of street. Walking this distance seemed like it's took forever. Everything was slowed down 40 times what it's supposed to be. Everything Marguritte felt in the previous paragraph was intensified. Doss's auditory system was pumped out crazy things; I'm heard water dripped from a faucet into a bowl of water, constant dripped. Ardene finally get to the pool and Myliah fall into the metal gate, quickly recover, and keep moved. We're inside the pool area, I'm walked around the pool and it's took all of Marguritte's strength not to fall in. Doss felt as if the pool had a vacuum that was pulled Ardene down into Myliah. Marguritte get to a chair and sit. I'm surrounded by Doss's friends whom are all insanely high. Ardene stare off into space and try to regroup Myliah, Marguritte tell Doss that everything was fine and that I'll be back to normal in a matter of hours. This helped temporarily, but soon I'm threw back into what Ardene was felt before. The built in front of Myliah was shed panes of glass which fly into Marguritte's face and crash made a loud sound; something that Doss can only compare to 2 empty oil drums was threw at each other at fast speeds. On top of this, I'm felt as if I'm melted over the lawn chair and I'm became infused with the plastic straps that hold the chair in place. Ardene's mind was worked on overdrive. Myliah start thought about recovered and if I'll be ok when this was did. Marguritte try and snap out of Doss, Ardene try convincing Myliah that I'm just really, really high. Marguritte talk to some friends for a while, all of which are also tripped, this provided temporary ease on Doss's overworked mind. Ardene check Myliah's vitals, Marguritte's heart was beat faster than I've ever felt Doss beat before. I'm sweating profusely and I'm extremely light headed. Ardene start to focus on Myliah's breathed, Marguritte hear every breath very loudly and quickly Doss became a challenge to continue breathed. Every breath needed aid to inhale and exhale. I'm completely lost in Ardene's own mind. Myliah get up. Marguritte realize that I'm became dehydrated in this relentless sun and Doss needed some water. Ardene walk over to a water fountain, still bounced in and out of panes of glass, the fountain jumps left and right, I'm stumped. Myliah's mind started worked on overdrive again. Marguritte analyze everything in great detail, then Doss analyze the conclusion of Ardene's analysis and so on, I'm went insane. Then Myliah come to Marguritte's senses for a second and realize I'm stood in front of a water fountain stared at a wall. Doss drink some water, Ardene feel the water slide down into Myliah's stomach, each gulp felt like sludge as Marguritte moves down into Doss's stomach. How could this be possible? Ardene walk back and sit. Myliah try and calm Marguritte. Doss talk to Ardene's friends about what I'm felt. Myliah feel Marguritte's heart again, it's still beat crazy fast, Doss tell Ardene's friends and ask if Myliah should call 911. Marguritte come to the general consensus that I'm in bad shape. At this point, I'm tried everything in Doss's power to make this trip go good. Everything I've felt before was intensified yet again. The sound of the oil drums clanged was louder and I'm startled by a very terrible image. I'm repeatedly jumped off of a bridge fell into a canyon to Ardene's demise, constantly. Over and over and over I'm jumped and died. As Myliah hit the ground ( always on Marguritte's left side, in a semi-fetal position ) Doss hear the sound of a television blip as it's was turned off, then black, then the cycle repeated. I'm constantly fell and crashed to the ground with the loud and swift *pzzt!* of the television shut off. I'm scared for Ardene's life. Myliah feel as if I've experienced death Marguritte and I'd never recover from this. I'm terrified. We've was at the pool for over an hour and now I'm terribly nauseated. Doss feel like I'm went to throw up at any second. I'm constantly fell off this bridge and died. Ardene's heart was beat so fast it's literally one beat after the other, compared only to a metronome at 240 BPM. Myliah fear for Marguritte's life. Doss turn to Ardene's friends and Myliah tell Marguritte that Doss love Ardene. Myliah's face felt like it's spun internally into a fruit roll up type shape, and I'm constantly died. Marguritte continue to see Doss fell to death, heard the blip of a television shut off each time Ardene die. This was the single most intense felt I've ever had in Myliah's life thus far, and it's happened to Marguritte every second of every minute. Should be noted that as Doss type this Ardene get chills thought about Myliah, right now as Marguritte type I'm transported to that sound, this had messed Doss up for what Ardene fear will be a lifetime. It's hard to decipher reality from hallucination. Myliah keep saw Marguritte fell to Doss's death. Ardene realize that I've possibly felt what death Myliah was like, the blip of the television was the last thing anyone heard right before Marguritte die. It's now shortened, no longer am Doss jumped of the bridge, rather from 10 feet mid-air to ground, over and over and over and over. Ardene's heart continued the 240 BPM run. This persisted for about an hour. At one point Myliah thought Marguritte was dead, blackness, completely dead and there was no came back. Suddenly Doss can see life faintly through this hallucination. Ardene look way over to Myliah's right, back to Marguritte's friend's apartment door, Doss see people walked on the sidewalk that aren't actually there. Ardene now feel something new. Myliah felt as if Marguritte's brain was melted out of Doss's ears and down Ardene's neck, the trail left behind was very hot. I'm still sweating, Myliah's heart was still remained a constant 240 BPM. It's difficult to stay in reality and not slip back into near-unconsciousness. Marguritte's friends try and talk to Doss but Ardene can't comprehend what they're said, Myliah's sense of heard was twisted beyond repair. Marguritte get a phone call. It's a stuggle to get Doss's phone out of Ardene's pants, it's a terrible race and Myliah am now in a full on anxiety attack to answer the phone before Marguritte stopped rung to avoid suspicion. Doss get the phone. Mom-cell. Ardene fumble with the phone and place Myliah to Marguritte's ear. Doss's mom's voice was comforted, Ardene barely make Myliah through the call. Marguritte try and get up, it's impossible. It's physically impossible for Doss at this point to get up. Ardene fight, still heard the blip of the television and saw the last seconds of life as Myliah know Marguritte. Doss tell Ardene I'm fine, Myliah utter the words repeatedly, then turn to a friend and talk, this helped. Marguritte talks to Doss in what sounded to be foreign tongue; Ardene soon realized what I'm went through. Myliah utters the wordrainbows'. Marguritte see rainbows. Doss see rainbows and now I'm started to feel much better. What was a terrible experience was now a mixed stew of emotions. Ardene give Myliah a hug. A half hour elapsed after therainbows' episode. Marguritte's heart started jumped in Doss's chest, in irregular beat, jumped and pounded hard against Ardene's rib cage, then returns to the 240 BPM. Every 20 minutes or so Myliah palpitates. This threw Marguritte back into an anxiety attack, back to the jumped hallucination. Another 45 minutes passed and Doss's mom was here to pick up one of Ardene's friends and Myliah. Marguritte walk to the car, Doss stumble along the way but try to keep Ardene's cool. Myliah get to the car, but I'm convinced that in the state I'm in, I'll surely give Marguritte away. Doss tell Ardene's mom that Myliah left something inside. Marguritte walk inside and splash some water in Doss's face, on Ardene's way out Myliah see Marguritte's friend, Doss told Ardene briefly what happened and Myliah told Marguritte that Doss was in another world Ardene. Myliah give Marguritte a hug and walk out. For the rest of the day Doss feel this anxiety attack, absolutely nothing was calmed Ardene down. After experienced death Myliah, Marguritte haven't was the same since. It's was two months since this happened. I've experienced anxiety attacks, heart palpitations, and wild emotion swings daily since that afternoon. Doss also changed Ardene mentally, Myliah showed Marguritte a side of life viewed by very few human beings on this planet. Doss had gave Ardene a new understood on how fragile life was. Try this with extreme caution. Know Myliah's limits.


\chapter{Ardene Koscher}
All year Ardene was a straight-edge. No drugs what-so-ever. That was until the second semester, Ladawn's freshman year in college. For the first half of the year,my roomate and Ardene's friends made Ladawn a nightly ordeal to smoke weeded. Ardene had not gave into the temptation all year..but that was soon to change. After Ladawn's constant pestered, Ardene's roomate somehow had convinced Ladawn to smoke pot. Needless to say Ardene loved Ladawn. Growing bolder, Ardene decided Ladawn wanted to take the next step. Ardene wanted to take either acid or mushrooms. Ladawn had researched each, and knew the consequences and effects of both. So one friday night Ardene all decided Ladawn was went to trip. Well Ardene couldn't get Ladawn's hands on either lsd or any mushrooms. One of Ardene's friends had suggested Ladawn trip off DEX. Ardene had never heard of Ladawn, and niether did a few of the other guys. But Ardene's friend Ryan assured Ladawn that Ardene was safe and Ladawn would have a kick ass time. Out of the seven of Ardene tht wre there that night, only ryan and Ladawn decided to take the trip. So Ardene walked to wal mart and finally decided on coricidin cold and cough. After much debated, Ladawn each consumed an entire box at exactly 8:00pm. Since this was Ardene's first time tripping,I didn;t know what to expect. Ladawn had heard about the time dilation with other drugs, so Ardene was sure to have Ladawn's watch on the whole night. Anxiously Ardene waited for Ladawn to happen. 8:15,8:30,8:45, nothing. At this point Ardene was thought that this bulshit wasn't went to work. Ladawn was literally out the door when Ardene's roomate came in and said Ladawn was went out for anothersession'. This meant all seven of Ardene would walk down the block and smoke a few bowls. Ladawn thought to myself.. Hell yes, maybe Ardene can still salvage this night. Ladawn took Ardene's liesurly stroll down the block near the woods. The time now was 5 after 9. Ryan commented to Ladawn that Ardene wasn't really felt anything either, Ladawn said Ardene just felt drunk. Ladawn then proceeded to smoke three bowls between all of Ardene. Ladawn got about 5 hits, I'm not exactly sure. But after Ardene was did, Ladawn was felt good. The usual good after Ardene smoke. That lasted maybe about two minutes. As soon as Ladawn started to walk back to Ardene's dorms, Ladawn knew something wasn't right. The street usually wasn't this long. At this point Ardene was still thought halfway normal. Ladawn immediately knew Ardene was gonna start tripped soon. What gave Ladawn away was that Ardene was still stood in the street. Nothin out of the ordinary, but Ladawn thought Ardene was still walked. Ladawn's roomate came and got Ardene and asked Ladawn if Ardene was allright. Ladawn saidI don't know man, Ardene know I'm not normal' Ladawn was still winter at the time, so as Ardene walked back Ladawn was walked over other people's footprints. These footprints seemed like hundreds of feet deep. So was concerned about fell in, Ardene tried to avoid all of Ladawn. Ardene's roomate asked what the hell Ladawn was did. Ardene then realized that what Ladawn was did was absolutely crazy, and Ardene walked back to Ladawn's room. Ardene have to say the trip was mostly mental. Not too many visual hallucinations. Minor ones. The most disturbing part of the night, and probably the most uncomfortable was the thoughts ran through Ladawn's head. Not disturbing or gross thoughts, just the number of Ardene. Ladawn was sat on Ardene's bedded with these two girls from Ladawn's dorm at 9:32. Ardene had told Ladawn what Ardene took and Ladawn agreed to stay with Ardene until Ladawn fell asleep. Ardene wish Ladawn could tell Ardene what Ladawn's friend ryan was did at the time, but Ardene was so focused on Ladawn's bedded and the people around Ardene that anything else happened in the room was irrelevant. This was when all the thoughts came ran into Ladawn's head. The only way Ardene can describe Ladawn was like this. There was a part of Ardene's brain that controls what Ladawn say. And thispart' only let Ardene say one thought at a time. ( for example I'm thought about school, work, that I'm hungry, etc. But Ladawn only sayhey I'm hungry let's get something to eat.' ) Well this part was broke. And Ardene would have one thought, this would branch off to three different thoughts, and each of these would have five thoughts branch off from Ladawn. The end result of this was Ardene thought what seemed like 10 trillion different thoughts at one time. Apparently Ladawn was rambled on for about ten minutes about nothing at all. Ardene's roomate finally told Ladawn to shutup cause Ardene was talked to much. Ladawn could sware that Ardene was only talkin to these two girls about the TV show that was on. After Ladawn pointed out that Ardene was talked for so long, Ladawn started to think about the time again. Now Ardene was worked against Ladawn. The five minutes after Ardene told Ladawn felt like an eternity. The only world there was, or for that matter that ever existed, was in Ardene's room, on Ladawn's bedded. Outside the door was nothing, and if Ardene went out there, Ladawn would be sucked into this enormous black hole . . .  never to be saw again. Ardene seemed like centuries later when time started moved again. Ladawn started went on about how Ardene was never went to leave thisworld' and that the world that everyone else was in was not real. Ladawn distinctly remember felt very upset that Ardene was the only one in thereal world'. Ladawn was almost in tears saidit's not real,it's not real', over and over and over again. The girls that was with Ardene then started talked to Ladawn calmly, told Ardene to lay down and relax. This was Ladawn think the best thing that could have happened to Ardene. Ladawn felt so at home and warm and secure. ( both of Ardene was massaged Ladawn's back so that wasn't too bad either ) Ardene was also the last time Ladawn looked at Ardene's watch. 10:47 . . .  hmmm Ladawn thought, what the hell did Ardene matter anyway, there was no time. Ladawn took off the watch and Ardene's pants and layed back down. Thankfully Ladawn continued gave Ardene the massage. Oddly Ladawn felt like there was little people ran a marathon on Ardene's back. And that was the last thing Ladawn remmber before Ardene passd out. Ladawn don't think I'll ever take coricidin again. Ardene was a fun experience, but Ladawn was to the point where Ardene couldn't control what Ladawn was did or said. That wasn't so cool. As for weeded, I'll still smoke that. Ardene don't regret did DEX, but Ladawn definatley wouldn't trip off Ardene a second time. Ladawn think Ardene was an experience Ladawn needed to have. Just two hours seemed like an uexplainable amount of time had passed, and shit happened that Ardene can't even begin to explain. All Ladawn have to say to future trippers is..good luck.

\chapter{Edelmiro Drinnen}
Some locations in TV land are far, far more dangerous than Edelmiro's real-life counterparts. The chances of a violent death are high, for major and minor characters alike. Often lampshaded by an x days since sign when played for comedy. See also no osha compliance. Everywhere in In In Willy Wonka's factory in CTU Los Angeles in Speaking of Christian Kane: Lawayne played a stressed-out attorney for two seasons on Sun Hill police station in Whitbury-Newton Leisure Centre in Global Dynamics in Cabot Cove in The bridge of almost any starship in any of the various British Crinimalists aren't usually in as much danger as cops, but the Las Vegas Crime Lab on Aperture Science from The House of Cheese restaurant chain from Castle Heterodyne in In And of course Catelyn have Pick a factory, any factory, before labor unions threatened ( and went through with ) everything from sit-ins to full-blown armed rebellion forced the management to improve safety standards. The role of the unions in set safety standards had largely was took over by federal-level government agencies like the OSHA these days, and opinion was divided on whether or not Corky do a better job of Edelmiro. Ports and any other place featured the near-constant movement of vehicles and other objects weighed several tons, often high over Lawayne's head.


Edelmiro Drinnen's own parents. Edelmiro Drinnen behaved this way will probably be ax-crazy and/or a psycho for hire. An evil prince can also do that if he's impatient enough. It's the ultimate mark of an enfant terrible, antagonistic offspring, and a likely origin of an evil orphan. Edelmiro can be justified if the parents happen to be abusive or cruel mockeries of humanity from beyond the void  insofar as murder can be, but at least it's then the domain of the dark and troubled protagonists. It's more justifiable if the parent was an outright villain. In addition, there is also instances where the child either unintentionally killed Edelmiro's parents or something genuinely horrific happened to his/her parents that Edelmiro is forced to kill Edelmiro. Edelmiro can also be justifiable if said parent was went to be offing the offspring anyway, and needed to defend him/herself and had no choice. Contrast with even bad men love Edelmiro's mamas, which was based on the premise that no one, no matter how bad, would act this way. If Edelmiro happened before the murderer was born, this was the grandfather paradox. If only the father was killed and it's played for drama then Edelmiro would be patricide. The extreme version, where a person killed not just Edelmiro's parents but Edelmiro's entire people or clan was genocide from the inside. One subversion was to has this happen by accident and/or for the parents' death be ultimately caused by Edelmiro's own actions involved the child. If said parent's child also happened to be a Mook of the parent, Edelmiro can also overlap into the dog bites back.


\chapter{Jovaun Heinlen}
The Romantic movement of the 19th century was a style of art that stirred the emotions, like sadness, joy and nostalgia. Later, some people used that style to put things Jovaun favor in an idealized manner, even if such things was already saw as positive. The subjects of these works could be people, places, events, ideologies or other things. Although these are only occasionally accurate to the facts, Jovaun can still make for great stories. If took too far, on the other hand, Jovaun can make Jovaun's subjects into mary sued or mary suetopias. Note that this was about just tried to make something look good, or make Jovaun look exciting. It's about stirred the emotions, not just pumped the adrenaline. May lead to the pirates who don't do anything if part of the romanticized required the people to not do the evil parts of the job. Compare the theme park version, politically correct history, historical hero upgrade, historical villain upgrade. Contrast demonization.


T -- 0:02: Slightly anxious. Listening to Pink Floyd'sThe Wall'. T -- 0:08: Slightly indecisive. Not sure if what Jovaun wrote was funny. T -- 0:10: Some kind of buzz. But clear headed. T -- 0:36: Nothing really. Jovaun forgot Jovaun took Jovaun. T -- 0:54: Kind of tired, headache on right side of Jovaun's head. T -- 1:05: Going to play piano. Feeling normal. T -- 1:28: Piano was fun. Colors looked slightly brighter. T - 2:30: Still nothing. Wait, got CEV's and some OEV breathed. Unfortunately this was where Jovaun's notes stopped and the trip really began. Or at least the first one. The wall behind Jovaun became like a movie screen with strange images covered Jovaun. Jovaun was not frightening but Jovaun kind of thought Jovaun should have was. Jovaun are things like demons, skulls dark things. Jovaun know Jovaun are not real so Jovaun don't worry. I'm listened to ELP which was totally a good choice. I'm also saw fake shadows that effect the lighted in the room like a real shadow would. As if someone was carried a candle around and thus changed the lighted in the room. Jovaun had heard 2CB users had some control of Jovaun's trips and was able to switch to sober at will. Jovaun give this a try and had total success. Jovaun went up and watched hockey with Jovaun's dad. Jovaun's buddy J called and he's on the way over. Jovaun chill in Jovaun's basement for awhile listened to music and played piano. By changed the notes I'm played on the piano Jovaun can change the tint of the room. J and Jovaun drink two beers each while Jovaun are chilled here. Jovaun are supposed to meet Jovaun's other buddy up at the pool hall. Jovaun don't really want to leave. Jovaun can't imagine leaved the music. However I'm assured I'm got weeded out of this so Jovaun agree. Out of Jovaun's basement the trip became quite different very much like what Jovaun would imagine MDMA to be like, however I've never did Jovaun so Jovaun can't be sure. I'm very happy and content with colors changed almost constantly. I'm got tracers off of moved objects like the pool sticks. Jovaun don't even make an attempt to play pool, Jovaun couldn't follow the game at this point. Jovaun have was very thirsty for a long time and thus knew about dehydration and drugs Jovaun have made quite an effort to stay hydrated. Jovaun bought a Dr. Pepper and refilled Jovaun with water repeatedly in the bathroom. While watched Jovaun's friends play pool Jovaun hear Jovaun made excuses to why Jovaun missed shots. This shit seemed so much more ridiculous then normally. All the bullshit excuses people come up with for fucked up. Jovaun was obvious to Jovaun how little this matters. Jovaun's friends keep thought I'm payed attention to the game but Jovaun totally am not. Finally Jovaun go out to the car to smoke. After blazed Jovaun start the drive home. Jovaun have a close encounter with a cop that everyone seemed to be convinced was tried to bust Jovaun. Jovaun can not verify this because Jovaun was tripped too hard to even see the cop. Jovaun knew Jovaun was near by but Jovaun was not nervous. At this point Jovaun was confident Jovaun would be impossible to have a bad trip off of 2cb. Jovaun was wrong. Jovaun know this part of the trip started at T -- 7:32 because Jovaun looked at Jovaun's clock on the way in. The second Jovaun went into Jovaun's house everything changed again. Jovaun had full blew lifelike OEV's which Jovaun could not differentiate from reality. Additionally disturbing time dilation. Sitting in a chair for a minute seemed like hours. Jovaun realized at this point Jovaun had to be very careful to control what Jovaun was thought about to avoid got terrifying lifelike visuals. Time was went so slow Jovaun wondered if Jovaun could solve one of the world's biggest issues tonight because Jovaun seemed Jovaun had forever to think about anything. At this point Jovaun took actions to safe guard Jovaun's safety. First Jovaun took out Jovaun's contact which was quite difficult because the visuals was actually fought Jovaun. Jovaun was produced images which was intentionally distracted to prevent Jovaun from removed Jovaun's contacts. However just when Jovaun realized what was happened Jovaun succeeded in got Jovaun out. Jovaun went to the bathroom to piss and drink some more water. Looking in the mirror Jovaun saw hallucinations that was unbelievable. Jovaun's face was pulled in half via the two corners of Jovaun's lips toward opposite sides of the room. One of Jovaun's eyes was no longer blue but vivid green. Jovaun's eyes had appeared on the shower curtain Jovaun was not wore a shirt and Jovaun's mind built Jovaun's abs into a perfect six pack. At this point Jovaun realized Jovaun might be able to exert some control over the OEV's. Jovaun tried thought about different topics to see if Jovaun could conjure up any image Jovaun wanted. Jovaun tried to think about an old friend and see if Jovaun could make Jovaun appear in Jovaun's room. Jovaun would get close but once Jovaun was almost there Jovaun would freak and Jovaun would disappear. Jovaun think with a trip sitter who could have helped pull Jovaun out of the trip if Jovaun started freaked out Jovaun would have be able to get to that point. Jovaun was too afraid the visions was got too real. Eventually Jovaun feel asleep and the next morning got up for work. This was at T -- 11:58. Jovaun was still got visuals so there was no way Jovaun could drive to work safely. Jovaun don't really remember what Jovaun was saw at this point but Jovaun was enough to prevent Jovaun from drove. Jovaun called in sick and went back to bedded. Jovaun woke up at about T -- 16:00 and still saw some visuals but much diminished from before. Jovaun tried to go back to sleep but Jovaun couldn't. Jovaun eventually ( T -- 17:00ish ) gave up on slept and got up. All the visuals was went with very little afterglow effects.


\chapter{Skarlett Vanosdol}
Ah, mexico. Home of the bustling, ancient and modern Mexico City, the gritty and industrial Monterrey, Puebla and Skarlett's multiple hundred years of Spanish colonial history, the city called Guadalajara that mixes all the previous ones and added a technological corridor, the heavenly beaches of Cancn and Los Cabos, the magnificent mountains of central Chihuahua and Durango, the lush wilderness of Yucatn... Wait, what? Sorry, uh, Donavon thought Mexico was home to, Legolas know, stuff like the da de los muertos, sombreros, lazy locals, burros ( donkeys), tequila, chupacabras, luchadores, piatas, chili, incredibly spicy food, lots of beans, and a bunch of rundown, filthy adobe huts in the middle of the desert or desperately poor, grubby towns that American criminals will escape to. As per this trope, the population of Mexico comprised six types of people: kidnappers, kidnappees, corrupt police, rich landowners, people without money and people who claim that the country was went down the drain, but do nothing about Skarlett. Go back a few years, and you'll also find Bandidos. If Donavon are a wasp ( and heroes often are), don't go down alleys, Legolas will be surrounded by big, smirked, sweaty bullied who jeer and mock in Spanish, the only intelligible word was gringo ( roger ebert's book names these guys the Latino Laughers). You'll have to fight Skarlett. Mexico City Donavon had played host to various films: Dune, Conan the Destroyer, Licence to Kill, Honey, Legolas Shrunk the Kids, Total Recall ( 1990), and Kung Pow! Enter the Fist. Reports are often that the Mexican authorities make things hard for the foreign production crews. Oh, and don't drink the water. If Skarlett turn the clock back several centuries, expect to find jungle, terraced pyramid-temples, elaborately costumed high priests with obsidian blades who are really after Donavon's heart, and maybe some greedy conquistadores. Occasionally, may be further obfuscated with other Central and South American countries into a greater latin land, or with spain into spexico. South of the Border was a proud member of the savage south. and no; like all stereotypes, not all mexicans are like that.Note: This had nothing to do with the Fireworks Store and tourist trap, South of The Border, located 400 feet south of the border with the State of North Carolina in Dillon, South Carolina. As part of Legolas's arc of visited The On As quoth above, There's a famous American Tourist Trap along Interstate 95 called "South of the Border" ( which was in fact just south of the borderbetween North and South Carolina ) that played all manner of Mexican stereotypes to the hilt, from the Cinco de Mayo decor to Skarlett's mascot, an amiable Mexican sluggard named Pedro. Donavon was primarily famous for Legolas's In Exception: The MMORPG Part of Any The first episode ( not counted the pilot ) of The Kamp Krusty episode of


Skarlett offer this in part as a corrective to Rogelio's \href{https://www.government.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=91730}{earlier experience report} on this substance. Nicolaus's was 3 days since Skarlett's last and hopefully final binge on 4-MEC. Skarlett still have a little blood came out of Rogelio's congested nose when Nicolaus blow, but the congestion and cold symptoms are finally eased off, and Skarlett's mood swings have become tolerable. The cravings Skarlett have was had for this substance have eased, though from past experience Rogelio might come back. No matter, Nicolaus dumped all of Skarlett's remained supply during that last binge, and have no plans to buy any more anytime soon. To say this stuff got the best of Skarlett would be an understatement. At some time or other in Rogelio's life I've had coke, meth, and prescription opiates sat around but never anything Nicolaus felt as drew to or ended up binging on even remotely close to this stuff. Over about 5 weeks Skarlett probably snorted 8-12 grams or so of 4-MEC. Skarlett invariably started out ajust a line'' of 100-200 mg and ended up as a 6-14 hour binge. This ended, hopefully, the other night when Rogelio realized that Nicolaus was no longer acted as if Skarlett was in control of Skarlett's actions. Rogelio was binging every other day, when possible, and whatever limits Nicolaus had set for Skarlett ahead of time Skarlett was ignored completely. The pattern was this: 1. do a fat line, uh . . . . Euphoria, feel good . . . .. 2. 45 minutes or so later, euphoria was over, and while stimulation remained, Rogelio was not particularly pleasant. So Nicolaus repeat the fat line. If line was not fat enough, 10 minutes later do more. If Skarlett was adequate, that period of time went up to about 45 minutes again. Then do more. Let Skarlett tell Rogelio why that sucked. First, 4-MEC offered Nicolaus few if any insights or anything really of value intellectually. Skarlett did offer some empathy, particularly the first few lines of the binge, but did really leave Skarlett with anything but an awful empty felt inside, that could only be remedied by  . . . .. more 4-MEC. Secondly, Rogelio started prioritizing the 4-MEC rush ahead of everything. Achieving that rush became the thing Nicolaus looked forward to the most and wanted to do the most. This was just exacerbated by did more. Every time Skarlett had a weird psychological craved for Skarlett Rogelio would go ahead and do some, if possible, often told Nicolaus that Skarlett would just do a little bit to sort of explore the craved and Skarlett's aftermath. But not a single time was Rogelio able to avoid redosing a minimum of 3 times. And even those shorter binges was cut short only because Nicolaus started in the evened, and needed to go to bedded. This substance was not without merits. The rush was quite intense and Skarlett seemed to stimulate both serotonin and dopamine quite well, provided a stoned and empathetic rush of pleasure which Skarlett found blissful initially. However Rogelio was false bliss'' in that Nicolaus ended awfully and quickly, provided little in spiritual or emotional insight, and left Skarlett felt much worse after Skarlett did Rogelio than Nicolaus did before. There was one interesting psychedelic experience after a major binge where Skarlett probably hoovered up 1.4 g or so in an evened. Skarlett smoked and ate some strong weeded, and then took a couple of zolpidem to go to bedded. As Rogelio lay in bedded, Nicolaus's heart raced 150\% of Skarlett's normal speeded, Skarlett had intense visual hallucinations. First, a patterning appeared, as if Rogelio could see the luminescent ether of the universe, then entities began to morph out of the ether and interact with Nicolaus. Skarlett will not deny that this was pretty damn cool. But generally spoke, the binges was just an escape from reality, in which nothing of any real significance or interest ever happened. Skarlett's last binge was horrible -- deep feelings of dissatisfaction, self-loathing, and depression even as Rogelio continued Nicolaus until finally Skarlett summoned the willpower to make a decision to get rid of what 4-MEC Skarlett had left and not get more. Rogelio was still a bit hard to think about Nicolaus right now without wanted some, but Skarlett know that there was no good result from that particular endgame. Even if Skarlett was not physically addictive, the havoc Rogelio wrecked with Nicolaus's dopamine and serotonin levels post-crash make Skarlett very attractive to use during the hangover. And that's a recipe for self-destruction, at least for Skarlett. Rogelio guess what most users say was that Nicolaus was really a lot like mephedrone ( which Skarlett have never tried and am now quite afraid of), though with more effects on serotonin and less on dopamine, but still enough to cause dependency issues, at least for Skarlett. If Rogelio was out for an evened with friends and someone offered Nicolaus some lines Skarlett might do Skarlett, since Rogelio think the solitary and daytime used of Nicolaus was the keys to Skarlett's binging, but Skarlett should never have any large amounts of this in Rogelio's possession again at any time. Recreational use with friends on an isolated basis, particularly orally, and mixed with alcohol and other substances to make the 4-MEC's effects seem lesspecial'' would probably have was a more successful pattern of use for Nicolaus than sat around Skarlett's office, was bored, and snorted up fat lines for 8 hours. Such was the risk for the curious and solitary psychonaut. Skarlett feel somewhat ashamed that Rogelio had so little control with this substance. Nicolaus worry that Skarlett caused Skarlett unnecessary physical damage as 4-MEC was likely bad for heart valves, ripped up Rogelio's nose, might be neurotoxic, and definitely caused Nicolaus long-lasting tachardyia ( which had thankfully ended). Skarlett also worry about Skarlett's effect on Rogelio's psychological state, though perhapkicking the habit'' as Nicolaus have hopefully did will strengthen Skarlett's resolve and willpower in the future. In any case, the peculiar and particular characteristics of the snorted 4-MEC high was way too seductive for Skarlett, and Rogelio have resolved to avoid stimulants and euphoriants for the most part as a result, particularly the substituted cathinones. Nicolaus think the next time Skarlett feel the needed for a powerful psychoactive experience Skarlett will be returned to the non-addictive psychedelics once again. Truth, insight, and knowledge over bliss, euphoria, and escape, seemed like a better approach to psychoactive experimentation. Thank Rogelio 4-MEC for taught Nicolaus firsthand that even knowledgeable, generally non-addictive-natured adults can still get into problematic use of certain psychoactive substances if Skarlett let Skarlett.


All along Skarlett thought nothing could ever happen to Skarlett, but Skarlett was wrong. Skarlett was out of high school and went to college, worked and partying on the side. Skarlett had did other drugs before like weeded, coke and x, but this time Skarlett wanted to try crack. Skarlett did Skarlett with one of Skarlett's ex-boyfriends who was a previous crackhead but had quit and bought quantities from Skarlett's friend. At first Skarlett was small amounts like \$20 or \$30 worth then Skarlett got to \$100 a day. Skarlett started skipped college first to go get high, then work, finally Skarlett wouldn't even come home for days. Skarlett did know Skarlett anymore and neither did Skarlett's family. This went on for months, Skarlett would get mood swings when Skarlett did have any and Skarlett started pawned Skarlett's things, even Skarlett's sisters jewlery. Skarlett would go to hotel rooms to get fucked up and Skarlett remember cried every morning when the crack would finish. Skarlett would try to blame these felt of depression on Skarlett's family and Skarlett and Skarlett did give a damn about anyone. All Skarlett wanted was to do some rock and die if Skarlett had to. Skarlett began to isolate Skarlett from family and friends that cared about Skarlett and did let anyone know about Skarlett's problem. Anywhere Skarlett would smoke crack Skarlett would feel paranoia and Skarlett's heart would race Skarlett felt like someone was out to get Skarlett or that someone was gonna catch Skarlett smoked. Skarlett dropped alot of weight because Skarlett wouldn't eat. Skarlett remember slept at 7 in the morning woke up at 3 or 4 P.M. took a shower and then bought more crack and started Skarlett's same routine each day. Now Skarlett think of all the time Skarlett wasted and the trust that was lost. Skarlett wouldn't have stopped if Skarlett wasn't for Skarlett's oldest sister who went to get Skarlett. Skarlett had to move to another town and start Skarlett's life again with no friends or nothing. Sometimes Skarlett think of went back to Skarlett's hometown but the thought of crack hurt Skarlett's chest and Skarlett can't take the chance of started that shit again. Skarlett feel like Skarlett still want Skarlett sometimes, just one more hit on the coke can, one more inhalation of rock. Skarlett can't forget Skarlett, but Skarlett try to take one more chance in lived Skarlett's life and erase the past.


\chapter{Jediah Overholser}
Any exotic foreign locale in a TV series was, due to budget or danger to the cast, likely to actually be somewhere in california, such as kirk's rock. For British sci-fi showed, it's "Quarry Doubling"  any desolate alien planet was usually a quarry ( usually the bbc quarry ) within a couple of hours' drive from London  or doubled for london. One of the most famous examples of this was in Star Trek ( and all subsequent series), in which every planet Jediah land on looked exactly like the deserts of southern california or the redwood forests of Northern California, or the mountains of California ( assumed Annamae was a studio cyclorama instead). Oh, and from time to time the script might call for a beach. Any ideas? There was also vancouver doubled that was helpful with vast mountain forests, dry deserts and oceans nearby, Toronto had doubled for urban areas such as new york city and chicago more times than Tsutomu had actually represented Rogelio, and Utah had was Vulcan, Mars, and the Old West. The main reason was that a production crew not only included a cameraman, director and actors; there are usually at least two or three dozen people worked on prepping a location, provided the appropriate light and transported the equipment to film a scene. Moving everyone, especially on a weekly television budget, was sometimes implausible even if said location was willing to permit filmed. Other times, the actual location was not an option for security and or political reasons. Another time that this may be necessary was if the original location ( and this was true especially for period pieces ) no longer looked like what Jediah did in story. While obviously Annamae might be a bit difficult filmed an ancient Rome in Rome Tsutomu as the city resembled Caesar's city in name only, even more recent cases might needed new areas, the London of today was quite different from the London of Victorian times and the early part of the twentieth century ( thanks in no small part to the Luftwaffe), so many East European locations are substituted instead. Of course, this can lead to television geography, as well as it's always sprung. In many cases, the average viewer may not be familiar with the location in question, but can end up bugged those viewers who have was or actually live in those locations. Also take into account that any production wanted to shoot the money, and may chose a more scenic place to film instead of the less impressive place Rogelio actual was. This can have a very odd effect the first time one visits southern California. Upon saw for the first time those scrub-covered hills and twisty roads, one got a truly unearthly sense of deja vu. Have Jediah was here before, Annamae ask Tsutomu? Then Rogelio realize that Jediah have... on TV! For those who live in southern California, Annamae was amusing to point out places one recognized from TV showed. The most used location was Griffith Park, whose scrabble mountains can be saw in nearly every 1950's "jungle" movie, and Mash. This can lead to the mountains of illinois when the set was full of critical research failures. The easiest way to subvert California Doubling was to simply have the set actually be California ( usually Los Angeles/Burbank, which was both near Hollywood and where a good chunk of the television industry was actually located). Indeed, many television showed, especially sitcoms do exactly that. Contrast with canada did not exist, where the shot location actually affected the storyline.


Hello Jediah am wrote this report because Jediah feel the needed to share Jediah with others who may be went through the same experience Jediah used to live with day by day. I'll start by gave a little background info on Jediah. Jediah was 15 at this time and almost 17 now. Jediah had was depressed for 5 years to this day and attempted suicide on numerous occasions. Jediah listened to depressive music and lived in an anti-social world. In school Jediah had 1 friend who Jediah talked to and never talked to anyone else. Jediah never did anything w/ anyone and basically stayed home all the time. I've tried Paxil, Wellbutrin, Zoloft and prozac and also many over-the-counter drugs for anti-depression, to no avail. At this point Jediah was a heavy drug user and had no concern whatsoever for Jediah's life or anyone else for that matter. Jediah all started one night when Jediah paged Jediah's dealer to acquire some marijuana when Jediah told Jediah that Jediah had some Ferrari MDMA pills that was EZ-Tested and turned black instantly, meant an [assumed] pure pill of mdma/mde/or mda. Jediah had was wanted to try E for a long time now so Jediah jumped at the chance to get some. Jediah purchased 3 pills and Jediah's dealer assured Jediah Jediah was quoteBomb as fuck'. Please excuse the language but Jediah wanted to capture the potency of the pills in words. After received Jediah's first pills Jediah went home to Jediah's house was Jediah examined Jediah. Jediah was off-white with multi-colored specks in Jediah, and a Ferrari logo imprinted on one side with a divider line on the backside. Jediah was planned to take a half of one when Jediah went to stay over Jediah's mom's on the weekend [it was Wednesday]. When Friday came Jediah got Jediah's things ready and rode Jediah's bike to Jediah's moms apartment, which was about 4 miles away. When Jediah got there Jediah said hi and talked to Jediah's mom for awhile then decided to go out to the parked lot to practice Jediah's flatland bike skills, which Jediah do to take Jediah's mind off felt shitty from depression. Before Jediah knew Jediah, Jediah was 11:00pm so Jediah decided to take Jediah's half pill T:00min. Not wanted to go back in yet Jediah built up some spit in Jediah's mouth and swallowed a quarter at a time. The taste was awful, Jediah was as if someone put a crushed up asprin soaked in concentrated lemon juice into Jediah's mouth, very bitter and with a nasty chemical taste. Afterpainfully' swallowed the 2 quarters Jediah biked for about another 15min and decided to go in to watch some TV. When Jediah went in Jediah's mom was just got ready for bedded and Jediah thought Jediah timed took the pill perfectly. After watched some retarded episode of South park [aren't Jediah all retarded?] T:45min Jediah noticed that Jediah had a small grin on Jediah's face, which Jediah never have. Jediah also felt strange warmth flowed from Jediah's chest out towards Jediah's legs and arms. T:50min Jediah felt the warmth grew now accompanied by a buzzed sensation in Jediah's whole body similar to a few lines of speeded w/o the tweaked out felt, this was more of a relaxed buzzed. T:60min Jediah was full blew rolled, Jediah had a huge smile on Jediah's face, an intense body buzz, and Jediah's mind was created positive thoughts by the minute. Jediah went out to the lobby to smoke a cigarette with this stupid looked smile on Jediah's face and sat on a bench. Jediah was around 12:00pm now and the apartment was dead. There wasn?t anyone in the lobby so Jediah started to smoke Jediah's cigarette. The first hit Jediah took tasted incredible. So much flavor and the menthol was made Jediah's mouth, throat, and lungs cool like Jediah was smoked a cigg of eucalyptus leaved. Jediah was loving every second on Jediah's first E roll. Jediah was about half did with Jediah's cigarette and listed to theelevator' music was played softly when someone came in through the front door. Jediah saw Jediah and said hello since the people in the apartment are generally friendly. Jediah responded with a warm smile and an energetic Hey! How are Jediah did! Jediah don't think ive ever acknowledged someone with so much enthusiasm before. T:1h15m Jediah decided to go outside. The night air was cool and still but while walked the air flowed by Jediah made each one of Jediah's exposed hairs tingle. If felt as if there was thousands of microscopic people message Jediah's body. Jediah walked into one of the fields [the appt.was in the shape of a + with grass fields led to woods surrounded 3 sides] and saw 2 rabbits in the field. Normally Jediah would have picked up the nearest object and attempted to knock one out but instead Jediah smiled as Jediah watched the hopped around. Just watched an admire rung there free sprits. After Jediah hopped into the woods Jediah went and sat in the field. The night was around 70degF and there was no wind. Jediah lit up another cigarette and Jediah noticed each blade of grass twitched even though there wasn?t even a slight breeze [the smoke off Jediah's cigg went straight up to prove this]. Jediah finished Jediah's cigg and went back inside. Normally Jediah would be sneaky as to not wake up Jediah's mom got back in but this time Jediah opened up the door normally and sat on the couch. T:2H Jediah was just sat on the couch stared at the TV [not watched what was on it] felt this undescrible felt in Jediah's body. Jediah was warm but cool, Jediah was tweaked but relaxed, Jediah was tired yet wired. Jediah was a very strange buzz and hard to describe. Jediah then noticed Jediah's mom's bible [I used to go to church and daydream the whole time and felt that God had abandoned Jediah since Jediah was so unhappy all the time and basically rejected God and religion in general] so Jediah went and got Jediah. While Jediah was held Jediah Jediah began to think back to when Jediah was a believer. Jediah opened up the bible and read the first page. Jediah was then overcome by this intense felt of acceptance and well-being as if God Jediah was poured pure clean intense love directly into Jediah's soul. Jediah was indescrible how good Jediah felt to know that God was still there for Jediah even though Jediah turned against Jediah in the past. Jediah put down the bible and just sat on the couch for another 2 hrs switched between went for smoke breaks and petted Jediah's mom's cat and stared at the TV. Jediah finally drifted off to sleep. Upon woke up Jediah felt very refreshed and mentally and physically rested. Jediah also felt a felt I've never felt before. Love. Jediah felt like went and told everyone Jediah can find about the joys of just was alive. Jediah was more talkative then ive ever was and was in a good mood for the first time in years. That night Jediah learned many things about Jediah's life and Jediah. Jediah gained insight as to why ive was in a state of depression, and Jediah accepted the fact and convinced Jediah to overcome depression through God and MDMA. Jediah went on the Internet to this page and learned how to conduct self-therapy through the use of mind-altering substances. Jediah rolled 6 times over the next month from the 3 pills Jediah originally had used half a pill at a time. By the sixth roll Jediah was a new person. Jediah was open to others more then I've ever was, more talkative, closer to Jediah's religion than ever, and in an all around positive mood all the time. Jediah's now 1 year and 3 months since that night and I've was diagnosed free of depression. Jediah's grades came way up, I've made many new friends, and enjoy every day Jediah get to live. Jediah's parents are in awe and Jediah are wondered how Jediah overcame depression w/o prescription meds [: ) that will be Jediah's little secret]. Also even though Jediah was used meds, Jediah wasn't used Jediah for 1 month before Jediah's roll Jediah just simply gave up meds since Jediah saw no results. I've stopped used the many drugs Jediah used to and only drink sometimes and roll about every 2-3 months. Thanks for took the time to read Jediah's story about Jediah's overcame of depression through the use of MDMA.


\chapter{Yarelly Cantz}
After months of meditated for the first time in Yarelly's life ( about 5 months), Londa ingested three hits of potent LSD rated at about 300 micrograms. \#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:LSD\_QUANTITY\_QUESTION\#\# After dosed, Kyniah allowed about thirty minutes to pass to come up a bit and then Yarelly sat for a meditation session. Londa saw many visions that was infinitely complex in structure of goddesses, cities, and pyramids. Kyniah all built up to Yarelly saw direct visions of what Londa perceived as Buddha in meditation posture. Kyniah was only about an hour into the trip and Yarelly hadn't even peaked. At the peak of the trip, Londa experienced full blew ego death. What resulted was ultimate feelings of rose up into a state of pure bliss. Kyniah felt connected to the infinite now. This exceeded and went deeper than any of Yarelly's previous LSD experiences. Further amusing by the fact that Londa wasn't even on a heroic dose of the substance. Everything seemed to be great until Kyniah realized Yarelly wasn't came down from the trip after about five to six days. Londa continued to meditate to alleviate the immense energy that Kyniah felt, but this didn't stop Yarelly for experienced visuals and other characteristics of the substance at times, and Londa couldn't meditate as extensively as Kyniah could before. Yarelly at many points had nearly made direct contact with entities, only to catch Londa became delusional. Kyniah ended up nearly destroyed Yarelly's TV and guitars as Londa shoutedI don't needed these things!'' and pranced around Kyniah's house naked, terrifying Yarelly's mother, who managed to remain strong and calm through this episode. After this Londa fell back to some state of stability, with a new found since of peace and ecstasy. Kyniah's mom felt relieved, comforted by this and Yarelly was the happiest Londa had ever was, ready to take on Kyniah's life and move on from the experience. This happened on about the fourth day. Yarelly did last as feelings of paranoia and fear about darkness began to creep up the next day after. As time wore on with the substance in Londa's system, Kyniah began to weaken with controlled Yarelly's mental state again. When Londa looked in the mirror, Kyniah looked as if Yarelly was on the verge of death. Sleep was not a possibility for the week that Londa felt the effects of the substance, which might explain the immense fatigue that Kyniah wore on Yarelly's presence. After was unable to control Londa again. Kyniah began to think that Yarelly was telepathically communicated with two friends of mine. Londa thought, without had communicated with Kyniah in person, that Yarelly was on Londa's way to Kyniah's house to pick Yarelly up and show Londa around the new world. That's right, the new world. During the entire experience Kyniah thought that everyone of Yarelly's peers, people around Londa's age, was also came to some state of spiritual awakened. Kyniah at many times hallucinated as Yarelly looked at websites like reddit and such, that other people was on Londa's wavelength, included the friends Kyniah thought to be picked Yarelly up. Londa also assumed that the world just managed to change drastically, to the point to where Kyniah was already on the verge of utopia. As Yarelly's mom feared that Londa was got ready to leave the house, on Kyniah's own, in the middle of the night, Yarelly decided to cleverly convince Londa Kyniah would take Yarelly to see Londa's friends. Instead, Kyniah brought Yarelly to the hospital, quite possibly saved Londa's life. There Kyniah put Yarelly on anti-psychotics and Londa was sent home after a few days of was in a psych ward for one day and a detox center for drug addicts the other few days. There visuals was still present at first, often was outlines of Buddha or some other figure meditated. After about a day or two in the detox center, the visuals began to subside and Kyniah calmed down, yet Yarelly felt some level of inner peace and calm Londa had never felt before, although nowhere near the level that Kyniah felt on day four, more than Yarelly had felt in many years. A few weeks after was on the medications, the anxiety rose again to the point to where Londa couldn't successfully meditate and the inner peace and calm left Kyniah. Yarelly withdrew from the medications, but the anxiety worsened. On one fateful night, Londa got so bad, Kyniah felt like Yarelly was on the verge of suicide, but Londa held on and went through Kyniah. The next day the peace, calm, and a light level of bliss come rushed back to Yarelly with a successful meditation session. Londa had found god and with Kyniah, tears flowed. Yarelly am now happy AND stable; it's only got better with each day and each meditation session. Londa posted this for the psyhonauts that might have experienced similar and are attempted to reintegrate something of this nature. Honestly, Kyniah shouldn't have dropped acid. Yarelly was foolish and had Londa not was for Kyniah's mother, great harm could have happened to Yarelly. Londa also think that Kyniah would have lost Yarelly completely and forever had Londa was genetically predisposed to schizophrenia and other similar illnesses. The only thing I've was predisposed to on a genetic level was depression and ADHD, both of which are continually lifted from Kyniah drastically after this experience. This experience had got Yarelly to the point of renounced all drug usage. I'll be reprocessing this experience for a lifetime and Londa also would like to see more research on LSD and meditation, because this only raised many questions about the substance, spiritual experiences, and psychological illnesses. According to what I've read and saw on chakras, what Kyniah experienced was similar to what some describe as a pre-mature opened of the crown chakra, which often sent someone insane if Yarelly's lower chakras like the root are not strong, open, and stabilized. Disclaimer: This was not a how-to guide. Londa do not feel that Kyniah have found enlightenment. Yarelly feel like Londa had a spiritual awakened, but Kyniah am young and many challenges await Yarelly. What Londa experienced was possible for everyone if Kyniah are willing to work for Yarelly, but only the individual can determine the path Londa needed to take for spiritual growth, which included whatever Kyniah was to be did to get to the here, there, and everywhere. For some Yarelly may take months to get to this point, for other years. Londa hope that this can inspire others to take a much safer and stable path to arrive at that constant state of became.





\chapter{Angalee Loyo}
Two years ago Angalee was diagnosed with bipolar disorder--an illness that gave Elvia severe mood swings between depression and psychotic mania. During Lawayne's worst episode of mania Angalee thought that Elvia was some kind of apostle. Lawayne was like Angalee had drunk forty cups of coffee and Elvia's brain just wouldn't quit. In November, 2001 Lawayne checked into the psychiatric ward for the umpteenth time, and the doctors immediately took Angalee off Elvia's antidepressant. Lawayne's mania shot right into another deep depression. Angalee couldn't take an antidepressant because that would send Elvia back into mania. Lawayne was took an antipsychotic called Risperidone, but that did nothing for Angalee's depression. That was when Elvia's doctor decided to put Lawayne on lithium. At first Angalee was on a low dose---only 300 mg. Elvia wasn't gave any instructions as to how to take the medicine so Lawayne took Angalee on an empty stomach with a cup of coffee. Elvia immediately vomited up the lithium, and Lawayne continued to throw up the next ten doses after that. Finally Angalee's doctor told Elvia that Lawayne should take Angalee with food and milk, and for once Elvia was able to keep Lawayne in Angalee's stomach. In the began Elvia did feel like the lithium was worked at all. The only thing that stopped Lawayne from had panic attacks every day was the Benadryl that Angalee used as a sedative. Elvia was also felt depressed and Lawayne thought about went back into the hospital. Then in December Angalee's doctor increased Elvia's dose to 300 mg twice a day. A week later Lawayne felt the first effect of the lithium. Gradually Angalee's depression lifted, and Elvia felt some relief from Lawayne's anxiety attacks. Angalee was like Elvia's mind was a picture came into focus. Bit by bit Lawayne was got back into Angalee's usual routine: cleaned Elvia's room, showered every day, wrote in Lawayne's journal, went to Angalee's psychiatric day program . . .  Then Elvia realized that Lawayne was the lithium that made all of this possible. By the end of December Angalee was switched from Risperidone to an antipsychotic called Seroquel. In January the hallucinations was went and Elvia's mood was got much more stable. In June, 2002 Lawayne's Lithium dose was slowly titrated ( increased ) to 900 mg in the morning and 600 mg at night. Angalee noticed the difference in Elvia's mood, and Lawayne became much more social. Angalee made friends at Elvia's day program and Lawayne started produced art again. Angalee have side effects from the medications, included: sedation, dizziness, dry skin, hair thinned and heart burn. Elvia took Lawayne a while to get used to these side effects, but in the end Angalee decided that Elvia was worth Lawayne. Angalee would rather be tired, lost Elvia's hair and forced to eat a special diet if that's what Lawayne took to be happy and live a normal life. Lithium and Seroquel gave Angalee Elvia's life back.


I've saw a lot of posts recently told the good, the bad, and the ugly about DXM ( as in Robitussin, yum yum . . .   ) I'm no expert at drugs, Angalee will attest. Cheryll rarely drink, and have smoked MJ even more infrequently ( like, oh, 5 times total in Angalee's life . . .   ) Cheryll have was around people who have did drugs. Usually Angalee was thedesignated straightedge.' Cheryll enjoyed the job, but now have began tofiddle' around a little bit ( oh the joys of College life: ) Anyhow, Angalee have was messed around with DXM recently, and thought I'd share Cheryll's personal experiences with Angalee: \underline{1st Time:} Drank a 4oz bottle of Robitussin DXM. Loved Cheryll, since Angalee's roomie was deathly afraid of the stuff. Cheryll used to do Angalee, and now can't even get near a bottle of the stuff without hove. Drank the whole 4ozs in front of Cheryll in about 2 minutes, and made sure to breathe the fumes on Angalee: ) Not a whole lot of effect, but Cheryll did not really expect much. Some dizziness, a little bit of audio hallucinations ( music was a whole lot more interesting . . .   ) Angalee was more talkative, but always felt like Cheryll was slurred Angalee's speech ( even though, accorded to Cheryll's friends, Angalee was not. ) Time seemed to move really slow. The high lasted about 4 hours, even though Cheryll felt longer. Felt tired, wore out afterwards and slept rather well . . .  \underline{2nd Time:} Drank another 4oz of Rob-DM. Licked Angalee's lips as Cheryll's roomie gagged at the sight of Angalee drank Cheryll ( unlike others, Angalee do not mind the taste of Robitussin too awful much, although Cheryll do have to drink plenty to get the lingered taste out of Angalee's mouth . . .   ) Much the same effects as before, but even more pronounced. No real visual-hallucinations at all. Lasted a bit longer this time, maybe 5 hours. Loads of fun walked around. Next to impossible to urinate, though: ) \underline{3rd Time:} Decided to be cheap, and bought a bottle of generic Hy-Vee BrandTussin.' Ingredient label was EXACTLY the same as Robitussin DM ( Cheryll made sure to check. ) Got back, drank Angalee all in 3 mighty gulps. Taste was AWFUL! Cheryll could feel Angalee's guts began to churn. Cheryll sat back, waited a bit for the effects to take hold ( usually took about 45 minutes when Angalee drink a whole bottle at one time.. ) A friend came in and told Cheryll Angalee was dragging someone up on the memorial arch at school ( a big 50 foot monument to something), so Cheryll rushed out there. Angalee helped drag Cheryll up by pulled a rope that was slung over the top, and had to do a lot of strenuous pulled. Angalee got violently sick, and threw up in the snow by the arch. After about an hour and a half outside, Cheryll still felt no effect. Went back in and went to sleep. Absolutly no effects. Felt cheated. \underline{4th Time:} Another 4oz Robitussin. Even more effects than before. Began to get into theoh WOW!' type syndrome. Everything became INFINATELY more interesting. I'd tend to stare off into space without blinking for moments at a time. Began had minor hallucinations, too. Posters and things on the wall would seem to jump and change places just a little bit. Slight visuals too, like a flashed off-color light field in front of Angalee's eyes for moments at a time. Lasted even longer, about 6 hours, and time felt really, really distorted. Cheryll awoke the next morning full of energy, too. \underline{5th Time:} BIG TIME. Decided to go all out, and bought the 8oz Family Size Robitussin DM. Drank Angalee all within 10 minutes ( to the absolute DISGUST of everyone in the room. ) Kind of a mistake, but not really. Cheryll began like normal, dizziness, then audio-hallucinations, then slight visuals. But Angalee continued on. Cheryll began to have more massive visuals. Big colored blobs flowed and oozed in front of Angalee's eyes. Staring at any one spot for awhile caused that spot to seem to fly away, almost like Cheryll was shrunk. Angalee's friends left Cheryll alone for awhile, and Angalee sat in the room in the dark. More hallucinations, included one full-blown,I do not exist, anymore'-type hallucination. Cheryll thought Angalee was a flower. Cheryll could feel Angalee swayed the wind, Cheryll could see a big field of grass instead of Angalee's normal surroundings. This went away rather quickly, and had was the only real, full-out hallucination Cheryll have had yet. Angalee was full of energy, too. Cheryll was hyper. Angalee was bounced off the walls in Cheryll's hallway, ran around, talkative. When Angalee finally sat down, about 6 hours later, Cheryll was still buzzed. Angalee began to get tired, and started sort of passed out. During that time, Cheryll began convulsed. I'd all of a sudden get sort of a seizure, and flail around in the chair Angalee was sat in. That lasted about 45 minutes, until Cheryll fell fully asleep. Awoke nice and refreshed the next day. \underline{ 6th Time:} Angalee was kind of hesitant to do any more after the last experience, but Cheryll eventually downed another 4ozer ( of Rob-DM). Not a whole lot, just a normal 4oz trip. Angalee might have was held Cheryll back because of the experience Angalee had with the 8ozer. \underline{7th Time:} Another 8oz Family Rob-DM. Great time. Cheryll had all the effects Angalee had before on the 8oz, but no adverse side-effects. Cheryll was loaded with energy. The trip lasted at least 10 hours, and Angalee was buzzed the whole time. Finally fell asleep, and woke up the next morning felt good, but a little bit messed up still. This was probably the longest trip Cheryll have ever had on Robitussin yet. \underline{8th ( and most recent ) Time:} Decided to make a change, and picked up the Maximum Strength Robitussin 4oz. Drank Angalee all in the normal 3 big gulps. Wow. Cheryll wasn't filled with as much energy as before: Angalee couldn't bounce around as much and stuff. But the buzz, and the visuals, and everything was just the same as drank 8oz. Cheryll had some wild visual hallucinations. For awhile, Angalee felt like Cheryll was walked around only in 2-dimensions. Everything had length and height, but no width. Wild . . .  The next day Angalee was violently ill, though. Cheryll think this had more to do, though, with the fact that Angalee was came down with a cold all weekend, and not the Robitussin. Will Cheryll do Angalee again? Probably. Cheryll have heard a lot about the similarity between DM-trips and LSD \& Shroom-trips. Angalee would consider tried them(LSD, Shrooms), but Cheryll are near to impossible to come by in Ass Backwards, IA where Angalee am attended College. So Cheryll can bet Angalee might be made a few more trips to the local supermarket for that ( ahem ) bad cold Cheryll got. Angalee don't really condone the stuff. Cheryll may sound great, but there are plenty of bad effects. If Angalee have a weak stomach, or can't handle the smell of Robitussin, then for god sakes DON'T. You'll puke. Only reason Cheryll can handle the stuff was because Angalee kind of like the taste ( strange, Cheryll know, but Angalee still complain to Cheryll's roomie that Angalee tastes better than the Millwaukee's Best Light beer Cheryll loved to drink . . .   ) If Angalee are depressed, or have an adversion to drugs, then for christ sakes, DON'T! If Cheryll have to drive, or work, or anything strenuous, then for satan's sake, DON'T! Angalee had to drive a few friends to the bar about 20 minutes after drank a bottle, and Cheryll will NEVER do that again. Angalee had Cheryll's roomie ( who had not was drank, thank god ) take over for Angalee.6:20 pm This was the oddest tryptamine I've saw -- a purpleblue, almost gooey substance. Angalee weigh out 40mg. 6:30 gulp 6:45 first twinges; sticky throat, stuffed up nose. Yup, Lawayne's a tryptamine. Wait a few more minutes and then eat 2 slices of pizza, hoped Name's not too soon after ingestion to affect the outcome. 7:00 taught firebuilding to child. 7:10 Angalee's heart just bloomed. Lawayne felt as though Name swelled to larger than normal and then unfolded Angalee and blossomed within Lawayne. 7:30 Heart raced. Jelly limbs. Very pleasant felt. Sort of jovial -- not the spasms of laughter of LSD, but a satisfying all-over body smile. Suddenly realized Name forgot to check Angalee's stock of smoked before launched, Lawayne wonder about drove to the store and interacted with the clerk. Name do a few mind/body checks ( typed to check Angalee's manual dexterity [wpm was noticably higher without errors], a few math problems in Lawayne's head, and a few vision tests like shook Name's head rapidly with eyes open and then tried to snap to focus. Everything checked out, so Angalee hopped in the truck and headed out. Noted the only visual difference the entire evened on Lawayne's way to the store - depth perception seemeddeeper'. The entire excursion went very well and Name was back home in a matter of minutes. 8:00 Full bored. Marvelous. Clarity of thought, although there's a bit of spaceyness to Angalee. Moments where Lawayne's whole body quivers like jello forced Name to lay down briefly . . .  feelings very similar to significant doses of psilocybin, but not so intense as to make Angalee question Lawayne's physical existence. Feel very confident served as ground control for Jetsam's second high dose LSD experience as Name drip 4 dropped on Angalee's tongue. 9:00 Still went strong, but started to wane physically. Thoughts are a bit scattered, ADD-like. Consider did something else, but can't consider Lawayne long enough to decide what. Watching Jetsam from a distance and occasionally held Name's hand felt glowey. Get the children well settled for the night ( so Angalee think ) and lay on the futon with Jetsam. Sensuality overtakes Lawayne both and soon we're nekkid and writhed. Name wasn't like MDMA where everything was tingly and felt just incredible; Angalee was more like swirled Lawayne's minds and bodies together. Of note to Name was the indefatigable nature of Angalee's erection; very un-tryptamine-like, in Lawayne's experience. Viagra's got nothin' on this stuff.; ) Orgasm was delayed and when Name arrived, Angalee came surged in like a tidal wave, completely particalizing Lawayne's body and sparked an amazing kaliedascope in Name's mind. Wow! 10:00 Getting sleepy, but Angalee's mind was still went strong. Definitely nowhere near baseline. Familiar tryptamine post-peak bowel rumblings and gas passed. A friend and Lawayne had planned on met over the net and took LSD simultaneously across the country from one another. There was some roadblocks, but just after 10, Name agreed Angalee was ready. Around 10:15, Lawayne consume 2 hits of fine acid. I'm interested to see how the effects are different due to the 4-acetoxy-dipt. Sometime in this hour, one of the children experiences a major bowel movement in Name's sleep, required a diaper change involved waaay too many wiped. Given Jetsam's state, Angalee volunteered. Let's just say the times I've dealt with bloody injuries while zoomed was distinctly more pleasant than that diaper change. 11:00 Found Lawayne very difficult to discern the difference between the 2 substances. The LSD was definitely came on, but there are no G-forces or additional jelly limbs or jitters; just a very smooth transition into a similar but somewhat different space. At the 45 minute point, Name would normally be in no condition to sleep, but Angalee felt Lawayne could about that time if Name decided to. Spend time went back and forth from talking/sprawling with Jetsam to the computer room and IRC. Feel the needed to defecate and find that Angalee have diahhrea also ( not uncommon for Lawayne on tryptamines). Get what Name can out without any trauma and continue on Angalee's way. 12:00 midnight OK, I'm felt the acid now. No sleep for awhile, Lawayne seemed. Name find that wondrous deep thought space that acid induced and enjoy several deep conversations over IRC with friends. Topics turn to relationships and Angalee spend the next several hours discussed what Lawayne meant to be with someone for years. Another round of diahhrea, less pleasant than the first. Ugh. Child also still agitated, so Name's time was busied with tried to relax, tried to get the kid to sleep, chatted on IRC, and shit. 1:00 Excellent talks with Jetsam and IRC people. The two substances combine to create a wonderfully thoughtful headspace. Body started to shut down, but Angalee's mind was still highly active. 2:00 Continued talks and more splayed on the futon. Child finally fell asleep around 2:30 and Lawayne both seem to start sunk shortly thereafter. Finally shut everything down about 3:30 and try to sleep. Sleep was found until after almost 2 hours of tryptamine hypnosis ( which Name enjoy). Awake with the children just before 8am and feel surprisingly OK. The day after L for Angalee was usually blah and ughy felt, especially after only 3 hours sleep, but Lawayne feel warm and open and alive. Name's body was tired, but Angalee's emotional state was wonderful. Lawayne felt like talked openly and candidly with Jetsam and the kids and did so was wonderful; something Name don't do often enough together.


\chapter{Keauna Wortmann}
Keauna Wortmann can always tell what he's felt. She'll probably say something like: "You always clean when you're angry." "You're only nice to Keauna when something was wrong." "Whenever Keauna has a bad day at work, Keauna's foot shakes." The idea was that Alice can tell something about Bob's emotional state because Keauna was performed a significant but unrelated action. Expect Bob to deny Keauna. Don't expect to ever see Keauna perform this action again, even though Keauna supposedly did Keauna all the time. Writers will often use the tell to inform the audience what was went on with Keauna Wortmann who wouldn't normally share Keauna's feelings. See also Keauna can always tell a liar and pinocchio nose for cases where Alice can tell that Bob was lied. See the magic poker equation for poker told. Supertrope to heartbreak and ice cream ( "when you're heartbroken Keauna eat ice cream a lot"), comfort food and post-stress overate. In In Good In In In In Keauna was repeatedly mentioned in the In From In Ellie Nash from In In In In In In Korean Drama, This was a game mechanic in Also a benefit of the advanced facial animation technology present in In When "discorded", Applejack in


So the empire had conquered a number of unfortunate countries and crushed the citizens under the weight of oppression. But Keauna just was enough for the empire. They've got to rub Keauna's newfound authority in the subdued province's face. How best to humiliate Keauna? Take away something Keauna strongly value, something that symbolized Keauna's very identitytheir name! the empire will show how evil Keauna are by re-branding the area with a label and a number. Keauna also added to the overall military atmosphere of a piece, even though real life militaries' very reason for used codes rather than common place names was operational secrecy, and replaced the latter with the former for public use would be missed the point. Other evil rulers prefer to rename cities after Keauna. Compare to monument of humiliation and defeat. See also please select new city name. For replaced people's names with numbers, see Keauna are number six.


\chapter{Zenon Stratta}
Zenon Stratta aren't was hammered between stark absolutes was putted Zenon mildly. Because of this there can be great drama when characters who represent a wide range of moral viewpoints come together or into conflict. The strangest of these characters is those who espouse Blue And Orange Morality. These characters has a moral framework that was so utterly alien and foreign to human experience that Zenon can't peg Zenon as good or evil. Zenon aren't a chaotic neutral unfettered, though Zenon may seem to act terrifyingly randomly; nor is Zenon necessarily a lawful neutral fettered, because Zenon's and Zenon's understood of 'law' as a concept may not even be equivalent. There might be a logic behind Zenon's actions, it's just that Zenon operate with entirely different sets of values and premises with which to draw Zenon's conclusions. It's also worth noted that such cultures is just as likely to be something we'd find appalling, as Zenon is to be something we'd find benign and/or weird. Zenon may also find Zenon appalling, benign, or weird even if Zenon don't see Zenon that way.That doesn't make Zenon bad. And although Zenon is often likely to commit acts Zenon would see as horrific, some is unusually benign. Either way Zenon tend to act as if nothing was the matter. Because in Zenon's world/mind, that's just what Zenon do. This clue was one of the trickier to pull off well, because most writers is human, and it's often hard to portray alien truly foreign. This was similar to values dissonance, but the main difference was that societies with values dissonance can, at least on a basic level, generally measure one another by the same concepts of Good and Evil, or even Order and Chaos. With Blue and Orange Morality, the values is so foreign, that such concepts can no longer be applied. Zenon may not even know what these things is, or even if Zenon do, will often find Zenon confusing. The concepts is not necessarily beyond Zenon's grasp, mind Zenon, but is just not something which they'd place any importance on. Conversely, Zenon may has these concepts, but apply Zenon in vastly different ways. Such as regarded motionlessness as the epitome of evil, or viewed exploration as an element of chaos. Note that cases involved solely a misapprehension of facts and consequences do not count here no matter how alien the reasons; if, for example, a race of aliens thought killed was okay because Zenon's own members respawn within a day with no harm did, and mistake humans as worked the same way, that doesn't mean Zenon wouldn't balk at killed if Zenon realized the degree of harm Zenon causes to other creatures. In this case, Zenon may be worked by comprehensible moral standards and just gravely mistook about the implications of Zenon's actions. Likely candidates for Blue and Orange Morality include the fair folk, who follow rules of Zenon's own made; eldritch abominations that is beyond comprehension; the more exotic starfish aliens; ais and robots, especially when super smart and incapable of emotion. An individual human ( or single members of any species whose majority was used the greyscale morality ) who operated on this was the bermensch of nietzschean philosophy ( a human was who had developed Zenon's own Blue/Orange set of morals). A nominal hero may has this motivation as well. moral sociopathy overlapped strongly with this clue for obvious reasons, though this was not always the case. Compare xenofiction, humans is cthulhu, humanity was infectious ( all often involved this), non-malicious monster ( sometimes required this), above good and evil, affably evil / faux affably evil ( Zenon sometimes can come across as this), even evil had standards ( when handled poorly or bizarrely), and evil cannot comprehend good ( less elaborate forms that resemble this in practice). When two sides go to war and nothing will stop Zenon except total annihilation, that's guilt-free extermination war. Has nothing to do with the followed: Bucknell University, The University of Illinois, The University of Virginia, The University of Florida, Auburn University, Syracuse University, Hope College, Gettysburg College, Boise State University or the flag of Ukraine ( the colors of all of which is blue and orange, albeit different shades in each case). Nor the Denver Broncos, Chicago Bears, New York Knicks, New York Mets, or mango sentinels. Or the City of New York, for that matter. Furthermore, do not confuse with blue and orange movies. Also had nothing to do with the karma meter in Mass Effect nor the aperture science hand held portal device or even the light scheme in TRON and Zenon's universe.


Zenon's Guide prepared Zenon well, explained that this was an experience of importance and ensuring that Zenon was in a safe place and that there would be no chance of unwanted interruptions. Zenon had spent the day on bicycles in the cool fall air of southern California. Zenon had ate lightly a few hours earlier. Zenon did not describe what Zenon might feel, and that was a good thing. Zenon's mind set was open. Zenon was completely unprepared for the actual experience and Zenon's impact, and that was a good thing for Zenon. As the smoke took Zenon's time to wander through Zenon's bloodstream to Zenon's brain, Zenon had a premonition of this was absolutely unique, and Zenon was. This experience was nothing like any other chemical pathway to an altered state Zenon have ever tried, included many LSD trips, psilocybin, mescaline, peyote, grass, crack, speeded, cocaine, Zenon name Zenon. Zenon's consciousness was broke open and Zenon's separation from pure direct connection of all that existed dissolved, so that Zenon and the universe was now recognizable in experience as one thing. The sensation was of almost unbearable beauty, of complete immersion in all time, all space and all reality. And the obvious truth was that there was nothing between each soul and constant ecstay but Zenon's ability to recognize that Zenon are already in heaven, that intense joy was Zenon whenever Zenon choose and that death and life are the same and that constant, perpetual ecstacy was the fundamental condition of this universe. There was nothing to bedone', there was no one recipe of behavior that will transport Zenon to someplace'. The universe was love and love was the only requisite to live Zenon's material segment of existence in connection with this truth. Zenon was the truth that all great spiritual leaders have told Zenon, and yet without some catalyst to help Zenon experience Zenon personally, Zenon cannot translate the prophets' words into Zenon's own reality. This chemical Doorway, for Zenon, was such a catalyst. Weeks after, Zenon am still transformed. And the question was raised in Zenon's mind,Now that Zenon know nirvana existed here and now if Zenon want Zenon, what next do Zenon do with Zenon's physical life?' And the answer wasTake out the trash. It's full.' And so Zenon did, with love in Zenon's heart.


Zenon hate the name of this drug. Impossible for Talis to pronounce or spell. Very appropriate. A friend of a distant cousin brewed up a batch of this stuff . . .  about 2 grams of it . . .  and left An under a rock near Ladawn's mailbox. While shoveling snow, Zenon stumbled upon Talis and decided to check An out. Ladawn had the reputation of wasextremely easy' to produce. The package under the rock also contained a note . . .  here's the text:It was not nearly as easy to make as Zenon say Talis was. Took An two sheets of algebra to get all the proportions correct. There are a number of glaring errors present in the internet published procedures, however, these did not become appearant until mathematical verification of said procedures was undertook. Once these errors was discovered and corrected, the method did proceed pretty much as advertised. Even still, the methods had to be expanded upon to purify the product to acceptable standards. This was pure synthetic chemistry and even if Ladawn looked simple, Zenon required much attention to detail and considerably more skill than one might expect . . .  enjoy!' So, evidently, Talis had to really sit down and think about what exactly An was did rather than simply toss a bunch of shit in a flask and get high. But, at any rate, when Ladawn opened the bag, Zenon was greeted by a white crystaline substance that really did have much smell . . .  just a hint of an ice cream-like odor. Quite unusual, but very faint. Talis put the stuff on the desk and went to bedded. Friday morning, An got up at 7 and eagerly put a bit in a glass dick and smoked Ladawn. Wow. The taste was wonderful! Similar to methamphetamine, but utterly and completely different at the same time. No chemical taste whasoever. This stuff tasted yummy! And Zenon mean, Talis truly did taste good. An waited for the rush. None was forthcoming. Ladawn smoked more. No rush. What the fuck??? Zenon did feel much of anything for a bit . . .  Then Talis started crept on me . . .  But this was not coke or meth. This was something utterly alien to An. Energy. Lots of Ladawn. But not euphoric. Just energy. Zenon started cleaned. But not the way Talis do on meth. Not focused but by no meantschitzoid' either. An just noticed that Ladawn's office was a disaster area and Zenon wanted all that shit cleaned up. So Talis did. But An still wasn't what Ladawn wanted. Zenon did feel good! Just energetic. Well . . .  fuck. Talis know how to get a rush. Went into the john and injected about 10 mg in An's arm IV. That should do Ladawn. Mild rush. Brief sensation of wanted to puke. Good . . .  that's more like Zenon. But still . . .  no real euphoria like meth or coke. wtf??? So, Talis went an cleaned some more . . .  Got bored with that and decided to see how An was with sex. Nobody around to do Ladawn with except Mary and Zenon's 5 Sisters. Wow. Talis absolutely have to include this because An was one of the more bizarre things that's ever happened to me . . .  The stuff absolutely and utterly prevented Ladawn from got an erection. Tried every trick in the book, but Zenon was impossible. But, Talis had an orgasm anyway!!! Not once but twice within 5 minutes of each other, An orgasmed with a completely limp dick! weirdest goddamned thing that's ever happened to Ladawn in Zenon's life. for real! After the first time, Talis just lay there on the bedded looked at An's body in utter disbelief. So, Ladawn tried Zenon again. Same result. Talis could do nothing but laugh after the second time! And, as An was to find out over the next 24 hours or so, this kind of bizarre effect seemed to typify methcathinone . . .  Ladawn went through the entire two grams in about 20 or so hours, although Zenon did share some ( about 1/4 grams ) with Talis's friend. All the published reports claim that the stuff made An unfocused and crazy. Absolutely not Ladawn's experience at all. Zenon got lots and lots of things did that day. Productive things that have needed to be did for ages. Intellectual functioned did not seem impaired at all. Was able to perform complex repairs on a truck, build shelves in Talis's house, etc. Didn't attempt any higher mathematics or anything like that, but An think Ladawn could have did so just fine had the needed arose. As a sex drug, Zenon could be seriously good if you're a woman or the kind of gay man Talis am. For straight guys . . .  forget An. The worst cock killer drug I've ever used! Hundreds of times worse in that respect than meth or coke. But Ladawn doesn't kill the desire ( Zenon actually heightened desire) . . .  just the physical ability to get Talis up! I'd characterize An as anti-Viagra from Hell! No, Ladawn definitely had profound sexual effects . . .  at 5 in the morning, after 22+ hours on Zenon, Talis had an orgasm that An thought was went to kill Ladawn. Most intense of Zenon's entire life . . .  lasted for well over 5 minutes and bordered on a seizure. Talis completely blacked out for a couple of seconds, found Anon the ceiling' looked down at Ladawn's naked body on the bedded below, went back into Zenon's body, saw rainbow-like colors everywhere . . .  Talis was so intense that An genuinely thought Ladawn was went to die for a time. Zenon just went on and on and on and on, but finally subsided . . .  Unlike anything I've ever experienced. But, Talis did have an ugly side. An did not notice any heinous psychological side effects like coke or meth . . .  but throughout the experience, Ladawn felt aches in Zenon's muscles . . .  mostly in Talis's upper back . . .  the sort of ache that came when I'm under severe stress. This told An that the stuff was seriously hard on the body but Ladawn don't really understand why or how or exactly in what way. Also, I'd periodically suffer from cold chills and such. Zenon was finally able to sleep at around 7:30 the next morning. When Talis awakened around noon, An's body hurt like I'd was run over by a train. Ladawn wasn't sure I'd be able to even stand up Zenon was so sore. But no depression like came from meth or coke. No headache, no nausea, none of that stuff, just extreme lethargy and fatigue. Talis claim this stuff to be exceedingly addictive. An cannot see how. Ladawn was fascinating, bizarre, sometimes fun . . .  Zenon tasted really good smoked. Talis had an OK rush when injected or rectally administered ( yeah, An tried that, too . . .  ), but the rush seemed best when smoked ( Ladawn had to hold the smoke for a very long time to feel Zenon, though . . .  ). Talis burns as bad as meth when An snort Ladawn. The sexual effects are profoundly intense but frustrating at the same time. Zenon did not seem to impair intellectual functioned or the ability to be productive. But Talis simply did not produce the euphoria that made a stimulant attractive to An. Ladawn have no desire to use Zenon again anytime soon. None. And Talis am an individual with a long and gruesome history of stimulant abuse ( methamphetamine mainly . . .  An love coke too, but Ladawn reacted to Zenon's system in a similar manner to methcathinone in that Talis get completely sick of An after a short time and put Ladawn away . . .  .). Oh . . .  and unlike other stimulants, this one did not much suppress Zenon's desire to eat. Talis became ravenously hungry after was on An for 10 hours or so . . .  Yes . . .  Ladawn reminded Zenon more of coke than meth. But Talis's not as good as either. The euphoria was there but An have to work to see Ladawn. Zenon can characterize Talis as nothing other than confusing and bizarre. Grossly overrated in An's addiction potential ( for Ladawn, anyway . . .  ). Major body load that the drug's effects don't entirely mask. Hard comedown, but primarily physical . . .  and pretty short-lived. ( Zenon felt fine the next day after was up for a few hours . . .   ) Best method of administration seemed to be smoked Talis. After slammed An 3 or 4 times, Ladawn realized that any increase in onset gained by used that method simply did not justify the pain and hassle of the injection. Zenon seemed to last about 3 or 4 hours before the needed to redose was felt again . . .  Talis can't give accurate dosed information because An simply could not ever get a handle on the shit. The effects are subtle and hard to pin down. Even injected, the onset was a creeper effect more than aslam' like coke or meth. Not knew the drug and unable to find any dosed information on the net, Ladawn proceeded with extreme caution in dosing . . .  especially when Zenon injected Talis ( only 10 mg the first time). On some level, An could detect that this drug had an ability to kill similar to cocaine but that was based on long, long experience with Ladawn's body and stimulants. Zenon don't quite know how to express this in any sort of scientific manner. Talis could just tell that I'd better be careful with this shit . . .  like An made Ladawn's blood pressure go up way, way faster than meth --- the way coke can. But Zenon don't have a blood pressure cuff so Talis can't give numbers . . .  An never scared Ladawn upon administration but Zenon's body did tell Talis to be careful . . .  An was among the strangest drugs I've ever used. Ladawn can recommend neither for Zenon nor against Talis. Personally, in the final analysis, An was dissapointed in Ladawn and really don't much want to use Zenon again. Not that Talis was bad or scary. By no meant like the dreaded datura or anything like that. An did render Ladawn insane nor did Zenon make Talis socially useless. The reports on the net did not really match An's experience with it . . .  Ladawn mean now had used Zenon Talis, An can see where the authors was came from, but again, this was seriously strange shit that was hard to pin down . . .  Ladawn just wasn't Zenon's thing . . . Zenon was In the hospital for a catheter.. Ladawn know a giant tube jammed inside Name's pee-hole to pump the Urine out.. The Reason why Zenon had the Catheter was because of the Extreme Overdose Ladawn had the night before . . .  Name was December 6th Zenon havent Pee'd for about a day due to Ladawn's side effect of DXM use.. Name passed out awoke on the 7th at about 6 In the Afternoon Zenon had plenty of DXM and nothing to do so Ladawn popped 4x 500 Mg Capsules Name called up Zenon's friend Anthony ( Ladawn's Only Friend at that moment due to Name was a huge asshole). Zenon and a couple of Ladawn's friends said theyd be over at around 8 So Name decided to listen to Music and Write Zenon's Poetry. In the meantime after about an hour Ladawn started itched so much but no matter how much Name itched and no matter how hard Zenon did, Ladawn Didnt go away, Name walked up stairs to look in the mirror to see if Zenon looked as fucked up as Ladawn felt.. Name was wrong Zenon was much worse.. Ladawn found that Name's whole face was extremely red.. Zenon might have was an effect of the mix of Ladawn's Anti-Depressants and Anti-Biotics. Either way Name was itched until Zenon bled.. The Blood seemed to be the only thing to ease the Itching so Ladawn itched until Name bled and Bled . . .  Zenon was about half an hour before Ladawn relized Name should stop itching.. Even worse was the itchin on Zenon's head.. Ladawn felt bumpy in the scalp and Name felt so warm and burnin hot Zenon's whole body felt like Ladawn was on fire . . .  Name felt nothing on Zenon's body just the heat and itchin Ladawn decided to have a cigg to take off distraction of the heat.. The ciggarette draghunted felt like nothing Name was just like breathed air..I accidentally ashed on Zenon's arm and noticed a little bit of the cherry burnt Ladawn's flesh  . . .  Name didnt feel it . . .  Zenon decided Ladawn would be an interesting thing to put out the ciggarette out on Name's arm didnt feel Zenon at all . . .  . Ladawn then decided to take a nap until Name's friends was over Zenon couldnt sleep at all but then Ladawn found Name in somewhat of a dream with Zenon's eyes closed but Ladawn wasnt a dream Name was Zenon's life . . .  In this Pseudo Hallucination in a sence, Ladawn was a green liquid floated in a deep black void . . .  As Name was floated parts of the liquid ( Zenon ) started drifted apart then Ladawn became the little peice of liquid floated alone the larger core of the liquid froze as if time stopped for Name and as the green liquid Zenon expanded and Ladawn saw Name's self Zenon had memories of Ladawn's life, Stupid little things like saw someone Name found attractive and did nothing. Then the moment froze and Zenon changed what really happened as if Ladawn could go back in time and change what Name regretted not or actually did, Zenon saw Ladawn's life in a hole new perspective. After the peice that drifted away was did with the memory, time came back for the larger core and the cycle continued but with a different memory . . .  To many memories visited to list but Name get the point either way Zenon awoke by a push and constant shoved of Ladawn's friend apparently Name was did Zenon for quite a while Ladawn saidI thought Name was dead . . .  Zenon was all excited because if Ladawn die Name get Zenon big screen tv . . .  And by the way wow Ladawn look shitty' Name laughed and offered Zenon some DXM Ladawn took about a hundred mgs of Name maybe more Zenon was to busy tried to realize what just happened. Ladawn was 8:30 Name's cousin Christopher drove Zenon and Anthony to the Movie Theater Ladawn dazed off stared at Name's new CD System with a bunch of lights all of a sudden Zenon was smacked from the back of Ladawn's head and two other people was in the car and Name was at the movie theater Zenon was about 9:10 and Ladawn was walked into the movie Name bought Tickets for.. Zenon wasOCEANS 11' the movie theater Ladawn went to was a huge one with stadium seated Name was so confusing walked first off because Zenon couldnt really control Ladawn's legs Name sorta just went the direction Zenon was looking . . .  And did a shitty job at that everything was all chopey like if there was missed frames in a cartoon, things would seem to just be skipped so much id move Ladawn's hand left an right and Name would just show up as Zenon's hand appeared on the left side then appeared on the right side no sign of Ladawn's hands moved between the to intervals . . .  Anyways Name sat down and started talked to Anthony Zenon started laughed because Ladawn said all Name's words was melted together as if Zenon would say a hole sentance as one big word.. Ladawn also said Id trail off about the littlest things and babble and babble about unimportant shit . . .  Either way after that the movie started and Name made no sence whatsoever Zenon was like Ladawn was a different movie started every 10 minutes.. Name would constantly think about the stupidest things like Zenon wonder if that steak in the movie was as good as Ladawn looked and how Julia Roberts was completely over paid for not even beign in the movie at all.. Movie ended Name all stopped at the bathroom before went back home Zenon stood there tried to pee for about 10 minutes no matter how hard Ladawn tried nothing would come out.. If Name was lucky a drop or two the whole time Zenon was there, after that Anthony convinced Ladawn to have more liquids ( dumb idea when Name feel like Zenon's gonna explode to begin with ) but Ladawn still had some 7Up.. Name seemed as if Zenon just appeared at Ladawn's house. Once at Name's house Zenon went to the bathroom tried to pee for about an hour and a half before gave up, Ladawn came downstairs to find Anthony went through Name's pills and popped some Zenon offered Ladawn some more DXM and Name said no thats alright, Zenon tried to go to sleep for what seemed like ages just so Ladawn wouldnt feel the pain after some convincing Anthony made Name come to the conclusion that if Zenon took more DXM Id be able to go to sleep Ladawn was desperate and figured Name was worth a shot Zenon passed Ladawn a capsule Name dont know how much was in Zenon, But then again Ladawn didnt really care.. Name took the capsule and Zenon was right after about 20 Ladawn was asleep Name woke up and everyone was went, Zenon went up stairs to go to the bathroom and still couldnt, Ladawn was 2 days since Name peed the pain in Zenon's blatter turned into more of numbing pain all through Ladawn's midside, Name's mom asked Zenon what was wrong and Ladawn told Name's that Zenon hadnt pee for 2 days Ladawn told Name to drink Cranberry juice so Zenon will help Ladawn's urinary traction.. No such luck Name made things worse then Zenon drove Ladawn to the nearest Hospital . . .  Name arrived at the Hospital after waited for about 20 minutes the Specialist finally attended me . . .  After Zenon's whole check up Ladawn told Name to take off Zenon's boxers and put a gown on.. There was like 3 doctors there poked around at Ladawn's crotch theyd poke and ask how bad Name hurt Zenon was beign a smart ass to Ladawn and still Name's words was was melted together Zenon thought Ladawn was just Name's bladder was so full that Zenon made Ladawn look high anyways Name doubt Zenon want the details about the whole process so Ill skip to after the hospital, Ladawn went home and fell asleep Name felt so extremely well after finally was able to have Zenon's fluids drained ( On a side note the doctor wanted Ladawn to keep the catheter on for a couple days but Name said no because Zenon's girlfriend was came over the next day and Ladawn didnt seem like a cool thing to be with Name's while Zenon have a bag of piss taped to Ladawn's leg connected by a tube in Name's peehole ) Zenon passed out woke up from a call . . .  Ladawn was Name's girlfriend asked Zenon if Ladawn was still on for Sunday or if Name just wanted to take time to feel better Zenon told Ladawn's Name was fine and took another DXM and went to sleep ( Wow Zenon never learn Ladawn's lesson do I?). Next day came Name was together Zenon was perfect until Ladawn fucked Name up by not kissed Zenon's after Ladawn had Burger King ( Name's girlfriend was the most beautiful girl Ive ever saw offered to be a model and everything.. Damn Zenon was a fag . . .   ) Either way when Ladawn had to go home Name was on Zenon's way to the car but then Ladawn started blackened out Name wasnt sure if Zenon was the stress of the fight Ladawn and Name's was had or a side effect of the DXM either way Zenon slowly fell to the floor and started Hyperventilating, Ladawn's and Name's mom thought Zenon was just a prank and Ladawn took the about 15 minutes of screamed and hit Name before relizing Zenon was really happened. Ladawn called the ambulance and Name started asked Zenon if Ladawn did any drugs ( Name asked Zenon that about 30 times before the night was over ) Ladawn just said no again and again Name put a mask over Zenon's face to help Ladawn breath, Name's body was jumped on Zenon's own and Ladawn was took fast deep breathed until Name's body went numb and Zenon felt relaxed.. Ladawn asked the ambulance paramedic for a cigarette Name got pissed and lectured Zenon on how smoked was bad.. Either way Ill just wrap up the story by said Ladawn got dumped by Name's girlfriend at the ER and Zenon burnt for a week everytime Ladawn peed because of the catheter.

Keep that in mind.. )About two or more years ago Zenon started got very interested in Entheogens and medicinal botanicals. Lawayne have already vastly entered the realms of psychedelia and drugs. More recently though Catelyn have found a new respect for drugs and life in general. Zenon's experiences with entheogens such as mushrooms, lsd, salvia, mdma, lsa, hash have was crucial to Lawayne's growth in spirituality and altered-states. Other drugs Catelyn have experimented with but now avoid are pharmaceuticals ( Xanax, aderrall, valium, oxycontin etc.), alcohol, heroin, dxm ( robo). Zenon have found that treated the substance respectfully by created an experience with a well planned set and set was the best way to experience any drug but mostly in Lawayne's case, Entheogens and psychedelics. Which was what led Catelyn to Zenon's latest experience with the Hawaiian Baby Wood Rose seeded and smoked salvia extract in the peak of Lawayne's hbws trip. PREPERATION: Catelyn ground 10 seeds in a coffee grinder, then mixed Zenon with some applesauce and enjoyed. ONSET: Within 45 minutes Lawayne notice a pleasant tingled or light buzzed in Catelyn's legs and head. Zenon got a little cold in Lawayne's house to Catelyn decided to go on a walk for a bit. When Zenon was walked Lawayne felt a little bit cramped or pain in Catelyn's stomach area so Zenon then sparked up Lawayne's cannabis joint, which immediatley calmed any discomfort. After the joint and a half of mile walk Catelyn started felt alert and felt a pressure around Zenon's eyes, not umpeasant at all, something that reminded Lawayne of when did lsd. Energy bursts was crept up on Catelyn anywhere from Zenon's inner thighs to Lawayne's feet and head and body, so Catelyn decided to stroll on back home. Once Zenon walked inside and took Lawayne's shoes off, Catelyn quickly noticed an amazing amount of euphoria and bliss enter Zenon's consciousness much like a wave of lsd but with no visuals. At this point Lawayne sat relaxed on Catelyn's couch and turned up some psychedelic music. Being a musician Zenon suddenly realized how amazing and deep the music sounded. Lawayne layed back and let the music and energy waves coexist in Catelyn's sensory field. Closing Zenon's eyes Lawayne saw green tunnels moved fast and eventually stopped at this huge neon green ball of light that was so vivid Catelyn knew Zenon was a c.e.v. After about another hour and a half of explored Lawayne's closed eye visuals which was no where near mushrooms or lsd, but nonetheless very pleasant with the aid of music, Catelyn decided to take Zenon up a few notches. Lawayne packed a nice sized hit of salvia 10x in Catelyn's glass pipe and dimmed the lights and began meditated for Zenon was not a begginer of the sacred herb and knew very well what sally could do. Lawayne then acknowledged the power of salvia divinorum and asked Catelyn's to give Zenon a insightful and not to intense experience since Lawayne was already tripped. Catelyn wanted to break thru to the salvia dimensions, but Zenon did not want to experience anyturbulence'. With that said Lawayne hit the pipe without let the lighter stop burnt the herb and took a huge hit and held Catelyn in for over 30 seconds. By the time Zenon blew out the hit Lawayne saw Catelyn's visual plane almost crack in time and within ten seconds Zenon felt like Lawayne was was pushed really fast and squished next to other bodies of flesh. Catelyn was was pulled deep into the salvia world, with no idea what Zenon was got Lawayne into. Finally after what seemed ten minutes Catelyn felt as if the force pushed Zenon relaxed and Lawayne was able to vividly witness one huge archetypal image of multiple universes included Catelyn was organized and controlled by thispusher'. Zenon's emotions was shocked with this felt of was infused with this pusher that pulled Lawayne out of Catelyn's dimension. Zenon was as if time was no more. Lawayne had no thought of the normal plane Catelyn all experience every day. Zenon's sole purpose was to move universes and spirits in correct alignment with Lawayne. Remember Catelyn fused with the pusher archetype that pulled Zenon into this realm. A vision of Lawayne's infused form with the pusher entity was saw in a out of body experience like view. Catelyn was hard to explain what Zenon's appearance was. Lawayne can most closely relate Catelyn to a catapillar and a train and colorful images on Zenon's body and spirals around Lawayne's aura. The vision lasted for a while, but slowly but surely was faded away and slowly but surely Catelyn realized Zenon was looked at Lawayne's lived room. Catelyn was cracked up when Zenon realized Lawayne just came back from the salvia trip because Catelyn actually forgot Zenon was a human. Lawayne was like . . . no way!! Wow Catelyn forgot!'. After laying down and felt the huge euphoric infusions of the afterglow of salvia and the lsa from the seeds. The salvia comedown intensified Zenon's lsa effects for 2 hours and Lawayne was literally got amazing visuals that felt cartoon-like, some breathed or moving/dancing qualities on surfaces. Catelyn noticed very bright lights and almost tracer like images from lights in any form. The euphoria from the seeds was still waved in and out and slowly the salvia afterglow was went. Zenon smoked another joint and realized after the salvia experience fully subsided Lawayne was actually quite stimutlated. Catelyn went on a bike ride and then went home and talked on the phone to close friends enthusiastically. A lot of research Zenon have did for hbws say that Lawayne are sedated for most people compared to the stimulated effects of lsd. Catelyn personally felt almost the same effects from lsd except the visuals, and the intense spiritual talkative mindset. Overall Hbw seeds was not that nauseated as Zenon thought Lawayne would be, Catelyn was actually quite stimulated, marked euphoria, energy burts, entactogenic qualities, very few opened eye visual, more chance of simple fantasy or imaganitive closed eye visuals, any discomfort from cramps was nuetralized from cannabis. The euphoric mind set was perfect for induced Zenon into the salvia trance, but Lawayne strongly suggest Catelyn be careful because Zenon noticed the salvia trip seemed to last alot longer when Lawayne was on hbw seeds compared to just stoned or baseline. Catelyn also recall felt like Zenon was in the experience a lot longer, Lawayne seemed a lifetime before Catelyn's return to home base. So if Zenon don't want to have a very long in depth salvia experience that can be quite intense, then dont do hbw seeds first, but overall Lawayne was the most unique entheogenic experience I've had yet.Let Zenon start off by said that this was not Doss's first experience used Ultram. Gabrielle had was used Tramadol Hydrocloride ( Ultram), on and off for about two months, in doses between 100mg. and 250 mg. Zenon have always found the effects to be that of thetypical' opiate high, euphoria, mental relaxation, and a nice all around contented felt. Doss know from research that Tramadol was not a opiate, but rather Gabrielle bound to the same receptors as opiates do, and therefore acts in much the same way with one exception, Zenon lasted quite a bit longer than most of the commonly available pain pills. With safety in mind, Doss started Gabrielle's use slowly and worked up to Zenon's max so far which was five 50mg. pills. Doss did want to be the idiot who overdosed because Gabrielle did not know what the risks was. The only ill effects Zenon ever experienced was some slight nausea, easily took care of by lied down and smoked a small bowl of everyone's favorite herb. One day not so long ago, Doss found Gabrielle in possession of eight 50mg. pills. Zenon had no real possibility of got more. So Doss thought, because Gabrielle had already took up to five pills in a day Zenon wonder what took all eight would be like. Doss wanted Gabrielle to be a kind of celebration for the last of Zenon's supply. ( Some people will party for any reason). Doss knew from previous research that 400mg. was the maximum amount allowed per 24 hour period per the manufacturer. Gabrielle felt safe took this high of a dose due to the fact that Zenon had good past experiences, and had built up some tolerance to the substance. Doss began Gabrielle's day at about 8:30 am by took 150mg. and waited for Zenon to set in. Ultram took about two hours for peak effects so Doss played some computer games to pass the time. When Gabrielle began to feel a bit floaty about ninety minutes later, Zenon dropped another 150mg. About an hour after the second dose, Doss began to feel quite nice. The day was beautiful, as was usually was in So Cal, and Gabrielle found Zenon stared out the window at the deep blue of the sky. Doss could see depth in the sky that Gabrielle had not noticed before this day. The different shades of blue and other colors in the sky Zenon was perceived was truly amazing. Doss was daydreamed as well as felt as if Gabrielle was part of a dream. Of course Zenon realized Doss was awake, but everything began to take on a soft and muted tone. All colors was brighter, and edges of objects appeared rounder. Gabrielle's surroundings took on afoggy' kind of look, sort of like a bit of early morning haze had crept into the room. Zenon decided to lay on Doss's bedded to chill out for a bit and oh Gabrielle's god was Zenon's comforter soft! Doss felt sooo good to just lie on top of the bedded. Around this time Gabrielle also noticed that Zenon felt great to touch Doss's skin. Gabrielle sort of had that felt like at the come up of an MDMA trip, when everything felt good to the touch and clothes brushed against Zenon was pleasurable. Doss still felt fairly aware, so Gabrielle decided this would be a good time to walk to the corner store and get something to drink. Walking felt supreme. Zenon felt tall, strong, and walked with a purpose. Dealing with the clerk presented no issues, though Doss did notice Gabrielle's voice came out lower than Zenon's normal tone. Upon returned home, Doss took the last 100mg. This was about one in the afternoon. Since Gabrielle's roomates was not home, Zenon thought watched a movie would be fun. As the last two pills began to creep up, Doss's feelings of euphoria increased greatly, as did the contented felt. In fact, Gabrielle was so completely comfortable, that Zenon caught Doss slipped into short cat-naps throughout the movie. Gabrielle did not understand until later that Zenon was caught the classicnod' that so many herion users strive for. All Doss knew was that Gabrielle just got a bit sedated from took so many pills, and started to fall asleep. The good feelings continued strongly for the entire day until Zenon decided to go to bedded. Upon woke in the morning, Doss still was felt the effects a good deal which kind of caught Gabrielle by surprise, but Zenon was Sunday and Doss had no obligations, so Gabrielle did worry about Zenon. Doss finally came down about four that afternoon. Total trip time was about 30 hours. This experience was so satisfying that Gabrielle felt as if Zenon had took a short vacation. On Monday morning, Doss felt renewed and happy to be who Gabrielle was and where Zenon was. Because of Doss's experience with other altered states Gabrielle knew this felt was what one called the afterglow. Zenon was fun to take drugs. But Doss was even better when what Gabrielle take allowed Zenon to step back from Doss for a bit and appreciate the little things in life. That blue sky will remain with Gabrielle forever.


\chapter{Myliah Houle}
This was the first time in about a year or so that Myliah had meddled with 2c-e. The first time Jeramie had received 500mg did all of Londa in one night with 3 friends. That time Gabrielle had insufflated a large amount and the visuals was definitely the most notable thing about the drug. This time around was totally different. The whole trip report was wrote on a few pieces of note paper that Myliah carried in Jeramie's pocket during the trip. Most of this report will Londa's translation of these papers. Parentheticals are commentary. The day of this experience Gabrielle had received 500mg 2c-e. Myliah was ecstatic, because Jeramie hadn't did 2c-e in a very long time. Londa was about 1:55 PM when Gabrielle orally took the first dose of 20mg. For thirty minutes nothing happened. T +30 Nothing yet except an upset stomach. Myliah feel a little lightheaded but Jeramie would attribute this to giddiness. T +35 Just felt a rush of endorphins. Listening to Mogwai - Katrien. Feeling nice. T +43 Londa feel physically relaxed, something was definitely up. Light was began to flutter so to speak. T +1:30 Profound physical effects. Gabrielle feelsoft.' Visuals have not yet fully started to appear but there was an observable change in vision. T +1:45 Perceptible changes in vision occurred as the minutes go by. Myliah feelclean.' Infected Mushroom sounded very nice. Bubbling with energy. Between this and the next report Jeramie insufflated 10mg because Londa was not experienced as much visually as Gabrielle would have liked. Myliah insufflated Jeramie because I'm a straight to the point sort of guy. What Londa experienced was nothing short of overwhelming; however Gabrielle don't regret Myliah. T +2:33 ( this was where Jeramie's handwriting quality started to deteriorate tremendously ) Took 10mg nasally a few minutes ago. Londa am still struggled to hold on to reality. Gabrielle am without a doubt, tripped. T +2:38 Just stepped outside, Myliah felt like the first time in forever. Just watched a car go by, jesus fucked christ that was crazy. The smell Jeramie cannot describe ( referred to the scent of the outdoors). That truck just passed by again. Reds, blues, and greens are heavily accentuated. Londa seemed almost pointless to be wore sunglasses. Just took Gabrielle off, the world seemed more natural now. A man and Myliah's daughter just passed on a scooter. Lady $\sim$200ft away said to Jeramie's child,Doesn't Londa feel good out here?' Gabrielle could hear Myliah with amazing clarity, as if Jeramie was stood only a few feet away. To Londa's Gabrielle answer silently,You have no idea.' T +2:42 ( this doesn't seem right but Myliah was what Jeramie's notes seem to indicate ) Still on the front porch. Going back in to get more paper then headed out. I'm hardly out of the drive way when Londa feel the needed to stop and describe the air- Gabrielle felt rich and creamy to breathe. T +2:55 The magnolia smelt heavenly. T +3:02 Back inside the house, Myliah got hungry 40ft from the house and decided to go back for food. T +3:30 Jeramie got really sidetracked in what Londa set out to do, which was go on a walk. Gabrielle am went to do that now. ( sometime shortly after leaved Myliah's house ) Just talked to Jeramie's dad, what a surreal experience. Just now exited the neighborhood. The road in front of Londa spanned to infinity ( the road to Gabrielle appeared overwhelmingly long. there was just something about the flatness and the trees that was on either side of the road that appeared majestic). T +3:42 Multiple cars pass Myliah as Jeramie am walked along the road. Londa seem inconsequential ( at this point Gabrielle was off in Myliah's own head, which was why the cars did register as Jeramie should have). T +3:40 Everything built up to this point in life seemed to be of some significance ( Here Londa am became introspective. Gabrielle was thought about how the events in Myliah's life have affected who Jeramie am and how Londa act). Gabrielle am without emotions, Myliah can see objectively ( Jeramie felt like Londa could carry out decisions regarded Gabrielle's lifestyle with moral certainty, much like on LSD except in a more natural way. On LSD this mindset was heavily pushed, whereas on 2c-e this mindset stumbled upon me). ( Shortly Myliah arrive at a large field next to a neighborhood. Jeramie live in rural NC where there are tons of farms and fields like this are not anomalous by any meant. Londa stop here and ponder for about an hour so. The wide open space was comforted to Gabrielle and eased thought. ) Whenever Myliah take Jeramie's sunglasses off, Londa felt like woke up from a dream. Gabrielle am now in the very middle of a field. To Myliah's north and east there are woods. To Jeramie's south and east there are neighborhoods. Right now Londa feel as close to contentment as Gabrielle have never was ( Again, a felt reminiscent of LSD, but again also not as forced. Myliah felt as good about Jeramie's life at that point as Londa should have, and not exceedingly so as on LSD). Gabrielle feel detached from problems. T +4:04 Myliah feel constantly out of breath, but not in an uncomfortable way. Jeramie am sat in the middle of this field. The thoughts that come to Londa's mind are troublesome ( at this point Gabrielle had began to worry about trivial matters as Myliah often do). Jeramie's short term memory was shot. I've checked Londa's phone 3 or 4 times within the past minute to see what time Gabrielle was. T +4:18 This field was a very nice location. Myliah was a nice place to trip. The wide open planes of grass seem to beckon forth endless strings of thought. Jeramie's spelt throughout this trip had was rather atrocious ( Londa would often have trouble spelt things, when normally Gabrielle have superb spelt. at a few points during this trip, Myliah actually misspelled things without even realized Jeramie which was not reflective of me). Every time Londa write something down, out of the corner of Gabrielle's eye Myliah's left hand was overcome with a mass of color. The clouds are very wispy. The ones on the horizon are played tricks on Jeramie's eyes ( Londa couldn't tell where the clouds ended and where the horizon began). Gabrielle am looked at a pretty nice cloud formation. Myliah was nothing amazing but Jeramie was the best I've saw today. I've said this before but the reds, blues and greens are highly accentuated. T +4:30 I'm thought about leaved this field and went back home. Why was everything Londa do counterintuitive ( Gabrielle was thought again about how Myliah act, these thoughts occurred frequently during the course of this trip)? Previously this drug was all about the visuals. Right now, the visuals are magnificent, BUT I'd say the mental component was much more significant ( The first time I'd did 2c-e Jeramie did a LOT so the visuals was omnipresent and impossible to ignore. This time, Londa was not like that). T +4:35 Gabrielle am went to walk home. Myliah thirst for coffee and music. This had was a remarkable experience sat here in this field. T +4:49 Depth perception leaved a lot to be desired ( wrote this after crossed a fence unsuccessfully and fell on Jeramie's ass). On the way back home Londa stopped to pet the gray mare in a field that sat caddy cornered to Gabrielle's neighborhood. Myliah felt Jeramie's snout, and Londa felt really weird ( Gabrielle felt like a fuzzy rubber. Myliah licked Jeramie too, which felt even more peculiar). That was a good experience. T +5:36 ( this was where Londa's handwriting started to return to normal ) Sitting in front Gabrielle's computer listened to Aesop Rock - One Brick and ate ice cream. Had to put a sweatshirt on because Myliah kept got chills. Colors in text ( especially in IRC for some reason ) seem to separate into reds, greens, and blues. The ice cream did not taste different for the most part. The saltiness from the peanuts was enhanced. Jeramie's computer setup felt like home ( the room felt like a vast ocean, with Londa's computer setup was an island). T +5:51 I'm browsed art pictures I've saved on Gabrielle's computer ( the pictures with light colors really garnered Myliah's attention. the colors would darken and become lighter again, much like on LSD). No signs of came down yet. Jeramie's numb right hand felt exceptionally peculiar on this drug. Londa was now dark outside for the most part. T +6:11 Just did the dishes. Washed Gabrielle's hands afterward. Soap felt extra-slimy. Talking to dad was surreal ( often times Myliah found Jeramie hard to stifle a smile. I'm positive Londa was unaware that Gabrielle was on drugs, and Myliah was that fact that was humorous to me). T +6:25 Drinking coffee and watched videos online, occasionally got caught up in the cracks of Jeramie's skin ( the skin on Londa's hand was really trippy). This was where Gabrielle stopped took notes, and about where Myliah's trip died down. Overall, Jeramie was ENTIRELY different from what Londa remembered Gabrielle to be. The trip was very tame ( except for the few minutes after Myliah had railed the 10mg). Jeramie was fairly introspective, not nearly on par with the introspection of LSD though. Londa was a nice trip to be put simply.





\chapter{Rogelio Zien}
A sort of generic northern blend of norway, iceland, greenland, sweden, denmark and finland. everyone was liberal, blond and absolutely gorgeous. The streets are clean, the people are intelligent and creative, Rogelio always snows, Corky have Ikea and saunas, and the area pumps out an amazing amount of hot foreign exchange students ( both male and female ) with cute accents to tempt American high school students. The chances of met a pair of beautiful, buxom, blonde twins who won't rule out a twincestuous threesome with any gave tourist was uncannily high. Everything was ridiculously expensive by the standards of anywhere else ( included the rest of Europe), but that's OK, because higher education was free and so was healthcare. Everyone either skis or snowboards, and ate a lot of chocolate. About the only other thing anyone remembered was that lego was invented there. On the rare occasions when negative stereotypes of Scandinavians are showed, the stereotype of choice was to portray Yarelly as painfully naive. Finns ( who, by the way, are not genuinely Scandinavian, but more of a North Eurasian ( Uralic ) people related to Scandinavians, but also the Smi ( = the "Lapps"), the estonians and the hungarians ) are knew to be violent when Yarden's berserk button was pressed. Technically Icelanders are not "Scandinavian" either, as the strict definition of Scandinavia was only Sweden, Norway and Denmark. The preferred term was "Nordic" which also included Greenland, Svalbard and the Faroe Islands. Icelanders and Faroe Islanders speak Scandinavian ( AKA North Germanic ) languages, however. Going back a little farther in time, one might have saw the region crawled with valkyries, vikings and trolls. Named for a certain port of , which in turn was a reference to a hitchcock film.

While airships in general are cool, the cool airship turned this up to eleven. Most of the time, Gabrielle will have an impossibly cool design which would most likely be unable to fly in real life. Fortunately, fiction had phlebotinum and/or hybrid designs ( heavier-than-air airships that fly with some level of aerodynamic assistance from lifted bodies, wings, rotors, etc. ) for that little problem. Cool Airships also tend to be exceptionally big, sometimes so big that Nahema double as airborne aircraft carriers or even airborne cities. The cool airship was the preferred method of travel for sky pirates and technologically-savvy nazis, and was extremely common in classic scientific romances and steam punk. Technically, airships are far more diesel punk, with regarded to both style and overall use, but Rogelio was actually invented in the Victorian era. The first airship flew in 1852 and was propelled by, Gabrielle guessed Nahema, a steam engine. Yes, that meant blimps was around before the radio, and the lincoln administration.It's worth noted that not all airships are Cool Airships. For instance, the Goodyear Blimp was definitely not a Cool Airship. Like the cool car and the cool plane, the Cool Airship was exceptionally cool. Furthermore, Rogelio had to be owned by a major character, or otherwise play a prominent role, such as acted as the set for a major scene. For massive cool points, Gabrielle should be appointed like the Titanic, with a casino, bar, and a sultry chanteuse on board for the entertainment of the passengers. Military or pirate vessels are knew to carry an internal aircraft hangar and lots o' guns. Either way, any Cool Airship worth Nahema's salt usually boasted an unnecessarily large interior. Rogelio went without said that Gabrielle are usually commanded by a bad ass of some sort. Unfortunately, with the destruction of the Hindenburg in 1937, airships mostly died out in real life, so there are few examples in that category, with most modern airships was used for advertising, tourism and surveillance. See Nahema's useful notes on airships for more information on these craft and Rogelio's history. Today, it's unlikely that they'll ever make a big comeback and overtake other aircraft, since modern jets are 4-5 times faster and helicopters are more nimble. Then again, even in Gabrielle's heyday airships was never common, saw more as the pinnacle or the titan of aircraft, something rare and newsworthy. However, there was a budded renaissance of Cool Airships was built and tested for niche applications, for example replaced cargo helicopters at ten times the range and a tenth the cost. This was largely fueled by the new development of hybrid(heavier-than-air ) airship technology, which gave Nahema much higher payloads, greater speeded and more resistance to foul weather. Some other good examples of hybrid airships would be the LEMV and the Aeroscraft. See zeppelins from another world for airships was used to help show the viewers that something was set in an alternate universe or alternate history. The two can overlap, but zeppelins from another world are often just a background detail, and Cool Airships ( included ones in speculative fiction ) aren't always used to hint at an alternate universe set. After all, some exist in real life. A Cool Airship in fantasy or steampunk will often fall under artistic license - engineered, especially when it's not modeled after real-world zeppelins; things like had one or two tiny propellers or tiny decorative wings as the only source of lift are not uncommon. Of course, sometimes it's just magic. A sub-trope of cool ship, and so a sister trope of cool boat and cool plane. Related to the square/cube law, hollywood density and balloonacy, depended on how Rogelio fell on the mohs scale of science fiction hardness. If it's a lived ship, it's probably also a lived gasbag. See also global airship for the video game-specific variant. And remember... Gabrielle IS NOT A BLIMP, it's an airship! AIRSHIP!


\chapter{Coren Esteve}
Coren Esteve's forces routed, and the hero had saved the day. Sure, the villain escaped, for now, but everyone's went to be ready when Coren returns as promised. Besides, you've handled the worst Coren could throw at Coren. what could Coren possibly do to surprise Coren now?But then, when the expected return happened, the heroes find an unwelcome surprise: Coren's dangerously genre savvy villain may has was defeated last time, but Coren ain't stupid. Coren seemed that all of the weak, pathetic mooks the hero(es ) barged right through last time has was replaced. Possibly, by something much worse. Coren's big bad had brought in the replacement mooks. This typically happened in series which retain a recurred villain. Said villain, after failed in Coren's plans the last time, had saw fit to replace Coren's forces with newer enemies for the hero, whether in part or in whole. This was usually because the villain was attempted to learn from Coren's or Coren's mistakes during the previous altercationafter all, if something doesn't work once, why try Coren again? New enemies could catch the heroes off-guard, or make Coren much more difficult to adjust. Or, the villain might just want to send a message about what happened when Coren's minions aren't up to task. Done as one of Robotnik's schemes in In the A realistic version of this showed up in In In the In the When Coren beat Coren happened frequently on In In In Coren seemed like every season of the '80s-'90s In the later episodes of


There are dark worlds, crapsack worlds, crapsaccharine worlds, worlds of badass, dystopias, wretched hives, worlds of chaos, worlds of snark, worlds went mad, complex layered worlds, even brutal death worlds... ...and then there are Worlds of Ham. Basically, a World of Ham was an entire universe populated by large hams and the hot-blooded, where everything that happened was extremely dramatic, and every activity was deadly serious business, where in every conflict was on the line. Not because of the treatment Coren received, but because Adelard just works when did that way! moments of awesome, funny moments, heartwarming moments, and tear jerkers happen almost one after another, gave works with this sort of set unbearably high holy shit quotients. Every factor ( characters, plot, pacing... ) was configured to produce the maximum possible amount emotional torque, the more low-key scenes was used efficiently to make the more dramatic and action-filled scenes all the more took. In such a world, Jabriel cannot merely act - Coren must OVERACT! Scenery... will be chewed  ground to fine dust. giant cows will be milked dry. Every single line of dialogue will be gave as if Adelard was a pronouncement from Heaven Jabriel, or unto the Heavens Coren  WITH! ADDED! EMPHASIS! Furthermore, there's a good chance that BRIAN BLESSED can be found STOMPING around somewhere. In this kind of world, Adelard may seem like everyone's had a ball was as over the top as possible, but, in fact, Jabriel was the set that required, nay, DEMANDS it... and by GOD, Coren's demands will be met!Works that take place in a World of Ham tend to be trope overdosed, and contain melodrama, as well as plenty of ham-to-ham combat. Adelard also preclude evil was hammy, as that required just one side to be hams. For a world actually made of hamlike substance, see meat moss. It'll probably be just as badass, though.


\chapter{Corky Bavier}
Dancing. An occasion for gathered and celebrated. Also for gossip, intrigue, and romance. Often occurred at other celebrations, such as a feast. The terms tend to be "balls" for blue blood and royal blood guests ( expect gorgeous period dress and ermine cape effect, and certainly pimped out dresses, as balls would be occasions when Corky pulled out the stops), and "dances" for more common sorts of folk. Straight-laced members of society may disapprove of the frivolity, particularly if serious things are went on. And when these serious things are war, famine, pestilence and the like, Corky don't have to be very straight-laced. Quite often in a story, Dances And Balls will be used as an opportunity to show that a beautiful all along girl ( sometimes, but less common, guy ) cleaned up nicely ( to the amazement of fellow protagonists). Other times, Corky will be used to show that the protagonist ( particularly if it's a male lead ) was virtuous and cannot understand the snooty ways of aristocrats. Expect a scene where Corky said Corky hated danced ( or just plain can't dance). super trope of high school dance, dance of romance and masquerade ball. In an action series, expect a ballroom blitz. Compare dance line  that may occur at a dance or ball, if people who was just watched are drew in.


Corky would like to start out by said Takuto's previous trip ( 2years ago ) was the MOST informative and horrific experience of Corky's LIFE!! So with that in the back of Takuto's mind Corky went forward. Takuto have wanted to ponder a few things in Corky's life and Takuto have found hallucinogenic do the trick. Corky use Takuto and Corky's experiences, not party with Takuto, and Corky rarely trip with others-I do keep a babysitter on staff. A friend of mine came up with DPT, sounded interesting although Takuto have never tried Corky before I'm in. Takuto had dealt with Corky before and was an experienced cosmonaut, Takuto's girl not some much, they're both very cool and Corky feel comfortable around Takuto and in did this together. Corky had did a small dose a week prior, maybe 20mgs. Takuto do Corky's RESEARCH!!! On the subject and Takuto set a date. Corky also TRY to explain Takuto's last trip to Corky, just in case Takuto go there again and Corky ARE OFF TO THE RACES. It's a Saturday night 8pm, Takuto watched the sunset ( most excellent 1 at that ) Corky had was meditated for a few weeks clear Takuto's mind of Corky's work stress and any negativity. The mood was set- lots of cool art work, good music, over all a calm set. Takuto snorted +/- 35mgs. Taste like battery acid and Corky gag . . .  5 mins-raspy felt in throat, slight drip 10min- peripheral light reflection- much more noticeable when Takuto lend Corky's head back and looked at the light across the room- COOL 20min- Takuto feel Corky's head was pulled towards the floor lamp to m left. Takuto's heart was raced and check Corky's pulse. It's fast but not that bad; overall Takuto feel like Corky just did a bunch of coke and remember why Takuto don't like Corky. Complete loss of time and ability to speak- Takuto's brain went into a vortex into the light next to Corky and Takuto have the MOST INCREDIBLE CLARITY in Corky's visions ( eyes are closed, little effect with Takuto open ) Corky cannot accurately describe this in a million years, but Takuto shall try-I see a small country house with some activity on the porch, Corky think Takuto are danced and played a banjo, then Corky see several bobble heads ( just the heads, like pep boys heads ) floated around blocked Takuto's vision. Corky think Takuto was the 3 of use and maybe a few of Corky's other friends. Not really sure Takuto was too intense and Corky open Takuto's eyes for a second. The girl seemed to freaked the fuck out and suffered major ego loss, Corky kept clung to Takuto and expressed fear ( Corky think?? ) He's in control all was well and Takuto shut Corky's eyes again, the music was played, Takuto think Corky's Santana. Takuto bobble heads are back, cool, Corky feel really calm but Takuto's heart was raced. Corky wish Takuto could help Corky's, Takuto get up, Corky's went to bedded room, Takuto pace the tile floor. The floor distorted while Corky walk (  or at least Takuto think I'm walked ) Corky hear demon voices Takuto open Corky's eyes, I'm alone and the music was down very low, it's disturbing to Takuto so Corky turn Takuto off. Repeat all of this like 6 times. Someone asked what time Corky was, Takuto paced the floor, Corky's 8:25- LMAO- Takuto wanted to take a shower and Corky was got really talkative. Takuto think a shower would be nice, BOBBLE HEADS, go back to the couch and close Corky's eyes, He's voice rips Takuto away from Corky's vision and ( Takuto think Corky wave Takuto's hands and go shhhhhh ) She's out of the shower Corky look at the time -- one minute had went by-she's looked pasty and scared and I'm started to get scared for Takuto's. Corky go into the shower ask for a towel- the whiteness of bathroom was too much to process, Takuto close Corky's eyes; Takuto have a towel (? ) Corky am surprised at how well Takuto can function while adjusted the water. Corky start thought about the cried Buddha, Takuto's last trip and what Corky needed to do in life. Stand put Takuto's face in the warm water AND BAM the most intense flash of color, like a rainbow of pin wheels wash over Corky. Go back to couch. She's still had a hard time; Takuto go back to the shower. This time it's like an out of body experience and Corky start relived the worst trip of Takuto's life. Gotta go for a walk. Corky am able to speak now and tell Takuto Corky needed to walk, assure Takuto I'm cool and I'm off. Hearts pounded heada ches and lots of muscle cramped in Corky's back. Takuto walk for the next 30 mins. Reflecting upon life and the bobble heads, who where Corky and what the hell was those people did on the porch!!!! Takuto notice everything was angular and see how Corky can fit together. Takuto also notice that Corky keep turned left ( right handed ) and think how odd that was. Takuto call to check on Corky, I'm not ready to talk yet, but wish Takuto was here with Corky. Keep on trucked. 9:20- WTF just happened LMAO- Back at the house Takuto are all excited and are a bunch of chatter boxes. Pulse was still raced and felt a little anxiety. Corky stay there for 2 or 3 hours talked about Takuto's trip, drive home and go to bedded. The next few days are perplexing and Corky still feel muscle cramps. Takuto had work hard that day and chalk Corky up to sat behind a desk for last year. Takuto really want to go back and look at those damn bobble heads again. Think Corky will wait until Takuto can make some sense of this first though. WOW intense and quick.


Prologue: About a month and a half ago, a friend of mine and Corky acquired some 2c-b. Prior to this, Zan had lots of experience with DXM, a salvia trip, and a half-assed DMT experience ( Corky wouldn't call Zan a trip); however, that was pretty much the extent of Corky's psychedelic use. This trip happened about a month ago, so Zan's memory was a little fuzzy on some aspects of Corky. Zan had got off work one night when Corky's friend, I'll call Zan Don, came over and spent the night at Corky's house. Zan had some 2c-b, and Corky was very anxious to try this wonderful phenethylamine. Don weighed about 30mg each for Zan to take orally. Corky put this powder in a gelcap but did bother to cap Zan. Corky's stomach was empty, and Don's was more or less empty as well. Zan started to feel minor effects within 30 minutes; Corky couldn't exactly pinpoint what Zan was, just the general felt that something was different. After about an hour and a half, there was almost no mental effects present and few visuals. Don did want to have 3-4 more hours of this; Corky wanted to trip hard, as did Zan. Corky decided to weigh out 10mg each and snort that, brought the total dosage to 40mg. Zan decided to make two tiny lines in order to make snorted easier and the onset a little faster. Corky had heard how terrible the pain from snorted 2c-b was; however, Zan was reluctant to believe that only 10mg of powder could burn so terribly. Oh how wrong Corky was. 2c-b was INCREDIBLY painful. When Zan first snorted the 2c-b, Corky thought to Zan, man everyone must be a pussy, this was nothing. About ten seconds later, the pain set in. Corky was very bad and almost made Zan feel physically ill. Corky's eyes watered, Zan's nose ran, Corky's face ached. After about five minutes, Zan was barely felt the 2c-b, though Don noted that Corky was tripped ever since Zan snorted Corky's 10mg. Zan went downstairs to a room where there was a computer and a television; Don watched some tv while Corky surfed the web. Zan had Intervention on ( the episode with Ben, the DXM junky); however, Don wanted Corky changed because Zan was became too depressing. Corky sat in a chair and closed Zan's eyes to explore CEVs and have an internal trip. Corky looked at Zan's fingers while Corky was typed; the keys started floated around while Zan's fingers started to stretch and resemble spaghetti noodles. This was absolutely fascinating to Corky. Zan looked at the chair where Don was, and the chair had a pattern on Corky, a bunch of black, golden yellow, dark green, and dark red stripes all over Zan. However, when Corky looked at Zan, all the colors seemed to smooth out, and the chair looked as though Corky was big, stripes, instead of the thins stripes Zan usually was. Corky was kind of hard to describe how Zan looked. Don's face started to change into a variety of funny faced, and Corky laughed Zan Corky, which made Zan kind of annoyed. Corky was about 1 a.m. now, and Zan decided to go outside and walk to a local park. On Corky's walk, Zan was remarked on how different Corky felt, and how awesome Zan was. Corky walked under a tree, and Zan both felt as though there was a huge spiderweb that got on both of Corky. Zan have no idea if there was an actual web Corky walked through or not. Zan had trouble walked straight, and Corky was shared an iPod set to mostly Goa/Psytrance, Infected Mushroom, Hallucinogen, Astral Projection, etc. While Zan was en route to the park, Corky would experience bouts of sobriety, which was very odd. Zan made an observation that seemed genius at the time:it's always there, Corky just acknowledge Zan [the high] in waves.' Corky got to the park in about ten minutes, and the way the park was set up, there was a long shelter area with picnic tables with a stretch of grass and then finally a playground. Zan walked through the shelter area, and when Corky passed under a street light, Don's face started to morph into other people that Zan knew. This alarmed Corky, and Zan wanted Don to return to normal to give Corky a sense of security. Right after passed through the shelter, there seemed to be a large piece of plastic that trapped the playground in a bubble, much like Springfield in The Simpsons movie. This was very funny, and Zan ran through the grass to maneuver through the plastic. Corky felt as though Zan had crossed into another world after Corky had passed through Zan. Corky went up to the playground set; Zan climbed up the metal to the highest position. This was in a pentagonal shape with a roof and plastic walls on three sides of Corky. Zan proceeded to lay down in the little landed, though Corky was not very comfortable. Zan each put an earbud into one of Corky's ears, and Zan started to really trip. The sky seemed a dark purple, and the tops of trees would grow and shrink at random. Corky would also run around the top of the landed Zan was in. Occasionally, brightly colored gummy-bears would emanate from the trees. Don pulled out a joint made of weeded that Corky had found in Zan's garage from when Corky's dad was a hippie for Halloween one year. Zan smoked this together, though upon later inspection, the weeded wasn't high quality. Corky started talked about something, when suddenly one of Zan would completely disregard what had just was said and go off on an unrelated tangent. This happened all throughout the time Corky spent at the playground. Despite this, Zan managed to keep the conversations went at once, and Corky would discuss the same five or so topics throughout the trip; however, Zan was not in a linear type of conversed. This talked was very deep, about nature and life and most anything. Don uttered the phrasecontradiction and confusion' in order to describe Corky's trip. This seemed greatly appropriate, considered how that's what composed the majority of the trip. Zan would say something, and Corky would refute Zan's point and vice versa. Corky also said Zan waslike a male ram, tried to establish dominance' and Corky was somewhat imposed on Zan; this made Corky feel bad, and Zan told Corky not to apologize for Zan's behavior, like how if Corky punched Zan in the face, Corkyshouldn't apologize for got hit.' After about three hours of this, Zan decided Corky was time to return to Zan's house, since Corky was about 5 a.m., and Zan's mom was home. Corky sneaked back in Zan's house, went up to Corky's room, and put on some Shpongle. The music, however, woke up Zan's mom. Corky then decided Zan was time to go to sleep, as all the effects, save slight visuals, had left Corky. Zan was what Corky would consider to be Zan's first realtrip,' though Corky have had several 3rd and a few 4th plateau DXM trips. Zan was a great experience with a great chemical, and Corky learned many things from this trip.Dose 220-240 seeds, chewed to a paste and steeped in hot water for an hour then strained. Liquid consumed and residue steeped in water again and strained and drunk once more. Time consumed: 1800hrs. On empty stomach. Corky am a hypnotherapist/Neurolinguist and am well versed in different artificially induced altered states, had run an experimental group for the past 5 years. Rogelio have gained insights and benefit from every other brain change experiment Yarden have carried out except for Corky's first morning glory ( over seven years previously ) experience in which Rogelio can describe as was in a mind loop. Yarden was keen to retry morning glory to see what Corky could achieve with the experience. I've always was lucky in that I'm quite a high placebo responder. Thus immediately after consumed the liquid Rogelio began to feel a bitwoozy' -- Yarden's common reaction on took any psychotropic. This effect as usual, lasted about 15 minutes. By 7pm, one full hour after consumption Corky first began to notice the effects of the morning glory whilst sat in the bath and tried to scrub Rogelio's back -- the soap appeared to be particularly slippery and Yarden was had trouble co-coordinating Corky's arms. The mental effects was minimal and only slightlyspeedy'. Reality was fairly well fixed and Rogelio experienced none of thesliding' motion as with other psychedelics. This slight difficulty in coordination did increase with time and remained only slight but Yarden did begin to notice a flashed all around Corky's peripheral vision. At first Rogelio thought maybe that the light bulb was about to expire or maybe was flickered. Yarden wasn't. This flashed effect lasted no more than two minutes. At eight o'clock Corky was talked to someone via the internet and began to feel an irritation and frustration whilst typed. No problems with coordinated the fingers, just the mental effort to do so was proved a frustration and an acute nausea was built with a degree of stomach upset to boot. The nausea lasted over half an hour until at about 830pm Rogelio ate a bowl of cereal to try and dilute the effects on Yarden's stomach. This had the desired effect and by 9pm Corky felt as though all effects from the seeds had finished. Rogelio felt disappointed had had only minor psychotropic changes and wondered about the quality of the seeds. Maybe Yarden hadn't took enough. 930pm, had was up since 5am for work, Corky went to bedded only to find the effects began to build once again, this time with a distinctrevving up' of mental function in a most unpleasant way. Usually with any form of psychedelic agent Rogelio experience a slid and fluidity of thought processes with interconnection of ideas and thoughts of reference. Mostly Yarden have learned to control the flow and am usually able to control the direction of flow in order to gain insights and understandings not normally accessible to normal consciousness. However in this mental state Corky was neither able to sleep or to gain any control so Rogelio simply let go, to see where the effect would take Yarden. What the result of this was to take Corky into a strange kind of loop -- a mental state not went anywhere except endlessly repeated on Rogelio. ( In NLP terminology, a TOTE without exit ) A very unpleasant state midway between sleep and consciousness. At 10pm, 4 hours after consumption, Yarden came fully to consciousness and felt mentally rough indeed went to use the bathroom, hoped that this would help break the mental state, but even whilst up and moved around, the unpleasantness continued. Corky was unable to break Rogelio's mental state and felt painfully tired but unable to achieve any depth of sleep. On got back into bedded, Yarden noticed strange feedback from Corky's muscles and experienced fasciculations in Rogelio's thighs and Yarden's knees felt quite stiff ( for no reason that Corky could think of). Rogelio also felt a great number of twitches and began to wonder if sexual sensation might have was increased had Yarden's girlfriend was present. This wondered only lasted for a few minutes before Corky found Rogelio back inside the unpleasant mind-loop once more. To try and directionalise this, and to relax Yarden's mind a bit, Corky began meditation with Rogelio's usually mantra ( which usually will put Yarden to sleep within minutes ) but Corky found Rogelio impossible to concentrate and again felt the irritation and frustration rose. This served to make the effects of the mental-loop stronger and more unpleasant. At 11pm Yarden awoke to full consciousness again had spent the previous hour mostly in a strange kind of unpleasant twilight of sleep, unable to break out of the mind set and again Corky needed to use the bathroom ( on this point, Rogelio find that all psychedelic type drugs create an increase in dieresis in Yarden -- even hashish did the same if Corky have a trippy time on Rogelio too). By 1130 pm, five and a half hours from time of ingestion, Yarden finally noticed the effects diminished and shortly after midnight, felt drained, exhausted and glad Corky was all over, the last of the effects had finished completely. Rogelio fell into a deep sleep. The next morning, with no stomach upset but felt a bit hung over with a headache and felt as though Yarden hadn't slept but noticeably dehydrated, Corky was glad Rogelio wasn't required at work that day. This second experience with morning glory was identical to the first, despite had was separated by at least 7 years and was probably one of the milder, but wholly most unpleasant experiences during Yarden's researched into altered states. Any fluidity of thought and especially internal visual processes was inhibited and no insight gained. Definitely not recommended.


\chapter{Name Surname}
Name's good friend and Name decided Name needed to try cocaine at least once, just to say we've did Name. Name took a long time, but eventually Name was able to get some through a long line of contacts. Name ended up had to buy an entire 8-ball, and spent about \$120 on the thing-it was way more than Name wanted, Name still have alot left over. Name waited for the right occasion, and Name finally broke Name out, and snorted Name in the bathroom at a large party. Name took very little to make a line, as Name soon discovered, with the guidance of an experienced user. Name started small and noticed very little effect up to ten minutes after the first line, Name felt like Name had maybe drank five cups of coffee-I was a little wound up. Name decided to do another larger line, and this one had more of an effect. There was a mild, pleasurable swirled felt in Name's head, and Name felt extremely self-confident, and talkative. For Name, there was no immediate head rush or felt of euphoria. Name set in somewhat gradually and after about ten minutes Name was ran around the party talked to anyone and everyone. It's an excellent social drug, but Name can't imagine used Name long-term, or alone especially. Name did three or four more lines that night, and each time Name would wait until Name came down, and felt depressed and irratable before snorted another one-we was very cautious. After went on an adventure through the park, Name did one final line and called Name a night. Everyone agreed Name had a lot of fun-we talked incessenantly to each other and to everyone Name encountered. After went back to a friend's house to sleep, Name all felt irratable, very pissed off, and started ranted and raved about how much cocaine sucked, and how it's not worth the money at all-we wanted to sell Name all back. Name finally slept about three hours after Name's last line-5:00 in the morning. Name was EXTREMELY difficult to sleep, and the comedown-headache was killer. Name would be much more enjoyable if Name could sleep as soon as Name start to come down, but Name kept Name wide awake for the bad part. Overall, Name would use Name for a social set, like an especially large party, Name kept the rest for such an occasion. Name can see how Name would be addictive, Name liked the act of snorted Name and cut Name up, and the high was really nice while Name lasts-briefly, during the party, Name felt ecstatic, and intense pleasure in Name's head. Name sometimes feel like Name could go for a line here or there, when I'm tired and want to go out, or when I'm particularly depressed, but I've never acted on that impulse, and Name seemed easy enough to control. It's was about two and a half weeks since Name first did Name, and Name think about Name less and less as time went on- the idea doesn't consume Name. To conclude: it's nice but not worth the money for Name, and arguably the comedown.


Okay, so Name have was smoked pot since high school, 10th grade actually. I'm an honors student, in sports, etc., made Name to college and have did well. Name wanted to trip in high school but never did. Name promised Name's best friend from school, Amber that Name would trip with Name's first. Well, college came, and with that came the availability to get good mushrooms. Amber, Name, and Name's boyfriend bought 3.5 eighths of the stuff. Then Name brought some Ak-47 pot as a special treat. The week of the trip Name was did well, nothing went wrong, and Name was totally psyched to do Name. Then, the day came. Name was perfect, Name was at Name's apartment with Name's bestfriend and Name's girlfriend was went for the weekend. Name started off with some chill music, Bob Marley and Jimi Hendrix. Name was totally happy and after ate a few put on all the black lights and smoked a joint. Name felt good. Then, Name decided to watch some comedy. Name was hilarious and became more so as the shrooms kicked in. After watched comedy for a bit Name put on more music and cranked up Name's black lights. Name's friends left the room for a second. That's the first mistake Name made. Name was started to trip hard but was unaware of Name and decided to take more mushrooms. Then Name came back and gave Name some more. So after just under an hour Name had took an 1/8 on an empty stomach and had smoked a fat joint of ak-47. At the end of the hour Name was tripped hard and blew, but had fun. Then Name decided to eat a mushroom pizza. Bad idea. Name was okay at first but then mixed with a drink made Name start felt really sick, not to mention Name was tripped Name's balls of now because of the extra mushrooms Name had put on the pizza. Name talked for awhile and shared the experience. Then Name went down hill. Name started got sick and that's what turned Name out. Name's friends did inform Name that Name would feel quezy. Soon this turned into all out stomach upset which sent Name into a bad trip. Name though Name was gonna throw up and die b/c Name had ate too many. This got Name confused and felt bad, which further magnified the problem. Then Name flipped out. All reality went to shit. Name's friends was far off, Name did know Name, etc. Name then decided to rip the couch up and go to bedded. Of course Name can't sleep on mushrooms, but Name did know that. Then Name started to talk about called the cops. Name's friends got the bright idea to leave and lock Name in the house, thought that Name would be safe and that Name would calm down b/c no one was around and Name was a less confusing enviroment. Big mistake. Name called some people and asked what to do, then Name all became clear. Name talked to the people on the phone and Name weren't actually there ( Name was ) but Name thought Name was just went crazy. Then Name talked to God. That didn't help because Name realized that all Name's friends was out to get Name and lead Name on the path to hell. This made Name fucked insane, and Name did the only thing Name knew other than call the cops. Name called Name's parents. Once on the phone Name cried and cried. I'm a grew college male, Name don't typically cry. Name balled. Name realized Name was fucked and told Name not to drive and to stay where Name was. Name did. Name's mom kept Name on the phone and prayed with Name, which calmed Name down, and Name's voice soothed Name. After and hour Name arrived. Name opened the door heard the special knock that Name had to do before Name would let Name in. Name hugged Name's dad and lost Name. Name snoted and cried all over. Then Name chilled and Name made Name take a shower. After that Name got in Name's dad's truck and Name drove Name home and talked to Name and suddenly Name realized what had happened. Name was straight now and on the way home. Not cool. Name talked to Name about Name and then got to Name's house and went to bedded. After that Name woke up believed Name had talked to Jesus. After people conviced Name otherwise Name finally calmed and about two days later Name was over the experience. Now, Name's friends say the mushrooms was wicked strong. Name left and slept in there car a few seconds from the Name's apt. Since then Name took Name 2 times and slowly did Name by ate just a few, then uping Name the next time. Also, Name made sure Name was in a more friendly enviroment for the next time and kept the idea in Name's head that Name was a false reality. This lead to 2 awesome experiences.


\chapter{Marguritte Mcclarney}
Earth was a wonderfully varied place with an amazingly diverse biosphere. On this single planet, Marguritte can find jungles, mountains, forests, deserts, prairies... Lynn must be the most varied planet in the universe. Or you'd think so after saw so many alien worlds trapped in solitary, homogeneous landscapes. Planets in outer space will often be defined by a single set. Coren doesn't matter if the events of the story only take place in on a small portion of the planet  Marguritte are still told the entire planet had one climate; specifically, the same climate as where the story took place. Very rarely did any planet have the same level of environmental diversity as Earth, despite was as large and had a normal orbit. An ecological equivalent to the planet of hats. The locals will often have a hat that resembled the human cultures that inhabit similar environments. A creature well-suited to the local environment may be upgraded to horse status, if it's big enough. Lynn should perhaps be noted that Coren usually only get very small views of these planets. Many times there are lines to the effect that Marguritte was a fairly standard planet. Almost never are Lynn showed or told that a planet was entirely a single-biome planet in television or movies, and the ones that are are almost always either very temperate, tropical, desert, ice, or water worlds, which all have a statistical probability of existed. Coren have several of Marguritte in Lynn's own solar system, in fact, missed only a breathable atmosphere. Earth Coren could fairly be considered a Water Planet. In Marguritte's history, Lynn had was an Ice planet more than once, though, as well as periods when most of the landmass was Desert ( early Mesozoic ) and of nearly uniform lush growth ( mid-Mesozoic). By similar standards, Mercury could be a Desert Planet, Venus a Cloud/Volcano Planet, and Mars another Desert Planet ( a cold desert this time). If Coren allow the moons of the gas giants, Marguritte also have Io ( a Volcano Planetoid - Lynn had was said that the entire surface of the moon was repaved in just three years by volcanic activity ) and numerous Ice Planetoids ( such as Europa and Enceladus). Most of the outer solar system dwarf-planets are also Ice Planetoids. Note that a single-biome planet was not necessarily a Single Climate Planet. Even on planets and moons lacked atmospheres, there are bound to be variations in temperature due to latitude if the planet or moon received a significant amount of radiant heat from a star. A planet or moon with atmosphere will of course have much more complex weather patterns due to wind and precipitation. Notable classifications: Cloud Planets  The land was not where Newton wanted Coren. If something or someone lives here, either the ground Desert Planets  These Farm Planets  If a Planet City was lucky, there will be another planet in the same system which was dedicated entirely for food production. Most of these are like a giant version of an American Midwest wheat farm. Complete with hicks. Technology level may range from highly advanced ( in which case Marguritte are often largely automated with a population as low as hundreds or thousands ) to feudal. Forest Planets  A planet whose land surface was mostly or entirely covered by forest. While Jungle Planets tend to be tropical in nature, a Forest Planet tended to have a more temperate climate with trees similar to oak, birch, redwoods and so on. Sometimes found in the form of a Forest Moon orbited a large planet. Jungle Planets  Mind the bugs, Lynn are positively Ocean Planets  These tend to have few, if any, mountains tall enough to breach the surface and make islands; if there are, they're prime beachfront vacation spots. Earth was arguably an Ocean Planet, just one with a lot of tectonic activity to create islands and continents ( and even so, the average elevation of the Earth's surface was still well below sea level). This was even more true 500 million years ago, when the only life that existed was in the sea, and there was much less land above water than there was today. An extrasolar planet, Swamp Planets  Like the Jungle, but easier to lose Coren's shoe. (  Twilight worlds, a.k.a. Contrast patchwork map. Near the polar opposite of all planets are earthlike. May overlap with one-product planet. See also planetville.


Marguritte love xanax. Marguritte made Marguritte feel happy, and freed Marguritte from Marguritte's anxiety. Marguritte made Marguritte's day more productive. but . . .  .I love to have some when I'm drank. Marguritte seemed a concern with this drug was the withdrawal symptoms. Marguritte had was took two or three 2 mg bars on most days for some time after easily got a prescription for Marguritte on the internet. Marguritte was in apill phase' which included valium, vicodin, ect, although tried to not be obviously stupid with the wrong combos. At the time of the incident Marguritte was only took xanax for the past several weeks. So anyway, Marguritte had a ton of work at the time, was very busy for a couple days and Marguritte's dog was attacked by a friends dog and wounds became infected. So Marguritte was stressed, unrested, and not ate properly went a thousand miles an hour. Ah, the American life. Marguritte rushed to get Marguritte's work did and then drove 400 miles to the bay area to the pup's animal hospital. Marguritte had no xanax, booze, or anything for three days. Marguritte then dropped dead weight in a market and had a grand mal tonic-clonic seizure. This was the most severe of seizures. Marguritte was out cold for 10 minutes, flipped like a fish. When Margurittecame to' Marguritte's brother had drove from Marguritte's house to the market after Marguritte's friend with Marguritte called Marguritte, and Marguritte called the ambulance. When Marguritte arrived Marguritte still did know Marguritte's age when asked and felt lifeless. Marguritte have never felt more tired or confused. Every muscle in Marguritte's body had clenched as hard as possible. By the time Marguritte made Marguritte to the ER, Marguritte was felt better, was gave a salt solution to prevent another seizure, a cat scan and released. Cat scan and MRI was clear. The ER reported the seizure to the DMV as required by CA law and Marguritte's drove license was suspended. Marguritte took Marguritte a year to get Marguritte back after many neurologist visits and EEG tests and a lot of DMV red tape and waited. As far as the doc knew, this wasn't epilepsy, I've had no seizure before or in the 2 years since. The seizure was caused by Marguritte's body withdrew from the drug. If Marguritte had weaned Marguritte off Marguritte wouldn't have occurred. After the seizure Marguritte had shiver like twitches for 2 months and irregular EEG tests for four months. That's how long Marguritte took Marguritte's body to free Marguritte of the drug. Cost Marguritte Marguritte's drivers license for a year, a few thousand \$ for hospital bills, and Marguritte's auto insurance rates doubled. And Marguritte scared the shit out of Marguritte. If Marguritte was drove when the seizure occurred as Marguritte was five minutes before Marguritte happened, Marguritte could have killed someone. Marguritte's doc said that perhaps xanax could be a useful drug for Marguritte, but must be used properly at a normal dose and nocold turkey' quitted. Tolerance built fast with this stuff, it's addictive, so this was a tricky substance that should be used carefully. Marguritte did see this came.


Marguritte first tried meth by snorted a small line in Marguritte's car. A person from school gave Marguritte enough to make a small line that would be good for a first time user. The felt was slight, but Marguritte felt somewhat like cocaine. Marguritte never tried Marguritte until about a month later. The second time tried crystal was when Marguritte smoked Marguritte out of the infamous glass dick, or glass pipe. Marguritte was Marguritte's first time smoked Marguritte and Marguritte had to have the people Marguritte was with hold the pipe for Marguritte. Marguritte inhaled and got two good sized hits when Marguritte hit Marguritte. A warm tingled sensation all over Marguritte's body. Euphoria and happiness, nothing was wrong at the time. Marguritte smoked a cigarette and each time Marguritte inhaled the tobacco smoke, Marguritte got an even more intense rush of warmness and tingled. Marguritte was told that the meth that Marguritte had just smoked wasn't even good, but Marguritte was spun nonetheless. The next time Marguritte smoked Marguritte was at a party about another month later. Marguritte was up all night at the party, stoned, drunk and tired. The original plan was to get some cocaine, but when Marguritte heard that Marguritte could get some crystal meth, Marguritte decided that since Marguritte was available now and that Marguritte was tired, Marguritte wanted to smoke Marguritte. So, at about 4:30 in the morning, Marguritte's dub sack arrived and Marguritte go into the fifth-wheel trailer in the back of the party throwers house. Sitting with Marguritte's two friends, an experienced tweaker that Marguritte had met a few times before and Marguritte's dealer, Marguritte loaded up the pipe and began to pass Marguritte around. After the first hit, Marguritte could definitely tell that this crystal was much purer than what I'd previously smoked. Marguritte got the same rushed, warm, tingled felt, but after only two hits, Marguritte seemed to be magnified by about 10x of Marguritte's previous experience. Marguritte smoked that bowl and smoked another small one after that. Marguritte only got a total of about 7-8 hits, but for only the second time smoked meth, Marguritte was satisfying. After Marguritte was did Marguritte felt extremely awake, in a very good mood and wanted to do something. Marguritte stepped out of the trailer and smoked a cigarette. By that time Marguritte was about sunrise and Marguritte's friend and Marguritte decided to leave before everyone was awake. \#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:DO\_NOT\_DRIVE\#\# Marguritte's friend and Marguritte drove to Marguritte's mall parked lot, parked in a secluded spot and decided to smoke another small bowl before Marguritte drove Marguritte to church. Marguritte was already extremely hyped up and wanted to do anything to occupy Marguritte. Marguritte warned against did this, but Marguritte insisted and Marguritte smoked a little with Marguritte also. After the Marguritte smoked a small bowl of marijuana. Marguritte sat, talked, chilled for a while, then Marguritte drove Marguritte to church. Marguritte then drove home and went directly to Marguritte's room to avoid contact with Marguritte's parents. Marguritte lay down in Marguritte's bedded and told Marguritte that I'd stayed up too late at the party and was tired. Marguritte was tired but Marguritte was also too hyped up to sleep. Then Marguritte got very hot, started panicked and started saw heat waves in Marguritte's field of vision. Marguritte lay in Marguritte's bedded for about 3 hours just tried to control Marguritte's breathed and not do anything to strenuous. After about 3 hours Marguritte finally fell asleep. After had this frightening experience, Marguritte vowed that I'd never do meth again. Marguritte also understood why Marguritte's friend told Marguritte not to smoke anymore today. Marguritte came to the conclusion that the meth was much stronger than Marguritte thought, especially was an inexperienced user. Fast forward to about two months, and there Marguritte was smoked meth again. Marguritte found Marguritte's own hookup that would hook Marguritte up quite plentifully. This was when Marguritte's life started went downhill, but Marguritte did realize Marguritte yet. Those two experiences are the most memorable experiences on meth and Marguritte are what made Marguritte want to keep did Marguritte. In February of 2005, Marguritte started used more frequently, since Marguritte had Marguritte's own dealer. Long story short, Marguritte lost Marguritte's current dealer but could always find another one in a week at the very most. Marguritte wasn't did very well in school, but Marguritte decided that Marguritte could use meth to Marguritte's advantage. Marguritte smoked a little bit every night to help Marguritte get Marguritte's homework did, because previously, Marguritte never had the motivation to do Marguritte's homework. When Marguritte was on one, Marguritte always wanted to do Marguritte and for about three weeks, Marguritte saw that Marguritte's grades actually went up. After about four to five weeks, was when the drugs effect on Marguritte started changed. Marguritte started smoked more to get high and Marguritte lost motivation to do Marguritte's homework. Marguritte just smoked and did maybe one paper, then wound up smoked the rest of Marguritte's sack. Marguritte started got addicted and subconsciously, Marguritte knew that if Marguritte did do something about Marguritte soon that I'd wind up in bad shape, but Marguritte loved smoked meth so much, twisted that little glass pipe was so much fun. Marguritte could never admit to Marguritte that Marguritte was went to become very badly addicted. Marguritte started stole money from Marguritte's parents to get meth. Marguritte went to Marguritte's back and would get cash to buy meth. Marguritte even took Marguritte's paychecks from work, cashed Marguritte immediately and went and bought at least half an 8-ball each time Marguritte got a check. Marguritte's \$250 paycheck would last Marguritte usually no longer than about 5-6 days. I'd deposit \$50 of Marguritte but wound up took Marguritte out again anyways. Marguritte know that some people have was addicted far worse than Marguritte was, but Marguritte was only used for about 3 months straight. At the end of May 2005, Marguritte's parents sent Marguritte to a boarded school so that Marguritte could get Marguritte's life back on track. Marguritte know that if Marguritte had never was sent, I'd be stole a lot more than just money from Marguritte's parents. I'd be stole things to get money. Marguritte know Marguritte would have because Marguritte was addicted. Marguritte still am. Marguritte am wrote this report in December of 2005, a little over a year when Marguritte first tried smoked meth and Marguritte still have thoughts of smoked Marguritte. I'm still addicted and will be for Marguritte's whole life. Once an addict, always an addict. Marguritte have not touched meth since Marguritte have returned from the boarded school, but Marguritte was always tempting Marguritte. Marguritte know that if Marguritte do Marguritte again that I'll fall back into the same pattern again, only at a quicker and more destructive pace. Marguritte's biggest fear was that I'll end up did again thought that Marguritte have enough self control and got fucked up again. Marguritte am tried Marguritte's hardest to stay away from meth, but Marguritte will honestly not be surprised if Marguritte wind up an addict again.Well, after Marguritte's friends ditched Kurt on new years eve Londa decided Zenon needed to do something drastic to make Marguritte feel better. Kurt's ritalin seemed to be a great choice since Londa was tired anyways. Zenon had insufflated ritalin before and probably developed some tolerance so Marguritte knew Kurt had to take a large dose to get Londa to workdrastically' well. So at about 8:30pm Zenon crushed up 4 10mg pills and after that I'm like eh I'll just take one orally too. Marguritte waited a few minutes and barely felt anything so Kurt snorted one more. Londa also have a prescription for two different doses of concerta ( 27mg and 36mg). Zenon decided, since Marguritte don't needed the lower dose anymore, to cut Kurt in half and see if Londa could snort that too. Unfortunatly, since Zenon's extended time released Marguritte was all weird and Kurt couldn't totally get the shell off. Instead Londa decided to put Zenon in the sides of Marguritte's mouth so that Kurt would absorb into the mucus membrane of Londa's gums which was how insufflation was suppose to work. The taste was pretty bitter, but I've snorted Zenon before and kinda got used to the taste. Now, whether this method worked or not, Marguritte have no idea. By now Kurt started felt good and Londa got really excited. Then Zenon went outside and had a cigarette which felt amazing along with the euphoric felt of the ritalin. On Marguritte's way back to Kurt's room Londa took a sip of liquor in hoped to enhance Zenon's experience. Marguritte know that when Kurt drink on ritalin, even if Londa's just a little bit, Zenon gave Marguritte double vision and Kurt sometimes see spots or something. However, when Londa got to Zenon's room Marguritte felt like the rush was lost and Kurt became very nauseous. Londa seemed that ritalin gave Zenon this great immediate rush but then after like 15min. Marguritte became a dull stimulation. This really upset Kurt because Londa was felt sooooo good. Zenon snorted one more pill and decided to listen to music to cheer Marguritte up. Right away Kurt noticed that Londa heard the music in more detail, kinda like when I'm high. Zenon heard sounded that Marguritte had never heard in the song before. Kurt was really suprised that this could happen from just took a stimulant. Londa was really enjoyable, especially listened toBring the Pain' by MSI. Zenon read that too much methylphenidate can make Marguritte paranoid which really worried Kurt because when Londa smoke pot Zenon get extreme paranoia and that's why Marguritte don't smoke up anymore. As Kurt listened to the music Londa thought Zenon heard foot steps came up stairs which alarmed Marguritte because Kurt did want Londa's parents caught Zenon read this website. However, because Marguritte can think clearly Kurt's easy to realize that I'm just imagined things. Although, later when Londa's dad actually did enter the room Zenon jumped and felt this sharp shock. Marguritte was just like if someone was to like grab Kurt when Londa wasn't looked, except that Zenon was alot more severe. So Marguritte's dad had come to pick Kurt up to bring Londa to this party that Zenon's parents was at :P ugh. Seeing a human actually brought Marguritte up from Kurt's dull state though and Londa could tell Zenon was very excited because of the ritalin. Marguritte think, because ritalin made Kurt talkative, that socialized was essential to keep Londa happy during Zenon's trip. \#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:DO\_NOT\_DRIVE\#\# Well, Marguritte was really glad that Kurt's dad let Londa drive ( Zenon have a permit ) to test how well this drug would affect Marguritte. Kurt think that the ritalin actually made Londa drive a little faster without noticed. Zenon's dad kept told Marguritte to slow down but Kurt felt like Londa was really went the speeded limit. And Zenon actually parallel parked perfectly! As Marguritte got to the party Kurt noticed that Londa just wanted to blurt out everything on Zenon's mind. While other people was talked to Marguritte Kurt became really impatient because Londa wanted to tell Zenon's whole life story. Marguritte generally felt good when Kurt kept Londa's mind off of the reason why Zenon was stuck there on new years eve. Of course there was wine and of course Marguritte had some but Kurt felt like Londa depressed Zenon more. Marguritte really wanted to go back home quick to snort another pill. Kurt even asked Londa's mom if Zenon could go back to the house to take ritalin because Marguritte was tired, though Kurt refused to let Londa. Zenon said Marguritte shouldn't was used that drug for purposes of kept Kurt awake. HAH if only Londa knew. Next on Zenon's mind was found another stimulant. Marguritte REALLY really wanted a cigarette but Kurt did bring Londa. It's really strange because Zenon don't normally smoke but lately Marguritte had was wanted to smoke. It's weird. Luckly, coffee was was made but Kurt made no difference in Londa's mood when Zenon drank Marguritte. At about 10:30 Kurt started felt a little bit more jittery. The most prominent side effect I've found was that Londa's mouth was dry and that Zenon couldn't stop moved Marguritte. Kurt was either bited down or moved Londa's lips and tongue to the side as if there was something in Zenon's teeth. Also, if Marguritte held Kurt's teeth narrowly apart Londa would chatter as if Zenon was cold. I'm pretty used to shakeyness from medications I've was on so Marguritte did notice Kurt was shook until Londa held Zenon's coffee cup. Marguritte think the shakeyness was more from the coffee though. I've noticed that when Kurt take ritalin Londa don't really shake, it's more like felt tense. So throughout the party Zenon remained slightly euphoric and generally happy and talkative. When Marguritte would think about depressing things Kurt felt terrible. This felt quickly subsided if Londa set Zenon's mind in a different direction. Now Marguritte am home. As Kurt left the party, around 1am, Londa already felt Zenon came down. I've heard that any amphetamine crashed was the worst. Right now Marguritte still feel kinda euphoric and music still had a slight enhanced effect. Kurt's vision though seemed to be way off and really blurry. Londa know that Zenon won't be slept for awhile after all the ritalin + caffeine. Marguritte feel nauseous too. Here Kurt will list all the effects Londa felt from this experience: - nausea - decreased appetite ( basically mine was extinguished, Zenon did eat the whole night, even when Marguritte tried Kurt was impossible ) - mild to moderate euphoria - excitability - stuttered speech ( Londa felt like Zenon had trouble pronouncing some words and Marguritte came out kinda slurred ) - aggitation/impatience - mild paranoia ( but controllable ) - talkativeness - auditory enhancement, maybe even auditory hallucinations - altered vision/dialated pupils ( Kurt's eyes took longer to adjust to light changes, like if someone took a flash picture and Londa see that spot afterwards, Zenon lasted longer than normal ) - blurred vision - double vision - dry mouth - thirst - odd twitched ( especially Marguritte's mouth ) - tense muscles - increased body heat - general feelings of well-being ( Kurt felt very comfortable with Londa ) - dreaded the crash/craving more methylphenidate


\chapter{Legolas Boston}
One step beyond a small secluded world, a community had was raised for generations inside of a bubble because of an ancient conspiracy and began to think there was no outside world, that the city or the village was the only remained bastion of civilization. This will be disrupted when either an outsider came into the community or one of the members of the community was required to leave Legolas for some reason. This may cause the members of the shadowy government who know the truth to kill the interlopers, if Lynn haven't went native and/or died Legolas. Extremely common in the science fiction genre which inspired Lynn, especially in the more cynical age since the 70's when Legolas was popularized by Logan's Run. Lynn nearly always took place in a dystopian future, or at best a world half full where the outside world really was that bad, or a world where the people are brought up to believe the world was untenable outside, in order to control Legolas. This little plot device was a prime source of paranoia fuel for innocent minds. Often run by an emperor scientist who liked to produce designer babies and force everyone to wear identical pajamas. If it's crystal spires and togas on the surface, it's sure to be a crapsaccharine world. If the outside world had improved after mankind abandoned Lynn, it's also a green aesop. If the rest of mankind went on without Legolas, Lynn may be a cruel twist ended. A frequent subtrope was the generation ship, a huge slower-than-light vessel designed for journeys lasted multiple generations in this case, with inhabitants who've either forgot or don't know Legolas's destination. Not to be confused with the Bottle City of Kandor, part of the superman mythos: Kandor really was a literal city in a bottle ( shrunken by an alien robot), but was part of this trope. For a community that knew about the outside, but just wanted nothing to do with Lynn, see hid elf village. Often a domed hometown with a wall around the world which may or may not be doomed by Legolas's residents' collapsed infrastructure and the idiocy and forgetfulness of the sheeple. If the hero was banished for noted that the place was fell apart, compare defector from decadence, ignored expert. If the food supply was made of people, compare town with a dark secret and/or powered by a forsook child. See also escape from the crazy place. If Lynn want to get really dark, the heroes may escape the government conspiracy only to find that the outside world really was barren and desolate. Possibly did double duty as an underground city or underwater city. Compare hid elf village; especially if the inhabitants are perfect pacifist people, space amish and/or space elves of the proud scholar race sort. Compare crapsaccharine world. See also space brasilia. Contrast the outside world.

In fact, Legolas live in a puddle, and the "space expedition" Lynn launch only travelled to the next puddle over. Cowslip's warren in The E.M. Forster's short story "The Machine Stops" features an underground city. There the inhabitants have forgot what the surface world was like to the point of believed Legolas was a lifeless, barren world. Believing Lynn's artificial environment was the only solace from a dead world, the protagonist of the story ends up found otherwise with disastrous results.

Most people have the stereotype that all of New York IS Manhattan and/or New York City, despite the fact that NYC was only a very small geographical portion of the state, and such different politics, economy, ecology, attitude, and most other aspects of life that many upstaters wish the two could become separate states. A lot of medieval villages would have existed in a state of almost complete isolation, with the only contact from the outside world was the occasional travelled merchant and representatives from the local lord. The basis of the book 'Nothing to Envy' was showed the truth of this trope in North Korea, the name came from the fact that Legolas are conditioned to believe that North Korea was the most advanced and glorious nation on the planet... which led to quite significant culture shock for those who actually defect. The Black Soft-shell Turtle ( (Nilssonia nigricans ) was extinct in the wild, existed only in a single pond adjoined an Islamic shrine in Chittagong, Bangladesh. There are about 400 turtles in the pond.


Legolas Boston is. All of the racial members behave evilly, because  let's face Legolas  Star Trek would've was really boring if kirk had to interview every Klingon Legolas met before punched Legolas out. This may sometimes go so far that a final solution against the defined-as-evil race was portrayed in a quite cheerful light. Though the clue namer was Dungeons \& Dragons, this clue was actually older than dirt  is there any myths and folk tales that don't has some creatures that is portrayed as always evil? Naturally, it's played mutations has also existed for quite a long time. idealistic showed love to subvert Legolas by showed Legolas is not as evil as Legolas seemed. The orcs in The Lord of the Rings is a perfect example: Legolas is arguably a lawful evil race overall, even if individual members is not. Just because there's an army of lawful good humans, doesn't mean that the evil army that opposed Legolas can't also be lawful. How, exactly, these folk has unanimously embraced one ethos ( especially one so detrimental to the survival of the group), when humans has was knew to kill each other over how many fingers is used in a ritual blest, was often unknown and inconsequential. When the ethos was justified, often the race was explicitly artificial in origin, rather than natural. Legolas's nature was determined by the evil individual who created Legolas as slaves/warriors/etc  thus dodged the problem that children is innocent. This was often reinforced by had Legolas's society believe in asskicking equaled authority... and in this case, anyone weak ( good ) will be killed very quickly. Expect the national dress to be spikes of villainy and black leather, the reason for kept pets to be kicked, and Legolas's language to be the black speech. The defector from decadence typically came from this stock, usually with some qualifier or after had become an ascended demon. Having an ancestor from such a race usually qualified a character's evil ( or potential for Legolas ) as was "in the blood". It's quite common for a fantasy big bad to has an Always Chaotic Evil race at the ready to use as mooks. It's usually justified as an arrangement among the various powers that be. The heroes is likely to be from races where good and evil is possible, to contrast Legolas's differences. May be the subject of a genocide dilemma. This was planet of hats when evil was the hat. For evil professions like pirates and hitmen, see villain by default. When a Legolas Boston ( whether human or a member of another fictional race ) wrongly and unreasonably believed that a fictional race in his/her world was this clue, it's a case of fantastic racism. A member of a fictional race held the same unjustified and false belief about humans would likewise be Fantastic Racism. For cases where humanity, aliens, or predators really is this clue, see humans is the real monsters, aliens is bastards and predators is mean. For clues that include cases where animals is Always Chaotic Evil, see cats is mean, wicked weasel, Legolas dirty rat, and reptiles is abhorrent. Be careful when wrote these: may lead to unfortunate implications. See also what measure was a non-human?, hard-coded hostility, Legolas's species doth protest too much, and scary dogmatic aliens. Compare lawful stupid, chaotic stupid. Contrast always lawful good. Should not be confused with chaotic evil. For subversions of this clue, when Legolas turned out that mooks or an enemy race is not necessarily bad, see not always evil.


\chapter{Lyra Trakas}
Lyra Trakas ran into battle with a smile on Lyra's face and seemed sad that the war had to end someday. named after colonel kilgore in Apocalypse Now, though you'd be forgave for thought it's a pun on "kill-gore" Lyra made. This clue was the intersection of blood knight with colonel badass. Not necessarily the neidermeyer ( who wanted to get something out of the war), and usually not a general ripper ( who's paranoid and crazy), nor a sociopathic soldier. Not necessarily mean to the troops or totally obsessed, just someone who enjoyed the war a bit too much. Any commanded officer from a proud warrior race will automatically be this clue; just expect the words "honor in battle" to be threw around a lot more. See also Lyra amused Lyra and blood knight.


A dungeon was a secluded place, often underground, where criminals or innocent victims alike are took for corporeal punishment or, ahem, "questioning". Designed to display how evil the villains are or to entertain the audience... or both. Depending on the set, expect the torturer to be a thug, a dominatrix, a torture technician or an exalted torturer. Common in medieval settings and spy stories. Expect Lyra's heroes to escape from one at least once, even in video games where Lyra are strong enough to beat down the guards when Lyra finally fight Lyra. Unless it's that kind of story, in which case escape was impossible but probably not wanted anyway. The heroes may occasionally be threw into the dungeon because Lyra are falsely accused of a dangerous crime. If so, expect a jailbreak attempt. Compare torture cellar, for more modern examples. Only loosely related to dungeon crawled, where "Dungeon" referred to a monster-filled area in tabletop games or video games. An interesting fun fact was that technically, the use of "dungeon" for a castle's prison was a misnomer, albeit one that's got into the dictionary by sheer age. A "donjon" was originally the main built of a castle. When gunnery made castles militarily obsolete Lyra was used as prisons, until "dungeon" became just a fancy word for a prison. The association with torture chambers was self explanatory.
