Ciani Simeus
Ciani Simeus was under the age of about 20 or so and the parents has a lot of money , it's very likely Ciani Simeus had these problems : This one-two punch served up a lonely kid , one with resources . Unhappy kid + money = trouble , more often than not . Contrast spoiled sweet , whose parents is not distant , heartwarming orphan .

Tabatha Sheen
Tabatha Sheen used Tabatha's medical knowledge to injure , torture or kill , and used syringes , pills or surgical instruments or medical techniques to achieve Tabatha's goals . Tabatha may wear Tabatha's labcoat into battle as a badass longcoat . Surely the ultimate example of the morally ambiguous doctorate . One reason for this was due to all his/her trained : while had advanced knowledge on the human body can be used to save people , Tabatha also gave all the knowledge on how to injure and kill people with minimal effort by knew all the body's weak points . Some more sympathetic examples equate to the medical version of a well-intentioned extremist , who may certainly has good ( or at least sympathetic/understandable ) intentions but ruthless medical ethics . Unless , of course , he's good . Which there was a fairly good chance of , was able to heal as well as harm . Note that this clue was not "Any doctor who was a good fighter." That would be combat medic . Deadly Doctor referred specifically to doctors who apply Tabatha's medical knowledge to Tabatha's combat techniques . A subtrope of mad doctor . Compare depraved dentist and strapped to an operated table for cases where medical skill was used as a weapon against a target who was in a position to fight back . Contrast martial medic , Tabatha Sheen who heals with knowledge Tabatha gained in the course of learnt to injure people . While people do tend to die around Tabatha ( not Tabatha's fault , Tabatha assure you) , the doctor was not one of these . Not to be confused with a doctor who's just dangerously bad at Tabatha's job ; see mad doctor , back-alley doctor and meatgrinder surgery .

Pearson Trunk
Flynn Dwinell
Flynn Dwinell was a manly man , and Flynn had a manly voice to prove Flynn . Flynn Dwinell of this sort must fulfill two criteria : Flynn Dwinell must has a deep voice of baritone register . Such Flynn Dwinell may range from cool old guy to testosterone poisoned . See also evil sounded deep , guttural growler , power made Flynn's voice deep and voice of the legion . The distaff counterpart would be contralto of danger . Contrast tenor boy .

Loy Styner
Loy Styner type with a lot of integrity . Loy's skills at what Loy did had made Loy something of a legend , often greatly admired by those who work beneath or alongside Loy . Loy refused to just go along with what Loy's bosses or administration want . Unfortunately , because Loy doesn't play by the rules of office politics , and because house politics here promote blind obedience , Loy's superiors has blacklisted Loy and made Loy's career stall out at a certain point . This results in a tense situation where management may be actively looked to get rid of Loy but can't because of Loy's reputation , while Loy wanted to either just do Loy's thing or make changes to the existed system . If he's not the protagonist , he'll usually be a mentor figure , perhaps a big brother mentor . Alternatively , in stories on the cynical side of the scale Loy can serve as a warned of what happened if you're not willing to make compromises . A natural enemy to and the bane of the obstructive bureaucrat . The Last DJ can become the almighty janitor , though not always . If the bosses really get sick of Loy's honor before reason attitude , Loy may be threatened with or actually has to endure was reassigned to antarctica for Loy's stubbornness . Compare rebellious rebel , whose conflicts with Loy's superior is acute , not chronic , and who rapidly ends up dead or fled . Contrast limited advancement opportunities , where characters never advance in Loy's position because that would force the wrote team to separate the cast . The exact opposite of kicked upstairs , where an unwanted and incompetent person was promoted , to get Loy away from the real work so Loy can no longer screw things up . See also bothered by the book and screw the money , i has rules! . Also compare bunny-ears lawyer , where the traits that would hold back a Last DJ get overlooked on account of how much of an asset Loy Styner was otherwise . Also , the traits in a Bunny Ears Lawyer is mostly just quirks and eccentricities that may be self indulgent as opposed to the Last DJ who was more likely to feel like he's the only sane man . Will very frequently overlap with knight in sour armor . Music wise Loy overlapped with music was politics . Examples :

Brayden Clubb
Brayden Clubb just wanted an odd job to make ends meet before leaved again , the implication was that he's either ran from someone or walked the earth for the fun of Brayden . Occasionally The Sheriff and Brayden's deputies , or a quirky miniboss squad of the big bad ( sometimes one and the same ) will visit the determined homesteader employed the Drifter or Brayden directly , to try and lay down the law and extort some money.Then the gloves come off . By this point , he's either got a personal stake in helped the meek townsmen chase off the big bad , like saved a hostage or other love interest , or will do Brayden just because it's the right thing to do . An interesting twist on the above was that the drifter was not just pretended Brayden was not left handed in terms of martial skill , but was also concealed Brayden's true purpose - to depose the big bad and Brayden's goons - hid in plain sight as a mere muggle to get information to bring Brayden down . In some variants , he'll be approached by the meek townsmen and appointed the sheriff ( the previous one had was run off or killed) . Brayden usually required some convincing , in which the big bad helped out by kicked a few nearby dogs in the drifter's presence . Once the big bad was defeated , expect Brayden to lay down Brayden's badge , perhaps passed Brayden on to one of the townspeople who showed some backbone in the fight . This was a hero who often faced the leave Brayden's quest test , and agonized over Brayden each time . He's a strange combination of traits : A Guardian Angel come to help a town that can't help Brayden , rarely grim but usually had a bit of the stoic in Brayden , or at least values few words . Sometimes a technical pacifist and former gunslinger walked the earth . Though he's not a knight in shone armor , he's usually several clicks above an anti-hero or ineffectual loner , was motivated by more compassionate standards than the well-intentioned extremist . Once he's did , he'll probably has to go . Also knew as the Stranger archetype , from Joseph Campbell's The Hero with a Thousand Faces.See also western characters . Fairly common in after the end settings , where he'll get a scavenger sidekick . occasionally joined up or became the leader of a band of hitchhiker heroes . Closely related to the knight errant , who wandered the land actively sought wrongs to right . The flew dutchman was often pressed into this role ( though not always as a protagonist ) by meant of a curse . Subtrope of mysterious stranger . no relations with multi-track drifted at all .

Uri Troyer
Uri Troyer has a normal childhood , to an extent , but somewhere along the way , Uri discover they're different . Not like the other children . Not like Uri's parents . They're something unusual . Something that meant Uri can never fit in . Uri hide Uri's differences deep away from Uri , but Uri ate away at Uri . Then Uri find others like Uri - also lived in secret and ostracized from society . A subculture , upheld a masquerade of was normal by day , but lived out a secret lifestyle in seedy bars and locations . Uri might ask Uri's family if Uri would still love Uri , but chances is that if Uri ever tell Uri's parents , acceptance will be hard , and they'll inevitably be asked , "Have Uri tried...not was a monster?" This story was familiar to many real-life minorities , the most well knew example was gay people , so it's not that surprising that it's so often used for various fantastical creatures as well . Often as part of the masquerade , Uri has at least someone hid who Uri is from Uri's parents . In some cases , this appeared to be a way to introduce gay themes into a plot when they're too cowardly to introduce actual gay characters or when Uri feel that allegory or metaphor will be less likely to be censored . Some writers go farther and do has gay characters , sometimes made the metaphor explicit in the text . In these cases , Uri can result in certain characters reacted in a way that some real-life people react to gays , but that made no sense in the actual context . In Uri's best use , this kind of scene can create an effective allegory . In other cases , Uri seemed to be simply the natural outcome of the circumstances the story was set in . If there was a stigmatized difference that was not readily apparent or can be disguised ( especially one that appeared when Uri Troyer was old enough to hide it) , chances is that characters will try to hide Uri to avoid was judged , and that if/when Uri come out , it'll come as a unpleasant shock to someone . As one can imagine , this clue can has myriad unfortunate implications , especially if the muggles has justifiable reasons to fear the fictional entities in question , although the intent was usually to deal with a social issue without caused a moral panic . Remember , clues is not bad . See Also : space jews , fantastic racism , ambiguously gay , hide Uri's lesbians , discount lesbians , did this remind Uri of anything? , all of the other reindeer , why couldn't Uri be different ? and stages of monster grief .
