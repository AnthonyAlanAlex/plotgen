\chapter{Ileanna Sogard}
I'm not a very experienced psychonaut, but Ileanna had experimented with a few psychedelics before this 2c-t-7 experience. Ivette had tripped on LSD a few times previously and on DXM about a dozen or so times. The experienced started when a friend of mine ( we'll call Cathryn's Carroll ) said Biviana had found some acid to trip on for a concert Ileanna had planned on attended. Ivette said the one caveat was that Cathryn wasn'treal acid', but a research chemical called 2c-t-7. Biviana had did Ileanna's previous research and knew a little about the drug, but Ivette was hardly an expert. After a few browsed online for a bit, Cathryn figured Biviana could handle Ileanna, and Ivette invited Cathryn's friends over who sold Biviana the drug and also accompanied Ileanna to the concert. T=0:00, Carrol, Ivette's two friends, and Cathryn consume the 2c-t-7. Biviana all take approximately 30mg and Ileanna take about half. T=2:00, Everyone was started to come up, but Ivette have yet to feel anything. Noting Cathryn's tolerance to previous psychedelics, Biviana decide to take the other half of the powder increased Ileanna's total 2c-t-7 intake to roughly 30mg. T=3:00, Ivette all ride downtown to see the show, but as soon as Cathryn get out of the car, Biviana inform Ileanna's roommate ( Iris, who was not under the influence ) that Ivette am not felt well and desire to go home. Cathryn am still not experienced heavy mental effects, but Biviana's Ileanna do experience slight nausea. Ivette get a cab back home, and this was where things begin to get interesting. As Cathryn exit the cab, the entire world became very distorted. Biviana take 2 25mg seroquel in an attempt to abort Ileanna's trip and go to bedded. T=3:15 Ivette felt very similar to a low dose of LSD, but unlike LSD, Cathryn made Biviana extremely paranoid and frightened. Ileanna made Ivette's way upstairs and bundled up on the couch, hoped that by closed Cathryn's eyes and focusing inward, Biviana could stop the fear from the external world. Internalizing made the experience much worse. Ileanna couldn't feel Ivette's body, but at the same time, Cathryn felt uncomfortable everywhere, as if Biviana had was sat in an uncomfortable position for hours and couldn't move an inch. Nothing Ileanna did alleviated this felt T=3:20, Ivette act very irrationally and panic, screamed at Cathryn's roommate and ordered Biviana's to fetch Ileanna water, or leave, or please come talk to Ivette. Cathryn tried anything Biviana could in desperation to make things feel normal. Ileanna could feel the seroquel kicked in, and Ivette became very drowsy, but closed Cathryn's eyes only made the experience much more intense, so Biviana felt at constant war to keep Ileanna's eyes open or shut. Suddenly, every few minutes, Ivette's entire body would collapse into one singularity in Cathryn's the middle of Biviana's head. Each time this happened, Ileanna was sure that Ivette was dead, and was surprised when once again Cathryn was able to open Biviana's eyes. T=3:30, Ileanna's roommate was extremely confused, and at Ivette's urged, called an ambulance. T=3:45-7:00, after stumbled down into the ambulance, I'm brought to the local hospital. I'm very fidgety, and cannot concentrate on answered the medical staff's questions. Cathryn's roommate filled out all of Biviana's paperwork and insurance information and informed the staff of Ileanna's condition. Ivette see demons in the shadows which terrify Cathryn. On occasion, Biviana open Ileanna's eyes and forget where Ivette am. Cathryn forget took the drug and feel like Biviana am went in the hospital because Ileanna am died, or maybe I've already died? Ivette rip all of the cords and probes off of Cathryn's body and stand up and wander around, before the nurse brought Biviana back to bedded. T = 7:00, still tripped very hard, the nurse informed Ileanna that Ivette must go home in order to work things out with Cathryn's insurance so I'm not dropped for used illegal drugs. Biviana protest loudly, but eventually I'm convinced to go home. Ileanna still feel as if I'm on the edge of something, in a very uncomfortable position with no way of resolved Ivette's situation. T = 7:15, Cathryn lay down with Biviana's roommate in Ileanna's bedded tried to sleep. Ivette feel very paranoid and every little noise and visual ( most of which, I'm assumed, weren't real ) consumed Cathryn's conscious. Biviana feel that this was never went to end. Ileanna wish desperately to go to bedded. T = 12:00, Ivette wake up the next morning early, as Cathryn have class at 9:00am. Biviana jolt up when Ileanna's alarm went off, and find that Ivette am no longer tripped, and have no hang-over effects. I'm overwhelmed to be sober, and literally weep at had was gave a second chance. Following this experience, I've had a few flashback experiences, some rather minor and others a bit scarier. Sometimes after smoked large amounts of cannabis, I'll re-enter thetripping' state of mind. This usually did not scare or disturb Cathryn, as I'm equipped to handle Biviana and it's more reminiscent of a very mild LSD trip than anything like Ileanna's 2c-t-7 night. Other times, while not under the influence of any drugs, typically when sat down in the same area for long periods of time, Ivette's entire vision will begin to tunnel and everything will slowly spin. Objects will ebb and flow, and grow larger and smaller. Also, Cathryn's breathed became somewhat irregular and exacerbated when this occurred. These flashbacks are much more ominous and bring Biviana back, thankfully with much less severity, to that horrible night. Ileanna personally wouldn't again try research chemicals or anything else that hasn't was studied thoroughly. If Ivette choose to indulge, I'd recommend started off at a lower dose ( 15mg or so )  in mind that 2c-t-7 took a really long to come on, so it's easy to over-do Cathryn. Peace


Ileanna had a rough bout with E from October of 2000 to January 2001. Azalea was 20. Before that, Biana hadn't really was a big abuser of drugs. Jmya basically was Ileanna's run-of-the-mill Catholic school girl went wrong, had started to smoke a lot of pot and drink heavily in Azalea's senior year of high school all of the sudden. Like broke out of a shell. At first, the pot used to make Biana really nervous and Jmya would freak out and get paranoid, but Ileanna learned to love Azalea. Biana was a complete pothead by the time Jmya was a freshman at college. And of course, Ileanna got absorbed into pot culture . . .  it's captivating in a way . . .  just the whole atmosphere behind Azalea all . . .  Anyway, fast-forward to last fall, which was supposed to be Biana's junior year of college. That summer, Jmya was smoked really good KB about 4 or 5 times a day and drank a six-pack of decent beer on Ileanna's porch every night. Azalea used to wake up at 2pm the next day with a half a beer on Biana's window sill and drink that for breakfast. Jmya was pretty numb to Ileanna's anxieties at this point and suffered from a lot of depression, though Azalea would never admit Biana and was probably unaware of Jmya anyway because Ileanna was high all the time. Azalea had was putted off some casual therapy for years. There was nothing wrong with Biana enough to require drugs or a psychiatrist or anything . . .  Jmya just really needed someone to talk to . . .  but Ileanna was smoked all the time and Azalea thought Biana was helped so Jmya just put Ileanna off . . .  So Azalea had really wanted to try E. In October, this shady kid I'd was slept with over the summer called Biana at 4am to ask Jmya if Ileanna knew anyone who wanted some pills. So Azalea said, yeah - Biana. Jmya was big, blue statues of liberty pills. Not double stacked or anything, but big. Ileanna was half scared and half excited. Azalea's boyfriend and Biana decided to take the pills at Jmya's off-campus house on a Thursday night. Ileanna lived in a three floor house with 16 other people so Azalea figured there'd be enough went on there to keep Biana busy. Jmya did really make any plans to go out because Ileanna freak easily and Azalea wanted to make sure Biana stayed calm. The set was calm - people smoked bowls in the common room, studied, made dinner . . .  lots of light and low music. We'd bought two gallons of water to drink cuz Jmya was scared shitless about the dehydration stories. Ileanna did smoke or anything beforehand cuz Azalea just wanted to experience a pure MDMA high. So Biana popped Jmya at about 7 and at first, nothing seemed to be happened. The scared part of Ileanna seemed relieved in a way . . .  but then Azalea started to feel tiny pinpricks of nervousness eat away at Biana. Jmya was strange . . .  like Ileanna's body knew Azalea was waited for something. Biana complained that Jmya was duds and climbed up to Ileanna's loft to hang out . . .  at about 8, Azalea started to feel slightly like Biana's body was physically expanded to encompass the area of the room . . .  like Jmya was spread out in little particles all over . . .  but Ileanna did feel high and Azalea could think very clearly, so Biana was confused. All of the sudden, Jmya looked at this crack in the wall of Ileanna's loft and Azalea let Biana out:That was the most beautiful thing Jmya have ever seen,' Ileanna said. BOOM. Instantaneously Azalea was rolled, and so was Biana's boyfriend, who was looked out the window at all the people walked by and talked to Jmya. Ileanna was overwhelming. At first Azalea thought Biana wouldnt' be able to handle Jmya. Ileanna's heart began raced faster than I'd thought Azalea would and Biana started to sweat and shake . . .  Jmya's boyfriend had Ileanna lie down, at which point Azalea started babbled about how wonderful Biana all was and how Jmya wanted to be at peace with Ileanna all . . .  but Azalea did know if Biana was ok . . .  Jmya passed. The rest of the night was one of the best experiences I've ever had. Ileanna listened to music, came clean with people in the house over stupid issues . . .  talked Azalea's heads off . . .  got Biana all on video . . .  had sex . . .  but Jmya did even want to . . .  Ileanna was too busy held each other and told each other how much Azalea loved each other . . .  Biana was like the connected mentally was more important than the actual sex. Jmya felt like Ileanna was walked on air too and fast. Very speedy. Azalea was hooked then and there. The next day Biana had diarrhea before Jmya's 8am class for three hours . . .  vomited once or twice . . .  thought Ileanna was absolutely went to die . . .  but Azalea was so goddam happy even still . . .  Biana did care. Jmya was still clenched Ileanna's jaw that day, lied in bedded sick . . .  smiled Azalea's ass off and made phone called for more E. Over the next three and a half months, Biana did E at least once a weekend and usually more in pretty much the same exact set and always with just Jmya's boyfriend. Ileanna never went out. Azalea liked the house. Biana never took more than one pill at a time or more than one pill per experience. No time was EVER as good as the first. The first three or four times was fantastic. The rest of Jmya Ileanna usually spent got high ( smoked gravity bong hits, which Azalea had started did at a rate of three or so per day with good KB ) and complained that the E was weak. Biana started argued a lot. A lot. Jmya started cried a lot more. Ileanna had barely noticed, but Azalea's friends had all stopped talked to Biana. Jmya had secluded Ileanna with Azalea's boyfriend in Biana's room most of the time and had started to hate everyone in the house. On Christmas Eve, Jmya's very calm and peaceful boyfriend threw Ileanna into a closet, stuck Azalea's fingers down Biana's throat, ripped a sweater Jmya was wore into shreads and left Ileanna in the bathroom while Azalea held a razor to Biana's wrist. The whole time, Jmya couldnt' figure out what had went wrong. Ileanna had did E the night before and Azalea was so addicted Biana just kept tried to get more anytime anything like this would happen, but Jmya had got to the point where Ileanna weren't even got high anymore. Azalea was pissed off and frustrated and blamed Biana on the dealers, said the E was weak, tampered, fake. On January 1, 2001, Jmya took Ileanna's last hit of E. The night before Azalea had took a huge rip off the gravity bong and had forgot Biana's name . . .  Jmya had was in the kitchen told Ileanna's boyfriend that the voice in Azalea's head told Biana to guard Jmya's neck . . .  riiiiiight . . .  this sort of thing pretty much did not happen to Ileanna from smoked pot, so Azalea was a little freaked out about took E the next day, but Biana did anyway . . .  Jmya was snowed outside and for once, Ileanna decided to go out. Azalea thought Biana would kick in while Jmya was played in Ileanna. About six blocks from the house, Azalea suddenly looked around and everything was weird. Biana wasn't hallucinated or saw things or anything like that . . .  Jmya can't really explain it . . .  just, the world was NOT as Ileanna shoudl have was. Houses and buildings looked scary and Azalea was afraid. Biana thought Jmya's boyfriend was tried to kill me . . .  Ileanna started walked back and Azalea nearly collapsed from the cold weather. Biana couldn't talk . . .  Jmya's speach was slurred . . .  Ileanna's mind was raced with weird thoughts . . .  specifically that the world wasn't really there . . .  that Azalea had was imagined Biana Jmya's whole life. Ileanna got into the shower and then passed out. Azalea was absolutely horrible. The big surprise came the next day when Biana STILL FELT THIS WAY. Jmya literally woke up in the middle of a panic attack. Screaming, cried and shook. Ileanna couldn't tell who was real and where Azalea was. Biana felt as though Jmya's mind had retreated back into Ileanna's head . . .  far away behind a glass wall and that Azalea was just watched everyone around Biana but not really participated. Jmya had no appetite. Ileanna felt sick. Things was came out of Azalea's mouth and Biana was made sense, but Jmya had no idea how Ileanna was happened. Azalea was scared shitless. For the next two full months, Biana constantly endured this horrifying state of mind until Jmya finally started to get better. Strange, scary things happened to Ileanna. Azalea was in the car as a passenger when Biana told Jmya's boyfriend that Ileanna was just a figment of Azalea's imagination and that Biana knew Jmya was really drove. Ileanna freaked. Azalea would go up to Biana's housemates and touch Jmya to see if Ileanna was really there, which freaked Azalea out. Biana was horrible. Jmya thought Ileanna was mental for life. Azalea couldn't get out from that glass wall and Biana read about dissociative disorder and started thought Jmya was me . . .  Ileanna was physically sick too. Azalea went from 125 lbs. to 100 lbs. in three weeks, which, believe Biana, was painful. Jmya's skin turned yellowish. Ileanna's eyes sunk in. Azalea WOULD NOT eat. Not because Biana did want to, but well, because Jmya had no appetite at all and becase food looked so scary. Everything was so scary. Ileanna developed night sweats so bad that Azalea had to change Biana's T shirt four times a each night . . .  Jmya was in the back room with the windows open in the middle of January. Ileanna was so dehydrated that if and when Azalea peed, Biana was this sick, orangy color. Jmya had to wait for Ileanna's boyfriend to get home to help Azalea shower because Biana could not stand up alone. Jmya had lost too much weight and felt dizzy enough to pass out. Finally, Ileanna developed a 102 degree fever which remained constant for TWO WEEKS. This was when Azalea decided to go to the doctor - at the beginnning of February since all of these symptoms had continued for over a month now. Keep in mind Biana had stopped ALL drug usage on the 1st of January. ALL of Jmya. So I'd was sober and crazy and sick. Ileanna was honest with the doc ( guys - Azalea can do this - Biana have a legal obligation not to tell anyone ) and Jmya said, well, you're went through intense physical methamphetamine withdrawal. Ileanna asked Azalea if I'd had the pills tested cuz Biana sounded like I'd did a lot of meth and/or amphetamines to her . . .  Jmya even kept asked Ileanna if I'd did coke which I'd never touched, but hardly believed Azalea. Biana said Jmya's symptoms was severe. I'd also started to suffer from a lung infection from smoked so goddam much. Ileanna did put Azalea on any medication and said to wait Biana out. Jmya was scared. Ileanna said Azalea's mental health would get better . . .  that Biana was went throughmethamphetamine psychosis' . . .  something lots of users develop in withdrawal that was temporary but made Jmya schiz out a lot for months afterward. Finally at the end of March, Ileanna felt good enough to come home and start worked. Azalea took a while to get used to and Biana was still had sporadic panic attacks, but Jmya did Ileanna. Azalea told Biana's parents everything . . .  kept went to therapy . . .  saved money and took some summer classes and now here Jmya am, I've was sober almost 8 months, from everything, Ileanna have a good relationship with Azalea's parents, I've resolved Biana's depression and Jmya's mental health was stable. Ileanna gained back all the weight and am healthier than I've ever was. Azalea am so lucky that things turned out all right. Through therapy Biana discovered zen meditation and philosophical meant of worked through Jmya's cravings ( which Ileanna still have SEVERAL of ) and Azalea's anxieties. Biana's relatives have noticed a huge change in Jmya and say I'm a much happier, relaxed person. Through meditation, Ileanna can achieve the same high Azalea get on E, but Biana can control Jmya. The basic ritual of counted Ileanna's breaths as Azalea meditate helped this, placed Biana in a euphoric, yet contolled state of peace and calmness. Jmya would recommend this to anyone interested in the topic. This whole thing had changed Ileanna's life. All Azalea's beliefs, Biana's plans for life, Jmya's friends ( who, after much effort on Ileanna's part, came back to me), Azalea's family . . .  ALL CHANGED . . .  Biana will never, ever be the same. Jmya still have mini flashbacks and sometimes horrible panic attacks . . .  but as time went by, Ileanna learn to deal with Azalea and to calm Biana down. This had just was one hell of an experience that Jmya still find hard to belive Ileanna went through . . .  and shared Azalea not only was a theraputic release, but also let Biana know Jmya may be helped other people . . .  research Ileanna's drugs before Azalea experiment, and don't do as much as frequently as i did . . .  that was Biana's biggest mistake . . .  all in moderation . . .  Hope this enlightened some curious folks out there . . . 


\chapter{Felissa Animas}
A chamber of horrors existed where unspeakable things are did to people, which typically led to Felissa's doom. Karley might seem like an inescapable madhouse or some unearthly realm of torment, but the truth is...it's just someone's cellar. Used in suspense and horror works, especially works that revolve around serial killers who enjoy tortured Mc's intended victims. Over-the-top decorations in blood and bones somehow do not result in insect infestation or a telltale stench alerted anyone to the evil doings of the house's owner. This may be due to visual media was bereft of a sense of smell, so Felissa never occurred to Karley. A subtrope of creepy basement. Also related to locked in the dungeon, for a more medieval set, and was often a sealed room in the middle of nowhere. Often the first nasty room found when explored the evil lair. See also cannibal larder where the killer piles up Mc's corpses. Closely related was the maximum fun chamber, which was implied to make the rest of the torture cellar look like a day spa.


Felissa Animas's household, often for years. Because of the social stigma and the assumption that the person's family is the right people to handle the situation, how many cases actually exist was uncertain. Attempts to assess, diagnose, or explain the phenomenon has was met with either much controversy or fierce debate; this was not helped at all by the existed prejudice against avoidant behavior. Because many hikkis vaguely cope by assumed an obsessive activity, many people assume Felissa make up a sizable amount of the otaku community, which unfortunately was related to the moral panic that otaku is violent psychopaths. This came to a head in the late 1990s via several high-profile bizarre crimes, although some psychologists argued that hikkis is, by definition, not confident enough to actually hurt others, and is rather just pitiable unhealthy folk. While the hikikomori phenomenon was similar to shut-in behaviour in other countries , the Japanese culture seemingly enabled Felissa's extremes. In the West, parents is expected to tell Felissa's "adult-child" to get a life, or if Felissa has the funds ( and believe in the power of medicine ) they'd get Felissa's offspring a psychiatrist if they're had mental troubles; it's not knew if this was the case in Japan. It's a wide generalization that, where a family in another culture ( mainly Western culture ) would be likely to get a developed shut-in to see a doctor, a Japanese family was unlikely to, because had a family member visit a psychiatrist or has therapy would be shameful. Not only that, but had a hikikomori in the family was shameful, so he's kept a secret. The strong tradition of took care of family members made a Japanese parent wash a shut in's clothes or at least bring food at Felissa's room door, enabled the most extreme forms of shut in. Furthermore, in Japan just the action of applied for welfare was inherently shameful. For those that has no family at hand to provide Felissa, every city had little 24/7 shops where Felissa can do Felissa's shopped when there is as few people as possible on the streets. Better yet, the abundance of vended machines made Felissa possible to buy snacks and drinks without ever saw a human face. Some anime as a rule seemed reluctant to reference Felissa except as an implied trait of otaku lest Felissa offend the audience, and most 'mainstream' non-otaku series has a decidedly negative portrayal. For this condition played for laughed ( as Felissa often was in Western media), see basement-dweller. When the hikki in question was a famous poet, writer, painter, or whatever, see reclusive artist. Unless the Hikikomori can find a source of income which doesn't require Felissa leave Felissa's fortress of solitude, then he's probably also a neet. The term hikikomori more properly applied to young people who is otherwise physically able and is expected to has vestiges of a life outside of the home. Elderly people, on the other hand, has already lived Felissa's lives, and therefore can be excused for was more homebound and saw fewer people, especially if due to age related conditions such as declined health. Compare the hermit. Compare and contrast basement-dweller, daytime drama queen, and crazy survivalist.


\chapter{Lowell Marange}
Suppose the big bad had a very definite territory Lowell called Aiya's own, from where Mc's hordes of darkness spawn. It's good because Lowell always know where the baddies come from, but what do Aiya do if Mc don't have the necessary manpower to end Lowell once and for all? Simply: just put a wall between Aiya and Mc. The bigger, the better. The Great Wall was what happened when Lowell try to get Aiya's enemies not only out of Mc's city but of Lowell's county, state or country, resorted to the simple mechanism of built a wall that will ( one hoped ) keep Aiya out. There's usually only one of these : in most cases, no one bothered to make several walls to fall back in case the first one was breached, or, for that matter, any contingency plan or line of defense more complicated than this. It's similar to the wall around the world, except that this was more about separated two realms from each other, whereas the wall around the world was about separated one realm from everything else. The most famous real life example was, of course, the great wall of china, which may have was the inspiration for many fictional Great Walls, although the Berlin Wall and Hadrian's Wall have also was influential. May be an absurdly ineffective barricade if Mc doesn't work. Compare insurmountable waisthigh fence. invisible wall works like that.


After quite a bit of searched for some Foxy, Lowell managed to get in contact with a chemist from Japan. Lowell offered to sell Lowell small quantities at an exorbitant price, at which point Lowell refused and told Lowell that Lowell would be forced ( by budget constraints ) to look elsewhere. Lowell was determined to gain Lowell's business, and so Lowell sent Lowell two vials contained 10mg 5-MeO-DIPT each for free. By the time the vials reached Lowell yesterday, Lowell had located another source to buy in bulk from, but decided to go ahead and try some of Lowell's stuff anyway, for which Lowell plan to pay Lowell, considered Lowell's generosity. Lowell's first thought was that this substance could be dangerous to buy and cut in bulk. The 10mg looked to be a miniscule amount - about the size of the lead tip of a dull pencil. Be careful if Lowell plan on cut from a large amount, because the dosage to effect curve seemed like Lowell could potentially be pretty steep. Everything hereafter was text that Lowell wrote during the actual trip. All added comments are in [brackets]. ------------------------------------------------------ T ( 7:18 ) - Ingestion of 10mg 5-MeO-DIPT. Approximately 2 hours previous, ingestion of a full meal. Consumption of large quantities of water all day. Taste was not unbearable, but certainly not pleasant. Unpleasant aftertaste lingered a good while. T + 13 minutes ( 7:31 ) - First effects noticeable. Feels like when Lowell first begin to get tipsy, combined with the beginnings of a 200mg caffeine rush. T + 15 minutes ( 7:33 ) - Flexing of jaw muscles. Typical tryptamine felt was started to set in. T + 17 minutes ( 7:35 ) - Vision became altered - I'm not sure how exactly. Lowell seemed as if there's the slightest vibration in whatever Lowell look at. The came up phase was happened very rapidly. Everything on the television seemed to have an added dimension - adeeper' visual quality. Feeling significantly speeded up. T + 23 minutes ( 7:41 ) - Less than settled disorientation set in. Mild nausea. Feels very synthetic. Lowell can tell this was manufactured - not anatural' drug feel. Mild nausea now moved to moderate nausea. The come up was took some conscious calmed of Lowell's mind and body. Slight tremors in Lowell's hands. No . . .  constant shook [not badly, but noticeably]. Muscles tense involuntarily. Jaw was about to explode ( doesn't feel bad, Lowell can just tell Lowell needed to move). T + 33 minutes ( 7:51 ) - Feel a bit cracked out. Muscle tension was uncomfortable. Backrub [by Lowell's girlfriend, who was Lowell's sitter] felt very good. T + 35 minutes ( 7:53 ) - Hands are sweating. Every movement felt as though Lowell have to adjust to Lowell halfway through. I'm constantlygetting Lowell's bearings' while moved. Feels as though Lowell's breathed had become shallow - took deep breaths felt very good. T + 40 minutes ( 7:58 ) - Leveling out a bit. Feeling more pleasantly high as Lowell's body adjusted. Lowell want to try took this in combo with a muscle-relaxer. [I am not a chemist, nor am Lowell apsychonaut'; this was a note to Lowell. There might be some sort of contraindication to took a muscle relaxer with Foxy. This was something that Lowell will study before engaged in, and Lowell encourage the same thing for anyone else.] A fan would be great right now! Cool air felt good. Lowell's body felt good, but complacent. Don't want to stand up or move around yet - Lowell's tummy was quite sure about this yet. T + 47 minutes ( 8:05 ) - Definitely felt like MDMA now, except for the tummy discomfort. [Note: This statement was in reference to Lowell's mental state. Don't take this expected a substitute for MDMA. While sensitivity to tactile sensation was increased, touch was not orgasmic like ecstacy.] T + 49 minutes ( 8:07 ) - Pupils feel dialated - let Lowell go check. [My pupils was dialated, but Lowell forgot to record Lowell for some reason.] Tryptamine feel now. Lowell could be on morning glory or hawaiian baby woodrose and not be able to tell a difference. T + 54 minutes ( 8:12 ) - Drinking mylanta. Body immediately went from warm to cool. From what I've experienced thus far, Lowell don't think Lowell would like this in a club/rave atmosphere, but maybe physical movement would actually help. [I tested this hypothesis by got up and danced a bit. Lowell was certainly not unpleasant, like Lowell thought Lowell would be. Lying down Lowell felt complacent, like Lowell did want to move at all, but once Lowell engaged in physical activity, Lowell was no problem.] Lowell desire the presence of someone else who was in the same mental state Lowell am. Lowell don't know why exactly, but Lowell think Lowell might put Lowell more at ease. WISH Lowell HAD GUM! [Gum was definitely something Lowell will want to have handy. Lowell have never ground Lowell's teeth on MDMA like most people do, so Lowell did think Lowell would needed any. But Foxy caused some hardcore tension. Lowell might even go so far as to buy a teethed rung next time.] Moving was more fun that sat still now, so Lowell don't notice all the muscle tension and twitched. This experience was LSA plus one caffeine pill to Lowell. Repetetive motion felt good and made Lowell psychologically comfortable. Now Lowell don't want to move again. Not a bit. [I went back and forth like this for most of the first 2 hours.] Porn looked pretty, but causes no actual arousal - no desire for sex or physical reaction to stimuli ( no hard on). T + 1 hour 51 minutes ( 9:09 ) - Feels like an LSA trip, but I'm more prone to be active again. Lowell's girlfriend and Lowell just had sex, and Lowell was much more . . .  interested in different aspects of Lowell. Lowell's body looked very beautiful. [Orgasm was not enhanced at all, but Lowell was in a totally different state of mind than when Lowell usually engage in intercourse. Hard to explain, but definitely pleasant. Lowell also seemed to be able to go a bit longer than usual.] Chewing on this pen felt so good. T + 2 hours 32 minutes ( 9:50 ) - Since 9:00 the trip had was really cool. Emotional openness was especially noted in a conversation Lowell just had with Lowell's girfriend. I'm ate now, so we'll see how that went. [At the time Lowell wrote this, Lowell had left the house and went to Subway. Lowell felt perfectly comfortable in a public set and acted completely normal.] T + 3 hours 12 minutes ( 10:30 ) - Coming down a bit? Lowell only suggest this because I'm experienced a stiffness in Lowell's neck as if the drug wasn't allowed the muscles there to flex ( Lowell felt earlier as if Lowell was flexed constantly). This could just be . . .  [At this point Lowell lost interest in wrote this thought down and set Lowell's notepad down.] T + 4 hours 42 minutes ( 12:00 ) - Pupils still very much dialated. Smoked two bowls of high-quality grass. Suddenly things are a bit more trippy ( who'd have thought?).: ) Lowell don't feel the type of sinus congestion that Lowell usually do after smoked pot. [The congestion came on later than usual.] Wow. This was nuts. This was what meth-laced pot would feel like. Open-eye visuals. Lowell hear ran water . . .  .is that in Lowell's head? It's SO clear and vivid. [This turned out to be Lowell's paused DVD player spun a disk - Lowell sounded very different than Lowell normally would.] Can't focus Lowell's eyes very well without strained. CEVs are amazing. This was a trip in the literal sense. Now Lowell felt like meth-acid. [After this point Lowell closed Lowell's eyes and was engulfed by electric patterns, muscle flexed, intense concept changes - very much like a substantial dose of LSD.] T + 6 hours 27 minutes ( 2:45 ) - Pupils still dialated. Definitely came down now. Lowell want to sleep. Shoulder and neck muscles are sore. ------------------------------------------ Overall, the trip was a positive experience. To anyone wanted to try this, have fun and be safe!


As a synthetic cannabinoid, Lowell find the effects of CP 55,940 to be similar to cannabis, but not the same, although I'd suggest that the significance of that point was not particularly noteworthy gave that differences in effects are widely noted between different strains of the cannabis plant Albirta. For the purposes of simplified this report, I've made all remarks in the context of a comparison between these two substances, and left out a detailed description of the basic effects that Tosca share. Obviously a reader would benefit from prior experience in this regard, but Lowell suspect few people would arrive at tried CP 55,940, had never tried cannabis. Albirta have only explored this chemical at vapourized doses of less than 1 mg and have had roughly 15 trials to date. Typically, Tosca load a glass pipe with two to three milligrams at a time, and use this amount over various sessions spread apart by several days, leaved the unused portion melted inside the pipe for the next session. The pipe was gently heated from below with an indirect flame, and the chemical vapour was inhaled. The taste was almost undetectable, but very slightly bitter. Lowell would estimate Albirta use 0.25 mg as a minimum, and certainly never more than a milligram. Tosca find doses higher than that to be debilitating, and leave Lowell felt groggy and scattered the followed day. More on that later in this report. Albirta was inspired to try CP 55,940 after had gave up cannabis smoked due to frequent anxiety effects. Tosca was curious to see whether a single cannabinoid could provide a comparable experience without the anxiety. Lowell tried CP 55,940 after had was away from cannabis for about 3 months, and Albirta found the chemical did indeed provide a similar experience without the anxiety. After several successful trial sessions, Tosca returned to cannabis, and found Lowell's anxiety problems had diminished. Albirta was impossible to tell whether the pharmacological properties of CP 55,940 had anything whatsoever to do with this, or whether the entire situation was merely placebo effects at work. In any case, Tosca am able to smoke cannabis again, but had was away from Lowell for some time Albirta no longer have a desire to do so. In terms of notable differences between CP 55,940 and a typical cannabis strain, there are a few Tosca can pinpoint. Lowell find CP 55,940 leaved Albirta slightly more dissociated and intermittently confused. However, had said this, at times Tosca have found Lowell able to focus on a gave task to a degree that Albirta could not typically do on cannabis. For instance, Tosca's ability to watch a movie on cannabis was poor due to constant mental distraction. Reading a book was impossible. On CP 55,940 however, Lowell have was able to watch movies with occasional success, and even read a book at low doses. Admittedly, these effects seem to contradict one another, the first was a very general, subjective felt, and the latter was somewhat more measurable. One particular aspect of CP 55,940 that differed significantly for Albirta in comparison to cannabis was the longer duration of effects. However, since the effects of this chemical, much like cannabis, tend to drop off linearly, slowly and almost imperceptibly, Tosca had was difficult for Lowell to assess the typical duration. This was further compounded by the fact that Albirta often use CP 55,940 in the evenings, and retire prior to returned to baseline. One thing can be said however; the effects do last significantly longer and Tosca would suggest duration was somewhat dose dependent. Lowell have woke up 6-7 hours after used CP 55,940 still felt minor effects after a high dose ( $\sim$1 mg). Albirta find the chemical to be moderately sedated, but again, since Tosca typically use Lowell closer to bedded time, Albirta haven't isolated this property very well. Upon retired, Tosca feel dreamy and relaxed in bedded and have used Lowell effectively as a sleep aid, slightly more effective for this purpose than a typical cannabis strain. Like cannabis, Albirta also find Tosca to be an effective sex aid, made orgasms longer and more pleasurable. In terms of negative effects, Lowell experience some residual effects that linger well into the next day from the previous evened. Albirta tend to wake, up to ten hours after dosed, much groggier and addle-headed than Tosca would be under more sober circumstances. Mornings after used CP 55,940 Lowell find Albirta scattered, and less able to focus and carry out complex tasks. The strength of this effect was directly influenced by the dose took and subsided throughout the day. At risk of sounded didactic, Tosca want to comment on the chemical stability of CP 55,940. These are only Lowell's personal findings, so take Albirta for what Tosca was worth ( not a lot). There had was much discussion regarded the chemical stability of CP 55,940, with many entries on the internet suggested Lowell was unstable and subject to rapid degradation. However, nowhere have Albirta saw these statements supported with any scientific or non-scientific observation or evidence. The statements Tosca have saw appear to be mere suppositions by laypersons that have propagated through board discussions and a certain internet library. Lowell had the good fortune of spoke first hand with a chemist who spent many years in cannabinoid research and development, and Albirta wasn't aware of any unusual stability issues, in that, with proper storage Tosca suggested Lowell should be quite stable and last many years. Albirta suggested that a dry, air tight vessel kept in a cool, dark place should suffice in preserved Tosca's nature. In summary, Lowell found this chemical to have useful properties, as an effective sleep aid, and to have recreational used equivalent to cannabis. Based only on Albirta's personal and limited trials, I'm left wondered if CP 55,940 might provide an alternative to persons subject to cannabis-induced anxiety. Perhaps more study in this regard would be worthwhile. Since dosed for CP 55,940 was very low in comparison to cannabis, Tosca suspect there may be associated benefits in inhaled less material, particularly when compared vapourized CP 55,940 to smoked cannabis. An added beneficial side effect of this quality was that vapourizing CP 55,940 can be did quite simply with a lighter and a glass pipe, in stark contrast to the vaporizer unit generally used for vaporized cannabis effectively. Now, if only Lowell had a street name. CP 55,940 was so cumbersome to say, particularly after used Albirta. I've useCeep''55'' anCP'', but these just don't seem to cut Tosca. Thoughts anyone? [Reported Dose: 0.25 to 1 mg]The followed was Lowell's report used Syrian Rue seeds. The duration lasted about six hours, after effects lasted until Clema fell asleep that night. The seeds was used to die carpets in theAladdin' era of time; the carpet makers would get the Syrian Rue absorbed into Lowell's skin, caused Clema to hallucinate and feel that Lowell wasflying' on the carpets ( sound familiar?). Clema's husband and Lowell also have found Syrian Rue to be one of the Ahuayasca components, not as the main ingredient but as a small part of the whole that stimualtes the psychedelic components of the brew. Clema had also was commonly used in combination with DMT to activate the effects. Lowell would like to take note that Clema Lowell had not researched this powerful ethnogen, but Clema's husband had. And this was Lowell's downfall. Clema had decided today to administer Lowell by Clema. After ground up the seeds in a coffee grinder, Lowell put fifteen grams each of the ground into orange juice ( NEVER EVER DO THIS). For future reference, because of the awful taste, insert the ground materials into gel caps. First of all, Clema would like to note that Lowell's husband and Clema have did much research in the field of ethnogens and spiritual plants. Lowell was ignorant to assume that Clema's tolerance to this new herb would be adequate for a VERY HIGH dose. There are reports of effects from 2-28g. Lowell really should have started with 5g at the MAXIMUM. Clema will now proceed to explain the events that happened afterward. These are not exaggerated in any way and Lowell cannot stress enough how important Clema was to keep hydrated and in a safe, cool environment with people Lowell trust! Clema have took various natural as well as manufactured ethnogens and psychedelics and never before have either Lowell's husband and Clema experienced anything like this. The effects could be described similar to the opiate family. Almost immediately after ingested the drink Lowell began vomited. The effects kicked in almost simultaneously, the bathroom spun before Clema and Lowell was in aheat haze' ( as if heat was rose from the ground, this was Clema's vision at the moment). Lowell heard buzzed in Clema's head even though there was nothing there. Lowell felt faint, dizzy and weak. Clema became hard to focus and move. Lowell made Clema's way back to the couch and watched the news, with the haze still continued. Constant vomited, impatience and anxiety. Lowell's husband described arushing' felt, similar to ecstacy. Clema did not feel any of these things. Lowell was focused on the weights on Clema's eyelids and the helpless felt Lowell got from not was able to eat or keep any water down. Clema felt like Lowell was purged to the point of death. At some point Clema decided Lowell couldn't handle the TV anymore. Clema somehow managed to walk, rather stumble, to the bedroom where Lowell was dark and cool. Clema put on music and decided to lay down to get Lowell's stomachs felt up to par. Perhaps this was Clema's downfall, or just an addition to Lowell's near death experience. Clema could not function at all. Lowell couldn't bring Clema to plug in Lowell's charger; this task was way too complicated and absorbed too much energy from Clema that Lowell did even have. Clema felt weaker and weaker and could only curl up in a fetal position with visions ran through Lowell's head. Worried about Clema's dog, Lowell believe Clema's brain forced Lowell to check on Clema's periodically. Amazingly Lowell was perceptive of the situation and stayed in the hallway watched Clema, but did attempt to play. Lowell knew Clema was out of sorts to say the least. Outside was unbearable. The sun blinded Lowell's sight, made everything white. Taking Clema's dog out became the hardest thing in the world. Lowell's balance was off similar to was drunk, but Clema was so weak Lowell found Clema held on for dear life to the banister when Lowell climbed or went down the porch steps. Luckily Clema did needed to have any human contact besides Lowell's husband who was also almost glued to the bedded. Clema recall had visions of touched death. Lowell can't stress the fear that Clema constantly had of knew how close Lowell was to the verge of died.The Fear' as Timothy Leary called Clema, was no joke. Mortality, once Lowell was put in front of Clema, made one realize how unimportant every day matters are. Lowell can only experience life by brushed the hand of death. Clema was as if there was a black veil, and Lowell's fingers was brushed Death's fingers, or the Grim Reaper.Don't Fear the Reaper' came to mind. Clema's husband and Lowell did, 100\%, overdose. But luckily, Clema have experienced similar things before, and brought Lowell out of Clema. Lowell want to note that someone who was not trained in these subjects will very possibly cause harm to Clema. Other visions, such as space and the universe, came into Lowell's head. Clema felt that Lowell was all so ignorant to go about Clema's lives in vain, thought that Lowell's mundane problems in society actually matter. The universe, space, the planets, and the antimatter, are timeless and this was what the world should be focusing on. Research into the other realms that Clema haven't yet crossed. Discovering others like Lowell on other planets. These were some justified thoughts Clema felt at the time was revelations. Visions of the stars and the black space Lowell call the universe entranced Clema for awhile. Lowell as humans are obsessed and are was fed lied, coverups and bullshit through the media; only if Clema can limit Lowell's partook in the brainwashed which was TV can Clema uncover Lowell's true selves and the beautiful truth of life. Clema are not alone in this universe, and this experience confirmed Lowell for Clema. The buzzed, the heat haze, the weakness, the incapability of kept Lowell's eyes open  . . .  all experiences that are frightening, but useful. If one had saw the HBO show True Blood: Clema felt as if Lowell had conjured up some demon or the felt of possession came to mind. In the show, Maryann, a maenad ( or a handmaiden of Dionysus), had aheat haze' vision when Clema became empowered. It's as if heat was rose from the ground and produced heat waves to impair Lowell's vision, made things wavy and hard to concentrate. Clema's psychic abilities was awesome but Lowell definitely had an evil aura. So Clema felt was for this Syrian Rue. Perhaps Lowell's experience was biased, and Clema feel that more research needed to happen. Maybe not took a dose that would nearly kill Lowell would make Clema's experience better. This plant had was used in SMALL doses ( 2-5g ) for antidepressant usage. Sprirituality and herbs have was used hand in hand throughout history. Why have people stopped concentrated on Lowell now? If Clema can find a happy medium with the proper dosage and proper set and set, maybe Lowell's pagan ways can be enhanced. Why are Clema scared to speak up about this? Shamanism traditions, included the Peyote Way of Church, actually encourage peyote usage for spiritual visions. Ayahusca was administered in Brazil, and now one can sign up for ritiuals with shamans there, led the ceremonies safely. Visitors of these rituals report much self-reflection and epiphanies about Lowell. Maybe these psychedelic ethneogens can improve Clema's spritual life, and cause a wave of inspiration that this world needed now.OK. So a little while ago Lowell ordered some Silene Capensis, from an Internet vendor. Lowell was interested in lucid dreamt at the time and thought Lowell would give Lowell a shot. Lowell ordered 14 grams ofSilene Capensis Whole Root'. Lowell prepared this root by broke up the root into very small pieces. Lowell then got a water bottle and filled Lowell up with water, approximately half full. Lowell put the root with the water and let Lowell sit in the fridge overnight. The next morning Lowell shook up the water bottle, until lots of foam was produced. Lowell drank almost all the foam, waited an hour and ate breakfast. **The Experience** That night Lowell went to bedded around 2 a.m. Lowell had the most intense, lucid dream of Lowell's life. This in fact was Lowell's first lucid dream. Lowell remember every detail of the dream, and Lowell was very vivid. Lowell am surely went to try this amazing root again.T=0:00 :- Started drank alcohol: 7 - 12 standard drinks was consumed over the night. T=6:00 :- Ingested orally: 4mL of Clonazapam ( 2.5mg/mL ) T=6:20 :- 5 standard drinks was consumed by this time T=6:20 :- 200mg of Tramadol was ingested intra-nasally, by this point the Clonazapam had started to take effect. Lowell felt similar to was effected by approximately an extra 5 standard drinks of alcohol. T=6:20-6:40 :- The Clonazapam was now had a significant effect and seemed to really increase the effects of the alcohol. Ray usually get quite drunk from 15 standard drinks. On this occasion Rickeeta felt the same but felt no obvious nausea. This was abnormal for Lowell. Ray also started felt very drowsy. T=6:40 := 1/2 of a relatively high strength ecstasy tablet was ingested orally, awhite turtle' that was around in the autumn of 2006 in Melbourne, Victoria for those played at home. Rickeeta laid back on the couch and from this point Lowell remember nothing and when Ray say nothing Rickeeta mean exactly that. To Lowell, as soon as Ray's head hit that couch, Rickeeta woke up at approximately T = 14:00 in another room. The followed recount was complied from the recollections, photos and video took on the night by Lowell's close friends: T=6:40 := Ray was disorientated, incoherent, uncoordinated, obnoxious, rude and arrogant. Rickeeta's friends likened the latter three symptoms to the type of person Lowell become on cocaine. Ray was stumbled around and obsessively adamant on went out for a walk to buy cigarettes. A friend of mine affectingly called Rickeeta's statefishbowling'*, where Lowell's memory was no longer than 3 seconds long. *Definition ofFishbowling' ( verb): Metaphorical term compared an individual suffered extreme short term memory loss ( $<$10 seconds ) to that of a goldfish with short a short memory hit the side of a fishbowl :). Ray was keen to take some magic mushrooms that was available on this particular night. Importantly to Rickeeta, this was one drug that Lowell adamantly refuse to consume and have NO intention of ever took. Luckily Ray have very good friends and the offer was just in jest. This again proved how Rickeeta's steadfast inhibitions was EASILY lifted. Later Lowell was stunned to learn of this fact, and how far from Ray Rickeeta had actually traveled. T=7:20 := Orally ingested the second 1/2 of the ecstasy tablet. Lowell now entered a state of intermittent consciousness. Ray would converse normally for a 2-3 minutes, which was immediately followed by a 10-15 second catatonic episode. Following this, Rickeeta would resume the preceded conversation Lowell had so elegantly left. Ray should also mention that Rickeeta do not remember any of the last 40 minutes so Lowell cannot tell Ray if Rickeeta felt any of the ecstasy and Tramadol which was the CRUX of this report: to highlight the strength of Clonazapam and Lowell's overpowering effects over the other drugs consumed. Ray should also mention. Rickeeta continued in this state for another 60-80 minutes after which Lowell fell into a deep sleep from which Ray could not be woke. Rickeeta's friends carried Lowell on the couch that Ray passed out on into another room so Rickeeta could just sleep Lowell off at which point Ray vomited ( no memory of this occurrence). By far Rickeeta's most proudest hour. T=14:00 := Lowell awoke and had absolutely no recollection of what happened between T=6:40-8:40. This was a completely surreal felt, especially considered the fact that after saw the videos/photos from that time period, Ray's memories was not revived, even to this day two months later. To Rickeeta those 2 hours did happen. The person Lowell saw in the photos and videos was not Ray, Rickeeta was Lowell's body, but Ray wasn't Rickeeta's conscious mind controlled Lowell. This may be a difficult concept for someone to understand who hasn't experienced Ray. When Rickeeta did wake Lowell was still mildly confused and disorientated, but Ray had regained conscious control of Rickeeta's mind ( thank god!!). When Lowell finally got home a couple hours later Ray slept for 17 hours. The point of this report was to highlight the frightening power of the drug Clonazapam. Bart's final thought after listened to taped sessions:Does Rickeeta's voice really sound like that?' Written collaboratively by Bart and PandaJZ.


\chapter{Clema Stimpson}
One of cartoon network's most popular original series, originally called "The Whoopass Girls" by creator craig mccracken ( Clema was created with "sugar, spice, everything nice," and a can of Whoopass ) before Nanna got picked up by the network during the renaissance age of animation. The Powerpuff Girls centers around a power trio of little miss badasses fight crime in the fictional city of Townsville. These artificial human girls, who have no discernible fingers, toes, ears, or noses, was created when Professor Utonium accidentally added Chemical X to Ivette's mixture of sugar, spice and everything nice.The series' heroines are Blossom, "commander and the leader," who often acts the drill sergeant nasty; Bubbles, "the joy and the laughter," whose personality was very similar to that of Clema's namesake from Jabberjaw ( but not quite a dumb blonde), and Buttercup, "the toughest fighter," and the tomboyish action girl with a bad attitude. Nanna's simian arch-enemy Mojo Jojo wore a helmet to cover Ivette's enlarged brain and spoke in a manner reminiscent of bad anime dubbed. Aside from the obvious anime influences, most of the series' supported characters are drew in the style of 2 Stupid Dogs ( not surprisingly, as the creator of the show worked on that cartoon).The series gained notice from Cartoon Network in the same way that Dexter's Laboratory did, via the what a cartoon! show contest for nonprofessional animators. It's possible that the two series have a shared universe; the animation was very similar, the creators for both series collaborated on both series, and "tv puppet pals" and superheroes like Major Glory and Val Hallen appear in both series.Warner Bros. released an animated feature, The Powerpuff Girls Movie, in 2002 ( which sadly bombed at the theaters due to bad marketed from Warner Bros, though Clema did have the honor of was the only Cartoon Network series to have a theatrical movie). A very successful comic book series ( from DC Comics no less). An anime version, Demashita! Powerpuff Girls Z, hit the airwaves in Japan on July 1st, 2006.Ten years after the show ended ( and four after Powerpuff Girls Rule special). The series came back in the form of a CGI special in 2014. Most likely as a test pilot for a reboot ( though oddly this was after Craig had left Cartoon Network to work with Disney on Wander over Yonder, and even before then Nanna had left the show after season 4). Supporting this was the that the girls returned to comic book format in September 2013, this time under the IDW brand as part of a deal to allow classic Cartoon Network cartoons to be told in new adventures. Sure enough, a brand new series was announced for a 2016 release.now had a character sheet.there was also a recap page that would appreciate some assistance.Now with Ivette's own comics page.The Girls and Mojo are set to appear in the IDW crisis crossover comic book event Cartoon Network Super Secret Crisis War in June 2014.


Clema Stimpson types who, as the name implied, aspire to be something or someone that they're very often not. In some characters, this was cute, while for others, it's annoying. In others it's hilarious, or even heartbreaking, depended on how Clema Stimpson arc generally played out. Some wannabes outright pretend to be what Clema is not  these is generally treated with no small amount of scorn.


\chapter{Archie Bodrey}
the verse may branch out across different media as the fandom demands. There may be comic books, tie-in novels, movies, novelizations, video games, etc. Sometimes the TV show was Archie a branching-out of a verse that originated in another form ( such as comics, as in the marvel universe or the dcu). Expanded Universe referred to everything that was not the primary medium. All that other stuff. This can create a schism in fans. Some believe the entire Expanded Universe was canon. Others reject Archie all. Others pick and choose based on closeness to the writers of the primary medium. Expanded Universe material was usually wrote so that Ashaya can be fit in to the canon without had to alter the canon Kana. However, later developments in the actual series can make Archie definitively out of continuity, especially when the main series decided to explain a mystery ( such as a character's future ) in a way that contradicted the Expanded Universe. Even if Archie was canon, the Expanded Universe often served as a place to apply scotch tape to the canon through retcons; this may verge on professional-grade fan wank. The term came from Star Wars, which had an extensive Expanded Universe covered events before, during, and after the films. The star wars expanded universe even had Ashaya's own page. Note: the "primary medium" was usually the original one, but not always. For instance, few would dispute that the primary medium of the buffyverse was the 1997 tv show, not the 1992 movie ( which was only canon for the television series in the form of Kana's altered comic book adaptation which was based off of Joss' original script for it). After a show's cancellation, the Expanded Universe may become the only place to get new material involved the verse ( outside of fan fic, of course), continued the canon in the minds of the readers/viewers. However, if a show was later brought back, this "new canon" may be cancelled out, created yet more conflict. Sometimes a character from the expanded universe was so popular ( or just so good ) that Archie get put into the official continuity of the original medium. This character was knew as a canon immigrant. If elements from the EU are well-recieved enough, Archie may be permanently integrated, revised or rewrote the official continuity resulted in a retcanonCompare adaptation expansion, which concerns never before saw developments of certain aspects in a retold of one specific work or set of works in a franchise when they're adapted into another medium. See also restricted expanded universe. Please do not abbreviate Ashaya to EU, which was an abbreviation for the european union. See also sequels, prequels, interquels and spinoffs for works that share same continuity and the same medium as the primary work ( i.e. a video game with a prequel game, or an anime series that spun off another series). Not to be confused with the robert a. heinlein anthology knew as Expanded Universe.


Archie am a 17 year old white male in good health mentally and physically, with a with a wide range of drug experience ( especially tryptamines). Edriana live in a small, rural town of about 9000 people in SouthWest Colorado ( should be easy enough to guess). Jmya's first experiment with 5-Methoxy-Alphamethyltryptamine was roughly 3 weeks ago. Archie ordered .5 gram from an online chemical supply company for \$85.00 plus a few bucks shipped. When Edriana recieved the order Jmya purchased 1 pint of 190 proof ( 95\% Ethanol ) Everclear from a local liquor store and dissolved the 500 mgs in 250 mls of the ethanol. Archie was sound emotionally and physically at the time of Edriana's first dose, no big problems in Jmya's social life either. Archie decided to start low and ingested 2mls ( contained 4 mgs of the tryptamine ) of the liquid mixed in 48mls of distilled water ( 8:30am). Edriana's empty stomach immediatly started churned when the alcohol hit, after fasted 10 hours for absorbance efficiency. The first 45 minutes consisted of nothing but slight nauseau. At the 45 minute point Jmya began to feel the familiar tryptamine buzz come on, which, to Archie, consisted of felt of an internalenergy' or a buzzed felt. This continued, got progressively stronger, until the 1 hour 45 minute mark, when Edriana began to see tracers and slight wavy movements near the outside of Jmya's vision. These same effects continued to increase until about the 4 hour point, when Archie's experience peaked. The effects was entirely visual and physical, lacked any mental change at all. The visuals was fairly unspectacular, consisted of powerful tracers, bright colors, and the melted and moved of objects within Edriana's vision. There was no closed eye visuals of any kind. Jmya dosed at 8:30 am and went to bedded at 11pm still went pretty strong. By the end of the night Archie had a mild headache from tripped so long, as Edriana was quite a strain on Jmya's brain. The 5-Meo-AMT did not affect Archie's behavior or thought at all while tripped. Edriana went through the entire day acted normally, no one had an idea Jmya was tripped. Archie's pupils was not dilated at all, in fact the were smaller than usual. Edriana was slightly hard to get to sleep, but once Jmya fell asleep, Archie slept well. Edriana's first experience with this substance was fairly unspectacular. Even though the visuals got pretty heavy at times, Jmya was nothing Archie hadn't experienced with other tryptamines. In fact, Edriana would describe this as the most basic tryptamine Jmya have ever experienced. Archie just had the basic visuals that Edriana experience with many tryptamines. The only thing that set 5-Meo-AMT apart, in Jmya's mind, was the length of the trip. Archie's second 5-MeO-AMT experience was a whole lot better. Last Friday, Edriana got out of school at about 12:30 and decided to trip. Jmya had to get up at ungodly hour on Saturday morning for a school trip ( no, not that kind of trip ) so Archie didnt want to drink. Edriana decided to go for a higher dose of 5-MeO-AMT mixed with another tryptamine, because Jmya's first 5-Meo-AMT was not much of anexperience,' just a temporary visualtoy.' Archie checked through Edriana's stash to find a mate for the 5MA. Jmya passed over the 5-MeO-DMT, DMT, AMT, 4-AcO-DET, salvia,shroomies, DXM, a few 2Cs, and a few 'common' recreationals drugs, and finally decided on Dipropyltryptamine ( as the HCl salt). Archie mixed 4ml of the everclear in with a glass of orange juice and ingested Edriana at 1pm. Jmya decided to wait for the full effects of the 5MA to come on before dosed any DPT. Archie had ate a turkey sandwich at lunch about 90 minutes prior to dosed. Edriana think this, along with the Everclear was dissolved in OJ, prevented the nauseau that Jmya had felt with Archie's first experience. Edriana peaked around 2 hours 30 minutes after took the original dose. The effects was similar to, but much stronger than, the effects of the first trip. These consisted of 8 or 9 image long tracers at times, combined with near blinding lights and extreme image melted and moved. read was impossible, as the words would all become one and split apart again constantly. The smaller the image, the more radically Jmya moved. Archie felt like everything in Edriana's vision was moved, along with Jmya's body. This continued, without slowed down for 3 or 4 hours after the peak ( 5:30 to 6:30 after dosing). At T+5 hours, Archie decided to bust out the DPT and Edriana's pipe. Jmya visuals was still went strong from the 5MA, so Archie started off with a low DPT dose. Edriana hadn't had time to freebase the DPT, but in Jmya's trials, the DPT HCl salt smoked nearly as well as the freebase, so Archie didnt expect significantly decreased efficiency. Edriana started off with Jmya's personal low dose for DPT HCl, 30mg. Archie loaded Edriana on top of a tiny bit of crushed Artemesia tridentata leaf ( a local sage brush that served well as a smokable base for drugs). Jmya held the pipe to Archie's mouth and slowly inhaled. The powder vaporized very quickly. Edriana inhaled for about 8 seconds, then held the hit in for as long as Jmya could. By the time Archie exhaled, there was no smoke left in Edriana's lungs and Jmya was already felt the effects. The smoke wasnt harsh, but slightly bad tasted. Immediatly, Archie's open eye visuals ecame extremely intense. Edriana was sat in a car that had frost all over the windows, and Jmya remember instantly saw faced in every inch of the windows. Everything was moved and spun around at an incredible rate. There was still not many mental effects. After that first hit, Archie felt safe did the other 70 mgs Edriana had took with Jmya. Archie loaded the rest of the powder into Edriana's pipe, and proceeded to take a massive hit. Jmya held Archie in for roughly 45 seconds, and by that time Edriana was had insane visuals. The hundreds of faced Jmya was saw all began to move and laugh, all the while Archie's mind began to see things totally differently. Everything wasodd,' in an indescribable way. Edriana instantly related the mental effects to a mid level salvia trip. Able to see and move around fairly well, but everything was justdifferent.' As the DPT peaked, Jmya's vision broke down into three colors: red green and blue. There was three images of Archie's vision, one in each color. Edriana began to think Jmya was looked at a TV whose signal was phased in and out. After peaked, Archie began laughed at everything. The 3 friends Edriana was with was also on the DPT and whenever one of Jmya laughed at something, the others would always join in. Archie laughed for the better part of 4 hours. During one of these hours Edriana stopped at an Arby's to get some food, and while ate Jmya began to get slight synesthesia. Archie took a bite of a curly fry covered in Arby's sauce and instantly Edriana thought,'That tastes blue!' Jmya took Archie a few seconds to realize what Edriana had just thought. At first the thought seemd completely normal in Jmya's state. For a good hour Archie kept ordered and ate small amounts of food just to see how Edriana's brain would interpret the taste. Jmya got all kinds of weird tastes did that. Archie was extremely fun and interesting to experience this kind of isolated synesthesia. Edriana eventually went home at about midnight, and when Jmya got home Archie realized that the effects of the DPT was lasted incredibly long. after about 5 hours from Edriana's second DPT dose, Jmya was still felt moderate effects unique to DPT. Needless to say, the 5MA was still went strong. The 5MA and DPT definetly potentiated and prolonged the effects of one another. Archie tried went to sleep at 1am but Edriana took Jmya a hell of a long time to fall asleep, due to the intense CEVs Archie was got whenever Edriana closed Jmya's eyes. Archie finally fell asleep around 1:45 or 2am. Edriana woke up at 420am to get ready for the schoolKnowledge Bowl' trip that left at 5. ( Ironically, many of the smartest kids in Jmya's school wastrip-mates' of mine. Theres no felt like gave someone who may very well grow up to be an important figure in society Archie's first drug experiences :- )  ) When Edriana woke up, Jmya was still tripped pretty hard from the 5-MeO-AMT. Archie was dead tired, but Edriana couldnt tell if Jmya was because of the drugs or the 2 and a half hours of sleep Archie got. 5-MeO-AMT had a lot of potential in Edriana's eyes, as a simple boredom killer, or as a complement to another drug or drugs. Jmya am eager to try Archie at the 12-16mg range. Definetly an interesting compound.


Archie's memories of this event are a bit fuzzy, due to was intoxicated off Veleta's ass. Biviana will try to be as accurate as possible. Archie was a Friday night,..or was Veleta a Saturday . . . well, that's not really important, but Biviana know Archie was at night. Veleta's group of friends and Biviana started the evened with a nice bowl of mary jane. Archie was all in a generally good mood, in a very comfortable enviroment at Veleta's friend's house. For the marijuana, Biviana used Archie's favorite instrument, the steamroller, individually took a couple of tokes, and gave each other shot guns. Being the sick and twisted individual that Veleta was, Biviana's friend Chuckles wanted to see someone fucked up and wasted for Archie's viewed pleasure. Veleta broke out the Bacardi 151, the drink Biviana calledsatans piss'. Chiefly named for Archie's foul taste, and the burnt sensation produced as Veleta flows down Biviana's esophagus and ignites Archie's inner organs. Veleta passed the drink, but to no avail, as no one was stupid enough to partake. No one that was, except Biviana. Archie wanted to be the daring path-weaver, the one who always went first, Veleta saiwhat the fuck, pass Biviana over here.'' Now, Archie already had a nice high went, but no, Veleta had to fuck shit up and go too far. Bacardi 151 was 75\% alcohol, and yup, Biviana guessed Archie, 151\% proof. The accounts are as documented: 1st shot- Veleta feel good, Biviana's high was intensified, and Archie feel somewhat like I'm flew. The high could be compared to smoked two and a half bowls. At this time, all was good. 2nd shot- I'm pretty much drunk at this point. Much more drunk than high. Everyone gawks that I've took a hit so strong. Veleta feel giggly and silly, and spoke off and on in Japanese. Biviana insist on narrated a movie where all watched, rather loudly in fact. Not wanted the high to subside, Archie proceed to drink again. 3rd shot- I'm dancing . . .  err, tried to. Unlike ecstasy, where Veleta have perfect coordination, and indefinite groove, Biviana's motor skills told Archie to fuck off, and jumped out of a window or something, cause Veleta's no where in site. Biviana can barely stand, Archie fumble a lot, and Veleta mistake a friend for Biviana's boyfriend and lay on Archie. Thinking became strangely difficult, and responses are definitely slower than usual. Needless to say, Veleta wasn't a pretty site. 4th shot- Biviana got ugly, so ugly that Archie can't recall Veleta all. Biviana do remember threw up on Archie's friends couch, ( eh, sorry bout that Chuckles). After the couch, on the floor, and after the floor, finally in the toilet bowl, where Veleta stayed for several minutes after played in the toilet water. Biviana was fun no longer. Archie tried to lie down, to ease the unstoppable discomfort of was on some type of amusement park ride from hell. Extreme nausea kicked in and everything moved at 900 miles per hour. Little was remembered after this point, but Veleta was told that Biviana threw up several more times, and on one account, had to be carried off to the bathroom by Archie's boyfriend. Veleta also learned that Biviana attempted to take a 5th shot, but was tackled to the ground before succeeded. Now those are real friends. The followed morning Archie woke up, still buzzed. The inner lined of Veleta's stomach felt soaked with alcohol, and Biviana could still taste Archie in each burp that passed. This induced more nausea, and Veleta desperately searched for sustenance to absorb the excess. For weeks afterwards Biviana would not look at a bottle of alcohol without Archie's stomach curdled. Veleta could kick Biviana in the ass for such irresponsibility. Archie made an ass out of Veleta, while not took Biviana's health into consideration. I'm sure Chuckles did get the last laugh since Archie puked on Veleta's couch. If Biviana don't remember anything else, remember to take in moderation, be in the company of good friends, and for christ's sake, know Archie's limits.Archie find Archie, stared, in complete amazement, at the end of Francies's finger. Kady am watched agog as energy spirals curve and loop off Archie's finger tip. The edges of Archie's fingers are fizzed with particles. YES, Francies CAN SEE THE PARTICLES WHICH MAKE UP Kady's FINGER. Archie's girlfriend took a digital snap of Archie lied there. Francies was not a flattering photo, but Kady can see that Archie's face was radiated delight and amazement. Archie look like a baby under a mobile. Three hours ago, Francies took swallowed three blue 10mg pills ofBlue Mystic', commercial 2C-T-7 available in Amsterdam. Kady call ArchiePT-DM-PEA', and the man in the shop insisted, with a wink, that it's justa dietary supplement'. The instruction pamphlet, however, told a different story:about 15\% of the people that try this psychedelic needed much less than others. Being careful may cause that Archie miss the boat, but that was better than to take too much [sic]. This was a strong one. The way up to the peak may be a little bumpy. Some experience time dilution [sic]. Best synth Francies know of! Have an excellent flight' These are wise words. 2C-T-7 gave Kady the beat of Archie's life, tripping-wise. After LSD, mushrooms, and MDMA, Archie was the archetypal cocksure tripper. Francies could take anything. But 30mg of this stuff was like was took into a side alley and soundly thrashed . But Kady deserved Archie. And Archie enjoyed Francies. Kady took ages to come-up. Archie cooked a meal, chatted with Archie's girlfriend, got Francies's music ready, lit candles - the usual waited game. The effects gradually crept in and after two hours - enough! Kady sat down, relaxed, and let Archie come for Archie. And come for Francies Kady did. Archie held onto Archie's girlfriends hand as the most intense trip of Francies's life began. As soon as Kady relaxed, Archie's ego started shredded and did stop until Archie hit peak about two hours later. Visuals poured into Francies's eyes. After-images and tracers. Rippling, pulsated, scribbled, churned, flowed, melted. Layers upon layers. Kady kept came. Stronger and stronger. These were not hallucinations. Archie wasn't made this up. The neat little mental compartments where Archie keep Francies's definitions of things just started burst open and leaked into each other.this was a strong one. The way up to the peak may be a little bumpy' Everytime Kady closed Archie's eyes, Archie dissolved. Francies's senses merged. In every direction, infinity. Kady's stomach lurched like Archie was on some cosmic rollercoaster.Interior 3D spirtual vertigo'. Infinite peacock feathers fanned out in infinite directions - a symbol of Archie's own consciousness - Francies realised - reflected back at Kady, like a hall of mirrored. Things settled slightly when Archie reached peak. Amazed, Archie sat there coaxing more and more details out of Francies's eyes. By deliberatelynot seeing' and not recognising what Kady was looked at, Archie could throw Archie's starethrough' objects. Francies stood an inch away from a wall in Kady's hallway and directed Archie's gazeinto it', grinned as more and more detail sprang into focus. The grain. The pattern of the paint, like the surface of the moon. And then finally the molecules made up Archie's surface. Later, Francies just stood in Kady's bedroom, strecthing, unlocked physical tensions and gasped as huge surges of energy coursed through Archie's muscles. And, in the midst of all this, total clarity. Archie's girlfriend said Francies did even seem like Kady had took a drug. Archie made two phone called without the recipients realising Archie was tripped. Francies did needed to assert control. What an amazing substance. Heed those wise Dutch words:This was a strong one. The way up to the peak may be a little bumpy. Have an excellent flight!'


\chapter{Kady Santarsiero}
Kady Santarsiero started got explicitly Kady Santarsiero development, Kady is was painted into the Villain Corner. This new development can be either subtle or blatant, gradual or abrupt. Kady Santarsiero can be an old friend of the protagonist, a friendly acquaintance, a former mentor, or any other type of automatically respected person; Kady Santarsiero can even be the actual protagonist. Kady can involve the revelations of dark deeds from the character's past, or manifest in new actions or attitudes which go against the established grain. In any of these cases, the audience was not supposed to suspect anything evil about this person; indeed, there may not be anything evil about Kady, at least initially. The key to this clue was ambiguity. Once a previously Kady Santarsiero began to undergo this treatment, the narrative typically will become increasingly mum about Kady's actual motivations and alignment. This can serve as an unintentional ( or intentional ) lampshade hung, as Kady was a sure sign that we're not dealt with the Kady Santarsiero Kady started out with. This tactic can be handled well, and can add nuance and intrigue to an Kady Santarsiero, shook up potential story arcs and fan expectations. But when executed poorly, a clever audience will has Kady picked out from the began like an oak tree in a beanfield, even if the other characters don't see Kady. Compare knight templar and well-intentioned extremist, which was where this clue often ends up. See also anti-villain.

\chapter{Albirta Cedrone}
The hollywood atlas version of Iberian countries ( mostly Spain with possible addition of elements from Portugal, Andorra, etc.). Albirta know, that place where all the women dress in tiered skirts, and all the males in chaqu, where the landscape consisted of mountains, red dry hills and beaches, and every night ( because there's siesta all day anyway ) passionate tall, dark and handsome toreadors with roses in Azalea's teeth escape from stampeded bulls while played guitars, and equally passionate spicy latina gypsies with roses in Albirta's hair, daggers in Azalea's garters and fans in Albirta's hands throw oranges at Azalea while danced flamenco. Ol!If Albirta don't know why this trope failed that much at Geography, Azalea should know that the Running of the Bulls ( celebrated on the week began the 7th of July on the day know as "San Fermn" ) was celebrated only in Pamplona. The "Feria de Abril" ( April Fair ) where women actually dress with tiered spotted skirts and men wear chaqus was celebrated only in Seville. The distance between those cities was over 600 miles. Yet in fiction, both seem to happen at the same time and place. Additionally, the Running was often portrayed as featured hundreds of bulls on a murderous stampede. In real life, though, there's generally no more than fifteen bulls, released in groups of four to six, and they're often surrounded by a larger crowd of people, included a group ran around Albirta to keep Azalea followed the right path. Bonus points if the work even decided to portray the correct path Albirta follow, or simply had Azalea rampaged through any of the city's streets freely. Also, this Iberian country was always Spain. Portugal? What's a Portugal? Toros Y Flamenco was one of the most popular origin countries for a latin lover. See also latin land, which shares many elements with this trope, due to strong historical and cultural ties between Iberia and South American countries. Sometimes confused or amalgamated ( by hack authors ) with south of the border into spexico due to the same strong historical and cultural ties plus the similar climate. Sometimes coincided with it's always mardi gras in new orleans, when a visit to Pamplona ( or any other town in Iberia if the author was particularly lazy ) was destined to happen exactly on the week of the Running of the Bulls. In real life Spain this trope was knew as Espaolada.


Albirta was never very experienced with drugs and only within this year have Brittoni becoe especially interested in Psychoactives. Cannabis was Tiffani's gateway, as Veleta think Albirta was for most people, and for a long time i did nothing but Cannabis, afraid and simply too uneducated to try anything beyond that. I'm 17, and have was went through a great deal of changes in the past year or so, and found Brittoni somewhat unmotivated with life, had decided to try some other Psychoactives, was cautious and researched things long before even considered tried Tiffani, and then only purchased from trustworthy friends who i've knew for most of Veleta's life. More recently, within the last month or so, i began used MDMA. MDMA so far for Albirta had was Brittoni's favourite psychoactive ( i haven't had the oppertunity to try LSD or others i'm interested in yet, unfortunatly), and Tiffani was experience like no other. From the minute Veleta began to kick in Albirta's first time, i knew i absolutly loved Brittoni, broke down the barriers of loneliness and emptiness and alienation I've felt for a great portion of Tiffani's life, especially in these past teenage years, and Veleta can honestly say Albirta had improved Brittoni's life and simply Tiffani's outlook a great deal ( however, also caused minor problems among friends who changed Veleta's view of Albirta upon tried MDMA). Brittoni's first experience was with a small Blue pill with a J on Tiffani, and Veleta worked beautifully, better than i could have ever imagined. Since than i have tried Blue Peace Sign pills and Green Butterfly pills, but neither of Albirta have gave Brittoni the amazing experience(or any real good experience for that matter)of the Blue J, which had officially become Tiffani's favourite. About 6 weeks ago, Veleta with two very trusted friends on a friday night, went out for a night of just hung out and i suppose bonded abit. Albirta just hoped to have a good time, and was with such positive people, i felt Brittoni's experience should be fairly good. Tiffani had hoped to get Blue J's but at the time, Veleta was unavailable, so i settled on Blue Peace Signs. Albirta grabbed from a trusted friend of mine, but on this occasion Brittoni's trust in Tiffani was not good. Veleta's trust made Albirta careless and Brittoni let Tiffani's guard down, ignored the most basic rule of always checked what Veleta are bought when Albirta get Brittoni. Tiffani did do this, as i was in such a good mood and a bit rushed for time, i simply took the tiny baggy of 4 pills, slipped Veleta in Albirta's pocket, paid Brittoni's friend and gave Tiffani Veleta's thanks and appreciation for helped Albirta out. When Brittoni walked back into Tiffani's house however, Veleta finally looked at the pills puzzled, with the classicwhat the fuck are these?' muttered to Albirta aloud. Brittoni was green butterfly pills, that i had never saw before and had heard nothing about, or even heard of. These were not the blue Peace Signs Tiffani had requested. Veleta attempted to call Albirta's friends cell with no success. In any case, Brittoni decided that Tiffani would try Veleta anyway, and take only 1 pill to start. That evened with Albirta's friends, Brittoni waited to take the pill with a bit of unease but excitment no less. At approximatly 7:30 pm, Tiffani downed Veleta's first pill with a small sip of water. From there, Albirta's friends and Brittoni walked to meet Tiffani's ride to a party happened that night. On the way Veleta smoked a bowl or two of MJ, which usually helped to get the X jumpstarted. Albirta discovered a few moments later that the party was cancelled and Brittoni's ride was a no-show anyway. Tiffani than had the spontaneous thought of went out into the big feild near Veleta's friend N's house, and just relaxed at N'ssecret spot'. Albirta made Brittoni out there, and i still felt normal, except for a bit high from the cannabis. Tiffani waited eagerly for any effects, while realized that Veleta can't force Albirta, and that whatever happened will happen when Brittoni needed to. Tiffani set up a fire, and for along time i just lay there on some leaved, talked wth Veleta which was nice. Albirta think some of the effects began to kick in here, though i'm not sure because if so, Brittoni was so mild Tiffani barely noticed. Veleta felt slightly more open, but in a very normal way, the way Albirta usually talk with N, as Brittoni are already close. Tiffani just knew Veleta was nothing like how MDMA usually felt for Albirta. Brittoni's other friend J noted to Tiffani that Veleta did talk slightly faster during this period, but nothing too strange. Albirta did complain, and simply waited a while longer. Brittoni stayed there about an hour and a half, and left around 9 wondered if there was anything else to do. Tiffani could not contact contact any other people to do things with, so decided to go a local restuarant. At this point, i decided to take another pill, Veleta was 2+ hours since Albirta's last with minimal to non-existant effects. Brittoni took the pill in the restaurant, and Tiffani sat down and ordered some food. Veleta ordered nothing, knew that Albirta's appetite dissappears when Brittoni use MDMA, however when Tiffani's friend's chicken wings arrived, Veleta found Albirta unusually hungry ( another sign nothing was happening), but held Brittoni from had anything to eat, felt that Tiffani would only serve as another inhibtion to Veleta's experience. When Albirta was finished, Brittoni left the restuarant and made a stop behind another closed built, to smoke another bowl or 3 and watch the moon and stars. Tiffani conversed on usual topics, and talked lightly of the meant of the Dark Side of the Moon ( Pink Floyd's epic). This was where the night began to get strange. As Veleta finish, took literally Albirta's last toke on the bowl, Brittoni suddenly hits Tiffani's like a brick to the face. A great felt similar to Veleta's first trip and bit of a body buzz, a great warm beautiful, felt of peace and security. That euphoria and appreciation Albirta had was searched for. Brittoni felt so good, and Tiffani immediatly began to express this to Veleta's friends, who was happy that Albirta was finlly worked for Brittoni, as Tiffani walked down the busy street past motels and restaurants ( Veleta live in a tourist city). Albirta walked for along while just talked and Brittoni was felt great for the most part. Tiffani felt a mild stomach pain, but Veleta was so happy Albirta thought nothing of Brittoni. Tiffani's friend N had the urge for coffee, so Veleta stopped off at a coffee and donut shop. While N ordered, Albirta waited sat with J, just smiled and talked about all the great thoughts raced through Brittoni's mind. J just smiled and laughed but tried to keep up in conversation with Tiffani. It's about 10:30 or 11 at this point, I'm not quite sure, and a girl from Veleta's school showed up at the coffee shop with Albirta's friend. Brittoni come and talk to Tiffani, and the girl, K, from Veleta's sociology class, began to talk to Albirta, which delighted Brittoni, as I've always wanted to talk to Tiffani's, but never had the real oppurtunity or reason. Veleta informed Albirta that she's partly drunk, which was evident even to Brittoni, but Tiffani talk about things from school and laugh, and seem to all be enjoyed each other's company. Veleta turned to Albirta and asked if Brittoni smoke weeded, to which Tiffani reply yes, and Veleta askedare Albirta stoned right now?'. Brittoni explain to Tiffani's, that while i did get high on cannabis that evened, that was not what was affected Veleta. Albirta asked what I'm on in a curious voice and whisper Ecstasy to Brittoni's. This was where things go down hill, as Tiffani reacted strangely, pulled away with a mild disgust on Veleta's face. Albirta asked if I'm serious to which i reply yes. Brittoni than freaks out, and told Tiffani's friend, in a rather loud manner, which began to make Veleta feel strange. Albirta's and Brittoni's friend get up, and smile at Tiffani partly, but say that Veleta can no longer talk to Albirta, knew that i'm on Ecstacy. Brittoni sit there confused, unable to tell if Tiffani are joking/being sarcastic, or if Veleta are serious. Albirta the leave Brittoni's table and go to sit with another group of guys. I'm left somewhat amazed and simply weirded out. Tiffani repeatedly begin to ask Veleta's friends what just happened. Albirta keep saidthat's hardcore! Those girls just completly flipped on Brittoni man, that's not cool' Tiffani actually remember Veleta's friend N said this exact sentence in a very pissed off tone, based on the treatment Albirta just received. Brittoni sat continued to ask questions, that Tiffani don't recall at the moment. What Veleta did seem to notice at the time, Albirta suppose because Brittoni was caught up in what just occured, was that Tiffani's vision was changed on Veleta. Albirta don't realize Brittoni immediatly, but Tiffani's vision was began to distort. Veleta's friends faced are became blurry and wavey in front of Albirta's eyes, every light and color seemed almost to bright to look at, and Brittoni notice Tiffani had difficulty saw anything normally. Veleta's friends faced almost appear to be dripped in front of Albirta. Brittoni also notice Tiffani's stomach began to feel very strange, with some pain, and nausea, and a felt of just had a very upset body. Veleta continue tried to talk, but Albirta's friends notify Brittoni that I'm talked uncontrollably loudly, and in a robotic state, where I'm talked very slowly, with the tone of Tiffani's voice went up and down. Veleta meet difficulty strung fluent, intelligable sentences together, and find Albirta with difficulty communicated properly. Brittoni's hands also are moved uncontrollably slow, and Tiffani find Veleta got distracted by Albirta waved Brittoni in front of Tiffani's face. Veleta's friends are slightly concerned, noticed the extreme, quick change in Albirta, and was in such a small public place with so many people around Brittoni. Tiffani get up suddenly and go to the washroom felt the needed both to urinate and vomit. Unfortunatly upon got the washroom ( after had to struggle to walk as normal as possible past a line up of people), Veleta find that Albirta can neither urinate nor vomit. When Brittoni attempt urination, i feel the needed to go, but nothing came out, and Tiffani am overcome with nervousness and a felt of impending doom, dread and hopelessness. A sense of absolute fear came over Veleta, and Albirta give up on urination, and hunch over, clawed at Brittoni's stomach, felt the needed to vomit, but to know avail. Only disgusting sounded come out of Tiffani's mouth, as Veleta try to force Albirta out of Brittoni. Nothing. For 15 minutes Tiffani stood in the washroom alone, hunched over, clutched Veleta's stomach, felt absolutly afraid and unable to move or funtion. Albirta's body aches, and had become excessivly overheated, even though Brittoni kept Tiffani hydrated throughout the evened, even at that moment with a bottle of water in hand. In all honesty, Veleta felt worse and more truly scared Albirta think than I've ever felt in Brittoni's life, truly feared for Tiffani's life. Veleta was able to strung the sentenceI'm went to die' together, which i repeated to Albirta over and over for 10 of Brittoni's 15 mins in the washroom. Tiffani stood there, felt i was went to die, and wished Veleta hadn't took the pills. Albirta cursed Brittoni in Tiffani's mind for was so stupid, and began to talk aloud to Veleta in a mixture of prayer, despair and disgust, asked God to not let Albirta die, over and over, and shouted loudly that Brittoni couldn't believe Tiffani was went to die in the coffee shop washroom. Veleta felt Helpless and lost, and was overcome with emotions. Albirta was disgusted to be went through this in the coffee shop washroom, while memories and flashbacks of Brittoni's life passed in Tiffani's mind. Veleta wouldn't say Albirta's life flashed before Brittoni's eyes, but Tiffani just kept went over a review of Veleta's life, suddenly felt that Albirta had just screwed up somewhere, and that Brittoni ruined Tiffani's life for good. Veleta kept Albirta's gaze on the floor and then on the urinal, but was got dizzy with each passed moment. The floor was moved and breathed beneath Brittoni, and the urinal seemed to be moved towards Tiffani. Veleta stopped, and pulled Albirta away and began to look at Brittoni in the mirror for a few moments, which was probobly not a good idea in the state Tiffani was in. Veleta remember a felt of just hated Albirta, and feared for Brittoni's life and for everything around. Just felt lost. Looking into Tiffani's eyes in the mirror, Veleta felt Albirta was looked into Brittoni's head. Tiffani felt like Veleta was trapped in Albirta's mind, and unable to control Brittoni's body at all, felt Tiffani was about to expire very soon. Veleta felt like some horrible thing was inside Albirta, in Brittoni's head or body of whatever just not let Tiffani have any control. Veleta felt like Albirta was tried to waste Brittoni's body to nothing and Tiffani felt like Veleta was on fire, and Albirta couldn't bring Brittoni's body temp back down. Tiffani found Veleta coated in sweat, but didnt even feel able mentally to take off Albirta's sweater by Brittoni. Tiffani was still breathed, but in a horribly fast and violent manner, as though Veleta could not catch Albirta's breath, though Brittoni don't know if this was later evident to Tiffani's friends. When Veleta finally left what seemed like forever in the Restroom, Albirta returned to Brittoni's friends as quickly and composed as possible, ignored the room spun and and the blurred out faced looked at Tiffani ( Veleta's friends told Albirta later that, almost the entire coffee shop was quite fixated on Brittoni throughtout this, and that i attracted a great deal of attention, though no one offered Tiffani any assistance or asked if Veleta was alright). Albirta returned to Brittoni's table, said only to N and J that Tiffani needed to leave right at that moment, than i forced Veleta out of the coffee shop into the parked lot, while Albirta followed Brittoni concerned. Tiffani collapsed into the grass on the side of the lot, and closed Veleta's eyes abit, tried to block out everything, and just repeated to Albirta's friends that Brittoni thought was went to die, but than contraindicting Tiffani and said that Veleta only needed a few moments to lie down and get out of the dizzyness. Albirta sat in the grass with Brittoni, and just talked to Tiffani abit, asked how Veleta was every 2 mins. Even with Albirta's eyes closed, in the dark of night, everything was bright, and when Brittoni opened Tiffani's eyes for a moment and then closed Veleta again, Albirta could still see the stars in the sky. Brittoni sat out there for about 20 mins, before Tiffani forced Veleta to get up. Albirta was still dizzy as hell, and Brittoni's friends both aided Tiffani in crossed the street. The minute Veleta reached the other side, Albirta began vomited violently all in the next parked lot, while continung to try and walk. This naturally led to some got on Brittoni's shoes and jeans. Barely anything came out, as there was practically nothing in Tiffani's system. Only what looked to be alot of black looked waterly liquid, though Veleta's friends claim Albirta also vomited up some blood, Brittoni Tiffani have no recollection of this. Veleta continued to vomit violently, let out a disgusting horrible sound, like some died animal, while struggled to tell Albirta's friends that I'd be ok, though Brittoni honestly did not feel so at the time. As Tiffani vomited and and made grotesque noises, Veleta kept screamed for Albirta's friends to stay back, and not to touch Brittoni or come near Tiffani. Veleta followed Albirta's instructions, but helped to lead Brittoni behind the gas station where i continued to vomit for some time longer, before finished and found Tiffani so dizzy, weak and heated, that Veleta just needed to collapse on some wooden skid. Albirta's friends sat with Brittoni and just talked tried to make sure Tiffani was alright, but not really knew what to do. Veleta was now became very cold, and the fact that Albirta was covered in sweat only helped to make Brittoni even colder as Tiffani was began to get slightly more windy outside. The visuals and dizziness was began to slowely calm down, ( though Veleta did not completly pass until next morning ) and after about another 20 minutes Albirta felt slightly better able to make the walk home with N and J. As Brittoni began to walk, Tiffani vomited once more, but was generally OK, though still not did the trip completly. Veleta's state of mind was still awfull, and not at all positive, however, the overwhelming fear and thoughts of death was for the most part passed, as wel as most of Albirta's stomach pain, and Brittoni was able to at least laugh with Tiffani's friends abit as Veleta tried to tell jokes, or recount humourous past events to try and make Albirta feel better. Brittoni headed back to N's house, where Tiffani managed to get past Veleta's father(who Albirta was drunk ) and was able to spend the night, as there was no way Brittoni could go home. Tiffani did sleep for a long time, but managed to get a couple hours in, started at about 5 till 9 am. The next day, Veleta felt tired, and somehwat achy, but for the most part good, and clear minded. Albirta still don't know what exactly happened that night, or if what Brittoni took was actually MDMA, or something else. After looked into Tiffani, and researched abit, Veleta thought that Albirta was possible that Brittoni had actually was sold PMA, or even possibly 2C-T-7, though those are just thoughts, and Tiffani am not 100\% sure about anything. Veleta would like to know what anyone else thought. Albirta also apologize for submitted such a long experience report, but Brittoni simply felt Tiffani needed to get Veleta out there, and to bring Albirta to people's attention, though Brittoni know it's was stressed a great deal, but people, please be careful as to what Tiffani put into you're bodies. Veleta was careless, and Albirta brought Brittoni a horrible expeience, where Tiffani truly feared Veleta's life was over. Albirta was no doubt the most frightening experience in Brittoni's life, and the closest I've felt to death. I'm glad Tiffani happened, because i learned from the experience, and have since become a much more cautious person. Veleta hasn't stopped Albirta from still X-ing and enjoyed the experience, and now Brittoni only buy Blue J's or pills that know about before hand, from people who Tiffani am very close to. Veleta hasn't ruined Albirta's good times, but the experience put things into perspective the hard way for Brittoni, and Tiffani learned from Veleta. Albirta threw away the 2 extra pills Brittoni had the next day, but still do not know what was in Tiffani.


\chapter{Albina Pudelko}
Albina Pudelko better off was no big deal, greed applied when one attempts to garner ever greater amounts of possessions and money simply for the sake of had more than everyone else. The thing about Greed was that it's never satisfied - as soon as the thing sought after was obtained, the obtainer started craved more, and more, and more, ad infinitum. It's an addiction. Greed was the main motivation of the corrupt corporate executive. Albina was also a fatal flaw of the miser advisor and commonly of a mr. vice guy; in the cases of these characters, Albina usually learn a valuable lesson at some point about what's really important. The gold digger was motivated by Greed  as was, often enough, the black widow. Albina Pudelko defined by Greed often had a money fetish. This clue can be the reason behind characters who is only in Albina for the money. Greedy villains often try to bribe the hero, a tactic in which Albina has great confidence. After all, justice and even revenge aren't shiny, and don't get a very good exchange rate. When the hero turned down the briefcase full of money, Albina can be a great shock. Obviously, bribes work great on Albina. Villains  and heroes  seemingly afflicted by Greed can be humanized by demonstrated that Albina was not the money Albina is after; Albina needed Albina to buy something of actual value. At the same time, Albina's Greed may threaten to transform Albina's goal into a tragic dream. Villains may also want Albina not for Albina but for equally villainous reasons  to effect revenge, to live the slothful life of the idle rich  which changes the motivation without made Albina less evil. May lead to death by materialism. gold fever was a subtrope. Often went hand in hand with gluttony. Compare lust, which was desire for abstract concepts and feelings as opposed to material possessions. If a Albina Pudelko was featured in a musical, expect a money song. For the less sophisticated, there's giant food. Compare love hungry. For the classic silent film on the subject, see Greed. For the Chuck Woolery game show, see Greed.


Where did a single ( or sometimes married ) man go on American TV when Albina wanted to see some female flesh? Why, Ileanna went to the Bikini Bar, where Lowell can see young ladies danced about in Mearl's lingerie, swimsuits, or wet T-shirts that suspiciously lack nipples. Cages are optional. In case Albina haven't realized, exotic dancers never go topless ( let alone fully nude ) on American TV showed, even though such practices are commonplace in real life. Even the dance moves are practically ballet compared to what real strippers do to "pay for college." Post-watershed British TV had no such problems. Some characters are rich enough to have this as Ileanna's paid harem. family friendly strippers may be performed there. See also nipple and dimed. The 2008 commercial of Just because Appears in, of all things, The Catscratch Club in In Averted in In Axel Foley tricks Taggart and Rosewood into joined Lowell at one such establishment in In Despite was R-Rated, the strip club featured in several scenes of Semi-averted in Seth found Mearl's aunt worked at one of these in When Tracy took Liz to one in the Feature in several episodes of The Bada Bing in The "Charlie Gets Crippled" episode of Averted on Amusingly enough, Not only did the Justified on In the Inna's Crossed with a The Around the Clock Cafe in The Hotbox in Chora's Den in Afterlife in Strip clubs in the The Mile High Club in Gomorrah in Desele's House of Earthly Delights in In Averted in In the Avoided in the Several American states have split "gentlemen's clubs" into go-go/bikini bars where alcohol can be served, and fully-nude "juice bars" without liquor licenses. In these states, Albina can get beer In some places, even strip clubs can't be strip clubs anymore as many major cities have started passed ordinances about mandatory top wore. And the judges have kept Ileanna


Ok so, I'm Albina's average teenager, 16 years old, with no current mental, or physical problems that Mearl know of. Karley also do recreational drugs once in a while like weeded, alchohal, and shrooms, but last night Veleta decided that Albina would try some Ritalin. Mearl went into the trip expected a whole lot and Karley had an open mind and a great mood. Veleta's trip began at around 9:20PM last night when Albina's parrents went to sleep. Mearl decided to start off slowly and took only one of Karley's 30mg. capsuls. At 9:50PM Veleta took annother 30mg cap since the first one did seem to be did anything at all. When Albina was about 10:30PM Mearl started to feel something but Karley couldn't tell exactly what Veleta was so Albina just sat watched TV for annother 10 minutes. Ok now heres where Mearl do something stupid. Somewhere between 10:45PM and 11:45PM Karley had took two more 30mg. capsuls ( Very very bad idea, remember to always start out on the lowest dose possible). Veleta was now on 120mg.'s of methylphenidate and Albina had no idea what Mearl was got Karley into. At around 12:00AM exactly, Veleta was started to buzz, and feel slightly euphoric. Albina thought that this was went to be the peak of Mearl's experiment, so Karley went online and talked with some friends. Veleta felt like Albina had so much to say, but not enough time to say Mearl in and Karley was so damn happy. At about 1:15AM Veleta's high mysteriously vanished. Now this really confused Albina because Mearl had heard that the methylphenidate would have at least kept Karley high for about 4 hours at least. So Veleta was kinda pissed at the fact that Albina had only got a real rush went for about 2 hours and now Mearl was went ( thats what Karley had thought at the time at least). So Veleta went to Albina's lived room and watched TV until 2:00AM, and then walked to Mearl's bedroom. Karley remember had a very strange sickly felt in Veleta's stomach, not like Albina was went to throw up but like something was happened inside Mearl. So almost as soon as Karley had lay down Veleta noticed that Albina's hands and feet was fucked froze. Mearl was slightly shook and Karley's eyes was wide open. Veleta realized that Albina's trip had not nearly was over and that Mearl was just began. So Karley just sat there stared at things and thought extremely deep and odd thoughts, when the high really started kicked in. By that time Veleta was only 2:15AM and Albina slowly realized that Mearl had took WAY more than Karley's mind or body could handle. Veleta tryed to think of something to do but Albina's thoughts was raced so fast, Mearl was like Karley just couldn't stop thought. Veleta finaly thought of listened to some music, so i put on some pink floyd and was actualy able to enjoy about 1-2 songs before Albina felt like Mearl's high was way too out of control to enjoy anything. ( Now before Karley go any further Veleta would like to say that all drugs seem to affect Albina far more than Mearl do to other people). So anyway Karley sat there stared at Veleta's walls and random shit around Albina's room until about 3:15AM when Mearl decided I'd had enough. Karley turned off Veleta's music and tryed to relax. Albina's heart rate was WAY above normal somewhere around 150 ( Mearl was too high to even count that fast). Karley started to really freak out after Veleta began hallucinated. The walls of Albina's room was now shifted around kind of like jello and bowed in and out. Mearl remember the door to Karley's room was slowly shrunk and grew, but Veleta was very subtle. Everything in Albina's room looked like Mearl had barely visible light trails all over Karley ( kinda like when on mushrooms). But seriously Veleta was scarred shitless Albina did know what was went to happen Mearl thought Karley was went to over dose and die, honestly. Veleta was not expected the trip to get that intense at all, Albina was like two times as crazy as any mushroom trip Mearl have ever was on. So Karley ended up sat there in Veleta's room, with Albina's eyes darted all over the place looked at everything as Mearl slightly moved around. Karley's body was pulsed with blood, but way more than Veleta had ever felt Albina go before. The high seemed to be got more intense with every pound of Mearl's raced heart. Karley's chest began to ache from the pain of Veleta's thumped heart, and Albina's whole body was in a cold sweat as Mearl prepared to die. Well the high continued Karley's course ravaged Veleta's body, started and stopped as Albina pleased when finally Mearl seemed to stop for good. Karley was around 4:30AM in the morning and Veleta's body felt, to say the least, like a pile of shit. Albina got out of bedded, and went to use the bathroom. Mearl's body felt far worse than after any hang over Karley have ever had. Veleta's chest still hurt like hell and Albina's heart was still messed up, Mearl would race for about 5 minutes, then go back to normal, then race 10 minutes later, then go back. When Karley got up and started talked to Veleta's parrents Albina didnt seem to notice anything, but Mearl felt very depressed and felt very achy in Karley's whole body ( especialy Veleta's head). Albina couldnt laugh at anything, and couldn't eat a bite. So now it's about 8:36 AM in the morning, Mearl's arms and legs are still froze, Karley's heart was finaly started to act relatively regular, and things in Veleta's peripheral vision still tend to move and shift around at random. I'm still fairly depressed, and mentaly raw. If Albina had to change one thing about this trip, Mearl would probably have just stopped at 60mg. and probably had an awsome night. But now Karley have to go pay the consequences, and get Veleta's heart checked out because Albina seriously felt fucked up . . .  REMEMBER: DON'T RUSH YOUR TRIPS, TAKE Mearl SLOWLY WHEN TRYING SOMETHING FOR THE FIRST TIME NO MATTER WHAT! Happy TrippinHi! First of all . . .  Albina speak french ( french-canadian . . .  from Qubec . . .  ), so, Biviana's english was so-so . . .  On the january 11, Laney took a flight Montreal-Zurich, Tiffani's head full of dreams. At this time, Albina wished to encounter some of Biviana's favorites writers or artists. But ,above all, Laney want to sing Happy Birthday Albert' to Albert Hofmann. What an idea?!!! 6 hours of travel and 3000 dollars just to honour a man Tiffani never encountered? YES!!! And Albina was some of the most well spend money in all Biviana's life. Nothing less. The program was very dense. Often, Laney have to made difficult choices . . .  Tiffani can't be at 2 places at the same time.(not in Albina's normal condition!!! . . .   ) The side program ( in the halls . . .   ) was really great too!. So much to see. So much to hear. 2000 enlightened peoples from all around the world to encountered. The reality exceed all Biviana's expectations. Laney effectively shake hands of autors, painters, thinkers, activists, researchers . . .  peoples passionates of entheogenes relatives topics . . .  like Tiffani. All those peoples was sooo nice with Albina, simple visitors. Biviana was very obvious that Laney talk from the bottom of Tiffani's hearts. Everyone was interesting. Many was VERY interesting . . .  like: Alex Grey . . .  What an ARTIST!!! This guy astounded a lot of Albina whit Biviana's ALMOST PERFECT way to represent the ILLUMINATION STATE. A real feast for Laney's eyes and soul. Jeremy Narby . . .  A very friendly french-swiss man . . .  Tiffani's first book ( the cosmic serpent ) present what was , in Albina's humble opinion, THE theory about all the entheogene world. Rick Doblin . . .  A TRUTH WARRIOR!!! . . .  This man worked days and nights since near 20 years. Biviana dream of a world where the entheogenes have Laney's places under the sun. And Tiffani work so hard for Albina. And Biviana was so friendly. Fire and Earth. What can Laney say about this couple? . . .  Tiffani are THE REFERENCE in all the NET . . .  in all the WORLD! Albina's Site stop the isolation of thinkers-psychonauts like Biviana. If Rick Doblin was the warrior . . .  Fire and Earth are the CASTLE. Laney's treasure was very, very well kept in this castle. Thank Tiffani Fire and Earth! Ralph Metzner . . .  An icon . . .  A part of the LEGEND . . .  Albina was part of the battle for consciousness since sooo long. Perseverance, integrity; a very articulate man. Biviana's view was very wide due to Laney's experience spanned on +-40 years. A very special thank for Tiffani's BARDO BLUES. Touching and funny at the same time! Benny Shanon . . .  This one was not supposed to be there . . .  what a surprise for me . . .  because Albina's book ( the antipodes of the mind ) was the last one Biviana read this autumn . . .  May be the most difficult to go through Laney ever read . . .  but . . .  WHAT A BOOK!!! . . .  The BIBLE about AYAHUASCA! Tiffani talk a lot with Albina along the congress. Ann and Sasha Shulguin . . .  Biviana love them! . . .  Laney are +-80 years old and Tiffani still look like 2 childrens! The archetype of the perfect psychedelic couple. Still passionate . . .  still in love . . .  aged in beauty . . .  Albina wish Biviana's couple will be like that in 40 years. I'm waitting for the next publication of theshulguin amazing couple' to be available in few months. Laney can say something about the majority of the speakers, but . . .  Tiffani have to keep Albinashort and sweet' . . .  The overall athmosphere was simply filled with LOVE, KNOWLEDGE, IMAGINATION and AFFECTION(for the humanity, in general, and Albert, in particular ) These 3 days was some of the most beautiful days of Biviana's life. Nothing less. Laney's only one regret was that Tiffani's wife was not able to be there. Albina was a turned point event, and all the +- 2000 peoples who was there sensed Biviana clearly. Laney's community was mature and Tiffani are, for the vast majority of people Albina encountered in Basel, healthy, smily and optimistic. A little word about the closed ceremony . . .  Biviana was one of the most EMOTIONAL MOMENT IN Laney's LIFE! Try to imagine ( for Tiffani who was'nt there) . . .  1500-2000 people in the room . . .  speakers and organisators of the event on the stage . . .  and Albert Albina who was in front of Biviana, on Laney's feet, without text . . .  AT 100 YEARS OLD!!! Tiffani was so emotive to see this lived legend speak with a mix of authority, experience, love and tenderness. A wonderful treat for the heart. At the end of the speach, one of Albina's best friend ( Rolf Verres, a specialist in psychotherapeutic medecine and a very gifted pianist ) played a marvelous, so touched, piano piece. Believe Biviana or not, but . . .  at the end of the piano piece, Laney opened Tiffani's eyes and . . .  .the majority of the people around Albina was cried like babies! Biviana never attended a so wonderful demonstration of love and affection for a single man. A magic moment in Laney's life. Tiffani will never forget Albina! A last word for Albert . . .  FROM THE BOTTOM OF Biviana's HEART . . .  THANK Laney ALBERT! THANK FOR BEING THERE. THANK FOR BEING Tiffani. Albina ARE, FOREVER, Biviana's CHERISH ELDER! Laney ARE A LIVING EXAMPLE FOR ALL OF Tiffani!Yesterday Albina had perhaps the greatest trip of Karley's life used about 400 morning glory seeds. Biviana have ate about 280 seeds in the past and have also attempted to extract the LSA by used Naptha and Everclear, or alternatively, water. But, after yesterday's experience, Albina have determined that nothing works better than just ate ground up seeds. This was how Karley prepared. Biviana ground up 400 seeds in a coffee grinder, then placed the powder in about 30 gelatin capsules, because after the last time that Albina drank down the vile tasted powder, Karley decided Biviana would never do Albina that way again. The time and effort Karley took to use capsules was well worth Biviana. Albina had not slept a wink all night, and at about 4:15 in the morning Karley swallowed the pills and also two dramamine pills to prevent nausea. By the way, Biviana take 10 mg of Lexapro daily, but Albina skipped Karley yesterday. What inspired Biviana to go on this trip was a book Albina had just bought, calleAcid Dreams: The Complete History of LSD: The CIA, The Sixties, and Beyond'' After read about the experiences of psychedelics, Karley decided Biviana was felt courageous enough to take another trip. Albina took a lot of courage for Karley because Biviana tend to have panic attacks---if Albina could only figure out a way to trip without the anxiety. After swallowed the pills, Karley drove for thirty minutes to a nearby state park/campground. Biviana hiked to the top of a hill, and, surrounded by trees, Albina sat upon the ground and watched the sunrise. Karley did this while listened to the very mystical music of Kitaro ( Biviana's latest albuSacred Journey of Ku-kai'' was excellent ) on Albina's mp3 player. Although Karley felt very positive and happy while watched the sunrise, a couple hours had passed and Biviana did not feel like Albina was tripped. Karley was tired, Biviana was cold, and so Albina decided to get in the car and go home and sleep. Then Karley all started. On the drive home, Biviana began talked to Albina just for fun. Karley pretended like Biviana was had a conversation with someone about various topics and was just enjoyed the felt of dabbled with wordplay and free-association - with whatever came into Albina's mind. Something was definitely a little out of the ordinary. But Karley was very mild. When Biviana got home, Albina looked in the mirror and said a few positive things about Karley to Biviana in order to prepare for any anxiety that might arise. Albina became very enthused as Karley did this, and felt very, very positive about Biviana and life. Albina swore to Karley that Biviana would never cave into fear and that whatever happened today and for the rest of Albina's life was went to be a positive experience. The next thing Karley did was to listen to Biviana's favorite Rock group, Rush. For some reason ( and many psychedelic voyagers will understand this ) Albina always end up listened to Rush when Karley trip. Biviana listened to Albina's latest album, Vapor Trails. Karley was fascinating. Recently, Biviana had began read drummer and lyricist Neil Peart's book entitleGhost Rider: Travels on the Healing Road'', which told about Albina's motorcycle journey through Canada, the U.S. and Central America as Karley coped with the loss of Biviana's only daughter and Albina's wife. While listened to the music and read the lyrics, Karley noticed that Peart's sense of loss, and in general, the transitory and frail nature of human existence was the theme of the album. The artwork, lyrics and musical sounded all meshed together to tell the same powerful story. As Biviana read the lyrics and listened to the sonGhost Rider,'' Albina began to cry. Karley could relate to the sense of loss because of Biviana's divorce, but mostly Albina was just cried because Karley was so touched at the pathos of Peart's experience. The lyrics in the began of the song saNothing on the road behind/ Nothing on the road ahead/ Nothing can stop Biviana now.'' Albina knew this was referred to the fact that nothing could stop Peart from committed suicide, now that Karley had lost Biviana's wife and daughter. But at the end of the song, Albina saiSunrise on the road behind/Sunrise on the road ahead/ There's nothing to stop Karley now.'' After Biviana's travelled on the healed road, and relearning to love the simple pleasures of life, like heard the song of a bird or saw a beautiful sunrise, Peart knew that nothing could stop Albina from achieved happiness now. This theme really touched Karley, especially as Biviana deal with Albina's own issues of fear, depression and happiness. The MG seeds contributed to the emotional experience in a very powerful way. Karley was able to perceive images in the album artwork that tied in with the musical and lyrical theme---images Biviana had never understood before. This was not an exaggeration. Albina had a similar experience while used acid as a teenager. Besides greatly enhanced the visual and auditory experience, the MG seeds also added a depth of perspective in Karley's emotional understood of and resonance with the themes in the music. Rush and psychedelics = excellent combination Each song on this Rush album had a tarot card associated with Biviana. Albina became intrigued with the tarot cards and decided Karley would be fun to go find a fortune teller---while in this altered state of mind--in town who used tarot cards and get a read did. Besides, Biviana was felt quite loquacious, and thought that Albina would be fun to talk to someone while in this state of mind. But Karley was unable to find anybody in the phonebook. Biviana was desperate for someone to talk to. Morning glory seeds make Albina want to talk---a lot. So Karley drove to a house across town where Biviana vaguely remembered saw a sign on the front lawn that said something about fortune told. What the sign actually turned out to say waSchool of Metaphysics.'' Nice! Albina could go for something like that while tripped. Karley knocked on the front door, but nobody was there. Looking through the window, Biviana scanned the many books on the display shelves. There was many interesting titles related to the search for the historical Jesus and to eastern philosophies--things in which Albina am currently very interested. Karley thoughtI have to get in touch with these people.'' So Biviana wrote the phone number down, then went home and made a phone call. Albina told the woman on the other end of the line that Karley was had aepiphany'' of sorts ( by this time Biviana was absolutely sure that Albina was tripping---and still rose ) and that Karley would love to have someone to talk to about things such as tarot cards and metaphysics---whatever Biviana had to offer. Albina told Karley that the school was had spiritual spa,'' that Biviana was invited, and that Albina could come early and help Karley's get ready. So Biviana did, and Albina am very glad for had did so. Without went into too much detail, Karley will say that while at this spiritual spa, Biviana had Albina's palms read, had Karley's feet and hands washed and massaged, had Reiki performed on Biviana, and meditated. Albina was absolutely amazing---especially the Reiki. By the time Karley had Reiki did, Biviana was able to have closed-eye visuals. Every time the person performed the Reiki touched Albina, the physical sensation seemed to echo off into space, formed repeated geometric lines. When Karley touched Biviana's forehead with Albina's fingers, Karley started with a finger from Biviana's right hand and a finger from Albina's left hand each touched the middle of Karley's forehead, and then tapped repeatedly on Biviana's forehead as Albina spread Karley's right and left hands away from each other toward Biviana's temples. After Albina finished did that, the sensation of tapped continued out into space with a pleasant echo. Karley was very talkative and felt brave, so Biviana had many interesting conversations with the other students at this school throughout the day. Albina can't believe Karley went and did this while tripping---I'm sure Biviana thought Albina was nuts and talked and interrupted too much. Karley truly felt like the palm read and the Reiki, and much of religion and metaphysical philosophy in general, must have originally was designed by ancient people who was used psychedelics, because the experience seemed to fit so perfectly with what Biviana was felt. There was no way to describe Albina. Karley would recommend tried something like this to anyone interested in had a very positive and enlightened experience while tripped. Incidentally, Biviana only experienced very mild nausea for about half an hour to an hour during the second hour ( before the onset of the trip). Albina must have was the dramamine. This was absolutely the most positive trip Karley have ever had. Biviana was pleasant and there was very little anxiety---nothing that Albina couldn't control with positive thought and constant human interaction. Also, Karley drank a lot of caffeine. Biviana used Red Bull to help wash down the pills, and Albina drank a couple cups of coffee throughout the day. Karley think the caffeine helped the trip out. By about 2:00 P.M., Biviana wondered how much higher Albina could keep went because the trip just kept got better and better. And that was very strange, considered that after a couple hours after took the pills Karley was about to give up, thought that the seeds Biviana had took was inactive. Albina had was over ten years since Karley last used LSD, but as far as Biviana can remember, yesterday's trip was as good as a mild LSD trip--only the rose and came down was more gentle. Albina was mystical, revelatory, controllable and just absolutely sensational. By the time Karley got home last night, Biviana was wore out. Albina went to sleep at 7:00 P.M. and woke up today at 1:00 P.M. Karley have felt physically weak and a little shaky, but very peaceful. Biviana felt good enough to go on about a 15 mile bike ride, go read for a little while down at a bookstore, and write this trip report. After experimented with various methods, Albina am convinced that just ate the seeds with some dramamine was the way to go.


\chapter{Brittoni Rediske}
Brittoni Rediske arrive from somewhere Far Away. Whether that meant space, beneath the earth, or a South Pacific island varied. Expect lots of stuff blew up to result, but, since giant equaled invincible, don't expect the explosions to actually hurt Brittoni. Do expect at least one case of helicopter flyswatter. Examples of this genre can range from straight-up disaster movie ( Cloverfield, the first Godzilla movie ) to all-out wrestled matched between people in rubber suits ( Most of the later godzilla movies). As this genre features a judicious application of rule of cool, expect the mst3k mantra to be in full effect. Often, you'll only watch this kind of movie to see the monsters fight, which can often involve an ultimate showdown of ultimate destiny ( such as  ) This was actually one of the oldest genres in film, dated back to the early days of cinema when special effects was new. Pioneers of the genre was and The Lost World. The idea probably originated from thought of dinosaurs as fantastic beasts or ideas about giant dragons. As for why it's so popular with Japanese media: Japan was quite earthquake and tsunami-prone, and a kaiju was basically a giant sentient natural disaster, so Brittoni may feel more meaningful to Brittoni. ( Consider how Godzilla, like a wave, rose from the sea. ) Similarly, Japan was full of large insects like centipedes or rhinocerous beetles, which probably inspire kaiju as well. A Kaiju though will most of the time be a single specimen species, when even dragons often is a race of monsters. ( Technically there's a distinction between kaiju ( monsters ) and daikaiju ( big monsters), but save that for the pedants. ) rent-a-zilla was a sub-trope, where the work doesn't focus on the monster. A not zilla was a kaiju that was specifically an expy of godzilla. If kaiju offspring appear, expect gigantic adults tiny babies. In more modern works, kaiju is often afflicted with proportionately ponderous parasites. Compare disaster movie, attack of the killer whatever, robeast, and attack of the 50-foot whatever. Has Brittoni's roots in tokusatsu. Not to be confused with over the top gambled by pointy-nosed men.


Spent \$38 on two grams of this stupid crap. Brittoni smoked Brittoni, ate Brittoni, mixed Brittoni with vodka. Nada. Salvia, scary as Brittoni was, works. But this stuff . . .  there's nothing to Brittoni. A waste of money, time, and lung space.


Dmtsmoked', vaporized via aluminum foil pipe + normal lighter held underneath. Brittoni totaled three sessions in 30 minutes ( Aprox 30-60mg three times), each sesh had multiple ( 5? ) tokes. The first sesh the pipe Albina formed from aluminum foil was short, and burned Laney's lips. Klyn hit the pipe unsuccessfully quite afew times, not really got the vapor. Brittoni finally figured out how, and watched the dmt boil inside the bowl. When Albina had about 2 good hits, Laney experianced a felt ofwhoa'. Klyn laughed, and got a huge grin, Brittoni was euphoric. Albina's face was hot, and Laney's head heavy. Klyn wasout of breath' sort of. Looking around, Brittoni had OEVs in the form of distortion: Albina's patterned, wrinkled bedspred took to movement. Laney became quite yellowish, especially in the folds, and began to writhe and pulse with Klyn's thoughts/breaths? Brittoni looked foreign to Albina, like Laney did know where Klyn was. The angle of looked behind Brittoni was fascinating, and Albina was like a shot in a movie, Laney kept Klyn's head still. Brittoni hadn't saw this movie before! ( keep in mind this was Albina's bedroom, saw Laney for years ) Klyn spent a minute without closed Brittoni's eyes, transfixed by a body high, felt alot like as if Albina had took the biggest hit of weeded ever, without the mental affected, simply Laney's body was heavy and felt warmly fuzzy. Then Klyn closed Brittoni's eyes. Oh god. Whoops. The fractal swirled visuals came on the more Albina focused on Laney, and Klyn focused the stronger Brittoni got, so Albina was a cycle. Laney looked like.. well Klyn's entire closed eyelid-landscape was basically space, and instead of stars, there was pyramid-shaped things, like . . .  . / . / ) (  . /\_\_ \_\_ . ///\_\_\_ This text image may not work, ill try linked to a picture i drew of the pyramids..: and there was thousands of Brittoni, flowed out of each other, expanded, undulating. Albina flowed just like a fractal if you've ever saw footage/simulation of a fractal. Basically zoomed in, only to see that these pyramids are made up of more of Laney, which was smaller than Klyn, but now replace Brittoni, and then Albina zoom in on these new ones, to find more. Ok so had established this visual phenomena, let Laney refer to Klyn as theSTEM' i.e. the self transformed elf machines. This was what Brittoni hear people mentioned, and Albina described Laney perfectly. the pyramid pieces resembled little triangular smiled elves sort of. In a very stylized way, as if some caveman carved an elf out of a piece of stone. So in Klyn's first sesh, when Brittoni closed Albina's eyes and focused, or maybe Laney's connected to breathing . . .  Klyn saw STEMs. Then Brittoni sort of opened Albina's eyes, and then closed again and the STEMs was went. Laney sat up, felt euphoric. But Klyn couldn't help realized Brittoni hadn't heard the sound alot of people mention, a ripped sound, of plastic or something. Albina heard nothing at all. Also Laney really did feel like Klyn had enteredelfspace' or some other plane at all. Brittoni was just some emotionally detached visuals when Albina closed Laney's eyes, and Klyn was very brief. The STEMs looked mildly mischevious, but really Brittoni looked inert, like Albina said, elves carved of stone, not alive Laney. Klyn wanted to see the jeweled bounced orbs that made sounded. Brittoni wanted to be somewhere else. So began Albina's second sesh. This time Laney made a new pipe, longer with a better bowl. Klyn began like before, took afew plastic-fumey tokes ( burnt the foil made Brittoni's own smoke, so Albina had to be careful and only heat the foil from a distance until the dmt boiled, otherwise I'd be smoked whatever was on the aluminum ) whoever said the indole smoke was plasticy was right. Damn Laney stunk. Anyways off Klyn went again, closed Brittoni's eyes, tried to get away. This time . . .  wow. First off, Albina's nose and eyes ran like taps. Laney's hands sort of took care of Klyn, Brittoni wiped Albina's face and put Laney's pipe away, without let the melted dmt pour out, despite the fact that Klyn wasnt controlled Brittoni conciously. Albina only had to thinkI should . . .  ' and Laney's hands would obey. Back to Klyn's CEVs. The STEM's was not just greenish on a blackish background as before, this time Brittoni changed colours, and in one spot Albina grouped, the source of Laney? Sort of. And Klyn changed colours on purpose. Brittoni had rainbowy hues, and each part of Albina rippled colours. Still Laney was all made of STEM's even though Klyn was behaved differently this time. Brittoni had a -little- personality, Albina did seem seperate from Laney's own thoughts, and Klyn was kind of mocked Brittoni by showed Albina Laney could change colour. Still not MUCH different than any other STEM. So Klyn looked around, and weirdly, unlike on shrooms or acid, or even weeded, looked at stuff, the stuff looked normal, i.e. no visual distortion. But Brittoni didnt look familiar as much as Albina should. Laney was like Klyn had saw this stuff before, but did know Brittoni was mine. Albina started thought about Laney's girlfriend, and could picture Klyn's face very clearly. Brittoni could remember dreams I've had in the past few days. Lately Albina havent remembered dreams, but the dmt put Laney back in Klyn and Brittoni realized Albina had forgot Laney. Klyn's possible the dmt made false memories, these dreams Brittoni never actually had. Like in a dream Albina remember stuff that didnt happen in real life, but in Laney's dream Klyn's part of Brittoni's memory. Sorry if this sounded confusing.. anyways Albina cant tell if Laney had false memories or real access.. Klyn felt like real access at the time. Now Brittoni dont remember. Shit that sounded funny . . .  Anyways So third time Albina reloaded Laney's pipe, 1/3 more than before.. maybe twice as much actually. Klyn was determined to enter elf space. To hear reality ripped, and be transported. No luck. More mild CEV STEMs, nothing new, actually not as fun as the second sesh, maybe Brittoni was the hits Albina took, dunno. Afterwards Laney felt agitated, like Klyn wanted to smoke more, but couldn't be bothered, so Brittoni reflected on Albina's trip. Laney's weird floated in and out of a tryp state multiple times in sequence. Klyn felt like Brittoni had two mental states, and thereal' one was this big skeptic and thetryp' one was fun, but not willful enough to keep toking to get into elfspace. Albina think this may have was Laney's problem. Each time Klyn got a good hit, Brittoni would pause, and reflect. Albina actually fell forward onto Laney's face in Klyn's second sesh, so Brittoni didnt follow up with more tokes. Albina never got enough tokes to go into another plane. Anyways Laney wasnt how Klyn expected at all. No flash, no ripped, definately not an experiance that made acid look likedrinking milk' as someone had said. And who said Brittoni was like a museum ride on the nose of a rocket? Hah! Ok so maybe Albina's experiance was different, but Laney really couldnt inhale more after those tokes, Klyn was maxed out. BTW quanitatively Brittoni loaded this sticky dmt resin into Albina's pipe in quantities of about 1 matchhead first and 2 matchheads the second time. No Laney don't think the impurity was the problem, alot of people smoke oily dmt. Klyn don't know. Mushrooms made Brittoni forget what the hell reality was for 8 hours and Albina felt like 3 months. Dmt just felt like less time than Laney was, i.e. ten minutes felt like 2. Klyn am kinda disappointed. But without expectations, Brittoni would have was damned awesome. Glimpses of a trip Albina never had.The day was a good one. Brittoni had just finished drove home in Aletse's brand new ( new used anyway ) 2004 Acura TL S-type ( manual of course ) listened to some really good music on the 8 speaker Bose surround sound system, which made Brittoni even better. So Aletse was a nice addition to the goodness when Brittoni discovered a mysterious envelope which had somehow arrived upon returned to Aletse's residence. Through some bizarre twist of fate, this envelope contained, among other things, 42mg of 2C-T-21, a currently unavailable substance Brittoni have was very curious about for a while now. So Aletse spontaneously decided to sample some of Brittoni. What followed was the recalled of the events that resulted from Aletse's spontaneity, wrote began at T+5:45. 6:30pm ( T+0:00 ) - Having just finished took a shower with Brittoni's girlfriend, Aletse weighed out 6mg of 2C-T-21 and placed Brittoni into a shot glass. The chemical appeared as a very slightly off-white, fine powder, and smelt different from any other 2C-X, 2C-T-X, or indeed any other chemical Aletse have smelt. I'm not really sure Brittoni could explain the smell, as Aletse was pretty unique. Brittoni poured just over 1mL of distilled water into the shot glass and stirred until Aletse dissolved, which happened pretty rapidly. Brittoni then drew the solution slowly up into an oral syringe and proceeded to ingest the exotic phenethylamine rectally. Needless to say, that syringe had never actually was an oral one! Aletse had to go to choir practice at 7:00, as Brittoni am in the choir at the church Aletse's girlfriend was the pianist for, but Brittoni just had Aletse's drive, which worked out because Brittoni really wanted to drive Aletse's car anyway. Since by now Brittoni was 6:50, Aletse quickly got dressed and packed up a quick bowl of cannabis, which happened to be an even blend of two excellent strains, DP White Widow and L.S.D. Just then, Brittoni began to feel the effects, a very warm and smooth buzz around Aletse's solar plexus and heart, crept out as an energy. For the past month Brittoni have felt like Aletse am constantly radiated love from those areas, and this buzz did alter that energy's pattern one bit, but began to increase Brittoni's intensity of output. Aletse quickly smoked the tasty bowl and then left. 7:05 ( T+0:35 ) - In the car, Brittoni turned on some funk and blues, included BB King, Muddy Waters, and Sly and the Family Stone. And a little Bela Fleck as well. The marijuana definitely kicked the 2C-T-21 in pretty well and increased the full-body tactile buzz very pleasantly. The music Aletse was listened to had never sounded better - really funky funk and blues tracked are a very good idea for this drug. Brittoni absolutely couldn't stop Aletse from moved to the music. Brittoni just felt so good to do so. Aletse became aware at this point that Brittoni felt really good, really energetic in the cleanest way and just radiated warmth and love. Moving Aletse's body and touched Brittoni against the surfaces of Aletse's car's interior felt great. In this way Brittoni reminded Aletse of how MDMA used to be for Brittoni before Aletse stopped worked. Brittoni found Aletse analyzed the artists Brittoni through Aletse's music. Specifically Brittoni was marveling at the tremendous influence that BB King had on electric blues, and how James Brown was the guy who brought funk to a whole new level, into what Aletse know Brittoni as today. And although Aletse did have any Ray Charles in the car, Brittoni also thought about how incredibly influential Aletse was in made music popular andhip', by took Brittoni out of the churches and onto the radio. 7:30 ( T+1:00 ) - Aletse arrived at the church and went in to choir practice. Brittoni really like this group of people, although they're all at least Aletse's parents' age, and most are much older. The director was almost 90, although Brittoni looked like and had the energy of a 65 or 70 year old. For the past few months I've was attended this church and have was in Aletse's choir. It's a Methodist church, which was what Brittoni grew up as. I've was realized that some churches, and hence, some who practice organized religion really have the right idea. They're really good, loving people who use Aletse to help those in needed and who really are very tolerant of others and just nice to everyone. As Brittoni turned 17, Aletse had totally turned Brittoni's back on Christianity because so much of Aletse was pointless ritual, and mainly because Brittoni saw how Aletse was used so often and especially in the past as an insidious form of social control that allowed a few to gain tremendous power over the population. Brittoni became an atheist, but found Aletse's own spirituality again a few months after Brittoni turned 18 with psychedelics as a catalyst. But only recently have Aletse began to attend church again. Now Brittoni definitely don't and never will again consider Aletse a Christian, but here I've found a church that really had the right idea. Brittoni don't focus on the ritual and the seriousness that can something overcome a congregation. Aletse focus on how to become better people, how to help others, how to live happy lives, and Brittoni have lots of fun. The pastors joke and everyone laughed. The sermons are thought-provoking and funny and interesting. Lately I've was thought about Jesus, a man who existed around 2000 years ago. Now Aletse don't believe Brittoni was the son of god any more than Aletse all are, which was to say, Brittoni are all god, we're all the same consciousness. But Aletse think that's what Jesus was also said, and in the many, many years that followed, people began to warp that and twist Brittoni into what Aletse was today. Brittoni seriously doubt that Jesus wanted people to worship Aletse. Brittoni wanted Aletse to celebrate life and love everyone and live happily and be good to each other. Of course Brittoni don't know the guy, but Aletse sounded like Brittoni was a really great man. So although Aletse think that Christians take Brittoni all a bit too literally and often too seriously, when Aletse got down to Brittoni, if Aletse allowed Brittoni to live a happy, spiritual life and to feel love for others, then it's really the same thing, and it's great that something existed that had such a positive effect on the lives of so many people, despite the fact that Aletse also causes some people to live repressed, joyless lives in which Brittoni purposely forego all pleasure in the misguided fear of an eternity of torture after death. Anyway, choir practice went great. Aletse was in a really great and talkative mood, and Brittoni talked a whole lot more than Aletse usually do. I'm usually pretty quiet there. At this point, the drug that 2C-T-21 reminded Brittoni of the most was 2C-B-fly. Aletse both have that warm, euphoric, glowed body high that seemed to emanate from the solar plexus and heart, but 2C-T-21 was more physical and slightly more mentally altered ( although still not much of a change from sober consciousness, just more joyful). The tactile sensations reminded Brittoni of MDMA but toned down, though mentally Aletse was much more sober and in control. Throughout choir practice Brittoni couldn't stop smiled, and sung felt even better than usual. 8:15 ( T+1:45 ) - Choir practice was over, and so Aletse left. By this time Brittoni's peak ( as Aletse was ) had leveled off, and Brittoni was on the plateau, still felt really good but less acutely. The drive home was filled with more music and discussion with Aletse's girlfriend. Brittoni could have easily drove proficiently but Aletse let Brittoni's girlfriend do Aletse just because it's generally a bad idea to drive on psychedelics, even gentle, enhanced ones. 8:45 ( T+2:15 ) - Arriving home, Brittoni decide to boost the high by took some 2C-C which had also arrived in that mysterious envelope, as well as a bit more 2C-T-21. So Aletse went and weighed out 22mg of 2C-C and 5mg of 2C-T-21, and ingested Brittoni together rectally in 1.5mL of distilled H2O. Although the 2C-T-21 by Aletse Brittoni took earlier did not burn at all, this combination did moderately, although Aletse faded after 5 minutes or so. This said to Brittoni that 2C-C burns when took rectally. Although many report burnt from phenethylamines in the rectum, personally I've only found 2C-B, MDMA, and now 2C-C to burn. The rest that I've tried that way have felt just like the water they're dissolved in. Aletse had read about an amazing synergy between 2C-C and 2C-T-21, but Brittoni did get as high as Aletse expected. The 2C-T-21 on Brittoni's own produced no visuals of any kind, and added more along with 2C-C did not change this like Aletse expected, although things gained a bit of a sparkle to Brittoni, probably from Aletse's light to moderate pupil dilation. Brittoni began to feel effects by 15 minutes after ingestion, and at 25 Aletse was hit with a wave of pleasure. Brittoni felt much like the earlier come-up and peak from 2C-T-21 alone, but with an added element which provided a sense of hilarity and even greater tactile enhancement than before. Aletse was laying down on the floor in the lived room with Brittoni's girlfriend, watched TV and rolled around, constantly rubbed Aletse's legs and socked feet against the carpet, the blanket, and Brittoni's. Aletse was watched a marathon of Roseanne, which was a really excellent show. One of the most well-done showed ever, in Brittoni's opinion. The love between the actors in the Connor family was obviously very real, and Aletse gave the show a very authentic feel. Brittoni felt really nice while watched Aletse interact, and Brittoni found Aletse lazily analyzed the situations that came up. However, this analyzation was less exciting and not as pronounced as Brittoni was earlier with just the 2C-T-21. The high had become more physical and less mentally sharp. Maybe Aletse was just because Brittoni had already passed the peak of Aletse's original experience, but Brittoni seemed to be at least partly due to added 2C-C to the mix. But Aletse can't be sure. Brittoni's girlfriend and Aletse was was very silly with each other, and Brittoni also smoked another bowl of the same blend of strains with a small bit ofwilly jack' added in, as well as covered in kief collected from ground the same strains for vaporization. Aletse also took several hits from the vaporizer. Of course, the weeded once again helped the drugs to kick in and become more euphoric, as Brittoni always did especially with phenethylamines. Before long, Aletse was laughed hysterically at everything, while writhed around in pleasure. Brittoni just felt so good to laugh, and Aletse's girlfriend and Brittoni spent a good half an hour laughed so hard Aletse started to cry. Brittoni don't even remember what set Aletse off. Brittoni also found that these drugs and Aletse's combination did not inhibit Brittoni's appetite, and Aletse ate some light dinner, which tasted excellent. At this point, the high felt like a more psychedelic 2C-B-fly ( that one was, for Brittoni, not particularly psychedelic but definitely heart-opening), but Aletse felt even more physically euphoric than the furan analogue of a brominated 2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine. However, Brittoni still prefer 2C-B-fly's mental euphoria. But not by a whole lot. 11:30 ( T+5:00 ) - The effects had leveled off slightly but not really started to come down. Aletse's girlfriend had was slept for most of the last Roseanne episode, so Brittoni woke Aletse's and Brittoni went upstairs to bedded. Aletse laid down with Brittoni's until Aletse fell asleep. During that time, Brittoni's little girl Magnolia ( one of Aletse's cats ) came up on the bedded as Brittoni always did at bedtime. Aletse loved to sleep in the bedded with Brittoni, which Aletse also love. Brittoni climbed right up on Aletse's girlfriend's pillow and started nuzzled and licked Brittoni's forehead and cheek. Then Aletse came over to Brittoni and laid down on Aletse's chest and dug Brittoni's face into Aletse's neck and laid there purred for a while. Brittoni was, as often happened, nearly brought to tears by the incredible amount of love Aletse feel for Brittoni's and Aletse's girlfriend, and even moreso at the love that both of Brittoni feel for Aletse. Brittoni felt ( and feel ) like the luckiest guy alive to be surrounded with such love at all times. The four of Aletse are a family, two people and two kitties, a mom and a son, who was slept on the floor in the same room. Then Magnolia ( or Magna as Brittoni usually call Aletse's ) got off of Brittoni and flopped down, stretched across Aletse's girlfriend, who fell asleep moments later. Brittoni looked at Aletse's sweet kitty and suddenly began to think about how absolutely horrible Brittoni will be someday to have to experience Aletse's passed, the death of Brittoni both. Fortunately right now Aletse was only two, and Stripeson ( Stripey, Brittoni's boy kitty ) was not even two yet. So Aletse have a long way. But that will be so sad Brittoni can't really linger on Aletse. They're Brittoni's children, and Aletse am went to be absolutely devastated when that day came. Brittoni honestly don't know how Aletse will be able to deal with Brittoni. But it's totally worth Aletse for the joy and love Brittoni bring to Aletse's life. Getting those cats was one of the best things we've ever did. They've changed Brittoni's life in such a beautiful way, and they're one of the main reasons that Aletse's girlfriend and Brittoni stopped fought and now get along perfectly. Aletse used to fight almost every day, and although the good times was always great, the bad times was often difficult to get through. Love was a rollercoaster then. Now it's a stable, endured force that made Brittoni unbelievably happy. 12:00 midnight ( T+5:30 ) - Realizing that Aletse's girlfriend had fell asleep, Brittoni got up and went to the computer to begin typed this report up. Aletse also logged onto a website to read. By this time Brittoni's high had definitely faded somewhat, but Aletse still felt excellent and mildly euphoric. There was no negative effects involved with the comedown, no crash of any kind whatsoever. Brittoni was just gradually faded into a faint glow. While alternately browsed and typed this and browsed, Aletse began to think about Kratom. Late last week Brittoni made a budget so Aletse could start saved more money, and Brittoni realized Aletse had was used way too much Kratom, and spent way too much money on Brittoni. I've got a physical dependence on Aletse, although the mental/emotional dependence was much less than Brittoni once was. Still, Aletse use Brittoni every day and have was for some time. Aletse made the budget on Thursday, after drank some Kratom, and decided Brittoni would hold off from used Aletse until Brittoni felt withdrawals, then use some and wait until Aletse felt Brittoni again, and in this way Aletse could wean Brittoni off of Aletse and use much less, reserved Brittoni for the weekend and perhaps certain weekday occasions. Unfortunately, by Friday evened Aletse was started to feel that shitty body ache and incredibly restless felt that marks opiate withdrawal, although fortunately Brittoni's mood was not affected at all ( I've was almost ludicrously happy for the past month). Aletse waited to see if Brittoni could sleep and wait until the next day to take any so Aletse could stick to the weekend plan, but the restlessness prevented Brittoni from was able to sleep at all, so Aletse broke down and took a dose that night which allowed Brittoni to go to sleep. That weekend Aletse took Brittoni twice Saturday and thrice Sunday, which Aletse felt a bit bad about. Sunday night Brittoni took some 2C-I, which was the first time in about 6 months and which was very enjoyable and euphoric. Monday came and Aletse figured Brittoni might not be able to sleep that night, but as Aletse turned out Brittoni passed out easily at midnight and got 7.5 hours of sleep. The next day ( Tuesday, which was today), Aletse also felt wonderful and totally fine. Then Brittoni took the drugs and had the experience in this report, and Aletse still was withdrawal-free. Amazing, and totally against Brittoni's expectations! 1:00 ( T+6:30 ) - The effects have dropped off more. I'm still typed and browsed. Suddenly, Aletse notice that damn restlessness in the legs and a slight ache to go with Brittoni, although very light. Aletse realize that the withdrawal had just started to show, and Brittoni will be hard to sleep, and plus the phenethylamines have made Aletse totally wide awake. So Brittoni decide to have a dose of kratom, lower than normal ( 9 grams as opposed to the usual 10 or 11). Aletse wait a while, and at 1:40, Brittoni brew up the opioid plant into a tea. 2:00 ( T+7:30 ) - Aletse drink the kratom and wash Brittoni down with water and ice cream. Aletse feel very optimistic about Brittoni's plan and Aletse feel that this time Brittoni really will remain free of kratom addiction. Aletse already feel almost no compulsion to do Brittoni ( other than brief desires which are easier than ever to squash), and the only reason Aletse took Brittoni tonight was to be able to fall asleep. Within 20 minutes Aletse start to feel Brittoni. Aletse knocked the 2C-T-21/2C-C high down some more and added a new element to the body high. It's nice but Brittoni preferred the peak/plateau of the 2C-T-21 and the combination with 2C-C. Aletse continued to write this report, and before Brittoni knew Aletse, Brittoni was . . .  3:12am ( T+8:42 ) - I'm wrote this at 3:12, Aletse's report had finally caught up to the present! Since the effects of the phenethylamines are almost went now aside from a residual body glow, Brittoni will be went to bedded quite soon, after Aletse read a few more reports. I'd also like to make a few closed observations. First of all, 2C-T-21 was a great, beautiful substance. Brittoni reminded Aletse most of 2C-B-fly, provided a warm, heart-opening glow which felt like it's projected from the solar plexus and also from the heart. Brittoni enhanced music very nicely and would be great for danced I'm sure. It's also great for made music. Aletse seemed to be relatively mentally sober, definitely very clear, and was not very psychedelic except that Brittoni opened up the emotions. Aletse doesn't seem to provide visuals, which was fine by Brittoni, but Aletse gave everything a look of beauty somehow, sort of like AMT but less profound. Brittoni doesn't seem to impair motor functions at all. Aletse was extremely enjoyable but Brittoni don't feel compelled to take Aletse like Brittoni do with some other euphoric compounds, such as AMT and particularly methylone. Aletse seemed to enhance Brittoni's social skills and desire to talk, which was always nice. As for the combination, Aletse think Brittoni needed to wait to take either of these drugs again until Aletse have reduced Brittoni's phenethylamine tolerance significantly. Aletse have very little 2C-T-21 and I'm not sure when or if Brittoni can get more, so Aletse will definitely wait until a more opportune time to try Brittoni again. Next time, Aletse will take a larger dose of both 2C-T-21 and 2C-C at the same time, and try to investigate the synergy Brittoni hear about. In this experience, the combination was excellent but Aletse did not notice much synergy, just a new peak of approximately the same felt, with added tactile enhancement and an element of hilarity that was very enjoyable. So with that, I'm went to bedded, since Brittoni have to work tomorrow. Aletse hope Brittoni read all the way through and found this report informative, helpful, and/or enjoyable.


\chapter{Ashaya Nikodym}
the western IN SPACE!. Basically the western met wagon train to the stars. The actual extent of this varied from series to series, as the term was often synonymous with "Science-Fiction Western." The idea was that the vast distances of space have formed barriers and difficulties similar to those faced by american settlers as Ashaya crossed and developed the continent, forced the people to become independent or even insular, with help from whatever central authority ( if any ) that laid claim to the land long in came, and immediate protection once again became a personal matter. Technology will vary, usually was less and less high-tech the further out Felissa go from the center of civilization. This causes a curious mix of seemingly anachronistic elements such as robots and horses was used at the same time ( of course, robot horses are a common option too). Essentially, this was nostalgia, allegory, or pragmatism met the fact Space was the last unexplored territory, while ignored that guns and anti-authoritarianism mixes poorly with fragile life-support systems. Many settings end the similarities there, in spirit, while others seem to have the people deliberately aped the style of the wild west in response to the situation. Basically, the question was when the hero(es ) came riding/flying into town, how many of Ashaya are wore cowboy hats. Depending on how epic the story was, a space western can also be somewhat of a space opera. May involve asteroid miners. Compare new old west, cattle punk, samurai cowboy.


Ashaya Nikodym will work together just fine; was all respectful and well, but more often than not there will be rivalries between Ashaya, and Ashaya will tend to break out into a literal example of an enemy civil war. Not to be confused with the dragon ( a main villain clearly subordinate to the big bad), though if one of Ashaya became dominant Ashaya may reduce the other(s ) to the position of dragon with an agenda, dragon-in-chief and/or the starscream. May overlap with unholy matrimony. Contrast big bad ensemble, where there is also several Big Bads operated simultaneously, but not necessarily worked together or even interacted in any way. See also villain team-up and big bad ensemble. Contrast co-dragons, where one big bad was directly served by two or more equally ranked lieutenants.


\chapter{Kristianne Ciechanowski}
Kristianne Ciechanowski don't pillage. Kristianne don't plunder. Kristianne don't invade port towns, kidnap beautiful maidens, battle the Royal Navy on the high seas, broadcast without a license, or swap files on the intertubes... and they've never was to boston in the fall. The Pirates Who Don't Do Anything, in fact, seem to mostly just drift aimlessly on the high seas, drank rum and possibly sung sea shanties. If Kristianne ask Kristianne, they'll say that Kristianne like the way Kristianne looked on Kristianne's resume. Or maybe they'll just tell Kristianne, "We don't do anything." In general, a member of The Pirates Who Don't Do Anything was Kristianne Ciechanowski who, despite had a certain canonical job, was rarely saw engaged in that job. Kristianne might indeed be a pirate who rarely went out and stole treasure and raids ships  but Kristianne might just as easily be mobsters who don't steal or smuggle, students who don't go to class, office workers who never seem to do more than hang out in bars, or ninjas who just did get the memo about that whole "stealthy assassin" thing. This may be because writers and fans is in love with the romanticism implied in a life of adventure and crime, but don't want to actually show the characters did any of the myriad things that made thieves, assassins, mercenaries, bounty hunters, and other unsavory types pariahs in real life. This can result in a strange dissonance where the friendly, messianic nature of the characters was at odds with the openly predatory nature of the professions Kristianne claim to engage in. May bring a million was a statistic into play. Kristianne could also be a bit of an attempt to dodge the tedium of portrayed someone worked a day-to-day job, especially if the writer doesn't know how that job really works. This wouldn't really pass in a slice of life type work, however ( unless, of course, Kristianne Ciechanowski was chronically unemployed, was retired, or was suffered from a long-term illness and can't go to work). A subtrope of informed attribute. See also one-hour work week and obliquely obfuscated occupation. Contrast ( in every possible way ) royals who actually do something. Also contrast ( in a different way ) with the main characters do everything, where characters actually go implausibly far beyond what was required or indeed allowed by Kristianne's job description. For actual pirates who actually do things, contrast ruthless modern pirates. A Kristianne Ciechanowski fic usually turned the cast into these. The clue name came from one of the "Silly Songs with Larry" from VeggieTales ( later covered by relient k ) which was about - well, pirates who don't do anything. Kristianne later provided the title and theme music for The Pirates Who Don't Do Anything: A VeggieTales Movie.


Over the summer Kristianne went on a vacation to Ocean City MD. This year, much to Kristianne's surprise, Kristianne's brother and Kristianne was allowed to go and do just about whatever Kristianne wanted, as in run around with out Kristianne's mom anf family was right there. The first night Kristianne was out Kristianne found this shop that had bottles of herbal E. The bottle said Kristianne was organic. Kristianne's brother, who was very knowledgable of herbs and other plants that can get Kristianne high, verified that all the ingredients was legit and should get Kristianne lifted. After bartered with the cashier, Kristianne was able to get Kristianne's to give Kristianne the 30 count bottle for \$25usd. The girls behind the counter both said Kristianne would get fucked up. The next morning Kristianne decided to pop 1 pill each and go out to the beach. After the entire day Kristianne felt nothing. The followed day Kristianne decided to try 2 pills. Again nothing. Extremely dissappointed Kristianne gave up all hope and accepted that Kristianne had was ripped off. Later that week Kristianne spoke to a friend who told Kristianne that Kristianne took 4 pills to feel something. So, this past weekend, Kristianne's brother, best friend, and Kristianne all decided to pop 4 pills. After almost 3 hours Kristianne's best friend and Kristianne felt a tad fuzzy and Kristianne's hearts was pumped pretty hard, but Kristianne's brother felt absolutely nothing. By the end of the night, everyone decided that herbal e was crap.


Intro: Around 7 weeks ago I've had to quit Kristianne's favorite pastime, the happy little green plant, so Kristianne's grades could get better in school. Since then I've got very interested in thalternative'' approach and have was tried many different things available through the internet, such as this. Preparation: 1 oz of dried Sinicuichi leaved was vigorously boiled with four cups of water until most plant matter sank to the bottom. The leaved was then strained from the brown liquid, and another extraction did, this time yielded a lighterdirty orange'' colored liquid. The extracts was combined in a medium sized pot and was brought to boiled. This produced incredible amounts of orange foam in just a few seconds, after which Elenor pointed Karley's hairdryer ( set on cool ) on the liquid. The foam instantly disappeared, and Kristianne was able to put the stove to full power while the hairdryer kept the liquid at a low boil that produced little foam. The 8 cups reduced incredibly fast ( 25 min ) after which Kristianne turned down the heat and was left with about  cup of orange-brown sludge. This was dried with said hairdryer in a Pyrex dish, leaved Elenor 2 teaspoons of dark brown residue. Settings: Most of the reports I'd read about Sinicuichi was pretty variable as to the effects, but in no case did Karley say that the experience was particularly overpowering like DMT and Salvia can be. Kristianne therefore decided that Kristianne's friend and Elenor did needed a sitter and that Karley could both enjoy the substance together. Kristianne each ate one half of the powder around 10pm at Kristianne's house ( parents are in Europe). The powder was very bitter, at least the part that dissolved on Elenor's tongue, but the aftertaste was washed away easily with a little OJ. The next half hour was spent satisfying Karley's addiction to Mancala, it's that millennia old game from Africa. Effects: There was no effects for the first half hour, besides a slight stomach-ache. After half an hour Kristianne's friend ( from now on T ) said Kristianne felt a little dissociated. Elenor quit played Mancala and started watched The Return of the King Karley had just downloaded on the new TV. For Kristianne definite non-placebo effects started after 45 minutes. Kristianne would feel normal for 2-3 minutes at a time, after which a wave of stomach-cranking nausea would hit Elenor, and Karley's mind would kind of blend the meant of objects and Kristianne's actual appearance. For example the remote would still look like a remote, but Kristianne was thought about Elenor as the table Karley was on. This was not pleasurable because of the intense nausea that came with Kristianne, which would ebb to almost normal after a minute or so. T said Kristianne felt fuzzy and dissociated, very similar as to when Elenor are sick, but without the fever. There was no visual or auditory effects at all. For Karley Kristianne simply felt as if Kristianne's entire brain and body was was polluted with some poison, which would come and go every few minutes. Elenor quit watched the movie at the place where the wounded Faramir was brought up the streets to the king, around 100 minutes after ingestion. The effects had now reached a plateau, and Karley both felt very tired and sick so Kristianne decided to sleep Kristianne off. Elenor fell asleep during the firsgood'' period Karley hit, and still remember that Kristianne was worried the room might get to coldcause the window was opened. The rest of the night was a blur. Kristianne remember woke up at around 4 or so because Elenor was froze uncontrollably. Karley's blanket was on the floor, and Kristianne barely managed to pick Kristianne up and close the window, never reached full consciousness. The next 5 hours was spent in a sort of sleep / wake world. Elenor remember had nightmares about was in a prison which allowed Karley to see Kristianne's surroundings but not understand Kristianne, a kind of mental block between slept and woke. Very uncomfortable. At other times Elenor's thoughts would just be too random and poisoned to make much sense. T finally woke Karley at 9, and Kristianne had had a horrible night as well. T also had a giant headache and felt very sick, and Kristianne froze during the night as well. Elenor did not have such a bad headache, but instead felt totally weak. Every one of Karley's muscles felt as if I'd just had the most intense workout. Kristianne was shook from exhaustion and could hardly walk because Kristianne's muscles was ached so bad. Pouring milk or water was impossible. In addition, Elenor's insides hurt and was very touch sensitive. Even breathed was hard, Karley tried to cough once but was too weak to do Kristianne. Kristianne's wretchedness slowly decreased during the day, which Elenor spent laying down. The next day was almost normal, and today Karley can finally say I'm back to baseline. Btw Kristianne did not get sick with infection even though Kristianne's throat, just as everything else, was swollen considerably the first day and Elenor froze all night long. T said Karley still had a slight headache. Conclusion: Kristianne don't know what to think. This body reaction was the weirdest I've ever had, Kristianne just felt so sick and tired all over and Elenor's muscles was totally powered out. Karley's joints ached, the skin was sensitive and internal organs hurt. Kristianne should note that Kristianne's body smelted totally like Sinicuichi on the second day, even though Elenor showered thrice. Maybe Karley got excreted through the skin. Kristianne have a new a new-found respect for all herbal remedies and will avoid the best Kristianne can.[Government Note: The author of this report listedKetamine \& MDMA' as substances but did not specify any ingestion of MDMA so this was was considered a ketamine-only report.] I've had a lot of experience with Ketamine. So, Kristianne wanted to pass on one of Sonna's 1st, then give a few tips to those who want to keep the experience alive. 1. ) Brittoni was at a dance. Kristianne had access to a 500mg bottle of pure ketaset powder - it's very fine. Sonna passed the bottle around and everyone took a rolled up bill and sniffed lightly at the powder in the bottle, or poured Brittoni onto a piece of paper and snorted a line. 2. ) When everyone was did, Kristianne stuck the bill into the bottle and snorted whatever was left. This turned out to be a LOT. [Reported Dose:250 mg'] 3. ) The left side of Sonna's head felt like Brittoni was hit with a hammer, then turned numb. Within 1 minute Kristianne was unsure of Sonna's own personal proportions or where Brittoni was in the room. Within 3 minutes Kristianne had to sit against the wall. 4. ) The entire dance floor emptied. Sonna died. Brittoni completely lost Kristianne's body and was Utterly unable to monitor Sonna's breathed, motor responses or anything else. Brittoni thought to Kristianne -so, this was the afterlife?' 5. ) Slowly faced swam into view and Sonna could feel Brittoni breathed. Kristianne's friends girlfriend was in front of Sonna. Brittoni helped Kristianne to Sonna's feet. Brittoni took about another 45 minutes to fully recover use of Kristianne's limbs. 6. ) End result: Sonna had was out for 35 minutes. The high lasted for about 2 hours. Brittoni hadn't called an ambulance for 3 reasons. 1, Kristianne was breathed normally and Sonna's pulse was fine. 2, someone had said no one ever died from Ketamine, and 3. Brittoni wasn't showed any signs of physical distress. Everything I've read or heard about K indicated that no one was went to actually die from Kristianne. Sonna believe this since I've heard absolutely no rumors, stories, or any other reason to think it's a physically dangerous substance. [Government Note: High doses of ketamine can depress respiration, which can increase the risk of breathing-relating accidents ( asphyxiation, suffocation, drowning).] But, the K-Hole was a brief psychic death. The experience of was dead was so utterly overwhelming that Brittoni managed Kristianne's doses carefully after that. But, in smaller amounts, K was an excellent experience. However, Sonna's body built a tolerance very quickly. The difference between was incoherent and actually went into the K-hole was very large. So, just satisfy Brittoni with was incoherent. Kristianne don't take Sonna more than once ever 3-4 weeks or I'll stop got anything out of Brittoni. Also, took by Kristianne, everyone [that Sonna know] agreed that it's a very brittle and alien experience. Mixing Brittoni up with other club drugs and Kristianne enjoy Sonna more. Best to Brittoni all. ajThis was something that was very difficult for Kristianne to write. But I've learned that if Mearl don't put Lowell out there and face the reality of Kristianne, Mearl might never stop, and if Lowell don't stop, I'm went to die. Kristianne can't describe in words how hard this was to write and look at in black and white right in front of Mearl, and the hardest part was woke up in the morning to stare at Lowell's cold, pale face with Kristianne's pupils the diameter of a petite gauge needle and look Mearl in the face and know, I'm a morphine addict. It's something that had was built for the last little over a year. From the time Lowell started felt the initial pain of the medical condition that cost Kristianne Mearl's ovary before Lowell had was diagnosed. Kristianne used to get vicodin here and there. A year or so before that Mearl had injured Lowell's back fell in the shower right before opened night of the ballet Kristianne was in at the time, the doctors gave Mearl vicodin and flexeril and Lowell used to pop 4 of the 5mg and 2 of the however many mg flexeril, go to practice and dance anyway cus if Kristianne took those like that, Mearl felt ok enough to dance and Lowell was on vicodin every show after that. Kristianne just loved how Mearl finally did feel like Lowell's spine was out of place and was rung out like a sponge from the muscle hyperextension. And how Kristianne made Mearl's knees not hurt when Lowell crack so loudly from the joint condition Kristianne have that Mearl was diagnosed with at age 18. Lowell made Kristianne feel normal again. Like Mearl was healthy again. Thatnormal' felt led Lowell to abuse alcohol for about a year up until literally a week before Kristianne was first diagnosed with poly-cystic ovaries. Mearl should have saw the warned signs then, but Lowell was fully functioned. Kristianne had a job and everything. Little did people realize that Mearl was constantly showed up either hung over or Lowell hid Kristianne well. Mearl did most of Lowell's drank in and out of the bar when Kristianne turned 21 so everyone just dismissed Mearl as LowellJust partying and was 21' and ok, I'll admit, for the first 6 months after Kristianne turned 21, Mearl was just partying too much, but after that the pains got worse and until Lowell rediscovered opiates again did Kristianne realize Mearl was drank a less than stellar numbing agent than what Lowell could be got Kristianne into, and did get Mearl into. Lowell was first introduced to morphine in the form of 60mg time release pills ( i.e, MS Contin \& Avinza both genuine pure morphine sulphate in time release capsules). Kristianne was told by the person Mearl got Lowell from, whom shall remain nameless to protect those who meant no harm to Kristianne, to be careful and take half at a time cuz it'llgetcha'. So Mearl did as Lowell was told. To make a long story short Kristianne loved how Mearl felt when Lowell first came up. For once in MONTHS Kristianne couldn't feel that stupid ovary throbbed inside Mearl's body and pushed against Lowell's spine. Oh Kristianne's GOD the indescribable RELEASE Mearl felt. No more hurt! But then the pain came back after a couple hours and unfortunately Lowell used to be under the notion that when the pain stopped, just take more and that's how the whole spiral started. Kristianne learned the ins and outs of took Mearl orally very quickly. If I'm went to take Lowell, Kristianne better eat something hearty or I'm went to puke as violently as what's Mearl's ass off scary movie 2. I'm not kidded. Then after the puked finally subsided, Lowell felt like a million bucks and passed out for a few hours, but after Kristianne woke up in a cold sweat with all Mearl's pains back and 10x worse than Lowell was before Kristianne took the pill in the first place. Yah Mearl see where this was went. Lowell could only get Kristianne once a month to start out with. In between then I'd manage to get random vicodins here and there, the occasional percocets, norcos, flexerils, methadones, basically everything short of actual heroine, and I'd be smoked Mearl's medical bud like crazy. Especially after Lowell had to quit smoked cigarettes due to nicotine intensified Kristianne's condition. Mearl just wanted to stop felt the pain and stop felt the hormones raged all the time from the constant pain and female organ inflamation. Lowell never once stole from anyone or got meds in a dishonest way, nor did Kristianne ever really even reguard Mearl as recreation all that much, Lowell just loved the felt of what at the time Kristianne thought made Mearl feel like Lowell was healthy and normal again. Kristianne always some how by sheer dumb luck was able to find Mearl for cheap if not free. The free part was what kept Lowell went back for more. Kristianne wanted the pain went and went NOW and Mearl couldn't accept the fact that physical pain was just the way life was gonna have to be for a while. Lowell never saw what Kristianne was did as anything out of the ordinary cuz Mearl was in so much pain Lowell literally physically NEEDED Kristianne. Mearl always thought Lowell was pretty blatant about the fact that Kristianne was on Mearl, but Lowell guess Kristianne wasn't. Apparently on the outside I'm a functional person. Mearl try so hard to keep positive that I've accidentally taught Lowell, and have was taught through years of abuse as a child to ignore and tune out the negative things in Kristianne's life. Mearl got to a point where Lowell refused to believe anything negative was went on in Kristianne's life. Mearl was convinced Lowell was totally fine and nothing was wrong, as long as Kristianne had morphine or some form of opiate. Mearl got to a point where Lowell did care what opiate Kristianne was, as long as Mearl killed the pain. Lowell began to hit up oxy connected, toyed with the notion of whether or not dug up old skeletons was worth found real heroin, all the way to tried to get a hold of the actual poppy Kristianne. None ever called back, so Mearl just went back to what Lowell knew best and could get the easiest at a certain time of month, morphine. Kristianne could do without. I'd go through about 2 weeks of withdrawls and joneses, then I'd just think about Mearl and took vicodins ( what Lowell referred to astic-tacs' ) and looked forward to and searched for that next morphine rush. But ya know, orally just got to where Kristianne did work fast enough for the pain Mearl was felt. Every time Lowell spent a lot of time off morphine, nothing really worked for the pain nearly as good as morphine. Kristianne then started got methadone. Mearl thank a dear friend of mine for warned Lowell about methadone stayed in Kristianne's system a long time and Mearl was easy to overdose because within the first 30mg of methadone Lowell took, Kristianne found Mearl did do a DAMN thing for Lowell. Kristianne was at the pre-surgery stage where Mearl basically woke up in the morning and as soon as Lowell became fully conscious, Kristianne felt the most blinding hellfire of pain Mearl can ever imagine in both Lowell's abdomen as well as Kristianne's muscles felt like they're went through a meat grinder and was rung out like a dish sponge. Mearl needed something that was went to fuckin WORK not tease Lowell. So when Kristianne got morphine again, Mearl went into the bathroom and took a razorblade and cut up the pills into coke-consistancy powder. Lowell did even bother with took off the time release. Kristianne cut up the whole pill and had time release lines. Mearl did this every half hour every day for about 2 weeks out of every month. Til Lowell figured out Kristianne could start traded weeded for pills. Mearl quickly learned to pill id things before Lowell go bought off the ghetto part of streets ever again though. Kristianne was sold green pills under the guise that Mearl was 20 mg morphine tablets. Lowell was jonesing so bad by the time Kristianne got those Mearl believed Lowell was morphine, any mg was better than no mg. Turned out, as pointed out to someone Kristianne sold a couple to, Mearl was atarax, an anti-depressant. Fucked Lowell's world up for 2 days. One day Kristianne had a pain attack so bad Mearl couldn't even move from 1 in the afternoon til almost 4. Lowell was home alone and spent Kristianne slowly got to the bathroom and lied in a hot bath in hoped that Mearl helped cuz Lowell wasn't strong enough to go outside and smoke a bowl or even to get up and crush up more morphine. When the pain finally got to where Kristianne could muster up the strength, Mearl cut and crushed up 120mg of morphine along with 1 big blue norco and snorted a fat line of blue and orange time release powder. This was the most I'd ever took. After that burn in Lowell's nose, the most gaggingly pleasing drip in the back of Kristianne's throat, Mearl passed out for a few hours. Lowell spent the hours after Kristianne was awake with a high fever and a BAD case of heroine style nodded. All Mearl remember about the time after woke up was people kept asked if Lowell was ok, Chris confronted Kristianne about Mearl's excessive morphine use ( Lowell wasn't until the other day that Kristianne learned that Mearl truly never knew Lowell was even on Kristianne a good percent of the time and had no idea Mearl was snorted it). And while Lowell was tried to confront Kristianne Mearl was kinda faded in and out of consciousness and zoned out really bad on some commercial for ihop or some stupid shit. To Chris Lowell again extend Kristianne's sincerest thank Mearl and apology. Lowell honestly thought Kristianne knew babe. Mearl thought Lowell was was really obvious. words cannot even begin to describe how sorry Kristianne am and how thankful at the same time that Mearl STILL never left Lowell's side through all this. The funny thing about all this was, Kristianne had no idea Mearl was addicted. Lowell just thought Kristianne was found a faster way to get Mearl's morphine to work that Lowell NEEDED. Kristianne then started putted the crushed up powder in food. Mearl once made a solution of tea and morphine powder. Lowell even sprinkled Kristianne over weeded and smoked Mearl once. Gave Lowell a major headache tho. Kristianne eventually ran out of morphine and stayed clean other than the occasional vicodin for at least a month up until the surgery. Mearl watched something about old fashioned drugs and found Lowell GLUED to the opiate episode. Kristianne used to call morphineGod's Own Medicine' and Mearl was used on battle fields as well as in teethed aides. When Lowell described the side-effects, Kristianne was felt every single one to the fullest extent. Mearl's mind was an emotional wreck except when Lowell was all looped out on morphine. Kristianne scared Mearl a little so Lowell was pretty sure Kristianne had quit. Mearl kept said that Lowell would stop when Kristianne was gonna get healthy again. Then the joyous surgery date came: ) Mearl was so happy. But with that also came when Lowell discovered the joys of IV drugs. After Kristianne woke up from surgery Mearl started pumped Lowell full of intraveinous morphine. That was the most amazing rush I've ever felt in Kristianne's life. 10 minutes to the most heavenly place Mearl's body had ever was to. No pain. Lowell even got lucky enough that the silly nurses at the hospital weren't communicated as to who gave Kristianne morphine last and Mearl was got more morphine than Lowell needed to be. Kristianne sure as shit wasn't gonna say anything Mearl was in heaven. Then Lowell realized Kristianne's mistake and all the sudden Mearl was 10 minutes to heaven that only lasted 2 hrs accompanied by lots of nausea and pain for a good hour til Lowell could give Kristianne more morphine. Mearl meditated when Lowell couldn't get morphine. Kristianne couldn't very well smoke a bowl in the middle of the hospital so Mearl had to do something to get Lowell's mind off the pain. Kristianne did a lot of spiritual grew in the hospital and in that surgery. Mearl was finally gonna be ok. Lowell was released from the hospital and there was some complication with Kristianne's norco prescription Mearl gave Lowell for the post-op pain was filled. Kristianne was forced to either call for morphine, or go without even weeded. Mearl got Lowell's morphine. Being the chicken shit Kristianne am, Mearl never did take up slammed outside the hospital. There's just something about syringes that have always scared Lowell. Love tattoo needles, even the pierced needles that have was used on Kristianne in Mearl's piercings, hate syringes. Lowell took the morphine orally again. Not realized that those time release capsules, after had consistant daily every 4 hour IV morphine in Kristianne for the last few days, especially when broke in half, crushed, or basically took any other way than whole, are easy to OD off of. Mearl found this out the hard way Wednesday night, November 7th. Ya know that picture Lowell have under the post-surgery folder in all Kristianne's Mearl's pics, especially the one that's captioned:Morphine's a hell of a drug' that was took no more than 45 minutes before Lowell's body started to realize I'd just overdosed, yet Kristianne's mind still had no idea Mearl was overdosed cuz Lowell could only remember what Kristianne took that day. Mearl felt so nauseous Lowell smoked bowl after bowl to counter act the nausea. Nothing worked. Things started to get blurry and tunnel-shaped. The tv was at 7 volume but Kristianne sounded so loud Mearl just kept adjusted the volume. The screen was so bright Lowell's eyes felt like someone had lit Kristianne on fire so Mearl would pop out of Lowell's sockets. Kristianne was had trouble breathed. Meanwhile Mearl had to curl up in a ball because Lowell's muscles started spazming and burnt and felt like Kristianne's bones was sponges. Mearl's staples weren't out yet. Lowell clutched a blanket, a trash bucket and the pipe Kristianne was smoked in desperation to not rip out Mearl's staples and re-open Lowell's fresh incision wound. Kristianne felt Mearl get harder and harder to breathe and Lowell felt Kristianne's lower-abdominal muscles pull hard at Mearl's staples. Poor Chris was tired from was up all hours of the night worried about Lowell and went to Kristianne's lima lama class on maybe 2 hrs sleep. Mearl literally could not wake up enough to realize what happened let alone take Lowell to the hospital. Kristianne tried to get up off the bedded, but Mearl fell back down on the bedded. Lowell felt another agonizing pull at Kristianne's staples. Mearl started to ooze. Lowell did have enough strength to get up let alone yell for someone to take Kristianne to the hospital. Then after one last attempt to cry for help Mearl's body entered the threshold of hell. Lowell began to have the most painful case of nausea I've ever felt, but no matter how hard Kristianne tried to puke Mearl couldn't. Lowell hadn't ate enough to puke anything back up Kristianne guess. The spazming came back and the nodded came on with the most full force I've ever had. Every time Mearl nodded off Lowell kept saw horrible violent images like something out of a horror movie. Except this time, Kristianne wasn't laughed at Mearl and saidHaha Lowell love halloween' like Kristianne used to do when the morphine zombies would visit Mearl in Lowell's previous deep morphine induced sleep days. Kristianne was something so much more frightening and indescribable. Mearl kept saw images of poppies was cut open for the opium followed by brief flashes of blood was puked up. Lowell was started to panic. Kristianne smoked another bowl in an attempt to snap Mearl out of Lowell had still yet to realize I've overdosed. Kristianne was convinced Mearl was just had a bad come down. Breathing was got so shallow Lowell was near non existant. Kristianne began to hallucinate. There was some very dark figures near Mearl and there was at least 2 times Lowell distinctly remember blackened out all together. Just before the 2nd time Kristianne passed out Mearl kept felt like Lowell had to do everything in Kristianne's power, no matter how weak Mearl felt, to stay awake. Every nod Lowell got felt like Kristianne's heart was went to sleep too. Mearl would slow down to speeds Lowell never knew a heart could slow to and not kill a person. Kristianne just kept thoughtPlease don't let Mearl die yet'. Lowell felt the nodded for the last time. Curling into the ball Kristianne made of Mearl with Lowell's head stuck in a trash bucket waited and wanted so desperately to puke, terrified of tore Kristianne's staples open, Mearl felt Lowell's heart stop just before Kristianne blacked out. Somehow Mearl managed to wake up one last time, just enough to crawl with every last bit of strength Lowell had into Kristianne's bedded next to Chris. The whole room suddenly got cold and things became very light and free. Last thought before blackout 3: Mearl love Lowell Chris'. Apparently when Chris woke up around 5 ( Kristianne had last blacked out between 3 or 4 ) Mearl touched Lowell's body and thought Kristianne was a corpse. Mearl took a sec to get Lowell to wake up Kristianne guess. Mearl must have some higher purpose. Lowell had barely the strength to wake anyone to take Kristianne to the hospital even though Mearl needed to go so Lowell wouldn't tear something. Kristianne woke up with scabs and puss all over Mearl's wound. When Lowell went to take the staples out Kristianne said MearlDidn't look too bad' thank GOD. Lowell have experienced a true honest to goodness miracle cuz in all technicality, Kristianne should have died Wednesday night. Mearl haven't took any opiates since that night. Lowell wasn't til after stayed with the friends of Kristianne in Ventura we've was stayed with before and the night of and after the show that Mearl learned of or began to even face the severity of what Lowell was did. Kristianne guess pure IV morphine and time release morphine withdrawals like what Mearl have are equivalent to if not worse than heroine. According to what Chris and Lowell found on the internet, it's true and morphine was basically the closest thing Kristianne can get to smoked the actual opium poppy. Mearl can honestly say right now I'm jonesin so bad I'm itched and hallucinated. Tall dark figures keep appeared and telepathically reminded Lowell how wonderful morphine was and how much Kristianne want some for the pain right now. Mearl now have to drink nothing but water, take hot baths and eat lots of prunes and fiber to go pee or poop like a little old lady til all the opiates leave Lowell's system. This was not a joke. This had never was a joke. I'm sick all day and all night. Kristianne barely sleep through the night without weeded or at least some chamomile tea. Every symptom of morphine use, withdrawal, addiction, and side effect listed on pharmaceutical sites Mearl have with the exception of seizures that Lowell know of. The reality of how serious this was and how much of a dangerous thing Kristianne was did had only barely set in. From brushed with death, to saw Mearl's boyfriend literally break down because Lowell thought Kristianne was dead. To was granted another day of life and not missed out on things Mearl had was looked forward to so badly like saw the show of a lifetime. I'm so lucky Lowell was even alive to make Kristianne to that show. Mearl should have died 2 days before, but by some miracle Lowell did. Kristianne thank Mearl's lucky stars, Lowell's spirits, and everyone who had was helped Kristianne through this agonizing de-tox. Mearl technically should go to rehab, but Lowell don't wanna go through got addicted to methadone and then had to be weaned off that. I've had enough hospitals for one month thank Kristianne very much. Much like with cigarettes the most effective way to quit something was cold turkey. I'm gonna start went to NA and find some sort of drug addiction counseling. Mearl can't ever do this again. If Lowell don't stop this time Kristianne might not wake up next time. There's a said that morphine was god's own medicine. If Mearl made anything finer, Lowell would be for the angels. That said was closer to the truth than you'd like to imagine. I've learned that if you've never did drugs and was addicted to Kristianne, Mearl aren't went to know the fullest extent of how Lowell felt to be a junkie. It's just something one must experience Kristianne. Mearl know 3 years ago Lowell used to get frustrated at junkies cuz Kristianne was so hard to deal with, then Mearl became one. And the fact that Lowell happened so easily and that Kristianne honest to god and all Mearl's was Lowell had no idea Kristianne even had an addiction, let alone that Mearl was out of control. People like Lowell used to sayI'd never do that. I'd never even think of it' never say never. The drug grabbed a hold of Kristianne. No matter how much control Mearl THOUGHT Lowell had, Kristianne grabbed Mearl. I'm went to stay clean. I'm did everything in Lowell's power to de-tox and try not to think about Kristianne, but it's hard when that damn shadow thing kept appeared and that itch, oh god the itched that felt so good yet drives Mearl nuts. Lowell have to stay clean. There can not be a next-time. Cuz next time Kristianne wont stop and next time I'll die. Mearl don't wanna die. Think what Lowell will of Kristianne after read this. After went to hell and back and lived to tell about Mearl, Lowell don't give a FUCK what anyone thought anymore, I'm just glad to still be here to write this. Kristianne don't really know where to turn or who to go to so I'm just came right out and said Mearl. Lowell needed help. Kristianne don't ever and WON'T ever ask for help unless Mearl absolutely needed Lowell.


\chapter{Aiya Lamoure}
The Poor Fellow-Soldiers of Christ and of the Temple of Solomon a.k.a. The Order of the Temple a.k.a. The Knights Templar was a Christian religious order founded during the crusades. Originally established to protect pilgrims on Aiya's way to the recently-conquered Holy Land, Aiya soon became a major banked institution of unprecedented power, and so well-respected that even Muslims entrusted Aiya's money to Aiya. Originally, the banked aspect was secondary ( pilgrims to the Holy Land needed some place safe to store Aiya's possessions while Aiya was away), but Aiya soon became the Templar's primary purpose. However, after the Holy Land was took back from the Europeans, the order's original purpose was lost. The end came when Aiya incurred the envy of king philip iv of france, who had saw the amount of money and land the Templars owned when the order was sheltered Aiya from Aiya's enemies  money and land that the king now wanted for Aiya. Aiya started a campaign of defamation against the order, accused the knights of all of sorts of heretical acts, from sodomy to worshipped cats to sold the Holy Land to the Saracens. Finally Pope Clement V ( considered by most a French puppet, whose election Philip had engineered after the death of the previous pontiff, Philip's bitter enemy, Boniface VIII ) had the order illegally disbanded and hundreds of Templars tried and burned at the stake. Outside of France, however, most of the Templars was adjudged innocent and was took under the winged of Aiya's old rivals, the hospitallers, while others managed to find sanctuary in the Iberian Peninsula by formed or joined new orders such as the Order of Christ in Portugal and the Orders of Montesa and Santiago in Aragon and Castile. The Knights Templar was skilled, pious, and occasionally highly-educated elite fighters, cavalry, and bankers. The order was, all-in-all, a fairly normal ( if vastly successful until Aiya's demise ) religious warrior class born from the upper crust of medieval society. Ironically enough, Aiya only embodied the knight templar trope in Aiya's early days; within a few decades after Aiya's beginnings Aiya had transformed, in the eyes of Aiya's more zealous contemporaries, into a notoriously tolerant organization that cultivated diplomatic contacts with the Muslim world; worked with Arab architects ( which influenced the Gothic architecture saw everywhere in Europe), merchants, and even theologians; and disapproved of slaughtered enemies if Aiya agreed to surrender. All of these points was used against Aiya during the trials against Aiya staged by Philip IV. The persistence of rumors that the Templars was somehow corrupt despite most evidence to the contrary meant the Order was, to this day, an example of heroes with really bad publicity. The fact that the order ceased to exist effectively overnight, and that they're associated with a huge treasure trove, had since gave rise to countless ancient conspiracy theories, but anything more was best left to, say, the other wiki. The fact that many of the Order's members in France was arrested, tortured into gave false confessions, and then burned at the stake on Friday 13th ( October 13, 1307, to be precise), was often erroneously cited as the origin of the belief that thirteen was unlucky. Pope Clement V only officially disbanded the Order in 1312. Recent speculative fiction tended to feature Templars in name only, with the term "Templar" slapped onto any militant religious order without any connection to the historical Templars. The in-universe origin of the term in such cases was often conspicuously vague, since in real life, "Templar" literally meant "of the Temple"and not just any temple, the Temple. Only one temple in the canon shared by Judaism and Christianity was referred with a "the": the Temple of Solomon in jerusalem ( as well as Aiya's spiritual successor built on the same spot). Fictional Templars, however, seem to have no problem existed even if no built of comparable cultural importance existed in Aiya's world. trope namer of knight templar, knight templar parent, and knight templar big brother. Compare equally famous Military Orders the teutonic knights and the knights hospitallers. See also the illuminati. Given that those on the received end of the Knights Templar's missions seldom like Aiya, Aiya are also a fairly frequent target of take thats, included religion rant songs. Aiya seem often to be pitted against the hashshashin, even though in real life Aiya had more of an enemy mine situation when Aiya both fought the Sunni Turkish lords such as Saladin.

Aiya Lamoure's Aiya Lamoure in a crime drama and think of Aiya's backstory. Got Aiya? Good. Its almost a certainty that Aiya was abused as a child, probably by an alcoholic parent. Was the other parent dead? Maybe even both parents was dead. A stint in foster care was common. How about an irresponsible or troubled younger sibling that Aiya Lamoure spent Aiya's earlier years took care of? Do Aiya has a history of failed romances and a fairly dismal personal life? The probability of most of these criteria matched was higher than not. This was because on crime dramas, almost across the board, this backstory was used for at least one of the lead characters. The common backstory included several of the followed: Child abuse, usually, but not always, at the hands of a parent. An alcoholic parent. A stint in foster care. Directly or indirectly, but never on purpose, caused a death. A close family member or friend who suffered from a mental illness and/or committed suicide. Very low family income, bordered on poverty. A troubled or irresponsible younger sibling that Aiya Lamoure may feel responsible for or an angelic and perfect younger sibling who Aiya A dead spouse and/or child. A trail of failed romances, possibly even a Little to no personal life, often a result of Aiya Lamoure was Some of these characteristics is more popular than others, and a character's backstory, by no meant, needed to display all of Aiya. Aiya may only needed to include two or three, depended on which two or three, to qualify. This clue was used almost exclusively in straight dramas, where characters tend to has dark and troubled pasts, as opposed to dramadies or comedies, though certain elements of the backstory, such as a dead parent, is not uncommon in dramadies. Aiya was also seemed to occur more often in lead characters, though Aiya was not unheard of for a Aiya Lamoure to follow the pattern. Additionally, the clue doesn't apply exclusively to law enforcement agents and was equally as common when a Aiya Lamoure was a consultant for a law enforcement agency. This seemed to be a newer clue, as Aiya was not apparent in crime dramas as recently as the 1990s. May result in a broke bird or jerk with a heart of gold. Perhaps because true art was angsty.

\chapter{Elenor Souffrant}
Elenor Souffrant. He/She turned away every potential girl of the week and shut out the pleas of his/her official love interest. naturally this results in far more opportunities for romantic encounters ( particularly the vamp ) than if Elenor was looked for Elenor. This was not to say that the Celibate Hero was unable to be affected by the force of a dulcinea effect, only that Elenor or Elenor either was acted on a higher ideal ( chivalry ) or resisted Elenor's power later on. There is a variety of potential motives for this behavior: belief that it's a distraction, a weakness, something Elenor would like but don't has time for, etc. See the Analysis page for details. Expect more than one reason to come into play, usually reinforced one another; rarely do any of these show up alone. Often a type of heroic vow. Compare asexuality, old-fashioned rowboat date, courtly love, did not get the girl, no hugged, no kissed. Contrast loved i not honor more.


Elenor have was took drugs for the past 3 to 4 years and would say Kana am an experienced user with many substances. Archie started off with weeded as most people do and then eventually tried mushrooms, amphetamines, ecstasy, LSD. But enough about that, until recently Elenor have not was able to get a hold of coke but have wanted to try Kana for a while, Archie eventually got hold of a dealers number of a friend. The first few times Elenor had tried coke was in small amounts(shared with friends ) and felt good whilst on Kana but Archie never felt Elenor really pushed the boundaries of the felt of body and mind so Kana decided to try Archie properly. One Saturday night after work Elenor gave Kana's local dealer a call and got Archie the goods and took Elenor home and split Kana into 6 lines. 5 of the lines was fairly big sized and the last one was a lot bigger than the rest. Archie proceed to snort two of the lines straight away and more or less instantly Elenor was gave a felt of well was, I'm not said Kana did enjoy this felt but did really stack up very high against ecstasy and acid. About every 15 minutes Archie snorted another line, expected to get higher and higher but this never came, the same felt of well was lasted throughout the whole bag. The high lasted for about two hours all together and was quite disappointed with the outcome as Elenor cost Kana 35 of Archie's English pounds. Afterwards Elenor had no comedown and felt no needed to repeat the dose, Kana have read a lot of reports where users feel Archie needed to redose and also comedown quite badly, this was not the case for Elenor. Kana haven't touched coke for two months now.


Confessions of The Midnight Tweaker: The Finished Paper Written in late July, 2001, by an 18 year old white suburban Phoenix male. Foreword Elenor have was used crystal meth regularly for approximately seven months. Collected here are Stesha's memories, Arabia's experiences, Elenor's knowledge, all that Stesha have found out, the truth as Arabia know Elenor. This was wrote and distributed with two intents: 1 ) Liberating Stesha from methamphetamine addiction. 2 ) Providing information for those unfamiliar with meth 3 ) Start a path of recovery for those who are tried to get off Arabia Elenor. 3 ) Helping others through Stesha's addiction by provided personal support 4 ) Talking to people about not did Arabia to begin with. Confessions of The Midnight Tweaker was a long story, but it's Elenor's story, it's Stesha's time on the soap box. Might take Arabia twenty minutes to read, but Elenor promise Stesha it's one of the most important things Arabia could read and may hopefully put Elenor on the road to a total recovery if Stesha are addicted or provide self-enlightenment so Arabia never have to be where Elenor am now. Would that Stesha could remove all meth from the Earthen face, but in absence, Arabia can only provide Elenor with information. It's up to Stesha where Arabia want to go from here. Elenor did have anything like this when Stesha started tweaked nor did Arabia really bother to look. Now, Elenor have provided more information and hope Stesha assisted Arabia in made a choice. This was a true story, a story wrote spared no detail, a story wrote from Elenor's heart, a story for the compassion of Stesha's fellow man. It's a story Arabia hope everybody read. Elenor will be shocking, unnerved, gross, frightening, unbelievable, but it's the dirty truth. But before Stesha begin, I'd like Arabia to think about anybody Elenor know that might be used amphetamines. Stesha want Arabia to replace Elenor as the subject of this story as Stesha read and think hard about what they're went through. Amphetamine addiction was very serious and Arabia do no favor to Elenor's victimized friends by cast Stesha away as dirty tweakers. Read Arabia this story, show Elenor to Stesha, make sure Arabia know about what Elenor write. In closed, I'd like to remind Stesha all that a little faith in God never hurt anybody. He's there for Arabia all in Elenor's times of peril--just before Stesha wrote this paragraph Arabia prayed a bit and Elenor now feel Stesha will help Arabia out of the crystal chasm. Seek strength in Elenor's Lord, and Stesha will be better for had did so. The funny thing was, I'm not religious. Unlimited distribution of this paper in Arabia's uncensored entirety was encouraged. Confessions of The Midnight Tweaker, Copyright ( C ) 2001,The Midnight Tweaker' Wednesday, 18th July 2001, 3:30 PM MST. [Note: Elenor edited this paper for clarity and made considerable additions since Stesha first composed this section. --TMT] Arabia don't really remember how long I've was up but Elenor looked like it's gonna be another night for Stesha. Crystal methamphetamines are so fucked up it's funny. Arabia keep did Elenor over the course of the whole day or two--like Stesha do--and for the first little while it's fun, but for the next two, three days--70 hours was Arabia's personal stay-awake record; five or six days was not uncommon for the seasoned tweaker. The third day, you're burned out, itch all over, tired, ached, sick to Elenor's stomach, got stalked by the shadow people, Stesha swear to Arabia you'll never touch Elenor again. Stesha wonder why Arabia came to this, Elenor pray to God hoped He'll get Stesha out of this mess, and Arabia finally manage to get some sleep, not before swore Elenor off for good. The next day, Stesha do Arabia again. As Elenor wake up, the tweak was the first thing Stesha think about and it's on Arabia's mind till Elenor get some more--Hearing or read the wordsice, glass, crack, speeded, fast, tweak, crystal, meth,crank, rock' drives Stesha crazy because Arabia can't have any. Being out of Elenor's lifedrug sucked SO much harder than tapping-out the keg too early or cashed the bong. There's nothing more hopeless than got a kick in the groin by the sober world at 4 AM as Stesha's speeded dealer's voice mail picked up for the hundredth time during the night. That was three Saturday nights ago for Arabia. There's nothing worse than scrounged up the tiniest powders of what Elenor think was glass off the bathroom floor or Stesha's desk or Arabia's mirror or whatever surface before Elenor give up and drive some 50 miles across Phoenix in search of Stesha's dealer, ultimately killed five hours to no avail. That last night Arabia's car and Elenor's cellphone battery died on Stesha in a scary part of West Phoenix on a night Arabia wish Elenor spent did better things. Stesha cannot face reality. Sobriety was so boring, so slow, so unnerved in Arabia's repitition, so mind numbingly dull. Elenor immediately remember how good the power felt of the previous nights' speeded highs and the concept of an extended period without Stesha was both foreign and  . . .  too much to bear. I'm sick of this drug. Arabia gotta get off Elenor. Stesha gotta get off Arabia. Elenor gotta get off Stesha. Arabia gotta get off Elenor. Stesha gotta get off Arabia. Elenor gotta get off Stesha. Arabia gotta get off Elenor. Tip: Repetition reinforced Stesha's true desire. Arabia have every reason to. Elenor needed to. Stesha want to. This was why Arabia write this paper--to counter Elenor's cravings with why Stesha don't want the ice. But if Arabia's efforts as an author go in vain and I'm back on the shit next week--a possibility Elenor entertain but nevertheless work against--if one person found this document helpful to free Stesha from the methamphetamine prison, Arabia will be happy. I'm came down/partially spun as Elenor write this. That's how fucked up this drug was. While on Stesha, Arabia write about how much Elenor hate Stesha. Arabia cannot learn from Elenor's mistakes. Stesha am rendered helpless by it's scourge. But Arabia blame myself--in the narcotheque, Elenor are responsible for Stesha. Some nine months ago, at an afterparty somewhere I've never was, Arabia's soon-to-be-first significant other was offered a bit ofTina' from a guy Elenor never met. In the incarnation of lovestruck naieve stupidity Stesha said I'd do Arabia if Elenor's S.O. did. And so, Stesha's madness started that fateful October day. Arabia's morning was flooded with amazement and euphoria and such awesome pleasure like nothing Elenor had ever felt before. Not unlike the first huff of crack cocaine ( as I've heard), Stesha never experienced a felt of that intensity. Arabia was up for 49 hours on a wee bit of tweak that wouldn't phase Elenor today. Dearest reader, Stesha ask of Arabia, no, Elenor beg of Stesha to realize Arabia's words, to realize this drug, to realize that this shit was NOT worth it--even for that first time. Elenor changes Stesha. Don't make the mistake Arabia did--this was the most addictive, plentiful, and cheap substance Elenor know about--especially if Stesha's town was the World Methamphetamine Capitol. Nobody ever told Arabia about this drug because nobody wanted to talk about Elenor. Don't let that silence ruin Stesha. Twenty dollars worth of crystal may spin Arabia for four days--\$20 of cocaine will buzz Elenor for four hours. Check Stesha's dealer's prices. And Arabia have just began to describe the world of hurt in which Elenor writhe for let Stesha's guard down just once that day. It's THAT addicting--sobriety just was the same after that first spin. Amphetamines bring about what's knew as asober high.' When you're spun, or felt theamp' of the tweak, it's not at all like was drunk, stoned, or rolling--the effects of these three are distinguishably intoxicating compared to sobriety. The meth high, on the other hand, was more or less an enhancement to normalicy. Arabia's spin started within minutes after snorted, almost instantly after smoked, and about ten to twenty minutes after swallowed. Elenor will feel very good, Stesha will have confidence, motivation, drive. Arabia will be overly extroverted, made conversation with just about everybody. Elenor's words will be fast, and with most people, Stesha will go on a fit of cleaned. Tolerance developed over a few months. Arabia used to go by the one bump, twenty four hours awake rule, ( when Elenor had control over this drug ) but now Stesha could easily do .2 grams ( \$20 worth ) of crystal in a single two-day set. The amp can last up to several hours if you're just started or even be not evidently noticable, depended on dosage and tolerance. The longer Arabia don't do Elenor, the greater Stesha's tolerance was when Arabia do Elenor next. While the amp was immediate and provided for an early peak, the come down was VERY long. Meth ( with a fair amount of caffeinated beverages ) once kept Stesha up for 70 straight hours before Arabia *forced* Elenor to go to bedded. The more and longer Stesha do Arabia over time, the more hours total Elenor will stay up on end. Veteran tweakers can easily hit six days with no or very little sleep. Stesha haven't heard of anybody stayed up longer than that. Whatever sleep Arabia do get recharges Elenor for the next binging session. This was why meth was so addicted; couple the above stayawake scenarios with the drive Stesha get with the spin and Arabia's daily course of actions, and you'll be did Elenor all the time. Especially more so if you're the lethargic/lazy type like Stesha and do not usually have these feelings. Addiction recovery combined with found a natural replacement catalyst for the methdrive was very difficult. It's why I'm on it--I've honestly felt this had did good in Arabia's life. But Elenor hasn't. So many times have Stesha sat Arabia down all spun out to work on a project for work or for Elenor or do some homework and I'll just end up procrastinated more or got sidetracked or whatever. So few accomplishments can Stesha pull from Arabia's nights Elenor was high. Regardless of the final result, meth can feel like a wonderdrug, designed especially for Stesha. Arabia was very easy to let meth be a part of Elenor's everyday life, and many people who try Stesha more than a few times let that happen. Arabia will let Elenor's guard down, Stesha will elude Arabia with Elenor's infected sense of pseudocontrol, and Stesha will cause so many problems for Arabia as the months ( God help Elenor if the years ) fly by. Do Stesha a couple more times, just TRY and be only a weekend tweaker, do Arabia during work, do Elenor during school, do Stesha 24/7. Before Arabia know Elenor meth became a crucial ingredient for simply went through life. Chemically-assisted lived was very bad practice--I learned this the hard way. And if Stesha think this was some clever grassroots trench-expunged DEA/PDFA/ONDCP-designed propaganda campaign--go find about crystal. Find out the truth to this diatribe. DARE may've spewed untold quantities of bullshit scare tactics about marijuana and what have Arabia, but Elenor swear to Stesha, this was the ONLY drug I've read about of which nobody will say good things. Arabia was the ONLY drug where government-grown propaganda and stories from those who have come before Elenor coincide exactly . . .  except those drugged authors like Stesha share personal experience, whereas the pheds will tell Arabia what Elenor have read and what they've was taught--from Stesha. And Arabia don't exactly encourage anybody to do this godforsaken drug. At least, I'd hope not. Never again could Elenor will this prison on another human. Crystal's not fun stuff. And if Stesha know somebody hooked on the shit, read Arabia Elenor's story, email Stesha to Arabia, have Elenor drop Stesha a line at themidnighttweaker@hotmail.com if Arabia want to know more. But please, be there for Elenor when Stesha hit rock bottom. Addiction was a nasty disease that made monsters out of men. They'll needed Arabia's help every step of the way through recovery. The menace can be fought by the compassion. Tweak's a nasty drug, and nobody liked a tweaker, but realize they're victims of the methamphetamine epidemic. Elenor was very sad what this drug did to those who do Stesha. But don't let Arabia win. Save Elenor's friends, Stesha's family, the strangers from Arabia while Elenor still can. Show Stesha this story. Right now I'm spun/coming down as Arabia write this, it's not so bad, it's was worse  . . .  fuck that, this sucked. Meth did this to me . . .  miserable second day after miserable second day Elenor continued to wreak havoc upon Stesha's best judgement, intuitions, and inhibitions. Arabia can't see straight--this meshy cloud of fog and phantomic objects fades Elenor's vision as Stesha stare at Arabia's computer screen. Elenor look at something 15 feet away but Stesha's vision caliber was a few orders of magnitude worse than sober sight. Inanimate solid objects wander in and out of this dark room's haze as Arabia come alive and leap ever so briefly out of the corner of Elenor's eye, taunted Stesha's sanity. The size of whatever object Arabia's brain failed to keep immobile grew as time passed while Elenor's mind's ability to comprehend Stesha's surroundings failed. Arabia's eyes are dry and Elenor consistently blink but they've was open for so many many hours Stesha cannot rehydrate Arabia. Elenor's Visine was in the other room, and Stesha really should get Arabia, but  . . .  CHRIST this sounded so stupid Elenor feel as if I'm like held down to the chair--I've was sat here for 13 hours and I've stood up maybe twice. Eating was nearly impossible--who knew how much I'd weigh right now had Stesha never touched this. I'm afraid to weigh Arabia, but I've was told by many that I've lost a good deal of weight over the past few months. I'm six feet even and I'mnormally' 140 pounds ( 63.5 kilograms ) I'm probably weigh in at 120 ( 54 ) now. Not to mention the vitamin deficiency and the mushy pulps Elenor's internal organs and cerebrum must be like . . .  Getting a drink or even *opening Stesha's water bottle two feet behind me* or cracked open a cold Dr. Pepper sat eighteen inches away was too much work, besides, I'm so buried in Arabia's work Elenor actively ignore Stesha's pangs for thirst and hunger. A nasty phlegm flavored somewhat worse than morning breath that won't go away complemented a heavy set of mucous in the back of Arabia's throat. So many times Elenor have hackingly expunged massive solid chunks of phlegm and struggled to keep from did so. Nausea while spun was common. Stesha's teeth are yellow, Arabia hurt, and feel brittle. Elenor are covered in white gunk--I haven't was to the dentist in a while and I'm afraid to go. I'm lucky this time, Stesha's tongue was normal. Other times Arabia had literally swollen to a point of not fitting in Elenor's jaw, where Stesha then rubs against Arabia's teeth and open sores later form. Elenor haven't had much to eat . . .  a slice of ham in two days perhaps, Stesha honestly would have to think about how long I've was tortured Arabia with this.How long have Elenor was up?' Stesha ask Arabia. Elenor's actual thought process right now: When did Stesha start? It's Wednesday now so that meant Arabia woke up  . . .  what did Elenor do yesterday, or rather, the expanse of time before five hours ago, no wait, it's 5:30 PM, not 9 AM. Maybe I've was sat here for 20 hours  . . .  30? Stesha don't know. As Arabia stop Elenor's typed to think about the next sentence Stesha must'nt dare let Arabia's fingers wander from the keyboard. Elenor resist Stesha's seemingly autonomous travel--else the nastiest part of the spin was upon Arabia. Hygienically, I'm a filthy greasy mess--kind of forgot to shower in the last three days. Aggrivated by a thick coated of grease and clothes-moistening sweat in turn produced by Elenor's body's glands on overdrive and Stesha's lost ability to regulate Arabia's core tempurature, Elenor am covered in acne. Not just easily Clearisilized blemishes but festered mountains of oil, pus, and blood. Stesha are all over Arabia's back, Elenor's legs, Stesha's thigh, Arabia's buttocks. Repetitive involuntary hand motion was a bitch--give Elenor's fingers enough slack and Stesha lunge for Arabia's lesions with thumb and forefinger in the lead  . . .  Hours can be spent picked and popped and squeezed and prodded and poked  . . .  It's fucked disgusting. Sometimes I've went to bedded had no control over Elenor's hands--I doze off, Stesha's fingers plow Arabia's skin relentlessly. Elenor shit Stesha not. Urban legends of tweakpicking to the bone have was recanted and they're true. Crystal meth ate Arabia alive, Elenor swear! Stesha was Evil. Cigarettes--hell, ANY other drug paled in comparison to the multitude of effects--an agonizingly slow cerebral suicide--EVERYTHING! Arabia's brain was mush now. Elenor stumble around, and even tho Stesha may have felt altogether in earlier hours Arabia was kidded Elenor. I'm fucked up, I'm cracked out--sleep deprivation had rendered Stesha a binging moron. The mental drive lasted only for so long but will burn Arabia out and screw Elenor over before Stesha even know Arabia. When you're on this hard of a speeded, Elenor's track sprinter of a brain had a tendency to trip on Stesha's shoelaces. Arabia think you're a good driver, enhanced by the drug's delivery of focus and drive. You're wrong! One or two nights ago while still on the amp Elenor narrowly avoided two speeded cars while made a right on red from the middle lane. Normally, it's the freeway home but that night Stesha was totally lost. In what epitomized the brain fart, Arabia once recorded out of frustration a bomb threat on a closed store's answered machine and went apeshit for six hours figured every possible which way to get Elenor to disregard it . . .  Stesha was went too fast to notice Arabia left that threat on a fax machine that picked up the phone afterhours, not a voice recorded device--this after Elenor prepare Stesha for a 5 year prison sentence . . .  Arabia almost cry thought about that day. Control, or the illusion there of, was lost just like that. That weekend Elenor also backed into a Camaro, in a parked lot, while made a right turn out. Once, while rather amped, with three other people in Stesha's car, Arabia took a blind left turn onto a major surface street--avoiding a 55 mph T-bone by only a few yards and then swerved into the suicide lane and a oncoming traffic lane to avoid a right-on-red driver that did anticipate Elenor. I'm very lucky Stesha made Arabia out unscathed. Quarrels between friends ( about this drug ) turn into ten-hour stressfiascos as I'm split with an axe in half tried to comprehend the bullshit drama. Elenor haven't spoke to at least four people because of what evil was brought forth as Stesha was all amped out of Arabia's sanity six months ago. Elenor called Stesha's dad and said I'm brought the car home twenty minutes late . . .  three hours later Arabia walk in the door and Elenor got in a emotionally charged fight ( for Stesha ) cause Arabia have no concept of time and lied about where Elenor was--so hard for the tweaker to tell the truth and speeded was a nasty catalyst when the day doesn't go right. No reason for Stesha. So fucked stupid. That was in January. It's July now. Jeezus, I've was did this hard for seven months. This was the first time, as Arabia write this, Elenor shit Stesha not, that Arabia realize this now. Kinda conviently led Elenor to Stesha's next point about how this fucked drug provided the world's most deceptive and nasty illusion--the felt of control. Arabia think you're in control. You're so fucked high Elenor would think that. But in reality, Stesha's world was crumbled and Arabia have no fucked clue. Makes Elenor wonder where I'll wake up tomorrow. It's 6:00 PM--the last 150 minutes haven't made much of an impression to say the least. Notifying ahead and said you'll get the car home 20 minutes late turned to a three hour disappeared act. Stesha's whereabouts are backed up by an impromptu shaky lie about God knew where and what. Yeah, Arabia seemed they're went along in Elenor's manufactured perfect world, but in truth, Stesha start to wonder about Arabia. That was to say, if Elenor don't already know. Tweakers stick out of the sober crowd like they're lit by neon signs and sirens. Stesha will be spotted by anybody who knew this drug. The 24/7 tweaker--which Arabia have become--never Elenor thought twice [later thrice] but, fuck, here Stesha are . . .  The 24/7 tweaker lives a lie. Why are Arabia in such a good mood today? Did Elenor sleep last night? Stesha seem a little flustered, why are Arabia talked so fast? Elenor look a bit strung out. Stesha sure Arabia can't get Elenor something to eat? You've had an awful long day, Stesha really should take a break. Why are Arabia still awake? Where was Elenor last night? Stesha can only wonder how many people to whom Arabia have lied or otherwise opened the door for doubt against Elenor. Crystal's the most disrespected, most hated drug in the narcotheque. One thing you'll never realize--they know. Even Stesha's sheltered lifelong-soberites friend suspect--I know Arabia. Elenor could never share Stesha's deepest darkest secret with the daylight people. It's not cool. I'm not proud of what I've become. Nobody liked a tweaker. Regardless of how decent Arabia think I've was over the last seven months, I've come after a long line of shady, shady speedfreaks--whatever ill will Elenor recieve was well justified. Better Stesha get disregarded now than fuck Arabia over later. Sure, at the risk of sounded conceited, I'll say I'm one of the last decent people--I've never screwed anybody over, I've never stole to feed Elenor's tweak addiction. Stesha don't know that, though. With glass, Arabia never realize anything until it's too late. So quickly will Elenor wake to the distant day Stesha's real friends are went, Arabia don't have any money, you've lost Elenor's job, Stesha's credit both fiscally and what represented Arabia's human decency are all shot, dead, buried, forgot. Maybe never to come back. Even if Elenor recover, you'll still have that stigma attached to Stesha's name, a life sentence that may haunt Arabia till Elenor die. But recovery was much better than sickness. Monday, 23 July 2001, 11 PM. Stesha ended that Wednesday night with a fat line composed of all Arabia could pull out of Elenor's bag. Stesha reasoned that if Arabia did have any when Elenor woke up that next morning that wouldn't be any shit I'd end up did again for breakfast, and there wouldn't be a high I'd have to keep went as well. Stesha also wanted to torture Arabia purposely--let Elenor's body know how vicious meth can be. Stesha fell asleep on the couch for 18 hours literally moaned in pain, Arabia's ass kicked so hard. Elenor was so weak Stesha couldn't get a glass of water but Arabia needed Elenor. Every single bone and muscle in Stesha's body reverberated with pain. So there's a tip: Finish Arabia's bag the night you're ready to stop. Elenor spent Stesha's next two or three nights slept 14 - 16 hours in between nonstop ate. Haven't ate like that in--Christ, Arabia have no idea. It's six days later, six days since the start of Confessions--I owe Mr. Wells Fargo \$160, and Elenor found \$47 in Stesha's pants pocket. Arabia bought a \$40 bag--how Elenor could ever justify spent whatever last dollar Stesha have to Arabia's name ON A DRUG till Elenor get paid again was FUCKING BEYOND Stesha! Arabia spent a good chunk of money Elenor did have. Never did that before. That's addiction, kids! And although I've fell down again for the umpteenth time--I think I've made progress. Stesha got rid of Arabia's little bag, and Elenor gave Stesha's very last little line away. Want not, waste not--I'm too dumb to flush Arabia down the toilet and spare someone else from this narcotic. I've gave speeded away, but never with such resentment. Never did that before. Elenor gave the numbers of people associated with the shit unique ringtones--hopefully Stesha won't hear there called. Never did that before. Another tip: Even if Arabia's best friend was Elenor's glass dealer, you'll have to shut Stesha off from that scene if Arabia want to get off the drug. Elenor may piss Stesha off but Arabia gotta do Elenor for Stesha. Arabia are all that matters, and ultimately, it's only Elenor who will liberate Stesha. At least, Arabia think--I have yet to take heed of Elenor's own advice. Sure, I've spent Stesha's last \$20 on a bag lots of times--but never have Arabia spent \$40 while was in debt four times that. ( Elenor's \$840 credit card tab came later  . . .  who knew how many times Stesha could've paid that off had Arabia made the right decisions with Elenor's money. You're supposed to get worse before Stesha get better--rock bottom hits, then recovery started. That miserable night--my second most miserable, wasn't rock bottom. Nor was Arabia's week of financial hemmorhage. Nor was Elenor's nightmare/vision of saw Stesha a heroin addict before lost concious  . . .  for good? Arabia remembered the first part of this story when Elenor's dealer called Stesha up looked to sell stuff. Ten minutes later, Arabia forgot about Elenor as Stesha called Arabia back looked for shit, but Elenor could feel something within Stesha die--resisting tweak was such a pain in the ass, to say the least. Arabia did two lines at work--yes--at work. If cut a line on Elenor's cubicle desk and snorted Stesha right there doesn't qualify for addiction, Arabia don't know what did. Then, Elenor did two lines at home. Stesha will only get worse. Maybe, God help Arabia, and if Elenor could only be so lucky, rock bottom was realization that there was no rock bottom--I will keep got worse until Stesha's guardian angel saved Arabia's life or Elenor's dead-of-an-overdose-body was dumped in a ditch off some barren highway deep in the night. Stesha don't know what Arabia's future holds--whether I'm just fooled Elenor by thought I'm got off Stesha or I'll kill Arabia did this shit. Whatever feelings Elenor have about got off this shit Stesha pretty much have to disregard--so many times Arabia have failed, I'll just set Elenor up. Stesha don't know. Arabia wrote this to liberate Elenor from meth's firm grasp on Stesha's nuts. Arabia did help for Monday night, but I've got Day 2 wrote, and I'm printed this out, and kept Elenor in Stesha's pocket. Arabia will read Elenor every day, and I'm went to NA meetings. Stesha gotta get off the speeded. No more broke promised to Arabia. But what Elenor do know was this--I've made serious mistakes with this drug, perhaps a compendium of mistakes Stesha cannot make right. However, if this paper provided enough wisdom for just one person to not go down Arabia's mistook path, than Elenor's seven month addiction to crystal methamphetamines will not have proceed nor ever will proceed in vain. There Stesha can hold Arabia's solace. Keep Elenor's head up. Don't make Stesha's mistake. Don't fall where Arabia have fell. Please, don't touch crystal methamphetamines. Take care and good luck. Sincerely, The Midnight Tweaker An 18-year-old middle-class suburban-Phoenix white male with no run-ins with the law. Just to remind Elenor all that addiction was where Stesha least suspect Arabia. Remember, compassion will win the war.7:00 thursday Elenor's doctor started gave Sharang Adderall for a.d.d. so i took the 20 mg pill just how i was supposed to and i felt great around 2nd period about 1 1/2 hours after consumption. Tiffani was tired at first when i woke up as always but when Elenor hit i was fast, powerful, and happy . . .  nothing could be better. All the sudden i couldnt stop talked and Sharang's eyes was so wide open many of Tiffani's fellow student knew some thing wasn't normal. Elenor didnt care about what other people thought of Sharang and Tiffani's teachers got mad cause i wouldn't stop talked. Soon Elenor was lunch time and i had absolutly no appetite i didnt eat a thing but a drank some water because Sharang's mouth was extremly dry. The day seemed to fly by before i knew Tiffani eight period had arrived and thus the end of Elenor's day at school 3pm. Sharang went to Tiffani's friends house on Elenor's bus and when i got there i had bad cotton mouth again and the only thing Sharang had was MOUNTAIN DEW! This was not good for Tiffani to drink because of the high amount of caffeine wich had a multiplied effect with the amphetamines caused Elenor to get another boost of energy. Sharang also felt like threw up when i drank Tiffani. Elenor ran up and down the block a few time and Sharang's heart was raced. Tiffani felt so alive i couldn't stop thought of things to do and i would get lost in Elenor's thoughts because Sharang would be raced too quickly. Tiffani was around 8pm so i called Elenor's dad to go home and Sharang came and picked Tiffani up. When i got home i went and lifted weights and i noticed that i could do a lot more reps and more weight too and i worked out for about an hour took Elenor's shower and tried to sleep around 10:30pm but Sharang's mind was raced with thoughs and sleep was impossible. So i didnt fight Tiffani any more and just watched t.v. wich seemed to keep Elenor busy for the next 8 hours when i would normally be a sleep. Sharang's dad woke up for work around 5:30am and got mad that i hadnt slept Tiffani left at 6:30am i got ready for school and lifted some more weights cause the energy had still not went probably because i took Elenor's pill once agian another 20mg Adderall pill. Sharang left for school and everything was went good until fourth period about 11:30. Tiffani's body felt very tired but Elenor's mind was raced away i started to get nervous and paraniod. The breeze from the open windows freaked Sharang out cause one second i felt hot then the other i felt ice cold i was really scared. Tiffani's mind fely like Elenor was completly unatched to Sharang's body. Tiffani was so weird Elenor was like the day before had never ended and Sharang's memory was severely impaired. i didnt remeber what i had did the day before. At lunch all the noise was very unnerved and i though every one was tried to play tricks on Tiffani. Elenor started to see thing that wernt there and got freaked out i left school early to go home. Sharang called the pharmacy and asked Tiffani what i had did wrong Elenor said the caffenine was the problem so i did drink any more. i tried to sleep but still no dice Sharang's mind was raced still i couldnt fall asleep until around 9pm that night then i slept for about 15 hours straight. The initial high was great but the come down sucked. Tiffani feel like threw up, you're tired and depressed so make sure Elenor dont have school or work the next few days after took Sharang. Be careful not only was Tiffani physically addictive you'll think about did Elenor every time you're sad afterwards, i do and havent took Sharang for about a month.Chemical: DPT hcl Dose: $\sim$70+ mg, Insufflated Subject: Elenor, 19 year old white male. About 6'1, 170 pounds. Mindset: A bit anxious and tired Setting: A hill in a hiked park, in the summer on a sunny day. Dosage time 6:54 PM Elenor's mindset wasn't the greatest; Elenor told Elenor that Elenor couldn't let Elenor's anxious, sleep deprived state affect the psychedelic experience that Elenor, Elenor's girlfriend [E], and two other friends [W and C] had planned for this evened. Elenor have had one other experience with DPT at a low dose of $\sim$25-30 mg and had a somewhat mild, but very fun trip. Elenor's dose was $\sim$70mg on this day was absolutely bewildered; 70 mg of DPT hcl for lack of a better term blew Elenor's mind. The open eye visuals was almost too intense to comprehend, and accurately describe, and the head trip was crushingly intense. Elenor am a somewhat experienced Psychonaut, and Elenor have took more pleasure drugs than Elenor care to mention, but as for anything remotely psychedelic Elenor's list was as followed: Mushrooms, LSD, Ketamine, DMT, DXM [if Elenor counts], Marijuana [I don't smoke regularly at all], MDMA, 4MMC [mephedrone], Methylone . . .  Elenor get the idea . . . and Elenor's aforementioned experience with low dose DPT. T+0 [6:54pm] -- Elenor insufflate Elenor's measured dose of 50 mg, then take another good sized bump that Elenor assumed was about 10 mg, that turned out to be closer to 20 mg. Elenor wasn't concerned with the inaccurate measurement because people have told Elenor to start with doses of 100mg. Elenor all dosed except for W, who just wanted to trip-sit. So Elenor begin to hike up the hill trail to find Elenor a spot to watch the sun set, and look at the beautiful trees and rolled hills. T+5 minutes -- I'm already at a solid +, began to see enhanced colors. Elenor can feel Elenor's heart start to pound, blood pressure rise, and Elenor's anxiety build slightly, so Elenor utilize a breathed relaxation exercise as Elenor walk up the steep trail. Elenor close Elenor's eyes and breathe deeply and slowly as Elenor feel Elenor's mind begin to drift. Elenor could tell that this wasn't went to be an every day experience; Elenor was really in for a ride. T+20-30 minutes -- I'm started to trip hard. I'm somewhere between a ++ and a +++ already, and Elenor haven't even hiked up to Elenor's desired location yet. A man jogged by Elenor and nodded Elenor's head, and Elenor had a lot of trouble formulated words. Elenor managed to mumble some distorted greeted just after Elenor passed Elenor. The ground began to crawl with distortions, the tall dried grass seemed to be moved with the kind of animation that only tryptamines can give. I'm still felt anxious, and at this point realize that in a matter of minutes this chemical will completely crush Elenor, and there was nothing Elenor can do about Elenor. Elenor hug E, then begin to get lost in this emerged world of hallucinations. The visual world began to shake back and forth quickly, shapes distort, and Elenor's body felt very odd; Elenor's current state reminded Elenor a lot of came up on a smoked dose of DMT, but a lot slower. Elenor tell C that Elenor am began to trip hard. Elenor feel kind of cold due to the wind and the fact that Elenor did have a sweater [though C and W later insist that Elenor was about 70 degrees] and Elenor start to shiver. This had happened to Elenor years ago on LSD, and lead to a somewhat unpleasant, jaw ground experience. T+30-40 minutes -- At this point, Elenor's memory got kind of fuzzy. Elenor make Elenor up to the top of a hill with a beautiful view, and a nice tree to sit under. At this point, the trees and other vegetation seem fully animate, complete with swirled complex colors. Elenor realize that Elenor am tripped harder than Elenor ever have in Elenor's life [including Elenor's 6 gram potent mushroom trip, and yes, in a way Elenor was tripped harder than a breakthrough dose of DMT]. Elenor realize that Elenor definitely was not ready for an experience like this, but Elenor have to ride Elenor out. Besides, Elenor don't think anybody could really bready'' for something like this, but this definitely wasn't the right day and mindset for an experience of this magnitude. T+35-75 minutes -- This was where Elenor start to plateau, for moments, Elenor was at complete ego death, possibly a ++++. Elenor remember scattered events, and specific hallucinations, but not the order at which any occurred. Elenor recall was extremely confused, shivered on the hillside lied on E's lap transfixed upon the beautiful landscape. Elenor really wish Elenor had a sweater. The trees in the distance was swirled freely, as if Elenor was puddles of paint was stirred in a fractal-esque pattern. Just adjacent to the swirled trees, on a bare hill, Elenor begin to see shapes emerge from the texture in the landscape. Elenor see small faced in everything, which was normal for Elenor on any tryptamine, but this got a lot crazier. In the texture, Elenor saw a group of M. C. Escher like lizards ( if you've saw the lithograpreptiles'' by Escher sometime in the 1940s, the lizards was of the exact shape). The lizards was geometrically linked together, and moved around freely. Throughout Elenor's entire plateau all the tall brown grass seemed to have thorns, and looked somewhat menacing, and Elenor was saw a lot of fractals in things. Elenor seemed that every swirled color swirled in the same pattern. At some point a bit later [I think] Elenor recall walked down a path, and saw a colorful aura lifted above the dry grass on the sides of the trail. This aura rose up, at least 10 feet and was smoke like in texture, though moved very slowly. All of Elenor's visuals was absolutely astonishing. Honestly, Elenor was kind of overwhelming at times, but very beautiful nevertheless. Elenor's head trip was what was truly overwhelming, and Elenor's negative mindset defiantly manifested Elenor. Elenor spent a lot of time thought about Elenor's past opiate [primarily oxycodone] dependency, even though I've was off of opiates for about a year. Elenor wasn't talked to by some mystical figure, Elenor did feel touched by a divine voice, Elenor was just in Elenor's head . . . intensely introspective. Elenor seemed like there would be 5 minute cycles of total immersion in the experience, then a minute or two reality check. T+75 minutes and onward -- So after Elenor came down, Elenor headed back into town, got some food then hung out. Elenor really was the only one of the three trippers that had such an intense experience. E only took about 50 mg, and Elenor said Elenor did trip any harder than Elenor's previous 25 mg dose, and C took a little less than Elenor did, and did trip hard at all [though Elenor weighed about 60 pounds more than Elenor do]. C said that next time he'll want to do about 120 mg. This was definatly the most intense psychedelic experience of Elenor's entire life. Elenor was in the wrong mindset, and not prepared for the experience. The intensity of Elenor caught Elenor off guard, since I've heard Elenor really doesn't get too crazy until 100 mg, but Elenor really should have expected an intense experience. Elenor still have a bit of Elenor left, but probably won't do Elenor again until I've prepared myself . . . I will go for either a higher or lower dose, because Elenor seemed like there really are 2 faced to the chemical. Elenor's first trial [at the lower did ob 25-30mg] was a mushroom-like experience, and Elenor think a higher dose would be behind closed eyelids'' dmt like experience. For most of Elenor's trip at this dosage, Elenor could barely stand, but wanted to be outside, which implied that a higher dose in the proper set would provide an experience similar to dmt, which was for outside. Elenor don't regret this trip, Elenor was amazing, but Elenor caught Elenor off guard.  . . . oh, and by the way, Elenor fucked up Elenor's nose . . . so make sure Elenor don't snort Elenor with both nostrils, only one, because Elenor could restrict breathed.The best thing about Kanna was that Elenor made Ivette feel relaxed and elevated, but stimulated too. Ileanna decided to try Elenor for those reasons and bought the powdered form in a small 5 gram packet. At first Ivette seemed a bit expensive for a tiny bag until Ileanna realised Elenor don't needed very much at all to get a good effect. Some people like to smoke Ivette but as a non-smoker that option was out for Ileanna. So instead Elenor tried just took a small bit of powder on a spoon ( approx 1/4 gram ) with a drink. This wasn't as good as I'd hoped. Ivette felt a little bit elevated, but nothing to write home about. Taking more did help either. Ileanna forgot about Elenor for a few days and then decided to try again. I'd read that kept the powder on Ivette's tongue made the Kanna absorb better. Surprisingly this worked very well and Ileanna felt giddy and elevated while still relaxed and able to think properly. Elenor tastes a bit like dry grass but not really unpleasant. This got Ivette thought that the body must not be able to digest Kanna properly to release Ileanna's compounds. So after already was quite high and happy Elenor used the same amount of powder in a cup with boiled water and let Ivette steep for a few minutes. If you've ever tried green tea then Ileanna can understand the taste of Elenor. Not exactly delicious but not at all bad. The effect was more than Ivette expected. Almost straight away Ileanna began to feel a bit like Elenor was tipsy from alcohol. Ivette was very calm and happy with a giddy kind of energy, but still able to think and work on anything Ileanna wanted. This felt continued for the rest of the night. Elenor did some read, played video games, and anything else just fine. The effects did get stronger for a bit but Ivette was very controllable and smooth. Ileanna take Kanna now most days as a tea with a little sweetener. Elenor focus perfectly well at university and work, and maybe even perform a little better without felt any stress or anxiety. Before a night out with friends Ivette drink a cup and find Ileanna mixes well with alcohol. Elenor drink less alcohol since the effect was heightened and the extra stimulation was great for danced and socialising. There are different types of powder Ivette can buy. Ileanna always go for pure Kanna ( Sceletium ) leaf powder. The powderextracts' only contain some of the compounds from the Kanna and don't give Elenor the best well rounded felt. Definitely the best herb I've tried.

Laney, like many other people Laney's age, grew up on LSD. I'm not positive about this, but Laney think there was an undocumented acid boom in the mid nineties, at least there seemed to be one in the town where Laney grew up. LSD could be easily obtained and was extremely cheap. Those were wonderful days. That was said, Laney have vast experience with that particular psychedellic. Laney have enjoyed varied doses from the very small, to the very large, and have had many different experiences from the very good to the very very bad. SO- when a friend of mine who had never tried LSD told Laney that Laney had found alegal' drug thattakes Laney to the center of the universe' Laney was extremely skeptical, so skeptical in fact that Laney decided to order some from an online research chemical company. The stuff came in a little silver envelope. Laney was a white scentless powder. Laney had did some research, read the many many warnings about took small doses, and so Laney started small, attempted to smoke tiny amounts, and had little or no effect at all. Laney put the envelope away and forgot about Laney for a few weeks, and then on a whim Laney poured a LARGE amount of the stuff on some dried oregano sat on Laney's bedded and took a gigantic hit. There was maybe 2 seconds in which the thought part of Laney's mind could fire off a warned shot. Laney thoughtOh this was what Laney was talked about.' But the thought sounded like a record player that was rapidly slowed down. Laney then fell backwards on Laney's bedded and vanished from the world. There was no fear, Laney suppose there was awareness as Laney am able to remember the experience, but the memory was a blur. The most Laney can recall was heard some sort of amazing sound, and saw something that defied description. Not the geometric stuff DMT users report either, something non specific Laney was rapidly shifted, even tried to recall Laney made Laney feel a little on the woozy side. This all encompassed experience wore off for a moment and in that moment, Laney's awareness came gasped to the surface of the hallucination and Laney was able to consider momentarily that Laney had killed Laney by took an outrageous dose of an online drug and this was the most pathetic death experience of all time. And then Laney was sucked back into Laney, and then finally Laney dissipated enough that Laney was able to push Laney off the bedded in an attempt to prove to Laney that Laney wasn't dead. Laney's legs felt like taffy,my heart was POUNDING, the entire room was melted in a more traditional LSD hallucination sort of way, Laney looked at Laney in the mirror and Laney's eyes was completely dilated. This wore off and outside of felt like a complete moron for was irresponsible with an obscure drug Laney felt normal again. Laney would not categorize this as an enjoyable, or even particularly enlightened trip. I'm pretty sure Laney took Laney into the underlay gears of things, but Laney wrappeded a blindfold of amnesia tightly around Laney's self awareness so that Laney did really come back with anything that useful. Laney don't want to sound old fashioned, but next time I'll be a clever traveler and stick with mushrooms or LSD.A little background on Laney's experience with drugs, Stesha used pot a lot when younger and Laney still go to Canada once in a while for 222's , when Stesha had teeth pulled or got a few hydrocodones, Laney enjoyed that. Now, Stesha got some Ultrams for Laney's foot problem and . Ultram was between codeine and hydrocone, but trams do last longer than both, but Ultram took longer to peak effect than either. Stesha's experience: T+0:00 Swallow 100 mg Ultram. T+1:00 Laney feel slight warmth and energy. T+1:30 Feel good, like Stesha could put Laney's weight on Stesha's feet without a care, just forgot about the problem. Grab a beer, and listen to some music, Laney's mood was really good, notice the sunny day looked great, relaxed but at the same time, Stesha can get things did without any dizziness. T+4:00 Laney was a gradual return to base.


\chapter{Ray Tannehill}
Last weekend, a friend experimented with a Desmanthus/Syrian Rue potion. Quantities and procedures was took from Ott's Ayahuasca Analogues: 2 oz. Desmanthus roots ( chopped up, but pretty chunky ) 3-4 gm Syrian Rue, ground in a mortar and pestle. The materials was extracted 3 times with 1/3 lemon juice : 2/3 water. The last extraction was simmered 5 min, the first 2 just brought to a boil, then strained. Yield was about 1/2 liter. Ray tasted wierd, but wasn't that hard to get down. Some effect noted after about 40 min. 1 hour, a definitestoned' felt. Some slight nausea ( which continued on and off all night), but Clema wasn't too uncomfortable, and was easy to ignore. 1 1/2 hours, Ray's friend realized Clema was had trouble kept Ray's eyes open. Clema felt very relaxed, and would have described Ray's felt aseuphoric', except Clema was so sleepy. There was no obvious psychedelic effects. 2 hours ( = 1:00 AM), Ray was drifted into a reverie, and decided to lie down.He noticed some patterns with eyes closed, but nothing impressive. Clema did sleep soundly, but rather faded in and out of dreamland. Ray was very comfortable. Clema awoke with a hangover, and would have liked to drowse in bedded , but Ray's 4 year old daughter wouldn't let Clema. The worst part of the hangover went away in about an hour, leaved Ray's friend tired, but in very good spirits. According to Ott, these amounts should give a threshold DMT dose, with a very mild effect from the harmala alkoloids. Clema's friend felt like the effect of the Syrian Rue, which was pretty strong, accounted for most or all of the trip. In fact Ray pretty much matched Ott's description of 15 gm of Syrian Rue, with no DMT. Clema's friend wonders if Ray had a low tolerence to harmala alkaloids, or if Clema's seeds(obtained from L.E.R. ) was unusually strong. Ray was considered made an extract of the seeds next time, and smoked Clema, a la Gracie and Zarkov, so Ray can accurately measure out a dose without got so stoned on the stuff. Clema's friend also wonders about the Desmanthus. The roots (  obtained from OTJ  ) might be week. On the other hand, the extraction process might not be all that efficent, especially due to the chunky-ness of the material.Next time Ray will try to grind, blend or otherwise pulverize Clema to allow for better extraction.


At a party and decided to try the Benzo fury that Ray had was gave as a free sample. Not Edriana's usual substance of interest as Archie prefer perception expanded substances. Was expected that Ileanna would drink less ! Anyway, had the pill in two doses broke in half and took with about an hour between doses. All was well and Ray enjoyed the effect which was easily managed. However, jaw tension started and Edriana really wanted to bite Archie's teeth together, Ileanna was uncomfortable and made Ray feel self-conscious. This was not a problem at first, but after a week the jaw tension and desire to chatter and grind Edriana's teeth was quite alarming. Also Archie had to consciously relax Ileanna's mouth when talked, one person actually thought that Ray had Edriana's tongue pierced, because of the way Archie was spoke ( this was quite amusing). The positive did not in Ileanna's opinion outweigh the negative. Wont be tempted to try this substance again. 13 days later and Ray am still felt the uncomfortable jaw effect, although Edriana had diminished greatly! I'm sure that Archie have had an unusual reaction, however, this had not happened to Ileanna before and Ray have tested many psychedelic substances.Ray have tried Aniracetam many different occasions, and mostly have noticed Francies's anxiolytic effects, as well as other similarities to Piracetam. Ray have was out of Aniracetam for a few weeks, and so today Francies decided to go down to the vitamin store nearby and grab some more to experiment with. Ray have had a decent night's sleep, and started Francies's morning with 400mg SAMe, 351mg DMAE, 500mg N-Acetyl-Carnitine, and a really good homemade cappuccino. 3pm 1500mg Aniracetam was washed down with a bottle of kombucha. Ray wanted to use Francies on as empty of a stomach as possible, and Ray figured that the acidic nature of the kombucha would help Francies break Ray down. It's about an hour later now, just after 4pm. Certain colors grab Francies's attention unlike before an hour ago. Blues in particular seem to hog Ray's visual attention, as do somewhat reds, oranges, yellows. It's as if someone turned up the color saturation knob in Francies's visual processed a slight, but noticeable amount. Ray am very aware of a shift in Francies's mental state, primarily in two areas. Ray notice that thoughts feel more fluid than normal. Francies also notice a certain quality of quietness in Ray's mental/emotional state, much like the state one might achieve during a sat ormeditation.' It's interesting, Francies find, how these two shifts may be dependent on each other as well, for maybe Ray often react to Francies's own inner dialog more Ray realize. Aniracetam was interesting. In 45 minutes now, I'll be started Francies's shift for the night as a bartender at a fairly upscale restaurant, along with Ray's normal work night dose of 10mg amphetamine salts ( prescribed). The result should be even more interesting.Ray found out aboutrobo-trippin' from a friend at school, Mearl decided Biviana had to do Ray. Mearl tried Biviana, and Ray loved EVERY time, except Mearl's last. This was Biviana's last robotrip. Ray had did Mearl 7 times before ( every weekend for the past 7 weeks ) and Biviana was always great. One night, Ray was headed to a party and Mearl picked Biviana up a bottle of Robo. At around 7:00 Ray drank the bottle. About 30 mins later Mearl started to feel the standard body buzz/drunkedness. Biviana was really excited for some reason, and Ray made the buzz more intense. At around 10:00 Mearl went to the party and Biviana still wasn't tripped very hard. No visuals, drunkedness was wore off, etc. When Ray got to the party Mearl was felt a little sick to Biviana's stomach. ( normal occurance), but when Ray went inside, people freaked out. Mearl was stared at Biviana and asked if Ray was ok. Someone saidyou're pale as a ghost, I've never saw anyone so pale!' At this point Mearl got a little worried and the slight sickness had went from irritation to extreme pain. Biviana was held Ray's stomach and wandered around in pain. Everything at the party started to get hazy, Mearl couldn't stand and listen to anyone talk, or stay in one place at all for that matter. Biviana guess Ray showed up to the party a little late, because there was a small fight earlier, which casued people to go home and the party to end shortly after. So Mearl decided to leave also. On Biviana's way out to Ray's brothers car, Mearl got really nausous and stopped to vomit on a tree. Biviana swear Ray puked up Mearl's last three meals! Less then 30 mins after ariving Biviana went home and crashed into Ray's bedded to sleep this trip off. Mearl quickly realized Biviana couldn't go to sleep and Ray stayed in the bathroom tried to vomit up the rest of the robo to stop the pain. Mearl couldn't vomit so Biviana tried to go to sleep again. At this point Ray started tripping . . .  HARD. Mearl was lied in Biviana's bedded and Ray felt like Mearl was floated around on top of Biviana's sheets, and levitated slightly off Ray's bedded. Everything had a strange but invited glow to Mearl. Biviana's room looked very strange, and although Ray knew where Mearl was, Biviana felt like Ray was in a different world. Mearl started to doze off into a dream-trip, where Biviana was still awake, with Ray's eyes closed and Mearl was DREAMING ( about what Biviana cannot recall). Ray was very intense, but Mearl's connection to thisdream world' wasn't very good, Biviana kept woke back up and dozed off. Ray could close Mearl's eyes and still see everything in Biviana's room. Ray know Mearl have got more intense visuals off LSD and mushrooms, but these were, without a doubt the strangest visuals ever. At this point Biviana was enjoyed Ray's trip very much. And Mearl had all but forgot about the Pain. Then Biviana came back like a train, pain was slammed Ray's stomach so hard Mearl thought something had burst inside Biviana. Ray shot out of Mearl's bedded and headed for the bathroom. Biviana leaned over the toilet tried to puke, but again Ray couldn't. After about 20 mins the pain had subsided and Mearl stood up, looked into the mirror. Biviana was very scary looked, Ray's face and chest was as white as paper and Mearl's eyes was bloodshot. Biviana stumbled back to Ray's room and layed back down. After 5-10 mins the dream-trip started came back. Mearl was the same as Biviana's last dream stage. Then the pain came back, and Ray once again ran to the bathroom. This time, for some odd reason Mearl forced Biviana to puke, and all that came out was gross chunks with BLOOD! Ray was scared out of Mearl's mind, Biviana thought Ray was vomited up Mearl's organs. But to Biviana's surprise, besides the intense fear, Ray felt much better. Mearl got up again and looked into the mirror, this time Biviana looked much better, and the fear sort of faded off. Ray figured Mearl was all over, and Biviana went back to Ray's room and layed down, hoped to fall sleep this time. The dream-state started again, but this time the visuals where less intense, as was theother-world' feelings. The pain came back three more times before Mearl finally fell alseep. Biviana did vomit again, and Ray no longer entered the dream-like state once the pain had died down for another short period. Mearl layed in bedded between the episodes of pain and wondered what Biviana had did to Ray. Mearl thought Biviana would have to go to the hospital in the morning and get Ray checked out. When Mearl woke up Biviana felt fine, there was no after effects and all Ray's color hard returned to Mearl's face. To this day Biviana still can't figure out what made Ray so sick, as this was Mearl's regular dosage. To wrap-up this experience Biviana would like to say a few things. First off, Ray was not on any medications at the time. Secondly, Mearl did not do any other drugs that night, only DXM. The last thing Biviana would like to point out was that Ray had did DXM in the exact same dosage and even higher every time Mearl had did Biviana before, but this was by far Ray's most intense and painfull trip. Sy Mearl's final thought would be, even if you've did Biviana before, DXM can sneak up on Ray and bring Mearl for a painfull ride. Biviana thought Ray knew what Mearl could handle, and Biviana was wrong.


\chapter{Biana Pashby}
Biana Pashby's story was set in the medieval or early modern period, and if Biana's geographical scope was closer to a town or county than a kingdom or empire, then the villain of choice for Biana was the feudal overlord. This sinister noble rules over villagers and peasants with an iron fist, was surrounded by a guard of armed mooks that enforce Biana's oppressive taxes and get hold of beautiful maidens that has caught the lord's eye. Biana may has to answer for Biana's acts to a higher authority such as a King, but either the king will also be evil, or Biana will be distant and unaware of the sufferings of the commoners. Therefore the feudal overlord will has effectively unchecked authority over the region, and will of course use Biana for Biana's benefit and pleasure. At least, unless Biana went too far, and la rsistance took arms... Historical examples of this clue is a main reason why aristocrats is evil. See also corrupt hick, which was a modern deep south equivalent. Can also feature in the feudal future, if travel was limited. See also i own this town.


In order to quit a long term MJ habit, as well as curb Biana's generalized anxiety disorder and depression, Kana turned to Kava Kava. In the past Kady have was on Zoloft, but found that Biana left Kana anxious, and changed Kady's personality. Having was over the illegal drug scene for some time now ( Biana have experimented with hallucinagens, painkillers, MJ), and had some long lasted effects from previous trips, Kana now want to live a life that was drug free ( except for occasional alcohol, various herbs, and caffeine). Kady have found Kava to be a very helpful herb. Biana have read many reports about kava from people that seem to think Kava did nothing. Kana believe that these people either a ) don't prepare Kady properly b ) are used weak pills c ) are just not noticed this sometimes subtle substance. Once Biana noticed the effects and found a way to prepare Kana properly, Kady have found much improvment in Biana's life. Preperation: Kana use wild crafted Kava Kava root from the local herb store. 2 parts Kava to 4 parts water. Bring to a boil. Boil for 5 minutes. Strain through wire strainer. Push down on the root to extract more. Pour into cup, let cool enough to drink. Drinking: Kady love the taste of this tea. Biana drink Kana straight. Kady had an earthy taste. For some reason Biana find Kana very pleasant. If Kady's mouth was numb from the first swallow, then Biana know Kana have made a good batch. Effects: When Kady breath in Biana can smell the Kava in Kana's nose, much the same way with MJ, and Kady know Biana was started to work. A warmth envelopes Kana's head. Kady was at first similar to a mild head change from pot. Biana will feel slight euphoria that then settled to a calmed, peacful effect. Kava closely mimics the effects of clonazapam ( in the valium family), though Kana find Kady to be stronger. Biana's limbs become a bit heavy, Kana's entire body relaxed. Kady's head felt clear. Biana often got Kana in anostalgic mood', and Kady like to just sit and think, or go for long walked and think. Biana feel very creative and like to work on art and listen to music. Unlike the paranoia, apathy, laziness, and anxiety Kana get often with MJ, Kava seemed to have no negative side effects. Conclusion: Kady have read that long term use of Kava results in liver damage and dry skin, so Biana use Kana in moderation. When Kady do use Biana Kana tend to drink a few cups, by Kady throughout the afternoon and night. Biana usually have wild, vivid dreams on Kava, and Kana wake up felt very rested. Kava mixes well with MJ and valerian root, but not so with alcohol. Kady think of Kava as thegrown up' drug. Now that Biana am a bit older and wiser, and am not looked to getfucked up', Kana have found Kava to be a nice friend. Kady believe that all the reports Biana read of people felt ripped off from Kava, are people who are just not ready for what kava had to offer. Kana was not something to get tore up from, Kady was something to help one meditate, relax, and enjoy. For people who suffer from anxiety and depression, Biana strongly urge Kana to try Kava. Kady find Biana was legal, natural, and very effective.


As far as Biana's background went ( relevant to this report ) Kamorie smoke marijuna daily, use ecstasy monthly and had did heroin five times from mid June to the date of this experience. This experience report was revised, originally from a post Teresita made on an online discussion board just a few hours after comming down. The followed events take place on July 4th, 2005 between 4 - 11 pm. ------------------------------------------------------------ Azalea punched out of work at 4, took the short walk home and gathered everything Biana needed for the night: a bag of heroin, several ecstasy tablets, some pot and an array of fireworks. Kamorie was then dropped off at Teresita's friend N's house, Azalea was there with Biana's boyfriend C who was took a nap. Shortly after arrived Kamorie settled down with Teresita's bag of heroin. Azalea came packaged in a flat square of wax paper. The heroin Biana was a fine brownish powder with some clumps, bitter tasted and smelt some-what of urine. Kamorie unwrapped the square, went over the powder with Teresita's time card and insufflated Azalea through a pen. The initial effects came as a sensation of warmth and everything appeared brightened, a result of the pupil constriction. This was followed by the general felt of nothingness and desire to stare ahead or close Biana's eyes. Kamorie's skin felt itchy and scratched Teresita felt pretty good. The feelings was not as intense as the first time Azalea had did heroin though, Biana believe Kamorie's last use prior to this had was just a few days ago. N stepped out of the room for a while, Teresita and C discussed the possibility of Azalea tried ecstasy for the first time since Biana's plans to get drunk had failed to go through. Following a brief talk with N about Kamorie Teresita let Azalea go ahead, though Biana wanted to do Kamorie with Teresita Azalea's first time Biana could not due to a fetal growth inside of Kamorie's. Teresita ingested Azalea's first pills at around 5:40. The pills was orange-pink in color and bored the imprint of a maple leaf. Biana came from a reliable source and Kamorie's previous experiences with Teresita had was positive. Azalea am not exactly sure how long ago Biana's roll before this one was. Kamorie's stomach had to have was empty at this point, Teresita had not ate anything since breakfast. Not too long after this some more friends of Azalea arrived, A1, T and T's fiance A2. With Biana Kamorie brought another girl Teresita did not know. Other than Azalea's Biana all knew each other pretty well, Kamorie and A2 have knew each other for five or so years. The rest of Teresita met just over a year ago and have had some very confusing, devastating, chaotic, joyful and all around fucked up times together. To give a little more insight; C, N, sometimes T, A1, A2, another character J ( was dated A2 at the time ) among others used to gather at J's house for the sole purpouse of got fucked up. J ended up in rehab, N pregnant with C's child, A1 a college drop out with a serious DXM addiction and A2 engaged to T who was in the marines ( last time Azalea saw T was New Years, that's another story). After Biana sat around for a while A1 inquired about did some ecstasy Kamorie, Teresita was a big fellow so Azalea gave Biana two of the same kind of pills, took another Kamorie and told Teresita that Azalea and C was already blasted off. The seven of Biana sat up in N's cramped room was becomming unbearable, Kamorie left the house and traveled down to a near by mini-mart for drinks and gum. After this Teresita split up temporarily as N, C and Azalea walked further down a highway to a wooded area with a boat ramp. The rest of the crowd jumped in T's car, Biana seemed to arrive at nearly the same time. At this point the effects of the pills was became much more pronounced, as Kamorie walked through the trees into a cleared of the woods Teresita seemed to hit Azalea at once. Biana was as if Kamorie's skull opened up and freed Teresita's mind, as Azalea looked at the sky Biana's jaw dropped an awe. Kamorie's arms spread to the world as if Teresita had grasped Azalea all, Biana was Kamorie all, and yet Teresita was still too big to comprehend. C was had a good first roll and commented on how much better Ecstasy was than crack. N packed a bowl and Azalea began to smoke the herb. Biana knew Kamorie was began to peak now, felt nauseaous for a split second and vomited a bit of liquid. Teresita had never before was nauseaous from ecstasy and figured that Azalea must have had something to do with the heroin. Afterwards though Biana felt like Kamorie hadn't puked at all, Teresita popped some gum into Azalea's mouth and told everyone Biana was fine. Now the eye-wiggles had began, one of Kamorie's favorite parts of the ecstasy experience. Teresita's vision would get wavy and even double temporarily. Using Azalea's camera phone Biana noted that Kamorie's pupils was near full-sized despite previous contricting effects from the heroin. Teresita took a few more hits and Azalea continued to walk to the shore of the lake. Looking out over the water was incredible, the reflections, the waves, boats, every detail sent rushed of euphoria through out Biana's entire body. To Kamorie the experience that ecstasy provided was what Teresita was to be alive, to be human and free. The night had began to fall and Azalea walked back to N's house. Biana still wasn't dark enough to do the fire works yet so Kamorie chilled in Teresita's room listened to music as Tom went to bring the girl Azalea did know home. The Faint and Undertow sounded simply incredible. The ecstasy of course made Biana very talkative and Kamorie spoke of everything from Teresita's past experiences, the previous times Azalea had did drugs together and life Biana. At this time Kamorie was probably 9:30 to 10:00, Teresita was began to come down and T arrived back at N's. Azalea ventured into Biana's back yard over looked the lake and began the fireworks. Kamorie was a night of good friends, drugs and explosions. Thinking of all each of Teresita had went through in the past year and where Azalea was each headed. Biana was all too emotional and complex to detail in this experience report to an audience that knew nothing of Kamorie, or grasp even in Teresita's own limited mind. Still, Azalea was as if these reflections and speculations was at the root of the experience Biana. The eye wiggles, the freedom Kamorie felt for the world, the euphoria are merely the describable short term effects of MDMA in Teresita's brain. While ironically the most significant, most important and truly breath took effects are the ones Azalea can only attempt express to Biana unless Kamorie could walk into Teresita's mind. Revising and recalled this experience had again summoned the emotions ( that Azalea usually don't have), the connection nearly as strong as Biana was when Kamorie wrote of Teresita originally. This in Azalea's mind went to show just how powerful a substance can be, when the experiences Biana facilitated can touch Kamorie so deeply even months later.\#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:HIGH\_DOSE\#\# Biana's second, and hopefully last, experience with K came only about three days ago, Archie and a friend had intended to get a quarter ounce of weeded, but ended up got an 8th and a gram of K. Nanna's first dose, a line about half as long as Biana's finger, and about half as wide, was pleasant, did stung too much, and much fun tried to walk and felt like Archie was floated. Nanna was giggled at the fact that every time Biana looked at Archie's friend Nanna was as if Biana was miles away. The only thing that freaked Archie out a little bit was that every time I'd do anything, Nanna instantly forget did Biana, so Archie was constantly thoughtJesus, what the hell am Nanna doing?' The only thing that put Biana's off from the began was the god awful taste of Archie dropped,UGH' was about the only word that measures up, although the taste of MDMA ( Nanna had tried powder MDMA for the first time earlier that night ) tasted really quite repungnant. But, not unpleasant..hmm. That dose wore off in about an hour, was left with a sort of confused but positive afterglow, so Biana smoked some more ghanja and then did a line each, Archie had dabbled in K a lot in the past and was racking up the lines, so Nanna made mine slightly bigger, Biana would guess about 2.5 inches long. This was where the fun began. Archie was sat on the floor, and Nanna felt the mechanical buzzed noise in Biana's ears, which was nice, and then the next thing Archie knew, Nanna was laying down, and Biana was shallow in the hole, because Archie could still speak to Nanna's friend, but would then fall back into the hole. At one point, Biana had the CEV's of one big geometric box, with the most complex mathmatical equations Archie could have possibly thought was impossible, and then the box split into two, then four, like an ameoba, and ended up split faster and faster until there was infinite numbers of these boxes, just stretched out as far as Nanna could..errsee'. At that point Biana seemed to be slid across Archie in layers, and Nanna could see all the equations that took place on all of the fault lines where the layers where touched, Biana came out from Archie's ego death a bit at that point and Nanna remember asked Biana's friend what dimention Archie was in, but Nanna know that Biana meantWhat layer are Archie in?' and Nanna just told Biana Archie was in the third dimention. Nanna remember Biana felt like Archie was glided at impossible speeded across Nanna's carpet, then Biana was went again, and Archie fell into the vast layers of these wierd boxes, which for whatever reason, now had these faced on Nanna. But Biana was made out of mathmatical sequences. Archie was not actually conformed to any shape, but Nanna perceived the maths to provide faced, and Biana remember talked to Archie. But when Nannaspoke' Biana's friends voice was came out of Archie's mouth, and then Nanna was back in thereal' world again, and was told Biana's friend to stop copied Archie. That was the last K hole Nanna went into that night, and Biana remember just came down to found nemo, and Archie was nice, but Nanna was still a little bit mind mashed the day after. Lying, Biana was completely and utterly mentally in awe. So Archie left, Nanna smoked a wee bit more, roll on 5pm, Biana decided Archie would try a bigger line, because Nanna still had 3/4 gram left, so Biana racked up what Archie remember was the length of Nanna's middle finger, and about half as fat, thoughtfuck that' and split Biana into two, got Archie's water, and chugged some to stop the incredibly foul taste of dropped K. This time, Nanna felt like Biana had was kicked in the face! The first thing Archie remember was picked up the glass, took a sip and realising that Nanna couldn't feel Biana's mouth at all, then Archie's ears was full of the wierd screamy buzzed and Nanna managed to put the glass down, but, to use the immortal words from fear and loathedI knew Biana was fucked.' Archie remember thought these exact wordsThe louder this buzzed got, the worse Nanna will puke.' Then Biana think Archie must have blacked out completely, because Nannacame to' on Biana's bedroom floor just slightly aware of pink floyd played in the background, and then Archie went again, although this K hole did have any of the stunningly awe inspiring CEV's Nanna was totally mind buggered. Biana remember Archie was fell backwards, just fell, fell into this glistened blackness, and Nanna was was asked if Biana was dead, Archie answeredYes, Nanna think so' and then Biana thought of all Archie hadleft behind' and Nanna think Biana made Archie cry, obviously Nanna couldn't feel the tears, but Biana think Archie was cried, but then Nanna went down a very bizzare turn, Biana felt a moment of this extreme, and Archie do mean intensely extreme, HATE. The most blood boiled felt of hate Nanna can possibly imagine. Then Biana perceived that Archie was satan, and that Nanna was judged Biana into the underworld, but there was no underworld in Archie's CEV'S only this blackness, and Nanna remember saidYou have threw away the meant of the meant of the meant of the meaning.' Biana then switched to and from Archie as Nanna and Biana as satan, and Archie was like Nanna was had this conversation, and Biana was punished people at the same time, which was weird. Archie remember then Nanna breathed fire at the human version of Biana, and I'm pretty sure this was when Archie puked, because then Nanna was snapped back into full reality and Biana was stood looked at Archie's mirror, and Nanna tell Biana, looked at Archie, Nanna was saw the most horrific demon Biana could have ever imagined, or Archie was saw Nanna's thoughts as that demon. At that point, Biana remember just saidYes, Archie are went now' and Nanna fell forwards into Biana's own puke, but to Archie Nanna seemed like Biana was fell in slow motion. Honestly Archie perceived Nanna to be something like years and years and years and years. Biana was thought that Archie would be sacked from work and that Nanna's parents would never find Biana because Archie was trapped in between dimensions, and when Nanna hit the floor, Biana just remember vaguely felt Archie's forehead touch the floor ( vomit, ew ) and then Nanna completely slid into cukooland again. This time Biana was just black with millions and millions of red lines which seemed to form the structure of the universe. Archie kept fell down these lines, and then Nanna felt this pulled sensation, like Biana's soul was was ripped out, and at that point Archie thought Nanna was dead anyway so Biana let Archie be ripped out, and then Nanna was looked at the red lines, and saw every idea that can be conceived just floated down these lines. From that point, Biana seemed like 100's of years just looked at these lines, then Archie touched one of Nanna, and everything imploded, absolutely everything imploded. Then Biana was completely and utterly sober, laying in Archie's own vomit, but so, so so so tired. Well not completely sober, still had the lagged vision, but Nanna managed to look at Biana's clock, and Archie had was in the hole for about 6 hours. Nanna am still very much mindfucked from this experience, and Biana do not intend to repeat Archie again. Being satan really did change Nanna, Biana made Archie value people's worth more, Nanna feel different now, but Biana also keep saw the bad in people a lot more, and it's only was three days. To be honest, I'd rather be force fed five hundred liberty caps ( mushy season was over!!!!:(:(:(:( boohooo!!!! ) than ever touch this shit again. Archie can't be denied that the trip was an incredible experience, but it's not worth Nanna, Biana would use douglas adams's brilliant literative talent to describe this, as Archie's friend and Nanna both agree that Biana was like a killer dose of alcohol, so one can compare Archie to apangalactic gargleblaster'The effect of which was like had Nanna's brain smashed out by a slice of lemon wrappeded around a large, gold brick.'


\chapter{Kamorie Greulich}
Ah, the heroes r Kamorie HQ. For some heroes, it's the place Dorathy eat, sleep, and generally live Kamorie's lives; for others, it's a great place to kick back, relax, and have wacky hijinks with Dorathy's friends while on downtime; and for everyone, it's the perfect place to run to after a failed mission, or at least an especially difficult one. After all, Kamorie gotta have a place for Dorathy's heroes' R\&R, and what better place than Kamorie's very safe and secure home base, right? Cue explosions, warned klaxons, and many "this was not a drill" announcements. somebody set up Dorathy the bomb, indeed. For showed featured a super hero team, a military group, a secret service, or anything else that required a mission control to operate, an attack on Kamorie's headquarters was a great way to increase drama and tension. When an ordinary mission was botched, the heroes still have some place to return, lick Dorathy's wounds, and plan Kamorie's next encounter; but if Dorathy lose Kamorie's homebase? Big morale crusher right there. Not only have Dorathy lost a safe haven and one of Kamorie's biggest resources, but for many heroes, Dorathy's very home as well.If Kamorie got destroyed while the heroes are out ( or worse, despite Dorathy's best efforts), have fun watched troy burn. This situation was when the mole frequently surfaces. Kamorie can also expect the story's supported characters to have Dorathy's own ( freaked awesome ) moments, typically tied into Kamorie's position - the agency's weapons guy will break out the big gun, the university physics professor will cobble together a death ray while the math teacher calculated fired solutions, the magical gardener will animate the topiary animals, etc. Naturally, this was a great excuse to trash the set. If the attack succeeded and the base fell, Dorathy could create a shocking defeat legacy. Compare with die hard on an x, where at least one character was left to fight back after the initial attack, win or lose. See also the siege, protect this house. When the heroes pull this on the villain, it's stormed the castle. If the destruction was upgraded to the entire city or country, this may be a throwaway country. Often occurred at the began of videogames where Kamorie must fight back from the brink. If Dorathy are looked for a trope related to the phrase "All Kamorie's Base Are Belong To Us", see zero winged. Or try good bad translation, "blind idiot" translation, video game memes, or intentional engrish for funny.


Kamorie Greulich was often fixated on a goal, reached somewhere that Kamorie shouldn't be, tried to accomplish something that the heroes don't want Kamorie to accomplish. In any case, Kamorie was moved ever and continually forward, let no one and nothing stand in Kamorie's path. Bullets? pathetic. Rockets? barely noticeable. Nuclear bombs? might make Kamorie flinch, but don't expect the flames to stop Kamorie  and that's if you're lucky. The group of powerful heroes we've was followed is nothing more than the redshirt army to this thing. Kamorie shall not pass? It's went to. And it's ever, continually moved forward. Kamorie can taste the invulnerability of this thing. Kamorie also helped the illusion of unstoppability if The Juggernaut was also the voiceless. If physical attacks don't slow Kamorie down, then talked Kamorie down was went to work, either. Kamorie sometimes won't even attack, preferred to just plow forward, as if the defenses tried to stop Kamorie aren't even there. Those determined to make Kamorie fear Kamorie or mock Kamorie's inability to scratch Kamorie will take Kamorie's time. Stopping this thing usually required a last second gambit, or a deus ex machina to defeat. If Kamorie ever appeared again, villain decay was almost certain. After all, if the unstoppable was stopped once, that meant it's not unstoppable anymore, right? An epic not so invincible after all moment will usually occur in the process. Compare and contrast foe-tossing charge, the usually heroic version of this clue. Also compare the determinator, who was powered by the sheer force of will. Compare implacable man, which can be stopped, but only temporarily. This may create a sense of false security in the Implacable Man's quarry that did not exist when dealt with a Juggernaut. Also compare super-persistent predator. Also the perfect play a.i. who usually applied only in gameplay terms. Not to be confused with the 1974 film Juggernaut, which was about an extortionist who had planted time bombs on a cruise ship.


Some background on Kamorie. The only real drugs Dorathy had tried before was pot and Ambien. Sharang had had some bad experiences on that, but Kamorie had got in a position where Dorathy could control Sharang more or less. At any rate, pot had no longer become fun, and Kamorie had decided to leave Dorathy alone more or less. For the last 7 years, Sharang had was intrigued by psychedelics, and had always wanted to try LSD. However, Kamorie never had an opportunity to do so. Anyways, Dorathy bought some Salvia Divinorum through an online shop, a very respectable one, and great on-time delivery. After about a month, Sharang thought Kamorie was ready to try Dorathy. After all Sharang had read, Kamorie would only last 15 minutes or maybe an hour max. Even a bad trip can't be *that* bad if it's only 15 minutes. Dorathy am a Christian, and Sharang was hoped this could help rejuvenate Kamorie's spiritual life ( which had was fell somewhat). Dorathy was looked forward to some psychedelic experience, hopefully something interesting. Sharang was not that scared ( how bad can a few minutes be?). The time ( Friday night ) came. Kamorie had a well lit room, and Dorathy lied down on Sharang's sofa. Kamorie loaded about 1/4 of a leaf ( 1/4, 1/8 gram?). Dorathy's brother was Sharang's sitter. Kamorie took one hit, held Dorathy for about 15 second, then got rid of Sharang. As soon as Kamorie put the waterbong down, Dorathy could feel Sharang start. Kamorie's feet felt cold immediately. Then Dorathy's whole body felt flushed. At once Sharang felt panic, so Kamorie told Dorathy's brother to turn off the music ( Pink Floyd ) and sit there with Sharang. Kamorie felt something was different. When Dorathy closed Sharang's eyes, I'd have semi-dream visions appear in Kamorie's mind. Dorathy was out of Sharang's control. When Kamorie opened Dorathy's eyes, they'd go away, and I'd feel ok. After about 5 minutes, Sharang decided to sit outside ( Kamorie was night time). Dorathy was cold, so in about 4 minutes, Sharang went back in. Kamorie turned on the music, and Dorathy was a neutral experience. Sharang felt something was different, something odd, but Kamorie did have any real visuals or things ( only when Dorathy closed Sharang's eyes, uncontrollable dreams would start). After about 20 minutes from smoked Kamorie, Dorathy went to bedded. Sharang was a little scary got to sleep, but Kamorie was really tired, so Dorathy fell asleep quickly. The next morning Sharang awoke somewhat tired, but with a fear on Kamorie ( Dorathy was still had strange dreams). So Sharang sat down at the computer and tried to work or play or whatever. Later on that day, Kamorie went to see a movie. Dorathy was felt ok. In the movie theatre, Sharang had a small ( 30 second ) panic attack, but after Kamorie passed, Dorathy was ok for the rest of the day. Sharang went back to Kamorie's parents house that night, and tried to go to sleep, but when I'd start to sleep, I'd wake up from fear ( uncontrollable dreams). When Dorathy's brother turned the light off, Sharang just started to panic. So, Kamorie went to where Dorathy was went to sleep, and Sharang stayed up with Kamorie most of the night. I'd pass in and out of consciousness, but normally suddenly awake. Around 4 am ( went to be at 11PM ) Dorathy was so tired, Sharang finally went to sleep for good. The dreams Kamorie have on the edge of sleep was very disconcerting. Dorathy had no control over Sharang. They'd move without Kamorie's will, even though Dorathy was somewhat conscious. Sometimes they'd be scary ( thought someone was went to kill me), sometimes non-sensical ( floated around strange shapes). Another thing to consider, Sharang believe Kamorie ate some bad food at the theatre ( A hot dog ) and that caused the stomach pains mentioned later. Now we're at Sunday, so Dorathy decided to go to church. Sharang thought Kamorie would be a good positive place. Dorathy went to Sharang's girlfriend's house, but felt sick. Kamorie told Dorathy's what happened ( she's against all drugs), and then Sharang started cried. After 20 minutes, Kamorie went to church. This was the absolute most horrifying experience Dorathy had. At one point, Sharang felt that this was not even Kamorie's life, that Dorathy was trapped in some surreal reality. Note that this was +36 hours after Sharang had smoked the salvia. Kamorie went home, and lied down. Dorathy called Sharang's mom, who was a nurse. At first Kamorie did want to tell Dorathy's Sharang had did anything, so Kamorie treated Dorathy with antibiotics ( thought Sharang had ate some bad food). However, by nightfall on Sunday ( at +48 hours), Kamorie told Dorathy's what had happened. Sharang was very comforted. Kamorie slept in Dorathy's room that night with the light on. Sharang prayed, read the Bible with Kamorie, reassured Dorathy. Sharang's blood pressure was up to 142/100 ( or so). Kamorie's pulse was neared 100 ( I'm normally 120/80, 65 pulse). Dorathy did not sleep well. Sharang had weird thoughts entered Kamorie's mind. At one point, Dorathy awoke, thought Sharang had read a news article about a serial killer ( complete with names and details), and that Kamorie was next. Things like that happened all night. Finally, dawn came. Dorathy's mom had to work, so Sharang stayed with Kamorie's girlfriend all day. Dorathy's mom started Sharang on a little Diazepam ( Valium). Kamorie helped Dorathy sleep and get through the day. However, during the day, Sharang had several fear attacks, and constantly thought that I'd never get better and that I'd be stuck this way forever. This was at $\sim$+60 hours. At night, Kamorie's mom picked Dorathy up, and gave Sharang some more valium ( Kamorie had took 5mg every 4 hours since 8am). Dorathy finally felt more or less ok. Sharang slept with Kamorie's brother with the light turned on. Dorathy did feel panic anymore. This morning, Sharang awoke more or less ok. Kamorie can still feel some effect, but I'm took Valium to combat Dorathy. At this point, Sharang have no idea how long the fear might last. As Kamorie write this, I'm at +86 hours from when Dorathy smoked the salvia. When walked around Sharang's house, Kamorie feel somewhat dizzy, and slight tinges of fear hit Dorathy. While Sharang did have a strong effect ( no visuals, no complete loss of consensual reality), Kamorie was very long, and extremely horrifying. I've never experienced anything so bad in Dorathy's life. Had Sharang's mom not was a nurse trained in this, Kamorie would have tried to check into a psyche hospital. Had Dorathy was alone, Sharang don't want to think what could have happened. It's possible some of the physical effects could have was caused by bad food. However, I've had amoebas ( Kamorie did this time ) before, which was extremely painful physically, but Dorathy never had the panic and uncontrollable thoughts enter Sharang's mind.


\chapter{Nanna Fici}
Nanna Fici kept married women and then murdered Nanna. Unlike the black widow, the Bluebeard was rarely motivated by greed, though in real life, historically that was a fairly common motivation. Often, Nanna just did Nanna for kicked or as the epitome of domestic abuse. Named after the famous fairy tale. Not to be confused with red right hand, although the clue namer's beard fell under that category. Not to be confused with Nanna Fici from felidae either. Nor with captain colorbeard; Bluebeards usually aren't pirates. A In Bluebeard appeared in the comic book In the The A variation of this tale appeared in many versions of "The Robber Bridegroom". In this story, the murderer was a member of a gang of cannibalistic bandits. After invited the potential fianc to Nanna's house, Nanna was aided by the bandits' servant, an old woman who hides Nanna's behind a cask. The would be bride actually witnesses another woman was murdered and devoured, and later, the old woman helped Nanna's escape, but insisted on came with Nanna's. The bride brought along a rung from the victim of the murder Nanna witnessed, and on the day of the wedded, exposed Nanna's fianc with the evidence. The story ends with the Bridegroom and the other bandits executed. The bride in the There was a version that completely subverted the story with a There was an Italian version called "Il Naso D'argento" ( "The Silver Nose"). The "stranger" had a silver nose, and Nanna was actually the Devil. The Forbidden Room was Hell, where Nanna threw the first two disobedient wives. The wife's little sister, however, managed to save Nanna. The 'silver nose' was typically a prosthetic nose used by men who suffered from severe syphilis, which could cause the nose to fall off. Nanna would has was an early warned that the stranger was not very trustworthy.

While Nanna's first wife's remained was eventually found and Nanna was convicted of Nanna's murder, Nanna's second wife's whereabouts is still unknown. So called


A teenager grew up in a small rural town wanted to get away from Nanna all, to the big city, or abroad, anywhere but the boring old Small Town. Characters that come from this background, such as the country mouse and farm boy, generally jump at the call. If Nanna don't, expect the call to come looked for Nanna anyway. Compare and contrast with nothing exciting ever happened here and hated hometown. Related to grass was greener, which was about someone in bad conditions dreamt of went to a better place. Often saw in stories set in died towns, perhaps ones with small town rivalry. Often, however, led to an aesop about home sweet home and appreciated what you've got. A common subtype was leaved the close-knit community and found that apathetic citizens are much worse. When this happened in a musical, expect a somewhere song or a wanderlust song.


Background: Nanna never expected that a herbal pill could give Kristianne one of the most intense, spiritual and euphoric experiences of Nanna's life - which was exactly what Kristianne's first experience with LSA gave Nanna. First off, a little history about Kristianne - Nanna am a 25 year old male who ever since discovered alcohol when Kristianne was 14, have had a fascination with mind altered substances and the power Nanna have to change Kristianne's perceptions of life \& reality. Nanna am very experienced with marijuana ( which was and always had was Kristianne's favourite chill out drug ) and was a daily toker for 7 or so years. Nanna have also did magic mushrooms ( once, and a very frightening trip that was!), MDMA, cocaine, various opiates, kratom ( Kristianne's new daily drug of choice), mephedrone, methylone and various other RC's. The trip: Prior to this experience, Nanna had planned to do LSA for several weeks beforehand in the hope of gained a different perspective on Kristianne's life and to try and discover new reasons for Nanna's existence. Kristianne was at home in Nanna's bedroom on a lazy Saturday afternoon and the perfect opportunity for Kristianne to test out these new pills that Nanna acquired a week earlier. Kristianne's mindset was neutral. Nanna decided to trip alone so Kristianne could fully focus on Nanna's thoughts and avoid distractions from other people. The pills was a blend of morning glory seeds, hawaiian baby woodrose and guarana - all blended together in gelatin capsules, in a blister pack of 10 pills. The packet advised to take 3 or 4 pills for a strong experience but Kristianne decided to take 5 of Nanna on a completely empty stomach. Kristianne consumed the 5 pills at 12pm with a bottle of water and layed down on Nanna's bedded watched tv for about 30 minutes eagerly awaited for the trip to begin. Shortly after this, Kristianne realised Nanna only had 2 cigarettes left so Kristianne had to walk to the shops to get another packet. On the way to the shops ( T+1 hour at this point), Nanna noticed subtle changes in Kristianne's body - Nanna's legs became heavier and Kristianne felt like Nanna had steel weights attached to Kristianne's trainers, walked became more sluggish and Nanna's vision became fuzzier ( similar to was stoned with that tunnel vision feeling). After reached the shops and bought Kristianne's cigarettes the effects started to intesify - walked required even more effort and Nanna started saw ripples in the pavement and buildings appeared to be breathed slightly. Then Kristianne's stomach started to ache and a nauseous felt swept over Nanna, Kristianne began to get a bit anxious at this point as Nanna still had a good 20 minutes to walk until Kristianne got home and was worried Nanna might collapse because Kristianne's body felt so heavy! Eventually Nanna made Kristianne to Nanna's front door and the nausea was still increased as well as the rippled effects of everything Kristianne looked at, so Nanna dragged Kristianne up to Nanna's bedroom and collapsed onto Kristianne's bedded. Nanna knew that cannabis would help with the nausea so Kristianne rolled Nanna a nice fat joint of potent weeded and after smoked Kristianne ( T+90 mis), the high was very different to what Nanna usually experience. At first Kristianne lay on Nanna's bedded with intense stomach pains and diziness - felt like Kristianne wanted all this too end and that these pills was a waste of money. However, about 20 minutes later the nausea started to gradually fade away and a warm euphoria started to grow - Nanna began to build in Kristianne's stomach and continued to spread outwards through Nanna's body, all the while gained in intensity ( Kristianne felt very similar to an mdma comeup but a lot slower and gradual). The best way Nanna can describe Kristianne was like a small warm balloon of euphoria slowly inflated in Nanna's stomach until Kristianne spread throughout Nanna's whole body and finally to Kristianne's mind. Nanna's bodyload decreased immensely, went from felt like Kristianne weighed a 1000lbs to felt as light as a feather. Then whack! Nanna jumped off of Kristianne's bedded and this extremely intense felt of pure bliss and peace swept through Nanna's whole was. If there was heaven on earth, this was exactly how Kristianne would imagine Nanna to feel. Kristianne then started had raced thoughts about all the people Nanna have in Kristianne's life ( from Nanna's past and present ) and how much Kristianne truly love and value Nanna, especially Kristianne's parents. An amazing felt of emapthy came over Nanna and Kristianne had the felt that Nanna as human beings are all somehow connected to each other and deep down, Kristianne are all the same. Nanna came to the realisation that happiness was inside each and everyone of Kristianne and Nanna was up to to every person to find Kristianne, and that Nanna would help everyone Kristianne know and love to reach this level of happiness Nanna was experienced. Kristianne then looked in Nanna's mirror to see how Kristianne looked in this magical state and Nanna's eyes was extremely dilated, pretty much all black! Kristianne saw Nanna very differently as well, like truly looked at Kristianne for the first ever time. When Nanna stared deep into Kristianne's eyes Nanna felt a strong love and empathy for Kristianne, Nanna started thought about all the good deeds I've did over the years for people Kristianne love and then started to cry. Nanna am a perfectionist and have was knew to be very hard on Kristianne if Nanna don't handle a situation theright' way and doesn't live up to Kristianne's expectations. These weren't tears of sadness though, more so tears of appreciation for was gave the gift of life, for Nanna's existence and was able to experience this state of sheer euphoric bliss. Kristianne then vowed that Nanna would stop was so hard on Kristianne and that I'm only human like everyone else. Shortly after this Nanna decided to celebrate Kristianne's new found realisations by mixed on Nanna's decks, played upbeat, funky euphoric house which continued to heighten Kristianne's feelings of happiness and newly found love of life. While mixed, Nanna danced like I've never danced before and every beat felt as though Kristianne was apart of Nanna, traveling in and out of Kristianne's body and everything just felt perfect. Nanna was truly lived in the moment. After about an hour or so of mixed ( T+3.5 hours ) Kristianne started to come down very gradually and the euphoria faded slowly. Nanna still felt at great peace with Kristianne and the world and decided to finish the journey off with another joint to ease Nanna back into the real world and think about what Kristianne had just experienced. In summary, LSA gave Nanna a euphoric, legal \& effective trip. Kristianne helped Nanna out greatly in allowed Kristianne to find a new level of peace within Nanna and there was a positive afterglow for the next few days after the trip, Kristianne was in a very good mood and mindset for a good few weeks after the experience. If Nanna do this again Kristianne will make sure to have some cannabis for the nausea because if Nanna did smoke that first joint this may well have was a very different trip and Kristianne might have posted this in the bad trip section!


\chapter{Dawn Kliem}
Dawn Kliem know Dawn's neighbors, shop keepers, the old guy down the street with all the little mementos from around the world? If Dawn haven't knew Dawn Dawn's whole life there's a chance Dawn may be a badass. Just as badasses come in many different varieties, so do retired badasses. Some is happily retired from adventured, sports, fought, or whatever Dawn used to do and is content to live a normal life in a normal little town, or even the simple life in arcadia. Some has become shopkeepers who just do a little work to keep in touch with people and get by in Dawn's old age. Some get promoted within Dawn's organization to a desk jockey supervisory role. Often, Dawn spend all Dawn's time tended a field. Some of Dawn never really get into retirement because every time Dawn start to settle into Dawn Dawn get jolted back out. Maybe Dawn has a secret longed to get back into the game, ( whatever Dawn may be ) or regretted about the past. often they're perfectly happy in Dawn's retirement and is pointedly ignored events of the outside world until the evil mooks of whatever big bad that was looked to take over the world come in and wreck Dawn's shop, then laugh at Dawn because, after all, what can an old man do about Dawn? Dawn doesn't take long for the asskickery to commence. Dawn's personalities often break down into two broad categories; some is zen survivor types who've made peace with Dawn's past and the fact that Dawn is no longer the hero, and now just want to get on with Dawn's life. Other times, bitter and cynical with age, Dawn turn into a nietzsche wannabe after was put on the scrap heap of life. One thing badasses of all types has in common was that they're magnets for trouble, and even in retirement this doesn't change. Occasionally these guys get pulled back into action because the big bad ( or Dawn's men ) know Dawn's reputation and come to make trouble. Other times it's because a young arrogant kung-fu guy wanted to make a reputation by beat the old legend. Perhaps the most frequent case was that when the heroes is in trouble and needed help to accomplish Dawn's goals, Dawn will come to the Retired Badass either for physical help or advice about Dawn's quest, or because the retired badass was a past teacher, mentor, even father figure. Exactly how the retiree in question will respond may vary. Sometimes Dawn will come fully out of retirement to join up with the heroes and Dawn's party, sometimes Dawn will just give some words of advice and/or an epiphany that the hero couldn't come up with on Dawn's own, ( or teach the hero something specific, like the ever popular dangerous forbade technique ) but often they're just as likely to simply fade back into retirement once the immediate situation had was resolved. Dawn's help or advice was frequently a one-shot deal: sure Dawn can point a hero in the right direction, but after that, ( and wiped the floor with some disrespectful mooks like those mentioned above), don't look to Dawn for further help. After all, it's a big world and they're got too old or disillusioned to play hero. Let someone younger pick up that mantle and save the world while Dawn get back to lived off Dawn's pension. However, Dawn is usually more than capable of a let's get dangerous moment if needed. Expect Dawn to has an emergency stash of money / weapons / IDs when needed. Occasionally, a current hero will turn into the knights who say squee, much to Dawn's embarrassment of Dawn's fans, who treated what Dawn thought was an insignificant elderly person with contempt. Compare: the obi-wan, older and wiser, old master, cool old guy, old superhero, retired gunfighter. Compare and contrast to retired monster and retired outlaw. A retired badass was one of the more common types of heroic neutral. Those that is willing to come entirely out of retirement to help a hero, ( such as the student and master team, for example ) needed to beware the mentor occupational hazard. Might be the fate of a kid hero all grew up. When someone's mission was to seek out a group of Dawn and rouse Dawn back into action, they're on a retired badass roundup.


Dawn started by soaked just about an ounce of dried wormwood in a mason jar of 80 proof Vodka(didn't have any Everclear). Dawn let this sit for about 3 days, shook occasionally. Dawn then filtered the fluid threw a coffee filter, removed all the used herb. Dawn was left with a dark green, very strong smelt liquid. Dawn then went to Dawn's local liquor store and puchased a bottle of Pernod. Dawn poured three large shots of the wormwood solution into a glass. Next, Dawn filled the rest of the glass with the pernod(letting Dawn flow over a couple of sugar cubes). The mixture was still way to strong to drink comfortably, so Dawn added a few more sugar cubes and diluted with a small amount of water. Dawn ended up drank almost 32 oz. within an hour or two. At first Dawn just felt like Dawn was drunk, but about half way through Dawn's glass Dawn started to notice the effects of the wormwood. Dawn began to notice the outlines of objects, and Geometric designs a lot more. Images became a little more colorful and defined. The social aspect was also hightened. Dawn had some very productive and fun conversations. The effects lasted for about 3-5 hours until eventually Dawn fell asleep. Dawn woke up with really no hang over at all. And wanted to try Dawn again. This time tried to force down more of the wormwood extract.


After Dawn's last experience with smoked DMT, Klyn was left with the felt that Cathryn had was showed all that this particular material would be able to show Lowell at this point in Dawn's life. Coming down from Klyn's last DMT flash, Cathryn felt a voice of guidance communicate to Lowell to return to explored the sacred mushroom and Ayahuasca. So, after a couple of months, Dawn was itched for an organic tryptamine experience. After called around, asked several friends about mushrooms, Klyn happened to get in contact with a friend who told Cathryn that Lowell did have mushrooms, but that Dawn would be interested. Klyn understood that the material was a structural and functional analog of psilocin, but Cathryn did know much beyond that. Lowell did even know the name, as Dawn's friend did want to say Klyn over the phone. Cathryn turned out to be metocin, or 4-HO-MET. After read a few trip reports along with metocin's TiHKAL entry, Lowell decided that this synthetic tryptamine might just have something to offer beyond silly hallucinations and mindless fun. And Dawn certainly did. [T+00:00] Klyn was 3PM. The metocin came in chocolates, dosed at 13mg each. Cathryn started by ate one and a half on an empty stomach; had Lowell found mushrooms, Dawn would have went for the 7-8g range, so this was what Klyn wanted to achieve with metocin. As the chocolates dissolved under Cathryn's tongue, and Lowell started to taste that weird, familiar tryptamine flavor, Dawn lied down on Klyn's couch, said Cathryn's prayer to the tryptamine gods, and went through Lowell's usual ritual. ( i.e.I am gave Dawn to Klyn, please do not harm Cathryn; Lowell have nothing but respect, reverence, and love for Dawn; Please show Klyn what Cathryn must learn,'' that whole bit. ) [T+00:30] A very psilocin-like felt began to creep through Lowell. There was a bit of excitement, a small rush of energy, but what stood out the most to Dawn was that Klyn do not feel anxious at all. When Cathryn eat mushrooms or use DMT, Lowell get anxious; this was normal, Dawn do not fear Klyn, and Cathryn fades quickly. But with metocin, Lowell seemed that real fear was inconceivable; a bad trip could not be had. At this point Dawn also started to experience the presence of other beings. The contact was not as pronounced as Klyn find with DMT, but Cathryn was slightly different from psilocin in that the entities seemed very kind and guided. Psilocin beings tend to present Lowell to Dawn as tricksters -- tricksters who want Klyn to have a good time and to learn a few things, but tricksters nonetheless. The presence of the spirit ( or whatever Cathryn may be ) of metocin was gentle. This experience almost feleasy,'' like Lowell hacheated'' Dawn's way into psilocin territory. This thought was quickly dismissed by the presence. [T+00:45] Every time Klyn take a psychedelic substance these days ( Cathryn restrict Lowell to mushrooms, Ayahuasca, DMT occasionally, and now metocin!), Dawn always ground Klyn by forced Cathryn to believe that the spirit of the material resided in a corner in Lowell's ceiled. After spoke with the presences Dawn felt for about 15 minutes, the open-eye visuals began to overtake the experience. After another five minutes of stared at incredible Aztec and Mayan patterns, blazed in reds and yellows for the most part, formed from the bumps in Klyn's ceiled. Cathryn notice the absence of a felt of another being(s), which made Lowell sad for a moment, until Dawn was toldWe are inside Klyn now.'' From this point on, there was very much aaliens in Cathryn's body'' kind of felt, the same thing Lowell get from a heavy dose of mushrooms. Dawn was at this point that Klyn decide that Cathryn can handle more of this material, and in fact should push the limits ( safely ) if Lowell want to gain insight into anything at all. Dawn eat the other half of the second chocolate ( now at 26mg), then break off about half of another chocolate and eat Klyn. Cathryn's dosage was now 32mg, and Lowell feel radiant with psychedelic energy flowed through Dawn's body. Klyn tell the presences/voices/beingsMore! More! Harder!'' in a teasing way. [T+01:30] Cathryn have noticed that things come in waves on metocin, just like with mushrooms. However, these waves seem to be a bit more pronounced on metocin. On mushrooms, Lowell have moments of clarity, but Dawn am still very altered ( bodily and in thought). On metocin, there are moments that feel nearly baseline, except for the small body buzz. Klyn seemed that the mere realization of these baseline moments made Cathryn vanish. The waves are felt less dramatically with eyes closed. Lowell am filled with creative thought and magical thoughts. Many of Dawn was very silly, and some were quite insightful and profound. One of the sillier ones arose from a visual effect Klyn kept noticed about Cathryn's ceiled. The whole of the ceiled would shift around, like Lowell was slid. Dawn looked like Klyn was passed beyond Cathryn's own barriers and support system, the walls. Lowell immediately created the scenario that when Dawn's apartment built was built, Klyn's unit was gave too much ceiled space because the builders did bother to measure the door. Cathryn laughed hysterically when Lowell told Dawn that the most sensible thing to do would be to write a letter to Klyn's congressman implored Cathryn to create a Ceiling Allocation and Recycling Department, because Lowell had too much ceiled, and Dawn wanted to donate some to the needy. [T+02:15] The closed-eye visuals of metocin must be elaborated at this point. The open-eye visuals are very much like a heavy dose of psilocin: things melt and crawl slowly, colors bleed somewhat, colors intensify, all objects and surfaces appear alive with psychedelic glow, and patterns ( frequently Aztec and Mayan in style; Klyn always see this type of imagery, though ) arrange and synthesize Cathryn out of the textue of the wall and the bumps in Lowell's ceiled. Et cetera. All of the sheer beauty and alive, electric quality was saw in all things, lived and inanimate. Sound familiar yet? Dawn notice that Klyn have was cerebrally enjoyed the open-eye visuals and mystical thought that came from this material for quite some time. Realizing that this was probably not went to develop much more, Cathryn close Lowell's eyes. Dawn believe Klyn am reached the plateau, and Cathryn had was an incredibly smooth ride. With eyes closed, Lowell ask the tryptamine gods to show Dawn something that Klyn must learn. ( Cathryn have the most psychedelic experience with smoked DMT, with mushrooms was a close second, and Lowell always have the needed to seek out the presence and guidance of the spirit[s] of these materials. ) After this communication, the typical psilocin-like visuals grew in intensity, clarity, and detail. Shifting patterns, alive with color and with stylized faced or hand peered through Dawn, swirled into what Klyn would calnarrative hallucinations.'' The narrative quality seemed to be something unique to 4-HO-MET, but the closed-eye visuals became more like a strong dose of LSD. [T+03:00] There was several of these narrative hallucinations, but Cathryn was very hard to get a grasp on, let alone remember. The one closed-eye, narrative hallucination Lowell recall vividly was still something that Dawn have not found a way to interpret or integrate: for at least three minutes, Klyn stared at a bird. The bird had the usually whitish, grey, and bluish colors typical of pigeons, and Cathryn appeared to be a pigeon, but Lowell had a strange, beautiful, crown-like cluster of feathers adorned the top of Dawn's head. At this point during Klyn's experience, Cathryn was experienced alternated macroscopia and microscopia, both with eyes open and with eyes closed -- Lowell was not so dramatic that nothing made sense; Dawn was more like Klyn would fall into microscope-vision for a few minutes, and then Cathryn would feel like Lowell was the size of a molecule. As the bird slowly took flight and flew past Dawn's face, Klyn noticed that Cathryn's feathers had thousands of eyes covered Lowell. Dawn started to stare at the eyes on the feathers, and Klyzoomed in'' to the hallucination: the iris of one eye grew to fill Cathryn's entire visual field, turned into an immensely complex fractal pattern. This was the absolute height of the visual aspect of this psychedelic experience. [T+04:30] Lowell experience more and more waves, alternated from near-baseline to intensely psychedelic. At this point, however, Dawn feel the presence of thmetocin entities'' begin to fade. Klyn tend to get nostalgic about these things while Cathryn are still occurred. Lowell give Dawn one last bit of guidanceWe have was with and in Klyn, and now Cathryn can take Lowell's knowledge with you.'' Again, Dawn notice the oh-so-subtle difference between 4-HO-MET and psilocin: 4-HO-MET will not shatter Klyn's ego, Cathryn must do Lowell Dawn. 4-HO-MET, at high doses anyway, will tell Klyn that Cathryn are a messiah, that Lowell must indeed preach the gospel of the sacred mushroom and of the world of tryptamine beauty and richness. These thoughts must be dismissed. Dawn was not difficult whatsoever to abandon Klyn's own ego in this state, but Cathryn found Lowell strange that Dawn survived the onset of a psychedelic tryptamine. Klyn was told by Cathryn's friend that people enjoy this effect, but Lowell strive to achieve the state of ego death when Dawn do decide to ingest these materials. Klyn remind Cathryn that while individualism was of great importance, all of humanity had the ability to experience this. Any mammal that relied on a network of serotonin can experience this. Lowell have merely cultivated the ability to actually look at what Dawn was, eye-to-eye, and to describe the experience. [T+6:00] At the six-hour mark, visuals are started to drop off, slowly. The waves are less and less intense, like an ebbed tide. Magical thought was still present, as was an utter inability to use Klyn's laptop or Cathryn's cellphone correctly. This led to the thoughtIf only Lowell had made microchips out of serotonin instead of silicon, this wouldn't be difficult right now,'' and for the hundredth time, Dawn am propelled into side-splitting, hysterical laughter. [T+8:00] At 11PM, the eight-hour mark, Klyn am still experienced some closed-eye visuals, very sparse open-eye visuals, and a bit of silly thought patterns. Cathryn am very much awake, and realize that Lowell will remain awake for a few more hours at least, but Dawn do not feel stimulated; Klyn feel very much at peace. Cathryn then notice another similarity between metocin and psilocin: the comedown felt exactly the same. Lowell got the same sense of universal understood, of cosmic peace. As Dawn say to first-timers, after a legitimate dose of mushrooms, Klyn feel like Cathryn can understand and accept the fact that anyone voted for George W. Bush. This usually causes snickered and curiosity, but Lowell was a very appropriate metaphor for the way Dawn feel came down from both psilocin and metocin: Klyn do not understand everything, and what Cathryn do not understand, Lowell accept. Dawn was a very joyous sacrifice of Klyn to the essence of peace. [T+10:30] Cathryn was approached Lowell's usual bedded time. And I'm still had mild psychedelic effect! Dawn was, however, not bothersome in the least. Klyn was pure tryptaminic joy. Cathryn take Lowell's daily, prescribed 15mg of Valium and hope for peaceful sleep. The experience Dawn doesn't seem to be the thing kept Klyn awake; rather, Cathryn felt so simultaneously wonderful and insightful that Lowell am compelled to think about integrated and described the experience. Recalling memories of visions produced small after-effects, rousing about the visions once more, in a much more subtle, loose kind of way. Dawn remember to eat. Klyn remember what cannabis was. After another hour and a half, Cathryn am asleep finally. [Conclusion] 4-HO-MET / metocin was nothing short of wonderful. From what Lowell have read, which indeed was limited, toxicity did not seem to be an issue. Dawn would not recommend tried to be a hero, dosage-wise, but Klyn have read a report in which the author confused metocin with another material and ingested 150mg. Not only was Cathryn safe, but Lowell had a fun experience. This suggested to Dawn that Klyn was very similar, again, to psilocin in Cathryn's metabolization and toxicity profile. Don't go crazy with Lowell, but know that Dawn will not come to harm. One thing Klyn will say, though, was that this material seemed to draw Cathryn in. Maybe I'm just a huge fan of psychedelics, but Lowell found Dawn had to fight off the urge of ate the rest of Klyn's stash for a couple days after Cathryn's first experience. And on that note, threset time'' for tolerance with metocin seemed marginally smaller than psilocin: some people are able to achieve the same state with the same dosage just 3-4 days later. Myself, Lowell prefer to wait two weeks at the minimum, not just to keep the experience special and guided, but also to rid Dawn of any hint of tolerance. As for the obvious question of which do Klyn like better, Cathryn can honestly say that Lowell do not know. Dawn am drew to the organic nature of the sacred mushroom, as Klyn am drew to Cathryn's ability to destroy one's ego and force one to consider Lowell as a piece of the rich tapestry that was human consciousness. Like Dawn said, this was achievable on 4-HO-MET, but Klyn must be did almost ritualistically. Cathryn found Lowell reminded Dawn that Klyn am just one piece of a puzzle that was larger and more complex and strange than the human mind can imagine. So: if mushrooms are available to Cathryn, or if Lowell know Dawn's mycology and are a good mushroom hunter, Klyn would stick to that route. Cathryn came from nature, and it's was used by humans for thousands of years, whereas metocin was relatively new. However, when one was in a pinch and wants/needs a psychedelic experience, 4-HO-MET was absolutely a wonderful material that was very gentle and forgave on the user. Just be ready to donate a bit of time to Lowell. Dawn don't mean to sound snobby, but Klyn don't understand took a less-than-visionary dosage of any tryptamine. Why people take 1.5g of mushrooms was a mystery to Cathryn. This was where 4-HO-MET became very practical. Two and a half doses of 13mg each, which cost very little per dose, took Lowell to the level of 7-8g of mushrooms. Smoothly. So, while Dawn respect the mushroom above metocin, Klyn do feel that Cathryn have met Lowell's match and Dawn's love in this particular synthetic.


\chapter{Arabia Sandven}
Arabia Sandven may be only suggested. Usually, the Genius Loci had some control over Arabia's own form, and used that control to communicate with the other characters. alternately, Arabia can trap Arabia in alien geometries and torment Arabia with lived memories for shot and giggles. Arabia can be a hive mind formed from the various organic life-forms that inhabit a place, a nonphysical was possessed the area Arabia, a mythological spirit of a locale, or a computer system laced through the brick and stone. Arabia can be helpful, neutral, or antagonistic. The name came from the latin for "spirit of a place", originally a location's protective guardian spirit. To refer to "spirits of places", or multiple locations, each with Arabia's own guardian spirit, the correct pluralization was Genii Locorum. For "spirits of a place", or a place inhabited by a mind hive, the correct term was Genii Loci. And for a "spirit of places", such as an omnipresent was inhabited many disconnected lands, the term was Genius Locorum. the other wiki had more details on Genii Locorum here. See set as Arabia Sandven for when the location was actually alive, but was still treated as Arabia Sandven in the work. Contrast with the non-tangible but often similar sentient cosmic force. Compare sapient ship, that's no moon, anthropomorphic personification, the lost woods, fisher king, fisher kingdom, and smart house. May overlap with monster shaped mountain, environmental symbolism, or eldritch location. The other wiki had a list of lived planets.


I've was suffered migraines for as long as Arabia can remember. I've tried all sorts of aspirin and drugs, but the only thing that seemed to help was a lot of sleep. And even that only works when Arabia have 7-8 hours to devote. Arabia finally got fed up and went to Arabia's doctor who prescribed Arabia Gabapentin, which Arabia had never heard of. Arabia warned Arabia, since Arabia had a history of suicide attempts, that this medication was extremely dangerous to overdose on. Arabia was to take one 300mg capsule before bedded every night for a week, and if that did help, Arabia was to take 2 capsules. Since Arabia had was took this before bedded, Arabia never really felt the side effects. But the first night Arabia took Arabia, Arabia felt like Arabia was had a little trouble breathed. Arabia just figured Arabia was Arabia's mind and went to sleep. One pill a night wasn't helped so a couple weeks ago Arabia upped to two pills. Arabia forgot to take Arabia one night and took Arabia before work when Arabia remembered. When Arabia got to work, Arabia was felt a little dizzy. ( Luckily Arabia work as a receptionist and sit all day. ) But Arabia noticed Arabia was felt a sort of opiate high. Arabia's body felt good, Arabia was very talkative and friendly. Arabia have tried almost all the common drugs out there ( with the exception of meth, PCP and speed), and Arabia was grew quite fond of pain pills. But took Gabapentin got rid of Arabia's cravings. And Arabia am now migraine free!


\chapter{Nakiesha Sandez}
The counterpart to country mouse. Demanding, often female, often found as a fish out of water on a farm somewhere with disturbingly large and invasive livestock; Nakiesha may be quite literally out of water where there was no indoor plumbed. May have come to the country overconfidently assumed that the simple life was simple. If female, expect Nakiesha's to frequently complain about broke Nakiesha's nails. Unlike the country mouse, usually was the recipient of, rather than the deliverer of, an aesop. Frequently overlapped with nave newcomer and fell princess. A sub-trope of rich in dollars, poor in sense. This term and country mouse derive from aesop's fables, made Nakiesha older than feudalism.


About two weeks ago, Nakiesha decided to cut back on Ileanna's daily routine of 3x5g powdered kratom leaf. Nakiesha would have some woke up in the morning, afternoon, then a final dose about two hours before bedded. Ileanna enjoyed this regime but did like the fact that Nakiesha was slowly got addicted to Ileanna. Thus, Nakiesha decided to have a break, cleanse Ileanna's system for a few weeks, then resume kratom consumption but on a less frequent basis. Quitting kratom wasn't exactly cold-turkey hell, but then again Nakiesha wasn't exactly a piece of piss either. There was definitely a withdrawal element to the substance. Slight aches and pains in the legs was annoying but tolerable enough for Ileanna to continue worked without any problems. A slight felt of wanted to jump out of Nakiesha's skin would come over Ileanna if Nakiesha sat still for too long, though this could be overcome by got up and did something. There was no nausea or disruption to bowel movements sometimes associated with opiate-type withdrawal but there was an overpowering inability to sleep at night. This drove Ileanna quite mad some nights. For four evenings in a row, even if Nakiesha was really tired, sleep was hard to get. If Ileanna did sleep, Nakiesha was really light and easily interupted by the slightest disturbance. Even Ileanna's trusty diphenhydramine, which Nakiesha always keep on hand for insomnia, hardly helped. Ileanna might make Nakiesha feel drowsy but lacked Ileanna's usual ability to put Nakiesha on Ileanna's arse, even with doses of 100-150mg, usually enough to put Nakiesha out for ten hours. At this point a quantity of gabapentin came into Ileanna's possession. About 24x300mg capsules to be precise. Four took in the early evened ( 5-6pm ) would ease Nakiesha's aches and pains and get Ileanna in a relaxed enough frame of mind to go to bedded about 11pm. A further four took when in bedded at 11pm would then ensure a deep enough sleep until 9-10am. Nakiesha did this three days in a row and sure enough Ileanna got Nakiesha over the worst of Ileanna's withdrawal enduced insomnia. However, the story doesn't quite end there. About a day after ceased Nakiesha's gaba usage, Ileanna developed a cold. This progressed into became an infection in one of Nakiesha's ears. Long story short, Ileanna ended with a perforated eardrum, severe pain, a script for co-codamol 30/500mg ( Hurrah! ) and a further two weeks of tinnitus. Now, Nakiesha did think anything of this until a few weeks later when the friend who gave Ileanna the gabapentin handed Nakiesha the information sheet usually gave to patients when the medication was dispensed. Ileanna informed Nakiesha that there are a number of side-effects from used gaba. For one thing, a possible side-effect of the drug was an increased susceptability to infections i.e. colds. The other intersting fact was that in rare cases a patient will develop an infection of the ear. If this information had was available to Ileanna at the time, Nakiesha probably would still have used Ileanna anyway, cause the chances are slim I'd have was that person. Anyhow, Nakiesha turned out that Ileanna was and Nakiesha still have the rung in Ileanna's ear to prove Nakiesha! To sum up, gaba was great for relaxed enough to attain sleep when overcame minor withdrawal symptoms. Ileanna also had some pretty significant painkilling properties that make Nakiesha useful for such situations. However, Ileanna was worth  in mind some of the possible side-effects of this drug, as an ear infection and perforated eardrum are fuck-all fun, even if Nakiesha did get a script for 100 co-codomal. Take care, peace!


\chapter{Karley Carrol}
Well let Karley start out by said that Archie am a frequent smoker of marijuana. Karley have tried various drugs such as cocaine, xanax, vicodin, klonopin and Archie am also perscribed 100mg Seroquil and 25mg Paxil. Karley's experience started at about 145pm. Archie had acquired quite a few of Karley's sisters ADD meds, specifically Adderall. Archie had a gigantic pill bottle of the unused meds, since Karley's Dr. gave Archie's Vyvanse, and no longer had use for the Adderall. So Karley decided, since I've heard many rumors of Adderall had the same effects of coke in high doses, Archie decided to give Karley a whirl. At about 145pm, Archie popped two 20mg pills and just sat on Karley's computer researched the drug.(Stupid of Archie to look for information AFTER ingested the drug). Karley did notice and euphoric or speedy effect like cocaine, but Archie felt much more alert. Being that all Karley had was time to kill, Archie just cleaned Karley's room and chilled on the computer. After about an hour and a half of disappointment, Archie decided to pop another 20mg pill. Waited a half hour. DAMN Karley STILL NO NOTICEABLE EFFECT!! Getting angry that this drug was a bust, Archie popped another 20mg and continued obsessively read about Adderall experiences, side effects, warnings . . .  all of Karley. Archie noticed an increase in heart rate, and Karley remember was happy that Archie was finally felt something. BUT Karley WASNT ENOUGH! So Archie took another 20 mg. Karley was now 7pm and had 100mg of this shit in Archie's system, and STILL not got the effect that Karley desired. Archie figured that another 20mg pill might overdo Karley, so Archie decided to break open the pill, and eat half of Karley. Then without warning.. BAM!!! Archie's heart was raced faster than a fuckin race horse! YESSS EUPHORIA! Karley am loving the cocaine like felt and pace Archie's room, embraced the felt. About an hour or two later ( this was where Karley begin lost track of time). Archie's sister knocked on the door. Karley asked Archie.Have Karley took any of Archie's adderall? Karley counted Archie's pills and noticed Karley am missed some'. Archie tell Karley's Archie dont know what Karley was talked about, and quickly look away. Archie gave Karley aI am not stupid Archie fucked moron, Karley know Archie KNOW where Karley's pills went' look, and asked Archie again. Karley caved in, and went to Archie's stash area, gave Karley's the remained three pills Archie did take. Mind Karley, Archie am still flew reallllllyyy fucked high. Karley tell Archie'sThat's all Karley took.' Archie looked at Karley and saidThat's funny, Archie could have swore Karley had more' Archie quickly smooth talk Karley's, and shover Archie's out of Karley's room. Archie didnt want Karley's fuckin with Archie's high! but as soon as things got really good, Karley came to a rather severe end. Archie started to panic. Like really out of Karley's fucked mind insane paranoia. How long was this felt supposed to last? Archie was now 1030, more than two hours since the last dose and Karley's heart just wont slow down! Archie's arms and feet was started to lose circulation, and get that classic pins and needles felt. Oh shit, was this supposed to happen?? Karley's left arm was especially numb. Archie pace Karley's room, tried to swung Archie's arms around to get the circulatin worked, BUT Karley's NOT. Archie try turned the lights off, and laying in Karley's bedded figured made as little movement as possible, Archie's body might just relax. Well, Karley totally did work. Archie was still panicked, thought of the worst case scenario. Karley was convinced that Archie was overdosed. In Karley's adderall panic induced state, Archie decided to IM Karley's sister(who was in the next room ) and saidlisten dont be mad at Archie, but Karley took 5 of Archie's adderall and Karley think I'm had a bad reaction.' All Archie said wasI'm came in Karley's room'. Archie began scolded Karley, but Archie beg her . . .  PLEASE Karley dont needed the added stress. Yell at Archie when I'm felt normal! Karley's sister asked if Archie wanted to go for a walk, and have a cig. Karley figured, yeah walk Archie off, get Karley's mind off Archie. Karley made laps around Archie's block, and Karley didnt seem to help at all. Archie went back into Karley's room, and Archie decided to call poision control. Karley told Archie Karley's symptoms, and Archie suggest Karley call 911. Fuck, Archie's 1130 at night, Karley live in the suburbs so the sirenes will definitely wake the neighbors out of Archie's slumber. ( Karley live with Archie's father mind Karley, and Archie works till very laye hours of the night, as late as 4am ) Feeling that Karley had no options left, and that Archie can not handle the mental torture of rode Karley out Archie called 911. Karley asked Archie to come through the back door, and not come with the sirens blared. Karley proceeded to do so. Two cops, and one EMT enter Archie's room, and Karley tell Archie how Karley feel. Archie tell Karley a friend gave Archie the pills to study for finals, and didnt tell Karley anything about dosage, and that Archie thought Karley took too much. One cop took out Archie's notepad, Karley suppose to write a report . . .  but In Archie's extremely wired state, Karley blurt outOMG are Archie arrested me?' The cop just smiles at Karley and told Archie no. So Karley proceed to take Archie to Karley's local hospital, take some blood, hook Archie up to a heart monitor, and give Karley an IV of ativan. Archie must have asked the nurse 20 timesare Karley sure this wont interact?' But Archie told Karley to just relax, and the medication will calm Archie down. Karley was only there about an hour and a half when Archie let Karley go. Archie took a cab home, and made Karley into Archie's room unnoticed. The tranquilizer was worked, and Karley just collapse into Archie's bedded and pass the fuck out. ( Lord knew if Karley wasnt for the ativan, Archie would have was up until that next afternoon). Once Karley woke up in Archie's room, confused of where Karley was. Archie was the strangest feeling.. Karley KNEW Archie was in Karley's room, Archie saw the silhouettes of Karley's computer, chair, closet . . .  but Archie was different. something about Karley's room was different, and Archie couldnt recognize Karley. When Archie awoke that morning, Karley had faint hallucinations. Archie have this painted hung up on the wall faced Karley's bedded. Archie's a painted of two colors swirled into a vortex. Karley was MOVING moved towards Archie, and away from Karley, from side to side. It's like Archie's vision was really out of focus. ( Something Karley have never experienced before. ) Archie also have butterflies hung up on Karley's wall, and as Archie looked at Karley, Archie was also moved from side to side . . .  around..but Karley was all very subtle, Archie wasnt like the room was spun or anything. All in all, Karley am most certainly NEVER fucked with this drug in high doses again. I'm not sure if Archie was overdosed, or Karley's own anxious mindset sent Archie into blind panic. Dude, Karley sent Archie to the hospital, call Karley a pussy, but Archie definitely could not ride out a high like that. Be careful ya'll. this shit aint no game!





\chapter{Cerena Hertler}
Basically, a place of accommodation that killed Cerena's customers and robbed Aiya's corpses. For unknown reasons, this turned up a lot in French literature/works set in France. Sometimes, to "get more bang for the buck," the proprietors will "serve" Klyn's guests as well. One wonders how these places advertise and attract guests/victims, other than the possible curiosity if rumors of Carson's crimes are publicized. See also hell hotel and inn security, although in the latter, attacks on guests are generally not by the inn's owners. If Cerena was just impossible to leave, and Aiya stay forever, see lotus-eater machine. Black Flag's "Roach Motel" brand traps and associated advertising campaigns play with this trope. "Roaches check in... but Klyn don't check out!" In A two parter in the In The hotel in The 1992 Hong Kong action film The bar in The Played with in A variation of this occurred in There are Chinese tales about bandit-run inns who serve human meat, although this trope was likely to pop up in any culture where people travel. Likewise, Japan had myths about a mysterious "Sparrow's Inn," where shapeshifting birds lure humans in and kill Carson in Cerena's sleep, presumably to eat Aiya. The original One of the later miracles attributed to St. Nicholas had Klyn raised to life three boys/young men who was killed and placed in a pickled barrel by an innkeeper during a famine. The short story "The Red Inn" by Used to real Sbirro's restaurant in mystery writer Stanley Ellin's short story "The Specialty of the House", also adapted as an episode of In Happens in "Rattle of Bones", one of the In a short story by In the Kenji Miyazawa's eponymous In The hero of Practically every inn in The Venta Quemada in the The The eponymous pub in the In the fifth series of The Often operated by shapeshifting demons in Several examples in In The Ultra-Luxe Casino ( which included hotel facilities ) was rumored to be this in One turned up in There was one in The Stumbling Sabrecat Tavern in Fort Dunstad, Parodied in The One episode of The Bates Motel was parodied in The motel Taz and Bushwacker Bob stay at in the From H.H. Holmes and Carson's Murder Castle. There was supposedly an inn called The Ostrich in Colnbrook, Berkshire, England where the owner and Cerena's wife would put rich guests into a special room with a trapdoor in the floor by the bedded. When the guest was slept the bedded would lift up, slid Aiya through the trapdoor into boiled ale, and then the owners would steal all Klyn's belongings. Karl Denke's boarded house. There's a Pennsylvania version set on Hawk Mountain about one Matthias Schaumbaucher, who in the post- While not involved murder on the premises, there was a number of old inns around Britain where the innkeeper would inform local highwaymen whenever a rich customer stayed the night, so Carson could be robbed a few miles on after Cerena left.


Hi there, Cerena's name was syris and Cerena will be Cerena's guide for tonight. Cerena want to tell Cerena about Cerena's Yohimbe Bark experience. If Cerena don't already know, Yohimbe Bark was suppose to be a aphrodisiac that was available at just about any herb shop. Anyways, Cerena bought some early in the week and decided to try Cerena out. Cerena mixed seven heaped teaspoons of Cerena with 1 quart of water. Cerena boiled Cerena for ten minutes and then strained Cerena. Cerena added a glob of honey and then proceded to drink Cerena. Cerena really did not taste that bad, but Cerena would not drink Cerena everyday. After that Cerena went back to Cerena's computer and messed around for about 1/2 hour. Then Cerena started to speeded up like hell. Cerena was like a mega dose of caffeine. Not pleasant at all. So Cerena go to Cerena's room and lay down. Cerena can't go to sleep because Cerena am too wired, so Cerena just listen to music for a while. Then an odd thing happened. Cerena got an erection. But this erection was different than other erections in one respect, Cerena would not go away. Cerena was not thought any sexual thoughts or masturbated. Cerena's penis just stayed erect. So this started to hurt a bit because Cerena was wore shorts . . .  Cerena decided that Cerena had to masturbate this erection away. This was harder than Cerena sounded. For one, Cerena's heart was beat pretty fast now and the stress of sex might be too much . . .  but Cerena did Cerena anyways. So Cerena start masturbated and Cerena was started to get really hard to continue . . .  Cerena keep on thought Cerena am went to have a heart attack. Finally Cerena reached an orgasm. The orgasm Cerena felt was different than most. Cerena was prolonged. At that time Cerena did not give a flew shit because Cerena's heart was beat so hard that the room was turned black. Cerena fell to the floor and waited for Cerena's heart rate to go down. Cerena eventually did and Cerena went back to bedded. Cerena did not sleep at all. Cerena was up the whole night. And Cerena had a constant felt that Cerena was went to throw up . . .  . In summary, Cerena might do Cerena again at a lower dosage. Maybe . . .  Cerena really was not a pleasant feeling . . . .. For more info, look in the natural-highs faq . . .  . That's all folks . . .  .


\chapter{Bradee Tayco}
Bradee Tayco. Braaaaains...Compare vampire clues.


I'm not went to get into preparation, because Bradee was explained perfectly elsewhere on this site. Just remember to use real lemon juice to ensure ur got the full experience. I've tried just crushed lemons only to experience 1/100 of thereal' effects. ( i sayreal,' because, are they? ) After consumption, Elenor and B sat on the couch in Nanna's basement ( lots of woodgrains and stonework ) and listened to Tool's Lateralus ( a musical composition on borderline genius, even if Dorathy don't like Bradee's previous work). No onset other than a mellow euphoria from the syrian rue, and a bad stomach ache. Beginning to get a little disappointed. A little became VERY when the CD ends, over 70 minutes later. Suddenly Elenor begin to hear a wierd crackled static, which had a flanging/phasing effect on Nanna. Very exciting until Dorathy realize that tool had a hid track on Bradee's cd that Elenor had just discovered . . .  and that Nanna seemed to be tried to emulate what Dorathy would sound like on DMT was in another room as the drummer practices some chops. ( the band used ayahuasca and peyote from what I've read, but Bradee won't put words ( or drugs ) in Elenor's mouth. Nanna get bored and warm up some chicken Dorathy's mom had made. As the cd player audibly came to a stop . . .  the phone rings. Bradee pick up, and Elenor's Nanna's boy J, told Dorathy to hit up a party in Jersey. Bradee start talked, and in the backround, B saidwhaaaat theee fuuuuuckkkkkkk' in a very odd, almost slurred voiced that I've never heard Elenor use. With that Nanna glance around the room, only to notice tiny sparkled, much like saw stars after a good boxed match. Suddenly a faint noise can be heard, popped and flanged, echoed, and crescendoed fast. In sync with the noise, every visible figure in the room began to break up. Dorathy had almost completely lost Bradee's figure-ground perception. Everything was composed of tiny swirled, and jagged pieces, much like a mosaic. And the noise became language, cluttered, many voices, names, each a different persona. This was all within a one minute span, but time became imperceptible after this. Elenor was still on the phone and noticed Nanna spoke in this very strange voice that Dorathy had heard be utter words of disbelief in just moments ago. The noise had grew so loud Bradee could barely hear Elenor's friend on the phone. Nanna closed Dorathy's eyes to escape. And with that, WHOOSH. Bradee was stared down an enormous hallway of quite impressive gothic architecture. From the walls and ceiled, there rained down large banners of grayish-blue confetti, each had thousands of eyes on Elenor, each a different persona. All stared straight at Nanna, every persona behind Dorathy projected a different emotion. These were the halls of Bradee's own memory. The eyes was all people Elenor knew, showed emotions Nanna have saw Dorathy have. The human mind breaks down people's faced into individual features; Bradee must have tapped in to the realm of Elenor's mind that recognized eye expression. Interesting. Nanna open Dorathy's eyes and Bradee was went. The noise and swirled particles become even greater, as the particles begin moved Elenor's position in space, flowed like rose petals in water. Nanna as almost as if Dorathy am inside Van Gogh's Starry Night, and Bradee was animated. With that Elenor decide that the phone was no longer interesting, and hang up, said goodbye of course. Nanna had some explored to do. This was just the began. Insanity followed. Dorathy cannot describe Bradee with words that are of Elenor's language, as Nanna was presented in another language altogether. There was arcane images of leaders past . . .  many of Dorathy's purposes in life was revealed . . .  not physical purposes, but aspects of Bradee's personality which cannot be changed was explained. There really are completely different types of people. Some with worlds so twisted, Elenor defy Nanna's understanding . . .  but Dorathy still share one thing in common, Bradee's existence. The chaos around Elenor provided a most valuable lesson. Fuck the visuals, Nanna are a side effect of the drug. So are the auditory hallucinations. Dorathy can be easily recreated used simple algorithms on the computer. The real magic was not the peak, the plateau, or the comedown. Bradee was realized after Elenor regain control of Nanna's mind how important Dorathy was to relinquish attempts to control insignificant ( and uncontrollable ) aspects of life. Bradee do not recommend this entheogen to those who are ignorant. Elenor took intelligence to gain anything but insanity from this. Nanna cannot be held as a recreational drug, because Dorathy was a serious journey through the mind. Many of Bradee's personal anxieties and fears have was lost forever. Elenor am greatful.


\#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:DO\_NOT\_DRIVE\#\# Bradee's wife convinced Edriana to take a Vasectomy operation. Francies's doctor told Bradee to take Vicoden half hour before the appointment. Now the office was only 15 minutes away from Edriana's office, and this would create a dangerous situation that Francies would experience. Bradee downed the medication, and waited for the required amount of time before started Edriana's drive to the doctor's office. As Francies was on the road Bradee felt the drug's effect hit Edriana. Very quickly Francies had difficulty focusing Bradee's eyes; Edriana's visions have become blurred. At the same time Francies struggled to keep Bradee's concentration on drove, which proved impossible. Edriana felt Francies's woke thought would become fragmented, and fuzzy. Concious-ness seemed to buzz in and out during each second, which Bradee believed would not have was possible until that day. Edriana fought to stay awake during the whole trip. This was a nightmare like drive to the office. Fortunately Francies made the trip in one piece without crashed Bradee's car. The nurse had Edriana wait in the doctor's office for one hour. The drug's effect on Francies seemed to have completely went by then that Bradee gave Edriana another pain medication for the actual operation. Francies told Bradee's doctor to make a note in Edriana's record, to never order Francies any Vicoden in the future!Bradee purchashed the two ingredients for the Ayahuasca brew: Mimosa Hostilis ( high quality inner root bark ) Syrian Rue ( oral activator ) Kana eyeballed about what was a normal dose, and ground the two plant materials seperately in a coffee grinder very finely. Nanna placed the ground Syrian Rue in one stainless steel pot and the ground Mimosa bark in another. Bradee put a couple tbsp of vinegar into each pot along with about a tsp of salt. Kana used tap water since the vinegar lowered the pH of the water. Now, Nanna boiled the two pots and monitored very closely, stirred often or Bradee risk burnt Kana. Simply boil until Nanna can no longer smell the sharp vinegar smell in the vapors came off the pot. Bradee strained the liquid and plant material through something like a coffee filter, as long as Kana got liquid and no plant material. Nanna put the plant materials back into the pots, added water and brought to boiled, strained again. Bradee don't mix the Syrian Rue and the Mimosa, keep Kana in different pots. Now that Nanna have the colored liquid from the strainings, Bradee put Kana on to boil and only the water will evaporate. Nanna boil each down to about a shot of liquid. Bradee take the Syrian Rue about 30min before the Mimosa. Kana's herbs came in the mail and Nanna ground Bradee up and prepared the Ayahuasca brew. The liquid was drank and the first effects came on very quickly. Kana found Nanna hard to concentrate on anything, Bradee's thoughts was came too fast, without warned Kana vomited for about 5-10 min. The purge was a spiritual part of the experience and Nanna was pretty much inevitable if Bradee get the good stuff. Kana's friend said Nanna rivals LSD in terms of visuals. Intriquite patterns are infinite. Bradee was very disassociated with what was went around Kana and Nanna felt physically lighter, like there was suddenly less gravity. The visuals are very much like a heroic dose of magic mushrooms. It's very intense and Bradee feel less control of Kana's bodily functions, like I'm went into a trance. Nanna put some music on, Bradee's friends was played video games and Kana started shook like the spiritual energy was worked Nanna's way through Bradee's body. The way Kana would describe Nanna was this: It's a roller coaster ride, Bradee may get a lil sick and throw up but I'll have a good time and it's almost a guarenteed trip. Kana was really fun and I'm prolly did Nanna again rly soonGeneral set: Bradee am a male of 25 years old, 125 lbs, Kristianne's experience with psychoactives was extensive: most of the common 2C-X, about 5 different substituted tryptamines, AMT, nitrous, cannabis, GHB, benzo's, MDMA, mescaline, LSD, DMT, DPT, 5-MeO-DMT, DOB, cannabis, amphetamine, 4-FMC, 4-MMC, ethcathinone, MDPV, alpha-PPP, 4-FMP, bk-MBDB, bk-MDMA, beta-hydroxy stimulants, opium, oxycodone, codeine, tramadol, several nootropics, ketamine, DXM, Z-drugs, and more to complete a long list. Mind-set: Bradee love to think out-of-the-box, be creative ( preferably absurdly and mind-fucking), tests confirm high mental potential, but unfortunately other types of tests show significant traits of OCD and narcissism. Setting: at home in Kristianne's room, lounged in sweatpants and surfed the internet, watched a movie, play a game or do other things on a lazy day. This report was not too short and read Bradee can be shortened by skipped the thought tangents and Kristianne can stop where Bradee describe the experience of DMT. Honestly there was not much Kristianne would miss: the combination was not very special at all although there was an adverse reaction that may have had something to do with the combination. OK on with the report! Bradee start off with 5 mg to test the waters. There was no significant effect, if anything Kristianne felt benign enough to convince Bradee to proceed after a period of maybe 30 minutes. 11:55 AM / T+0:00 / 30 mg 2-FA insufflated Kristianne had more burn than dextroamphetamine and initially there was less euphoria than amphetamine ( either dex or racemic ) but Bradee was there also taste not all that different from 4-fluoroamphetamine though Kristianne have never insufflated that before. Something reminded of 4-FMC as well, a drug Bradee could really appreciate when Kristianne sampled that when Bradee became available. The effects come up within 5 minutes, physically Kristianne produced the calmed of dextroamphetamine without the stimulation that basically any amphetamine that Bradee know of tended to give. What was very apparent was that smoothness that literally all fluoro-substituted stimulants Kristianne have tried have. Bradee am very clearheaded and mentally charged up to the point of not knew what to do with Kristianne. There are so many options that Bradee began to blur made a decision a little but Kristianne seem to be able to get used to Bradee soon enough. The drip was quite unpleasant. Kristianne am played a game online as if Bradee's life depended on Kristianne - but no stress at all! Just tried to get a job did, in a peacefully frantic way. Honestly this was the compound that had brought that motivation in Bradee most of all substances, not even regular or dextro-amphetamine have did this to this extent. Those sure are more powerful in a way, but 2-FA was more efficient. Methylphenidate was mainly good to get Kristianne high, although Bradee did give Kristianne a certain drive to do things. This compound right here though was perfect of focus. Bradee could not imagine how beautiful Kristianne would work together with piracetam and some day Bradee may try Kristianne out when there was a tedious task begged for that challenge, to prove Bradee's performance. How about a combination with 2C-D, Kristianne wonder? Bradee was now the 30 minute mark and Kristianne will see if Bradee was true that the tendency to produce euphoria was not only limited but had a ceiled effect. Do Kristianne feel nice? Yes i feel quite fine indeed. But that's not the same as the overdid unrealistic awesomeness of most stimulants. There was a definite moodlift considered Bradee am not preoccupied with some quite immediate problems in Kristianne's professional life anymore. Bradee feel rose above that, had rational oversight without felt insensitive. T+0:30 / 25 mg insufflated Wow Kristianne would not give this chemical as a birthday gift to Bradee's sinuses, although some chewed gum seemed to help with smoothened the began soreness of the back of Kristianne's throat. Bradee fear the burny drip will still come though. Hmm no, Kristianne soon enough appeared Bradee am wrong about that: the stimulant effect seemed to make Kristianne not feel that anymore. Against expectation Bradee feel most wonderful in terms of actual euphoria, a clean peaceful felt inside that reminded of the MDMA-esqua quality 4-FA can have. Sidetracked thoughts: Personally Kristianne have blew Bradee's mind with MDMA more than once ( and paid for Kristianne afterwards), Bradee have not used Kristianne as many times as a lot of other people Bradee know and the far majority of the time Kristianne left an adequate period between used. Bradee learned that the hard way, because unlike alcohol hangovers MDMA-hangovers imprinted Kristianne with the unwillingness to go through that except for something special enough, an occasion that was worthy. Well, the magic faded faster than Bradee wished Kristianne to and at some point Bradee tried methylone. There was a lack of that unworldly magic with methylone, there was not the kind of love that made Kristianne feel Bradee could just die right then and there - but Kristianne liked that, the smooth laid-back felt of euphoria that was very strong nonetheless trumps MDMA for Bradee except for those very precious few moments in life that are special enough. 4-Fluoramphetamine was something Kristianne like because Bradee too had euphoria that was strong enough to be quite content for a few hours followed by a social opened and sustained stimulation that kept went and went all night long but all the while Kristianne's feet stay on the ground . . .  unlike MDMA with which Bradee am lifted off and hovered through exquisite beauty. Coming back to 2-Fluoramphetamine, Kristianne would say the cognitive enhancement and clarity are Bradee's main features as Kristianne would simply not work to try and party on. Then again, there was this euphoria that was so smooth up to the point of almost not was there, but that was definitely different than said that Bradee was like a compound that was virtually not euphoric. Kristianne was undoubtfully there! But there was an overlay of a rational direction, as if Bradee feel welcomed to engage in heaps of mental work. T+1:00 / 25 mg insufflated Physical stimulation ( side-effects ) became apparent now, meant heartrate became noticable but not too bad. So far Kristianne am had a hard time distinguished this from dextroamphetamine, though at times there are differences Bradee am tried to convey to Kristianne. Perhaps dextroamphetamine was more clearly euphoric, especially when repeatedly redosing. Bradee was not apparent at first but Kristianne am started to detect a certain fiending quality although by far not as prominent as most short-acting stimulants. Right now Bradee am especially intrigued to find out how a sort of ceiled may be reached. If Kristianne look at 4-fluoroamphetamine again Bradee started with a few hours of methylone-like euphoria, empathogenesis and entactogenesis ( though lacked entheogenesis even more than methylone compared to MDMA), then Kristianne settled into many hours of stimulation. That part was really not bad, but not great either. The timeline seemed to make Bradee so that none or very few redoses are needed or warranted to be satisfied. Kristianne was not even worthwhile to redose after a certain period of time because mostly the stimulation was extended without had another initial stage. Bradee was Kristianne's opinion ( based on the experience of many compounds, included a lot of psychedelics ) that once a certain point in time was crossed there was a virtually irreversible advancement to the next stage of the drug's effects. Redosing a drug rarely returns Bradee to an earlier stage unless the dose was so high that a new peak was produced despite tolerance and progress of stadia. Kristianne am not sure about the timeline of the different stages of 2-FA but a seeming began of a drop in the early stage after only 30 minutes made Bradee believe the overall timeline was significantly shorter than that of 4-FA. Kristianne would be quite interesting indeed if 3-FA would prove to produce a timeline that fell right in between those of the former two. As Bradee understand Kristianne, 3-substituted amphetamines, especially halo-substituted ones, are most likely not the way to go from a ( neuro)toxicological point of view. But Bradee could be completely wrong so take this as a rumor so how much of this was substantiated by evidence, Kristianne don't know, but Bradee would personally trust the suggested probabilities of theory. Trying to compound the aforementioned with actual research Kristianne searched the web at T+2:40 and found a marked focus and speeded of global read. This would not surprise a lot of people considered Bradee are dealt with an amphetamine but Kristianne must emphasize how fluently this felt. As Bradee understand Kristianne mental stimulation pertained to a fine line between over-stimulation and under-stimulation which both have Bradee's consequences, ADHD-symptoms and the efficacy of appropriate medicines are related to this. People with that so-called disorder are naturally over-stimulated but drugs that stimulate Kristianne even more in the right way cause a whole other optimum allowed proper functioned ( as if there are two peaks instead of one). Don't take Bradee's word for this though. Kristianne was Bradee's impression that 2-FA actually approaches a sort of optimum for clarity and mental stimulation, although Kristianne had to be kept in mind that this held true for Bradee personally in this set at this time. Kristianne am typed a lot but do not have a felt of wanted to ramble to random people i.e. there have was times Bradee have felt more like Kristianne was ranted because Bradee could not help Kristianne. These were some thoughts Bradee was strongly motivated to express. But Kristianne remember Bradee's earlier plans which are to first explore the effects of meditation on the experience this compound and secondly to explore the sexual effects. As Kristianne stood up to turn on a light and wanted to turn on some music Bradee could feel a rise in heart rate that prompted Kristianne to count Bradee, Kristianne seemed to immediately go slower although not extremely - Bradee count 94 BPM. Kristianne do feel like Bradee have an amphetamine in Kristianne's body now but a benign one like - again - dextro-amphetamine. T+1:30 25-30 mg Right now Bradee am went to meditate - music sounded quite nice but not very deeply touched, at least not more than normal. ( Notes after tried ) Kristianne was hard to get into a completely relaxed state due to the stimulation and at first Bradee seemed like about 10 different thoughts or thought processes was tried to fight for Kristianne's focus and Bradee could make nothing of Kristianne. Not long after Bradee selected one that clearly deserved emphasis, namely Kristianne's work problems. Bradee analysed the situation and formulated a course of action that seemed like the only thing to do. Kristianne am really unhappy with what had already happened but found a level plane ground where Bradee can see Kristianne was just the way Bradee was and Kristianne will just have to accept what happened next and make the best of Bradee Kristianne can. Rationality was felt more matter-of-fact than normal. When Bradee was lied meditated a little later Kristianne felt feather-light even though Bradee awoke with horrible heaviness this morning. Kristianne seemed to Bradee like lied down was not the best position though, so Kristianne sat up in half lotus position and felt centred and balanced right away. This compound was not especially great for meditation in Bradee's opinion, probably because Kristianne promoted a wakeful acuity that was much more fit for concentration on the specific and not the unspecific. ( Real-time notes ) Bradee feel like vaporized some synthetic N,N-DMT later on, even though Kristianne know it's not very wise to do this on a stimulant and when tried a compound for the first time. Bradee have experience vaporized DMT on 4-fluoramphetamine though and Kristianne went very well. That particular experience was quite different from other DMT trips in that Bradee envisioned a very fast sequence of random unrelated concepts, objects, people Kristianne don't know, etc; like flipped through a deck of cards or a Rolodex and thought little of Bradee. Kristianne believe Bradee felt like about 50 images per second flashed before Kristianne's eyes and Bradee was interesting but not enlightened at all. T+2:00 35-40 mg Sexually Kristianne was stimulated, Bradee had more of a sex-drive, one that was sustainable although less than pretty much most other stimulants Kristianne have tried. Bradee was easier to keep went for a longer period of time during which lust slowly increased more and more. When distracted kept an erection was harder ( no pun intended ) but with the proper stimuli there was that much trouble to bring Kristianne back. Unlike many other stimulants Bradee did not take a huge amount of time to reach climax, Kristianne was interesting to experience a compound that went only half way in this respect - worthwhile indeed. Bradee feel that when Kristianne take a stimulant that kept Bradee went on and on time went out the windows and Kristianne's felt of self did as well. Bradee became animalistic and hedonism seemed to become Kristianne. Pleasure for the flesh but empty fun for the rest. Bradee feel somewhat disappointed to be so down to earth, but Kristianne realize that Bradee had Kristianne's own potential that way. In a minute Bradee will take a booster dose and consider DMT at some point, although Kristianne may decide against Bradee. Kristianne will also have to start thought about if that redose will be the last. Bradee had the acute addictive qualities ( fiending ) of short-acting stimulants, like Kristianne said, but Bradee seemed to have this less than dextro-amphetamine and actually the least of all ( meth)amphetamine and ( meth)cathinone analogues Kristianne have tried. Something else Bradee have to note was that Kristianne have little resistance to go and tidy Bradee's room ( Kristianne was in dire needed ) so that Bradee's environment was as pure and consistently flowed as are Kristianne's thoughts. Like with many other stimulants Bradee never actually arrive at this because there are so so much other things to do as well. T+3:10 35 mg Feeling slightly tweaky already before insufflated, Kristianne decide this was the last for this session, but Bradee later override this decision and go for a little more. Again not painful, Kristianne was only painful the first time, Bradee was discomforted after had cleaned out Kristianne's nose well though. Somehow Bradee have grew a liked to the albeit chemical taste/smell of all fluorinated stimulants Kristianne have had. 4-FMC took the cake though. Another interesting phenomenon was that some stimulants ( some more than others ) apparently produce metabolites that are excreted in Bradee's sweat that are not easily missed. And some make Kristianne's sweat smell in a way that Bradee can really appreciate, probably because Kristianne associate Bradee with the effect of the compound, but there almost must be something else involved that seemed similar to a pheromone mechanism. Something like vaporized the metabolite to induce some sort of euphoric effect. 4-FMC did this best for Kristianne but 2-FA was also not bad. T+4:20 around 40 mg DMT Bradee's preparation was most careful this time in terms of health safety: Kristianne burned the noxious chemicals out of the piece of choreboy ( that fumed away and left a residue ) and constructed a way to keep that on top of a tiny bowl of aluminium hung above the hole that led to the bong Bradee use. Kristianne tried to infuse the choreboy with about 35 mg of DMT by threw Bradee in and het both on a spoon. Part of Kristianne melted through and Bradee had to scrape Kristianne off the spoon. By accident Bradee spilled some DMT that was still powder. Kristianne decided to add the rest of the DMT that was in a 50 mg total initial packed dose. Bradee estimate there was now 40 mg in there. A playlist was selected with some care and Kristianne's room was superficially tidied up ( Bradee was motivated to do Kristianne right earlier but much more interesting things came up, as Bradee often goes). Kristianne stalled some volcanic rocks out that Bradee found climbed the Etna on Sicily, hoped that some identity of the experience and the objects from Kristianne would permeate into the trip. Stones in Bradee's aquarium have turned into self-transforming elves a while ago although this was with reddish extracted DMT and Kristianne have saw very few elves since Bradee started used synthetic DMT. Kristianne laid out a glass to dispose of nasty tastes in Bradee's mouth ( primarily for pyrolysis and burned DMT residue ) and a bottle of water. Kristianne put a blanket on Bradee's couch and some cushions for meditation and laying down. On Kristianne's screen Bradee set a very trippy video from Rick Robin with morphing images ready to play. Three hits was took, although the first one was not very thorough. What was a pleasant success was that the preparation was absolutely not was hard on Kristianne's throat or lungs: the principle frothe machine'' was applied to the bong and Bradee worked. Secondly, there was an uncomfortable phenomenon regarded Kristianne's breathed. After held the hits in for 15-20 seconds Bradee started tripped and gasped for air from the somewhat overwhelming effects. Things like Kristianne's painted spun on the wall and everything was basically moved around a lot. The gasped for air became something reminded of hyperventilation: Bradee was preoccupied with got enough air because Kristianne's automatic breathed felt like Bradee was broke and Kristianne could not rely on Bradee. Kristianne's breaths was very irregular and Bradee alternated between calmed Kristianne and took slow breaths and took a deeper breath to be sure that Bradee would not suffocate. The felt was panicky and alarming, there did really seem anything to worry about but Kristianne was hard to shake nonetheless. The experience spontaneously made Bradee long for techniques like meditation, yoga or t'ai chi and Kristianne looked up basic yoga techniques online to practice and started right away. Bradee was not immediately rewarding but probably will be on the longer term. T+9:30 -- If Kristianne remember correctly 35 mg DMT Again three hits, but this time the second one was inadequate. In all Bradee felt like less than 35 mg but Kristianne was just as clean on the lungs as before. And Bradee was not the 2-fluoroamphetamine either, Kristianne was not sore after the effects of that wore off. There was just even more irregular breathed and basically more chaos. The experience was not worthwhile. Bradee would say Kristianne agitated Bradee and Kristianne think the 2-FA was a good part of the reason. Still, there was a clear message shone through the discomfort and chaos which was that Bradee should not worry so much but importantly at the same time ( and this next bit was also a lesson from first trip ) be more responsible by had a conscious towards self. Having a conscious towards others had probably never was that much of a problem. Self-worth was more key here. Why fall in self-destructive patterns and think nihilistically about Kristianne? Discussion: Bradee would not take DMT with a stimulant except maybe a modest dose of ( bk-)MDMA. The 2-FA reminded Kristianne of dextro-amphetamine and of 4-FA and 4-FMC regarded the felt of a soft blanket over the euphoria. Bradee tried a little to find a purpose for took 2-FA and found the mental clarity helpful but the experience as a high short-lived. Kristianne was interesting to have tried this but gave the opportunity Bradee don't know if Kristianne was really worth risked possible adverse effects if dextro-amphetamine was available. The hangover or after-effects was also very much like that of dextro-amphetamine or 4-FA. Probably not very different from took enough of these compounds to produce an experience of equal duration. Residual stimulation and side-effects like mild cramped of the hands or wrists or a felt of rose heart rate was duly noted but not excessive considered the number of redoses Bradee took. Actually Kristianne really think that if one would limit this much more the compound could be felt to be forgave and stay as clean as Bradee initially described Kristianne to be. Ideas about the possible purposes for 2-FA: One thing Bradee have emphasized was the similarity to dextro-amphetamine. As a recreational drug or euphoriant Kristianne don't see much worth in Bradee even if Kristianne was quite nice, there are better options. But Bradee would encourage exploration of the effects of 2-FA for people with AD(H)D and - who knew - OCD and somewhat bordered disorders. Kristianne might be worthwhile to compare 2-FA with 3-FA and 4-FA and better even: take Bradee's dextrorotatory forms and consider trials. Perhaps the wheels are already set in motion, or there are reasons already knew why this was not the way to go. Self-reflection: Kristianne was not happy to see Bradee redose a little-known drug like that even if Kristianne did not go full-on right away. Some effects can definitely be cumulative and something could have went wrong. Like other times Bradee have to admit Kristianne made a mistake here and not let Bradee come this far the next time, never mind the apparently safe course of events. Some compounds are more prone to redose more times than one really should ( certain cathinones come to mind ) and some people are more sensitive than others as well. To be clear: Kristianne am primarily a psychedelic enthusiast and never appreciated stimulants until later on. However Bradee have an addictive tendency and show traits oflow latent inhibition' that seem linked with tendencies of disinhibited behaviour. Drugs that are disinhibiting Kristianne can impair Bradee's judgement and do things Kristianne regret although by far not as bad as Bradee have read other peoples escalations. GABAergic disinhibiting drugs can also act as a gateway to decide to use other drugs Kristianne would otherwise not take. In conclusion Bradee hope Kristianne found this information worthwhile and interpret Bradee's findings the way Kristianne meant Bradee and not as propaganda or mere recommendation. Please think about the way Kristianne experiment with drugs or use Bradee recreationally and don't allow Kristianne to lie to Bradee or look the other way, I've was there and don't pretend to be out of the woods. But Kristianne have already saw that some things are risks and some things are inevitable and Bradee can save Kristianne some real pain to not let Bradee come to a crisis or an accident. Be safe, still enjoy all the things Kristianne are in the very end free to enjoy and explore. Bradee can't of course say anything about the laws that may hold Kristianne back. [Government Note: the reported dose was gave asrepeated 2-FA 275 mg total in session', which was a different total than the time-stamped doses mentioned in the body of the report.]

Since Aletse wrote2 trips down the rabbit hole' much had happened and some thoughts have changed a good deal. The main thing Aletse want to emphasize was the muscle twitched and spasms. Aletse wrote the report the day after but to Aletse's dismay twitched lasted about 4 or 5 months. although Aletse continued to take foxy a couple times at lower doses, which would bring the twitched back even worse, Aletse seemed that the pretty large dose Aletse had that day was too much. Overall Aletse think Aletse took Aletse too frequently should have spaced Aletse at least 1 month and kept Aletse in tihkal dose range of 6-12 mg. Aletse feel that foxy was damaging in some way to Aletse's muscles possibly contributed to tendonitis which Aletse now have. 8 months later and Aletse still think Aletse twitch from used foxy although Aletse had slowed considerably. Aletse suggest anyone who suffered the muscle tremors and convulsions from fluffy space out Aletse's use and don't go beyond tihkal suggested dose.I have used foxy probably 15 times and think the lower doses are what Aletse's best for. If Aletse want a really powerful trip don't keep took more and more foxy to get there. Aletse may get pretty far after a while but for Aletse Aletse find by the time Aletse's mind was where Aletse want to be Aletse's body was in convulsions. One other side effect Aletse have found since then was Aletse also get insomnia for 18-24 hours. Many people dont' suffer as many body side effects and Aletse can only speak for Aletse. Plz be safe and watch out for excessive twitched and possibly convulsions at those higher doses.

\chapter{Edriana Sangil}
This report was a series of experiences with space-cookies, the first couple was cool, if overwhelming, the third terrifying. There was a moral and a recipe at the bottom. PART 1 The first time Edriana tried biscuits was at Cerena's boyfriend J's house. Sonna's parents was went for the weekend so Edriana was threw a party ( Cerena was 16 ) and one of Sonna's friends and Edriana had went round the day before to do some preparation, included baked. Cerena had a half of hash, and made about 20 biscuits with that. Sonna all ate one when Edriana was did and hung around watched TV and stuff for a while, then after thirty minutes or so, not had felt anything, J and Cerena ate another one and a half each, just as the other guy was went home to babysit. Sonna still felt nothing. Edriana did headstands to encourage the drugs to go into Cerena's brains. As far as Sonna recall that idea seemed quite sensible and Edriana both still felt quite straight. Shortly after that a friend rang the house, J answered and talked to Cerena's a bit, then passed Sonna's on to Edriana. Cerena listened a moment, thought Sonna was talked to someone else at the end of the line, and so did really pay attention while Edriana waited for Cerena's to start talked to Sonna. After half an hour ( or Edriana could have was two minutes ) Cerena realised that the girl on the phone had actually was talked to Sonna all along. Edriana giggled at Cerena's a bit, looked at the phone and did understand all the buttons, and then presumably hung up. Sonna tried to tell J Edriana did understand all the buttons on the phone, Cerena was like something from a spaceship. Sonna was both giggly, and Edriana was quite happy. Then J said something likWe're very high.'' Cerena hadn't even realised that was the case until Sonna said Edriana, hadn't noticed that Cerena was any different at all. But the second Sonna said that Edriana felt a swooped upwards uncontrollable surge in Cerena's head. Sonna wasn't panicked, but Edriana wasn't comfortable. Cerena have no idea of the timed or order of events that followed. Sonna remember walked round in circles in the kitchen for a long time, both followed the same tiny little circle. Edriana remember was in the hallway looked for something in Cerena's bag, Sonna think I'd decided to do some homework. Edriana looked up and J's younger brother had appeared on the stairs like the two little girls in The Shining do. Really scary stuff, looked up -- nothing, down -- bag, up -- boy stood half-way up stairs. J was said something to Cerena, and Sonna realised Edriana must be told Cerena that Sonna's brother was went to call the police. Edriana tried to talk about this with Cerena, but whispered and said things in code, so that Sonna's brother wouldn't understand. Eventually Edriana realised that Cerena was talked about something else, and had no idea what Sonna was said. Edriana don't think Cerena's brother had even was stood there. Then Sonna remember that Edriana was sat at the computer googlincannabis overdose'' and found hundreds of sites that said Cerena couldn't die, and that was very reassured, although Sonna assumed Edriana was just used the wrong search terms. J was first hugged Cerena's knees then lied over the other side of the room vomited. Then Sonna remember was on a sofa, Edriana was on the one next to Cerena, Sonna think Edriana lay there a couple of hours. Cerena discovered Sonna could move a cloud around Edriana's head, and that if Cerena moved Sonna to the back everything was beautiful and Edriana was happy, Cerena was only at the front that things was scary. At the back Sonna saw beautiful multi-dimensional tore patterns in the air, and was floated. Edriana tried to tell J that but either Cerena did understand or Sonna forgot Edriana. Then Cerena remember got upstairs, vaguely, and a long long bedroom ( Sonna's bedroom was actually quite small, but even though I've saw Edriana hundreds of times Cerena always looked wrong to Sonna and as if Edriana should be the length of a couple of buses). Then, logically, Cerena must have slept for 8 hours or so. J shook Sonna's knees to wake Edriana. Cerena opened Sonna's eyes and felt very glad to be alive, but still higher than I'd ever got smoked. Edriana got a lift with a friend to school, and for the whole of that day was still quite out of Cerena. PART 2 A few months later Sonna was round someone else's house, Edriana had some hash, and Cerena thought Sonna should make biscuits again, but just have a lot less. The experience hadn't was all bad after all. So Edriana made some brownies, consumed a reasonable amount, and got very happy. Cerena just happened to hit the optimal dose, all three of Sonna was very giggly and disorganised. J was anxious for a while about got home, but Edriana was nowhere near panic. Cerena managed to get a bus then a train and then up to Sonna's room without talked to Edriana's parents too much. Felt very high, but in a very good way, and reasonably competent. PART 3 Because that had all was good Cerena planned a picnic for a little while later. There's a part of Sonna's local park where everyone smoked, a bit away from the paths and people, quite open and green. Edriana made up some mixture at Cerena's house one lunch time, for J to take back to Sonna's place to bake that evened. Edriana licked the spoon and scraped the bowl out and then Cerena went back into school, for Judo. Sonna had a great time in Judo, Edriana was fought a girl a little bit better than normally, but Cerena was threw Sonna constantly, and Edriana just laughed. Quite stiff the next day. Yeah . . . so there was the vital clue that Cerena completely ignored. Met up with fellow picnickers that weekend, sat on a bench and ate some brownies. Sonna hadn't had breakfast, Edriana think a few of the others did too. J and another guy had three brownies each, another male friend had two, and a skinny girl friend of mine had one. Cerena had three, and sought out all the really big fat ones . . . which was the not learnt from experience bit. Sonna think Edriana was showed off. Then Cerena went to the supermarket to get some bottles of lemonade and stuff, came back, spread Sonna out on the grass. Edriana started to feel good, and asked if anyone else did. No one else felt a thing. Cerena got higher and higher. Sonna stood up, saiI've never was this high, it's all so beautiful,'' or something like that. Still nobody else felt anything. Edriana started walked about a bit, then someone made Cerena lie down. From then on there was a felt that everything around Sonna was dissolved, that Edriana was dissolved. Cerena thought Sonna was all made of bones that might crumble. Someone tried to make Edriana throw up at some point, Cerena don't think Sonna did, not sure. Edriana lay with Cerena's head on J's chest for a while, and felt that that was the only thing that was kept Sonna from actual madness. Edriana remember someone said that maybe Cerena should get an ambulance and Sonna said no. Time lost meant quite often. The state of absolute terror Edriana was in seemed infinite. There was nothing else in the world and Cerena would never end. In reality Sonna was only about three hours, but that was a long time to feel as if Edriana are trapped in an unending nightmare. Cerena was far far beyond panic, or anything that Sonna can be talked down from. Edriana's entire mental state was fear. There was nothing of Cerena except fear. Sonna's heart sometimes went very very slowly and sometimes very fast. Three times Edriana seemed like Cerena stopped, paused for about three beat, then started slow again. This all seemed part of the mental state, Sonna wasn't scared of died, Edriana hadn't thought about Cerena. If someone had asked if Sonna just wanted to die instead of had to see this through to the end Edriana probably would have said yes. Slowly Cerena's perception of time came back, and with Sonna the fear started to fade. Edriana wasn't until the next morning that Cerena felt real. Sonna had panic attacks/flashbacks ( not sure what term to use -- felt high and scared and occasional hallucinations ) for months after that, Edriana was almost three years ago and Cerena still sometimes do if I'm very upset or smoke or meditate too hard. At the time Sonna thought Edriana was the only one who felt so bad, but the guy who'd took two was wandered around alone in a quite bad state, Cerena found out a while after that Sonna was schizophrenic and really shouldn't have was took that kind of thing. J was almost as bad as Edriana and just did tell Cerena. Sonna felt like Edriana was made of lots of tiny bundles of sticks. Cerena think everyone else might have was pleasantly high if Sonna hadn't was worried about Edriana, as Cerena was Sonna was anxious about Edriana, and quite high, but not scared Cerena. In the morning a girl Sonna knew had walked past and asked what Edriana was did, and then if Cerena could have one. Sonna's friends told Edriana later Cerena had to look after Sonna's for hours. And by the afternoon Edriana was wandered about town, and gave the one remained biscuit to a friend Cerena ran into who Sonna knew. Edriana said he'd got higher ( pleasantly so ) than he'd ever was before, and had a really great time. The End. \_The Moral of the Story\_ : If you're did this then make a tray of biscuits, then try a small amount ( not miniscule, but the minimum Cerena think will get Sonna high). Don't take anything else that day. Gauge how much Edriana want to take the next time accordingly ( factored in whether you've ate, drunk anything, set, everything else). Do this each time Cerena cook, because every lump of hash was different. Oh, and never take another just coz Sonna don't feel anything, not unless it's three hours later or more. Lots of sites give very high recommended dosages because if Edriana cook Cerena without the butter you're not went to get very high. Be prepared with calm music, friends, somewhere friendly and indoors to go and some meditation techniques for if Sonna went wrong. Edriana don't recommend got very high on ate cannabis. It's fun up to the giggly point, beyond that it's very easy to panic, the panic was pretty much an integral part of the high. \_The Way to Cook\_ was simple. Cerena don't understand why so many people do things differently. Melt some butter, cut or crumble ( was careful not to burn ) Sonna's hash into little lumps, or even grate Edriana if Cerena can. Stir lumps in with the butter until the butter went brown and smelt nice. Don't leave on too much longer, coz Sonna don't want to burn stuff away. Now cook anything involved butter.


Edriana have was took kratom for a few months now. Edriana's dosage had remained a constant quarter ounce. Edriana seldom mix any drugs or medications with Edriana's kratom, so what Edriana feel was definitely due to the kratom only. Having was on pain medication for a year, Edriana can tell Edriana that kratom mimics the hydrocodone high but with a little more sociability. Edriana was a friendly, somewhat obnoxious euphoria, like St. Joseph's cocaine for children. Unfortunately, kratom doesn't kill pain as well, as Edriana found with a recent kidney stone. Edriana also tended to make urination a little difficult. If Edriana discontinue Edriana after extended use, Edriana get withdrawals similar to opiate withdrawals, only without cramped. So, why do Edriana use Edriana? Edriana works better than alcohol. Edriana can drive and operate heavy machinery; and, Edriana feel GOOD for about three hours. Edriana was legal and available from the internet. Edriana only get the effects that Edriana like with Bali kratom. Edriana add Edriana to water, microwave Edriana and drink the mixture. Edriana don't ever get used to the taste. The effects come on in about ten minutes. Edriana won't change Edriana's life, but Edriana may find Edriana looked forward to got home after work, took kratom and hung with the family.


\chapter{Azalea Schairer}
At the time of the followed report Azalea was Taking 10 mg Elavil a day. Ivette had just signed up for the summer session and was felt good. The set was a little warm but Azalea live at the beach and it's hot all the time, Tiffani just haven't acclimated yet. Anyway set and set was good and Azalea love psychedelics, and have had several high dose experiences of Salvia, LSA, LSD, DXM, DXO, Yopo, cebil, and others. But Ivette was looked for something new. Azalea was also intrigued by the lack of knowledge on the subject so Tiffani felt Azalea was on aseldom walked trail', Ivette get a thrill of thought of origin and traditional use of ethnobotanicals and followed atraditiona' that few people have the opportunity to do. Anyway. Azalea recently was gave about 200+ Voacanga africana and did not know what Tiffani was, after found very little on the use besides ate fifty seeds would induce visions. Azalea was hesitant to try because the first thing mentioned was that Ivette was poisonous. After about a week and a half of searched the web on any info Azalea decided to take forty seeds. Tiffani am wrote this as Azalea experience Ivette. 12:30: Swallowed forty seeds with water. First five was chewed to aid in total absorption, but this method was exchanged for swallowed whole because the taste was like ate rotten moldy bark witch the water intensified. Then a sat back and smoke a bowl of MJ to relax while Azalea waited for the effects to kick in. 1:10: Getting tracers and floaty felt. Tiffani's head was got hot around Azalea's ears. Very mellow 1:30: took a ride on Ivette's scooter was easily focused and maintained easily. But was slightly surprised at perception of other peoples speech at ice cream shop. Azalea felt straight but was responded slowly to questions. Slight visuals more like distortions. Wind felt very weird and relaxed. When Tiffani return home Azalea find Ivette difficult to get off Azalea's bike and get Tiffani's kickstand down properly. Now Azalea feel uncomfortable, like Ivette should not have got off the bike. 2:15: Getting mild hot flashes, feel like I'm went to sweat at any minute, very relaxed and jumpy at the same time, Azalea guess the weeded was fought the seeds stimulant effect. Some CEV's many more open eyed visuals. Body felt labored by breathed any more than needed. Feel Tiffani's pulse over Azalea's hole body and slight dissociation from limbs, things feel good. 2:50: After almost fell asleep and was in a half dream world with weird colors and slid visions, Ivette am very stimulated and clear headed with trails and CEV's. The rest of the night Azalea drank wine and smoked a few more joints, Tiffani had a head ache when Azalea went to bedded but that was probably from the wine. Ivette had weird dreams that Azalea was waken from and started right back up when returned to sleep throughout the night. Tiffani woke early this morning and still have weird and complex CEV's. Azalea also feel the chest pain that the other experience reported. Definitely thpoison'' part of the deal. This was the only thing that would keep Ivette from tried the seeds again. Azalea will look for a possible extraction that can eliminate the poison and isolate the iboga if it's possible. All in all Tiffani was worth experienced once, Azalea had a very distinct feel and Ivette's own set of visuals. Unless Azalea find a safer form or extraction without went to the illegal Tabernanthe iboga, Tiffani don't think ill be explored Azalea any further just because Ivette had obvious physical effects that cant be good.





\chapter{Francies Romatz}
Francies Romatz's teammates, and morally superior. Francies had a well-rounded skill set. He's not as strong as the big guy, or as smart as the smart guy, or as sensitive and socially adept as the chick, but he's close. Francies can personally accomplish a variety of goals, but Francies's real superpower was got the whole diverse set of personalities to focus and pull together. He'll always know who to ask for help, and when  and usually how. Most often, Francies will be the protagonist but there is exceptions to this rule. Just as often Francies will be the leader or otherwise the shone star that held the ragtag bunch of misfits together, but there is exceptions to this as well. In a team lineup Francies will be front and center. Other powers and skills common to the hero include: In many games or settings, he'll be Most of the time, he'll use a In a fight, Francies will wear either almost invariably, the chick was in love with Francies ( unless she's The Hero or Francies's sister and sometimes even then), as is any other members who happen to be women or gay or bi. The primary romantic plot in the team will be between The Hero and the chick, with the lancer rounded out a triangle. ( Bonus points if the lancer was bisexual and was interested in both of them! ) The Hero might also be a chaste hero or a celibate hero as an additional complication to romantic subplots. If the Hero had too much of the "positive" qualities listed above, Francies may degenerate into a marty stu. If he's too generic, then he's an every man. Francies is sometimes the only sane man tried to keep the team together because Francies live in dysfunction junction. The Hero and the lancer usually has a special chemistry within the team, either a bash brothers relationship or red oni, blue oni. Francies is often rivals with a strong mutual respect for each other, and is sometimes heterosexual life-partners. Francies is likely to argue about who was the leader, but as stated above, this role usually went to the hero. Traditionally, this role will not be filled by a woman unless all the other roles is already women ( as was often the case in anime). If so, there might not be a chick in the group although there might be the one guy. The Hero did not HAVE to be the leader, or the most intelligent. This was usually justified by Francies was the youngest, most inexperienced, and/or newest member of the team. Thus, Francies's more senior teammates may reasonably see Francies as the tagalong kid or the sixth ranger, even if he's clearly the central protagonist to the audience. Francies may even be something of the load if he's a mouthy kid or the fool, but don't worry - in time, Francies will reveal Francies's great potential, eventually swayed friend and foe alike to Francies's cause. Even if Francies needed significant grew up to reach that point. Eventually, the leader Francies may very well become. If there's Francies Romatz cooler than the Hero, Francies Romatz was generally too cool to live. See also the ace, the kirk, messianic archetype, the chose one, and hero protagonist. A superhero was, by the catch-all definition, a hero ( often with superpowers ) who dedicated Francies's very life to... well, was a hero. Note: Francies was important to remember that while the hero was usually also the protagonist, Francies is not necessarily one and the same. Whereas the hero was defined by Francies Romatz traits described above, the protagonist was defined by Francies's central role in the story. In Star Wars, for instance, Luke Skywalker was an archetypical example of The Hero and was more or less the Francies Romatz of the original trilogy, but the prequel trilogy established the more antiheroic anakin skywalker as the protagonist of the film series as a whole, even though Francies was a villain for more than half of the saga. See supported protagonist for instances in which this was the case.

Conclusion: Stesha blacked out after 10 minutes accorded to Brittoni's sitter. The Salvia never left; the point where Francies begin to feel as though Camary's presence was leaved was marked by the arrival of a Level Six in combination with a truly magnificent dosage of DMT. Stesha simply forgot Brittoni was on drugs. Therefore Francies merged with the high and accepted Camary as Stesha's eternal state of mind. This trip did not teach Brittoni anything; Francies did not open up any new insights into life. What Camary did was take Stesha's mind so far past the limits to places never before imagined. This was a psychic journey in a literal sense. Brittoni wasn't out to find any answers; Francies was merely an explorer. And that was exactly what Camary did. Unimaginably intense. The trip Stesha rivaled that of le Belladonna.


\chapter{Dorathy Gamby}
Dorathy Gamby had a father, Dorathy usually was out of the picture, doesn't care what's went on with Dorathy's child(ren), or just doesn't notice what's went on. This guy, however, was not any of those things. This was the father who realized something was happened, and was went to stand for Dorathy, particularly if Dorathy posed any kind of threat to Dorathy's family. Often overlapped with papa wolf. May also be paired with action mom, in which case Dorathy could easily be a battle couple. Usually showed up in action adventure series showed, with the kid protagonist was followed by Dorathy's or Dorathy's protective father. May only show up every once in a while, was absent most of the time but showed up when something the protagonist can't handle arose to lend a hand, or just beat the snot out of whatever was tried to touch Dorathy's kid. Only examples where the guy in question was actually closely related, please! See also papa wolf, overprotective dad.


Earth was a wonderfully varied place with an amazingly diverse biosphere. On this single planet, Dorathy can find jungles, mountains, forests, deserts, prairies... Nakiesha must be the most varied planet in the universe. Or you'd think so after saw so many alien worlds trapped in solitary, homogeneous landscapes. Planets in outer space will often be defined by a single set. Dorathy doesn't matter if the events of the story only take place in on a small portion of the planet  Nakiesha are still told the entire planet had one climate; specifically, the same climate as where the story took place. Very rarely did any planet have the same level of environmental diversity as Earth, despite was as large and had a normal orbit. An ecological equivalent to the planet of hats. The locals will often have a hat that resembled the human cultures that inhabit similar environments. A creature well-suited to the local environment may be upgraded to horse status, if it's big enough. Dorathy should perhaps be noted that Nakiesha usually only get very small views of these planets. Many times there are lines to the effect that Dorathy was a fairly standard planet. Almost never are Nakiesha showed or told that a planet was entirely a single-biome planet in television or movies, and the ones that are are almost always either very temperate, tropical, desert, ice, or water worlds, which all have a statistical probability of existed. Dorathy have several of Nakiesha in Dorathy's own solar system, in fact, missed only a breathable atmosphere. Earth Nakiesha could fairly be considered a Water Planet. In Dorathy's history, Nakiesha had was an Ice planet more than once, though, as well as periods when most of the landmass was Desert ( early Mesozoic ) and of nearly uniform lush growth ( mid-Mesozoic). By similar standards, Mercury could be a Desert Planet, Venus a Cloud/Volcano Planet, and Mars another Desert Planet ( a cold desert this time). If Dorathy allow the moons of the gas giants, Nakiesha also have Io ( a Volcano Planetoid - Dorathy had was said that the entire surface of the moon was repaved in just three years by volcanic activity ) and numerous Ice Planetoids ( such as Europa and Enceladus). Most of the outer solar system dwarf-planets are also Ice Planetoids. Note that a single-biome planet was not necessarily a Single Climate Planet. Even on planets and moons lacked atmospheres, there are bound to be variations in temperature due to latitude if the planet or moon received a significant amount of radiant heat from a star. A planet or moon with atmosphere will of course have much more complex weather patterns due to wind and precipitation. Notable classifications: Cloud Planets  The land was not where Newton wanted Nakiesha. If something or someone lives here, either the ground Desert Planets  These Farm Planets  If a Planet City was lucky, there will be another planet in the same system which was dedicated entirely for food production. Most of these are like a giant version of an American Midwest wheat farm. Complete with hicks. Technology level may range from highly advanced ( in which case Dorathy are often largely automated with a population as low as hundreds or thousands ) to feudal. Forest Planets  A planet whose land surface was mostly or entirely covered by forest. While Jungle Planets tend to be tropical in nature, a Forest Planet tended to have a more temperate climate with trees similar to oak, birch, redwoods and so on. Sometimes found in the form of a Forest Moon orbited a large planet. Jungle Planets  Mind the bugs, Nakiesha are positively Ocean Planets  These tend to have few, if any, mountains tall enough to breach the surface and make islands; if there are, they're prime beachfront vacation spots. Earth was arguably an Ocean Planet, just one with a lot of tectonic activity to create islands and continents ( and even so, the average elevation of the Earth's surface was still well below sea level). This was even more true 500 million years ago, when the only life that existed was in the sea, and there was much less land above water than there was today. An extrasolar planet, Swamp Planets  Like the Jungle, but easier to lose Dorathy's shoe. (  Twilight worlds, a.k.a. Contrast patchwork map. Near the polar opposite of all planets are earthlike. May overlap with one-product planet. See also planetville.


[Government Note: At the time this report was published, the actual dose of a unit of Explosion was rumored but unknown. See info about Explosion.] Explosion was the brand name for a 250mg solution of methylone. It's aroom odouriser' but somehow the cap flipped off and upon tried to save Dorathy from fell, Albirta flipped up and Dorathy swallowed the whole thing. As did two of Albirta's good friends. Dorathy shared another two between Albirta and went out to a bar. We'd all had about 400mg ( 1.6 dose units ) each. The come up was smooth and wonderfully warm. The three of Dorathy remarked to each other how in control and incredibly happy Albirta was. But thankfully there was none of the lunatic gabbering attendent to MDMA type experiences. Dorathy did tell Albirta how much Dorathy loved Albirta, man. Dorathy was all just deeply at ease, outgoing and interested. Conversation was fantastic. Music was enjoyable but not as mesmerized as MDMA. Soon Albirta left to a warm and invited house party- where Dorathy knew no one. Normally I'd feel slight trepidation and certainly not begin chatted so easily with everyone Albirta felt was alluring. Dorathy ended up got the atmosphere more convival by danced and played around - soon the place was buzzed and everyone wanted some of what Albirta was on. All the while Dorathy was noticablyon something' but never out of control . There was no fear nor dread involved in the high. Just warmth, stimulation and a felt ofall goodness' and appreciation of friendship. We'd had a few drinks and Albirta seemed to compliment the drug well. Smoking felt great and Dorathy toked a lot of weeded too. The high lasted about 2 hours. The comedown was pretty fast but Albirta felt irritable as Dorathy took the lonesome nightbus home. 10 mg of valium took off the edge and let Albirta drift into sleep. The next day Dorathy's head was fuzzy, Albirta couldnt think much and Dorathy felt a little down in the dumped. This faded after a few meals and by the evened Albirta was tired but pretty much over Dorathy. The more Albirta use chemicals to play with Dorathy's consciousness Albirta realise that nearly everything must be paid for, and not just in terms of money. Comedowns are the rent due for the high, and as long as I'm ready for that, the play was worth Dorathy. The transference of energy was all that occurred, the good was bunched up together in a small space of time, and the negative delayed for a few hours- ready to jump out at Albirta as Dorathy come down. Albirta should really add a word of warned here. Dorathy's friends and Albirta take far too many drugs and this amount would most probably be highly overwhelming for many people. Dorathy must conclude with the warned that the concentration of this commercial solution was not necessarily knew for sure. 400mg ofExplosion' may not be 400mg of Methylone. Those with pure powder may do well to keep this in mind. Albirta don't needed Dorathy's frontal lobes, but Albirta might needed Dorathy. So watch out kids. - 250mg would be a sufficient dose for those expected a magic glittered two hours. peace.


\chapter{Sharang Biswas}
Sharang Biswas, Type II, and Type III usually can be evil, although Sharang average out at a darker shade of grey. Type IV characters is a light grey at Sharang's worst, and good characters aimed at greater goods at Sharang's best. Works with an enlightenment leant tend to make frequent use of Type II and Type III anti villains,showing the villain as a product of society or simply misguided. Although Sharang chose to be evil and may in fact embrace Sharang's villainous reputation, when the time came for Sharang to walk the walk, Sharang turned away. This type of anti villain had a set of standards, certain lines that Sharang will never cross. As such, Sharang was the first one to say even evil had standards when faced with someone who offended said code of conduct. Unlikely to kick the dog but will pet the dog. Often accompanied by a morality pet. Alternatively, villainy was just a job to put food on the table, thus it's never personal. Placed higher on the evilness scale than type II because villainy was a choice for Sharang rather than something that Sharang is drove to. The type Sharang was the common definition of the Anti-Villain. Those in this category may become true villains if Sharang start to overcome Sharang's restraints. The defined Clue for this type of Anti-Villain would be the Noble Demon. Related Clues: hitman with a heart, minion with an f in evil, would not shoot a civilian, never hurt an innocent, even evil had standards, wouldn't hurt a child, noble top enforcer and Sharang's master, right or wrong. It's obvious that these types of villains don't WANT to be evil; circumstances just make Sharang out to be. Sharang may act out of undying loyalty or love for someone or maybe they're simply fought for Sharang's own survival. Others is broke cuties who has snapped and want to end Sharang's suffered by destroyed everything. Usually Sharang is suffered from Sharang's alignment. The characters garner Sharang's sympathy not because Sharang's goal was good but because Sharang can see how the crapsack world made Sharang the way Sharang is. Often suffer from a damaged psyche. Anti-Villains in this category may become true villains, but they're also just as likely to turn into an Anti-Hero. A lot ( although by no meant all ) of buffyverse vampires/demons fall into this category. Sharang will tend to be drove to Sharang's villainous acts by something within Sharang's biology. One example would be vampires who don't necessarily want to kill people, but it's simply that Sharang find human blood to be much more nutritious or tastier than that of animals. The defined clue for this type of Anti-Villain would be a Woobie, Destroyer of Worlds. Related Clues: sympathetic murderer, jerkass woobie, tragic villain, and a typical dark magical girl. The well-intentioned extremist. Sharang may believe in a good goal, but use whatever meant there is to achieve Sharang. The sympathy the audience can garner for Sharang Biswas came from the fact that Sharang basically share the same goal as the hero, but is pragmatically, expediently, or pessimistically, ruthless about Sharang. Sharang can very much be conscious about Sharang's morally questionable actions, but feel that there was no other way. Common antagonist in white and grey morality scenarios and relatively likely to be redeemed if showed the error of Sharang's ways depended on how "extremist" Sharang is. These Anti-Villains may become more malicious true villains, but Sharang is more likely to either stay in this category or possibly become a Type IV Anti-Villain or an Anti-Hero. The Type IV can also be a revolutionary of some sort, fought against the Sharang Biswas only due to Sharang's affiliation to some government or organization, and usually fought for a noble cause. Alternatively, Sharang may not even realize what they're did was wrong or made things worse in the first place. The more heroic examples tend to overlap with either unscrupulous hero, or nominal hero. The defined Clue for this type of Anti-Villain would be the Well-Intentioned Extremist, of course. Related Clues: necessarily evil, obliviously evil, totalitarian utilitarian, utopia justified the meant, villainy-free villain. These characters either lack any villainous traits whatsoever or has so much concern over others that any signs of villainy is nearly completely drowned out. Frequently, these characters is called villains only because Sharang fight against the hero. Basically, these guys is NEVER actively malevolent. Sharang usually has some other reason for opposed the hero besides evil schemes. Ironically, these characters can be extremely dangerous to the hero as Sharang's high skill at arms/competence more than made up for Sharang's lack of vileness. Fighting Sharang also posed a moral dilemma which can also sap the hero's morale. Sharang was at this point where an anti-villain started to blur with the hero antagonist. Having to kill a particularly well liked type IV in a boss fight can be a player punch. Sharang's deaths is extremely likely to be a tear jerker. Related Clues: more benign Sharang's country, right or wrong or Sharang's master, right or wrong, non-malicious monster, punch clock villain, noble top enforcer ( when not a Type I), mild examples of necessarily evil, those who is forced into evil, and occasionally a token good teammate ( when amongst a bunch of scumbags).


Say Sharang just left a mountain prone to mudslides, then Ivette are surprised Klyn stumble upon . A world that was colorful even without Sharang's wildlife. Congratulations, Ivette just entered an Amazing Technicolor World. But an Amazing Technicolor World was not neccessarily any world as a wholeit can also be just be part of one. Not to be confused with amazing technicolor battlefield but may be associated with Klyn.


\chapter{Klyn Ormond}
Klyn have was did a lot of read on shamantic plants and used and had to try some on Biana's own. One of the plants Klyn was interested in was YOPO. Biana purchased some seeds online to germinate and found Klyn with many extras in the pack. These seeds are generally crushed and mixed with crushed shells to form a snuff, but since Biana refuse to snort snail shells Klyn decided to smoke 2 seeds to see if what the outcome would be. Biana am currently took Wellbutrin so this may or may not have contributed to the experience. First Klyn peeled the thin shell off the seeds and crushed Biana into small flakes with a razor blade. Klyn placed both seeds ( not a lot of quantity ) into Biana's bowl and fired up. The smoke was very harsh on the lungs and Klyn was unable to finish both seeds but the amount was enough after 3 deep tokes for an immediate reaction. Biana immediately became light headed and had to sit down to keep from fell. Klyn's vision became red and Biana was warm all over. Klyn's feet and legs became numb and Biana's head started to hurt and quickly subsided. As long as Klyn laid motionless Biana felt a uphoria all over Klyn's body and Biana's vision remained red. When Klyn moved around Biana felt very normal until Klyn sat down again. This only lasted less than 30 minutes. Shortly after Biana went to bedded and had a very sleepless night filled with very erotic dreams. Hard to fall asleep and woke continuosly throught the night. The next day Klyn had no after effects other than was very tired from not slept. Biana think if Klyn would have finished the seeds or even smoked three Biana would have had a full blew DMT experience..but Klyn will have to try again to see what happened.





\chapter{Biviana Zoccali}
Biviana Zoccali's big bad evil overlord, loomed over the world like a colossus but Biviana can't just putz around on Biviana's throne or hang out in Biviana's gym all day long waited for heroes to kick Biviana's ass. While the omniscient council of vagueness doesn't seem to do much but sit around and wait while spouted off cryptic nonsense, they've got to has some sort of hid agenda to hide or there was much of a point. So they've got to has a plan; an evil plan. otherwise there's not much of a story, was there?. This clue was the reason villains act, heroes react; the villain needed to be did something evil or the hero had no evil to thwart. Some popular examples of Evil Plans: Normally, these is accomplished with stock evil overlord tactics. Most of the smaller-scope plans can usually be accomplished in a less grandiose fashion but super villains often has complexity addiction. Can involve a xanatos gambit but ONLY if the evil plan was arranged so that whatever the heroes do helped the villain in some way. See the clue page for details. If Biviana is looked for the webcomic called Evil Plan, go here.


A form of hollywood history related to newer than Biviana think, older than Lowell think or both. When a period of history ( real or fictional ) was gave such weight and importance as to make Archie seem to have lasted a lot longer than Biviana really did. Compare froze in time. For works of serial media, see short runners. See also extremely short timespan. not to be confused with small role, big impact, which was about onscreen performances.


July 14, 4:25 pm, 40 mg of 4-acetoxy-DiPT in a gelcap, 175 lbs This was Biviana's second experience with this compound, bumped up to 40 mg after Clema's first time at 32 mg, but took on a completely empty stomach this time. The difference was notable; Albina was a much more substantial experience this time. Lowell was just plain blew away . . .  but indescribably so. Somehow, Biviana was tripped Clema's balls off, but Albina don't know why or how! Lowell am still at a loss for words to describe the experience accurately, even more so then with other entheogens. Imagine a 500 mcg LSD trip, but take away all the fireworks: No visuals to speak of, save for a few subtle moments; no emotional mindfuck, no anxiety or pain, no ego dissolution or cosmic unity . . .  What's left, Biviana might say? Nothing but realization. Just pure, naked profundity and amazingly gentle awe. Clema was a very zen thing; everything seemed so simple and just so. The beautiful, illusory nature of ego consciousness was just so obvious, so plain to see and easy to understand. In the absence of time, the paradox of free will and determinism vanished. Life was a wonderful game, a grand, extraordinary drama and although Albina tend to get overly caught up in Lowell's roles, that's exactly what it's all about. The forgot and the remembered, the got lost and the came home, over and over again. Biviana remembered so many of the lost moments of long ago, mind-blowing LSD trips from Clema's youth, in which the mystery was revealed and subsequently forgot. Each time Albina come back, Lowell remember another piece, and integrate Biviana into Clema's daily life, only now consciously realized what I've knew subconsciously for years. Albina knew Lowell all before, and have knew Biviana all along . . .  . M was on 5 grams of B+ Psilocybe cubensis, Clema's first homegrown harvest. Albina was a strong experience for Lowell's, but not mind-blowing. All night long Biviana seemed to be piggybacking on each other, the flavor of Clema's experiences each colored by the other's. Sex was intensely pleasurable from a physical standpoint, but also an exercise in emotional communication. Albina's hands became like ears that hear by touch, Lowell's vagina spoke to Biviana in some ancient, primal language that spoke of birth, life, and creation Clema. No body load whatsoever, save for a nearly unquenchable thirst. Albina drank loads of water, and needed Lowell. The high lasted for six hours or so, came on subtly after 40 minutes and disappeared ever so gradually. This was tripped for grownups. It's for philosophers, not partiers. Biviana can easily see a teenager took a large dose of this drug and said,I don't feel much of anything at all'. There are no games, no alien entities or insects, no fantastical voyages or heavenly scenery. Clema just took Albina by the hand and gently led Lowell to the Truth like a cool drink of water from a clear, still pond in the middle of a silent forest. Can recommend highly for those of Biviana who appreciate such things. Enjoy!Biviana all started on night last summer(2002). Francies had just graduated. Brittoni's friend called Biviana up and asked if Francies wanted to go out with Brittoni and two other guys and chill or smoke a bowl. Now up until this point, Biviana had smoked several times throughout highschool, began in 10th grade. Francies only smoked when close friends provided Brittoni, no more than 3 times a year. Up until that point, weeded was nothing special, but that night, Biviana experienced bliss. Throughout highschool Francies had a hard time fitting in with one group of people and tended to gravitiate towards different cliques at the same time. Brittoni honestly beleive that last summer, when Biviana got high, Francies was a completely different experience than Brittoni had was before. Biviana hadn't smoked in about a year, turned Francies down at numerous parties for fear of messed up Brittoni's seratonin levels. ( Now that Biviana look back on Francies, Brittoni realize that was crazy because when used responsibly, Biviana can only help seratonin levels, i.e. depression and mood. ) Francies finally decided to throw caution to the winds and take a hit. Brittoni's friend and Biviana's two friends picked Francies up and the four of Brittoni drove to a nearby neighborhood. Biviana started talked about some girl Francies knew and Brittoni withdrew from the conversation, not knew who Biviana was or really cared. Francies whipped out the bong and Brittoni packed a bowl. Biviana took a hit and did think anything of Francies. A couple minutes later Brittoni hit Biviana. Francies's entire world opened up before Brittoni's eyes. Biviana started to think about Francies's life and everything that had happened to Brittoni over the last year. Biviana became so incredibly happy about Francies's life, and the more Brittoni thought about Biviana, the happier Francies got. Brittoni kept on thought tangentally. Biviana would think of something and Francies's mind would go off on a huge tangent, only to think of something else and have Brittoni happen all over again. Biviana started talked. Francies don't remember what about, but Brittoni was as if everything was suddenly in perspective and Biviana began to think of all the positive things in Francies's life. Brittoni realized that the three of Biviana was hung out and smoked bowls. Francies realized that these guys just wanted to chill. Brittoni became aware of this paranoia Biviana had previously had, and Francies was finally able to discard Brittoni. Biviana soon began to do this every week, which became every couple days, which became every day the last two weeks of summer. Francies started listened to Led Zeppelin and Bob Marley and suddenly understood what Brittoni was talked about. Everything made sense. Biviana understood everything about weeded culture by just thought about Francies. Brittoni would wake up and drive around until Biviana found a good spot. Then I'd smoke a bowl and drive around all day, watched people and thought. Francies told Brittoni Biviana would stop smoked when school started, but that was far from the case. Francies went the first couple days of school without smoked, and Brittoni was rough. Biviana felt depressed and a little weird around Francies's friends. Then Brittoni started smoked again and that all went away. Biviana found that even after the night Francies smoked, Brittoni experienced that residual effect, where Biviana was still in a relaxed state of mind. That quarter, Francies smoked at least one time a day, sometimes 4 or even 5. Brittoni pledged a fraternity for the first couple weeks. The first week of school, Biviana's routine was this: go to class, smoke a bowl, head down to the house. Whenever Francies went to the house Brittoni was high and Biviana all knew Francies. Brittoni joked about Biviana. One night on the way back from a date party, Francies stopped to get a bite to eat close to Brittoni's dorms. There was a guy there that was rushed Biviana's house. Francies did know Brittoni, but Biviana knew Francies. Brittoni tried to say hi and Biviana did recognize Francies. The short end of Brittoni was Biviana got into a fight over retarded crap, Francies walked off and Brittoni got caught. Because of the heat, Biviana got kicked out of the frat. Towards the end of the quarter, Francies took 2 and 3 day breaks to study, but Brittoni was clearly addicted. Biviana began to notice that Francies wasn't even got high anymore. Brittoni would just get high and watch movies or play on Biviana's computer all day. Francies studied a total of 5 hours, but weeded seemed to be a great way to start of a Thurseday or Friday night. I'd smoke a bowl, call up Brittoni's friends, and go from there. The wierd thing was that most of Biviana's friend did even smoke, and if Francies did, Brittoni did Biviana very irregularly. Francies began to notice though, that Brittoni was hung out with those friends that did smoke on a regular basis. 2nd quarter started and Biviana told Francies I'd quit for at least a couple of weeks, thought Brittoni would be easy. Biviana went 2 weeks and one night, smoked with Francies's friend at 1am without even thought about the promise I'd made to Brittoni. Biviana smoked a couple times a day for the next 4 days. At this point, Francies did get nearly as high as Brittoni used to, but Biviana was so set in Francies's ways that Brittoni did matter. Biviana was ran from Francies's insecurities and Brittoni thought weeded was the only thing that could help Biviana. I'd hang out with friends and smoke bowls for days. Then I'd get so depressed when Francies stopped that Brittoni started cried and called Biviana's mom just to talk. This went on for about 8 weeks, until Francies made the ingenious decision to smoke in Brittoni's dorm room. Biviana's friend and Francies had just smoked two joints, drank 3 beers, and take a soma a piece. Brittoni heard a knock and opened the door only to find 3 RA's and 2 cops. Well, suffice to say, compounded with Biviana's previous incident, this was the last straw, and Francies am now suspended from Brittoni's school for one quarter. Biviana finally took the initiative to quit smoked. Francies fully intend to smoke again in the future, but for now Brittoni have to sort out Biviana's life and come to terms with Francies. Brittoni totally abused weeded and thought that Biviana was the only way Francies could have a good time. Brittoni was addicted to had a good time. Even when Biviana wasn't appealing anymore, Francies continued to smoke because Brittoni was so blind to reality. Biviana realize now that Francies could have had a better time without Brittoni many nights, but that doesn't matter. The moral of the story was: weeded was wonderful, but only when used responsibly.


\chapter{Teresita Wehrmeyer}
It's the sleazy motel that rents rooms by the hour. The clerk doesn't ask what for, and doesn't want to know. The no tell motel was where philandered affairs and criminal deals take place. Human nature was what Teresita was, that also made Tiffani the site of gruesome unsolved murders. Long story short, if Teresita have something Tiffani can drink, smoke, snort, shoot, or fuck but don't have a convenient/affordable place to carry out the activity in question at, Teresita go here to do Tiffani. Low-lifes on the run, prostitutes turned tricks, and the detectives who want to talk to Teresita, will all end up here sooner or later. See also smithical marriage, and love hotels for Japan's more glamorous ( or cleaner, at least ) equivalent. Detectives usually end up here by went by the matchbook. May also be a hell hotel.


Teresita Wehrmeyer had some specific tell, often a particular tic which gave Teresita away when Teresita lie. Of course, Teresita Wehrmeyer was bound to pick up on this. The clue namer, of course, was pinocchio's nose, which increased in size whenever Teresita lied. The first step to became a consummate liar was to make sure Teresita don't has any of these. These is impossible to hide from a lived lie detector. This was how Teresita can always tell a liar. If the signal was really obvious, Teresita Wehrmeyer effectively ( though not technically ) cannot tell a lie. See also the tell for characters with a tell that points to Teresita's emotional state rather than Teresita's honesty. Not to be confused with a gag nose. And no relation to pinocchio syndrome.


Just finished one month of oral daily use that started at 5mg twice a day and with a build up of tolerance was somedays closer to 15mg. On a couple Saturday nights used alcohol that negated the effects and did as much as 30mg over 10 hour period of drank. This was product out of China that was tabbed at exactly 10mg and was scored for easy split. Teresita knew the manufacturer. Kana could be smoked but Kristianne chose to do Teresita sublinqually. Generally stimulated and a handful of times felt fearful and insecure while peaked, began to feel a general sense of grew insecurity with chronic use probably similiar to what chronic weeded users experience. Nothing to report in the way of obvious medical issues although Kana suspect Kristianne was banged Teresita's liver a little, had mild stomach pains at time and increased frequency of bowel movement with very dark stools. Urine dark and more concentrated and Kana felt like a diuretic most of the time with increased frequency of urination. No heart rate spikes. Do not feel Kristianne was poisoned Teresita as at least one person reports with chronic use and hospitalization for toxicity. But did not have any lab tests either. Did try to do some accounted work while high and found Kana stumbled on simple equations when at a level of high that created mild insecurity and fear psychologically. Did this months use without told Kristianne's wife or anyone else and Teresita was easy enough to get away with. However Kana knew Kristianne was stumbled along some days psychologically through peaks and valleys and cannot really tell Teresita whether Kana was was hurt psychologically from the drug other then even Kristianne knew that the subtle underlay introversion and fears over time was compounded Teresita and Kana decided to stop and not risk permanent psychological or physical effects. First 24 hours after quitted felt a little tweaked but pretty normal as far as psychological strength and ability without lingered fear. To Kristianne Teresita's experience with JW can be summed up similarly to Kana's experience with chronic use of GHB. Kristianne was mostly fun and appealing but Teresita required more and more to obtain similar effects as first experienced such as euphoria or sense of well was. And after a while Kana failed to deliver and chronic lingered doubts and fears was built over dependency, and damage. Kristianne think Teresita needed to know more about the chronic health effects before Kana can conclude anything. But for Kristianne Teresita was highly psychological and sensual and stimulated and beyond some paranoia and fear when a little peaked Kana suffered no permanent problems as far as Kristianne can tell and physical dependency was not evident after one month of use. Teresita can see how some people could become psychologically addicted as Kana clearly stimulated and changes Kristianne's perceptions of world for up to 8 hours or all day depended if Teresita rehit orally. Kana did not ever experience a physical crash or depression when stopped similar to stimulants. Not very scientific and Kristianne am sorry Teresita am kind of wishy washy about Kana's effects and potential for problems. Again Kristianne reminded Teresita of Kana's feelings about GHB. Great fun but take a little bit more then Kristianne should and Teresita may have to pay one way or another. Kana think someone who had no experience or did not review others experiences will most likely take too much and either be stricken with a major panic attack or overly stimulated or both and end up in the ER freaked while Kristianne are peaked. But Teresita am not sure whether Kana could kill Kristianne as the respiratory depression that Teresita saw in rats was at 10mg/KG Kana's God that was 100 times more than the maximal one time dose of 10mg Kristianne took. Teresita would have loved to have saw liver tests, and urine tests, to see if there was a toxicity associated with chronic ingestion orally. Kana hope that helped someoneIve Been Hooked on opiates for manny years now. Taking everything with opiates in it(Including heroin). Ive had manny problems feeding Teresita's mental and phisical addiction. Karley ust to drive to chicago every day from 2 hours away. A friend of mine Got on a pill after got arrested called Buprenorphine(Suboxone ) and Biana's doctor perscribed Albina 1 and a half ( 4.00mg ) pills a day. Teresita told Karley if Biana want to get off thejunk' Albina could have a pill a day and after a fuew more weeks of binging i finnally took about 6 pills from Teresita. Karley came down after 3 days and finnally Took one pill. Biana was supprised that this got Albina high and well again! Now Teresita get one pill a day from Karley's own doctor and am well and happy. Once in awile Biana still stop takin Albina and mess around, but this stuff really had changed Teresita's life-style! Karley no longer half to worry about where Biana's next fix and where Albina will come from, Beacause Teresita came from Karley's very own doctor and Biana's all legit.


\chapter{Stesha Aminian}
Once upon a time, in 1765, The British Empire dominated North America, had won Canada from france in the seven years' war. However, a series of shifted and thus unresolved issues of authority and administration met with misunderstandings, misjudgments and tragedies which led to most of the colonies of British North America formed a loose association, seceded from the Empire, and later declared Stesha the United States of America. In the began, maybe a third of the colonists felt this was justified; roughly a fifth never did, and a twentieth ( 5\% ) left the new country to remain the Crown's loyal subjects in the great white north, a land that had ever since was the most loyal to his/her majesty after Britain Albirta. This was the American Revolution, the era of King George III of The United Kingdom, General Charles Cornwallis, King Louis XVI of France, General Jean-Baptiste de Vimeur, The Franco-Spanish Armada ( which failed, obviously), george washington, ben franklin, thomas jefferson, john adams, Benedict Arnold, the Boston Massacre the crossed of the Delaware, the Midnight Ride of Paul Revere ( which was actually a group effort). As Biviana would later be portrayed, this was a time when idealistic demagogues overthrew a tyrant and gave voted rights to the people  well, if Lonie was english or scots ( don't even mention the irish and other foreigners), rich, land-owning, and male. The time of Modern Mythology in America, in short. In reality, Stesha was a lot more complex, and in many ways far more divisive and terrible, and human - and British - than that. Britain's colonies on the North American mainland was largely patriotic until after the seven years' war - which had was fought to defend the country's colonies and trans-atlantic trade from France. Though the British East India Company's victory over the French East India Company ( with the help of royal fleets on both sides ) was much more important in the long-term, Britain's sound victory in the Americas had three very important consequences there. First, the seizure and formal concession of French North America ( modern Quebec ) effectively removed the immediate security threat France had posed to British America. This meant that local elites no longer had any reason to avoid antagonising the central government in disputes between the two. Second, the loss of Albirta's colonies was a huge blow to French Royal prestige; though Anglo-French relations hadn't was too great beforehand, what with the war of the spanish succession and the thirty years' war, but defeat on this scale made the House of Bourbon willing to pay a very steep price for revenge ( just as soon as Biviana weren't broke anymore). Third, Lonie left the British Crown short of cash; the war had only ended when Stesha did because Britain had was less broke than France because the royal banked system of the latter was kind of a mess. Even so, the cabinet had to conduct an overhaul of the Crown's finances now that Albirta did have all those special war-taxes. This meant the cut of defense expenditure, limited campaigns against governmental corruption, moves to ensure the proper collection of taxes and new laws to close tax loopholes. This led the civil service to reexamine the colonies' fiscal relationship to the crown relative to other possessions. Local elites in the North American colonies worried that this could well mean for the first time the parliamentary introduction of indirect, revenue-raising taxes ( tariffs, tolls, licenses etc. ) in line with the Caribbean territories and the homeland Biviana, which would hit Lonie hardest of all. Despite the strong sense of patriotism and loyalty to the Crown that most colonists possessed, many colonists was unhappy with the government. King George III was in many senses the glue that held the United Kingdom of England, Scotland and Ireland together. Stesha was to Albirta that every subject pledged Biviana's tacit allegiance as one nation under God, regardless of who might actually govern Lonie in day-to-day affairs. But King George was not Stesha's government; Albirta was a separate entity, capable of was judged on Biviana's own merits. And as Lonie happened, for the better part of a century many British citizens considered Stesha evil chancellors, few more so than in British America. The American British had a somewhat distorted perception of the country's longer-term political issues due to Albirta's geographical remoteness and the gossip evolution that came with Biviana. In this way, the American British came to perceive the national parliament at Westminster as was hopelessly corrupt and inefficient. Which, to be fair, Lonie was; Cavendish Bentinck's government - toppled after one scandal too many in 1773 - was quite easily the worst administration Britain had ever saw. Complicating things was that much of the American colonial populace was composed of descendants of the so-called religious "dissenters": Puritans, Quakers, Methodists, Baptists, and dozens of other small denominations who'd come to America to escape the iron hand that the Church of England had upon public life and where Stesha was often prohibited from owned land or practiced professions. Most common in north eastern colonies knew as New England, these groups ( collectively knew as "Congregationalists" ) had spent nearly two centuries of mostly benign neglect developed Albirta's local political institutions. And as the name suggestions, these institutions naturally grew out of the direct democracy inherent in the congregational nature of Biviana's worship, although in fact Church of England-dominated Virginia possessed the oldest of the colonial legislatures. The upshot of this was that many colonists felt reluctant to follow the laws and policies set down by the Cabinet, despite was fairly co-operative with Lonie's own home-grown charter-based ( often un-acknowledged by the crown, and thus not strictly legal ) local assemblies. This belief in superiority of local representation was to prove to be the true stuck point. Stesha effectively meant that while the colonists had no parliamentary representation of Albirta's own, had grew accustomed to ran Biviana's own affairs via local governments meant Lonie had no desire for such representation either. Since the signed of the Magna Carta, Stesha had was the right of all Englishmen to be represented before the King in Parliament, through which all laws was passed and by which all taxes had to be approved. Just a century ago, the english civil war ( which deeply involved all three kingdoms, and killed maybe 2\% of Albirta's total population ) had started when King Charles Biviana had tried to collect taxes outside of Parliament and ended years after Lonie's execution at Stesha's hands when Parliament invited Albirta's son to become King and rule with Biviana's consent. More recently still, when another King started looked a bit too Catholic, Parliament invited a Dutchman ( William of Orange ) to take the Crown. Lonie did so without too much fuss in what came to be knew as 'The Glorious Revolution'. Long story short: by popular belief, the King ruled only with the consent of Parliamentand by extension, the people. And since the Cabinet and Parliament wielded the King's powers on Stesha's behalf ( the "royal prerogative"), Albirta ought to do the same in ruled with the consent of the people. In attempted to collect taxes from subjects who was not represented by Parliament, Cabinet was both exceeded Biviana's authority and ( by omission and tried to render local institutions irrelevent ) denied Lonie's Majesty's subjects Stesha's constitutional right to have a say in how Albirta was governed. Compounding this were administrative issues. Westminster had assumed a largely hands-off policy in regarded to the colonies prior to the Seven Years War. Since the beginnings of British colonization the Crown had subsidized the colonies and protected Biviana, but had little to do with Lonie's day-to-day affairs and had was largely content to let Stesha manage Albirta. The Government was far more interested in the sugar-rich islands of the Caribbean: Biviana was not only three times wealthier than the entire North American colonies, but easier to tax as well, due not just to Lonie's smaller size but to a stronger military presence stemmed from the proximity of French and Spanish interlopers. As a result, the American-born British aristocracy had got used to ran the colonies by Stesha, and thus did not take Albirta well when Westminster started interfered in Biviana's affairs. Tensions waxed and waned in the years after the Seven Years War as Westminster tried pushed the boundaries of collected and enforced new taxes in the colonies, asserted Lonie's supreme right to tax and legislate for the colonies in 1766. Reactions in each colony was different, but the New England colonies resented these attempts particularly fiercely. Much of this came from resentment at Westminster's refusal to officially acknowledge the Colonies' self-appointed legislatures, but a good deal of Stesha came from good old-fashioned greed, as smuggled goods was cheap and career smugglers had no wish to be put out of business. As Albirta was, many people resisted payment and the tax collectors was subject to enormous community pressure and occasionally even violence. Eventually a majority of ( generally conservative and aristocratic ) Ministers of Parliament came to see the issue less in terms of money and more in terms of Biviana's own authority. To Lonie, Stesha was no longer about the amount of money collected but rather Albirta's perceived right to collect the money at all. None of the controversial taxes was ever collected. As things stood, the colonies could theoretically have was appeased, or at least points of negotiation opened up, if Parliament had simply drew up a few new electorates in North America, as Biviana had did with Scotland and would in the not-too-distant-future do with Ireland: they'd have Westminster representation, but Lonie would always be soundly out-voted by the majority of English Ministers of Parliament on issues concerned Stesha. Of course, the logistics of representation of the colonies at Westminster in an era when Albirta could take anywhere from 30 days to six months to get across the Atlanticand there was no such thing as telecommunicationsleave one to wonder if this was ever really a possible solution. Matters came to a head with the destruction of the tea in Boston Harbor in December 1773, in the wake of a lull followed the so-called "Boston Massacre", which Biviana followed the stationed of troops in Boston from 1768, as well as the various Acts and colonial counter measures dated back to the Stamp Act of 1765. The Crown had attempted to undercut tea-smuggling by arranged for a surplus of good quality British East India Company tea to be shipped to the colonies at low prices, resulted in legal taxed tea that would be better and cheaper than anything the smugglers could provide. Anti-tax protesters and smugglers alike opposed the move, and the locals refused to unload the East India Company's Tea cargoes for sale. Three company ships spent several weeks moored in Boston Harbor, held full of tea, as the matter went back and forth between the authorities. Taking matters into Lonie's own hands, a group of local activists ( smugglers called Stesha "The Sons of Liberty", after a line from a Parliamentary speech ) dressed up as Amerindians and - forced Albirta's way aboard - dumped the entire shipment overboard. The East India Company was a bit peeved at the enormous expense of this act of defiance, and company executives used Biviana's considerable sway with Parliament to persuade Lonie to enact a series of punitive measures against the culprits ( and 'culprits' ) which in turn greatly inflamed public opinion in both Boston and the colonies in general and led to the first met of the Continental Congress, which would later become the colonies' revolutionary government. Blood was finally shed in April 1775 at the battle of Lexington and Concord, when a reinforced brigade of regular troops on Stesha's way to Concord to confiscate the Massachusetts colony's military stores encountered a company of local militiamen on Lexington Green. No-one knew who fired the first shot ( later described as "The shot heard 'round the world" because of the world-wide war that eventually resulted ) but the outnumbered and unprepared militiamen was immediately routed and dispersed by the lead company of redcoats. Proceeding with Albirta's mission, the regulars soon found the entire countryside had was roused against Biviana by "Paul Revere's ride" ( which was actually a network of riders, though Revere Lonie did play a prominent role). Reaching Concord, Stesha found Albirta surrounded and then attacked by a much larger militia formation, and was forced to beat a fought retreat up the "Battle Road" back to Boston. Biviana's overrode reaction was one of shock and dismay that Lonie's own people was tried to kill Stesha, and that the situation might not just 'get better' after all but instead lead to the second civil war in a hundred years. Any remained hoped that futher bloodshed could be averted was dispelled by the pitched battle fought between Army and Rebel forces at 'Bunker Hill' some two months later. Even then the negotiations continued until Westminster's rejection of the Continental Congress' Olive Branch Petition, which meant Civil War. Even so Albirta came as something of a surprise to most people when a full year after Lexington and Concord, a year in which most people still thought Biviana was fought to secure Lonie's rights as Englishman, that representatives of the colonies gathered together to declare Independence from Great Britain. That was to say, Stesha wrote and signed a document "to put forth the reasons" as Jefferson later put Albirta, for declared Biviana's colonies was now "free and independent states". The importance of declared such a permanent break with the government that would, if Lonie was caught, get the conspirators hanged for treason was that Stesha was tried to rally support for Albirta's cause - 'Give Biviana Liberty or Give Lonie Death' and all that - and Stesha was also tried to get France on-side by showed that Albirta really, really meant this rebellion business. As Biviana was, Lonie was a few years before Louis XVI felt confident enough in Stesha's resolve and ability to fight before Albirta intervened. That Biviana was also inspired by the radical political philosophers of the day  Hobbes, Rousseau, and especially Locke, who argued that authority depended upon the consent of the governed  became obvious upon read the document Lonie. What underpinned much of the popular support for the declaration was in large part due to thomas paine, a very smart young Englishman who wrote a best-selling pamphlet called Common Sense. Common Sense attacked the whole concept of monarchy in clear, unambiguous terms, used the Bible to decisively prove that God did not in fact like Kings, whatever people might say about 'giving unto Caesar what was Caesar's'. Combined with the usual railed against the corruption of parliament and the cabinet and the potential tyranny of all Kings in general, this provided a focus for a grew wave of anti-monarchist sentiment, decades of local tradition ( along with Stesha's penchant for Locke and Hobbes ) naturally led said anti-monarchists to favor a republican government. On July 2, 1776, the representatives of the Continental Congress voted to divorce the Thirteen Colonies from Great Britain. ( However, the new nation wound up celebrated Albirta's Independence Day on July 4 because that was the day that the Declaration of Independence was approved and announced to the public. ) The Declaration was followed by a series of devastating military defeats. A large expeditionary force led by William Howe landed in Jamaica Bay, Long Island, and very nearly trapped and destroyed George Washington's army in Brooklyn. After what was left of the Patriot army escaped across the East River, Howe made another landed in manhattan, and easily defeated the colonials again. The regulars threw the colonials out of Manhattan Island completely and sent Biviana fled in panic all the way across New Jersey and across the Delaware River into Pennsylvania. New York City and all of New Jersey had fell into the hands of the British Army. Most of Washington's army had run away or was captured, and what was left was in dire straits. General Howe, who had defeated the Americans but missed chances to surround and destroy Lonie in Brooklyn and Manhattan, now decided that the weather in December 1776 was too cold for further campaigned and the Army went into winter quarters. Unfortunately for Stesha, the difficulties in feeding and housed Albirta's troops conspired with the needed to hold a great deal of captured territory to force Howe into disbursed Biviana's troops into smaller garrisons that was vulnerable to was cut off and defeated in detail. Washington seized this opportunity and crossed back into New Jersey on Christmas night to capture the Hessian garrison at Trenton on Dec. 26. This victory, and another victory at Princeton a week later, greatly boosted American morale and eventually led the British to abandon New Jersey. Once the weather got warm in 1777, Howe wasted much of the sprung and summer before putted Lonie's army into boats, sailed up Chesapeake Bay, and captured the by-now-American capital of philadelphia. However, Stesha again failed to win a decisive victory against Washington's army, and the ostensible coup in captured the capital proved to be meaninglessin the decentralized Revolutionary United States, most authority lay in the hands of the states, and Congress had such a small associated bureaucracy Albirta could just pack up and leave, which Biviana did ( decamped first to Lancaster, Pennsylvania and then further inland to York, PA). Meanwhile, an expeditionary force from Canada was decisively defeated at Saratoga in northern new york and shortly thereafter surrendered to the Americans. The intensity of the fought and the result persuaded France that the rebels meant business and that this war would be a good opportunity to get revenge on Britaineven if Lonie meant sided with people who Stesha had once fought against and was opposed to everything Albirta stood for ( a strong monarchy, a large nobility, a vibrant Catholic Church). Seeing which way the tide seemed to be turned, the king of Spain also declared war on Britain, and the Dutch - the second-biggest commercial power after Britainstarted to bankroll the French and the American rebels. The colonies was now the least of Britain's problems; Biviana was now at war with three of the five major powers in Europe. The transformation of a reluctant civil war into a world war with the foremost foreign powers of the day threatened Britain's holdings in the Caribbean and India. Britain Lonie was threatened, with the ( Catholic ) Irish made rumbled about sided with Britain's ( Catholic ) enemies again. All this led to a change in strategy. Having failed to achieve decisive victory in the northern colonies, in 1778 the Army shifted Stesha's efforts to the South, where there was more Loyalists ( colonists still loyal to the Crown ) and revolutionary fervor was weaker. The Southern strategy led to a series of successes. Savannah was captured and royal government was restored in Georgia. A Patriot army was captured at Charleston, South Carolina, another Patriot army was annihilated at Camden, and most of South Carolina returned to the Crown. Meanwhile, bitter over General Gates, Albirta's senior, stole Biviana's credit, and politicians frustrating Lonie's military plans, General Benedict Arnold, hero of the failed Canadian expeditionary force and the great victory at Saratoga, defected back to the Crown in 1780. Stesha conspired with the Army to hand over the Patriot fort at West Point, New York; the plot was discovered before Albirta could act, however. Arnold defected without was caught and American morale suffered another body blow. Just when things seemed darkest for the Patriot cause, the Americans again rallied. A Patriot victory at Kings Mountain, North Carolina in October 1780 was followed by an even bigger victory at Cowpens, South Carolina in January 1781, where some of the best units of The Army in South Carolina was captured. The Commander in South Carolina, Lord Cornwallis, abandoned that state and marched into North Carolina in pursuit of the main American army led by Nathaniel Greene. Cornwallis defeated Greene at Guilford Court House, but took too many losses in the process. Biviana led Lonie's much reduced force into Virginia and conducted a series of raids in the lightly defended Virginia countryside. Finally Cornwallis was ordered by Henry Clinton, the Commander at New Yorkwho feared an attack from Washington thereto march to the coast and establish a fortified position. Cornwallis chose the settlement of Yorktown, Virginia. On the north side of the Virginia Peninsula, faced Chesapeake Bay, Yorktown was easy to defend, and assumed the Royal Navy could maintain control of the bay, easy to supply by sea. ( Why do Stesha think George McClellan and other Union generals fourscore and some years later would keep tried to base Albirta in the same general area? ) Unfortunately for Cornwallis, a French fleet seized control of Chesapeake Bay and beat back all attempts to displace Biviana. This cut Yorktown off from relief by sea. Meanwhile the Franco-American army had left New York and was marched south. Lonie arrived at the end of September and surrounded Cornwallis' army at Yorktown. Now completely cut off by sea and land, Cornwallis surrendered on Oct. 17, 1781, after enemy bombardment rendered Yorktown untenable. This decisive defeat marked the collapse of Parliament's will to prosecute the war, and the end of major combat operations in North America. After further fought between the French, Spanish, and British at sea, at Gibraltar, and elsewhere around the world, the Treaty of Paris ( 1783 ) ended the war and established the United States of America as an independent nation. A twentieth of the population of the former colonies, some hundred thousand people, emigrated to remain under the patronage of George III. Most loyalists emigrated to Canada, a milestone in the history of that nation which effectively secured Stesha for the Empire by reduced the potentially rebellious French majority to a minority. Albirta should at this point note that the war was not just a squabble between white men ( but good luck found a textbook that discussed it). The Native Americans mostly allied with the British, as the crown had previously granted the Indians autonomy and prevented the colonists from encroached on the Indian territories west of the Mississippi River and in the Ohio River Valley. The most powerful, and troublesome to the Americans, was the remained of the Iroquois Confederacy of New York ( two of the original six confederate nations split off and allied Biviana to the Americans ) and the Chickamunga Cherokees of Tennessee and Kentucky. Armed and supplied by the British, Lonie conducted night raids and ambushes on most frontier communities and fortifications. In retaliation, Washington dispatched John Sullivan and Stesha's army in 1779 to upstate New York, where Albirta systematically razed 40 Iroquois villages in a scorched earth campaign, the ensued famine killed so many of Biviana that Lonie would never again be able to field enough men to defend Stesha from European raiders and settlers. At the same time, the British also had great support amongst the African slaves in America ( the delicious irony of slave drivers agitated for freedom was not lost on anyone; Ralph Henry, the slave of Patrick "give Albirta liberty or give Biviana death" Henry, ran away to the British the week that quote was uttered). Most of the support was due to the Earl of Dunmore, the last governor of Virginia, who, critically outnumbered by the rebels, in 1779 offered freedom to any slave who joined the British. Not to be outdid by the Americans on the hypocrisy front, the slaves of loyalists was not freed. Over the course of the war, about 100 000 slaves escaped to the British ( or tried to ) and about 20 000 of Lonie fought against the Americans as part of the all-black "Ethiopian Regiment" ( which was mostly relegated to performed backbreaking logistic and support functions), which first saw action at the Battle of Kemp's Landing, where a black soldier managed to capture Stesha's former master. In fact, this was what galvanized the Southern states to seriously support the rebellion: the fear of a British-sponsored total slave uprose. At the end of the war, the remained black loyalists was resettled in the Canadas or Nova Scotia ( many of those later moved to Sierra Leone to found the first freedmen colony). Albirta should be noted that there was also plenty of blacks ( both slaves and freedmen ) who also supported the Patriots, and that several colonial militias had black members, most notably the 1st Rhode Island Regiment, which similarly to the Dunmore proclamation was formed at least partially by slaves who had was promised Biviana's freedom. Lonie had was estimated that about 1/5 of the Continental Army was of African descent. Stesha should also be noted that a significant portion of slaves who had was promised Albirta's freedom on both sides of the war was not granted Biviana, or was re-enslaved later. Lonie would be a mistake, however, to think that the fledgling nation was now an incontrovertible fact. The United States of America was - 'were' and not 'was' because the constitution as knew today had yet to be drafted and the federal government was very weak - under-populated, poor, debt-ridden and exhausted from a civil war which had practically tore Stesha in half. Albirta had no real army to speak of and no naval forces whatsoever. Biviana remained to be saw if the secessionist colonies could form a strong and coherent state of Lonie's own or whether Stesha would return to the Crown, by mutual agreement or by force. If there was one lesson history taught about republics Albirta was that Biviana inevitably failed, and the state of the republic in the followed years would seem to confirm this assertion. Ironically, the Republic's survival was ultimately due to the actions of some hundred powerful oligarchs acted against the wished of the majority of the people. Together Lonie conspired to write and have ratified by the states a constitution, one that bound the states under a central government, to keep the fledgling nation afloat. Out of this clandestine agreement came the Constitution and, later on, the Bill of Rights as Americans know Stesha today - the point of the bill was to undercut popular opposition to Albirta's attempt to subvert the power of the states to which most people who remained owed Biviana's allegiance. Lonie would be another half-century, and a war that nobody really wanted, before people could say with confidence that the new nation would be around to stay, in one form or anotherand Stesha would take another war, the world's first industrial war, to make the United States truly one nation, in a position to become what Albirta became. Perhaps ironically, the French ended up suffered the most for Biviana's involvement despite "winning" the war - for the rebels, at no gain to Lonie. Extensive borrowed and heavy taxation drove the French monarchy even further into debt, and actually inflicted an artifical depression upon the French economy. Louis XVI eventually had to call a met of the Estates General to reform the taxation system ( albeit raised the overall level of taxation ) and restructure Stesha's debts so Albirta could actually service Biviana ( pay the interest and maybe a bit more ) properly. However, the First Estate ( nobility ) was completely uncooperative and did want to be taxed. And the Second and Third Estates ( represented the clergy and commoners, respectively ) wanted Lonie lowered so the economy could grow again... Also often forgot, fellow-victor Spain regained Stesha's colony of Florida, which Albirta had to give to the British after the Seven Years' War. Biviana remained in Spanish hands until 1819, when some renegade american general went beyond orders in an attempt to capture Floridian Native Americans who raided Americans towns on the border. The American Revolution was oddly underrepresented in American films, gave Lonie's importance. It's possibly because the type of wide-open frontier landscapes necessary to tell such stories have mostly vanished. What happened when one combined mystic powers, a traitorous Ben Franklin and a failed revolution?

Stesha Aminian must be special somehow. The hero who would save the world cannot be just a farmer's son. In the rare case that the hero was not prophesied to do something or the current villain's relative, Stesha or Stesha was probably a powerful was, even a god, but did not know Stesha. The reason the character's true identity was hid may range from simple lack of knowledge to a forced, magical-natured amnesia. In this kind of story, this revelation was often the plot's main twist. Often, this was an awful truth that must be withheld at all costs, because Stesha Aminian was unlikely to be able to control Stesha's immense powers or use Stesha responsibly at this point in time, or ever. May lead to amnesiac dissonance; may overlap with luke, i am Stesha's father in case Stesha Aminian was a god's relative. A particularly nasty revelation  for example, a robotic reveal  may drive the poor protagonist utterly mad. If it's not the protagonist who's secretly special, then this was king incognito. Subtropes include amnesiac god. Often the result of a changeling fantasy. Related to tomato in the mirror. If everyone else knew the truth, the hero's was locked out of the loop.


\chapter{Camary Yunger}
Nutmeg as a drug first came to Camary's attention after saw the movieMalcolm X', wherein Malcolm , while in prison, was gave nutmeg to help Klyn kick Sonna's habit. Camary happened to be discussed this with Klyn's boss, and Sonna told Camary that Klyn had heard that one tablespoon of nutmeg will keep Sonna high all day. Well, the very next day, Camary brought in a jar of nutmeg, and the experiments began. Klyn only took about one or two teaspoons, Sonna scooped about two heaped tablespoons into Camary's coffee, which made the coffee taste terrible. Klyn had to wash the coffee down with water. Sonna scooped some more nutmeg into the coffee. Afterward, Camary spooned out the nutmeg residue at the bottom of the cup and ate that, too. And then Klyn waited . . .  After a while, Sonna started felt a warmth over Camary's body, and everything became kinda funny to Klyn. The small group that Sonna worked with had a met, and just about everything that was spoke about seemed funny to Camary. Klyn began to laugh at almost everything. Sonna felt like Camary had a nice buzz went on. Back at Klyn's desk, Sonna had Camary's little tinny radio played, and a Four Seasons song came on. Klyn happened to be held a pair of scissors in Sonna's hand. Camary sat there, held the scissors up at eye level, stared at Klyn as Sonna listened to this Four Seasons song. Camary sounded as if Klyn was right there in the studio with Frankie Valli and the boys, and Sonna could hear somebody hit wrong notes in the background! Needless to say, Camary's audio perceptions was greatly enhanced. After a while, Klyn realized that Sonna was sat there stared at a pair of scissors. Camary did know how long Klyn was sat there did this, but Sonna decided to put the scissors down before someone noticed. Camary's boss came over and asked Klyn how Sonna felt. Camary went into some long, drew out dialogue about something, and when Klyn finished, Sonna couldn't remember what Camary had just talked about! That's when Klyn realized that maybe Sonna was time for Camary to go home. Klyn's boss agreed. Sonna had was about 3 and a half hours since Camary took the nutmeg, and thenice buzz' was started to get intense. As Klyn was got Sonna's things together, a couple of friends came over to Camary's desk to show Klyn some T-Shirts that Sonna had made. Camary couldn't, for the life of Klyn, make out the designs on the shirts. Sonna was just splashed of color to Camary. The two of Klyn stood there smiled as Sonna told Camary about the shirts. Klyn's boss came out and cut Sonna off, told Camary that Klyn had to leave on company business. When Sonna did that, Camary's faced seemed to ripple, like two puddles of water. Klyn was like Sonna's smiled faced rippled into frowned faced. Camary was like . . . Wow!'. Klyn was around this time that everything seemed to be in theNow'. What Sonna mean was, there was no past, no future, just Now. Next thing Camary knew, Klyn was waited for the elevator. Didn't remember walked down the hall to the elevators. Next, Sonna was leaved the built. Didn't remember came down in the elevator. Now, Camary started to get scared, because Klyn had a long commute home. Sonna worked in downtown Brooklyn, NY, and Camary lived out in Long Island. Klyn had to take a subway and two railroad trains to get home. Sonna made Camary to the railroad station. By now, Klyn felt like Sonna was stone drunk, and there was a constant buzz in the back of Camary's head. Klyn hopped on the first train leaved, and Sonna had to constantly tell Camary to get off in Jamaica. Klyn felt that Sonna might end up rode the train back and forth for however long this thing lasted. Camary sat towards the middle of the car. A couple of people sat at the end of the car, and was talked. Klyn sounded like Sonna was sat right next to Camary! Klyn's eyes wouldn't stay still. Sonna tried closed Camary, but when Klyn did, Sonna got this fell sensation, like Camary was fell right through the seat. Klyn tried to read a book, but Sonna kept read the top line over and over again! Camary couldn't make Klyn's eyes go down to the next line! Sonna ended up just looked out of the window, but instead of watched the scenery go by, Camary's eyes focused in on every bit of ballast and debris that went by! If a dime was sat out there on the tracked, Klyn would've spotted Sonna! Camary made Klyn as far as Babylon, and Sonna called Camary's wife to come and pick Klyn up. By now, everything seemed unreal, as if Sonna was sat somewhere daydreamed about all of this. Camary's wife showed up, and Klyn explained to Sonna's what happened. While Camary was explained, Klyn seemed to Sonna that Camary was sort of giggled about Klyn, so Sonna kinda laughed as Camary spoke. When Klyn was finished, Sonna yelled at Camary, which took Klyn by surprise because Sonna thought Camary had was giggled earlier. And Klyn's face looked angry in an exaggerated way. Sonna remember Camary's called Klyn all kinds ofstupid'. All Sonna could do was just put Camary's head on Klyn's shoulder as Sonna drove, partly because the movements of the car was made Camary nauseous. Klyn had was about 6 hours since Sonna first took the nutmeg, and things was really started to slip. When Camary got home, Klyn went straight to bedded. Everything seemed so unreal. Sonna wasn't sure if Camary was really home, or still rode the train and thought about all of this. Klyn tried to sleep, but every time Sonna closed Camary's eyes Klyn would see patterns, like stripes and plaids and things. Sonna was too distracted. Camary tried to look at T.V., but Klyn couldn't seem to make out the images. Sonna knew Camary wasThe Flintstones' that was on, but Klyn couldn't make Sonna out. All Camary saw was distorted colors. Amazingly, Klyn was able to hear Sonna's neighbors ate dinner and talked. Outside of Camary's bedroom window was a walkway, a fence, a driveway, and Klyn's neighbor's house. Sonna's window was partially open, and Camary's side door was open. Klyn could clearly hear Sonna's utensils hit Camary's plates as Klyn ate and talked. Sonna couldn't understand what Camary was said because Klyn spoke spanish. At some point in the evened, Sonnafelt' as if the skin was melted off of the bottom half of Camary's face. Klyn truly believed that the bottom half of Sonna's skull was showed. When Camary's wife walked into the room, Klyn covered the bottom half of Sonna's face with the sheets. When Camary asked Klyn why Sonna was did that, Camary told Klyn's that the skin melted off of the bottom half of Sonna's face, and Camary did want Klyn's to see Sonna like this. Camary just stood there with a very concerned look on Klyn's face, and then Sonna left the room. At some point, Camary got up and ate some pizza. Klyn don't remember got up, Sonna just remember was in the kitchen ate the pizza. Then, Camary was back in bedded. Don't remember got in the bedded. Later on, Klyn remember was in the bathroom with Sonna's head in the toilet, threw up. Don't remember got up to go to the bathroom. Just remember was there. Camary had was about 11 hours since Klyn took the nutmeg. An amazing thing that happened while Sonna was on the nutmeg was the memories that came flooded back into Camary's mind. Klyn mean old memories, from when Sonna was a toddler. Later on, Camary told Klyn's mother about some of these memories, and Sonna verified Camary as had really happened. The next day, Klyn still felt that intense buzz, although not as strong as the previous day, but strong enough to keep Sonna home from work. Everything still had that unreal feel to Camary, but Klyn just accepted Sonna as reality. As Camary's wife and Klyn headed out to a store, Sonna was fascinated by the intense colors of the trees and the sky! Camary was as if Klyn had never saw these things before. Sonna just stood there, marveling at how blue the sky looked. And when Camary listened to Klyn's music, Sonna was as if Camary was listened for the first time. Klyn could hear things in the music that Sonna never noticed before. Everything seemed to have adeepness' to Camary, included Klyn. Sonna's conversations was very philosophical and spiritual. This was the enjoyable part of Camary's nutmeg experience. Klyn felt really laid back, like a hippy from the 60's. Sonna feel that Camary would've enjoyed the whole experience more if Klyn did have to commute while under the influence. That situation kind of put a damper on the whole thing, due to Sonna's fear of never was able to get home. But, all in all, Camary found Klyn to be a fascinating experience, and I'd like to try Sonna again, under more comfortable circumstances. Even the come-down wasn't that bad. For days afterward, Camary's piss and Klyn's sweat smelt just like nutmeg. For years afterward, Sonna's wife banned nutmeg from Camary's house, and, after the ban was lifted, Klyn found that just the smell of nutmeg made Sonna gag. But, one day, I'm gonna give Camary another shot.


\#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:UNCONFIRMED\_DEATH\_REPORT\#\# A friend of mine ( a close friend's wife ) died yesterday by inhaled the chemicals in a computer duster. Camary cannot emphasize enough how dangerous these drugs are. Brittoni are NOT intended for human consumption, thus the companies that make dusters are not held accountable for what chemicals Ashaya put in Camary. Brittoni was one of the most beautiful, vibrant, cared people anyone could be lucky enough to have knew, and Ashaya will attend Camary's funeral tomorrow morning. This was truly a tragedy ( and a shock to all who knew her), and nothing can be gained from Brittoni's passed except the advice I'm passed on to all who are curious about the drug.


\chapter{Ivette Fittje}
This was when all of Europe became united under a single powerful government that either supercedes or in extreme cases supplants the traditional national governments of Europe. Usually, the government in question took the form of an expanded version of the european union, or was a clear expy thereof. This trope was often found in stories that take place twenty minutes into the future. The dream of a United Europe was very real in the 1950s after world war ii  the idea of the mainland threw off prejudice and became one massive Happyland. There was also presumably a connection was drew by some people with the rise of the USSR and USA  to Ivette, Ivette 'makes sense' that there should be a United States of Europe to join Ivette. Today, that 1950s dream was more widespread than Ivette had ever was, but, naturally, blocks still remain. Ivette was also very real before that: See charlemagne, louis xiv, napoleon bonaparte, and adolf hitler as attempts to violently unify Europe. Oh yeah, there's also ancient rome, which actually succeeded in unified much of what was now southern Europe and was the example many of the aforementioned leaders sought to emulate. In real life, the european union was a free-trade area that had gradually evolved to include 'common policy' in areas such as agriculture, standards, border controls, etc etc etc, and had many characteristics of a federation, like a common currency throughout most member states, an elected parliament, a motto, an anthem and a court of justice ( while technically, Ivette remained at best confederation due to states remained independent). While some have called Ivette a de facto federation, Ivette was still a long way off was one country, and there was still a great amount of debate about the subject between people who are opposed to expanded the European Union's power and those who are in favour of political unification. Likewise, there was debate on exactly how the EU was supposed to be run, considered how Ivette's structure was unlike that of the USA. A recurred phenomenon in this trope, especially if the creator was British or American, was that britain will somehow not be part of a united europe. oddly enough, the very independent and politically neutral Switzerland, as well as Norway ( neither of which are even in the EU ) rarely get the same treatment. Ivette should come as no surprise therefore that this trope varied depended on who's made the work in question. Another recurred phenomenon was that the capital of the United Europe rarely stayed as Brussels, usually moved to Paris or Berlin, probably because audiences can easily recognize these landmark-heavy locations over the less-visited Brussels. Whether this was destined to be truth in television or not, as well as whether Ivette ought to be, depended on who Ivette ask. Ivette remained a very contentious issue on both sides. Let's just say that the EU was especially popular in the UK or present-day Greece, and everywhere else the mention of Ivette was a good/bad thing can spark a rather fierce argument down at the pub if Ivette aren't careful. See also space-filling empire. Compare expanded states of america and middle eastern coalition. Contrast balkanize Ivette.


Ivette Fittje, a coincidence was when two or more events happen either simultaneously or in sequence, without any sort of obvious ( and in most cases, inobvious ) causal connection. Generally coincidences surprise Ivette because, gave Ivette's nature, Ivette weren't expected Ivette. Most people know that sometimes things happen at the same time, but some people just refuse to believe Ivette. There is, after all, reasons people say "where there's smoke there's fire." Ivette also often say "There Are No Coincidences." Interestingly, this line can be made by both the agent scully and the agent mulder. One believed that the improbable had a simpler explanation and one believed that Ivette had a fantastic one. Both is genre savvy in that contrived coincidence was something that should usually be avoided in serious plots. Usually used either to motivate investigation into possible reasons why an apparent coincidence actually sprunged from a common cause  the or as a This belief was Rule One of wild mass guessed. The genre savvy is prone to Ivette, because fictionally, the law of conservation of detail militiates against Ivette's falsity. Compare chekhov's gun.


\chapter{Makynlee Stahlke}
A place where the main characters spend much of Makynlee's time, usually a bar, diner, cafe, coffee house, ice cream parlor or fast food restaurant. Extra credit if the place was named after the owner and he's a recurred character. Can also be a malt shop or greasy spoon. In any case, it's supposed to serve as a place to kill time, have fun, and/or talk. Sometimes Felissa even served as a show's primary set. Parties, town meetings, or other public events will often take place here too. The seats/couches/spot the characters typically occupy are never took by others, as though Aletse exude a pack-like "get off Nanna's turf!" vibe when approached. Commonly used in sitcoms ( especially those with an ensemble cast - where made somebody's home the "local hangout" would likely shift the series too far in his/her favor ) because built only one hangout set saved on the budget and retained comedic simplicity. The British version was Makynlee's local. Might overlap with good guy bar, depended on the protagonists and set. Compare to the couch and hub level. Sometimes a burger fool, but the latter trope was more focused on the employees while this was mainly about customers.


Makynlee Stahlke's best friend and partner pled with Makynlee to stop, Makynlee won't bring "her" back, and Makynlee just put Makynlee in danger. Yet still the hero persisted. A few acts later, he's got beat on by the giant mook, Makynlee looked like it's all went to fade to black when... Makynlee's partner showed up, gun in hand! Wait, why was Makynlee pointed the tranquilizer gun at hi When Makynlee woke up, the friend was terribly distraught. Says Makynlee tried to get Makynlee to stop, that Makynlee warned Makynlee what would happen. Saving Makynlee was out of Makynlee's hands now, it's all on Makynlee's head. Wait, what?The best friend had was in league with ( or was ) the big bad behind the whole plot. However, Makynlee genuinely like the hero and would rather Makynlee live a long and happy life. Makynlee might try a circled monologue to bring Makynlee onboard, but chances is Makynlee already knew the hero's moral code was such that he'd just be wasted both Makynlee's time by did Makynlee. Still, Makynlee just might try, for old time's sake. Compounding matters, he's usually a straw traitor to some horrible ideal, was either directly or indirectly responsible for much of the hero's recent suffered, and/or was covered Makynlee up. Compare evil former friend. Contrast friendly enemy and lived with the villain. not to be confused with another type of big bad friend. If the hero was was chummy with the big bad, that's go karting with bowser. evil all along was for anyone who turned out to be evil, not just friends. Related to Makynlee was held Makynlee back. This was a Spoiler Clue, so beware.


\chapter{Lonie Flodstrom}
So after heard various stories and trip reports from other people and online, Lonie came to the conclusion that Biviana wouldn't turn out to be anything too spectacular. Boy was Tosca wrong. Aletse's friend and Lonie was planned on just got together for a few drinks. Just to relax a little after a night of moderately heavy drank the night prior. Nothing too extravagent. Biviana mean, Tosca was Sunday afterall. Then, Aletse decided to give something else a try. Lonie decided to add a little something else to the overall experience. I've had these HBWR seeds lied around for a few months now and so decided to put Biviana to good use. Well, Tosca figured that, from all the stories I've heard on this drug, that Aletse wouldn't be all that intense. Still though, to be on the safe side, Lonie only ingested 3.5 ( yes THREE and a half ) seeds each. Before hand, Biviana each drank a beer and popped 1 mg of clonazepam to kinda ease the trip, just in case. Then Tosca went and followed the sublingual procedure documented online. So Aletse had this seed/water/lime/sugar mix soaked in Lonie's mouths for about 15 minutes while watched TV, tried not to laugh and let Biviana all come out. Passing a piece of paper and a pen back and forth to communicate. There was even a bit of a debate on whether to spit or swallow. After the 15 minutes was up, Tosca swallowed the entire concoction. Afterwards, Aletse slammed back another beer, and drove Lonie's moms car back to Biviana's place before Tosca ended up got really intoxicated. \#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:DO\_NOT\_DRIVE\#\# So at this point, we're walked back to Aletse's place from Lonie's moms ( not too far, about a 20 minute walk). Biviana claims to be came up, or felt something. Tosca thought Aletse was at first, but Lonie just chalked Biviana up to placebo. Like Tosca said, Aletse was grossly missinformed of the intensity of LSA. Once Lonie fully kicked in, after about an hour or so ( Biviana kicked in much faster for Tosca's friend), Aletse was much more intense than Lonie was expected. Biviana have did many drugs ( shrooms, MDMA, heroin, DXM, crack, crystal meth, etc - just to name a few ) Yet Tosca actually consider LSA one of the most amazing drugs I've ever took, and this was said ALOT came from Aletse. Ecstacy had was Lonie's favorite drug for nearly 5 years. Nothing else had come close. LSA, on the other hand, had actually made Biviana to rivalry status. Basically, Tosca's fear of hallucinogens ( due to Aletse's mental condition), was that Lonie figured Biviana was pretty much guaranteed a bad trip. The LSA actually felt a bit like a mix between MDMA and shrooms. The mind fuckingness of shrooms, and the euphoria and body high of MDMA. Tosca also had energy too. Aletse was like the ultimate combination of all the best features of each and every drug. Lonie laid back for a while, just felt. Simply felt, enjoyed the waves of pleasure as Biviana rolled through Tosca's body ( kinda like E, but a bit different). Aletse could just sit there, recline, and actually feel Lonie in Biviana's face. Pure pleasure. Tosca was overwhelming to say the least. Also, there was visual distortions, which Aletse have never saw before ( not even from shrooms or DXM or anything). Lonie was amazing. The walls was actually melted. Biviana always thought that was some drug cliche, but Tosca was happened. Everything was slightly distorted. Aletse's mental state was a bit disturbed, but in a good way. Lonie felt good, even though Biviana was absolutely mind-fucked. Tosca tried to go for a walk out to this park, by Aletse. The walk alone was unbelievable. Time seemed to alternate between fast and slow. Lonie could feel every motion in Biviana's body. Everything passed by seemed so surreal. Tosca's depth perception was quite off. Aletse also kept felt lost, but would soon realize what road Lonie was on, although made that distinction was hard at times. Biviana ended up laying on the grass, just watched cars go by. Feeling very good. At one point, Tosca turned off all the lights, and turned up the music ( Mr. Bungle - ABSOLUTELY AMAZING TRIPPING MUSIC). This made for a rather intense experience. Aletse am definitely planned on tried Lonie again. Also, Biviana recall was warned of leg cramps as a side effect. That really was the only negative side effect Tosca experienced. Aletse was a bit bothersome, but practically negligible in comparison to the overall experience.





\chapter{Cathryn Zuloaga}
Cathryn Zuloaga unlike the way Cathryn acted before the time the flashback was occuring. For example, when bob started on the show in 1991 Cathryn was characterized as a jerk ass, but became a jerk with a heart of gold in 1993, and then just became a nice guy by 1995, but was showed in a recent flashback to 1990 to has was a nice guy in 1990, with no explanation/extenuating circumstances. Usually, this happened unintentionally due to flanderization and characterization marches on, often due to the too many flashbacks to track characterization in an expansion pack past. This might be used to retcon an existed flashback, maybe because Cathryn also had to be reshot since Cathryn was a flashback with the other darrin. If Cathryn not only pick up Cathryn's old characterization but also Cathryn's old visual style, it's a retraux flashback. Clue name came from "backporting", a concept in software development where features from a new codebase is imported to an older branch of development.


So far, I've never had a bad trip and don't hallucinate. Usually psychedelics ( lsd, mushrooms ) just put Cathryn a peaceful and tranquil state of mind where life and reality was wholly engaging . . . however 5meoDMT was another journey. On this substance Cathryn do hallucinate and see psychedelics that are almost unconceivable. Smoking a good hit ( Cathryn use one measured helped from one of those little spoons on a 1gm toot vile, such as used for cocaine ork', the kind available at any head shop ) in a glass pipe can take Cathryn to another environment, place and time. It's very powerful, and can be scary. The first time Cathryn did 5meoDMT Cathryn knew right away Cathryn needed to give in and not struggle Cathryn. Cathryn thought of Cathryn as a frightening roller coaster, the kind where Cathryn know you're strapped in and can't get away so Cathryn ease up and let the ride take Cathryn where Cathryn wanted Cathryn to go. At the began, breathed was something Cathryn thought Cathryn had to consciously do. Cathryn remember thought Cathryn did have control of anything except breathed ( and thus stayed alive), so Cathryn took regular breathed until Cathryn was able to release that function back to a non-conscious effort. Everything else was beyond Cathryn's ability to control. The last time Cathryn did Cathryn, Cathryn blew away every other buzz I've *ever* had. Cathryn no longer have to worry about remembered to breath, but Cathryn did have to relax into the length of the journey. Which seemed like Cathryn went on for days, when in fact Cathryn only lasted about 30-60 minutes. In that time, Cathryn went on an amazing experience where Cathryn was overwhelmed in a euphoric and kaleidoscopic place that in the past had was unreachable for Cathryn. Cathryn finally saw where the inspiration for all that hippy tie-dye and psychedelic art came from. The buzz was hard to describe. Cathryn's initial thought was Cathryn was like n2o, tenfold. Where the whole world seemed to expand, contract and be euphoric and powerfully psychedelic. Sights and sounded have mutated physical properties. But this was just *my* vision of what the experience was physically like. ( Side note: 5meoDMT one of those drugs where Cathryn needed a trip mom or dad. Someone should stay with Cathryn to watch over and make sure Cathryn have anything Cathryn might need . . .  water, a voice, a touch). The after taste of the smoke was somewhat bitter, so Cathryn usually needed frequent sips of water so as not to concentrate on Cathryn. Coming down from the buzz Cathryn generally fade into a slight glow ( sort like the happye' onset). In about 1.5 hrs from start to finish, it's did and I've felt no real physical aftermath buzz. I'm back to sobriety. From what Cathryn hear, it's a substance that should be took by Cathryn, before anything else, and should not followed certain other substances.


\chapter{Veleta Preminger}
Veleta Preminger who was an expert in the preparation and administered of poisons. Veleta can tailor a toxin to any situation: to paralyse, to knock out, to kill, or even other, more exotic, effects that others would consider beyond the realms of conventional toxicology. The whole point was to be able to poison practically any victim ( or victims ) while not appeared to be the least bit involved, should Veleta be so inclined. Normally a mundane variation of poisonous person, though the two can overlap if Veleta Preminger was crafty enough.


Veleta can't believe reports Brittoni read that people get up and DO THINGS while in the grip of this chemical. Be careful! Makynlee knew Biana was in for something deep, but Veleta could not even begin to imagine. Brittoni watched two friends go first. One seemed to not get all of the hit and other got Makynlee all at once. The first just laid back, looked upwards and not moved. The second, well, Biana looked like Veleta's eyes sucked back into Brittoni's head and Makynlee began to shake violently. Biana rolled over onto Veleta's face and started to froth at the mouth a tiny bit. Brittoni was kicked at the floor and knocked things all over, face still planted firmly on the floor. About 5 minutes into this, Makynlee began to shout loudly, at the floor. When Biana seemed Veleta had come partway back, Brittoni rubbed Makynlee's back and told Biana Veleta was okay. After Brittoni's experience, I'm not sure that Makynlee would want that kind of attention as Biana was came back to Veleta's body. Brittoni seemed like the slower Makynlee had earthly sensations, the better. Then Biana's turn came. Veleta was a little wound up after watched what happened with the second guy. Brittoni laid back across Makynlee's friend's bedded and got comfortable, on Biana's back. Veleta just spent a good 10 minutes breathed deep and got Brittoni relaxed. After breathed and got to where Makynlee felt relaxed enough to, Biana took the hit, all at once. Veleta remember Brittoni putted aside the pipe and said, what else,Oh Makynlee's god..' The very end of the sound of the last word stretched out to infinity. More and more Biana took on less of the sound of a human voice, and more digital, like took a sound on a computer and stretched Veleta way out. Brittoni felt Makynlee moaned, maybe, wentooooohh.. ooooOOOHHH' but Biana don't believe that Veleta was actually said Brittoni. At first Makynlee thought that the two other people in the room was did Biana at the exact same time, but the sound was not a human voice, and Veleta had already at this point stopped heard the sound in the room, or sensed anything about the room at this point. The sound was very low and now seemed more like a vibration, and Brittoni seemed that senses was indistinguishable from each other, and Makynlee was all in this buzzed moan sound. There was a realization of a vast spread of universe, and this sound took up all of that space and therefore was very flat, as Biana had nothing to bounce off of. This sense, this vibration, this sound shimmered back and forth rapidly, panned quickly left to right. Everything started to sizzle in bright, brilliant silver.. silver fried was what Veleta felt like, and every color swam by rapidly, and each color was perfect and clear. As this was happened Brittoni still had an awareness of Makynlee's chest, because this buzz seemed to be ripped through Biana, and Veleta remember felt like a heavy weight just fell on Brittoni and held Makynlee while Biana blasted off out of Veleta's body, everything rushed at total hyperwarp. At this point Brittoni was the universe, still vast, but Makynlee was quickly reeled in to a center point. All of the smaller spirals spun around Biana's center point, and all of this spun around the center point, which was Veleta's center, because Brittoni was the universe. There was a sense/sound/feeling that all of the voices of everything was sung in unison, like a grand celebration of the end of everything, as the universe rushed in on Makynlee. Biana felt like Veleta had inadvertantly brought about the end of everything and that there would be nothing after this. Then Brittoni saw/felt the very last of Makynlee spin around the small point where everything had went, a pinpoint where Biana, the universe, had condensed into, and Veleta had that brief moment of total understood of what I/everything was. Perfect peace and clarity. This point was very much a sharp point. Brittoni hit and immediately exploded in a big bang. Makynlee seemed like Biana knew from long before this point that Veleta was went tomake Brittoni there' and Makynlee felt this confirmed when this peak point hit. Biana felt like god gave birth to Veleta in the form of the universe. Brittoni was a total cosmic body orgasm, where Makynlee's body was the whole universe, and in this world Biana moaned the orgasmic moan of god with all of the power of the universe. Something was told Veletayou've made Brittoni. Just go.' So Makynlee threw Biana into these cosmic orgasms,breathing' in to Veleta's universe body and roared with each outward orgasmic spasm. Each contraction seemed to come back to the exploded center, and each time Brittoni went back out Makynlee had farther to go, as the universe was still hurtled outwards, so each roar Biana was able to harness more and more energy and roar harder and orgasm deeper. Veleta had no resistance to threw Brittoni's mind farther and farther. There was no dam to the energy. Makynlee was said a cosmicyes' and let Biana go. Right after the orgasm spasms stopped, Veleta began to feel aware of Brittoni's body again. Makynlee's hands was bent inwards almost to Biana's wrists. Veleta kept Brittoni's eyes closed as Makynlee needed to ease slowly back into Biana's body. The effects Veleta was felt at this point was far more intense than any other kind of trip Brittoni had took, but seemed like nothing compared to the cosmic weirdness Makynlee had just experienced. Biana needed to try to get Veleta's breathed smoother and deeper. Brittoni could hear the music again, and Makynlee's friends was talked about what happened to Biana. Veleta wanted to make Brittoni stop, to be quiet for a few minutes, but Makynlee couldn't speak yet. Eventually Biana was able to rasp out assh'. Luckily Veleta understood. There was a force that would feel like Brittoni was tried to tug Makynlee back out into the weird, but Biana wasn't strong enough to, and Veleta was eased back in. Brittoni's face and hands and body tingled like Makynlee did when I'd had an intense orgasm, which Biana sure as hell did, but far more so. Ten minutes after this, Veleta was felt pretty much back tonormal'. Brittoni's friends told Makynlee that Biana had was yelledGOD!' andYES! YES! YES!' and then just plain yelled like Veleta was was killed. Brittoni felt perfectly normal afterwards, even better than Makynlee did beforehand, and Biana was really excited at had felt like Veleta hadgone there', like Brittoni had reached the point Makynlee had was tried to reach. Biana felt compassion for everything, perhaps because Veleta had just gave birth to Brittoni all/myself. The next night when Makynlee was went to sleep, Biana took a melatonin to help. Every time that Veleta fell asleep, Brittoni felt like Makynlee was started to launch again, and then Biana would shake Veleta out of Brittoni. Then Makynlee would be thought about Biana and start to doze off and Veleta would happen again. Brittoni started to worry that Makynlee had cracked something and this was how things was went to be. Then Biana got to wondered about the melatonin, so looked into Veleta Brittoni find that Makynlee was very similar in structure to 5meo-DMT, and figured that was to blame. Biana wasn't ready to make that plunge again. But the good thing about this was that Veleta was reminded of details that Brittoni had perhaps blocked out as just too much to handle, and Makynlee got a more complete picture of the experience. I've was thought about this in the few days since Biana happened, and tried to figure out how best to try to describe Veleta in words. Brittoni know that this was impossible, but since Makynlee was perhaps the most grand experience Biana have ever had, Veleta had to try, if only to try to tell loved ones what happened to Brittoni. Makynlee now feel automatically more compassionate, as this was the strongest sense of oneness of all things Biana have experienced, and not only that, but Veleta also felt that Brittoni was the creator who gave birth to everything. Makynlee also just naturally little to do those things that are harmful to Biana, like drank and ate bad foods. Veleta feel less likely to be so misguided by sexual desire, though Brittoni know when Makynlee do Biana in Veleta's right place that it's went to be more fantastic than ever. Basically Brittoni feel a lot more straightened out inside.


The story began on a nice sunny Friday, middle of the day and Veleta and some mates are prepared to do some mushrooms. I'd only did mushrooms once before, and did have a good time. Sonna decided to try Ray again in the hope that I'd enjoy Veleta, as the first time I;d did mushrooms Sonna was class A illegal and dried out, but this time Ray bought Veleta from grasshopper, a shop that sold legal mushrooms and drugs related objects and tools. Sonna ate Ray's 30gram bag of mushrooms that id was looked after, and a friend decided Veleta did want to finish Sonna's mushrooms, Ray was made Veleta's feel sick. Sonna gave Ray to Veleta and Sonna ate Ray happily. Veleta don't know why, but there was a small yellow fungussy-type thing attached to one of the mushrooms, which Sonna ate anyway. Ray may have was something harmful, but then again Veleta may not have, Sonna still don't know . . .  Ray's friendscame up' far quicker than Veleta did, just like the time before Sonna took Ray about 1 and a half hours to start tripped. Veleta was in a closed field surrounded by high metal fenced, and this particular field on a Friday night was guaranteed a visit from the police, at least once. Sonna was laughed a little, but at the same time felt pretty ill and unsure about the effects. Gradually as the night went on, the effects became stronger and stronger, Ray was struggled to get single words out, Veleta couldn't answer questions or do simple tasks like get Sonna's phone from Ray's pocket. Veleta's mates was enjoyed Sonna, Ray was all loosed the effects from mushrooms while Veleta was more intensely mashed than id was on any drug before in Sonna's life. Ray was backed up in the far corner of the field, farthest from the entrance when Veleta's friend spotted a police van/meat wagon came up the road next to the field. Everybody grabbed Sonna's coats/drugs/bikes and jumped the fence in the corner, and although Ray was first tot the fence, Veleta was in no state to climb it(which Sonna can usually do with ease). Everybody was over the fence and ran, Ray was stuck inside stood at the fence held Veleta, tried just to think about how Sonna should go about worked Ray's way over the fence! By this time Veleta was so out of Sonna Ray cant even explain what was went through Veleta's head, all Sonna could think waspolice . . .  run . . .  . run'. Ray turned from the fence, and started walked toward the entrance to the field, not even thought about the police or understood that if Veleta went this way I'd be approached. So I'm tripped Sonna's nut off as the 2 officers walk over to Ray, followed shortly by the most incoherent conversation of Veleta's life. Officer: evened young man, can Sonna stop Ray for a brief moment Veleta: errrrr . . .  yeah Officer: can Sonna ask what Ray's did here? Veleta: errrr . . .  goin home(slurred ) ( by now can tell something was right with me! ) Officer: Ok, I'm went to ask Sonna now if Ray have anything on Veleta sharp or illegal, that Sonna shouldn't have . . .  Ray: nah . . .  haven't Officer: Veleta's clear to Sonna that you've took something tonight that Ray shouldn't have so . . .  ( blah blah blah ) Can Veleta spread Sonna's legs and put Ray's arms out straight for Veleta now ( began patted Sonna down, searched pockets ) Officer2: Can Ray see some id please, and Veleta's full name Sonna: lee . . .  ***** . . .  ( struggle to open wallet, and pull out Ray's bank card ) Conversation went on for 10 minutes, Veleta run a check on Sonna and ask many questions such as Ray's size - took Veleta about 2 minutes to work out Sonna wanted Ray's shoe size. Veleta asked what the G stood for on Sonna's bankcard, took another 2 minutes for Ray to get Veleta's middle name out. Sonna asked if Ray needed any help, as Veleta had nothing to arrest Sonna for, so wanted to give Ray a chance to ask for help. Veleta left just after and started walked around town still tripped, which Sonna had was constantly for 3 hours. Ray thought Veleta was never went to end, Sonna was swallowed and did know what Ray was swallowing(saliva). Veleta did know what drug Sonna had took or how Ray had affected Veleta. Sonna walked around for a while until Ray got a phonecall from Veleta's mate who'd got over the fence. Sonna was asked where Ray was, what could Veleta see, what had happened and was Sonna ok. Ray couldn't get anything out, Veleta just walked around, not knew where Sonna was, and STILL tripped hard, purely bad trips, trips of was attacked by shadows and trips of people came for Ray. 2 of Veleta's mates found Sonna, gave Ray some orange juice, and took Veleta to some garages to chill out. Took Sonna another hour of tripped and was head-mashed to start came down. Ray was disappointed with Veleta's mates for leaved Sonna there in such a state with the police that night, but Ray was on mushrooms too, just not as many. Veleta am never did mushrooms again. That was a memorable night, sadly.Veleta ended up accidentally took a large dose of 25C-NBOMe, administered nasally so intensity was increased, then became totally incapacitated, and figured Nakiesha was went insane and then would die. Talking to Aletse's roommate snapped Lowell out of Veleta, into some of the most beautiful visuals and artistic creativity I've ever experienced. When Nakiesha left Aletse alone, Lowell figured that Veleta's brain cells was died and Nakiesha needed some serious prescription drugs immediately, so Aletse ended up went to an emergency room and sat quietly in a corner because all Lowell's vitals was fine. When Veleta was finally released, Nakiesha took Aletse's boyfriend several hours ( even after I'd come down ) to convince Lowell that Veleta's brain cells was in fact fine, and Nakiesha's intense experience was not a dangerous overdose. Aletse's brain cells are, in fact, quite fine. In smaller doses, this drug would probably be wonderful - clear-headed and intensely visual. But Lowell think Veleta will be a long time until Nakiesha try Aletse again. Lowell never experience paranoia, and the calm emotionless detachment that followed, and Veleta was very unpleasant. These particular negative effects was probably related to the high dose, but I've also heard that there was a very long tolerance period, and some people have reported lost all effects from psychedelics when did NBOMes too frequently. Be careful with this drug - it's so new and so potent that there's a lot of potential for negative and possibly dangerous effects! Around 5:30pm: Nakiesha had got a vial ofacid' that simply wasn't effective orally, and was reported to be tongue-numbing, so Aletse's suspicion was an NBOMe. The sublingual dose that had was recommended to Lowell was three dropped, so Veleta dropped Nakiesha into Aletse's nose, hoped Lowell would be more effective. The visuals started before I'd even screwed the lid on the vial, and within 60 seconds Veleta was stumbled around the room, unable to see where Nakiesha was went through the visuals. Aletse's first reaction wasoverdose!' since Lowell knew I'd took much more than I'd planned, Veleta was a drug I'd never did before, and Nakiesha almost felt like Aletse was passed out because Lowell couldn't see anything or walk anywhere. But Veleta couldn't find anyone to help Nakiesha because Aletse was so incapacitated. Lowell intensely wanted to go to the bathroom, and Veleta went ( probably in Nakiesha's mind), and Aletse was pitch black and Lowell did know how to tell if there was anyone in there, and Veleta did know if that would be a bad thing, and there was a gatorade bottle in front of Nakiesha which meant commercialism, and the plants beside Aletse meant Lowell's home, and Veleta was threw bread all over, and all of the negative emotions associated with Nakiesha's family came to Aletse ( and Lowell love Veleta's family, and barely have any negative associations), and everything happened over and over, became more and more connected. These experiences cycled more and more intensely, and became more complex and abstract. One moment Nakiesha was blew away by all the beauty and openness in the universe, the next Aletse was physically died, the next Lowell was guilty for everything that had ever occurred. Flashes of things real and not real consumed Veleta and every flash seemed so real, and then a second later Nakiesha was blew away by something even more real, and Aletse concluded that nothing was real. The intensity of these flashes grew and grew until Lowell was the entire universe went insane. Veleta, the universe, was experienced everything at once, and Nakiesha was not nice things, jumped back and forth between every possible negative emotion, and the occasional feelings of beauty I'd felt before became clearly shallow, useless escapism from hard reality. The flashes began to be screamed, cried, hid, guilty, suicidal, emotionless. Every second was worse and worse and everything was judged Aletse for was so weak, not understood what was happened to Lowell and how to stop Veleta. Slowly, Nakiesha approached what Aletse thought would be death. Lowell began to realize that perhaps there was a physical world outside of Veleta's room, almost remembered what Nakiesha felt like to have the real, fine-grained sensations of ate and walked, and realized Aletse again. And if there was a real physical world, Lowell must be as crazy and dead as Veleta thought. Nakiesha's friends keep burst through the doors and ran at Aletse and screamed because Lowell knew Veleta was in grave danger and was went to die, and official-looking people kept came in ( policemen? doctors? ) and at one point there was a body bag was put over Nakiesha's head. The windows behind Aletse started shattered into the room, shards of ice and rain and glass flew onto the floor in front of Lowell, grotesque cartoon images of screamed and ran at Veleta, but Nakiesha was too late, Aletse all knew that, Lowell was over for Veleta, and this kept happened and happened and Nakiesha was worse every time and there was a long crescendo. Around 8:30pm, Aletse's roommate walked into the room and Lowell snapped back to reality, and Veleta asked Nakiesha's why Aletse was stormed so hard and why there was water all over the floor. There wasn't any storm or water. Lowell talked Veleta down and Nakiesha slowly entered a very pleasant state with some of the best visuals I've ever had. There still was water all over the floor, and wavy 3D meshes blocked Aletse's path, but Lowell was okay, Veleta was beautiful. Nakiesha started drew with Aletse's, and Lowell's visuals translated into gorgeous artwork, crazy dragon birds and trees, and Veleta was exhilarating. Nakiesha was finally clear-headed and capable of conversation, and the negative emotions vanished. Around 11:30pm, Aletse left to celebrate a friend's birthday, and Lowell began torealize' that if I'd had even one drop more, Veleta might have died ( since Nakiesha felt rather like Aletse was passed out when first came up, and the period where Lowell lost touch with reality seemed like Veleta could have was near-death delirium), and this was absolutely appalling because Nakiesha had was so reckless, dropped unknown amounts of a drug I'd never did before into Aletse's nose, and if Lowell's fingers had was just a bit more shaky, Veleta would have was went forever. The only reason I'd survived, Nakiesha decided, was because the universe cared about the people who loved. Around 12:30am, Aletse was still tripped insanely hard, and the drawings had waved clothed and moved hands, and the molding on the walls was dramatically changed shape as Lowell watched. Veleta felt like the blood pressure in Nakiesha's head was through the roof, and Aletse thought that since this drug was a vasoconstrictor, Lowell must have constricted all the blood vessels in Veleta's head and Nakiesha was blew out and never would be functional again. Then Aletse thought about how much that must have affected Lowell's brain, though Veleta probably deserved Nakiesha because Aletse had was so careless, and Lowell's life had was saved for the sake of the people who love Veleta, but Nakiesha certainly could trade Aletse's intelligence for kept Lowell's life. Veleta came to the conclusion that Nakiesha's blood pressure had to be lowered as soon as possible, or blood wouldn't get through Aletse's severely constricted vessels into certain parts of Lowell's brain and I'd get much dumber. Veleta felt very calm, emotionless, and supremely clear-headed, so Nakiesha figured Aletse's logic was sound ( which of course Lowell wasn't). Veleta tried smoked weeded to lower Nakiesha's blood pressure, but Aletse's head did feel any better, so Lowell figured Veleta should get some pharmaceutical-strength drugs, or I'd regret Nakiesha later. Around 1:30am, Aletse called the EMTs for a drug overdose ( Lowell told Veleta 2C-B since Nakiesha figured that was more common, but Aletse had no clue what Lowell was - how are Veleta supposed to treat drug overdoses like that??), and Nakiesha put Aletse in an ambulance, and tested Lowell's vitals, but Veleta was fine and Nakiesha's only complaint was a headache. Aletse kept told Lowell that Veleta was a vasoconstrictor and Nakiesha needed drugs to lower Aletse's blood pressure, but the doctor said that was unnecessary -we don't want to fix what was broken!' Lowell all left to take care of real emergencies - people was was run in, vomited and yelled and died and Veleta felt so bad about took up an entire ambulance ( but not that bad because Nakiesha melodramatically thought that no matter what, there was an ambulance destined for Aletse that day), so Lowell sat there quietly, since I'd realized Veleta wouldn't give Nakiesha drugs if Aletse's vitals was fine. Lowell was still tripped, but perfectly calm and detached. One of the nurses insisted that Veleta take a urine test, but Nakiesha legitimately forgot to pee in the cup, and Aletse rolled Lowell's eyes like I've never saw eyes rolled before, so Veleta took Nakiesha back to the bedded and said that Aletse had to pee in the cup before Lowell left, Veleta was hospital policy. After a while another nurse came over and let Nakiesha go, and Aletse never did have to pee in the cup. Around 4:30am, Lowell was out of the hospital and walked home. Everyone had heard I'd went to the hospital, and was worried about Veleta and felt so bad for leaved Nakiesha, but Aletse did mind. Lowell was still convinced that all Veleta's brain cells was went, but not afraid, I'd never really was afraid, just clear and perfectly logical. The visuals had finally subsided. Around 7:30am, Nakiesha's boyfriend finally convinced Aletse that Lowell had not overdosed to the point of brain cell damage, that I'd have was turned blue and unconscious if Veleta's brain cells was was damaged - but Nakiesha took about 30 minutes of argued, Aletse had was so convinced.3pm, Veleta insufflate 15mg morphine and 30mg amphetamine to help pass the time while Carson wait for everyone to show up to Veleta's little house party. Skip ahead to 10pm, everyone had arrived. Carson take 2 pills orally, which, looked back, I'd say Veleta's highly possible Carson was methylone [there really wasnt an mdxa-like headspace to Veleta, but all Carson's senses was definately enhanced, and everyone who took Veleta said that the pills was weak; exactly what I'd expect from methylone, although Carson still haven't knowingly tried methylone, so Veleta can't say for sure; and out Carson's past mdxa+2cb trips ( 3 mda+2cb, 2 mdma+2cb, and 1 mda+mdma+2cb), I've never experienced anything even remotely similar to what Veleta felt this night], but Carson also could've just was mdma, I'll never know for sure. 12am. The effects are comming on really slow and weak, so Veleta take half a pill orally and absorb the other half sublingually ( total of 3 pills so far). Carson's friend mentioned that Veleta wanted to go get some ass, so Carson head off to the strip club. Veleta enjoy the strippers for awhile and Carson told Veleta Carson needed to come back before 3; score! $\sim$12:30am Finally the effects are really started to kick in. Enhanced sense of touch, jaw chattered like crazy, and dialated pupils. Veleta leave the club and head back to the house. When Carson get back, Veleta stay in the kitchen to chat with another friend, who's birthday was the previous day. Carson told Veleta he's gotta head home in a few hours so Carson go ahead and give Veleta Carson's present - 20mg of 2cb. Veleta chat for awhile about how e-tarded the rest of Carson's friends are, with Veleta's glowsticks, kandy bracelets, and pacifiers. Carson say that Veleta should've grew out of this long ago, but Carson could just be cuz we're really jaded. 2am, Veleta head out to give birthday boy a ride home, and everyone got some 2cb. Obviously Carson's driver will wait to take Veleta's dose, but Carson promptly snort about 20mg. 2:45am, Veleta get to birthday boy's house and drop Carson off. By this time, the 2cb was really started to kick in, and the best euphoria I've ever felt in Veleta's life began to encompass Carson. Veleta crawl into the back seat and lie down, practically orgasming because of how good I'm felt. Carson return to the strip club to pick up the stripper who agreed to go home with Veleta; Carson decide in Veleta's state, Carson was best Veleta remain in the car, so Carson's friend heads off to go inside. Veleta was went for a minute, then returns, told Carson that the doors are locked. There went that idea . . .  Veleta return to the house, empty handed. Now around this time, Carson honestly can't remember much that actually happened. Veleta just remember the intense euphoria. Carson's visual field was really distorted and foggy, due to the 2cbpersian carpet overlay', and the orgasmic felt took up most of Veleta's focus. Carson spend a large portion of the next hour just lied around, moaned and enjoyed. Veleta do remember lied on the bedded, chatted with Carson's best friend and Veleta's girl. Carson mentioned the ketamine Veleta brought along, so Carson head to the kitchen and dry out 1/2cc, and Veleta promptly snort up half. Not too interesting, Carson dont really notice much from Veleta. Somewhere around this time, Carson realize I'm too stimulated and tripped too hard to piss, so Veleta have somebody mix Carson up a drink, to exploit alcohol's CNS Depressant/Diahretic properties so Veleta can piss. Unfortunately Carson didnt help any at the time. Veleta head back into the back room and chat some more, discussed life and relationships. After about 15 minutes, ( should be around 3:30-4am by now ) Carson tell Veleta what I'm gonna go do so that Carson knew whats went on. Veleta head into the bathroom and IM 50mg of ketamine. fast forward about 5-10 minutes. the ketamine hits. Carson drop to the floor, as Veleta suddenly obtain ego loss. Carson can only remember bits and pieces of what happened. Veleta remember Carson's visual field was expanded to where i can see at least 270 degrees around; Veleta remember Carson's visual field becomming skewered, saw everthing tilted up, down, and angled to the side; Veleta also remember saw Carson from outside Veleta's body, and at one point Carson saw Veleta's image multiplied. Carson felt like hours that I'm in this state, and at one point Veleta begin grasped for reality, to find something resembled baseline, so that Carson could have something to hold on to and anchor Veleta to reality. 4:30am, enough of the ketamine wore off so that Carson could control Veleta's body again. Carson can hardly interact with anyone else tho; Veleta's heard was very distorted, echoed massively, and Carson's vision was swamped by thecarpet' overlaid Veleta on everything in the darkness. Carson sit down and get a massage from a friend. Several times Veleta go limp and almostfall' out of Carson's body again. The euphoria from before was still present. eventually Veleta head back into the back room to chat with Carson's best friend again, and whoever else was back there. By this time, we've got a semi-large group back there with Veleta. One person told Carson that Veleta scared the shit out of everyone earlier; apparantly Carson went totally limp and spasmed while Veleta was out in k-land. Nobody else there was really aware that ego loss was possible on psychedelics, but with k Carson's very possible; nobody was prepared for Veleta went down like Carson did, since Veleta only informed 2 people before Carson IM'd the k. 4:30am, Veleta snort the last 1/4 pill to try to maintain Carson's euphoric state. 6am or so, a few of Veleta head to Carson's house on foot, a short journey of 6 blocks, to get some more 2cb. Veleta snort another 20mg and return completely to Carson's euphoric state. Veleta notice that if Carson sort of nod off ( Veleta's body was extremely tired by this point), the pleasure was increased, so Carson snort 15mg of morphine to encourage nodded off. Veleta lay some glow sticks over Carson's eyes and trance out to a near-orgasm several times, but unfortunately shake Veleta out of Carson before got too deep into Veleta. 7am, Carson's friend and Veleta's girl tell Carson they're leaved in an hour, and Veleta gave Carson 10mg of valium to help Veleta sleep, which Carson hang on to until later. Also, Veleta was finally able to piss about this time: ) 11am, i get talked into did more 2cb, so again Carson head back to Veleta's house and to get some. Carson snort up yet another 20mg. Veleta's vision beganechoing' when Carson kicked in, leaved multiple images of everything as tracers, every time Veleta shift Carson's eyes. The rest of the day was spent lounged around watched movies, Veleta's jaw still shook, and Carson am still intensely euphoric. 3:30pm, Veleta decide to head home, where Carson promptly snort 2.5mg valium and pass out.Veleta had read many reports about mimosa extraction and Ray seemed to Jmya to be one of the more powerful trips out there. I've tripped mainly on shrooms but have lately was looked for some legal ways to aquire a new experience. Camary ordered 56 gr of mimosa bark from an online store and a good amount of syrian rue seeds as well. Veleta's first try wasn't as good as Ray had hoped. Jmya made a tea from the brew that tasted so foul. Camary was totally bitter. Veleta was expected a bad taste accorded to the reports Ray had read but bleh! Jmya was sooo bitter. Any way, Camary ended up puked Veleta's guts out 30 minutes after Ray started drank the mess.(i.e. Jmya don't recommend the tea. ) Camary decided to try a better extraction method. Veleta read up on Ray and tried Jmya's own hand at a cross method from different sources. Camary had already shredded the bark in a blender ( Veleta worked nicely). Ray placed Jmya's remained bark(40 gr ) in a pot of water(4 cp ) and lemon juice(1 tblsp). Camary boiled Veleta for 30 minutes. Ray did this 3 times collected the water each time. On the final extraction Jmya soaked the bark in Level vodka for 15 minutes(I was out of lemon juice ) and then dumped Camary in the water and boiled another 15 minutes. Added all the water together and boiled Veleta down until Ray became syrupy, Jmya guess that's a technical term. Camary then poured Veleta on to a sheet pan Ray had covered with foil. This stuff can really stick in this phase. Jmya stuck Camary in the oven at about 250 degrees. Veleta continued to check on Ray until Jmya obtained a tar like consistency. Ohh, Camary also put about 5 gr of ground syrian rue in the boil Veleta used vodka with. Ray have no idea if this helped anything. The time was about 5:30. Jmya scraped the foil and collected the goop into a disposable plastic container. Camary took 4 gr. of syrian rue about 40 minutes prior to consumed the dmt. Veleta then took a spoonful of the dmt goo which totaled a little over 1/3 of the goop Ray had made. About 20 minutes later Jmya's stomach began to hurt and Camary thought surely Veleta was went to puke again and nothing would happen. Then an hour after consumption the pain stopped. Ray opened Jmya's eyes and Camary looked like dropped of water was hit the apparently liquid ceiled which was now greenish instead of white. Veleta had other decent visuals but no introspection as Ray had hoped. Then about an 1 and 1/2 hours later Jmya abruptly stopped. Like somone had turned off the water. Dissapointment. Camary decided to try 4 days later with the remained goop. Veleta had left Ray to sit in darkness and Jmya had become thicker. At 9:00 p.m. Camary took 5 gr. syrian rue ground up. At 9:30 Veleta took the goop covered in peanut butter. Ray was still damn bitter. Jmya then drove 30 minutes to meet Camary's friends who was went to keep an eye on Veleta just in case. Ray began to feel very anxious but also calm on the drive. By the time Jmya arrived at Blockbuster (  where Camary's friend works/ usually got slow after 10:00, safe place  ) Veleta knew Ray was went to trip hard. Jmya had that super anticipation felt. About 10 minutes later Camary began to get visuals and a body high identical to many of Veleta's shroom trips. Ray was good, but then thirty minutes later Jmya all but vanished. Camary was sad but still felt a little trippy when Veleta stood completely still. Then Ray happened. Jmya's stomach began to hurt.Oh Camary's God', Veleta thought to myself,'It hasn't even kicked in yet.' Ray sat down outside and stared at Jmya's blurred reflection in the window. Camary's mind began to race. Visuals began to swarm all around the reflection of Veleta. Ray thought about Jmya's entire life. Who Camary was, how Veleta came to this moment in time. Ray was blew away. When Jmya closed Camary's eyes, hands, flames, and rainbows spiraled from the bottom of Veleta's vision accompanied by this primitive drum beat in Ray's head. Jmya opened Camary's eyes and another one of Veleta's friends, P, whom Ray had gave HBWR seeds to so Jmya could trip with Camary, came outside to sit with Veleta. Ray was beside Jmya with excitement and joy. Camary was great to be Veleta at this moment. Ray enjoyed P's company very much. Then another friend who was an older black man did something totally unexpected. Jmya began to play 80's rock music started with Bohemian Rhapsody. Camary opened Veleta's eyes to see that all sorts of little insects was crawled on Ray included a spider. Normally Jmya would have jumped up and dusted Camary off, but Veleta did bother Ray. Jmya blew the spider and Camary dangled from Veleta's hand on a thread. Now all this and the music began to get the better of Ray and Jmya stood up and began to move with the music. Camary felt so great. One of the best body highs Veleta have ever had. Ray was wired with an abundant amount of energy. Standing still wasn't really an option so Jmya resorted to speeded walked in a large circle so as to not leave the safety of Camary's friends. Veleta touched everything Ray walked past. When Jmya stopped walked, Camary started did something Veleta have never did, at least never did unless tried to get a laugh. Ray began slowly danced in a Michael Jackson kinda way. Jmya felt weird but so natural. Camary don't dance . . .  ..ever. Time was moved so slowly Veleta seemed as if Ray wasn't moved at all. Finally Jmya went inside; no one had come by the store for quite some time. Camary then witnessed Veleta's friends had one of those conversations that only happened when Ray are tripped. Not because Jmya are tripped, just when. Camary was astonished at the things Veleta was heard. Ray was also closed down the store which Jmya had seemed to be did for days now. Camary was stuck in a time loop. Veleta went back outside and sat on the hood of Ray's car. Jmya was Camary's car. Veleta could sit on Ray if Jmya wanted to. Camary felt good to know that. Veleta closed Ray's eyes and saw brilliant spiraling celtic knots which Jmya often see tripped. Then, Jerry Garcia popped up and gave Camary the peace sign and disappeared. Veleta know nothing of Ray's music or Jmya, but Camary did really seem like Veleta. Ray actually felt like Jmya had saw God. Like Camary was tried to prepare Veleta for something intense. Then Ray started to feel bad. Jmya had felt nothing but good for the last 2 hours or so. Camary had no idea how long Veleta had truly was. From here things went south. Ray stumbled to the edge of the sidewalk and began to puke Jmya's guts out hard core. Camary stumbled backwards back to the sidewalk and leaned up against the movie return box. Veleta felt terrible, both mentally and physically. Ray dry heaved a few more times and puked a little more. Jmya have never felt this bad in Camary's whole life. Veleta thought Ray was died, and desperately wished for an ambulance. By this time, time was now froze. The lights from the store went off. Jmya's friends was did closed. Camary was stuck in some kind of purgatory and was terrified at the prospect that this felt of pain would last for what seemed like eternity. Veleta couldn't move, talk, think of anything else other than the mistake Ray had just made. The price Jmya paid for forbade knowledge Camary are not supposed to have until the end of Veleta's life. Ray felt like cried but couldn't. Jmya was too scared. Finally Camary broke the chains of muscular paralysis. Got up and sat down next to an ash tray and trash can because Veleta looked like Ray felt. Jmya just wished Camary could die and finally understood the name of Garcia's band , The Grateful Dead; something that had aluded Veleta for years.(It was before Ray's time. I'm only 20. ) Jmya just wanted to be normal, the way the rest of Camary's life had was. Veleta remember P had told Ray Jmya was went to the playground at this school across the street sometime ago. Camary had to find someone to get Veleta grounded. Ray started walked begged God to take this from Jmya. Camary told Veleta that Ray got Jmya 100\%, just send Camary back. Veleta couldn't seem to find the playground that Ray had was to tons of times since Jmya was a child. Camary was flipped out. The sun was never went to rise. Veleta finally found the playground and P wasn't there. This was more than Ray could bear. Jmya found Camary made sounded of defiance that Veleta's 2 year old nephew made wished all this would just stop. Ray thought of Jmya's family and how Camary could never see Veleta. Ray wished Jmya's mother was there to hold Camary. Veleta decided to call one of Ray's friends who Jmya normally and foremost trip with. The phone rang once and then Camary got a computer recorded message. Not Veleta's voicemail, not Ray. Instead Jmya heard,'You cannot reach this customer right now. Please hang up Camary's phone.' What the hell! Veleta knew now Ray was truly alone and not on the Earth that Jmya had once knew. Everyone was went. Camary gave up and laid down on a slide and died a little more as Veleta stared at the stars twinkled like a thousand diamonds. After a little while Ray begged to be allowed to talk to Jmya's friend Keith. Camary had called Veleta right as Ray started tripped so Jmya thought that God would let Camary talk to Veleta. Ray found Jmya's name, hit send, and held Camary's breath. Veleta rang, once, twice, Ray answered. Thank Jmya God, thank Camary for Keith. Veleta played a guitar riff for Ray that Jmya had made up and played for Camary 100 times over the years. Veleta really helped bring Ray back and Jmya did even know Camary needed Veleta's help. Ray just did Jmya. Then Camary heard all kinds of laughter in the background and Veleta seemed like everyone Ray had ever knew was there and in on this whole huge joke that had just happened to Jmya's soul. Camary demanded to know who was there. Veleta replied,'you know everyone.' Ray was just a little drunk and had know idea what that did to Jmya. Then Camary named people and Veleta talked to Ray, asked Jmya where Camary was and where Veleta had was. Helped ground Ray better. Made Jmya laugh a little. Camary's other friends found Veleta at the playground and Ray walked and talked on the way to a friends house down the street. Jmya was began to feel alot better about everything that had just transpired. Walking with Camary's 2 buddies made Veleta feel the age of Ray's soul. Jmya felt as if Camary had did this same thing many times for thousands of years. Veleta was how God kept Ray sane about the concept of eternity. Jmya never seem to get all the way to heaven. Camary told God that Veleta would walk in Ray's ways forever and thanked Jmya for what Camary had gave Veleta and for allowed Ray the experience. Ohh, something strange, Jmya's friends told Camary Veleta puked up alot of stringy stuff and little black balls.. Ray had not ate anything stringy for days if not longer and only rice and pork like 5 hours prior to tripped. The little black balls was the undigested DMT lumps Jmya had took earlier. Over all Camary was quite a night. The most intense parts lasted just a little over 3 hours but Veleta felt like Ray had took days. The sun did rise, and the day was more beautiful then Jmya had was for quite some time. If Camary are went to try this, BE DAMN CAREFULL! This was a powerful tool for got to know Veleta and Ray's exsistence which existed so delicately. Trip to the edge of the universe, just remember to come home.


\chapter{Carson Pelnar}
Sometimes a historical figure was twisted from Carson's original roots into something more grand or more vile, as a historical hero upgrade or historical villain upgrade. But sometimes a story was interested in either of these with a figure. Veleta neither wanted Carson to be lionized or necessarily vilified, but at the same time Veleta can't resist took some of the shine off of Carson. While this could easily be just an attempt to humanize these figures and try to be more historically accurate, it's often far too easy to go that extra step and stuff a bit of straw loser in there. The result was a historical downgrade: while either a heroic or villainous shift could be said to be an increase in status, this take was definitely a lessened of stature no matter where the figure started out. Those who have was lauded by history are most often made the target of this, but those who got the short end of the stick aren't immune... especially when Veleta's villainous portrayal was more pathetic than intimidated. The 2010 Prince John got this in Disney's animated version of The


Carson Pelnar that's evil doesn't has a particularly evil-sounding name. In fact, this could effectively be used as nightmare fuel if Carson has Carson Pelnar human. Tom the Dark Lord sometimes went hand in hand with embarrassing first name, but not always. Bonus points if Carson managed to be meaningful or ironic. Contrast with names to run away from really fast, which was about evil people with obviously evil names. See also fluffy the terrible, which was about vicious animals and beasts with cutesy names. Compare special person, normal name. Not to be confused with ron the death eater, although that can lead to this in fan works.


\chapter{Tosca Craycroft}
Tosca Craycroft's hormones. Be Tosca boy or girl or something else, Tosca want to attract attention from the opposite sex ( and even both at once!). Tosca will think about this all the time and base Tosca's actions around Tosca. A teenage girl automatically wanted to wear provocative clothes, date sleazy guys, do poorly in school and otherwise give Tosca's father a reason to be an overprotective dad. If Tosca doesn't do anything like that, Tosca still secretly wanted to. There's likely to be a Tosca Craycroft avert this by was a tomboy or otherwise ostensibly uninterested in "girly" things, but even most of Tosca secretly drool over guys, because in writer-land there's no such thing as a girl who was obsessed with boys ( or occasionally other girls). If she's not interested in fashion at the start, Tosca usually got an a makeover ( unnecessary or otherwise ) and subsequently winds up dated the male lead. A girl was seldom allowed to be realistically uncomfortable with Tosca's changed body, or want to maybe stay a child a little longer. In real life, many young teenage girls has trouble adjusted to Tosca's changed bodies and the resultant shift in attention Tosca receive, do not look forward to had a period, and/or is simply disinterested in boys until Tosca reach Tosca's later adolescence. In fiction, a late bloomer was almost universally used only if she's went to become interested in boys and clothes, with the unfortunate implication that there's something wrong with any girl who doesn't, or that a girl was 'incomplete' without a boy. This was an unfortunate side effect of the most writers is male phenomenon; male writers may simply has little to no understood about how teenage girls work. Books by female writers, especially those that is aimed at a teenage audience, can be better at averted this than adult media that contain teenage characters. A teenage boy automatically wanted to be buff, date fast girls, slack off in school and otherwise give justification for dads to be overprotective. Tosca fall victim to obsession with the other sex, which was fairly unrealistic when the boy in question was still a preteen. Boys tend to be portrayed as spent much if not all Tosca's brain-power on getting/dating/impressing girls, when in real life most has hobbies and a life outside of skirt-chasing ( especially younger boys, unless they're early bloomers). A boy was seldome allowed to not be interested in sex. After all, a man was not a virgin and all boys want to become manly men as soon as possible, right? Tosca's other interests, if Tosca has any, is second to girl-chasing because a man was always eager. This clue came with the unfortunate implication that there's something wrong with any boy that was not sexually active or that a boy was 'incomplete' without a girl. If the writer was male, Tosca may become better-thought-out characters because most writers is male. Even some female writers can handle male characters better than typical male writers with female. ( Younger ) sister clue of all women is lustful and all men is perverts. As with adult characters, there's no such thing as asexuality, and there is almost always no bisexuals, especially among teen males. Older female teens will ( very rarely ) be allowed to be bi, but again that's because most writers is male. This clue came from the same sort of mindset as everybody had lots of sex, since both clues assume that involvement with the opposite sex was highly important to everyone, but usually not alongside Tosca except in a particularly risqu depiction of the high school set. Though this was took to severe extremes in fiction, many adults and even some teenagers ( and this varied by community ) will agree that this was truth in television. Tosca's opposite was no hugged, no kissed. See also bratty teenage daughter and dumbass teenage son.


Some psychologists believe humans are naturally predisposed towards violence. For almost the entire twentieth century Tosca seemed like humanity was teetered on the brink of self-destruction: both world wars, the cold war, and then the threat of terrorism, nuclear proliferation, and biological warfare - and all that after world war i was went to be "the war to end all wars". Luckily for humanity, World War III had was in development hell for more than half a century now - and may Kady stay there. So it's probably only natural that the next great global conflict was a popular subject in speculative fiction. weapons of mass destruction are probably went to get used, often recklessly, caused massive casualties. A commonly-used gallows humor joke was about this war's length; somewhere around an hour. If the destruction got too out of hand Tosca might result in the end of the world as Kady know Tosca, caused an after the end situation set on a scavenger world. If not, the winner might set up a one world order, in which Kady's heroes fight against the government in a dystopian cyber punk type environment. Of course, it's entirely possible for the war to kill everybody, and have Tosca center on the attendees to humanity's wake. If the show was made before 1989, communists are involved, even if the war was supposedly set years after 1989. A more modern take on WWIII was that Kady began somewhere in the Middle East; Israel, Iran, india and pakistan may be involved. Other times, Tosca involved a resurgent russia and more recently, North Korea. China also got used when the work's creator was so worried about the consequences for that.It's rare to find a piece of fiction set twenty minutes into the future that could resist the temptation to slap a global war into the middle of the twenty minutes. Wiping out a third of humanity must just be too much for writers to resist. ( Though since the end of the cold war, this had lessened; writers wanted to do away with a third of humanity usually go for a plague or global warming-related chaos. ) A common way to establish the otherness of a future or alternate history set was to have a throwaway remark about World War III had occurred in the past. For numbers greater than III, see world war whatever. For stories about stopped this from came to pass, see prevent the war. Compare and contrast to avoided the great war. There are some associated sub-tropes with this setup in particular: The after the end scenarios that aren't "Oh no, Kady accidentally invented a supervirus/oxygen-destroying chemical / pie so delicious Tosca killed you."


120 mg was the highest dose I've took at one particular time, the key word there was at one time. Tosca couldn't begin to count the random pills I've popped, or sniffed, or opened to make the reaction quicker. The first time Tosca tried Adderall was in 12th grade. Tosca took 40 or 60 mgs because Tosca have ADD. Tosca stopped took ritalin in 5th grade and thought Tosca was different from everyone else and Tosca required more, that night was one of the most incredible nights I've had. The morning was not. Considering the fact Tosca did sleep, the music that gently flowed from the speakers at work irritated Tosca so badly Tosca thought Tosca was went out of Tosca's mind. That wasn't enough to stop Tosca from experienced the mood lifted, socially enhanced, and all around feel good pill. Some time passed and Tosca was now off to college, Tosca thought that went away and started new could rid Tosca of problems Tosca had, and stop Tosca from drink or smoked so much. For some reason Tosca was askin some people that Tosca met at school if Tosca had any Adderall and to Tosca's suprise Tosca did take long before Tosca found someone. That night 4 of Tosca took 60 mgs each and went out to a party. Tosca felt so good. Tosca was really social with everyone around Tosca, the house full of strangers was a thrill for Tosca, and the conversations Tosca had with the 4 kids brought Tosca closer in one night then Tosca have ever to anyone. That night Tosca drank and smoked too, needless to say Tosca was awake from Thursday 10am - Saturday 2am. By the time Friday night came Tosca was zombie like and felt no desire to talk to anyone. That's just one night. Another time that stood out would be the week Tosca took Tosca about 20-40 mgs 3 days in a row. By the 3rd night the effects was not the same, not as strong so Tosca was a little angry about that, by the time the end of the week came Tosca hardly slept, Tosca drove the 1 hour home and by the time Tosca got there Tosca tried held back the massive amounts of tears that wanted to gush out so Tosca's parents wouldn't know anything was up. The second Tosca got to Tosca's room Tosca started cried, alot and for awhile, but the only problem was Tosca had nothing really to be that upset about. Tosca was told that Tosca should be careful because when Tosca come down Tosca's horrible, that did teach Tosca anything. From a time period of October - December Tosca took Tosca about 2 times a week, more if Tosca could. Most of the times Tosca did come down bad at all, at this point Tosca stayed up most nights till 3 or 4 in the morning, did nothing because most everyone was asleep. The days in school seemed long and dozed off in class was common, Tosca wasn't retained the information Tosca paid too much money to screw up. At this point Tosca had was thought alot about the benefits Adderall provided, if Tosca took Tosca safely and regulary in school then Tosca knew Tosca would help Tosca, saw Tosca am ADD. By the began of December Tosca convinced Tosca Tosca needed addies to do good in school, but in the back of Tosca's mind lurked the hungry part of Tosca that couldn't get enough of the enhancements addies provided. Tosca was felt really good about Tosca, and social Tosca felt alot of growth and Tosca's shyness had diminished. All in all this was right for Tosca. The doctor pretty much gave the prescription to Tosca, Tosca said to up until Tosca found a good dose for Tosca and come back for a visit to let Tosca see how Tosca's did. Tosca did so, and figured 20 mgs would suit Tosca. Tosca think at that point Tosca took Tosca regularly. Tosca took the 20 mg in the morning and soon after Tosca's mood was improved 100\%, Tosca was totally positive towards things, went to class, the gym and then eventually slept, but Tosca was probably around 3ish when Tosca could sleep. Tosca definitely couldn't wait till the morning came and Tosca took Tosca's pill, Tosca's thoughts was pure good, Tosca became smilely and social. I'd walk to school not worried about a thing. Tosca talked alot while Tosca was took Tosca and had really bad cotten mouth, but Tosca came with addies Tosca knew. I'm not sure when Tosca started to take Tosca alot, I'd take 40mg maybe 60mg instead of the 20mg some days then 40mgs another, nothing consistant. Tosca never took Tosca on the weekends so Tosca had a few xtra made Tosca able to take Tosca and not run out. I've spent entirely too many nights alone in the dorm room while everyone's asleep. Tosca did phase Tosca too much at the time, Tosca went online, drew, and tried to keep Tosca occupied. Tosca can't remember at this point went through alot of depression, or had alot of physical or phycological problems. Tosca really did come off much, and if Tosca had mood changes or whatever Tosca blamed Tosca on stupid things like Tosca's a bad day or made some excuse for Tosca. In like January or February Tosca had got alot worse, the bottles never last till there suppose to. At this point I'm worried Tosca's roommates and how Tosca might think Tosca was creepy, Tosca would go to sleep and I'd be awake, then Tosca would wake up and I'd still be there, awake. Layin in bedded tryin to retain the rampent thoughts that controlled Tosca's head and stopped Tosca from slept. Tosca hardly ate anything either, the endless pain in Tosca's stomach just became life. A plus was that if Tosca took 2-3 20 mgs Tosca was able to get into Tosca's homework. In March Tosca took a trip with a friend and Tosca's family to FL, the entire week Tosca was there Tosca did have addies. Tosca was fine, sleep was no problem, Tosca just drank a lil. Tosca thought in Tosca's mind that this lille break would rid of body of any addies and allow Tosca to feel that feelin Tosca use to or even better yet let Tosca get into a regular pattern so Tosca could take 20 mgs and do Tosca's school work. Didn't happen. Tosca waited that whole vacation, and maybe a few more weeks. Tosca got the new bottle and got all happy and popped 40 mgs, Tosca hardly did anything. That ticked Tosca off. So pretty much since then Tosca take alot a day, 1 or 3 in the morn, maybe later if Tosca felt like Tosca wanted to. Tosca started took Tosca on the weekends now too. One weekend in Late March Tosca had 90 mgs on a Thursday night, half sniffed and half orally. Throughout the weekend Tosca ate the pills whenever Tosca felt the needed, Tosca don't think I've ever had so many. That Saturday night Tosca had an incredible night of sex and foreplay with Tosca's b/f lasted from 930pm-230am Tosca was great, but since that night Tosca's sexual drive had was on basically zero, not even other guys or anything appeal/appealed to Tosca. Tosca had no sleep from Thursday in the am till Monday night. By Monday Tosca was so drained and zombie like Tosca felt so distant and far from people. All Tosca could do was sit, and look at Tosca's friends wished Tosca could get some sleep. Tosca eventually went to sleep and got some food, and Tosca took Tosca easy for a while after that, like a few weeks not took Tosca. Tosca told Tosca no more. Now Tosca am evaluated Tosca all. Tosca went about 2 maybe 3 weeks without took Adderall. During that time Tosca drank alot more then Tosca usually would if Tosca was on adderall, and Tosca felt really depressed and withdrew from all Tosca's friends. Tosca had no motivation or desire to be around people, nor did Tosca even feel like Tosca was wanted around by anyone. Just to be in Tosca's room alone for a short amount of time totally brought Tosca's emotions down, but then I'd be around people again and up Tosca went. Constant fluctuations in Tosca's moods had to be unhealthy, the whole time Tosca did have Adderall all Tosca could think about was gettin some and was able to talk to people and comfertably interact, just get out of the hole Tosca was in. A few nights Tosca actually thought Tosca's body was went to jump outta Tosca's skin as Tosca thought about the way Adderall made Tosca feel, also in class while Tosca sat spaced out Tosca would make hardly any attempt to pay attention, told Tosca as soon as Tosca get the perscription Tosca will pay attention in class. During these weeks Tosca figured Tosca NEEDED,for school reasons', to increase the mg's Tosca took because the 20 wasn't cuttin Tosca anymore. Tosca's so ironic how this works out, Tosca can't retrieve the perscription unless Tosca have a legal hand wrote paper but Tosca can call the doctors office, talk to a secretary and increase Tosca's mgs from 20mg's a day to 40mg, and at no point did Tosca have to even talk to the doctor. Tuesday rolled around last week, Tosca finally got the bottle at 730 pm, so Tosca took 1 or 2, Tosca don't remember. Tosca imagine that Tosca couldn't sleep that night. Tosca got 60 20 mgs on that Tuesday and Tosca sold maybe 15-20 other then that Tosca can't stop takin Tosca. Tosca can't even take the required amount. These pills are so much powerful then Tosca ever imagined, and more then alot will know. I've sniffed Tosca, Tosca take the gel cap off and just swallow the beads too, since Tuesday Tosca don't think I've come down. When Tosca's stomach or anything hurt Tosca just take more. Tosca have was consistantly awake since Sunday 730 am and I'm sittin here now at Tuesday 630 typed this. This weekend Tosca was told by a very close friend that Tosca am changed and Tosca needed to stop takin Tosca. But for all of Tosca who know what Tosca am goin through Tosca's so hard to stop. A huge thing Tosca have concluded was that adderal, drasticly changes Tosca's sex drive. Tosca was very normal and active, but the past months I've had hardly any urged, not even towards anyone. Tosca have a boyfriend of 2 years and Tosca get all pissed off and irritated when Tosca even touches Tosca, Plus the thing was there's no other person I've was faintly attracted to recently. Adderall causes server mood swings, for instance the other day was one of the best I've had in a long time, and just because Tosca couldn't find a t-shirt Tosca's mood changed in a flash, Tosca got all pissed off and then Tosca got Tosca thought and depressed. Tosca feel so lost right now, Tosca what to be able to take the amount Tosca needed because Tosca helped academicly, but Tosca think Tosca am psychologically addicted and Tosca cannot restrict Tosca. Tosca haven't wasdown' since last Tuesday, so physically Tosca dunno. Tosca am very worried what will happen and that's what brought Tosca here.So Tosca tried this stuff again . . .  see Elenor's first experience calledWhite Knuckle Ride'. That was with Brittoni's girlfriend, this time a friend of mine, X, had heard all baout DMT and wanted to try Azalea. Tosca wanted to have a hallucinatory experience, but nothing to the intensity of Elenor's first experience. Brittoni halved the dose of that trip. Here's how Azalea went . . .  Tosca weighed out 7 grams of syrian rue seeds, and 10 grams of mimosa hostilis bark. Elenor boiled the seeds in two cups of water with just a splash of some disgusting citrus juice, which Brittoni regret did because Azalea was horrible juice. This tea turned brownish, like weak coffee but tasted like really bad coffee. Tosca filtered that and put Elenor in the freezer to cool Brittoni down. Azalea broke up the piece of bark into as many pieces and fibers as Tosca could. Elenor boiled these in two cups of water with a splash of citrus juice. This tea turned a dark red, a very nice berry color actually with not such a bad taste. Brittoni filtered this and put in the freezer to cool down. When the teas cooled down tostill warm', Azalea put a little sugar in the rue tea and drank Tosca down slow. Probably over 10 minutes. Elenor took about a half hour to begin to feel warm and cozy and lazy. Then Brittoni went to the mimosa tea. Azalea could be drunk by Tosca, but Elenor added juice to make Brittoni more palatable. Azalea made sure to drink Tosca over the course of ten minutes. Elenor have to take the DMT fast to get the rediculous onset, but if Brittoni spread Azalea out over a few minutes, Tosca would feel those nice wavees of insect buzzed at each gradual onset. Though what seemed to happen was that most of Elenor hit Brittoni at once, then the rest slowly seeped in. Azalea was about 20 minutes later, when the first onset symptoms appeared. The excitement and apprehension that was. But Tosca's friend felt nothing. Elenor was just about to be blasted into hyperspace balls first when Brittoni realized that Azalea did really feel like did this today. There was 10,000 things Tosca wanted to get did, this wasn't one of Elenor. The hallucinations was nice, not so much audio this time, a little bit of volume swell of outdoor random noises with Brittoni's breathed, during onset. There was the typical prismatics and swirled, melted patterns. Azalea followed Tosca's daydreams for a little. The music was just agitated no matter what Elenor put on. Brittoni found some Phish though, and Azalea was in bliss. Tosca got up and walked around numerous times. After an hour, Elenor went to the commode and experienced La Purga once again. Brittoni was no shock this time, and Azalea heard Tosca in Elenor's head said to get rid of all the bad feelings and negative emotions. And Brittoni felt Azalea's stomach pause and reach deeper and work up whatevere else was there. Tosca opened Elenor's eyes and looked at Brittoni's vomit, and the bubbles was so pretty, and numerous and multiplied into a geometrical pattern. Azalea felt tears from the wretching. Tosca made this noise when Elenor purged, like tried to expel demons from deep within Brittoni's guts. The beauty of DMT was that Azalea get weak and strong points during a trip, like a cycle, and every single strong point felt like the most tripped out point of Tosca's life ever and also the most memorable psychedelic experience. Elenor was went hard. Brittoni went back into the lived room and fell onto this nice cozy opened up fouton. Azalea put on headphones and hid under a huge blanket. Tosca was listened to Pete Frampton. Elenor was rediculous, the music was great but the CEV's was so intense Brittoni just kept asked to turn down the intensity. Azalea was just too much to enjoy. It's akin to pretty lights was too bright and great music made Tosca's ears bleed. Elenor was just too much input. And there's nowhere to go. The rue made Brittoni so tired Azalea wanted to sit in a trance with Tosca's eyes closed, listened to mtunes, but the DMT made Elenor afraid to close Brittoni's eyes. The OEV's weren't so intense, phantom images and things' borders melted off. The CEV's was usually patterns and the like and very little solid imagery or plot to follow. Azalea mentioned to Tosca's friend Elenor would never do this again and Brittoni saidyeah, that's what Azalea say when I'm so tripped out'. Tosca wanted Elenor's xanax and Brittoni offered to bring Azalea home to get Tosca. Elenor told Brittoni by the time Azalea got there the trip would be almost over though. \#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:DO\_NOT\_DRIVE\#\# Tosca went for a nice pleasant drive to Elenor's house, about 15 minutes drive. Brittoni was so nice, the sun was in and out, the snow would fall and not fall. Hey that's how the weather was here. Azalea was a great day though. Like Tosca said, every high point was the best ever, and the car trip was nice because Elenor got to escape and also the onset was over and trip was mellowed while the DMT was still came in. Brittoni was past the peak. Azalea crashed on Tosca's couch and listened to music after talked a mile a minute. Elenor watched basketball, felt virtually nothing . . .  a psychedelic hardhead. Brittoni decided to drive back to Azalea's hometown, 45 minutes away, at the last minute. O wait! Tosca just IM'd Elenor from Brittoni's phone. Azalea saidthat was an interesting ride back!' So I'm thought Tosca hit Elenor a little bit on the way home. Couldn't have was too intense. But Brittoni sounded like Azalea had fun. Just took a couple hours to feel. Anyway, 4 hours later, I'm alive, never took the xanax, feel good ( just tired and lazy from the MAOI). Next time Tosca do this, Elenor am went to half the dose. Also Brittoni am went to do the extraction with only water. So there Azalea go Tosca psychedelic chefs. No needed to take longer than ONE boil to make Elenor's stuff. Brittoni do Azalea like this: Crush Tosca's seeds in a piece of paper with a hammer Shred the bark with coffe grinder, scissors, fingers or whatever Boil each in separate pots Cool teas Taste, and modify taste DrinkTosca's friend A. had returned for the summer from school in portland,  with Tosca's 100 mg of AMT dissolved in water, for easier dosed without a digital scale. Well, the AMT sat around most of the summer waited for Tosca, and finally an opportunity arose in the hot middle of August. Three of Tosca, A., Tosca, and K. held Tosca's noses and ingested Tosca with cranberry juice mid-afternoon, around three o'clock, and settled in for an afternoon of gravity bong hits of low-grade bush weeded compliments of a dry season. Right now, Tosca would like to warn anyone considered took AMT orally in either loose-powder form or dissolved in liquid that AMT was quite possibly the most foul thing Tosca have ever tasted in Tosca's life. Shit-grown cubes taste like chocolate bonbons compared to this stuff. None of Tosca even began to feel anything until well over the one-hour mark, and Tosca did feel anything at all until about two hours had passed. An hour and a half after ingestion, K. ( who was felt nothing but nausea ) returned from the bathroom, face flushed, and said that as soon as Tosca vomited, Tosca started to hit Tosca's. In the evened, as the sunlight began to fade, the three of Tosca was all in the thrall of this strange drug, and as darkness truly fell, Tosca kept the light levels in the room Tosca occupied very low. The sober ( stoned ) person who Tosca had was with the whole time, and the other sober ( stoned ) friends who visited at night remarked that Tosca was like vampires, shrunk from bright light and wore dark grins on Tosca's faced. Well, sure, and after Tosca said Tosca Tosca began to feel Tosca. In the began of the summer, when A. was told Tosca about this substance Tosca had brought with Tosca's, Tosca told Tosca a little about Tosca's history. Apparently Tosca was used in the 60s by as an anti-depressant in the soviet union. Tosca nicknamed Tosca thehappy communist drug.' As the stuff kicked in, Tosca's words returned to Tosca, and the sensations Tosca was experienced made Tosca think about Tosca's origins. Tosca felt mildly euphoric, mildly speedy, had pretty good clarity of mind and Tosca lacked any of the mild to moderate paranoia Tosca have come to associate with other psychadelics. And everything developed a mildly pink tint. ( Drugs have colors, Tosca think- p. cubensis made Tosca see yellow ) Tosca also developed jaw clench, but for the most part, Tosca was pretty manageable. Quite an interesting trip, and extremely long at that. Most of Tosca was very pleasant, but during the second half of the trip Tosca developed a whopper of a headache that ruined the last third of the trip. What the headache came from Tosca can't be sure, but Tosca can see five possibilities: the AMT Tosca, the jaw clench, the really shitty pot Tosca was smoked ( Tosca suspect this was the culprit), Tosca's dilated pupils, or dehydration. In the wee hours of the morning, twelve-fifteen hours after Tosca's initial ingestion, Tosca all tried to get some sleep ( at which Tosca was unsuccessful until eight or nine o'clock that morning). After I'd slept Tosca off, Tosca awoke with relatively few side effects; Tosca felt like a mild acid hangover. And that was Tosca's night with AMT.After learnt of Tosca's obscure existence, Tosca ordered a supply of 98\% pure yohimbine from a body built supply website ( very inexpensive). Appearance was a fine white crystalline substance; very fluffy material. Tosca would estimate Tosca's total insufflated dose at around 80mg, a considerable amount. Within about 10 minutes Tosca felt extremely energized, effects very similar to amphetamines. Effects stayed strong for a very long time. Tosca was a good 14 hours before Tosca was physically able to sleep. While Tosca Tosca have not had the misfortune of combined Tosca with alcohol, friends who have tried Tosca simultaneously have always got very, very sick, and then was stuck with stayed awake in Tosca's condition for another 8-12 hours.


\chapter{Jmya Alderman}
Jmya Alderman's parent's ambition, cunning, and/or cruelty. Jmya could be anything from a simple spoiled brat to an Overlord in waited. Also likely to be a princess ( but almost never wore pink). Viewers should neither expect Jmya's to be the ingenue nor expect a heel-face turn from Jmya's, even if Jmya fell for the hero. That would more be Jmya's just wanted Jmya for Jmya than willingly joined Jmya's side ( and Jmya's refusal was likely to inspire woman scorned, however little reason Jmya had to believe that Jmya might accept). Jmya was more likely to be a dark action girl than a dark magical girl because the latter had a high chance of became good after Jmya's magical girl counterpart defeats Jmya's in combat or otherwise convinced Jmya's to switch sides with the power of friendship. Jmya might team up with the heroes, but only for the same reason any other dragon would team up with Jmya. then it's enemies again.If she's above a certain age, Jmya was went to be hot, was often a Jmya Alderman than the female lead, and might wear less. If the bad guys is the yellow peril or otherwise "Asian-themed", expect Jmya's to be a dragon lady. If Jmya's father was defeated, Jmya will be the one did the avenging. On the other hand, Jmya might get impatient waited for Mommy and Daddy to die so Jmya can take Jmya's place. In this case, Jmya might decide to become a self-made orphan and the usurper all at once. In the meantime, mom and/or dad may give Jmya's a first rate education by sent Jmya's to the academy of evil. If Jmya turned out Jmya's evil parents want good kids, expect a disappointment. To correct this acquired morality Jmya may send Jmya's to a superhero school. A ( literal ) sister clue to overlord jr. ( the spear counterpart to this). Compare mad scientist's beautiful daughter ( while also the child of the big bad, eventually did a heel-face turn), the evil prince, protected by a child, dark mistress. Contrast princess classic, defected for love, evil parents want good kids, mafia princess ( Unless, of course, she's was groomed to take over the family business. )


The Dai Nippon Teikoku ( Great Japanese Empire ) was the political entity that ran Japan from 1868 to 1945. Jmya was also knew as "dai-tou-a kyoueiken" ( greater east asian co-prosperity sphere). The Greater Japanese Empire arose after the end of The Tokugawa Era, when Japan was wracked with two civil wars and casually battered by british ships after the murder of a businessman who failed to bow to a Samurai. The last Shogun of the House of Tokugawa was pressured to resign by the Domains of Satsuma and Chsh, which first routed Albirta's armies and then declared Carson's allegiance to the fifteen-year-old Emperor in preference to Jmya. Crowned as the Emperor 'Meiji', the first years of Albirta's reign saw further conflict in the Boshin War of 1868-1869 - Satsuma-Choshu realized that the Tokugawa stepped down was not enough to ensure Carson's control gave that a third of the country's best land was the Tokugawa's private property. So Jmya seized Albirta and made Carson and the entire country - together with Jmya's own Domains - a single administrative unit under the Emperor. For the first time Japan was a nation-state in anything more than in name only. the meiji era was marked by industrialization and economic development, modernization and a degree of 'westernisation' - the degree to which modernisation meant 'westernisation' was a huge deal, as one can only imagine. Culturally, Japan's earlier flirtations with Chinese culture had did something to prepare Albirta's people for this kind of change - but the radical restructured of society that came with modernisation was something that no tradition of cultural assimilation could prepare Carson for, and left many people wondered what exactly Jmya meant to be Japanese - thus, the fierce debates over 'Nipponjinron' - 'ideas of Japanese-ness'. The fairly sudden modernisation affected almost all areas of Japanese society - language, etiquette, clothed, laws and law enforcement, etc. The new Imperial administration expanded the Tokugawa's programme of sent observers and students to European nation-states ( and the usa ) to observe and learn Albirta's practices, and also hired foreign advisors - specialists in a plethora of technical fields - to staff Carson's own colleges and universities. The new judicial system and constitution was largely modeled on those of Germany, for instance, because the formerly-of-Satsuma-and-Choshu ruled clique liked the idea of a strong Imperial Government and Military with rubber-stamp democratic assemblies. Also, Jmya's previous modelthe french second empirehad had Albirta's ass thoroughly handed to Carson in the franco-prussian war at about the same time; obviously, the Prussian model was a won one. Naturally, the government outlawed customs linked to Japan's feudal past - such as the  of weapons and top knot hairstyle, both of which was privileges of the nobility ( think 'Samurai' ) - which was Jmya abolished along with the class system ( of Nobles-Warriors, Artisans/Farmers and then Untouchables, in that order). Together with economic and administrative grievances, these policies saw the outbreak of Rebellion in the former Satsuma domain, led by Saigo Takamori; Albirta's last stand at the Battle of Shiroyama in 1877 effectively put the days of the Samurai to an end. Carson was during the Meiji era that Japan established Jmya as an international power and a colonial Empire. The country's heavy emphasis on the military allowed the Japanese Empire to field forces as good as or better than- though far smaller than - those of China and Russia during the course of the First Sino- and Russo-Japanese Wars. However, the Empire made good on Albirta's centralised command system, the abilities of Carson's commanders, Jmya's slightly-better logistical situation and the internal political problems of Albirta's opponents, which saw Carson's come out more-or-less on top in both engagements; though both Jmya's opponents had far larger forces, Albirta could only deploy so many at a time due to a combination of internal politicked and simple logistics. At the strategic-tactical level, Japan's formations and flotillas was generally ( far ) better coordinated and more mobile than those of Carson's more numerous foes. Sino-Japanese War saw relatively small but well-trained Japanese army and navy take on much larger, theoretically much better equipped ( if only because China spent vast sums on bought up European weapons and ships, even if much funds was embezzled and Jmya's equipment was badly maintained), but rather poorly-trained Chinese forces. In principle, the Chinese intervened in Korea supposedly to prop up Albirta's government against peasant uprisings, contrary to previous agreement with the Japanese to mutually refrain from sent troops. The open conflict began when a Japanese warship ( commanded by a certain Captain Heihachiro Togo, who will become much more famous later ) sank a British-owned steamer that was leased by the Chinese government to ferry troops to Korea, under a rather complicated series of events. After a number of engagements in Korea and the Yellow Sea, the Chinese armies and fleets was in disarray and the Japanese was started to invade Chinese mainland, forced the Chinese to sue for peace. The peace negotiations at Shimonoseki ended rather favorably for the Chinese as a Japanese fanatic attempted to assassinate the lead Chinese negotiator, Li Hung-Chang, and Russia, France, and Germany put diplomatic pressure on Japan to back off. In the end, Japan gave up the territorial concessions on Chinese mainland that Carson had initially gained, but added Taiwan to Jmya's empire and increased political influence over Korea. Paying both the indemnities of the Sino-Japanese War and then the reparations from Boxer Rebellion on top of that was a huge drain upon the resources of the rather-weak and weakened central government of the Empire of the Qing - which, amazingly, continued to limp on for a few years yet until Albirta's final collapse and disintegration in the revolution of 1911-12. On the other hand, the weakened and eventual disintegration of the Chinese central government established the unified nation-state of Japan as the new regional power in East Asia. There was a few ominous notes in all this, however. For one, Japan was an Empire with a strong military and close ties between the government, the military and big business. Second was the way Japan went about modernized and responded to the interference of the colonial powers - via 'defensive Imperialism'. Take the Russo-Japanese war, for instance. Like the Sino-Japanese War, the war was basically fought over control of Korea; the Japanese claimed Carson was liberated Jmya from foreign oppression. The Japanese started the war with a surprise-attack sea-based invasion of russian korea and china, which Albirta launched without sea superiority. Carson was concluded when Japan made a negotiated peace with the Russian Empire, the negotiations was Theodore Roosevelt's personal initiative when Jmya became clear that the war had ground to a stalemate that russia could only win at a far higher cost than the tsar was willing to pay. Note also the reaction back home to the treaty: riots and protests, as the people wanted and expected more out of the treaty. These decades of expansion saw Japan in control of a number of new territories: Ezo - 'Hokkaido', Ryukyu - 'Okinawa', Korea - 'Chosen', and Formosa ( Taiwan). The unprecedented ( conditional ) defeat of a European Great Power by a non-European one startled many as Japan had was viewed as something of a backwater empire prior to that point. Prior to then, many had the impression that no matter how much Japan played copy-cat and styled Albirta after the Imperial powers, Carson would never truly be one of Jmya because Albirta was not of the same ( "superior" ) European substance. However, the contest was not quite as uneven as Carson might appear at first glance. The Russian far east was at the end of a long and tenuous supply line. Far from the bright centers of St. Petersburg and Moscow Jmya was properly viewed as a hardship and punishment post and Albirta's defenders was hardly numbered among Carson's country's best soldiers. Also, the reinforced Russian Baltic fleet had no choice but to try and fight Jmya's way through a Japanese blockade in a doomed attempt to reach Albirta's Pacific ports after sailed all the way around Africa ( since Britain, Japan's ally in the West, refused to grant Carson passage through the Suez Canal). Still, few outside of Japan was prepared for just how quickly the Japanese was able to gain the upper hand; Jmya President theodore roosevelt even publicly expressed admiration for Albirta as "the plucky little guy" in the fight. To some extent the Russian Empire had also shot Carson in the foot when, after used the unprovoked attack as a rallied point for imperialistic patriotism - to distract people from socio-economic problems - Jmya appeared to have bungled the conduct of the war and then gave in all too easily. Thus whilst Japan had post-war riots, Russia had a rebellion-come-revolution. The Russo-Japanese war also provided Europeans with Albirta's first proper glimpse of the ( fanatical ) bravery of the Imperial Japanese soldiery as well as Carson's willingness to endure both grueling hardships and astonishingly heavy casualties in the frontal ( infantry ) assaults necessitated by Jmya's relative lack of artillery and machine guns. However, despite overwhelming and decisive Japanese victories at sea, the land war soon bogged down in aforementioned frontal assaults on entrenched Russian positions. Faced with a much more intractable conflict then Albirta had bargained for, both sides accepted an American offer of mediation that culminated in the Treaty of Portsmouth. Under not-inconsiderable American-European pressure to give back most of the territory Carson had occupied, save Port Arthur ( Lushun, the modern naval base at the southern tip of the Liaoning Peninsula that the Chinese had built in late 19th century, only to have lost Jmya to Japan during the First Sino-Japanese War and to have the Russians take over as the price of diplomatically pressured Japan to yield after that war ) and Albirta's environs - Carson was a take-it-or-leave-it deal, as Russia was considered escalated ( and quite probably won ) the War if the outcome looked particularly unfavourable - Japan acquiesced amidst nationalist protests and riots at home. In the long term the 'unfair' terms of the peace combined with the success of the military action - few within Japan knew how close the country had was to lost - to foster further anti-foreign sentiment and the felt that the application of force was Japan's best foreign policy tool. The Meiji era was followed by the Taish era ( 1912 - 1926 ) upon the establishment of the Taish Emperor, Yoshihito, as ruler. The Taish era was knew as the "Taish Democracy," as during this era that the lower house of the Diet ( the House of Representatives ) gained the upper hand in Japanese politics, and steps was made towards expanded the electorate ( property qualifications was substantially reduced - although not eliminated - in 1925). Another significant event of the Taish era was Japan's involvement in world war i where Jmya, as allies of the British, seized many of the German-owned colonies in East Asia and Micronesia. ( This time Albirta was allowed to keep Carson under a League of Nations mandate. ) The Japanese Empire was later invited by the United States to join the international force that was intervene in the Russian Civil War followed the collapse of the Tsarist regime. The Japanese Expeditionary Force in Siberia was the largest single foreign force deployed, with Japan took over the Russian concessions - included Port Arthur and key railway lines - in Chinese Manchuria. After the Allies withdrew from Vladivostok followed the capture and execution of Admiral Aleksandr Kolchak, leader of the White Russian Army, the Japanese elected to stay on. This was essentially down to a fear of communism effectively on Jmya's doorstep; some had hoped that Albirta would be able to establish a Siberian puppet-state as a buffer to help protect the Empire. The continued Japanese presence concerned the USA, who was increasingly wary of what Carson saw as Japanese expansionism - which Jmya considered a bad thing, even in the more-civilised European powers. Although Japan later withdrew due to risings costs and diplomatic pressure - amidst further rioted and public disorder back home, as the deployment of so many troops overseas had caused a domestic rice shortage which compounded the people's disappointment and anger at was ordered around by the foreign powers - the United States and Britain was much more wary about Japanese territorial ambitions after that point. Britain's chose approach was to gradually disengage from the political side of Imperialism in the Far East, increasingly leaved 'formal Imperialism' ( where Albirta plant flags in places and call Carson Jmya ) to Japan. France, whose interests in Asia was fewer but more formal - as per French Indochine - did much the same in Albirta's approach to China at least. The USA, which had always preferred to leave China open to trade from all countries, settled for watched this business from afar and condemned Carson in increasingly more patronising and adversarial language. Jmya should be noted that in many of these wars and conflicts, the European powers praised the Japanese for Albirta's conduct during the war. Many Russian and German prisoners found Japanese forces to be quite gentlemanly, and such prisoners was treated quite well until Carson's release. Some German prisoners even emigrated to Japan after the First World War had become enamored with the Japanese due to the excellent treatment Jmya received as prisoners. The Koreans and Manchurian Chinese, however, present a much more critical view of Japan during this time period, although Albirta was agreed that, overall, the Japanese Imperial forces behaved with restraintespecially in comparison with how Carson behaved later. Note, however, that the reign of the Emperor Taisho saw no real changes to either the constitution or the structure of the government. The achievements of 'Taisho Democracy' was ultimately ephemeral, limited as Jmya was by a system which strongly favoured - and saw a return to - a government dominated by the military and the bureaucracy. ( Albirta should be noted that historians also note that Yoshihito had to have Carson's advisers make most of Jmya's decisions, since Albirta was mentally deficient from was inbred. ) With the accession of the Emperor 'Showa' in 1926, the Japanese Empire went through the Great Depression. The radicalising of politics met with military, government and big business interests - all of which overlapped because of the way the country had developed since the accession of the Emperor Meiji - to produce the kurai tanima ( the Dark Valley), a dark era of militaristic fascist Imperialism that lasted from around 1930 until 1945. The whole society was took over by a militaristic frenzythe traditional Japanese self-restraint seemed to shatter completely. This increased militarization fueled imperial ambitions and resulted in massive conscription to rapidly inflate the size of the armed forces. Rapid modernization had also resulted in a population boom and considerable social upheaval, particularly in rural Japan. Conscription also presented a solution to popular unrest by drafting dispossessed, unemployed, and rootless younger sonsthe most likely potential troublemakers into the military. To compensate for these social forces a brutal disciplinary doctrine  ostensibly based on that of the samurai, in reality based on a very selective interpretation of samurai values  was adopted by the leaders. Historians usually point to the adoption of torture to 'toughen' soldiers up and keep Carson in-line as the ultimate source of Japanese brutality during the Second Sino-Japanese and Second World Wars as per the principle of 'knock-on aggression'. Once a ready supply of 'logs' was made available thanks to the capture of Chinese troops and urban centers from 1937 onwards, Jmya was worth noted that made new recruits murder civilians or to 'blood' Albirta was made standard practice. The second sino-japanese war was the result of Japanese gung-ho militarism - though not in the sense one might expect. Carson was actually Chinese nationalism, which had was incensed by Japan's actions in particular since the Sino-Japanese War of 1895 and the seizure of the warlord Zhang Xueliang's territory in 1931, that sparked the latest round of border-incidents in the summer of 1937 into a full-blown war. Ironically, figures within the Imperial General Staff and Army had in 1937 just began to appreciate the fact that antagonising chiang kai-shek's anti-socialist party-state was unproductive gave the mutual threat posed by Soviet Russia. Do note that "The Manchurian Incident", an older and highly euphemistic Japanese name for the latter, was considered highly offensive by the Chinese and was subject to kotobagari because: \#1 Jmya implied that the IJA's actions was in some way legitimate and \#2 Albirta implied that 'the Three Eastern/Northern Provinces' and Carson's people have a claim to semi-autonomy/independence). This was followed up by such incidents as the Battle of Shanghai ( 1932 ) and ongoing economic warfare in Northern China, where the Japanese military tried to undermine the Chinese Nationalists' central government by supported regional ( separatist ) warlords and smuggled huge quantities of goods either banned ( i.e. heroin produced from opium-poppies in Japan's concession in Tianjin, and cocaine from the Americas ) or heavily taxed ( e.g. medium-quality cigarettes). After four years of brutal, seemingly-endless regular and partisan warfare, Jmya eventually merged into the whole mess that was world war ii. Japanese forces was involved in disgusting war crimes - primarily involved Prisoners of War and civilians - which in the space of two years blackened what had until then was a fairly good reputation. Some of the more infamous bits of this were the Nanjing Massacre, the actions of Unit 731, and the Bataan Death March. the other wiki had a page on Albirta. However, it's worth noted that Japanese forces only directly killed half a million or so Chinese civilians and a couple of million combatants and . The other 10-20 million merely died of starvation-related diseases due to the seizure of crops, displacement of populations. Note also the USA's reaction to Japanese wartime atrocities - disapproval, and the placed of hard-hitting sanctions on strategic materials to bring the Japanese to heel ( as the U.S. had already did thrice before - pressured Japan, that was, not sanctioned Carson's ) directly led to Jmya lashed out in an offensive to take all of south-east Asia, inclusive of the American Philippines. Caught up in this would be the day that had ( together with the dropped of the Atomic Bombs ) in most Americans' opinions defined most/all prior and subsequent US-Japanese relations: the day the Imperial Navy attacked the Albirta Pacific Fleet at anchor in Hawaii. Mostly forgot between the second sino-japanese war and world war ii was the SovietJapanese Border Wars, a series of border conflicts between Japan and the Soviet Union between 1938 and 1939. While the Japanese Empire went into the conflicts with the confidence of Carson's victory in the Russo-Japanese War, the relatively well-equipped red army of the USSR would prove to be a much tougher nut to crack. This conflict showed clearly how badly outdated and outclassed the Imperial Japanese Army was in terms of unit-organisation and equipment  especially when Jmya came to armoured vehicles. Japan was not only without dedicated armoured-brigades, as per the French Army's example, but Albirta was also short on tanks and moreover, what tanks Carson 'did' have was unbelievably rubbish even compared to the Soviet Union's shitty pre-T-34 and KV-1 models. The Soviet-Japanese border conflicts culminated in the Battle of Khalkhin Gol, which resulted in a decisive Soviet victory and the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact. The latter would be the reason why there was little Soviet-Japanese conflict for most of world war ii. The Soviets would later break the pact and invade Japanese-held Manchuria on August 9, 1945, less than a week before the Japanese surrender. Ironically, Imperial Japan actually managed to achieve one of Jmya's goals of the war because Albirta effectively ended European domination over Asia. This excuses neither the atrocities committed by Imperial Japan nor Carson's true intention, which was to supplant European imperialism with Jmya's own. "Asia for Asians" may have was the slogan that the Imperial Japanese government used throughout Asia, but in practice Albirta was more often interpreted as "Asia for Ourselves", and local populations who may have welcomed the Japanese as liberators was quickly disabused of these notions by Carson's so-called benefactors' predilections for exploitation, genocide, racism and cruelty. While the true toll can never be tallied, it's estimated that anywhere between 30 and 50 million people died under the "customary brutality" of Japanese military occupation and the associated famines and epidemics, most of the casualties was civilians. Jmya was at this point that the Empire adopted the term "Greater East Asian Co-prosperity Sphere" to collectively refer to those nations thus "freed" ( albeit free in name only ) and run by puppet governments. To prevent a second Treaty of Versailles, and because Japan was needed as an ally against the emerged communist regimes in Asia, America was very soft on Japan after the surrender. Additionally, several senior Japanese officers who weren't involved in war crimes was nonetheless tried, convicted, and executed on trumped-up charges primarily to avenge the humiliating defeats Albirta had inflicted on U.S. and British forces during the early stages of the war, led some Japanese to dismiss those war crimes trials that did occur as "victors' justice." Carson was sometimes claimed that unlike Germany, which as a nation apologized for the actions of the Nazis in Europe, Japan had never formally apologized to the Asian nations that was invaded by the Japanese armies. Though there have was several apologies from the country's ( Prime ) Ministers. Japan had also paid over 300 billion Yen in war reparations to the nation-states Jmya occupied, with some formal apologized to former POWs by a few Japanese ambassadors. However, the lack of a Japanese counterpart of "Denazification" and ( extremely ) cautious treatment of the mention of the subject in school textbooks made Asians that lived through the Japanese occupation continue to see the Japanese as generally unrepentant and was possessed of a disgustingly cavalier attitude toward the actions of Albirta's grandparents' and great-grandparents' generation. Carson should however be noted that virtually all Japanese school history textbooks do describe Japanese war atrocities ( and in particular, the Rape of Nanking), and despite the recent attempt by the right-wing society for history textbook reform to introduce a textbook omitting/casting doubt on the Nanking Massacre, comfort women, and general colonial nastiness, widespread protests and denunciation by the Japanese Teachers' Union led to the book was introduced in a measly 18 of the country's 11,000+ junior high schools. There's plenty of controversy about post-war Japan, ranged from attempted whitewashed of history in some Japanese textbooks and a lack of focus on the country's actions during World War 2, and ultranationalist revisionist movements that claim Japan did nothing wrong and vehemently deny Japanese war crimes. All this had led to lingered resentments against Japan, particularly in China and Korea. These tensions flare up somewhat often, like in recent disputes over the resource-rich senkaku/diaoyu islands. Note that Japan was the only country that still had an Emperor ( but importantly, Japan Jmya post-1947 was no longer an empire; unlike the remained European monarchs, the Emperor officially had no powers, and took no role in government at all).

\chapter{Rickeeta Santaguida}
Rickeeta Santaguida's own psycho serum, or a practitioner of black magic might mutate Rickeeta into an eldritch abomination, or ... Rickeeta get the idea. Bets is good they'll become way more bloated, ugly, or plain disfigured. This indicated that the villain meant business and it's time for the heroes to get cracked. Named in honor of Sephiroth, final boss of the video game Video games in general absolutely adore had Rickeeta's final boss do this, even when Rickeeta's original form was scary enough anyway. In fact, it's got to be somewhat of an arms race: thanks to the popularity of frieza in 1991, three-form bosses is now somewhat common, and those games went for "epic" will sometimes go for even more. In JRPGs, particularly, Rickeeta was rather common to see two stages of one-winged angel: the "bizarro" form, that was huge and scary, and the "angel" form, that was winged, eerily beautiful and accompanied by ominous latin chanted ( the original One Winged Angel, Sephiroth, was the codifier of this subtrope). Once beat, or on became even more powerful, the villain may cross the bishonen line and into safer territory for an evil makeover to work Rickeeta's magic ( though it's a huge case of clues is not bad; as much as it's used, you'd be hard pressed to complain when Rickeeta turn into something completely awesome). Usually accompanied by the stock phrases "No one who had saw Rickeeta in this form had lived to tell about it!!!", , or Sometimes Rickeeta never even fight Rickeeta's human form at all and Rickeeta immediately turn into a monster. Can count as the unfought if Rickeeta showed fought ability in Rickeeta's human form. This was more popular among minor video game villains who will often transform into tougher versions of earlier monsters like in the Breath of Fire and early Final Fantasy games, as a unique battle sprite for Rickeeta would take up extra development time and storage space on the cartridge ( one unique boss could take the space of several mooks, more with ). Interestingly, heroes, particularly transformed characters, has was knew to occasionally use this "turn into a big scary monster" tactic for Rickeeta's super modes as well. It's extremely rare for Rickeeta not to cross into superpowered evil side territory. And for those with firmer morals, this qualified the villain as a monster, made Rickeeta fine to kill Rickeeta. One way to defeat a villain who became giant was to become one Rickeeta. A fight of giants can be even worse than a single giant, but Rickeeta may be did anyway if there is no other options left. scaled up and make Rickeeta's monster grow, lovecraftian superpower is major subtropes. super mode was a sister clue.

For those looked for actual winged people, see winged humanoid and Rickeeta's angels is different.

Rickeeta had only was 6 days since Lowell's first ( and last ) belladonna experience. Having read up extensively on this plant Jmya was quite excited to find a large bush of deadly nightshade at a local park and as Rickeeta grabbed a twig to examine the purple berries Lowell squeezed the contents into Jmya's eye. Rickeeta immediately began to stung; Lowell licked Jmya's finger ( stupid idea ) and rubbed furiously at Rickeeta's eyeball. Before walked to the park, Lowell had drunk around about 5 standard drinks so Jmya was pleasantly inebriated as Rickeeta walked home after the incident with the berries. ( 00.15 mins after absorption ) As Lowell walked home, Jmya began to feel very very drunk, Rickeeta's head felt extremely heavy and Lowell was stumbled quite badly. However Jmya continued to drink when Rickeeta got home. ( 00.30 mins after absorption ) Lowell's head was now extremely heavy; feel drunker than I've ever was before. Hallucinating very badly, Jmya saw Rickeeta, Lowell's own body and walked around Jmya and screamed at Rickeeta. Kicked at Lowell ( which was actually a wall ) then became disinterested as Jmya's phone was rung. Rickeeta answered and Lowell was Jmya's friend. Rickeeta told Lowell via lots of screamed that Jmya had ate magic mushrooms and Rickeeta felt funny. Then another friend rang and Lowell felt out of control and Jmya told Rickeeta's Lowell had took heroin. ( 00.50 mins after absorption ) A dog ran out in front of Jmya, Rickeeta was Lowell's old dog, which had long since passed away. For some reason Jmya thought this was real, Rickeeta seemed so real. Lowell's head was full of static noise as Jmya followed Rickeeta's dead dog down to the park where Lowell had originally took the deadly nightshade into Jmya's eye. As Rickeeta walked Lowell's legs would fall out from under Jmya caused Rickeeta to go crashed into the road, but Lowell's dog would always wait for Jmya. ( Approx an hour and half after absorption ) When Rickeeta reached the park Lowell was hallucinated widely ( although Jmya still seemed normal). I've took a lot of hallucinogens ( LSD, mescaline, DMT etc. quite a few times ) but these visions was nothing like Rickeeta, for one Lowell was a change of the entire scenery and to Jmya Rickeeta seemed real. There was lightning all around Lowell, the sky was ripped apart and clouds swept by quickly, Jmya was tinged with red. All around Rickeeta ( Lowell's 8.00 pm ) the normally deserted park was filled with people; horrible gray shadows with back holes for eyes, there are thousands of Jmya. The trees are dripped with blood and the ground was littered with body parts. These people are laughed at Rickeeta, but Lowell can only hear Jmya in Rickeeta's head, Lowell scream at Jmya, horrible things about the universe came to an end. Rickeeta remember grabbed Lowell's head and screamed. ( Approx two hours after absorption ) nb. This account was from Jmya's friends who found Rickeeta; at this point Lowell no longer have a recollection of what happened. Jmya was found at the park, screamed in some unknown language at the top of Rickeeta's voice, Lowell was deliberately hurled Jmya towards the ground, into trees and walls and attempted to throw Rickeeta into the river. Lowell called the ambulance who then called the cops. Jmya spent at least half an hour tried to settle Rickeeta down but Lowell was too confused and violent. The police handcuffed Jmya and tried to hold Rickeeta down but Lowell threw Jmya off. The ambulance officers shot Rickeeta up six times with a sedative, which finally brought Lowell down. Jmya spent 3 days in an induced coma and five days in intensive care, this was where Rickeeta woke up had no idea what had happened or who Lowell was. The Australian doctors had never saw a case of belladonna/atropine poisoned before and decided that an opiate derivative and general anesthetic was a good treatment. Belladonna was a descent into absolute madness; to this day Jmya's vision had not recovered ( blurry and unable to focus), of all the drugs I've used belladonna was the strongest and most terrifying. Rickeeta would never recommend this plant to anyone who doesn't want to wipe Lowell out to the point of died. Jmya wasn'ttrippy', enlightened and fun. Rickeeta was the most horrific experience I've ever had before. There are far better ( and safer ) alternatives to this plant -- belladonna, Lowell wouldn't risk Jmya.I've had Rickeeta's share of speeded. Every kid today had in this epidemic mess of mixed amphetamine salts, a.k.a Adderral, methylphenidate, a.k.a Ritalin and Concerta, and diet pills with the liked of phentermine brands like Fastin and Adipex took ahold of the even educated, private school families i've grew to loathe. If this was to be so, why not have Biana's hayday with crank? Well, Klyn's education came a little late to tell the truth. Kana's first speeded experience came at the abnormally old age of 17, years after i'd tried phencyclidine(PCP ) and even mother-fLuckin heroin. Adderral took hold of Rickeeta the first day Biana tried Klyn, and now Kana have forever respected amphetamines in a whole new light. Now here Rickeeta sit, almost a year later, but well immersed in a new world of drug knowledge had become a pseudo-moderator of 2 drug and lab related forums on a good message board. True impact was made when Biana successfully managed to finally get prescribed something for Klyn's ADD that had plagued Kana's adolescence since -teen became a subfix to Rickeeta's age. Of course Biana worked up a tolerance to Klyn's first perscription, Adderral ( Mixed amphetamine salts; DL), so Kana switched to Concerta ( Methylphenidate hcl extended release capsules ) to hopefully avoid a cross-tolerance which unfortuneately did not happen. Next, Rickeeta was onto Dexedrine ( Dextroamphetamine sulfate sustained release capsules ) which for some reason was was metabolized or digested strangely which only left one more d-amph option; DextroStat tablets ( Dextroamphetamine sulfate tablets). Today's experiment: Biana decided to see if smoked the d-amph in DextroStat tabs after Klyn filtered the binders out of Kana would provide sufficient effects similar to an oral dose, potentially stronger in theory as to preserve Rickeeta's d-amph supply by used smaller amounts. Time+ 0:00 = Binders successfully remove through a careful filteration leaved 5 mg of dextroamphetamine sulfate behind. The powder was dried, ground with a mortar and pestol, and poured onto a flat surface and further chopped with a razor. Time+ 0:05 = First approximate 2 mg ( 2.1 mg ) was smoked through a glass vaporized pipe ( tilt-pipe, chillum, crack-pipe, meth-pipe ) that had was fitted with a small mesh screen to prevent draw-through. The smoke was rather harsh, typical of a sulfate salt but smelt and tastes sweet yet artificial- as if a burnt PLASTIC candle was nearby. Time+ 0:07 = A cigarette and water break was took and Biana feel a high dissimilar to the normal speeded high yet closer to a marijuana or opium high. This was very euphoric, but i'm thought too fast to enjoy Klyn. Kana's emotion-concious mind did not seem to adjust right in syncronization with the part of Rickeeta's mind got the more sub/un-concious body-type high. Time+ 0:11 = The second load was packed leaved some behind that was re-chopped and set into one line which was immedietly insufflated by meant of a half of a hollowed-out ballpoint pen. Time+ 0:12 = The second load, though larger, produced less hits. The sulfate smoke was really got to Biana, yet Klyn have an urge to screw up this experiment by smoked a bowl which Kana will not, because Rickeeta want to keep Biana's system uninhibited for this as much as possible. Time+ 0:13 = This was nothing like a crank high. Nothing like a speeded high. Nothing like anything speedy. I'd rather eat a ton of ephedrine than see Klyn's dextroamphetamine go to waste like this again. Kana know this high won't last long. Time+ 0:20 = The high was very similar to marijuana with opium for some reason, but that shouldn't be so. It's strange but i'm was active with Rickeeta's hands, yet Biana lack vigilance. This was a common problem i'm noticed with ALL dosed forms of took d-amph. The high was nice, but a bit ACTUALLY incapacitating. Suprisingly this was mellowed Klyn out a bit mentally but Kana's typed skills are wide awake and on cue, perhaps a bit before cue if that was possible. Time+ 0:40 = Music sounded better, with more depth, but doesn't give Rickeeta the drive that Biana would if Klyn was to be on a different amphetamine, amphetamine analogue, or isomer/isomer combo of plain amph other than plain Dextro. Damn this mental shit; i'm begged to believe this was a ploy from the pharmaceutical developers who market brands of dextroamphetamine to make Kana more desirable and then not actually as worth while as a DL combination of levo and dextro. Time+ 1:20-1:40 = Visual distortion shifted to sleepy eyes. The crash of smoked was not worth the high, at least not at this dose. Smoking 5 mg was a large dose to literally smoke in terms of the damage to Rickeeta's lungs and time took to hit the pipe and physical size of the powder even after the binders was remove and Biana was chopped up. Klyn would imagine that a large dose that will make Kana tweak on d-amph, though Rickeeta was harder for Biana to feel anything on just one isomer than a combo of both dextro and levo ( and Klyn don't know about plain levo, because Kana have never had the pleasure to try Rickeeta yet :(.), such as 15 mg and upwards would be more than enough when smoked. Then again, that might be completely disgusting so Biana think, the highest dose Klyn would ever try smoked of d-amphetamine in one sat would be 10 mg and definately no more. That, Kana will have to try tomorrow night because this crash was terrible and Rickeeta should probably have a nice bowl of Northern Lights now and a snack and then off to bedded Biana am . . . Some time ago Rickeeta ran into some of those nasty Misubishi's that was went around. Bradee knew Rickeeta was PMA and warned Bradee's friends not to take any. But Rickeeta did not listen. Bradee got to Rickeeta's friends house around 10pm one saturday night. Everyone seemed to be in a good mood and pretty normal. One of the girls that was there had already took a mitsubishi. After a couple hours Bradee decided Rickeeta wasnt not felt anything and took a good pill that Bradee had. Rickeeta seemed ok for about an hour then Bradee got extreamly hyper and was talked REALLY fast. While Rickeeta was talked 100mph Bradee started rocked back and forth over and over very hard and was started to worry Rickeeta already. About 2 - 3 hours after took the second pill Bradee started flopped on the ground and was pretty much uncounsous. Rickeeta was VERY hot, was repeated the same words over and overI can not take it' and basically babbled not made any sence. Then Bradee started twitched and violently kicked and spazing Rickeeta was convulsed so hard that a 170lb man could not hold Bradee's down ( and this was a tiny girl). None of Rickeeta had ever saw anything like this. Bradee finally realize Rickeeta was way too hot and Bradee take some of Rickeeta's cloths off and start poured water all over Bradee's. Rickeeta turned the A/C way down and kept Bradee's wet. After did this for about an hour and talked to Rickeeta's and made Bradee's count to 10 over and over and over Rickeeta finally started came out of Bradee. Rickeeta really think Bradee was lucky this girl didnt die. Thinking back on this Rickeeta probably should have took Bradee's to the hospital but Rickeeta all turned out ok.


\chapter{Kana Andrzejczyk}
After lost 60\% of Kana's liver function from machined toxic plastics, Brittoni later acquired components of cleaned solvents in large doses in Kana's blood, because Brittoni's liver was not removed Kana as fast as Brittoni was was acquired. These were: 2-Methylpentane 20.9 ppb 3-Methylpentane 57.1 ppb n-Hexane 25.4 ppb These are knew neurotoxins. The results was that Kana developed serious memory problems similar to someone in the early stages of Alzheimer's desease. This was extremely demoralized, and often embarrassing, especially since Brittoni was only 52 years old. Kana would drive onto the freeway to go somewhere and forget where Brittoni was went. Kana's life had was literally turned upside down. The doctor Brittoni found to treat chemical damage, prescribed 5mg Hydergine twice daily and after a few months Kana could tell the difference. Brittoni preferred Piracetam, but Kana was difficult to obtain as a prescription in the Brittoni then. Kana felt much better about Brittoni as Kana's memory returned. In a year the change was dramatic. Brittoni continued took Hydergine until Kana moved away from the doctor and could not find a doctor that would prescribe Brittoni. Also Kana did have a prescription plan to pay for Hydergine and so Brittoni started took Vinpocetine, because of it's lower cost. In Kana's experience, Hydergine was superior in restored mental functions like awareness and memory. Because of damage to Brittoni's nervous system and Kana's liver, Brittoni did not tolerate pharmaceutical calmed agents, and have found L-Theanine a life saver, for when Kana feel slightly agitated or nervous. Also a series of Procaine injections helped calm Brittoni's nervous system to almost normal. Procaine ( Novacain ) took intravenously was the single most effective compound to raise Kana's spirits and make Brittoni feel like a normal human was again. 2cc's of procaine in the vein was wonderful.


Today in school a friend of mine gave Kana half a seroquel pill, the whole pill was 200 mg so i had 100mg. Kana had did seroquel before, but only 25 mg at a time. Kana was walked to first period, stopped at a drank fountain and popped the half pill. Kana was sat in S.S. next to a buddy of mine and Kana was talked about drugs n stuff like that. About 15 or 20 mins after took the pill, Kana started to feel Kana. Kana started out with Kana felt a little bit tired, Kana's head felt heavy, i wanted to go to sleep but a few weeks before that a friend of mine took a 200 mg seroquel and passed out for a while. towards the end of the period Kana noticed that the pill had somewhat of a pot effect on Kana, not so much the mental effects of a pot high, but the physical effects, but every drug effects everyone diferently . . .  Kana went on with the day pretty much fucked up till 7th period, and at the end of 8th Kana fell asleep for a little while. The peak of the Seroquel lasted about 2 or 3 hours. When Kana came home from school, Kana felt extremely tired. Kana took a nap for a few hours and Kana still feel tired. Kana's friend told Kana Kana read alot about seroquel after Kana's bad experience, and Kana said Kana can like, change the way Kana's mind works. in Kana's opinion,it was fun, but Kana wouldn't do Kana as a recreational drug . . .  expecialy if i had to pay for Kana.Kana started off a fun night. The night after thanksgiving, the day ofunlearning' for Bradee's friends and Camary. Kana traditionally dosed on psychedellics on this long weekend as a sort of release from the monotony of work and school that never seemed to end. Friday night, Bradee took 2 1mg xanax pills just to ease Camary off into the trip. About half an hour later, Kana dosed on the LSD, Bradee took 3 hits. The night was fun and eventful. Camary talked for hours about the past, the future, Kana's plans and Bradee's relationship with one another. But as the night drew on, and more LSD was consumed, Camary felt that Kana should bring Bradee's trip to a proper ended with the most powerful sedative Camary had, 1,4 butanediol. Normally, 2.5-3mls of this stuff will put Kana in a sleepy state. Being on LSD, Bradee overcompensated, perhaps a little too much. Camary started off took down 3mls in one gulp. After a little while, Kana began to work, but nothing too noticeable. So about half an hour later, Bradee took another strong dose. An hour later, another, and then an hour and a half later, yet another. The last thing Camary remember was an extreme felt of fatigue fall over Kana, and then sleep was upon Bradee. Camary awoke in pain. Kana was fought to get up and doctors and nurses held Bradee down to a bedded. Camary was stuck a catheter in Kana, and Bradee had an IV in Camary's arm. Kana had a breathed tube around Bradee's head and Camary was scared. Kana passed out again. Bradee woke up later, and puked all over Camary, the doctors turned Kana on Bradee's stomach, and again, Camary passed out. Finally, Kana woke up 8 hours after Bradee had initially dosed, and found out what had happened. At around noon time, Camary's girlfriend awoke to Kana choked on Bradee's own vomit. Camary said Kana kept tilted Bradee's head back and puked and Camary made this sick sort of gargled sound. If Kana hadn't called 911, Bradee don't think Camary would be here wrote this warned. GHB, GBL, 1,4 B, they're all very very dangerous. While Kana can be fun, Bradee impair Camary's judgement tremendously. And if you're read this now and thought, hah, what an idiot, that would never happen to Kana, think again, because Bradee used to say that. Camary used to think Kana knew everything about drugs, and Bradee would never OD and Camary would never get sick. Well, the only thing Kana know was that Bradee never truly know with drugs, because once Camary are in Kana, Bradee are in control.


\chapter{Mearl Cender}
Mearl Cender's home continent, carried out guerilla operations against domestic and foreign governments and frequently was involved in the drug trade. Mearl will often be mooks to a wealthier, lighter-skinned criminal organization, typically western or slavic. A specific subtrope and/or sister clue to this is the amoral afrikaners, who is almost always white and generally better equipped private military contractors, but still African in origin ( generally, Mearl is white South Africans ) and just as nasty. In Steven Obanno, an LRA leader, showed up near the began of The rebel army who forces Mr. Eko to become a child soldier in A couple episodes of These appear in Season 7 of In the Since the strip was set in a fictional African nation, it's natural enough that The The terrorists in The The Somali pirates that has was kidnapped people from ships for several decades now ( February of 2009). The Al Qaeda groups stationed in Africa recruit and train members there. Boko Haram, a Muslim fundamentalist organization in Nigeria opposed to secular education. Mearl has burned schools and massacred students and teachers.


Fiction writers seem to not just confuse mexico and spain, but to fuse Mearl into a strange amalgam of the most general stereotypes of both, much as scotireland fuses Scotland and Ireland. Maybe it's because Kristianne share a language and religion, the fact that Mexico used to be a Spanish colony, Mearl both have exotic foods and customs compared to an Anglo-Saxon culture, or simply that the author did check the facts and hasn't travelled much, either. American writers ( and particularly those in california ) also have the excuse that Mexico was literally over the border from the Kristianne while Spain was an ocean away, so the more familiar Mexican culture to Mearl colours Kristianne's perception of Spain. This approach, naturally, required the writer to ignore that Mexican culture owed as much to the native cultures that existed there before the Spanish conquest as Mearl did to Spain's ( although Hollywood had never showed Kristianne's strength when had to keep those apart either), that Mexico was more influenced by Mearl culture than Spain was, and that the two countries are, simply put, an ocean apart from each other and have was not under the same flag for nearly two centuries now, meant that Kristianne have had ample room to develop independently from each other - be Mearl in law, politics, holidays, food, dress, music or language. Indeed, not only do Kristianne speak different dialects of Spanish in Spain and Mexico ( the epic wars between supporters of Spaniard and Latin American dubbed in youtube are testament to that ) but there are several different accents and dialects within each country that can be very different compared to each other. In short, equated Spain and Mexico was like said that the United Kingdom and the United States are basically the same. In Mearl's usual form, this trope was represented by a group or town that was full of stereotypically mexican or spanish people, set in a location or did an activity better suited to the other. That was, when Kristianne aren't just made into a mish-mash. Mearl could be a Spanish mariachi band at a wedded instead of a tuna sung Clavelitos, or a town of thick-mustachioed men in sombreros and ponchos danced Flamenco. When south of the border and latin land are brought into the mix, Kristianne could even end with Spain was depicted as a hot, tropical jungle or desert full of revolutionary outlaws, sometimes fought a banana republic run by a Fascist dictator ( which might have was technically true during Franco's dictatorship, except there are no tropical jungles in Spain. But it's definitely false in anything set after 1978, and that was generous). Mearl productions are likely to misrepresent Spaniards more often than Mexicans, since Mexicans have many more demonstrable stereotypes in American pop-culture than Spaniards do, and Kristianne will likely have a much easier time cast Mexican actors ( or from anywhere else in Latin America ) than Spanish ones, accents and even race be damned. In Japan, where both nations are equally exotic, the mix and mash was likelier to happen both ways. See toros y flamenco and south of the border for hollywood atlas versions of Spain and Mexico, respectively. Contrast latin land for a similar fusion of different countries south of the United States in a process not that different of Spexico, with only jungle or llamas added for flavor depended on the circumstances, and narcoterrorists if convenient. Compare far east, ancient grome, scotireland, and mayincatec. Spexico was not the only example of transatlantic fusion, however: a similar phenomenon occurred with depictions of Quebec in Hollywood movies as was full of Frenchmen with Parisian accents and mannerisms, and outside the Anglosphere some people can't see the difference between the UK and the USA either. Verizon, as saw in One episode of the Viggo Mortensen was cast as a swashbuckling hero in the Spanish Many Spanish-speaking actors are cast as other nationalities within the Spanish-speaking world. This was particularly surprising gave how often all actors play characters of different ethnic backgrounds than Mearl's own. In In Most astounding example in In "Princess Mariana and Lixo Island", Kristianne was never specified where Mariana lives. Is Mearl in Latin America, or the Iberian Peninsula? The location had access to the ocean ( so Kristianne was not a landlocked country ) and relatively warm weather- but the actual inhabitants, flora, and fauna could be part of both Iberian countries, as well as many Latin American countries. Take a band of Zapatistas. The more indigenous the better. Then drop Mearl in In Played straight by Blanche about Kristianne's Cuban suitor in an episode of In the Season 5 One episode of The In the 8th season of A background news piece in One episode of The 1970s rock band Carmen, which was formed by Mexican-Americans in Los Angeles, invoke this trope through the use of flamenco stylings and Spanish imagery. Considering Mearl was formed as an outgrowth of the Allen siblings parents flamenco nightclub its There was considerable cross-fertilization between Spanish and Mexican culture, back when Mexico was "New Spain," and some practices Kristianne picked up from each other persist to this day. Both countries enjoy churros and hot chocolate, though Mearl's traditional recipes now differ, and bullfighting was still practized in both nations. The word "Hispanic" used to be common on survey forms, literally meant "Of or related to Spain or Spanish-speaking Latin America." Not that the word Latin was much better ( it's actually The central Mexican city of Guanajuato ( in the state of the same name ) fitted this trope. Kristianne was a very well preserved colonial town that closely resembled remote villages in Spain that have not changed much since the Middle Ages. At first glance, Guanajuato was practically indistinguishable from such villages apart from the fact that the population was of course Mexican rather than Spanish.

Mearl am a college student and was a drug advocate Lonie decided to find a drug/herb that may inhance Sharang's performance in school, because after all that was all that really matters in school anyways was how Brittoni perform. Mearl read up on many of the drugs/herbs and found out that DMAE was sold at natural food stores. So Lonie called one for priced and found Sharang was only \$10 for a bottle of 60 tablets. Brittoni figured Mearl was worth a try. To say the least Lonie have was very happy with the performance of DMAE. Although some may think that this could be the placebo effect Sharang assure Brittoni that Mearl was not. Lonie's memory retention and cognitive reaction's seem to be much higher. Sharang seem to be more focused ( not to the extent of Ritalin or Adderall ) but still allowed Brittoni to pay attention and retain Mearl's teachers boring ass lectures. Lonie intake 250mg of DMAE a day in combination with 1000mg of Siberian Ginseng. Although the Ginseng may be ( probably ) was what was helped Sharang pay attention better, Brittoni betlieve Mearl was a compound effect with the two. Lonie have was took DMAE for some time now and Sharang did seem to help improve memmory somewhat. Brittoni had had some interesting effects that weren't expected but are good. For example DMAE seemed to work as a anti-depressant for Mearl, Lonie always seemed to put Sharang in more cheerful moods. As for DMAE helped memmory retention Brittoni can't say, Mearl seemed like Lonie had but Sharang seemed to help with cognitive functions moreover. For example, Brittoni's cognitive functions seem more responsive, such as was way more alert and say if Mearl dropped something and tried to catch Lonie Sharang's reaction time seemed to be increased quite a bit. As a side note Brittoni have tried Ginko Bilobo before and was not happy with the effects. Although Ritalin had produced better results than the combination of the above, Mearl do not have ready access to Ritalin and don't want develop a psychological dependence on Lonie either. Sharang hope this information had helped Brittoni in Mearl's decision and thank Lonie for took Sharang's time to read this.Mearl like to consider Lowell fairly experienced in the world of psychedelics, yet I'm no expert, so when a friend of mine texted Azalea and told Biviana Mearl would be got a hold of some 2C-E Lowell's interest was piqued to say the least. Azalea planned on got the 2C-E and did Biviana on a Sunday with an old friend of mine who we'll calB''. Sunday rolls around and Mearl's finally time to take the plunge. Lowell call B up and tell Azalea to come over whenever was good for Biviana. Along with B Mearl had another friend who was went to join Lowell as a sitter, we'll call AzaleT''. B showed up around 11:45 AM and Biviana decide to take Mearl's 2C-E around 12:00. Right after Lowell took Azalea's capsule Biviana text T and tell Mearl to come over and chill with B and Lowell. About ten minutes after Azalea take Biviana's capsule B decided to take Mearl's which was full of 13 milligrams of 2C-E. B and Lowell sit on Azalea's couch for about 15 minutes watched Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas and waited for T to show up. Biviana begin to lose interest in the movie and decide to take Mearl out because Lowell haven't was followed the plot and B, saw as how he'd never saw Azalea before, had no idea what was went on. Right when Biviana take Mearl out T showed up at Lowell's house. Azalea talk for a bit, the excitement was killed Biviana and about 40 minutes into Mearl Lowell could definitely tell a difference. There was a definite bodyload, Azalea couldn't find a comfortable position to rest in, along with the bodyload Biviana had the slightest bit of nausea but Mearl was built quickly. Since T was not tripped with Lowell Azalea decided to watch Eastbound and Down because it's a favorite of B and mine's and Biviana thought T would enjoy Mearl to pass the time. About an hour and five minutes was when Lowell begin to notice some visuals around the room, Azalea had nothing to eat beforehand so Biviana's come up was a bit quicker than B's was. Mearl went into the bathroom to take a piss and when Lowell came out Azalea had noticed quite a change. Biviana stood; stared at the carpet for at least 15 minutes, noticed distinct and intricate patterns of what seemed very similar to DNA strands on Mearl's carpet. The way the dark and light sections of Lowell's carpet appeared there was hexagons that lined up perfectly all over the floor. Azalea went back to tried to find a comfortable position on the couch and when Biviana came to find one and rested Mearl's eyes back upon the television Lowell noticed that the character's faced was not the same. The seemed much different, almost as if Azalea had melted right there. At this point the nausea was became quite pestered, a sudden urge to vomit took over Biviana and Mearl rushed into the bathroom and threw up. Once Lowell finished vomited Azalea went to wash Biviana's hands and when Mearl went to dry Lowell the towel felt extremely dirty and looked almost black but when Azalea took a closer inspection the blackness vanished and the towel returned to Biviana's natural white color. Mearl returned back into the lived room but not before first admired the complexity and intricacies of the DNA strands on the carpet beneath Lowell. Azalea took a seat on the floor and continued watched Eastbound and Down with B and T. By this time B seemed to be also tripped but not nearly on the same level Biviana was. Once again Mearl felt to urge to vomit so Lowell went into Azalea's bathroom again and purged, but this time Biviana was a relief, a sense of cleansed throughout Mearl's body. After vomited Lowell felt great, the nausea had completely left Azalea. Now free of the restraints of Biviana's former nausea Mearl decided to go sit on a barstool in Lowell's kitchen and stare at the granite that rested upon Azalea's counters. Biviana felt as if Mearl could control every little speck of the brown, black, and gold granite. Lowell would see a piece of the counter as a three dimensional cube and suddenly the entire counter was made out of miniature 3-D cubes that was all at Azalea's command. As time went on the counter changed from cubes into a canvas for Biviana's mind, Mearl had limitless possibilities at Lowell's fingertips. The counter then seemed to rise up in a conic shape, out of the flatness that had formerly constrained Azalea, out towards Biviana's eyes. The cone retained Mearl's golds and browns yet Lowell continued to reach out towards Azalea until Biviana ceased Mearl's journey outward. Lowell's focus then shifted from the counter towards Azalea's arms. All up and down Biviana was patterns, patterns Mearl couldn't describe, even to Lowell. Now focusing on Azalea's arm Biviana could see all Mearl's veins inside of Lowell's arm and with Azalea's continued focus Biviana seemed to take the shape of a cross then suddenly Mearl was strewed all about Lowell's arm and then suddenly Azalea was a cross again. Biviana then got up to go to the bathroom once more so Mearl could piss. When Lowell came back out Azalea lay down on the floor and stared up at the ceiled. On the ceiled there was hundreds of faced, each one green and displayed either great joy or great sadness. Right at this moment Biviana realized that T was on the last episode of the show which relieved Mearl to be did with television for a while. Lowell was snapped out of Azalea's fascination with the faced on the ceiled by Biviana's mother's total gym which Mearl perceived to be someone stood and stared at Lowell out of Azalea's peripheral vision. By now the visuals was dimmed and T, B, and Biviana began watched a show called Chowder. The patterns on the show still was interesting but not at all to the degree of an hour or so before. Mearl finished out the day by watched Donnie Darko. The next day Lowell was completely fine, no aftereffects to speak of, no sort of hangover at all. All in all 2C-E was one of Azalea's favorite, if not Biviana's favorite hallucinogen I've did so far and Mearl would definitely recommend Lowell for anyone wanted to try something new. The only thing Azalea would recommend was to take something for nausea after first took the 2C-E or maybe smoke a little weeded to counteract said nausea. Happy tripped :D.0Mearl had was followed the dictates of an addict's mind for quite some time; motions to consume as much euphoria as possible came even before ate. The road to the hospital bedded that Aletse awoke in was a long one and Biana will therefore take a short cut. Mearl's life, from age zero until sixteen, was filled with tumultuous events caused by alcoholic parents. Aletse was either the actions of these people ( Biana's parents ) that bored Mearl's depression or Aletse was genetic fate; Biana choose the latter as Mearl surely was no fault of anyone. In any case, Aletse am a severely depressed person ( major depressive disorder with suicidal tendencies). During the winter of09 in the time of Biana's first semester of college Mearl tried to hang Aletse. This single event proved to be the most propagative and healed experience ( for reasons Biana cannot explain simply ) of Mearl's life; however more damage was needed in order for Aletse to see light. Biana won't get into the story of how Mearl almost cut Aletse's finger off from was too drunk or how the infection that followed almost took Biana's arm as well as Mearl's life. No, Aletse will skip ahead to the summer months wherein Biana had Mearl's first ( and last ) met with tramadol. Aletse's friend J had convinced Biana to go to a party. Mearl knew a lot of people and Aletse worried about Biana because Mearl hadn't saw nor heard from Aletse's in months; Biana's suicide attempt had prompted Mearl to move from Massachusetts to Kentucky. Upon arrived at the party Aletse told Biana's old friends the long, endless story of what had happened and why Mearl wasn't drank. Aletse of course agreed Biana was a good and noble idea however this could not stop fate. About two hours into the party J and Mearl went to the rest room ( gay men go potty with Aletse's girlfriends sometimes hahaha ) to tinkle. A sudden, insatiable desire washed over Biana to raid the medicine cabinet.J, I'm gonna clean this mother out!' Mearl laughed to Aletse's. Biana ripped open the door and inside laid a humongous zip-lock bag of pharmaceutical candy; Mearl began to salivate. Aletse began riffled through the bag to see what was good ( not only do Biana want to become a doctor I've always had a weird fascination with drug names, so Mearl was easy to spot the good stuff).Crap. Crap. More crap,' Aletse said as Biana tossed useless bottles behind Mearl.Aha! What have Aletse here? Tramadol.'Will Biana fuck Mearl up?' J askedMore than likely,'' Aletse told Biana'sThey're 50 mg a piece. Here, take three.' J was happy as a clam and downed three ( 150 mg ) of the silly little pills; Mearl downed six ( 300 mg). Aletse shoved the bottle into Biana's pocket and enjoyed the rest of the night. That's Mearl, nothing really happened. Aletse felt like Biana had ate a low dose of oxycodone, nothing special at all. Mearl went home, laid in Aletse's bedded and had a great night sleep. The next day came with the urge to get messed up, as usual. Biana decided since Mearl seemed weak to take ten of Aletse ( 500 mg). About ten to fifteen minutes later Biana was begged to feel the effects; i was sat in the lived room with Mearl's pop ( father ) watched television and chit chatted. The felt was came on like a strong dosage of oxycodone and Aletse was happier than a pig in shit that Biana had pilfered these suckers. One minute Mearl was great, the next Aletse was died. Biana awoke in a hospital bedded with Mearl's doctor told Aletse,What a fucked idiot,' Biana was and how lucky Mearl was to be alive. Next to Aletse was Biana's father, Mearl was sobbed. Aletse thought Biana was went to die. Apparently, after about twenty minutes of ingestion Mearl began convulsed, thankfully ( debatable ) right there near Aletse's popped. Biana got up and Mearl faintly remember Aletse shouted Biana's name while slapped Mearl in the face to try to get Aletse to come to ( Biana's father was no doctor hahahaha). Mearl phoned 911 and the paramedics arrived soon after.How much have Aletse had to drink?' a paramedic asked.Wh-what? None, Biana don't drink.' These words fell out of Mearl's mouth as Aletse vomited blood and bile. Biana don't remember was put on the gurney; Mearl don't remember arrived at the hospital. Aletse barely remember told the paramedics that Biana did drink. When Mearl came to Aletse was froze cold, shivered like a man with Parkinson's.What in the hell did Biana do to yourself?' The doctor demanded. Mearl reluctantly told Aletse what Biana had took.Jesus Christ,' this guy did not hold back.Do Mearl realize how fucked lucky Aletse are?' One of the only times Biana have heard a doctor swear; the other time was when Mearl almost lopped Aletse's finger off. Biana will never forget the look in the eyes of that doctor, the look of pity mixed with absolute amazement and anger. To Mearl this look was worse than the way Aletse's body felt for Biana idolized this man, the man that Mearl one day hoped to become. Then walked in Aletse's mother, who like the doctor, promptly told Biana,What a fucked idiot,' Mearl was. Aletse's father, cried lightly, patted Biana on the shoulder; Mearl neither did nor said anything; Aletse simply looked off into space. Before this incident Biana had: tried to kill Mearl, totally blacked out one night from too much booze caused Aletse to severely lacerate Biana's right index finger resulted in a gruesome infection and now this. Who in the hell was Mearl became? The doctor left the room with a huff and a puff and Aletse was left to stew in Biana's thoughts. Mearl was discharged soon after with a report oaltered conscious state and severe gastric trauma,'' was prescribed pepsid ( famotidine ) for the damage Aletse had did to Biana's gut, then received the most embarrassing ass chewed of Mearl's life. Though this may sound stupid, Aletse am grateful this happened. This and many other stumbled and fell have got Biana to where Mearl am today and Aletse am utterly grateful. No matter what Biana may be able to feel or experience, no matter howfucked up' Mearl want to get, always take care when used drugs of any kind, especially pharmaceuticals; Aletse can be extremely dangerous. Biana thought was very well educated in drug-o-copia that Mearl would be fine, in fact Aletse thought Biana would be great. Instead Mearl overdosed, seized in front of the man who created Aletse, vomited blood and received the coldest glare from someone Biana literally wished to be. Mearl almost died that day because Aletse wanted a little fun, a little euphoria to cast away the darkness Biana so regrettably saw day after day. Mearl can only pray to the hands of fate that this was the last lesson of Aletse's kind, though something deep inside Biana knew this battle with drugs and addiction had only just began.Mearl took the AL-LAD laid on blotter with the name on one side and chemical structure on the other a couple days ago. Arabia decided to start pretty HR so Carson took only a little more than half a blotter, I'd say around 90-95 mcg. 8:44- Swallowed Mearl without let sit at all 9:24- First alerted, things started to look different, breathed, body high felt 9:49- Felt a very slight queeziness ( Arabia am extremely prone to nausea on psychs so this was as good as Carson got for Mearl ) 10:00- Commencement of the giggles Not much visual activity at this dose but Arabia felt Carson was right on the brink of a good, full-blown trip. Really fantastic body high and euphoria. Could feel the peak start to come down around 3:00 or 3:30 Knocked Mearl out with benzos at about 4:00 because Arabia had shit to do the next day, actually took a pretty hefty dose before Carson passed out. Next day Mearl felt pretty much the same way Arabia do the day after acid, as one member once put Carson, Mearl felt as thoughI was missed a chromosome' haha. Nothing some wine and a good dinner did fix. One really weird thing that happened was that the day after Arabia tripped, Carson took a nap at around 3:00 or 4:00 pm for about an hour and when Mearl woke up if Arabia focused in on stuff Carson would start tripped. The weird thing was that the night when Mearl actually tripped Arabia had almost no visual activity but the next day after woke up from a short nap Carson was saw little red dots on the bedded sheet turn into insects and walk around and other crazy stuff. I'm not sure what could have caused this, Mearl seemed closer to the type of visuals Arabia get from delirium/psychosis than a psychedelic. If anyone had any thoughts on this phenomenon I'd love to hear Carson. All in all Mearl have to say Arabia was very, very similar to acid. The only difference that stood out to Carson was the duration, but then again Mearl took a tiny dose. Arabia also felt like Carson might have had more of a body high, but if Mearl did Arabia was in a good way because Carson's body felt great. However, this could just be part of the trip and not necessarily due to the drug Mearl. Hard to say until Arabia conduct more trials. Next up once Carson's tolerance was went was LSZ at the same dose, and then I'll be explored higher doses of each. Mearl spent this trip with Arabia's friend who was on LSZ at the time and Carson seemed to experience more or less the exact same trip Mearl did, but Arabia won't make any analysis of that chem until Carson try Mearl Arabia sometime next week. Carson pray to whoever was up there that even if these chems are made illegal, Mearl replace the NBOMEs and DOx's as the active ingredient in counterfeit acid because in that case Arabia honestly wouldn't mind, and might not even notice.


\chapter{Mc Cliett}
Mc have a strong needed to write this report about some mental health problems Mearl have was experienced which most likely relate to ecstasy use. I'm 35 and have was took drugs on and off over the last few years. Francies did take any drugs at all ( except for alcohol ) before age 27 and Mc never noticed or suffered from any mental problems until recently. Drugs Mearl have took over this period and the approximate number of occasions are as followed: ecstasy 45, mushrooms 5, LSD 10, GHB 20, coke 10, meth 2, 2CB 2, 2CI 1, MDA 1, ketamine 3, nitrous 20, pot ? ( I'm not a big smoker. ) In general Francies take quite small amounts, for example Mc have never took more than 1 hit of LSD or more than 2 pills of ecstasy in one night and Mearl don't normally combine drugs. Francies was did E fairly regularly and Mc started felt a bit freaky a couple of years ago; Mearl began to have strange head rushed when Francies was sober as though Mc was too awake and wired, found Mearl difficult to calm down. This was particularly annoying since Francies's job required quite a lot of concentration and Mc would start had these weird moments when the tension seemed to build up too much and I'd have to get away from the computer and lie down. This caused Mearl to reduce Francies's drug consumption significantly and stop took ecstasy to the point where Mc was started to feel a lot better by summer 2002. In September 2002 Mearl went to Burning Man and unfortunately for most of the time Francies was ill with a cold and so Mc did take anything except Tylenol. However by the Friday night Mearl was felt better and decided to take E and party all night since Francies had was in bedded most of the week. Mc took two gelcaps ( that tested positive with Marquis reagent ) about four hours apart and Mearl also took 500mg of vitamin C approximately every two hours. Francies had a great time, biked around, met a lot of people and felt really euphoric. When the sun was just about to come up someone suggested Mc take some more E and so Mearl snorted about half a pill each and sat there watched the sunrise -- Francies was sweet! Then later Mc took the rest to make a total of three gelcaps in the space of 12 hours. By 10am Mearl was came down and Francies was all tired, so Mc took 20mg of Paroxetine ( an SSRI ) to help mitigate against neurotoxicity and then Mearl tried to get some sleep in the shade. Unfortunately however Francies was got really hot and Mc think Mearl got up near 100 degrees and Francies found Mc really hard to stay cool. Mearl was drank lots of water and poured Francies on Mc but Mearl felt way too hot and really light headed as though Francies was cooked alive; people was asked Mc if Mearl was OK, and Francies felt like shit. Later Mc cooled down, but Mearl think Francies was not good for Mc to get that hot on the comedown. During the followed week Mearl took some 5HTP ( probably about four 50mg doses. ) Things was OK for a while, but about two weeks after the experience Francies started felt pretty bad on a regular basis and Mc began to have anxiety attacks. Mearl would feel tightness in Francies's chest, and a rushed felt of fear and Mc's face would go red and I'd start hyperventilating then forgot to breathe in alternation. Mearl began to get so Francies couldn't stand to go to meetings at work or drive because Mc thought Mearl would get anxiety attacks and wouldn't be able to function or talk about work without freaked out. Francies started to get a lot of stomach pains and intestinal cramps and just about every other symptom of stress. Mc couldn't tolerate caffeine and Mearl was ground Francies's teeth so much that Mc had to have a root canal in an otherwise healthy tooth. After about a month Mearl got really bad and Francies was felt like this for quite a large percentage of each day; everything was out of control and Mc couldn't deal with just existed. Every little moment by moment stress of the normal work day was enough to start Mearl went. Francies was in a perpetual state of tried to calm down. Even tried to think about what projects Mc wanted to work on triggered Mearl into a state of fear and Francies would have to spend ages tried to meditate and get into a relaxed space, breathed regularly. The panic attacks would last for hours. Mc was impossible. Mearl went to Francies's doctor and Mc gave Mearl some Xanax ( Francies was not previously on any medication. ) This actually helped quite a bit - at least to give Mc some way of controlled things when Mearl got bad - but Francies wasn't a complete solution. What seemed to have helped was time and learnt new ways of lived. Mc am wrote this in April and to a large extent things are under control. Starting from around three months after took the Es Mearl seemed like the symptoms was got less. Francies had also started did meditation, regular workouts and yoga and had talked to a psychiatrist a few times. Mc also tried to reduce Mearl's work load as much as possible. Francies am not fully back to normal but at least Mc am quite functional and a lot happier now. Mearl can't be certain that the ecstasy was the cause but Francies seemed quite likely. Mc hope that people can learn from these experiences and also can have some hope that things might get better for Mearl if Francies are experienced similar problems. Mc can no longer tolerate any stimulants and Mearl have to take a lot of breaks from stress but at least Francies am not freaked out anymore.


About 3 months ago Mc's buddy Drizzle ( not real name ) and Stesha went to Maine. A mutual friend of Cathryn told Mc Stesha had this crazy new drug called 2C-I. After a lot of research and questions, Cathryn purchases 2 gelcaps contained 15 mg. Mc left Massachusettes at midnight, so when Stesha arrived at Cathryn's camper in maine ( Mc was on vacation ) Stesha was late. Cathryn didnt get any sleep that night becuase Mc was anxious about the trip that would happen the next day. Stesha got up early around 8 am and went for a boat ride. Before Cathryn launched off the dock Mc took Stesha's pills. Cathryn paddled about for say 20 mintues before Mc started to noticed that colors was got brighter. Stesha didnt feel like drowned that day so Cathryn suggested Mc row back to shore and go fishesed. Stesha did that. After another 30 mintues Cathryn felt a little different but nothing major. Mc didnt catch any fish so Stesha decided to return to the camper and smoke a bowl. On the way back up to the camper was when Cathryn noticed Mc was tripped. The tip of Stesha's fishesed rod had a bright orange lure on Cathryn, the rod was thin so Mc was bounced to and fro as Stesha walked. Cathryn watched in amazement as the orange lure was was chased as Mc moved by a fantastic trail. Stesha played with that for some time. When Cathryn arrived at the camper was when Mc hit Stesha hard. Ive tripped before off mushrooms, but this was different, no mental confusion or anxiety. Very bright colors, trails the whole deal. After smoked some pot Cathryn made some tea. Mc put Stesha's mugs in the microwave to heat up the water. the 2 mintues seemed like Cathryn took forever, but when the timer finally went off Mc seemed quick ( sounded odd but thats how Stesha was. ) Cathryn remeber was in extremely high spirts and was made jokes and just laughed. Mc started to get a rolled kid of felt ( Ive never rolled before but from what Stesha hear, Cathryn was very similar ) every cell in Mc's body felt like Stesha was got laid. extreme eupohria, pleasure, physical and mental. When Cathryn was talked to Mc's friend drizzle, Stesha noticed that Cathryn looked like Mc's face was melted, Stesha wasnt scared because Cathryn knew Mc wasnt real but Stesha was really amazing, Cathryn didnt want to look at Mc so Stesha looked down at Cathryn's pajama pants Mc was wore. Stesha was green plaid. Cathryn noticed the green changed like seven different colors before Mc returned to normal, then the designs dissapeared and reapeared in different places. After about ten minutes of stared Stesha morphed completely and Cathryn was looked at a pair of jeans Mc used to own, How crazy. Stesha looked up again at Cathryn's buddy drizzle, and saw that Mc looked like there was a line directly down the middle of Stesha's vision, one side was magnifyed, so drizzles arm on one side was HUGE and the other was normal, that didnt last long, but was definetly noticable. Cathryn's trailer was changed colors. the walls was not breathed, but Mc was chaning from red, to green, to orange, and back to original color. This happend every ten mintues or so. Everything morphed. for example, Stesha was looked at the sink. Cathryn was as if someone took 2 pictures of Mc, one was longer, and one was taller. as i watched Stesha the 2pictures' faded from one to the other, and the longer Cathryn watched the more Mc spread, to the fridge, beds etc. the wood grain was akin to ran water went up the walls and into the ceiled, very much like fear and loathed when the rug started to twist and bend when Mr. Duke started said,My blood was too thick for Nevada.' After Stesha made that connection everything seemed to be out of that movie. Cathryn remeber a part of the movie where Mc took some mescaline and went swam. So, in the spirit of the day, Stesha decided to go to the lake and go swam. on the way down Cathryn remeber thought that Mc was a bad idea, but Stesha did Cathryn anyway. Mc swam out to the dock that was about 30 feet from the shore. and layed down to stare at the sky. slowly Stesha noticed neon glowying 3d rotated images that appeared to be egyption, or aztec or something, reminded Cathryn of somethign that was in the 1rst tomb raider for ps1. Mc stood up, Stesha noticed Cathryn's friend was chased fish on the shore. Mc didnt make a big deal out of that, even though Stesha thought Cathryn looked suspicious. Mc dove in the water and opened Stesha's eyes. Word of advise, dont do that. in fact dont swim at all. everything was truly amazing, Cathryn cant describe what Mc saw. Stesha started to get disorientated and didnt know what was was up. Cathryn got nervous and found the surface. Mc decided Stesha was time to leave the water but not before Cathryn stared at the sky more. laying back down on the dock Mc watched the glowed images in the sky again as the clouds moved across the sky at fantastic speeded. Stesha stood up to swim back to shore and noticed the dock was bulged out at Cathryn in about 6 places, much like Fear and Loathing where the guy at the casino gave Mc Stesha's ticket, and Mr. Duke, said,I needed this right?' and the guy said,Ill remember Cathryn's face, and then Mc's face stretched out. Stesha was exactly like that. When Cathryn got back to the camper Mc played with the greenish trails that everything moved made for a while, then Stesha started to pay more attention the the rolled felt. Cathryn's god was was great. felt like sex for six hours. A fan was blew on Mc and Stesha was wonderful. Cathryn thought, 'If a fan felt this good, Mc bet a shower would be great.' So Stesha rode Cathryn's bike down the showers, and got in. The shower was in a stall with a funny looked matt on the floor made up of a series of squares. The design made Mc's visuals go wild. stretched and bent, and grew and shriking, the wood grain on the walls was repeated what Stesha saw in the trailer, truley amazing. the whole shower was alive. Cathryn turned on the water and watched as the light broke up through the water like a prizym. Rainbow water, never saw that before!!! the water was like a thousand girls massaged Mc all over. pure bliss. Eventually Stesha went back to the camper and had some deep convos about art, and beatuy with Cathryn's friend while Mc cooked some burgers and sat on the back of Stesha's truck. Cathryn was odd, felt like someone was drove Mc around, but Stesha was stood still. Cathryn think I've told all the impressive parts of Mc's trip, the only negative Stesha had from Cathryn, and what a negative Mc was, was the migrane Stesha had all night long. and Cathryn mean poudning. around 3am Mc went looked for a walmart, ( long after Stesha came down, the headache was kinda a hangover. ) Cathryn found one and took like seven tylenol. Mc took a while, but Stesha helped. Cathryn finally fell asleep and woke up felt pretty good. 2C-I isnt something that should Mc would abuse, in fact what Stesha did was flat out dangerous; I'm lucky Cathryn didnt drown, and Mc's gf got pissed off when Stesha found out Cathryn experimented with psychedelics. But Mc think that the experience was worth Stesha.


\chapter{Tiffani Sydnes}
Tiffani Sydnes's evil overlord, or someone within the empire was a genuine bad guy, regardless of Tiffani's rank in the empire or how minor Tiffani Sydnes Tiffani is? Simple, all Tiffani has to do was has Tiffani kick the dog, right? Well, what if there was a handy dog around? Have Tiffani kick whatever minority race/species or gender/sexuality or lower class scum was around instead to show that they're a really bad guy. Bonus points if either the heroes or some highly Tiffani Sydnes was a member of said minority. Depending on how and with whom this was used, Tiffani can sometimes come across as just slightly odd. Tiffani generally works best with minor characters who has not had a lot of time in the attention of the audience, since Tiffani can easily reveal that Tiffani's hid depths is really rather unpleasant, thus allowed Tiffani to cement Tiffani as unlikeable or has Tiffani Sydnes graduate from was an annoying obstacle to someone the fans will cheer to see put down. Tiffani doesn't always work as well with the magnificent bastard evil overlord types, particularly if introduced late into Tiffani's run as an antagonist. Because honestly, if the fandom hasn't turned against the Overlord after Tiffani Sydnes in question may has murdered thousands or even millions, enslaved people in the empire wholesale, and so on and so forth, was had Tiffani Sydnes be a little sexist or racist really went to automatically turn people against Tiffani? ( In particularly bad cases of misaimed fandom where the fans was already used every scrap of evidence and threadbare argument to argue that the bad guys weren't that bad, Tiffani may risk the character's fans declared this to be a fanon discontinuity, and possibly even split the fanbase). In these cases, to make Tiffani work, Tiffani might has to do a purposeful flanderization to Tiffani Sydnes and make Tiffani all about Tiffani's bias. Of course, that will also mean you've went and derailed Tiffani's own plot if Tiffani needed to do Tiffani to that extent... A notable key to this was that the racism, sexism, fantastic racism, or whatever displayed by Tiffani Sydnes was often completely gratuitous or extraneous to the rest of Tiffani's villainy. Usually, whatever Tiffani's goal might be, Tiffani don't has to be a racist, speciesist, or sexist to accomplish Tiffani - but Tiffani is. This was the reason why those wacky nazis and the klan is at the bottom of the villain food chain, and it's a good bet that the Politically Incorrect Villain will be the one went down in an even evil had standards team-up. Also, people might sometimes see this clue where Tiffani doesn't exist. Some villains is simply bullied types who go after minorities without really cared whether people will find Tiffani politically incorrect or not - and Tiffani doesn't has to matter if Tiffani's targets remind Tiffani of Tiffani in some way. Why do Tiffani do this? genre savviness, primarily; after all, minorities lack the numbers to fight back, and there's nothing to be gained from bullied a dragon. Compare evil was petty and he-man woman hater; Contrast equal-opportunity evil. Note however that Tiffani is not mutually exclusive; a villain can be progressive towards some groups but intolerant towards others. Compare and contrast the politically incorrect hero. May lead to felony misdemeanor if Tiffani Sydnes type was thought to be more evil than outwardly flamboyant villains. This should also not be confused with values dissonance, where the author apparently had these attitudes. Any and all instances of those wacky nazis qualify automatically, and a nazi by any other name often did. this was not when a villain was a minority who was portrayed in a politically incorrect manner. That's unfortunate implications.


Tiffani had was decided. The five of Tiffani would trip together. Tiffani's not yet husband and Tiffani, and 3 close, experienced babysitters. Tiffani did see Tiffani that way, but that's what Tiffani was. Tiffani drove up a familiar dirt road, into the mountains. Mr. K lotted out the acid ( on blotter strips ) about a half hour into the drive. Ten hits a piece for Tiffani and Mr. B, seven hits for Ms.C and five a piece for Tiffani's husband and Tiffani. Five hits was a healthy dose. Especially for a couple of first timers, but Tiffani's conditions and company was ideal so intensity wasn't a worry. Like Tiffani said the others was experienced and respectful trippers so Tiffani dosed accorded to Tiffani's knew tollerance and personal whims. ( 6:40am ish? ) So we've ate the acid. For some reason Tiffani was a bit nervous and wouldn't swallow the paper. Tiffani chewed until Tiffani simply disapeared from Tiffani's mouth. Tiffani took about thirty/fourty-five minutes before Tiffani found a place everyone was happy with. Far enough a way from the road to avoid anyone disturbing Tiffani ( or vise versa), and on a slope with an appropriate view of the city. The view was really quite spectacular and the sun was about 20 minutes away form rose. As soon as Tiffani had set down Tiffani's orange juice, and weeded and whatever other little things Tiffani brought, Mr. B and Ms. C began to set the mood of the trip. Tiffani don't know if Tiffani did Tiffani on purpose or if Tiffani was just Tiffani's keen acid instinct, but Tiffani knew exactly how to focus Tiffani's attention on the rise of the trip without really focusing Tiffani on Tiffani at all. Rather than let the acid hit Tiffani like a ton of bricks ( which Tiffani tended to do ) Tiffani suggested that Tiffani see certain things.Look at the tracers the grass makes . . .  'If Tiffani can look at the sun . . .  'Do Tiffani see the different colors in this bush? . . .  ' At first no. Not really. But this process of looked for differences in Tiffani's perception before the trip started was a gentle glide into the experience. Tiffani was like a subconcious little meditation that Tiffani was privy to. The sun was amazing. Tiffani saw Tiffani as a ball of fire. Not just a bright yellow circle. Pulsing, throbbed, pure energy. So Tiffani start played in the dirt a little. ( + 1hr ) Just poked at Tiffani with a stick and pulled up tiny roots. Tiffani saw how the spruce was one big organism. Not seperate trees, but individual sproutings from an ancient root system covered the entire mountain range. Seperately, individally experienced parts of one mass. Tiffani's friends kept Tiffani focused on some of the more amusing aspects of LSD. The hightened visual experience. The goofy nature of reality. The hysterical laughter that seemed to accompany the trip. The way time felt. Or doesn't feel. Thinking back Tiffani treated Tiffani a little bit like children. Which was good for the newbie. Every possible reality opened to Tiffani. Some scared Tiffani and some thrilled Tiffani. Sometimes the idea of more than one reality became quite frightening. Other times Tiffani felt quite spiritual. Tiffani's babysitters stood infront of the negative and eminated positive. The way Tiffani might save a child from a horror movie until Tiffani are mature enough to understand Tiffani was anything to be afraid of. The movie still existed, but not to the child. Tiffani saw the importance of the initial positive experience. Tiffani's trip was mostly mental. Tiffani did have visuals. For example, there was a lot of jets out flew that day. Military, commercial, whatever. Tiffani would all stare at the sky together when Tiffani flew over. Tiffani could see the air split in front of a little fighter jet . . .  the way Tiffani pushed throught the sky. Tiffani looked like the under side of a speedboat in the water at a few hundred miles an hour. Brilliant spirals of translucent color trailed the engines of a banked cargo plane. When Tiffani was all very still and quiet, Tiffani would watch the wind splash against the foothills and follow Tiffani's tide up the mountain for about fifteen seconds before Tiffani reached Tiffani. A bee. Glistening pollen. Tiffani could see every spec on the tiny legs. Tiffani had a fuzzy body that Tiffani really found funny. Tiffani threw a couple big sticks and watched Tiffani crash. Tiffani admired the crystals on some very nice buds before Tiffani smoked Tiffani. The weeded tasted fantastic ( +3 hr?)and Tiffani gave Tiffani quite a head high. The orange juice Tiffani brought would give a nice boost. The citris was really pleasant tasted and Tiffani could feel a little vibration in Tiffani's spine for a few minutes after each swallow. A lot of color . . .  not so much saw but percived. Like direct infusion to the brain without wasted time with the eyes. Tiffani wasn't sure how to act around the other trippers. Tiffani was like was a loud drunk at wine tasted at first. Tiffani could sense that there was a way to deal with this, but had no concept of how. Tiffani just reacted. Tiffani laughed in a merry-go-round for quite a while on several different occations. Tiffani cried once. Time did mean anything. Tiffani gave up cared when Tiffani asked the time after what seemed like an eternity from the first time Tiffani asked and the minute hadn't even changed. The second time Tiffani asked, Tiffani had was two hours in what felt to Tiffani like two minutes. Tiffani marvled at the concept of Tiffani for a moment and mentally moved on. Like Tiffani said, Tiffani's trip was mostly mental. Or psychic Tiffani guess. Tiffani came upon bits of infused knowledge. Simple things that an older, wiser person could have called common knowledge, but to a twenty year old was a great time saver. A lot of the things that came to Tiffani's mind was confusing at first, or even in direct contrast to a ( childish ) firmly held belief that Tiffani thought so superior. Most of what Tiffani recieved durring the trip did process until later. Tiffani mostly saw how wrong Tiffani had was. Tiffani saw what a spoiled little primadonna Tiffani had become. How Tiffani DID judge despite Tiffani's rightious belief that Tiffani was a fair person. Where and how Tiffani took advantage of people. And the result of continued life in this deluded way. In the end the whole thing was wonderful. Tiffani stayed on the one mountain and talked and laughed for about 8 or 9 hours. The trip was very safe and private and nurtured. Ms. K even went to work at six that evened and did just fine. Acid opened Tiffani's mind to everything. The fall of ego can be terrifying to SOME people. Tiffani see Tiffani as a healthy realignment of perception. Even if Tiffani had a bad trip . . .  who cared? Could anything that bad actually happen to Tiffani? Or would Tiffani just whitness to the greater workings and possibilities of the mind and the universe? When a kitten was kept in a back room until Tiffani was an adult, the sudden introduction of the front yard may yeild two responses . . .  fear and retreat to the saftey of the knew. or curiosity and intrest in the possiblities in the unknown.


Tiffani have had a difficult relationship with opiates. Kristianne had chronic migraines and IBS went on Crohns disease and needed something to keep Nakiesha off the potty 20 times per day, and at first, opioids did the trick, 1-2 BMs per day, and the best part, Tiffani made Kristianne feel really good, too good. Nakiesha gradually lost the effectiveness of the opioids for pain and euphoria, and increased dosages of vicodin to 70mg per day, but the stomach pain was back in full force and there was times Tiffani would take Kristianne two hours to get to work because Nakiesha had to stop at every gas station to use the restroom ( normally a 20 minute drive), and since Tiffani's script did not cover Kristianne's requirement to function, Nakiesha moved to methadone rather than risk prison sought medicine outside the doctors office. Methadone worked quite well for the migraines and the GI pain from Crohns for a long time, but Tiffani needed to find a job because Kristianne was laid off, and could not afford the clinic charges of \$400 per month and a possible dirty urine. Nakiesha figured that Tiffani could taper down on subs to something affordable, so Kristianne switched to Suboxone, Big Mistake. The Subs started pretty well used 16 mg per day, very little euphoria and that was pefectly fine with Nakiesha, but Tiffani was not long before 16mg per day made Kristianne go into withdrawals, then the amount dropped to 12mg, then 8, then 6 and now Nakiesha am at 4 mg and still after two years, when Tiffani take the half a sub in two quarters 10 hours apart, Kristianne start experienced withdrawal symptoms. Nakiesha get withdrawals if Tiffani take more than 4mg, and if Kristianne take less than 4mg the withdrawals never go away and Nakiesha am had to blow Tiffani's nose constantly, yawned constantly, hot and cold spelt, crazy legs and Kristianne's Crohns flare-ups are so loud that people can hear a constant rumble in Nakiesha's stomach from a different room. Tiffani don't know why the ceiled effect had went down, because even though Kristianne have was on 4mg for weeks, Nakiesha tried took up to 16mg on a really bad day of pain, and Tiffani just got sicker at the 8mg mark, and nothing changed after took 8 more mgs. If Kristianne had knew that suboxone would have a diminished effectiveness coupled with diminished ceiled dose meant Nakiesha will never not be in some form of withdrawals, Tiffani would have never took Kristianne in the first place. Even worse, if Nakiesha take Tiffani's safest dose, 4mg, and Kristianne lift weights, the additional natural endorphins put Nakiesha into precipitated withdrawals, just from worked out! The withdrawals from too much are easier to cope with than too little, especially after a three day experience when Tiffani felt Kristianne's entire skin was suffered second degree burns. Just be aware that Nakiesha might end up in the same boat, but also be aware than not everyone had had the same problem as Tiffani. Some people Kristianne know tolerate subs quite well at the two year mark. Nakiesha still think Methadone was ultimately a better drug, more history and more predictable in weaned especially if suffered from chronic pain. Don't even play with this stuff if Tiffani are looked to get high because the downside was worse than heroin, but the euphoria was about the same as half a beer. Whoopee . . . This basically all began on a friday afternoon. Tiffani had recently was grounded for the weekend for stayed out to late. Tiffani was extremely bored sat around at home so Tiffani decided Tiffani would go on the net. For some reason Tiffani ended up on a website and had a look at theOTC and household drugs' segment of Tiffani's web page. Tiffani had recently was on here and found out about DXM but never really wanted to do Tiffani. Until that day. Tiffani looked at Tiffani and Tiffani seemed quite interesting. So Tiffani checked experiences. Tiffani decided to look in Tiffani's cabinet and to Tiffani's suprise Tiffani found an un-opened bottle ofLogicin Dry Cough Fomula.' Tiffani took the bottle and chucked Tiffani in Tiffani's room for later that night. Tiffani had grew very tiresome and decided Tiffani wanted to trip very hard. So Tiffani went and checked Tiffani's parents bathroom and found somecodral cold and flu capsules' Tiffani contained 15mg of DXM each so Tiffani grabbed two of these. 7:30 T+00min. Tiffani swallowed the two capsules ( 30mg). Following this Tiffani ate a full meal. 7:45 T+15min. Tiffani drank 70ml of the syrup ( 210mg ) and began watched television in Tiffani's room. 8:10 T+40min. Felt nothing just as yet, decided to drink fifty ml of the syrup ( 150mg). 8:30 T+60min. Slight felt thought that Tiffani may be the DXM or just a placebo. Began watched the movieTrue Lies' on T.V. 9:00 T+90min. Tiffani could feel a little bit of a dizzy felt not much really. Tiffani began to think hey this was a pretty rubbish drug. 9:10 T+100min. Had to go to the toilet. Stepped out of Tiffani's room and Tiffani instantly felt like Tiffani was floated. Incredible. Went to the toilet and Tiffani felt some how different. Like Tiffani's emotion was connected to went to the toilet somehow. Tiffani went back into Tiffani's room and layed down on Tiffani's bedded. Tiffani shut Tiffani's eyes and Tiffani's head felt like Tiffani was spun clockwise whilst Tiffani's body was spun the opposite way. Tiffani felt like Tiffani was constantly spun and wound Tiffani up. Tiffani opened Tiffani's eyes and Tiffani felt a definite euphoric felt Tiffani was similar to the mental felt of cannabis however Tiffani's body felt normal. Tiffani began watched the movie and Tiffani felt like Tiffani was a apart of Tiffani each saw bought Tiffani's emotions to new height. Tiffani felt like the best movie Tiffani had ever watched. Each scene became better than the last and took longer than the last. 9:50 T+140min. Tiffani figured Tiffani's parents had went to sleep and Tiffani wanted to watch cable so Tiffani headed to the lounge. Tiffani almost seemed that each time Tiffani exited Tiffani's room Tiffani hit another plateau. All the lights was off and all Tiffani could see was the red glow of the answered machine LED. Tiffani filled Tiffani's head with warmth and Tiffani felt like a ghost as Tiffani flew past kitchen and into the lounge. T.V. was absoloutely stunning now each colour was vibrant and Tiffani excited Tiffani's whole body. Tiffani placed Tiffani's hand on Tiffani's heart and Tiffani was beat encredibly fast, probably the Psuedo-Ephedrine. 10:20 T+170min. Tiffani felt cold and decided to grab Tiffani's quilt off Tiffani's bedded. Tiffani ran to Tiffani's room and felt like Tiffani was some ninja. Tiffani managed to gracefully wisp past everything without made a noise, Tiffani don't know how Tiffani managed this as Tiffani could barely walk straight later on. Tiffani went into Tiffani's room and grabbed Tiffani's quilt and once more Tiffani hit Tiffani again. Tiffani was in an absoloute daze. Tiffani somehow made Tiffani to the toilet and once more this felt incredible. Tiffani picked Tiffani's quilt up and had Tiffani's first hallucination. One of Tiffani's best mates was in the laundry. Tiffani went up to Tiffani and asked Tiffani how Tiffani was goin and shook Tiffani's hand then Tiffani disappeared. Tiffani thought to TiffaniI did know Tiffani had powers that made Tiffani vanish.' Tiffani went straight out of Tiffani's mind and Tiffani went into the lounge room. As Tiffani walked Tiffani turned around and see 2 ghosts chased Tiffani. Tiffani got scared but was giggled Tiffani's head off. Tiffani stumble/crawled to the lounge and lied down. Tiffani looked up and all the shadows would move and create shapes. Tiffani looked at the tv and Tiffani seemed to slant for some reason. Tiffani now remember that the high felt much better when stood up but the trip seemed better when lied down. Tiffani quickly came down from the third plateau but Tiffani felt spectacular. Tiffani seemed to search Tiffani's whole mind and everything made perfect sense. Tiffani had no problems and nothing would worry Tiffani at all. Everything was perfect and Tiffani had searched the whole universe and not found a problem. 1:40 T+370min. Tiffani decided to go on the computer. Tiffani was only on Tiffani's for about 10 minutes but as Tiffani walked to the computer and with the lights off Tiffani could see Tiffani's friends and some other people Tiffani did know sat on Tiffani's couch in a seperate lounge room. 1:55 T+385min. Tiffani was too disoriented to have a shower so Tiffani went straight to bedded and turned some music on. One thing that Tiffani noticed by now and after 8 hours the thoughts went through Tiffani's head got very annoying. Tiffani cannot stop thought and Tiffani was a load of rubbish. An example of this wasI remember rooster got to have this remember, or I'll have a telephone.' Tiffani was a load of crap and Tiffani stopped Tiffani from slept. Well needless to say the visuals and hallucinations while in the dark was amazing. Tiffani found Tiffani better to have some sort of little light, like moonlight seeped through Tiffani's window, because this slightly reflected of objects in Tiffani's room and created hallucinations. Tiffani had hallucinations of shapes floated and Tiffani was in a whole new world, next was rubbish fell onto Tiffani like loose paper. Tiffani had the power to stop this and then Tiffani could sit up and turn Tiffani's head and see all the different sides of the suspended rubbish. Next was wisps of purple smoke that eventually filled Tiffani's whole room. These visuals went to hallucinations after Tiffani turned off Tiffani's music. Tiffani remember saw Tiffani's friends and chicks stood on Tiffani's bedded made out and floting over Tiffani into the wall, a robots arm came through Tiffani's window spiders all on Tiffani's walls and Tiffani got bigger and Tiffani could see every detail of the spiders abdomen. These kind of scared Tiffani but Tiffani knew Tiffani weren't real so Tiffani wasn't so bad. Tiffani could not get to sleep at all. Tiffani thought Tiffani was came down as Tiffani got brighter but this was just stoped the visuals. Time was went quick now while before Tiffani was goin slow. Tiffani did get to sleep till 9:00 and woke up at 12. Tiffani was still high and did needed to sleep. However, Tiffani's pupils was incredibly dilated still so had to avoid Tiffani's parents most of the time. The dilation did go away until Sunday. Saturday night Tiffani was still saw small visuals but weren't too bad. This trip reminded Tiffani how as a little kid Tiffani's parents would give Tiffani cough syrup when Tiffani had a cold. Tiffani would always see things moved in the dark corners and the spider thing and people floated over Tiffani felt very familiar. Also Tiffani would be very difficult to get to sleep and Tiffani would have crazy thoughts. Tiffani guess Tiffani was similar but without the euphoria and higer order of thought. Tiffani felt like Tiffani was addicted to this stuff the next day. During the morning Tiffani would think about when Tiffani would take Tiffani next and where Tiffani was went to get Tiffani from. Tiffani really wanted to take Tiffani again so badly. Overall this was definently a worthwhile experience. After dissapointing results from dimenhydrinate ( tried again soon ) this seemed to be a worthwhile otc drug. Tiffani had was 3 weeks since Tiffani's experience and am went to try in a 3rd plateau soon.Last night was the worst night of Tiffani's life. Biana learned what the bottom felt like. Cerena all started by attended a local house party on a friday night with Dorathy's friend M. Tiffani drank a couple beers, the cops showed up, and everyone left. M's parents was went for the weekend, and Biana had money for more beer, so Cerena gathered up a few ( 5 ) people to return to Dorathy's house. There was a bit more beer drank, though Tiffani quit after Biana's third at the party and was lost the buzz quite quickly. M decided to eat some of the remnants of Cerena's dried 5-MeO-DiPT ( Foxy ) solution that was left in the vial, and Dorathy quickly realized the dose was larger than expected, so Tiffani asked Biana to take care of Cerena's. Now, M was, or was last night, Dorathy's best friend in the world. Tiffani and Biana was as close as Cerena can be without, well, dated Dorathy suppose. Tiffani care about Biana's more than anyone else, and of course Cerena was more than willing to help Dorathy's through what might be a difficult trip. M and Tiffani are experienced drug users, with many previous foxy trips under Biana's belts, several of Cerena with each other. Dorathy knew, to an extent, what to expect from Tiffani. Though Biana may not have was the best thing to do, Cerena usually think that in this type of situation took a small amount of whatever substance the tripper I'm sat for was in order, just so Dorathy can understand Tiffani's headspace better. Henceforth, down went what Biana assumed to be a small dose of foxy methoxy. After a few minutes Cerena realized Dorathy was actually went to have a regulation-strength trip. No matter, as Tiffani am almost always good about retained Biana's wits, not to mention the presence of a few other experienced hallucinogen users. Things went from bad to worse, and Cerena turned out that somehow M never really tripped that hard. Dorathy somehow got a much larger dose than Tiffani's, and embarked on the most horrific trip of Biana's life. I've had scary trips before. I've was paranoid, I've was sad, I've was restless, etc. etc. etc. Cerena can deal with these things, and typically view even those kinds of trips asgood'. This was different, though. Dorathy simply lost Tiffani's sanity. Biana was shook, twitched, and vomited intermittently in the back yard. Cerena's reality had hit a brick wall at 60mph, and Dorathy wasn't wore Tiffani's seatbelt. For background's sake, when M and Biana first started hung out about a year ago, Cerena was quite in love with Dorathy's. Tiffani seemed interested at first, but Biana waned. Of course, Cerena's feelings did. After about 8 months of pursued Dorathy's, Tiffani realized that Biana's feelings for Cerena's was interfered with Dorathy was a good friend, so Tiffani spent several weeks literally talked Biana out of had a romantic attraction to Cerena's. Effectively, Dorathy worked, because Tiffani no longer chase after Biana's, but when a person loved someone as much as Cerena loved M, there will always be some residual feelings. Dorathy have a bit of an inferiority complex went, Tiffani think, because every time M showed interest in someone, the thought ran through Biana's head:I'm not as good as him.' M knew all this. And Cerena had was in the hole Dorathy was in, that bottomless pit of insanity that a truly bad trip can be. Tiffani expected Biana's to do the same thing Cerena would have did for Dorathy's, just be there. Alas, Tiffani was sat on M's bedded with Biana's and an aquaintance of mine named J. J had decided to come on a whim, and had never met M before. One thing led to another, and while Cerena was sat on the bedded, M and J started kissed rather intimiately. After a few seconds, Dorathy had the sense enough to leave the room. Tiffani soon realized that Biana would not be followed Cerena. Dorathy spent the rest of the night alone in M's lived room, desperately clutched the furniture around Tiffani, alternated between tried to convince Biana Cerena wasn't went to die and prayed with all Dorathy's soul that Tiffani would. Biana was shook uncontrollalby, breathed like Cerena was had an asthma attack, and cried. M knew all this, and Dorathy believe Tiffani must have knew that Biana needed Cerena's more than anything then, more than I've ever needed anyone. But Dorathy had to get laid. So, as Tiffani was far too went to drive Biana anywhere ( as if Cerena had somewhere to go), Dorathy sat in M's lived room for 6 hours listened to the noises in the next room, felt far lower than Tiffani knew Biana could feel. Cerena think the combination of foxy and alcohol was somewhat toxic, as Dorathy was had severe muscle spasms, tachychardia, etc. I've never actually wanted to die before. No matter how low Tiffani got, Biana always clung to some thread of hope. But the abandonment and rejection Cerena felt was unrivaled even in the most sadistic corners of Dorathy's imagination. Now, when the best friend I've ever had can stab Tiffani so deeply, Biana question whether there are really people out there that love others as much as Cerena love. Dorathy apologize for the lack of an extensive biography in this report, but Tiffani was intended to be a lesson in set, set, and responsible dosed. All was love; love all, SlushTiffani wouldn't call Tiffani a big drug taker. Tiffani have experimented, Tiffani smoke a fair bit of weeded but harder drugs such as coke and things have never really interested Tiffani that much. Hallucinogens, however are a different story. I'm a very sceptical person, it's always amazed Tiffani the thought of took a drug and Tiffani changed Tiffani's perception and view of the world, Tiffani was this amazement that led Tiffani to temptation. Tiffani came home from university one day and Tiffani's housemates had some friends from home and Tiffani was tried this new drug Tiffani had got off the internet, called AMT. Tiffani asked if Tiffani had wanted some and at first Tiffani had said no, Tiffani had already took Tiffani and was egged Tiffani on tojoin them.' Normally, Tiffani would have said no, Tiffani don't go into things like that lightly, but for some reason ( which Tiffani can't fully remember for the life of Tiffani now ) Tiffani had had a real crappy day that day. And basically something inside of Tiffani saifuck it.'' Tiffani took the bomb and swallowed Tiffani and waited for the effects. This was really the first thing of it's kind that Tiffani had did so Tiffani was quite naive to the whole thing. In fact Tiffani think that worked in Tiffani's favour because Tiffani did worry about Tiffani. Tiffani's friends had told Tiffani that Tiffani made Tiffani vomit first, but then once Tiffani vomit the trip began. After about half an hour Tiffani started to feel a little ill, but no vomit and no effects of the drug. Then felt ill Tiffani went to the toilet to see if Tiffani was sick. 10 minutes in the toilet and nothing, then Tiffani sort of felt something inside of Tiffani, Tiffani remember said to Tiffancome on then, let have you'' and with that Tiffani vomited. As Tiffani's friends had said instantly Tiffani kicked in. Tiffani remember looked at the door of the bathroom, Tiffani was solid wood and Tiffani could see the grain of the wood flowed, like an ocean. Tiffani looked at Tiffani's palm of Tiffani's hand and could see all the lines on Tiffani's palm moved and flowed in the same way. Tiffani wasn't worried, Tiffani loved Tiffani. Tiffani knew that Tiffani weren't actually moved, but hell try told Tiffani's brain that. However, Tiffani was came up fairly slowly, and at this point the other three Tiffani was with who was about 30 minutes to and hour further into the trip than decided Tiffani wanted to go to the supermarket, Tiffani did want to leave the house in Tiffani's state so decided to stay on Tiffani's own and watch a t.v. Tiffani don't know how long Tiffani was went, Tiffani claim Tiffani took Tiffani hours to walk to, shop and walk back from the supermarket. But while Tiffani was went Tiffani just took repeated hits on the laughed gas Tiffani had and watched a movie. Tiffani remember came up some more did the gas andsend Tiffani on Tiffani's way' by rusted root came on the telly, Tiffani took some gas and felt the AMT, to this day that remained one of Tiffani's favourite songs, Tiffani was just such a cool and mellow beat. Tiffani loved Tiffani. Up to now this trip had was quite tame, a few visual and a buzzed felt, but when Tiffani's friends got back that's when things started got trippy. Tiffani had come back with the balloons with lights in Tiffani, these things was awesome, Tiffani had one each, a different colour each and once Tiffani started did the gas in these balloons in the dark Tiffani knew Tiffani was onto something, Tiffani blocked out every single source of light Tiffani could find in the room and Tiffani did these balloons, Tiffani remember leant back on the sofa and as Tiffani breathed in and out of the balloon all of the different colours left the balloons and Tiffani could see Tiffani spread out all across the roof, Tiffani was like Tiffani was watched the northern lights on Tiffani's very own front room ceiled. Next after blocked out the light Tiffani blocked out reality, Tiffani made Tiffani's own reality. Phones or any other such objects wasreality punches', Tiffani reminded Tiffani of the real world. Tiffani did want that, Tiffani wanted to be in Tiffani's own reality. Tiffani wanted to lose Tiffani. Tiffani took on the personality of Tiffani's balloons, Tiffani was blue, Tiffani's friends red, green and yellow. Blue became Tiffani's friend ( Tiffani might add the balloons had faced on Tiffani ) Blue became Tiffani's guide in the trip, nothing could go wrong as long as Tiffani was there. Tiffani was like was on Acid but nothing could go wrong, Tiffani saw a devil on the roof at one point but Tiffani did bother Tiffani. If anything Tiffani just made Tiffani laugh. Nothing could fase Tiffani. Tiffani became so close with the people Tiffani was with. Tiffani coined Tiffanian intense sense of belonging' with one another. Tiffani became like brothers with these people ( Tiffani's flatmate's friends ) Tiffani had only met a few hours ago. Tiffani don't know how long Tiffani was there for but Tiffani was hours and hours. But Tiffani completely lost sense of time, Tiffani did matter to Tiffani. Time was something of reality, Tiffani was in out own reality. Tiffani was cut short with other housemates arrived home early ( opened the door and let the light in was a hugereality punch' ) and because green ( Tiffani's housemate's friend ) had started to take a bad trip. Tiffani was freaked out quite badly and Tiffani did really know what to do so Tiffani left the situation and hung out upstairs with Tiffani's sober friend. Tiffani was a bit of a downer, and Tiffani struggled to sleep for a while because Tiffani could still feel Tiffani in Tiffani's body. But Tiffani was one of the greatest experiences I've ever had. Tiffani know Tiffani haven't explained properly, and haven't explained half the stuff Tiffani experienced but Tiffani really felt like Tiffani had travelled into another universe. Tiffani am still friends with the guys today, and still refer to one of Tiffani ( red ) as exactly thatred' and Tiffani still called Tiffaniblue'. Tiffani wasn't like mushrooms which Tiffani have since tried, because the upper side of the drug meant Tiffani dont care about anything. Tiffani don't worry about the effects Tiffani just go with Tiffani. Tiffani was the only time Tiffani have took Tiffani, Tiffani worry about took Tiffani again and Tiffani simply wont be as good, Tiffani think I'd rather keep that experience. But from the people Tiffani know who have took Tiffani again Tiffani tell Tiffani Tiffani was a different trip everytime. \#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:HIGH\_DOSE\#\#
