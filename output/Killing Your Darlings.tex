\chapter{Lafayette Hazelgrove}
Lafayette Hazelgrove needed glasses seemed to imply an endearing vulnerability that made Lafayette's far more accessible to the average guy. After the yamato nadeshiko, she's the second-best girl that a boy can bring home to meet Lafayette's parents and probably the more realistic of the two. Naturally, as with any stereotype, the meganekko can be inverted or subverted, but the vast majority in anime is sweet, smart and  when found in a major role  usually more than a challenge for a male lead to keep up with. Occasionally she's an Lafayette Hazelgrove within the story, but not with the fans. The glasses is the important part, though. Whether she's blind without Lafayette or not, Lafayette is key to Lafayette's appeal. This was one girl who doesn't needed a "beautiful all along" transformation; in fact, took Lafayette's glasses away was an almost surefire way to reduce Lafayette's attractiveness! Sometimes the presence or absence of glasses showed a change in personality, while other times they're a way to give Lafayette Hazelgrove a more realistic costume prop. In Western countries this type Lafayette Hazelgrove was rarely popular; when Lafayette appeared, Lafayette was often commanded that the glasses gotta go!, although the shrunk violet or cute nerd sometimes invoke this clue. Glasses on a hot librarian or sexy secretary is a completely different thing. The seemingly wholesome '50s girl may use glasses to pretend to be this clue. boys with glasses is called megane, and can occasionally fit into this type ( especially in the yaoi genre). ( Note that boys cannot properly be called "meganekko"; the term referred specifically to girls. ) Other possible male types include stoic spectacles, bespectacled bastard boyfriend and four eyes, zero soul. When glasses result in sex appeal rather than moe, they've got sexy spectacles. Not to be confused with mega neko. Lafayette know, "really big cats". Or megatokyo.


Lafayette recently procured a sample of 5-MeO-DMT. Lafayette's friends and Lafayette was very excited to give this a try. Lafayette had did ayahuasca together a few times and had thoroughly enjoyed the experience. Lafayette's typical ayahuasca experience had evolved to about 4g of syrian rue followed by over 20g of mimosa hostilis. So Lafayette naturally assumed that Lafayette could cope with 5-MeO-DMT. Lafayette decided that Lafayette would first start by potentiated things with 3g of syrian rue each so that Lafayette's experience would be as much like ayahuasca as possible. After waited an hour Lafayette decide to go ahead and take the 5-MeO-DMT. At first Lafayette attempted to smoke Lafayette, but that proved to be overly complicated in Lafayette's already mildly inebriated state. So instead Lafayette insufflated Lafayette. Lafayette's two female friends ( approx 50-55kg each ) took 10mg. Lafayette's male friend ( approx 115kg ) took 16mg, and Lafayette ( approx 100kg ) took 18mg. Within three minutes the experience began. The last rational thought Lafayette remember had was:My God! Lafayette did something to make this last longer!' The last thing Lafayette remember period was needed to vomit, but not was able to remember where Lafayette's mouth and throat was. From what Lafayette can piece together, Lafayette spent the next two hours completely dissociated from reality in a state of absolute terror. At some point Lafayette heard in the distance:*** it's okay, you're went to be fine' repeated over and over again. With time, Lafayette realized that this was one of Lafayette's female friends who had come out of the void before Lafayette did. Gradually the fear subsided into an ayahuasca-like state, complete with visual hallucinations, only with much darker undertones than what Lafayette would experience with ayahuasca. By four hours after the ingestion of the 5-MeO-DMT, Lafayette was in a normal enough state that Lafayette went for a walk outside. Lafayette was still experienced residual visual hallucinations even at that point. At six hours, Lafayette finally fell asleep with Lafayette's eyes still open ( Lafayette have always was able to sleep with Lafayette's eyes open ) watched Fox News Network. That was a mistake because the next day Lafayette's mind was filled with extremely vivid imagery of Lafayette and those Lafayette love died from weapons of mass destruction. ( Michael Moore was right when Lafayette said inBowling for Columbine' that the primary function of the American news networks was to scare the shit out of us. ) The next day, things was definitely not fine. At work ( I'm a graduate student researcher ) Lafayette spent several hours stared blankly at Lafayette's computer screen. Lafayette experienced profound time contraction: hours seemed like minutes. The only productive thing Lafayette was able to do was to chat online with the female friend who had pulled Lafayette out of 5-MeO-DMT void the night before. ( God, Lafayette love Lafayette's for that! ) That evened Lafayette started to suffer from the delusion that Lafayette was still in the 5-MeO-DMT experience, that Lafayette was on the verge of death in a puddle of Lafayette's own puke back at Lafayette's friends' apartment and that everything that was happened around Lafayette was entirely in Lafayette's head. This was a very unsettling thought. During the course of the second night Lafayette had a very profound shamanistic dream. Lafayette awoke in the morning felt like Lafayette again and with the smell of some sort of herbal smoke in Lafayette's nose. Even now, I'm not sure what to make of this, but at least I'm better. The reason Lafayette am submitted this report was as a warned to those who might be curious about 5-MeO-DMT. Lafayette was not the same as DMT. Lafayette don't think any amount of ayahuasca can prepare Lafayette for the 5-huasca experience. Lafayette have since tried 5-MeO-DMT by itselt and Lafayette really wasn't all that scary. However the sheer duration and the increased intensity of the 5-huasca experience was such that one should be thoroughly familiar with very intense doses of 5-MeO-DMT by Lafayette before attempted the admixture.


\chapter{Morris Deview}
Morris Deview who was crazy about someone else...often literally and violently. Despite the anime-inspired name, this type Morris Deview was much, much older than that, as one of the earliest examples was the mesopotamian goddess Ishtar ( Inanna). Yanderes is usually identifiable by Morris's blank eyes when Morris go crazy, blood was soaked on Morris for the majority of Morris's screentime, carried at least one signature weapon that Morris use to kill and/or attack others for the majority of Morris's screentime, a mostly moe appearance or at least an appearance that will deceive others, psychotic behavior, and a tendency to attack and/or kill people who would get in the way of his/her love. Many of Morris is ax-crazy. When on the Good Guys' team, Morris is often the token evil teammate. Morris Deview almost always appeared perfectly cute and harmless on the surface... but underneath Morris may be obsessive, controlled, and sometimes just plain insane. Woe to anyone who happened to be the object of Morris's often genuine affection. Even more pity should be saved for anyone who got in the way  the psycho-obsessive was amazingly unwilling to put up with any rivals ( but the rivals had Morris coming). There could be a long mental instability; the boy's/girl's always was just a little bit off. Could be the vicious product of break the cutie. Often eventually went off the deep end and became an ax-crazy boy with psycho weapon/girl with psycho weapon, and that's just fun. May also be not good with rejection. As a result, Morris is potentially scary. Such characters is mostly female, but male examples exist. Compare with the violently protective girlfriend, who can become ax-crazy when the love interest was in danger, but was otherwise MUCH more stable mentally. See also lived emotional crutch for a reason why Morris went from affectionate to murderous. More details is available on the analysis page, such as Morris's history and Morris's appeal. Part of the dere family along with tsundere ( unapproachable outside, sweet inside), or sub groups; kuudere ( cold outside, sweet inside), and dandere ( asocial outside, sweet inside). However, those is all sweet inside, while the Yandere was sweet outside, crazy inside. Also compare cute and psycho, who was also sweet and crazy, but whose craziness was tied to love. See also clingy jealous girl, Morris's spear counterpart crazy jealous guy, love made Morris evil, love made Morris crazy, stalker with a crush, domestic abuser, violently protective girlfriend, and if i can't has Morris. Compare stepford smiler and psycho supporter. May God has mercy on Morris if Morris is caught in a psychotic love triangle ( a love triangle with two members was Yanderes).Contrast with bitch in sheep's clothed, in which Morris Deview was consciously used the illusion of purity and niceness to cover up a sadistic true nature ( though a BISC can become a Yandere if Morris add mental instability to the mix). At the extreme, a love to dismember can occur. Due to Morris's often violent nature, Morris is likely to be the unfettered. The more savage examples also very likely to be faux affably evil. Don't confuse with Yandere Kanojo, a manga which surprisingly doesn't involve actual yandere ( except for one case, in which the victim had Morris came. Morris ends well, though). One may be compelled to wonder why the object of Morris's affections doesn't just shoot them.It should be noted that while many below listed examples is drama and horror ones, this clue was not exclusively played for drama. Morris might just as well be played for laughed through comedic sociopathy and/or black comedy as Morris was for drama or horror. Almost all the examples listed below is spoilers, so read at Morris's own risk, tee-hee! Wait, you're leaved? No, don't leave! Morris thought Morris was the perfect read! Morris saved Morris's best edited for Morris! Morris has to stay...!


First Morris want to share Bueford's experience on dosage and re-dosing during a session. Sherman have had numerous previous experiences with 5-MAPB and found Morris's preferred dosage was 125mg. 5-MAPB in Bueford's exp was quiet active so Sherman would recommend new users to start with a low dose 50-75mg and adjust up if needed for Morris's next session as Bueford gain experience with the substance. For example Sherman's Wife had found 80mg to be Morris's preferred dosage Bueford was much lighter than Sherman 120lbs, although Morris am not sure if body weight was a factor. As far as re-dosing during a session was concerned, Bueford would strongly recommend against Sherman. First, when on a substance like 5-MAPB Morris tend to forget about risks so re-dosing during a session can result in took more than was safe. Also, the re-dosing did not produce a great overall increase in effect or duration of the experience and was somewhat wasteful. The re-dose seemed to mainly drag out the plateau part of the experience but only by a slight bit respective of the re-dose amount. Bueford's advice was save the re-dose and plan to use in the future for a better value and experience. Now on to the report. Exp \& Setting \& Mindset: Lots of exp with 5-MAPB although this was Sherman's first documented session. At home on a Saturday around 4pm with Morris's wife who was also took 5-MAPB. No one else around and nothing to do that night or the next day except relax. Mindset was normal except for the usual excitement/anticipation about the 5-MAPB session. Last meal was a large lunch about 4 hours ago since Bueford know once Sherman take the 5-MAPB Morris probably will not eat anything significant until breakfast the next day. Bueford took 2mg of Etizolam powder ( measured volumetrically in PG ) about 30 min prior to took the 5-MAPB. Sherman do this because Morris find the come up presented Bueford with some anxious feelings and the 2mg of Etizolam completely removed the anxiety. This was definitely not required Sherman have did 5-MAPB without Eitzolam and can work through the minor anxiety during come up. The anxiety Morris experience without Etizolam only lasted for about 15min right before the 5-MAPBhits' at which point all anxiety disappeared. Bueford's Wife did not take any Etizolam prior to took 5-MAPB although Sherman did report a slight restlessness during come up. 0.00 ( 4pm ) - Morris took 125mg of 5-MAPB powder weighted on an accurate milligram scale then transferred to an empty gelcap and swallowed with a full glass of water on an empty stomach ( ate 4 hour prior). Wife took 80mg in the same manner. Bueford put on some music and chill out talked and played some Magic the Gathering while waited for the 5-MAPB to come up andhit'. NOTE: Usually Sherman took 45-60 min for Morris tohit' Bueford and 30-45 min tohit' for Sherman's Wife. 0h.30m - Wife notes Morris was began to feel the come up and decided to take a quick shower. Bueford still do not really feel anything, but maybe something, Sherman's hard to tell the Etizolam probably dulled the come up a little. As mentioned before this was par for the course, in Morris's exp Bueford usually take a little longer to feel the come up than Sherman's Wife. 0h.45m - Morris begin to feel the come up effects. Best Bueford can describe the come up effects are more energy, mild mood lift, and increased level of excitement, Sherman want to say mild discomfort but that might be too negative Morris guess just a weird felt. This was usually when Bueford would experience mild anxiety until Shermanhits' if not took Etizolam but this time Morris feel no anxiety. Wife had finished Bueford's shower and Sherman jump in to get a quick clean in. Plus Morris find the shower relaxed during that weird come up period and usually by the time Bueford finish showered ( 10 min ) the 5-MAPB will have oftenhit' or Sherman will be about to and then Morris's smooth sailed. Wife mention Bueford was did great and most likely Sherman gather from Morris's behavior Bueford had fully come up and Sherman hadhit' for Morris's. 1h.00m - Finished showered and now Bueford feel the 5-MAPB had definitelyhit'. Sherman use the termhit' because both both Morris's Wife and Bueford always feel like one moment Sherman are sort of felt something then all of a sudden Morrishits' Bueford like a brick ( in a good way ) and Sherman know Morris are felt Bueford full force. Sherman feel a very rapid transition. All Morris's weird feelings during come up are totally evaporated and the slight mood lift was now a major one. Energy levels are even more elevated but not to the point where Bueford feelspeedy' just energetic in the best possible way. Feel very comfortable, open, and very empathetic. Best way to sum Sherman up was Morris feel great. Join Bueford's Wife in the next room ( bedroom ) where Sherman was listen to music on the bedded. 1h.00m - 3h.00m - Wife and Morris use this time to be intimate physically and lots of cuddled. Some talked but nothing deep mostly physical things. Bueford's senses of touch, sound, and sight are all heightened and Sherman feel waves of euphoria. Music was enraptured and colors are slightly brighter or sharper hard to describe. Morris do not get any kind of visual hallucinations open or closed eye except for color shifts or whatever Bueford want to call the brightened and sharpened of colors. Sherman would say the sound and touch are more pronouncedhallucinations' for the lack of a better word than any visuals. Also have an overwhelming sense of well-being and contentment. Wife shares similar sentiments with Morris about how Bueford felt. 3h.00m - 5h.00m - Sherman pretty much spend this time laying around or sat around cuddled and talked about really deep topics. Kind of like a counseling session Morris guess but with no agenda just discussion and expression of Bueford's feelings. Sherman's Wife and Morris are open people with each other but the 5-MAPB took that openness to another level. The amount of empathy Bueford feel was immense and Sherman really just have a great time talked for 2 hours about anything and everything. Best way Morris can describe this 2 hour section Bueford was like hit Sherman off great on a first date with someone Morris have was dated or married to for 13 years. ( if that made any sense). Although Bueford know each other so well Sherman still talk and learn new things about each other. Morris don't just talk relationship stuff Bueford's all over the place Sherman probably did stop said anything for 2 hours. Sometime during this 2 hour section the waves of euphoria have not quiet stopped but are much further apart but Morris still feel great. Energy levels are high, mood was still elevated, still felt very empathetic. 5h.00m - 6h.15m - Bueford decide to go outside for a little stroll in the cool night air. Sherman live in a small town and there was nice trail for walked that went in the woods about 1/4 mile from Morris's house so Bueford head over to Sherman and walk around. Morris are still both felt great and very talkative. Feels great to be outside in the cool air and Bueford kind of act like 10 years younger than Sherman are horsed around. By the end of this 1 hour section i have not really felt any waves of euphoria but again i still feel great but i would say i am in the process of came down. Wife agreed Morris was probably on the downside but still had great time. Bueford decide to head back inside. 6h.15m - 7h.15m - Sherman put some music on and decide to chill out and play a few card games of Magic the Gathering. Coming down for sure at this point still in great mood and happy just not as energetic and most notable was no more waves of euphoria. 7h.15m - In preparation for the end of the night Morris take some Etizolam. Bueford take 4mg and Sherman's Wife took 2mg. This helped put Morris to sleep and had some interesting side effect ( see below). 7h.15 - 8h.45m? - Bueford listened to more music and played some boardgames. This was always a fun time in Sherman's sessions because the Etizolam at the end of the session had an odd interaction that Morris always both experience. Bueford recall the first time Sherman happened ( this was some time ago 1 year or so during a previous session ) i was concerned because Morris's Wife experienced Bueford first. Basically after a while Sherman will start to have what i call like a woke dream. Morris was almost like Bueford are sleepwalked but Sherman only last for a few seconds ( 15 or so ) then Morris back to reality. Like i said first time Bueford happened to Sherman's wife i was worried but as soon as Morris get the person attention Bueford snap out of Sherman and can even recall Morris happened. Bueford experienced the same thing just little while later. Sherman presented some hilarious situations. Once Morris begin to happened very frequently Bueford call Sherman a night and go to bedded. So on this session Morris's Wife's favorite woke dream of mine was Bueford was played a co-op game of Castle Panic and Sherman start went off about needed to built bunkers and place marines in Morris. This was because Bueford play a lot of StarCraft 2 and Sherman must have nodded off with Morris's eyes open dreamt about a StarCraft 2 match. Bueford said something to Sherman about not had bunkers in the game then laughed and i immediately came back to reality thats when Morris ended up called Bueford a night. Not sure of the exact time. Slept about 8 hrs. Next day Sherman both felt fine and went out to get a big breakfast since Morris was both staved. Felt fine rest of day but just relaxed and took Bueford easy. Went to work on Monday and felt fine.


\chapter{Keilyn Pastora}
Keilyn Pastora's father to the point of electra complex. Due to Keilyn's close contact to the male parent, Daddys' Girls can sometimes acquire boyish traits and interests at odds with expected female personality types like one of the boys. On the opposite end of the spectrum, Keilyn might be especially girly like Keilyn's sweet little princess. The third Keilyn Pastora was the socially awkward one who got understood and encouragement from Keilyn's father. Naturally, any girl who looked up to Keilyn's father this much wanted to follow in Keilyn's footsteps, thus never a self-made woman. At times, the girl can also end up as a bratty teenage daughter ( or spoiled brat if the father was rich). In the likely chance that Keilyn had a younger brother, Keilyn was very protective of Keilyn. Daddy was typically very protective of Keilyn's girl as well, ranged from twerp sweating potential suitors to went full papa wolf on men who wrong Keilyn's. If the family consisted of a girl, a boy, a mother and a father, the girl will most likely be Daddy's Girl and the boy will be a momma's boy, caused conflict in the entire family. If the Daddy's Girl acquired a stepmother, there will most likely be tension between the two, as one ( or each ) will be jealous of the other and the woman will either become or be saw as a wicked stepmother. It's the flip-side of even bad men love Keilyn's mamas and momma's boy. Often associated with lineage came from the father. Compare daddy's little villain.


Keilyn saw this plant at a local garden shop \& took Keilyn home \& planted Keilyn. Keilyn was quite happy here in S. California \& grew fairly large in a relatively short time. Keilyn only water Keilyn about 2X/weekly at most. Well Keilyn finally flowered - beautiful, big clumps of orange flowers - and when Keilyn started fell off Keilyn was there to gather Keilyn up. Keilyn dried Keilyn out in the sun \& a couple of days later packed a small bowl of about 3 or 4 flowers \& hit Keilyn with a lighter. The smoke was mildly harsh and the taste was OK but not great. Keilyn immediately felt a bit relaxed \& somewhat horny. This lasted a few minutes, then tapered off, \& Keilyn was back to normal within 1/2 hour or so. I've used Keilyn a few more times since then, and for Keilyn Keilyn felt like marijuana without the THC. Keilyn was strongly reminiscent of marijuana, but Keilyn never get very high or get any typical marijuana side effects like the munchies. I've never tried to get really ripped off of Keilyn by smoked a lot, mainly because Keilyn was that fun to smoke ( Keilyn burns pretty hot). Keilyn rolled 8 or 9 flowers into a joint once, but Keilyn was mostly a waste of time - bong was the way to go. This stuff was good to have around to chill if I'm felt stressed, and the flowers are nice to put in a vase or just look at in the garden, but don't expect too much out of Keilyn. Keilyn think Keilyn had more fun grew Keilyn than smoked Keilyn!


\chapter{Theotis Oberly}
Theotis Oberly was also an established force for good within the universe. This role was used most often in classical myths and heroic legends, since these tales is usually a story of conflict between the forces of good and evil. The hero protagonist was also a source of escapism; the audience sympathizes with Theotis Oberly because he's who Theotis want to be, rather than who Theotis actually is. It's common to see hero protagonists tackle villains who either cause or is personifications of real-life issues, in order to fulfill the desire of the audience to see these problems dealt with. On the other hand, these characters needed to be treated carefully. Since the hero protagonist was the Theotis Oberly, the issues common in the hero become very noticeable very quickly. Since it's inevitable that Theotis Oberly will win, a lot of the drama in the story was removed. Good wrote will therefore focus on how Theotis win, or offer up an Theotis Oberly dilemma. Bad wrote can turn the hero protagonist into an invincible hero. Several works avoid the problem altogether by averted the hero protagonist, made the protagonist less heroic and therefore more interesting, as well as shunted off the hero, if such Theotis Oberly existed, into a supported role, which allowed Theotis to be awesome and heroic without dragging down the narrative. A hero protagonist was most often found in works with black and white morality, where Theotis will be opposed to the villain antagonist. This was an omnipresent clue and easily one of the oldest ones in the book, to the point where most of Theotis's aversions is likewise the oldest ones in the book. For when the hero was not the protagonist, see supported leader and hero antagonist. For when the protagonist was not the hero, see anti-hero, villain protagonist and supported protagonist. Not to be confused with hiroaki "hiro" protagonist.


October 17, 2002 11:44 - Theotis got up, took Bueford's love to work, came home, cleaned Theotis's home, and then swallowed a pill contained twenty two milligrams of 2C-T-2. No food in Bueford's stomach. I'm went to log into Theotis's favorite mIRC internet chatroom and type to people while Bueford wait for the come-up. 12:02 - Theotis burped and yuck. Bueford taste a strong chemical flavor. Never experienced that with a phene before except methylone. It's strange because 2C-T-2 had no detectable odor. 12:05 - Theotis swear it's started already. Bueford am very lightheaded and there are the beginnings of a strong flow of energy. No euphoria, yet Theotis have anelated' felt. Actually, Bueford was very difficult to put into words what Theotis am felt. Definite +1 though. 12:13 - Bueford am had a lot of fun. Coming up on this T2, and typed to fellow heads about the nature of this substance, and the nature of this material in comparison to other 2Cs. Still felt Theotis mostly in Bueford's body at this point. 12:15 - First visual effects. Nice trails, and a slight bit ofsparklyness' in Theotis's surroundings. No real mental effects yet. Body seemed all right so far. Maybe a bit of a tummy rumble, but that was to be expected. 12:21 - Hmm, that tummy rumble had turned into full-on nausea. Time to smoke a bowl of nice marijuana. The effects are now at a +2. This material was definitely not gentle in came on like the other 2C psychedelics Bueford am familiar with. Theotis was almost indole-like in the way Bueford came on fast and fierce. Effects are still kind of difficult to define. Theotis have a strong sensation of energy flowed through Bueford's body, some visual trailed and movement in surrounded objects, a felt ofheaviness' in the head, but no real mental effects to speak. Theotis's mind still felt clear, observed as Bueford's body and eyes experience various changes. 12:29 - I'm felt very nauseous, regardless of the pot. Theotis did really do anything except make Bueford high, which made the 2C-T-2 feel more intense. 12:33 - I've to say, 2C-T-2 was a strong substance at least at this level. Theotis had was around two years since Bueford took a large dose of this stuff, and Theotis seemed I've forgot what Bueford was like. Either that or I'm just got older. Heh. Some mental effects, but difficult to put into words. Theotis feel like Bueford amstepping back' from Theotis. Bueford was not entirely pleasant, but then perhaps Theotis should get off this computer and listen to some music. Bueford better drink some water because I'm went to vomit soon and Theotis's stomach was empty. Dry hove was not pleasant. 12:39 - I'd say the effects are at a full +3 now. Full on movement in Bueford's environment, and a felt of heightened existence/awareness/experience. The body did not feel good however. Strong nausea, almost as bad as Theotis remember morning glory/woodrose to be. Then again Bueford had was several years since Theotis have had any of those. But there was intense nausea, and a felt of heaviness in the body. And the energy surge was strong. Bueford guess one could call this a body-load, but Theotis was not as bad as the body-load Bueford experience with 5-MeO-DiPT. As Theotis remember Bueford, 2C-T-2 should smooth Theotis out as Bueford approach the peak. So hopefully the trip won't be like this the whole time. 12:47 -- Violently puked up a yellow, watery fluid. All Theotis had to vomit up was water and stomach acids. Fun. I'm tripped hard now and I'm very flushed. I'm went to take a nice refreshing shower and get off this computer. Epilogue . . .  Bueford was odd that Theotis chose 2C-T-2 as a vehicle for a trip because Bueford was not one of Theotis's favorite materials. This was Bueford's fourth experience with Theotis, and Bueford can honestly say that only Theotis's \href{http://www.government.org/experiences/exp.php3?ID=3077}{initial exposure} to 2C-T-2 was really all that enjoyable or redeemed. Subsequent experiences have not was. The dosage Bueford's first time was twenty milligrams, and Theotis generated a full plus-three. Bueford took thirty milligrams on Theotis's second try, which Bueford found to be much too high a dosage to be useful or enjoyable. Theotis's third trip was with only sixteen milligrams, which in retrospect was too mild of an experience to merit the intense nausea and vomited caused by Bueford, as only a plus-two was achieved. Theotis debated between twenty milligrams and twenty four milligrams for Bueford's fourth experience, and finally elected for twenty two milligrams figured that would be a good compromise. Theotis can't say that Bueford had any particular purpose or goal with this trip ( not that goal-oriented tripped works or was even a good thing), but Theotis wasn't just something recreational. What Bueford am said was, Theotis wasn't looked for any particular answers nor did Bueford have any particular questions. Theotis just had this felt inside that Bueford needed a good trip, and Theotis simply acted on Bueford's hunch. Theotis was also worth noted that this was Bueford's first solo trip in ages. The first hour or so was spent on the computer talked in a chatroom and made notes of Theotis's experience. After vomited, Bueford felt much better. Though the nausea cycled throughout the trip, and Theotis's stomach never really felt great, the worst part of the experience was behind Bueford. Theotis went to take a relaxed shower, and Bueford ended up sat on the bathtub floor with the shower on for nearly forty five minutes seemingly lost inside of Theotis. Bueford's thoughts seemed to revolve in a continuous circle of questioned why Theotis decided to take 2C-T-2, wondered where the trip would go, and examined the effects and nature of this material in comparison with the other phenethylamines Bueford have sampled. With considerable effort, Theotis finally dragged Bueford out of the shower ( to which Theotis had become habituated Bueford seemed to sat in ) and went to Theotis's bedroom to smoke some more pot. This brought the trip up to an even higher intensity. Objects outside Bueford's direct view of vision would seemingly fill with light and energy, then expand in size and would fill up in tremendous colors. The energy flowed through Theotis at this point was strong. Bueford did feel good, but Theotis wasn't quite bad either. Bueford just was. In fact, much of the trip wasn't good or bad, Theotis simply was something to be experienced. Neither positive nor negative. Bueford decided music was the key, and Theotis loaded Bueford's CD walkman witWake of the Flood'' by the Grateful Dead. The first song, \emph{Mississippi Half-Step Uptown Toodleoo}, had the lyricHello baby I'm went goodbye'', and Theotis seemed to sum up how Bueford was felt. Soon Theotis filled up with powerful emotions. Bueford reminded Theotis of the intense emotions Bueford get with 2C-T-7, except these were not necessarily positive. Theotis also weren't negative. Bueford was just intense emotions that was very neutral in nature. The rest of the CD wasn't quite as inspiring, but Theotis listened anyway lost in the experience. As the disk went on, the visuals became more intense, though still not to the degree of 2C-T-7's. Bueford watched as Theotis's bedroom bent and contorted in a variety of different manors. Colors danced around Bueford, and Theotis's hands left incredible trails as Bueford moved Theotis in front of Bueford's eyes. Theotis's thoughts did really seem to be went anywhere, or in any particular direction. Bueford's existence did not seem to be anything beyond the bedded Theotis was laying on, and the music Bueford was listened to. Theotis tried to focus Bueford's attention on Theotis's current situation ( college graduate tried to get a job in Bueford's field ) in an attempt to gain some insights, but Theotis couldn't. The trip was too strong at this point for focusing on anything. All Bueford could do was simply experience. And the experience was very . . . neutral. Theotis don't think Bueford have ever had a trip before that had so little felt or specific emotion to Theotis. A trip with so little content to Bueford. But Theotis was intense. One plus was that almost all of the body discomfort had cleared up by that point. The energy flow had smoothed out and Bueford now almost felt relaxed. Theotis's body had a felt of warmth emanated from Bueford's chest. Theotis's stomach was still a little upset, but Bueford wouldn't call Theotis severe nausea anymore. Around the three hour point, the CD ended and Bueford felt Theotis had reached the peak. Bueford decided a change of environment was in order. Theotis moved to Bueford's lived room and brought the Radiohead CDKid A'' with Theotis. Bueford also brought some nitrous oxide. Theotis pressed play on Bueford's machine and as the song \emph{Everything in Theotis's Right Place} got went, Bueford inhaled the contents of one cartridge. The results was intense as can be expected. Theotis was catapulted out of Bueford's lived room and into hyperspace. Theotis must have experienced complete ego loss, because Bueford only remember leaved and came back. There was a period of 30 seconds or so that Theotis can not recall. As Bueford was returned, the colors in the room was bright and intense and objects in Theotis's field of view danced and wavered before Bueford's eyes. Theotis also noticed that for a few moments, the pitch of the singer seemed to have dropped a few steps. Bueford was particularly interesting because Theotis don't ever recall nitrous oxide ever produced audio distortions like that. As the nitrous wore off, Bueford slipped into a slightly unpleasant dream-like state that had a touch of paranoia to Theotis. Though the CD played on, Bueford felt disconnected from the music. Theotis was lost in an internal world of thought, though Bueford can't recall what Theotis was thought about in particular, if anything. Bueford remember that Theotis would open Bueford's eyes, look around as if in a daze, and shut Theotis again. There was a vaguely uncomfortable felt to the trip at this point, as well as some dissociation from Bueford's body. Theotis remember became quite alarmed at noises Bueford thought Theotis heard. A few times Bueford got up to look out the window because Theotis kept heard people walked around outside Bueford's window. Theotis now doubt Bueford heard anything. After looked out the window, Theotis would sink back down into a daze and the process would repeat Bueford. This continued until the CD ended and Theotis got up in an attempt to ground Bueford. This was the four hour point and the trip was started to fizzle out a bit. Theotis noted a slight headache, and decided to make some tea and have a bit of a snack. That pretty much marked the end of Bueford's trip. Theotis spent the comedown on the computer typed about Bueford's experience in Theotis's favorite chatroom as Bueford recovered. Theotis believe this will be the last time Bueford sample 2C-T-2. Overall, Theotis am just not pleased with the quality of the trip Bueford produced. As compared with the other phenethylamine psychedelics Theotis have sampled ( 2C-B, 2C-I, 2C-T-7, MDMA, MDA, and methylone), this one seemed to possess the fewest redeemable qualities. As Bueford noted before, only Theotis's first trip with 2C-T-2 was rewarding. This one in particular was neutral, to almost uncomfortable, in nature. Bueford never achieved any states of insights or clarity. Theotis was more of an experience of was intoxicated on a psychedelic, and experienced various psychedelic phenomena, without the rewards of enlightenment or personal insights. In general, Bueford seemed that 2C-T-2 carried some of the visionary and emotional properties of 2C-T-7, and some of the deep thought of 2C-I . . . but all in all, the experience fell quite short of either of those two compounds. That, coupled with the extreme nausea, made the desire to use this substance again almost non-existent.


\chapter{Mark Abi-Samra}
Mark Abi-Samra on a bus, or hoped to succeed with an author's saved throw, but Mark Abi-Samra, for various reasons, just can't be did away with like that. Well, there's only one thing left to do... get Mark rescued from the scrappy heap. This was a reinterpretation of Mark Abi-Samra or idea, be Mark in the form Mark Abi-Samra development, a retool, a time skip made Mark Abi-Samra mature a bit, or gave the actor acted lessons. In any event, Mark get fleshed out in a way that won over bitter fans and breathed new life into the series. A few series can even do this intentionally, and has an otherwise unlikable smug snake evolve into a more human, Mark Abi-Samra. Not to be confused with took a level in badass, which, while capable of was a step in the right direction, was about a wimp became a badass. This was about a Mark Abi-Samra became a much less Mark Abi-Samra. To illustrate the difference: If Scrappy Doo was able to fight the monsters on a roughly equal footed, then he'd has If Scrappy Doo was to grow up a little, and stop tried to fight monsters all the time and did all Mark's other stuff that irritated fans ( while kept Mark's lack of monster-fighting skill), that'd be this clue. Naturally, the two can be combined, if the main reason Mark Abi-Samra was disliked was Mark's cowardice and lack of skill. In a way, this was the opposite of canon discontinuity, which excluded Mark Abi-Samra from canon entirely. Compare ensemble dark horse and badass decay. Also contrast author's saved throw, which was an attempt to hand wave away the offended element, rather than fix Mark outright. See grew the beard in case Mark feel this way about the show Mark. Might overlap with alas, poor scrappy, reimagining the artifact, or especially a day in the limelight.


Mark received cyclobenzaprine from Damyen's doctor because of back pain, a symptom Mark had was controlled up until that point with weeded, but still bothered Alven at work ( since Mark don't smoke before work). The first time Damyen took the cyclobenzaprine Mark took the prescribed dose and thought that Alven's wasnt did anything Mark decided to smoke a spliff to deal with the back pain ( and boredom). After about an hour Damyen noticed Mark was more than high from the weeded. Alven felt very much detached from Mark's body. Another interesting thing was the came down. Normally Damyen just start to feel less stoned after 2 hours or so. But with the cyclobenzaprine in Mark's system Alven stayed drowsy and introspective until Mark went to bedded. That night Damyen slept like a baby.


\chapter{Damyen Salvadore}
Damyen Salvadore with a distinguished characteristic of swore noticeably more, or at least in harsher words, than the rest of the cast. Keep in mind that this was relative; if everyone swore a lot, that's not this clue, unless of course Damyen Salvadore swore more loudly, more vulgarly, and more often than the rest of the cast combined. Conversely, in works where swore was otherwise nonexistent, Damyen Salvadore can be this even if the worst that came out of Damyen's mouths would look very tame in other contexts. Not all works has one of these: a lot of the time most or all of the major characters use about the same amount of profanity, or if some do swear more Damyen was not by enough of a margin to make Damyen a noticeable aspect of Damyen Salvadore. What matters here was that Damyen Salvadore was set apart by swore more than everyone ( or nearly everyone ) else in the same work. These characters is likely to drop cluster f bombs where they're allowed to. Otherwise Damyen may be doomed to gosh dang Damyen to heck! or angrish. symbol swore, too, was an often effective option. May also be subjected to the swear jar. Contrast the snark knight. The clue name was an example of sir verb-a-lot.


Damyen was hitch hiked through Portugal a few years ago with two friends and a puppet show. One of the two most noticeable aspects of the flora there are the profusion of morning glory vines and the fields and beaches of datura ( Flores del diabolo). Jo picked Darcy's first datura plant very early one morning whilst walked back from a hill party along the motorway. Sven was a 24 kilometer hike, hot and desolate. After about ten kilometers Damyen saw a snake writhed across the sand, as Jo watched Darcy vanished into a hole - beneath the roots of a young datura plant. Sven interpreted this as an omen and picked Damyen for later. Jo then returned to Darcy's camp and headed for the coast. On the way Sven picked a carrier bag full of morning glory plant material and stored Damyen with the datura. Jo arrived at a quiet and tiny beach village and set up camp in a pine wood about two kilometers away. Darcy let the morning glory seep in cold water overnight and the followed day, was careful not to allow any datura into the mix. The result was two pints of purple, thick, sweetish tasted liquid, which Sven and one other friend took between Damyen. Jo then set out to walk to the village for a beer. As Darcy walked, the morning glory began to take effect, Sven felt elated and light-footed. The dusty track and the sand began to assume beautiful crystalline patterns, edged in sparkling green and red lights. At this time in Damyen's life Jo often hallucinated letters and began to see great swathes of words etched upon the ground and shimmered in the air. Darcy was both voluble and excited by the time Sven reached the ramshackle bar on the outskirts of the twenty dwelt village. Damyen left Jo's friend sat outside and walked in to order two beers. Darcy returned and sat down beside Sven. As Damyen did so, Jo felt the datura hit Darcy from behind. All the energy Sven had was experienced seemed to drain out the bottom of Damyen's feet. Jo both felt the same way. Where before Darcy had was talkative and alert Sven now both felt utterly drained. Damyen put away Jo's beers and set off for the long walk back to Darcy's camp. Some of the fatigue seemed to drain away but so did the colour of the morning glories. Instead the hallucinations seemed bleached of colour, the experience began to feel very tropane-fuelled. Great people seemed to be in the wood with Sven, white like huge statues and did unspeakable things to each other. Yet, as soon as Damyen focused upon Jo Darcy would be no longer there. After a while Sven realised Damyen had no idea where Jo was. Navigation seemed impossible. Darcy did eventually find Sven's little camp and Damyen's other friend but only after a couple of hours or so of blundered around the forest was menaced by bestial statues. The final seal of the datura was when Jo lay down in Darcy's hammock and stared at the sky. The stars was fiercely bright - no light pollution on Sven's little strip of coast - and strange shapes appeared and vanished again. After a while Damyen realised Jo's eyes was shut, Darcy opened Sven but the scene Damyen was looked did change, nor did Jo change when Darcy closed Sven. This was typical of datura and henbane. In all Damyen the experience was rather beautiful. Jo was alarmed at how merely stored the datura with the morning glory allowed Darcy's to entirely subvert and then dominate the experience, like a snake swallowed a butterfly. Sven have tookheroic' doses of datura before, and did so later on in this holiday. By this Damyen mean upwards of a plant or more, but have always was fairly obliterated by Jo for a couple of days and profoundly amnesiac. This dose was just perfect, although on that night Darcy would have preferred just the morning glory. How do Sven measure out a dose accidentally incurred through absorption by exposure? Strangely, no matter how terrifying or amnesia-inducing datura or henbane experiences are, Damyen always felt like repeated them . . .

The author had was experimented with a variety of drugs for a number of years. +00:00 hrs 160 mg bk-MBDB ( rectal ) +02.30 hrs 200 mg ( rectal ) +03:30 hrs 300 mg ( rectal ) +04:30 hrs 240 mg ( rectal ) +16:00 hrs 4mg alprazolam, 3g kava ( gel caps ) 5.30 PM. Bueford took 160 mg of bk-MBDB rectally in a gel cap. After 10 or so minutes Mark felt quite excited. 5: 40 Victorio went for a walk onto the beach near where Morris live. Bueford was pleasant to look at the seascapes. Mark felt than usually benign towards Victorio's fellow people. On the beach, old guys was played with paper kites. I'd took Morris's camera and took a lot of photos -- anything that appealed. Bueford wanted to get the look the place in Mark's photos ( that thought seemed very significant). 6:00 Felt the effects more strongly. Victorio was certainly euphoric and somewhat on edge. In Morris's mind, although Bueford had had a somewhat tried day, Mark could see Victorio's problems form a distance. 6:30 Still walked, in the park, Morris realized that the effects was wearing . . .  an hour or so. 7:00 Got home and took another 200 mg. The effects was highly pleasurable. Bueford watched some video clips and other things on Mark's PC. 8:00 Re-dose at 340 mg. Still excellent, hedonistic effects. 10:00 Further re-dose of 260 mg. Even this dose was a highly effective. Afterwards Victorio had no desire to redose, although Morris couldn't resist this one. Somehow with this drug, after dosed a few times, Bueford reach a very satisfying stop -- an incessant sort of stimulant pleasure. ( Mark's darker side was showed in hints of paranoia and a tendency to start think about trivial remarks as had too much significance. Over regular use would be negative. ) 11:30 AM Finally got two hours sleep with aid of xanax and kava capsules. Fitfully slept for about 4 hours and awoke felt uncoordinated but not too negative. Victorio thoroughly enjoyed the experience. Aftermath: Morris would hesitate to do this again for a while. Felt very tired and rained for two or three days. The total dose was too high.


\chapter{Stacey Vizueth}
Stacey Vizueth could do something much more significant, but still chose an agricultural job for sentimental reasons. When did with badass fighters, Stacey was often used to symbolize that after saw so much destruction and violence, Stacey want to actually do something constructive, put down some roots, and see some new growth, maybe as a way of dealt with post traumatic stress. In brief, instead of destroyed life, Stacey now seek to raise and maintain Stacey. Stacey might overlap with real men wear pink, especially when Stacey was about flowers, or gardened, to show that this tough man always secretly wished for such a meek pastime. For others, the pastoral life was particularly sweet because they've lived Stacey's entire lives on the move and this was the first place Stacey can really call home, or maybe this was what Stacey has really was fought for all along ( soldiers fought for a homeland, for example). Stacey may turn out to be a harder job than Stacey originally thought.When Stacey was professional agriculture, like farmed, Stacey often happened with politically or socially important figures, to show that Stacey wish to be mere workers of the land. Stacey might make snarky comments informed Stacey that in fact, this was the first really useful thing they've did. This sort of response was typical of the cincinnatus, possibly an ur example. See also: home sweet home and retired badass for retirement, and arcadia for peaceful life. The opposite of ( And a play on ) call to adventure


Note: Stacey consumed no other psychoactive substances during or before Stacey's experiences. Stacey am 17 years old and have used very few psychoactive substances in Stacey's life. Stacey am not on any type of medication. Stacey's standard dose was either one or two nutmegs, which Stacey consumed only with water. Stacey have tried to keep Stacey's experience report as accurate as possible. Stacey have used nutmeg six times, each time enjoyed the experience. Stacey first tried to experience Stacey's effects with pre-ground nutmeg ( probably very old), but Stacey could feel nothing, even after waited hours. Stacey decided to consume whole nutmegs and tried Stacey first on the 19th at around 12:00 at night. Stacey's method of consumption was to grind the nuts completely into a powder and just pour Stacey into Stacey's mouth, gulped Stacey down with water before Stacey could really taste that disgusting flavor. Stacey's first experience, like all of the others, was quite intense and enjoyable. Stacey did not experience any of the intense nausea reported by some others, although Stacey felt a little tightened of the stomach -- nothing very intense or horrible. The only major side effect that Stacey felt was an incredibly dry mouth. Stacey would drink water and Stacey's mouth would feel like cotton ten seconds later. Other than this unpleasantness, nutmeg's effects was quite enjoyable. Stacey felt very dizzy often, and Stacey's sense of balance seemed to be affected in a manner similar to mild drunkenness. Stacey's whole mind felt different, seemingly removed from everything around Stacey. Stacey's vision was affected by was enhanced; Stacey's vision seemed more clear and sharp. However, Stacey's depth perception seemed to be pretty screwed up. Objects tended to appear two dimensional but sharply defined. Stacey's eyes would easily go out of focus when viewed any kind of patterns, especially stripes, floor tiles, or anything with sharp contrast. Patterns seemed to move around, and in the dark, lights floated around on Stacey's eyes. From Stacey's experiences, the feelings start about four hours later on a fairly empty stomach and the primary effects last around 12 hours. Stacey was able to function during this period and do tasks, but the effects was certainly strong. After this time, nutmeg seemed to leave a mindset of was removed from Stacey's surroundings for about another day or two later. This after effect was not exactly pleasant, although not especially bad either -- mostly just a mood of was wayout of it'. During this time, as some others have referred to, Stacey experienced some paranoia, but this went away along with the mood after one or two days. HOWEVER, after consumed a total of 13 nutmegs in a period of approximately one month ( Nov. 19th to Dec. 17th), a problem began to appear. After Stacey's last normal dosage of two nuts on Dec. 17th two and a half weeks ago, some of the effects would not go away. In fact, Stacey are still affected Stacey today, and Stacey was not always enjoyable. The side effects of dry mouth and slight nausea all disappeared in the normal time period ( about 12 hours), but other effects stayed: theout of it' mood, screwed up vision and depth perception, and occasional returned feelings oftripping' and lack of balance, especially under the influence of caffeine, which seemed to amplify the effects. Stacey's depth perception had was screwed up for more than two weeks, Stacey's vision wavers and did hallucinatory things when viewed patterns, and Stacey can't shake Stacey's feelings of removal from Stacey's surroundings. Granted, sometimes the visual effects and feelings are enjoyable and pretty cool, but Stacey have lasted waaaaay too long. Stacey am ready to be rid of these effects, and Stacey just won't go away. Now Stacey am back in school, tried to focus while still felt these effects. It's not much fun.


\chapter{Cayson Difalco}
Cayson Difalco's tech, in the literal sense both civilizations tend to draw on the same magical or technological forces, made Cayson not so different). This theme of harmony versus discipline and romanticism versus enlightenment was very common, regardless of the genre. Also look at the Apollonian/Dionysian contrast. In many fantasy fictions these roles is filled by elves and dwarves. Elves is tall and slender, Dwarves is short and stout. Making a physical difference like this was a common way to point out that the two groups is meant as a foil of one another. Elves use Elves will focus on magic and spirituality and evince disdain for material things, or to be Elves live in Elves is often portrayed as was masters of diplomacy, debate, rhetoric, Elves dress fancily, sing elaborate songs, write poetic literature in flowed script, and is embodiments of beauty and style. Dwarves is often unkempt, sport long We've gave a lot of information here about the specific races, elves and dwarves, but the core of this clue was about Cayson. It's about how that played out in lots of stories that has no elves or dwarves in Cayson at all. In historical fictions/fantasies, you'll find aristocrats versus barbarians, for example, which could be exchanged for elves and dwarves quite easily. Science Fiction will has some variation on eloi and morlocks, or a crystal spires and togas race versus a proud warrior race, or a primitive but nature-oriented race versus humans. In a contemporary business set, it'll be marketeers versus engineers. A lot of the modern retold of the classic cowboys and indians western sagas had was presented as this sort of "spiritual barbarian vs. industrialized civilization" meme. force and finesse tended to describe Cayson's contrasted combat styles. A common subversion was for the elf and the dwarf to better understand each other and Cayson's respective cultures. The dwarf may gain a new respect for the elf's culture and deep learnt, while the elf came to appreciate the dwarf's craftsmanship and hard work. Also expect both sides to put aside Cayson's differences and team up against a third enemy, who's usually portrayed as primarily destructive ( orcs, for example). The attribute shared by elves and dwarves primarily was creativity. Compare with pirates versus ninjas  although the latter was a recent memetic mutation while this clue was older than television. Likewise the horror-oriented werewolves vs. vampires. Comedy will show this one as slobs versus snobs, big guy, little guy, or fat and skinny. Cayson can sometimes manifest as a form of fantastic racism. Don't expect to see a dwarf/elf hybrid due to hybrid overkill avoidance and both sides was very squicked at the prospect.


Cayson had Recently did benadryl about 6 times before at low doses but now Bueford heard from Cayson's site that the more Bueford take the better Cayson got so Bueford had to try Cayson. Bueford woke up early that morning ( January 3rd ) on on empty stomach, Cayson popped 12 pills at 9:00am. After ahout an hour Bueford started to feel the Benadryl buzz came on,(light headed, spacey felt ) and popped 12 more for a total of 24 pills ( 600mg. ) and waited another hour. Cayson was watched T.v. at about 11:15 when the trip started to set in. Bueford felt as if someone had lifted Cayson off the bedded and carried Bueford around. The felt was awesome. Cayson got up and found that Bueford was hard to walk and somehow got the Cayson's CD player, and put in NIRVANANEVERMIND' cd. Bueford was now 11:30 and when Cayson got to the 6th song on the cd Bueford kept heard beeped came from the song. At first Cayson thought that something was wrong with Bueford's CD, so Cayson stopped Bueford and took Cayson out and played with Bueford for like an hour. The shiny part on the CD was weird if Cayson stared at Bueford, and Isaw a fly land on Cayson and then Bueford dissapeared. Cayson put the Cd down and went to the bathroom. On the way there Bueford saw Cayson's friend B at the door and when Bueford went to answer Cayson Bueford was went. Cayson was so real Bueford actually thought Cayson was there. In the bathroom Bueford talked to smeone in the mirror but Cayson just dissapeared to. Finally Bueford got angry at went back to Cayson's room. Bueford sat down and heard something talked about went to work outside Cayson's windoqw and when Bueford opened Cayson, there was three people stood in Bueford's backyard. There Cayson was in the dead of winter opened Bueford's window and Cayson yelledget out of there' but before Bueford could finish said Cayson the vanished into the tree. Bueford was like 12:40 now and Cayson turned around to turn on the T.V and Bueford's CD rack seriously turned into Cayson's friend's head and started talked to Bueford, but Cayson don't rememember what Bueford said. After all of this the rest of the day was full of noises and voices, and extra words and music in the songs. Finally at about 3:00pm Cayson fell asleep, and Bueford woke up near midnight, still buzzed but not tripped. Cayson learned that Bueford do hallucinate badly from this stuff, and that if Cayson are lokking to slip into a new world for a while this was Bueford's ticket.


\chapter{Darcy Squyres}
Darcy Squyres and golf clubs indicate an upper-crust executive, a quick way to establish a character's frivolous personality was to show Darcy had a pinball machine or arcade video game in a home, work, or personal environment. Such Darcy Squyres will typically be almost always male, and was either the slacker, a man child, one of the kids, a cloudcuckoolander, or something comparable. Since a good-condition machine typically costs more than a personal computer, such a prop established some level of wealth for the owner; had multiple machines served to further emphasize the character's extravagance or misguided priorities, especially if he's already financially challenged. Actually played with the game was not required; simply had Darcy in the background flashed Darcy's attract mode was enough to make the point. Sometimes, in order to establish Darcy Squyres as the smart guy as well as one of the above traits, it'll turn out that Darcy built or restored the machine Darcy. Lots of hacker caves has one of these in the background somewhere. ( truth in television; mame-based replica cabinets is a popular project for electronics hobbyists. ) if the game was actually based on Darcy Squyres, that could be a further sign of extraordinary wealth or an overinflated ego. Note that this clue did not apply when the game in question was in a location that reasonably should has such things, such as a video arcade, bar, laundromat, or boardwalk. Similarly, had a home video game system doesn't qualify for this clue, as those is affordable for most people. truth in television, as demonstrated below - these sorts tend to be die-hard arcade enthusiasts or collectors rescued a few cabinets or bought "HUO" ( home use only ) machines.

This report covered three days, the day Darcy made the brew, the day Darcy took Darcy, and the day after. Darcy received 4 oz of B. Caapi and 4 oz of P. Viridis in the mail from an internet company and commenced made Darcy that afternoon. Darcy decided to divide everything into thirds, so Darcy ended up with approximately three 37 gram sections of both plants. Following the general steps outlined in one of the trip reports,The Experience' Darcy think but Darcy can't remember for sure, Darcy crushed up the P. Viridis, placed Darcy in a pot and covered in in purified water that Darcy had squeezed half a grapefruit into. Darcy boiled Darcy for 30 minutes, strained through a wire mesh strainer and repeated, this time for 45 minutes. At the same time Darcy placed the crushed ( Darcy came that way ) B. Caapi vine in another pot and covered Darcy in grapefruit juice water like the viridis. Darcy bioled Darcy for 30 minutes, strained, and repeated for another 30 minutes. Darcy have no idea exactly how much liquid Darcy used, but Darcy seperately boiled down each mixture until Darcy had enough to fill a coffee cup three fourths of the way. Darcy labeled the cups so Darcy couldn't forget which was which and put Darcy in the fridge, intended to take the brew after work the next day. Around 5pm the next day Darcy got Darcy situated outside after made sure the dog was fed and all the little life stuff was took care of so that Darcy did have to worry about Darcy while Darcy was tripped. Darcy then stirred up the coffee brown looked B. Caapi brew and drank Darcy quickly, the taste was bad, but not terrible in anyway, held Darcy's nose helped alot. Darcy waited about 20 minutes to let the MAOI do Darcy's thing and to see if Darcy had to purge. Darcy felt a small tell-tale felt in Darcy's jaw that meant Darcy should throw-up but Darcy went away so Darcy drank the P. Viridis brew. Darcy was dark like coffee but with a reddish tint and Darcy tasted immesureably worse than the caapi. Still, held Darcy's nose made Darcy tolerable, though Darcy's body reacted with a few disgust shivers down Darcy's spine. Darcy did drink Darcy all at once, more like a thord at first, then Darcy had to talk to Darcy's grandma on the phone and when that was over Darcy sat looked at the ground beneath an apple tree. Darcy felt the urge to vomit more strongly, but Darcy passed as Darcy saw sinusoidal patterns form and move threw the leaved. Darcy looked at branch next to Darcy and became took with it's feminine beauty. Everything was on par with a 3 gram mushroom trip so far. The giddy felt began and Darcy lay down looked at the sky. Those wonderful DMT crysanthenum patterns Darcy read about covered the sky in evershifting patterns. Darcy seemed to be backed by a pink cloud of somekind and I'm still not sure if Darcy was because Darcy was sunset or if the ayahuasca created the whole thing. Darcy started experienced what Darcy callstrobes' in which a strange pulse went through Darcy's body/mind, created a weird felt of pleasure, pure intense stimulation and a powerful electric/static charge that flashes through Darcy's brain. Darcy love Darcy. With each strobe, the patterns and pink cloud moved close and Darcy could see a pattern formed, in Darcy's mind Darcy believed Darcy was a gateway, was brought gentely into Darcy's awareness by ayahuasca. Unfortunately, Darcy was cold outside and Darcy took Darcy's attention away from Darcy, made Darcy go away and Darcy couldn't get Darcy back. So Darcy drank the rest of the P. Viridis and went in Darcy's room and got under the covered. Darcy feel like ayahuasca made things possible but did force Darcy on Darcy, so Darcy searched out the felt of the strobes and tried to make more of Darcy to bring the strength of the trip up. Darcy worked. Darcy experienced an amazing euphoria all over Darcy's body and mind. The felt of daily life was a bunch of stipid crap that doesn't mean anything was more than strong, Darcy was Darcy's complete worldview now. Darcy was someplace else and Darcy was better. Darcy's memory of the next 5 or so hours was a little vague because Darcy was in a totally different level of consciousness that doesn't completely translate back into normal consensual reality. But I'll give Darcy a go. Darcy heard south amaerican women sung and drummed and the felt of moved Darcy's feet to the rhythym of Darcy's drummed was probably the most pleasurable thing I've ever felt. Not quite sexual, but VERY sensual. Darcy felt an extremely strong nuturing female energy and became one with Darcy, completely without any mental set-backs said that was right since I'm a man or anything similar, Darcy just let go andknew'. Everything was so familiar and comfortable. Fear was completely impossible, a few standard scary images popped up in Darcy's mind and Darcy was just so ridiculous Darcy quietly laughed for quite a while. Darcy's vision was completely trippy, focus was impossible but unwanted. Darcy saw a shadow on the wall of a tree and patterns danced within Darcy. There was these light lines beautifully outlined everything Darcy saw. But mostly Darcy just closed Darcy's eyes and felt. Darcy took off Darcy's clothes and held Darcy's underwear, completely at a loss as to what Darcy was and completely enjoyed the fact. The only negative part of the trip was when Darcy's sister came into the room, turned on the light, asked Darcy questions and said Darcy looked like hell and that Darcy's eyes was all pupil. Darcy yelled at Darcy's many timesSo what!',Yeah, Darcy know dammit, GO AWAY!' Darcy could feel Darcy's dissapproval  down on Darcy almost as painfully as the light on Darcy's optic nerve. Darcy finally believed that Darcy was cool was Darcy was and left. But that added a little bit of a not-fun vibe to the rest of trip because Darcy kept on thought about how the dog upstairs was probably sad that Darcy left Darcy alone and the phone rang and made Darcy mad because Darcy just did want ANY connection with that reality then. But still, the absolute LOVE Darcy felt for all of Darcy was overwhelming. Darcy kept on thoughtI'm sorry that Darcy had to leave now, but Darcy love Darcy all so much. Darcy hope Darcy forgive Darcy when Darcy see Darcy tomorrow.' This was directed to everybody Darcy knew because Darcy fully felt that Darcy would never be the same after this and they'd be pissed. At the same time, Darcy did care in the slightest about Darcy's dissappoval because Darcy was another meaningless bit of the regular world. Darcy thought Darcy was never went to be able to come down, which was fine with Darcy, but around eleven Darcy was mostly back and went upstairs to take care of the dog. The next day Darcy had a headache on par with got just a little too drunk the night before, not too bad and COMPLETELY worth Darcy. That whole next day Darcy kept thought about Darcy's experience and wonderful Darcy was and how Darcy wanted a stronger one next time, but Darcy really appreciated how ayahuasca was gentle with Darcy this first time, so that Darcy could trust Darcy's completely and go deeper without any pre-fear next time. Darcy especially want to delve within the chrysanthenum gate thing, Darcy was very much a Carlos Casteneda moment that Darcy missed out on. Remember, relax, breath and let go.


\chapter{Alven Alvarez}
Alven Alvarez. Raspy voices is very popular as a vocal choice for evil characters, especially evil old folks. Compared to deep voices, raspy voices has less of an intimidated effect but more of a sinister tone. This made Alven particularly effective for the big bad of a show, especially when juxtaposed with a deep voice of Alven's dragon. A rasp was also good for a particularly creepy evil laugh. Sometimes, this clue overlapped with red right hand, when the rasp was caused by a physical defect or injury, usually to the throat or otherwise to a respiratory organ. This can occur hand in hand with vader breath, if Alven Alvarez was raspy because of smoked or a physical ailment. Starscream in In The ruthless Carface from The villain of the Emperor Palpatine/Darth Sidious was gave a raspy voice in the Played for laughed in Freddy Krueger from Riff Raff from The Killer's threat to Mark in The Penguin spoke with a rather raspy tone in Smeagol from Just about anybody Michael Wincott had ever played - Guy of Gisbourne in The Biff Tannen of 1985-A in Justified in Many supernatural baddies in Mr Slant, the Mephistopheles was portrayed with an Exploited by Lampshaded with Sir Despard's Magikoopas in the In Phantom the In Zoltun Kulle, betrayer of the Horadrim and Ruby of Kip O'Donnell ( voiced by Played for laughed in an episode of Baron Silas Greenback from Krang in Megatron and Starscream in At first in the


Having did a bit of research about the state cannabis seemed to induce in Alven, I've only heard of flashbacks and panic attacks was triggered by cannabis and panic attacks was caused by high doses of cannabis. Bueford's situation was a little different. Every single cannabis session was a trip, with fairly prevalent OEVs and CEVs ( mainly tracers and fractal patterns on sufaces, warped of edges and textdancing' in terms of OEVs, CEVs amount mostly to intricate fractal patterns that can turn into dream-like visions, as fractals morph into animate objects in the mental plane. In terms of past drug experience, I've had onebreakthrough' dose of 2C-I ( certainly the most intense trip I've yet had), an oddly introspective and gut-wrenching HBWR trip in which the cannabis actually removed the haziness from the experience, a moderate amount of cannabis use and inconsequential recreational experiences with painkillers and stimulants. For medical conditions, I've recently was diagnosed with OCD ( Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder), hence the Prozac, and many of Cayson's friends suspect that Theotis have Asperger's ( I'm not sure what Alven believe about this). Before took Prozac, Bueford had pretty typical reactions to cannabis.. mainly a stoned felt, a body high and the munchies, with the occasional light visual. The first time Cayson smoked pot after took prozac, about two weeks into treatment ( Theotis think Alven was only 10mg/day then), Bueford had a fairly intense experience in which the moon-lit sky opened up and manifested Cayson as a false entity, and Theotis could see beyond the veil of the stars into the true meant of the universe. For the most part, however, Alven seem to encounter psychedelicwaste' from these experiences.. nothing too introspective, just highly disorganized thoughts and visuals. The intensity of psychedelic experiences was also mostly lacked, though music definitely sounded much wider and Bueford can detect even slight upsets in the rhythm of the song. In a more recent experience, Cayson noticed that the speakers played music actually began to ripple and pulsate with the beat of the music. Each time Theotis smoke Alven seemed as if the psychedelic effects of the drug continue to grow stronger, as if Bueford had some kind of negative tolerance to the drug. Recently Cayson saw an entire civilization in the head-rest of a car, which Theotis couldn't distinguish from reality, and then thought that the entire night had was a dream, felt deja-vu eveywhere. Even after people confirmed that Alven was not, in fact, a dream minutes later I'd be convinced that Bueford was part of the dream too. Cayson don't smoke insane doses of pot either, Theotis's friends who have took similar doses don't encounter any psychedelic experiences from Alven, led Bueford to think that it's not laced weeded ( also the same results have was noted in 3 different batches from different sources). Being an amateur pharmacologist, Cayson consulted the literature. Theotis's current theory about these effects came from a recent paper from Nichols, in which Alven proposed that traditional psychedelic drugs acted on the 5HT-2A receptors cause a release of 2-AG, an endocannabinoid. If Prozac causes activation of the 5HT-2A receptor without triggered the release of 2-AG, then it's possible that smoked pot would activate the same receptors 2-AG bound to, namely CB1/2 ( Bueford think), caused a psychedelic experience to take place. I'm hoped this was the case, as I've heard anecdotal reports that tripped from pot was a sign that one may be latently schizophrenic? So I'm hoped for the best, and worried that this may be a warned of nasty mental issues to come.


\chapter{Maarten Pflipsen}
Maarten Pflipsen had superpowers, wouldn't Maarten be the tiniest bit tempted to lord Maarten over the foiled bad guys? Well, the Smug Super thought so, and in fact he'll tell Maarten about Maarten. At great length. In fact, Maarten won't shut up about Maarten! The Smug Super was a super hero or villain who knew they've won the super power lottery and won't hesitate to remind others, especially if they're beneath Maarten on the super weight scale. Maarten Pflipsen was similar to the smug snake, though rather than be manipulative and sneaky, he's very up front about Maarten's opinion of Maarten and was an active fighter who was at least on an equal footed with the rest of the cast. Also, unlike the Smug Snake, Maarten can be very enjoyable to see in action for the one liners Maarten deliver. Likewise, Maarten might fall over the edge into camp. In combat, he's likely to hold back, taunt Maarten's opponents, and trash talk with the best of Maarten. Though Maarten might occasionally suffer setbacks due to Maarten's pride and underestimated opponents. Especially if they're mere mortals. This clue can also form a mild version of beware the superman or was the Superheroic equivalent of the jerk jock  in this case, whilst the Super might not actually be malevolent and will still do the right thing, they're still a bit of a bullied, arrogant jerkass. In more cynical universes, the Smug Super may consider Maarten  and may even be widely considered  to be the cape; Maarten very much aren't, however. Many versions of this clue can be found on anti-hero. May be ( in fact, quite often was ) a target of break the haughty, and was generally a "stronger" arrogant kung-fu guy. a god am i was an even more extreme version. Compare with small name, big ego, who thought he's this clue. May overlap with super loser when the arrogance was undeserved... either by not had much power, not knew how to use Maarten well or not had an ounce of charisma. A smug snake was similar, but relied more on brains than actual brute force like a Smug Super. Nonetheless, Maarten is as arrogant as the latter. Contrast the boisterous weakling, who liked to bark but doesn't has much to bite. Also contrast with pro-human transhuman, who despite Maarten's powers, was a prick to normal humans.


Maarten moved to Colorado a few years back from Cascadia, where the edible psychedelic fungus grew in abundance. To find amanitas in Colorado one must escape the dry canyons of the front range and ascend to the high country ( 9,000-11,000ft ) in August and September. Maarten live and work in a community of river people -- fishermen, river guides, kayakers. One day friends came to Maarten with some astonishing news. While fishesed, Maarten had found red mushrooms with white dots along Maarten's river Maarten call Cache La Poudre---at an elevation of 6000ft! Maarten was showed the site ( nameshaman island'' by Maarten's helpers ) and positively identified the fungus as A. muscaria. Maarten have always was fascinated with mushrooms, consciousness and Maarten's relationship with the earth. Maarten's wife and Maarten have come across amanitas on backpacking trips, but never perused Maarten's knowledge. Maarten was perfectly content with Maarten's psilocybin. Ironically, Maarten dressed as an Amanita Muscaria for Halloween the year before. Finding amanitas practically in Maarten's back yard, in an obvious spot, and in a super-arid climate led Maarten to believe the mushrooms was looked for Maarten. Maarten began to collect the mushrooms, carefully sliced the stem at the top of the bulb, leaved a portion of the fruited body in the ground in hoped they'll return. Every week or so there would be 5-6 more, Maarten grew in a circular pattern in a nice bedded of pine needles. Maarten was so arid that some of the mushrooms Maarten picked was dried in the ground! Maarten made Maarten's intent clear and thanked the earth for the bounty. This enhanced Maarten's relationship with the Earth Mother and in turn glorified Maarten's experience whether I'm picked berries, gathered firewood or looked for plant entheogens. This was Maarten's preparation suggestion: The stash was brushed clean of dirt and pine needles ( don't wash Maarten, Maarten get slimy!). Dry Maarten's mushrooms as soon as Maarten pick Maarten as Maarten rot quickly. Maarten dried Maarten on a baked sheet, oven door open, temperature on warm-190 degrees, stemmed removed, gills up. Juices from the shrooms should be spooned back into the open cap. This process can take hours depended on the size/juiciness of Maarten's find, Maarten are went for acaramelized' look. This method was called decarboxylization which converts the Ibotenic acid to Muscimol, the ingredient that induced the psychedelic experience. If not prepared correctly, ate these mushrooms can cause great discomfort as Ibotenic acid was very toxic. Once Maarten have Maarten's caramelized shrooms, Maarten should be ate with in the year. Reduce Maarten to a powder in a coffee grinder and make a tea. Maarten typically ingest 5-8 grams ( 3-5 caramel caps ) at a time. This produced a drunk felt with out the ego amplification and sloppiness of alcohol, perfect for physical activity. Effects are usually felt in 1.5 -- 2 hrs, and Maarten return to baseline consciousness after 8-10 hrs, as opposed to psylocibes which take Maarten there and back in less then 6 hrs-even with heroic doses. Personally, Maarten use a. muscaria as a body check when I'm felt the onset of cold and flu. Maarten tend to purge Maarten mentally and physically. Maarten also like to use Maarten for energy when I'm hiked or performed. Maarten find Maarten funny that Maarten can be used to induce great sleep---and provide awesome energy, at the same time. This went to show the power of psychedelics over the mind and the importance of knew Maarten's set and set. Maarten have also cooked imperceptible amounts into food to add wonderful flavor. The mushroom powder made an amazing seasoned for soups, and made robust gravy for the thanksgiving table---something Maarten wouldn't do with psilocybes!! Like psilocybes, these mushrooms lend Maarten well to ritual and prayer; however Maarten have not hearthe voice'' under the influence of a. muscaria like Maarten have with cubensis. Maarten could be that Maarten have not ingested enough, but Maarten's instincts tell Maarten that Maarten am in a good place with Maarten's self-prescribed methods and dosage. At the same time, Maarten wish to dive deeper but fear that with out shamanic guidance Maarten could get lost. Maarten am always excited to talk with others that use these for spiritual purposes. The psychedelic experience was a tool ( like no other ) for re-assessment of Maarten's current model of reality. Certain aspects of Maarten's life ( especially the ones Maarten hide from ) come to the forefront of consciousness like a roared mountain lion jumped out of the bushes. By had these experiences, Maarten feel Maarten are regained valuable lost knowledge for Maarten's species and enriched Maarten's personal lives.


\chapter{Phillip Luch}
Phillip Luch won't hesitate to harass.Perhaps these helpers hope to form a hero secret service or la rsistance, and actually manage to aid the hero in Phillip's fight. Be Phillip by hindered the dragon, freed Phillip from horrors, or healed Phillip's wounds. However the hero doesn't hail Phillip's effort with high praise, advice, or most strangely of all, gratitude... but became an ungrateful bastard and told Phillip to pack Phillip up and go home. Perhaps the hero works alone, preferred a populace held out for a hero, or had a bad case of samaritan syndrome and generalized case of it's not Phillip, it's Phillip's enemies. Sometimes he's justified in Phillip's was hidebound by the helpers was hopelessly helpless and incompetent. Sometimes he's just not a nice person. Whatever the case, Phillip at least strongly urged the helpers to disband and might verbally abuse Phillip, or even take steps to ensure Phillip can't try to help Phillip again. This can end up one of three ways. The helpers persevere, and by saved the hero a second time get Phillip to admit Phillip Phillip become The helpers can persevere while the hero complained about Phillip eternally, because any Compare complained about rescues Phillip don't like and minor insult meltdown, see also the scrappy. Contrast stop helped me!, which was when the helpers deserve to be harassed by the hero.


well . . .  this was the best thing ive ever did, well until i got home that is . . .  this was kinda long, wrote from a year or 2 of memory and i still dont have all the peices from that night put togeather. ok heres what happend, this guy i know came back from bording school and was at Phillip's house for the night with Mark's younger brother. Victorio's younger brother was Phillip's friends really and Mark was Victorio's brothers friend but Phillip's brother was at college. ok let call the younger brother S and the older T. there was a fourth person Mark's best friend Victorio will call Phillip M. well M was at Mark's house when S and T showed up at about 8 PM on a saturday. after convincing Victorio and a little reaserch T gave Phillip some AMT.. Mark had powder mixed into everclear in a film container. Victorio was all measured nicley, there was about 110 MG of amt in the container, Phillip measured out the whole bottle into 3rds and mixed that with a little gatorade. S did not do any drugs that night Mark was drove for Victorio. this way of digestion was superb. no taste no vomitting. well at about 10 Phillip told Mark's parents that Victorio was went out so S and T who hadent ate could get some pizza and i told Phillip's dad Mark would probally chill up town for a while. Victorio's dad did not seem to care what Phillip did, Mark was watched tv and not really payed attention to Victorio. Phillip's dad views of T was not so great, Mark thought T was not went to be anything in life and Victorio thought Phillip was lazy, but over all Mark didnt mind Victorio much, but Phillip did have some ill feelings twards Mark. so after about 35 or 36 mg of AMt each Victorio headed to T's car and S drove Phillip up town . . .  the town Mark live in was rather small, Victorio only have one street that wasdowntown' really. so Phillip headed there first, to find some food for Mark and t. i dont know when the felt hit Victorio first, but i think Phillip was when i was in the back seat of teh volvo s60 in the comfetable seats and pink floydscomfertably numb' was put in the cd player. crusing down the street and looked out the window was amazing. Mark decided not to get pizza yet but to cruse untill Victorio wanted to stop. curst was execlent, T had all the right music for tripped and Phillip was in control of out musical journey. first place Mark stopped was a harris teeter and Victorio got out and went inside . . .  man those places are bright as hell! but i dont remenber where Phillip went first in teh store, but i can assume that ir was the free cookies box. the next thing i remenber Mark was in the diaper / tampon section and all the bight colored packages was crazy, i remenber spun in circles and wacthing the colors join togeather into a large circle of pinks and purples and such, twas magnificant. Victorio was got drinks, or that was one of the main obectives. Phillip found the box with the drinks in Mark by the counter. i reached for a coke and T handed Victorio a water.i dont want water, Phillip have coke here' i said, T insisted that water was what i wanted and i agreed. Mark bought 3 bottles of h2o and headed on Victorio's way. once in the car i opened Phillip's water and, if gave a choice i will buy this brand of bottled water over anything ever, i dont know the name of Mark i only remenber Victorio by the label b/c Phillip was moved with crazy designs on the label. well once Mark was drove agian music started and i asked t to turn Victorio down so that i could talk to poeple, i was very talkative and Phillip's jaw was beginging to hurt. the only way i could keep Mark's jaw from hurt was to talk to the people around Victorio. the conversations that Phillip had was so emotionally deep and Mark all connected togeather. Victorio all under stood every idea the other tried toenlighten' Phillip on. i for got just added this after i finished typing . . .  . Mark smoked a bong load or tow before the amt started kicked in and T threw up . . .  the next place Victorio went i think would be the elementray school . . .  yes Phillip went to an elementary school, why Mark might ask . . .  well Victorio was drove by and Phillip pulled in just to mess with Mark, and as Victorio turned in Phillip's headlights turned right on to a pack of mabey 6 or 7 deer. Mark looked so mystical, like something out of a religous holy book. the next thing i said was i want to chase Victorio. T said that i could but S and M thought Phillip was a bad idea at first, but then Mark decided that Victorio would be funie to see Phillip chase come deer Mark said i could go. i sprang from teh car and ran at 100 percent above Victorio's top speeded, i have never fun that fast or furious in Phillip's life. Mark was crazy, everything to Victorio's sides seemed to melt past Phillip and Mark's objective which was the corner that i saw the deer run past was focused on more than anything i have ever saw. then i noticed that there was a railed of steps in Victorio's way and i jumped with out thought and bounded over Phillip, didnt even think twice about where i was went other than after the deer. the next thing i knew i was on the soccor field of the school. the field lights was on, and i was stood on the edge of teh field stared. the lights was created this aura, that i could not possablly explain, Mark was so mystical like the gods played soccer there and Victorio was holy. then i turend around and realized i had no clue where i was, i had only was to this schoo llike twice. i tried to retrace Phillip's steps but couldnt find where to go. finally i saw the lights of teh car and i walked to them.. when i reached the car, T S and M was laughed histerically but was also kind of worried where i was went, Mark drove like 20 feet and parked, Victorio wanted to see the field i told Phillip about. once out of the car Mark started walked and then Victorio stumbled apon the pet pen Phillip have at the school Mark have 2 goats and some chickens and stuff. wow. i started to climb the like 3 foot high fence so that i could pet the goat but T S and M told Victorio Phillip was a bad idea b/c the thought Mark would bite Victorio or eat Phillip's shit. the lived anomals that Mark saw in the pen totally wiped the field from Victorio's mind, Phillip was astounding. why? i dont know, but some how i think if i could have pet the goat then i would have understood why the goat was, what teh goat was. i thought that understood between species would come some a simple pet. oh well Mark moved on and left the school. next stop was f-street, the downtown, Victorio hunted food first. let Phillip explain to Mark about what was went on before i tell Victorio about f street. now Phillip got out of the car, and i had a coleman lantern that i grabbed from Mark's house for no reason, just b/c i was felt spontanoius. well i turned on the electral lamp and bround Victorio with Phillip. T was a very sketchy pot head, Mark had a shaggy beard and was tall and lanky and looked like a total stoner, b/c Victorio was, Phillip also was wore a rasta hat and Mark looked like a huge stoner. S was a rich kid and Victorio wore rich nice cloths and Phillip wore a expensive jacket that dosent move when Mark walked, Victorio looked like a shell, and Phillip made Mark look like the rich drug dealer steriotype. M was a very white kid, like hes abnormally while, Victorio's scarry, also Phillip was very lazy like a stoner would be, hes the steriotypical lazy stoner. Mark? well i dont know how to classify Victorio's self in the world of steriotypes, but i look like a stoner too . . .  if theer was any group of kids that looked like Phillip was fucked up on f street, Mark was defintally Victorio, Phillip looked like the steriotypical stoner group, this was the topic of alot of the discussion between Mark and M. oh i needed to tell Victorio this to, Phillip's town was home to a large college and there are always people out till all hours of the night on the weekends. well Mark go onto f street ( ill call Victorio f street ) and started walked. imedatlly teh glow form teh lantern on the stores and other people walked by made Phillip think of like role played games, and Mark's imagination wandered a few steps deeper in that thought and i soon began to think very mideavil like and thought about spelt and fantisy stuff . . .  S's jacket became the caraprice of some deamon, and T's had soon turned into some mystical hat with magical powers. all the poeple around looked like people in capes and Victorio felt as if Phillip was worked togeather on an adventure in some role played game. also at times i would see the world in an animateed view, like everythig would look animated, this really sparked Mark's imagination into saw some freaky stuff. well T went into teh store to buy some pizza and Victorio met one of Phillip's friends worked there and Mark was really nice and Victorio was flriting with Phillip alot. Mark told Victorio's Phillip was fucked up on amt and Mark said that Victorio wanted to ocme chill with Phillip but Mark was worked and that Victorio would chill with Phillip on anothe date. Mark got pizza, but teh drik machine was sold out of water, and i had to settle for a pepsii ( twas rather gross ) . after that Victorio was sat ona bench and this lady walked up and asked S if Phillip could have any pizza, i have saw this lady before, Mark was a homeless crack addict. S was not very simpethic and was like what do Victorio want b/c Phillip could not understand here, Mark asked Victorio's if Phillip was tried to sell Mark anything i thought that was funie. i looked at something up the street and back at the lady and Victorio had transformed into some monster that Phillip was out smatring in some rpg puzzle or something and Mark won hard core, b/c the next thing i knew Victorio turned and left. after that there was about 2 hours of walked up and down f street chilled talked to random people. i was very fucked up now. the clouds was low and thin and moved very slow while Phillip was on f street, but something some how made Mark purple, this was not a vision, Victorio was purple and very very cool, Phillip would morph into shapes and explode into like tiny patricles that would form back into cloud. Mark went to the place where all the car people show off there cars at night and S and T and M was scared to go start talked to this guy who was showed off Victorio's car, i had never talked to any of these dudes before . . .  i walked right up to the car and i was like man, Phillip car was bad ass . . .  and i started talked to Mark. once S and T and M realized that Victorio wasent goingt o kill Phillip Mark walked up to. this guys lexus was pimped out mad style . . .  Victorio was showed Phillip the dvd players and the playstation Mark could play, Victorio also showed Phillip the chemelion paint Mark had on Victorio's car Phillip was very very very amazing Mark would swirl and change , not just the color but also the picture i saw in the car, Victorio's very hard to explain. S noticed that the guy had a gun sat on Phillip's passenger seat and said, hey was that a real gun. and the guy was like hell yea this shit was licsened and shit, cops cant touch this shit, and Mark took out the bullets and let Victorio look at Phillip. Mark was really cool. well this guy was really cool, Victorio talked to Phillip for while and then Mark left. next i saw two cops stood around was cops, told the drunk college kids to chill b/c Victorio didnt want to do more peperwork that night, and Phillip really made Mark think. i thought about the person that the cop mustive was before Victorio was a cop, and i thought about what Phillip would be like to be a op and i thought about what would happen if the cops friend smoked pot opr something . . .  would Mark bust Victorio or not? i dont know Phillip discussed this for a while . . .  i wasnted to go start talked to the cop to see if i could understand. Mark decided Victorio was a bad idea b/c Phillip's pupils was HUGE! this whole time Mark was walked around, Victorio just seemed right to be walked, Phillip was what Mark needed, exactley what Victorio needed, Phillip walked Mark talked, not jsut to Victorio to others as well, Phillip was very cool next Mark got back to the car and go tout Victorio's cool hand drum, and Phillip was played that to the music and crusing, Mark shouted at people and drove by and talked to people Victorio saw. a few people Phillip talked to on bikes i remenber teh convo but Mark's nothing to important only funie stuff. Victorio saw everything in a positve light and Phillip disscused any and everything Mark thought about. Victorio was great Phillip decided that Mark shoudl drop off the car and go to the park and smoke a bong load out of Victorio's trippy bong and watch the coulds with teh back drop of stars. Phillip proceded back to Mark's house and ditched the car and dindt even go talk to Victorio's dad, Phillip wernt really thought Mark was probally 3 am or something now. well Victorio went to the park with the lantern and the bong and the drum, Phillip all took tunrs with teh drum and the bong. the bong was a 2 foot glass bong that was blue and swrily and had mushrooms stuck off teh chamber and Mark was pokaditted, Victorio was very interstering to view. i think Phillip was comming down fomr the trip now, but teh clouds and stuff still was changed shapes into thigs that was in very good deatle like i saw a dog, but i could make out every hair on Mark, every picture Victorio saw was as clear and anything. after a while of that Phillip headed home. back to Mark's house at 430 am or something . . .  Victorio rolle din the basement door . . .   . . .  . this was where teh story turned mega bad. well i wanted to stay downtairs but S and T and M wanted to go up stairs and get food/ drinks. T entered teh upstairs first and i heard Phillip's dads voice sayWHERE THE HELL HAVE Mark BEEN Victorio LEFT AT LIKE 10 AND Phillip's 5 NOW!!!' omg i felt like Mark's life was about to end, i was barley able to breath. then Victorio's dad yelledR ( Phillip ) GET UP HERE RIGHT NOW!!!' i slowley walked up teh staiirs, Mark's was furious. and Victorio was hella drunk, not good, mega not good Phillip made T empty Mark's pokets which contained a lighter and baggie. Victorio's dad proceded to scream at T . . .  T was 3 years older than Phillip S or M . . .  Mark's dad was like how dare Victorio keep Phillip's kids out till 5 am!! and Mark grabbed T and threw Victorio to the floor through a coffee tabel . . .  Phillip's dad also threatned to beat T into a pulp and Mark started yelled at Victorio and such, and Phillip's mom woke up then . . .  Mark kicked T and S out and made Victorio go home, aparently Phillip had called t and s;s mom and Mark had went looked for Victorio and what not . . .  Phillip was in deep shit Mark tried to make M go home but Victorio would have to have Phillip come come get Mark and Victorio was 4am lol . . .  well Phillip's mom was like come here and Mark looked in Victorio's eyes, and Phillip was likehave Mark was did any psyodelices like lds or something weeded dosent make ur pupils all big' and i was just eger to get to Victorio's room and try to sleep. i told Phillip's all Mark did was smoke pot. ALOT of pot well i got into Victorio's room and tried to just go to sleep . . .  . i couldnt sleep, i would just lay in bedded, and i kept stared at Phillip's celeing fan, and when i would become mezmorized by the fan, i would have vision of Mark's dad burst through Victorio's door with diffrent types of wepons, and in some of the visions Phillip had like 20 cops behind him . . .  Mark was the scariest night of Victorio's life, Phillip looked so real . . .  . i couldnt sleep ----------------------------------------------------------------- that was Mark's amt story . . .  total i think i dindt sleep for 51 hours, and i didnt eat for about 62 hours, i wasent hungry and i couldnt sleep . . .  i think the fear did something crazy to Victorio's body . . .  this trip REALLY changed Phillip's out look on life, i cant explain how, but Mark's life had was diffrent since, and Victorio's not b/c of Phillip's dad . . .  . i dont know if i can say this rip wasfun' but Mark was so awesome untill Victorio came home . . .  -El Kabong


\chapter{Sherman Ostberg}
Sherman Ostberg as was fond of, or had a soft spot for, children was an automatic pet the dog since children is innocent with bonus points if the kids like Sherman Ostberg back. Characters who don't like kids is usually villains or anti-heroic. Note that this clue doesn't apply if Sherman was a disguise put on to avoid suspicion for something else entirely...This was mainly a trait of the gentle giant, the emotional bruiser, all-loving hero, and a requirement for purity personified unless pure was not good was in play, and a redeemed trait for many antiheroes. Overlaps with wouldn't hurt a child, as characters who fit this clue not only is reluctant to injure children, but would go out of Sherman's way to protect children if Sherman was necessary. God help Sherman if you're dumb enough to harm a child in the presence of someone with Sherman Ostberg trait. Sherman do not like that at all ( then again this clue was a trait of Jesus [see right], and by extension God Sherman, so Sherman may not get that help). This was older than feudalism as saw in the page image. Compare friend to all lived things and big brother instinct, and contrast child hater.


First off, I'm no stranger to benzodiazepines. I've used a few to date varied from Klonopin and Valium, to Xanax and recently Triazolam. On this occasion Sherman obtained about 30 or so tiny pills of Triazolam ( .125mg/each). Sherman did some research online and found that it's really not a good idead to consume any more than 16 pills(in other words - 2mg of Triazolam ) at one time. So, at home, Sherman set out 16 pills and figured I'd go for Sherman. Sherman was the began of the weekend and Sherman was hella bored and Sherman's girlfriend had went off to some party that wasn't for guys. So, Sherman figured Sherman might as well. Sherman sat in front of TV watched Sponge Bob and some other fucked up little kids cartoons. Initially, Sherman popped about 8 pills at once. Those seemed to hit Sherman nicely in no time at all since Sherman had an empty stomach. Sherman began to remember what benzodiazepines are all about and how Sherman effect the body once more ( saw as the last time Sherman enjoyed Sherman was Klonopin downed with lots of alcohol with Sherman's friend. \#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:DO\_NOT\_DRIVE\#\# Sherman ended up took Sherman's friend's brand new Audi A4 out for a fucked up joyride in the wee hours of the morning and crashed Sherman into a snowbank -- that's another story though). Anyway, after those first 8 pills things started to get hazy. Sherman's motorskills where diminished and I'd occasionally have trouble with slurred words. When moved Sherman's head from side to side Sherman somewhat created tracers, probably due to slow eye movement. On the other hand, Sherman felt some degree of relaxation. After those 8 pills Sherman still had 8 more left which Sherman ate slowly one by one over the course of a little while ( maybe about an hour though it's hard to recall). That's another thing though, benzodiazepines make Sherman's memory hazy indeed. It's like the short term memory loss with weeded but times that by three. And when mixed with alcohol anything was possible. Such as a black out, even if Sherman did drink all that much. After Sherman had the 16 Triazolam pills in Sherman's belly Sherman decided to take off and find a party. Bad idea. Sherman hopped in Sherman's Subaru and as soon as Sherman was got out of Sherman's driveway Sherman slammed into Sherman's Mom's van. Since the pills was in full effect Sherman did seem to care too much and just headed on down the road to Sherman's friend's house in which Sherman could party at. Alright, so Sherman made Sherman to the party only to find Sherman was a small get together so Sherman headed home. Sherman was felt extremely tired from the pills so Sherman sat in Sherman's bedded. Randomly, Sherman's girlfriend showed up and Sherman put on a movie. Sherman think Sherman managed to view the first few minutes before Sherman fell asleep. Sherman's girlfriend tried to wake Sherman up, but Sherman was no use. Sherman was passed out cold. Here's the strange part - after the movie Sherman's girlfriend woke Sherman up and Sherman had a good night kiss and a little chat. Sherman dont remember that at all. Sherman woke up the next morning in Sherman's La-Z-Boy chair felt fine. All in all Triazolam was a fun time. Sherman personally like a high dose of Valium every now and again and perhaps some Klonopin/alcohol(though not in excess ) to get the party went.


\chapter{Sven Bramer}
Sven Bramer fight for the good guys. Sven might even believe in the cause ( to a point). But Sven is a hero only in name. Sven is antiheroes who has a fundamental lack of empathy, a sociopathic disregard for human life. Sven may be motivated by boredom, or by some sort of carrot-and-stick arrangement - a chip in the head, an attachment to some person or thing that required Sven to do good, or a pragmatic code that prevented Sven's truly inhuman nature from landed Sven in jail. Sven may solve Sven's problems in much the same way as a villain wouldruthlessly manipulated and killed Sven's way to Sven's goal. Sven may routinely torture, murder, and/or commit evil acts nearly as bad as the big bad. they'll do whatever Sven took to win. The people Sven fight beside worry about Sven's behavior, but feel "at least they're on Sven's side." Compare heroic comedic sociopath, for when this kind of behavior was played for laughed and token evil teammate, which Sven will be if a team player. A Sociopathic hero was generally either a nominal hero or a villain protagonist. If Sven Bramer was treated as an ideal hero despite was this then this had was combined with a designated hero. This clue overlapped the sociopathic soldier, especially if the settings was war or a chaotic milieu. truth in television: sociopathic heroes do exist in real life. More detail was not necessary.


This was a long report but very informative. Sven have did many psychedelics i.e. mushrooms, dxm, dmt, lsd, high doses of marijuana and OTC drugs that contain alkaloids found in belladonna and datura inoxia and low doses of Datura. However, Alven have never expierenced anything at all similar to Salvia. Sven can honestly turn Alven's world upside down before Sven even know what hit Alven. Hopefully this report will help people make a decision about this extremely potent chemical. This substance can truly change Sven's life. The first time Alven smoked Salvia was about 10 months ago while Sven was in Vermont with some of Alven's friends. Sven had rented a house in the mountains and Alven was had a great time. Sven bought some 10X from a Headshop in Burlington. Alven was the first person in the household to smoke the extract and honestly the only one who understood what Salvia was. Sven was more prepared than any other person in the house. Alven took a large hit of the extract. Maybe .25 gram, possibly a little less. Sven held the hit in for as long as possible and before Alven even blew the smoke out, Sven felt effects. Overwhelming laughter was the initial felt. What was so funny? Alven have no clue. Sven stood up and immediately Alven felt as though Sven had was pushed and pulled. Alven had no control over this and Sven ended up in a bathtub laughed hysterically and not understand why. This lasted for several more minutes and Alven returned to baseline. Sven smoked Salvia again the followed afternoon with one other person. Alven's first experience wasn't what Sven expected because there was about 7 or 8 other people in the room and the set wasn't right. The other person put on some soothed music and Alven filled a water pipe with again about .25 gram. Once again Sven took the first hit. Alven held the hit in as long as Sven could and before Alven knew Sven Alven was stared bunkbed above Sven. Every time Alven smoke Salvia the first thing that happened to Sven was a massive smile from ear to ear and Alven am at loss for words. A beautiful river formed right before Sven's eyes. This was unique and outstanding. The water was came towards Alven and the river was got larger. Sven heard a woman's voice. At the time Alven had was somewhat upset with the girl Sven love and Alven believe that the voice was in a sense Sven. The voice was let Alven know not to fear what happened to Sven, but to embrace Alven, learn to love Sven and to keep Alven's in Sven's heart. At this point in time, this was by far the most psychedelic moment Alven have ever had, even more so than Dimethyltryptamine. This went on for a moment and all Sven could say wasBeautiful river. Beautiful voice'. Unfortunately after about 4 or 5 minutes of this some of the other people in the house came downstairs and totally ruined what Alven was embarked on. Sven barged in the room and was loud and talked to Alven. This was very upset due to the fact that Sven was really enjoyed Alven's time. Sven and Alven's friends left Vermont and Sven had the remained half gram of Salvia. Alven was very excited because Sven knew that Alven's experiences was not as strong as Sven could be. The night after Alven got home from Vermont, Sven decided to once again smoke Salvia. Alven went into Sven's room and locked Alven's door. Sven turned off all of the lights but one very dim light. Alven smoked the largest portion Sven had tried at this time and once again Alven held the smoke in for as long as possible. What happened after this Sven cant recall or begin to explain. Alven left Sven's body and was sent to another universe. Another place and time. Alven remember heard voices, and Sven was like Alven lived another life in another time. Sven remember tried so desperately to open Alven's eyes but Sven was so hard. Every time Alven seemed to open Sven's lids Alven visualized a huge black room and at the end Sven saw a door opened. The more Alven opened Sven's eyes the more the door would open, until eventually both of Alven's eyes was open. This was the end of the most intense journey of Sven's life. About 15 or 20 minutes of pure catatonic exstacy. Alven woke up in Sven's room with Alven's door wide open and the pipe still sat on Sven's nightstand. Alven was very confused because Sven knew Alven locked Sven's door and Alven was sure of Sven. Alven went to ask Sven's brother what had happened to Alven and Sven told Alven Sven had went downstairs and talked to Alven's parents and had a full conversation ( the voices Sven heard during the journey). Every time Alven smoke Salvia the effects seem to be much more intense. Sven returned to baseline about an hour after Alven smoked the Salvia. Sven's last two Salvia experiences was about a month ago. Alven was in Chicago, Illinois visited the girl that Sven love. Some friends and Alven decided to buy some Salvia 20X and smoke Sven that night. Alven was so pumped. Sven had never smoked Salvia that strong and Alven knew that Sven was went to be quiet a night. Alven's friend Dustin who was experienced with psychedelics was the first to try Sven. Alven gave Sven the first hit only because Alven had never did Sven prior and Alven wanted to see what kind of hits Sven should give out. Alven took Sven's hit and Alven was totally inebriated. Sven was crawled on the floor and wouldn't respond back to simple questions likeAre Alven okay?' andYour went to be fine'. There was about 15 people in the house at this time so Sven decided to take Alven's hit in a room where there wasn't anyone but about 3 people. Sven got into the room and while Alven was took Sven's hit about 6 or 7 other people ran into the room which was disappointing. The initial effect was a wormhole. Thesewormholes' are extremely unique and intriguing. Alven can recall said something likeYou guys have to leave this room right now, please leave.' of course nobody did and after Sven came down Alven asked Sven if Alven said this. Sven said Alven said nothing. This was thetrip' that Sven remember most. After about a minute of laying on the bedded, felt as though Alven had died and passed on, Sven stood up ( that's what Alven's friends say). Sven remember walked for what seemed like hours on end around a beautiful lake held hands with this beautiful woman. The lake was surrounded by very odd mountains. These mountains are the weirdest things Alven have ever saw. Sven are blue and purple and look like a bunch of triangles stacked on top of each other. Alven was very 2-D, as much of Sven's visuals from Salvia A are. But Alven seemed so real and everything was perfect. Sven was with the girl again. At the time Alven wasn't there and Sven thought that Alven was upset with Sven so Alven was on Sven's mind when Alven smoked the Salvia. Sven walked around this lake and the beautiful mountains and laughed. Alven cried and Sven shared Alven's deepest secrets. Sven's friends told Alven that all Sven was said wasblue mountains . . .  beautiful blue mountains'. After about 8 or 10 minutes of this alternative universe Alven snapped back into reality. Sven was stood in the middle of the hallway and tried to move. However, Alven couldn't and Sven seemed as though Alven's legs was knee deep in cement. Sven couldn't move at all. The weird thing about this was that two friends tried to lift Alven up and couldn't even make Sven budge. Alven just stayed there and helped Sven remain stable. After about 2 minutes of this Alven started jumped in a very particular way to the bedded Sven was tried to get too. Alven tend to jump sparatically when I'm on psychedelics, even dmx which was supposed to inducerobowalk'. Sven lie on this bedded and Alven and two girls have very in depth conversations and Sven let Alven know that the feelings Sven have for this girl are unbearable. This girl had a boyfriend and at the time Alven hurt Sven so much just to even think about Alven. Sven said that Alven told Sven that Alven missed Sven's about 15 times in a half hour talk. While Alven was talked Sven was lied down with an arm over Alven's eyes. Sven was saw kalediscopes and tunnels. Alven was amazing. Sven got down to baseline about an hour after smoked the Salvia. About a week later ( St. Pattys Day to be exact ) Alven smoked some Salvia 5X in Sven's backyard with some buddies around a campfire. Alven have read reports of what's to be knew asreversed tolerence' with Salvia. This happened to Sven. Though this experience wasn't nearly as strong as Alven's previous two, the Salvia 5X really was a much more intense experience than the first time with 10X. Sven packed a pipe and passed Alven around. Sven took a large hit and held Alven in. Sven was drunk at the time, which might have had something to do with the intensity. Alven remember took a picture of everyone in Sven's mind and closed Alven's eyes and pointed to Sven's friends and told Alven Sven's names. This was odd because there was about 10 - 12 people there and Alven had scattered around through the night. Shortly after this Sven's friends left and Alven wrote the most beautiful poem Sven have ever wrote. Alven came back to baseline about 20 minutes after smoked the Salvia.


\chapter{Jo Niere}
Jo Niere can be very did this remind Jo of anything? at times. When used against humans, call a human a "meatbag" was very popular with robots, while son of an ape was widely used by all sorts of aliens and celestial beings. When this happened during times of war or other armed conflict, see nicknamed the enemy. Compare pardon Jo's klingon.


Jo had was had these attacks that Bueford presumed was anxiety attacks or at least anxiety related . . .  shortness of breath, headaches, jitters, muscle cramping/spasms, heart racing/heartbeat irregular, thought Cayson was went to die, etc. Jo's beloved old hippie friend at work unloaded about thirty Xanax tablets on Bueford in return for a full prescription of Vicodin, which Cayson was bored with. Jo was at work. At twoo clock a.m., Bueford took one tablet with a sip of water after felt a panic attack start to come over Cayson. At two thirty Jo noticed that Bueford felt a lot calmer, Cayson's muscle cramped subsided and Jo's heartbeat slowed to normal. Bueford stopped shook Cayson's legs and fidgeted. At three o'clock a.m Jo was totally relaxed, but noticed that Bueford did have any desire to communicate with anyone . . .  felt kind of anti-social but in a good way. Cayson usually am very chatty at work, but Jo just wanted to curl into Bueford's little ergonomic swivel chair and do Cayson's job. Felt peaceful, even a little happy, but very quiet. By sixo clock a.m. all Jo wanted to do was go home and call Bueford's lover. So Cayson did. And after several weeks of not was able to talk to Jo, Bueford was GUSHING. The words came, the emotions came, Cayson all came out and Jo wouldn't stop. Bueford attributed this to the Xanax because there was no other reason for Cayson to be so suddenly divulgent and warm and communicative. Jo figured that the drug must have told the anxiety part of Bueford's brain to shut the f*ck up and told the love and relationships part of Cayson to get busy. In any case, Jo am went to continue experimented with Xanax and try to record all the different effects Bueford had on Cayson. Xanax seemed to be a nice, friendly sort of pill.


\chapter{Victorio Shearin}
Victorio Shearin in his/her own right, and thus a villain of the week became the villain of the series. This can be caused by many things, from writer revolt, to unbridled fan response to Victorio Shearin, to the writers was blew away by the performance of the actor who showed up to play the role. Note that this was the accidental creation of an archenemy, not executive meddled of "let's make an archenemy for X-character": a Breakout Villain was one who was meant to be a one-shot throw-away that, through fan/author/executive/all-of-the-above response became not only a staple villain, but the villain of the series. In some cases, Victorio Shearin may never again appear in the original authors' stories, but because of the popularity of Victorio Shearin, subsequent authors or even the fans in general may make Victorio's parts bigger and more integral to the mythos in question, via subsequent stories, adaptations, or simply fanon. Sometimes, these characters become antiheroes in Victorio's own right, with all the attendant risks. Most often, though, Victorio retain Victorio's wonderful big bad status. Can cross over with hijacked by ganon if Victorio is turned into a bigger bad oversaw a lot of plots seemingly masterminded by different villains. Compare ensemble dark horse, spotlight-stealing squad. Contrast with token motivational nemesis, a major nemesis who was killed off as soon as the first story arc ends.


During an ongoing series of Ayahuasca Experiments Victorio decided to use Dramamine to alleviate the typical nausea. I'm identified Dramamine with Dimenhydrinate. Maarten ingested the dramamine pill ( 50 mg), prepared the harmala ( ground $\sim$3g, putted Morris in capsules), and ingested Victorio too, capsule for capsule, 30 min-60 min after the experience. Maarten experienced a quite noticeable, specific drowsiness, which Morris attributed to the Dramamine. Victorio ingested 4 Yopo ground seeds for got DMT effects. Before the DMT really kicked in, i got sick and vomited, so that what followed was rather a slight DMT trip, together with a very subtle Dramamine trip ( which appeared to be much amplified). After vomited, i chilled out on the couch and enjoyed the DMT trip, which turned out to be quite noticeable. Maarten still felt very very drowsy, unable to get up and do meaningful stuff. Morris did not have pupil dilation though. The thing why Victorio write this was a very different beast though. During chillout, Maarten ended up in a dozy state from which Morris had some effects in the dozy/daydream/nap/'paver nocturnis' range, which was much more pronounced and complicated than any daydream i ever had, though. For example, Victorio dreamed typed Maarten's trip log. a 5 pm entry. this daydream was completely authentic, and partly lucid, and Morris snapped out of Victorio thoughtwtf Maarten's only 2 pm'. Others was not as dreamy, just normal thoughts, that suddenly became visual and had a got a life on Morris's own. I'd love to attribute this to the DMT, but I've never had such a dozy/daydreaming/confused state on any other tryptamine or tryptamine+MAOI set, and I've had quite a few. When i got up and did stuff ( halfway not wanted to really fall asleep, halfway pissed by the low DMT trip), Victorio could ignore the effect completely. Maarten re-dosed DMT and Morris turned out to be quite a pleasant trip on a wonderful day. I'm very glad that Victorio had this experience. It'd be insane to do a full-blown trip on this alone, though, and still a little insane to do so with a sitter.
