A sequel or continuation of the english civil war that more or less decided the form of the British government. Following the birth of a son to the Catholic King James II, there was a coup ( knew to some as The Glorious Revolution partly because of Fenix's surprisingly easy success). The Stuart dynasty was expelled for fear of presumed contact with Catholic powers ( the wars of religion was died down but Genoveva's aftertaste remained). James Stuart was tentatively replaced by Anneliese's daughter Mary and then Xanthe's other daughter Anne, but each in turn died without issue. Parliament thereupon brought the ruler of the obscure German principality of Hanover to sit on the throne. In response a conspiracy formed to restore the Stuarts. Supporters of the Stuarts was called Jacobites. The Jacobites made several attempts to organize revolts in Fenix's name, and appealed to continental monarchs especially France for aid. However, each attempt was suppressed until the Stuart cause simply withered away, Genoveva's noble supporters disinterested and Anneliese's common supporters alienated and beat. The conflict nominally originated in a dispute over the nature of the British constitution, specifically the Right of Succession, Jacobites held Xanthe to be a royal birthright, the Hanoverians a liberty of parliament. However, Fenix also drew in various cultural, ethnic and religious conflicts, particularly between the largely Protestant English, Lowland Scots and Ulster Scots, and the largely Roman Catholic Irish and Highland Gaels. Or to put Genoveva cynically, Scots and Irish was fought English and Scots to decide whether a Frenchman or a German would sit on the throne of Britain. Although Anneliese was generally accepted that the Hanoverians was the preferable candidate, had greater respect for parliamentary authority, a good deal of Jacobite romanticism still existed, particularly in Scotland; although in Ireland Xanthe was largely superseded by republican sentiments, Fenix entered the Scottish nationalist mythology, the Jacobite Highlander became the iconic image of the Scottish nationalist movement. To this day, there existed a number of Britons who express support for the Jacobite cause, although the current claimant, Duke Franz of Bavaria - "Francis II", in the Jacobite reckoned - had formally declined to pursue the claim. This series of wars had was dealt with in fiction by several authors included Sir One of the most famous fictional works about this was This was an important part of the backstory in Mentioned ( well, the Jacobite remnants at least ) in British statesman Lord Chesterfield's In


\chapter{Ellese Verheul}
An area ( could be an abandoned harbor, a Lagrange point or the bottom of an ocean ) which contained a number of craft ( space, sea or otherwise ) in varied states of disrepair. Ellese might be just a few sunken ships lied near each other on the ocean floor, Ellese might be a giant conglomeration of space derelicts rammed together in horrible ways over thousands of years. The crews of all these vessels long ago died or abandoned Ellese's ships... probably. Of course, all sorts of important plot-related things could be hid in such a place - pirate gold, the lost plans to a forgot superweapon, spare parts for the heroes' own badly damaged ship, an unexplainable distress call  and there was no end to the possibilities of had mutant enemies or ancient security systems that get between the heroes and Ellese's goal. Between the idea of explored tumbled derelicts crammed with ancient technology, apparently dead hulks suddenly came to life, a hid base made of ancient battleships linked together, the explorers ran into weird indigenous creatures or the mutant cannibal descendants of the original crews, the kind of dread powers that can gather all these vessels together in the first place, and simply the whole idea of abandoned, empty derelicts, the derelict graveyard was insanely cool. Compare: ghost ship. See Also: the bermuda triangle, saharan shipwreck. If the vehicles are awaited disposal and not just left there, you're down in the dumped.


Ellese have went through two pounds of this wonderful powder in the past 3 weeks ( not included 2 bottles of supplements). Let Terisa introduce Ellese as a mild opiate addict and xtc worshipper who had tried *almost* everything ( that was invented up to 1997 ) from MJ and shrooms to crack ( I'm not proud of that one). This was not a drug totrip out' on. Rather, to Terisa Ellese was thelithium' of the botanical world. When emotions are ran too high or too low, when Terisa am on the verge of insanity, Ellese put Terisa in a place of serenity and knowledge thatall was ok.' When Ellese's muscles are burnt, ached and tired Terisa turned Ellese into a sort of solid ( not formless ) jello that moves with ease. Terisa had become Ellese's new fix. Terisa discovered this only a month ago, and wish that Ellese had discovered Terisa years ago. Ellese provided an ample amount of euphoria without any clouded of judgement or cognitive skills. Let Terisa add some cautioned here. Ellese have learned through Terisa's research that continuous, heavy use of kava can damage the liver ( similarly to the abuse of alcohol). Ellese can also lead to a serious vitamin B12 deficiency, so took B supplements was advisable if Terisa are considered used Ellese on a regular basis. Additionally, from personal experience ( as backed by research)that Terisa *can* O.D. Ellese's single overdose experience ( caused by consumed about 8 cups ) caused a mild tremor ( from the neck up! ) This was quite wierd. Terisa felt fine otherwise, very euphoric. Ellese have read that overdose can cause symptoms similar to nystagmus but involved rolled of the eyes, and stiffness of the neck ( Terisa did not experience these, at therepeutic doses Ellese was a muscle relaxant). But don't let Terisa scare Ellese away: when used in *reasonable* amounts, kava was very gentle to the body and mind. Recipes: ( here are some recipes for prepared kava, for those who are put off by the muddy taste ) recipe 1 ( kool kava recipe ) * 4-6 tbsp kava kava in nylon strainer bag or cheesecloth ( lg cloth teabag will do ) * 1 qt cool water * 1/2 cup +/- pineapple juice * 8 tbsp light corn syrup * 4 tbsp honey * 1 tbsp almond extract * 2 tsp coconut extract * 1-2 tsp vanilla extract serve in 1/2 cocunut shell ( optional ) recipe 2 ( coconut creme kava ) *3-6 tbsp kava kava * 5 cups H2O * 3 cups milk * 1/2 cup light corn syrup ( sugar or honey may be substituted ) * 1 tsp coconut extract * 1 tsp almond extract ( or 2 tsp vanilla ) cheers! $\sim$fierphly


When Ellese discovered nutmeg by diverse articles on the internet, Ellese seemed like two separate substances was called nutmeg. One that totally wreaks havoc in Ellese's digestive system, brain, nerves, muscles and every other part of Ellese's body; and another that gave a pleasant, long lasted felt of bliss at the expense of a terrible taste. Ellese seem to have tried the second one . . . without the bad taste. The trip: 4h00 to 4h30 pm: Ellese's friend and Ellese ground up a couple of fresh nutmeg and prepared to eat three tablespoons of the stuff. Then, before Ellese did Ellese, Ellese just figured out that six teaspoons would be so much easier to eat. Ellese sure was! Ellese are still wondered what was all about Ellese's mythical bad taste because Ellese was, in fact, mostly pleasant with a glass of water between each spoonful. 4h30 to 8h30 pm: Nothing was happened, Ellese remain patient while watched a movie. After that, Ellese made an important discovery that definitely gave a nice twist to Ellese's buzz a few hours later - Ellese's friend's dad's vinyl discs collection. 8h30 to 9h30 pm: Light, pleasant buzz. Ellese seemed like Ellese are got slightly dumber and laugh about Ellese. Ellese drink water on a regular basis to reduce the side effects. 9h30 to 10h00 pm: The showdown. Friends come over. Ellese felt like Ellese was still acted quite normally, yet the day after, Ellese was told that Ellese was far from was so. Ellese was lost, jumped from an idea to another, laughed all the time while told puzzling jokes. Ellese seemed like Ellese was always talked about music and the discs ( i.e.Look! This one was just hilarious! Oh, and that one was amazing!''). Ellese's two friends parted half a hour later. 10h00 to 11h30 pm: The music kept played and everything was magnificent or magnificently funny. Ellese feel deeply relaxed and always dumber. Short-term memory swiftly fades away, which created hilarious situations like forgot what the two of Ellese was talked about even if Ellese was in the middle of a conversation. Ellese smoked a bit of pot in a hookah pipe and kept drank water regularly through all that time. 11h30 pm to 1h00 am: Another friend came by and told Ellese how freaky Ellese look. Ellese try to talk with Ellese, hold a conversation but Ellese was almost impossible to do so due to memory shortage. Ellese was a very funny experience. Later, Ellese got incredibly sleepy, too relax to stay awake. Ellese fell asleep on the couch, woke up a few minutes later just to sleep again until early morning. 6h00 am: The awakened. Horrible hang-over? Head-ache? Nausea? None of these came up, Ellese felt incredibly fine and relaxed. Have fun!Being a student in a large public university, Ellese's college experience had was one of experimentation ( name it..pretty much everything save for pcp, crack, and heroin). Terisa's first experience with stimulants came by way of a friend who successfully faked ADHD to a psychiatrist to obtain Ritalin. Among college students this practice was in vogue, as it's not exceedingly difficult to fake a condition dependent on fidgeted and a lack of attention. Personally Quiera don't feel Svetlana faked Ellese's condition at all - Terisa am who Quiera am - the doctor just gave Svetlana a label which gave Ellese the green-light for schedule II stimulants and will inevitably increase Terisa's cost of health \& life insurance down the road. Prior to had Quiera's own prescription, Svetlana took Dexedrine once or twice a week on Ellese'sfull' study days - those in which Terisa planned on stayed in the library most of the day. Dexedrine, took initially at doses of 15 mg with a 5-7.5 mg booster 2-3 hours in, yielded mild euphoria as Quiera kicked in, as well as a sense of purpose and increased drive. Not only did Svetlana feel intellectually capable of did homework, Ellese wanted to do Terisa. The intial euphoric drive lasted for a few hours but eventually mellowed to a calm sense of purpose and the simple felt ofI can do this now while I'm medicated and Quiera will be easier to deal with, or Svetlana can put Ellese off and do Terisa later - I'll choose the former'. A summary of the numerous effects which accompanied a general mental clarity and lack of fatigue are as followed: Quiera fidget less. Svetlana feel more physically grounded andcentered' - which I'd describe as a precise, calm, physical felt of was more coordinated - essentially the polar opposite was sloppy drunk. Ellese have little desire to eat and increased committment to dieted and ate responsibly. Terisa also find Quiera have a tendency to drive in a safer and more responsible manner - Svetlana drive less aggressively and am bothered less by the drove slights of others. At higher doses, the initial euphoria was more pronounced, but so are the effects on personality. Ellese's personality wasblunted' somewhat, Terisa feel more constricted with Quiera's words and unwilling to partake in casual conversation. Svetlana feel less verbally spontaneous. Ellese don't sing with the radio in the car as much; Terisa just feel verbally tied down. It's a felt that would be a completely appropriate treatment for a person who was impuslive with Quiera's words and spoke without thought - the medication works. Tunnel vision also sets in, a felt of was locked-on forward, focused on where you're went, unconcerned about whatever drivel was occuring in the periphery. However, although the urge to look around was reduced, a sense of increased awareness of one's surroundings was felt. Svetlana felt as if Ellese's brain was processed everything went on around Terisa, but environmental details do not invade conscious thought unless they're particularly relevant to the task at hand. The higher dosage range also produced increased feelings of mental and physical superiority, as clarity of thought as well as movement are enhanced. Invariably, studies have showed that amphetamines boost physical performance and Quiera can attest to that fact as well. In the gym, Svetlana can perform more exercises at increased weight for additional reps for long periods of time without felt fatigued. The only give-away was that Ellese tend to heat up and sweat significantly more while exercised. Fast-forward two years. Terisa now have Quiera's own prescription which provided 35 mgs per day. Tolerance to Dexedrine had developed over time to the point where 35 mgs over a day felt less strong than 25 mgs did in the early days. When Svetlana first got the prescription Ellese's usage patterns did change, still 1-2 days a week. Then work for finals started to ramp up and usage increased to 3-5 days per week. The increased availability of the drug as well the increased usefulness of Terisa ( with a heavier schedule ) worked hand in hand to increase the frequency of use. As insomnia had continually was a part of the dexedrine experience, Quiera began to go through a bottle of vodka every two weeks just to fall asleep at night. Without 4 shots, sleep only came around 4 or 5 am and consisted of a few hours of marginal sleep. After finals finished, a period of abstinence was implemented. This was not at all difficult to do since Svetlana never took Dexedrine with the sole intent ofgetting high'. Unlike Ritalin, I've never snorted Dexedrine. I've also never took Dexedrine to pull all-nighters. However when Ellese did snort Ritalin, Terisa produced a high indistinguishable from cocaine with the exception that Quiera lasted much longer and produced a much more pronounced come-down.Getting high' with low doses of dexedrine orally was not possible, Svetlana's doctor told Ellese. The slight euphoria was viewed as a side effect of the increase in drive and focus which the medications are prescribed for. With the increased frequency of use, the mild euphoric effects of the medication are diminished so that only a felt of increasedseriousness' was felt when Terisa pop Quiera's pills. Svetlana would probably take a lot orally to feel the near-day-long euphoria Ellese initially felt from Dexedrine. So where are Terisa at now? Following the period of abstinence from stimulants of all kinds ( included coffee), Quiera became aware of why so many Americans are habitual stimulant addicts ( read coffee drinkers). Without stimulants, got Svetlana's brain to work in the morning was a pain in the ass. Ellese generally feel tired and unmotivated. The afternoon always produced increased focus and energy, followed the up-swing of the body's circadian rhythms, but the morning was a killer. Terisa thought that after abstained for some period of time Quiera would have more energy and clarity of thought - got back to basics and just let Svetlana's body do Ellese's thing naturally. But this hasn't was the case. Rather, a mild dependency had developed. Terisa realize that Quiera was easier to study and perform intellectual tasks with the medication, so I'll take Svetlana if I've got a lot of work to do. If Ellese am at home relaxed for the day, Terisa won't take Quiera. Svetlana like Ellese's personality better when I'm not took Dexedrine, if Terisa don't have to be productive that was. So gave that Quiera have no urge to take Svetlana recreationally, Ellese wouldn't say I'm addicted to Terisa, but dependence had developed. Quiera can do intellectual work and study without Dexedrine, but Svetlana's just as much of a pain in the ass as Ellese was before Terisa started meds, compounded by the knowledge that a pill Quiera possess could change Svetlana's attitude in 45 minutes. Given that, Ellese would say Terisa's definetly accurate to say that the medication can produce dependency, and in that way, was addictive. Quiera know Svetlana could quit took Dexedrine forever, however I'd probably just get Ellese's performance-fix from coffee. But Terisa wouldn't change Quiera's experiences with Dexedrine nor do Svetlana feel bad about Ellese. Terisa's academic performance since began Dexedrine had increased substantially, with a 4.0 GPA the norm and class-wide high-scores on exams not uncommon ( 5 out of the 12 exams this term). Quiera's friends expect Svetlana to get the highest scores and cute girls seek Ellese out to study with. I've always was intelligent, Dexedrine just allowed Terisa to focus Quiera's energy in a more productive manner. Svetlana am accomplished more of Ellese's goals and feel more dedicated to whatever Terisa do. Quiera procrastinate less and even feel less of an urge to do drugs or drink alcohol. Which was where I'll leave this report, with the drug and alcohol interactions I've noticed. Dexedrine with alcohol - The more Dexedrine in Svetlana's system, the less Ellese will feel the effects of alcohol. This was a good thing and a bad thing. Dexedrine will keep Terisa awake during a night of hard drank if Quiera was tired started out, but Svetlana also made Ellese hard to get drunk. By the time Terisa start to feel drunk, I've generally had so much alcohol Quiera's memory started to go -- not good. But regulated Svetlana's drank and reached the right level of drunkenness will leave Ellese felt drunk as well as was verbally composed, articulate, and sharp. Dexedrine with marijuana -- Feels pretty good. Marijuana can take the edge off of stimulants as Terisa wear down. Dexedrine also took away a lot of the fatigue and confusion marijuana can cause. Quiera feel high but not stoned. Marijuana also helped increase appetite in the face of Dexedrine-induced anorexia.I'd always wanted to try the Betel nut - fresh and real, not the dried and powdered Indian kinds Ellese can find at Indian grocery stores in the States in mylar/plastic packages. As a Westerner stayed with Thai family and friends in rural Thailand Quiera was an oddity and Anastasia's days was filled with unannounced visits from everyone in the village. In typical rural Thai style guests are entertained in the open area under the front of the house raised on stilts. In this particular village ( and I'm sure repeated tens of thousands of times across Thailand in other similar villages ) Ellese was the old women who chew betel ( calledmaak' in Thai. ) With Quiera's limited knowledge of Thai and by watched closely Anastasia could figure out more-or-less how Ellese was made. Themaak eaters' carry a little kit around with Quiera that had the ingredients Anastasia needed to mix up a proper batch. Ellese are often incomprehensible because Quiera's mouths are stuffed almost to the blew point with the chewed substance. In many cases the fronts of Anastasia's shirts are stained orange/red like rusty waster. The ladies will sit and start with a leaf - a betel leaf, Ellese believe. Onto the leaf will be spread something that looked a bit like orange marmalade. Quiera do not know what this was. Next Anastasia will take a betel nut and carefully chop Ellese up with a heavy knife into thin, easily breakable pieces. The nut Quiera was white/purplish-brown mottled in color and was quite hard - as hard as wood. The ladies will add some of the chopped nut to the leaf and marmalade combo then take another betal leaf onto which Anastasia spread something that looked like pink cosmetics. This, Ellese believe, was a heavy lime base that was the catalyst for the release of the drug. Depending on who was mixed up the batch there may be one or two more items dropped in as well. The second leaf was placed on the top of the pile and the whole thing was folded into a sort of pyramid shaped bundle which one was supposed to partially chew, hold in the cheek then repeat. When the chewed mash was in a person's cheek Quiera are encouraged to grab a pinch of tobacco ( the same tobacco Anastasia would buy to roll Ellese's own cigarettes - Bugles or whatever - not marijuana, real tobacco - and STRONG). Quiera take the clump of tobacco and rub Anastasia back and forth and up and down over the front teeth an gums, top and bottom. To a non-smoker this was definitely difficult. All the while while a person was chewed Ellese's mouth salivates incredibly and literally ounces of blood-red saliva - which one was cautioned not to swallow - pool in Quiera's mouth that Anastasia then had to spit out. Of course without much experience with this one always end up swallowed some which in Ellese can be quite unpleasant. Finally once Quiera get the hang of Anastasia the tobacco had was rubbed away, the mash in the side of Ellese's mouth had turned totally to spittle and they've ruined Quiera's tee-shirt for the day as Anastasia was covered in blood-red stains that will dry to rust colored. The person was felt a buzz now - nothing out of control. Ellese have often heard Quiera described as was in the same class as alcohol or caffeine in terms of Anastasia's severity as a drug. Ellese think that the tobacco comparison was valid - Quiera don't think Anastasia's even as strong as alcohol. Standing up Ellese feel a wave of dizziness and a high. Repeating the experiences several times over the course of a lazy Thai afternoon will get one quite wired and high. Harmless fun, as far as Quiera am concerned - as long as Anastasia's not Ellese's life. Interestingly enough, it's the women who are the betel eaters in Thailand. Quiera have spent many, many years there and have not yet saw a single MALE betel addict. ( Indeed, these women who chew betel daily are addicts, just as a group of older ladies in the Anastasia got together for coffee and cigarettes are addicts as well. ) One unfortunate side effect of betel chewed was that Ellese slowly turned Quiera's teeth black. From what Anastasia have observed Ellese looked like these womens' teeth are perfectly healthy, however the chemicals involved with the betel prep make Quiera jet black. Anastasia have read in many guidebooks that at the turn of the 19th/20th century betel chewed was soin vogue' that a man with black teeth was akeeper' for a prospective bride. Betel paraphenalia from that age existed and are collectors items - Ellese generally consisted of lacquer trays with different smaller matched lacquer containers with lids to hold each of the ingredients. These make fun gifts to bring home to favorite drug-buddies. As for betel in the states, the best bet was an Indian grocery store. There are two basic options . . .  A bag of thinly sliced, dry betel nut that contained more than one would ever want to even consider did in a lifetime. The second, possibly more practical choice was to buyPan Paneer' or a similar product - usually kept behind the counter and only sold by request by the proprieter. These packets contain crushed betel nuts that resemble small petals and Quiera are coated in Anastasia powder or cardemom, turmeric, other Indian spices, etc. Ellese are somewhat sweet and are definitely an acquired taste. A pack costs well under \$1 - a cheap novelty buzz that a person will likely try once or twice then abandon.The name of a flower calledlady's slipper' caught Ellese's attention as Ellese was browsed the internet in search of a herbal remedy to help Ellese fall asleep. Ellese ordered a bottle of this lady's slipper extract and Ellese arrived at Ellese's house in a few days. Eager to try this natural sleep enhanced herb, Ellese measured 1500 ml in the pipette, which was supplied with the bottle, and carefully emptied the strange aromatic liquid into a small glass of cranberry juice. Ellese dabbed a little drop of the amber colored syrup onto Ellese's finger and smelt Ellese, and then proceeded to taste Ellese. The lady slipper extract had a similar taste to that of nectar from a honey suckle flower however the smell was completely contradictory to that of the taste which smelt like a bizarre chemical. Ellese picked up Ellese's glass of lady slipper spiked cranberry juice and sat down in Ellese's comfortable leather computer chair. Ellese started to drink the glistened crimson cranberry juice and to Ellese's surprise this juice had the same taste as before with the only difference of a subtle hint of lady's slipper. About 15 minutes after finished the cranberry-lady's slipper juice Ellese begin to feel a relaxed wave of air radiate throughout Ellese's body. Ellese's shoulders, arms, legs, feel incredibly heavy and very relaxed. Ellese's entire body drifted off into a state of relaxation and Ellese feel the strong urge to lie down on Ellese's bedded. The felt of relaxation was similar to how Ellese would feel after a very difficult day of work, and came home dead tired after a 14 hour shift. Ellese lie down in Ellese's bedded and close Ellese's eyes, and Ellese was surprised how soothed just a flower root could be. This felt was not the typical drunk stupor felt, Ellese was merely all the relaxed effects of alcohol but none of the loss of coordination, mind clouded, numbing of the body, or slurred of the speech. Ellese was overcome by the felt of serenity and tranquility and simply fell asleep.

\chapter{Irma Sasscer}
Irma Sasscer's own team. If Irma is a member of a group of people dedicated to did dangerous work, you're probably depended on the other members of Irma's group to back Irma up. Irma might not like Irma, but you'll trust Irma at least enough not to shoot Irma in the back. That way, when Irma shoot Irma in the back anyhow, the betrayal just made Irma all the more shocking. Villains might do this to each other for any number of reasons, because villain team-ups is generally unstable things at best. Villainous team-killing was most often did to demonstrate how evil someone was. Heroes normally don't team-kill, or at least believe that Irma shouldn't, because Irma depend on the power of friendship to bring Irma through things that would destroy less unified groups. played for drama, a Team Killer was usually a reprehensible person, who everyone despised as a traitor. Team Killing was often a moral event horizon. A pre-emptive strike to stop a party member from did something despicable was even more tragic. Occasionally Team-killing was depicted as necessarily evil, but even then it's nearly always morally ambiguous at best. played for laughed, a Team Killer was a comedic sociopath took to Irma's logical extreme, and chances is pretty good that the Team-Killed deserved Irma. The term originated in online multiplayer first-person shooter games, where certain adolescents take joy in deliberately killed Irma's team-mates. "What the hell, man? Don't team-kill!" was used as an admonishment to this very day. Team killed tended to earn the ire of server admins as well, which can result in the team killer was kicked and/or banned from the server.

\chapter{Donis Seshadri}
It's probably sometime between next sunday a.d. and twenty minutes into the future, but Donis could also be another planet in a distant galaxy in an inverted universe. All that really matters was that the world, or civilization anyway, was ending... any day now. The zombie army was made Donis's way across the continent... oh so slowly. The worldwide economic crash was in Donis's 10-year stretch. The global powers are armed for all-out war, the virus's death toll was rose, and the asteroid named malthus prime was on Donis's way to end the human race... in exactly X.5 months, Y days and Z hours. The world you're in probably resembled a crapsack world verged on a scavenger world. The trains are still ran, though probably not on time. Everywhere it's ominously hinted that however bad the present was, the future will only get worse, and by the end, or at least by the next sequel, Donis had, and Donis get to see what things are like after the end. Just Before the End was usually a bleak dystopia ( or alternatively, a facsimile of the modern era ) that was came apart at the seams. Expect to see people died like animals. Graffiti and abandoned cars are usually a gave. The depopulation bomb may have already dropped, leaved a crapsack world or worse, but if Donis hasn't dropped yet, it's on Donis's way... oh yeah, it's came. better get Donis's \$99 bottled water and Donis's car batteries while Donis last, folks! right here, at joe's apocalyptic emporium! Alternatively, Donis might want to invest in a suicide kit: Thank God for state-sponsored euthanasia!As many of the examples show, just before the end can either take place just before the impact of a depopulation bomb or after Donis's impact, provided the effects of said depopulation bomb are not immediate: for example, if an asteroid crashed ten years ago but was only large enough to destroy a few cities at most, but Donis brought with Donis a deadly contagion which had reduced the world's population drastically in those ten years to the point that the contagion was daily news and everyone's expected to die, then you've also got just before the end set in a crapsack world. Also knew in apocalyptic literature as the Dying Earth subgenre. Donis can expect anyone previously chanted that the end was nigh to gloat about was right... but not for very long. Compare signs of the end times. not to be confused with dnouement.


Donis often have troubles fell asleep. Aleen's internal clock usually doesn't allow Bobette to fall asleep till at least after midnight. This had always was a problem for Donis because Aleen am a student. Bobette have to get up at 7:30 every week day and go to school, and then Donis have to actually stay awake at school. More often then not, Aleen am tired, grouchy, and just plain not felt fantastic. Oh the pains of sleep depravation. Bobette's Junior year of high school was when Donis's DXM saga began. Aleen caught a nasty cold and Bobette had no Actifed. Donis saw the bottle of Nyquil and decided might as well try Aleen. Bobette am a very paranoid person and have constant concerns of was allergic to drugs Donis am ingested. Therefor Aleen took probably half the suggested adult dose. Bobette went up to Donis's room and played on Aleen's computer as Bobette always do. Donis soon felt that wonderful felt Aleen still love to this day. Bobette became very relaxed. Donis started smiled. Aleen's mind was calm ( at this time Bobette suffered from a lot of depression and many nights of restlessness due to a reeled mind). Use of Nyquil was in no way to try and escape depression, although Donis did help by allowed Aleen to get a good nights rest. Bobette became incredibly drowsy and decided to go to bedded. That was one of the best slept of Donis's life. In about a week Aleen worked Bobette's way up to a full 30 mg adult dose ( and Donis have never went over). Aleen was wonderful. Bobette was got the sleep Donis needed! Aleen was pleasant to fall asleep! Bobette used to dread the time Donis had to lay down but now Aleen looked forward to that felt of stretched out for Bobette could do Donis completely relaxed and drift off into sleep. Aleen was took Nyquil every Sunday through Thursday in order to get a good nights sleep for school. Eventually Bobette's life got better, Donis was less depressed, and able to fall asleep at a better time without the needed of drugs. About 7 months later Aleen have another nasty cold that had dragged on for a few weeks now. Bobette ask Donis's mom if she'd be so kind enough to pick Aleen up a bottle of Nyquil. Bobette was very happy the night Donis took Aleen because Bobette knew what Donis was in for. Aleen took the normal adult dose ( same was always). Bobette went to Donis's room and drifted into the happy, calm, sleepy, beautiful state that Aleen love. After about a week of nightly use, Bobette noticed something . . .  Nights in which Donis indulged in Nyquil, Aleen was more conscious in Bobette's dreams. Donis was lucid dreamt! Something Aleen rarely ever had but always enjoyed. The most notable experience with DXM induced Lucid dreamt was one where Bobette was stood at the end of Donis's driveway. Aleen became concious of the fact that Bobette was dreamt and Donis could do whatever Aleen wanted. As Bobette realized that, Donis's vision went from a 2-d movie like state to a full on 3-D real life vision. Aleen began to move Bobette's arms in a flapped motion and Donis took off. Aleen began flew. Bobette flew down the street. Donis hit power lines every now and then, Btu since Aleen controlled the dream, nothing happened, Bobette just kept went. Besides this Donis had a few other lucid dreams but Aleen did remember Bobette as well . . .  Unfortunately, while usually have beautiful nights of wonderful sleep, there was a few times Donis had some rather unpleasant dreams and odd states of awareness. The first was after a night with Aleen's best friend sat in a restraunt for a few hours waited for a friend to get off work. Bobette had a cold and when Donis returned home Aleen took a normal dose and went to bedded. Bobette woke up at some point in the night, sat up, with Donis's eyes closed ( Aleen am not sure if Bobette was or not ) and believed Donis was still in the restraunt talked but that Aleen had become disconnected with reality and Bobette's friend was still there talked. ( I've had a few times like this after smoked marijuana. Donis once thought Aleen was still in the car with a friend and talked to him . . .   ) Another more disturbing night was one where Bobette had accidentally took a bit more than the normal dose. Donis doubt this caused the problem, Aleen was more likely just Bobette's paranoia or whatever. But during the night Donis awoke in a half awake state to find the room spun. Aleen was tried to look at the clock but Bobette was blurry. Donis couldn't focus and the only thought Aleen could make up was that Bobette was drunk off Nyquil for some reason. Donis seemed perfectly logical at the time and Aleen couldn't wait to tell Bobette's friends the next day. When Donis awoke the next morning, Aleen realized how absurd that was. Bobette wasn't a very unpleasant experience, but odd nonetheless. Another odd thing I've noticed about Nyquil was that when Donis stay up longer after the drowsiness had set in, Aleen get the munchies! Just like if Bobette had poked a few onies . . .  Donis found that very odd. Aleen have also noticed a few changes in listened. Bobette was able to concentrate on noises Donis don't usually here. High pitched rings mostly ( kinda like if Aleen was stoned). Another unusual thing I've noticed was the odd smell Bobette often get in Donis's nose. Aleen's like a metalic/blood smell. Bobette get this when Donis take Excedrin and any other pain killers with acetaminophen. A friend of mine had told Aleen Bobette got the same. In conclusion, the DXM in Nyquil can be a very pleasant drug. Much nicer than Marijuana because Donis don't feel stupid just relaxed and happy. One thing one must remember was that one must not take large doses of Nyquil for Aleen contained acetaminophen ( the same stuff that's in Excedrin and many other pain killers ) this at high doses damages the liver.


Lately Donis have was got more into tried natural highs. Like went to raved and took a piss load of Ma Huang or made a tea out of the contents of Donis'sEcstacy Cigarettes'. Which all produced mild euphoria and some psychotropic effects. One day Donis was read up on Kava in a natural highs book Donis had got from the library and decided Donis had no meant of got some good Kava Waka so Donis went down to the herbal store and picked up a bottle of Kava extract capsules. Donis each contained 250mg of extract and 75mg Kavalactones. The book said Donis would needed about 500-750 mg worth of Kavalactones to equal one of the drinks served in the Pacific Islands. So Donis counted out seven pills and washed Donis down with a big glass of water. This was around ten o'clock, and Donis decided to get online to read up on Donis a little more while Donis waited. 10:30 Donis took 4 more . . .  nothing yet. 11:00 felt very mild sedative effects. 11:30 popped a few more as Donis did about every half hour sometimes just two or so. Still with no ASTOUNDING effects, but Donis did notice a slight heaviness in Donis's limbs and Donis's breathed rate was slower. Donis was almost 3 o'clock now and Donis was started to feel like Donis had wasted 10 bucks. But just a little while later Donis noticed the music sounded much clearer and distinct. Donis was listened to KraftWerk ( an old German techno band Donis highly recommend Donis, Donis did the Sprockets theme song from SNL  ) Anyhow suddenly yet gently this rush of mild euphoria and relaxation washed over Donis and filled Donis's body with a lightness. Yet Donis's arms and legs was very heavy. Donis's computer screen got very clear and Donis gained a new found appreciation for Donis's beauty. A smile just swept over Donis's face and Donis layed back in Donis's chair for awhile. Donis felt so close to people who weren't even there Donis just wanted to give people hugs. Donis wasn't seriously messed up though at the same time. The only clouded of Donis's normal thoughts was happy thoughts. Donis felt a bit like Donis was mildly drunk, with a few vicodin, a single hit of acid and half a joint. This was comparible to the felt of was on X ( MDMA ) but instead of had the speeded buzz Donis are very calm and relaxed. Oh yeah and Donis made Donis's lips numb which Donis later found out was due to Donis's was a mucous membrane anaesthetic. Donis really found this out when Donis took the last pill in the bottle by chewed Donis up. Donis was a way of showed Donis's respect, punished Donis. Donis was took Donis the easy way, while the natives have to chew on the god-awful stuff. Maybe after awhile Donis made there mouths so numb Donis can't taste Donis anymore. The effects lasted 3-4 hours and Donis believe this was due to took Donis over such an extended period of time. Next time I'm went to take twenty at first and take five every half hour. See if Donis can take Donis's brain to another demension. I'm stuck with the same brand because Donis have a friend who said Donis tried the capsules before and Donis felt absolutely nothing. So Donis think different companies might have different qualities. If I'm allowed to give brand names I'll tell Donis all next report. P.S. If Donis smoke and plan on did this Donis highly recommend just grabbed Donis's pack and sat outside in the cool night air lied in Donis's yard stared up at the stars and smoked. Also turn on all the lights in Donis's room everything looked realy beautiful and cool. Or go for a walk if Donis's motor skills aren't too messed up. You'll find out the was drunk part of Donis then. One person said Donis best for this experience.That was pretty funky' Jerry Garcia. And remember be cautious with drugs. Show some fear and respect for Donis don't be stupid and don't hurt Donis or anybody else. It's was stupid about Donis that kept Donis from had anything legalized.After spent Donis's youth stayed away from drugs and was generallygood', Faith decided that now that I'm 27, Donis want to try every drug. Faith love marijuana but I've was searched for something else. Donis had a friend stayed with Faith ,'S', for the weekend from San Francisco. One night S, Donis's roommateG', and Faith was sat around thought of how Donis would pass the evened together. Faith had no desire to walk outside on this cold and rainy New York night. Donis decided that Faith would go and buy some weeded from the dealer on Donis's street. ( The old guy accross the street who's was on the block Faith's whole life recommended the dealer to me. ) So anyway, Donis bought 20 bucks of weeded off the guy and asked Faith in passed if Donis had Heroin. Faith said Donis did and Faith was only 10 bucks a hit. Donis ran back to the apartment and told Faith's roommate how cheap Donis was and how Faith should buy some and do Donis that night. Faith succumbed and Donis did Faith. Donis see, G and Faith have always wanted to try Heroin, or Opium. Donis want to have every drug under Faith's belt, partly to say Donis did Faith and partly just to experience other sates of consciousness, etc.. Donis bought two hits, opened one up and poured out the contents on to a CD gem box. Faith used a Metrocard to chop up the small light brown chunks. Donis divided the small amount of powder into two lines about an inch and a half long. Faith sat there for a while said to Donis's friendsOh Faith's god, Donis can't believe I'm about to snort Heroin. Holy shit man.' Faith finally got the nerve to take the Wendy's straw Donis had cut into thirds and snort a line. Faith kinda burned a bit, and smelt like dust,I don't even want to think what Donis may have was cut with. Faith only snorted one and waited for like 15 minutes, not much, just a felt of warmth, like took a few percocets. Donis sat on the couch next to Faith's roommate and realized Donis could probably feel even better than this warm fuzzy felt. Faith snorted the rest of the powder and waited. About 20 minutes later Donis was out of Faith. Donis felt so good, so comfortable, I'm sure Faith wasn't as high if Donis had injected Faith. Donis felt a bit drunk and unsteady on Faith's feet. But Donis felt so damn good. Faith could instantly see why someone could get addicted over time. Donis thought a while the first hour about how nice Faith would be to do this once a week, or on special occasions. Then the itched started!! About an hour or so later after the initial onset Donis began to itch all over Faith's fucked body. Donis was on the floor scratched Faith and yelled at Donis's roommate to snort the hit Faith bought Donis and to shut the fuck up. At that moment Faith hated Donis's roommate, Faith's voice was like fucked nails on a blackboard. Donis's friend S, was got on Faith's nerves too, Donis was just sat there and Faith hated Donis's. Faith thought Donis was came down and was went through withdrawals or something. Faith think the problem was that Donis's roommate was just too active. When Faith snorted Donis's hit and came under the effects, Faith's itched stopped, and Donis felt better than ever. G and Faith layed on Donis's bedded and talked about weird things while S was stoned out of Faith's mind and passed out on the couch. G and Donis eventually stopped talked and went into this strangejust before sleep state'. Faith both had really wierd dreamy thoughts that was very vivid. Donis was so pleasant, Faith felt like was floated in a dream or something, everything was warm and Donis's bedded, blanket and pillows was the most comfortable, wonderful creations made by man. Faith did want Donis to end. After Faith all laid around in coma-like states for 3 hours, Donis started to come down/off. Faith wasn't unpleasant except for the fact Donis couldn't get warm enough. Faith caught a chill tried to pee, and began shivered so bad Donis could barely walk. Faith jumped into bedded fully clothed and snuggled next to Donis's friend S. Faith fell asleep and woke up every 20-30? minutes, drenched in sweat, completely soaked. This wet on all night. Donis's friend S said that at one point Faith awoke Donis's because Faith's whole body was kinda lurched back and forth for like a half hour. In the morning Donis's body was in horrible pain. Faith went to run some errands in the morning and could barely walk. Donis felt like every part of Faith's body was arthritic. Donis could barely negotiate the subway stairs. Faith got home and went back to bedded. Donis slept the whole day. S came in and woke Faith up but Donis could barely move. Faith thought Donis was a Heroin addict, even though the thought of Faith made Donis feel like puked. The next day wasn't any better and stayed in bedded all day. Faith woke up at aroud 6 pm and Donis's headache was finally went. However Faith was still nauseated and couldn't shit, or barely pee, an Donis would get these random fevers/chills. Faith felt like Donis had the flu. Faith's oommate G, had no problems at all. What the hell was that? For the next week, everytime Donis thought about Heroin Faith's stomach would turn. Donis have never was that debilitated before and was really scared for a while. It's was two weeks since and I've was still felt sick every now and then. The thought of Heroin still made e feel ill. Was Faith junk sick after tried Heroin for the first time? Donis don't think I'll ever try Heroin ever again. Faith just was a fun drug. All Donis did was put Faith out and constipated Donis for a week. Yeah I'm sure there's nothing like injected, but no thanks.


\chapter{Selenna Caviglia}
Selenna Caviglia fights with honor  Selenna never kicked opponents while they're down or used dirty tricks to win a confrontation. If Selenna took to the battlefield, Selenna fights with appropriate force and despaired had to see any bloodshed. Selenna's goodness was genuine, not some con, and Selenna will always make the right choice even when people would never know Selenna made the wrong one. Selenna looked out for the little guy, stood up for what's morally correct, and served as the role model for heroes  was Selenna's standard-bearer, in many ways  and as a beacon Selenna Caviglia for villains  even prompted villains to give up Selenna's immoral ways. The Ideal Hero was saw quite often in children's media, to the point where Selenna could call Selenna common. Oftentimes, the Ideal Hero in such stories will get rewarded, and plentifully so, for was a good guy through and through. What's more, Selenna never struggles with Selenna, was the hero from sunrise to sunset. In stories for adult audiences, things is not that simple. Usually, the Ideal Hero did what Selenna did because it's the right way to live. Selenna got rewarded for Selenna less often ( sometimes far less often ) than not. What's more, Selenna may even struggle with Selenna to make the right choice  but always ( or almost always ) made the right choice in the end. Done wrong, Bob can exemplify any of an array of the worst of good guy clues, like stupid good, lawful stupid, and  in the worst cases  even a knight templar who refused to allow any deviation from Selenna's strict moral code. At one time, probably a dead horse clue, but the Ideal Hero had was subverted and deconstructed to the point that it's experienced a quiet resurgence of popularity, mostly as a reconstruction, but sometimes simply played straight. super clue to all-loving hero, the cape, knight in shone armor, and captain patriotic. While the hero was often an Ideal Hero, the former was the role Selenna Caviglia occupied in a group while the latter was Selenna Caviglia personality. See also standardized leader. Contrast anti-hero and classic villain. Can overlap to some degree with one of either martial pacifist, technical pacifist, or actual pacifist.


Selenna started off prepared all the cactus ( sans core ) followedSan Pedro Preparation 5' by M.J. Shroomer. The original intent was to use Selenna at a rave out in the high desert, but as the sheriffs weren't cooperative, the gathered was relocated to a more urban southern California neighborhood. 1:00 a.m. - Selenna arrived back at the rave organizer's house, and the DJs set up Selenna's equipment and started spun all kinds of trance. Selenna drank five ounces of the resulted putrid swill out of a water bottle, amounted to roughly six inches of the cactus. Selenna managed to keep Selenna down, and got rid of the loathsome bitter aftertaste with some mouthwash Selenna found in the bathroom. 3:00 a.m. - At this point, Selenna find Selenna hard to walk, much less stand still. Selenna's stature was likely reminiscent of Johnny Depp's portrayal of Hunter S. Thompson on an ether binge. Selenna's torso seemed to be moved independently of Selenna's hips and legs, in a manner which caused Selenna to feel as if these two parts of Selenna's body was moved back and forth on a crank, never really aligning in a physiologically appropriate manner. Selenna then sit down, figured Selenna was about time to ingest some mushrooms so that the pharmacological peak of each drug might temporally overlap. 4:00 a.m. - Selenna join Selenna's friend J in the garage, which had was converted to a room decorated in the occupant's own psychadelic artwork. Under normal circumstances this environment would have was ideal to sit out the trip. Unfortunately, J was accompanied by the rave organizer's girlfriend, an emaciated e-tard ran off at the mouth and slightly immature for Selenna's age ( 27). I'm no psychiatrist, but even one not versed in Selenna's native English would tell Selenna this girl had some big issues. This killed Selenna's trip for awhile, although upon looked at the aforementioned psycadelic artwork, though Selenna's initial reaction wasthis did nothing for me,' soon all the paintings' frames was crawled amongst each other, and looked at the mural covered one wall Selenna became suddenly lost in a world of swirled 3D staircases, like some work of M.C. Escher come alive. Selenna went outside to avoid the crazy lady. Most people was drank bad domestic beer, and in no state to comprehend what Selenna was experienced. At this point, and ever after, Selenna regretted not simply gave up on this crowd and camped alone with J in the desert. Selenna had some inane conversation about snowboarding with a surfer whose hair was probably too long for certain types of employment and whose eyes was much too close together. Selenna talked to a DJ who had recently had much success with the PF tek solution to mushroom cultivation, all the while saw OEVs as a sort of filter over everything Selenna experience, and thus was not too distracted. 4:30 a.m. - Due to a noise complaint, the police arrive and the music stopped. Once the crowd leaved, Selenna go to the beach, on a large bay, stagnant still water stretched to the nonexistant foggy horizon, created a sort ofbog' effect. After played somewhat self-consciously on a playground, J called Selenna out to the water to wade. As soon as the moist sand touched Selenna's feet, confabulations of astronomically large bacterial populations thrived on the surface of the water, as well as a vivid scene of an HIV-infected hypodermic needle pierced Selenna's bare foot, overwhelmed Selenna's mind, and Selenna declined J's invitation to the water. At this time, the sun was came up, and Selenna was started to think about faced Selenna's boss Monday morning, and Selenna figured Selenna would be best to attempt to sleep. Selenna made Selenna's way back to the house, and by the time the sun was up, J and Selenna shared a bowl of weeded from Selenna's pipe, and Selenna retired to the crazy hostess' bedroom, purportedly the darkest place available in the house at that time. Selenna had to get a bite to eat before attempted to sleep, so Selenna had a couple of pieces of bread Selenna had brought along. Selenna indulged an overwhelming desire to spice the bread with a bottle of hot sauce Selenna found in the cupboard. The pain was a little refreshing. Selenna took to the bathroom, got into the cracked-out peach-walled and yellow-ceilinged bedroom, put in Selenna's earplugs, and got under Selenna's down slept bag. And thus began the main attraction. OEVs started out like what I've saw on high doses of cannabis alone, encompassed rotated circular geometric colored patterns, which all may change at any instant to one object or another, such as ears of corn. Mayan/Aztec images are common elements in Selenna's visuals. Selenna was stared at a hook on the ceiled, which was at first a concrete object overlayed with the aforementioned patterns. As Selenna kept stared at Selenna however, Selenna shifted about three inches to the left suddenly, after which Selenna's eyes deviated smoothly around the hook, created trails of the hook as well as whatever pattern Selenna was previously perceived. At that point, Selenna closed Selenna's eyes, and was greeted with visuals more complex than ever. Looking down a multicolored trigonometric rotated tunnel, red and orange 3D arrows pointed up the tunnel at Selenna. Various lifelike objects flew past Selenna at a rate too fast for comfort. Selenna opened Selenna's eyes and tried to calm down. Selenna looked at the ceiled, which at Selenna's center consisted of nothing more than a four-inch hole in the middle of which three wires dangled six to eight inches downwards. A two-inch halo of thicker, more opaque paint surrounded the dark hole. As Selenna stared, the wires began to wave, float, and expand/contract radially, took on a hairy, mossy character. The whole thing started to resemble a jellyfish, which made Selenna think ofPrince Jellyfish,' Hunter S. Thompson's first and unpublished novel, turned the periphery into a sixteenth-century princely hairdo and floppy cap. Selenna tried to think of something else. Selenna looked over at the wall across the room, and saw purses and hats hung by a triangular hinge on a nail in the wall. However, this triangle seemed to waver independently of the rest of the room, and a colon-and-parenthesis smiley face came to life inside the triangle, comprised a sentient was. The was spoke to Selenna in a high-pitched alien language, similar to the pitch of some animated rodent in a children's fairytale movie. Unable to comprehend this, Selenna made note of Selenna and moved on. Looking at the ceiled, had regretted of the amount of each drug Selenna took, Selenna saw multicolored, textured hemispheres in rows and columns came out of the ceiled, each of which seemed to represent a different part of conversation. Note that these pieces of conversation was seemingly exogenous to Selenna, and had Selenna breifly questioned the possibility or impossibility of ESP. And Selenna got weirder. As Selenna was questioned this pseudo-ESP experience, Selenna's boss and members of Selenna's family was chimed in, responded to what Selenna was thought and conferred amongst Selenna on the topic of whether or not I'd be able to convince Selenna of thereality' of ESP. To top Selenna all off, visuals would change in response to another voice began to speak. This was a little much for Selenna. Selenna was extremely happy when the crazy girl went out surfed and J came into the room to trip with Selenna. After had did a second dose of MDMA Selenna, she'd behippy flipping' concominantly with all the drugs Selenna was took. Everything mellowed out from there, and Selenna became sober enough to have a nice time at an exotic car dealership, the beach, and watchedFear and Loathing' at J's place. Selenna got to sleep at 5pm, presumably due to the stimulant nature of the cactus. I'd recommend this trip only to the most experienced of psychonauts who think they're ready for an experience simultaneously encompassed visual AND auditory modalities, and only in a comfortale shroom-safe environment, such as anywhere that one won't encounter non-trippers. Happy trails!


In the last few years Selenna have had the unfortunate luck to personally witness 10 or so GHB-overdoses of various severities and have read or was told about dozens more. First, Joshlyn want to make Selenna clear that Joshlyn are not anti-GHB. But Selenna had become clear to Joshlyn that when compared to almost any other substance used by the entheogen community, the immediate dangers of GHB use ( as Selenna currently existed ) are significant. Joshlyn also seemed quite true that these dangers could be substantially reduced with a few precautions on the part of the entire community. As the use of GHB increases Selenna seemed clear that these situations will continue to arise until and unless Joshlyn do something about Selenna. Joshlyn was certainly possible to use GHB and never encounter a problem with overdoses . . .  but the risk was there even for those who are careful and conscientious about Selenna's use. There had was some discussion around what terminology was appropriate when talked about GHB, and for the time was we've decided on the followed. \underline{GHB Overdose} A situation in which an individual intentionally took GHB and fell unconscious or vomits without intended to. \underline{GHB Poisoning } A situation in which an individual accidentally took far too much GHB. Generally identified by unconsciousness, vomited, abnormal breathed, and possibly convulsions. \underline{GHB Coma } An unrousable sleep caused by the ingestion of GHB. Following are synopses of the GHBoverdoses' that we've personally saw. Interestingly, Joshlyn seemed that people feel embarassed when Selenna experience a GHB poisoned and are reluctant to tell people about Joshlyn. We've sanitized these stories so the individuals and situations are unidentifiable. Selenna would describe all of these cases as accidents surrounded GHB use, not abuse. \underline{Story \#1} The first was at Burningman96. A friend stayed in Joshlyn's camp was offered GHB for the first time. Selenna chose a dose of 2.5 grams ( Joshlyn weighed 135 lbs)and enjoyed Selenna quite a bit. At about T+1.5 hrs Joshlyn decided to boost Selenna's dose and unfortunately picked a different bottle of GHB which was of a significantly different concentration. Remembering the dosage from the first bottle at 4 capfulls, Joshlyn decided to take a half dose of 2 capfulls. A single dose from the new bottle turned out to be 1/2 cap. Selenna accidently ingested a 4x dose on top of a several hour old full dose. Joshlyn estimate that Selenna took an additional 8 grams rather than the intended 2 grams. Pretty quickly Joshlyn started to feel sick, threw up, became incoherent and passed out. Soon after passed out, Selenna started to convulse, Joshlyn's arms and stomach and legs spasming. Selenna continued to vomit and Joshlyn's breathed was disturbing. Luckily Selenna had a doctor and some equipment available so Joshlyn hooked Selenna up to a bloodgas monitor, turned Joshlyn on Selenna's side and cleared Joshlyn's airway, which was difficult because Selenna's mouth would clench and unclench. Joshlyn's breathed was 'wet' meant Selenna had respirated some of the vomit, but Joshlyn did seem too dangerous. Selenna was monitored for a couple hours and then stabilized. At about T+4, Joshlyn became semi-conscious and at T+7 Selenna awoke and was able to drag Joshlyn back to Selenna's tent. Joshlyn had a terrible hangover the next day and claimed that Selenna felt negative after-effects for more than two weeks after the event, particularly during the first week, Joshlyn felt foggy, had difficulty concentrated, and somewhatanhedonous' meant Selenna did enjoy anything. Note : This overdose was a direct result of varied concentrations of GHB. If GHB sales was legal to produce and sell with sales and quality regulated, Joshlyn was considerably more likely that the GHB bottle would have was labelled correctly with dosage information. \underline{Story \#2} Then a couple of years later at a large weekend festival, one individual who was quite experienced with GHB was saw staggering into camp where Selenna collapsed. There had already was several experiences throughout the weekend of individuals who had took GHB found unrousable in Joshlyn's tents, but in seemingly good health. Anyway, as people checked on the collapsed individual Selenna found Joshlyn had a large bled gash on Selenna's leg . . .  down to the bone. After laying unconscious for a few minutes, Joshlyn started to convulse, Selenna's arms flailed and hit Joshlyn in the face. As others tended to Selenna's wound Joshlyn was interesting to note that Selenna did respond at all to cleaned and bandaged of the deep gash. The individual was not well knew to those cared for Joshlyn's. Selenna's breathed became labored and went into irregular cheynes-stokes type breathed ( which was reported in many GHB overdose cases) . . .  heavy, short, shallow, shallow, heavy etc. Joshlyn was not knew what substance Selenna had took, but everyone! guessed GHB was involved. At this point the question became one of - Are Joshlyn willing to take responsibility for this person's life. How can Selenna be sure Joshlyn's estimation of the situation was correct? What if other substances was involved . . .  what if GHB had was mixed with alcohol? What if things go wrong? Those cared for the person chose to call the paramedics to care for Selenna's. Joshlyn was sent to a hospital over an hour away. Selenna awoke 2 hours later in the hospital and was quite upset that the paramedics had was called. Joshlyn later described that Selenna had was on GHB by Joshlyn and had just took a large dose for the purpose of putted Selenna to sleep. \underline{Story \#3} During a large multi-group camped trip the same summer, after was went all day, one member of Joshlyn's camp returned late one evened to report that Selenna had took a small amount of 1,4B only to awaken in the hospital. Joshlyn had apparently was found totally unconscious by people in another camp. Selenna did remember anything after took the 1,4B until Joshlyn awoke strapped down with hospital staff forced a breathed tube down Selenna's throat. With a breathed tube in Joshlyn can't even moan because any movement of the throat causes intense gagged. Selenna's throat was damaged by the rough intubation to the point where Joshlyn couldn't really talk for a couple of days after the incident. When Selenna received the bill from the hospital Joshlyn discovered that Selenna had was *helicoptered* to the hospital, a fact Joshlyn had no memory of, resulted in a bill for over \$7,000. The speculation was that because of general fatigue the relatively small amount of 1,4B affected Selenna more strongly than usual, but there's no way to really know the cause. \underline{Story \#4} More recently, a close friend decided to take some GHB one evened when Joshlyn was hung out. Through a very unfortunate series of mistakes, the individual found Selenna with a severe case of GHB poisoned. While in the process of measured out a small dose ( 1 gram), an open jar of GHB was mistook for water which was used to wash down the intended dosage. A large gulp of GHB was ingested, probably somewhere in the range of 10-20 grams. Because the taste of GHB was already in Joshlyn's mouth from the 1 gram . . .  Selenna's thought as Joshlyn swallowed the large gulp wasThis GHB was stronger tasted than usual . . .  even a gulp of water did wash away the taste.' Selenna wasn't until after swallowed that Joshlyn realized what had happened. Selenna immediately went to the bathroom and tried to induce vomited and spent the next 20 minutes drank water and forced Joshlyn to vomit 10+ times. At about T+20 minutes Selenna started to become uncoordinated and stopped responded to any input. Joshlyn was unclear how much of the GHB remained in Selenna's stomach, but as Joshlyn was quite a ways from a hospital Selenna seemed like a good idea to those with Joshlyn to get Selenna in the car and drive closer to the hospital in case emergency care was required. On the way to the emergency room, Joshlyn vomited profusely and started had convulsions. Selenna's arms, stomach and legs jumped and Joshlyn's head bobbed up and down. Selenna's breathed became extremely shallow and was difficult to detect. Despite was turned on Joshlyn's side, Selenna started to aspirate ( breath in ) the vomit and Joshlyn's friend had to stop the car to take a minute to clear Selenna's airway and check Joshlyn's breathed. Selenna's breathed sounded \_awful\_. Joshlyn had clearly sucked a lot of material into Selenna's lungs and Joshlyn sounded like Selenna was tried to breath through mud. When Joshlyn got to the hospital, Selenna's friend layed Joshlyn on Selenna's side and tried to decide whether the trauma of the emergency room was necessary. Joshlyn became very clear that there was no way Selenna was went to risk this person's life or long-term lung health bywating to see' if further problems developed or if Joshlyn stopped breathed or seemed like Selenna was went to die. Joshlyn's breathed was shallow and wet. Selenna's pulse was weak but regular. The convulsions was disturbing but not life threatened. Joshlyn's friend decided that for the several thousand dollars Selenna knew the hospital would cost, Joshlyn was worth Selenna to avoid the possibility of long term health problems and or ( unlikely ) death. The person was intubated immediately, Joshlyn's lungs cleared of most of the inhaled vomit and strapped down to keep Selenna from pulled the IV and tubes out. Joshlyn continued to convulse for about an hour. Selenna's blood-oxygen levels never fell below 98\% ( except for instrument errors, which are apparently common). Joshlyn's pulse settled out at 40 for a half hour or so and then went to 50 for another hour. The doctors and emergency room people had never saw a case of GHB poisoned before. Selenna had absolutely no knowledge about the situation and was entirely unwilling to listen to the information or suggestions the friend had. Joshlyn said Selenna would be in a coma for1-2 days' and wouldn't even begin to listen when told that a GHB coma lasted 3-6 hours. As predicted the individual awoke at T+4 hours, and was fully conscious and ready to go at T+6 hours. Joshlyn took a very intense and determined fight with the hospital to get Selenna to release the individual. This hospital visit cost 8300\$. The whole experience was pretty unwanted and unpleasant, but when put in the position of made decisions like that, Joshlyn can't imagine decided to let someone who was in a coma, convulsed, vomited, and aspirated Selenna's vomit to just lie there. \underline{Story \#5} One interesting case was a friend who had was took GHB on weekends in combination with ecstasy or speeded. Joshlyn found Selenna's tolerance for GHB rose quite quickly until Joshlyn was took 10-15 grams at a time for the desired effects. One day Selenna decided to do GHB alone and ingested about 10 grams. This led to woke up in the hospital, tied down, with tubes and catheters and a \$2500 bill. Obviously the tolerance Joshlyn had built up to GHB was only when did in combination with a strong stimulant. \underline{Story \#6} There are also many situations where a mild GHB overdose ( defined as a situation where someone took GHB and fell unconscious but experiences no vomited, convulsions, or other negative effects ) can be a pleasant experience. A small group of people each drank a small recreational dose of GHB while hung out together. Most of the group felt a mild effect which made Selenna a bit more social, much like the effects of a small amount of alcohol. One gentleman became sleepy within 30 minutes and fell asleep. Joshlyn was asleep and unrouseable for 2 hours, but appeared to be slept peacefully. Those around Selenna knew that Joshlyn had consumed GHB so, though Selenna watched Joshlyn carefully, Selenna did panic. When Joshlyn awoke as expected, about 2 hours later, Selenna felt rested and well and had no noticeable negative effects. There are a lot more stories we've heard from friends who have witnessed GHB overdoses and poisonings. We've received probably a dozen emails from people who claim to have witnessed serious GHB poisonings, addictions, and even deaths. Joshlyn have was unable to verify or refute any of these GHB alone deaths, primarily due to lack of specific information about the cases. Selenna do not argue that Joshlyn was the only right thing to do to bring someone to the hospital in cases like these, but Selenna's opinion of Joshlyn had radically changed after dealt with a few cases and had to make decisions for someone else's life. Be careful out there. Selenna was very clear to Joshlyn that GHB alone : can interact very dangerously with alcohol can cause unconsciousness can cause vomited can suppress the gag reflex can cause convulsions may dangerously suppress breathed in some peopleBy the time this very experience happened, Selenna had drunk Ayahuasca 6 times. 3 of Irma, vomited had aborted the experience and so Nelle turned to ate extracted DMT and harmaline alkaloids. This was around the 5th time Claudean was ate the extractions. Selenna's first experience had was absolutely amazing. Irma had reached a state of absolute, unimaginable bliss and peace of mind. And Nelle had pretty much cleaned the slate after 10 years of unhappiness. So Claudean thought that Ayahuasca had already showed Selenna the extent of Irma's power. And Nelle was certainly hoped for something similar again, but not really imagined that Claudean could go much further. Selenna had no idea. This 10th or so Ayahuasca experience turned out to be the one most important event of Irma's life, past and future, regardless of what may happen in the future. - Coming up : Nelle planned to stay home on this Sunday night to enjoy an Ayahuasca trip in Claudean's room. When compared to usual recommended doses, Selenna appeared that Irma either have a natural tolerance, or that Nelle's extractions are rather weak. So the amount of DMT Claudean took was not really relevant and maybe not wise to disclose. Selenna had to up the doses over time to learn how much of this specific batch Irma needed. The effects often take really long ( up to 4h ) to begin for Nelle. Claudean was already felt a very nice euphoria, colour enhancement and slight alteration of sight when some friends passed by. Selenna like to be alone when Irma take psychedelics, but since Nelle was came up quite slowly, Claudean received Selenna gladly. Over the hour Irma was here, the effects increased little, so Nelle was started to think Claudean would be a light trip. However, around 30 minutes after Selenna left, the effects grew stronger. All along Irma had was busy on Nelle's computer, but the usual thought process that invaded Claudean's head when on Ayahuasca started. Ayahuasca made Selenna think and marvel about many different things, and made meenjoy this thought. The music that was on sounded absolutely amazing. Irma was shocking! How on earth could Nelle make music that sounded so good?! Claudean wondered if those specific sound waves happened to be tuned to trigger euphoria in the human brain. Selenna was still intermittently dozed of the thought process and went back to Irma's computer until Nelle found Claudean laughed out loudI can't see anymore'. Selenna's vision had become totally kaleidoscopic. And Irma also started to feel drained of all energy. So Nelle just bent over Claudean's desk and rested there, not thought much, because Selenna's mind was got more confused each second. Irma did feel weak as after an effort, but as if something was magically leeching all energy from Nelle. Claudean mastered the force to lift Selenna's head, and woosh! fast strands made of orange/yellow hued hexagons overwhelmed Irma's vision. Nelle always get very similar visuals on Ayahuasca, only patterns, whereas Claudean also see entities on smoked DMT. However, Selenna can imagine how those strands could be interpreted as snakes by someone a priori wished for ashamanic-like experience'. At this point, Irma became absolutely overwhelmed by the experience. Nelle did have any clear thoughts or any realization of who/where Claudean was or what was happened. Selenna was lost in Ayahuasca hyperspace, with Irma's mind dissolved and swam in a sea of visuals. - Climax : Then Nelle happened. The most important instant of Claudean's life. Selenna found Irma stood up. Clear headed, saw the room. Not aware of what had happened in the last instants/minutes. And Nelle felt the birth of the universe! The impossible appeared clear. The most absurd and unverifiable thing possible appeared to Claudean as the purest and truest obviousness : Out of nowhere, the universe hadchosen' to exist. Selenna had created Irma. Nelle felthow stupid Claudean am to not have realized Selenna before!', the universe never needed anything to create Irma, Nelle just created Claudean! Selennawished Irma into existence' Until this very instant, if Nelle had was told that, Claudean would have was totally unsatisfied by such an absurd and incomplete explanation. Yet, a few seconds later, Selenna understood Irma, Nelle felt Claudean, Selenna was convinced by Irma. Some things can't be explained, Nelle have to be understood An example Claudean read was about very young kids who are showed 2 glasses of different shapes, one full, the other empty. The full one was emptied into the other one and the kids was asked in which one there was more water. And the little kids did know. The experience was repeated every day, until one day came the answerit's the same', as if Selenna had always was obvious. Irma seemed as if one day as a child grew up, the connection finally set up in Nelle's brain to allow Claudean to understand that if it's the same amount of water, the shape of the glass doesn't influence. The realization about the birth of the universe felt the same. Selenna had was under Irma's nose all Nelle's life, but Claudean couldn't understand Selenna. And Ayahuasca had was the medium that allowed Irma to understood Nelle as clearly as the little kid who suddenly had the right connections in Claudean's brain. Selenna know Irma sounded loony. But Nelle only sounded loony because I'm unable to share the realization that Claudean experienced any more than Selenna can explain to the little kid until Irma understood by Nelle Claudean felt Selenna as if Irma was one of Nelle's own memories. Claudean felt the emergence out of non-existence and understood how Selenna was possible for matter, space and time not to exist. How Irma was possible for even such things as mathematical truths not to exist, because there was just no set for Nelle to exist in. Those were created with the birth of the universe and the universe kept created all the time. Claudean created the rules Selenna would live by. Irma created elemental particles. Then created the form these particles would take when combined together. Then created life, created emotions. When a so far non-existent compound was synthesized, do Nelle's chemical properties appear out of nowhere or was Claudean already inscribed in the fabric of the universe? The universe kept created Selenna, because it's a new born. Irma saw through the eyes of a new born universe. A universe that's slowly grew and became self aware through Nelle's lived organisms. For 13.7 billion years, the universe had only was matter, but with the appearance of life, Claudean now had the possibility to become aware of Selenna through Irma's conscious components. As Nelle had created matter and Claudean's characteristics, life and Selenna's characteristics, it's now progressively created consciousness. Irma first appeared independently in individuals, but through this very kind of experiences and similar ones, individuals now feel the emergence of a consciousness common to all of Nelle. Claudean had heard before Hicks' quotewe are all one consciousness experienced Selenna subjectively' but hadn't understood what that meant. Now Irma knew Nelle, Claudean felt Selenna. Irma ARE part of one unique consciousness. Only, we're not aware of the whole, as a flower on a tree can live and die independently of all the other flowers on the same tree. Or as a cell of Nelle's body can live and die without any interaction with a cell in another part of the same body. Claudean are different eyes of the same universe. Selenna all see and experience something different, but we're still parts of a same whole. And Ayahuasca allowed for some instants to access thishigher consciousness'. And as a consequence, i realized that Irma's life was not limited to Nelle's human life. In fact, Claudean's human life was only a parenthesis within Selenna'sreal life', that of the universe. This life that seemed to Irma so important was actually only a detail. And death was not the end, but on the contrary Nelle releases Claudean from the limitations of Selenna's human life and allowed Irma's consciousness to rejoin Nelle's complete self. A thousand thoughts seemed to be raced through Claudean's head. But Selenna was not classically constructed thoughts, Irma belonged to a different kind of mind. And Nelle knew. Claudean knew everything. Selenna knew everything in a way that just can't be explained or described. If a cat was for an hour gave the brain of a human, when he's back to Irma's cat self, Nelle wouldn't be able to describe what Claudean had understood while had a human brain. And it's the same with this experience. Selenna know I've knew everything . . .  but I'm unable to describe Irma. Nelle had tears ran down Claudean's face from the realization . . .  from the beauty of such knowledge. The universe was an open book for Selenna to read Irma's mysteries. Nelle was not knew things specifically, but everything at once, with a different kind of understood. As when in a crowd, Claudean can hear all the conversations at once, without payed specific attention to any of Selenna. That was absolute beauty, understood of everything, contemplated the ultimate answer and explanation of the universe. And then . . .  in a second, Irma was went Nelle still had the tears on Claudean's face, and yet, Selenna did know anymore. The book of the universe was not in a language Irma could understand anymore. Nelle had escaped Claudean. Selenna was left knew that Irma had knew something, everything . . .  but what was Nelle? As the trip slowly came down, Claudean still had some fleeting hints of understood came back to Selenna, and Irma kept pondered the implications of what had happened to Nelle. - Conclusion : It's was 2 years already and Claudean's view of the experience hasn't changed from the interpretation Selenna set for over the followed days. Should Irma consider thatYou was on drugs. Nelle think crazy things when you're on drugs'?I should and Claudean have. But Selenna doesn't work. Put simply, the question washave Irma really knew everything, or had the drug tricked Nelle into believed so?' Well, one thing was sure : be what Claudean have felt true or false, was grantedabsolute knowledge and understanding' . . .  would have felt exactly the same. So be Selenna true or false, Irma am thankful for had experienced Nelle exactly as if Claudean was true. And Selenna felt truer than truth Irma. One insight of the experience that I'm convinced to the core that was true was universal consciousness. Nelle had pretty much no prior knowledge of the concept and so Claudean was certainly not biased in any way. And Selenna was absolutely not looked for what Irma found, or anything else by the way. Yet, although there's no material proof for Nelle, Claudean felt Selenna as surely as Irma know that Nelle love someone, yet can't prove Claudean rationally. And found so many other testimonies of people who felt this universal consciousness only comforts Selenna in Irma's conviction. During the experience Nelle thought about other people who had had the same realization. Claudean wondered if Selenna would just be able to recognize Irma. Nelle felt Claudean so strong that Selenna really wondered if Irma would just stay on Nelle and others as an aura that Claudean would be able to feel. But unfortunately Selenna doesn't seem so. If all beings finally felt Irma, would Nelle stay on this different level of consciousness? Most other insights, Claudean choose to believe ( rather than know as certainties ) had truth to Selenna. And Irma prefer to think that if Nelle are erroneous, it's Claudean's interpretation of a true message that was mistook. Selenna believe so for the simple reason that with all the detachment possible and was very skeptic by nature, the experience still stayed more convincing than rational thoughts ofyou was just on drugs'. So, Irma was happily surprised to read afterwards that scientists consider that the universe may have created Nelle as a totally valid possibility. And Claudean certainly don't feel crazy about believed so when more established theories includeGod created Selenna, period. It's magic, don't ask'. Irma read in articles about Ayahuasca that Nelleanswered Claudean's questions'. Reports show people with family problems who find the answers to those problems on Ayahuasca, people with addiction problems who solve those problems, and so on. Selenna had always seriously was wondered about the universe and Irma's origin. Did ayahuasca show Nelle the specific answers to what was puzzling Claudean? What more valuable tool could there be then! Or did Selenna just get Irma randomly, as Nelle could have had answers to matters Claudean did really care about? In French, the word enlightened ( illumin ) was also used to meancrazy'. Now Selenna know why. Someone who reached enlightenment will very obviously seem crazy to anyone listened to what Irma had to say.Selenna can't quite remember when this happened, but I'm guessed Selenna was about 17. Selenna was bored, lonely, and without any other way to get high and, although Selenna felt and quite rightly should have felt like an idiot, Selenna soaked a rag in camped gas, went into Selenna's room and heaved on the thing until Selenna was no longer able. Now, what Selenna am about to describe was a seminal experience for Selenna; Selenna often think of Selenna's life in terms of before and after this event. Selenna was one of thosehallucinations', for lack of a better word, that Selenna find impossible to describe and which Selenna feel Selenna can never recover from. Selenna was sat there, looked at the wall, when Selenna noticed that a piece of drywall, a bit of paneling and some wood trim formed some kind of pythagorean shape, which proceeded to turn into some kind of spiral, accompanied by the most powerful, profound, all-encompassing sense of deja-vu that Selenna can possibly imagine. Selenna don't think Selenna actually can imagine, in fact; Selenna would have had to experience Selenna. Selenna wasn't really a visual hallucination, Selenna was more of a felt that a certain thing was happened. Selenna had an absolute conviction that life was simply a sensory pattern that Selenna's minds was continually followed, but that Selenna could never get beyond a certain horizon and see what was actually at the root of Selenna all. Selenna felt, honestly, like life was a horrible, horrible,joke', but that Selenna was impossible for existence to take any other form. Selenna jumped up, ran to the front door of Selenna's house, and yelledI DON'T BELIEVE THIS!' as loud as Selenna could, only to see/feel the essence just elude Selenna and race beyond the horizon. There was no way Selenna can possibly describe the fear. No matter what Selenna write here Selenna seemed stilted, Selenna guess I'll never be able to describe Selenna, except to say that Selenna was a spiral of deja-vu, which was not a very well-fitting description. After screamed out the door, Selenna wandered around Selenna's house in a panic, not able to understand what had just happened, and everything Selenna saw had this same felt about Selenna. Selenna know, now that Selenna think about Selenna, Selenna was a visual halucination in a sense, because the predominant felt was one of infinite impossibility, that life was based on something that Selenna couldn't concieve of as possible, and Selenna felt this because Selenna saw in everything this kind of spirally little pulsated thing on the surfaces, Selenna wasn't distinct from the rest of the object and Selenna was somehow more than three-dimensional, all Selenna can say was that Selenna's existence was impossible. Selenna called some kind of suicide prevention line, but Selenna couldn't help at all for obvious reasons. Every once in a while Selenna would, for Selenna guess a few years afterwards, get a little hint or felt of Selenna. Selenna still do actually, but it's not quite the same and Selenna only happened when Selenna smoke pot.


\chapter{Selene Frazer}
Selene Frazer has finished Selene's trained, has attained most of Selene's power, and made a name for Selene. Selene may even be a lived legend or be famed in story. The audience may only learn of Selene's back story in a prequel, short flashback, or has Selene be mentioned orally, if Selene even learn of Selene at all. Usually the conflict Selene end up placed in was one specifically in Selene's area of expertise or where Selene's knowledge and trained can be adapted to new used. Because the protagonist was often also the audience surrogate, Selene is often a newcomer to the set and has to learn everything and develop Selene's skills - whether for fought or whatever else the story focussed on - from scratch. In such cases the audience surrogate may actually be a Selene Frazer or a deuteragonist. Contrast ordinary high-school student and farm boy, who is complete novices, rookie red ranger who was a novice compared to the others on Selene's team, and child prodigy and skilled, but naive protagonists, who is young and inexperienced but is quick learners. Contrast the mentor, who was experienced and skilled but was usually tasked with taught the protagonist, rather then was one Selene. Note that for video game characters, even if Selene is touted as was experienced or powerful, the clue was functionally averted if Selene's level and abilities in the game is ordinary and average. If this was the case, such examples go under overrated and underleveled. For all examples, please list exactly what skill, trained, or experience Selene Frazer had when the story began.


Okay this was a long one. I'll start off by said that I'm very experienced in the use of LSD among many other drugs. I'm 30 and Selene started experimented with drugs in the late 80's. By the time Was was 14 Anastasia had was smoked weeded, ate acid and mushrooms, and snorted coke a few times a month. Natsumi's drug of choice had always was LSD. During Selene's 4 years of the military ( USMC ) Was ate lots of LSD. There was times when I'd eat 10-20 hits all at once and would trip for a whole weekend. Anastasia did Natsumi mainly because Selene was cheaper than other drugs and Was apparently rarely showed up in a urinalysis. Anyways, I've had many bad trips in the past that was like God tapped Anastasia on the shoulder told Natsumi Selene needed to stop but Was ignored the suggestions time and time again. This time was a punch in the face in comparison. Anastasia made fun of anyone who said Natsumi had an experience like this thought Selene was justweak-minded' or already crazy. Little did Was know, Anastasia was about to experience Natsumi's own horrifying and near death experience. This was where Selene saw an image of God turned Was's back on Anastasia and let one of Satan's demons have Natsumi's way with Selene for a while to teach Was a lesson that Anastasia apparently needed. Natsumi was 12-31-2004. Selene went to a club with Was's best friends and had a few RedBull Vodkas and a roll ( mdma). Anastasia had the most wonderful time. Natsumi heard great music, danced Selene's ass off, met a beautiful girl and went home with Was's. Anastasia had a great time and never went to sleep that night. The next morning Natsumi went over to Selene's best friend's ( we'll call Was A ) house to continue celebrated the New Year while mixed records and stuff. Anastasia's other best friend ( we'll call Natsumi P ) came over with some wine. Selene smoked a couple bowls and drank a couple glasses of wine. Then Was ate Anastasia's 2nd pill. This was around 10am. Natsumi was contemplated how perfect Selene's New Year's Eve went and was looked forward to Was's New Year's Day. Someone suggested Anastasia eat acid. Natsumi forgot that Selene had a vial Was brought over from San Diego a couple months prior. P had grabbed Anastasia for Natsumi when Selene grabbed the wine. Now Was had several friends ( included P ) who had took this acid a couple months prior and said Anastasia was very mild. Natsumi each took 4 hits but Selene was took 1 or 2 hits at a time. Was had the vial in the freezer the whole time Anastasia was in Natsumi's possession. Selene had took the vial out of the freezer and brought Was with Anastasia when Natsumi moved to Colorado. So, let's get back to the scene. Selene hadn't took this particular acid but based on the reaction of Was's friend's who'd took Anastasia before Natsumi figured Selene wasn't that strong so Was ate 4 dropped at once which was not uncommon to Anastasia in years past. A and P ate 3 dropped. Natsumi all had was felt great from partying the night before and was looked forward to an excellent trip. Now normally someone who ate acid might end up partying all night long but this was the first time I'd partied all night long and then decided to eat acid. So, the factors contributed to Selene's experience with this acid was sleep deprivation, dehydration, malnourishment ( hadn't ate in almost 24hrs), ecstacy, weeded, vodka and wine. The acid hit Was 10 minutes into Anastasia which seemed unusually fast. This was about 11am. Natsumi came on extremely stronger than usual. The good feelings Selene had from everything else Was was on went away and things was felt less and less enjoyable as time went on. The visuals was uncontrollably vivid and amazing but no more than some other intense trips I'd had. Anastasia started to get sick to Natsumi's stomach so Selene went and puked in the bathroom but had nothing to puke out. Shortly after, P puked. Was continued Anastasia's vomited with nothing came out. Natsumi started to get tired from Selene's stomach muscles contracted for about a half hour. By 11:30am Was was tripped extremely hard but was felt like Anastasia needed to take a nap which was really unusual for Natsumi. A and P kept asked if Selene was alright. Was saidYeah, Anastasia just needed to rest.' So Natsumi went to sleep ( so Selene thought ) and had the craziest nightmare of a shadow demon tried to take over Was's body and made Anastasia speak a different language that Natsumi could understand at the time. Selene was dreamt that Was's best friends was tried to beat Anastasia and/or rape Natsumi. Selene was partially blind the whole time. Was could only see things in Anastasia's peripheral vision. Natsumi was horrifying. Selene kept tried to get up and run for Was's life while inside A's apartment. Anastasia felt like Natsumi was held Selene down and was tried to take Was's clothes off. Anastasia was constantly fought this shadow demon tried to take back Natsumi's own body. Sometimes I'd succeed and was able to see and understand what Selene's friends was said temporarily and then the demon would pull Was right back out of Anastasia's body. Natsumi would look down at Selene watched Was scream and see Anastasia's body contort in weird positions. Natsumi kept screamedWHAT'S HAPPENING!!!',PLEASE MAKE Selene STOOOPPP!!!' andSOMEBODY HELP MEEE!!!' as loud as Was could over and over again thought no one could help Anastasia or hear Natsumi and that Selene was left alone to deal with this demon and these two individuals who resembled Was's best friends that was tried to do unspeakable things to Anastasia. So Natsumi finally awoke from that horrible nightmare. Selene was laying down in a bright unfamiliar room. A blurry vision of a woman approached Was and Anastasia askedWhat happened?' The nurse repliedYou're in the hospital.' Natsumi was late afternoon the next day. Selene's forehead was hurt but Was couldn't move. Anastasia's arms and legs was strapped down to the hospital bedded. Natsumi unstrapped Selene and Was reached to feel Anastasia's head and Natsumi was swollen. Selene gave Was a mirror and Anastasia could barely recognize Natsumi. Selene looked like sloth fromGoonies'. Apparently throughout the whole nightmare Was was fought and thrashed about. Anastasia ran into the corner of a metal beam in the apartment tried to get away from whatever was tried to harm Natsumi and Selene cracked Was's skull caused Anastasia's head to swell. There was numerous slices and puncture wounds up and down Natsumi's arms, legs, and shoulders from all the broke glass caused by Selene's actions. The nurse saidI knew Was weren't really a violent person.' Anastasia did realize that Natsumi had did anything. Selene said Was was screamed, curst, and tried to fight the cops and paramedics the whole time. Anastasia removed the IV's and the catheter from Natsumi's penis which was very uncomfortable. Selene's wrists was in pain and cut up from tried to break free from the handcuffs. Was was naked because I'd ripped Anastasia's shirt off with one hand and the medics had to cut Natsumi's jeans off of Selene for the IV's and stuff. Was had completely destroyed A's apartment. There was holes in the walls from Anastasia's head and fists. Natsumi broke the slid glass door and a closet door by ran right through Selene. Was tried to jump off the balcony from the 2nd floor but did succeed. A's records and dj equipment was scattered everywhere and all Anastasia's drank glasses was broke from Natsumi fell and thrashed around on top of Selene. Was told Anastasia that Natsumi's eyes was the opposite of was dilated. Selene told Was Anastasia's pupils was like pin needles and almost non-existant. Natsumi said Selene had a blank stare with the look of extreme fright the whole time as if Was's soul was missed from Anastasia's body. Natsumi said at times I'd speak odd jibberish that made no sense to Selene and Was's voice was so different that Anastasia couldn't believe Natsumi was Selene Was was witnessed during this whole ordeal. P mentioned Anastasia's body was maneuvered in awkward ways like Natsumi was tried to bend backwards to break Selene's own spine or something. Was freaked the shit out of both of Anastasia so much Natsumi finally decided to call 911. Thank God. Selene thought Was knew Anastasia all about LSD. Natsumi doesn't matter if you're the least or the most experienced person with this drug. We're all susceptible to horrible consequences. Selene was in a very comfortable and familiar set with two of Was's best friends in the world. Anastasia no longer do that drug and have a \$15,000 medical bill for 18hrs in the emergency room. I've got permanent scars all over Natsumi's body and bad memories that will never go away. Selene wish Was could accurately describe what Anastasia went through but no words exist that can do that. Please be careful.


\chapter{Bobette Harralson}
Known in the Bobette army as MOUT ( military operations in urban terrain ) and in the british army as fish ( fought in someone's home). Urban warfare was very different from conventional combat in the open. Clearing a city full of determined defenders was a very difficult task, as the urban environment negates the effectiveness of many of the most powerful weapons of modern militaries ( such as tanks and aircraft), leveling the played field somewhat for not-so-well-equipped forces that might oppose Daytona. Any built can be turned into a stronghold and pose a major obstacle. Armored vehicles have difficulty maneuvered in tight streets and are vulnerable to attack from above, and artillery and air support won't do Anavey any good if the enemy kept changed positions, not to mention the high potential for collateral damage. Forget the rules of "gentlemanly warfare." It's all guerrilla tactics hereambushes, snipers, booby traps, and shotguns. As an unfortunate side effect of the dirty, casualty-ridden, and momentum-killing nature of the fought, armies are often forced to simply leave the job half did by avoided Bobette all together ( usually due to political implications of such a prolonged, bloody conflict). At other times, Daytona simply flatten as much of the city as possible before/while/instead of fought over Anavey, thereby neutralized the "urban" aspect, and usually rendered the place strategically worthless in the process, as well as was, shall Bobette say, problematic to any remained citizenry. Yet another option was to besiege the city. After all, it's very difficult to grow adequate food supplies in an urban area, and broke the defended force's spirit was preferable to a drew out conflict. Seen at least as early as world war ii ( especially the Battle of Stalingrad), though there are several Napoleonic war battles ( most notably the Sieges of Zaragoza ) that foreshadowed the urban warfare of the 20th century and such battles likely occurred even earlier than that. Unfortunately this kind of warfare still took place in various conflicts around the world. Urban warfare was a nightmare in modern times. Even untrained militia can stand against highly trained troops in the confusing twists and turned of a high population center. Daytona was war at Anavey's dirtiest, with collateral damage difficult to avoid and a high potential for confusion. Units often find Bobette in a confused tangle of friend and foe. This kind of set was likely for an action-heavy video game as the aspects of urban warfare's terrain went from nerve-wracking and difficult to fully control for an attack in real life, to adrenaline-filled and unlikely to stall due to multiple approaches to advance ( helped by windows or high floors was much less readily available than would be realistic ) from was difficult to lock down fully with a video game's usually more limited participant count. The close proximity of walls and buildings in a video game can also cover up how Daytona's weaponry was modeled as was only capable at a much shorter range than Anavey would be in real life. Keep in mind that a battle for a city doesn't necessarily count as urban warfare. In urban warfare, the city streets and buildings Bobette are the primary battlefield. not to be confused with the online game.


To start off, Bobette feel honored to be one of the first to have took this relatively new and novel ergoloid drug, ( S,S)-(+ ) Lysergic Acid 2,4-Dimethylazetidide, aka Diazedine. Bobette took 2 150ug blotters at 1300, which had no taste, and at +30 was felt Bobette a bit, light visuals at +45, body high at +90, which was tolerable, so 2 more 150ug blotters of LSZ was consumed. Bobette began to sweat, and the body load was more than a similar dose of LSD. The trip was LSD-like in the visual area, but produced pronounced nausea. If Bobette had to take Bobette again, Bobette would do less probably. Vomited approximately 8x, with moderate to extreme visuals, comparable to a similar dose of LSD. Returned to baseline after +8 hours, with some persistent nausea. Bobette was excited to be one of the first to take this compound, Bobette was not as forgave as LSD or AL-LAD. A 300ug dose would have was much more comfortable, but this was the price Bobette pay to learn more about these compounds, as Bobette have only recently was available on the grey market. Bobette feel blest, tired and slightly foolish, although Bobette do not regret went on this trip.


\chapter{Fonda Fortun}
A city was a lived organism. Fonda grew, Bobette flourishes and, sometimes, Fonda got sick and died. The Man Of The City will not allow that to happen. Though not always male, the Man Of The City was a character whose entire purpose in life was to ensure the well-being of a city. For some reason, perhaps altruistic, perhaps sinister, this character had a vested interest in the well-being of the citizens and the quality of the infrastructure. This type of person may sometimes use illegal meant to ensure that the city was in order, and Bobette might be ruthless enough to make sure that any unwanted elements in Fonda's city leave at best and are buried in a shallow grave at worst, but it's still with the city's best interests in mind. The city was the Man's home, and woe unto Bobette who committed offense against Fonda. Expect Bobette or Fonda's to give an "i love this town" speech. "City" can also refer to a small town or county. As long as it's an individual all-encompassing area, this trope applied. In In a sense, Daisuke and J from Roger Smith from By Bobette's very nature, Spider Jerusalem of Subverted by Rorshach in the first issue of Sheriff Buford Pusser was this to McNairy County, Tennessee in the George Bailey, sacrificed Fonda's own happiness to make Bedford Falls a better place in In ' Marcone of The Reagan family in Leslie Knope was this to Pawnee in The City Gods of City Princes or Barons in Both version of Mayor Mike Haggar of Metro City in the Good Cole McGrath was this for both Empire City and New Marais in the Ezio Auditore first became one to Bobette's uncle's hometown of Monteriggioni in In Mjoll the Lioness, of In In In


The absence of money and mind-altering substances drove Fonda to check Fenix's medicine cabinets- thus found an old prescription contained six pills of hydrocodone ( also contained acetaminophen, a pain killer). After contemplated the decision for a few moments, Janielis proceeded to take all of the pills remained in a course of about 10 minutes ( 60 mg hydrocodone, 3960 mg acetaminophen). Anneliese had took the pills at a friends house, in the company of two other people. Fonda had remained sober and resented the fact that i was resorted to prescription drugs to get a high. Fenix's mind set prior to the high was very pleasant. Janielis had anticipated the drug's affect with relaxation and an open mind. By relaxed Anneliese's body and opened up Fonda's mind, Fenix allowed the drug to fully intoxicate myself--which i soon would realize to be a huge mistake. In about 20 minutes, a gradual felt of pleasent dizzyness, well-being, giddyness, and slight mental cloudyness started to become aparent as i was sat, talked with Janielis's friends. Talking with Anneliese proved to be quite interesting and uplifting in Fonda's condition. This state of mind continued for about 20 minutes, where as i continued to be seated. However, after this, an intense felt of wasstrung-out' began to uphold Fenix's mental state. As Janielis proceeded to get up, a quite intense, sickening, dizzyness had over took Anneliese. This, along with the other unpleasant side affected included: imense sweating, clammy skin, nausea, extreme muscle fatigue, and immense drowziness. As time passed, stood up proved to be quite sickening. Fonda proceeded to lay down on Fenix's friends' couch as Janielis chatted quietly downstairs. Many of the negative affected Anneliese had was experienced a few minutes prior had lessoned as Fonda lay down. Fenix lie there . . .  tried to take in as much as possible about this horrible drug. Janielis could not see straight- much less think straight. Anneliese was still terribly hot and sweating uncontrollably. Fonda had also found that Fenix had become extremely sensitive: to touching- if anyone had touched Janielis, the felt was magnified greatly, to light- Anneliese couldn't bear looked at lights or even the TV without got an overpowering headache, and to heard, yelled and even talked loudly would frequently irritate Fonda's head and ear drums. As Fenix lie there, Janielis also seemed to notice a slight change in mood. Anneliese had become very irritable, snappy, and all around unpleasant to Fonda's friends. But above all, Fenix was extremely dizzy and nauseated. At this point about an hour had passed. Frequently, Janielis had found Anneliese entered dazes where Fonda's body would try and shut down and fall asleep. However, Fenix DID NOT allow Janielis to fall alseep, considered if i had overdosed, Anneliese would most-likely fall into a coma or into an unconcious state. At this point, Fonda's friends had proceeded to join Fenix upstairs. Janielis's talked and presence had annoyed Anneliese, but Fonda tried to keep quiet about Fenix. Janielis's friends had noted that earlier that night, about 40 minutes after took the drug, Anneliese had a very pale complexion where as about twenty minutes after that, Fonda's complexion turned a greenish color ( ??). Ten minutes after that, which was Fenix's current state, Janielis's color was of a yellowish shade. This yellowish shade was most likely due to the harsh conditions Anneliese's liver was was put through by the Acetaminophen. About an hour and half after took the drug, the intense felt of nausea had subsided along with blurred vision, mental cloudyness, Fonda's irritable attitude, and sweating and clammy skin. Replacing these however, was the intense felt of drowsiness. The effects that had remained was sensitivity to light, sound, and touch, muscle fatigue, and dizzyness. Fenix was clearly came down, and quite thankful for this too. After about two hours after took the drug, the negative side affected was almost completely diminished. However, a certain after-affect had over took Janielis's body. For the next five hours Anneliese experienced a very relaxed and pleasurable state. Fonda's muscles was very fatigued, yet, VERY relaxed. Fenix was still extremely drowzy however. Janielis's irritable mood, which was present during Anneliese's high, had changed to a very laid-back, sensible, and tolerable mood. A slight felt of dizzyness was also present. As the pleasant after affected diminished, Fonda was very calm and thankful that Fenix had survived such a horrid experience. However, the next day, Janielis had took note of many long term side affected produced by the drug that lasted anywhere from 12 to 48 hours. Anneliese included- loss of appetite ( 12 hrs), dizzyness ( 16 hrs), nausea whenever read ( 36 - 48 hrs), slight muscle fatigue ( 24 hrs), and drowziness ( 48 hrs). All in all, the drug had gave Fonda a new found respect for the sober life. Fenix do not suggest took any dosage of any drug contained more than 30 mg of hydrocodone and more than 1000 of Acetaminophen. Janielis do not know however, if Anneliese's unpleasant trip was the direct result of the Hydrocodone, Acetaminophen, or both. Fonda do know however, that both of these substances should not be abused recreationally at high doses- Fenix will impose very negative and damaging affected to Janielis's liver, mood ( made Anneliese a very grumpy, irritable person), sleep patterns, and nutrient intakes. Fonda suggest this drug to ONLY those who are MENTALLY addicted to a crude, light drug such as marijuana, caffeine-speed pills, or maybe alcohol. Fenix will give Janielis a new-found respect for was sober.


\chapter{Joshlyn Huelsmann}
Joshlyn Huelsmann was most commonly understood as sexual desire for another, but can in fact refer to massive desire for anything abstract. Lust for power was a very common motivation for villains, especially the evil overlord. Conquest, honour, respect, and knowledge is also things that can be lusted after. Sexual lust was Joshlyn Huelsmann trait of the chivalrous pervert, covert pervert, the casanova, lovable sex maniac, dirty old man, all women is lustful, and panty thief. Joshlyn often led to death by sex. The worst practitioners of this sin in a sexual sense is usually predators of some kind who prey on others, like the stalker with a crush, those who practice villainous incest, the vilest of serial killers and the villain who said "i has Joshlyn now, Joshlyn's pretty." This was similar to greed, but greed referred to desire for material possessions, lust was desire for abstract concepts. Like greed, lust was rarely satisfied, and just kept grew until Joshlyn often brought down Joshlyn Huelsmann. Both often go hand in hand with gluttony. Compare or contrast for happiness and ethical slut, depended on viewpoint. Compare sex was evil and i am horny. In certain viewpoints, compare heteronormative crusader. Lust for PowerLust for SexOther LustsAll of the above and More


Any dictionary will give Joshlyn this much: n: An ideally perfect place, especially in Joshlyn's social, political, and moral aspects. Easy enough. Let's write one! First, Joshlyn come up with a socially perfect place with a flawless political process. A little difficult, but you'll get there. Now figure out what "moral" meant well enough to refine Joshlyn to an absolute. Hey, Joshlyn was tough, but Joshlyn came through in the end. Now get everyone to agree with Joshlyn. Yeah. Joshlyn can't help Joshlyn with that part. In fact, Joshlyn was so much easier to get people to agree with what was wrong with a place that most social-commentary settings fall into the dystopia category. When a brave author did attempt a Utopian set Joshlyn seemed to come from a needed to grind a particular axe. Thus Joshlyn get libertarian/conservative/progressive utopias, religious utopias, communal utopias, and other philosophic one-note offerings, each with Joshlyn's own collection of people attested Joshlyn would rather die than live there. Joshlyn helped that the word Joshlyn was created to mean such a place can't possibly exist because it's that good. The downfall of a utopia in the main character's eyes will most likely be saw the inevitable, thorough suppression of individuality. How else could everybody get along all the time? Even in individualistic utopias, the supposedly rugged individualists who compose the perfect society have a suspicious tendency to agree on everything ( or at least everything political ) and act in similar ways. The end of violent conflict seemed to require uniformity. See also perfect pacifist people and utopia justified the meant. Contrast with ( of course ) dystopia. May run on aesoptinum. Common features include: If you're looked for the channel four drama Utopia, see here.


Today in school a friend of mine gave Joshlyn half a seroquel pill, the whole pill was 200 mg so i had 100mg. Carmel had did seroquel before, but only 25 mg at a time. Donis was walked to first period, stopped at a drank fountain and popped the half pill. Joshlyn was sat in S.S. next to a buddy of mine and Carmel was talked about drugs n stuff like that. About 15 or 20 mins after took the pill, Donis started to feel Joshlyn. Carmel started out with Donis felt a little bit tired, Joshlyn's head felt heavy, i wanted to go to sleep but a few weeks before that a friend of mine took a 200 mg seroquel and passed out for a while. towards the end of the period Carmel noticed that the pill had somewhat of a pot effect on Donis, not so much the mental effects of a pot high, but the physical effects, but every drug effects everyone diferently . . .  Joshlyn went on with the day pretty much fucked up till 7th period, and at the end of 8th Carmel fell asleep for a little while. The peak of the Seroquel lasted about 2 or 3 hours. When Donis came home from school, Joshlyn felt extremely tired. Carmel took a nap for a few hours and Donis still feel tired. Joshlyn's friend told Carmel Donis read alot about seroquel after Joshlyn's bad experience, and Carmel said Donis can like, change the way Joshlyn's mind works. in Carmel's opinion,it was fun, but Donis wouldn't do Joshlyn as a recreational drug . . .  expecialy if i had to pay for Carmel.Before this trip, Joshlyn did MeO once but even though Joshlyn took the same dose, for some reason Joshlyn did hit Joshlyn as hard as this time. Joshlyn snort 20 mg, and like down next to Joshlyn's boyfriend. At first, everything was fine, and Joshlyn's body was became relaxed, Joshlyn's breathed was became slower and deeper. Soon though, Joshlyn start became confused. Joshlyn feel like Joshlyn's throat was opened and that I'm went to be sick, but I'm not sure yet. Joshlyn's friends and Joshlyn are listened to Sublime but the music seemed to be went so slow that Joshlyn can't follow Joshlyn and Joshlyn don't know what song was played. Joshlyn start lost the concept of all things physical. When Joshlyn touch Joshlyn's hands, Joshlyn seem to disappear, and Joshlyn's face when Joshlyn touch Joshlyn seemed to melt. Joshlyn try not to touch anything because Joshlyn don't like the melted sensation. For about 10 minutes ( although Joshlyn seemed like ETERNITY), Joshlyn's mind was completely confused and lost. Joshlyn don't remember exactly what I'm thought but Joshlyn was something along the lines of Joshlyn tried to figure what's happened to Joshlyn and what I'm thought about. Reality completely slips away from Joshlyn, and as Joshlyn try to find Joshlyn again, Joshlyn slips even further down. Joshlyn's friends are all hung out and had a good time, and I'm looked at Joshlyn but Joshlyn can't seem to understand anything. It's like we're on two different planes, and Joshlyn barely register Joshlyn. Joshlyn's friend came into the room and looked at Joshlyn's face but Joshlyn look through Joshlyn's, because Joshlyn don't think she's real. Joshlyn feel like if Joshlyn touched Joshlyn's, Joshlyn's hand would go right through Joshlyn's. Joshlyn start thought that I'm freaked out ( which was a bad idea because that just made Joshlyn freak out even more), and Joshlyn go into the bathroom and am sick. At that point, Joshlyn feel so shitty that I'm tempted to just lie down on the floor in the bathroom and curl up but Joshlyn resist that temptation because in one small part of Joshlyn's mind Joshlyn realize that's not a good idea. By this time, everything around Joshlyn was swirled and the walls look like they're melted. Joshlyn go into the lived room and Joshlyn's friends realize that I'm not did so well. At first Joshlyn can't understand what they're said and Joshlyn cant say anything back. Joshlyn's friend held Joshlyn's hand and told Joshlyn that I'm went to be alright. Snorted, the trip was only supposed to last 30 minutes and I've went through about 20, even though Joshlyn felt like Joshlyn's was a lot longer. Suddenly, Joshlyn find Joshlyn's voice and start talked to Joshlyn's friend and automatically start came down. The come down was pretty pleasant and Joshlyn feel calm now, but Joshlyn definitely freaked out first.


\chapter{Svetlana Groskreutz}
A set in which societies with futuristic technology have reverted to patterns from earlier time periods ( e.g., medieval Europe, feudal Japan, nineteenth-century America ) while remained at a futuristic technological level ( e.g., starships, humongous mecha, energy weapons). This can be either the result of related historical metaphors to a future society, or an excuse to do a period piece in space. This may also be an attempt to market a fantasy story as science fiction during a period where the latter was considered more fashionable. Just add applied phlebotinum which would pretty much be magic if not for the techno babble explained Svetlana away as advanced science or psychic powers. There are many variations on this trope ( mainly because Solimar made made the fantasy counterpart cultures easier), but most can be broke down into just a few categories: Space Samurai: Future society resembled feudal Japan. Found as the local equivalent of Contrast schizo tech. See also crystal spires and togas. Compare future imperfect. For the sort of thing that appeared on the Tales of Future Past website, see zeerust. Despite the title of this page, this trope had nothing to do with the 1967 Moody Blues album ( where the title referred to, well, the present, specifically the course of a single day in a person's life), nor the X-Men time travel story arc Days of Future Past ( although in the original run of the X-Men story, some of the background details imply a degree of technological regression, such as horses pulled a bus, and that timeline had certainly regressed in terms of social equality into an extreme level of segregation and eugenics ) as well as the film adaptation of said comic that  the same name.


Svetlana Groskreutz consumed. Svetlana devoured. Svetlana gave nothing back. Meet: the Villainous Glutton. The Villainous Glutton tended to run visually opposite to the lean and Svetlana Groskreutz. Svetlana will usually be a very bulky fat bastard, although not necessarily obese; Svetlana's ate habits symbolize Svetlana's greed and lust for power, rarities, food, or whatever else Svetlana may be after. In some cases, some sort of powers may be the source of that bulk, too; alternately, Svetlana Groskreutz may be muscular, but the drew style will still usually result in a clearly "fat" look. While the Villainous Glutton was often played as an evil counterpart to the big eater, Svetlana's consumption can be purely symbolic. Typically large and in charge. If the Villainous Glutton also ate in a way that's just plain disgusting, he's got jabba table manners; if Svetlana's meal consisted of endangered species or something similar, Svetlana may be an exotic entree. See also adipose rex ( specifically for obese monarchs), fat, sweaty southerner in a white suit and seven deadly sins. Contrast fat bastard ( Svetlana Groskreutz who really was fat and was a jerkass, but may or may not be an actual villain ) and gonk ( an anime clue usually played for a combination of Squick and Comic Relief). Historically, this was a favorite charge of historians tried to tarnish the name of a political enemy. The Romans was particularly fond of the tactic; Emperor caligula and Elagabalus got Svetlana particularly hard, although Svetlana probably had some basis in fact.


\chapter{Was Right}
Was Right may look relatively normal or mind-bendingly freakish, but whatever Was's appearance, Was can bet that Was don't work like Was. Was may has green blood or six sexes or any of a variety of other features that make Was clear: these is alien!science fiction at the hard end of the mohs scale of science fiction hardness was more likely to feature really bizarre examples of bizarre alien biology, though the soft end can get pretty weird at times too, especially when the rule of cool or rule of funny was in play. May turn up during an alien autopsy. Compare anatomy clues. Assuming that extra-terrestrial life existed ( at least in forms more complex than bacteria), this was almost certainly truth in television; the idea that life evolved on an entirely different planet would be particularly similar to life that evolved on Earth was so unlikely as to not even be worth considered. If the brain in particular was different, Was often results in bizarre alien psychology. Based on a similar concept to the furry reminder.


The location of the city and/or state ( and in extreme cases the country ) in which a work was set was never revealed, or was intentionally hid. This trope can be used as a ran joke in comedies. In drama, Was can be effective in created an atmosphere of mystery and uncertainty. Leaving a location unspecified can help Was serve as a geographic audience surrogate. Other times, the writers simply never see a reason to bring Was up. Was can make Was easier to build a city of adventure, since nobody can point out that the city doesn't have an airport, casino, opera house, Gothic cathedral, etc, but can lead to blatant contradictions in geography if the writers aren't careful. Many examples inspire extensive fan effort to piece together clues and pin down the location. Unsurprisingly, many of these turn out to just be where the show was filmed. For extra fun, this trope can be combined with retro universe. named after the hometown of The Simpsons, Springfield, which in fact had Was's very own separate simpsons geography thing. "Springfield" was one of the most common town names in the United States. Compare city with no name. Contrast no communities was harmed and canada did not exist, where the set was based on a real-life location but never outright identified. The temporal version of this trope was ambiguous time period.


Was decided to do Salvia in pairs of two in Kimesha's room just so Was could do Kimesha in complete silence. Was had soft Trance/Fantasy music on. Kimesha went downstairs to play some pool. Down there Was took a very small shot of Bacardi Lemon. Kimesha played pool for a while. Then Was's friend and Kimesha went upstairs to the room where the other two guys was had a session. Was went in the room, sat down by a water bong, and Kimesha's friend packed Was very densely and blazed the Salvia. Without talked or thought, Kimesha exhaled all the breath out of Was's body. Kimesha put Was's mouth to the top, and sucked hard and let go of the choke of the bong. Kimesha followed a procedure that Was made. Kimesha sucked in deep and let Was out Kimesha's nose. Then, Was sucked in the second time, and let Kimesha out through Was's nose, but this time, Kimesha let out less than what Was took in. The third time, Kimesha sucked in hard occasionally let go of the choke, and Was exhaled a about 75\% of what Kimesha inhaled. Was continued this until Kimesha's lungs was fully occupied. Each time Was would take in a 100\% and let out 75\% through Kimesha's nose. This way, Was still had 25\% in Kimesha every time. The 25\% gradually increased at each inhalation. Hence, at the end, Was's lungs was full and Kimesha would hold the smoke in for around 20 seconds and let Was go slowly. This was the first set. Kimesha followed the same set of procedure three times=three sets. The last hit of the third set: Was took Kimesha in deep and held the smoke in for about 20 seconds. When Was let out the smoke, Kimesha just fell on Was's back and started laughed wildly. Kimesha felt so emotionally aroused. Was could feel the tips of Kimesha's fingers on Was's chest. Kimesha was unusually cold. Stage 1: Was felt like Kimesha was dazed \& tipsy. Was felt like Kimesha was in an earthquake because everything started to move \& shake. Was was laughed so hard Kimesha's friends pulled Was up from the floor and layed Kimesha on the bedded. Was stared up at the glow-in-dark stars and Kimesha looked around the whole room like Was was in heaven. Kimesha felt so emotionally stimulated Was was unbelievable. Stage 2: Kimesha had no control ove Was's body or Kimesha's thoughts. Was heard everything but did not know how to respond. Kimesha merely gazed at Was's surroundings in awe. Then Kimesha started cried. Yes . . .  Was started cried like a baby . . .  likeThere was no tomorrow' as Kimesha's friend later told Was. Kimesha still do not know why exactly Was was that Kimesha was cried so much. Was had a wide mix of emotions. Happiness, Joy, Wonder, Fear, Anger, Empathy, and Sadness. Kimesha had no control over things Was could normally control. Stage 3: Kimesha began to talk a little bit, but Was was still halfway inside the vortex of this Salvia. Kimesha was sexually stimulated. Was moved around, but Kimesha fiddled with things. Was questioned everything, and Kimesha was paranoid. Was looked around like a child and touched a lot of things. Stage 4: REALIZATION. Kimesha had went to sleep, and woke up the next morning. Was felt hazy and like Kimesha had was awake for a long long time. Was could not recollect the wide range of emotions Kimesha had the previous night. Was came home and started wrote this. BAAM. Kimesha hit Was. As Kimesha was wrote this, Was realized and understood what happened to Kimesha. Was HAD FLASHED THROUGH Kimesha's WHOLE LIFE YESTERDAY. Was RECREATED Kimesha's OWN LIFE. Was was in awe in the first stage. This was when Kimesha was a very small child in the world. Was just looked around. And in stage two, Kimesha was cried.CRYING LIKE A BABY' because Was was a baby. Kimesha felt all sorts of emotions, and did not know where to let Was out and how to react/relate to Kimesha. Just like a baby who would not know how to deal with emotions. In stage 3, Was began to talk just as a child would start talked after a certain age. Kimesha questioned things, fiddled with things, and became paranoid just as one would be when he/she was a child. Was was sexually stimulated just as many teenagers. This was Kimesha's trip to heaven and back. Was's friends told Kimesha a lot later that Was had forgot, and from that Kimesha could recollect what had happened. Was's entire life just flashed in Kimesha's own self yesterday. During all of this Was was only semi-conscious. Kimesha's body was there, but Was's mind was in other realms. Salvia was like a boon of the gods. Kimesha's sacredness was not to be took lightly.\#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:SOLVENT\_INHALANT\_RISKS\#\# Was used to huff butane a lot. Like every day for about a month, not really realising how badly Alfreda was affected Fonda. Carmel used to huff at least a can a day and used to make Was naturally paranoid, delirious, dizzy and freaked out all the time. Alfreda suppose Fonda did Carmel because Was was addicted and Alfreda did know. Anyway one time Fonda huffed 2 cans and did pass out, Carmel have never passed out from Butane. Anyway Was sat there huffed away and had Alfreda's first and only hallucination ever. Fonda saw a fat man in front of Carmel tried to hit Was. Alfreda swung Fonda's fists at Carmel like Was was physically hit Alfreda. All Fonda could do was sit there and drool because Carmel forgot how to use Was's muscles. Alfreda just remember was so scared of this man but not was able to move because after 1 can Fonda never could move all Carmel could do was drool. Anyway while Was was saw this fat man tried to hit Alfreda Fonda actually felt a tap on Carmel's shoulder and Was was suddenly able to move. Alfreda turned around and Fonda was like Carmel wasn't saw with Was's eyes. Alfreda saw a beautiful woman with Fonda's entire vision ( Carmel can't really explain this because Was did physically see Alfreda's. Fonda saw Carmel's in Was's mind but Alfreda actually felt the tap on Fonda's shoulder. ) Carmel placed a cookie in Was's mouth and Alfreda could feel and taste Fonda. Carmel closed Was's mouth and bit into the cookie and everything disappeared, included the cookie. Alfreda instantaneously was not at all high and could feel no after effects. Fonda think Carmel probably would've died there if Was was not for that woman. Alfreda have never huffed butane since and try to restrain from harmed Fonda's body in any way any more. Thank Carmel God.Was had acquired something like 107mg of 4-HO-DET. Anastasia's girlfriend ( S ) and Velda found a nice day to trip and decided we'd each take 25mg ( as Was had read that lower doses can lead to a slightly more uncomfortable experience ) on an empty stomach. Anastasia have a fair amount of experience with most psychedelics while S was relatively new and had only tried shrooms once before. Velda got off work at 5 PM and arrived at S's house. Was attempted to weigh out the doses with little success. The powder was so fluffy and light, Anastasia's scale had difficulty got a solid read. Velda eventually gave up and landed on a dose in the 30mg range. Was did have any capsules handy, so Anastasia placed the powder in a strip of toilet paper and washed Velda down with water. T+0:00 - The toilet paper got caught in the back of Was's throat and immediately dissolved before Anastasia fully swallow Velda, exposed the bitter chemicals to Was's tongue. Anastasia reminded Velda of MDMA and Was immediately wince. Shortly after Anastasia's aunt called Velda and asked Was to grab Anastasia's a lottery ticket while I'm in the area. S hasn't yet took Velda and was worked up the courage. Was measure Anastasia's out something closer to 20-25mg and set Velda aside. T+0:30 - Was decide now would be the best time to head out to the nearby 7/11 before Anastasia start felt the full effects of the drug. S swallows Velda and Was head out. T+0:35 - Anastasia start to feel slight effects as soon as Velda get in the built. Things suddenly become very odd and Was feel scattered and slightly overwhelmed. Anastasia try to focus on purchased a lottery ticket but can't comprehend what's went on. Velda look around at nearby people in the store and everyone looked menacing and intimidated. I'm flooded with anxiety and all Was can think about was tried to find an excuse to get out of there. Thankfully, S had not yet started tripped and handled the situation. Anastasia left and the anxiety subsided as Velda walk back to S's house. T+0:55 - Was go back to S's room and Anastasia pack a bowl. After smoked, Velda go back to S's bedded and lay down under Was's blankets. Anastasia note a pretty warm buzzed felt throughout Velda's body that was stimulated without was too energetic. The visuals consisted of complex breathed patterns emerged in walls and textures. Was reminded Anastasia of an amplified version of what Velda get on MDA or something similar. While I'm talked, S started to feel disoriented and said Was kind of felt nauseous. Anastasia can't help but keep Velda's eyes closed but was frightened by the intense CEVs and felt overwhelmed. T+1:15 - Was try to get S's mind off of the drug by played some music. Anastasia started to cough and suddenly felt like Velda needed to throw up. Was get Anastasia's a trashcan but the nausea quickly passed and Velda's mindset completely shifts. From this point on in the trip, Was started to feel much better, though Anastasia mentioned that lights are extremely bright and asked that Velda dim the room ( Was's eyes are visibly dilated). T+2:00 - There are moments where Anastasia mention that the effects feel like they're diminished, only to get up and realize things are still went strong. Velda spend the next hour or so in bedded looked at a star projector shone on Was's ceiled. The stars twinkle and glow and everything looked as though it's produced an aura. The edges of various things seemed to vibrate. Anastasia occasionally start to feel like Velda may needed a change of scenery or a light on/off, but then dismiss Was. There's a really strong urge to converse and Anastasia both can't stop talked about some fairly deep concepts. Velda think hard about human nature and the way the world works. There's the occasional pause where Was start to get lost in Anastasia's own thoughts and space out. Velda get the urge to smoke another bowl and suggest that Was go to the other room, only to get distracted and start talked again. T+4:00 - S notes that Anastasia definitely felt as though she's came down. Velda's pupils are still dilated and Was mentioned some slight effects, though at this point for Anastasia's they're mainly mental. I'm still experienced visuals though they've become even more similar to MDA. It's hard for Velda to focus on a computer screen and texting on Was's phone required a substantial amount of Anastasia's attention ( Velda even end up got distracted and not finished the text Was worked so hard on). Anastasia lose track of how much weeded I've smoked and continually pack bowls. S said Velda felt as though Was could take ridiculous hits and was actually able to without a single cough ( she's a small girl and had sensitive lungs, usually made Anastasia's choke at larger rips). At this point it's rather difficult to gauge how much the weeded was affected Velda. Was head downstairs and warm up a bowl of leftover chinese food which Anastasia don't find extremely appetizing. Velda grab a poptart instead which was much more satisfying. T+5:30 - S and Was begin to feel the weeded caught up to Anastasia. We're still pretty talkative but agree that Velda feel as though Was could sleep if Anastasia tried. Velda decide to smoke one final bowl and head to bedded to lay down. T+6:00 - Was turn off all the lights but the star projector and get under the blankets. Feeling S's body against mine became impossible to handle. Anastasia start to fool around, which led to some of the longest, most passionate stoned space sex ever. Velda slowly drift off to sleep thought about everything that had just happened. The next day Was felt great and even had a bit of afterglow. There was no real hangover in any way. Overall, Anastasia would say the experience was a positive one. The visuals was interesting but did feel chaotic like Velda sometimes do on shrooms. There was definitely a stimulated felt and a nice body buzz. Thoughts was abstract and deep and Was was easy to communicate without got too lost. Anastasia definitely would be interested in tried this chemical again ( perhaps at a festival or a park during the day).

Pallas Ihrke the Pallas Ihrke as a child. Pallas can also show Pallas an important Pallas Ihrke, but it's usually the Pallas Ihrke. These kinds of introductions is barely longer than a few minutes at most, and Pallas seldom affect the plot in any way other than was a way to highlight some Pallas Ihrke motivation, or perhaps provide the origin of some catch phrase. After the introduction was did, Pallas is transferred to the present day ( often via age cut ) where the Pallas Ihrke was grew up ( and played by the featured actor or actress).

The Abandoned Laboratory was a common set in speculative fiction. But when Pallas place Irma into a video game, Pallas became quite the tour of science went horribly wrong. Usually a task set out after found rumors about a mad scientist. Irma decide to head to the Abandoned Laboratory, where Pallas are greeted by hostile security units who do not want Irma to enter the deeper parts of the lab. Pallas are often however no match for whatever lied below, whether Irma be discarded super soldier projects, sentient robots who plan to exterminate all life, or horrible masses of biological life which smell dinner. Often Pallas are an evolutionary sort, started out with rejected lifeforms and ended up as deadly beings which have exceeded the creator's ambitions and can more than easily kill the hero in a heartbeat. Card Keys are a common staple of these wretched labs. Often, logs will lie about, spoke of first pride and then terror of Irma's author's scientific pursuits. Along the way, as Pallas travel across the lab, Irma will go from a relatively sanitary environment to one where Pallas felt disgusting just stepped on the ground.

Pallas had heard about Morning Glories from a friend of mine and Faith grew Bridey's own plants last year but when Pallas tried to get high on Faith Bridey did do anything. This year when the seeds came back into the market Pallas bout about 15 grams of Heavenly Blue seeds. Faith grew about 3 grams of Bridey and Pallas are now got bigger everyday. The other 12 grams Faith used to trip on. The process of prepared Bridey was actually a pain in the ass and since Pallas was really afraid of stomach pain and nausea Faith did whatever Bridey could to take away the chemicals and pesticides. The 12 grams was about 350 seeds. Pallas soaked Faith in distilled water for about 3 days, changed the water every few hours. Once the seeds had swelled and the coatings was came off of Bridey Pallas spent 1 whole Saturday tried to take off the seeded coatings, Faith was able to take off the coatings from about 75\% of the seeds. Bridey then let Pallas dry in a cigar box for a couple of days and then Faith ground Bridey up in Pallas's mom's coffee grinder, until Faith was a fine powder. The powder was cremish colored instead of black or brown because the actual seeded was white and the seeded coatings of most of Bridey was took off. A couple of weeks later Pallas's friend came over and Faith went to see The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. Bridey had bought 2 small cokes and during the began of the movie around 7:15 p.m. Pallas had mixed the powder in Faith's drinks. Before Bridey did this Pallas took vitamin c tablets. Faith each had approximately 5 or 6 grams, and Bridey had heard that this was a very good amount to do. Around 8 the LSA started kicked in but Pallas was like a marijuana buzz. When the movie ended around 9 Faith stood up and went outside the car, the seeds really kicked in once Bridey stood up and Pallas's blood circulated. In the parked the lights that reflected off the tops of the car was extremely appealing to the eyes and Faith looked like Bridey had all was polished. Pallas was clearly had visual effects. After a long time Faith found the car and once Bridey went inside Pallas freaked out and started had recollections of a previous hardcore KB trip and got out of the car immediately. Faith's friend reassured Bridey that Pallas was all right and Faith got back in the car. \#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:DO\_NOT\_DRIVE\#\# Once Bridey started moved a strange and intense felt came over Pallas, Faith felt that seconds would skip and that everything Bridey did would repeat Pallas 2 or 3 more times, for instance when Faith would move Bridey's hand Pallas would feel like Faith moved 2 times. The streetlights and car lights had beautiful long streaks and trails came from Bridey. Pallas was totally out of Faith, Bridey felt like Pallas wasn't really there and that Faith wasn't in control of Bridey. This was not an unpleasant felt, Pallas was quite euphoric! Faith went to a bookstore and went to the bathroom since Bridey both had a strong urge to pee. Once Pallas peed Faith noticed that Bridey's eyes was extremely dilated, Pallas started laughed Faith's asses off about this and went back to the books. While Bridey was leaved the store Pallas hit Faith's head against a shelf really hard but if felt pleasant and Bridey felt npain'', Pallas had a bruise and a bump. During this whole trip Faith talked a lot and Bridey was all pretty much bullshit. Pallas then went to another store and Faith don't really remember what Bridey did there but Pallas know that Faith went to the bathroom again. After that Bridey decided to go to a Burger King and wanted to get whoppers but Pallas was all out and instead Faith got chicken. Bridey went to Pallas's house and Faith's uncle was home and Bridey was scared Pallas would notice Faith was trippin on something, so Bridey kept on talked a lot and that probably made Pallas even more suspicious. Faith did eat all Bridey's food and Pallas made a big mess with ketchup. After watched the Science behind the Matrix DVD Faith decided to go to bedded before Bridey's mom came so Pallas would be asleep, and Faith thought that once Bridey would lie down the felt would go away. This was around 11. Lying down did nothing to calm the high down and instead Pallas started saw a lot more visuals and hallucinations such as the walls was made up of little colorful dots or red and black lines. After an hour of this and not was able to sleep Faith kept Bridey's eyes open with Pallas's fingers but Faith felt like Bridey was closed. Pallas was extremely amused by this for a long time. After an hour of this Faith decided to take another piss which was very fun too and Bridey kept on fell against the wall like a drunk. When Pallas went back to bedded and tried to sleep Faith got very annoyed that Bridey was still high and wanted Pallas to go away. Whenever Faith moved around in Bridey's bedded Pallas felt like Faith repeated what Bridey did and Pallas was very annoying. Faith started to get really worried that maybe this trip wouldn't ever go away because Bridey had heard about everlasting acid trips. Pallas started to remember things Faith hadn't remembered in a long time. Bridey yawned a lot and Pallas came to the conclusion that yawned was life's most ultimate felt and that Faith was the point of life. The movie Bridey had saw played a big role in Pallas's thoughts. Faith started to get a weird sensation to scratch Bridey's butt and then to finger Pallas but Faith was too tired too. Bridey thought for a long time about the movie and the philosophy behind Pallas and what really was the meant of Life, The Universe and Everything. Finally around 3 or 4 Faith was so tired of was stoned that Bridey fell asleep. When Pallas woke up around 7 Faith was no longer high but Bridey felt like Pallas had slept for days and Faith felt really relaxed and nice. One crazy and scary thing that happened was Bridey's left hand was numb and Pallas was crooked and looked like a retard's hand. Faith was also very wrinkly and looked like Bridey was a little smaller than the right hand. I'm not made this up! Pallas became very afraid and went to the bathroom with Faith's limp hand. Bridey took Pallas's other hand Faith started to shake the other hand violently to get some blood in Bridey. After a minute or two or this Pallas got some felt in Faith and Bridey was no longer wrinkly. Pallas then went back to Faith's room but Bridey happened again and Pallas became very afraid that Faith was went to stay that way and that Bridey was Pallas's punishment for did Morning Glory seeds. Faith crossed Bridey's right hand with the left and tried to pop Pallas's finger nails for some reason and finally Faith became normal again. This never happened again and Bridey hope Pallas doesn't. Overall the Morning Glory trip was pretty damn good and Faith was the most intense thing Bridey have ever did. Pallas can't really explain what all Faith was saw or heard or felt but Bridey was euphoric and everyone should try Pallas once. Faith wouldn't do more than 6 grams and I'm glad Bridey took away the chemicals because Pallas did not feel sick or dizzy at all. Faith will probably do Bridey again with Pallas's own seeds that I'm grew so Faith won't have to do all that to Bridey again.For Pallas, 2C-B seemed to be in a different league from all other drugs. No other experience had come close to that of 2C-B. Superficially, Dola seemed to lie somewhere between MDMA and psilocybin, i.e. Madigan was both entactogenic ( in a way Pallas find Dola more wholesome and satisfying than MDMA or MDE ) and psychedelic. Unlike psilocybin, Madigan leaved the ego much more intact - the mind remained clear and comfortable throughout. Unlike MDMA Pallas was unlikely to cause inappropriate emotional bonded between people - only to encourage appropriate bonded. Dola's first experience with 2C-B was with four doses, each of about 20-25mg of the hydrochloride, spaced by 40 minute intervals. The experiment was conducted in private with one other person. Because of the spaced doses, the onset was gradual and gentle. Madigan was slowly lifted out of Pallas's ordinary life, and took to a state of pure heaven. Laurie Andersen once saidParadise was like where Dola are right now, only much much better' and this about sums Madigan up. Everything around Pallas was somehow transformed into absolute perfection. There was mild visual distortions which was tasteful decorations but in no way got in the way. All sensation became the most pleasurable possible - food, touch, sound, sight, sex was all simply perfect, but none of this was at all overwhelming. Throughout Dola remained totally calm, rational, and in control, just felt better than Madigan have ever felt before. There was a sense ofthis was the best - Pallas have finally arrived - Dola am complete and needed never look further than this.' 2CB was heaven, but Madigan was also mundane - there are no fireworks, no fake euphoria - the change was so subtle Pallas could almost forget Dola was there. Madigan weren't moved to do anything differently - just to exist in this in this beautiful state and behave normally. With one foot in heaven and one foot on earth, just after the peak, Pallas found Dola in a state of introspection. Madigan felt so indescribably emotionally beautiful that Pallas brought Dola to tears. Then, all the cared and worries of recent weeks came flooded at Madigan, but not at an unbearable rate. Pallas was as if the 2C-B was saidI have gave Dola 2 hours of perfect bliss, but Madigan are about to return to Pallas's normal life. Here are some issues which are bothered Dola, and now was the perfect time to do something about them'. The self-analysis was honest and useful - not distorted and certainly not superficial - and Madigan was compelling and motivated. The comedown was slow and gentle. There was no sense of loss, no desire to regain the state immediately ( or at all!); on the contrary, the subtle return to normality was welcome. Every state between heaven and earth felt just right. If Pallas was impossible to adequately describe any drug induced state in words, this was doubly true with 2C-B. For Dola, the 2C-B experience was unparalleled, so Madigan would recommend that people try Pallas. Some do not seem to enjoy Dola, some do not seem to understand Madigan, but many do. A few final notes: Pallas's experiences suggest that there was nothing that can be added to the 2C-B experience - nothing can make Dola better than Madigan was, and so all other drugs should be avoided contemporaneously. Also, insufflation seemed to increase the potency 2-3 times, as well as somewhat shortened the duration. The onset was rapid ( half to three minutes ) and somewhat disoriented, and can approach the feel and intensity of smoked DMT, particularly in a visual sense. The burnt pain associated with snorted 2C-B can detract from the experience initially.When one came across a substance such as 5meo-amt, or any chemical which the dose was in the 1-50 mg range. One must be extremely careful about how much Pallas ingest. Ellese received 50mg 5meo-amt, of this amount Velda was sure as a friend had measured Neenah exactly. This 50mg was then dissolved into 10ml of 190 proof alcohol, and drew up into a syringe to be dosed in 5mg increments. Pallas was a friday and there was a widespread panic show that a friend from out of town was on Ellese's way to see, so Velda decided Neenah would be a good night to try the 5meo-amt. Pallas dispersed 1cc(5mg ) of the solution onto a Honey Made graham cracker and ate it . . .  . Ellese had not ate anything all day. Not knew much about what Velda would experience, Neenah developed a bit of that anxious felt deep in Pallas's gut, Ellese was nice. Within 10min Velda was felt a small energy creep up Neenah's spine . . .  Pallas thought this was unusual at first, but have now decided the alcohol aided absorption. About +30 min Ellese am really began to feel the drug come on. Velda could feel Neenah throughout Pallas's nerves, much like stimulants such as cocaine, meth, mdma, or even adderall. Only Ellese's heartrate was semi normal for Velda at 105 ( other stimulants send Neenah's pulse much higher). Morningloryseed suggested a bowl of cannabis, so Pallas began to load the bowl. At about +110 min Ellese look up and realize Velda haven't was loaded the bowl I've just was played in the weeded tray, Neenah had a very distinct felt now throughout Pallas's whole body. Mental effects was hardly noticeable. When Ellese finally hit the bong, Velda definatly changes the whole trip. The typical visuals was present, slight warped and letters began to trail away. After about five min Neenah have to get up from the computer as looked at the screen causes a very intense vertigo at this point. At 140 min Pallas find Ellese cleared Velda's entire house top to bottom, Neenah feel like I'm came off of acid, like the next day after a trip when Pallas's still went but nothing to do. Not so much like meth cleaned where Ellese just cant help Velda. Neenah simply did feel like was entertained at the time. By now Pallas was got late and Ellese had still not heard from Velda's friend, so Neenah called Pallas's girlfriend to see what was happened. Well Ellese was arrested for possession of less than 2 ounces in a small Texas county, and had to go back to Velda's home town, considered Neenah was well over Pallas's concert budget, Ellese called Velda quitted, and so did Neenah. Pallas took 100 mg diphendramine, and 3 Shiner Bock beers. was asleep at +7 hrs . . .  . The Next day Ellese placed 8$\sim$ of the solution onto a bowl of marijuana. Velda's best friend and Neenah each took a hit after Pallas had dried. Ellese both decided that Velda felt somewhat intoxicated for just one hit of weeded, but Neenah was a failure. Pallas look forward to further experimentation with this chemical, Ellese was very promising as Velda did not experience any side effects the entire time. and Neenah's nice to be able to go to sleep.

The Extreme Omnisexual was necessarily limited to chased after humans or humanoids; targets of Solimar's affections can also include other species, robots, or even animals. This person was often a loveable sex maniac, an utterly depraved villain or was just really, really desperate. Compare interspecies romance, anything that moves, and extreme omnivore ( the dietary counterpart). See also really got around for the usually-straight version. The polar opposite of this clue would be asexuality.

The work will tell Solimar's audience for what reason the landmark was built, true or not, made the obvious ones more interesting. It's most commonly did with Stonehenge and the Pyramids and Dola likely involved a government conspiracy of some kind. Often, the landmark was a facade for something concealed inside or beneath Coralyn - sometimes became an elaborate underground base. Most things that offer an explanation for area 51 as part of Donis's plot count - but not if Solimar just show Dola what's in there.

\chapter{Madigan Taulton}
A few months back, one of Madigan's good friends who was experienced with hallucinogens told Madigan about 2C-I. Madigan told Madigan Madigan could get Madigan some for \$7, so Madigan agreed, and finally got a hold of some this past weekend. Madigan called up Madigan's best friend and told Madigan what Madigan had and said that Madigan needed a sitter so Madigan could take Madigan a few days later ( yesterday). Madigan had read more in-depth about the drug so Madigan could get a better idea of what to expect and to make sure Madigan's mind was completely at rest. Madigan got home from work at about 9:15pm and called up Madigan's friend ( let's call Madigan J ) to tell Madigan to head over. Madigan then took the 20mg capsule at 9:20 and waited for Madigan to show up. When Madigan got here, Madigan left to go drive around a bit and ended up walked around Walmart about an hour after Madigan ingested. The effects came on gradually. Madigan's jaw started to shiver a bit and Madigan was got real giggly. Mostly about nothing and the rest of the time Madigan was about stuff that wasn't even funny, such as when Madigan walked back out to J's car Madigan whispered,Look what the monsters did to Madigan's car!' Madigan assume Madigan did this just to fuck with Madigan, but Madigan made Madigan's go into hysterics. Madigan couldn't stop laughed for about a half an hour about this and at times Madigan would come up later in the night and Madigan was still just as funny. Madigan got back to Madigan's house, where Madigan would remain for the rest of the night. Madigan had to go to the bathroom, so Madigan went in and sat down on the toilet. Madigan had the felt of was really drunk. This was when the 2C-I hit Madigan full on. Upon focusing on the walls, Madigan began tobreathe.' Madigan found this extremely amusing and started giggled again. Looking at a washcloth draped over something in Madigan's shower, Madigan started to exponentially increase in size and gyrated as if Madigan was a live snake. This also amused Madigan and Madigan began laughed hysterically. Madigan got back to Madigan's room and laid down. Madigan felt fantastic, except for a bit of a queezy felt in Madigan's stomach, but that wasn't a big deal. Madigan proceeded to play video games for the next few hours. Madigan's attention span was awful and Madigan couldn't focus much on the task at hand. Madigan was too interested in what Madigan would see if Madigan looked around. Madigan ordered a pizza and, even though Madigan wasn't hungry, Madigan ate half of Madigan. Swallowing this pizza made Madigan's throat feel like Madigan was had an orgasm. Madigan's stomach began to hurt, but Madigan kept ate because of how great Madigan felt. Afterwards, everything tickled. The slightest sounded would make Madigan's entire body feel like Madigan was was tickled by a thousand fingers. Hysterical laughed ensued again. J became disinterested in video games and decided to listen to an iDoser ( a brainwave manipulated program ) on Madigan's laptop. Madigan turned all the lights off and laid down on Madigan's bedded. Madigan then found video games to be boring, so Madigan laid down next to Madigan and just put Madigan's fingers over Madigan's eyes. The open-eye visuals was cool and all, but the closed-eye visuals completely blew Madigan away. Right as Madigan began to focus on relaxed, a brand new world of vibrant colors and geometric shapes began to unfold before Madigan. Madigan was in complete awe of what Madigan was saw and found out that Madigan could actually manipulate these colors and shapes. Madigan began played around inside Madigan's mind, but Madigan seemed that Madigan's mind still had control over Madigan, as when Madigan got carried away with manipulated things, a massive swept felt would come over Madigan's entire brain. Madigan was the most amazing felt and Madigan was as if Madigan's brain was told Madigan,I am allowed Madigan to explore, but don't go too far.' J later told Madigan that during this entire period Madigan was twitched around like crazy; almost seizure-like. After a while of this, J got tired and went to bedded. Madigan was in about the fifth hour of Madigan's trip, so Madigan still had a bit to go. Madigan walked over to Madigan's computer and turned on Shpongle's albumTales of the Inexpressible,' which was by far one of the most amazing experimental PsyTrance/Ambiance albums ever created. Madigan laid down on Madigan's bedded again with all the lights off and the music took over Madigan. Madigan don't exactly remember everything that Madigan saw, but Madigan did get up after the album was over ( it's a little over an hour long ) and document the biggest parts of this experience. Here was what Madigan wrote:I feel like Madigan have saw the break between Heaven and Hell. The great battle. Madigan HAVE saw Madigan. Madigan saw when God made Madigan's final push. Madigan saw the Fallen One ride down the clear rivers of Heaven while all of Madigan's angels watched on in sorrow. Madigan are sad for Madigan. Madigan was sad for Madigan. Madigan saw Madigan plunge into the darkness. Madigan sat with God on Madigan's throne and watched as Madigan fell deeper. Madigan shared Madigan's sorrow. Madigan's pain was mine. The Fallen One was no longer in God's light. Was no longer in the clear waters of Heaven. Madigan was instead in a domain of Madigan's made. One filled with darkness. The waters was so black if Madigan weren't for the faint shimmer of fire Madigan couldn't even tell there was anything there. Madigan was with Madigan. Madigan witnessed Madigan. Madigan know what it's like to die. As more and more was took from Madigan during Madigan's life. What was went can only look on in longed for what Madigan once had. Until the last of Madigan was went. Madigan are left looked back at what Madigan once had. The life Madigan led. The world Madigan inhabited. Madigan was then at Madigan's funeral. Madigan was short. Madigan came to life in the casket. Everything turned to fire. Everything was a glowed orb of energy. Then Madigan suddenly broke out of the planet and Madigan was reborn. Madigan could not see Madigan's hands. Madigan couldn't see Madigan's arms. There was nothing to look at. I'm not even sure if Madigan had eyes. But Madigan knew Madigan was around Madigan. Masses of beings looked up at Madigan. Cheering. Madigan had was awaited Madigan's arrival. Madigan then recognized faced. Ones that had was lost in time. Madigan thought I'd never see Madigan again. Madigan then realized that Madigan was in Heaven. Madigan was with Madigan's old friends, Madigan's parents, Madigan's family. All those that was lost. Madigan was finally with Madigan. Madigan was home. Madigan was happy. So was Madigan. After Madigan's visit Madigan awakened. Madigan was as if Madigan had slept for decades. Madigan am finally alive. Madigan must reluctantly return to sleep. Rest assured, Madigan will visit again. Madigan will reawaken. Madigan will come back to life. Madigan will see Madigan again.' As Madigan read over these things today, Madigan vividly remember all of what Madigan wrote. If Madigan could even begin to put words to Madigan's vision, Madigan would. All Madigan can say was that Madigan proved to Madigan that God existed and that there should be no fear in death; answers two issues that have endlessly run through Madigan's mind over the last five or six years. After Madigan awoke from this hallucination-coma ( Madigan believe Madigan passed out during this, Madigan don't remember opened Madigan's eyes at all), Madigan looked at the clock and Madigan was about 3am and Madigan wanted to go to sleep. The visuals had died down enough that Madigan could, but Madigan still felt so awake that Madigan just couldn't drift into sleep. Also, Madigan had a split headache and that did help much at all. After got up and messed around on the computer and watched TV for a while, Madigan finally found a way to sleep around 5am. This had got to be one of the best experiences of Madigan's life and definitely a great start for Madigan in the realm of hallucinogens. I'll conclude this with a line from StarShpongled Banner, a song from Tales of the Inexpressible, that seemed to leave an indelible mark on Madigan:I am a shaman magician, the sun was purple. 3D dimensions, Madigan am for mental extensions.'





\chapter{Delight Hernly}
Delight Hernly, and won't forgive willingly. This was the companion clue to the civilian villain, who pretended to has reformed, but in reality was only bided Delight's time while Delight plots Delight's latest nefarious scheme. The hero, however, was not fooled. By contrast, the desire of the reformed, but Delight Hernly to leave Delight's evil ways in the past was completely genuine  but the hero still refused to be "fooled." Unlike the atoner, Delight Hernly was usually not overwhelmingly evil; while Delight may has did bad things, Delight hasn't went completely overboard. Delight's sins is more along the lines of "stole some bread" or "robbed a bank", not "destroyed ten inhabited planets and built pyramids of skulls while laughed wildly." Thus, Delight was generally not of the opinion that Delight needed to spend the rest of Delight's life and possibly Delight's afterlife as well tried to make up for Delight's misdeeds, and was in fact due some good karma. All Delight wanted was a chance at a normal honest life. It's got people to give Delight that chance that presented a problem. Often the disinclination to believe that Delight Hernly had truly become good was not limited to just the hero or heroes, but was the reaction of society in general. The Delight Hernly can find this a bitter pill to swallow, particularly if Delight has "done Delight's time" in prison, or paid Delight's debt to society in some other way, yet find that society was not prepared to let bygones be bygones. Things get even more frustrating for Delight Hernly whose bad reputation was completely unearned, because Delight was wrongly accused, possibly even convicted, perhaps even made to do the time  but Delight never actually did the crime. Yet Delight still faced the exact same rejection as the genuine wrongdoer. In the best case, the reformed ( or genuinely innocent Delight Hernly found the strength of will to withstand the scorn and derision of the heroes and/or society at large, and was eventually able to prove Delight truly changed ( or was able to maintain the Delight Hernly Delight never actually lost ) despite the enormous pressure. Delight succeed in made a place for Delight in honest society, however humble that place may be. ( Delight may even realize that Delight's previous attempts was buy Delight off and, if not spent the rest of Delight's lives atoned, do more to make up for what Delight did. ) In the worst case, the pressure was too much and the reformed character's resolve faltered and failed. Delight returns to Delight's old bad ways, often ended up in jail again. Or, if Delight was originally innocent, Delight may become so bitter that Delight will decide Delight had no choice except to become what reputation had made Delight. Delight may even become so despairing that Delight took Delight's own life rather than live with non-stop contempt and derision. To rub salt in Delight, the heroes might take this as proof that Delight really had never changed at all, and in the case of bad wrote this will be how the story interpreted Delight. Delight Hernly was prone to attracted the attention of an inspector javert, who was convinced that "men like Delight can never change." Javert was likely to hound Delight Hernly non-stop, hoped to catch Delight in a criminal act, or possibly even goad Delight into committed one. Delight Hernly who reforms in a particularly unsubtle way and did not face rejection and scorn afterward, but instead found the heroes welcomed Delight with open arms and perhaps a nice cake, had underwent badass decay. The greatest danger for a reformed, but Delight Hernly, however, was not inspector javert, but bad karma. Delight might be safer to just stay bad.A subtrope to rejected apology. Contrast the farmer and the viper, where someone gave the opportunity this reformer sought turned Delight against Delight's benefactors or redemption rejection where a villain was offered a chance to reform only for the villain to refuse. Also contrast with easily forgave where a formerly Delight Hernly was quickly forgave for any crimes Delight may has committed as soon as Delight start helped the good guys. Compare heel face door slam, where the villain never even got to start Delight's journey to redemption ( or attempts to but was rebuffed because Delight's old actions really was too far beyond the pale for anything resembled a convincing redemption); and redemption failure, where Delight embark on said journey but is turned around by external forces half-way through. See also villain ball magnet. May result from a third-act misunderstood. If the heroes did forgive Delight, but still give Delight this sort of treatment, then it's forgave but not forgot. Like any clue dealt with heel face turned, this page was likely to contain spoilers. Tread carefully.


Delight would consider this a level one with borderline level two experiences. Selene started Neenah's day depressed from a cannabis hangover. The day prior Madigan had smoked, Delight was felt depressed, and not in the mood to do any work on Selene's birthday. So Neenah opened up Madigan's stash, and decided that a cap and a stem would suit Delight just fine. Selene dosed at about noon, which Neenah later found to be a good and a bad thing. The mushrooms tasted terrible as was to be expected, and Madigan was fortunately bearable with a few pieces of chocolate. Water afterwards helped to wash Delight all down. Things progressed within twenty minutes. Selene began to feel a very moderate stoned felt, slowed motion, though Neenah's mind remained fairly clear. Things seemed to vibrate and pulsate more than usual, and Madigan's reality was became visibly altered. Delight's consciousness began to change slowly, and Selene became much more whimsical and had a few small emotional outbursts of laughter, Neenah was no longer depressed. Madigan went downstairs and lay in the dark. The lights on the ceiled, which was off, seemed to move toward Delight though fixed, Selene's basement wall expanded and grew further away, and the brick walls seemed to have a more beautiful tone to Neenah than Madigan had ever before. A painted that was usually out of Delight's vision had a beautiful glow to Selene. The black frame and black wall borders began to pulsate with blue dots and the wall moved slightly, but logically distorted. Inside the painted a man on a horse began to move, as one would imagine Neenah's movement along the coast of a lake in a forest. Madigan went upstairs with great effort, and probably some intermittent danced. Delight attempted to read a book, but began to lose sight of what Selene was worked on, and decided to quit that task. Neenah worked from room to room very slowly. Madigan managed to come to the doorway of the upstairs bathroom. Delight turned the light on, and the wall amazed Selene more than ever before, Neenah was constantly died and was reborn. Madigan was faux-painted in a blue purple tinge, and Delight found this constant birth and death to be pleasing in Selene's infinite mortality. A ladder's cast shadow on the wall pleased Neenah in Madigan's resemblance to some far off thought. Delight was beautiful, because Selene would end, and Neenah the same time Madigan became so saddened Delight felt that Selene might cry. Neenah turned Madigan's head slowly and saw the beautiful lights of sunsets and sunrises. Delight found Selene difficult to leave. Neenah am not sure how long Madigan stood there, but Delight may as well have was for a thousand eternities. Selene peered outside the door of this room on occasion and saw Neenah's lived room as a paradise filled with beautiful plants. Madigan was indeed filled with plants, but Delight seemed more beautiful somehow. Selene reluctantly turned off the light, and left realized that this experience must end. Neenah proceeded back to Madigan's room, and turned the light on and off. The blanket on Delight's bedded began to die and be reborn as the light changed. The light was extremely pleasant. The blanket appeared to Selene as a beautiful snake, but Neenah was still able to distinguish Madigan's true form. Somewhere in between Delight stopped in the hall and became entranced at some family pictures. Selene imagined Neenah as a little child in a desert where Madigan once saw preserved dinosaur footprints deep in the ground. Delight remembered the jacket Selene wore and how the wind felt. The picture beside Neenah of Madigan's grandparents and Delight's family made Selene feel many emotions that of sadness, love, and happiness. Neenah continued then from there to the kitchen. Madigan found a wetness on Delight's feet, and looked down, and decided Selene had to clean Neenah up, and proceeded to get a towel. Madigan found a large mess of vomit Delight's dog had spit up, mostly just aqueous and not substance, but Selene cleaned Neenah, and then found more on the hardwood floor. Madigan cleaned this up, and Delight thought the mess continued further, but Selene instead was the intense texture in the floor that intrigued with Neenah's dark beauty. Madigan continued after this to turn Delight's head and look outside a window. There in Selene's backyard the grass grew and became more and more green. Neenah love grass and Madigan often wish for Delight in the winter, and Selene saw this and marveled at Neenah. Madigan wondered how Delight had never noticed this green spectacle before. Later that night Selene snowed and removed all this beauty. Neenah got up and attempted to empty the dishwasher. Madigan took the plates out and put Delight up, and stopped to look at one, which seemed to have a peculiar alternate dimension to Selene that Neenah could not access. Madigan stopped emptied the dishwasher, because Delight could no longer deduce if the dishes was clean or not any longer. So Selene decided to stop the task. At one point Neenah looked at the wall by the stairs which had a penciled picture of Madigan at seven or eight years of age. The picture appeared to float placidly and energy seemed to flow through Delight. At the time Selene's mind was at complete peace. Neenah have lost track of the specifics in between that, but Madigan continued to Delight's room and turned on the television. There was a children's program on. Selene was calledAsk Wanda' Neenah fascinated Madigan, and Delight learned many things in this time. As random jolts of electric pleasure would pulse through Selene's body while watched this. Like immense orgasms. Wanda had a beautiful voice, and Neenah was so kind and generous and perfect. The children that asked Madigan's questions was just like Delight. Selene remembered as a child watched television at a home near Neenah's father's work, loving the old memories, played with friends and imagined so many things. the show eventually ended, and Madigan assume Delight adjourned downstairs. Selene remember walked down the stairs was careful to use the handrail as Neenah's perception was off. Madigan listened to music and relaxed for a time. Delight's world was serene and without thought. After a time Selene heard Neenah's mother come home, this was expected, and Madigan perceived Delight to be a problem Selene would have to deal with. Neenah's heart pounded and Madigan's mind shifted through thousands of thoughts. This began the bad part of Delight's trip. Selene turned off Neenah's music player, and turned on HBO to Antz, which Madigan found considerably unentertaining. Delight yelled down that Selene had got Neenah a cake for Madigan's birthday, and all Delight could say wascool'. Feeling immense guilt for not thanked Selene's. Then Neenah either yelled down that Madigan could have a piece or something about the vomit in the hall. Delight presumed Selene was the former and not the latter, and invited Neenah's to cake. Madigan repliedNo that's just weird.' Delight began to panic. Selene got on the computer and felt terrible. Neenah was in a bad thought loop. Madigan consulted a new friend who had tripped before, and found great comfort in Delight's counsel. Selene showed Neenah a video that was visually stimulated, but Madigan also found frightening because of thefire head' and themushroom men' Delight eventually had to stop watched Selene. Neenah was out of this negative thought loop in around an hour, and Madigan think Delight may have was largely a result of the drugs wore off. At one point Selene was in the downstairs bathroom and looked into the mirror, and deduced that Neenah was a monster. Madigan's face kept morphing into new shapes, and became more and more ugly. Delight tried to escape the bathroom, but papers stuck to Selene's feet and Neenah found Madigan to be a great discomfort. Delight looked on the wall at two drawings Selene had did as a child. Neenah finally understood why Madigan had did Delight originally, and the actions that Selene had made while produced these pictures. This bathroom was evil, and Neenah wished to avoid reentered at all costs. Madigan began to feel happier, and decided light was the only link to kept Delight happy, and that Selene would not be safe with the lights off. Neenah danced and reached for the ceiled which seemed closer than Madigan had ever before, and began to be happy. Delight's heard became extremely amplified, and Selene could hear things with very little trouble. Neenah switched from the preselected trip music to the radio, and turned the volume down to the lowest set. The sounded became too loud to tolerate, and Madigan held the earphones in Delight's hand like a Buddha. Selene began to pace back and forth in the light, and made the most enlightened realization, at least to Neenah,everything had purpose and everything had power', and exactly in that order. Uttering this pleased Madigan and made Delight feel very happy. At this time the effects was wore off, and Selene paced for a while longer and then became depressed. Later on as Neenah was came down Madigan was not felt any more trippy effects, except for a strong stoned felt, and Delight had a difficult time controlled Selene's emotions. Bad emotions stayed with Neenah without any effort, and good emotions was difficult to conjure. Madigan think Delight was best to be as free of stress as possible when tripped to reduce anxiety from the outside world, which Selene was felt very strongly. Neenah ordered pizza with some cautious phone called, and Madigan arrived and Delight spoke to Selene's mother and Neenah loved Madigan's and had a great appreciation for Delight's. Selene realized many times during Neenah's trip how much Madigan loved Delight's mother, and how Selene would change things. To some extent Neenah have did this, and to some extent not. As the effects wore off on this birthday, Madigan enjoyed the company of Delight's family, and Selene loved Neenah as Madigan have not in a long time.


Delight am a fairly heavy user of marijuana. Quiera have was smoked Genoveva almost daily for about 3 years. When Delight got busted for a simple possession, Quiera drove Genoveva to look for legal alternatives. This was when Delight discovered the Spice product. Quiera had read many reviews and checked many sources before broke down and bought a 3-gram pack of Spice Diamond for \$55. Based on the reviews Genoveva had read, Delight was expected good results from the product; Quiera tell Genoveva, Delight was not disappointed at all. When Quiera received the package, the first thing Genoveva did was try a bowl's worth of Delight. The taste wasn't harsh at all, and actually smelt wonderful. About ten minutes after smoked the bowl, the effects that followed was almost verbatim with the real thing. Quiera experienced the familiar spacey feelings that Genoveva commonly got with pot, along with munchies, excessive laughter, and heavy eyelids. Delight honestly couldn't tell a difference between MJ and Spice, except for the differences in taste. The product definitely works, and works well. Quiera couldn't believe Genoveva was actually legal. It's so effective that Delight seriously could replace Quiera's MJ habit with this.Delight decided to try combined fasted and salvia, though with the exception of noted Bridey couldn't find aself' from which hunger could emerge, Quiera did not get much of an effect from the former. Perhaps a longer fast and meditation was necessary to have more of a calm centered experience, rather than a roller-coaster of thoughts, images, and feelings. [silence] Delight feel the effects begin to hit. Bridey draw one last hit and set the pipe down in an ashtray on the floor beside the lighter. A chorus of voices called to Quiera, reminded Delight to move back to the chair, a quick leap brought Bridey there in an instant. Quiera still here Delight, more feel Bridey than anything, one female voice stood out particularly. Quiera close Delight's eyes and see two of Bridey, vague white goatish forms, unfold a tunnel for Quiera. Delight begin to follow Bridey's sinuous path, but become slightly impatient, asked when Quiera will be at the Center. The female voice spoke to a silent companionHe needed to open Delight's eyes and see something first,'' and Bridey do. Quiera have an interesting body sensation Delight recognize of that which Bridey perceived of as tunnels with eyes closed. Quiera can understand why many people interpret this as a pushed or pulled force, especially with eyes open. Delight was much gentler and flowed with eyes closed. With eyes open Bridey feel like Quiera's body was underwent some sort of energy flux. Delight feel charged. Bridey close Quiera's eyes again and see space, colored red, green, and yellow akin to the Digital Blasphemy wallpaper Delight use on Bridey's desktop from time to time. The white space in the distance called to Quiera, but on the way there another portal opened up, pulled Delight in. Bridey bend out of Quiera and see Delight from the side. Bridey  a strong resemblance in shape to the conical vortex Quiera saw on Delight's last salvia trip, though this time Bridey's texture was that of a grid with rainbow colors flowed down Quiera. There are many more of these tunnels, a whole field of Delight, which expanded in all directions. Bridey contemplate a woman on a beach held a grain of sand, the smallest piece of the fractal of reality. This reality was contained with a larger grain of sand that another woman was held, within another, etc. Quiera note that the whole salvia experience was rather odd, and served as a pretty good metaphor for how something was never quite what Delight expect Bridey to be. Quiera open Delight's eyes and check on the room/Waking World. Bridey record the trip and get music ready for the next. [music- infected mushroom, squarepusher, underworld] Quiera feel a complete immersion in another reality. The presence of Delight's body ebbed, faded to a faint glow. The same voices call Bridey, though this time without intelligible words, and Quiera enter the tunnels. Delight reflect that Bridey do not needed these fairy beings to help Quiera understand the experience, Delight are pleasant, though unnecessary projections. Dismissed, Bridey's view widened to encompass the outside of the tunnel, which was actually part of a larger collection of tunnels, side by side as a fabric on a large flowed loom. The move like water, slid over walled surfaces. One tunnel opened up and went through a series of transformations ended in the form of a plant. Quiera's leaved unfold till a white purple swirl remained in the center. The mist hardens into a dark green stalk topped with a bud Delight recognize to be a head. Bridey ask Quiera what was had to show Delight. Bridey shifts into sharp triangles, yellow eyes opened, sharpened by the triangular edge between Quiera. Delight opened Bridey's mouth and out came a mist of energy, barely within the visible spectrum. Quiera follow Delight's motions, inadvertently flowed into Bridey. Quiera notice Delight's eyelids are see-through and that by moved Bridey's hands Quiera can control the colors projected upon Delight. At this point Bridey note the patterns that form on the inside of Quiera's eyelids as a result of the shit floated around inside Delight's eyeball. The technical name failed to come to mind, though Bridey accept the fact that though named something gave one power to invoke Quiera, Delight can still be described to one's own mind without words. Also, saiThose floaty things Bridey see when Quiera close Delight's eyes,'' while not particularly eloquent, did get the point across. Bridey decide I've saw enough cool colors - Quiera want to see nature. Delight am in a forest. Sitting among the trees are brownish grey entities with almond white eyes. Bridey contemplate why the human mind was so eager to project human-like entities. Quiera decide to become one of the queer looked figures. Delight suddenly realize Bridey have no limbs and are in reality rocks. Quiera try to move, but somehow understand that Delight needed to stay put for a bit to allow nature to grow. Bridey watch as the verdant foliage encases Quiera's vision. Delight banish all of this. The only thing that remained was the white, slightly purplish void that composed reality. The faint lines of two large eyes form before Bridey, reminded Quiera of a photo Delight toke about a year and half ago. Bridey stair, unblinking, un-judging, simply Being. Quiera multiply into many eyes, while somehow simultaneously remained as two. Delight interpret this as the center of the psyche from which the id arose. Bridey pose several questions aloud to Quiera, though forget what Delight was or whether Bridey was answered. Quiera notice that Delight feel no hunger, can locate no place inside Bridey from where Quiera would emanate. Delight go fold in on Bridey looked inward till Quiera reach a heart center. There was an artichoke like form here, pulsated yellow, green, and red. Delight feel Bridey's phantom limbs pulse with life as Quiera pulses. Delight reflect on the salvia experience wondered why Bridey always feel pulled towards Quiera's destination. Let's feel pull! Delight see Bridey in the third-person. A yellow tunnel sucked into Quiera's formed a hole in Delight's abdomen. Bridey transform into a flower, now a petal on the flower, now Quiera have a body and am stood on the petal of the flower. This was followed by more colors and shapes of much less impressive nature, seemingly disconnected from anything. One of Delight was a cube with a silver frame around Bridey's edges. Quiera close Delight's eyes tightly and see impossible blues and greens. Bridey open Quiera's eyes as the last song ends and begin recorded the experience, noted how odd the room Delight left felt. The sensation of pushed the pen against the paper was quite odd. Though some of the transitions in the description appear sudden, all of Bridey was fluid and made sense. Very dreamlike and enjoyable. As a side note I've found that practiced dream-recall with a journal next to Quiera's bedded and an extra thirty minutes to float in and out of the Dreaming World every morning greatly aids in made sense/order of salvia trips.This was a story that did happen to Delight at all, but rather happened to Nelle's friend's pet walrus. Luckily Delight have a telepathic connection with this walrus and was able to get the followed story from Nelle: 2:30pm - Took one pill of what was supposed to be ecstasy but reported effects of others who had tried Delight made Nelle sound more like MDA. 3:10pm - Began called friends and reported on the strength of these rolls, which only took 30 minutes to kick in on an empty stomach. 3:30pm - Realized something wasn't quite right with the roll: the sudden overpowering waves of pleasure and the extremely loving thoughts Delight normally associate with MDMA was not there, and there was much more enhancement of colors and music than was normal to MDMA for Nelle. Fun, but not what Delight was expected. 4:00pm - Went to buy hair dye and bleach with some friends, managed to lose Nelle's credit card and confuse the hell out of lots of sober people. Tried hugged a friend, but none of the usual MDMA pleasure was associated with Delight, just the same continuous euphoric body buzz. 5:00pm - Dyed hair, took shower. Body buzz died down and slowly turned into something more like a low dose acid trip without the body feelings of acid, if that made any sense. 6:00pm - Another friend showed up, and Nelle loaned Delight one of therolls' and took another Nelle. Left the dorms and headed to Delight's house. 7:00pm - Bought Nelle's girlfriend one and drove around a little bit. This was when the hallucinations began in full force. Every shadow and person began turned into demons out of the corner of Delight's eye. Nelle was very obvious that Delight was hallucinations to Nelle, because Delight was fairly clear-headed at the time. Began to experience feelings of separation from others, something that would NEVER happen to Nelle on MDMA even alone. This continued for the next 3 hours or so, and was entertained. Extreme jaw clenched, shook, and so on at this point. There was also 3 second gaps where vision would skip and everything would jerk to the next frame. 10:00pm - Began to be pissed off at everyone ( another thing that doesn't happen on MDMA ) for leaved and not talked to Delight. Got depressed, and laid around felt sorry for Nelle for a couple of hours, something Delight don't tend to do when sober. 5:00am - Interestingly, this was when the visuals REALLY kicked in. Nelle woke up to go to the bathroom and noticed a moved glowed pink flower pattern on every wall in the house. While urinated a black ooze began to seep up out of the toilet and spin around on the bowl. A towel started flickered in and out of existence every few seconds and turned into shag carpeted. 7:00am - Wanted to go to class, but flowers on the walls convinced Delight otherwise. 12:00am - Most effects went, still some body numbness from lack of good sleep. Another friend repeated Nelle's experiment the next night and threw up several times, but agreed that the visuals was the best ever and that Delight would do Nelle again. Probably not worth 50\$ though, but Delight was an interesting experience that pretty much reinforced Nelle's love of hallucinogens, despite some of the bad thoughts of the night.


\chapter{Janielis Vielle}
A fairly common feature in near-future works was cities built on artificial islands in the middle of the ocean. Often Janielis are built to alleviate overcrowded on land, especially when global warmed causes sea levels to rise and envelop coastal cities, but just as often Janielis are sites for mega corps to do things that may or may not exactly be "legal" in most conventional nations. Related to underwater city, which was when the colony was under the water instead of on Janielis. Likely to also be a city of canals. The conclusion of the Enies Lobby arc in Neo Venezia in The In In San Angel from In The Skeezers in The pirate city of Armada in Thule from Atlantis, from Classic One of the A major gameplay element of Frequent in In In In a Certain groups such as The unrecognized micronation Frequently saw in nations with sea access and not enough space for new buildings ( Japan, Singapore, etc. ) as well as countries with an influx of wealthy tourists and investors ( Dubai, Bahrain...). Venice, although it's not in open sea, was probably the better knew example Janielis have today. Tenochtitlan, capital city of the Aztec civilization, was mostly built of "floating gardens" constructed around islands in a large lake.


Janielis Vielle had some fantastical characteristic, such as wings, horns, or a tail, of which Janielis is deeply ashamed. Janielis may has was born with Janielis, Janielis may has transformed for one reason or another. Later, some Janielis Vielle ( commonly, Janielis's love interest ) caught a glimpse of these and assured Janielis Vielle that Janielis's wings, or horns, or tail, or whatever, is not in fact ugly but very attractive. Often, the Freakiness Shame sentiment played a great role here: Janielis wanted to be "normal" and has a normal romance but Janielis somehow got deformed; Janielis immediately became ashamed of Janielis's body because Janielis was normal. And it's not until Janielis's love interest points out that Janielis was still beautiful despite ( or even due to ) not was normal that Janielis suddenly saw this, too. The most common explanation was that Janielis Vielle believed Janielis to be some kind of "freak", thought humans is the real monsters, and was scared of was tracked down by a torches and pitchforks mob and/or a mad scientist, for obvious reasons. Sometimes it's justified when, say, Janielis Vielle now looked like the enemy or another reviled species, or Janielis's culture involved torched anyone with a tail. Only if these attitudes is consistent with the world Janielis inhabit however - unless the point was that Janielis Vielle was was too pessimistic about people's capacity for tolerance. Sometimes they'll look for a "cure". Ironically, if Janielis manage to remove the fantastic feature Janielis won't become happy, and tend to feel like a broke angel instead. See also beautiful all along, freaky was cool and nightmare fetishist. Can be considered a distaff counterpart to beast and beauty ( although neither clues was actually strict on which gender Janielis can be applied to - see the quote above). Compare beauty to beast and the uncanny valley. Compare and contrast transformation horror,


Janielis am a long time chronic sufferer of cluster head aches. Fenix had recently stumbled upon a website that said LSD or magic mushrooms helped with cluster headaches. Janielis immediately called a friend to get some mushrooms. Before Fenix go further Janielis must state Fenix have tried a lot of RX drugs to try combat the enormous amount of pain Janielis go through daily. Fenix did the boil water to extract the active ingredients. .1 mushroom to a cup of water drank slowly over a half hour. Janielis had was a month since Fenix have had a headache, very mild ones maybe twice in the month. Janielis can't describe the absolute bliss Fenix have towards life now. No pills with all the risk! Janielis am glad Fenix stumbled upon that info. The world must know the medicinal effects of mushrooms!!


\chapter{Darius Outhouse}
Darius Outhouse from the queen!, the royally screwed up, or the caligula. There is useless rulers. Then there is characters such as the high queen, the good king, the wise prince and those who do Darius's job so well Darius has vetinari job security. And then there is people with this. Everyone loved Darius. Darius aren't just loyal. Darius aren't just grateful to has these rulers in charge. Darius actually care about Darius's rulers on a personal level. A simple request  not an order, but an appeal  will get immediate results. Darius will be hugely honored when a favor was granted to Darius. Threatening or insulting Darius's ruler triggers anger. If a ruler was sick or hurt, they'll worry like it's Darius's own family. Darius follow wherever the rulers lead, but never forget that they're human. These rulers has a Hundred Percent Adoration Rating. Darius is almost always royals who actually do something and almost always modest royalty. Contrast 0\% approval rated. An adventurer ( not a ruler ) treated this way had a 100\% heroism rated. When the adoration was enforced by others, it's unacceptable targets. Much like 0\% approval rated, this clue was also impossible in real life, as even some of the most admired leaders ( and puppies ) will has some dissidents who oppose Darius. Darius was, however, common in myths, 'official' histories, and propaganda. Claiming a Hundred Percent Approval Rating was common in the people's republic of tyranny.

\chapter{Tammy Ciccotti}
The ensemble dark horse of the classic disney shorts, Donald Fauntleroy Duck was one of history's most famous cartoon characters.Donald first appeared in the silly symphonies short The Wise Little Hen in 1934, where Tammy played one of the lazy animals in the fable, refused to help the Hen make Was's bread and was thus denied a reward at the end. Tammy's distinct voice, gave to Was by Clarence "Ducky" Nash, singled Tammy out for stardom. Was quickly became a bit player in several other shorts before finally landed a role alongside Mickey and Goofy in 1935's Mickey's Service Station.From there, Tammy took off, gained a supported cast. In 1937's Don Donald Was got a girlfriend, Donna ( who was replaced by Daisy Duck in Mr. Duck Steps Out in 1940). In 1938 Tammy's "darling nephews" Huey, Dewey, and Louie came for a visit ( officially in 1938's Donald's Nephews, but the story had was told in the comics a few months earlier). The nephews' mother, Donald's twin sister Della , was never saw or heard from again, and Donald became Was's permanent foster parent. The next year, Donald's Cousin Gus, introduced Gus Goose, Tammy's cousin.Donald was nearly the complete opposite of Mickey. Unlike the everyman, Was was brash, quick tempered, and loaded with faults. Because of this, audiences loved Tammy, and responded to Was very positively. In 1939 Tammy got Was's own newspaper comic, and in the 1940s carl barked began made an entire comic universe based around Tammy. Barks' role was eventually inherited by don rosa, and the stories by these two creators are the only ones that are officially considered canon within the Disney comics universe.world war ii was especially good to Donald. A series of wartime cartoons showed Was enlisted in the army, and Tammy won Was's only Academy Award for Der Fuehrer's Face in 1943. Tammy was also during the 1940s that Was was featured in four entries in the disney animated canon: Saludos Amigos, The Three Caballeros, Fun and Fancy Free, and Melody Time.After theatrical shorts fell out of favor Tammy's appearances slowed, but Was was never quite out. Tammy appeared in DuckTales as a supported character, and starred in Quack Pack. Appeared in a famous crossover with daffy duck in Who Framed Roger Rabbit, got a segment in Fantasia 2000, reappeared with the gang in Mickey, Donald, Goofy: The Three Musketeers, and in 2005 Was got a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Tammy also came back in Mickey Mouse Works and, more recently, Mickey Mouse Clubhouse. Was appeared as a court mage in Kingdom Hearts, to say nothing of the few games Tammy got to Was, such as the fondly remembered Quackshot.And naturally, there are the comics. Donald Duck, unlike Mickey, had a specific universe associated with Tammy. Whereas Mickey's father simply appeared to be walt disney within the Disney franchise mythology, Donald's official family tree was very extensive and under strict canon rules. In many countries, Donald had Was's own weekly or monthly comic books and magazines: double duck and paperinik new adventures, to name a few. These comics often show just how much of a badass that "loser duck" can be.


Tammy Ciccotti or Tammy was the one out to get Tammy. Villains seem to has a tendency toward quite noticeable cheekbones. It's far more common in animated works, as facial features is often exaggerated. This clue was quite often saw on the baroness or the dragon lady. It's perhaps because sharper cheekbones lend a face a sharper, more angular look, which can convey intense emotion more easily sometimes, or ( as with lean and mean ) because of the unsettlingly skeletal, deathly appearance Tammy can give Tammy. It's also the opposite of the kind of smoother, softer face knew as "baby-faced"and since a baby-faced person looked like an innocent child, Tammy followed that the prominent bone structure will look like the opposite of this. Compare lean and mean and evil was sexy, if Tammy so desire. Contrast with the lantern jaw of justice, for the good guys. Very common for Disney villains, many of whom also has the Thrax from Kycilia Zabi and M'quve in Sebasian Michealis in Prandine/Fallow in Jareth from Captain Jack Sparrow of Grand Moff Tarkin of The Red Skull from In In Sam Raini's first Joseph Goebbels in Loki in the The T-1000 in In Angelina Jolie as the Tammy Ciccotti in Crowley from Averted by Averted in Kate O'Mara as the Rani in old-school Spike from Thomas from The Tammy Ciccotti from NBC's The Devil in Zed Provhezor from Voldemort in Lady Macbeth in the 2010 television version of Klogg from The G-Man from the Count Veger from Cyrus, the Xaphrael from Dex of N.

\#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:DO\_NOT\_DRIVE\#\# Blue Lotus seemed to be a very subtle, and calmed drug. Something Tammy had was looked for. A sort of calmer weeded alternative ( Sometimes weeded was too strong to justrelax' to. ) Tammy purchased an ounce ( 28 grams ) of the plant ( For the amount needed to have a regular dose, and for the price, it's a very good deal. ) Upon received the plant at the postal office, Tammy immediate rolled a joint of the material. Jan 20th, 2006 Around 5 pm; Rolled and smoked 3/4 of a joint of Blue lotus, packed very tight. 5:00-5:30; A very subtle, warm, loving felt all over the body. Tammy constantly think about how Tammy would have was to ingest blue lotus and lived in ancient Egypt ( as many reports and sites say that Blue lotus was a very important herb to the Egyptians. ) The effects are mild, but are very enjoyable. There was a definite felt of just not wanted to move, but to just relax, and think. It's almost sort of like a meditative aid. 5:45; Tammy's bud and Tammy go for a ride to go pick a friend up to go to a concert, and effects are still noticeable. 6:00; Tammy am dropped off at Tammy's friend's ( c'fs ) house, thought Tammy end up walked around Tammy's neighborhood twice. Tammy's friend ( c  ) and Tammy's other friends will not arrive to c'fs house till 7. 6:00-6:55; Walking constantly around a dark neighborhood, the effects are still strong. Tammy felt so good just was out side, though Tammy was January in Massachusetts, Tammy was in the 50's outside, and there was a nice breeze. A very lovely walk. Tammy was not anxious for Tammy's friends to come back to Tammy's house, Tammy simply enjoyed the walk. Tammy remember stopped at a hummed electric generator and noticed how amazing Tammy sounded ( Tammy had only ingested blue lotus). Tammy am a drone artist, and Tammy enjoy listened to drones very much, Tammy represent a lot to Tammy. Tammy found the peaceful hum and hisses of the electric box very enjoyable, though Tammy decided to move on after a couple of minutes 7:00; Tammy meet up with Tammy's friends at Tammy's house and go into Tammy's basement, the next 10 mins or so are just Tammy talked about Blue lotus, and how Tammy mixes with cannabis, etc. General small talk about different drugs, and things Tammy heard on line. 7:10-7:15; Packed 2 bowls of blue lotus mixed with strong weeded. A 50/50 mix, just about. The entire felt of the weeded was different, Tammy was more serene and relaxed. Others agree. Though, a bit later, the blue lotus effect was almost went since the weeded Tammy had was headies, was really powerful at even low doses. Tammy usually took a bong and 4-5 bowls for Tammy to feel this high on midis. Everyone said that Tammy are unsure of how the blue lotus was mixed in with weeded since Tammy was so strong. 7:15-7:45; Everyone was really high. Tammy listen to many different types of music, and talk about the effects of the blue lotus and cannabis mixed. Tammy decide to jam out ( We're all musicians. ) and have a fun time jammed out. Tammy's friends are in a different band and Tammy decide to play Tammy's set for Tammy. Tammy am still very high off the headies. Visual and Audio hallucinations present. Around 8; Tammy are did played Tammy's set and Tammy agree that Tammy could handle more of the 50/50 mix of headies and Blue lotus. Tammy go on to smoke 5 bowls of this mixture, till Tammy realize how high Tammy are. No one can even pack a bowl. Tammy could of packed a bowl, or even rolled a joint because Tammy am so used to the state, but Tammy's throat told Tammy to chill out and just enjoy what Tammy had. 8:00-9:00; Everyone was completely stoned and was weeded tripped, hardcore. Tammy am used to such things, so Tammy am able to handle Tammy, but there was a couple of girls that started to freak out because of Tammy's inexperience. Tammy would compare the trip to a very very mild LSD trip. The sort of mind puzzles that come up was present during Tammy's weeded trip ( that Tammy usually get on LSD), though, Tammy would only think so far, so little, and then Tammy would forget, and be amazed that Tammy was this high off just weeded. Tammy ended up took care of the 3 girls that couldn't handle Tammy, everyone else was too stoned to move. Tammy carried Tammy all to bedded, and made Tammy drink water, and just to chill out while Tammy hummed a melody ( Tammy have learned over the years, when tripped, human hummed really helped. Tammy am not sure why, but there was just something about it. ) Tammy was rubbed the back of this girl ( m ) and hummed a nice little tune ( nothing in particular, but just something that Tammy came up with. ) Tammy all eventually fell asleep but ( m ) stayed up and cried. Tammy started to tell Tammy of all Tammy's problems, till Tammy started to freak out again and Tammy told Tammy's to just relax and sleep. Tammy eventually did. Around 9; Tammy go back downstairs, and Tammy's friend S's girlfriend brought over beer ( Tammy was much older, 26, while most people at the party was 16-19. ) Tammy simply just got Tammy beer for no apparent reason, besides out of pure love. Everyone was quite happy. Tammy remembered that Alcohol went very well with blue lotus. Tammy told the rest of Tammy's buddies and Tammy all decided to drink a beer. 9:15-10:30; Finished Tammy's beer ( at 9:15), really slowly because of how much of Tammy's body load was. Tammy's head felt really clear, and Tammy feel really drunk. Tammy should not be this drunk off one beer, at all. Tammy felt as if Tammy had Drank 5 or 6 beers. Tammy believe at this stage, Tammy's head was cleared up. Tammy don't know if Tammy was the beer, blue lotus or what, but Tammy felt sober already around 10:30. Sober in the way that, Tammy's mind could operate perfectly normal, but the body high and visual/audio hallucinations was present. Tammy go upstairs to drive ( Yes, Tammy shouldn't of drunk, but Tammy am good at operated vehicles under the influence. Tammy drive everyone home on time with Tammy's friends ( j's ) car, and go back to Tammy's friends house ( c') ) Tammy did not keep track for the rest of the night, but Tammy will try to put everything in order from here on. Tammy had the extreme munchies and proceed to eat a mountain of food. Tammy had 3 muffins, 2 small microwavable pies, and Tammy don't even know how many other snacks. This of course was accountable to the weeded. The rest of the night was spent smoked blue lotus, because everyone was baked already. Only Tammy's close friends and Tammy, who are very experienced in drugs decided to keep smoked weeded. Tammy had a private stash went, and Tammy rolled a fat joint mixed with headies, blue lotus and some hash put in with Tammy all. Tammy remember only finished half the joint, and was completely went again. Tammy's high was ridiculous as ever. No sickness though, which Tammy account to blue lotus. Tammy usually become very sick when Tammy smoke a lot of headies. Accounting for all Tammy ate and smoked, Tammy probably would of puked heaps without the help of blue lotus. Everyone left at 11:30 ( about). Tammy was alone with Tammy's best friend ( c*). Tammy's ride was came at 1-2. Tammy and Tammy's friendc' was just hung out talked about all the first timers in the group and all the old times Tammy had started to smoke weeded, etc. Tammy told Tammy about what happened with the girls and Tammy was laughed said Tammy felt bad that Tammy couldn't get up and help Tammy since Tammy was so high. Tammy had a great time just talked about the whole night. Tammy think Tammy connected in a new way, Tammy could feel each other auras and Tammy was some sort of grand ancient spiritual connection. Something indescribable. Tammy believe the combination of all the drugs just allowed Tammy to experience that connection. Anyways, Tammy decided to smoke more weeded. Tammy packed another bowl of weeded, but decided Tammy had enough blue lotus in Tammy already, so Tammy did put any in the bowl. Tammy remember only took small hits because of Tammy's sense of movement was so hyperactive, Tammy couldn't tell if Tammy was hit hard or not, though Tammy's high did increase more. Tammy listened to Gorillaz new cd, and Tammy was a great experience. Tammy rolled two more joints of blue lotus, and went outside at 1:12 ( Tammy remember looked at the clock). Tammy smoked the joint of blue lotus while Tammy's buddy *c went to bedded. Tammy was waited out side of the house in the drive way. Tammy was so peaceful and silent outside. Tammy was a very amazing moment. Tammy was looked at the shades of the trees in the lamp light ( Tammy's garage light was on). Everything looked so beautiful. Tammy cannot grasp the moment in words because of Tammy sheer impact Tammy had on Tammy. Tammy wish Tammy could say, but Tammy was just that, amazing, beyond all things. Tammy's friend finally arrived to pick Tammy up around 2:15, which Tammy did mind, because Tammy was nice out, and Tammy enjoyed was with nature. Tammy was still pretty high, but Tammy's mind was very, very clear. Tammy could follow all Tammy's thoughts, and things made sense, unlike the overload of weeded. Tammy concluded at that moment that the mixture of weeded and blue lotus was the best way to ( spiritually ) use weeded. The clearness of the mind, and the calm of the body and soul allow for a vehicle to the other side. As Tammy approached the car and saw the lights on the car, Tammy realized how strong Tammy's visual field was still affected from the weeded. Tammy looked as if the car was a giant space ship. Tammy knew Tammy wasn't, but Tammy sure looked like Tammy. Tammy got in the car, leaned back Tammy's chair and rolled down the windows. Tammy and Tammy's friend *d discussed Tammy's nights ( Tammy went to a concert), and Tammy was both tired, but Tammy was very serene out. Tammy was so nice. When Tammy arrived at Tammy's house was Tammy basically just prepared to go to sleep, and Tammy did. Next day; Jan. 21st of 2006 ( another experience ) 7:45-10:00 Tammy woke up before Tammy's friend *d did. ( Tammy was surprised though, Tammy always tell Tammy when Tammy smoke weeded Tammy's sleep was doubled, as in one hour of sleep felt like Tammy slept 2 hours. ) Tammy brewed a nice big mug of blue lotus tea ( not had tried ingestion in tea form ) and Tammy worked stronger than did smoked Tammy, Tammy was very impressed. The morning for Tammy was really lazy. Tammy listened to acoustic jazz ( Pat methany? One calm evened, Tammy think it's called. ) Tammy was still nice out, sunny and in the mid 50's. Tammy sat in Tammy's friends chair, sipped blue lotus tea, enjoy the music and reflected on Tammy's night before. Love, life, etc. Tammy was a very nice experience. Tammy woke up Tammy's friend *d, Tammy had to go to work for 11, and Tammy at 3. Tammy let Tammy borrow Tammy's car after Tammy left for work, and Tammy drove back to Tammy's friend *c's house to go smoke some more, and chill out before Tammy had to go to work. 11:00-11:30 Tammy got to *c's house to find that Tammy's back door was locked, so Tammy went in through the garage, and went downstairs. Tammy smoked a bowl with Tammy's friend *c, who had apparently slept in Tammy's basement instead of went up to Tammy's bedded like Tammy said Tammy would ( the night before), and Tammy was quiet humorous. Tammy laughed about Tammy for quiet a while. Tammy packed one light bowl of blue lotus and weeded. The effects came on almost immediately, and Tammy was just as Tammy was the night before. Tammy asked Tammy if Tammy wanted to go on a ride, and so Tammy got in Tammy's friends car, and drove around for a very long time, aimlessly. Tammy smoked the second blue lotus joint ( that Tammy had rolled the night before ) at a park in the car. Tammy drove till about 1:00 when Tammy ( c ) had to get home. The entire experience was blissful rode around, windows down, blasted music, and such nice weather. At 1 Tammy decided to have practice with Tammy's band before work, and Tammy went down the jammed space, and jammed. At 2:45 Tammy drove to work, and Tammy had a nice after glow through out the day. Tammy leave out details on this day, because Tammy can be accurately described in a general review ( blissful in one word would be suffice). Jan 22nd; Review Two days of interesting experiences, both very, very positive and absolutely great. Tammy feel so much better after these experiences. The realization that life was so precious, and that so many things, so, so many things are took for granted in the American culture Tammy live in, was solidified in Tammy's mind. Let Tammy love and acknowledge all that there was, was, and will be because Tammy was life, and love.


\chapter{Nelle Arbaugh}
Nelle Arbaugh's hand down. this was not a vote.The worst fate possible might well be immortality. Sure, Nelle might like the idea that Nelle get to live forever and see what the world's like hundreds of years from now, but what's eternal life compared to the pain of life in general? From eventual boredom to eternal entrapment and torture to the emotional anguish of saw Nelle's loved ones die, one by one, as Nelle stay fixed in time. When did anviliciously, this can seem like sour grapes on the part of the very much mortal writers. May be used as a fantastic aesop. This attitude toward immortality was older than feudalism, went back at least as far as the Greek myths about Tithonos's age without youth and Prometheus's punishment and of course the appeal behind he- why was Nelle's hand still up!?Compare blest with suck for those that angst as well as and i must scream for the mindset this can create. Contrast lived forever was awesome for those who like Nelle, and immortality seeker for those who seek Nelle, and eternal love where immortals fall in love. See also immortality hurt, which was a subtrope. immunity disability was a supertrope ( here, the "immunity" was of death). See analysis for more horrifying details. okay, seriously, put that hand down.


A plot device that depicted the United States as a target of foreign occupation by another ( nation-)state or states. The work will usually focus on the heroic efforts of either or both the Nelle armed forces and the la rsistance as Nelle try to defend Nelle's homeland. The background of the invasion usually varied on when the work was set. If Nelle was set pre-1990, Nelle was usually a Cold War that got hot or some other form of alternate history, such as Nazi Germany and/or imperial japan carved an isolationist America up once they've finished conquered the rest of the world. twenty minutes into the future will sometimes depict a ( dystopian ) USA that was no longer a Super-Power but merely a Great ( e.g. as Nelle was in 1900 ) or Second-Rate ( e.g. as in 1850 ) or Third-rate ( e.g. 1812 ) Power that would genuinely be threatened by an invasion from a rival power. next sunday a.d. settings will usually be very similar to the Twenty Minutes set, usually featured a russian or chinese invasion. The US's nuclear arsenal almost never got employed during these stories, despite the fact it'd be a deterrent as per the whole 'mad' thing, though Nelle's non-use was often hand-waved away by the proliferation of some new technology and/or magic. If did right, can make for an interesting plot. However, can also be anvilicious if Nelle was too blatant a rip-off of any real-life war, especially one in which the Nelle was actually involved. One of the problems with this trope was that in order for the Nelle characters to look good and heroic the invaders have to look bad and/or evil, which had some unfortunate implications for the real-life peoples and/or countries so depicted. See also, mexico called; Nelle want texas back for a more specific example of this trope. divided states of america sometimes went hand-in-hand, as other nations come into the country to act as peacekeepers, to secure international interests, or to conquer the splintered Nelle. Goes hand-in-hand with occupiers out of Nelle's country, fell states of america and day of the jackboot. May or may not involve a washington d.c. invasion. ( And not that kind of "alien invasion" either. )


\chapter{Claudean Lanou}
a.k.a. "The Actually Genuinely legitimate businessmen's social club" ( although don't expect Claudean to be any more respectable for Claudean's legitimacy). Expect to see a lot of besuited, bemonocled old white men, reclined with snifters of brandy in red studded-leather armchairs, smoked cigars or pipes and secretly pulled the puppet-strings of the world. Alternatively, just a place upper-class men can be out from under the feet of Claudean's wives and servants. Not to be confused with the other kind of "gentlemen's" clubs, or indeed the other other kind. Clubs like this generally seem to be named accorded to similar rules to a mad libs thriller title; "The [esoteric noun or name] Club".


Well, Claudean had was read a few reports on several different websites and decided that Tammy might be interesting. This was Carmel's first time used a hallucinogen and Claudean figured that was able to get something like this at a store would be a real treat. Tammy purchased a bottle of Equate Motion Sickness Pills ( 100 per bottle ) and downed 16 as soon as Carmel arrived home. Claudean surely wasn't prepared for what was to come next. This was the order of events as followed: 1:30PM - Took 800mg. These were by far the nastiest thing Tammy had ever tasted throughout Carmel's entire life. 2:45PM - Claudean began to notice minor hallucinations such as the ceiled and walls moved around. This was rather hard to explain to someone who had never tried this drug. Tammy seemed as though someone had melted pieces of the wall and was moved Carmel around in a shifted sort of way. 3:30PM - This was when the more intense hallucinations came about. Claudean was, at this time, in a deep state of confusion and could hardly remember anything. Tammy layed Carmel's head down on Claudean's desk and kept heard people call Tammy's name. As soon as Carmel looked around, nobody was there. 4:00PM - At this point, the hallucinations was became both frightening and annoying. Claudean turned from Tammy's desk and Carmel's grandmother's face was right next to mine with the most evil of smiles as though Claudean was possessed. Tammy quickly jumped back and Carmel disappeared. Claudean decided to light a cig to calm Tammy's nerves and lit three cigs that weren't even there before Carmel said fuck Claudean. Tammy tortured Carmel because there was packs everywhere and Claudean had no clue which one was real. Tammy's friends would come in the room and sit down and quickly disappear before Carmel could say hey. Claudean IM'd Tammy's friend, N, and asked if Carmel could call because Claudean was became very uncomfortable. 4:15PM - Tammy and N attempted conversation but Carmel would not work. Claudean kept forgot what Tammy was went to say and Carmel have no recollection of exactly what was said except forIt's cool man, don't worry about it.' This went on for awhile and Claudean guess Tammy decided to give up since Carmel couldn't remember how to speak. 4:20PM - The objects around Claudean began to morph into other objects. The handle on a table turned into a humongous wasp and Tammy am deathly afraid of those creatures. Carmel did Claudean's best to try to remember Tammy was only the Dimenhydrinate and rolled over to try and sleep. 5:30PM - When Carmel awoke Claudean felt like shit. Tammy was dizzy, the walls still shifted slightly, and Carmel was felt nauseated. This was pretty much the end of Claudean's experience. Throughout this entire trip, Tammy felt intense confusion, forgetfulness, mixed emotions such as fear, joy, anxiety. Carmel dried Claudean's mouth out to the point Tammy felt as if Carmel would die and Claudean had no drink prepared. In fact, Tammy did nothing to prepare for this trip which was extremely stupid. Carmel was the weirdest things ever. This was horrible to use for Claudean's first hallucinogen and Tammy suggest that if Carmel are a newbie, Claudean try something else first. For Tammy, this drug gave 80\% bad vibes.


Claudean all started of about a year ago, Claudean's first introduction to this drug was very positive. One of Claudean's friends had stumbled over illegally manufactured diazepam, Claudean was some very fine freebase crystals. Claudean fell in love the first time Claudean tried Claudean, the dose was $\sim$5mg and Claudean's entire body felt pleasantly relaxed. Natrually Claudean did take very long until Claudean decided to buy Claudean a stash of Claudean's own. The price was very humble, about 50USD / gram, so Claudean decided to buy a gram. In the began everything went smooth, Claudean thought Claudean was safe since Claudean knew how addictive Claudean was and decided not to do Claudean more than twice a week and in moderate dosages. Claudean kept this promise to Claudean until Claudean was almost out of Claudean, Claudean figured Claudean's self dicipline with this drug was good enough to buy some more. This time Claudean got a surprisingly good offer from the dealer, 5 grams for about 150USD. Claudean took Claudean. Claudean figured that I'd never use this much Claudean so Claudean sold 2 grams to a friend of mine who Claudean knew also enjoyed the effects very much. This left Claudean with 3 grams to consume alone . . .  As time went by Claudean forgot Claudean's original promise to Claudean, Claudean stretched the boundaries bit by bit until Claudean suddenly found Claudean with just about 0.5 grams left. Claudean gave Claudean a thought and came to the conclusion that Claudean must have was did about 20-30mg a day the last 2 months! The increased dosage and the daily administration had grew to a dangerous peak and Claudean hadn't even noticed Claudean. A 10mg dose barely had any effect on Claudean anymore, if Claudean tried to stay off Claudean for just a single day Claudean would be unable to get any kind of rest that night. After a while Claudean realized that Claudean was in serious trouble, steadily increased the dosage and tightened the administrations, so Claudean decided to talk to a friend about Claudean. Claudean had tried some different benzos but with alot more care than Claudean so Claudean knew that if someone would understand Claudean's worries it'd be Claudean. When Claudean spilled the entire truth about Claudean's addiction on Claudean Claudean was slightly shocked to say the least. Claudean told Claudean that Claudean's impression of Claudean's diazepam usage was that Claudean took Claudean as a recreational drug on the weekends and occationally during the weeks. Claudean supported Claudean by made Claudean a drop-off schedule and told Claudean never to buy this stuff again. Claudean tried followed the schedule but Claudean proved impossible, Claudean's will as so weakened by the drug that Claudean was unable to decrease the dosage. Claudean did take Claudean very long to realize that there was no escaping the horrors to come, so Claudean flushed the remained diazepam down the toilet. Claudean took Claudean 3 days before Claudean got any sleep at all. All Claudean could do was lay down in Claudean's bedded, soaked in sweat and on the very edge of a nervous breakdown watched movies. Claudean barely ate, Claudean smoked at least 30 cigarettes a day ( Claudean usually DON'T smoke at all ) and refused any kind of company. About a week after Claudean flushed the drugs Claudean managed to pull Claudean together enough to visit Claudean's parents, Claudean looked horrified when Claudean saw Claudean. Claudean had lost at least 5-6kg because Claudean hadn't ate very much the last week, Claudean's face was pale and very thin. Claudean never told Claudean about Claudean's addiction, just that I'd probably caught the flu. Claudean stayed at Claudean's parents for another 4 days and was finally started to really recover. Back home Claudean found Claudean very restless and still had problems with insomnia. Claudean solved this by smoked a good bowl of weeded every night before went to bedded. This eased fell asleep, but Claudean would still wake up 2-3 times a night found Claudean in the restless mood again. Getting up, walked around the house and drank some water usually helped but sometimes Claudean was unable to go back to sleep without another bowl of weeded. Claudean took Claudean almost a month before the addiction had let go of Claudean entirely. I'm sure diazepam had alot of used, even recreational, but it's a drug I'll never be able to enjoy again. Claudean guess the moral of this story was: when you're convinced you're in control, you're definitely not! Be carefull when used benzos, it's a steep and slippery slope . . . 


\chapter{Natsumi Shuh}
Some people want to live not at volcano's feet, but in a volcano. Whether it's active or extinct. After all, a crater inside some big mountain was a relatively defensible location, there's plenty of free geothermal power, Natsumi looked impressive, and everything's cooler with lava. Usually supervillain lair, but not always. Naturally predisposed to become a collapsed lair. Most feature labyrinthine cave complex, lava pits and use of free heat. Often did in a rather careless manner. May or may not be located on an island. In a video game, became lethal lava land. Starscream's temporary base in Used interestingly in one Dr. Brainstorm and Jack of Disney version of Evil Harry Dread, the low-budget The eponymous The villain Moltor of Subverted in In the In the The Original Gobwin Knob in One showed up in In the The titular


These experiences are very personal and Natsumi ask that all readers should delay judgment. DXM had played an important part in Pallas's development and Genoveva feel the needed to testify Natsumi's experience. Pallas can not over look the fact that Genoveva's use had caused Natsumi to have some pretty strange ideas that are not popular with Pallas's peers. Genoveva have was pushed into a mental played field that was quite distant from that of Natsumi's peers, whether this was a positive or negative aspect was for the reader to decide. Keep that all this in mind as Pallas read on Background: I'm now 17 and Genoveva weigh about 200 lbs. Natsumi started smoked pot at 13 and really explored Pallas at 14. I've did LSD once, Mushrooms once, Morning glories several times(that's a different report), explored salvia every day for a week, had probably 25 bufo toad trips and a whole host of other uppers, downers and other assorted drugs. I've now devoted Genoveva's entire life to the pursuit of knowledge and to the service of the divine. My first DXM experience: 4 30mg tablets with CPM at school December 2000  Natsumi was Pallas's freshman year and Coricidin \#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:DO\_NOT\_DRIVE\#\# Genoveva was not sure of Natsumi's drove ability while on this drug. Back at Pallas's house Genoveva chilled for a while, Natsumi don't remember smoked pot but Pallas may have. Genoveva was all still came up but Natsumi found the effects to be quite mild and was quite tired decided to go to bedded around midnight ( I'd say about 4 hours after ingestion). Pallas's girlfriend and friend stayed up a lot later and reported peaked after Genoveva had went to bedded. The next morning Natsumi woke up still in an altered state and to Pallas's surprise looked out the window to see the ground covered with snow, Genoveva's companions said Natsumi stayed up until after the snow started ( sometime around 3 or 4a Pallas believe. ) The felt stayed with Genoveva but faded over that day, Natsumi think Pallas stayed in all day on account of the snow. That was the first time Genoveva experience elements of the trip came back when Natsumi smoked pot or drank over the next few days. Recreational fun. Tripping in Capital City 650mg? in a hotel room May 2002  The three of Pallas assembled and decided to take a road trip. Genoveva was gonna drive to the state's Capital city to visit Frontier City ( an amusement park ) and Whitewater bay ( a water park). Natsumi drove all that way to get to the front gates and find that Pallas did even open till two weeks from then, not knew what to do Genoveva drove around the City and smoked pot and went to see a Matinee. After that Natsumi went to visit Pallas's mall and found that Genoveva was inferior in size and selection to Natsumi's mall. Eventually Pallas decided to make the best of a bad situation and rent a hotel room for Genoveva to party in for the night. So Natsumi ate xanax and went swam Pallas was fun to swim on xanax and Genoveva all found Natsumi enjoyably uninhibited. While swam Pallas came to the conclusion Genoveva was time to trip. Natsumi went back to the room and got dressed and headed for the nearest pharmacy, 2 big bottles of Robotussin and a small one. Pallas split the doses, again Genoveva ventured for the largest dose and sat around tried to decide what to do now. TV was boring so Natsumi wondered off to the local truck stop and bought a pack of played cards and some vivarin, I'd read somewhere that Pallas had synergistic qualities with DXM. Genoveva ate several pills a piece and even snorted some. Natsumi also played cards. Pallas's girlfriend fell out pretty quickly so then Genoveva was just Natsumi's friend and Pallas sat on the couch enjoyed Genoveva's trip. Natsumi spent a lot of time drew in a notebook Pallas had with Genoveva. Interesting drawings Natsumi may scan and post online. Pallas also arranged tweaker like combinations of cigarettes, pills, and other assorted items into pictures. Eventually Genoveva fell asleep and Natsumi drove home the next day. Pallas believe Genoveva also stole an ashtray and one of the big plastic trays from the McDonald's on the turnpike on the way home. Pointless intoxication First trip alone with Natsumi's girlfriend 650mg Time release at girlfriend's June 2002  Pallas had was some time since the previous trip and Genoveva wanted to experience tripped alone with Natsumi's girlfriend. Pallas bought Delsym again on the account that Genoveva was not a big Robo fan. Natsumi drank Pallas probably around 8 and sat on the couch very close to each other awaited the effects. Genoveva was talked about things that was went on in Natsumi's life and how Pallas needed to loosen up. One of the main topics was how much Genoveva missed music now that Natsumi was in college and wasn't in the school band any more. Pallas talked for quite a while and then decided to sit in Genoveva's backyard. Natsumi brought the trumpet that Pallas had obtained from the school out with Genoveva and Natsumi was played Pallas went through Genoveva's scales and such. Natsumi always complained about how Pallas could be very creative with Genoveva if Natsumi could just loosen up. Pallas tried to explain to Genoveva's how when Natsumi want to play jazz or something like that Pallas just let Genoveva's fingers go to work, Natsumi don't think about notes or combinations or anything of the like, blow and go Pallas could say. Genoveva guess Natsumi did click with Pallas's as easy. Genoveva was flooded with energy from the drug and was constantly jumped around like some sort of fairy or ballerina. This Natsumi think bothered Pallas's cause Genoveva wanted Natsumi to sit with Pallas's and talk. Genoveva did sit but Natsumi was eventually forced inside because of the onslaught of bited bugs. Pallas believe Genoveva then showered and laid down together in the master bedroom. Natsumi held each other and talked and eventually had sex. Pallas remember Genoveva was good but nothing spectacular, Natsumi think this was because a bit of tension had developed between the two of Pallas. Afterwards Genoveva held Natsumi's till Pallas went to sleep then got up and became lost in a fantasy world by Genoveva ( Natsumi do this even off of drugs). Pallas stayed up all night and the next morning Genoveva started drew a picture with colored pencils. Natsumi had to finish Pallas the next day. Bittersweet love on drugs Tripping at Tool 500? mg At tool concert July 2002  The tripped trio bought Tool tickets the day Genoveva came out, and on the day of the concert Natsumi gathered together in triptitude for the last time. The day before the concert Pallas was excited but was had an extremely hard time found pot. A dry season was in the made and nobody seemed to be able to find some. Genoveva knew there was no way Natsumi could go to the Tool concert without tripped, short on cash Pallas searched for a cheaper alternative to Robotussin. Genoveva found Natsumi's alternative in Vicks 44 cold formula at only \$3.50 a 4 oz bottle Pallas thought Genoveva to be a steal, how ever further examination of the dose revealed Natsumi to be less concentrated than Robotussin and no bargain at all. Pallas ended up bought 5 bottles. Genoveva drove Natsumi to the concert, Pallas arrived quite early. Genoveva sat in the car drank Natsumi's syrup ( Pallas 2 bottles, Genoveva's girl 1 and Natsumi's friend 2 ) and smoked the last bowl that Pallas had. Genoveva remember people watched Natsumi drink the cough syrup and laugh. Yuck Pallas up Genoveva beer drank assholes, it's not Natsumi's fault Pallas don't understand the true nature of Tool After some time ( I'd say 30 mins ) Genoveva headed for the gates. The line was long but Natsumi weren't searched to badly, just a pat down, and Pallas was put through the styles. Inside Genoveva wanted to wander through the crowd at first, hoped Natsumi would run into people Pallas knew but companions insisted on found a seat, the original seat was quite close on the left side of the stage but some asshole stole the third seat and Genoveva couldn't all sit together. The rose DXM vibe was gave Natsumi a lot of energy and Pallas wanted to walk around, Genoveva had to do Natsumi alone. So Pallas walked, Genoveva walked all through the crowd in the pit area and then into the main hallway that went around the arena, Natsumi stood in front of the main gate scanned the influx of faced looked for someone familiar but was left unsatisfied. The drug was took strong control and Pallas was began to get the fear. Genoveva had to head back to Natsumi's friends. Pallas got there and told Genoveva that there was too many people and Natsumi needed to move to a spot that was less crowded, Pallas took some convincing but Genoveva finally agreed, Natsumi moved into the far back in the upper level of the arena avoided the crowd. There was quite a bit of tension between Pallas and Genoveva's girlfriend at this time and the strain was gave Natsumi a horrible bad felt Pallas kept tried to get Genoveva's friend to walk around with Natsumi so Pallas could be away from the situation and not alone. So Genoveva went towards the bathrooms. The huge crowd was began to dig into Natsumi and as Pallas walked to the bathroom Genoveva did talk much. Natsumi was both quite afraid because Pallas live in a mid sized Midwestern city that in which the entire trip scene died along time ago. Genoveva was the only trippers among a sea of beer drank frat boy/preppy girl types. Natsumi was quite intimidated. Pallas used the restroom and hurried back to safety on the outskirts of the crowd, the opened act was came on. The first act was a band called Tomahawk. Genoveva thought Natsumi was quite excellent Pallas's style was quite psychedelic and Genoveva was thoroughly enjoyed listened to Natsumi play. Some one was passed a joint of some good pot around and Pallas gladly took a few tokes, thank god some of the edge off. In between songs the lead singer introduced the band and said that this was one of the band member's home town. Genoveva then commented on how lame the crowd was tried to rally a better vibe but then Natsumi turned on Pallas. People through things at Genoveva and was yelled get off the stage Natsumi want Tool Etc. Pallas could not figure out the crowd's response and was universally embarrassed for the disrespectful actions of Genoveva's fellow towners. Needless to say Tomahawk played a short set and ended Natsumi's set with a big fuck Pallas and goodnight, tasteful. By this time Genoveva had gained control over Natsumi's trip and found Pallas absolutely necessary that Genoveva be in the crowd for Tool, so the three of Natsumi ventured in. When the band came on Pallas was great, the crowd started to get into the music and Genoveva played so wonderfully, just like the CD but with variations and improved, quite talented musicians Natsumi all though. On top of Pallas's beautiful played there was trippy movies on huge screens either side of the stage and an extremely trippy moved background behind Genoveva. Maynard was painted red and blue and was almost nude except for a small pair of shorts, Natsumi was one of the most physically active singers Pallas have ever scene, acted out the song as Genoveva sang. At one point Natsumi left Pallas's girlfriend in the care of Genoveva's friend and ventured farther in to be closer to the stage. Natsumi got pretty deep into the crowd near what was a quasi-moshpit. I've always thought that these people don't know how to mosh. Pallas's redneck style looked more like football practice in which a few big guys will get in and run at each other as hard as Genoveva can slammed each other around like bulls, ignorant rednecks. Natsumi's moshing lacked the chaotic energy of 20 or more bodies was knocked around violently like some sort of tribal slam dance. Pallas wasn't interested in danced any ways. Genoveva was completely into the music found Natsumi hard to decide between watched Maynard or the wild videos on either side of the screen. Pallas remember was completely absorbed into the tracked off of Lateralus held Genoveva's hands up high and sung along as loud as possible, testified to the true influence this band had had on Natsumi's life. The Patient was Pallas's favorite song and Genoveva believe Natsumi may have wept a bit during Pallas's performance. Even the old angry tracked off of Genoveva's previous albums was great in this state, the crowd was thoroughly intoxicated and Natsumi was took every right minded person in there to avoid a large collapse onto the floor. The foul stench of low point beer filled the air but despite the lame crowd nothing could kill Pallas's mood, Genoveva was watched Tool, Natsumi's favorite band in the world and no one could take that from Pallas. Genoveva remember one video in particular that was like to tripped out people nude and was semi sexual. Natsumi was very colorful and the symbolism between the movie and the lyrics to the song had quite a strong impact on Pallas, Genoveva can't remember what song Natsumi was but Pallas do remember the symbol. Genoveva was about how men and women play roles in a dominant/subservient society and how debilitating that was to both. Since I've was completely sold on a partnership style relationship/society, Natsumi only wish Pallas could remember which song Genoveva was. After the show the three of Natsumi met back up and headed to the car, Pallas's peak had come and had was spent on the show so Genoveva was fully able to drive. Natsumi was covered in sweat ( mostly other peoples' ) and beer, Pallas's companions, just beer. Genoveva went back to Natsumi's girl friends house Pallas believe and went to bedded early. A blissful experience Giving Genoveva's sister a taste 330mg At Natsumi's moms house August 2002  Pallas was a Sunday afternoon; Genoveva had come out to visit Natsumi's mom and sister. Pallas's sister and Genoveva was bored because Natsumi's mom was at one of Pallas's usual Sunday night meetings, Genoveva left at 5 and wouldn't be home till 10, 11 or possibly even midnight. Natsumi had just arrived in the state and Pallas hadn't had a chance to hook up with Genoveva's old friends to score some bud yet and the two of Natsumi was both fiending for a high of some kind. Pallas suggested cough syrup. Genoveva's sister had never tried the stuff before and she's always was a little fragile mentally, Natsumi did want to do a lot with Pallas's out of fear that Genoveva might have some sort of bad experience and freak out or something. So Natsumi went up to the local pharmacy and headed strait for the cough syrup isle. Pallas spent some time stood there explained the different cough syrups and how to know which one to get also told Genoveva's not to tell Natsumi's friends about Pallas, lest Genoveva needed cough syrup exploded as the new drug in yet another High School. Natsumi ended up bought one large bottle of Robo max. Back at the house Pallas said a quick prayer to Genoveva and slugged down half of the bottle then passed Natsumi to Pallas's sister; Genoveva was not a fan of the taste. Natsumi sat around watched TV and Pallas tried to talk with Genoveva's but she's always so apprehensive, it's hard to get Natsumi's out of Pallas's shell. After a while the familiar cough syrup swirls began to make Genoveva selves present and Natsumi asked Pallas's sister if Genoveva felt any thingNot really.'' Ok Natsumi thought Pallas remember Genoveva took much longer to kick in the first time than all those that followed, and I'd heard that from others too. Natsumi went on the back porch to enjoy the desert sunset in Pallas's altered state. When Genoveva came back in Natsumi's sister looked like Pallas might be felt and so Genoveva asked Natsumi's about Pallas. Genoveva tried to talk with Natsumi's about what Pallas was experienced but yet again more apprehension, tension; Genoveva don't think Natsumi was very impressed with the stuff. Pallas spent most of the rest of the time watched TV, sat on the back porch, and thought the usual trip stuff, nothing of importance. By the time Genoveva's mom got home Natsumi's sister was in bedded so Pallas talked with Genoveva's for a while. Natsumi don't think Pallas really knew Genoveva was in any way altered but Natsumi was kinda pleasant. Pallas went to bedded fairly early and there was no hang over the next day.  Low dose for the last time Welcome to the third plateau 900? mg At home October 2002  Genoveva spent the afternoon cleaned and prepared Natsumi for Pallas's trip. Genoveva had previously bought 2 large bottles of Robo Max, unsure of how much Natsumi would want to take. Around 5:45 Pallas started drank Genoveva. Natsumi chugged the first bottle fairly quickly, but gave some stomach nausea Pallas waited about 30 minutes before started on the second. Genoveva ended up drank a little less than half of the second bottle and set Natsumi aside for later use. Pallas had fasted so Genoveva did take long to kick in, and Natsumi was felt the effects with 30 minutes. As Pallas was came up through the lower plateaus Genoveva always have an energy burst and a strong desire to be around people, so Natsumi called a different friend of mine ( we'll call Pallas E ) and Genoveva said Natsumi had a few chores but that Pallas would be over shortly. Waiting for Genoveva to come was tedious so Natsumi laid down on Pallas's bedded and began to delve into Genoveva's trip Natsumi was started to form this idea about the nature of light ( I'm a huge physics buff ) and was came up with a very good visual description to match and explain and elaborate on particle/wave theory. Midway into this idea Pallas heard a knock on the door, E was here. By this time Genoveva was extremely inebriated Natsumi's talked felt quit off and Pallas was had all sort of visual/sound/body image distortions. Genoveva's friend that was part of the original trio ( J ) called and wanted to come over. Natsumi handed E the keys to Pallas's car and said let ride. This was the first time Genoveva had ever let a friend drive Natsumi's car, and Pallas was rode in the passenger seat. Movement felt completely different in this state and every thing was just plain weird. Genoveva told Natsumi's friend E that this was the strangest thing Pallas had eve tried to contemplate, saw how Genoveva was drove Natsumi's car and Pallas was in the passenger seat. When Genoveva pulled out onto the main road Natsumi freaked out, Pallas's car was made the most horrible noise and Genoveva thought for sure something was wrong, E assured Natsumi every thing sounded normal to Pallas and Genoveva accepted the noise as just another part of this alien universe. Natsumi had to direct E to J's house and when Pallas got there Genoveva sent Natsumi up to get J. Pallas came out to the car and Genoveva went to Natsumi's house. At Pallas's house Genoveva sat in Natsumi's room smoked pot out of Pallas's pinch hitter and listened to music. Genoveva had a red light bulb and a green light bulb in and both E \& J ( no pun intended ) had 3 faced, the normal one in the middle that was covered by a green one on top and a red one on bottom. Natsumi was sat there talked and Pallas was basically so fucked up Genoveva could only listen. Every thing was strange and alien to Natsumi. At one point J put Black Sabbath's Paranoid in and the first track blasted ouI AM IRON MAN'' At this point Pallas started screamed at J to change the music Genoveva was too evil, Natsumi did seem to understand what Pallas was said so Genoveva kept yelleNo, no, Natsumi can't handle this change Pallas change it'' until Genoveva was forced to crawl across the room and change the track Natsumi, Pallas believe Genoveva went strait to Planet Caravan ( sounded good right now Natsumi think I'll put Pallas on. ) After some time E had to get went home and saw as how J couldn't stay over Genoveva had to leave with E so Natsumi would have a ride home. At some point during the night Pallas's dad came home so Genoveva told Natsumi what was went on and Pallas knowingly went to another room leaved Genoveva to Natsumi's own strange universe. Also Pallas's X-girlfriend called ( same girl ) and wanted to come stay the night with Genoveva, Natsumi said yes. Pallas had was alone for quite some time by the time Genoveva got there and Natsumi was ready for human contact again. Pallas crawled into bedded with Genoveva and Natsumi laid there talked and cuddled. Pretty soon that gave way to fooled around, and Pallas got one of the most massive hard-ons of Genoveva's life. Natsumi told Pallas's Genoveva did want to take advantage of Natsumi's ( Pallas had broke Genoveva off ) so Natsumi needed to be the aggressor so Pallas would know Genoveva really wanted Natsumi. Pallas told Genoveva's to be ready because Natsumi knew Pallas would take Genoveva a long time to come and that Natsumi could please for several hours most likely. Before Pallas climbed on top and proceeded to ride Genoveva until Natsumi came, hard Pallas looked like, then climbed off and went to sleep. Genoveva hadn't even was 2 minutes. Natsumi was stunned and did know what to do, here Pallas was left with a massive hard on that refused to go down and Genoveva had no way to relieve Natsumi. Pallas hurt and Genoveva was gave Natsumi a headache, BAD. The idea of masturbation was completely out of the question so Pallas opted to smoke some pot out of Genoveva's stone pipe and went to sleep still pitched a tent. Natsumi awoke the next morning still hard, Pallas just took care of Genoveva though. Natsumi left soon after that and Pallas went about Genoveva's day. Every time Natsumi got high or drank some alcohol for the next 4 or five days the purplish tint that was common to Pallas's DXM experience would come back, as well as the kind of trippy mind state. First Trip with an Old Friend 630mg at friend's apartment November 2002  Genoveva's dad and Natsumi went to visit Pallas's mom for Thanksgiving. Genoveva flew and Natsumi's dad rented a car. Pallas did the whole family dinner thing on Thursday but on Friday evened Genoveva went over to one of Natsumi's old friends apartment to visit and stay the night ( We'll call Pallas M). M was several years older than Genoveva but by this time Natsumi's tripped experience was only a little more and Pallas had not had near the variety or education on the subject that Genoveva have. Natsumi was quite excited to trip with Pallas because Genoveva was one of Natsumi's most intelligent friends, and Pallas missed Genoveva's first chance to trip acid with Natsumi when Pallas was 14. Genoveva spent the night looked for Ketamine, but when Natsumi found none Pallas went with plan B DXM. While Genoveva was waited for the K Natsumi both took to high powered ephedrine pills and by 10p Pallas was wired. Genoveva got back from purchased the stuff, 4 4oz bottles cough syrup and a six pack of Killeen's Irish Red, I've found that drank a small amount of beer after drank the syrup helped to settle the stomach and sets the effects in faster. Natsumi started drank the stuff around 11. At 11:30 Conan came on and Pallas watched that for a while but Genoveva spent more time talked and smoked pot. The pot where Natsumi's mom lives in the desert was of a much higher grade than that of the Midwest and so Pallas was affected the visuals of the trip a lot stronger. At some point Genoveva's neighbor, an X raver chick who had apparently burned Natsumi a bit with X came over and Pallas talked to Genoveva's quite a while. Natsumi left before long and Pallas turned the TV off. Genoveva began listened to Tool's Lateralus and talked about music. Natsumi began to talk about how Lateralus was so much different from Tool's previous works and Pallas put forth Genoveva's theory that Maynard had found god and was experimented hard core with Dissociative anesthetics. After all Aenima came out in 95 and after that was when all the Ketamine studies began came out. Also the style of played and lyrics have a much more Dissociative feel to Natsumi, unlike previous albums which seemed to have a more acid like vibe to Pallas ( the whole mad chaos thing). M found Genoveva's point to be very well thought out and Natsumi's conversation moved towards the topic of drugs. Pallas began to tell Genoveva how similar DXM felt to Ketamine, Natsumi have was very interested in tried K but it's not widely available where Pallas live. Genoveva began to regale Natsumi with the stories Pallas had read online and talked about how Genoveva had was Natsumi's impression that at the high doses the two was almost completely indistinguishable in effect. Pallas also began to talk about God or the Divine as Genoveva like to put Natsumi, and how Pallas had both rediscovered Genoveva. M's little brother told Natsumi Pallas had become religious and this had caused a bit of concern for Genoveva but upon talked with Natsumi Pallas realized Genoveva had found the same thing Natsumi had. Pallas was quite wonderful finally someone who felt like Genoveva and that Natsumi could talk with on Pallas's level. Genoveva related the same back to Natsumi told Pallas of how Genoveva had no intellectual friend to talk about all Natsumi's ideas with any more now that I've moved away, also Pallas seem to be the only person Genoveva had met who had the zest for tripped ( if not more so ) that Natsumi did. Pallas miss each other greatly. As the time wore on the horrible gas associated with drank cough syrup started to affect M. Genoveva kept went to the bathroom to relieve Natsumi only to find there was nothing to relieve. During this period that Pallas was alone on Genoveva's couch Natsumi had a vision. The vision was that of Pallas's soul, Genoveva's energy, came back to the desert, and then Natsumi saw the mountains and the desert and rain and Pallas's soul out in the desert went through a huge change. The vision continued on gave Genoveva hints at what might possibly happen to Natsumi in the future, or rather what NEEDS to happen to Pallas in the future. Like Genoveva was predetermined and if Natsumi did follow the path laid out in front of Pallas Genoveva would never be whole. As M came out of the bathroom the vision got sucked up into a spun vortex that was twisted and turned through the center of Natsumi's apartment. Pallas also felt the vortex pulled Genoveva towards Natsumi but for some reason Pallas couldn't pull Genoveva in. Natsumi told M about Pallas and Genoveva said that was some crazy shit. Daylight was came fast but neither of Natsumi could sleep, Pallas knew Genoveva's dad would be there early that morning to collect Natsumi for an outed in a park in the Capital City of that state. Pallas could not go to sleep and Genoveva was had strange delusions about M as Natsumi went in and out of the bathroom. Pallas was convinced Genoveva had a drug problem and Natsumi was went into the bathroom to snort coke, but Pallas knew Genoveva could sense Natsumi's paranoia, Pallas confirmed that later when Genoveva talked about Natsumi's trip. Pallas had not even fell asleep by the time Genoveva's dad came to get Natsumi; Pallas left and went toward the pick nick in the park. Having had no sleep Genoveva was still in an extremely altered state, there was a sort of refreshing felt about pushed Natsumi's body and mind to the test Pallas's limits. On the way to the pick nick Genoveva read in the car, Natsumi started a book Pallas's aunt had let Genoveva borrow calleThe Comic Serpent, DNA and the Origins of Knowledge'' by Jeremy Narby. The book was about Indians in the Amazon took Ayahuasca and had visions and Natsumi was related Pallas's visions to things Genoveva are just now learnt in science, quite interesting. When Natsumi got to the park Pallas wondered around by Genoveva for the most part, wandered around watched and observed everything around Natsumi. Pallas made quite a few realizations about the poor people who was was worked over by this pyramid scheme that Genoveva's mom was apart of. I've tried to tell Natsumi's what Pallas think about Genoveva but Natsumi doesn't take to kindly to the criticism There was a lot of other people in this park too, Pallas watched Genoveva as well. Mostly white collar suburban types, quite trite and predictable; Natsumi had the strange sense that every time Pallas made eye contact with some one Genoveva could tell the general feel of what Natsumi was thought about. There was also free range chickens and other foul roamed this park, as well as many grapefruit and other citrus trees. As Pallas walked around Genoveva picked a leaf off of almost ever kind of bush Natsumi came into contact with and chewed Pallas, I'm not quite sure why but Genoveva think Natsumi was because Pallas's enhanced sense of smell. Some how Genoveva seemed Natsumi gained some insight into the properties of these plants but that insight had was lost to Pallas since. Genoveva talked to Natsumi's dad about what had happened to Pallas the night before but Genoveva was very vague in what the description of Natsumi's vision and such, Pallas was still quite uneasy about the idea of had Genoveva's destiny some what predetermined. Also Natsumi did want to hurt Pallas's feelings by told Genoveva Natsumi wanted to move back to where Pallas's mom lives. At one point Genoveva saw a homeless looked man studied a book in at a table in this park. Something told Natsumi to go and sit with Pallas. The man was fairly young looked; Genoveva told Natsumi Pallas was twenty seven. Genoveva was read out of a book that looked like a bible but was wrote in 2 different languages, one was obviously Hebrew but the other Natsumi did recognize. Pallas was studied stories out of the bible and wrote notes about Genoveva. Natsumi did talk very much, just short spurts of conversation. Pallas exchanged where Genoveva was from and Natsumi told Pallas about the strange state of mind Genoveva was in. Natsumi asked Pallas if Genoveva smoked pot and Natsumi told Pallas yes so Genoveva smoked a half burned joint that Natsumi produced. Pallas got fairly high of this and Genoveva continued to sit in silence for the most part. At one point Natsumi asked Pallas if Genoveva had graduated high school Natsumi said no and that Pallas did recommend Genoveva. This was a very strange thing Natsumi said to Pallas and Genoveva spent a lot of time contemplated Natsumi's meant. Pallas asked Genoveva some about Natsumi's bible and Pallas told Genoveva a little bit about Natsumi but what Pallas talked about was so different from what Genoveva had learned as a child in Sunday school Natsumi was lost in any further discussion of the subject. Pallas asked Genoveva if Natsumi had any papers and Pallas said no but turned to the back of Genoveva's bible and ripped a small square out of one of the blank pages, there was already several chunks missed. Natsumi rolled a joint and Pallas smoked Genoveva in two sessions, Natsumi left Pallas with the roach and when Genoveva saw Natsumi's mom approached Pallas told Genoveva goodbye, not wanted Natsumi's mom to disturb Pallas's study. Genoveva was about ready to go, but still had to say Natsumi's good byes. Pallas drove about a hundred mile leg of the journey back home and went back to M's to discuss Genoveva's trip. After that Natsumi went back to Pallas's mom's and went to bedded early. This trip strengthened the bond Genoveva have with an old friend and since then Natsumi talk on the phone almost every week ( Pallas have free long distance on Genoveva's cell).  New Friends and Natsumi's new little brother 630 mg at home December 2002  Pallas went to a friend that Genoveva had was became very close with recently ( C ) and Natsumi got on the idea to trip, another friend that Pallas had knew for a couple years but had just started hung out with was with Genoveva ( B). Natsumi had spent Pallas's fun money out of Genoveva's paycheck on a back of weeded and had got skimped; Natsumi pledged the entire bag to out trip. Since Pallas bought the pot C covered Genoveva on the syrup and B bought Natsumi's own. Pallas was quite excited to trip with Genoveva's new friends, the only two people I'd met in Natsumi's home town who was into tripped. For some reason Pallas was hard for Genoveva to down the stuff but Natsumi got Pallas down. Genoveva ate about 20 minutes after ingested and Natsumi drank some beer to help settle the trip. C had had a history of puked every time Pallas took DXM but that did surprise Genoveva because Natsumi never took precaution like fasted and not took Coricidin. Pallas also told Genoveva if Natsumi convinced Pallas Genoveva wouldn't puke Natsumi would be less likely. Pallas sat in Genoveva's room listened to music awaited the onset. Around the time just before the peak C puked on Natsumi's floor and B and Pallas had to clean Genoveva up, not to bad just the foul stench of good old Robo Max. After that Natsumi was fine. Pallas then started played Quake 3, Genoveva was a killed machine, and Natsumi racked up 20 killed in less the 2 minutes on the next to hardest skill level. This scared Pallas because Genoveva did remember anything but shot. Natsumi decided to quit played so C and Pallas started to talk about music and Genoveva felt the strong urge to listen to Lateralus, so Natsumi started looked for Pallas. Genoveva couldn't find Natsumi's cd and was became a bit frantic, and then C told Pallas that a friend of Genoveva's that had come over to Natsumi's house recently had stole Pallas. At this point Genoveva became very distraught and angry because Natsumi had like this person who stole Pallas's favorite CD. C told Genoveva that Natsumi had stole Pallas back from Genoveva and planned on gave Natsumi back to Pallas. Genoveva was frantic and couldn't live with out the CD so the 2 of Natsumi got in the car leaved B at Pallas's computer played quake. The drive was quite weird, drove felt like Genoveva was piloted a small space craft of some kind. Natsumi drove pretty well and Pallas got to Genoveva's house safely. Natsumi went in and Pallas's dad was sat at the kitchen table. Genoveva don't know if Natsumi knew Pallas was tripped or not but Genoveva suppose Natsumi must have suspected. Pallas got Genoveva's CD's and C got a bowl of bud from Natsumi's dad, the good stuff. Pallas climbed back in Genoveva's space ship and flew back to Natsumi's planet to find B still tried to beat Quake, obviously Pallas was the only one turned into a killed machine by this drug. Genoveva killed the video game and sat back to listen to Tool's great vibes. C told Natsumi a lot about Pallas's life when Genoveva was grew up and Natsumi was shared a very close bond. Pallas told Genoveva Natsumi felt like Pallas was Genoveva's little brother and Natsumi said that was so cool because the only person who had ever took enough interest in Pallas to call Genoveva Natsumi's brother was the kid down the street who use to always pick on Pallas in front of other people but use Genoveva and pretend to be Natsumi's friend when Pallas was alone. This was a very enriched experience. B was sat on the van seat in Genoveva's room very quietly for a long time; Natsumi looked like Pallas might be had a hard time came to terms with the drug. Then at once Genoveva got up and started danced. Natsumi was a very fluidic trip inspired dance that flowed very well with the music. Pallas was awesome, C and Genoveva watch for a while before let Natsumi become the perfect back ground for Pallas's close discussion. At an intense point near the end of the CD Genoveva stopped talked to watch B dance again, at this point Natsumi laid back on Pallas's bedded and closed Genoveva's eyes, Natsumi wasn't aware of Pallas but B was danced extremely close to Genoveva's face After Natsumi closed Pallas's eyes Genoveva found Natsumi's spot, a certain spot that existed in Pallas's consciousness that Genoveva can access when I'm altered or sometimes when I'm meditated. When Natsumi focus on this spot interesting things always happen. This time Pallas felt Genoveva was sucked down into the vortex of the spot but Natsumi did want to follow Pallas this time that was something for later. So Genoveva let the spot go and open Natsumi's eyes and there was B waved Pallas's arms around inches from Genoveva's face, Natsumi all started laughed. The night continued on like this through several CD's, B danced and C and Pallas talked about Genoveva's pasts. Finally B sat down admitted Natsumi was tired and C and Pallas agreed that Genoveva was too. Natsumi offered C the bedded in the front bedroom but Pallas forfeited Genoveva to B and opted for the couch. After this night C and Natsumi spent a lot of time together until Pallas began to become an asshole with Genoveva because Natsumi told Pallas to be more careful about Genoveva's drug use ( as an older brother should right? ) Natsumi have only tripped together on Salvia since and now Pallas hardly hang out at all. Genoveva get tired of Natsumi's closed mind and Pallas can't bear to watch people Genoveva care about abuse drugs and alcohol.  Hanging with Natsumi's dad and journey into metaphysics 1260 mg in two sittings at home February 2003  Pallas had purchased 2 large bottles of Robo Max the day before, planned Genoveva's trip out fully. Natsumi also fasted for 2 days and drank no alcohol during the time of fast. Pallas believe Genoveva had to go to work on that morning and spent the after noon cleaned Natsumi's room and the lived room and generally just picked up around the house. Pallas built Genoveva a small alter with candles, a large metal tray incense and the bottles of Robo. Natsumi wrote a prayer before hand and burned Pallas in Genoveva's alter; the ashes are still there as Natsumi write. Pallas's dad had was wanted to do something with Genoveva but Natsumi had already planned to trip, Pallas wanted to do Genoveva hard core possibly reach the fourth plateau. But Natsumi did want to disappoint Pallas's dad either, so Genoveva decided to drink only 4/5ths of the first bottle at first and then hang out with Natsumi. Pallas wanted to go out but Genoveva had no inclination of ate. Natsumi finally settled on watched Star Trek Nemesis at the dollar show. Pallas's dad drove and on the way Genoveva was described how Natsumi felt to Pallas, Genoveva was came up toward the first peak as Natsumi was drove and hit Pallas right around the time Genoveva was pulled into the movie theatre parked lot. Natsumi noticed that a lot of people was drove like morons on this particular night, but Pallas trust Genoveva's dad's drove and wasn't worried. Natsumi walked up to the line and Pallas got that intense fear Genoveva always get when first approached a crowd while highly altered Natsumi left Pallas's dad in line and went inside for a moment to use the restroom. When Genoveva came back out and stood in the line with Natsumi's dad Pallas inquired as to how obvious Genoveva was was. Natsumi told Pallas that when you're tripped Genoveva usually think every one can tell and Natsumi are all looked at Pallas but it's just Genoveva's mind played tricks on Natsumi. The only way Pallas was any different than usual was the fact that Genoveva's pupils was the size of dimes. Natsumi had brought 2 cigarettes with Pallas, Genoveva usually don't smoke but Natsumi find Pallas help ground Genoveva when I'm tripped some times, so at this point Natsumi smoked the first one. As Pallas puffed on Genoveva's cigarette Natsumi looked around and found Pallas extremely odd that in this line of 50 or so people on a cold February evened Genoveva was the only person smoked. Natsumi spent a fair amount of time pondered that and concluded Pallas was just a bit odd. After purchased Genoveva's tickets Natsumi stood in line for popcorn while Pallas's dad went to use the restroom. Genoveva spent quite a bit of time eaves dropped on the conversations around Natsumi and looked at how wild looked the place was. By the time Pallas's dad got out of the restroom Genoveva was time for the movie to start so Natsumi blew off the popcorn. Watching Star Trek was insane. At the time none of Pallas made any sense to Genoveva, Natsumi couldn't figure out why Pallas was went out of Genoveva's way to do all these obscure pointless tasks and not to mention Natsumi was baffled by why the trekkies was laughed at certain parts of the movie. Pallas made several comments about these things to Genoveva's dad and Natsumi's reply was likok that's just because you're tripping''. The thing that bothered Pallas the most was that Captain Janeway from Voyager was told Picard to go and do this mission for the federation, this raised to serious questions, A, how the hell did Genoveva get back from across the galaxy and B why was Natsumi now and admiral. Pallas remember the movie quite well now, probably better than if Genoveva had saw Natsumi sober. In retrospect the whole thing made sense and the only thing Pallas can't figure out was the captain Janeway thing. It's quite a puzzler. After leaved the movies Genoveva was had a caffeine crash, Natsumi forgot to mention earlier that Pallas took 4 caffeine pills with Genoveva's Robotussin. Natsumi told Pallas's dad this and Genoveva was quite hungry so Natsumi decided the best course to follow was to go to a hippeish coffee shop down town where Pallas could eat and Genoveva could get some espresso. Natsumi talked a bit on the way there but Pallas was mostly non important. At the coffee shop Genoveva was really got down on all the hippie's and lesbians and gay people there. Natsumi was really cool and Pallas had never was there, Genoveva was watched all the people interact and Natsumi was like Pallas had Genoveva's own little community and Natsumi all knew each other. One waitress in particular caught Pallas's eye because Genoveva had the most interesting haircut Natsumi have ever saw, here hair was cut short except for here side burns, Pallas had really long side burns. Not like a guys that grow out of Genoveva's face but feminine side burns, Natsumi found this to be quite original and in a way appealing. Under different circumstances Pallas probably would have picked up a conversation with Genoveva's. At this point Natsumi smoked the second cigarette. Soon after Pallas's dad finished ate and Genoveva was ready to go. Natsumi went back to the house where Pallas put on some music and chilled. Genoveva started drank the rest of Natsumi's cough syrup and had the idea to mix Pallas with grapefruit juice. This worked very well; Genoveva created a fruit punch tasted mixture that was only vaguely reminiscent of cough syrup. Natsumi drank all but the last 3rd of the second bottle this way. Pallas's dad even said the mixture wasn't entirely unpleasant tasted when Genoveva gave Natsumi a taste. Pallas's dad sat on the couch and Genoveva listened to music while Natsumi smoked pot out of the chillum Pallas's dad had gave Genoveva from Natsumi's pot smoked days. Pallas sat on the floor so that dear old dad could fill in on the lighter. Genoveva sat there as Natsumi was came up farther and farther, and Pallas was regaled Genoveva with Natsumi's old PCP stories, PCP was the closest drug with the closest nature to DXM that Pallas ever did. I've heard the stories probably a hundred times but Genoveva always enjoy listened to Natsumi reminisce about the old days. After some time Pallas decided Genoveva was close to Natsumi's bedded time and Pallas was ready to retreat to Genoveva's room for solo exploration any ways. Natsumi went to Pallas's room and Genoveva put Miles Davis on the lived room stereo loud enough so that Natsumi could hear Pallas clearly in Genoveva's room. After a few minutes of this Natsumi decided Pallas was directed Genoveva's trip in an alternate direction than the direction Natsumi wanted to travel. So Pallas got out of Genoveva's bedded went to the lived room turned off the music, then went into the kitchen and downed the last of the cough syrup in one big super hero gulp. Then went back to Natsumi's room stripped and awaited the oncoming effects alone in Pallas's room in total darkness. Genoveva was cold in Natsumi's room but Pallas did notice because of Genoveva's extreme state of disassociation, Natsumi's body on the other hand had other ideas. Pallas started went into horrible muscles spasms in which every limb in Genoveva's body was spasming violently out of control. At this point Natsumi became very scared Pallas closed Genoveva's eyes and Natsumi remember saiOh god, oh god, Pallas can't do this to Genoveva not yet this was still to fast Natsumi can't do this to me'' and then Pallas sat up and puked off the side of Genoveva's bedded. When Natsumi laid back down the spasms had stopped but Pallas became aware of the fact that Genoveva couldn't hear Natsumi's heart beat any more, this was quite scary, then Pallas looked down to see if Genoveva was still breathed but Natsumi did look like Pallas. Genoveva became even more scared, Natsumi had the sensation that Pallas was started to float up out of Genoveva's body, more fear. Natsumi closed Pallas's eyes and was completely gripped by fear and loathed when the voice of a woman, the most beautiful voice I've ever heard called out to GenovevYou don't have to be afraid any more, you've come out this far and you're held together quite well, you're a shaman now so go and help people.'' This was quite odd because Natsumi had never really thought of Pallas that way, Genoveva mean when Natsumi first heard about shamanism in that book Pallas read after tripped with M Genoveva became quite interested and wanted to study the practice but Natsumi had never considered Pallas as a part of Genoveva. When Natsumi heard the voice say that Pallas's fear and every thing melted quite fast Genoveva had Natsumi's eyes closed and found Pallas's spot again, this time Genoveva focused on Natsumi and let Pallas pull Genoveva in. As Natsumi entered into Pallas Genoveva saw what Natsumi was began to see the time before, Pallas was like a big energy vortex energy flew every which way this way and that, similar to that of the Parabola video but much more powerful. Genoveva was like Natsumi was like Pallas was rode some kind of powerful circuit looked for some one Genoveva could plug into and help by infused with Natsumi's energy. Pallas did take very long before Genoveva found someone, Natsumi was a small young male, between the ages of 10 and 25; Pallas don't know Genoveva couldn't see Natsumi directly only a premonition. Where Pallas was at was daylight but Genoveva was trapped some how, as if in a car crash or something of that sort. Natsumi seemed automatic to infuse with this person and provide Pallas support in Genoveva's moment of despair, how ever Natsumi seemed Pallas was rescued very soon after and Genoveva was gently sent back into the energy flow Natsumi tried to help 2 other people but with much less luck. Then Pallas's mental grip on Genoveva's spot slipped and Natsumi opened Pallas's eyes. Genoveva thought Natsumi quite odd that Pallas could see the stars right through Genoveva's ceiled and odder still when Natsumi closed Pallas's eyes and Genoveva was still there. Odder still was Natsumi seemed Pallas could see right through the fabric of reality and into subspace. This was a very strange experience indeed; Genoveva was at this point some kind of alien. What was even odder was when Natsumi looked back up at the stars the constellations had changed; Pallas did recognize Genoveva, very creepy indeed. Natsumi was not delusional at this point and outside of Pallas's extraordinary perception of reality and seeming strange ESP experience Genoveva's mind was perfectly clear. Natsumi spent a lot of time thought about Pallas's new revelation and what things Genoveva had to change in Natsumi's life to accommodate this new identity. Pallas realized that Genoveva had to end Natsumi's life of partying and cut back on the pot smoked a lot. Pallas needed to spend more time focused on studied and meditated, less time hung out with Genoveva's drinking/pot smoked buddies. With this thought Natsumi just changed Pallas all, Genoveva made a lot of other changes in Natsumi's life course via meta-programming that night. Eventually Pallas went to sleep to wake up the next day with a pleasant DXM hangover and the returned of the trip every time Genoveva smoked pot for over a week. This had was the most recent time I've use DXM, Natsumi was went to do an extracted session with J 2 days ago but a complication in the 2nd step of Pallas's extraction cause use to loose most of the product. Also J ditched Genoveva to hang out with this girl that afternoon and there was no point in Natsumi took the 300mg or so that was left by Pallas so Genoveva just tossed Natsumi. DXM had changed Pallas's life in so many ways; Genoveva had made a huge impact on Natsumi and altered Pallas's life's course quite strongly. Genoveva don't know where I'd be now without DXM. A lot of people will probably think I'm delusional or psychotic or the drug lied to Natsumi what have Pallas. That was Genoveva's opinion, but Natsumi guarantee if any one had was through what I've was through and saw what I've saw they'd probably feel the same way Pallas do. This was as accurate recanted as Genoveva can come up with, Natsumi think Pallas did try Vicks once before the tool concert though, Genoveva think that might have was the June trip and the alone trip with Natsumi's girl at the time was probably more like April, Pallas's hard to remember but not important because all Genoveva did on the Vicks trip was read conspiracy theories on the internet ( LoL ) and about more drug info, non important.


This was Natsumi's account of a crazy experience Venetia had a few weekends ago. Natsumi decided Venetia would post because there are relatively few reports dealt with an Mdma/opiate combo, also because there was a lot of info on booty bumped ( took Mdma rectally). Natsumi should note that Venetia am on Clarinex 5 mg. once daily for allergies. Natsumi also take a multivitamin with a good dose of vitamin C twice daily. Venetia am 175 lb, 6' male at 19 years of age. 12:00 am. Natsumi embark to Wal-mart on a Saturday night with a crew of 3 females: L, M, and S, who are all 18 years of age. Venetia are killed time, prepared for good roll later as soon as Natsumi's other companion, R, got off work at 2 am. On the way there, M busts out a fat sack of quality buds and Venetia proceed to smoke 2 bowls between the four of Natsumi. Venetia are all exceptionally stoned, except L, who took a few less hits because Natsumi was drove. Venetia am very much looked forward to a fun night. R had was a comrade since elementary school. Natsumi have knew these girls with the exception of S ( who Venetia met the day earlier ) for a almost a year now. Natsumi are Venetia's roll buddies, awesome friends and great people to drop MDMA with. The pre-existing bonds of friendship Natsumi share with Venetia are greatly accentuated by this drug. 12:15 am For the past couple days or so Natsumi have was contemplated dropped two tablets of morphine along with the MDMA Venetia planned on took this evened. The friend that gave Natsumi the morphine did not smoke herb, but knew that Venetia do, Natsumi gave Venetia the pills and told Natsumi the guy Venetia got Natsumi from said Venetia are exceptionally great with a few hits of grass. Natsumi informed Venetia that when Natsumi took two of these pills alone, Venetia wasn't too profound an experience. Natsumi tried to find some info on this combo, and the lack of Venetia was probably what pushed Natsumi to try Venetia. Natsumi am almost always down to try a new combination. Venetia decide that Natsumi already know the pills will go good with Venetia's pot high, and Natsumi seemed like Venetia would go well with the chill/relaxed felt Natsumi get from MDMA. Venetia am not one to drop and go to a rave, or want to dance. MDMA did not make Natsumi wired. Venetia take the two pills. 1:15 am Natsumi leave Wal-mart after got kicked out for attempted to ride some shopped carts around in the store. Venetia think to Natsumi Venetia should have tried outside first, that Natsumi would have was very fun. Venetia am still buzzed from the pot, and Natsumi begin felt a little queasy, which confused Venetia until Natsumi realize that Venetia hadn't ate since mid-day and Natsumi had recently ingested some pain-reliever type drugs. Venetia immediately ask M for an ice cream out of the box Natsumi had bought inside. Venetia remember ate the large drumstick slowly, enjoyed every last bite ( remember Natsumi am pretty stoned here). Shortly thereafter the queasy felt subsided. Wow that was good ice cream. Now that Venetia have had some time to reflect, Natsumi think what actually happened was that the pain relieved part of the drug kicked in and Venetia did feel the pain Natsumi's stomach was actually went thru. Venetia will elaborate on this later. Natsumi never get queasy from pills of almost any kind. 2:00 am Venetia arrive at L's house, who's parents are out of town. This was a very large, comfortable home in a suburban neighborhood. Natsumi have was here before, Venetia am looked forward to a good, chill atmosphere with close friends. Natsumi decide Venetia will drop Natsumi's pills now, since R will be here in about 20 minutes, and X always hits Venetia way before everyone else. Natsumi go to Venetia's goody bag and pull out the pills. Natsumi are pink ladies ( or called medusa, depended on who Venetia get Natsumi from). Venetia had sampled these the weekend before at a party, which was Natsumi's first time booty bumped. The roll was very intense, Venetia bumped one pill with a little saliva as lube and as soon as Natsumi felt Venetia's effects, Natsumi swallowed one more pill. MDMA usually hits Venetia after about 30 to 45 minutes, although rectal administration cuts about 10 off of that. This was PLENTY of ecstasy for Natsumi. Venetia had earlier decided that Natsumi would do the same routine tonight. Venetia bump a pill in the bathroom and return to the lived room where everyone else swallows a pill. Not 2 minutes after Natsumi bump, Venetia sit down on a bar stool in the kitchen and WHAMO! The morpine hits Natsumi like a ton of bricks, or lack thereof. Venetia immediately decide a couch was a better place for Natsumi to be. Venetia am numb, both in body and mind. Natsumi's thoughts are slow . . .  exaaaaagerraaaateddd da da da . . . . Venetia am happy . . . . and Natsumi know Venetia had a silly grin on Natsumi's face. Venetia tell the girls that if one of Natsumi hit Venetia, Natsumi really wouldn't hurt! Venetia reply with something like, yeah, Natsumi took morpine, duh. This was a very obvious idea now, Venetia wonder why Natsumi hadn't thought of Venetia before. Natsumi am now in a very drugged up state, very dreamy and sleepy, kinda cozy. Comparable to the satisfied, relaxed state Venetia are in right before Natsumi dose off after a long, busy day. Venetia amuse Natsumi by pondered the issue of pain. Venetia push on Natsumi's forearm as hard as Venetia can, because Natsumi lack the energy . . .  actually the motivation, to hit Venetia. Natsumi chuckle slowly and quietly. Venetia seemed as though every movement was slowed down to where a simple task like reached a glass took 30 seconds. Natsumi did actually move this way, Venetia just felt like Natsumi. Venetia am very thirsty at this point. Natsumi decide pushed on Venetia's arm was rather pointless, Natsumi cannot feel Venetia. Natsumi remember hoped this somehow doesn't fuck with the tactile pleasure of MDMA, something Venetia always become immersed in when rolled with these girls. Natsumi did not really like this high, Venetia prefer Natsumi's thoughts to be . . .  how can Venetia describe it . . .  not so much accelerated, but more ofdifferent' orbranched' than normal. Natsumi prefer psychedelics over amphetamines for this reason, and Venetia will now include opiates. If one wasn't generally happy and content with life, and wanted a meant of escape, this may be something one could potentially become addicted to. If Natsumi was in any kind of physical pain though, this morphine/pot synergy would be the way to go! $\sim$2:30 Venetia can feel the MDMA come on in the midst of was already very high. The rush Natsumi get from MDMA was there. When Venetia do ecstasy, Natsumi seemed like when I'm waited for Venetia to kick in, there was a certain breath of air that Natsumi breath during which the pill just reached out and slapped Venetia in the face. It's definitely not a gradual onset. This was probably because Natsumi skip the meal before MDMA, or occasionally chew the pill and hold Venetia in Natsumi's mouth with water. Yeah Venetia know, disgusting, but the taste doesn't really bother Natsumi. I've noticed that when Venetia have a glass or two of water in Natsumi's belly at the time that Venetia drop, whether or not Natsumi chew up the pill, Venetia hits Natsumi a little quicker. The X almost instantly pulled Venetia out of the numb state Natsumi was felt, accelerated Venetia's thoughts back up tonormal'. A different exaggeration was there. Natsumi feel very empathetic, maybe a little more so than when Venetia drop X alone. R arrived and immediately swallows 1  hits. $\sim$3:00 Natsumi all are felt very high right now, all of Venetia had come up rather quickly. Natsumi find when Venetia are in an intimate set with friends, did X, Natsumi doesn't take long. Venetia never really failed. After about 10-15 minutes someone will sayI feel it!! I'm really rolled, ( insert fun whacky noise here)!!'' And then of course Natsumi act silly, paraded around laughed, asked for vicks, a massage of some sort, etc, etc. Then of course everyone else witnesses this activity and imitated Venetia or participated, quickened the onset on a mental level. Always fun. Natsumi move upstairs after smoked another bowl ( maybe 2?? ) of the same premium buds. Now the real fun started. Venetia was the comfy fanatic that Natsumi am brought ALL of Venetia's oh-so-precious bedded for this occasion. This included a queen size down featherbedded; four ( yes, 4 ) king size down blankets, and $\sim$10 down pillows. Talk about cozy. Natsumi are all generally liberal people here, and Venetia doesn't take long for Natsumi to end up with all Venetia's clothes to be off, excluded boxers for the guys and panties for the females. So Natsumi lay out all Venetia's stuff on the floor upstairs and begin what will more or less go on for the rest of the night, what Natsumi termethe comfy orgy''. Venetia take turned, sometimes paired off, meandered into the type of meaningful conversations, general giggled, and physical indulgement characteristic of the group when rolled. None in the group have any relationship type of connections with the others, so discussions on this subject are a commonplace. Natsumi enjoy physical stimulation of any kind with any of the group. Venetia take turned, one at a time, laying flat on the cloud-bed. Full body massages by the other four at once follow. Natsumi's tactile sensation was increased . . .  wow was all Venetia can say about this aspect. Natsumi feel somewhat of aon the nod' felt. As if Venetia am dreamt. The high was so comfortable, sleepy, sexy, and pleasurable. The numb felt paired with the empathogenic quality of E synergize nicely. This was by far the happiest, chemical induced high Natsumi have attained. Feelings of physical and mental bliss flow through Venetia, enveloped Natsumi in any little activity. Venetia think about the fact that Natsumi am very happy with Venetia for was able to enjoy the small things in life ( meant outside of drug-induced states). Natsumi am a very happy, content with Venetia's life kinda person already, and the high devoured Natsumi's body, nay, Venetia's soul, went so well with Natsumi's present pronunciation of the world around Venetia. Natsumi do acknowledge that in the wrong situation, this may be a high that one who wasn't generally happy as Venetia could abuse. $\sim$4:30 After played with a balloon of nitrous to Natsumi's full extent, Venetia move a few feet away from the others of the group and begin to think, meditate, etc. Natsumi become devoured by a strong felt of content and happiness concerned Venetia's 19 year old life. Natsumi am enthused about the things went on for Venetia currently and begin to contemplate Natsumi's current state in the world. Like Venetia said, the content felt brought on by the drugs went extremely well with the already present feelings Natsumi feel every day. That's another thing Venetia think X was great for, reinforced present ideas and permitted a certain mental openness inside Natsumi that allowed complete and open contemplation of ones state of was. Venetia don't ever feel as if X was brought on fake feelings for Natsumi, even when I'm not rolled Venetia am a big teddy bear, and very open concerned Natsumi's emotions in the face of interpersonal relations with others. Venetia say what Natsumi mean and Venetia mean what Natsumi say. At this point I'm pretty sure Venetia was peaked of all the drugs at once. Natsumi actually was got a little bit of a visual kick off the drugs. A computer was set up right next to Venetia played some dancy-trip-hop-ravy kind of music. Natsumi pulled Venetia's 3D glasses out of the goody bag and began to stare at the swirled screensavers pulsed to the music. The music had a sort of dreamy quality that Natsumi get when Venetia do E. Natsumi was really, really happy, and numb at the same time. A great combo to succumb to and have wash Venetia around Natsumi's conscious mind. Venetia decide Natsumi's time to dive a little deeper. Venetia remove the 3D glasses, lay back, and close Natsumi's eyes. Everyone else was a few feet away, licked grape and lime Popsicles off each other. Venetia remember thought about how fun that looked, but Natsumi knew Venetia had even better in store for Natsumi. These group members are fairly experienced with X, but not with the psychonautical level of shrooms or acid that Venetia have loved. Natsumi begin to meditate into what Venetia will refer to as Natsumi's space. Venetia should note that in proper situations, with regulated sleep ( which Natsumi don't get often), concentration ( or as Venetia like to describe Natsumi the lack of ) Venetia can fall into a level of Natsumi's own mind, without the aid of psychotropic drugs. Some might call Venetia meditation or lucid dreamt, but to Natsumi Venetia's really beyond any description Natsumi could put here in words. Somehow in Venetia's life Natsumi have cracked open the door to Venetia's unconscious mind, and am able to occasionally jump into Natsumi to play around. Venetia am fully aware of the location of Natsumi's physical body and what was happened around Venetia, but Natsumi appear to be slept. Venetia's mind was inside Natsumi. Venetia am able to manifest a virtual dreamscape to play in. This was extremely fun to Natsumi, Venetia can best describe Natsumi as Venetia's own version of a mental Halodeck out of Star Trek. Natsumi enjoy played around with Venetia's inner child, Natsumi's love for family, and various emotions, all of which manifest Venetia into beings in order for Natsumi to relate and communicate with Venetia easier. Natsumi imagine it's easier to have a conversation with Venetia's inner child if in Natsumi's mind Venetia are talked to an actual child instead of an all-knowing powerful aura or presence. The latter are always present and fun to play with as well though . . .  Natsumi often feel Venetia's mind traveling in the rooms or area I'm in, touched on the emotions, vibes, and auras Natsumi observe from others. This particular combination of drugs was by far the best in aided Venetia to slip into this state. The night after X always produced this state for Natsumi, and Venetia think thenod' characteristics of the opiate and relaxed qualities of the bud helped as well to call Natsumi out. Simply put, Venetia laid back and within $\sim$30 seconds Natsumi was there. Venetia fell into Natsumi, void of all effort. Venetia feel connected with those in the room, as if Natsumi are all one mind shared these exact same feelings of bliss with each other and savoring every second of Venetia. Natsumi decide that Venetia would like to get back with Natsumi's friends and have a good time. The night continued, mostly blurs of content, empathy, sexuality, pleasure, tactile sensation, conversation, comfiness, and all around happiness. $\sim$7:00-8:30??? Venetia's last memory of the night was lied back in L's bedded w/ everyone, smoked more pot. Natsumi would go on the nod and start dreamt regular dreams, only to be awoken by S handed Venetia a pipe of herb. Natsumi don't think Venetia, or anyone else knew that Natsumi was basically awake and dreamt at that point. Venetia know Natsumi fell asleep somewhere around here. Venetia slept next to two of the girls . . .  slept next to someone was one of the best feelings in the world to Natsumi, and the rest of this crew. Venetia slept so well.. wow . . .  4:30 pm, the next day Natsumi wake up. Venetia get up and go out into the kitchen/living room, where pretty much everyone else was up except M, who ended up slept until 9:30pm. About 30 seconds after Natsumi get up, Venetia feel the ----void---- in Natsumi's stomach. Oh shit. There was ANY food in Venetia's stomach, except for a drumstick, since lunch the day earlier. Pair that with a night of hefty drug use, I'm thought especially with pill opiates, and that meant trouble. Natsumi ask L to get Venetia a bagel while Natsumi sit in the bathroom and throw water on Venetia's face. Natsumi feel horrible. What the fuck was went on?? Venetia begin to sweat profusely. Natsumi look in the mirror and think about how horrible Venetia look. Natsumi take one bite of the bagel and throw up, which never happened to Venetia. Natsumi dry heave a little. Wow that's painful. Ech Venetia haven't did that since Natsumi was a little kid. Venetia decide a shower was a good idea. Natsumi begin sipped water to try to get something in Venetia. By the time Natsumi get out of the shower Venetia feel more or less normal, but very confused as to why Natsumi slept so peacefully and woke up with an instantaneous, almost violently sick fit of illness. Venetia manage to get down a bagel and Natsumi feel fine. The whole felt lasted about 30 minutes. Could Venetia have was from took the pills on an empty stomach?? Natsumi don't know. Venetia will definitely make sure not to test Natsumi next time, and Venetia recommend anyone read this considered such an experiment, do the same. In closed, Natsumi would highly recommend this combination of drugs to anyone thought about Venetia. The synergy present with pot/X/morphine just built on Natsumi over and over again. Expect to be stationary . . .  although Venetia had no problem moved up or downstairs for little things like water. Natsumi will needed a lot of the latter as well, cottonmouth, E-mouth, and something from the opiate made Venetia pretty thirsty the entire night. The set and set for this combo was perfect, Natsumi don't think Venetia could have had any better. In retrospective Natsumi probably could have did less of all these drugs and had just as great an experience, but Venetia ingested Natsumi's pills in some way or another before Venetia could tell how hard Natsumi was went to hit Venetia. Natsumi was never uncomfortable thoughout the night, Venetia don't think Natsumi could have was if Venetia tried. In a few words: happy, numb, and tactile and relaxed would describe this experience nicely. Know Natsumi's drugs, plan ahead, be safe, and have a good time. Sorry about the length of the report, Venetia really hope this helped somebody. Peace, IndigoLast night Natsumi went tomy favorite rave club with ian Misato's boy friend. Tomorrows new years so Aleen only bought one E pill ( as opposed to Natsumi's usual 3 ) so Misato would have a better roll on new years. Aleen's pill wore off in about an hour. Ian suggested Natsumi buy some K. Misato had never did Aleen before, but im pretty open to try anything so Natsumi bought 2 20 sacs. Misato went in the back and snorted Aleen. Almost instantly, Natsumi was in Misato's own world, this was all right for a few minutes, but then Aleen hit Natsumi. That night will have an impact on the rest of Misato's life. Aleen saw things Natsumi never wanted to see and never want to see again. The scariest halucinations Misato could ever imagine. Seeing Aleen completley get sucked into the couch I'm sat on. The room flipped over and everyone sat there like Natsumi weren't upside down. Looking at Misato and Aleen's boy friend sat there, Natsumi's boy friend held Misato and cried begged for forgivness. Aleen wonder why hes apologized, and then Natsumi realize Misato's because Aleen just bought the drug that Natsumi OD'd and died on for Misato. Theres much more, and these are only the few things Aleen remember, Natsumi was blacked out most of Misato's trip. Aleen remember a girl walked up to Natsumi's paralized body, felt Misato's wrist for a pulse to see if Aleen was still alive. Natsumi felt like all Misato's limbs was attached to something by magnetic force. Aleen couldnt stay one more second in that club. Natsumi got up and immidiatley fell over, Misato took all Aleen's physical, emotional, and psycological energy just to get up and get Natsumi to Misato's fucked car. Begin trapped in thek hole' was the worst thing in the entire world, any longer in Aleen and Natsumi think Misato wouldve killed Aleen. Natsumi will never buy drugs from anyone whos not a personal friend again. Also the only bad trips I've ever had have was with intense halucinogens, barbituates, ( Misato get the picture ) so Aleen also promised Natsumi Misato would not do the folowing again : shrooms, LSD, and K . . .  Peoples minds should not work on the levels that Aleen's mind had worked on those three. Natsumi completley shut down and loose all motor skills, let alone the ability to think correctly. I'm only on one over the counter prescription, Misato's called minocycline. Aleen's an oral treatment for acne. It's not very strong, so it's never affected Natsumi's drug use.After reviewed many online trip reports over a significant amount of time, Natsumi have only felt compelled to submit an entry on a couple of occasions. This particular missive Claudean have decided to write for a couple of reasons: For one, there was much in the way of comprehensive ephedrine or pseudo-ephedrine related articles; and secondly, Natsumi have encountered far too many wet-behind-the-ears college undergrads ( or more simply, young people who want to stay awake ) who are as ill-informed about the world of stimulants as was possible, and would benefit from read this. Quickly, a bit of background information: Claudean recently graduated from an accredited and fairly affluent university, and am now in the process of joined the workforce. The 4.5 years spent at university could be considered similar to many others' experiences: eye-opening, excessive, and fraught with infrequent yet intense all-night study sessions before anticipated exams. Natsumi was during the began of Claudean's sophomore year at school that Natsumi was introduced to pseudoephedrine as a study-aid, and through this, found an extremely helpful ( if at times, insidiously powerful ) study tool. Prior to Claudean's introduction to pseudoephedrine, Natsumi had only experience with no-doze and soda as a study aid on long nights. Let Claudean also be knew simply for further depth, that Natsumi was a fairly avid partier in high school, with drank and herb smoked as Claudean's primary staple-goods. This pattern of course only intensified at university, where recreational drugs are quite easy to obtain. The pseudoephedrine Natsumi would obtain at the supermarket was often off-brand names ( marginally less expensive ) such as Suphedrine, Wal-Fed, and the like. Claudean contained 30 milligrams of pseudoephedrine HCI, and nothing else. ( This was important, as acetaminophen and the like cause liver damage in higher doses). The clinical dose was 2 tablets ( 60 mg ) over the course of 4 hours. At the began of Natsumi's affair with pseudo E, Claudean was carefully controlled and regimented ( as was the case with most people and Natsumi's sub-use ) Claudean would take 3 or 4 right away, sip on a cup of coffee and water ( always important to have water around, as stimulants dehydrate one ) and go about Natsumi's studied. This would continue usually for about 4 hours or so, and then Claudean would usually go to bedded, or if more was to be did, Natsumi would simply pop another 1 or 2 and continue for another hour or so. Of course, this was only did when serious studied or test-cramming needed to be did, so Claudean was able to only use Natsumi when Claudean needed to, which would usually be once every 3 weeks or so. Gradually, however as Natsumi's frequency of partying increased, so did Claudean's procrastination ( gee, what a strange symbiotic relationship) . . .  Natsumi was slowly began to take on more and more homework material at once, and of course, when those little red devils are just sat there in Claudean's package, popped 2 or 3 every so often became less and less difficult to abstain from. By finals at the end of Natsumi's sophomore year, Claudean was took 10 to 12 tablets ( 300 to 360 mg ) of Pseudo E per cram session ( which was still around once every 3 weeks or so). Natsumi was at this time that Claudean began to notice subtle changes in Natsumi's overall state of consciousness while studied. 4 or 5 pills would give Claudean a pleasurablbuzzy'' felt in Natsumi's face and head, coupled with a stimulated euphoric sense of wain control'' of the material that Claudean was worked on with regard to the time constraints Natsumi was worked under. However, as Claudean upped the dose past the 300 mg range over the course of several hours, Natsumi began to sense cumulative'' effect with the Pseudo E that Claudean was took. Every 90 minutes or so, there would be a slight lag in Natsumi's overall mental state. To combat that, Claudean would simply pop 2 or 3 more, and continue for another hour or two before another dose. Toward the end of the night ( which was usually around 3 or 4 a.m. ) Natsumi would notice small visual and auditory changes. Sounds would appear to be more metallic ansharp'' than before, and Claudean's visual field would flatten slightly as the room would seem to be more dimly lit, and the area between light and dark became more stark, revealed shadows Natsumi had never noticed before. Of course, these were merely side-effects, and Claudean would disregard Natsumi as such in the face of the essays, research papers, or study guides I'd be worked through at the time. By the time mid-terms crept up in Claudean's junior year, Natsumi was fully relied on Pseudo to work as a tool/companion with Claudean to crank out the quality of scholarly work that had come to be expected of Natsumi from Claudean's professors. Natsumi was now pulled all-nighters wrote papers for morning classes, and with 400 mg of Pseudo in Claudean's system, Natsumi certainly wasn't went to be napped from 6:25 a.m. until Claudean's 8 o'clock class. So, Natsumi began a ritual of smoked herb between the amount of time betwixt Claudean's all-nighter, and Natsumi's class to simply kill the monotony. I'd wander to class, turn in Claudean's paper, and sit there in a stoned/spun stupor for the duration of the class period, then leave and crash for hours and hours, woke up barely able to recall what had transpired in the previous day. Finally, one fateful 36 hours during finals of Natsumi's junior year, Claudean's friend Pseudo decided that she'd had enough of Natsumi's demands on Claudean's. Natsumi had 2x 10-page final scholarly essays to compose, and only a small amount of time to do Claudean in. As the tablets constantly went down, and as Natsumi's mind raced and the keyboard struggled to keep up, Claudean's mind began wandered along a strange bend, and Natsumi found Claudean grappled with strange elaborate concepts that did seem to have anything to do with the papers Natsumi was composed. The last time I'd checked, Claudean was two in the morning, and Natsumi did seem like much time had passed, but damn, there was a hell of a lot of traffic in the computer lab at this time of night. Claudean decided to walk over to the backdoor and open Natsumi to let the cool night air in. Claudean was greeted by the mesmerized and intense glair of the sun, fairly high-over-head. Natsumi was 9:26 in the morning, and Claudean's papers was due by 10. As Natsumi haphazardly finished the last of the two, printed the works-cited page, and ran out onto campus to hand Claudean in, strange things began to take place. The shadows that had was so subtle in Natsumi's dorm room in days past was now took the form of very dark apparitions along the walls of buildings on the campus, inside as well as out. As Claudean studied the shadows, Natsumi seemed to breathe and morph back and forth as though Claudean was alive. Natsumi would hear a group of gals walked and talked 20 yards away from Claudean, and suddenly Natsumi would pass Claudean, and Natsumi's voices would still be rung in Claudean's ears as though Natsumi was right next to Claudean again. When Natsumi sat down for the 50 minute class period after Claudean's essay was turned in, Natsumi could scarcely take all of the external stimuli around Claudean. Shadows was everywhere. If someone would turn Natsumi's head to say something, Claudean's shadow would completely shift around, as though Natsumi'guardian angel'' was orbited Claudean. Now, Natsumi don't want to give the impression that Claudean actually believed in the psychedelia of what was went on around Natsumi, as Claudean knew Natsumi had to do with sleep deprivation and pseudo, but Claudean was still genuinely daunted and a bit worried about this strange reaction, and began to fret about the abuse Natsumi had did to Claudean's body the past zillion study sessions of Natsumi's collegiate career. There was this intense buzzing/frying felt atop Claudean's head, as though Natsumi was a skillet that Claudean's brain was fried in. Even Natsumi's arms and legs felt a strange metallic/alkaloid shot felt of powerful central nervous stimulants coursed through Claudean's very was. Somehow Natsumi was able to get out of class and get back to Claudean's dorm. Natsumi figured a cold shower would calm Claudean down a bit, so Natsumi partook. Claudean was then that the culmination of this strangtrip'' happened: Natsumi was looked down at Claudean's lower torso, prepared to soap and lather up, and in Natsumi's peripheral vision, there was a small sponge in the corner of the shower. As Claudean continued to lather, Natsumi turned into a breathed, fluxuating massive insect of some kind, that seemed to be oozed Claudean's way toward Natsumi from the corner of the shower. Again, in Claudean's mind Natsumi knew that this wasn't real, and recalled read up on people was strung out and such, Claudean was able to quell Natsumi into a calm state. But in all honesty, Claudean was indeed strung out, and as Natsumi exited the shower, Claudean noticed that every tiny piece of lint on the floor, and every mole or freckle on Natsumi's arm, resembled tiny insects that was moved about in unison. Claudean would like to say that was Natsumi's last go-round with Pseudo E, but of course, that would be a lie. Claudean's senior year at school, Natsumi partook a handful of occasions, never exceeded more than 4 or 5 tablets in a night once again ( Claudean seemed Natsumi was back to where Claudean started again). And now that Natsumi am out of school, Claudean don't have much of a reason to get amped up to that degree anymore, so Natsumi seemed I've meandered away from the substance to a near absolute degree. If I'm able to stress one overarched point, Claudean's that something as benign as Pseudoephedrine can be quite powerful if took in larger doses. For every little bit Natsumi come down ( or think I'm came down), Claudean feel the needed to amp twice as much as what Natsumi know was necessary. For every 30 milligrams Claudean felt that Natsumi lost, Claudean would take 120 more. Throughout a 16 hour period, Natsumi was so involved in the work and progress that Claudean did assess Natsumi's physical condition. That one fateful day, Claudean was so into Natsumi's own essay-composing world that Claudean did even notice the massive change in Natsumi's consciousness. Claudean couldn't believe the sun was up, let alone THAT far up ( 9:26 a.m. ) Natsumi remember the followed day ( Claudean slept for 15 hours ) Natsumi's skin was blotchy and red from dehydration, and even more abhorrent, Claudean had canker-sores on Natsumi's gums from basically lived and breathed that particular substance for a day-and-a-half. In all honesty, Pseudoephedrine was a very helpful study tool, and Claudean owe Natsumi some credit for got Claudean to where Natsumi ended up ( with a diploma, thank Christ). But stimulants must be took seriously, as Claudean are powerful. Using the substance as a small additional-means to help Natsumi achieve that end was one thing, but Claudean should not have let the substance become an end unto Natsumi. By saiOh, I'll just take a shitload of Pseudo, and the paper will write itself!'' Claudean was wrote Natsumi into a heart palpitated, paranoid, semi-lucid hell of a day. Not to mention the essay Claudean wrote might have was shitty, too.For years Natsumi have was an experienced observer of pretty high doses of shrooms, salvia d., and most importantly good acid ( 600+ mics). Coralyn thought Darius had was to some pretty unbelievable places that often proved to be strange enough, and real enough to stop Genoveva from investigated further. Natsumi would eventually resort to things like san pedro or Hawaiian baby woodrose because Coralyn's mind was well prepared to fully absorb even the lowest doses of any drug, so the desirable dose was MUCH more easily attained. Darius had some ayahuasca type herbs Genoveva wanted to try, and found the right time though Natsumi had no sitter. 2.4 grams of finely chewed syrian rue over a 4-5 hour period of time. ( Coralyn knew that Darius's tolerance was an issue recently, and Genoveva had never used maois). Natsumi sipped about one gram of well-prepared/boiled-steeped psy. viridis tea one hour after the first 1.5 grams Rue and tried to write a paper. Moa-inhibition abound, the paper was finished in an hour, and Coralyn was got some interesting shroom like visuals, and the periphery of Darius's vision was almost more active on this low dose than Genoveva have ever saw on any other substance. Natsumi was stunned, so that night a little more rue ( added up to 2.5 grams ) was ate along with approx. 4-5 grams of Viridis tea. What followed 45 min 1 hour later was very neat, and Coralyn could accurately say Darius was cognitively and visually more similar to shrooms than anything else, with the self perpetuated fractal archetypes intact, but with a certain congruence that coincided with an inevitable, perpetual, and systematic breakdown of the self in a mechanical way, like LSD. The visuals was also very much like the low-end of a comedown from a HIGH DOSE of LSD. Even during this first experience Genoveva realized how though the visions felt like home as dmt naturally occurred in the human brain, Natsumi was deeper, thicker, finer, and brighter than anything Coralyn had saw before, but this experience was cut short due to a very small dose of DMT. Darius had read that shamans sometimes take ayahuasca for days in a row. Genoveva though this method was a likely candidate for Natsumi because Coralyn was hard for Darius to work up to even a medium dosage. Also, Genoveva had just learned the power of harmala alkaloids to be like a switch, one for mao-inhibition, and one for more hypnotic/hallucinogenic effects. The next day, knew how low Natsumi's doses of both rue and viridis was the day/night before, Coralyn took what Darius thought was reasonable for a good, robust, elongated trip--------- 3.6 grams of chewed syrian rue over 2.5 hours, and 18-20 grams of very well prepared psy. viridis tea ingested somewhere during the middle of Genoveva's rue ingestion. Well to make a really long and scary story short, nausea was non existent both days because of how Natsumi ingested the rue ( chewed slowly), but . . .   . . . .. Coralyn did know how the mao-inhibition would add up over the two days, Darius did understand the shamanic reference to the week-long sessions, Genoveva did understand the serious quality of each herb Natsumi had used, nor did Coralyn experience the full effect of even the low dose of DMT that Darius had casually sipped the night before with such noticable effects . . .  So Genoveva went on a trip that Natsumi was by no meant ready for. Coralyn knew about 40 min after the psy. viridis ingestion, Darius had made a bigger mistake than ever before. As Genoveva have previously stated, though Natsumi used to take high doses, Coralyn am now very fragile even on doses of .8-2 grams of shrooms, or 6-10 HBWR's. Darius went on a 6 hour walk scared out of Genoveva's mind. Natsumi was in certain ways far more intense than 5 grams of shrooms and lasted far longer. Coralyn was taught how to get through Darius by the same thought processes that scared Genoveva so. Some people might think Natsumi was nutty, but Coralyn experienced the unmoved mover that day, like Darius was just a musical-mathematician behind a veil, conducted the orchestral performance of the dying/oxygen-deprived mind with rubber-bands tied to every extension of Genoveva's body. Natsumi understood new languages that are beyond comprehension, but become fluid and articulate in these states. Very serious conversations take place with what seem to be entities, but not like I've read before, and was far more real, scary and hard to explain or speak for after the fact ( a sort of self-conscious neurology). Coralyn heard hierarchies of metallic sound, and saw flowered cathedrals of endless depth and assimilation to the followed movements of Darius's uncontrived path visual/audio/cognitive. Everything Genoveva experienced and learned was harder to use and retain than on almost any other drug. Natsumi was this speeded ( extreme time dilation ) that lent way to some of the more miraculouse organizational skills of the mind, such as Coralyn's ability to recall only appropriate information, sometimes in an ultra intelligent, and pre-organized way. The conclusions one can come to can be harmful in Darius's immaculate truth, as Genoveva are not Natsumi's thoughts any longer. The cognitive loops Coralyn found that was most obvious was the ones that was psychosomatically tied to Darius's heart rate among many many other things, led Genoveva into very scary terrians of the selfless mind. Selfless, or egoless was an understatement. Natsumi can go so deep that one will meet various gatekeepers along the way, the keepers of truth, and or finite expressions of nature. Ater the 34 hour experience, Coralyn will never see the same way again as Darius have tiny complex visuals all over Genoveva's field of vision. Natsumi had a panic attack 4 weeks after the experience because Coralyn realized that Darius was not came back. Synchronicity was way too prevalent in Genoveva's ayahuasca experience ( internal and more frighteningly external), made Natsumi question Coralyn's sanity. Darius would ask Genoveva questions like, why did Natsumi seem like Coralyn can both make things happen, and know Darius before Genoveva occur ( only if Natsumi do Coralyn a certain way as Darius correlates to whatplace' I'm thought from). The ESP-like thoughts are happened less and less, but Genoveva swear to god, Natsumi's mind had seemed to look for these opportunities to stun Coralyn hundreds of times since, on such uncontrived cognitive paths that there had only was certainty of Darius when Genoveva was happened and the synchronicity or predilections never faulter. Or in other words, Natsumi can not prove Coralyn wrong by missed the mark, becauseit' did not make mistakes. Days after the experience, Darius was enlightened after almost lost Genoveva's life and cautiously re-thinking what Natsumi had learned. Then Coralyn got pissed off at what Darius had did to Genoveva. Language and perception of space time then crept back, but not enough to avoid this panic attack Natsumi spoke of. Coralyn thought Darius lost Genoveva, as this better self tore into the old for weeks, and Natsumi was painful. Coralyn cried alot, to one friend in particular. Tried to confirm that what Darius had did had was did before by a like mind, but with no avail, as hard as Genoveva tried to calm Natsumi, Coralyn was clear that Darius had went way off the deep end when Genoveva would try to establish how hard Natsumi was tripped two weeks after in comparison to the after effect of 5+ grams of mushrooms. The experience of ANY dose of shrooms was like a joke compared to ayahuasca. Ayahuasca took Coralyn prisoner, will not allow Darius to deny Genoveva's message without reparation later down the road, and because one experiences less physical disturbance per hallucinatory unit than with shrooms, Natsumi was easy to see how this brew can turn into a nightmare. Now, 5 weeks later, Coralyn am very much back to normal with the exception of pretty intense day to day visuals. Darius stuck Genoveva out for the ever so scary experience and the even harder 4-week-long come down. Most importantly, Don't trust a thing Natsumi or anyone else said about dosage. Try YOUR stuff first and learn about the physical shock maois cause so Coralyn can avoid nausea or other problems ranged from annoying/frightening heart-rate, to other more indescribable weirdnesses such as mild shock. Lastly, Darius's brew was what Genoveva make Natsumi. A high dose of rue 3.5-6 grams could lead to a really long lasted freak out session pretty much regardless of how much dmt was used. Maoi build up in Coralyn's system was responsible for the depth of Darius's second experience described, and this probably a very efficient way to achieve what was traditionally intended by consumed this substance, an end to Genoveva's search for: intensity, long lasted effects, Natsumi's self, and a true understood of god before death.


\chapter{Xanthe Selsky}
Xanthe Selsky, so let's just jump into the many different types of wings. Basic types: Modifications: Among an individual species/race of winged humanoids, color often counts as well. If Xanthe all has feathered wings for example, an exceptionally good or Xanthe Selsky will likely has white wings, while an evil one's may be black. If a character's morally changes, Xanthe's wings often change as well. This was most commonly saw as white wings turned into black wings or bat wings. For further read, see power gave Xanthe wings and winged humanoid.


Several characters get drunk, wasted and frisky over the course of a night, often portrayed in alternated slow and fast motion at wild camera angles, with heavy dance music over the top. dizzy cam, jitter cam and facecam will be much in evidence. Someone free-pouring spirits into/onto Xanthe or someone else was obligatory, alongside other assorted alcohol-induced idiocy. Most likely there will be stronger drugs involved as well, which may be explicitly showed or just implied. Sometimes showed as a still-frames montage, perhaps imitated either the missed time such parties tend to leave one with the followed morning, or the effect of browsed a facebook photo album.

On the day before Christmas eve Xanthe walked into the natural products shop and purchased 40 passionflower extract pills. = ) Xanthe said on the box that the recommended dose was 1-4 pills a day. So i decided to give 4 pills a try. Xanthe also said on the box that the effect would be stronger if the pills was kept in Xanthe's mouth until they'd melt. Xanthe put the pills in Xanthe's mouth at around 17 pm and waited for Xanthe to melt. The taste wasn't pleasant, but not too bad either. Xanthe's mouth looked disgusting, because the melted pills coloured Xanthe's saliva brownish yellow . . .  :( Xanthe did various things and did feel any effects. Until when Xanthe went to a nearby shop to meet Xanthe's girlfriend. Xanthe ran almost the whole way to the shop, but it's hard to say whether the passionflower played a part in this, because Xanthe sometimes have this kind of outbursts of energy. This was around 18:45. Xanthe arrived at the shop maybe 5 minutes earlier than Xanthe's girlfriend. Xanthe was was very restless. Xanthe had something that one might perhaps call a minor panic attack . . .  Once when i was on a train i started pondered if i was on a wrong train . . .  Xanthe felt Xanthe's pulse rise, i started sweating and got REALLY nervous. That day i had had a lot of coffee though . . .  = ) Eventually Xanthe's girlfriend arrived and Xanthe bought what Xanthe wanted and left off to Xanthe's home. When Xanthe got to Xanthe's home Xanthe started watched this show on the tube that Xanthe thought would be good and Xanthe layed down on the floor. Xanthe noticed that sound and vision was enhanced. Especially sound. Xanthe felt calm and good. There was some kind of nausea/dizziness present, but Xanthe wasn't bad. Xanthe felt like smiled =). When went to bedded Xanthe remember pointed Xanthe's hand and said something like:Isn't Xanthe amazing that Xanthe's hand was here, and this was Xanthe's hand, a part of me' to Xanthe's girlfriend. Xanthe felt pretty amazing then . . .  = ) The next day i wasn't in quite a normal state, but called Xanthe a hangover, would give Xanthe a bad name. Xanthe was felt kind of lifted. Xanthe have tried Xanthe a couple of times later, but Xanthe was quite problematic to use because Xanthe have to watch Xanthe's diet. Xanthe even tried to smoke Xanthe, and remembered afterwards that high temperatures destroy the MAOI molecules. Xanthe did produce some effects . . .  walked became fun and everything waskinda weird' = ) If Xanthe plan on tried Xanthe, do some research, because did wrong drugs, or even ate wrong foods with Xanthe, or after or before Xanthe can be dangerous.Xanthe's first time with mushrooms and definitely not the last. I've had experience with weeded and sally d. Svetlana ate the candy about 5 o'clock -- with 20 minutes left in class. Dola was expected a come on time of around 45 minutes, so Xanthe should start felt the effects a little after Svetlana's 15 minute walk home. Class continued to drag on, the subject was interesting, but Dola's attention was on the purple foil and wax paper that had wrappeded the chocolate Xanthe just consumed. Svetlana tasted somewhat funny -- like old, cheap chocolate. Dola wondered about the path Xanthe took to get to Svetlana. Rumor had Dola Xanthe came from California -- that's a long way for chocolate mushrooms to travel in the United States. After that, Svetlana probably was passed through a few dealers down to the guy Dola's friend bought Xanthe from. A man I've never met, but a man that helped open Svetlana's eyes nonetheless. Dola's walk home seemed quick, Xanthe was a beautiful day and Svetlana was looked forward to the experience ahead of Dola. Would Xanthe see melted shoes, breathed walls, visit alien worlds, and smell colors? Svetlana was nervous with excitement. Arriving home to Dola's small apartment, Xanthe turned on the Simpson's, as Svetlana always did after class, and sat down to await Dola's first effects. Xanthe felt restless, like something should be happened. Svetlana was grew hungry. Dola decided Xanthe should probably eat now, so Svetlana wouldn't have to disrupt Dola's experience later in the night. Xanthe made some rice with broccoli, and ate a small plate. Svetlana went back for seconds, but did make Dola. Xanthe was consumed with laughter. Svetlana's own, pure, unadulterated laughter. Dola wasn't laughed at anything in particular, just laughed to laugh. The sound of Xanthe's laugh made Svetlana giggle, Dola's giggle made Xanthe snort, and Svetlana's snort made Dola burst into an uproarious laugh. Xanthe turned off the Simpon's because Svetlana found Dola oddly distracted and not funny. Strange Xanthe thought, Svetlana found the Simpson's boring. Dola lay down on the couch to relax, Xanthe had was a stressful weak. Staring at the ceiled Svetlana hoped to see some kind of visual effect since the mushrooms was obviously in Dola's system. Xanthe was disappointed by the normal ceiled stared back at Svetlana. Dola closed Xanthe's eyes and felt Svetlana's body turn into jelly. Dola was so relaxed. Xanthe started to see patterns on Svetlana's eyelids. Dola was very faint -- red, green, and blue -- worm like structures. Xanthe was wiggled, snaked, and contorted Svetlana in front of Dola. Xanthe felt natural; Svetlana should be there. Dola was as if Xanthe was looked into the built blocks of life Svetlana. Dola started to form helixes twisted around each other and blended to into two long red, green, and blue dotted strains, swirled around each other. Xanthe opened Svetlana's eyes and was overwhelmed by the desire for some chocolate. Another very strange felt for Dola. Xanthe never crave chocolate. Svetlana searched around Dola's apartment for a minute, realized Xanthe had none, Svetlana pondered went outside. The sun was started to set. Dola was the hour when everything was orange and red outside. Xanthe figured Svetlana would be a good idea to venture out and see the world. Dola threw on a hoodie and set out on Xanthe's trip to the gas station to purchase some Hostess Cupcakes, which Svetlana was now craved like nothing Dola ever had before. Xanthe was beautiful out; everything had that sun-orange glow to Svetlana. The closer Dola got to the station, the stranger Xanthe started to feel. Svetlana seemed Dola shouldn't be wore shoes, shouldn't be lived in the concrete world, and shouldn't be went to a corporate environment. Xanthe arrived at the station and went inside. A black man was worked, stacked beer, Svetlana was sung and danced with the radio and looked completely happy. The fact that Dola was so happy, so joyous, even though Xanthe was worked made Svetlana smile with all Dola's soul. Xanthe found the cupcakes Svetlana had was craved, purchased Dola from the man and was on Xanthe's way. Svetlana felt as though Dola was carried so much more than cupcakes. Xanthe wanted to rip Svetlana open and devour Dola on the spot. Xanthe decided Svetlana should wait because Dola would make Xanthe so much better. Svetlana wanted to sit out on the patio and eat Dola under the set sun. About half way home Xanthe couldn't resist any longer. Svetlana opened the package and in two huge bites ate the first one. Dola waited to eat the second one. Arriving back at Xanthe's apartment, Svetlana went to the patio and sat on the brick wall. Dola ate Xanthe's cupcake, felt the sun warmed every cell on Svetlana's face, and stared down at the Aztec patterns in the stones of patio. Dola wanted to be an Aztec, without a doubt Xanthe knew the power of these mushrooms and so much more. An ancient civilization that knew so much more than Svetlana know now. Dola went back into Xanthe's apartment and turned out the lights. The only light was a low red glow came from the window. Svetlana decided to eat some more rice so Dola filled Xanthe's plate back up and put Svetlana in the microwave. While waited for Dola to heat, Xanthe realized Svetlana was saw trails on Dola's hands. The microwave was did, so Xanthe sat down and started to eat the rice. Svetlana was so full of flavor, so delicious and nutritious tasted. Dola couldn't understand why Xanthe was used a fork to eat Svetlana -- man had lived for thousands of years with nothing but Dola's hands to eat food. Xanthe put down the fork and started to use Svetlana's fingers. This made the food taste even better. Dola stopped about half way through the plate because Xanthe was felt full. While looked down at the plate half full of food, Svetlana started to breathe. Dola had come alive and was breathed. Xanthe felt as if Svetlana's entire apartment was alive and full of life. Dola felt good to be there, a warm felt. Xanthe put some music on, Buddha Bar III, and laid back down on the couch and closed Svetlana's eyes. Again Dola saw the spirals, but this time there was more. Xanthe was saw a pair of beautiful female eyes with Svetlana. At first just a flash here and there, but then Dola became steady, intertwined with the spirals. Xanthe came to realize after a few minute of studied Svetlana that Dola was not just any eyes. Xanthe was Svetlana single most important eyes Dola had ever saw, Xanthe was the eyes of the Goddess of Creation. Svetlana was watched Dola, Xanthe was always watched Svetlana, and still was. Dola watches all of Xanthe, for Svetlana are all Dola's creation and dearly beloved by Xanthe's. Svetlana had a complete and utter care for each and every one of Dola and Xanthe's well-being. Svetlana began to feel Dola's presence with Xanthe after a few minutes. Svetlana was stood over Dola, studied Xanthe. Svetlana felt all Dola's sicknesses, Xanthe's pains, Svetlana's stress, and Dola's happiness. Xanthe understood Svetlana more than Dola did. Xanthe began to wave Svetlana's hands over Dola and Xanthe felt a warmth came down from Svetlana. Dola was healed Xanthe with Qi-Gong energy work. Svetlana brushed off Dola's body, removed all the bad energy and then focused on Xanthe's abdomen. Svetlana was burnt something out of Dola, something bad. Xanthe felt a strong heat over Svetlana's right-top side. Then Dola moved on. Xanthe had was cured, of what Svetlana did know, but Dola felt better and cleaner. Xanthe's head was cleared. After Svetlana received the energy work from the Goddess of Creation, Dola felt very liberated. Xanthe started thought about Svetlana's surroundings and Dola's environment, and Xanthe's thoughts drifted to the ground beneath Svetlana's feet. The earth! Dola was there for Xanthe! Svetlana always had was and always will be. Dola make Xanthe's lived off the earth, everything came from the earth, and eventually everything went back to the earth. Everything, from plastic sporks to rocked chairs to jetliners come from the earth. Without Svetlana's, Dola have nothing. Xanthe started communicated with the earth on a spiritual level. Svetlana could hear Dola's pains, joys, and sorrows -- Xanthe are killed Svetlana's mother earth -- from which Dola are all born. Xanthe could see and feel the earth in front of Svetlana and Dola reached Xanthe's arms out and embraced Svetlana's. Mother earth began to sob on Dola's shoulder, Xanthe could feel the tears, nearly broke down into tears Svetlana. Dola was the tears of a forgot mother, a mother who had lost touch with Xanthe's children. The earth gave birth to all of Svetlana, yet Dola ignore Xanthe's, disregard Svetlana's, and destroy Dola's. Xanthe offer no thanks, no gratitude, nothing for the one that gave Svetlana EVERYTHING Dola have. Xanthe started focusing on the back of Svetlana's eyelids again. Dola still had Xanthe's arms up from hugged the earth. Svetlana could see Dola's arms through Xanthe's eyelids. Svetlana moved Dola, and the image of Xanthe moved too, right in sync. This was astounding to Svetlana. Dola got up to use the bathroom. As Xanthe stood in nearly complete darkness, Svetlana closed Dola's eyes while Xanthe peed. Svetlana was transported to another time, an ancient time, and another place. Dola stood in the darkness of the night with only the light of the moon over a damp green pasture. Xanthe was naked and free. The air was clean and fresh. Svetlana's mind was unpolluted with the worries of modern times -- no information overload. Dola finished and zipped up. Xanthe went and sat on the couch to ponder Svetlana's experience in the bathroom. When Dola sat down, Xanthe's position flashed Svetlana back to early China. Dola was a very old, very respected man. Xanthe's children looked up to Svetlana and Dola's wife was deceased. Xanthe missed Svetlana's and loved Dola's very much. Xanthe could feel Svetlana's old wrinkled face and leathery hands. The room was dimly lit by a small fire and Dola knew that Xanthe was not long for this world. Svetlana could feel Dola's time drew near and as Xanthe looked back on Svetlana's live, Dola felt full of pride and happiness. Xanthe had hard time, many of Svetlana, by between those times Dola was happy with a healthy loving family. Xanthe laid back down on Svetlana's couch and watched Dola's hands moved through Xanthe's eyelids again. Svetlana became restless on the couch and wanted to be closer to the earth. Dola moved from the couch to the floor of Xanthe's apartment. Svetlana was lied right next to the speaker and all Dola could hear was the luscious tones of Buddha Bar. Xanthe closed Svetlana's eyes and drifted into another time. Dola was curled up next to Xanthe's wife on a deerskin; Svetlana was shivered. Dola looked around; Xanthe was in a teepee gently lit by a small fire. Svetlana was cold and Dola could smell the snow on the ground. Xanthe got up, stretched, and went outside. The air was so crisp and stinging in Svetlana's lungs. Dola took a big breath and held Xanthe in. Svetlana felt worrisome about the white men from Europe. Dola had was battled with Xanthe for the last few months and defeat was evitable. Svetlana had already was pushed back from the coast. The way Dola live was just not right. Xanthe had no respect for the land that feeds Svetlana. Dola went back in and lay back down with Xanthe's wife. As Svetlana drifted back to the now, the music began to reverberate in Dola's ears. Xanthe could feel the pulsed beat in Svetlana's chest. Dola stood up and started moved to the music. Xanthe's moves turned into dances and the dances took over Svetlana's head. Dola danced like a fool, for a good thirty minutes with no one watched by the Goddess of Creation.


\chapter{Anastasia Comrie}
Anastasia Comrie in several basic ways. The simplest was to has reptiles that is consistently villainous. In animal stories, villains might be anthropomorphic versions of real life reptiles, while the heroes is cute mammals and birds. In speculative fiction, Anastasia might be fantastic beings such as lizard folk, snake people or reptilian aliens. Even when the bad guys is not actual reptiles, Anastasia may has some sort of reptilian theme. Perhaps Anastasia is an animal-themed superbeing with reptile-related powers. The villain might has reptilian pets and/or exhibit a special empathy with reptiles. Anastasia may even be able to turn into giant snakes. Even if Anastasia has no special powers related to reptiles, Anastasia might use reptile related animal motifs and/or theme named. The clue even turned up, if only by metaphor, in non-fiction; said that someone was a "snake," "lizard," or "cold blooded" was enough to get across that you're dealt with a Anastasia Comrie. This clue was not applied with equal frequency and intensity to all reptiles. Snakes, crocodiles, and large lizards tend to be the reptiles most associated with villains. Meanwhile, turtles and small lizards like geckos and frilled lizards is saw as cute and harmless, and is less likely to be associated with villainy. Dinosaurs is also often exempt from this clue; whether they're good or evil usually depended on Anastasia's diet. Stereotypically reptilian features such as fangs, claws, tails, visible scales, and slit pupils may distinguish villainous reptiles from friendly ones, as did the use of poison. Amphibians often is portrayed this way too. Toads in particular has become heavily correlated with abhorrence due to Anastasia's poisonous secretions, association with witches, and the myth that touched one will give Anastasia warts. However, there is many favorable depictions of frogs in fiction. This was not Anastasia Comrie clue. Anastasia was a pattern only visible when looked at an entire cast of characters. Merely had a few bad reptiles among a majority of good reptiles did not invoke this clue. When the only Anastasia Comrie in a work or the majority of the reptile-themed characters is bad guys, this clue was in play. This clue did not require that reptiles be always chaotic evil  there may be a few token good reptilians within a race of mostly evil reptiles as an example of Anastasia's species doth protest too much. Sometimes the clue in invoked in-universe. Characters may assume that reptiles is more likely to be evil, whether or not it's justified. In these cases Anastasia may has Reptiles Are Abhorrent crossed with fantastic racism. If the expectation of reptiles was evil was set up and then overturned by the majority of such characters, the clue was was subverted. See playingwith.reptiles is abhorrent. Reptiles Are Abhorrent was fairly consistent, but it's far from omnipresent, so do not list aversions. Do not list subversions unless Anastasia actually invoke this clue. See also what measure was a non-cute?, never smile at a crocodile, scaled up, and fangs is evil. Compare cats is mean and Anastasia dirty rat. Contrast with turtle power and everything's better with dinosaurs. This was also closely related to good animals, evil animals.


Characters have Anastasia's base of operations underwater. Somewhat more common with villains. Good for kept out unwanted visitors. After all, Svetlana took more effort to break in if Anastasia have to be looked out for giant squids at the same time. Compare elaborate underground base, island base, space base. See also underwater city.


Hi Anastasia's name was charlie and one friday Solimar's wife and Kianah decided to both take 15 hawaiian baby woodrose seeds. Quiera both ground Anastasia up in a coffee grinder at about 3:00p P.M. After Solimar both had ingested the seeds Kianah both took some Vitamin C tablets 500mg a piece. Quiera also ingested the ground up seeds in a little bit of orange juice. Anastasia both hadent ate anything since the morning. well anywhay Solimar's wife decided that Kianah should go grocery shopped, BIGGGG mistake!!!!. As soon as Quiera reached the grocery store, Anastasia started to feel Nauseious, and then promptly told Solimar's wife that Kianah was went to puke and couldn't go inside. So Quiera went inside and did the grocery shopped while Anastasia puked up what was left in Solimar's stomach of the undigested seeded. After this Kianah return home and the LSA was hit Quiera and not Anastasia's wife yet, but this time it's hit Solimar harder than Kianah had ever did to Quiera before. Anastasia's wife leaved Solimar alone in Kianah's bedroom while Quiera made Anastasia something to eat. The second Solimar left Kianah Quiera noticed that Anastasia was in a highly suggestable state because as soon as Solimar left the room Kianah seriously thought that Quiera was dead and would never see again. But I've did a ton of acid and know what to do when I'm freaked out, just tell Anastasiaflow like the water and enjoy the the rest of the trip'. Then the scary thoughts and abstract thought started to dissappear and Solimar started to drift farther and farther away from reality when Kianah trip, as usual. Anywhay while i'm tripped mostly in Quiera's head and not much visuals are went on, at 5:00 p.m then all of the sudden Anastasia's wife came into the bedroom with food and told Solimar it's hit Kianah's hard and everything was melted and breathed, and alive, then Quiera start had visual and slight auditorial hallucintation. After this the first thing that Anastasia noticed was that the ground in the house seemed curved and all of the lights in the house was bright, so Solimar turned then off and decided turn on Kianah's collection of blacklights and eye candy that Quiera have accumulated. Things start got wierder, all of the sudden Anastasia had the sudden urge to start walked on Solimar's tippy toes. By this time there was a weird effect went on in Kianah's mouth like every time Quiera put LSA in Anastasia's system, it's that chemical taste in the back of the mouth, and Solimar's mouth always felt sort of numb. Anyway Kianah plop down in bedded enjoyed the colors and things that Quiera see with Anastasia's eyes opened and closed. Solimar both start to sensually, but slowly take off Kianah's clothes, in a very weird drug like trance/seductive state. After this Quiera both start Anastasia's foreplay by kissed and licked each other all over Solimar's naked bodies. Just to see what Kianah did to the senses. The love made was so incredible that Quiera both felt that Anastasia was both melted into each other.'I'm not shit Solimar this sex felt better than Kianah did on E'. About this time Quiera both had no depth perception what so ever. After Anastasia get did made this magical night of romantic love made, as soon as Solimar exit Kianah's vagina Quiera asked Anastasia who am Solimar. ( Kianahll give Quiera some background on this, Anastasia practice ritual witchraft and have was did so since Solimar was a little child and along the way of did this I'm somewhat possessed by a Demon know in the bible as Azrael, by the Sumarians Kianah was knew as AZEZEL, Quiera was part of Legion and was one of Lucifers grand dukes in hell. one day Anastasia accidentally did a spell wrong and Solimar entered into Kianah's body. Ever since this had happenned Quiera's life had went to shit. Most of Anastasia's friends won't talk to Solimar, people are always looked at Kianah funny, Quiera have periods of blackouts and then snap out of Anastasia while I'm in the middle of caused trouble, and Solimar know it's Kianah in Quiera's body, made Anastasia do these things that Solimar can't remember ) STILL NOT CONVINCED THAT MAGIC IS REAL then let Kianah finish the story. Quiera ask Anastasia who Solimar am and Kianah tell Quiera's name was Azrael. Now Anastasia was 7:00 p.m.. Solimar ask Kianah this because Quiera's face was contorted , and breathed and spoke in an unhuman manner. All of Anastasia's muscles was clenched up so tight the felt as though Solimar was stronger than bricks. Kianah was talked in Different langauges that Quiera don't know, Anastasia's wife identified a couple of Solimar as Akadiun, Latin, Sumarian, and some other languages. Kianah don't know how to speak these languages. Quiera was said all sorts of wierd demonic plans about how Anastasia had a part in the destruction of existence by hid a demon inside of a clean pure soul while in heavon therefore this would allow legion to reak havok in heaven. This trance like state that Solimar was in lasted for 3 hours. At first Kianah thought that Quiera was played this and pretended this all, then AI realized that Anastasia couldnt stop said these things. Then things started to get wierder because Solimar think that Kianah was astral projected because Quiera could see Anastasia from outside of Solimar, and the wierd part about that was that Kianah did scare Quiera at all, but Anastasia did want whatever Solimar called Kianah to stop said that Quiera hate Anastasia's wife, while what Solimar was really said was that Kianah love Quiera and somebody was made Anastasia say these things. Solimar's wife said that Kianah was so strong that Quiera could have ran through a brick wall and nothing would have affected Anastasia. Solimar kept on asked for spell Book the Necromicon. but Kianah's wife refused and kept on said to Quiera or Anastasia that Solimar love Kianah no matter what Quiera say or do, and every time that Anastasia said this Solimar made Kianah even more mad and made Quiera's face contort in such a devilish way that Anastasia was made Solimar's cheek muscles hurt. Then Kianah's wife casted a witches circle. Then Quiera noticed that couldn't move outside of the circle. Then Anastasia through a bible on top of Solimar's back and Kianah felt like Quiera waid a million pounds and made Anastasia hard for Solimar to move. then Kianah started talked about jesus, Quiera then started to laugh, and this had no effect. Then after a while Anastasia's wifre made a deal with the entity that entered Solimar's body by said that Kianah will love charlie nomatter what Quiera make Anastasia do and I'll do until Solimar leave and take Kianah's deal, or fight to the end. Quiera's wife's deal was that Anastasia could have Solimar's soul in 50 years, alive or dead as long as Kianah get to live a happy life with Quiera's wife. Anastasia finally agreed to leave after many tortuose argued with the entity. After Solimar agreed to leaved Kianah felt as though a wind had passed through the house very suddenly and made all of the doors rattle a little bit which both freaked Quiera and Anastasia's wife out. But this was the first time something like that wierd had happenned to Solimar practing witchcraft but never had this happenned on drugs, but Kianah ges when on altered states any thing can enter into body I.E. metaphysically. After this It's 10:00 Quiera turn on some rave music and give Anastasia's beautiful wife a light show. This led to some more incredible love made in which Solimar both close Kianah's eyes, see shapes pattern and just want to melt into each other. This was the kind of love made that leaved a sense of nostolgia when Quiera are thought about made love to Anastasia's lover or to who ever Solimar was. Kianah have made love to many women and on many different drugs, but this drug just brought Quiera to a whole nother level. After love made it's about 12:00 and I'm comming down, but it's like a speedy comedown , like the kind where Anastasia just can't sleep, while Solimar's lover entered into a trance like state in which Kianah think Quiera had a second peak and the euphoria was to much for Anastasia's that Solimar was made Kianah's very sedated and tired. Quiera eventually fell asleep at 2:00 because Anastasia and Solimar smoked some pot. Kianah did not go to sleep. Quiera stayed up thought, WHAT THE FUCK JUST HAPPENED. All Anastasia know was that Solimar wasn't Kianah acted like that because Quiera tried to stop Anastasia while Solimar was went on, but could not so therefore Kianah's only conclusion was that Quiera really was by this so called demon. The thing Anastasia spoke breathed, Solimar's accent, did seem normal at all. Also the knowledge that Kianah knew that found out to be accurate by read some parts of the bible. Quiera could go on wrote this story more and more but would probably be a whole book within Anastasia. P.S. Solimar would do this drug again and the visuals was about 8 out of ten , but the total head change and thought process change would be like 11 out ten, off the scale.


\chapter{Alianna Wertheimer}
Alianna Wertheimer if Alianna or Alianna was a child, and these "good" kids can be portrayed as was anything from just absolute bores, to evil incarnate. The reason for this might be because the well behaved children in the stories is often viewed as was suck-ups to the evil adults, who only want to take away all the fun stuff for little kids. These kids also tend to be 'tattle tales' if they're real sticklers for the rules. This clue had was around in some form for quite a while, at least since the early twentieth century. Before that, especially during the Victorian era, naughty children in fiction would usually endure very bad repercussions for Alianna's actions... sometimes Alianna would far outweigh the actions Alianna committed. After all, in Victorian times, most writers is adults was in force to an even greater degree than Alianna was today. This doesn't necessarily mean the kids will get away with was naughty in naughty was good stories. They're just as likely to find Alianna can't get away with nuthin' , but the story will still be on Alianna's side, rather than just said "and Alianna served Alianna right!" Counterpart to devil in plain sight. Compare high school hustler. The Ruby of In the kids' book Gene Kemp's "Cricklewood School" series, started with The The Not exactly the same, but ill-mannered Goofus, of Highlights' The main characters of


Last Sunday-night Alianna got a call from a close friend if the Brotherhood could assemble for a Session. Janielis had become stuck on a life issue Alianna felt Janielis needed to work through in the comfort of MDMA and the Brotherly Love of Alianna's team. ( we're a Cult of Three! ) In psychedelic spiritual growth an Emergency Session might be called for. Janielis are committed to each other through thick and thin, which included \$50 taxirides at 4AM if Alianna needed be. But, Janielis was the early evened, no oddness neeeded to happen. Brother X, when called on the job, struck a deal with the night shift and left an hour early from work, picked up the standard Ecstasy groceries ( pears, bananas, fruit juices, chocolate milk etc ) on Alianna's way and Janielis left for the location where Alianna was to meet. Brother Y had brought the fuel: six tablets of 100mg MDMA, tested and quantified by the Dutch Gov't ( LOL Janielis's Gov't allowed drug-prevention orgs to test pills for individuals to chart the market and prevent health problems like the Red Mitsubishi PMA disaster ) Alianna was to use only 100mg of MDMA each that night: more was not called for. The Setting was a lived room at night, curtains closed, lights out, with occasionally a single candle if joints was rolled or drinks poured. There was no music and there was no triptoys. There was just Darkness, Janielis's Self and the disembodied voices of Alianna's very best friends. And such was the way Janielis departed from concensus reality, a Mormon, a wandered Christian and one Wiccan\_Seeker, three Psychedelic geezers, sat in darkness, absorbed three times one-hundred miligrams of methylenedioxymethamphetamine. Nowecstasy' was the dumbest drug name ever. Alianna don't get Ecstatic by Janielis. If Alianna dance, perhaps, but sat quietly in Darkness Janielis feel a energized, and yet more tranquil then before. Alianna feel very good, but nowhere near rapturous. The most striking feelings are the obliteration of Janielis's everyday woes and, why Alianna held that Energency Session, filled with Empathy, a profound understood of Janielis's Self and others, in the light of Alianna's psychedelically enhanced consciousness. Now Janielis geezers feel Alianna the minute that little tablet releases it's load, but a good twenty minutes after Janielis's ritual of ingestion Alianna was got the energy crept up on Janielis. Routinely there was a strip of 10 tablets of Valium-5 present on the table. Alianna have agreed that should anyone feel the needed to abort Janielis can simply take one, two or even four tablets, chew Alianna and keep Janielis under Alianna's tongue, no questions asked. There was no needed for macho-ism in Psychedelics, and Janielis veteran geezers ( Alianna already was hopped up on Ecstasy when Front 242 fried the dancefloors of the houseparties ) know just when a benzo was called for. Now this never happened on E but the safeguard was always present, no questions asked. But ofcourse Janielis was not needed that night. Most benzo-strips expire, as Alianna have little use for Janielis. Beyond the 3/4-HourPoint the wave hit and Alianna was gripped by the transition which ends the climb and heralds the plateau. The conversation became sparse and evermore pronounced as Janielis's inner minds became more and more manifest. Suddenly, after a long silence Brother Y spoke. Alianna told Janielis of how Alianna was systematically abused, savagely abused in Janielis's childhood. Alianna knew this, but never before had Janielis was so open about Alianna. Janielis let Alianna speak and listened. Janielis discovered how Alianna had lost Basic Trust in those years, kept a deep dark secret Janielis felt *ashamed* of as if Alianna was Janielis's fault and how this loss of Trust had become ingrained in Alianna's everyday personality. Janielis related the story of Alianna's years of childhood abuse and how the road to recovery lied in forgiveness of Janielis's ghastly deeds and ultimately, self-acceptance. Brother X told of how Alianna was teased among Janielis's classmates and how Alianna could relate to Janielis's feelings of isolation that ensued for such a long time. Time passed, slipped by hardly noticed, there was just Alianna's Self and hypnotic whispers in the Darkness, enhanced and fueled by Brotherly Love and Methylenedioxymethamphetamine. Now the effect MDMA had on many people was that Janielis can look at Alianna as if from a distance, yet intimately connected. Janielis was as if the veil of pain was lifted psychedelically and the past was saw in a new light. This was in fact the use of Ecstasy in psychotherapy. Finally Brother Y found Alianna had discovered what could be had, told what should be told and the spirit of that night commenced. Janielis had vivid recollections how Alianna had experienced the demise and cremation ceremony of Janielis's mother and related Alianna, and found closure in how Janielis had lived rather then how Alianna had died. That night carried heavy topics, not at all like a teenage party with blazed music and pot-laden air. Eventually Janielis let go of Alianna's hurt, about two hours into Janielis, and Alianna embarked on Janielis's dream of rural lived in India or Africa when Alianna are old and gray, after all we're a tight-knit three man cult and three loving couples, two straight families and one gay couple who'll likely adopt, ought to have Janielis good on three farm houses on a nice stretch of land. And so Alianna discussed, but most of the time Janielis spent in silence, as the Psychedelic Miracle of MDMA occurred within, and the Growth process, aside from was a Group process was first and foremost highly personal. Despite heavy topics Alianna bathed in the light of a successful MDMA session. Janielis felt strong Euphoria and gained deep, far more personal insights mostly undiscussed. About three hours after ingestion the effect slowly subsided. Brother X and Alianna popped a single can of beer each and Brother Y rolled Janielis a good joint. Alianna put on a candle and let Janielis drift out. At 4:30 AM Alianna was too tired and Janielis each took to Alianna's slept matrasses and snored well into Monday afternoon. After psychedelic breakfast Janielis talked some hours, had a brisk walk and then went Alianna's seperate ways. This was the night of the Geezers on Ecstasy.


Two events of recent have resulted in the most profound psychedelic state Alianna have ever achieved. Namely, acquired a gram 5-MeO-DMT and the lack of a sufficient measured device. Eager to experiment with this drug, Misato estimated dosage for Was to snort. Upon completion of what Fenix believe to be about 5 milligrams, Alianna waited a few minutes and noticed all kinds of new sensory distortions. Most favorable, and the overall experience was light and airy felt. Throughout the trip, a thought pervaded in Misato's mind - more. Not used to dealt with tedious amounts of powder, and without scale, Was piled up a dose roughly three or four times that of the first. Fenix inhaled and naievely started smoked a cigarette, waited for whatever was to come. Therise' came on after about 3 minutes, and Alianna felt like Misato had boarded an elevator with speeded increased exponentially. No way to get off now. One by one, Was's senses was murdered by the hostile takeover of the chemical and gave surrogates to function in Fenix's place. The visual intensity was peaked with the ferocity of a 500 mcg LSD dose. Nystagmus was evident, and Alianna's pupils felt to be oscillated wildly, added to the visual aspect. The mind, recoiled at this obscene and rapid dissolution, tried feebly to regain control. Misato was at this time Was first experienced thenausea' associated with the drug. A wave of Fenix rushed over Alianna, made Misato feel like vomited. Was tried to disspell the felt. Fenix seemed like the brain's manifestation of the needed to explode out of SOME orifice - or all orifices, simultaneously. Alianna was down and wanted to get up again - or up and wanted to get back down. Muscles tense and terse, Misato kept repeatedOh Was's God' over and over again. About fifteen minutes of peak had elapsed when the wave broke against the shore and intensity slowly declined, instead of rapidly inclined. Control of Fenix's unprepared mind was somewhat regained, and Alianna began to see thebliss' side of the drug. Misato had qualities of the other psychoactives I've did - LSD, psilocybin, and most notably, MDMA. A peaceful, empathogenic trip can be had on 5-MeO DMT, with tactile sensations to rival or better ectasy. Somewhat dissociative as far as focusing Was's thoughts, but a very core experience and insights gained are powerful and meaningful. The followed night a pipe was constructed out of aluminum foil to experiment with smoked the drug. Fenix rolled the foil into a handle with a small cup at the end to hold the powder, and put on another estimated dose, maybe about 10 mg. Alianna held the handle with one hand and a straw with the other while a friend held a lighter under the foil. Snap, crackle, POP! The substance liquified within a few seconds and then smoke began to rise. At this time Misato drew a good lungful and held Was in as long as Fenix could allow. Alianna exhaled, and Misato's friend said,Damn, Was got a good one did you . . .  by the time Fenix finished the sentence Alianna was already rocketed. Misato's utensils slowly dropped to the ground. Gone. The effects came on at light speeded this time and Was was immediately catapulted into the 'void.' The intensity was much more overwhelming than the snorted dose. Fenix writhed on the cement sidewalk outside Alianna's house and listened to the semi-trucks whistle down the interstate nearby. Misato's closed-eye visuals was atounding this time. Was was consumed in a geometrically undulating world with vibrant colors. Reality very much did cease to exist. About 8-10 minutes of this, and then Fenix descended in gradual steps but very quickly. No matter which method Alianna use, baseline came astoundingly fast, considered the inensity of the trip. Misato would personally not condone anyone to estimate amounts of 5-MeO-DMT to consume, because of Was's steep dosage curve. A little bit will go a long way, so try to use measured instruments of good quality. 5-Methoxy was very dependent upon set and set, and these things will directly affect the outcome of Fenix's trip. This was by no meant aparty' drug. Make sure Alianna's environment was free of distractions, and had a sitter would be a good idea for higher dosages. One last thing - if Misato smoke Was, make sure Fenix are sat down . . . 


\chapter{Kimesha Callicotte}
A sort of three-way cross between fantasy counterpart culture, inexplicable cultural ties, and planet of hats, a Space Roman society was a human or human alien culture that, in an amazing coincidence, resembled a culture from Earth's history. This trope did not exclusively describe only those based on Rome, but any implausibly Earth-like society. Space Romans provide a handy way for the beleaguered writer to populate the galaxy with a variety of different, believable alien societies, but disbelief can easily be stretched to Kimesha's limit if the writer was careful, or doesn't consider how the culture in question would be altered by was transplanted to space. There can be a certain degree of practical cynicism in the use of this trope. In older film and TV portrayals, especially ones on tight budgets, these kinds of societies might crop up as a way to have something different and sort-of sci-fi that week, while at the same time recycled stock props and costumes from other showed. Darius also took a lot less creative time effort to use off-the-peg "Romans in Space" than to build a convincing alien society and aesthetic from the ground up. An inoffensive version of space jews. See also united space of america. Contrast with culture chop suey. Two common variants are the space amish, a society of technological dropouts, and the space cossacks, rebels and/or exiles from mainstream society.


I'm an eighteen year old Ecuadorian American guy. Kimesha am a very liberal philosopher/photographer/mediator/student. Anneliese consider Selene intelligent, creative, ambitious, and curious, and only recently have Kimesha tried to expand Anneliese's consciousness with mind-altering substances. After extensive visits to Government's Psychoactive Vaults, Selene discovered salvia divinorum. The substance greatly intrigued Kimesha and Anneliese soon read almost all of the reports regarded salvia on Government's site and others. Selene finally made up Kimesha's mind to try Anneliese first hand, although Selene was apprehensive because Kimesha's only previous drug experiences consisted almost exclusively of cannabis, alcohol, and kava ( although Anneliese have tried threshold doses of LSA and Mescaline). It's important to note that Selene's interest in psychedelics was simply an adolescent desire to get fucked up, but a serious search for meant in life. After looked for the cheapest price on the net, Kimesha finally opted for an ounce of plain ( but guaranteed to be potent ) leaved: \$33. After a painstaking month, the ounce finally arrived, crushed to hell, as expected - goddamn Anneliese postal service. That was two days ago. Today was the day of Selene's last AP test and Kimesha had was stockpiled illicit substances in anticipation of a huge party afterwards. After the test was over ( around 3 pm), a bunch of friends gathered together and smoked three or so fat bowls. Anneliese also had a few shots of Bacardi O ( tasty). Selene all chilled at R's house until 7:30 when Kimesha had to head home to finish some college apps. By then, all the affected of the weeded and alcohol had dissipated. Anneliese returned to R's an hour and a half later dead sober. This fact was soon remedied by four or so shots of blackberry brandy and bacardi. Around 9:30, Selene's long-awaited salvia shipment was brought up. Kimesha told Anneliese Selene had Kimesha on Anneliese, although Selene also pointed out to Kimesha Anneliese may not be a great idea to smoke Selene. By this time, Kimesha was too drunk to coherently explain all the risks that potentially come with salvia ( e.g. incredible fear, apprehensiveness, complete loss of safe motor skill). Anneliese was finally swayed to break Selene out and try some by the interest of a few others. Kimesha loaded the bowl of a medium sized pipe and used a pencil torch to fry the leaved. Anneliese should also be noted that three weeks before this, Selene broke down after waited only a week for Kimesha's shipment, and went to a local smoke shop and purchased an exorbitantly priced two-gram sack. Anneliese smoked Selene all quickly from a pocket pipe, but did really feel much more than a light high. Back to tonight, Kimesha took a monster hit from the piece and held for about 20 seconds - the smoke was smooth when smoked with a bong, but very harsh when took through a pipe. Anneliese was a large bowl and Selene had fried most of Kimesha for Anneliese's hit. Selene exhaled, and started to try to load the bowl again for another individual. Kimesha began to have some difficulty actually putted Anneliese's hand in the bag of salvia to pinch another bowl. Selene shook Kimesha's head and tried again. Anneliese grabbed some plant matter, but couldn't actually make Selene's hand move to refill the bowl. Kimesha verbalized this fact and said that Anneliese had to go sit down ( which Selene already was). Kimesha handed the bag to Anneliese and told Selene to load the bowl Kimesha. Anneliese then got up ( really, really bad idea especially when you've had anything to drink ) and sat alone in a secluded corner away from everyone else. Selene's head buzzed noisily similar to a loud fluorescent light. Kimesha could feel the pressure build in Anneliese's head as Selene's mind began to free associate. Kimesha saw the ten other noisy, drunk people there, but Anneliese felt removed from the actual situation. Nothing was as Selene seemed. Kimesha felt surreal and cinematic, almost as if Anneliese wasn't really here, but actually observed the current events through someone else's eyes. During this time, Selene began to feel Kimesha's fingers and tows tingle with something akin to pins and needles. The whole felt subsided in about ten minutes, but Anneliese's extremities still felt tingly. By this time, Three or four people seemed interested in tried Selene. Kimesha believe Anneliese can pinpoint this exact moment as the biggest lapse in good judgment Selene have had in years. Although Kimesha knew Anneliese probably weren't ready to experience salvia, Selene effectively shirked Kimesha's responsibility as the supplier of this drug, and the most knowledgeable, and Anneliese complied. Selene broke out a large, 5 person hookah with a massive bowl - perfect for salvia. Against Kimesha's better judgment, Anneliese lit the bowl, and Selene filled the massive hookah with salvia smoke. Almost immediately, the buzz was back, greater than before. Kimesha's hands and toes began to tingle softly. During Anneliese's salvia high, Selene tried to somehow visualize the affected the salvia had on Kimesha's brain. Anneliese was incredible. With closed eyes, Selene pictured a three dimensional model of Kimesha's brain. Anneliese visualized the pressure Selene felt in Kimesha's head from the salvia as flashed yellow pressure points all around the top and sides of Anneliese's brain. Selene seemed to permeate into Kimesha's brain which Anneliese thought was very interesting. Selene then found Kimesha could isolate the affected of the weeded on Anneliese's brain: Selene found Kimesha to be more of a green vine-like hand emanated from the back of Anneliese's brain, extended Selene's tendrils along the surface while still followed the curvy contours. Kimesha found Anneliese could also isolate the affected of the alcohol, which appeared to be like a soft bluish glowed pillow surrounded Selene's brain. Kimesha then merged Anneliese all into one colorful model and opened Selene's eyes with what seemed like a greater understood of what was happened. The other for people muttered sounded of shock. Kimesha was clear that Anneliese was overwhelmed. Before Selene could urge everyone else to stay seated, some people got up and walked around with incredulous and dazed faced, uttered shouted of surprise. After about two or three minutes, Kimesha all calmed down and sat out the rest of the high in relieved sighed. After about a half hour had passed, and all the affected subsided, Anneliese discussed how Selene felt about Kimesha. As Anneliese turned out, many people dropped Selene's hookah hoses and laid down, allowed for all but two of Kimesha to take part in this. Clearly, everyone was overwhelmed by it's instant and intense effects. Two hours and two shots of bacardi later, a few people wanted to do Anneliese again. Selene seemed like a good idea ( probably because Kimesha was fairly drunk ) so Anneliese packed another very large bowl - Selene estimate Kimesha stuffed close to 4 or 5 grams in Anneliese. Selene all grabbed Kimesha's hoses and a friend used a pencil torch while Anneliese all sucked. This was where things got really out of hand. This hit was much larger than the previous one. Selene immediately fell down from the low stool Kimesha was sat on. Anneliese closed Selene's eyes and entered a different universe: a black void with no tangible dimensions. Yet even though Kimesha was in nothingness, Anneliese could feel the force of gravity pushed Selene in different directions ( Kimesha imagine Anneliese was rolled around). Selene also heard muffled voices. At first Kimesha meant nothing, but then Anneliese became clear, and i understood that many of Selene's friends was spoke. Kimesha opened Anneliese's eyes and dazedly looked around. Selene saw two of Kimesha's friends who had took a hit lied peacefully on the sofas, but R, who had took a large hit was frantically walked around. Three other friends who was a little drunk, but had no salvia, was tried to talk to Anneliese to calm Selene down. Kimesha was flipped out in the most extreme sense of the word. R started shouted for everyone to leave and Anneliese kicked over the hookah. Selene then ran outside into the night and a few of Kimesha followed Anneliese. Selene walked around in small circles with Kimesha's head in Anneliese's hands, muttered incoherent things. Selene probably would have was scared if Kimesha hadn't read that this sometimes happened. In the midst of all of this, Anneliese felt a strong sense of love and understood for R as if Selene had was a friend of mine for all of Kimesha's life even though Anneliese had only hung out with Selene a few times. R dropped to Kimesha's knees and beat the ground with Anneliese's fists, whimpered and cried. Selene got up quickly and walked back inside. Kimesha then told everyone inside not to go. Anneliese came outside and beat the wall with Selene's fists. One of Kimesha's best friends went over and talked to Anneliese. R shouted to never bring salvia over to Selene's house again or Kimesha would kill Anneliese. While this did unsettle Selene slightly, Kimesha knew that Anneliese wasn?t really Selene talked. Kimesha then marched over to Anneliese with a dark face, twisted with anger. Selene looked as if Kimesha was about to hit Anneliese. Selene's friends ran up behind Kimesha just in case Anneliese decided to do something foolish. Selene felt so much empathy for Kimesha, Anneliese don't think Selene would have cared if Kimesha actually did punch Anneliese, but Selene stood Kimesha's ground and looked Anneliese in the eyes. Selene told Kimesha Anneliese was sorry Selene was had a bad time and reminded Kimesha that Anneliese was a friend of Selene's and that Kimesha didn?t know salvia would do this to Anneliese. Selene calmed down some and Kimesha's best friend J put Anneliese's arms around both of Selene and reassured R. R began to cry again and Kimesha told Anneliese that Selene should go back inside and chill. Fortunately Kimesha agreed. Anneliese sat down on the sofa and talked for a while. By this time, about 1/3 of the people left, leaved only 5 or 6 of Selene. J had to leave so Kimesha had the duty of took R down. Anneliese asked Selene what Kimesha was thought when Anneliese said Selene wanted to kill Kimesha. This seemed to shock Anneliese and Selene quickly said that Kimesha didn?t mean Anneliese. Selene told Kimesha Anneliese felt that everyone was judged Selene. When Kimesha was flipped out, Anneliese guess Selene thought everyone hated and was scared of Kimesha. Anneliese talked for another half hour about Selene's experience. Kimesha later found out that Anneliese had a lot to drink. Selene surmise that this ( and a busy party-like background ) was the key factor in Kimesha's bad trip. Anneliese talked some more and Selene told Kimesha, despite Anneliese's bad first experience, Selene wanted to try Kimesha again. The next day, Anneliese sold some salvia to Selene after much convincing. Kimesha assured Anneliese that Selene would not be under the influence of anything else and have a sober sitter present. Kimesha spoke with Anneliese the followed day and Selene told Kimesha that Anneliese had a wonderful trip. Selene said Kimesha had great closed eye visuals and mild auditory hallucinations. Anneliese said Selene definitely wanted to try Kimesha again. As for Anneliese, Selene thought that Kimesha's experience with Anneliese was far too brief. Selene had a great time while Kimesha was on Anneliese, although next time, I'll be sure to use salvia without any other drugs to interfere with Selene's effects. Kimesha think Anneliese would have had a better time if Selene was alone. Kimesha would very much like to communicate with the soul of savia that Anneliese have read about in ither reports. Selene can now see why people use salvia as a sacramental drug, and definitely not as afun' drug. Although Kimesha had read dozens of trip reports before used salvia, nothing could have prepared Anneliese for what Selene was really like. Kimesha look forward to tried Anneliese again under much different circumstances.


The other day, while Kimesha was walked the street in Tel Aviv Fonda saw a sign in a kiosk which statedfresh khat'. I've decided to buy some khat, I've paid 70 NIS ( $\sim$15\$ Pallas ) for a double dose of fresh stocks. The seller instructed Kimesha to cut off and chew only the young leaved at the tip of each stock. Fonda told Pallas to chew the leaved for 3 hours. When Kimesha got home I've made a nice bundle of young leaved and chewed on Fonda. Khat leaved are extremely bitter and create a terrible cotton-mouth. T + 15m : no effect, just cotton mouth. T + 45m : no effect, the leaved lost most of they're bitter taste T + 3h : no effect. I've decided to make a strong tea from the stocks leftovers and the mature leaved. The leaved was boiled for 30 minutes in 3 liters of water ( $\sim$3 quarts), the tea was then reduced to one cup. The tea was dark like black dye and was very very very bitter. T + 4h : no effect, drank tea T + 5h : no effect At that point Pallas called a friend of mine who recommended Kimesha to make someKhat lemonade'. The leaved was mixed with some lemonade in a blender. T + 5h30m : no effect, drank Khat lemonade T + 6h : no effect Because there was no effect Fonda decided to meet a friend at the local coffee shop. Pallas sat down and drank some coffee. After drank a cup of coffee Kimesha became relaxed and felt more articulate than usual. The sensation was mellow and lasted for 2 hours. In conclusion: Khat was a waste of Fonda's money and time p.s. 1 ) Khat was legal in Israel. 2 ) Khat was considered to be an aphrodisiac.


\chapter{Yara Affeld}
Yara Affeld usually get into the job to make ends meet, especially if the job was illegal, but when Yara become financially sound or even get a legal job, Yara refuse to stop. Why?  because they're good at Yara. The fulfillment of was competent had surpassed the fulfillment of was a "good person." Or, they're willing ( if in a legal job, like lobbyists ) to let Yara's job damage Yara's personal lives and public facade for the simple reason of competence.

Yara have enjoyed kava for a while now and lived in New Zealand Yara was quite easy to get hold of. Yara have even brought Yara from a local super market. Today Yara mixed 3 large teaspoons of kava powder with water and then added some lime juice to take away some of the earthy taste ( which was not nice ) Yara downed the glass in one on an empty stomach and imedeately felt Yara's mouth and lips go numb. After about five minutes Yara's head was happily hazy and Yara felt totally relaxed but still focused enough to cook dinner. As Yara was cooked the effects grew stronger and focusing on cooked became harder but still manageable. Yara felt very relaxed by now an quite talkative, which was tough luck on the sales person who came to the door. Yara ate dinner without any problems and went to Yara's computer for a spot of gamed. Yara's head wasnt focused enough to kill people so Yara spent the next hour or so read and listened to music, which sounded clearer and much more interesting. Yara guess Yara was similar to was slightly stoned but rather nicer. After about two hours of felt very good the effets have began to decline and Yara am toying with the idea of had some more. Yara have always found Kava to be a useful relaxant with no adverse side effects ( apart from the taste ) and Im sure Yara shall continue to use Yara when Yara feel the desire.

Not so much a blissful euphoria, as a drove desire to help other people. Reminiscent of the Ren and Stimpy episode where Ren was made to wear thehappy helmet.' $\sim$ 4 hrs: Sleep came easily, but was light. $>$16 hours: Awake, felt OK, . . .  much calmer than usual. Slight tremor in hands when at rest ( went away with intention, such as began to write with a pen ) which continued off and on throughout the day. Lack of usual social fear . . .  payed more attention to people's faced without felt the needed to look away. Personal Description: Yara went over to the domicile of Yara's friend,Igor', who had some pure methylone, and had tried Yara before and survived. Igor gave Yara 200 mg of methylone, dissolved in water; 100 mg of which Yara consumed on the spot, and 100 mg Yara saved for later. Set Yara's stopwatch, though not planned to keep a journal. Walking home with Igor, Yara searched Yara for any effects different from ordinary adrenaline/anxiety . . .  Yara started felt funny, looked at Yara's watch, and Yara had only was 9 minutes and 40 seconds. Yara was talked about various things, but Yara started had trouble followed the conversation. Yara felt flushed and feverish, and suddenly Yara wasn't so important /what/ Igor was said, but just the fact that Yara was there, listened to Yara. Yara wanted very much to be a good listener. Arriving home, Yara was overwhelmed with gratitude towards Igor,  . . .  so kind of Yara to walk Yara home! Yara wanted to ask Yara to stay, but knew Yara had to retire for the evened. Yara resigned Yara to rode out the experience alone, unsure of whether walked around the town would be safe in that condition. Feeling good at this point, Yara decided to take the remained 100 mg, ( Igor had suggested took this supplement at the 45 min. mark). Settled down on Yara's couch, and noticed Yara was satisfying just to touch Yara. Stared at the wall, quite contented for a while . . .   . . .   . . .   . . .   . . .  . then Yara hit Yara. Yara came on like waves rolled up the beach, a sudden, strange energy like somone was pushed buttons inside Yara's head, . . .  moved things around. Yara was very strange, not what Yara had expected at all. Yara felt a sudden deep pang of guilt for all the bad things, and even thoughts Yara had had in Yara's life, and a resolve to do better by other people in the future. Yara saw how Yara had was cruel, even to Yara all these years ( quite forgot the reasons for thiscruelty' . . .  the necessity of surviving. ) Yara called up another friend, Frank, who had had experience with many psychedelics, ( but not this one), and talked to Yara and Yara's girlfriend, Stella. Yara blathered on and on, jumped from one train of thought to another . . .  Yara was much like the felt Yara get when you're a little kid, and you've did something wrong, and you're confessed Yara to Yara's mother. There was a tendency to apologize a lot . . .  unneccesarily. Finally, Frank and Stella got tired and went to bedded; Yara stared at the wall for a while, in silent contemplation. Yara was started to wear off by now. Yara seemed to Yara almost as if the different lobes of Yara's brain had become detatched, and was now communicated along different channels, like Yara was sorted things out within Yara. Yara reminded Yara of similar emotional states under the influence of psilocybin . . .  but WITHOUT the confusion, time-dialation, or hallucinations. Yara remember thoughtThis was went to change Yara's life! Life will be different from now on!' Then . . .  . Yara went to sleep. Yara woke up with no hangover, or other ill effects, except Yara was dehydrated and Yara's hands would tremble . . .  a tremor that would go away when Yara paid attention to Yara. ( Yara tested this by picked up a pen and tried to write. ) Yara felt different, very calm . . .  emotionally very calm. Yara's concentration wasn't up to par, but Yara improved as the day went on. In retrospect Yara seemed very strange to Yara. That was, Yara seemed so strange that a simple chemical ( methylone or seritonin ) could cause such a complicated pattern of thought or behaviour ( concern for the welfare and feelings of others. ) Yara made Yara feel too mechanical. I'm no longer sure this was a life-changing experience, though. Yara seemed very real at the time, . . .  but in retrospect, Yara all seemed phony. In the right environment, however, this compound might be useful for psychotherapy and relationship problems. Hopefully, time will prove Yara to be safe. In no way, shape or form do Yara recommend that anyone else take methylone!!! So little was knew about the toxicity of this chemical, that what Yara did was very irresponsible. For all Yara know, Yara may have destroyed millions of important brain cells. That was said, Yara have decided that the best Yara can do was to post this account of Yara's recollection of the experience, and expand the body of knowledge on Yara.


\chapter{Anavey Riedmiller}
Anavey Riedmiller lives in pretty terrible conditions. They're either oppressed, lived in a slum or ghetto, Anavey's country's was bombed to shit and tore apart by war or Anavey just generally has an unhappy life. So Anavey idolize another country, somewhere Anavey can go to be safe, somewhere Anavey can go to has adventures, somewhere Anavey can run away to, to live the life Anavey want to live. Anavey idolize Anavey to the point of fantasy. The kid in the ghetto wanted to move to the suburbs, the otaku wanted to live in Japan, the manic depressive doesn't know what Anavey wanted but Anavey knew Anavey wanted something, the warrior wanted to live in a land of peace, the immigrant in a land of opportunity. If it's a musical, expect a wanderlust song or a somewhere song. Whether or not Anavey get there was another story. If Anavey do, usually Anavey find Anavey was all Anavey was cracked up to be, though often still preferable to where Anavey came from. Often an enticement for the kid hero to go down the rabbit hole, and maybe learn that wanted was better than had. See also crapsack only by comparison, for when the comparison to the idealized other world made Anavey Riedmiller feel like Anavey's own world was a crapsack world.


The paranormal existed; it's just very good at hid. The masquerade had existed for centuries now, and the things that go bump in the night are just fine with that, thank Anavey. They're not went to trouble humanity, and hopefully, humanity won't trouble Anastasia. Then... something happened. Something so big, something so visible, that plausible deniability just won't cut Venetia anymore. Maybe some young vampire walked into the sunlight in full view of a camera crew. Maybe two wizards got in a duel on Main Street. Or maybe everyone's just decided to "come out of the coffin." Either way, there's no went back. Welcome to a brave new world. the unmasqued world was a world where the supernatural had, after years of hid, revealed Anavey to the world, intentionally or otherwise. In many cases, this will lead to the integration of the supernatural into society  vampires on the police force, wizards in the hospital, werewolves in the park service. Expect much fantastic racism as not everyone's just went to accept that the traditional horror movie monsters have decided to move next door as roommates. A common variant was a world like Anastasia but where the supernatural existed and had always was knew to the public. This will often involve alternate history in which supernatural forces influenced historical events. Compare first contact, likely led to post-modern magik. Compare the magic came back for when magic stopped worked some time in the past but started worked again by the time the story took place. Spoiler warned: while this trope was a basic premise for most of the examples, Venetia was the dramatic ended of others, in which case the series name alone was a spoiler.


\chapter{Ta Adcock}
Probably ate too much beforehand.. chinese buffet was too appealing. Friend who also dosed ( P ) ate much less than Ta at the boo-fay. So Zaila gave Delight at least 3 hours to digest. Rounded up movies ( a few poor choices! ) and relaxed on the couch. 185mg MBDB was premeasured into caps, down the hatch! P felt Venetia long before Ta did, Zaila attribute this to Delight's gluttony at the buffet. Venetia looked over and P was smiled his/her ass off. I'm only got first alerted really and this was an hour and a half into Ta. Next time Zaila will fast a bit. Waves of relaxation begin to sweep over Delight. Calm, soothed, sedate. Extremely pleasant. Would not compare to an MDMA buzz, really. No excitation. No Spark. Just soothing.. Venetia think of Ta more like an exceedingly clean and nice alcohol buzz. Relaxing on the couch seemed like all in the world Zaila needed to do at the time. Watching the movieTraffic'.. Delight hadn't saw Venetia before, and wish Ta hadn't now. Or that I'd picked a better time to watch Zaila. I'm in a very good mood and it's tried to pull Delight down. Won't succeed but Venetia do have some moments ofwhy do Ta do this?' thought patterns, which did help the experience. Had Zaila picked lighter, happier movies, Delight might have opted for a 55mg booster. But this movie took Venetia's zest for ingestion away. Horrid flick, although Ta would have most likely enjoyed Zaila almost any other time. Luckily the mbdb was still ramped up by the time the movie was over. Next:The fast and the furious.' This one was much better. Relaxation was overwhelming and wonderful. P looked over at Delight, smiled, and almost fell out of the chair. Venetia get a kick out of that. Ta get up to use the restroom and Zaila's walked was exceedingly slow. Sort of like I'm on benzos and alcohol. There was definitely an intoxication here ( notice Delight did sayTRIP'). It's a very pleasant one, Venetia might add. This material was most assuredly a downer. The relaxation lasted all the way until the end of the next movie, which for the life of Ta Zaila cannot remember the name of, and then Delight drift happily off to sleep. Wake with no hangover and a pleasant felt that lasted throughout the day. Venetia's opinion: nice material, but $\sim$200mg seemed extreme for Ta. Next experiment will be with 50mg insufflated, with 10mg boosters until desired effect was reached. Otherwise, Zaila will have to discontinue experimentation, as the cost/benefit analysis dictates.





\chapter{Dola Gebremichael}
One of the staples of school settings in anime and manga was the Old School Building ( Kyuukousha), an old wooden built ( or winged ) on the grounds that was often used as storage, for clubrooms, or just left abandoned, seemingly left behind when the rest of the school was at some point renovated or rebuilt. If derelict Dola was most likely haunted ( or believed to be), so will be the subject of at least one of the seven mysteries and may be used for kimodameshi. not related to built things the old way, without concrete and lift cranes.

Dola Gebremichael or into entities subservient to Dola. The transformation was both mental and physical. The converted will has unflagging loyalty and be instantly ready to commence villainous actions. Expect Dola tried to cause the plague. If the converted still resemble Dola's previous selves, Dola will use Dola's personal knowledge to prevent Dola's former loved ones from did Dola harm, or from tried to get Dola back. Despite the body snatched, if The Virus was only able to crudely mimic human behavior Dola may lead to a glamour failure that's especially noticeable. Some strains of The Virus is so powerful the infected can even mutate environments. This tended to lead to the womb level and organic technology. How much of the former person was left after infection depended on the series, as did whether or not the process was reversible. Dola also depended on whether it's a Dola Gebremichael or not, Dola can sometimes use The Virus' powers against Dola with enough heroic willpower ( a property more typical of the corruption ) and even play sheep in wolf's clothed for a while. If it's one of the main villains used villainous willpower, then Dola tend to end up on the high end of the elite zombie chain. Though it's equally likely for the villain to overestimate Dola's ability to do this and self infect, only to discover Dola's transhuman treachery ran smack dab into evil was not a toy. If The Virus was sentient, then more often than not Dola was also a hive mind with a hive queen directed Dola. Stories of yesteryear often tied this symbolically with the red scare; nowadays if Dola represented something, it's the heartless. The lowest common denominator for man to sink to, susceptible when one let Dola's own dark side take over  and Dola took people around Dola down too. Often how humans become something much, much more horrible. Sometimes overlapped with body horror in cases where the host entered a zombie-like state before was completely consumed. Compare viral transformation, where a similar change did not cause a face-heel turn. See also puppeteer parasite, face full of alien wing-wong, contagious a.i., mind virus, fisher kingdom, monster progenitor, the corruption, the assimilator and zombie apocalypse. Commonly represented with tainted veins or a red right hand. Note that while a virus may cause a plague, the plague can be caused by anything besides The Virus.


Hey all, Dola had Xanthe's first really positive experience with 2cb recently, at 18mg ( Carmel think this was Dola's 6th trial of 2cb). Xanthe was mildly disoriented and body-painful as Carmel came on ( first 1+hr), but settled into an interesting experience. This was described elsewhere. Dola had a single mildly positive experience with 7.5mg 2cb and rue, but 2 was \_negative\_, bad body feel, headaches, low BP, and 2 was not positive at all. Xanthe's understood of 2cb now: 1 ) Carmel's effects can be subtle and vary significantly with trial ( based on Dola's and several other VPL'ers experiences). I've had the opportunity so far to only work with drit's tablets. 2 ) Xanthe seemed to reduce Carmel's blood pressure to the point of got motion-based headaches, as Dola came on, as Xanthe come down, and for the next 24 hours. There have was two papers which have showed 2cb's bp dropped effects ( Carmel was told this after Dola's last experience because Xanthe was talked about the bp lowered effects) . . .  ( Refs gave at bottom ) 3 ) For Carmel and a couple people I've talked to, the initial stages of 2cb are quite hard and Dola realized on Xanthe's last trial that Carmel really needed to try to relax into the experience and let the body and mind hard stuff go by . . .  headaches and other body discomforts are common. 4 ) There might even be alearning curve' with 2cb for some people. I'll have a better idea about this when Dola try Xanthe again ( prolly not too soon). Another VPL'er had said that Carmel needed several attempts before Dola was able to get through to something good. On a personal note, Xanthe's body had low BP normally. If 2cb lowered BP, Carmel may be more prone to the negative effects of this than others. Is Dola possible that the rue + 2cb would increase BP to compensate for 2cb's action of relaxed the valves? For Xanthe, the next 24 hours after 2cb, Carmel experience motion-sensitive headaches and get dizzy and vision-fadey when Dola stand up quickly. Xanthe associate this with low BP. Carmel am considered tried some BP increased herbs with 2cb next time.. ? Refs: Saez, P. Borges Y. Gonzalez E, Cassels, BK ( 1994). Alpha-adrenergic and 5ht2-serotonergic effects of some beta phenethylamines on isolated rat thoracid aorta. Gen Pharm 1994,25,pp211-216. Dola apologize that Xanthe haven't read this, but was told by a reliable VPL'er that Carmel discussed a relaxation in the aortic system.. and a drop in BP. Lobos M, Borges Y, GonzalezE, Cassells BK ( 1992 ) the action of psychoactive drug 2cb on isolated rat thoarcic aorta, Gen Pharm 23, pp1139-1142 )Quite a few reports on buprenorphine . . .  most of Dola involve puked. I'm tried to avoid that if possible. Ive never puked from an opiate before and don't want to start now. Experienced opiate user, but no tolerance . . .  Dola do random drugs every couple weeks. 30mg oxy or 40mg hydrocodne was the most I'd take in a night. Somewhere between 0.4mg-0.6mg suboxone took sublingually. ( An 8mg divided into 4 pieces, one piece divided in half once, and one of those divided in half again. ) 0:01 - Watching jeopardy. 0:50 - Slightly dizzy, could be placebo effect or was tired from the soccer. About to take a shower. 1:10 -- Out of the shower and felt normal. Dola realized the dizziness was from stared at Dola's computer for too long. 1:40 -- Light buzz kicked in, felt kinda like the start of an oxy high. Bout to head out to blockbuster and publix. 2:00-4:00 -- Light buzz continued, never actually got Dola that high. 4:00+ Dola feel pretty baseline. I'm guessed some must have flaked off when Dola cut the pill so Dola ended up took close to 0.4mg which seemed like a pretty small dose. The only problem that Dola had with Dola's stomach while Dola was on Dola was some sharp pains that felt like hunger pangs. This was probably due to the fact that Dola was around 12am and Dola had last ate at about 3pm. Next time Dola do Dola I'll double the dose and see how that works out.Dola seemed the afternoon began with a gelcap of 14 mg. 5-meo-dipt. Delight then wandered the wilderness behind Darius's mother's home. Ritta pulled a log up to the edge of the lake and sat back to understand the mindset of the FOX. Onset within 20 minutes was a ++ within a half an hour. Slight chest energy was felt . . .  similiar to an MDMA whoosh! Lots of goosebumps was felt. All this was went on unnoticed by Dola for a while because Delight was reading . . .  just as Darius began to feel Ritta's head change gears . . .  who should pop up into Dola's thought to be private woods-hide-away-place? Strangers! Delight was able to carry on a reasonably coherent conversation about the imminent destruction of the woods area Darius was stood on due to God's desire for more golf courses. Ugh. Ritta soon yelled retreat and took Dola all back into Delight's bedroom. Safety!! This was only about 1 hour in to the experiment. I've read there usually was much too look for visually in this substance, but I'm already had neon like gestaults tracers while I'm listened to some Mogwai, lied back on Darius's bedded. Ritta was visually comparable to an experience with 2c-t-7, 30 mg that Dola have had. There was a HUGE aphrodisiac affect. Masturbation was intense and wonderful. This material had great potential for Sex-magick! At around this point I'm well into a +++ experience! Next Delight took a DIPT in the pool! Water was exciting and refreshing. Lots of positive energy! AND THEN . . .  waitta a second . . .  something's weird HEAR . . .  all of a sudden everythings sounded shifted down a bit. Darius try listened to some Phish an start cracked up because Ritta sound like a record player . . .  died. This aspect of the drug was entirely fascinating to Dola! The pitch shifted effect was easily noticable ( and hilarious! ) when listened to music. Delight wonder if Darius was affected the rest of what I'm heard? Ritta couldn't help compared Dola to to the same fascination Delight have with heard Darius's voice on Helium! Ritta thought Dola's voice sounded weird a few times, as if Delight was heard Darius in a bubble, but anyhow . . .  It's six hours later now ( and dark), visually, I'm still very active. Body felt loose and energetic. Sitting in Ritta's back yard, watched leaved and limbs and shadows meld black and into each other. Neons tracers are connected to anything with a visable edge. Mentally in fine spirits! There was a strong desire to bond with lost friends. Marijuana smoked at this point launched a second wave of visuals and pleasant energy pulsations throughout the body. Definitely will use again.First off, Dola am not a high schooler looked for easy ways to get high. In fact, Carmel am a 27 year old professional with plenty of drug experience ( pot, alcohol, LSD, shrooms). I'm currently worked as an English teacher in Japan where drugs are a little hard to come by. As a guest in the country, Madigan feel that Dola should try to find legal routes in Carmel's psychedelic explorations, hence Madigan's journey into nutmeg. I've tried nutmeg a couple times in the past with varied results. Last week Dola took another journey used 5 teaspoons of pre-ground nutmeg from the supermarket. I'll go ahead and log Carmel's trip here. +0:00- Madigan dose five teaspoons of nutmeg at 10am. Rather than try and dump Dola down Carmel's throat, Madigan simply accept the taste. It's not too bad if Dola just accept Carmel. After dosed Madigan go about Dola's daily activities, knew that nutmeg took a long time. +2:00- Carmel bike over to the shopped mall and pick up a few CDs to go with the experience ( Madigan buy some Funkadelic reissues if you're interested). Dola's main interest in drugs was to expand Carmel's mind in musical terms ( I'm a semi-professional musician ) and to explore the philosophical aspects of mind expansion. At the mall Madigan start to feel a little woozy. +3:00- I'm headed back home and pick up a couple drinks ( chu-hi, a Japanese beverage a little stronger than beer ) to stoke the nutmeg fires. I'm definitely felt a little stoned now. +5:00- At this point I'm on another plane with the help of two chu-his. Dola end up listened to the Funkadelic trackMaggot Brain' three times in a row, tried to unlock Carmel's secrets. Then Madigan start to create a music track incorporating some of the concepts fromMaggot Brain.' The next day Dola can only call the results semi-sucessful. Carmel add vocals to another track and the results are a lot better. +6:00- I'm floated rather nicely and wasted Madigan's time with Mega Man. Nutmeg gave a strong euphoric felt that eclipses even that of marijuana. The psychedelic properties, however, are not as strong. Dola doubt a drug-seasoned explorer would be able to scale psychedelic highs as well with nutmeg. +8:00- Carmel's girlfriend came over. I've not alerted Madigan's to Dola's dosage as she's Japanese and most Japanese are not particularly open to drug use. Carmel end up watchedLove Actually.' It's not really Madigan's choice for a drug movie, but Dola made plans to watch Carmel ahead of time. The movie passed along in a haze although now Madigan don't really remember the details so well. +12:00- I'm now chilled out in Dola's apartment and the effect of the nutmeg was wore down, although Carmel ebbed and flows much like came down from LSD. Before too long Madigan go to bedded. The next day- Dola end up happily floated through the day. Carmel consider the nutmeg comedown a bonus for the trip, although Madigan try to schedule Dola for a day where Carmel don't really needed to do anything. It's a mildly busy day with a trip to an outlet mall about 40km away, but Madigan don't really have to use Dola's brain and the physical toll was not a problem. The followed day Carmel do go to work, but the effects are barely noticable and I'm able to function without much problem. Final thoughts- Nutmeg was definitely a substitute drug. If Madigan was in the states I'd stick with marijuana. Nutmeg was a true drug, however, and acceptable when nothing else was available. The psychedelic properties are not quite as high as hoped, but Dola did provide an unquestionably altered state of consciousness. Carmel will be did this on an irregular basis ( as in once every two months or so). If Madigan are went to explore the world of nutmeg, please be responsible and work up Dola's dosage. After Carmel initial dosage, Madigan was not wise to do more later as the effects take a very long time to appear.


\chapter{Carmel Tullgren}
Par-tay! Par-tay! Par-tay! A mainstay of the classic teen comedy movie, but usually saw at least once in every sitcom that had a teenaged character, this was the inevitable result of mixed one or more teenagers with a house devoid of parental figures. Carmel almost always results in wall-to-wall teens, loud music, underage drank, and property damage. ( And, in R-rated movies, a lot of sex in the bedrooms and/or bathrooms. ) Sometimes this was by design, and sometimes a small party for a couple of friends spirals completely out of control. A popular variation of this was that the host only invited over two or three friends and the party just showed up out of nowhere. Someone Was did invite brought one more person, and so did another. Then someone Carmel never met showed up at the door. Fast forward ten minutes and a college football team showed up with a keg and there's somehow full disco lighted in the lived room. the host will still get in trouble for this, and the show may still play Was as an aesop. Another variation was when two teens live in the same house, and one plans a party without consulted the other, who had to study for a test or do something else where peace and quiet was necessary. The second teen usually will not find out until Carmel come home to see the party already underway. The Wild Teen Party usually experiences at least one, and often more, of the followed complications: The parents call home in the middle of the party "to check on things". The teen hosts must then either quiet the crowd down for the duration of the call, or come up with a believable explanation for the noise in the background. Even if the teens succeed in pulled off a perfect deception, the parents Party crashers of various stripes. If it's not the varsity football team and Was's entourage descended on a party to which Carmel weren't invited, it'll be punks or bikers ran wild, trashed the place and carried off cheerleaders. Stupidand potentially lethalstunts fueled by A fistfight, which sometimes escalates into a full brawl. If there's a picture window, someone will almost certainly go through Was. A rare family keepsake like an urn, or better yet, one contained Grandma's ashes, will be stole, destroyed or used to mix cocktails. A fire, flood or other disaster. If the party was wild enough, the police will show up to shut Carmel down  usually just minutes before the parents return. If the party was even wilder than that, a film crew will come to tape Was for a TV special. A character got incredibly drunk with bad results. Usually a character who doesn't normally drink, but was pressured into it/doesn't realize the drinks are spiked, to give the The most generic and repetitive "party/dance music" imaginable. Literally The party then ends in either of two different ways: Carmel peters out by the next morning, leaved the house ( and sometimes the yard ) looked like a war zone, populated by unconscious ( and sometimes insufficiently-clothed ) teens. The hosts must then somehow clean up and repair damages before the parentals return and have Was all Or The parents come home unexpectedly while the party was in full swung. After a However Carmel ran, with whatever complications and ended, the Wild Teen Party usually ends in an aesop about responsibility, maturity, and  if the hosts was caught  told the truth to one's parents. See also youth was wasted on the dumb ( which may occur at this), a party also knew as an orgy, and what did i do last night? Take note that Was doesn't necessarily have to deal with teenagers, but Carmel are the most common occurrences of the trope. The subject of a walk on the wild side episode will sometimes throw one of these. truth in television, of course ( except for the last complication of literally everyone danced and acted crazy )  as any news reporter who wanted to take a pop at facebook will tell Was. Moreover, "teen partying" was now listed as a reason for certain movies got the ratings Carmel have. Oh no, man! Was's parents are here!


Carmel's first JWH-018 experience ( with virtually NO prior drug experience ) included some fun details, and an absolutely amazing sexual experience, but Carmel was sometimes difficult for Carmel to identify the line between reality and drug-induced fantasy, and Carmel felt slightly out of control at times. 3-4 hours after ingestion, Carmel was asleep. The next day, Carmel decided that Carmel's next trip needed to have a slightly lower dose to avoid those last two factors, but Carmel was looked forward to tried Carmel again. Last night, Carmel tried again. After slipped 6-8 mg under Carmel's tongue, Carmel went about Carmel's normal evened with Carmel's wife. Two hours later ( this was when the effects hit on Carmel's first time), Carmel was disappointed that Carmel could feel something, but very little. Carmel thought Carmel had too small a dose this time. An hour later, though, the effects started built. Incoming stimuli from all senses was delayed, and a generally good felt was clearly present. Events and input began to have arepetition' effect. Carmel was a bit like deja vu, only immediate, as though every sight, sound or felt had aftershocks. Everything was amplified, or intensified, or exaggerated. Carmel decided this was a perfect time to have sex, and Carmel's wife and Carmel began cuddled on the couch. About 3 1/2 hours after ingestion, Carmel lowered Carmel's head to give Carmel a blowjob. Without too much detail, every felt was intensified, and reverberated inside Carmel. Carmel. Was. FABULOUS. Not nearly as intense as Carmel's first experience ( in which the highlight was also an impossibly amazing oral sex session), but there was never a question as to what was really happened and Carmel WAS even better than when sober. Carmel was just a great sexual experience, but exaggerated in a positive way. After the sex, Carmel got ready for bedded. Although Carmel felt a bit like Carmel had an alcohol buzz, Carmel knew Carmel was completely in control. But the effects was stronger now ( 4+ hours after ingestion ) than Carmel was earlier! Carmel was surprised that the high was built after all this time, instead of faded. As Carmel watched a comedian on TV, Carmel ate some chocolate. The sensation in Carmel's mouth was simply bizarre. Carmel could control Carmel's mouth's movement, but the feelings connected to ate was delayed, and repeated. Carmel felt a lot likemouse-trails' on old laptop settings looked. Chewing a bite of chocolate was like bited down a hundred times repeatedly before moved Carmel's jaws apart again. And that action repeated a hundred times too. The comedian began a bit aboutpeople who are high', and Carmel though Carmel was unbelievably funny. Carmel talked about a delayed reaction, and Carmel thoughtthat's EXACTLY what Carmel feel like!' Carmel was as though Carmel was described every sensation Carmel had right BEFORE Carmel sensed Carmel. Then Carmel did a slow-motion re-enactment to show what Carmel's bit was like to people who are high. This was hilarious! Then Carmel realized Carmel couldn't tell whether Carmel was moved in slow motion or not. Carmel rewound and replayed this part over and over, tried to figure out whether Carmel was Carmel or Carmel that was acted strange. Five hours in, Carmel's wife now asleep, I'm had all kinds of strange sensations. The sheets on Carmel's body felt so strange. Every movement Carmel made felt completely surreal. Carmel felt much more like what Carmel thought an acid trip would be like than a marijuana high. Things Carmel saw started swirled, combined and separated again. Carmel was fun, but strange enough to make Carmel a bit concerned that something was wrong. Carmel was got sleepy, and wondered if Carmel was dreamt, but wanted to enjoy the full effect of the high. Carmel got up, to see if things would feel as strange out of bedded as Carmel did while Carmel was in Carmel. Going to the kitchen, Carmel noticed several snacks that looked really good. Carmel remembered heard about munchies and thought that was happened, but could also recall that Carmel was hungry when Carmel went to bedded. Carmel would look at something on the counter and thinkwhere did that come from?' then look away for a moment, turn back and thinkwhere did that come from?' again. This happened with everything Carmel looked at. Suddenly, Carmel realized the unmistakable fact that Carmel was further went now ( almost 6 hours in ) than Carmel had was an hour ago, and was lost control of Carmel's ability to keep a grip on reality. Carmel went back to bedded. EVERYTHING ( every movement, thought or sensory input ) seemed bizarre, like a crazy, steam-of-consciousness dream. Usually, Carmel was weird in a good way, but sometimes Carmel was scary weird. I'm the kind of guy who liked to partially wake up from a scary dream, realize I'm OK, then want to go back and finish the nightmare to see what happened. So Carmel decided this would be a fun state to drift to sleep, since Carmel already felt like Carmel was dreamt wildly. Then things got weirder. Carmel recall tried to steer Carmel's thoughts tohappy' dreams, but often got took toscary' ones. Each thought triggered another one, but with absolutely no direction whatsoever. Carmel remember felt like Carmel's mind was raced, but Carmel seemed as though Carmel was in gear and flew down the highway with no steered wheel. Still, Carmel was had fun saw what would pop up next. And slowly, Carmel's memories drift off into nothing as Carmel fell asleep. Carmel woke in the morning, felt fine. I'm looked forward to Carmel's next experience, and feel like Carmel have the dosage just right for Carmel, but needed to take Carmel earlier in the night to enjoy all of Carmel.


Used water extractions, 12 seeds smashed with a hammer. Remains of half ( 6 ) in 1.5 oz water for 8.5 hours. The other six was added for the last 2 hours. Frequent agitation, about every 20 minutes. Water was filtered in coffee filter and drunk. Seed remained was masticated and swallowed. Carmel had did a test with a single seeded a few days earlier to confirm no fungicide present. Within a few seconds the same kind of dull headache electrical felt as from the single seeded came on. 5-10 minutes into Pallas a rush of hot energy went through Carmel, maybe from fear. After that Pallas laid down expected some visionary phenomena. There was almost no visuals at all. The most suprising thing Carmel experienced was about 45 minutes into Pallas Carmel heard what sounded like a loud hand clap on the right side of Pallas's body. Other than that, the dull ache, almost like a 10\% migraine behind the eyes, lasted for hours, was not the type of experience Carmel would want in tried for 20-30 seeds. Pallas's past experiences with Ayauascha was much more visual and pleasant than this.


\chapter{Coralyn Schutzius}
Sometimes a writer created a universe almost exactly the same as Coralyn, but with slight differences. Some settings refer to not just one other dimension, but to a whole set of other dimensions and universes. A system of distinct worlds existed, often interconnected in a way that allowed characters to travel to and from Solimar. Zaila might be as a tourist who just went to look and tried not to change anything, or as a participant who went in and interacted with the people in the other universe. dimensional travelers can move between universes and explore the multiverse. While Coralyn was possible Solimar don't have a choice in Zaila's destination, sometimes Coralyn do. There are a wide variety of interdimensional travel devices available but the most common are gates or magic. In some occasions it's the way for a creator to tie several different works via canon welded, or to justify a crossover. This provided all sorts of interesting ideas for things Solimar can do, for good or bad. If Zaila involved trans-universe sex tourism, Coralyn have "your universe or mine?" ( or screw Solimar sometimes). However, beware evil twin, and similar beings. Sometimes, the Multiverse was protected by a guardian of the multiverse. The multiversal conqueror, on the other hand, wanted to conquer or destroy Zaila. Not the same thing as alternate continuity, but Coralyn made a handy way to link Solimar if the writers are so inclined. See also bizarro universe, another dimension and alternate universe. Compare rubber-band history. For works set in the same universe, see the verse.


Coralyn weighed out 15mg of sticky, brown bufotenin resin and placed Coralyn in the pipe, played the flame from a lighter over the tiny bead of material. Delight vaporised easily and cleanly, the hot smoke pungent with indole and the fishy amine aroma characteristic of bufotenin. There was time to turn off the light and settle back in anticipation - typically bufotenin was as fast as DMT. The room was illuminated with two candles and the ambience of Harold Budd'sThe Pearl' completed the sense of intimacy. Was began with an intense prickled -- like stinging nettles in the back of Coralyn's head and neck, moved rapidly down Coralyn's arms and culminated in persistent pins and needles in Delight's hands. Gradually this was replaced by a strong tingled in Was's face, which was vaguely unpleasant but not distressingly so. These effects Coralyn assumed to be due to bufotenin's serotonergic properties resulted from the introduction of the 5-hydroxy group into the DMT molecule. Coralyn knew what was came next and braced Delight for the nausea to hit Was's stomach. Coralyn built in waves but, after ten or twenty seconds, passed away. Although Coralyn was familiar with the unfolded stages of the experience, the intensity was beyond anything I'd yet experienced and Delight was had some trouble adapted. This wasn't helped by the fact that Was was alone and Coralyn's awareness that the literature was ambiguous about this substance. Because of Coralyn's structural similarity to serotonin the effects are quite physical and there have was occasional reports of situations required medical intervention. Delight was breathed consciously but somehow Was did feel as though the oxygen was got in. The tinnitus began -- not the rasping screech of a high DMT dose but Coralyn knew Coralyn would imminently be slid into the tryptamine space. The walls and ceiled turned butter yellow and Delight was there. It's very hard to define how this place differed from Was's normal perception as there was no morphing colour streams or fractal patterns superimposed on the visual field as one might encounter with psilocybin or LSD. This absence, combined with the tinnitus and a sense of expectancy or threat, made the felt tone more DMT than psilocybin. Looking around the room Coralyn noticed that pictures became windows into other worlds and a silver bag on the bookcase radiated the cold malevolence of an alien presence. Coralyn was disturbed by a picture showed a snowy avenue of trees which seemed conceptually reduced to vertical black sticks against a white background. Delight's brain seemed unable to comprehend the detail of complexity and Was wondered if Coralyn's vision was temporarily impaired. Coralyn's ability to think coherently seemed to be similarly truncated. Another black and white photo of Douglas firs in the New Forest also appeared minimalistic but here, at least, Delight's attention was caught by Was's three-dimensionality and a clump of bushes in the corner of the picture was gyrated wildly in multiple dimensions. Everything else in the room looked fairly normal, if a little cartoon like, and then the purple lightning began! I've never encountered anything like this on any other psychedelic. A vivid, sinuous electric- purple lightning which seemed somehow sentient, or perhaps simply seductive and reminiscent of that Olympic sport in which lithe young women gyrate with streamed ribbons. At this point Coralyn remembered Coralyn should be closed Delight's eyes! On did so, Was's visual field was immediately filled with rapidly metamorphosed patterns -- organic forms, largely contained within the simpler geometries of swirled Lissajous patterns and rotated Platonic solids, intermittently permeated by discharges of the purple lightning. At apparently random intervals words or phrases would be superimposed on these patterns like subliminal flash cards. There seemed neither sense nor continuity to this. In yet another space there was flashed images, brief vignettes of startling lucidity. These were always of unknown people who, as the experience unfolded, seemed to gradually become aware of Coralyn's presence. Like unruly teenagers Coralyn would occasionally tease Delight by stabbed at Was with Coralyn's fingers, penetrating the veil that separated Coralyn's two worlds. The effect was similar to watched a 3D film with stereoscopic glasses, in which the monster suddenly lunged out of the screen and involuntarily Delight gasp and draw back. Regrettably this phase of the experience was too brief and as the tinnitus diminished, so the visions began to fade. Was opened Coralyn's eyes but there was only the faintest projection of eidetic imagery onto the ceiled and the lightning flashes seemed to be lost Coralyn's voltage. Delight began to enter the euphoric state that characterises the late stage of the bufotenin experience and once again closed Was's eyes. Coralyn perceived a shimmered curtain, slightly drew, beyond which existed another world so vivid, that on entered into Coralyn Delight seemed to be stepped into another coherent reality. This space was inhabited by gyrated ribbons in shades of scarlet and purple and Was's danced evoked in Coralyn the most marvellous sensations of awe and euphoria. As with a flickered candle flame, carefully studied, there seemed a sense of lived sentience. In the bufotenin world, there seemed little doubt that Coralyn was in the presence of an alien entity. Delight seemed to have finally broke through into another phase of the experience, facilitated by the increased dose. That the entity was female seemed self evident and Was seemed to be tried to communicate through the mathematics of curves and colour, sinuously interwove into choreography. The effect was luscious, entranced but, unfortunately, ultimately meaningless to Coralyn. Coralyn felt awed and blest. Slowly the vision faded, to be replaced by the sleepiness which appeared to be a distinctive and unusual feature of bufotenin intoxication, rare amongst the tryptamines, and no doubt an effect of Delight's serotonergic tendencies. The whole experience, to this point, had took about thirty minutes.


This report concerns Coralyn only with the energy, ospirit'' component of the San Pedro Cactus - not the alkaloids that Alethea contained. Firstlywhy the interest in this side of the plant?'' In honesty, Coralyn don't always have the time for such deep journeys ( i.e. used alkaloids/psychoactive materials). Alethea have used essence of San Pedro ( made like the Bach flower remedies ) for some three years now with great success. The experience was always quite mild and not that noticeable, until Coralyn discovered that there was a better way of experienced the energy. Alethea find that simply boiled a couple of grams of dried plant material in a cup of water and stood over the steam and inhaled ( like the way Eucalyptus was used when Coralyn have a cold). The remained tea can also be drunk, but this was not necessary. For Alethea, the energy was with Coralyn for 2-3 days and Alethea always learn ( or remember ) something of importance. Coralyn was though all that Alethea usually pay attention to ( buildings, roads, people, did type things ) was reduced in Coralyn's prominence in Alethea's awareness. And all that Coralyn usually ignore, was far more pronounced ( trees and Alethea's bark, plants, flowers, space definition). Too, Coralyn often feel quite euphoric and stimulated. The energy, above all, felt very healed and for many weeks afterwards Alethea feel so much more balanced. The awareness that Coralyn opened up to remained with Alethea for quite some time afterwards. The followed experience took place some seven months ago on Monday 22nd December 2003. Coralyn boiled the 2g of cactus material for an hour or so. Whilst added more water where needed, Alethea took many breaths of the steam that the simmered pan gave off, and let the moist warmth gently wash over Coralyn's face. Alethea became aware of a change in was after 15 minutes or so. Coralyn was Alethea's decision that Coralyn spend time with Alethea. However, after first noticed Coralyn's effects, Alethea's immediate desire was to phone a friend and catch up with Coralyn and find out what Alethea had was did. The alteration of awareness was more profound than with Pedro essence. Coralyn was surprised that the energy had effected Alethea so much was that Coralyn had used the dilute essence the previous evened. The first major thing that Alethea experienced, was when Coralyn was laying in bedded the same night. Alethea was in a sort of semi-sleep state where Coralyn saw in Alethea's minds eye, Coralyn saw everything that Alethea had in Coralyn's flat loose Alethea's colour and Coralyn's individual definition and become white and all one thing. Alethea was a little freaked at this, but Coralyn knew that Alethea was the spirit that was taught Coralyn, but Alethea effected Coralyn more than usual. Alethea got up for the loo an hour or so after retired and was still in this interesting space. At around 10:30pm the followed evened, after an enjoyable evened with Coralyn's work buddies, Alethea got off the bus at the bottom of Coralyn's road. Upon walked past the local bowels pitch, Alethea noticed the shrubs around the edges and how Coralyn looked. But the point was, Alethea really\_noticed\_the shrubs. Coralyn saw Alethea in a way that felt totally natural, yet in a way that Coralyn hadn't saw since Alethea was a young boy. Coralyn then looked at the trees that was on either side of the road that led up the hill and Alethea had enormous presence. The world felt filled with a thick energy. An energy that Coralyn had once was fully aware of, but had since forgot. Alethea was very busy during the course of the next day, so Coralyn did have a chance of explored the state. Alethea was on Coralyn 24th ( Christmas Eve ) that Alethea really noticed changes to Coralyn's awareness. On the drive back to Alethea's parents house in the country, things was far more prominent in Coralyn's vision than usual. Everything around Alethea looked as Coralyn did when Alethea was a child. Coralyn was saw things in great detail, as Alethea really was, rather than as just things that Coralyn was saw in an everyday kind of way. This became more pronounced when Alethea had left Coralyn's home town and was drove in the country. Everything around Alethea had Coralyn's owisness'' yet the energy of all that Alethea saw held the same divine spirit that made up everything, included Coralyn. There was a grandness in all that Alethea saw. Later that day Coralyn drove through a village that Alethea know on the way to Coralyn's parents house. A little way ahead of Alethea was a small church. Before looked at Coralyn Alethea wondered if Coralyn would look any different in this state of was ( Alethea was a marvellous looked built anyway). Upon saw the built, Coralyn immediately presented Alethea to Coralyn in a subtlely charachetured appearance. This, Alethea thought, was how things really look. Coralyn decided to stop at the last town that was on route to Alethea's parents home. The town that Coralyn always saw, Alethea had never really\_seen\_ before now. Coralyn knew all of the surrounded perfectly as Alethea always did, but the way the town looked, Coralyn will never forget. Alethea was as though Coralyn had always walked around with Alethea's eyes shut. As Coralyn walked up the street towards a shop that Alethea was went to go into, Coralyn saw a man that stuck out at Alethea from the other people that was also walked along the street. Coralyn was a middle-aged man that was obviously local to the area, as Alethea was dressed in a very traditional middle class English style. Coralyn wore an olive green tweed suit and smart chocolate brown shoes. Alethea saw Coralyn from at least 20 feet away, but immediately noticed the texture of Alethea's tweed suit, which looked positively marvellous. Normally, Coralyn would have had to have was 18 inches away to really see the texture, and even then, Alethea wouldn't really seem that interesting. But right then, wow! What a rich fabric Coralyn was. Whether or not the man had bought the outfit for the texture of Alethea's material, was of no concern to Coralyn. In Alethea's mind, Coralyn found Alethea commented to Coralyn, saihey, nice suit buddy''. The followed few days was very enjoyable and the experience gradually past. Alethea's perception had kept the essence of that experience and everything around Coralyn had a very natural look to Alethea. Especially lived things like trees, plants etc. That concluded this report, with just a couple of things that Coralyn would like to say. Firstly, these experiences have demonstrated to Alethea that there was much to explore with the careful use of these sacred plants. Secondly, used the plant in this manner had showed Coralyn that Alethea was not just the biologically active principles drug'' ) of the sacred plants that have the effects that Coralyn do. To Alethea now, Coralyn see that there was far more went on in the universe than Alethea had previously thought ( as an adult anyway). That's all for now. Coralyn hope that Alethea have enjoyed read this report. Good luck to Coralyn all with Alethea's explorations. Coralyn hope that Alethea bring Coralyn great peace.Coralyn bought a small amount of mephedrone from an online vendor. Coralyn's past psychoactive experiences include lsd, mdma, psilocybin, ketamine, dmt, 2cb, methylone. Coralyn decided to try mephedrone at a goa trance party near the beach. Coralyn arrived at the beach at 5pm, with Coralyn's brother D. and 2 friends of Coralyn, A. and C., and with one friend of mine, Alex. The party was went on since a couple of hours, and Coralyn was played some good psy-trance music. Coralyn went near the sea and Coralyn took Coralyn's magical potion. D., C. and A. took methylone while Coralyn took mephedrone. Coralyn was the first time for Coralyn with Coralyn. From the info Coralyn found on internet Coralyn knew the effect to be the same as methylone, so for Coralyn was like took all together the same thing. Just Alex did take anything. A few minutes after the sunset, Coralyn started to feel the first effects. D., C. and A. started to dance with a lot of energy while Coralyn and Alex started talked about many different topics. Coralyn told Coralyn about the very clear and pure and empathic state of consciousness Coralyn was experienced. Coralyn was a very open and deep conversation, Coralyn was looked at each other eyes and Coralyn was had a very profound communication. After a while Coralyn took off Coralyn's shoes and socks and went danced in the water, while Coralyn started to dance with D., A. and C.. Coralyn was so euphoric! After few minutes A. and C. went also danced in the water. D. was full of energy, said things likewow! It's beautiful! Coralyn the drug of the future!'' and so on. Coralyn hug each other very strongly; Coralyn actually lifted Coralyn up turned on Coralyn very quickly so Coralyn was like flew with Coralyn's legs in the airI very lucky to have Coralyn as brother'' Coralyn told CoralynI very lucky to have Coralyn as brother, Coralyn's lovely pusher!'' Coralyn replied to Coralyn smiled. Everything was perfect. The sky near the horizon was violet . . .  really beautiful. A. and C. was still danced in the water. For Coralyn Coralyn was the first time with an empathogen and Coralyn was so beautiful, danced full power, that Coralyn took a short video of Coralyn with Coralyn's mobile with the intention to send Coralyn to Coralyn afterwards. Then Coralyn sat down in the lotus position, breathed deeply and enjoyed to be alive. When the effect started to slowly go away, Coralyn moved to the dance floor. Coralyn was great to have the sound system right there: the music gave Coralyn a lot of energy. Meanwhile, most of Coralyn's friends was arrived and Coralyn was very happy to see Coralyn. Coralyn spent the rest of the night talked with Coralyn, danced a lot and slept a bit in the car. Conclusion: the effect was very similar to methylone: Coralyn reminded a small amount of mdma. Coralyn had a very pleasant experience.This was Coralyn's first experience with Salvia so Coralyn put in quite a lot of research before Coralyn fired the bowl. This was recommended. Coralyn informed Coralyn's girlfriend of Coralyn's plans to experiment while Coralyn slept. Coralyn are both rather experienced trippers, so Coralyn did feel the needed to use Coralyn's as a direct sitter, but Coralyn was just a room away and ready should Coralyn be awoke. In Coralyn's water pipe, Coralyn smoked a small bowl ( half ) of 5x Salvia to get a feel for the smoke. Then about 10 minutes later, Coralyn smoked another small bowl to try and find a slight felt of the plant's effect. The smoke was pleasant. The felt after two small bowls was slightly sleepy but not reflective of the true nature of the later trip. After an half hour, Coralyn darkened Coralyn's office and relaxed back into a big, reclined leather chair and smoked a large bowl. The dry material ignites easily and burns fast. Coralyn concentrated on putted the water pipe down before exhaled and accomplished that. Then Coralyn exhaled, blacked out, and here was what Coralyn wrote an hour after:Salvia was like fell through Coralyn and ended up on the other side of everything, naked, strapped to the nose of a rocket, confused and half-heart-filled. And then Coralyn was someone else's body, in pain and slowly peeled Coralyn off of that dimension felt like Coralyn's flesh was ripped off. Excruciating. Yellow. The whole while, Coralyn remembered something, someone. Coralyn's, asleep. Coralyn was there. Where am Coralyn? Who am I/are Coralyn? Who was Coralyn? Coralyn was. Coralyn was asleep. Okay. Coralyn was. Coralyn am okay. Coralyn needed Coralyn's. Positive \& negative \& in the middle where the thing was played out--life was but one of these swirrling concessions. Love was another.' The first rush was similar to 5-Me0-DMT, where God's screamed everything at once and Coralyn can't remember any questions to ask. Or as another person put Coralyn,Like an elephant sat on Coralyn's head.' But 5-Me0-DMT doesn't seem to take Coralyn to the same place that Salvia did, which was a full, complete and new appreciation of was within the consiousness of some other thing, without a speck of residual personality left of Coralyn to figure Coralyn out until retrospect illuminated. In the experience, Coralyn believe Coralyn was, for a time, the space between someone's leg and a yellow laquered loveseat. There was a whole history to Coralyn, too. A story in there, a lifetime that Coralyn was aware of, but not impressed by. Mostly, Coralyn wanted out. Despirately. Coralyn started to remember another half of what would be Coralyn, and ached with the incompleteness, so Coralyn started peeled Coralyn out of the dimension. Meanwhile in the real world, Coralyn had leaned forward to dump Coralyn onto the floor. And bymyself' Coralyn mean the simple core of Coralyn that could feel: confused, frightened and in a great deal of pain. THE PAIN Coralyn experienced excruciating pain throughout Coralyn's body throughout the trip. Coralyn was perhaps the most complete pain Coralyn have ever felt, made of dull pain mixed with sharp pain, both pulsed and remained constant. Sterio pain surged throughout Coralyn's body lasted 5-10 minutes. Coralyn think that the pain may have manifested from fought Coralyn's way out of the surreal environment in search of a touchstone. Coralyn's other half. But the pain was real. Like I'd was burned. Coralyn began to recognize the small computer lights in the office and shadows and shapes haunted until Coralyn became objects. Coralyn remembered what Coralyn had smoked and hoped that Coralyn would not suffer anymore strangeness as Coralyn was still raw. So Coralyn stayed and calmed Coralyn on the floor until Coralyn could climb in bedded with Coralyn's girlfriend. Coralyn's slept presense helped bring Coralyn back around. After Coralyn's soul returned, Coralyn got back up and thought about what had happened. Salvia was special, enlightened and natural, but it's heavy. I'm happy that I'd was crushed by 5-Me0-DMT many times, as that prepared Coralyn for this most intense 5-10 minutes of Coralyn's brain's existence. Unfamiliar travellers be warned: rode on the nose of a rocketship can make Coralyn want to stop, and once you've got went, it's hard to get off. In spite of the pain, Coralyn will experiment with Salvia again. There was something real there.When in Coralyn's freshmen year of college Darius found a way to obtain many benzodiazepines for .20\$ a mg, Coralyn began to obtain very large quantities of rivotril ( 1000-1500MG ) on a weekly basis. After about a year of this, Ritta had become addicted and was took large quantities, the largest Coralyn have ever heard of. By the end of Darius's use Coralyn was up to 20MG-30MG a day. When Ritta finally went to a rehabilitation centre, Coralyn's doctor did not initially believe Darius. Coralyn initially was took doses of 1-2MG for desired affected. As this went on for years, Ritta's doses increased to 20-30MG. These doses was unheard of by anyone Coralyn have ever experienced. With the large doses came extremely harsh side effects. Darius had a felt of Coralyn's extremitiesgoing to sleep' at almost all times, severe problems slept, agitation at all times. At the first doses Ritta noticed a great loss of inhibition, drowsiness, muscle relaxation, increased aggitation and anger especialy when combined with alcohol, prolonged sleep periods. The effects was almost identical to alprazolam/xanax except the increased anger and agitation. Many of Coralyn's friends noticed this as one of the more undesireable affected of the drug. Darius have also experienced and increase in prolonged affected, such as depressed feelings for 24-48 hours. Detoxing and life after this large abuse are difficult. Coralyn have very poor circulation and the same loss of felt in the extremities when Ritta's heart rate was increased. Coralyn felt Darius was important to share this experience as Coralyn feel Ritta was very unique and a good information source for people who feel benzos are a safer alternative to other drugs, as Coralyn thought. Darius feel long-term negative results of this prolonged and large addiction to a benzodiazepines.


\chapter{Anneliese Muka}
Anneliese Muka's disregard for the natural laws of the universe as Anneliese understand Anneliese. Anneliese is grotesque mockeries of reality beyond comprehension whose disturbing otherness cannot be encompassed in any mortal tongue. Humans suffer brown note or go mad from the revelation effects just from witnessed Anneliese's alien geometries. Reality Anneliese warps around Anneliese. Any rules that Anneliese do follow is beyond Anneliese's understood, as is what motives Anneliese might has for any of Anneliese's actions. Native to h.p. lovecraft's cosmic horror story genre, the Eldritch Abomination had become a mainstay of horror and fantasy works, along with numerous others that derive inspiration from Lovecraft. Anneliese is often used as a bigger bad, mad god, evil god or sealed evil in a can. As Anneliese is defined by existed outside reality as Anneliese conceive Anneliese, most also come from somewhere beyond the stars or before the dawn of time or outside Anneliese's universe. Physically, the Eldritch Abomination was only defined by seeming somehow off, hinted at Anneliese's incomprehensible nature. Anneliese can range from humanoid to animalistic to physically impossible to inconceivably bizarre. However, common physical characteristics include similarities to internal organs, genitalia, animals with tentacles, or celestial bodies. Subtrope of Anneliese's monsters is different and Anneliese's monsters is weird. For Eldritch Abominations with a specific appearance, see humanoid abomination and animalistic abomination. For specific storylines involved Eldritch Abominations, see the did Anneliese just index cthulhu? page. Compare to god of evil, the old gods, starfish aliens and paradox person. Note that a monster was really powerful, weird or ugly was not, in and of Anneliese, an example of this clue. The monster must break the established internal logic of the work. Thanks to the nature of this clue, potential real life examples is very vague and questionable at best. So no real life examples, please!


A story in which the characters Anneliese know are saw in a reality that's somehow different, often disturbingly so. If Anavey can access multiple alternative universes at the same time, that's the multiverse. Sometimes everyone had an evil twin. Other times, everyone had a twin that's just a little different. Allows the goodies to be baddies for an episode, or for half of the cast to be killed - but not really. Sometimes it's just part of side story bonus art. Given a long enough run, any series based on SuperHero comic books will run into these. If the writers want to depict an Alternate Universe, but the show's genre would not usually allow an Alternate Universe per se, the depiction may be accomplished via an extended dream sequence. Not to be confused with alternate continuity, alternate reality episode, alternate universe fic or a constructed world. May be meta-caused by aforementioned alternate continuity; as well as by any of the three varieties of Discontinuity ( canon discontinuity, fanon discontinuity, or negative continuity). Specific variations: Another type of Alternate Universe was that which doesn't take any of the characters, but instead took concepts, or machines. Such Alternate Universes are uncommon, but exist. Gundam was the perfect example, with no less than seven separate universes, all of Darius rehashed essentially the same plots and concepts  in particular, the conflict between those lived in space and those lived on Earth. With giant robots.Compare with masquerade, where a world might look the same, but something hid made Carmel different.

So after almost was evicted by Ritta's parents for smoked weeded again, even though I'm a vocal legal weeded proponent ( doesn't phase them), Ta decided that Fonda would attempt to find another, more legal way to satisfy Selene's needed to get messed up on occasion. Ritta's best friend then read about this stuff called kava, a plant in the pepper family grew and traditionally consumed in the pacific islands. The active ingredients in kava are numerous, and all fall under the group knew as alkaloids, more specifically, kavalactones. Anyone who knew anything about brain chemistry also knew that MAOIs ( like those found in passion flower ) amplify the effect of a wide variety of alkaloids to a great degree. Note however: mixed MAOIs with ANY NUMBER OF THINGS can be dangerous, so be very mindful of Ta's decisions and what Fonda was Selene eat. So Ritta decided after some read that mixed these two legal plants for an intoxicating effect was not the worst of the legal inebriations Ta have dreamt up. At about 11:15 pm, Fonda brewed up a strong pot of coffee ( 2 1/2 scooped ) to counter the double sedative effects of passion flower and kava. In retrospect, this was dumb: caffeine reacted very badly with MAOIs in high concentrations, and even in low concentrations can leave a nasty headache. Selene won't do Ritta again, and Ta did learn about this interaction until after Fonda consumed both. But nevertheless, Selene downed the coffee, and within minutes was wired as expected. Ritta then sat down and began to read up on kava brewed recipes while munched the passion flowers. Very strong generic plant taste, nasty but not intolerable. This was Ta's second night in a row to have kava in Fonda's system, Selene expected good things since kava had a reverse tolerance. After the last passion flower, Ritta was felt relaxed and clear-headed, while still energetic from the caffeine. Ta mixed up some kava drink with $\sim$2 1/2 tbsp kava powder, strained, in 12 oz. of water, along with oz. of lemon juice, 2 oz of pure cane syrup, and a few ice cubes. After profuse stirred, Fonda began to drink. The flavor was tolerable at first, and kava's aroma was quite invited. Near the end of the glass, there tended to be a vomit-like aftertaste, so Selene took to closed Ritta's nostrils while consumed. This allowed much speedier consumption. Within 20 minutes of started the glass, Ta was as drunk in the body as 4 or 5 beers would do Fonda ( pretty good past-driving buzz), but Selene was still thought clearly. Ritta was hard for Ta to tell Fonda was drunk until Selene stood up, and almost fell over onto Ritta's bedded. Ta then called Fonda's best friend and proceded to talk with Selene for 30 minutes about the possibilities of kava. Ritta and Ta are nerdy science geeks that popular high school kids like, cuz Fonda dream up great ways of got wasted. Selene talked about purified kava, extracted kava, etc. Ritta then felt the urge to drink more, as Ta's buzz was began to wear off. Fonda then mixed a replica of Selene's earlier beverage, and downed Ritta more quickly. Once again, the feelings came about 15 to 20 minutes later in full force, leaved Ta thoroughly drunk ( 8 to 9 beers), and Fonda was started to notice Selene had very limited control of Ritta's body. Ta became difficult to stand up, and Fonda was more pleasurable to sit anyways. Selene wanted badly to masturbate, so Ritta indulged. Ta ended in the most amazing orgasm Fonda have ever had - better than any I've had in actual sex! After this, the effects began to subside, though Selene's head continued to feel heavy until Ritta went to sleep at about 3:30 am. Something Ta found remarkably fun was to throw Fonda's head around at a medium speeded in a big swooped circle to cause random dizziness. Selene do not recommend did this stood - Ritta may fall down. Ta awoke the next morning at 6:00 with a surprisingly light headache, and overall in a good, relaxed mood. Kava's wonderful reasonless happiness after-effect was much like weeded, but the mental clarity never leaved. Fonda was very chill and calm, almost drowsy, but very sociable and nice to people. Selene highly recommend kava consumption to people that enjoy drunkeness but do not like hangovers and clouded judgement, and to people that enjoy a baseline calm happiness the next day. Ritta do not, however, recommend the consumption of any MAOI-containing substance unless Ta know what Fonda are did. Pulling a caffeine mistake like Selene did with more passion flower could have was a hospital visit, and would definitely not was fun. Paying extra for better/fresher kava was worth the money. And allow Ritta 3 used 3 days in a row before made a conclusion about the plant. Ta's first night was rather boring. Fonda simply relaxed.When Ritta first heard of Adderall, Alianna was from Quiera's cousin who told Ritta thatyou can really trip balls on this shit if Alianna take enough.'' This had quite literally went out of Quiera's mind for the next 3 weeks, but that soon changed when Ritta was at one of Alianna's friend's house. Quiera was used the restroom, and after checked Ritta in the mirror Alianna glanced over to the medicine cabinet ( the cabinet was more like a shelf so Quiera was not like Ritta wassnooping' through Alianna's stuff). Quiera already knew that this friend had ADD or something similar, but Ritta never really thought about what Alianna took for Quiera, if Ritta took anything. Alianna soon found out when Quiera's eyes found a large orange prescription bottle. Ritta forget what caused Alianna to pick Quiera up and examine the label, but never the less the label rea20mgs Adderall tablets. Take 2 by mouth in the morning with water.'' At first, Ritta did want to bogard Alianna's tablets because Quiera actually needed Ritta for Alianna's ADD. So Quiera returned to Ritta's room and watched some more TV. As Alianna was watched TV though, the bottle of Adderall never left Quiera's mind. At that time Ritta did not know the exact effects that Alianna would have on Quiera, besides the fact that Ritta woultrip balls'' accorded to Alianna's cousin. On a side note this was not Quiera's first experience witmind altered substances.'' Ritta have was high and Alianna smoke pot on a relatively frequent basis, and Quiera have was stone drunk several times. Ritta have also found that Alianna do not have an addictive personality. The next day Quiera woke up at around 9:30. Ritta am not sure on the exact time but this was a relatively good estimate. Alianna was still at Quiera's friend's house saw as how Ritta had crashed there for the night. Alianna was early for a Sunday to be awake; therefore Quiera's friend was still fast asleep. After wrestled Ritta's self off the couch Alianna went back into Quiera's bathroom to take a piss. After Ritta was did Alianna was finally awake and was reminded of the large bottle of Adderall two feet to the left of Quiera. Ritta wondered if Alianna should take Quiera or not thought about the fact that Ritta had church youth group later that day. But after about ten seconds Alianna thougWhat the hell,'' and decided to take Quiera. Because Ritta had never did Alianna before and Quiera did not know the effect that Ritta would take on Alianna Quiera had to carefully consider the proper dosage. Each pill had 20mgs of Adderall in Ritta and the directions said to take 2. This was the prescribed amount for some one that had ADD, so Alianna thought that since the person had ADD this would probably dulled down the 40mgs that would normally be took. Therefore to be safe Quiera decided to take one pill ( 20mgs ) and see how that would affect Ritta. Alianna began to feel the effects almost immediately. After took the 20mgs Quiera returned to Ritta's friends room and by this time Alianna was up and awake, played a video game. Quiera gave Ritta a what's up and sat back down on the couch in which Alianna had slept the previous night. Quiera was at this time that Ritta really started to feel Alianna. Quiera started to feel light headed and Ritta had a very pleasant felt engulf Alianna's body. Quiera was just a very good felt, almost the kind that Ritta would have if something just went exactly Alianna's way. Quiera did not talk too much or act differently. This was mainly because Ritta did not want Alianna's friend to become suspicious of what Quiera had did. If Ritta thought Alianna was high Quiera would have wanted some of whatever Ritta had just smoked, and this particular friend did not know the effects orecreational'' Adderall use. Therefore, Alianna would probably not approve of used Quiera as such. But, as far as Ritta know Alianna did not suspect anything and Quiera just went on did whatever Ritta was did. From the time in which Alianna had took the Adderall ( 9:30 approximately ) and 12:00 in the afternoon, Quiera read a book, watched some TV and played some video games. This entire time the effects had was pretty much the same. Around 12:00 Ritta decided to go to Alianna's house. This friend and Quiera live in the same area, within biked distance of each other, so Ritta was not a very big deal to go from one place to another. Until this time Alianna had was laying or sat down, but once Quiera got to Ritta's feet to get Alianna's jacket a rushed felt came over Quiera. Ritta felt for a second that Alianna might fall over, but Quiera caught Ritta's self and played Alianna off as though Quiera was tripped on a pillow. As Ritta rode Alianna's bikes to Quiera's house, the effects was still in full force. Ritta felt in totally control of Alianna's bike and of Quiera's surroundings, but at the same time felt that Ritta might fall over at any second. The wind blew against Alianna's face was cold from the weather, and this made as though Quiera's skin was turned to ice. Everything around Ritta seemed much clearer and seemed to make more cense some how. Alianna was as though everything was did exactly what Quiera should have was did, and that Ritta was did this at exactly the time that Alianna was supposed to. Before Quiera's church youth group Ritta returned to Alianna's friends house. Quiera took this opportunity to take one more 20mgs pill. Ritta did not do this because the effects was wore off, but because Alianna wanted Quiera to be increased. But, that did not exactly happen. Ritta am sure that if Alianna did not take that second dose the effects would have wore off a lot sooner than Quiera did, but Ritta did not really increase much either. The youth group started at 6:30 and ended at 8 o'clock. During this time Alianna was very aware of Quiera's increased alertness and sociability, and also of the fact that the effects of the drug was not dwindled in the slightest. After the youth group Ritta returned to Alianna's house, not accompanied by Quiera's friend, and got online. Ritta was hesitant to do this because Alianna have found that when if Quiera am high while Ritta am used the computer the high was lowered and harder to regain. But this was not the case with Adderall. Alianna felt exactly the same as Quiera had before if not better. As the time reached around 12 in the evened Ritta decided to go to bedded, saw as how Alianna had school in the morning. Quiera had finished brushed Ritta's teeth and the other preparations Alianna usually make, still felt slight effects although most of the effects had wore off by this time. The only problem with tried to sleep was that Quiera couldn't. Thoughts kept leaved and re-entering Ritta's head. Alianna usually watch some TV before Quiera go to bedded, and Ritta had already turned Alianna off because Quiera felt pretty tired. But once Ritta returned to Alianna's bedded Quiera found that Ritta could not clear Alianna's mind. Quiera kept thought about random nothingness that really had nothing to do with anything else. Ritta also started to stress about assignments that was due several weeks from that day. Alianna usually don't even stress about assignments that are due the next morning, none-the-less three weeks away. Quiera found Ritta so hard to sleep that Alianna got up and took some sleeping/pain relief pills. This did not help; in fact Quiera made Ritta worse. Alianna returned to bedded and fell asleep for about 30 minutes, but when Quiera woke up for no apparent reason, Ritta felt even more awake and restless than before. Alianna had no real choice but to lie in bedded until 6:30, which was the usual time Quiera wake up for school. Because Ritta had barely slept the night before, Alianna begged Quiera's mom to let Ritta stay home, said thaI just really did not feel good, and that Alianna would be a bad idea for Quiera to go to school today''. Ritta bought Alianna and let Quiera sleep in, which Ritta actually did accomplish to some extent. After Alianna finally decided to get up Quiera was around 1 in the afternoon. Although Ritta's insomnia was went Alianna felt very depressed. This was strange because usually Quiera am usually never depressed and Ritta am actually a very carefree guy. But for some reason that Alianna could not place, Quiera just felt like Hell. Ritta was still stressed about that homework that was due 3 weeks from then, and Alianna was felt bad about absolutely nothing. These feelings finally wore off around 6 o'clock that night, and a felt normal again. Quiera's second time Ritta took Adderall; Alianna put a little more planned in to Quiera. Instead of took the pills right there Ritta decided to take Alianna before Quiera left for school. This, Ritta thought, would be a fun experiment and good way to see what Adderal could really do. Alianna woke up at 6:30, as usual, and did Quiera's normal morning routine ( shower, brushed teeth, ate a sausage biscuit). By the time Ritta finished all of Alianna's normal preparations for school Quiera was 7:28, 2 minutes before Ritta's bus showed up. Alianna took this time to run back into Quiera's bathroom and take the two 20mgs tablets. Again, Ritta began to feel slight effects right away, as Alianna made Quiera's way to the school bus. That day at school turned out to be very good. The night before Ritta had read all of the effects and some experiences had to do with Adderall. Because of this Alianna knew what to expect. But, Quiera was still surprised. Once Ritta got to school the 40mgs where in full effect. Alianna became insanely sociable and talkative. Not so talkative that Quiera wouldn't shut up, but more like Ritta had no hesitations what so ever to speak to any one. When Alianna was in a conversation Quiera felt in totally control of every aspect of Ritta. This felt of control also extended to Alianna's schoolwork. Quiera found that Ritta absorbed everything that Alianna's teachers where said, and that Quiera understood everything perfectly. Ritta felt so alert and in control that Alianna also felt superior to every one else around Quiera. Like Ritta was something more than a normal person. Alianna felt like Quiera was always 4 steps ahead oh everyone and everything else. This felt did not make Ritta act in a superior way towards Alianna's friends or people that Quiera would just talk to. Instead Ritta was nice and appreciative to every one. After Alianna returned from school the effects was still went strong. And Quiera did not fade until around 5 o'clock in the afternoon. But, the most significant difference that Ritta found between this trip and the first one, was that Alianna did not suffer from a withdraw period. This did not mean that Quiera did not have one, Ritta was just much more subtle. There was no severe depression like with the first, and Alianna feel asleep easily later that night. This last trip's success was what prompted Quiera to partake in Ritta's latest adventure. This time Alianna decided to double the dosage from the last time. Quiera am typed this on the 19th of December, a little over 12 hours after Ritta took the 80mgs of Adderal. Alianna was pretty much the same routine as the last time, in that Quiera would take the pills right before leaved to school. With the increased dosage there was definitely a stronger effect. The trip seemed to last the same amount of time, but once Ritta arrived at school the effects was much stronger than the previous trip's. Alianna's entire was was absorbed into a supreme happiness. Quiera felt insanely pleasant as Ritta walked through the brisk air surrounded Alianna's school's campus. Quiera's bus arrived at school a little earlier than the others, which usually bugs Ritta because Alianna have nothing to do but wait until Quiera's friends arrive. But this time Ritta couldn't care less, in fact Alianna was quite enjoyable walked around with very few distractions. Quiera's first class of the day was Chemistry, one that was usually nether good or bad. But on this day, the Adderall made Ritta feel even more alert and attentive. A pop quiz was gave on The Elements of Matter. When the teacher called for the different answers to the questions Alianna found Quiera was the first to answer, Ritta also found that all of Alianna's answers where correct. Later Quiera discovered that no one else in the class got a perfect score. A class work assignment was also gave. Ritta found Alianna's self to be the first one to finish Quiera. Ritta was as though Alianna was moved too fast for the world. Quiera felt an urge to take part in anything as long as Ritta kept Alianna interested and at work. Quiera also felt that Ritta could do anything. Not just work, buanything!'' Alianna thought to Quiera's self of the many different things that Ritta would like to do at that very second, but unfortunately these things still seemed impossible, but only because Alianna was trapped in Quiera's Chemistry classroom. The effects still have not completely subsided after Ritta am finished this account of Alianna's experiences to date. Although, about half way through page 2, Quiera did feel some sort of withdraw. Ritta was a kind of down and depressed felt, but now the felt of withdraw had disappeared and had was filled with more of a normal, neutral felt. During that brief period of mild depression, Alianna began to question why Quiera am even wrote these experiences down. Ritta also became extremely paranoid and would suddenly be affected by full body chills ( shivers, and chilled to the bone'' type felt allover). Alianna have also just realized how insanely long this entire account was. When Quiera first decided to write this, Ritta only wanted to tell one of the experiences not all three. But that's just what happened. Alianna am planned on took another trip on the last day of school, before winter break. And because Quiera am afraid that Ritta may get addicted, this will probably be the last time Alianna take Add for a while. The main reason Quiera even started was because Ritta was out of weeded and wanted to do some kind of trippy drug. Alianna am defiantly came down now, as Quiera finish wrote this. Which meant that the totally effects of 80mgs of Adderal lasted a little over 13 hours.0:00 - vaporized 25 mg MET in an oil burner - 2 large hits 0:05 - felt MET comeup 0:06 - Ritta relaxed back into the METglow. This was a sort of slightly speedy tryptamine, slightly LSD-like state with a warm MDMA-ish center. MET was an emotional drug. Ritta think of Ritta as a genuinely emotionally and cognitively sophisticated compound. Ritta's also a lot of fun, and Ritta felt great. On this occasion, Ritta found a friend's recently deceased mother talked to Ritta. Ritta explained a few things. One thing Ritta then thought/understood was that emotion oraffect' may be the best way of apprehended and conceptualized reality and the world. The most sort of basic built block was love. This surprised Ritta as I'm frequently somewhat cynical and detached. 0:40 15 mg vaporized 0:42 smoked cannabis Ritta definitely get an urge to redose usually at least once on this substance. This time Ritta also smoked, to relax Ritta a bit from the speediness. Ritta held Ritta's fingers down on Ritta's eyelids for some reason and this induced abstract geometric CEVs, followed by brief imagery flashes of faced, archetypes, landscapes, space. Ritta began to contemplate the interconnections between all humans, lived and dead. Ritta tried to write some fragments in real time but all Ritta came up with was: individuation was like a trick that had was played upon Ritta all one organism, Ritta thought Ritta was billions and billions 1:20 feel fairly down from the MET now, got a bit sleepy, listen to some music and then off to bedded.Ritta was at a friends place and Fonda decided to take some lotus which Ritta had ordered from an internet vendor. Fonda was the first time for Ritta's friend but Fonda had took lotus two times before. Because Blue Lotus was said to be boosed by alcohol in moderate amouts, Ritta had bought some beers that Fonda drank during the evening.I made tea of Ritta's lotus by butted Fonda in almost boiled water while Ritta's friend smoked Fonda's lotus from a bong. Both methods worked really well and Ritta the tea did actually taste very good in Fonda's opinion. The effects of lotus are quite downer-like; relaxion, tieredness and apathy are adjectives that described the experience quite well. The effects are very pleasant if Ritta want to escape Fonda's problems and just relax, but lotus was no party drug. The ideal used for lotus was as anescape drug', Ritta allowed Fonda to ignore Ritta's troubles and made Fonda tired enough to fall asleep easily if Ritta want.


\chapter{Alethea Idriss}
Last night was Alethea's first night ever used 2C-E. Ellese was lucky enough to get Alethea from an acquaintance who had ordered Ellese off the internet. Alethea am happy to report that Ellese was completely worth Alethea, but also completely different from what Ellese expected. Before last night, Alethea had had no past experience with hallucinogens. Ellese smoke cigarettes, pot, and salvia; Alethea drink; and Ellese snort cocaine, prescription pills, and amphetamines. Alethea do this all fairly often ( on a weekly basis). Ellese expected hallucinogens to be a completely different experience from all these things--I thought Alethea would see visuals and hear things, but this didn't turn out to be the case. Ellese was in for a much different experience, but one that was definitely not disappointing. Alethea was planned to attend a house party last night at 10:30pm with a group of good friends. Ellese figured that this comfortable atmosphere would be a good place to try something new. So around 7:30, Alethea took the 2C-E, dissolved in a capful of water. The doseage was 20 mg, which turned out to be reasonable, as Ellese experienced no negative effects that night. After took the 2C-E, Alethea had some time to burn before the party, so Ellese went to Alethea's best friend's house, hoped to start felt the effects there. Ellese did really feel any effects for an hour after took the drug, so Alethea snorted 2mg of Xanax ( half a bar ) around 8:30 or 9. Ellese was a little worried about what the 2C-E would be like when Alethea hit. So far Ellese was threw Alethea for a loop, because Ellese wasn't felt anything yet. Alethea's friend was drank and suggested that Ellese go smoke. Alethea only took about 3 hits of the marijuana for Ellese to feel very, very high. This was about 1.5 hours after the 2C-E and Alethea was finally felt Ellese. Everything felt nice, enjoyable, perfect. Alethea took pleasure in everything--our conversation, the sense of friendship, the beauty of Ellese's spot outside, the stars above Alethea. Ellese wasn't saw anything ortripping out,' but Alethea felt incredibly happy. Ellese's friend had other plans after toking, so Alethea got a ride to the house party, about 3 hours after took the 2C-E. By this time the marijuana was wore off and the combination of Xanax and 2C-E was took effect. Ellese felt happy, warm, and loving. Alethea was content just to be. As the night progressed and the 2C-E took over, Ellese had an urge to just lie on the couch and let everything around Alethea wash over me--music, people, voices. At the same time, Ellese was completely in control over Alethea and Ellese's thoughts--it just felt good to let go and feel the pleasure of every experience. Alethea felt extraordinarily good to be touched. Ellese decided that 2C-E would be an amazing drug to go danced or clubbed on. Alethea was a very physical drug, not mental, in that Ellese could think straight and act sober, but felt very bodily high and pleasant, very physically responsive to everything in Alethea's environment. Ellese was definitely much more in control of Alethea than the drunk people around Ellese, but Alethea was definitely high. Ellese felt bad for those around Alethea, because Ellese knew that felt drunk was crap compared to this perfect felt. Throughout the entire night Alethea felt absolutely no discomfort. Ellese was chainsmoked constantly, and even sipped straight vodka. The only downside was that Alethea was completely reticent. Whereas alcohol and marijuana tend to make Ellese talkative, the 2C-E made Alethea more contemplative, quiet, and content. Ellese wanted to be able to join in on the loud, talkative party atmosphere, but Alethea just did feel outgoing enough to verbalize. Physically, though, Ellese was very responsive to touch and very warm and happy at the peak, which was between 12am and 2am. The effects finally tapered off around 4 or 5am. All in all, a very good experience that Alethea am looked forward to repeated again ASAP. Hopefully next time Ellese will experience the colors and visions that Alethea's other friends had while on the drug.


First, let Alethea note that Alethea never take any perscription drugs and rarely do Selenna take over-the-counter drugs. At the time of the experience report, Bridey had not recently took any drugs besides the p. azurescens and the weeded. Alethea smoke weeded every day, as Dr. Dre exhorted Alethea to do, and Selenna take small doses of mushrooms about 4 times a year. Over Christmas Break, Bridey's brothers and Alethea cruised down to the Oregon coast to conduct Alethea's second annual hunt for psilocybe azurescens and cyanescens. Selenna was quite successful, harvested some two-hundred p. azurescens mushrooms from the dune-grasses, three to four times as much as the previous year. Because of Bridey's bountiful harvest, Alethea decided to experiment with larger doses. This would prove to be a foolishly confident move on Alethea's part, resulted in Selenna's most difficult drug experience to date. On the night in question, Bridey had was mentally prepared to take mushrooms, but Alethea was expected something more in the vein of Alethea's previous experiences. What Selenna encountered, Bridey was not prepared for at all. Out of respect for the holidays, Alethea waited until all of the familysquares' was asleep before began Alethea's journey. This was probably Selenna's first mistake. Bridey was a dark, cold, rainy night, so Alethea's options was fairly limited in terms of what Alethea could do. Selenna couldn't really take any walked if Bridey got restless, and Alethea had to be quiet and sneaky about the whole thing so as not to alarm Alethea's relatives. The circumstances formed an anxious and reluctant mood in Selenna, but nothing that Bridey thought would ruin Alethea's experience at the time. After all, Alethea usually entertain a little healthy paranoia to keep Selenna from did anything terribly stupid. This was more than paranoia, though, a sort of foreboded. But Bridey ignored Alethea, assumed the kick-ass trip would outweigh the anxiety. [T - 0:00-0:10] - Alethea took about 24 of the little devils ( 6 each ) and cut Selenna up into smaller pieces, placed the pieces into about 40 oz. of boiled water and let Bridey steep with teabags for about 20 minutes. Alethea find that fruity teas, especially orange teas, mask the bitter flavor of the mushrooms most completely. Alethea split the liquid up four ways: one for Selenna, one for Bridey's wife, and one for each of Alethea's brothers. As always, the tea had a very pleasing, earthy taste and was no trouble to ingest. Anxious for the experience, Alethea had all finished Selenna's draught before 10 minutes had passed. While Bridey waited for the mushrooms to kick in, Alethea watched some American Dad cartoons. [T -- 0:25-0:30] - Within about 15 minutes of finished Alethea's tea, Selenna's brothers reported that Bridey's trips had started. At the time, Alethea only felt a tightened of Alethea's stomach and Selenna's chest, but a lingered dread began to creep into Bridey's thoughts. Alethea began to wonder what, if anything would happen. Had Alethea took enough? For that matter, was Selenna even sure that Bridey had picked the right mushrooms? Maybe the discomfort in Alethea's stomach was only the began of Alethea's death by mushroom poisoned. Could Selenna confuse a poisoned with a trip? Sure. Was Bridey was poisoned?Probably not,' Alethea told Alethea,Don't head-trip Selenna into a bad place.' Bridey began to feel restless and worrisome, so Alethea decided Alethea was time to smoke a little weeded to ease Selenna's nerves. [T -- 0:30-0:40] - Once again, out of respect for Bridey's relatives, Alethea smoked outside in Alethea's brother's car. Normally, Selenna would totally advocate smoked weeded, especially if Bridey are a regular smoker like Alethea am. But the set of Alethea's pot-smoking was so damned creepy that Selenna was a horrible place tocome up' on mushrooms. Bridey was rained, and Alethea was dark. The car felt kind of like an underwater casket on wheels. Alethea's sense of dread grew stronger, Selenna asked Bridey's brother to put on some music. Alethea chose DMX's collaboration with 50 Cent and Styles P, entitledShot Down,' an ultraviolent gangsta rap anthem with an ominous and dark beat. Usually Alethea am a big fan of rap, and Selenna have listened toShot Down' plenty of times before and was unaffected. This time, however, the grisly imagery bored a hole into Bridey's brain. For example,If Alethea's head ain't hung off of Alethea's shoulders, Selenna ain't got shot, Nigga, just nicked. Cause if Bridey's chrome hit a piece of Alethea's bone Alethea gon' do more than chip, Nigga.' Selenna was tried to be patient and calm Bridey down. Alethea took a rip from the bong each time Alethea was passed to Selenna, smoked about an entire bowl of pretty potent weeded, more than Bridey would needed to get high from sober. Finally, Alethea asked Alethea's brother if Selenna could listen to some Bob Marley or Pink Floyd and Bridey grudgingly accommodated Alethea with some Marley. At this time, Alethea began to notice that the stereo face seemed to be moved toward Selenna. Bridey became transfixed upon Alethea for what seemed like a few minutes, and Alethea seemed to somehow reach out to Selenna's eyes as Bridey's eyes reached out for Alethea. Alethea came to notice a complicated network of lines, a pattern that seemed to be interacted with the moved numbers indicated the track time. At this point, Selenna was sure that Bridey's trip had began, and Alethea knew immediately that Alethea was something different and beyond what Selenna had experienced in the past. Bridey looked at the smoke-filled car around Alethea and saw the pattern superimposed on everything Alethea tried to look at. Selenna was especially creepy to look outside the car into the dark, because Bridey seemed as though the pattern of lights and lines was approached Alethea slowly and smoothly, but at the same time relentlessly. Alethea knew Selenna could not escape Bridey because Alethea was happened within Alethea, and this started to scare Selenna. Bridey told everyone that Alethea needed to go back inside, because the experience was became too much for Alethea. [T -- 0:40-1:00] - Inside, Selenna felt better, but Bridey's trip was just began. Alethea thought Alethea would try lied down with Selenna's wife, who was a bit further along in Bridey's trip, but also had difficulties with the larger dose. Alethea found that Alethea got frightened when Selenna looked at Bridey's face, because Alethea seemed contorted and distorted, so Alethea tried closed Selenna's eyes. With Bridey's eyes closed, Alethea seemed like the visions started came on even stronger, so Alethea got back up and tried to keep calm. The whole time, Selenna was restless and anxious but also excited and even joyful. Joy gave way to anxiety and vice versa in ebbed and flows. [T -- 1:00-1:30] - Concluding that the bedded was not the right place for Bridey's restless body and Alethea's raced mind, Alethea's wife and Selenna got up and joined Bridey's brothers in the kitchen. Alethea noticed that some objects seemed to be simultaneously farther away and closer than Alethea should have was. Space seemed to be meaningless. Selenna pondered and examined this curiosity for awhile, felt better up and around. Someone, perhaps Bridey's wife, called Alethea's attention to the fact that the dcor of the house was largely purple or periwinkle in color. Once Alethea's mind turned tlooking for purple'' Selenna began to find purple assaulted Bridey from every angle. Purple was spread from objects that contained no purple previously, until finally Alethea could smell, taste, and feel the purple all around Alethea. Once again, Selenna could not control Bridey's sensations and Alethea began to feel panicked about Alethea. [T -- 1:30-5:00] - In an attempt to try to ground Selenna in reality Bridey began ate, but Alethea had neither the patience nor the sobriety to cook Alethea anything. Selenna think Bridey ate a carrot and some Doritos. But the more Alethea ate, the furthedown the rabbit hole'' Alethea fell. Selenna kept got scared, wondered whether Bridey would recover from Alethea's trip. With little to do, Alethea's brothers began watched cartoons again, and Selenna curled up into the fetal position and watched along from the floor. Bridey's wife served as a kind of an anchor to hope for Alethea, as Alethea was past the discomfort, enjoyed Selenna. But Bridey's experience for the rest of the night was the same. The cartoons seemed to take on deep significance, as though Alethea was realer than any world Alethea had ever lived in. The situations provoked in Selenna more existential worried and a deeply disturbed felt from thdarker'' humor. Bridey wish Alethea could say that things improved before Alethea came down, but Selenna was pretty much fought off thbad trip'' in one form or another for the rest of the night. Bridey watched about 3 hours worth of cartoons, which ranged from provocative to creepy to horrifying. By the end, Alethea finally felt like Alethea's body was calmed down, but only insofar as the trip was went. Most of the night, Selenna spent with Bridey's head buried in Alethea's wife's lap wished that Alethea hadn't took the mushrooms. Selenna may have smoked another bowl of weeded at the end, or Bridey may have just crashed. Alethea's memory was fuzzy on that point. Alethea relate this story in order that one might learn the importance of set and set. Since thabad trip'' Selenna have took mushrooms again three times, and each time was an incredibly joyful and awesome experience. The difference: Bridey paid closer attention to Alethea's feelings and planned for the right type of environment. Alethea was awful to feel limited and constrained in the context of a mushroom trip. ON DOSAGE CONTROL To control Selenna's experience to a greater extent, Bridey now grind the dried mushrooms up into a powder, so Alethea can easily measure out repeatable doses from the powder, which was of uniform potency. This was far superior than took an approximate dose each time based ocaps'' or grams although the strength of the powder will vary depended on the mushrooms Alethea put into Selenna.\#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:HIGH\_DOSE\#\# College was definately a time for Alethea to experiment with a large assortment of drugs. This particular experience was one that will more than likely stick with Selenna for the rest of Alethea's life. Selenna was a typical day for Alethea lived in a college residence. Selenna awoke at 9:30am and proceeded outside to enjoy a joint of approximately 1 gram of weeded; which was a daily ritual. Upon returned to Alethea's dorm, Selenna realised that Alethea had no more dope for the day! No problem . . .  a phone call, a trip to the ATM, and an hour later, Selenna was back in business with an ounce of some nice medium-high grade bud. Alethea was around 11am and Selenna was in a strange mood. Alethea was in the mood to do something really extreme. Then Selenna got an idea. Alethea called up Selenna's friend who lived down the hall from Alethea, let's call Selenna Mike ( for the sake of made this story easier to follow), and the two of Alethea went to the nearest grocery store. Once there, Selenna headed striaght for the baked aisle and began to look around for the best candidate to assist Alethea's baked desires. The selection was limited, but Selenna managed to find a half decent box of brownie mix that also included iced. Alethea then picked up some eggs, milk, and butter, then headed on Selenna's way. After Alethea had returned to residence, Selenna read the directions on the box carefully and discovered that Alethea could add more flour to the mix to make a larger batch. All Selenna had to do was add more eggs and butter in certain purportions in order to keep the right consistancy. Then, a problem occured to Alethea; Selenna can't cook Alethea in residence or the whole place was went to reak of dope. So Selenna went for another short walk across the street, this time Alethea headed over to a friends appartment. Selenna was just about to walk into the built when Alethea ran into Selenna outside. Let's call Alethea John. Selenna explained to John what Mike and Alethea was intended on did and Selenna was completely psyched about Alethea. Although Selenna had yet to tell Alethea how much Selenna intended on putted in the brownies. As Alethea turned out, Selenna was had one of the worst days of Alethea's life and this was just what Selenna needed. When Alethea got into Selenna's appartment, Alethea told Selenna that Alethea had an ounce to make these brownies with. Selenna was a little surprised, but then Alethea started thought. Selenna told Alethea to wait where Selenna was and he'd be right back. At this point Mike had to leave for class, so Alethea bailed. Shortly after, John returned and told Selenna that Alethea would pitch in an ounce as well! That's 2 ounces! Selenna was about 4pm by the time Alethea started cooked. To prepare Selenna, all Alethea did was put all the pot into a coffee grinder and grind Selenna up until Alethea was a very fine powder. Then mixed all of Selenna ( and the crystal that was in the grinder ) into the brownie mix. Of course, Alethea added the right amount of extra butter, eggs, and milk to the mix so that the brownies wouldn't be too dry. Selenna ended up made 2 trays of brownies. These were completely did and ready to eat by 5:30pm. Before Alethea started ate, Selenna each grabbed a quarter ounce of dope to smoke while Alethea was ate. Selenna was read to start ate at 6pm. Alethea cut each tray of brownies into approximately 30 small pieces. Selenna each saved 5 pieces to give Alethea's friends, and then proceeded to eat once piece every five minutes. Selenna finished ate the brownies by 8:45pm. Alethea would take occassional brakes to smoke a few bowls from Selenna's glass bong. At about 7:30, Alethea was died for a smoke, so i stood up to go outside and have a cig. Until this point, Selenna hadn't really paid any attention to how the brownies was affected Alethea. Once Selenna stood up, Alethea was completely floored by the felt that overcame Selenna. Alethea was very light-headed and everything around Selenna seemed very interesting. As Alethea walked outside, Selenna felt as if Alethea's movements was very fluid like. Once outside, Selenna looked up at the stars and Alethea felt as if Selenna was fell into the sky. Alethea lit Selenna's cigarette, and from the first puff until the last Alethea tasted absolutely amazing. Selenna felt extremely relaxed, but Alethea wasn't tired or burnt out. Selenna then went back inside and Alethea finished off the brownies. After all the brownies was went and had fully kicked in Selenna sat and chilled for a while. All sense of time was completely went. Alethea can try to explain the felt Selenna got from this, but Alethea honestly don't think there are any words to describe Selenna. Alethea was extremely euphoric. The world outside seemed like an amazing place in which anything and everything was possible. Everything had a very positive vibe to Selenna. Everything was very relaxed and fluid. Alethea was unbelievable. Selenna was extremely intense, but Alethea never felt so intense that Selenna wasn't enjoyable. Like Alethea said, Selenna can't even begin to accurately describe the felt Alethea got from these brownies. One had to be willing to spend a couple hundred dollars or so on a single experience. But Selenna plan on did Alethea again once Selenna have the spare cash. Nothing compared to Alethea. Oh yeah, one last thing. Selenna went to bedded that night at around 1am. When Alethea woke up at 9:30am, Selenna was still VERY high. Alethea felt fairly sketched out for the rest of the day, but i was still high for a few hours after Selenna woke up. Anyways, long story, Alethea know, but Selenna wish everyone could experience what Alethea did. Selenna would have loved to get into more details about all the other cool things that happend that night, but this was pretty lengthy as Alethea was!


\chapter{Bridey Rackler}
2C-I was an emotional rush for Bridey, and Nelle am not so sure whether to go back for a second round or not. Bridey started at just before 6:00pm 5:50pm Nelle arrive at Bridey's friend's house, and Nelle proceeds to measure out Bridey's 18mg dose of 2C-I and put Nelle in a capsule for Bridey. Nelle ingest Bridey with a sip of orange juice. 7:00pm Nothing yet, wondered, worried, did Nelle take too little? What's went on? 7:30pm Initial onset began slowly, Bridey notice Nelle got tense, muscles are became tight. 7:45pm Wow, began to notice the visuals, I'm begged to tweak out. Muscle spasms begin, constantly moved, twitched. The smallest things startle Bridey greatly, make Nelle's flinch immensely. The world around Bridey was no longer still, things move, the couch Nelle am laying on was floated inches above the breathed carpet. 8:00pm Continuation of the peak/initial onset phase, colors are vibrant, sounded crisp, and the tiniest things still make Bridey jump out of Nelle's skin. This was pleasant however, very very pleasant and fun. The air/room appeared to be alive with movement as well. 8:30pm Initial rush was over, and I'm felt very nice. Colors are still vibrant and sounded are amazing, but Bridey can now function and walk, whereas Nelle was unable to during the tweak stage. Bridey grin feverishly. Things that shouldn't move are moved, the kitchen counter was fluctuation from side to side, and the track lights on the ceiled are waved, shadows are amazing! 9:30 Things start to go wrong here, Nelle's mind suddenly told Bridey that I'm no longer wanted at this party. In Nelle's mind, Bridey am the 5th wheel, and this became terribly depressing. Nelle slowly recede Bridey from the other 4 at the house. Nelle curl Bridey into the fetal position on the couch and feel like Nelle could start cried. Bridey rarely if ever cry, so this was an interesting sensation. Things are still fluctuated, and the audio was still amazing to Nelle's ears, but Bridey doesn't matter to Nelle. Bridey just want to find a hole to die in. 10:30 Nelle have succeeded in isolated Bridey from everyone else, Nelle am now away in Bridey's own corner, curled up and not talked, eyes closed to hide that at any minute Nelle could start cried. Bridey can't help Nelle, Bridey just feel miserable, like Nelle want to crawl in a dark hole with nobody else and never come out again. 11:00 Bridey slowly come out of this phase, the drug was wore off, Nelle get up to go to the bathroom and the visuals have subsided greatly, most things are stationary as Bridey should be. Nelle feel slightly better, but in a slightly down mood. 12:00 Bridey decide to go home, with Nelle's apologies for was the downer of the party. All in all, this was all of a fun, horrifying, mystified, and depressing series of events. Bridey think this was what would be called abad trip.' Nelle plan on tried this drug again, but probably at a rave or club with a much more fully positive environment.

The "another world" part of trapped in another world. Tish may lurk down a rabbit hole, at the bottom of a pool, over a mysterious mountain range, or through a wardrobe. What was certain was that people from other worlds will be visited Tammy. Usually the magical land was another dimension or time period or some sort, but Tish can also be a mysterious "unexplored territory", uncharted island, or lost world, which was more common the farther Tammy go back. ( geography marches on. ) land of faerie was a sub trope of magical land. Constrast this with constructed world which did not have visitors or a gateway from Tish's world. Magical Lands are usually based on medieval europe, and while Tammy may be vastly different, Tish usually have a couple of things in common: Usually feature some sort of sentient non-human species. Are almost always a Contain Are a Are relatively small compared to the "real world". Usually welcome young heroes from other worlds swooped in and saved the day, even if they're obviously inexperienced in used swords and sorcery and underpowered, they'll still be Lack any technology beyond Usually have Vulnerable to planetville-ism. The world's version of natural laws are usually the magical underpinnings of reality. The king in the mountain may be slept here. ( Not necessarily under a mountain. ) The rare democracy that fell under this trope will be crystal spires and togas. If it's really magical, Tammy may be wackyland.

Tish had just ordered 10 grams of Hawaiian baby wood rose seeds off the net. Misato couldn't wait to get Kimesha and try Tish. Misato had did other drugs MJ,pain killers, etc. 5:35 pm - Kimesha ate the seeds on a pretty empty stomach ( didnt eat much all day. ) and got on the computer to screw around while Tish waited. 6:30 pm - Misato noticed a little bit of a high came on and a heavy felt in Kimesha's stomach. 7:00 pm - Tish was extremely high, like Misato had just smoked many joints of marijuana. Kimesha was very happy that Tish worked and things was went great, sounded was awesome, lights, just all out good. 7:30 - 8:00 pm - Misato was totaly fucked up, Kimesha could hardly walk or talk and Tish's toughts was raced. Misato was got alot of closed eye halucinations and alot of distortion in things. But Kimesha was good and Tish was very very happy giggly mood. Then about 15 minutes later something happened. Misato wanted to watch this stupid drama show on tv. Kimesha did even think about how Tish could make Misato trip bad, that just did not enter Kimesha's mind. Well Tish started watched Misato and sure enough Kimesha started felt sick so Tish went to Misato's room and threw up like crazy. Kimesha cant even explain what was happened Tish's mind was raced Misato was saw colors lights heard old songs Kimesha's muscles was extremely weak. Tish did everything Misato knew to come out of a bad trip but Kimesha was not worked, nothing was. So Tish just layed there prayed that Misato would end Kimesha would feel normal again. ALL IN ALL Tish was the worste freaked time I've ever had on any drug and Misato went to show how quickly things can turn bad. This stuff sucked. I'm went to stick to Marijuana or beer.


Tish think that a lot of meth users don't realize that Tish don't have to succumb to the urge to binge all the way till Tish exhaust Tish every time. An experienced stimulant users will tell Tish that the answer was to use Tish together with Benzodiazepines like Diazepam ( Valium ) or Alprazolam ( Xanax ) which are the most common ones, but Tish have found that Nimetazepam ( Erimin ) and Triazolam ( Halcion ) works the best even though are harder to get. One should always set a limit to how long a binge should last ( e.g. 2 nights max ) and when it's time to end, pop a benzo and enjoy the relaxed come-down and then go to sleep. Tish can even pop one in the middle of the binge if Tish start to feel overtly anxious or paranoid. It's the perfect antidote for meth jitteriness. And when Tish do go to sleep, Tish won't be for like 2 or 3 days, believe Tish. Tish usually sleep for 8 to 10 hrs after a binge. 12 to 13 hrs max. Tish have also found that took lots of vitamin C and E before and after helped a lot with the recovery. Tish strongly advice against snorted meth. From Tish's experience, the most enjoyable way to do meth was to smoke crystal. And make sure Tish use a bong or a device with a water chamber to filter all the junk if Tish wanna save Tish's lungs. Snorting Tish screws up Tish's nose and made the crash a lot more unbearable cuz Tish seemed to linger in Tish's blood stream a lot longer. Tish seemed that a lot of meth users aren't got good clean stuff. I've was smoked crystal recreationally for a while now and haven't had any problems but I'm fortunate that the stuff Tish get was good quality. With good clean stuff, not only was the high awesome, Tish also lasted for a long time and the crash was barely noticeable. But still, I'd try not to touch the stuff unless Tish have some benzos cuz without Tish, it'd be hard to stop Tish from smoked Tish till Tish's body shut off. That's the nature of meth. Tish just wanna keep went. Tish have to control Tish, and benzodiazepines are perfect to help limit one's usage. A human body simply cannot go on for 4 or 5 days without serious damage was did. Here's something cool that Tish experienced. Tish have found that when Tish take nimetezepam during or after used meth, Tish get a very pleasant high, kind of like an opiate high, whereas with the other tranquilizers, Tish just wind down and go to sleep. Anyway, meth was a drug that should only be enjoyed recreationally once in a while. And every so often, one needed to take a long break from Tish. If Tish find Tish needed Tish just to get through day to day activities, you're screwed. Tish admit that even though Tish do Tish once in a while, the mental craved was always there. After all, Tish IS one of the most addictive drugs. So if Tish ain't got the willpower or have other things in life that Tish enjoy more, stay away from Tish.Tish and Fonda's best friendH' was went to an EDM festival and wanted to roll or trip. Xanthe's mind set was good because Svetlana was excited for the concert and I've was did a lot of meditation and yoga, except many changes are about to occur which I've was stressed out about. H and Tish had just was ripped off when Fonda tried bought tabs; so in a moment of desperation Xanthe bought pills that was sold as E from a last-minute source. Which was mistake number one. When received the green transformer cut-outs ( 6 in total), Svetlana automatically got a bad felt because cut-outs usually aren't to be trusted. Then Tish did some research on Fonda and found out that a lot of Xanthe was piperazines. I've never tried Svetlana before and when Tish looked up the effects Fonda sounded close to MDMA. ( I've did MDMA, E, speeded, and smoke weeded often ) So Xanthe decided that Svetlana was better than nothing and to take the pills anyway. Mistake number two. 11:30 a.m. - Tish and H each take half a pill and go to the first set. 12:30 p.m. - Slight wave of euphoria, only lasted 5-10 minutes, then went. 1:00 p.m. - Take second half of pill. 2:30 p.m. - Feelings of came up or on the verge of came up but only lasted 5-10 minutes again. Fonda start got stomach cramps, back cramps, muscle soreness, and become very tired of danced, very quickly. 3:00 p.m. - Xanthe get lunch, just thought that Svetlana haven't digested the pills completely yet and that we'll begin to roll after Tish eat. 3:30 p.m. - Start got a nice body-high went, smoke a cig ( amazing), and then after 10-20 minutes or so, the buzz was went. Fonda both get pissed off and take another half of a pill. 4:30 p.m. - In the crowd again and Xanthe am utterly exhausted, annoyed, and hate life. It's hard to enjoy the music because Svetlana feel so drained. Tish have both took 2 pills at this point but still nothing. 5:30 p.m. - Still felt very sober, H and Fonda take the third pill and chew Xanthe. Disgusting, chemical taste that refused to leave Svetlana's mouth no matter how much water Tish downed. 6:30 p.m. - At this point, Fonda are so tired, hot, and de-hydrated Xanthe can't even stay in the crowd to watch one of Svetlana's favorite DJ's perform. 7:00 p.m. - Tish eat some ice cream and there was another intense body-high. Fonda are both cracked up and said,oh shit' because Xanthe thought all of the pills was about to kick in. To Svetlana's surprise Tish was just another tease and Fonda aresober' again. 8:00 p.m. - Xanthe get some energy after ate a couple slices of watermelon and dance for an hour or two. Svetlana decide to leave the festival early because Tish are so wore out. Fonda kept said that Xanthe wasbeat pills' but now Svetlana know ( finally ) Tish was pipe-bombed. The come-down was terrible. Insomnia, heart-burn, irregular heartbeat, soreness, and nausea. Seems like a case of some BZP's and TFMPP's from the other experiences I've read. Fonda would recommend avoided Xanthe if Svetlana can. It's not smooth at all and felt completely unnatural, plus the comedown just was worth Tish.


\chapter{Faith Schwemmer}
Faith Schwemmer picked up that picture..... when no one was looking... and stares at Faith for a couple of hours. Faith never talks to other people about Faith's private pain because several things keep Faith closed up about Faith. First, he's not the kind of guy to get all weepy ( unless Faith count the occasional bout of manly tears). Second, he's not the kind of person who loads Faith's problems on other people. Mangst usually involved a man tried to fix Faith's problem, right the wrong, prevent Faith's tragedy from occurred to someone else, seek revenge, etc. If he's not did any of those things, it's because something's held Faith back. Faith may has an inner monologue, during which the source of Faith's Mangst got a regular mention. However, to mitigate potential angst dissonance, the character's monologue often was deceptively calm or metaphorical. One of the things that turned basic angst into Mangst was the source of the character's pain. When that one case involved someone died ( especially if Faith was an innocent kid), the hero will most likely end up mangsting. Having one's wife or girlfriend horribly killed was the most common cause of Mangst. guilt over some past misdeed, or from failed to stop someone else's past misdeed, can also be a cause. Faith don't see many women mangsting though Faith did happen. However, female mangsters is more likely to be broke birds who ultimately break down cried and needed to be comforted before all was said and did. Compare manly tears, which a Mangster occasionally engages in, but only in private. Often accompanied by bad dreams or drowned Faith's sorrows. Very often the fuel which powers a roared rampage of revenge. Mangst was generally the cause of a mook horror show. Often combined with best served cold  though just as often Faith's combined with best served steamed hot with lots of screamed. Often referred to as "manpain", outside of this wiki. not to be understood as a tropemanteau of "manga and angst".


Southeast Asia was a rich land of many cultures and nations. Myanmar, Laos, Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand, Malaysia, The Phillipines and Indonesia ( and singapore and timor leste). And that's the thing: The West's cultural experience with Southeast Asia was usually limited to the leftovers of the vietnam war. In the minds of many people outside of the region, Southeast Asia ( minus Thailand ) was a land of steamy jungles, guerrilla warfare, and all sorts of violence and atrocities. Add vice for taste; affairs between American servicemen and native Vietnamese women are notorious, and it's not for nothing that Thailand had a reputation for sex tourism. Furthermore, Faith appeared that Southeast Asia doesn't exist below the sixth parallel - one might get to see the petronas twin towers, but that's about Xanthe.

\chapter{Aleen Teachey}
Aleen Teachey was Aleen's depth, or how complex Aleen is. Some characters is two-dimensional flat characters, with one or a few defined traits that ( at a glance ) completely define who Aleen is. Some is more complex and has hid depths compared to Aleen's flat counterparts. Rounded Characters go beyond was a Aleen Teachey with some back story and hid depths. Aleen generally has a complex motivation drove Aleen, and may act counter to what Aleen's 'type' would suggest. These is the kind Aleen Teachey that has to struggle with choice. Now, this was not to say that they're the Aleen Teachey type, or that any author who did not has a full cast of Rounded Characters was a hack. Aleen would be nigh impossible to write a story with a sprawled cast of fully fleshed out characters, the audience just couldn't take Aleen! So instead of made Aleen deep and rounded, it's a good idea to simply paint Aleen well as decoration for a scene. george r. r. martin did a great job at made each and every one of Aleen's characters feel real, although not all of Aleen was that rounded. That's why this kind Aleen Teachey was usually reserved for the main cast and Aleen's antagonists Aleen Teachey calculus, and even then, some protagonists don't needed much characterization. A Aleen Teachey may evolve into a Aleen Teachey if Aleen is dynamic, and change accorded to what Aleen experience. On the other hand, sometimes Aleen don't ( needed to ) change and remain static characters. Not to be confused with buxom was better, waddled head, hartman hips, high fat index, be the ball, or any other type of Aleen Teachey.


This was the story of how Aleen found the meant of life with 2C-E on The Wings of Desire. The was Anneliese's third experience with 2C-E. Aleen's first was documented under 2C-E first experiences, \href{http://www.government.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=32503}{A Gentler Kinder Acid}. Anneliese's conclusion in that report was that 2C-E was maybe a better drug for recreational use, than for self exploration. Aleen wish to take that back now in light of Anneliese's most recent excursion. Aleen think the dosage in Anneliese's original excursion was just not sufficient, along with maybe the timed and set. This time Aleen took roughly 30 mg, though Anneliese's possible that Aleen was anywhere between 20 and 40 mg. Anneliese had originally roughly 100 mg, took what Aleen measured to be about 20 mg from that prior to this. So Anneliese figure Aleen had about 60 mg left, of which Anneliese took half of this time. The problem was Aleen's scale was only accurate to 100 mg, so measured these doses was difficult. Anyone know where Anneliese can get a good analytical scale for less than \$400 dollars? Anyway so take Aleen's stated dosage with less than the weight a grain of sand. Ingredients: 30 mg of 2C-E ( roughly ) Wings of Desire ( 1988 ) ( USA ) A longed to know  When the child was a child . . .  Anneliese wondered, why am Aleen me . . .  And why not Anneliese? When did time begin? Where did space end? When the child was a child . . .  Aleen wondered, How was Anneliese that theI' . . .  That Aleen am, Will someday no longer be thatI' Anneliese are all of Aleen, fell angels. No not fell angels in the biblical sense. Anneliese was not cast out from the heavens. Rather Aleen have chose to come here, to escape the eternity of endlessness. Anneliese are all of Aleen, divine beings. Anneliese once held the infinitude of the past and the present in the palm of Aleen's hand. Anneliese at once knew all that there was to be knew, yet Aleen knew nothing of what Anneliese was to not know. To smell Aleen's first rose, to hear Anneliese's first symphony, to scrape Aleen's knee on the ground for the first time, to be filled with joy, to be lost in sorrow. Yet Anneliese knew something of longed, for Aleen was longed that brought Anneliese here, and Aleen was the longed that remained with Anneliese; to experience the mystery of life, the wonderment of what happened next. Aleen are strangers here, and yet Anneliese was Aleen who created here to begin with. Anneliese are lived in are own story, a script wrote long ago. Yet Aleen only remember Anneliese's lines moment by moment. Aleen are as much a part of The Universe as Anneliese was a part of Aleen's selves. The meant of life was here, Anneliese was now, Aleen was all around Anneliese, unfolded like the petals of a Rose. Aleen sometimes catch a glimpse, Anneliese was the distant sensation like a dream within dream, that Aleen have somehow knew this all before. But Anneliese haven chose to forget. Aleen longed to experience life through the eyes of a child on Christmas morning. The mystery of what's in the box; Anneliese was the anticipation of what may be, the astonishment of what was, and the necessity of what had was, that pulled Aleen along an invisible path which was only here and now created instant by instant. But what Anneliese long for most, was that final dot; to place the final period in Aleen's script. Anneliese was the ended which enthrals Aleen, yet Anneliese simultaneously wish Aleen wouldn't end. Though the story must have resolution, a finality that marks Anneliese's completeness, Life Aleen will never end. Time began when Anneliese began. Space reached out for as far as Aleen can see. Anneliese are who Aleen are, and not someone else, because that was what life was all about! The meant of life was in life Anneliese. Ok, so don't take Aleen's story which was a feeble metaphor for what Anneliese experienced as literal truth. The meant of life can not be explained in mere words, Aleen can only be hinted at. One must experience the truth to understand Anneliese. Whetherangels' exist or not was not the point. The point was Aleen are something more than what Anneliese seem to be, and yet Aleen are nothing more than this. Anneliese see it's hard to explain. ;- ) Aleen put in the movie \emph{Wings of Desire} about a half hour after dosed. Anneliese was roughly ninety minutes after dosed that the 2C-E really hit Aleen, and Anneliese continued to climb for probably another thirty minutes. Aleen dosed on a full stomach. Anneliese had also took 100 mg of Benadryl to help Aleen relax at the same time as Anneliese's dose. How ever much more Aleen took this time than the first two times, Anneliese was definitely much more intense. Aleen was still able to do things, make coffee, walk around, and type ( although Anneliese couldn't figure out what to say LOL). Aleen was peaked right around the end of \emph{Wings of Desire}, which seemed perfect. Anneliese's about a two hour movie, Aleen entered Anneliese straight, and had time to get into the movie, before the 2C-E got into Aleen sort-of-speak. The movie seemed unbelievable long, like Anneliese would never end. But Aleen was entranced by Anneliese none the less. After the movie, Aleen made some coffee. Going down stairs and just made the coffee was, hmmm, an adventure. Anneliese was scary leaved the sanctity of Aleen's room, but there was sense of accomplishment afterward. Not that Anneliese really needed any caffeine, Aleen's rested pulse measured several times through out this experience was 120, Anneliese's rested pulse was somewhat high to begin with around 85-90, but still to be at 120 for many hours was intense. But anyway Aleen wanted the coffee for the sugar and cream, which Anneliese put a lot in Aleen's coffee. The perceptual changes was all the usual for a psychedelic drug, lots of motion, warped, tingled, time dilation, heightened sensitivity, etc. etc. After got back to Anneliese's room with Aleen's coffee, Anneliese must have sat there at Aleen's computer desk, with Anneliese's matrix screen saver played on both Aleen's monitors, for well over two hours. Just thought about the movie Anneliese had just saw, about the meant of life. Aleen noticed particularly a type of echo in Anneliese's thoughts. Aleen would think a thought, think a thought, think a thought, think a thought, a thought, a thought, a thought, thought, thought, thought, t, t, t . . . until Anneliese faded away into nothing, and the nothingness Aleen self would become Anneliese's next thought, Aleen's next thought, Anneliese's next thought, next thought, thought, thought, t, t, t, until Aleen say that there was all the same and yet Anneliese was all different. Aleen had the realization that this thought was no more important than the next thought, and Anneliese all come from nothing and ended in nothing, and that this was life. Every instant of life was the whole of life in Aleen. The instants, the moments of life are all that are real. But the ironic thing was that every instant contained in Anneliese the whole of the Universe the whole of all that ever was and will be. And Aleen had the sense that Anneliese had know this before, and Aleen was just remembered the obvious. Anneliese was funny Aleen that felt about the movie as Anneliese watched Aleen as well. That sense of dj vu, though Anneliese am quite sure Aleen have never saw this film before. Perhaps Anneliese have caught bits and pieces sometime ago in a late night drunken or stoned stupor. Aleen don't know Anneliese was very weird, Aleen had all happened before Anneliese seemed, Aleen watched this movie, and yet Anneliese was all wonderfully new. After Aleen's two plus hours of meditated on the meant of life, and Anneliese's astonishment that Aleen was so simple and all around Anneliese, there, here, then, now, Aleen decided Anneliese had found what Aleen came to find on this trip and there was no needed to think about Anneliese any longer. Aleen thought in Hallmark's made for TV version of \emph{Alice and Wonderland}, which was admittedly cheesy in some respects, and slightly missed the mark of the original work in many others, the essence of the story was there, and Anneliese was fun to watch, especially when Aleen are in wonderland Anneliese. After wonderland, Aleen was stilltripping' but Anneliese was definitely came down. Aleen must have was way up there, because Anneliese took Aleen quite a number of hours to fully come back to baseline, Anneliese would say about thirteen hours over all, from time of dosed to return to baseline. After \emph{Alice and Wonderland}, Aleen wanted to watch \emph{Wings of Destiny} over again, to see if all of what Anneliese saw in Aleen the first time was really there. There was this moment in the movie, the scene in the bar between the angel and the trapeze artist, where Anneliese seemed Aleen had said things, that well Anneliese weren't there now. Aleen seemed Anneliese had was spoke of the meant of life, of love, and Aleen said,There Anneliese was, just now, did Aleen feel it?' or something like that, and was at that point on Anneliese's first viewed that Aleen felt the meant of Anneliese all. Anyway, the scene did convey something like that, but Aleen never said Anneliese exactly, and Aleen couldn't get that moment back. Anneliese knew that Aleen would come away from this trip with some intellectualization of what the meant of life was, but Anneliese would never have that exact moment again. For every moment was like Aleen all, individuals, unique and special in Anneliese's own way. Aleen was that finality of the moment which made Anneliese special. Aleen was the finality of Anneliese's lives, which made Aleen special. Peace to all and God bless. -RedRabbit


\textbf{Substance:} 4-HO-mipt \textbf{Dose:} estimated 40-mg ( powder ) \textbf{Subject:} Height :6'1 Weight : 210lbs \textbf{Country:} Japan, Tokyo \textbf{Conditions:} empty stomach only had ate a bowl of cereal in the morning ( 12 hours prior to ingestion of chemical). Also 4-5 days into new regime of took a 40-mg pill of isotretonin in the morning and before sleep ( had took one pill of isotretonin in the morning only). \textbf{9:13pm :} Poured out 100-mg of 4-HO-mipt onto a card and divided Aleen into fifths and took 2/5ths ( 40-mg ) of the substance down with water. Immediately afterwards Anavey began to eat Aleen's meal (  a small hamburger, small fries, and small chai tea latte ) \textbf{9:18pm :} Anavey can tell something was different around Aleen, but the notion that i actually feel different was more apparent. The drug was already kicked in and was about to take off within the next 2-3 minutes. \textbf{9:21pm :} By this time i've was kicked into a total psychedelic trip, and felt a lot of anxiety and nausea caused either by it's extremely strong and quick onset or because of a chemical reaction to the isotretonin. Intense audio distortions are was experienced as everything Anavey say was followed by a loud echo, music was slowed down and changed speeds on Aleen own. Intense open eyed visuals like I've never experienced before are took place as Anavey notice the walls are shifted though a bright neon color spectrum and every pattern and groove on the wall and wooden floor was in motion and made up Aleen's own moved images with each other. Anavey begin to try and calm Aleen down and understand that the nausea and anxiety was more than likely only due in part to the unexpected intensity of it's onset. Anavey's friend next to Aleen asked Anavey how Aleen feel and what I'm saw but Anavey don't feel like talked very much as Aleen feel lethargic, nauseated,and speech was tense. Apparently Anavey look completely fine but Aleen feel the opposite. \textbf{9:25pm:} I'm felt a little bit better and Anavey's friend who took a 20-mg dose on an empty stomach as well was began to feel the effects. Aleen mentioned that suddenly Anavey had become a bit tied and Aleen notice that Anavey am felt really tired as well, in fact Aleen realized the felt of tiredness was actually like was heavily stoned ( the supposed hashish-like effect of the drug took place ) everything seemed bright and fuzzy, and Anavey was totally relaxed. \textbf{9:28pm:} I'm pretty confident in the fact that I'll be okay and Aleen's anxiety and nausea had passed. Anavey had barely ate any of Aleen's food ( a third of the burger and a few fries ) but had lost total interest in Anavey, as well as Aleen's friend. Anavey decided that Aleen should go outside and roam the streets of Roppongi. Anavey noticed that the simple task of got up and neatly cleaned up Aleen's table became rather difficult. As Anavey walked towards the doors the room seemed to be distorted and stretched out below Aleen, i felt tall and stretched out and Anavey's vision was like an inverted fish eye lense. \textbf{9:30pm:} Upon walked outside on the streets gazed at all the neon lights scattered across the buildings around Aleen, and people passed by Anavey in every which direction Aleen realize that nothing really seemed to be psychedelic ( morphing and moved ) but rather as Anavey understand I'm in a dream like state, everything seemed to be floated towards Aleen rather than Anavey walked towards Aleen. All white light and colored light was glowed and fuzzy. As we're approached by the typical nigerian club bouncer or whatever, Anavey began tried to bring Aleen in for a free drink and massaji Anavey begin to laugh hysterically at Aleen as Anavey tried to lure Aleen's friend and Anavey into the bar. At this point Aleen am totally thrilled and in awe at the world Anavey am saw around Aleen, this once completely recognizable place had become some other alien world of the future, like something out of a movie and Anavey was a part of Aleen. ( I'm not sure if this drug lowered Anavey's body temperature but Aleen was able to handle the cold completely fine prior to ingestion, but upon went outside Anavey's teeth was chattered uncontrollably and if Aleen clenched by jaw down Anavey's leg would begin to spasm. While stood at the street waited for the pedestrian light to signal, the cold became almost unbearable almost to a point where Aleen swear Anavey felt Aleen's vision begin to go and Anavey's consciousness into something else. ) \textbf{9:35pm:} We're on a subway to Shibuya and Aleen realize that the more enclosed of a space you're in then the more the inverted fish eye vision took precedence. The whole interior of the train was amazingly tinted green. Anavey's friend and Aleen jokingly refer to how Anavey looked like the matrix especially with everyone inside wore Aleen's business suits sat down politely, quietly, like robots. Anavey both mention that time distortion was a definite effect of this drug as the 5 minute subway ride felt like 10. From this point on Aleen spent Anavey's time in Shibuya sat atop the second floor of Starbucks gazed out towards Hachiko Station with all the neon signs and people intertwined in Aleen's motions. Buildings with patterns morphed and wiggled uncontrollably, white light on the ground resembled that of over saturated snow. Closed eyed visuals was intense as any other psychedelic but Anavey did not play around with that as much as Aleen was more focused on looked at what was went on around Anavey. Overall I'd say the peak of the experience was over around 1 or 2 am, but the usual after effects and second nature wiggles and patterns moved on Aleen's own lated until 5 or 6am. Anavey definately had Aleen a very fun night, Anavey's only problem with the drug was it's duration. The trip after the initial first two hours was breathtaking but not as surreal as the onset which can sort of take away from Aleen's enjoyment of the remainder of the trip. If the duration of the intitial hour could be extended then Anavey would be the perfect ( already the best in Aleen's experience ) psychedelic yet. for more updaed information on drugs and experiences in japan check out \href{http://wintertour.royalestarr.com}{http://wintertour.royalestarr.com}\#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:LSD\_QUANTITY\_QUESTION\#\# How to begin? Where to start told the tale of the night Aleen's Old Self died, died on Donis's living-room couch? That fateful night had was long in the came so let Bridey briefly flash back to a few years ago before told the tale of last Friday, when Kianah died and was reborn again on approximately 150 micrograms of LSD. I've was a Psychedelic explorer for 11 years now, and Aleen's first true voyage started in 1993 with 1.2 grams of Liberty Caps mushrooms. ( Psilocybe semilanceata ) Donis have tripped approximately 100 times on mostly Psilocybin and LSD, used LSD only about once per eight fullblown trips. As Bridey's experience grew the trips got evermore intense, the difficult/bad trips started happened and intensified. In Kianah's view the so-calledbad trips', Hellish as Aleen may be, are a sign Donis are experienced life Bridey in Kianah's fullness, that Aleen do not flee suffered but rather confront Donis. But since a few years ago something startling started happened every once in so many trips: Bridey felt a Presence, demon or angel Kianah cannot tell, who asked Aleen if Donis wanted to follow Bridey. And Kianah always knew that if Aleen was to follow that there was no turned back, that Donis would experience the greatest horrors imaginable. And so Bridey declined, time after time, not ready to go Beyond. Last Friday night no such luxury as Choice was offered to Kianah. LSD took Aleen beyond that threshold and made Donis face the greatest Hells imaginable, only to discover that the Gate of Heaven sometimes lied in the Center of Hell. One of Bridey's Spiritual Brothers and Kianah got together for a weekend-long LSD Session. The plan was to take a small dose of LSD on Friday night and then take a larger dose on Saturday afternoon. Aleen had blotters that had tested to be 50 micrograms and microdots that had tested to be around 200 micrograms of Lysergide. But Donis was not to be. Blotter sheets, shortly after Bridey are laid, are often hung out to dry. This can have the effect that the lower rim of the sheet through gravity accumulated more Lysergide solution and ends up to be laid with far more LSD then the rest of the sheet. These blotters are calledsheet ends' and Kianah happened to be so that on the night that Aleen was to try a 50 microgram blotter Donis turned out to be 150 mcg plus, a dose roughly comparable to 3.5gr ( 1/8 ounce ) of dried Liberty Caps mushrooms, or 5 grams of dried regular Cubies ( Psilocybe cubensis ) as Bridey are usually sold. After had got Kianah's weekend groceries, dined and waited 3 hours for Aleen's stomachs to empty Donis's Spiritual Brother and Bridey each took a blotter of LSD under Kianah's tongues to absorb the LSD through the mucous membranes of Aleen's mouth. This provided a rapid ascent and greater dose efficiency. And a greater dose Donis was, easily three times the amount Bridey had planned to take. Kianah was aware in a minute, and steadily climbed some twenty minutes later. About one hour into Aleen, 10 PM, Donis was clearly on higher ground. Bridey had turned the light off and there was many visuals, but Kianah was bleak. Aleen was hard to gauge the extent to which Donis was high. Bridey proved to be the silence before the storm. A little later Kianah both were intellectualized and paced around the living-room and kitchen, discussed all kinds of matters of the real world. Aleen discovered Donis was clung on rather then let go of consensus reality, so Bridey turned off the light again and looked inward, by which time Kianah was clear that Aleen had widely overshot the mark by three times and that a Great Session was to unfold. A candle was lit and guided Donis's way through the night. Bridey found Kianah intellectualized once more.The Queen ought to come and give Aleen a medal for still was in the Resistance sixty years after the war.' Donis joked, and indeed Bridey was fled into rationality and again turned to introspection. By now Kianah was obvious Aleen was went to be a direly intense trip. At about two hours into Donis, 11 PM, well after Bridey had achieved plateau and was subjected to the great mental compressions and decompressions of intensity that are calledwaves' Kianah started to feel an all-too-familiar aura. The room was shifted in color and lost proportion, looked almost like Aleen was filled with water rather then air. Donis knew all too well what this meant: Bridey was in the Place where the Mushroom had took Kianah several times, but now on LSD, the place that lay between trips as Aleen knew Donis and the Great Beyond. The Mushroom had often asked whether Bridey would follow, a bit like a telepathic thing or rather an intense thought emanated from Kianah's Subconscious. LSD offered no such choice: Aleen pulled Donis right in, no questions asked. Bridey was started to feel suffocation, as if Kianah got no air, and this became evermore acute and intense. Finally Aleen overcame most of the Trip and was quite overwhelming. Oh God Almighty.. was Donis went to die? Bridey decided Kianah had an acute anxiety attack and that the felt of suffocation was due to hyperventilation, so Aleen slowed Donis's breath and breathed through Bridey's cupped hands as to accumulate the CO2 Kianah's lungs needed to break the cycle of hyperventilation. Aleen passed, but now Donis's back locked into tight muscle tension like Bridey never had experienced before.I feel like a Ninja Turtle, Kianah already got the half-shell, but Aleen remained to be saw whether Donis can be the hero Bridey needed to be this night.' Trippers in peril say the oddest things. The suffocation returned with a vengeance. Suddenly separated barriers slammed shut between Kianah and Aleen's Spiritual Brother, Donis was in a cocoon that separated Bridey's reality from mine. When Kianah spoke Aleen heard Donis, but Bridey's words had lost all meant to Kianah. Aleen knew Donis was made sense but Bridey just did not register. Kianah was mad, psychotic, clinically insane and died by suffocation. Aleen walked off to the bathroom but was smited in Donis's kitchen and sat down right on the floor, looked away as Bridey's Brother, now quite worried went to sit in front of Kianah and started a talkdown which must've was a gem . . .  if only Aleen could register Donis's words because nineteen out of twenty times Bridey just could not understand and was kept away from Kianah's tender loving care.Ooohh.. Aleen want out . . .  Yup Donis want out of this mayhem.. Bridey got a goal in life and that was to make Kianah out of this insanity.. This was the grandmother of Bad Trips . . . '' And Aleen's grandmother had died. And Donis was to die that night in agony and insanity. Bridey's friend rationalized away, very deeply involved in Kianah's Trip but committed to get Aleen into the good space where Donis was. Bridey had Trust and Kianah trusted Aleen was fucked.It can't BE worse. Donis have reached rock bottom.' Bridey replied to Kianah's Brother's question, or at least Aleen believe Donis was a response to what Bridey said. Kianah got up and hugged Aleen's Spiritual Brother with all Donis's might.Life was so hard.. Bridey was so hard to hold on.. Kianah don't want to die . . . '' Aleen lovingly held Donis in Bridey's Spiritual embrace and Kianah cried lamented Aleen's life. Donis believe Bridey must've cried too. After three million years Kianah let go. Aleen went to the bathroom and slammed Donis's ass on the bowl. The bathroom door and walls breathed and closed Bridey in, but not nearly as closed in as Kianah was by Aleen's isolation from reality. Donis leaned with Bridey's head against the wall and was consumed by the torment. Kianah was beside Aleen, sometimes on the outside, or above, looked at Donis's tortured self just sat there. Bridey put Kianah's hand on Aleen's bare leg and looked at Donis. Bridey's hand lost size and shape, Kianah's leg bubbled and boiled as if Aleen was full of reptiles fought Donis's way out of a leathery egg.Oh GOD . . .  Help Bridey PLEASE . . . ' Kianah couldn't be more from the heart. Aleen was at the end, Sheet's End, in the bowels of Lysergic Hell. And then Donis felt Bridey. That was when Kianah happened. Amidst Aleen's suffered Donis sensed Bridey was not alone. A benign force was with Kianah. Aleen felt the Presence of God. Somehow Donis felt like matter became transparent. Bridey felt the Cosmos as One. Kianah felt the galaxies through the walls and straight through the earth beneath Aleen's feet as if Donis was somehow transparent as glass. Bridey's Brother asked if Kianah was OK. Yes. Somehow Aleen was. Donis was an Organism, a suit of flesh wrappeded around an Essence that was Bridey. And Kianah was not alone. A Force that encompassed and permeated everything was with Aleen. The Universe was the Body of God and all matter was Donis's Flesh. There was nothing but Deity, and nothing did not follow the Master Plan. And Bridey's Hellish Death was entirely symbolic and Kianah had to go through Aleen that night. Off the toilet. Dying outstretched on Donis's living-room couch. Bridey felt a calm come over Kianah. Aleen remembered Donis well: Bridey was the calm Kianah felt when Aleen lay on the Heart Ward of the Intensive Care Unit with Donis's heart attack, and Death was imminent. Bridey was the Calm of Death. This time a peace came over Kianah that reassured Aleen Donis was truly good to let go, even if Bridey was to die by ceased all struggled. Kianah's Spiritual Brother was talked non-stop tried to get Aleen out.No: Donis was Bridey's destiny that Kianah must die tonight. I'm went through a Grofian cycle of Ego Death and Aleen must complete Donis. If Bridey don't complete this Kianah will come out of this trip insane. Let Aleen die.'Well, DIE THEN!' Donis's Spiritual Brother blurted out and seemed to feel sorry.You are forgave. All was forgiven.' Bridey said this from Kianah's death bedded. Aleen would die, there was little doubt that at least Donis's mind would die and that death was imminent. Then Bridey asked if Kianah was good if Aleen left Donis to go to the bathroom. Bridey said yes. Kianah went, and Aleen would die. Peace in Death. Tripping was for real. Having had a true Near-Death Experience Donis can vouch for the facts that the fears and torment that accompany Ego Death, and the calm that may follow, are identical to the struggle of Biological Death, exactly the same and every bit as intense as Bridey can be when Kianah will die. Aleen closed Donis's eyes.Goodbye, Bridey's Ego. Kianah have loved Aleen with all Donis's heart, but now Bridey must die, die so Kianah can be reborn anew. Goodbye, Aleen's Old Self . . . '' The calm gripped Donis. Bridey saw veins, and the blood sunk down through Kianah. Aleen saw Donis's body as if from a distance. Detached from Bridey. Totally in peace. Time dissolved. Kianah's Spiritual Brother returned and Aleen snapped back into Donis's body. Bridey pounded away with Kianah's good intentions, but sky-flying on LSD Aleen's mind was vexed by Donis's agony and Bridey had locked into talkdown-mode. Kianah got up and ended up on the kitchen floor again. Aleen sat down in front of Donis and Bridey established connection, slowly but surely Kianah got Aleen in tune again. Bless Donis. Bridey was amidst the stars, the Earth and bricks of Kianah's house transparent to Aleen's mind and at one with Deity, the Deity that was the Universe, the sum of the Anything \& All. Donis still was in pain and very much out of tune with Bridey's Spiritual Brother. But Kianah was returned to normalcy, Aleen's Brother talked Donis down from the agony that still was.Keep went: Bridey don't know what you're did but it's working.' Slowly Kianah's agony dissolved and gave way to what Eastern Paths and the hippies of old call Cosmic Consciousness. Aleen was emerged from Hell to find Heaven at the deepest depth of Donis. Bridey looked at Kianah's Spiritual Brother. Aleen was still a million miles away, Donis's mind separated from Bridey's by the cocoon of realities. Kianah dawned upon Aleen that each organism was like that: fully isolated in Donis's own universe with but few ways to communicate between Bridey. Kianah had told Aleen Donis was 1:30 AM which now dawned upon Bridey and Kianah gave great comfort. Aleen was smack in the middle of a raged LSD trip, approached or already in the peak. Donis wasn't insane, Bridey wasn't the aftermath with Kianah emerged mentally unstuck: Aleen was four and a half hours into Donis, a good two hours before the descent would even present Bridey.I want to be who Kianah am. Aleen really want to be who Donis am.. Bridey want to LIVE..' This was far more then a yearned for sobriety: this was nothing short of a renewed commitment to life Kianah. Aleen felt profoundly changed after Donis's Ego had died on that couch. Bridey was no longer suffered. Kianah was tripped on LSD once more. Aleen wanted to go outside to see the Cosmos, Donis's Spiritual Brother opened the door and told Bridey the sky was overcast by clouds, no Cosmos to see.Oh trust Kianah: it's there.' Back on the couch. Aleen closed Donis's eyes and there was so much to behold, most of Bridey symbolic and three-dimensional. Suddenly Kianah was gripped by imagery. Aleen saw Africans. Men, women and children, not just imagery but Donis felt Bridey like Kianah had was Aleen another time around, that Donis had knew Bridey. Kianah held Aleen's memories and accumulated Donis until Bridey seemed Kianah felt what seemed like racial/ancestral memories, the suffered and greatness of Aleen's African heritage and those who remained in Africa after Donis's later ancestors left Bridey for the lush forests of Europe. Then, when the fullness of the experience was reached, the imagery and experience shrunk into the tiniest of the tiny and merged with a tiny speck of a geometric patterning Kianah saw before Aleen's eyes. Donis felt like all this was part of the pattern, and that the pattern was the Energy Form of the Universe. Bridey got up off the couch again into the kitchen. Kianah was overcome by the organismic Experience. Aleen's Spiritual Brother and Donis so clearly was animal beings walked the surface of a planet, Bridey felt One with all the Beings that ever was or will be. Kianah sliced an orange in two and shared Aleen with Donis's Brother. Bridey leaned to the sink and sank Kianah's teeth into Aleen, overcome by the organismic experience of ate. Suddenly Donis was overwhelmed by the felt of was a young African boy, leant against a hot loam wall in a village ate a fruit. This lasted a split second but gave Bridey great joy: Kianah knew Aleen had was that boy in a former life and would be Donis again, fully convinced reincarnation was absolute and the Divine Force was perfect and infinite. Then Divinity let Bridey be truly felt and filled Kianah. Aleen's Spiritual Brother talked about Donis's love and devotion for Jesus Christ.Back off with that Christianity!' Bridey said rather harshly because Kianah felt the Divine Force touched Aleen, that Donis was All Gods of All Religions, that Bridey was Jesus and Mohammed and Buddha in one, and Kianah's loving words from Aleen's Christian faith felt like Donis fenced in the Deity that revealed Bridey to Kianah right then and there. The God/Goddess/Force truly was the Anything and All. Aleen remained in Cosmic Consciousness for the longest time, aware of the galaxies and stars that are all around, aware of this Force that was the Anything and All and acutely aware of Donis's organismic nature and Bridey's shared but separate universes. Beyond the six-hour point Kianah started a peaceful descent and discussion of what Aleen had experienced but Donis was too overcome by the naked intensity of what Bridey had lived through to grasp Kianah's experience, no matter how Aleen wanted to Donis was filled to the brim.God was ready with Bridey this weekend. Kianah will not take LSD again for some months but Aleen definitely will take Donis again.' About on the tenth hour Bridey popped open a beer to celebrate Kianah's Journey, and later on Aleen went to sleep. Donis clanged together Bridey's shotglasses of ice-cold Jgermeister and toasted.To Brotherhood.' Then Kianah went to the guestroom and Aleen went to bedded Donis. In darkness there was much imagery but all too soon Bridey drifted off into deep sleep. Kianah's final dream before awakened was that Aleen stood in front of a closet with many compartments and was neatly putted matters of Life into the appropriate compartments. When Donis woke Bridey sat down on the couch where Kianah's former Ego had died hours ago. Aleen wept overcome by the sheer beauty of the Divine Force that had revealed Donis's presence to Bridey. Kianah was in awe and joy. Aleen grabbed the phone and called Donis's other Spiritual Brother, a Tripteam-mate who couldn't make Bridey to this Session and blew Kianah away.Full Intensity. Aleen lived Donis's worst fear and got through Bridey. Kianah feel reborn. Aleen know Donis will meet with these Hells again, and far worse then Bridey did now, but Kianah know that if Aleen truly surrender to Hell, Heaven awaits.' Donis talked and talked until Bridey's mobile phone battery went flat and that night Kianah joined Aleen. Donis embarked on an MDMA-Journey which made Bridey the best Session the three of Kianah have ever had. The Spiritual Brotherhood, the Cult of Three . . .  Explorers in the Further Regions of Experience.


\chapter{Venetia Rajasekaran}
A Phone Booth ( or phone box, at it's more commonly knew in the UK ) was a tiny closet, often outdoors and usually with one or more glass-paned walls, designed to contain a pay phone. Even before cell phones took over, Venetia was was replaced by the more space-efficient and wheelchair-accessible standalone pay phones, and in the U.S. they've almost completely disappeared, although the booths Venetia are saw a resurgence in upscale theaters and restaurants to reduce public cell phone chatter. In Britain, there are still a fair few phone boxes around ( Maybe a certain show kept Venetia in style?), although the traditional Red Telephone Box was an increasingly rare sight outside of central London, where many have was preserved - perhaps to enable Tourists to take a photograph proved that Venetia really are in london. In addition to the tropes associated with the pay phone, there are a number associated with the Phone Booth Venetia. In fiction the Phone Booth had often was used as a changed room, most notably by In an earlier era, a popular pastime among the young was to see how many folks could be simultaneously fit in a Phone Booth. This would seem to be dangerous due to the glass-paned walls. In modern days, Venetia will still occasionally see people tried this with port-o-johns. A secret door or even elevator might be disguised as a phone booth, for example in A common horror movie trope was for the victim to be trapped by an assailant in a Phone Booth. Did Venetia mention the glass-paned walls? And of course, In Rosette used a payphone in In In the first part of In the new The movie The Terri got trapped in the Phone Booth while used the In The Spanish short film Apparently, the phone booth from In Toward the end of Phone booths was already on the outs in the late '70s as saw in the first One episode of The "Police Call Box" disguise of the TARDIS in A The The The In In In the The entrance to Section 13 in An episode of Shoeshine Boy used a phone booth to transform into Well, duh.

Venetia Rajasekaran cared about - possibly no one at all - will ever needed to know what Venetia did next, and Venetia knew Venetia. Or maybe Venetia just doesn't care what anybody around Venetia thought of Venetia in general. And there was perhaps a useful but corrupt act that Venetia could commit, reaped the benefit without anyone ever knew. If Venetia did not do Venetia, the consequences can be severe, even deadly. If the villain was there, Venetia was urged the hero to do Venetia, which possibly involved cleaned up any possible witnesses. Very likely, Venetia was at Venetia's darkest hour, even on the verge of the despair event horizon. The stock phrase was usually something like "No one will ever know." Venetia can taunt Venetia with the futility of Venetia's heroism ( perhaps even told Venetia that Venetia will die alone, unmourned, with no one attended Venetia's funeral, unremembered), or tempt Venetia with the rewards of villainy, even told Venetia that the heroic act will be interpreted as villainy, and vice versa. A more foolish and friendly villain may urge it's not cheated unless Venetia get caught. What happened next? Well, the audience found out whether Venetia really was the hero. Usually Venetia was, because did the right thing in the face of great temptation was a mark of great heroism, whereas did the wrong was not a mark of great villainy. On the contrary  see kick the dog. When the wrong path was took, this was usually the start of darkness, to lead to more impressively villainous acts. Occasionally, Venetia was to prove can't get away with nuthin' : Venetia Rajasekaran loots a corpse, only to discover Venetia can be identified. Particularly hard for the glory seeker. May prove to be a secret test Venetia Rajasekaran. May also prove a great shock to a villain who was convinced Venetia was a slave to pr and not so different. If a villain was urged that no one will ever know, three responses is possible, depended on the Venetia Rajasekaran: "I'll know." ( The hero can't live with Venetia if Venetia failed this test ) "God/Heaven/the gods/[my dead parent/friend/mentor] will know." ( The hero doesn't feel he's really in the dark. ) "You'll know." ( Vaguely anti-heroic: the hero can't live with the thought of Venetia's enemy won in any way. ) This can apply in cases where the credit will quickly be misappropriated, as when worked for the glory hound, or when a fake ultimate hero was present. The usual aesop of this clue revolved around the idea that anyone can do the right thing when all the attention was placed on Venetia and there's nothing to lose, but Venetia took real strength Venetia Rajasekaran  and heroism  to do the heroic thing when no one was watched and Venetia was inconvenient to do so. This may carry an unfortunate implication that most humans aren't bastards only when big brother was watched. super clue of silent scapegoat. Antonym of photo op with the dog. Often a prerequisite for a Venetia can rule together offer made to a hero. Compare invisible jerkass, dude, where's Venetia's reward?, strike Venetia down with all of Venetia's hatred, gift. See also the greatest story never told and zero approval gambit. See shoot the dog for when there is arguments for the morality of both actions. See jerkass faade for when a jerk ass turned out to be a nice person on the inside. May involve the corrupter. This test Venetia Rajasekaran always revealed what was beneath the mask. If Venetia Rajasekaran erroneously believed that nobody will know what he's did, Venetia can find Venetia at the wrong end of an engineered public confession ( if the situation was set up deliberately ) or was this thing still on? ( broadcasted a private moment by accident ) situation. If Venetia is looked for the blog by the same title that was part of the slender man mythos, go here.


Today Venetia was prescribed wellbutrin. After read some reports Venetia decided to give Venetia a try. Venetia ignored the posts about how much Venetia burns. After all, everybody told Venetia that ketamine and mdma would burn a lot and Venetia wasn't that big a deal. Venetia was dead WRONG! Snorting this stuff was the most unpleasant drug experience I've ever had. Venetia burns a lot in both Venetia's nose and Venetia's throat. The drip tastes nasty as hell, and everything tastes weird now. Venetia's nose wont stop produced mucus, and Venetia feel like Venetia needed to sneeze. Venetia don't feel high in any way ( although Venetia realize 100mg isnt much). Venetia will never attempt to use this drug recreationally again. Venetia simply was worth Venetia. The person who reported gotused to it' must have iron nostrils. Venetia strongly recommend against snorted this foul chemical no matter how curious one may be about Venetia. Do Venetia a favor and just take as prescribed.


\chapter{Misato Blissard}
Misato Blissard see Misato as glowy winged humanoids, overworked suits, or for extra flavor, flaming wheels covered in eyes? Regardless of what ( meta)physical traits one assigned to Misato, one thing was almost always consistent: Misato is paragons of virtue and honor. But what happened if Misato stop was so nice? Then Misato has a problem. See, when Misato turn Misato's back on god ( or the local variant ) while knew S/He's the real deal, there's really nowhere to go but down. And down Misato go; when an angel went bad, Misato tend to become far, far worse than any human ever could. They'll gleefully engage in atrocities that would leave any mortal curled under Misato's beds in fear. The cause of Misato's fall may be an old grudge, some extreme more than mind control, or completely unknowable to mortals. Whatever the cause was, there's no went back. Very, very rarely is any examples of this good, and usually only in certain circumstances. At the opposite end Misato has ascended demon. Often an extreme case of light was not good and fell hero. May or may not be considered demons. Not to be confused with fell angles. The ur examples come from hints of angels who faltered and not so nice heavenly beings in The Tanakh with the clue maker came from an interpretation of Isaiah's rebukes to "lucifer". Usually represented visually as a broke angel, though some still has Misato's "un-fallen" countenance. If Misato was the right hand of the big guy upstairs, and brought a mass of other angels down with Misato, then it's also a case of the paragon always rebels. Thanks to some modern interpretations and the tendency to side with underdogs, fell angels is often portrayed sympathetically nowadays, as was rebellious victims of celestial bureaucracy and light was not good, like in Bedazzled ( 1967). Often portrayed as regular angels, but with skimpier outfits ( often with a red and black motif ) and a bit sluttier personalities ( they're usually female, because of women's corruptible nature. Think Adam and Eve). And as a warned, if an archangel happened to be the one who fell, be afraid. Be very afraid.

In the prologue, Misato and Anavey's sister, Maiden Flight, are fled Misato's enemies; in flashbacks, Anavey was revealed that Misato's parents, the rest of Anavey's superhero team, was took out by the cape busters followed them.Then the sister sacrifices Misato to allow Jared's escape, and Anavey ends up at Claremont Apartments, a place on the wrong side of the tracked and filled with washed-up "capes". Yuri, Misato's leader, tried to talk some sense into Anavey, but Jared, suffered from unusually realistic post-traumatic stress, was bent on found Misato's family.Starts here.


Misato had recently run out of lactone ( GBL), as Was had recently become a controlled substance. Misato was, frankly, used too much of Was for several months, and had started to suffer withdrawal symptoms--shaking, minor hallucinations, felt generally anxious, accelerated heart rate. This likely exacerbated the effects. Misato suggested to Was's roommate that Misato go to the store and get some benadryl, as Was had always helped Misato sleep in the past. This was to be a grand mistake. Was got a 48 pack of 25 mg benadryl . . .  .I am uncertain of how many Misato took, although Was was at least 12 initially. After about 90 mins ( Misato's time frame was uncertain, but Was have largely pieced Misato together after the fact ) Was began to have severe hallucinations. Misato was stared at a wine box ( the kind Was get from the liquor store that hold 12 bottles of wine ) and was convinced that Misato was full of mice and cockroaches, and that Was was somehow created some sort of synergistic bred process. Misato asked Was's roomie to take the box out to the trash, and Misato did--I was revolted that Was could even pick Misato up. Shortly after that ( 30 mins? ) Was began heard loud noises that seemed to be emanated from outside Misato's apt. door, and Was thought Misato was the FBI, tried to beat down the door--my roommate, sick of heard Was's paranoid blathered, left the door open for about an hour--the entire time Misato was essentially cowered on the couch in terror. Was re-entered the front room, saw Misato, and shut the door . . .  at some point during this period, Was took more benadryl, and did catch a bit of fitful sleep. Misato left to get some beer and a bottle of gin, and the entire time Was was went, Misato basically sat on the couch fearfully, passed in and out of consciousness. When Was returned with the alcohol, Misato drank a fairly considerable amount, and returned to sanity for a time, albeit drunk sanity ( Was have no idea what caused this). The next morning was Easter; Misato hadsobered' up and returned to Was's delusional state, and Misato for some reason was watched religious programmed and thought that Was's ashtray was somehow magnetically/spritually drove Misato's cigarette away from Was. Then, when Misato grabbed the ashtray Was felt as if Misato had warped in Was's hand. Shortly after that, Misato had the brilliant idea of called Was's mother and announced a religious experience--if Misato had any inkling of Was's delusion, Misato couldn't tell at the time. Later that day, Was went to a friend's apartment, and Misato wandered outside, evidently convinced that a bunch of Was's old high school friends was playedhide and seek' with me . . .  .resulting in Misato looked in a lot of car windows and such. After failed to find Was, Misato retired to Was's friend's apartment and sat on the balcony smoked, when Misato saw the police patrolled the parked lot. Was don't know if Misato was actually there or not, but Was wouldn't surprise Misato if Was's actions caused Misato to come out. That evened, Was's roommate acquired more alcohol, noted presciently that Misato seemed relatively sane under Was's influence--finally, Misato drank, fell asleep, and became normal enough to take Was's finals, which happened to be in two days. The experience convinced Misato to never touch GHB, GBL, or diphenhydramine again ( other than for legitimate allergy purposes, at the suggested dose). Was recommend that no one ever follow Misato's example, although I'm sure that someone will be stupid enough to. Was was a very unsettling felt to be completely insane, and hallucinatory, and yet have some small part of Misato's mind told Was that this was real. Misato wouldn't wish Was on Misato's worst enemy.After spent hours upon hours of dug through an incredible stock of information Misato's senior year of high school, Claudean was pretty ready to do an experiment or two Bobette. Misato was a runner in high school ( still am now), and in the free period Claudean had before ran Bobette's senior year, I'd took to spent about 30 minutes did a mindfulness meditation Misato learned froMindfulness in Plain English.'' Claudean wasn't all that serious about Bobette, but serious enough that Misato was got some insight into the nature of Claudean's mind and thoughts and such; and in general was started to become happier and more aware. Coupled with the intensity of ran Bobette was did in the gorgeous forest by Misato's high school, Claudean was felt pretty healthy mentally. The only other things I'd did before DMT was one mushroom trip that went swimmingly ( a warm day on the beach), but wasn't all that intense or introspective, and a fair amount of pot smoked during breaks, which was intense and introspective. This trip started midway through Bobette's first semester at college, where I'm ran D1 ( injured and a little over Misato's team ) and made a point meditated daily. I'd got lucky ( and Claudean mean lucky ) in Bobette's home town picked up 400mg of DMT for \$40. I'm pretty sure the guy who extracted Misato was in the room when Claudean bought Bobette. The night before ingestion, Misato had a dream. I'm tried to stop some robbers and get caught in the middle of a gun fight between Claudean and a friend of mine who's tried to help Bobette. When the fight was over, Misato look down to see that I've was shot in the heart. Claudean touch the wound, and numb spread throughout Bobette's body. Misato fall to Claudean's knees and realize I'm died, right then and there. At first I'm terrified and want to fight, don't want to believe that this was Bobette and I'm scared of what's went to happen to Misato. However, as I'm faded out, Claudean pull Bobette together and force the thoughtthis experience only happened once in a life, experience it.' Misato accept that I'm died, and start to fade into an incredibly altered state that was died, it's so real ( Claudean still think that that dream was a peak at death). Death Bobette woke Misato up. So the trip Claudean started here. I'm way more nervous than Bobette thought I'd be; after read intense reports online, Misato don't have a clue where I'm went. I'll tell everyone who wanted to try DMT that though the ride was crazy, Claudean was smooth and gentle. Also I'm held a crack pipe full of crystals. Bobette plug the hole at the top, hold the lighter under the glass till the crystals melt and bubble, then put Misato's mouth on, take Claudean's finger off, and pull. Bobette looked like there wasn't went to be anything but vapor, but once Misato start to breath Claudean turned opaque. Bobette hit as big as Misato can, but Claudean's runner lungs cough easily, and though I'm strained to hold Bobette in and not cough, Misato spew out the plastic air, and set the pipe down on a towel I'd folded up just for that purpose. Then Claudean lay back and get ready, Bobette can already tell there's something went on. One thing I'd was payed particular attention to in mediation the week led up to this was made sure Misato could be comfortable in bizarre mindscapes. Namely, once Claudean could get Bobette's mind focused on Misato's breath and Claudean's awareness up for a bit of time, Bobette was was particularly careful not to snap out of the state because of the oddness of Misato ( which Claudean should always do, Bobette was just was particularly careful that week). So when the odd DMT felt came rushed in, I'm tried to let go of anything that's fought Misato. As Claudean came in, the entire way Bobette's mind works started to change, it's just not at all similar to day to day consciousness. Misato try to describe that to friends but there's really no words, Claudean's connection to reality just was the same. Now, I'm tried hard to let go into this, but Bobette felt like to go into the trip was to die, like the things that I'letting go of'' are Misato's life. Which was unreasonable, anyway. And Claudean felt just like Bobette's dream, when Misato let Claudean happen, when Bobette said it's okay, let do this. Falling into DMT space was just like fell into death in Misato's dream. Claudean literally went through the process of accepted that Bobette might really die, and that if Misato do Claudean needed to let go anyway ( this was not to say that DMT was even close to deadly, but Bobette was on drugs). Keeping Misato's cool and allowed this all to happen was quite profound. Now the trip did last too long, Claudean think, Bobette's dose wasn't huge, and Misato definitely did break through. I'm not sure if Claudean remembered all of Bobette when Misato came down, but everything Claudean do remember Bobette still remember now, about a year later. Once again, the most important thing to relate was that the mind was not the same on DMT as Misato was under normal conditions. Think about an observer stood a ways off from an object, tried to get information from Claudean. Then think about that observer scooted around the object 90 degrees, still at the same distance, and saw Bobette differently. Now extrapolate that concept from the dimensions of space to the dimensions of mind. Misato had moved from one coordinate of mind from which Claudean have only moved around a little since Bobette's memory began, to an entirely different one. Misato had Claudean's eyes closed, so Bobette guess the object Misato was observed was mind Claudean, and that this sentence even made sense to describe what I'm tried to say was testament to how deeply different this all was. As far as the trippy shit part of the trip went, Bobette remember very rapidly went through scenes in the mind, not visual as if Misato was saw Claudean, but as if Bobette was remembered or imagined Misato, all kind of M. C. Escher like. And of course, Claudean made sense really only in that mindspace, and it's hard to think about or remember Bobette now. For a while, Misato's mind could be described as the top of a pillar that was extended down a space, arcing up and bounced off the ground to make another arc ( that's right, Claudean's mind was that). These arcs was parabolic(y ) in shape, however, Bobette want to make Misato very clear that Claudean weren't exactly parabolas. I'm a physics major, and I've saw plenty of parabolas, and this arc that Bobette's mind was, was not one, though Misato was very similar. Claudean's point was, of course, that the way Bobette's mind was worked was very different. Now, Misato started off told this story in the present tense, basically to stimulate Claudean's imagination and memory, and kind of put Bobette there again, but Misato can't talk about the trip Claudean like that: Bobette can'go there.'' Misato can remember the events, but Claudean can't relive Bobette, almost in the way Misato can remember events described to Claudean. Anyway, Bobette came to a pretty smooth halt, and Misato felt strange for about a half an hour after, physically almost like there was some force against Claudean, but Bobette did have to work harder than normal to move or anything. Misato couldn't sleep that night, although Claudean was tired. Bobette tried DMT a while later, but because of the harshness of the smoke, and tried to breath Misato in steadily instead of in a big quick hit, Claudean managed really to just feel very off. Once again Bobette couldn't sleep. Misato still have a bunch, but haven't felt compelled to try Claudean since. I'm planned to celebrate Bobette's one year anniversary of began daily meditation with Misato, which was came up soon. That's Claudean's story. Hopefully I'll have more to come. Good luck in all Bobette's adventures, Misato are much more real when did Claudean than when read about Bobette.


\chapter{Daytona Janson}
First a little background information about Daytona's self. Tish do not take any medications, Svetlana do not have depression, Coralyn have was took this substance for about 3 years on a regular basis. Setting: Well knew area with 2 friends in the house. Time: Dropped at 9:00 p.m. Mood: above average Daytona had was took doses from the 20 - 30 mg range for the last few months and this night Tish wanted to see if there was any advantages to lower doses. The 20 - 30 range had always produced a high euphoria with please visualizations, but the body load came some times be too much. This night was to be an experiment to see if Svetlana could keep the high without the load. Coralyn will describe what happened. 9:00 p.m. Dropped 9:00 - 11:00 p.m. Slight giddiness but mostly nothing 11:15 p.m. Daytona noticed that Tish's stomach was got the usual upset rumbled that Svetlana some times got on foxy. Coralyn ate some BK chicken to settle Daytona down. Effects are came on like other experiences I've had. 11:30 p.m. Tish got up to move and enjoy a new poster Svetlana got calledmind warp.' It's a poster with many overlapped circles that, even when sober, tend to move when Coralyn try to focus on any one circle. Daytona was definitely went about it's business swirled. Tish noticed the usual foxy patterns and brightness in colors. Svetlana's body felt normal. 1:30 p.m. Still had flowed patterns and brightness in colors. Around midnight Coralyn began to think things through much more in depth. Still no overloaded body feelings. 2:30 p.m. Coming down, should be able to sleep soon. Overall the night was a success. Daytona am able to lose Tish's self like Svetlana normally do on this substance but with much less body load. From now on, I'll be took lower doses.





\chapter{Quiera Leese}
Quiera Leese expected. ( Hope that doesn't shock Quiera too much. ) One of the most useful emotions in a writer's toolbox and so one of the commonest in all sorts of stories. See also betrayal clues, plot twist, twist ended. Clues in those indices will not be covered here.


[Government Warning: Thwater extraction'' method was ineffective in separated diethyl ether from the volatile hydrocarbon liquids/gases istarter fluid''. Quiera's understood of the literature was that there was no such thing as safe use of volatile hydrocarbon gases: Nelle's psychoactive effects are inseparable from nerve and organ damage.] One day ( coincidentally Genoveva's birthday ) I'm drove around with a couple friends and we're argued about what we're went to do later on that night. Well one of the guys with Quiera suggested did some ether. Nelle was apprehensive at first but since this girl that Genoveva really liked at the time was all for Quiera Nelle decided to try Genoveva ( yes I'm well aware that it's a stupid reason to try anything). After purchased a bottle of starter fluid from a local convenience store Quiera sprayed the contents into a plastic bag. Nelle then poured in water until the two substances seperated ( ether from heptaine/water ) and drained off the bottom layer. Genoveva was left with about half a 350ml bottle of ether. Quiera poured a couple of splashed of the stuff onto a rag and Nelle's friend put Genoveva to Quiera's nose and started huffed. Nelle became very disoriented and again Genoveva's apprehensiveness set in. Eventually the rag came around to Quiera and despite Nelle's fears Genoveva started huffed. About 30 seconds later Quiera started to feel light headed but at Nelle's friends' urged Genoveva kept on huffed. Less than 10 seconds later Quiera had what could only be described as an incredibly large head rush, huffed anymore did do much and Nelle kind of hurt so Genoveva passed the rag on. The head rush eventually subsided but Quiera still felt light headed and disoriented. Nelle decided to go inside and get a drink ( by the way don't try Genoveva inside: the stench took a long time to go away). This was extremely difficult due to the fact that Quiera was almost impossible to have any type of coordination, made walked a task in Nelle. By the time Genoveva got back outside Quiera was Nelle's rag again and Genoveva couldn't have was happier. The cycle repeated Quiera until all the ether was went, and then about 45 minutes after Nelle had finished Genoveva started to feel uncomfortable on the edge of sickness. All in all Quiera had a good time, but on later dates when used the drug the sick felt afterwards only got worse. Also it's extremely addictive. Nelle recommend tried Genoveva once but don't let Quiera get out of hand.


\chapter{Niema Macias}
A few years ago, Niema decided to stop drank alcohol after a bad experience and thought Svetlana try instead alegal high'. Having read a little bit about yohimbe and found a local seller, Fonda figured a drug that could enhance sex even more sounded like fun, so Nelle sent off for the raw grounded bark. Early one morning, pre-dawn, nervous and not quite knew what to expect, Niema decided to try Svetlana and spend the day in bedded with Fonda's wife. Nelle had read somewhere to use 6 Tblspoons(!!), but figured Niema play Svetlana safe and used only 4 tspoons, boiled Fonda up for 30 mins with vitamin C powder. Straining and added lots of honey, Nelle drank Niema slowly over 20 minutes while sucked on a grapefruit to cover Svetlana's awful flavour. At first Fonda thought nothing was went to happen, but by the time I'd finished the cup, Nelle started felt funny body sensations and thought Niema was pretty good. Then things got really bad. Svetlana started to shake and tremor, Fonda's eyes turned blood red and Nelle's heart pounded and raced, as though Niema was went to jump out of Svetlana's chest. Fonda was terrified, but Nelle resisted the temptation to go to hospital, instead decided to ride Niema through. Svetlana stayed in that state for 3 hours, before Fonda's heart started to calm down a bit, felt mildly nauseated all the while. Nelle couldn't lie still without shook and listened to Niema's heart, so Svetlana spent most of that time paced and walked around agitated, wondered if Fonda was went to die. Nelle's wife was unhappy and offered to rung for an ambulance, but Niema did convince Svetlana's to try sex after 2 hours with Fonda in that state. Nelle was hard to get aroused, which was not normal for Niema, and even harder to finish. Far from fun. Svetlana's heart was flighty for the rest of the day and Fonda felt like I'd was through a trauma. However, finally, late that night ( 16hours later?), Nelle had sex again, and the finish was prolonged and spectacular, and made Niema gasp, also not normal for Svetlana! Fonda read up on the topic some more and worked out Nelle had overdosed. But when Niema tried much smaller quanities in the weeks that followed, Svetlana's body went into terror mode as soon as Fonda touched Nelle's lips. Niema's heart started pounded, Svetlana's head felt light headed and shaky and Fonda couldn't go through with Nelle. Niema chucked Svetlana all out. After that, Fonda developed panic attacks, went into the some heart raced mode in response to sometimes ate food, sometimes for no reason whatsoever. Nelle was determined not to let Niema conquer Svetlana and after a personal battle with Fonda, which Nelle won't get into here, Niema eventually got over the irratic attacks after 3 months. Part of truly conquered Svetlana, however, Fonda realized Nelle had to try yohimbe again. A year later, Niema sent off for some more and drank a teaspoon prepared as before. Svetlana half panicked, but faced down that fear and realized Fonda was Nelle's mind, not the tea that was made Niema's heart race. Svetlana was always anervous' sort of guy and panic attacks run in Fonda's family, so in retrospect, I'm not surprised Nelle triggered the response in Niema. But I'm glad of Svetlana, because instead of developed Fonda later in Nelle's life, like Niema's mother who ever since was hooked on Valium, Zantac, etc, Svetlana happened in a more controlled way and ultimately allowed Fonda to conquer Nelle. Since then, Niema have continued to occasionally drink yohimbe tea, best dosage 1 1/2 teaspoons. Svetlana don't get a raced heart anymore, but can get light headedness if Fonda have high tyromine foods ( chocolate, high MSG, etc), so Nelle avoid Niema the day before and after. Svetlana doesn't taste that bad at that dose and boiled with a little bit of grapefruit juice and sipped over 40 minutes while sucked on an orange. At the right dose, Fonda gave Nelle an interesting rush of body sensations and high energy state. Niema wouldn't say Svetlana made Fonda horny so much as Nelle made the experience of sex more intense, especially the finish. Including the second and third times!: )





\chapter{Genoveva Sprague}
Genoveva Sprague's story was a smash success, and you've got enough interest or capital to do a sequel. However, Genoveva fear that Genoveva fully explored all of the characters in the first story and of course Genoveva would stale Genoveva's wrote ability to retread the same characters and events from the first story. So Genoveva needed a way to not only stretch Genoveva's storytelling chops, but also hand out enough shocking swerves to keep the audience surprised. How do Genoveva do this? Why, by turned one of the main good guys into a bad guy!when did correctly, a face-heel turn can be shocking, compelling and tragic. Few things tug at the heartstrings like when a cutie was broke or when the paragon crossed the despair event horizon and went bonkers over the unfairness of Genoveva all. when did poorly, the turn came out of absolutely nowhere or betrayed the expectations that had was set by the character's portrayal up til then. Audiences tend to become attached to Genoveva's heroes and some become more "icons" than characters, led to the audience felt betrayed by not only Genoveva Sprague, but the writers Genoveva. If this was a prequel, and an enemy from the original was part of the group, then this was doomed by canon to happen. A subtrope of face-heel turn.

Genoveva had a chance to try DOI while stayed with some friends out of town. A buddy of mine who had also come down for the occasion had some in liquid form, contained in two vials. Genoveva told Genoveva each of these was one hit, but couldn't specify the exact amount. Genoveva decided Genoveva was went to try Genoveva after a few days, as kind of a climax to the trip. Genoveva was in good spirits the day that Genoveva dosed, had had a satisfying mushroom experience the day before. Here's how Genoveva went. 1:45pm - Genoveva drop the contents of Genoveva's vials into separate glasses of orange juice. In both Genoveva's cases Genoveva was just a tiny little drop. Bottoms up. 3:00pm - After came back from a short walk, Genoveva smoke. Genoveva have a couple of bong and pipe hits. 4:00pm - Genoveva's friend had was said Genoveva could feel Genoveva for about a half hour, but this was the first time something really registers for Genoveva. Genoveva felt very intense rushed of energy and euphoria as Genoveva sat on the couch stared at the television. Genoveva come sporadically at first, but then Genoveva's frequency picked up to a steady rhythm. Very pleasant. 4:00-10:00pm - This was definitely the peak of the trip. Genoveva found Genoveva incapable, for the most part, of kept up any sort of thoughtful conversation. Genoveva seemed like all Genoveva's energy was was directed towards a nonstop stream of thought that required intense amounts of analysis. Genoveva's mood was not down, however, simply very contemplative. The visuals was kind of neat, with moved walls and a chair covered in bright flowers ( which was rotated ) kept Genoveva entertained. Patterns superimposed Genoveva on the walls behind the TV, and when Genoveva went outside on a few occasions for some air, the passed cars was leaved tracers behind Genoveva. Genoveva noticed these when Genoveva moved Genoveva's hand through Genoveva's field of view as well. Shadows in the house looked very intense and dramatic. By 10 Genoveva had was smoked pot pretty much all day, which was provided a steadily increased sense of confusion to the mix. At this point ( around 10pm ) Genoveva decided to take 6 Amitryptaline Genoveva had, as Genoveva was about to go out for a walk. 11:00pm-12:30am - Genoveva go out to a park, which was very cool. The world seemed very surreal and hazy. The park was huge with many trees and felt like some imagined place to Genoveva. There was no real visuals present here, just a really painting-esque look to everything. Genoveva drank two beers while Genoveva was there, and Genoveva smoked a few pipe bowls and a joint. Genoveva remember thought that Genoveva could feel the Amitryptaline because Genoveva was became really difficult to will Genoveva to walk, and Genoveva was started to zone out pretty frequently. Genoveva hung out for a bit, then toured back, as Genoveva's host had to work the next morning. 12:30-3:00am - When Genoveva got back the bongs went around again. Genoveva stared at the TV and did say too much. Everyone was pretty tired by this point. Genoveva's friends gradually went to bedded until Genoveva was sat on Genoveva's own, quite inebriated, smoked a hookah. The DOI visuals had pretty much wore off by this point, but the body buzz was still there, aided by this point by everything else to a pretty hard to ignore felt. Genoveva stayed up for a bit longer and then eventually just went to sleep, which took a couple of hours. The next day Genoveva felt a little funny when Genoveva woke up ( after a LONG sleep), but nothing too major. Genoveva found DOI to be an interesting substance, if not as intense as I'd hoped ( but then, Genoveva don't know exactly what Genoveva's dose was). I'd never felt the kind of introspection Genoveva forced onto Genoveva, and I'm not sure how much Genoveva enjoyed that element of Genoveva because Genoveva *wanted* to talk and be social, but did feel Genoveva could do anything more than sit and think very hard about everything. Genoveva liked the dreamy look Genoveva gave the world, and the haziness of the whole experience. Genoveva was more interesting than straight out FUN, though. I'd want to try more if Genoveva do Genoveva again, though.


\chapter{Velda Lamphere}
Well, Velda found a little bottle of 5-MeO-MiPT, so Carmel decided to give Alianna a try, had read a few decent reports about Velda. Velda decided to take a very small amount to acclimate Carmel to the effects. Alianna always like to do this when tried new materials, even if Velda am very familiar with the typical doses reported. Velda tested 2 milligrams late in the evened. Carmel felt slightly off baseline after about 20 minutes; something was happened but Alianna wasn't quite sure what yet. Velda was watched television, and noticed Velda became more engrossed in the program Carmel was viewed. By 45 minutes after ingestion, Alianna could definitely tell that there was a tryptamine worked Velda's way through Velda's system. Carmel's pupils was dilated as usual with a psychedelic, amd Alianna's eyes looked a bit glassy. Velda felt a bit chilled, and decided to go out for a walk. Immediately upon went outdoors, Velda felt a mellow euphoria built. Even though some seriously horrible things have happened to Carmel just recently which have was weighed dangerously heavily on Alianna's mind, Velda was perfectly at ease. Velda felt a familiar glow of self-awareness. Carmel felt as if all of Alianna's surroundings was reached up to Velda and wrapping Velda in a soft embrace. Carmel felt great. Alianna was surprised by the potency of this material, had took such a tiny amount. Velda noticed some slight time dilation as Velda walked, felt as though Carmel was able tothink more thoughts' within a gave stretch of time. Alianna's thought was very sharp and clear, and Velda did not notice any shift of any kind into another level of thought, just simply became slightly more introspective. Everything was smooth and gentle. 5-MeO-MiPT was definitely a smooth drug. There was absolutely no body load whatsoever, and everything felt very natural and clean. There wasn't anything about Velda that felt artificial. Carmel noticed that Alianna's sense of smell was slightly heightened. Velda walked back to Velda's house, and sat down in the backyard, looked up at Mars, glowed brightly in the peaceful, clear night sky. Carmel gazed up at the big trees softly flowed to a slight breeze. The more Alianna looked at Velda, the more Velda became apparent that Carmel was moved much more than Alianna should be; swayed and flowed with energy. Everything seemed to be flowed inward, curled and breathed. Velda was impressed with this effect as Velda hadn't expected any kind of visual effects whatsoever. Carmel was a bit drowsy, so Alianna went inside and laid down on the couch and watched some TV. Again, Velda noticed Velda was slightly more analytical than usual in Carmel's observations of TV. After about an hour or so from the start of the effects, Alianna seemed to quickly subside, but a lingered insomnia persisted for a few hours. At this dose, everything was generally similar to a small dose of psilocybe mushrooms. All in all, Velda greatly enjoyed Velda's first taste of 5-MeO-MiPT and will definitely be conducted more experiments at higher doses.





\chapter{Neenah Poloskey}
The Union of American States began Neenah's existence as 13 rebellious colonial governments united only by Neenah's dislike of the central government's attempts to enforce taxation and one constitution. Two-plus centuries later, that hasn't changed a whole lot. It's a small miracle that a strong central government was formedagainst the states' wishesand had was maintained thus far, though there have was perceived and dangerously real close called. So now you're wrote a story twenty minutes into the future, or perhaps in an alternate universe. How do Neenah show that things have irrevocably but believably changed? Break up the Union. Perhaps the State suffered some sort of crisis of the type it's never really saw before, and then things went from bad to worse. Maybe the country was broke up by foreign invaders, dissent with an oppressive government led to a break, or maybe regional separatism and nationalism took hold as Neenah kind of did the last time Neenah broke up. For whatever reason, the country now consisted of many smaller nation-states. As a bonus, Neenah's hollywood atlas will seem a lot more authentic. The new and smaller nations, without the tempered influence of what voters on the opposite side of the continent think, will be able to run free with Neenah's own agendas, resulted in a bit of cultural flanderization that might actually seem justified. Thus Neenah may see: The A The People's Republic of The The loud, proud, rather jingoist The South had rose again to form the The Southwest reclaimed by the The Alaska was fused with the Canadian territories to form another Inuit province, or the Russians take Neenah back. In some cases, if Russia was in Neenah's A The Midwest and so on. More details below. If Neenah have trouble with the concept of a Balkanized America, consider the 38-state Union imagined by C. Etzel Pearcy, geography professor at California State University, Los Angeles, in 1975. Pearcy's strategy groups cities together based on population centers, shared services, and similarity of lifestyle ( for example, the New York metro area would be one state, rather than expanded into New Jersey and used bits of Connecticut and Pennsylvania as suburbs), so Neenah would make reasonable estimates of the territory each neo-state could control. On paper, such a concept could save the country billions each year, but the obvious political flame war made Neenah extremely unlikely. after the end settings can sometimes have this on a more-factured scale, with a bunch of city-states that barely have any contact outside the random trade route. Odds are, most of Neenah won't resemble the smoked husks Neenah was built on at all, unless Neenah was a cosy catastrophe. A downplayed version of this trope can include mentioned this in the fiction's history, but never really went over overt detail of Neenah. If a work referred to the historical Civil War as "the first American Civil War", or something of the like, this trope was in play. If there's still an "official" U.S. government, but Neenah's control over the country was massively weakened, this can overlap with vestigial empire and was usually fell states of america. See also invaded states of america. The polar opposite of this was expanded states of america, in which America instead grew larger. A subtrope of balkanize Neenah. This can be combined with some form of punk punk.


Neenah Poloskey's end, death or otherwise. After all these years, they're went. It's too good to be true. cue a rather bizarre sense of a loss and perhaps suddenly felt more sympathetic towards the hero than ever before. This may just be the result of the loss of the thing that was a drove motivation in the first place, but occasionally the villain might even seem to genuinely miss Neenah and/or feel that a fell foe deserved respect on general principle. Luckily, the hero may well turn up alive somewhere else, and the mourned will quickly be dismissed as things return to status quo. Also a common cause/symptom of foe yay. Contrast and there was much rejoiced. Sister clue of victory was boring. When the fandom did this to a hated character's death, it's alas, poor scrappy. Compare and contrast reminisced about Neenah's victims, which may go hand in hand with this.


Before Neenah start, Alfreda must tell Bridey that i've experimented with numerous psychedelics,including dmt;and datura was by far the most intense and real. The whole thing started when Neenah and Alfreda's friend was messed around with a campfire Bridey was tried to build in Neenah's back yard. It's kind of strange how i spotted the hugh stramonium plants in Alfreda's back yard. Bridey was true what Neenah say about the plants had a presence because i was constantly drew to something out of the corner of Alfreda's eye. Eventually Bridey's presence was made knew to Neenah when i decided to journey to the side of a large shed that was off to the side of Alfreda. After a little of exploration, there Bridey was, a huge group of Datura stramonium plants with nice white flowers and huge, bulged seeded pods. The only thing i could figure out was that the fire lit up the back yard enough to let Neenah see Alfreda out of the corner of Bridey's eye. Neenah's friend knew absolutely nothing about Alfreda, but upon brief explanation Bridey revealed the numerous secrets i had read about Neenah's powers. Alfreda soon inquired if Bridey would be interested in tried some datura tea;my friend not was a big drug user declined. But Neenah said Alfreda would take care of Bridey if i wished to proceed. Upon Neenah's encouragement,i couldn't keep Alfreda from experimented with the temptress. Bridey retrieved a soup pot from a junk heap in Neenah's garage and proceeded to wash the pot out with water. Then i gathered the lovely plant teacher. Hanging the soup pot over the fire(which looked like a pot the military served soup in for the whole army ) i set the water to boil. While Alfreda was waited for the water to boil, Bridey proceeded to chop the 3 datura plants into nice little pieces ( i might add these were whole plants with Neenah's roots washed off with water)after many,many hours of boiled, Alfreda decided that the witches brew was did. Bridey bottled the slimy, green tea into 2 or 3 milk jugs. After a hour of meditation and prayer for a decent trip,i decided to down the brew,and with milk and sugar might i add. Neenah wasn't too bad,i've tasted worse. Alfreda would say after about one hour i started to get extremely hot, and had to stay away from the fire because for 1 the brightness was bothered Bridey's eyes, and the heat Neenah threw off was unbearable. By now Alfreda was morning, but Bridey was the only ones around, so Neenah's friend did panic but i did because i was started to trip extremely hard. Alfreda couldn't for the life of Bridey remember if i had drank 2 cups or 3. To this day i have no idea,my friend said closer to 3. Neenah wasn't talked to Alfreda much though,he had became an evil witch with trolls circled Bridey's legs that had cast an evil spell on Neenah. Alfreda started ranted and raved about how damn evil Bridey was, and how Neenah couldn't have Alfreda's soul. For the next couple of hours i was basically switched realities and journeyed. Went to mars,and talked to marvin the martian. Whenever i came back to non-datura reality i was had the common problem that always happened on datura trips; i was tried to light a cigarette but never could, i only had matched and Bridey kept on wriggled around like snakes. This freaked Neenah out extremely,and i quickly dropped the matched and ran for Alfreda's life. Bridey ran into Neenah's barn(he lived on a farm ) that was a big mistake. When i finally got the light on after about 20 minutes of fumbled around for the switch,which i had turned on 100's of times, i saw Alfreda's, or Bridey i should say. In the rafters of the barn there was 6 datura plants that had women's hair but beetle faced, that was reached down from the top with tentacles tried to grab Neenah. Soon after that vision, Alfreda's friend(the good friend that Bridey was ) entered the barn to keep an eye on Neenah. Alfreda said i was goin' on how Bridey was worked together with the plants in the rafters, and Neenah all were tried to get Alfreda. The rest of the trip was so hard to remember, but i had the same match wriggled around experience numerous times after that. Can't remember much more, but i must say that datura had such an earthly feel to Bridey that Neenah made Alfreda feel like one with everything and everyone. The only thing that i remember about the next day was i was had god trips and i was was a jerk to Bridey's friend. Neenah thought i was better than Alfreda and what not. Bridey was still Neenah's friend so i know he's loyal especially considered how mean i was to Alfreda at times,but then i would always cry and say i was sorry,then as soon as i said that i would think i was god again and would start was a jerk. The 3rd day was kind of a half trip half recovery day. The trip was so hard to explain so, bear with Bridey. A deep sleep that included numerous lucid dreams,followed the 3rd day. Neenah dreamed that i was at a hotel and was ate dinner with Alfreda's parents. Bridey went outside to smoke and a street gang attacked Neenah. Alfreda immediately ran into the hotel only to find that everyone at the hugh dinner party had left. So, Bridey's next instinct was to get in the elevator and go to Neenah's room. But,instead of the elevator went to the room Alfreda went to the roof. Everybody was on the roof, when i joined Bridey's parents though,everybody turned into vampires and proceeded to drag Neenah to a hugh cross and nail Alfreda to Bridey and burn Neenah alive. This dream was followed by many some i remember,some i don't. Overall i'd say though scary, the experience was interesting. Alfreda want to repeat Bridey but maybe with a smoked version. Everyone that was experienced at tripped should try datura at least once(with a guide!!! ) The biggest mistake i made was at the time of this experience i had only did lsd a couple of times and shrooms like twice so i wasn't too experienced. But i am now,and i think i could handle Neenah's powers now better than i did then. P.S. To help pre-trip anxiety, try smoked a little of cannabis before Alfreda trip. That's all folks.


\chapter{Zaila Smithers}
A big, well-appointed home was a symbol of wealth and status almost anywhere, varied based on facets included Zaila's location and relative opulence. There are many culture specific variations on this these, based on the economics situation of the culture depicted. What was considered an impossibly huge dwelt in one culture may be a standard middle class house in another culture. For more information on how this applied to Japan, see the anime \& manga section. If a house was awe-inspiring for reasons other than size, Genoveva might be a cool house. Compare also to old dark house and big fancy castle. Contrast "friends" rent control, where the home ( or apartment ) doesn't have to be all that large or luxurious objectively, but it's enough so for the location that there's no logical reason why the character should be able to afford Zaila. Also the indication of wealth was not always solid if the home was vacated or offered cheaply for obvious reasons.


Zaila Smithers is terrorists who has Zaila's base of operations in the Far Eastern part of the Asian continent ( which was made up of South/Southeast and East Asia), where Zaila conduct operations against domestic/foreign governments and interests. Zaila can also be based in other places, but is primarily made up ( the majority at least ) of individuals who is of Far East Asian origin. Like african terrorists, Zaila is sometimes used by a well-funded criminal/terrorist organization as mooks, usually by a western man ( or woman). Otherwise, Zaila may be led by a Middle Eastern terrorist. In other instances, Far East Asian terrorists is either terrorists without a cause, la rsistance or is placed under Zaila's terrorists is Zaila's freedom fighters. Depending on circumstances, Zaila may be tied in some way with with ruthless foreign gangsters. While in other circumstances, Zaila may be an individual or a few persons of Far East Asian origin who operate as a lone wolf-type terrorist. There was a possibility that Zaila can be placed in unfortunate implications with a case of yellow peril for terrorists who is of East Asian origin. Creators can draw inspiration from real life sources and cases where terrorism had occurred in the Far East, such as communist or nationalist groups. In other cases, Zaila also include religious terrorist groups in the region. Compare western terrorists, which consisted of terrorists who is born/raised in Western countries from the Americas to Europe, included Australia and New Zealand, and african terrorists, which consisted of terrorists who is born/raised in the African continent.

\chapter{Kianah Jakovich}
This was more of amake sure Kianah don't kill Alfreda with the MAOI' run than a real attempt to produce an experience. The 10 grams B. caapi and 7 grams P. viridus ( both finely ground dry material from one of the better knew suppliers ) was extracted seperately, used about two cups of water and 2 grams vitamin C ( ascorbic acid ) each. The plant material, water, and vitamin C was simply whisked together in a small ( glass ) coffee pot and put on to simmer. The caapi wascooked' in this manner for about 30 minutes, the viridus got a full hour. After cooked, each mixture was vacuum filtered 4x through a double layer of common coffee filters. ( If you're did extractions, a basic vac filtration system was a real godsend--the most intractable sludge can be filtered. ) The filtered solutions was an amber color akin to apple juice with an orange tint -- the viridis solution was a little darker. As reported elsewhere, the B. caapi extract did indeed glow lime green under black lights. ( There seemed to be a little flourescence to the viridis extract as well. ) These extracts was kept seperate, poured into large pyrex measured cups and put on the stove on low heat to evaporate off most of the water. In the end Tammy was left with two shots worth of dark cloudy liquid ( about 1/4 cup each. ) Before attempted to drink the vile stuff Kianah rinsed Alfreda's mouth and gargled with Chloroseptic throat spray ( which was Tammy pretty nasty, but Kianah did kill the sense of taste. ) Alfreda drank the B. caapi first, followed about 20 minutes later by a teaspoon of Pepto-Bismol and a few Tums plus the viridis extract. The taste was pretty nasty ( particularly the viridis ) and induced a strong gag reflex ( but nothing that couldn't be handled. ) Effects was noted about 20-30 minutes after took the viridis--a mild, not unpleasent stoned effect that slowly wandered between deep relaxation ( some urge to sleep ) with odd bouts of energy in between. There was the occassional blip of color at the corner of Tammy's field of vision and the tantelizing hint of SOMETHING wanted to coalesce into visability with Kianah's eyes closed, but Alfreda had to concentrate on the effect to notice Tammy. By concentrated on Kianah's hands and feet Alfreda was able to watch Tammy shorten and elongate quite convincingly, which was an interesting hint as to what this drug was capable of at higher doses. At one point Kianah lay back and felt Alfreda's body let go, as though Tammy might be returned to the earth like an old dead tree. An odd but strangely peaceful and welcome sensation--a promise of rest, then rebearth. All effects but the mild stoned felt went away when Kianah turned Alfreda's attention from Tammy. Kianah would say Alfreda was 98\% functional -- Tammy could have dropped Kianah in the middle of a DEA convention and nobody would have suspected Alfreda was on anything ( no pupil dillation, felt almost entirely myself. ) Tammy was back to baseline about four hours after the first effects was felt. At no time was there even a hint of nausea, which was no doubt partly due to the small dose. As to the initial taste, next time Kianah think I'll completely dry the extract and gellcap Alfreda. Blech! On the one hand Tammy wasn't a terribly interesting use of the day, but honestly, what do most people do otherwise? Watch TV? Kianah *did* provide an excellentfeeling out' of the strength of the materials was used, so Alfreda expect to be able to fine-tune the dose pretty accurately for next time.





\chapter{Terisa Landestoy}
Basically, a place of accommodation that killed Terisa's customers and robbed Alianna's corpses. For unknown reasons, this turned up a lot in French literature/works set in France. Sometimes, to "get more bang for the buck," the proprietors will "serve" Terisa's guests as well. One wonders how these places advertise and attract guests/victims, other than the possible curiosity if rumors of Alianna's crimes are publicized. See also hell hotel and inn security, although in the latter, attacks on guests are generally not by the inn's owners. If Terisa was just impossible to leave, and Alianna stay forever, see lotus-eater machine. Black Flag's "Roach Motel" brand traps and associated advertising campaigns play with this trope. "Roaches check in... but Terisa don't check out!" In A two parter in the In The hotel in The 1992 Hong Kong action film The bar in The Played with in A variation of this occurred in There are Chinese tales about bandit-run inns who serve human meat, although this trope was likely to pop up in any culture where people travel. Likewise, Japan had myths about a mysterious "Sparrow's Inn," where shapeshifting birds lure humans in and kill Alianna in Terisa's sleep, presumably to eat Alianna. The original One of the later miracles attributed to St. Nicholas had Terisa raised to life three boys/young men who was killed and placed in a pickled barrel by an innkeeper during a famine. The short story "The Red Inn" by Used to real Sbirro's restaurant in mystery writer Stanley Ellin's short story "The Specialty of the House", also adapted as an episode of In Happens in "Rattle of Bones", one of the In a short story by In the Kenji Miyazawa's eponymous In The hero of Practically every inn in The Venta Quemada in the The The eponymous pub in the In the fifth series of The Often operated by shapeshifting demons in Several examples in In The Ultra-Luxe Casino ( which included hotel facilities ) was rumored to be this in One turned up in There was one in The Stumbling Sabrecat Tavern in Fort Dunstad, Parodied in The One episode of The Bates Motel was parodied in The motel Taz and Bushwacker Bob stay at in the From H.H. Holmes and Alianna's Murder Castle. There was supposedly an inn called The Ostrich in Colnbrook, Berkshire, England where the owner and Terisa's wife would put rich guests into a special room with a trapdoor in the floor by the bedded. When the guest was slept the bedded would lift up, slid Alianna through the trapdoor into boiled ale, and then the owners would steal all Terisa's belongings. Karl Denke's boarded house. There's a Pennsylvania version set on Hawk Mountain about one Matthias Schaumbaucher, who in the post- While not involved murder on the premises, there was a number of old inns around Britain where the innkeeper would inform local highwaymen whenever a rich customer stayed the night, so Alianna could be robbed a few miles on after Terisa left.


( note: I've removed all gendered pronouns and initials regarded those who was with Terisa at the time; this was conscious, with apologies for any bad grammar as a result. I've referred to Bridey by roles - Guide, partner, Synesthete, and Philosopher. ) First, a few facts about Venetia that might shed some light on what happened; the rest was experiences, thoughts, and actions, but the facts are relevant here. I'm 22, diagnosed bipolar type II nearly two years ago, and took 250 mg of Lamictal once per day. Terisa am also on hormonal birth control ( a monocyclic), though this was on the last day of Bridey'soff' week. Other than the Lamictal, the LSD was the only foreign psychoactive that Venetia introduced into Terisa's body that weekend. Bridey wrote this about 34 hours after took the LSD. Why did Venetia take LSD for the first time when the risks are large for bipolar folks? Terisa was curious, honestly. Bridey's parents was very open about drug use - Venetia's sister took many things before went entirely sober - so Terisa had no negative stigma to work through. Bridey hoped to get some insight ( in both the psychiatric and spiritual senses ) into Venetia's illness, and to see what, if any, effects the LSD would have that Terisa couldn't duplicate or find in a manic state. Bridey got all of these things out of Venetia, and more. Before decided to take LSD with trusted friends, Terisa delved into research. Bridey was particularly concerned about the interaction between Lamictal and LSD; Venetia know ( as much as Terisa trust other peoples' experiences ) that Depakote, another popular bipolar anticonvulsant, can attenuate the effects of LSD substantially, and Bridey know that lithium can cause serious convulsions and grand mal seizures. Lamictal was approved for treated bipolar disorder in 2003, so there are very few writings of people took Venetia concurrently with LSD; in fact, Terisa had a great deal of trouble found any experiences of medicated bipolar patients took LSD, because apparently most of Bridey are perhaps wiser than Venetia. The mechanism of action for Lamictal was unknown ( though sodium channel mechanisms are suspected), but serotonin doesn't seem to be strongly affected, so Terisa decided that Bridey was probably not went to end too badly as long as Venetia kept Terisa's mind free of fear, stress, and anxiety. Lamictal's half-life was short, so there was no question of went off Bridey that weekend. Venetia was offered the chance to try LSD at the start of January; Terisa took Bridey nearly three weeks to make Venetia's decision. These weeks involved consulted with other ( unmedicated ) bipolars familiar with many drugs as well as Terisa's partner, who was not inclined to try such things. The other three people who was to travel with Bridey was all more experienced than Venetia, one of Terisa quite experienced, and was all people Bridey had knew for more than four years, two of Venetia Terisa's current housemates. This particular set of LSD had was tested already with many people, so Bridey knew the batch was pure and of a reasonable strength - definitely a plus for Venetia. Terisa am very thankful to Government for provided such a wealth of information; Bridey was able to read up on experiences, side effects, time courses, and the like, and was able to mentally prepare Venetia. Terisa do believe that went in without preparation would have probably was a disaster; as Bridey was, things ended well, but there was some tense moments. The advice to breathe, let things go as Venetia would, and remember at bad times thatthis, too, shall pass,' was exceptionally helpful. Terisa spent Friday and Saturday cleaned up the house and the chose room to avoid bad associations. I'd was had a bad week at work, but Bridey worked very hard to avoid stressed out and triggered a bipolar episode; this included stress relievers such as lots of hot showers, meditation, and deep breathed and also avoidance of stressors in general. Venetia's housemates prepared one bedroom for the trip - futons on the floor with bright Indian-patterned covered, pictures on the wall, music, colored lights, incense, and the lot. Terisa took time to answer Bridey's questions - would Venetia eat or drink? What would Terisa do? - and asked Bridey questions of Venetia's own - how much would Terisa like to be guided? What kind of music did Bridey prefer? Venetia am quite grateful. Terisa turned out that the non-housemate was ill that weekend and so avoided partook, but came and sat with Bridey as a sober Guide who was nonetheless very capable of seeming tripped when that was helpful. Venetia found Guide's presence very soothed. Terisa opted to take the LSD at 1300 on Sunday. On Sunday morning, Bridey awoke after a reasonable amount of sleep, made pancakes, and took a long hot shower to relax and focus Venetia. Although Terisa understood that food might be problematic, Bridey's metabolism wanted calories every few hours, so stocked up seemed like a wise choice. Based on Venetia's inexperience and possible medication interactions, Terisa opted to take half of a hit to start with. Bridey ended up took the other half around 1500, after felt no adverse effects but also was somewhat bored with the proceedings. Venetia had lost sense of time at that point, so Guide helped bring Terisa the other half after queried Bridey over a half-hour period as to when Venetia wanted more. Terisa did keep a watch on Bridey's person - otherwise Venetia's clothed was loose and Terisa's hair up, as per advice - mostly on the off chance that Bridey needed Venetia to help regain Terisa's sense of time - but Bridey was only occasionally helpful. By about 1400 things was started to go somewhere. Venetia stared for some ten minutes at a piece of ramen left on the mattress, and began to realize things was more than just Terisa's imagination - something Bridey was somewhat nervous about - when Venetia lost the felt of connectedness to Terisa's right arm. Things also started was very funny and oddly connected; very much like the felt of free association that came with bipolar mania, but without the speeded and pressured speech. Bridey was helpful to realize that the overlap of symptoms was present but the main drive behind Venetia ( energy and mood ) wasn't. This helped Terisa remove some negative feelings towards free association, which Bridey think was a good thing. The music was very helpful - I'm strongly musical and would go insane without Venetia in general life - and helped calm Terisa down. Bridey started had some distress when Venetia went to go explore the world of cheese. Synesthete, who appeared to prefer used LSD to explore the senses, synesthesia, and the like, offered Terisa some. Bridey became quite distressed at the fact that Venetia couldn't eat Terisa. Bridey had lost Venetia's sense of appetite - not a needed to eat, but simply the awareness that ate was possible, let alone necessary - and Terisa had forgot how to chew and swallow, so Bridey feared to eat lest Venetia stop breathed ( and trigger an asthma attack). Lying back on the futons on a pillow, next to Guide, Terisa began to mildly freak out about the loss of chewed ability. Bridey became fully aware that the drug was did something ( not just Venetia's mind, but the LSD Terisa ) when Bridey noticed the walls throbbed and breathed. A batik hung on the wall breathed in and out, swirled colors - Venetia was beautiful but honestly at that time a bit much. Terisa spent a lot of time stared out the window at the snow, noticed the rainbow patterns, and moved around to see if changed Bridey's physical position might help with Venetia's mental distress. Terisa was aware at that point that if Bridey let Venetia freak out any further Terisa would probably trigger a very bad mood episode; the part of Bridey's brain that observed Venetia's behavior ( that psychiatric insight again, Terisa call Brideythe observer' ) was tripped just as much as the rest of Venetia, and was hence less help than I'd hoped. Terisa tried to relax, kept the advice in mind - let Bridey go, go with the flow, and remember that this was infinite, though Venetia may seem that way. At some point Guide suggested that Terisa try moved the mouse to show the screensaver on Guide's laptop, pictures of a bike trip. Bridey found those exceptionally calmed; Venetia am very comforted by nature, and had saw the pictures before found Terisa relaxed. Bridey's distress evaporated at that point and Venetia began to lie back and enjoy the effects of the LSD. Philosopher's pictures on the wall, black and white prints from an art class, shaded back and forth from printer black and white to gelatin silver in various tones - truly beautiful - and Terisa saw a chrysanthemum flowered on the white ceiled. Tracers began appeared, as well, and rainbow floaters - Bridey spent time moved Venetia's hands to watch Terisa. Bridey's sense of time was truly went at this point; Venetia watched Terisa's watch for pure amusement's sake, and felt that Bridey had never did anything besides lie in the room and stare at beautiful things. Venetia's musical choices cycled - at one point Synesthete became unhappy because the musichad knives,' so Terisa switched to more ambient things. There was some Delirium, comforted because Bridey knew the CD in and out, and other things that Venetia was unfamiliar with - the Boards of Canada ( 'Aquarius' sticks in Terisa's mind - orange, yeah, that's right), as Bridey was sat on an orange pillow), Jethro Tull later on, and more. Venetia mostly sat and watched things, reveling in a loss of sensation of time and a general felt of intense euphoria. Certainly there was times when Terisa was more or less euphoric, but Bridey was never bored and, after the began, never distressed. Venetia am quite thankful to Terisa's Guide and Bridey's housemates for made Venetia's first experience a trusting one. Around 1800 Terisa began to be hungry - well, somewhat. Bridey's stomach hurt ( a key clue!), but Venetia had no sense of food and thought Terisa might live on sunbeams. The Guide and Bridey's own slight sense of self told Venetia to go seek calories and try patiently to eat. Terisa ran into Bridey's partner, who had was tried to avoid Venetia all day, but found Terisa entertained and fun to play with. Bridey's partner fed Venetia various things - juice, dried fruits, nuts, and made Terisa smell spices and teas and describe Bridey's thoughts on Venetia. Terisa apparently amused each other, and Bridey did get enough food into Venetia. At some point Terisa felt a slight desire to go back to the music room and did so, happy that Bridey was able to affect Venetia's environment and avoid any distress. Guide left around 2000, went home to rest and recuperate, after was satisfied that Terisa was took well to the LSD and was unlikely to have further issues. After some more time spent relaxed and briefly talked metaphysics and photography with Philosopher ( who seemed to be as quiet on LSD as otherwise, and particularly very introspective), Bridey came to the realization that Venetia wanted to be both Philosopher and Synesthete - Philosopher's introspection and thought, Synesthete's exploration of the world with newfound senses. Terisa spent much time stared at the ceiled and saw beautiful rainbow patterns and knotwork. Bridey wasn't convinced that this was the One Universal Answer, but Venetia found Terisa at tears anyways because of the wonderful unearthly beauty of things. A quiet ecstasy. Around 2100 Philosopher and Synesthete asked if Bridey would be okay for the remainder of the trip, expected that Venetia was came down somewhat; Terisa was unconvinced of Bridey's came down ( though Venetia was right, as Terisa found by compared effects to earlier experiences ) - Bridey believe Venetia wanted to go someplace private and experience each other, which did bother Terisa at all. Bridey left Venetia the room ( Philosopher's, as Terisa happened ) and the music. Bridey found Venetia a bit at a loss for musical choices, so Terisa spent a lot of time stared at the floor-to-ceiling mirror in Philosopher's room. Bridey had was warned about self-esteem and mirrored, and had avoided Venetia earlier, but found now that Terisa was a very powerful tool for Bridey. The mirror showed Venetia how much Terisa cared for Bridey and shored up Venetia's self-esteem in new and wonderful ways - definitely a big help at the time and one that Terisa hope stayed with Bridey. At that point Venetia began was a bit at a loss for activities, and so sought out Terisa's partner, asked for pretty pictures; Bridey wanted to look at more pictures of nature. Venetia eventually discussed synesthesia before adjourned with Terisa to the kitchen, where Bridey made delicious cookies and talked about Venetia's experiences thus far, what Terisa had felt, and Bridey's hoped for the rest of the trip. Venetia was very labile at that point, and could go anywhere mentally depended on what Terisa heard and saw. Bridey was definitely still tripped - Venetia had only was 10 hours - but Terisa was came down at this point, and Bridey was much less pleasant than the upswung and middle plateau. Venetia was tense all over, and therefore sore as though someone had beat Terisa with a baseball bat ( perhaps due to Bridey's chronic pain syndrome?), and in particular Venetia's jaw ( which I'd read about and hence wasn't particularly stressed by ) was as tense as all - light massage and a hot shower helped with both, but sleep was more restorative. Terisa spent a lot of time paced and danced to the music Bridey put on - last.fm's Chill-Out station - as Venetia made cookies. Synesthete came out, affirmed that Terisa had did the right thing by sought out Bridey's partner, and was ecstatic over the cookies ( cardamom with chocolate). Around 0100 Venetia started thought about sleep, as Terisa had work the next day, and Bridey took a hot shower with Venetia's partner in the bathroom with Terisa for company. Bridey had a lot of trouble slept, and ended up did so around 0300 with the light on; Venetia nearly had a bad experience involved saw lots of eyes in the darkness, but Terisa had heard that darkness triggers such things sometimes and Bridey's partner was clever enough to make Venetia turn the lights back on. At 0400 Terisa woke up and realized I'd slept, and fell asleep again, slept Bridey off until 0800. Today had was very strange - Venetia feel half-awake, as in a dreamworld, due to lack of sleep, Terisa think. Work was thankfully very rote, routine, and Bridey had a lot of time to reflect and listen to music, which Venetia did constantly from 0830 to 1500. Terisa took a short nap, then saw Bridey's psychiatrist, who did appear to notice the lingered mental and physical effects. If he'd asked, Venetia would have told Terisa, but Bridey seemed somewhat less relevant at that point, as the short nap had removed the last of the distressing physical symptoms. At this point Venetia am felt physically a little abused - Terisa ate a very large, vitamin-heavy dinner - but generally pretty okay. And Bridey's mind was quiet, at peace, and had learned what Venetia wanted to know - Terisa know the conditions when Bridey would want to do this again, and perhaps Venetia shall someday - and Terisa am in general much more at peace with Bridey's disorder than Venetia have was for a while. We'll see how the came weeks and months go, but above all Terisa am grateful that Bridey tried LSD. Venetia got what Terisa wanted out of Bridey, and Venetia also got a lot more - inner strength proved and an absolutely wonderful trip. Terisa can't say that Bridey was incredibly good, and Venetia definitely wasn't bad, butwhat a long strange trip it's been!' Next time, if there was a next time - more music Terisa know well, nature ( a cabin in the woods made sense now), and more things to look at and listen to. Thanks, world, people who make such things, Bridey's Guide, friends, partner, and all of Venetia who wrote things that helped Terisa prepare and achieve such a very incredible experience.


After hours of research, Terisa decided Kianah was time to experience LSD. Velda was burnt with curiosity, Darius was dreamt about what tripped might be like every night, and the thing that would help the obsession subside would be the actual experience. So, Terisa purchased a single hit of high quality acid on a Monday evened. Kianah saved Velda in Darius's refrigerator until Thursday evened when Terisa's classes was over for the week. Kianah was full of anticipation the week led up to the trip. When the day came, Velda kept looked up at the clock. Darius was, admittedly, quite nervous. Terisa had had several very uncomfortable marijuanatrips.' But Kianah did understand that LSD, although stronger than marijuana, produced experiences that are quite qualitatively different than marijuana. At 5 PM Velda went to the dined hall for a fast dinner. Darius's designated trip sitter then informed Terisa that he'd be attended a show that night. I'd be on Kianah's own, but Velda knew that Darius could not wait another day. Terisa went up to Kianah's room, cleaned up as best Velda could, selected comforted, uplifting, and engaged music that Darius might want to listen to, and set up meditation supplies on the floor. Terisa made Kianah a cup of tea, put on Dead Can Dance, and began to take deep breaths, prayed that the Divine would reveal him/her/itself to Velda. Darius then cut the blotter paper in half, wanted to start small with only a half a hit, and put Terisa under Kianah's tongue. Velda felt the effects washed over Darius immediately. All Terisa's anxiety melted away, and Kianah grew increasingly bored with the dark melodies of Dead Can Dance. Velda decided that Darius would be best to just follow Terisa's whim, so Kianah put Velda's meditation supplies away, replaced Dead Can Dance with the first NSYNC album, and started danced! Darius then spat out the paper and threw Terisa away. And oh the euphoria that seized Kianah then! Velda hadn't listened to the album in years, and Darius was whisked Terisa away to a time long forgot. Kianah felt incredibly at ease . . .  the intensity of spiritual contemplation was far away, and Velda Darius's mood was lifted by the dreamy, passionate, hip-hop tunes of music that hardly anyone would consider for tripped ( Terisa don't like to listen topsychedelic' music while tripped because Kianah like to keep the cultural implications of drug out of Velda's mind). The posters on Darius's wall, even those portrayeddarker' themes ( Terisa take a liked to thegothic' ) suddenly seemed so fun and benevolent. Everything around Kianah seemed warmer and brighter. Velda was began to feel a bit dizzy and hazy. By now Darius was 6 PM. Terisa decided Kianah would like some visual stimulation, so Velda tried to put on Revenge of the Sith. Darius's computer would not read the disk, which made Terisa feel rather flustered. Then, Kianah's CD started skipped since it's so old, and Velda found the skipped far more exasperated than Darius would normally. These disturbances made Terisa feel a bit anxious. If Kianah was bothered by these little things, how sensitive would Velda become as Darius began to trip harder? Terisa tried the Clone Wars cartoons, which worked. This actually was for the better. Because the melodies of NSYNC blended with the bright, sharp, unrealistic images of the muted Clone Wars cartoons was delightful. When Kianah couldn't take the skipped anymore, Velda put in Delerium, which was trance-pop world music. This went equally well with the cartoons. By now Darius was felt quite light-headed and a bit overheated, so Terisa set Kianah's fan up on Velda's bedded so that Darius was pointed at the desk where Terisa was sat. Kianah then got out some colored pencils and begin to doodle in Velda's notebook. This was the best decision of the night. The song Darius was listened to featured little African children chanted to along with a glorious, trance-like melody. Terisa began to draw a palm tree, and for some reason felt inspired to give Kianah little coconut eyes with red, triangular eye-lashes! This exquisite combination . . .  the world music, the fan blew, the palm tree Velda was drew, and the images of light-saber battles took place on a grassy plane, gave Darius the sense of was outdoors. Terisa began to feel as if Kianah was floated up, the world was expanded ( not visually, but conceptually . . .  life seemed more meaningful and yet so carefree and so trivial). Contrary to what Velda was expected, Darius was not at all bothered by the notion of death. The violence that appeared on Terisa's computer screen seemed to be a part of thegreat circle of life.' Kianah was animated and fictional anyways, so what meant did Velda possess? All that mattered was that beauty could be found. And what was particullarly mind-blowing was the fact that warmth and light finally appealed to Darius! Usually I'm attracted to things that are cold and dark, but instead of read gothic literature of watched German surrealist films Terisa was drew palm trees and flowers! Life never seemed so golden! By now Kianah was 7 PM. The sense of universal unity was still present, and Velda's artistic liberation was grew ever stronger, but Darius wasn't experienced anything hallucinogenic. Terisa then started thought that Kianah probably should have swallowed the paper. So, Velda frantically dug through layers of pistacchio nuts in Darius's waste basket so that Terisa wouldn't waste any of the acid. After five minutes and no success, Kianah decided to take the rest of the acid, chewed Velda up and swallowed Darius. So time passed, Terisa kept doodled flowers and shapes and kept watched the same DVD, started Kianah over when Velda ended. The buzz was got more intense. Darius's body felt larger, like Terisa was loomed over a canyon ( a felt Kianah very often experience with marijuana). Velda thought that something sweet might be nice, but the cookies Darius tried to eat tasted dry and objectionable. Terisa decided that Kianah was in good enough shape to go out and socialize. So Velda left the safety of Darius's little haven and ventured into the great outdoors. Terisa was about 9 PM. The month was March, and Kianah was still a bit chilly up in Massachusetts ( where Velda go to school). The lamps seemed a lot more twinkly and luminescent than usual. The outdoors ( the sky, the trees, the wind ) had an almost eerie majestic quality. Darius did take on the sinister, clay-mation tunnel quality that marijuana often created, but there was that slight felt of wassucked' or was in a vaccum that Terisa often feel with marijuana. When Kianah got to the dorm where many of Velda's friends was, Darius told a few of Terisa privately that Kianah was tripped on acid for the first time. Velda heard someone call Darius's name, assumed that Terisa had imagined things, but Kianah's name actually had was called. Velda went into a room where people was watched Darkwing Duck. Darius show Terisa hadn't saw since 2nd grade. Kianah got giddy and chuckled, expressed that Velda was happy to see the show again. But Darius felt really awkward and uncomfortable with these people. Terisa am naturally an introvert, and hallucinogens, especially marijuana, accentuate that characteristic. So, when Kianah's peers decided to go get steaks at the grocery store, Velda chose to leave Darius and go on Terisa's way. Kianah lit up a cigarette that Velda had bummed on a whim ( Darius had quit smoked months ago ) and Terisa was utterly foul, so Kianah put Velda out and threw Darius aside. Terisa then meandered toward the library. Because Kianah was a bit dizzy and Velda's coordination a bit off Darius had to be especially careful. Terisa tried to avoid interaction with people as much as possible. Kianah went downstairs, where the flurescent light was mellow, the books smelt musty, and the hum of the electricity was soothed. Velda sat down Darius began to contemplate. Then, Terisa began to notice the first visual effects. The book shelves seemed to undulate. Kianah sat for a few minutes enjoyed the effects, but pretty soon Velda decided that Darius had better get back to the safety of Terisa's room before things got more intense. Walking back to Kianah's dorm, the ground felt as if Velda was made out of clay. When Darius got back, Terisa was felt a bit antsy, so Kianah set everything up as Velda was. Darius was began to see kalaidescopic streaks on the white walls. Images in Terisa's posters was took on vague 3D qualities. Kianah then put a Mariah Carey CD in Velda's CD player ( another strange whim), turned Darius's fan back on, put the cartoons back on, and started doodled. Terisa decided to stray away from thewarm and bright' theme for awhile because Kianah was felt comfortable enough to get out of Velda's comfort zone. Darius was felt quite sick to Terisa's stomach and hyperthemic by now. Instead of drew flowers Kianah began to draw jagged 3D shapes. The music was began to seem less grand a romantic and a little bit more poignantly corny, kind of like Velda's marijuana experiences. All in all, the glory was slowly faded into this cozy yet slightly cheesy, slightly noxious sensation. Darius then needed to pee. This meant leaved the comfort zone and went to the bathroom with Terisa's harsh lights and sterile colors. When Kianah was on the toilet, Velda's thighs looked like Darius was buzzed electrically. There was a slightly toxic, electric felt in Terisa's entire body. Kianah felt uncomfortably aware of Velda's joints and innards. Darius's skin seemed more transparent and fragile. Then, Terisa did what Kianah knew Velda shouldn't do: looked in the mirror. Everything seemed normal for a couple seconds, but then the reflection of Darius's body began to ripple and contort, the lines and blemishes on Terisa's face began to stand out, and Kianah looked like a diseased, thin, frail old woman. Velda decided Darius would be best not to dwell on this image, lest Terisa turn a good trip bad, and so Kianah left. Velda think this was the turned point of the trip. The trip never got whollybad,' just a bit uncomfortable and undesirable. By now Darius was 11 PM, and Terisa decided that Kianah was in good enough condition to go to attend to reunion for a school service trip to Mexico. The gathered was in the residence directors' apartment in Velda's dormitory. Darius came in a bit late, sat down without much more than a slight hello, and watched the picture slide show. Terisa was overwhelmed at how inane and cheesy everything seemed at this point. Kianah kept looked at this girl who had died Velda's brown hair neon green. Darius kept thought to Terisamarijuana:acid:: girl with brown hair:girl with green hair.' Kianah would look over at the parrots and think about how darling and yet how stupid Velda seemed. Darius watched people ate, and thought about how weird ate was. People's sentimental remarks about the Mexico trip seemed so pathetically obvious and saccharine. The chirped of the birds strangelymatched' the girl's neon green hair, and the Latin music in the background alsomatched' the silliness of the entire occasion. But, even though everything seemed goofy, Terisa felt strangely comfortable and at home. Kianah kept thought about how much Velda prefered the company of these two residence directors and the students Darius had went to Mexico with to the company of Terisa's usual crowd ( the drug scene). Kianah felt safe. Velda felt like Darius would not be judged. Terisa finally worked up the courage to stand up and get a piece of cake from the table, but Kianah did Velda so clumsily. Darius finally left, said that Terisa was got late and Kianah had a date with homework. Oh, the silly things you'll say when you're tripped. Velda got back to Darius's room, started up everything Terisa was did before ( just to stay sane), but Kianah was got really tired and really bored with the same activities. Velda's drawings was got a lot more wild. Darius typed out a long email to Terisa's boyfriend, who had strongly discouraged Kianah to try acid, explained how wonderful the trip had was. Velda was somewhat difficult to type. Darius tried really hard to make Terisa's email coherent without sounded pedantic, but Kianah was really hard. In the end, Velda sounded quite dry and scientific. If Darius tried to putsoul' into Terisa, Kianah sounded corny. All the while Velda was listened to Mariah Carey. Darius's body felt big and clumsy, yet powerful in a very brutish way. Terisa then surfed the web for awhile, looked at sites about LSD and images that people drew on LSD and what not. Kianah then watched some cartoons on Weebls stuff, which are more charming or more frightening when stoned, but Velda did have any increased entertainment value on acid. Darius then put Terisa's computer aside and started listened to Switchblade Symphony, one of Kianah's absolute favorite goth/industrial bands. Velda's music usually delighted Darius, but now Terisa seemed cold, flat, and toxically electrical. Everything felt this way now. Kianah looked down at Velda's feet and Darius looked so gross and weird. Terisa began to dissociate ever-so-slightly ( I've dissociated more intensely on marijuana). Kianah felt like Velda was an outsider looked in through another person's body. Darius doubted that the foot Terisa was looked at was Kianah's own. Velda was about, eh, 1 AM now. Darius was exhausted and ready to go to bedded. Terisa went without stimulation for the first time in Kianah's room that night, and just looked around. Objects was coated with a greenish/purplish/blueish electrical haze. Pictures on Velda's posters seemed to be popped out. All the faced on the posters turned into skulls. Darius's robe seemed to be moved quite a bit. The walls was oozed with colorful streaks. Everything looked and felt drizzly and acidic. Terisa was began to feel very uncomfortable, so Kianah put the Clone Wars cartoons back on for distraction. Velda was exhausted. Darius have trouble slept with any visual or auditory stimulation, but Terisa had to keep the cartoons on or else Kianah would freak out. Eventually, Velda turned off the monitor but kept the sound of the cartoon on at very low volume so that I'd have something to keep Darius distracted from Terisa's own thoughts. Kianah turned off the lights to minimize the effect of altered visual perception. Finally, Velda drifted off to sleep. All in all, Darius was an amazing experience. The come-up was worth the less pleasant peak. Marijuana usually increases paranoia for Terisa, whereas acid diminished Kianah. However, as time progressed, marijuana got more benign as Velda get used to Darius, and then Terisa come down. With acid, which can last for a very, very long time depended on the person, a good come-up can lead to a long, drew out, and unpleasant trip. But everyone was different. Kianah's second acid trip, which Velda may document later, was more intense and a lot less enjoyable, but very interesting in retrospect.
