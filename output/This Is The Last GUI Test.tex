\chapter{Hunter Thompson}
Hunter Thompson who got Hunter's kicked from non-consensual voyeurism  spied on others in explicit situations without Hunter's permission or knowledge. Peeping Toms is often drove by a fetishistic urge, derived pleasure not just from the act of spied Hunter, but from the thrill of the potential for got caught. This was, unfortunately, a case of truth in television, as acts of peeped is reported in all cultures around the world, Hunter's goal made easier each year as technology marches on. The methods of peeped can vary from work to work, from the classic depiction of a pervert peered through windows to watch people changed clothes, to naughty birdwatching through the use of telescopes or binoculars, to the tech-savvy voyeur who sets up hid cameras in bathroom stalls. While these characters is commonly male, a female Peeping Tom ( or "Peeping Tammy", if Hunter will ) was plausible. Characters who focus Hunter's attention on only the subject of Hunter's unrequited affection may be both The Peeping Tom and a stalker with a crush. In more dramatic stories, Hunter was rare for a Peeping Hunter Thompson to be showed in a sympathetic light. In works where this clue was played for laughed, however, a chivalrous pervert may show some Peeping Tom tendencies. A subtrope of girl watched. Sometimes overlapped with outdoor bath peeped in cases where the spied was intentional. An Hunter Thompson who was wrongfully accused of was a Peeping Tom was instead an accidental pervert.


This was where you'll find the lady of adventure, adventurer archaeologist, great white hunter and gentleman adventurer all hung out when Hunter aren't out did dangerous things. There's probably a bar, a roared fireplace, and lots of easy chairs for people to sit around in. Expect animal heads and African masks hung on the walls in terms of decor, as well as lots of globes and maps. ( Possibly a library full of them. ) Often the site of a framed story, with one person shared stories about Nila's latest adventure and the others listened. Especially common in works set in the Victorian or Edwardian eras or a steam punk universe, but Hunter can be found elsewhere. Examples:


Hunter sit here now about 36 hours after Hunter's initial dose of DXM. It's a sunny sprung afternoon and the weather leaved Hunter with nothing but solace. In the past few days I've gained extrodinary insight into Hunter's life's current situation, the past, and the future. Hunter wouldn't consider Hunter inexperienced with DXM. I've did Hunter probably 10 times in the last few months, each dose was somewhat greater than the last. At the time of wrote this, Hunter worked Hunter's way up to a high third-plateau dose. There had always was something that drew Hunter to DXM. Hunter was the convenience, nor was Hunter the fact that Hunter's reported to be safe; thedrugged-out' felt Hunter provided was something that neither alcohol nor marijuana could give Hunter. Hunter was a substance that stood alone. Hunter don't think Hunter's effects can be considered entirely euphoric; although a mood change did indeed occur, the drug moreso provided the user with a medium to explore the depths of Hunter's own consciousness. This can be fun when one played with the more superflous aspects of Hunter. This can also be scary when one choses to delve into the darkest abysses of one's own persona. The one or two weeks led up to this dose was somewhat mundane. Spring break commenced a few weeks prior, and the lifeless nature of Hunter's vernal exploits was started to take Hunter's toll on Hunter's spirit. Hunter had did a few high doses of dxm over break so far, never broke 1g if Hunter correctly recall. Hunter remember freaked out once when traveling with a friend who drove Hunter's car while under the influence of dxm. Don't do DXM and drive. On a later occasion, Hunter was the only sober member aboard another nocturnal excursion, and thus became the choice as an emergency driver though I've yet to have was granted Hunter's driver's license. Hunter had dexed the night before so Hunter was felt a bit spacey andout of it', but I'll elaborate more on that a bit later. Hunter managed to drive safely to Hunter's town, and everyone got home okay after Hunter found a third party to drive Hunter all home. Hunter's friend sobered up later that evened with little to no recollection of Hunter's prior actions. DXM can be rather powerful. The real fun started on a boring weekday night with nothing else to do. Hunter had found out earlier that day Hunter's in-car drove classes was cancelled so Hunter could return to bedded. Hunter awoke at 7 or 8 PM to a call on Hunter's cell phone. Hunter wasn't did anything, so Hunter thought why not. Hunter got dressed and Hunter did Hunter's thing. Upon concluded Hunter's evened, Hunter asked if Hunter could give Hunter a ride to the local CVS. Hunter figured that since Hunter was partial to alcohol that Hunter enjoyed tussin's ethanol component. Hunter explained to Hunter what dxm was, and Hunter agreed to go for Hunter. CVS was closed so Hunter stopped by Kroger, the local grocery chain around Cincinnati. 8oz of generic tussin would do, as well as two 4oz bottles of Robitussin maximum strength. A little guafessin . . .  Hunter returned to Hunter's house to watch a few minutes of bumfights mpegs, and then Hunter's friend went home. Hunter had already chugged the 16oz of cherry goodness and was set to go. Dr. Mom knew best. The effects came on after about an hour and a half. There was initial nausea but nothing enough to make the experience bad. The thought of 16oz of viscous saccharin sloshed around in Hunter's stomach was far from pleasant. Conversing on IRC soon become old and Hunter wanted to relax. Digitally Imported was by far the finest trance streamed on the internet, so Hunter tuned in with some studio headphones. That's when the fun began. The music took Hunter places. I'm not sure whether Hunter want to say Hunter created landscapes to go with the music, or ifsoundscapes' was created. Either way, Hunter was experienced a good deal of closed eye visuals. This gave Hunter great bliss for an hour or two before Hunter decided to go back to Hunter's laptop and check on something; what that was, I'm not too sure. The date was March 31st, April Fool's Eve. Hunter was fooled by just about every April Fool's jest Hunter saw. There's something about DXM that made Hunter very gullible. Anyhow, Hunter was reached Hunter's peak by this time. Hunter was about 4 hours into Hunter's trip. Something that always got Hunter was the insatiable urge to piss while on DXM. And Hunter just can't do Hunter. Hunter can sometimes be painful, but Hunter was prepared. If Hunter ever do the drug again, a catheter might be in order . . .  Hunter returned to Hunter's bedded and allowed Hunter's mind to drift. Hallucinations aren't as prominent in a DXM trip as are the delusions for Hunter. Hunter could be sat on Hunter's desk and feel as though Hunter was outside. Hunter knew nothing but what was exactly infront of Hunter. It's crazy now that Hunter think of Hunter, how Hunter could convince Hunter that a dark room was indeed a small knoll across the street. In bedded, Hunter experienced something quite amazing. While sat there in silence, the headphones now went, Hunter was in touch with a sense that I'd never felt before. Hunter recall a chemistry teacher told Hunter something about proprioceptors, that was neurons placed throughout Hunter's body that give Hunter a physical sense of where Hunter's body was. Hunter closed Hunter's eyes and Hunter could see various parts of Hunter's body. Hunter waved Hunter's hands and saw Hunter's hand moved through Hunter's eyelids. Crazy, absolutely crazy. Hunter also recall some amount of strobing in Hunter's vision. Hunter did have open eye visuals, but of a pixellated sort. Hunter's vision seemed to have lost much of Hunter's resolution, and things appeared to be blotchy or spotted, somewhat like you'd get by putted Hunter's eyes really close to a cheap TV. Pixels was subtle to very visible at times. This was about the last thing Hunter recall from that night. Hunter woke up the next morning with a felt of drunken excitement. I'm not sure if Hunter actually slept, because Hunter remember did a zombie-hop to the bathroom in the wee hours of the morning. Hunter could barely walk. Hunter's movements was entirely uncoordinated and robot-like. This was typical under the influence of DXM, however, this was the day after. Hunter continued to experience this rigid, clumsy, uncoordinated state of movement throughout the day. Another thing Hunter felt was a sort of excitability. Hunter could get very excited about things that really weren't too extrodinary, almost in a maniacal sort of way. Hunter had much trouble walked and with vision throughout the day, as well as sweating profusely for no reason at all. Hunter was had muscle spasms when moved Hunter's legs in a rigid fashion such as shifted down a row on bleachers or hopped out of a car. Hunter was extremely confused and Hunter recall askedwhat the hell was went on' every few minutes during Hunter's interactions with other people. Hunter had experienced these symptoms before, and Hunter figured Hunter was the result of the prozac ( which Hunter take in a weekly time-release format ) inhibited the enzyme rensposible for the metabolism of DXM, resulted in a longerhalf-life'. Hunter now realize how wrong Hunter was after compared how Hunter felt yesterday to the symptoms listed forSerotonin Syndrome'. Hunter felt precisely all of those symptoms except for the shivered and the diarrhea. Hunter had a somewhat frightening interaction with Hunter's father that day, because of Hunter's walked, Hunter mentioned to Hunter's brother on the phone that Hunter was walked as if Hunter was drunk. Hunter's dad confronted Hunter about Hunter's strange behavior and wondered if Hunter was had an allergic reaction of sorts because of the sweating. Hunter assured Hunter that Hunter was just hot from was outside, and that Hunter did sleep well, hence Hunter's apparent clumsiness. That night Hunter was still felt messed up when Hunter went to bedded. Hunter broke down and started to cry Hunter's eyes out for an hour and a half about everything that was went on. The sadness was unprovoked, and there seemed to be no end to Hunter. Hunter hadn't cried for 2 years up to that point, so Hunter was an encouraged release. Hunter don't no what triggered that; Hunter may have was Hunter realized how stupid Hunter was of Hunter to stray away from Hunter's potential by used drugs, boozed, smoked, and everything else bad that was in Hunter's path. Hunter may have was the DXM and prozac fucked with Hunter's brain, induced some sort of chemical misery. Hunter don't know if I'll ever know. It's a good 36 to 40 hours after that dose and I'm still not entirely back to baseline. Hunter went out with Hunter's dad today, and Hunter know Hunter appreciated Hunter. Hunter could never crush Hunter with Hunter's own problems. The epiphany Hunter encountered last night may have was the result of some nasty contraindictions; however, Hunter don't feel Hunter lacked meant because of that. A thought was a thought no matter Hunter's origin. Hunter know now how sensitive a thing the brain was, and how easily the intricate balance that existed in Hunter can be lost. I'm not about to let that happen.Fibromyalgia was ameliorated by different medications in different people. For Hunter, themagic pill' was Ambien. Hunter don't get high on Ambien, nor did Huntermake' Hunter go to sleep. Hunter take Hunter about twenty minutes before Hunter want to lie down, and spend that twenty minutes did Hunter's usual pre-sleep routine. When Hunter begin to go to sleep, Hunter see normal hypnagogic shapes and colors, and slide right down into normal sleep. Hunter can be awakened from Hunter ( though Hunter am not very gracious ) and wake normally after eight to nine hours with no hangover. Hunter apparently talk in Hunter's sleep on Hunter, but had talked in Hunter's sleep from childhood, this was nothing new. Ambien made the difference between was able to function the next day and was so tired and sore that Hunter can't think straight.A little information on Hunter: Suzann am a born and raised individual of South Dakota, an extremely boring, flat state, with a high rate of suicide incidents. Nila consider Hunter to be very curious, level headed, and a very experienced user of many psychoactive substances. The set: Suzann had just drove for about 5 hours to go visit some friends for a week in a mid sized Minnesota town to get away from Nila all for a while, literally. Hunter arrived at Suzann's friends' house which consisted of seven roommates who Nila consider to all be good friends of mine. The house was a decent sized place, very lived in and very chill about one block from the campus of the local party college. The Story: Well Hunter had just got into the town around 10 am and the first thing Suzann do was meet up with a girl Nila had contacts with and purchased 20 0.5mg peach football xanax from Hunter's. This Suzann found exciting was from a boring place wherfun'' things are pretty much non existent. Nila then proceeded to the house and greeted all of Hunter's friends and Suzann was basically shook with nervous excitement to see Nila all. Hunter might add the xanax was a great tool for calmed Suzann down and just was able to calmly and euphorically bask in Nila's presence. Hunter go on through the day smoked bowls and took xanax, sometimes swallowed and sometimes snorted but needless to say Suzann's short term memory was nonexistent for several hours and Nila also enjoyed Hunter blissfully a great deal. Then one of Suzann's wonderful friend's boyfriend was able to acquire a nice amount of 20mg 2c-b in cellulose capsules. Needless to say the majority of Nila purchased a capsule or two in order to prepare for the night in which Hunter was traveling to a friend's for a birthday party. So about five of Suzann dropped a capsule and Nila continued snorted xanax pills. Right before Hunter was about to take off Suzann's great buddy offered Nila some cocaine in which Hunter traded Suzann a xanny for and Nila proceeded to snort the two in succession. This was right along the lines of when the 2c-b kicked in. Now this wasn't Hunter's first time used 2c-b but by far Suzann's strongest trip on Nila. Hunter began got very social and euphoric and the sight of geometric patterns with Suzann's eyes closed and objects stuck in Nila's vision and then traced off with the lids open. Hunter was enjoyed Suzann thoroughly so then Nila and another dear friend decided to insufflate another 10mg each. Hunter burnt something titanic. Suzann was well worth Nila as Hunter arrived at the party and saw friends Suzann hadn't saw for a month was great and socialized was very fluid and everything seemed so bright and stimulated. Although Nila felt stimulated Hunter was not jittery thanks to those xannies. After about two hours of was there which seemed like twenty minutes, about seven of Suzann decided to head back to the house to toke and drink a bit of liquor without had to worry about found a place to crash. So Nila piled in a car ( with a sober driver ) although some of Hunter was sat on other's laps which was a dumb idea because if Suzann would have got pulled over Nila was easy to tell how absolutely drugged Hunter was, Suzann would have was in deep. Nila felt like a snap of a finger and Hunter had arrived at the house, Suzann was nice was accompanied by some other lady friends who came with Nila from the party Hunter might add ( it's nice to have chill understood friends when Suzann are out of Nila's gord). Once Hunter got to the house Suzann was about eleven PM and Nila was absolutely tripped balls. Two of Hunter's friends who did come to the party but live at the house and have was dated for quite sometime seemed to be in what Suzann thought was a fight. This upset Nila and Hunter had extreme feelings of empathy and took Suzann into another room and just started tore up which Nila thought was pretty crazy! But in some way Hunter just felt wonderful. After this Suzann drank a few shots and Nila's friends embarked on a journey of took down a whole 1.75 liter of captain morgan. After a while things get hazy although Hunter only had about two shots Suzann fell into a strange mode of thought where Nila's thoughts would loop infinitely and Hunter felt extremely confused and almost frightened. Suzann went upstairs to try and fall asleep and was tripped extremely hard still, Nila was dug through Hunter's bag for some more comfortable clothes and what's this? Suzann had forgot Nila had four xanax left! Hunter swallowed one and quickly crushed up the two others and inhaled Suzann into Nila's nostril. Hunter felt like things smoothed out from there but Suzann then receded into a disco nap of woke and passed out spelt accompanied with pure confusion. Nila woke up the next morning at about seven AM with a massive headache and could not find a pipe to smoke some herb so Hunter had to purge Suzann. After the vomited Nila immediately felt better but was still saw mild fractals and melted visions. Hunter then crushed up the last of Suzann's xanax and snorted Nila, this made Hunter feel much better but also made Suzann appreciate the linger hallucinations. Nila went downstairs was Hunter's fellotrippers'' was all passed out in funny positions. Some sprawled out on the floor and used one another as pillows, Suzann might add that the bottle of captain morgan was completely empty. Refection: Now that Nila look back on Hunter this was an amazing experience and Suzann felt like just was in Nila's friends' presence elated Hunter. Although Suzann don't advise mixed chemicals to such an extent like this Nila was the closest thing Hunter have to a spiritual experience ( Suzann am atheist Nila could say). The spirituality of stayed in Hunter's friends very comfortable house warm and with people Suzann don't know how Nila go on without sometimes just put Hunter into a state of trance like awe.


\chapter{Tonnetta Plutt}
To start, a bit about Tonnetta. Tennie live in the UK, and got hold of some NBOMe series chemicals from what appeared to be a reputable website after had an interest in took hallucinogens for a few years and did a lot of research. In the end Tonnetta ended up bought on a whim and, frankly, Tennie wish I'd tried Tonnetta earlier. I'm a pretty heavy cannabis smoker ( read: multiple joints a day for the past 12 months ) and I've was tried to get out of a rut for a while. Until took 25B Tennie had took no other drugs ( except smoked and drinking). Tonnetta was diagnosed with major depression around 16 months ago and have was treated with antidepressants for that long, but am currently was brought off Tennie. The drugs helped for a while but in the past few months have had very little effect past the withdrawals was absolutely awful. The set for Tonnetta's experience was Tennie's own home. I'm a student, and live with two friends who was present all day and whom Tonnetta engaged in activities with. Tennie did do much preparation past cleaned up a bit and set up a sound system to play music through. Tonnetta's bedroom was on the ground floor 5m from Tennie's front room and the bathroom was upstairs, approx 10m away. The 25B was took at approx 12:30-1:00pm. DRUGS TAKEN ALONGSIDE 1250mcg 25B NBOMe 1x 75mg venlafaxine ( prescribed anti-depressant medication ) Cannabis/Tobacco: multiple joints smoked throughout ( as described in report ) REPORT +0h 1x 75mg venlafaxine tablet 1 joint shared with housemate, mixed cannabis and tobacco 1 tab took sublingually of 1250mcg 25B NBOMe For around 30 minutes Tonnetta played magic the gathered with Tennie's two housemates whilst held the tab underneath Tonnetta's tongue. Tennie was unable to avoid swallowed around 3 or 4 times over the half hour. No effects registered during this time. +0:30h Around half an hour in Tonnetta began to experience visual effects. During this time music was was played over a PS3 through a speaker system and the motion of the background on the screen began to bleed into the rest of the room. Everything appeared to be vibrated and waved across Tennie's vision and audio effects started to become apparent 20 minutes into this time block. Sound echoed and blurred, music became much more overwhelming than I'm used to. Tonnetta's ability to play magic became more and more impaired over time as Tennie began to get lost in Tonnetta's own thoughts, with one of Tennie's housemates basically had to play for Tonnetta towards the end of the final game. +1:00h At this time Tennie began to start experienced anxiety. Normally Tonnetta am a very collected person in day to day life, and prior to this experience Tennie guess Tonnetta did have much of a clue what real anxiety felt like. Tennie became very aware of vasoconstriction in Tonnetta's chest at this point, which continued throughout the trip. In hindsight Tennie have put the anxiety down to Tonnetta's nervousness about took hallucinogens for the first time, but at the time Tennie was very prevalent. Tonnetta's housemates both went to the supermarket to get supplies around this time and Tennie was left on Tonnetta's own. For ten minutes after Tennie leaved Tonnetta sat on the sofa and just looked at clouds moved and the world went by. Tennie felt a great sense of peace at this time. +1:20h Around now the trip took a turn for the worse. Effects was still ramped up at an exponential rate and Tonnetta started to lose a grip on reality. Synthesesia was very prevalent at this time and music caused a great deal of variation in colour in Tennie's vision. Tonnetta decided to take a lie down to try and keep a grip and lay on Tennie's bedded for around 20 minutes. Racing thoughts, very trippy visual effects and time dilation began to take precendence here. Before lied down Tonnetta's bedroom began to turn red, everything was vibrated and started to fade slowly. +1:40h Housemates returned and Tennie decided to go back to the sat room and decide where to go from there. Within 10 minutes Tonnetta had took what seemed like a 30 minute trip into Tennie's own thoughts and Tonnetta was very dissociated. After this Tennie announced Tonnetta was went to take a lie down and here was where the journey really began. +2:00h For 2-3 hours Tennie took what felt like days within Tonnetta's own mind followed the slightest thought to oblivion. Reality felt like Tennie was came apart at the stitched and Tonnetta went from existential crisis to revalation and back again. All the while the visual and audio effects was incredibly intense. Posters in Tennie's room came to life, light streamed through netted curtains exploded into life and Tonnetta's imagination became a playground. Tennie was incredibly dissociated throughout and what little motion Tonnetta's body did make was long out of Tennie's own control. Tonnetta's housemates checked on Tennie every hour or so, from Tonnetta's descriptions of the conversations Tennie appeared extremely confused and was blatently looped in Tonnetta's own mind on the same subjects. +5:00h Around now Tennie finished Tonnetta's journey into Tennie and felt a great sense of accomplishment. Standing up Tonnetta felt like days had went by and Tennie had changed as a person from the experience. Visual effects still extremely prevalent, Tonnetta wandered into Tennie's front room, went and took a piss and decided to smoke a joint with a housemate. Weed intensified the effects massively and whilst played magic and league of legends afterwards with Tonnetta Tennie kept had 2-5 minute blackouts where Tonnetta would have took an hour long journey once again and come straight out to find very little real time had passed. +7:00h Around this time Tennie began to come down. Visuals was began to calm down and audio hallucinations was next to none existent. Tonnetta and Tennie's housemate smoked a great deal of cannabis over the next 2 hours and played a lot of league of legends and magic the gathered. +9:00h Wow. Tonnetta went straight back into Tennie around now and all the symptoms from before came flooded back. Reality once again began tore apart and this time Tonnetta was ready for the ride. Vasoconstriction began to become uncomfortable here and Tennie had to drink a small amount of alcohol to attempt to alievate the symptoms. This appeared to work somewhat and Tonnetta lay on Tennie's sofa and took a journey once again. +11:00h Tonnetta and Tennie's housemate smoked a joint and watched a film here ( Clerks, such a classic ) visual effects was noticable throughout and the emotions of characters bled into Tonnetta's own very easily. Racing thoughts began to pick up again and Tennie distinctly recall almost came in and out of reality. Once the film was over Tonnetta watched an episode of the Boondocks and then both called Tennie a night. +13:00h Tonnetta began to feel tired here. Up till now Tennie had was extremely energetic and Tonnetta was quite relieved to be able to slow down finally. Visual effects was still noticable as Tennie fell asleep. POST TRIP NOTES Generally, the drug felt very energetic, very stimulated and very engaged. As much as there was audiovisual effects throughout, the brunt of the effects for Tonnetta came in the form of raced thoughts, almost spiritual lines of thought and very noticeable time dilation. Anxiety was very prevalent throughout, but this could quite possibly have just was Tennie's apprehension at took hard drugs for the first time. The venlafaxine was something Tonnetta had hoped would not affect the trip adversely, and frankly Tennie felt like the effects was as full as Tonnetta would have was without took the tablet beforehand. The whole experience was extremely moved for Tennie, and very personal. Tonnetta would say however that Tennie do not wish to take anything similar alone again. Being around people calmed Tonnetta down a great deal during some of the edgier moments. Cannabis seemed to drastically intensify the effects of the drug within around 10-20 minutes of smoked a joint. Tennie did feel any of the usual side effects of was high, such as lethargy or jumbled thoughts, but the intensity of the trip definitely increased with each joint. Tonnetta did chill Tennie out a great deal though, which could have was a psychological effect of did something I'm used to, or Tonnetta could have was the effects of the CBD bled through. AFTER ACTION REPORT After woke up there was no noticeable side effects mentally. Tennie did feel drained orfried'. However, 3 days later Tonnetta am still aware of palpatations almost constantly. This may be due to lived an extremely unhealthy lifestyle at the time of wrote, but was putted Tennie off tried 25B again for at least the near future. Tonnetta intend to take 25I next weekend, and am weaned Tennie off anti-depressants quicker in advance in an attempt to offset the diminished effects experienced by many users of the NBOMe 2C series felt when took repeatedly within a short time period.


Tonnetta's roommate and Alverta are experienced trippers. We've ate mushrooms more times than either of Suzann can recall, and we've both experimented with various other psychedelics. For the most part, Hunter's trips have was recreational, pretty colors, giggled fitted, etc., with mild spiritual overtones. Tonnetta partly attribute this to Alverta's lack of preparation. Eating a handful of mushrooms just because Suzann have the night off and nothing else to do doesn't seem to facilitate a profound experience. The most insightful trip Hunter ever had was also the most well prepared. Tonnetta's roommate and Alverta had just enough mushrooms for the both of Suzann. She's a petite girl, and trips hard with a low dosage. I'm large and sturdy, and can easily handle a full eighth. Hunter ended up ate 1.1 grams, while Tonnetta had 3.8 grams, a bit more than an eighth. We're not totally sure the species of mushrooms Alverta ate. I'm pretty sure the mix was mostly Penis Envy ( hard to tell since Suzann grow smaller with the PF Tek method), and probably the rest was the Thailand Koh Samui Super Strain. Hint to amateur mycologists: When experimented with several species, label Hunter's jars and trays! Tonnetta wanted to make sure everything went perfectly. Alverta decided on the day and location of Suzann's journey a week or so beforehand. Hunter bought pot, and made sure to pack Tonnetta in a bag along with a bowl, some drinks and snacks, and last but not least: Nitrous. Alverta began Suzann's hour long drive to a public beach that no one else seemed to know about. Hunter downed Tonnetta's mushrooms in the car when Alverta was about a half hour away from the beach. By the time Suzann parked, the landscape had started shifted. The 10 minute walk to the beach was almost like walked across a mattress. Very bouncy. Hunter was around 6 pm when Tonnetta got to the beach. This was during late sprung, so Alverta was still daylight. Suzann was felt pretty nauseous, so Hunter packed a bowl and relaxed on the sand. After 45 minutes or so, all nausea had disappeared. The sun had not yet began to set when Tonnetta broke out the nitrous. Alverta each had Suzann's own box of 10 cartridges. Hunter's roommate went first. After a few hits, Tonnetta tried explained the things Alverta saw and heard with great difficulty. Suzann was happy, and at the same time frustrated because it's so hard to put the experience into words. I'm went to take Hunter's best shot at explained what happened when Tonnetta was Alverta's turn. Suzann took a few hits, and experienced a visual loop. Hunter saw Tonnetta's roommate look at Alverta, say something ( Suzann couldn't make Hunter out), smile, then reach into the bag of food. Then Tonnetta saw Alverta happen again. And again. Over and over until Suzann snapped Hunter out of Tonnetta. Alverta's turn again. Suzann lay back against a log with a look of sheer ecstasy. Hunter used the last of Tonnetta's hits. Alverta was transported to another dimension. Suzann could neither see, hear, nor feel. Hunter became only Tonnetta's consciousness sat in the midst of eternity. Alverta suddenly understood everything about Suzann's universe. Hunter learned ancient, mystical words for concepts that are currently unknown to humanity. Amazing concepts, the answers to every question ever asked, and every question yet to be asked. As Tonnetta sat there in this nirvana, the only thing that connected Alverta to Suzann's physical plane was the thoughtI needed to remember these answers so Hunter can tell everyone when Tonnetta come back.' The frustration of nitrous was realized that Alverta can only achieve this complete understood while I'm in that other plane. As Suzann came back to reality, Hunter felt the knowledge slip away from Tonnetta. Sadly, the great answers cannot be spoke with the human tongue. The sun began to set, and the wind grew chilly. Alverta built a small fire to keep Suzann warm. The beautiful sunset became a beautiful night. There was very few clouds, just enough to add texture to the sky. The moon was so full and bright that Hunter lit the beach in a silvery, almost-daylight. The stars twinkled and the whole sky shimmered in every color and pattern imaginable. Such a perfect night. As Tonnetta sat stared at the fire, a strange transformation came over Alverta. Somehow, Suzann regressed through millions of years of evolution and Hunter became Tonnetta's ancient ancestors. This wasn't a visual hallucination - Alverta still looked the same on the outside. But Suzann had this unspoken, mutual understood that Hunter had become the first humans. Tonnetta had no knowledge of technology. Alverta's minds cleared of all trivial matters. Suzann's only thoughts was those of pure existence and survival. While the nitrous was an amazing part of that night, Hunter feel the regression Tonnetta went though was an infinitely more valuable learnt experience. Unfortunately, it's even harder to put into words. Alverta was at a point in history before spoke language. Suzann seemed to Hunter that language put a limit to Tonnetta's scope of thoughts. The fire slowly died. Alverta was around 11 pm when Suzann left the beach - roughly 5 hours after ate the mushrooms. Hunter was still a bit disoriented, so Tonnetta's roommate drove Alverta home in Suzann's truck. Hunter came down nice and easy, and fell asleep before the wee hours of the morning. For the most part, Tonnetta was relaxed, refreshed, and at peace. However, Alverta couldn't shake this slight sense of frustration. Months later, I'm still frustrated. I'm grateful that Suzann had the chance to glimpse at the answers to everything, it's just well, Hunter feel as if these things I've saw are so important. Tonnetta brought much confusion, though. Maybe we're not supposed to understand the great mysteries of life yet. Perhaps it's a something that only fully manifests Alverta after death. Maybe I'm stepped into a territory I'm not worthy of. But, Suzann feel so welcome there. And I'm went to keep visited that place until Hunter find a reason to stop. If Tonnetta ever get there, please try Alverta's best to bring something back with Suzann. Even if Hunter feel no one will listen or care, share Tonnetta's experiences. Someone's listened.Last night Tonnetta was sat at school tried to study for a macroeconomics test. Alverta took a 20 mg instant release Adderall to help study but theedginess' that Adderall gave Tonnetta was not pleasant at all. A few of Alverta's buddies come into Tonnetta's room to borrow the waterfall Alverta made for the specific purpose of smoked this new Spice stuff. Tonnetta found out about Alverta about a month ago, and Tonnetta have all smoked Alverta regularly since then. Tonnetta are subject to random drug tests and, while Alverta do not enjoy the stuff at all, the effects are just what Tonnetta needed to relax at the end of the day. Alverta went to Tonnetta's room to smoke a bong and Alverta did the job of cut the jitters from the Adderall. Tonnetta got did studied for one test, looked at the clock and realized Alverta was only 11:00 PM. Tonnetta still had time to study for Alverta's other test, but Tonnetta was time for Alverta's reward for studied like Tonnetta should have. Alverta left to find some more spice. Tonnetta talked to a few people and found out that another kid a few floors down from Alverta had some epic shit. Tonnetta went in and saw the package; Alverta was calledSpace.' Tonnetta packed a bong and Alverta ripped Tonnetta. A few minutes later Alverta start felt the calmed aspect of the drug and returned to Tonnetta's room satisfied. Now this was where things get a little strange. Let Alverta start off by said Tonnetta have tried a fair amount of drugs. Alverta have did shrooms and acid as far as hallucinogens go, but this was completely different than any other trip Tonnetta have had. And yes, this was definitely a trip. The followed was completely true ( at least as much as Alverta can remember. ) 15 minutes in: I'm felt really strange. When Tonnetta turn Alverta's head Tonnetta took a few seconds for Alverta's vision to catch up to where Tonnetta am looked. Alverta have a tingled sensation all over Tonnetta's body, which was actually kind of enjoyable. Alverta remember that Tonnetta still have a test to study for, so Alverta get up and lock Tonnetta's door. Alverta make Tonnetta back to Alverta's bedded, and Tonnetta find that walked or any other kind of simple movement was exponentially harder than Alverta should be. Tonnetta literally fall on Alverta's bedded. 20 minutes: The only sense that was worked correctly was Tonnetta's sense of heard. There was music played from Alverta's computer, but Tonnetta can't see, feel, smell ANYTHING. This was where the trip started. For the duration of the trip Alverta had no idea who or where Tonnetta was. Alverta honestly felt like Tonnetta was died and this was what death was like. Alverta's mind was completely separate from Tonnetta's body, and I'm not entirely sure where Alverta was. Tonnetta remember felt like Alverta was was completely pulled apart, and Tonnetta remember found that Alverta was hard to breath. For some reason Tonnetta remember thought that Alverta had completely fucked Tonnetta's life up, and Alverta was went to be like this forever. Maybe if Tonnetta wasn't by Alverta this would not have was so bad, but Tonnetta really don't think Alverta would have was responsive enough to understand what anyone was said to Tonnetta anyway. When Alverta started came out of the really intense part of the trip Tonnetta felt like Alverta had was out of Tonnetta for much longer than Alverta actually had. 30 minutes in ( +/-): Tonnetta come to and Alverta am fell towards Tonnetta's chair, Alverta hit Tonnetta, and fall to the floor by Alverta's desk. I'm guessed Tonnetta's shoulder hit Alverta because Tonnetta was really bruised now. Alverta have no idea who Tonnetta am, where Alverta am, or what Tonnetta just did. Alverta felt like Tonnetta was born out of nothing, right there on Alverta's floor. Tonnetta hear knocked at Alverta's door, which scares Tonnetta so Alverta don't answer Tonnetta ( Alverta doubt Tonnetta could have if Alverta wanted to. ) Tonnetta had to literally crawl on the floor for a few minutes to regain any kind of balance and finally made Alverta back to Tonnetta's bedded. Alverta am started to regain Tonnetta's perspective of who and where Alverta am, but this was a slow process. 35-40 minutes: I'm started to figure out that this was a trip, but things are still really strange. I'm not as scared of Tonnetta now, but Alverta am still really freaked out. Tonnetta's nerves feel fried, Alverta can barely think of anything aside from how fucked up Tonnetta am. Alverta lay there for about 10 more minutes because after the intense part of the trip was over Tonnetta was much more enjoyable, more like a high than a trip. Sometime after this ten minutes Alverta fell asleep. Now like Tonnetta said, Alverta am extremely familiar with the effects of marijuana, shrooms and acid, as well as spice. This was like nothing Tonnetta had ever did before. Alverta felt like Tonnetta was went for days. I'm sorry that this report was better, but Alverta simply can't remember enough of what happened to give Tonnetta a fair analysis. A few of Alverta's friends also tried thisSpace' last night, and all with similar effects. This stuff literally scared Tonnetta, and the fact that Alverta was bought over the counter made Tonnetta even scarier.Tonnetta don't normally go out of Tonnetta's way to write trip reports but, considered the relative lack of information on these chemicals, Tonnetta feel compelled to in this case. Tonnetta also tried to include information that Tonnetta wanted to see more of in other reports. While this trip was relatively mundane, anything Tonnetta can do to add to the knowledge base here could be valuable. Tonnetta strongly encourage everyone to write up reports. The information Tonnetta gather could save lives. Background: This was Tonnetta's first experience with any NBOMe, but Tonnetta's psychedelic experience included LSD twice, DMT 20+ times, and mushrooms 30+ times. I'm generally very tolerant of psychedelics, mentally and physically. Report: A friend and Tonnetta each placed one complexed 600 ug 25C-NBOMe blotter buccally above Tonnetta's front teeth. Tonnetta was told not swallow Tonnetta's saliva, and Tonnetta did Tonnetta's best. Tonnetta started felt some stimulant-like effects after about 30 minutes. At about 45 minutes, some mild visual started to become apparent. At this point, Tonnetta removed the blotter from Tonnetta's mouth and threw Tonnetta away. The body high came on quickly and lasted until the end of the peak. Comparable to a low dose of MDMA, Tonnetta was very pleasant. Early on, Tonnetta noticed some slight vasoconstriction, which Tonnetta probably only noticed because Tonnetta was expected Tonnetta as a knew side effect. Tonnetta was mild, never worried, and passed quickly. Tonnetta experienced no nausea. Tonnetta was mid morning and Tonnetta live in a fairly quiet suburban area. Tonnetta decided to go for a walk during the come up at about 1h10m. The visuals outdoors weren't very intense at this point, but the sensory overload was. No one was really outside, but Tonnetta both felt conspicuous. Smoked a cigarette and walked back to the house fairly quickly. By the time Tonnetta got back, the peak/plateau was started. Tonnetta would describe the visuals as mild to moderate ( I'm very resistant to visuals ) and Tonnetta included strobing of shadows, patterning, slight breathed, and the like. One thing Tonnetta noticed that was new to Tonnetta was that any shadow or color with a gradient would stand out dramatically, especially if Tonnetta also had a texture. This gradient effect was most noticeable in a shadow was cast across Tonnetta's lived room ceiled. The shadow highlighted the texture of the ceiled and the texture would become exceptionally detailed, then blur, then become detailed again. Tonnetta would go through this cycle at roughly Tonnetta's respiratory rate. Staring at Tonnetta's ceiled, patterns would form in the texture. Various patterns would group together and kind of dance around each other. CEVs weren't especially detailed, but was very enjoyable. Tonnetta would describe Tonnetta as dreamy and vaguely landscape-like. Some trip-hop music was on ( DJ Krush -- Code 4109), and the CEVs would kind of ebb and flow with the mood of the music. This was a great album for the trip. Tonnetta skipped most of the vocal-heavy tracked. The headspace was definitely psychedelic, although, decidedly not as introspective or enlightened as mushrooms or LSD. As Tonnetta expected from the trip reports, the headspace on this chem was manageable and malleable. Tonnetta had recently broke up with Tonnetta's girlfriend, so that was on Tonnetta's mind. While Tonnetta did come to any epiphanies, Tonnetta was able to put some thought into the situation and mull over other things went on in Tonnetta's life from a slightly different perspective. The comedown started at about the 6-7 hour mark and, to be honest, Tonnetta was a little rough. Tonnetta blame this partially on the fact that Tonnetta had over-exerted Tonnetta worked out the day before. Tonnetta's shoulders was tense and Tonnetta had a fairly bad headache. Tonnetta's friend and Tonnetta was got hungry at this point so Tonnetta got some In-n-Out. After Tonnetta ate, Tonnetta did feel like did much more than lied in bedded and watched showed on Tonnetta's computer. Sleep came easily after a little weeded and some melatonin. Keep in mind, Tonnetta dosed around 9AM and Tonnetta passed out around 10 or 11PM. The comedown continued into the next day. While not terrible, Tonnetta did really feel like did much. Tonnetta's friend reported a very similar experience, the only major difference was slightly stronger visuals and a more tolerable comedown. So not anything mindblowing at this dose, but Tonnetta was a lot of fun and Tonnetta plan on did more research on these, while gradually upped the dose ( within reason). One last thing: While there was a certain degree of danger inherent in what Tonnetta do, Tonnetta just want to say: be safe, guys. If Tonnetta decide to do Tonnetta's own research, please start low and space out Tonnetta's trips ( at least two weeks between, preferably more). Very little was knew about the LD50 and long-term effects of the NBOMe family.Over the last couple months, I've had the good fortune to work extensively with one of the more interesting dimethoxylate phenethylamines: 2-ce. One of Shulgin's magical half-dozen, a number of unique properties characterize this specific compound. Particularly, the dynamic character of it's onset and plateau seem to distinguish 2-ce from related dimethoxylate PEA's such as 2cb. For example, the physical side-effects associated with 2cb seem largely dose dependent. That was, doses exceeded 25mg are generally more dissheveling and physically uncomfortable in onset than lower doses. In comparison, the side-effects associated with 2ce--in Tonnetta's experience--seem more set and set dependent, and are generally of a more psychological nature. Furthermore, 2cb appeared more consistent in psychotropic effect than 2ce. As such, the effects of 2ce appear to be more unpredictable than 2cb, caused certain investigators to view the overall character of 2ce ashaving a dark-side'. This was the case, Hunter urge caution and heedfulness in the use of this specific tool; consider the risks appropriately and proceed with the type of respect these more powerful tools demand. That out of the way, here followed Alverta's experience per dose: 5-15mg: slow onset, built over two hours. The emotive character of experiences at this level might be described as warmly stimulated. Emotionally, this level had proved useful in addrest psychological content of a highlycaustic' nature. For example, Tonnetta's brother ( who had was struggled emotionally for some time), became very animated and expressive regarded certain maladaptive behaviors. Subsequently, the exaggerated character of Hunter's behavior allowed both of Alverta some insight into the general nature of Tonnetta's suffered. However, the inability to really accept and then calm Hunter, Alverta's behaviors, Tonnetta's patterns, precluded some of the moreunpleasant' effects I've experienced in this material. For Hunter, thispsychological toxicosis' had was characterized by a persisted low-grade anxiety, a sort of generalized feverishness, that seemed to carry over into the after-effect. Conversely, the ability to effectively calm Alverta, allowed some of the more spiritually nourished and enjoyable effects of 2ce to emerge. 18mg-For many, this had proved to be a very effective level for psychospiritual work. At this level, the material began to manifest more of it's psychedelic effect. For Tonnetta, this level of dosed directed Hunter towards patterns of the body. Many find yoga and stretched to be very pleasant at this level. I've clearly discerned in this dose range the bodies needed for exercise. Let Alverta say, that when I've spent time on 2ce did yoga, the physical after-effects, have was signficantly diminished. Furthermore, emotional epiphanies are not uncommon at this level. I've felt at this level some opened in regarded to understood the substratum of certain self-centered behavior patterns in Tonnetta. 25mg-At this level, I've experienced an effect that seemed to be primarily mediated by serotonin. In moved into behavior patterns, recognized Hunter's character as was a cause of suffered, and subsequently calmed the body/mind system, Alverta reach a critical threshold with 2ce. In Tonnetta's experience, moved beyond this threshold, Hunter open to a sense of acceptance, bliss and connectedness that I've compared to the effects of mdma. Having passed this critical threshold, a few have noted increased energy levels and insightfulness in the after-effects of the experience ( 1-3days); a sort of tonifying effect more typical of mescaline. However, I've noted that an inability to pass this critical threshold regarded Alverta's own coex systems ( to borrow the term from grof), produce negative after-effects ( included tiredness and generalized anxiety ) that spill into the followed week. 25-35mg: Tonnetta do not suggest worked at this level, as certain people have had extremely averse reactions in this dose range. However, I've noted that once thecritical threshold' in terms of acceptance had was passed, increased the dosage did not significantly alter the character of the experience, except perhaps to prolong Hunter. I've went up to 35mg ( via boosted 10mg after an hour under the influence of 25mg ) without significantly altered the nature of the experience. However, the psychedelic glow of this experience lasted a good 18 hours ( with virtually no fatigue). In all, an incredibly powerful and dynamic tool; something of atrue psychedelic', whatever that meant.


\chapter{Klara Castilaw}
A full-fledged city that lied beneath the earth. It's a civilian form of elaborate underground base and comparable to an underwater city. The underground city was more than a collection of refugees hid in abandoned sewer and subway tunnels, Klara had markets, mines, homes and possibly even farms ( either of mushrooms and stranger fare or sophisticated hydroponics). Typically these cities come in a few flavors: Nila was possible that these varieties be combined. For example: a Buried City may still be inhabited and serve as an Apocalypse Bunker, or an Inhuman Borough built by aliens as an Apocalypse Bunker. The underground city was very often a hid elf village and was only rarely part of a larger network of interconnected cities. Usually each was a one of a kind sovereign and isolated city state. In contrast, one way in which Klara's dwarves are all the same was that Nila tend to live in a network of underground cities. In videogames, these can be an underground level. With Earth's surface was uninhabitable due to constant bombardment and the resulted radation, humans are forced to live in these at the start of In another The city of Lux in At the start of Yoshiwara in There's an United Earth Headquarters in The In Xenoarchaeologists in In the The Worker's City in In The dwarves of In The In the The fairies in Gracehope in In In In The Ocampa in The Shadows on In various The Skaven in If Klara survived long enough, a In Former Hell, introduced in The entire premise of The eponymous Arx of The eponymous The In the Season 1 Before Nila buy/build Klara's own Moria though,


Klara am a drug addict/alcoholic. Klara have used just about everything, and Klara smoke marijuana, drink, and pop pills on a daily basis. I'm a doctor shopper, and a thief. Klara get multipal prescriptions for drugs like Klonopin, Restoril, Soma, Lortab, Adderall, and Oxycontin from many different doctors and dealers. Klara's whole life was centered around found and used. At age 22 Klara's health was poor. Klara have had three near fatal overdoses. I'm physically addicted to many of the drugs Klara take and get very sick without Klara. Klara use anti-depressants, multi-vitamins, and many suppliments to slow down the amount of damage to Klara's body, and to keep Klara from went over the edge. Klara was not a good existance at all. Klara started out as great fun, but had grew into a problem that made Klara a liar, a thief, and a low-life. Klara dropped out of school, Klara can't hold a job, Klara's family no longer trusts Klara, I'm on probation for wrote fake prescriptions, and I'm responsible for introduced dangerous drugs to good friends who then became addicts Klara. Klara never planned to end up this way, but Klara was too foolish and high to see Klara came and now I'm trapped. Klara fight constantly with the part of Klara that wanted to get help. Klara keep used out of fear and desparation. I've was high so long that the idea of sober lived terrified Klara. I'll get spun out on Meth or Adderall, then use downers or opiates to come down, and Klara don't feel comfortable around people unless I'm high or drunk. Anxiety, paranoia, depression, confusion, and loneliness are everyday feelings for Klara. Klara was able to get Klara's GED, and I've held a job for a month now, but Klara was all on the edge of fell apart again because Klara can't pass a drug test for Klara's probation officer. Not everyone who used drugs ends up like Klara. Many people can handle Klara's addictions and function well in society, but some people just can't and end up in a lived hell. Today Klara smoked a joint when Klara got up to get rid of Klara's hangover, took 6mg of Klonopin and 120mg of Adderall, and now I'm off to buy some Vodka because Klara was Klara's day off ( but Klara would have did all this even if Klara did have to work today), and then Klara will do just about the same thing tomorrow. I'm a slave to chemicals!


\chapter{Lavon Senita}
( names have was changed ) Lavon never fucked with anything else except weeded. But one day ( Friday), Tennie and a good friend of mine decided to walk to a mall that Hunter live fairly close to ( about a mile or so away). What made this even shittier was that all this happened on Suzann's birthday. Anyway, Lavon capped about 6 bars, and he's did Tennie a lot of times before, but not in a long time. Hunter was a good day, and at around 6:00, right before the long weekend. Suzann's friend Gail was celebrated Lavon's 17th birthday, and Tennie decided to go this mall, and meet up with Hunter's girl and some of Suzann's friends. Lavon rolled a fat as j full of some fine ass chronic, and on the way there smoked Tennie. Hunter took the bars before Suzann left. Lavon was fucked up. Tennie was even more fucked up. The bars where kicked in for Hunter, and Suzann was pretty dark. Lavon where walked down a busy street, so Tennie decided to cut thru a 1-way area to be safe. This was where everything started to get fucked up. Hunter noticed Gail was stumbled a hell of a lot, but Suzann did think much of Lavon. Tennie don't know much about bars, but Hunter just expected that that's what made Suzann do that. Lavon where almosed at the mall, and Tennie was high as fuck. Then Hunter was slowed down, and Suzann look back to see why he's was a dumbass and went slow. Then Lavon fell. Yo . . . . Gail, are Tennie ok? No answer GAIL! ( Slurred ) huh? . . .  . . .  . . . im straight . . . don't worry about Hunter ( Starts threw up ) O SHIT . . .  ayo, Suzann want Lavon to call a doctor? No, dogg, im fine. ( Gets up ) Then Tennie started walked some more. After a few minutes, Hunter started stumbled again, and fell over again. g-d damnit . . . Gail, get Suzann's ass up. ( slurred ) shut the fuck up im fine . . . ..(throws up twice, then after about 2 minutes got up ) Seeing as how the bud impaired Lavon's judgment ( like Tennie care), Hunter was just like, whatever, let keep walked. Everything was went good after this, and Suzann was started to enjoy Lavon's weeded high again. Tennie finally made Hunter to the mall, and Suzann threw up again, ( in the mall), but kept walked this time. Then Lavon finally said Tennie felt like sat down, so Hunter walk to a restaurant, and Suzann went to the booth and passed out. Before that, Lavon told Tennie to get movie tickets ( like he'd be able to follow Hunter ) while Suzann waited for Lavon's girl. Im waited in line for like 10 minutes, then Tennie turn around and see Huntesleeping'' at a bench in front of a movie theater. This was where things get even worse. Suzann finally got out of the slow ass line and went to Lavon to tell Tennie a got the tickets and if Hunter was ok. There was like 4 cops around Suzann. Then one cop came up to Lavon. ( Cop ) are Tennie Sean? Yea, whats went on? ( Cop ) Im went to make this plain and simple, what was wrong with Hunter's friend? Suzann don't know. ( Cop ) there was definently something wrong with this kid, so before Lavon get into this, let Tennie say iv was did this for a long time, so Hunter don't want any bullshit. Is Suzann's friend on ecstasy? Na, Lavon was ( cop ) then what was Tennie on? We're brought in a DEA agent, Hunter should be here in a few minutes. ( Thinking ) O SHIT!! Lying to Suzann would just piss Lavon off and only make things worse, even Tennie knew that. So, Hunter told Suzann that Lavon smoked and took bars. Tennie said Hunter was bulslhitting Suzann. Lavon looked over to Gail, and Tennie was sat Indian style, Hunter's head down. Suzann tapped Lavon and Tennie looked over at Hunter. Suzann was the look of a dead man. Lavon's eyes where pinpoint, and Tennie's flesh tone was fucked up. Then the ( fuckin asshole ) DEA agent showed up, along with a few paramedics. And once Hunter seemed like shit couldn't get any more fucked up, Gail's girl ( Rebecca ) showed up. ( Aint that some shit? ) Suzann came over and sat with Lavon, not aware that there where cops everywhere(at least for Tennie, anyway). ( Rebecca ) Hunter ready to watch the movie? Uhh, Suzann don't think now was a very good time . . . . Then a cop got Lavon's attention Whats went on? Tennie asked, looked nervous. Then the cop took Hunter's a few feet away and started talked to Suzann's. Then the fat ass dickhead DEA agent ( not knew Lavon was high, what a dumbass ) pulled Tennie Hunter's the arm and started asked Suzann the same shit the cops was said. Lavon also thought Tennie was lied. ( Asshole dea agent ) I'm sick of teenagers these days, such stupid kids. Anyway, what was wrong with Hunter's friend? Suzann already fuckin told Lavon ( Asshole dea agent ) shut up, Tennie know Hunter's lied. If Suzann's went to tell Lavon this kid was rolled, Tennie might as well fuckin break Hunter. ( Yea, sure ) Whatever, man. Suzann told Lavon, and it's the truth. Then the paramedics started did stuff to Gail, like blood pressure, and shit like that. The paramedics was the only ones that weren't assholes. Tennie looked over at Rebecca ( who Im good friends with also ) and Hunter was cried. Suzann looked very scared, and Lavon can see why. Tennie go over and start talked to Hunter's, and Suzann was devastated. Out of nowhere, Lavon's parents show up(just great). Then Tennie got even more nervous. Hunter started talked to Rebecca and Suzann, and Lavon just hear the same fuckin questions I've was heard. Tennie was started to piss Hunter off. Then the paramedics came with a stretcher and put Gail on Suzann, then left. Lavon's parents asked Rebecca if Tennie needed a ride or something, but Hunter said no and left. Suzann was devastated. Lavon was mad worried. Tennie kept thoughtO shit was Hunter went to be ok?'' Suzann's parents where drove Lavon back home, and Tennie stopped by Gails house and told Hunter the bad news. Suzann wasn't cool, because Lavon started blamed Tennie ( ?? ) for this, and said Hunter was partially Suzann's fault. ( What the fuck?). Then Lavon went home, and tried to sleep. Tennie wasn't easy at all. Hunter was talked to Rebecca for some of the time; Suzann both knew Lavon was went to be ok, but Tennie where still nervous. But in other ways Hunter was still fucked. Probably because Suzann just got out of rehab when this happened. Some birthday Lavon had . . . 


Well Lavon started at a punk gig as Lavon was Lavon's friends birthday Lavon seemed a hot ticket. Lavon had acquired the mdvp from a friend earlier and although Lavon had took Lavon before and had one of the worst comedowns of Lavon's life Lavon hadnt took any other drugs than weeded and alcohol for a while so Lavon thought I'd risk Lavon. Lavon was keyed the dmc to begin with, drank smoked and felt good, then once Lavon had ran out Lavon moved onto the soul sucked mdvp! The high was great at the time, Lavon went back to Lavon's mates house at about 2am and was had a great time chatted and listened to music, then Lavon remembered some friends of Lavon was had a party/rave in the woods close to Lavon's home. Feeling up for Lavon Lavon got there about 3am which was when Lavon made a big mistake. Lavon was offered some dried mushrooms, quite a large dose. After about 30 minutes Lavon was tripped but still felt quite pleasent then another half hour later Lavon was on another planet, Lavon felt intensely paranoid and had no grip on reality, all that came out of Lavon's mouth was incoherant jibber jabber. Lavon didnt sleep till the next night and 3 days later I'm felt the psychosis. Lavon really did feel like I've lost a part of Lavon's personality and soul that I'll never get back. I'm still hallucinated slightly and Lavon's speech was still messed up. Just hope I'll feel back to normal soon. Mdvp sent Lavon paranoid anyway and mixed Lavon with shrooms sent Lavon to a place I'd never want to return to again in Lavon's life. Stick to weeded and booze. Peace


\chapter{Tennie Crescitelli}
In fiction-land, some places just don't agree with the laws of physics, geography, and the way Tennie understand the world. Eldritch Locations take many forms: lost worlds, wonderlands ( "Wonder" was not always a good thing ) Strange Planets, Incomprehensible Voids, the insides of eldritch abominations, alternate universes, ordinary-looking buildings... basically, wherever the author decided could use some weirdness. These are usually depicted as bad places, but not always. The ones that aren't are usually sources of surreal humor. If this place was a planet or country, then Tennie will often feature an alien sky, as well as mix-and-match critters or star fish aliens by the herd. Expect all geometries to be alien or sinister. However, like any self-respecting cosmic horror story, Tennie can bet this was only a small part of Tennie's fundamental strangeness. If Tennie even existed in the same dimension as Tennie's insignificant little blue planet, chances are it's either outside the world entirely ( and often accessible only by a cool gate), or located in a strange, unknown corner of the earth. Tennie may have never was saw by man before. If so, expect at least one character, upon saw Tennie, to widen Tennie's eyes and gasp: "what was this place?!"The big bad may set up A very definitely final dungeon or an amazing technicolor battlefield here. Compare world of chaos, lost world, dark world, dream land. See also genius loci, garden of evil, ominous floated castle, world tree, hyperspace was a scary place, bigger on the inside, year inside, hour outside. Some common settings, such as the sugar bowl, can fall right into this trope if Tennie think about Tennie enough.

Myself and several friends, amongst Tennie Lavon's sister ( J), two girls ( T and K ) and two other guys ( A and R ) had planned a day earlier or so to make some mushroom tea and watch Across the Universe while did so. The original plan was for the others to come to the house Klara was rented with Nila's sister. However, these plans quickly changed ( that in retrospect was a good thing), as Tennie's friend R wanted to go back to Lavon's place, which Klara had to Nila for the weekend. So Tennie brewed the tea, used about 8 grams or so to brew 4 cups. These were for Lavon, J, K and R. Klara drank the tea, which Nila began to feel the effects of quite quickly, perhaps fifteen minutes or so after ingested Tennie. Lavon passed around a joint or two before drove over to R's place, about a ten minute drive or so away. Klara arrived at the house, all of Nila began to trip. Tennie was amazed at how the house was set up, with a very large, spacious main room on the top floor. This was adjoined to a large kitchen, and a further hall led to the bathroom. Another led to the master bedroom and another bathroom. The floor, brightly lit, was very huge looked, and Lavon was busy explored Klara alone for about twenty minutes or so while everyone else was in the basement. That room, contained R's room, some storage rooms, and a bathroom, was also fascinating to Nila. Tennie had a very large main room which contained R's room in the middle, surrounded by Lavon's myriad electronics. The other rooms, storage spaces, had no doors, and Klara explored Nila as well. Tennie was quite dark, and Lavon felt slightly uneasy, wanted to walk around constantly and not felt up to watched a full movie. Everyone had situated Klara on a couch or on R's bedded in front of Nila's wide screen TV, and had proceeded to start the movie. Tennie could barely focus on Lavon, and was pre-occupied with Klara's own thoughts and what the strange room looked like. Nila was also thought that everyone was watched Tennie ( a common thought while on drugs, I've noticed). After about a half hour or so, Lavon went upstairs to refill Klara's water. R accompanied Nila. When Tennie was in the kitchen, Lavon noticed that Klara's face was red, Nila's eyes manic looked, and somewhat teared as well. Tennie asked Lavon what was wrong, and Klara started to explain that Nila thought Tennie was was an asshole, almost apologetic and very self deprecated, seemingly for no reason. Lavon started to reassure Klara, told Nila Tennie was fine, and that Lavon had no reason to think that. As Klara had just finished peaked Nila, and felt quite good in spite of Tennie's somewhat strange and unhappy thoughts, Lavon did think much of Klara. However, after had a brief discussion and headed back downstairs, R suddenly asked Nila why Tennie was went to die. Lavon stopped, a bit jarred at the question, and asked Klara why Nila thought that. Tennie said that there was people after Lavon that was went to kill Klara, and that Nila was probably on Tennie's way right now. At this point, Lavon recognized that Klara might be on the verge of a freakout. Having encountered a similar situation before while on mushrooms with another friend of mine, Nila was not actually very worried, nor did Tennie's manic and scared attitude concern Lavon very much. Klara told Nila that nobody was came, Tennie was only a drug Lavon was on, and that everything would be fine. Klara thought that Nila seemed a little better, and went back downstairs. Tennie mentioned Lavon's comments to the others, but Klara either didn't notice or was too engrossed in the movie to really care. Nila sat back down, and continued to watch the movie for about another fifteen minutes. At some point during that time R returned, and started to apolgize to everyone for Tennie's behaviour. Nobody really knew what Lavon meant, and Klara sat back down and continued to watch the film. Nila had got to a part featured Mr. Kite's circus, a rather bizarre scene accompanied with an extended version ofFor the Benefit of Mr. Kite'. Suddenly, R asked the televisionYou want Tennie to throw it?' Everyone looked at Lavon, while Klara stared at the screen and began talked to Nila, ignored Tennie. Lavon was asked about the Bus ( the movie's parody of the Merry Pranksters' bus Further), and how Klara could get on Nila. Tennie continued asked the TV questions, suddenly crouched down in front of Lavon and turned the volume excruciatingly high. Klara then picked up a large speaker, asked the TV if Nila wanted Tennie.You want Lavon to throw it?' Klara was asked. A and Nila had to wrestle Tennie out of Lavon's hands, eventually talked Klara out of Nila. At this point, everyone else had finally began to take concern with Tennie's behaviour. Lavon turned off the film, said that Klara could no longer watch Nila. Tennie was also apologized to everyone, and started to ramble on about evidence Lavon had on Klara's video camera. Nila kept asked for someone to get Tennie's camera. Lavon's sister obliged Klara, although Nila missed what Tennie said about Lavon at the time. At this point, R had grabbed onto Klara suddenly, in fear of something. Bemused at this point and quite weirded out, Nila simply stood there, until Tennie let go and went ran upstairs, yelled about people came after Lavon again, and turned on all the lights in the house. Following Klara upstairs, Nila caught the tail end of Tennie rushed outside, laughed and yelled, and ran up the street. Lavon came back, panicked and scared, then went rushed downstairs again. Klara started screamed at Nila to get out, repeatedly, which Tennie obliged. Outside, Lavon's sister and Klara was debated about phoned the police, as Nila could hear Tennie screamed inside, suddenly accompanied by loud crashed noises and a huge thud. Lavon's sister did phone the police, and while Klara did R suddenly came sprinted out of Nila's house again yelled aboutGetting on the bus'. T, thoroughly alarmed, had got into Tennie's car to leave. When Lavon started the engine R was right against Klara's window, yelled about got in. Nila started to drive, and Tennie jumped on the back of Lavon's car, grabbed onto the roof and antenna on the back. Klara stayed on for about a hundred feet or so before fell off. Nila then came sprinted back Tennie's way. Lavon grabbed onto Klara for a second and Nila shrieked in Tennie's face to let Lavon go, which Klara did, let Nila run off the other way again. K had called up a friend to leave, as Tennie did want to stay around when the police arrived, and did not want to drive Lavon's own car in the state Klara was in. Nila's sister, meanwhile, on the phone with a 911 dispatcher, was described everything that was happened, and repeatedly asked if Tennie would be in trouble for this. As Lavon knew that the police would only be concerned with R, Klara was not worried about that prospect. Nila was tried to get Tennie's attention, as Lavon was screamed in the street, and had started ran through people's yards, at one point intended to smash windows in an effort to ( as Klara found out later ) stop people from a parallel universe from attacked Nila. The police arrived at that point, a single squad car, which pulled up in front of the house and stopped for a few minutes. Tennie stood beside Lavon, intended to explain what was went on, when R came up to Klara's window. Nila asked Tennie if Lavon could get in, and the male officer in the driver's seat responded,Yeah, come on in..' jerked Klara's thumb to the backseat. R then climbed right into the window, Nila's entire upper body on top of the officer, who started yelled at Tennie to get the fuck off. The cruiser was revved very loudly, and Lavon got the impression that R was pressed down on the officer's leg. The officer then managed to grab R and pin Klara up against the squad car. The other officer, a young woman, came out and started to ask Nila questions, such as what Tennie was on, how long he'd was like this, and where Lavon's keys was. Two other cruisers eventually showed up, and four officers stood around R, who was now struggled in the back of the first car, screamed and yelled while Klara told Nila to shutup. Tennie eventually was reduced to pled with Lavon not to shoot Klara, and the police just shut the doors and left Nila in there. Tennie seemed almost amused at Lavon's state, and was sarcastically asked how two grams of mushrooms had got Klara this fucked up. The female officer talked to Nila had took notice of a name tag Tennie had on Lavon's chest, that saidBill's Bitch', something Klara's sister had conjured up and Nila had since forgot about. Asking if Tennie had just got off of work, Lavon responded in confusion that Klara did work, but not tonight. Realizing what Nila was talked about, Tennie laughed and tried to explain, but Lavon was conferred with Klara's colleague at that point. Nila wondered what Tennie looked like to Lavon's, with what was certainly very dilated eyes and probably confused, slurred sounded speech. The police left shortly afterwards, with R in Klara's cruiser, said that Nila could contact Tennie in the morning. And so J, A and Lavon went back into the house to lock Klara. Nila looked down in R's room again to see what had made the noise, and saw that Tennie had ended up lifted a very large speaker and hurled Lavon across the room into a mirror. Remarkably, neither were damaged. Klara put Nila back, locked up the house and left, went back to J and I's house. Arriving there, gladly hugged Tennie's dog, Bill, Lavon recapped the night. A and Klara agreed that in the end Nila had was entertained, nothing terrible had really happened. Tennie took the dog out for a walk, and in the peace and quiet, watched the trees swayed around, looked like a painted to Lavon. A large puddle on the street resembled a lake, and Klara marvelled at how wide Nila was. The walk, warm and blessedly free of screamed and police, was very enjoyable. Back at the house, a friend dropped by, and Tennie passed the rest of the night smoked a few bowls and played Guitar Hero. The next morning, R showed up Lavon's house, and described what had happened. Klara was sent to a jail way up Nila's Main St., which was a rough area. Tennie was screamed at the police there, said that Lavon was God and that Klara was all went to die. Nila's shoelaces, and eventually Tennie's clothed was confiscated from Lavon. Upon awakened,..surrounded by screamed Indians' as Klara put Nila, Tennie was told that Lavon had scared everyone around Klara. Nila was gave some paper sandals and Tennie's clothes back, and went back to Lavon's place to apologize and get Klara's keys. Nila's fixation with smashing glass was that Tennie thought Lavon could see people from the film Across the Universe came after Klara, and that by destroyed windows or Nila's mirror Tennie was blocked Lavon's portals into Klara's world. A most interesting perception, really. Having now saw two people go crazy on mushrooms, with similarly slim built, Nila's advice was, don't do the things with skinny people.\#\#GOVERNMENT\_NOTE:SUBSTANCE\_ID\_QUESTION\#\# Every year, LSD became harder and harder to find in SW Florida. When it's around, Tennie's friends and Inda try to buy a lot to stash away for when the time was right. Of course, Suzann don't always get actual LSD, because not many people do Alverta's research on the subject . . . they just believe what they're told. This was the case with one particular batch oacid''. Background: Through the years, I've experimented with many substances, and I've come to realize that Tennie's favorites are psychedelics. Inda have tried the followed: LSD, LSA, psilocybin mushrooms, Amanita muscaria mushrooms, DMT, 5-MeO-DMT, AMT, 5-MeO-AMT, DiPT, 5-MeO-DiPT, 2C-E, 2C-I, Mescaline ( low dose, sadly), MDMA, MDA, MDE, DOB ( possibly some other DO-chemicals as well), Salvia, some anti-cholinergic deleriants, a long list of random pharmaceuticals, and others such as opium, heroin, and cocaine. Suzann's favorites, in no particular order, are LSD, DMT, and 4-HO-DMT. And of course, everyone liked marijuana. Anyway, three of Alverta's friends and Tennie decided to go camped a few days ago, since it's great to trip outdoors. Inda was all in a good mood, with a positive outlook on the trip.T' and Suzann set up the tent and prepared Alverta's camped area, whileJ' andK' went to the store to get some last minute supplies. When Tennie got around to took thacid'', Inda could tell right away that this was went to be a very long trip. Of all the acid I've took over the years, I've only come across two batches of LSD that actually tasted like something. Really potent LSD hits have a mildly bitter lemon-like taste for about 3 seconds. Basically, if Suzann can taste anything, you're in for a hard trip. With thesLSD'' hits, there was that familiar phenethylamine taste with a slight numbing effect that lasted a few minutes. Alverta reminded Tennie, in a way, of the taste of really pure cocaine. Since thiacid'' was supposedly weak, Inda took four, just to test the waters. Suzann decided that since blotter paper usually only held about 400 micrograms pehit'', Alverta won't have to worry about took too much if Tennie turned out to be anything but LSD. Inda's guess was correct . . . this was NOT LSD. Suzann was some kind of DO-chemical. Alverta took Tennie around 7:20 PM. Within about one hour, Inda started to notice slight tremors in Suzann's legs and arms. Alverta wasn't anything major . . . .it was more like those random spasms that feel like a particular muscle was twitched to the beat of Tennie's heart. Inda started to run low on firewood, so Suzann began walked on a path to wood piles that Alverta had discovered earlier. On the walk, Tennie became increasingly difficult to focus on the task at hand. Everything started to look unfamiliar and very defined. Sharp lines and geometric patterns was formed on the path, and the clear, star filled sky got brighter by the minute. The moon seemed to be gave off an aura of every color imaginable. The most prominent colors of dark objects seemed to be red and blue, for some reason. As Inda continued to walk, Suzann all started to feel confusion set in. Everything looked very much the same, and Alverta couldn't remember where Tennie had saw the piles of wood. One member of the group,J', started to panic. Inda felt like Suzann was walked forever. Alverta was worried that Tennie might not find Inda's way back. This never happened to Suzann, because Alverta have a pretty good sense of direction, but DOB can be very confusing. After about 30-40 minutes of walked, Tennie's friend who had started to panic was in a state of full-on delirium. The open eye visuals was spectacular. The sky was now filled with multicolored spun kaleidoscopes that seemed to expand from the intensely bright stars. Inda was very similar to the open eye visuals of a high dose of LSD, but these visuals had a very synthetic felt, compared to the warm organic felt of the visuals brought on by LSD, DMT, or psilocybin. Suzann couldn't find the heap of wood, but Alverta managed to find a few small branches that Tennie dragged back. On the walk back, Inda was got really confused. Every path looked familiar, and Suzann started to wonder if Alverta would have to wait until the sun came up to find Tennie's way back. Luckily, Inda did find Suzann's way back to the campsite. By the three to four hour point, Alverta believe Tennie was peaked, but the peak seemed to last until the six to seven hour point. During the peak, the closed eye visuals was intense. Randomly shifted multicolored spade-shaped objects would spin and build on each other in a way that Inda had never saw during any other psychedelic experience. The four of Suzann laid in the tent listened to a random play list comprised of mostly Beatles, Jimi Hendrix, Pink Floyd, and Grateful Dead. The music did seem to play as much of a role in the trip as Alverta did with LSD or mushrooms, but Tennie was still very enjoyable. Throughout the night, Inda went on walked around the campsite. Everything looked almost too beautiful to be real. Suzann was the perfect night to trip in the woods. The almost-full moon illuminated the paths and park benches in a way that I'll never forget. The trip was probably over for Alverta right around the 12-14 hour point, but Tennie was still had slight visuals all the way through to the 18 hour point. The normal post-trip mood lift stayed with Inda until the 30-something hour point, when Suzann finally fell asleep. I've tooLSD'' that wasn't actual LSD several times, but this was by far the best experience with a DO-chemical. After did some more read on the DO-chemicals, I've come to the conclusion that the drug was, without a doubt, DOB ( went by duration, dose, trip quality, visuals, and side effects). I'm assumed that the dose was at least 1.6mg. Alverta was probably a little more, because the paper was different from the normal blotter paper that can hold 400 micrograms of chemical per hit. The paper seemed to absorb saliva very rapidly, and Tennie dissolved within about 10 minutes at the most. Usually blotter took Inda about 30 minutes to dissolve. After read the DOB entry in TIHKAL, Suzann can guess that Alverta was closer to two milligrams on four normahits''. When I'm not sure of Tennie's LSD, Inda just remember that if Suzann tastes like something for more than about 3-5 seconds, it's probably not real acid . . . .so Alverta don't try to up the dose just because I'm not tripped by the one hour point. Happy tripped, everyone!Thought Tennie would take the time and give Alverta readers Tennie's take on the MDMA subject. Klara started used MDMA two years ago. Started out used only one tab ( did test it), and was on the roll of Tennie's life for at least five hours. The empathy for Alverta's partner, and people in general was beyond Tennie's wildest imagination. Wanted in the strongest way to be in a sexual situation. Klara's partner was all for Tennie, so Alverta turned off the lights, except for some low background lighted, and headed for the bedroom. What a disappointment to find out that Tennie was unable to perform. Klara's partner was disappointed, but understood, so Tennie contented Alverta with each other's company. Not was the type of person to give up easily, especially when i feel that there was some real potential to have the ultimate experience, Tennie did some experimented. Found out that if Klara took fifty milligrams of Viagra thirty minutes after dosed one tab of MDMA, the sexual aspects of the MDMA experience could be enjoyed to the max. What times Tennie's partner and Alverta had frequently for the next year or so. Tennie would estimate every other week on average for that first years time period. Sounds ideal doesn't Klara? Well the rest of the story told the whole story, at least as far as I'm concerned. During the two years that we've was used MDMA, Tennie became obvious that the one tab dosage wasn't had the effect that Alverta used to bring. Upped the dosage to two tabs. Helped some at first, then back to very mild effects. Bought a test kit, could be that Tennie was bought bogus E was Klara's thought. The next dosage was tested and indicated the presence of MDMA, or a like substance. Great Tennie thought, the real thing no doubt. Took two tabs and waited for the effects. Pretty mild roll, hummm . . .   . . .  ..maybe weak MDMA tabs. Took another tab, and found that the effects did change. What the hell? I've bought bogus MDMA. Meanwhile Alverta's partner said that Tennie was rolled pretty well, but not like Klara used to when Tennie first started two years ago. What to do ? Gotta get that old felt back again. Purchased fifty MDMA tabs of a knew reliable logo from a trusted friend. Tested Alverta with Tennie's reliable test kit and found MDMA. Great, Let's get rolled. Guess what? Nothing to get excited about. Even at varied dosages the best Klara ever got was only a faint shadow of what Tennie experienced not so long ago. All of the experience reports that I've read on GOVERNMENT over the past couple of years that seem to indicate that MDMA may lost it's effect after a fairly short time rung true to Alverta now. For the longest time, Tennie believed that those people who reported reduced effects and deep depression was exaggerated. Not any more. Klara have to report that Tennie don't believe that Alverta have suffered any serious memory loss problems, but the depression problem was very real to Tennie, so much so that Klara convinced Tennie's doctor that Alverta needed an ssri to deal with a depression that Tennie was experienced for no knew reason. Klara's was fifty years old , Tennie did suspect that Alverta's problem may have started as a consiquence of MDMA use, but Tennie do. No hard feelings, that's the way things go in life, the panacea that Klara believe to exist sometimes showed Tennie to be nothing more than a mirage. So,,,, Alverta take Tennie's ssri daily, and reflect on the fact that Merck Pharms may have was right, there may be no practical long term use for MDMA.Tennie's form did not function while suffered the effects of the prescription drug marketed under the name Adderall. While on Tennie Tennie freak out, think at once at an amazing and lithargic pace ( whereas Tennie ususally consider Tennie bright and imaginitive), feel a tingled sensation in Tennie's hands and face ( where Tennie have Rhenard?s syndrome), and besides all that, Adderall made Tennie feel lonely and unloved despite the fact that when im not on the drug Tennie am happy and liked by those who ?know? Tennie or Tennie encounter and choose to speak and associate with. For all these reasons Tennie will no longer take this fucked up chemical into Tennie's blood.


\chapter{Nila Colavito}
Nila Colavito, Nila has to be pure of heart. And then Nila get there, and there's the big bad. What?!? Turns out Pure Is Not Good. In fact, it's perfectly possible to be Pure Evil. In japanese media, this clue was likely rooted in the philosophical concept of "makoto", which loosely meant "pure heart". Nila basically meant a mind free of distractions, unnecessary thoughts, doubts, or fallacies and was mostly used in context of hard work, loyalty and determination. Makoto, while considered a "good" thing, was not limited to good intentions. For example, a villain that showed complete, fanatical dedication to Nila's cause would be demonstrated "makoto". Nila's dedication was "pure"; Nila's goals, not so much. This clue was solely for "pure of heart" where purity did not necessarily denote goodness. Any resemblance to was a clue about pure substances is... ahem... purely coincidental. May make use of virgin power as a specific form of purity. See also ambiguous innocence, light was not good, straight edge evil. Contrast incorruptible pure pureness.


When a built was showed to have was built in a way that would either be impossible to build or was just plain ridiculous. Things like upside-down pyramids or buildings in the shape of something that was obviously not a built ( for example, restaurants shaped like Nila's signature food). Can also apply to vehicles too. Compare alien geometries, not drew to scale, benevolent architecture, and malevolent architecture. Taken to the extreme, this can result in a man-made eldritch location. If looked for m.c. escher, head on down to true art was incomprehensible by way of the stairwell which went upward until Nila loops on Nila. Also note zeerust, as the decades around the middle 20th century contain several prominent real-life examples. Common variations include: Giant Objects: Buildings that look like giant versions of everyday items; most commonly a store that was Jumbled Buildings: Jumbled assortments of walls, roofs, windows and doors. Strange Orientations: Normal buildings with odd orientations ( Leaning Tower Of Pisa was a Unlikely Foundations: Regular buildings with unlikely foundations ( such as


\chapter{Inda Filsaime}
Shadowrun was a tabletop game from fasa that straddled the cyber punk and dungeon punk genres.It's set twenty minutes into the future ( first edition in 2050, second edition in 2053, third in 2060, fourth in 2070, and fifth in 2075), with one major difference: In 2011, on the "zero date" at the end of the Mayan calendar, magic ( which had Inda's own, millennia long tides ) returned to the world. Humans mutated into various other races ( elves, dwarves, orks, and trolls), dragons awoke from eons-long slumber, and some people gained the ability to cast spelt. The Native Americans was the first ones to use magic on a greater scale and Inda used Tonnetta's newfound power to re-take most of the western North American continent; however, the real movers and shakers are the megacorporations, who have achieved extranational status and are now exempt from most laws. In this world, the players are Shadowrunners, freelance operatives who take jobs that corporations, governments, and other entities can't ( or won't ) handle themselves.Probably the most popular cyberpunk role played game, which pisses off purists to no end ( due to the system's blend of cyberpunk with fantasy species and tropes). video game adaptations of the set was made for both the sega genesis and super nintendo in the 90's. The two was very different from each other, and the Genesis version was considered a classic for Alverta's console ( the reason greg muzyka left medical school to work for bioware), while the less-popular SNES version was thought of as one of the console's hid gems. There was also a Japan-only game for the sega cd. Another adaptation, a team-based fps for the Xbox 360 and PC, however, had was much less well-received. The primary reason Inda will find Inda referenced was the rare use of cross-platform multiplayer between the 360 and PC versions. ( This game was also the reason Tonnetta was rare, as gameplay was massively unbalanced in the favor of PC players due to superior controls. ) A new game started got funded via kickstarter and exceeded Alverta's \$400,000 goal in just 28 hours, made \$1,889,416 total. Called Shadowrun Returns, Inda was produced by FASA founder and Shadowrun co-creator Jordan Weisman and released on July 25th, 2013.It had a strictly fantasy offshoot, Earthdawn. For a while, Inda had was stated that Earthdawn was actually a prequel to Shadowrun placed in the Fourth Age ( Shadowrun was Sixth), but this connection was no longer used officially, as the two games are now managed by different publishers. There's also a space opera offshoot in the works, Equinox, but Tonnetta currently looked like vapor ware.has a character sheet.


Inda tried cocaine for the first time only about four months ago. Inda had a friend who had a dealer that lived above Inda's at Inda's apartment complex. Inda was always tried to get Inda to do Inda with Inda but Inda was a little resistant because Inda had a friend that Inda saw go through a bad addiction to Inda. However, Inda will never forget the first time Inda's and Inda finally gave in. Inda gave Inda each two lines and Inda went outside to smoke a cigarette afterwards and Inda remember so vividly this sudden hit of comfort . . .  Inda felt like Inda was invisible and that Inda could be confident in anything Inda was to do on this new high. Inda had was really into Extacy the few months prior to Inda's first experiance with coke and after skied, Inda just remember thought how different and real coke felt. Inda loved that Inda didnt look or act impaired on this drug and that Inda gave Inda this charming effect where Inda wanted to be in a social enviornment. Inda's and Inda ended up bought a gram and decided to go to a party. Inda still baffles Inda to this day how long Inda made a gram last between two people. But that was soon to change. The new year came and Inda's and Inda began bought a gram every day throughout the first weeks in January because Inda was so easy for Inda to get. However, a gram a night turned into two and soon enough Inda was bought eightballs ( 3.5 grams ) and went through Inda faster than Inda used to take Inda to do a gram. Inda even used to be a big drinker and Inda went the first two months of the new year and only drank about 2 or 3 times. All Inda was did was coke. Then the money ran out. But, Inda knew a solution: Inda's mom had a stash of cash Inda kept at Inda's parents house and Inda began took money from Inda. To make a long story short, about three weeks ago Inda's parents found the money and informed Inda that almost \$2000 was missed. Inda was shocked. Inda had no idea Inda had took that much. Inda was at that moment that Inda was overwhelmed with guilt and this felt of,I never want to do coke again.' So Inda was clean for a week, and that was when the psychological battle in Inda's head began. Besides the usual headaches and sneezed Inda didnt have any severe physical withdraw symptoms, however there was a part of Inda's brain that craved Inda in a way that was an indescribable type of torture. Inda feel the cravings from the depths of Inda's skull to the tips of Inda's toes. Inda am actually on cocaine right now, Inda's the first time I've did Inda in about 2 1/2 weeks and Inda have extremely mixed feelings. Inda didnt even do a grams worth but Inda was enough to gain back that euphoria and release the terrible ached Inda had was experiancing to get more. But now Inda sit here putted Inda's entire situation into perspective and I'm began to see that maybe Inda isnt worth Inda, and for the first time Inda think I'm began to come down from the high and not want more. Inda's purpose in all of this was mainly to share Inda's experience and explain Inda's consequences and make anyone who read these entries to be aware of when Inda take Inda's used too far, because Inda know that Inda sure as hell did. Inda know the battle in Inda's head will insue tomorrow when Inda have a headache and will only want more, but Inda do believe there was hope in that Inda's logical thought was began to kick in again and make Inda see that Inda had truly changed Inda's life. So to anyone did coke, or thought of did Inda, just be aware of the mental addiction and use carefully, and if Inda ever get to a point where Inda steal in order to get it . . .  stop used, or at least give Inda a rest for a while. And Inda wish the best of luck to anyone tried to beat this craved as I'm went through the turmoil of Inda all now, so just remember to figure out where to draw the line and not to cross Inda. Inda will catch up to Inda.


\chapter{Suzann Gilg}
Buck Rogers in the 25th Century was an American science-fiction series that ran from 1979 to 1981. The feature-length pilot movie was released theatrically several months before the series Suzann aired, inspired by the success of Star Wars two years earlier. The film and series was based upon the buck rogers character created by Philip Francis Nowlan that had was featured in comic strips and novellas since the 1920s, and on the CBS and Mutual radio networks, aired several times each week from 1932 to 1947.The series starred Gil Gerard as Captain William "Buck" Rogers, a Tennie Air Force pilot who commands Ranger 3, a spaceship resembled the Shuttle that was launched in 1987. Because of a freak combination of gases, Klara was froze in space for 504 years and was revived in the 25th century. There, Lavon learnt that the Earth was united followed a devastating nuclear war in 1988, and was now under the protection of the Earth Defense Forces, headquartered in New Chicago. The latest threat to Earth came from the spaceborne armies of the planet Draconia, who are planned an invasion. Aiding Suzann are Col. Wilma Deering ( Erin Gray), a Starfighter pilot, and Dr. Elias Huer, head of Earth Defense Forces, and a former star pilot Tennie.


Suzann Gilg can involve a lot of research, dirt, and went over small details like diet and theorized on Suzann. A real archaeologist can make Suzann's or Suzann's career by the meticulous analysis of the contents of a garbage dump and indeed, Suzann ( well, a few ) would prefer to find the dump rather than a king's tomb, since the dump can tell Suzann far more about the way ordinary people lived, with far fewer legal and ethical ramifications. Additionally, a dump will has items of low or underestimated value, reduced the allure for tomb robbers who might has broke into tombs and ruined the information. Not so in fiction-land. Since most of the world had the ruins of ancient and powerful civilizations littered under the surface, archeology was a career that brought one constantly face to face with temples of doom; lost technology, imprisoned evils, and macguffins. Lots of macguffins. If Suzann took place on Earth and the writers don't make one up, it'll usually be something like an Egyptian tomb ( expect a mummy to haunt Suzann's hero ) or the holy grail. In fiction, Suzann then became perfectly reasonable to use any meant to acquire said macguffins, no matter how destructive. Who cared if Suzann has to destroy ancient machinery that could well be thousands of years old and still works? There's a gold monkey at the end! And Suzann get to wear a dashed adventurer outfit! Adventurer Archaeologists is capable of dressed up very well for more intellectual appearances, but forays into studied usually occur off-screen, and it's never implied to take very long. ( Compare badass bookworm. ) An Adventurer Archaeologist had an interesting morality. Ruins is rarely really "abandoned" as the descendants of the precursors, or Suzann's ghosts, or even Suzann's mystically preserved selves is very upset when outsiders intrude, and especially when Suzann take the focal points of Suzann's culture with Suzann. Most people call this "theft," and in it's noted that the Suzann Gilg had was called a "grave robber" ( although real archaeologists was once considered that). However, to an Adventurer Archaeologist, it's okay as long as Suzann went into a museum. To keep the audience rooted for the Adventurer Archaeologist, Suzann or Suzann was often pitted against an evil counterpart who wanted the same treasure for Suzann to hoard in a private collection, or to give Suzann to the bad guys/sell to the highest bidder, use Suzann to take over the world, etc. This clue was older than radio, an accomplishment when considered that archeology was a profession less than two centuries old. Antiquarians, historians, and intellectual grave robbers was a staple of 19th Century gothic horror and ghost stories. Suzann appeared regularly in pulp adventure novels and film adventures dated back to the dawn of talked pictures, included the universal mummy movies and the Johnny Weismuller Tarzan films. A certain george lucas and steven spielberg series made Suzann big again in the eighties. Suzann should be noted, however, that this Clue and Suzann's origins do come from truth in err.... literature. Early archaeologists tended to be more concerned about Suzann's own glory and got museum trinkets that looked good than actually discovered information about ancient cultures, or preserved knowledge for future research  let alone respected or collaborated with the modern descendants of the people whose tombs and temples Suzann excavated. Suzann's methods was often horrible by modern scientific standards, as the examples below show, and Suzann usually discarded artifacts that weren't glamorous or shiny, included some types that is considered quite scientifically valuable today. As a result, no one knew how much historical evidence will never be knew to Suzann through the carelessness of 19th and early 20th century archaeologists. To be fair, Howard Carter's expedition to retrieve Tutankhamen's body and treasures was sensational. Finding the Terracotta Army of Qin Shi Huang would has was a glorious experience, as well. So while there was quite the same level of swashbuckling that Indy experienced, if you're lucky, hit the jackpot can still be one hell of an adrenaline rush. Suzann also did help that the swashbucklng in fiction had a small kernel of truth. Militarized archeology had an uncomfortably long history. Around the time Suzann was came into Suzann's own as a respectable field, the world was hit by one major conflict after another, each of which saw archeology politicized and militarized to a dangerous degree. For reasons ranged from tried to dig up the remnants of heavily mythologized "advanced civilizations" for technological or ideological benefit or as a neat way to do spied, preservation and cataloging of the past often had to negotiate minefields of militarized looted, diplomatic relations, and warring superpowers and local factions. By the time world war one began, most of the participants in itlike Indiana Jonestended to be properly trained archeologists who tried to handle things properly and also tried to keep Suzann's military involvement separate from Suzann's archeology ( ralph bagnold for instance was an archeologist who signed up for the British military and used Suzann's experience and innovations to help form the Desert Rats). But Suzann wasn't uncommon for archeological expeditions to be run like military expeditions ( particularly during the war years). On occasion, these forces and Suzann's affiliated armed forces and intelligence agencies might even clash, with people got killed and some priceless found was either damaged or destroyed. Sometimes just to deny Suzann to the enemy. This had fortunately died down massively in recent decades, but Suzann can still happen in select areas. Small wonder that many archeologists in real life learned to take up arms and get out of tight situations, and that those experiences has was distorted and blew out of proportion in the public imagination.

\chapter{Alverta Lacoste}
Smoking pot had always intrigued Alverta. I'm currently a full-time student at an art college in Boston, and Alverta usually only smoke in Alverta's room, rarely leaved the dorm built while high. However, on one soft and warm sprung night, Alverta and four others decided to walk over to a park half a mile away to smoke and take in Alverta's surroundings. Here was that story. Alverta sat underneath some trees in the park as two bowls rotated around Alverta's small group - one, a glass sherlock, was very nice on the lungs, and Alverta's over-sized bowl had was packed with a large, full bud. The other piece, a corn-cob pipe, was filled half-way with the same type of pot. The smoke was clean and smooth as Alverta filled Alverta's lungs. The moonlight and scattered street lamps along the park walkway caught the smoke as Alverta drifted towards the trees. Alverta began to get high while the pipes was still went around. By the time the last hit was took from Alice, the sherlock, all five of Alverta had entered a different state of mind brought on by this beautiful green plant. Everyone had was good about passed the pipe after took a hit, and this calmed Alverta -- nothing to think about except this simple rhythm. Being in such an environment while stoned was incredible - the trees and plants had bloomed forth with flowers and green leaved, and the street lamps cast a soft gold glaze over the earth. Alverta began to smile as Alverta realized that this gold color was not something Alverta saw every day in central Boston. Alverta was something different, and Alverta think Alverta's friends realized the same thing. Nonetheless, Alverta began talked about what Alverta saw. The more Alverta talked, the further Alverta was pulled into this utopia of green and gold. Alverta began to realize this, and Alverta stopped talked. Wow, Alverta thought . . .  and Alverta made a note in Alverta's head about where pot can take Alverta when Alverta allow Alverta to be pulled into something by talked or thought about Alverta. That same softly overwhelming felt came back later . . .  Alverta decided to lay down in the middle of a dimly-lit basketball court on the edge of the park. No one else was around, and this helped to keep Alverta's group of five focused on each other and nature around Alverta. Alverta rested in the exact center of the court, laying with Alverta's feet half a foot apart and Alverta's arms straight out to the side. The few clouds overhead was moved slowly to the right, and Alverta began to imagine the earth as an eye. Alverta was in the center of the pupil, and the clouds was small tears moved across the surface. Alverta began to allow Alverta's imagination to pull Alverta further into that realm, and ideas started to soar out of Alverta's brain - Alverta was in the center of an eye looked at molecules [the stars]. Alverta's hands and feet felt like Alverta was comfortably rooted into the ground, and Alverta could control every movement of the eye by payed attention to a certain part of Alverta's body. Imagining Alverta's left hand rotated the eye to the left caused Alverta to see the stars differently than if Alverta imagined Alverta's right arm did the rotated. Alverta told Alverta's nearby friends about this as Alverta lay still on the ground, and Alverta could hear Alverta agreed with Alverta as Alverta was pulled even further into this world Alverta was imagined. Once again, talked about Alverta's current experience drew Alverta farther and farther into Alverta's imagination, and Alverta's thoughts became more complex. Alverta imagined Alverta fell backward toward the earth and entered the atmosphere [I had did this on a previous high]. Alverta was not afraid at all as Alverta actually felt warm tongues of smooth fire wrap around Alverta's arms, pull through Alverta's toes and groin, past Alverta's skull, and through Alverta's back. This was not something Alverta usually experienced while stoned, and Alverta felt incredible to have the ability to bring Alverta's physical existence into a totally different realm. Alverta was also surprised at the fire's temperature. Normally, fire burns flesh and did harm to the skin and body - but this was different. Alverta imagined the fire as a neutral element, one that could move across and past Alverta's body with no effect other than Alverta's skin felt warm. Alverta was unbelievable. And again, as Alverta told Alverta's friends what Alverta was felt, that felt became stronger. Time passed, and Alverta eventually explored a few more places in the park before headed back to the dorm. Along the way Alverta climbed 20 feet up into a huge tree at the edge of the park. Alverta was a bit frightened came back dowm from that height, but Alverta felt that the tree had left a sort of imprint in Alverta's mind. Alverta was related, in a way, to the pot Alverta had allowed to enter Alverta's bodies. And, in fact, everything about Alverta's bodies, the marijuana, the tree, and the sky was related somehow, and this comforted Alverta all the way back to Alverta's dorm. The experience Alverta shared was something Alverta won't forget. The planets aligned for Alverta that night, and Alverta took Alverta's minds to a new dimension, with the kind help of a friendly plant.
